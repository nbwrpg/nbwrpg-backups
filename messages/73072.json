All\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his movements and memories appeared to be the=\r\n same. It was only his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recent memories, the ones after they had rescu=\r\ned RODIMUS that last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time from HYDRAS that seemed to differ.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Also the MAXIMALS that NIGHLIGHT were saying were dead were beginning\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to stir. Perhaps they were not dead but were only in a deep stasis\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; lock. STAMPY&#39;s optics flickered for a moment as SHRAPEDGE actually\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; shifted a foot.

As MAGMATRON had geown to nealry 20&#39; in height, his sword was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; n=\r\nearly as tall as TUSCON himself was! &quot;Come, come and taste death!&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n swung the sword menacingly!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile DARK RODIMUS and RODIMU=\r\nS fought seemingly oblivious to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rest of the battle around them.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; RODIMUS sent a crushing blow to the side of DARK RODIMUS&#39; helme=\r\nt, only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to have it block by the mech almost effortlessly. &quot;You need t=\r\no come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trained to fight!&quot; He said, an evil smile across his face. Wit=\r\nh an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; open handed snapping attack to RODIMUS&#39; chest, DARK RODIMUS sent=\r\n him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sliding across the floor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; SLIDING across the floor =\r\nRODIMUS came to a stop as he looked back at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; DARK RODIMUS. &quot;Oh I do!&quot; =\r\nAs they both ran at each other again!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also on the floor the la=\r\nrger battle was taking place, SHARKTICONS\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coming at DINOBOT and SKYSH=\r\nADOW, their numbers quite large.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; RAT TRAP and QUICKSTRIDE also=\r\n faced SHARKTICONS that came at them,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their weapons firing at them wi=\r\nth powerful blasts!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However in the center of all things, hidde=\r\nn under the cover of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; battle SABERBACK came over to NIGHTLIGHT and=\r\n looked down at her. &quot;So\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you are the treasure that those two are figh=\r\nting over.&quot; He was of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course talking about the RODIMUS&#39; who were figh=\r\nting in the background.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; His voice was pitched too low for the =\r\nothers to hear except for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NIGHTLIGHT herself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, have =\r\nno doubt, your dark companion believes he is the real\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus . . . b=\r\necause he is . . . copied right down to the last techno\n&gt; &gt; &gt; engram.&quot; SABE=\r\nRBACK smiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; SABERBACK gestured back at RODIMUS, &quot;and he will=\r\n fight to the death.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He chuckled evilly. &quot;But you my pretty.&quot; He sai=\r\nd as he reached down to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pick up NIGHTLIGHT. &quot;I wonder how much of a t=\r\nreasure you can truly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Preston\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\r\n--Apple-Mail-AC2F6889-CD27-47FD-803D-578E14336843\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=utf-8\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Straight Shot turns her h=\r\nead quickly in Nightlight&#39;s direction and quickly bounds over to her as qui=\r\nckly as she can. &nbsp;While kicking up some dust, at a sharp halt, she rel=\r\neases a barrage of explosive quills in Saberback&#39;s direction in attempts to=\r\n back Nightlight up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;HEY, UGLY! &nbsp;EVER FEEL S=\r\nTUCK AT YOUR JOB?!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Local artist who specializes in illustration, us=\r\ning traditional and digital media. &nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also special=\r\nize in hand made crafts. &nbsp;Great for any occasion! &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Need a great gift idea that is original? &nbsp;No problem! &nbs=\r\np;Email me at this address and we will talk. &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On =\r\nFeb 12, 2012, at 4:29 PM, &quot;C&quot; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002@...&quot;&gt;=\r\nairly2002@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote ty=\r\npe=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Nightlight:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;=\r\nNO!...

It was only his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; recent memories, the ones after they =\r\nhad rescued RODIMUS that last&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; time from HYDRAS that seemed to=\r\n differ.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also the MAXIMALS that NIGHLIGHT were=\r\n saying were dead were beginning&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to stir. Perhaps they were n=\r\not dead but were only in a deep stasis&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; lock.

How can I leave knowing how&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; unstable this situation has become? I&#39;m sorry, but without that sense of&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stability I can not leave.
