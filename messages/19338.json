I know that \nwhy you chose me for advisor. But also if you keep makeing plans against the \nmaximals than my total plan woll fall apart. Even if you try to destroy the \nmaximals the allaincw will always end up saveing them. So we must attack the \nhead. Destroy the alliance first. Then the maximals.&quot; he stood up and awaited \nfor a responce.\n\n"}}
