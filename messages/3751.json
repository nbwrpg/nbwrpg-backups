Those blasted Maximals, don&#39;t they know\n&gt; &gt;we&#39;re\n&gt; &gt;on their side!&quot; Dark One yelled.  &quot;Transform!&quot; he commanded.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Breakdown transformed into his artillery cannon mode, Pyro to his tank\n&gt; &gt;mode,\n&gt; &gt;and Hiss to his gun mode, Dark One catching him and taking aim with it.\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Fire!&quot; he yelled, pulling the trigger of Hiss&#39;s mode, firing three\n&gt; &gt;powerful\n&gt; &gt;plasma blasts off at Iron Raptor since she was so big and it was so hard\nto\n&gt; &gt;hit people with a pistol without a scope at his distance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Breakdown&#39;s internal computers found the target.  Assuring him of the\n&gt; &gt;target,\n&gt; &gt;he fired an explosive shell 3 ft high and 2 ft wide off at Dinobot, even\n&gt; &gt;though Zardus was near him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Pyro swtiched his weapon.  Firing two missiles from the missile launchers\n&gt; &gt;in\n&gt; &gt;his tank form.  He still had the damage he had sustained in this mode,\nand\n&gt; &gt;it\n&gt; &gt;hurt like the Pit!  One missile flew off at Dinobot, the other at Iron\n&gt; &gt;Raptor\n&gt; &gt;in her gargantuan form, Pyro not sure who to shoot.  So many targets, he\n&gt; &gt;might as well take the big one.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Anubis and Hades leapt into the air.  Anubis transformed into a left arm,\n&gt; &gt;going into the air, while Hades turned into a leg, a left leg, heading\ninto\n&gt; &gt;the air.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;====\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Bumblebee yelled, the shots slamming him through a branch, though he was\n&gt; &gt;able\n&gt; &gt;to keep himself in the air.  Firing four missiles off at Ursa Major (two\n&gt; &gt;from\n&gt; &gt;each launcher), he fired two optic blasts off at Dark Mouse, deciding he\n&gt; &gt;shouldn&#39;t do that anymore, since he needed all the firepower he could\n&gt; &gt;muster\n&gt; &gt;with those Maxis around.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Injector, got back up, firing a single stinger missile off at Ramulus.\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; eGroups Alert: Save on long distance calls with beMANY.
