The plan sounds feasible, and since \n&gt; he wouldn&#39;t have to do anything but watch Flicker work, it suited \n&gt; him fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmmm, I will allow you to do this... In fact, this will work well \n&gt; with my plans to attack the Tripredacus base. Those insolent fools \n&gt; will pay for their stupidity.&quot; Megatron smiles cruelly, &quot;We shall \n&gt; attack as soon as you get to the Maximal Base. I, however, will not \n&gt; be carrying one of those communicators, Switchblade will.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron motions for Switchblade to approach and take one. He \nwasn&#39;t \n&gt; taking any chances, if there was a bomb or something like that in \n&gt; the communication device, he didn&#39;t want to be wearing \n&gt; it. &quot;Switchblade.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes Megs, you want me to wear the device as a precaution right?&quot; \n&gt; Switchblade nods in acceptance, &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll do it then.&quot; He \nwalks \n&gt; over to Flicker, and takes one of the communication devices from \n&gt; him, then waits for instructions on how to install it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron nods approval, then turns to the rest of the Predacons \n&gt; pressent, &quot;Now, the Tripredacus shall PAY. All Predacon troops move \n&gt; out to the Tripred base, but approach silently, so as to not \ntrigger \n&gt; the sensory array.&quot; Megatron moves his hands over a console on his \n&gt; chair.\n&gt; \n&gt; An image of the world map that they&#39;d compiled from exploration, \nand \n&gt; from educated guessing, and Megatron put a little marker on it \nwhich \n&gt; signified about where the Tripred base would be located.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Predacons.
