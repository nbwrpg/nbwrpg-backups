That this group was not\n&gt; exactly friends, but nor were they enemies.  Not registering them on his\n&gt; sensors, and not seeing any faction insignias upon them made him much more\n&gt; cautious.  But they also did not seem like Unicronians, for such would have\n&gt; attacked him or tried to play a sort of game.  So, with his energon\n&gt; slingshot over in his hand, and still charged, glancing up at the group he\n&gt; gave a bit of a bow.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then, piping up, &quot;As much as it intrigues me to say, you are a mystery that\n&gt; we have found out today.&quot;  Wheelie continued, going on, &quot;And I don&#39;t know,\n&gt; why are you here, what do you do, and whom was the one here that you spoke\n&gt; of that do?&quot;  His speach falling into old patterns now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing at the female, whom had identified herself as ASTRA, WHEELIE then\n&gt; spoke, &quot;HOw does one know who would stamp out life?  For in this world, many\n&gt; are here who give strife?  It is better to know, when knows one does not,\n&gt; who is an enemy and who shall not rot.  For when one sees what one does not\n&gt; know, a direct method is the way to go.  For I do not konw if you are my\n&gt; friend..&quot;  Tapping at his Autobot symbol, and hten pointing at their lack of\n&gt; insignia.  &quot;And I do not konw if you are my enemy, and thus I must be ready\n&gt; to defend.  So, in that case, the way to go..  Is do something that will let\n&gt; out the emotion and it to flow.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Still glancing up at ASTRA and FIREHORN warily, he continued his speaking,\n&gt; &quot;I do not know for whom you fight, or if you will try to send me into this\n&gt; bad night.  But for what I know, and what you have here, something strange\n&gt; is about, and it is near.  I go in search of my friend, to find out if he\n&gt; has met his end.  I do not know if he was who came near this place, or\n&gt; someone else did who showed his face.  So please, do let me know, what you\n&gt; hae seen and has come to go.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Telling, essentially, &#39;why&#39; he had acted the way he did in his own\n&gt; roundabout style to try and bait them, to see if they would attack him or\n&gt; restrain themselves and thus be identifiable.  And explaining that he had\n&gt; done so by their lack of faction insignia and the fact that there were many\n&gt; possible enemies on this planet, and thus one could never assume whom anyone\n&gt; was an ally of, or an enemy.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a pause from both of them as they took a moment to puzzle\nout WHEELIE&#39;s words, gathering the meaning from his lyrics.\n\n&quot;The small one does speak strangely.&quot; FIREHORN said as he shook his\nhead and rested the butt end of his axe on the ground, obviously going\nback to a far more relaxed position.\n\nHe looked at WHEELIE squarely, &quot;We belong to no one but ourselves\nhere.&quot; His words holding a certain amount of dignity. &quot;He hold this\npart of the jungle by hoof and blade.&quot;\n\nASTRA nodded, &quot;We can take you to Unus and the other one who is like\nyou.&quot; She pointed to WHEELIE&#39;s symbol, &quot;Perhaps there answers can be\nmet?&quot; She looked back and forth between WHEELIE and FIREHORN.\n\nFIREHORN nodded and then looked at WHEELIE, &quot;Then who be you? You have\nheard our names but we have not heard yours. We cannot let strangers\npass into our gates.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
