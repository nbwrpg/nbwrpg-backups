This ship was either Maximal in design\nor a convert of predicon make. Either way it was hardly difficult to make\nhis way down through the almost deserted decks to the main core area.\n\n    By the flashing lights and hub bub above him it was clear something was\ngoing on. As he sat on his haunches looking over a panel he reached up\nactivating an outside cam. When the picture tuned in  he grinned an almost\nferal grin as he padded quickly past the engines. Typical configurations and\ntypical locations for those annoying shields. &quot;Panthos terrorize!&quot; He spoke\nas he shifted back standing upright as he assumed his robotic form, his\nvisor scanned the shields main circuitry.\n\nShrugging he lashed out punching his metallic fist through the circuit board\nin front of him, his fingers uncurling inside grasping the wires and tugging\nhard, tearing at the systems guts, ripping the wiring out with a mighty tug\nand growl.\n\nWatching the monitors for the shields flickering as the power that fueled\nthis them flickered and died. Moving quickly he opened a hatch to the crawl\nspaces, which weren&#39;t much for crawling since they usually were constructed\nso a bot could stand upright within. Running along this his scanners looked\nfor a hatch leading outside. The &quot;leaders&quot; who owned this base weren&#39;t going\nto be too pleased that someone had slipped inside and tore the wiring from\nthier shield generator...for such comedic ranting Panthos wanted to be on\nthe outside of the base and out of turret range...\n\n\n\n"}}
