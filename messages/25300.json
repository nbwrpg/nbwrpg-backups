Prebon speeds up his \nflight and flies in the direction of the falling bot. on the way he \nfires three more shots at Fenox. \n\nIn an attempt at witty banter with Astral he keeps his comm \nopen. &quot;Troops are only as good as the bot in charge.&quot; He can&#39;t help \nto think how poorly these Alliance bots have performed in the battle. \nif it wasn&#39;t for the main gun the Trainers would probably be sitting \nin the command chair. &quot;So far with what I know about your leader I \nfail to be surprised that you can&#39;t win.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Oh, that helps (not)!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Astral/Fenox/Starlight/Slayer/Havoc::\n&gt; \n&gt; Astral&#39;s considers his choises for a second, but is then blown \n&gt; backwards by Prebon&#39;s missiles.

Two shots whizz by her, recieving little \n&gt; attention.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Starlight regains balance in the air, flying up and barely avoiding \n&gt; all of Prebon&#39;s shots but one. She regains her balance again, \nfiring \n&gt; at Prebon with her charge launcher.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Slayer&#39;s scanners pick up Iguanus, exactly 20000 leagues under him. \n&gt; He takes in a long breath, diving into the water.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Havoc swears as Slayer dives.

As he lifted off he was hit by various shots from \nAstral \n&gt; &gt; slowing down his liftoff. The trainer leader opened a link to his \n&gt; &gt; assailant. &quot;You have a choice to make, either keep attacking me \nand \n&gt; &gt; lose your prize or go catch it. What would your mighty leader say \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; you lost the bot that your friend was carrying?&quot; He already knew \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; answer so he didn&#39;t expect a reply. He let his weapons do the \n&gt; talking \n&gt; &gt; and fired two missles at Astral and five more blasts from his \n&gt; rifle, \n&gt; &gt; three at Starlight and two at the new bot.
