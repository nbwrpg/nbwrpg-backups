Before the mutant could act several shots\nstruck him in the back. (What types of weapons are we dealing with?)  forced\noff balance the Raptor wouldn&#39;t be able to use his forcefield and\ntransforming to Wolverine was out of the question as well, his speed was\nineffective if he had no place to go.\n\nElsewhere Foxfingers stayed to the shadows avoiding video cameras. He knew\nthat his position was vulnerable, he also knew that he was getting low on\ntoys. He&#39;d always been prepared for anything but this was one situation that\neven the best preperation wasn&#39;t enough for the Black Fortress.\n\nOutside Lunarpine continued his Ballet of death (Dramatic isn&#39;t it?) On all\nsides he had something shooting at him. One by one he knew the relays were\nbeing destroyed and the only thing keeping the defenses from getting a lock\non him wasthe dampner he was useing. The Bat probes weaponry was anoying at\nbest, they were obviously designed as scouts and not fighters. He managed to\npin one down for a moment, &quot;I tried to be diplomatic&quot; he said into it\nknowing that the Preds would be listening.  He leapt forward avoiding\nanother shot landing near a swooping bat, &quot;I tried to reach a peacefull\nsolution,&quot;  The wolf spun useing his tail to swat the probe harmlessly away.\nThe furious former Maximal was nearing a state of rage as the welcoming\ncomittee got ever close to him,  He snapped his head to the side grabbing\nanother probe damaging the wing, &quot;But if force is the only thing you\nunderstand then go ahead and destroy us, Turn the virus we carry into a\nplague, You will end up destroying us but in the process you&#39;ll contract the\nplague and wipe yourselves out as well and eventually wipe out the whole\nplanet.&quot; The wolf was exagerating about all of them carrying the virus but\nthe Preds didn&#39;t know that. Without samples of each of thier individual\nenergeon thre was no way of telling who had the virus. &quot;But if destruction\nis what you want then enjoy.&quot; The bats signal ended with a crunch as\nLunarpines teeth sank into it&#39;s functioning circuitry, those words would be\nthe last thing that the bat would ever send.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, September 06, 2001 8:24 PM\nSubject: thieves and trapped/Outside the BlackFortrress\n\n\n&gt; BlackFortress defences/Kali::\n&gt;\n&gt; The blackfortress defences continue to shot against Lunarpine; Kali\n&gt; was checking the computer, looking for the intruders and she saw\n&gt; thanks at the video camera that Ender was doing a deal with the\n&gt; intruders, she pressed several buttons and advice to Shivah, while\n&gt; she was telling hin what was going on all the doors, where Ender and\n&gt; the intruder were, closed and locked down -that doors had been made\n&gt; in that way that a normal weapon couldn&#39;t damage them.
