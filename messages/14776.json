In several seconds, Oblitertron roars, running after \nSurge, firing his giant laser gun, along with his optic lasers at the \nMaximal. He slowly gains on Surge, continuing to fire.\n\nBehind him, Zardus, Reptilica, and Bloodystrike follow behind, also firing \ntheir weapons at Deemos and group, their jetpacks blazing on full power in \norder to keep up with the giant bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer looks around him, at the Alliance bots still there. &quot;I think we \nshould get back to base,&quot; he says, &quot;Anyone need a CR chamber?&quot;\n\n"}}
