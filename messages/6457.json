He smelled \nAutobots, no, Maximals were what he smelled. Maximals? He questioned himself. \nHe wanted alive flesh. He wanted pulsating Maximal Sparks. He.....\n\n&quot;What the hell?!&quot; He roared. He now knew. He was a Decepticon. He was \nMegatron. No, he was now Megatron X. He still he a hunger for Maximals. He \nmust find them.
