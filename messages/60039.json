I mean this is something that is established\nin Cannon and to much greater extents in both distance\nand mass than what&#39;s happened here. I honestly thought\nthis group would actually use common sense with\nRPGing, rather than taking the attitude of &#39;cause the\nrules say so. I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t play in an RPG\nwhere the rules give way to common sense, which in my\nopinion is the same bad gming that resulted in a\nmassive adendum in the REF Field Guide sourcebook for\nthe robotech rpg because people were using a total\nlack of common sense with things like regular humans\nversus explosives  where a player under the rules\ncould brush off an explosion at point blank range by\nusing their sdc or physical resistance to damage.  I&#39;m\nsorry, but I&#39;m not gonna play in an RPG where common\nsense plays second fiddle to the rules rather than\nunderlying them.  I&#39;m outta here. \n\n --- Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@...&gt; wrote: \n---------------------------------\n1) Teleportation is allowed as an introduction only.\nPrimus may be \nin there, but it still is banned by the rules.\n\n2) The idea to bring Unicron has the objetive to make\nintersting RPG \nexperiences.
