Notice that there are\nother big names in the movie.. Judd Nelson as Hot Rod, Robert Stack as\nMagnus, Lionel Stander as Kup, Eric Idle as Wreck Gar, Orson Wells as\nUnicron. Such a host of oustanding names in Hollywood. \n&gt; As to before the Qiunts, hard to say. However, the Quints were a\npart of Unicron&#39;s minons. A lot of the episodes being released inform\nalot of Transformer history now. &quot;5 Faces of Darkness&quot; is an excellent\non informing the time of when the Quints governed Cybertron to how the\nAutobots & Decepticons came about & up to the present day. Awesome\ninfo in that episode if you ask me. \n&gt; \n&gt; Stac \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo!
