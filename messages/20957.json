She&#39;s the only one that hasn&#39;t betrayed me. And I&#39;m \nthinking right, she&#39;s still your friend to.&quot; she said, looking up at \nQuickstrike. She knew she was right. What bothered her was the fact \nthat she still had feeling for Quickstrike. She also knew that he \ndidn&#39;t give a care about her, much.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike leaned back. &quot;Ah don&#39;t need yer protection.&quot; He looked \n&gt; back at Dark Mouse.
