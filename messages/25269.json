Ironraptor you are weak. you\n&gt; would let your guard down so Zardus and the alliance can stabbs us in the\n&gt; back. no the maximals will never fall not today not ever. To all maximals\n&gt; this is Angel Prime. you have two choices give up everything you ever\nfought\n&gt; for and all you dreams and hopes so the Alliance can walk over us. Or you\n&gt; can push back and fight the alliance to the bloody end. and go out with\nsome\n&gt; pride. Ironraptor is not the leader she wants was. lets not fail.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Angel Prime flys up and opens his wing wide and starts firiing little fire\n&gt; like rain but it pure fire.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [just to point this out on behalf os Soulstice. she has a point you notice\n&gt; that every time the alliance attack the maximals they lose.
