Oh well, Rattrap, when Tuc=\r\nson gets back things will be different.

No offense but, he&#39;s the=\r\n one who put this together and I don&#39;t think Hydras can keep things in line=\r\n without that extra boost from Wings.

Master Yoketron once said that when he was tra=\r\nining my brother and Nightshift.  Leo, That&#39;s it!  Rattrap&#39;s right!  We nee=\r\nd ta find my brother before all else!  Hydras!  You&#39;ll think I&#39;m off my roc=\r\nker but believe me if Master Yoketron said this it&#39;s gotta be true!  Two dr=\r\nagons are better than one.  One representing good and the other representin=\r\ng evil.  One balances out the other and together they form a power which ca=\r\nn stand to be undefeated.  It&#39;s an old tale but it applies here.  Leo, plea=\r\nse trust me on this, because it could really depend on how things play out.=\r\n  You gotta find my brother and bring him back here.. ta Hydras.  Hydras, y=\r\nou and Tucson are those dragons.  Together you can form a powerful bond tha=\r\nt no other force can defeat.  Not even Magmatron.
