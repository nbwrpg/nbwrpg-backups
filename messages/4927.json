She went behind a tree to \ncatch her breath.  She looked and saw Quickstrike tackle the cheeta.  she \nran out to the fuzor.  Her teeth ready to rip into him, her claws ready to \ndig into flesh, her lunged at him for a tackle.\n\n\n-------------------------------\nQuickstrike/Cheetor:\n\n\n\n\nQuickstrike pressed his shoulder tightly to the tree. He kept his eye on the\nMaximal. Cheetor shot at him twice. The Fuzor ducked over. The side of the\ntree shattered, and the hit almost got his shoulder. He could see the kid\nwas scared. If there was a way he could get around to him and hit him with\nvenom he might be able to end this faster.\n\nQuickstrike dashed to another tree, to his right. Cheetor kept firing. He\neven screamed at one point. Quickstrike paused, watching him. He decided to\ntake a risk. This was one Maximal. There were at least three Predacons in\nthe area, even if two were female. He never misjudged the opposite sex.\n\n&quot;Kid,&quot; he called out and fired at Cheetor. A second later, as Cheetor was\ndodging and wincing, Quickstrike charged out. He ran as fast as his legs\nwould carry him. His feet made too much noise to be able to sneak up on him.\nHe plan was to catch him by surprise.\n\nThe Maximal picked himself up and fired as he kept moving. He was only a few\nfeet away. A shot hit his foot, sending him down, but at the same time,\nQuickstrike grabbed him, and dug the long fangs into his side.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
