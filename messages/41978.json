Then, a voice from the pod blurted out to \nanyone who happened to be listening, &quot;Main stasis chamber power failure. \nEnergy at 23%. Attempting to activate protoform.&quot;\n\nThe stasis pod stuck up a small antenna and, using power as miserly as it was \nable, began a sweep for an acceptable life form for its occupant. Only one \nhappened to be close: A weasil, which the pod had landed on the nest of and \ntrapped. The weasil chittered angrily at the massive metal hulk above its \nnest, and was replied to with more status reports from the pod.\n\n&quot;Species found. Adapting protoform to life form WEASIL....&quot;\n\nThe pod suddenly released a puff of acrid blue smoke, and sparks jumped from \none end to the other. &quot;Error in solidification&quot;, it reported. &quot;Conversion \nfrom protomatter to proto-nano-bots: 100%. Conversion from proto-nano-bots to \nnano-bot structure drones: 80%. Conversion from nano-bot structure drones to \nrobot metallic alloy: 0%.&quot;\n\nThe stasis pod&#39;s computer hummed, buzzed, and shot some sparks. &quot;Main power \nlevel at 3% and falling.&quot; it informed the jungle denizens. &quot;Enacting \nemergency protoform augmentation code to supplement incomplete structural \nsystem. Computing maximum benefit,,,&quot; The computer fizzed some, and one of \nits memory units burst into flames from power core fluid which was spilling \nonto it. The stasis pod beeped ominously, and made a decision. &quot;Optimal \nprotoform survival necessitates immediate intelligence. Inserting \nmacro-neural algorithmic artificial intelligence module to temporarily \ncontrol protoform.&quot; \n\nThe stasis pod&#39;s viewport glowed brightly for a moment, as almost a third of \nit&#39;s proto-nano-bots were reconfigured to become a computer. With that \ncomplete, the stasis pod opened itself, and a mass of fluid gunk, supporting \na small computer with tendrils extending throughout it, and another tendriled \nvacuole holding the protoform&#39;s still-unconscious spark, gathered itself from \nthe protoform bed and climed out of the stasis pod.\n\nThe nano-bot paste, controlled by the computer, oozed about 20 feet before \ncollapsing into a puddle, its energy mostly spent. Resting in a small ditch, \nthe computer began to think.\n\n[Safety has been achieved. I have achieved safety for this spark. This spark \nmust now be activated by me. Me... I? I.. am. I am Iss. Iss must activate \nthis spark.] thought the computer. (Author&#39;s note: I will put Iss&#39;s thoughts \nin square brackets.)\n\nIss reached one of its tendrils through the nanoprobe body, and stroked the \nspark container, which activated it, and also created a thought-link between \nIss and the spark.\n\nThe spark thought. &quot;I have no body! No senses! No components! Am I dead? Am I \nin the matrix?&quot; [You are not in the matrix, spark.], replied Iss. [What is \nyour name?] &quot;I am Vorb&quot;, thought the spark. &quot;If I&#39;m not dead, then what&#39;s \nwrong with me? I&#39;ve never experienced this, or even heard of it.&quot;\n\n[You nearly did die, Vorb. Your protoform was not completely converted into a \nrobot. You consist of nano-bot structure drones and proto-nano-bots. Before \nyour failed activation, the stasis pod chose a species for yout beast mode.]\n\n&quot;If I&#39;m made of structure drones, then make a body for me! Robot mode, with \nall the normal stuff, plus a beast mode too, please.&quot; thought Vorb.\n\n[Your thought is my command. Be patient, though, for structure drones are \nslow to be adapted outside of a CR chamber or a stasis pod.]\n\nOver the next hour, the puddle lying on the jungle ground lengthened itself \nnoticeably. After about two, a basic bi-pedal humanoid form could be \nrecognized, but still looking like a slightly melted metal casting of one. By \nfive hours, the structure drones had collected and hardened themselves into \npseudo-robot-parts, and the proto-nano-bots began to change for sensory \ninput, simple weapons, and computer access.\n\nSeven hours after Vorb was awakened, the new body opened its eyes. &quot;Finally&quot;, \nsaid Vorb, aloud, through his new mouth. &quot;I am activated.&quot;\n\n[Be warey, Vorb] warned Iss. [Your body is not hardened metal alloy like a \nnormal robots; it is composed of structure drones. You are very fragile.]\n\n&quot;Fragile, shmagile&quot;, thought back Vorb. &quot;I need to find help. Why can&#39;t I \nremember anything?&quot;\n\n[Your memory banks were destroyed when the stasis pod landed. To your left, \nyou can see what remains of it.]\n\nVorb walked over to the pod, and plugged into the emergency auxilliary power \nto recharge himself, then grabbed an empty power cell, for filling up later. \n&quot;I must find allies&quot;, he thought.\n\nOver his radio, Vorb began to broadcast. &quot;Attention all protoforms. We are \nVorb and Iss, poly-intelligent robot form. Henceforth we will refer to \nourself in singular as VorbIss. I require information about what factions \nexist on this planet. Please reply.&quot;\n\n------------------------------------\nHere&#39;s a copy&paste of the VorbIss info page from nbwrpg.com\n\n\n\nGender: Male \nAlliegence Neutral \nAlternate Mode(s): Weasil, Puddle \n\n\nDescription:\n\nVorbIss is mostly made out of nano-bots. The nanobots form his body, while \nother core functions are done by specialized machinery. All the nanobots are \ncapable of doing is changing shape, with the exception of a small supply of \nvery specialized information-warfare nanobots. \n\nVorbIss has a literal split personality, in that in addition to a spark \ncontainer he has a very advanced, and very insane, computer AI. Both of these \nare connected to a nanobot control unit, without which the nanobots are \nunable to function. However, a nanobot puddle will broadcast a homing beacon \nso that it can be found later. A nanobot control unit can control any \nnanobots which it is in physical contact with, so that if VorbIss touches a \nnanobot puddle he immediately gains control of those bots. \n\n[Example of control unit: \nIf you shoot off VorbIss&#39;s arm, and the arm doesn&#39;t have a control unit in \nit, then it will simply fall to the ground. Over a period of about an hour, \nthe nanobots will cease to hold their positions (since they have no \ncontroller), and the arm will have melted into a small puddle spewing radio \nwaves.] \n\nVorbIss&#39;s spark is named Vorb, and the AI is Iss. If VorbIss is split in two \nsomehow, and Vorb and Iss are separate, then Iss will act without Vorb. \nHowever, Iss is (as mentioned above) insane. \n\nIn addition to the spark container and computer, VorbIss has one taser, onem \nedium-powered cutting laser, a small jet engine, and a computer interface. \nThese arec ontrolled by nano-bot control units as well, but are not made of \nnano-bots. Any other hardware VorbIss encounters lying around can also be \npicked up and used by his nanobotc controllers as well. \n\n[Example: \nIf you shoot off the arm with the taser, a puddle with a taser in it will be \nthe result. \n\nIf VorbIss finds device X, then device X can be integrated into him and be \ncontrolled and accessed by his nanoprobe controllers. \n] \n\nVorbIss&#39;s nanobots are a deep green, and unable to change color. They are \nalso unable to quickly rearrange themselves to change shape, so normally \ninstead of being a fluid being VorbIss&#39;s nanobots take the shape of standard \nrobot components, and harden themselves. \n\nVorbIss is a relatively fragile bot, because impacts which would not damage a \nregular bot are capable of tearing the nanobot bonds. This means that if you \nswing a sword at him, instead of causing a big dent the sword will cut right \nthrough him. \n\nBecause Vorb and Iss share the same body. Iss is constantly supplying Vorb \nwith weird ideas. Although Iss&#39;s motives are volatile and insane, Iss is \nquite intelligent, and can provide very usefull assistence with Vorb&#39;s \nguidance. \n\nVorbIss specializes in computer hacking and information warfare, both of \nwhich come especially easy to him because Iss is a computer. In addition to \nsimply hacking, VorbIss designs and implements hidden data taps and homing \nbeacons with the help of a limited supply of specialized nanobots. These \nspecialized nanobots are able to maintain simple orders without a control \nunit, allowing his taps and beacons to operate on their own. \n\n"}}
