He flipped up to miss the \nslash and \n&gt; used all his force to go straight down on top of the bot. He was on \nthe bots \n&gt; back. He wrapped his legs around the bots waist. He took his left \narm and \n&gt; grabbed the bots left fore arm to keep it down. He used his right \narm to grab \n&gt; the bots right forearm. He wrapped his tail around the bots left \nshoulder and \n&gt; yanked it with all his strength to the left. Ripping it off. \n(because I am \n&gt; right on top I am allowed to post some damage.) His teeth shined in \nthe sun. \n&gt; He took a large bite into the bots right shoulder. His teeth \nclenching in. He \n&gt; pulled to the right with enormous power most likley ripping off \nthat arm \n&gt; unless the bot had some type of super glue holding him togeather. \nTo make \n&gt; sure her through out his fire energy wich would incenerate it on \ncontact. \n&gt; When his tail had wrapped aroung the left shoulder the end stuck \ninto the \n&gt; bots ribs.  Sucking out his mech fluid and into galvatron. His \ngreen jewel \n&gt; glowed and shot a beam right through the bots upper back area. Wich \nwould \n&gt; come out his middle chest.his knee guns shoit multiple energys into \nthe bots \n&gt; sides. Galvatron smiled with his teeth in the bots right shoulder \nas the \n&gt; flame energy came out with a muffle sound he said.... &quot;Some things \njust \n&gt; shouldnt tast like chicken.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
