Hey, I was wondering if I could get Teltoli \nand Kit as my characters?)\n\nThe Oblitercons/Nemesis Enforcer/Scattershot/Koga Shuko/Hades/Anubis/Unitron:\n\n\nInside the downed Predacon ship (Set and Shuko&#39;s), Unitron finished setting \ndefenses and other counter measures up, heading into the CR room and getting \ninto a chamber.\n----------\nAs Unitron got in his CR chamber, Anubis and Hades got of theirs (seperate CR \nchambers for them).  \nStretching, Anubis spoke.  &quot;Slag, I feel so much better!  Let&#39;s get to the \nbridge.&quot; he said, walking out of the room, followed by Hades.\n---------\nKoga Shuko, getting out of his private CR chamber, entered the lab.  He could \nsee in the device he had put Serpentor&#39;s fang in, a scaly pair of \nyellow/green legs and a pelvis had appeared.  Checking the device, he found a \nsmall screen that read: &quot;45%&quot;.  Ah, this should only take another 25 cycles \nor so, then we will meet this fellow, head on!&quot;\n\nRecieving the Truth&#39;s com transmission, replies to them.  &quot;Come to these \ncoordinates, 14.23, 234 Alpha.  You will recieve 30 energon cubes (150 LBS \nAKA 68 Kilos)\n\n==============\n\nNemesis Enforcer awoke, having dozed off for a few dozen cycles.  Looking up, \nhe saw the Oblitercons getting out of their CR chambers.  Smiling, he stood, \nkicking Scattershot awake, who stood up next to him.  With a smile, Nemesis \nEnforcer looked to the Oblitercons.  &quot;What the slag t-&quot; Nemesis was cut off, \na right hook from Breakdown, Scavenger uppercutting Scattershot.  The two \nAlliance members were thrown into CR chamber by the Oblitercons, the CR \nchambers beginning to repair the two bots.\n\nDark One, Breakdown, Pyro, Hiss, and Scavenger headed for the bridge of the \nship, fully recharged and repaired.\n\n"}}
