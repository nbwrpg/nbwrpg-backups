She saw the forest and valleys below. \n  She didn&#39;t want to talk.  She just wanted to get this over with.  She knew \nthat she could never forgive herself, so why should Vulios forgive her.  She \njust flew and kept up with CyberShark.  She looked around, she wondered \nwhere that big red flyer went to. She shook her head, it didn&#39;t matter.  \nhardly anything mattered anymore to her.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
