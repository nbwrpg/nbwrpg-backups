It brought back memories of his \nlife before he met Veratis and LadyHawk. A life he&#39;d never know \nagain. He figured that someone else would be better suited to move \nHot Rod so he scampered in the direction of Prowl. &quot;Is your friene \nfunctioning?&quot; He yelled at the top of his vocal unit as he ran to \nhelp.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; You missed the small but important fact that Prowl is kinda flying \n40 feet or \n&gt; so up in the air, Carnage, but we can say he was on the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Oblitertron/Prowl::\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl&#39;s eyes widen as he sees the Oblitercons combine. That was the \none thing \n&gt; he hadn&#39;t wanted to happen; the giant Alliance gestalt caused too \nmuch death \n&gt; and destruction.\n&gt; \n&gt; A shadow covers Prowl as Dinobot runs up to him, mechfluid spraying \nover \n&gt; Prowl as Dinobot is hit. He swears, glancing back at Oblitertron as \nanother \n&gt; shadow passes over him, this one of Oblitertron&#39;s foot.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Oblitertron laughs as Dinobot is hit with his optic lasers, \nbringing a foot \n&gt; down on the two bots. Before the foot has a chance to hit either of \nthem, \n&gt; though, a tail smashes into Oblitertron&#39;s head, the bot stubling to \nthe side, \n&gt; his foot missing the Maximals by a few feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; He spins around, firing his rifle and optic lasers at Necromancer.\n\n\n"}}
