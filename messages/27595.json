Astroblast then rockets out of the\nhorizen, transfroming into train mode, slowing his progress. Wildrider and\nDead-End step out of him as he transforms. &quot;Okay, SPeedbreaker give me the\npersonality components, Wildrider, Dead-End, give me the cassetes&quot;. With\nthat Astroblast recieves them all. He slowly inserts a small pink cylander\ninto each cassete. After a while of waiting, Wildrider speaks up, &quot;What the\nslag is taking so long, I wanna bust something up,&quot; but is stoped form a\nblast from behind. Motormaster emerges, put back together, his gun smoking.\n&quot;Whats going on, I have a splitting headache&quot; he spits. Wildrider rights\nhimself, his shoulder smoking from the wound, &quot; uh sir, we were just,\nwhat&#39;s that&quot; he shouts pointing towards the flying jet (Triggerhappy)\nrocketing towards them. &quot;HHHMMMMM, could it be those slagging Maximal cats\ntrying to finish me off&quot; Motormaster states. All the Stunticons raise their\nweapons towards the jet. &quot;Announce yourself&quot; Astroblast says over the\ncommlink, hoping the jet will hear him.\n\n\n\n"}}
