She was getting sick of this, to sick to even care that the Alliance had turned their weapons towards her.\nShe looked up and glared at Reptilica as he aimed his weapon at Prowls head, silently coming up beside him and simply pushing his weapon so that it pointed towards the floor.*\n\n&quot; You&#39;re in no position to make threats here, Reptilica. We&#39;re the ones with the explosives in your engin room. So don&#39;t push it!&quot;\n\n*She continued to glare at him with no fear in her spark, too pissed off to feel any in the first place.\nThen looking back at Prowl she opened her com-link, a growl in her thoat and a look on her face that even Megatron wouldn&#39;t want to deal with her.*\n\n&quot; ENOUGH OF THIS! All of you, get your skid-plates back to base! NOW!&quot;\n\n* Her expression was deep in concintration and anger, the thought of her own Maximals disobaying an order only making the situation worse.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;ll expect to see each and every one of you in the Conferance Room when we get back! Iron Raptor...out!&quot;\n\n* She then looked over at Prowl with the same determined and angered expression, yet not aiming it at him. Deactivating her com-link she sighed deeply.\nBut then her expression sofened a bit, knowing that now their lives depended on the fact that Arcangle and the rest followed HER command.\nNow, they had to wait and see.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
