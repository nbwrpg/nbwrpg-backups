Since \nI&#39;ve not been able to find a suitable place to slip L.H. in, I&#39;ll do \nit here.

He was \ndesperately BORED and wished for some excitement. How he wanted to be \nin battle...The future held some promise. Maybe he&#39;d be able to do \nmore than build energy installations on the sidelines.\n    Primus...all this waiting was making him restless.\n    He sighed and lifted his legs up onto the edge of the computer \nterminal, using his micro-lazer to widdle away at a lump of metal. He \nhated being a part-time warrior. He thrilled in the excitement of \nbattle . He wondered what dull and boring things (despite the \neagerness of his comrads) awaited him at his destination.\n    (I guess I&#39;ll have to wait and see) he thought.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n***********************\n\n\n"}}
