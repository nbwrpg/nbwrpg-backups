My comp is barely hanging on, and crashing every few minutes. Some vital parts of the system were on the sectors of the hard drive that were physically damaged, so it dies every time it tries to access them. I currently don&#39;t have a comp other than my home one to post from, so please exuse the sparse posting. I&#39;m getting a new harddrive as soon as possible.\n\n::Scavenger::\n\nScavenger feels himself being grabbed, letting the bot carry him back to the ship.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: sorry rdahl, rauq, and everyone else waiting to get chars of \n&gt; cybertron for holding you all up....\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Havotron/Dreadwind/Darkwing/Scrapper/Needlenose/Repugnus/JetV/Crotal\n&gt; e/Slag::\n&gt; \n&gt; Havotron looked to the bots around him.  &quot;Dreadwind Darkwing, carry \n&gt; Scavenger back to the ship, it will be much faster.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The two bots combined and once again roared off grabbing at Scavenger.\n&gt; \n&gt; Havotron spoke again over comm link...&quot;Spinister, Needlenose... hurry \n&gt; and get the bots at the bar.
