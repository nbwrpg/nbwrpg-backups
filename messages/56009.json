Sabre&#39;s tall black and red form Lifted \nhim \n&gt; quickly. His large black Bat wings twitched as he turned to \n&gt; WingRazor. &quot;How are we doing over there Wing?&quot; He placed Rave down \n&gt; and walked over his taloned feet clicking on the floor.\n&gt; \n&gt; WingRazor turned frowning. &quot;Were breacking up, The rifts already \ntore \n&gt; the ship wide open. Her hawk like eyes looked the panels over. &quot;As \n&gt; long as C deck holds we&#39;ll be fi...!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The ship lurched as they began heading towards the atmosphere. The \n&gt; split began tearing further... \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Blast the Elders!&quot; We just lost C-Deck and the Stasis pods are \nfree \n&gt; floating! WingRazor growled and they began to hit the atmosphere. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Strap in team... were going down&quot; Sabre straped himself in as \nthey \n&gt; watched the pods spread out... &quot;We&#39;ll find you...

Rave \ndid \n&gt; like wise his blue black body almost lost in the darkness. \n&gt; \n&gt; The maximal ship began to burn as it began breacking apart the \nimpact \n&gt; split the ship in half sending the back end sliding away... \noverhead \n&gt; two pods fell from orbit and landed as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sabre looked up. &quot;Everyone alive?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wing looked up. &quot;I think.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rave opened one eye. &quot;Naw man, i&#39;m dead...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Sabre chuckled looking up and seeing the power was still \nworking... a \n&gt; maximal sign was flashing.... &quot;Hope you guys see us first.&quot; He \n&gt; pressed the distress signal as he blacked out...\n\n\n"}}
