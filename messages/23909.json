Shadow cat rolled her eyes and sighed*\n\n&quot; He always manages to make some stupid remark out of anything and \neverything!&quot;\n\n* She runs ahead of him barring his way*\n\n&quot; You stupid ass! it would take too long to walk! Get your ass back there so \ni can air lift your fat ass to our new home!&quot;\n\n* He saluted her and spun on his heel, facing the way he came and marched \nback to his original position, facing Iron Raptor. He looked at her with \ntwinkeling eyes and spread his arms so Shadow Cat could lift him. Shadow Cat \ngraspe dunder his arms and spread her wings, lifting her and Snow Tech off \nthe ground about nine feet. She spoke to Iron Raptor before she took off \ntotally.*\n\n&quot; We will meet you there, i&#39;m sure that we can come up with some thing to at \nleast tip the odds to our side.&quot;\n\n* And with that spooken, she lifted herself and the white bot off into the \nsky, but not before Snow Techs smart assed remark came down to the other \ntwos ears.*\n\n&quot; This is little kitties airlines, we are ready for take off, over. Yes, you \nare cleared for take off little kitty. Thank-you mission control, rodger \nthat. Vrooom!!! Last one there is a over-sized scrap heap!&quot;\n\n* His giggling annoyed Shadow Cat and she was tempted to threaten him with \nbodily harm , but knew that would give him the satisfaction of getting her \ngoat, so she kept her mouth shut and steered off to the left sharply so he \nsquealed like a little girl. She smiled and headed to the base at full \nspeed.*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
