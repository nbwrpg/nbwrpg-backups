Yet his legs very s=\r\nhakey from the paraylizing effects of the weapons, it was clear that his up=\r\nper body was returning.  Still rather dented from his ordeal, and damaged, =\r\nhe was not about to let Darkhawk get his way.\n\n&quot; On the contrary, same here=\r\n.&quot;  \n\nHe sends a sonar wave to Rat Trap, which intern, interrupts the effec=\r\nt of the paraylasis dart, thus returning him to a somewhat normal state.  H=\r\ne gets back up and stands to watch the action unfold.\n\n&quot;Now ya really slagg=\r\ned my pal off, Feather Head..  Nice gon&#39;.&quot;\n\nTucson thrusts Darkhawk to the =\r\nground harshly and then transforms.  Rat Trap gets the cue and gets into hi=\r\ns front cab.  He helps his friend by blasting at the door, forcing it open.=\r\n\n\n&quot; OKAY WHEELS, NOWWWW!  BURN RUBBER!&quot;\n\nTucson spins his tires and creates=\r\n another smoke screen with his duel exhaust system as his engine roars to f=\r\null tilt.  Now he was able to sense Nightlight, and before leaving he was d=\r\netermined to get her out of there.  It may not have been Rodimus who he had=\r\n intended but if he could not save his leader, he would at least save a tru=\r\nsty comrade.  \n\nRat Trap keeps buckled in. Tucson assesses his systems, and=\r\n finds his location tracking units online.\n\n&quot;Tracking systems online all sy=\r\nstems working at sixty percent, and I have now pinpointed Nightlight&#39;s loca=\r\ntion.  She&#39;s been moved.&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks back, seeing that Tucson had a ch=\r\nance to literally run Darkhawk over but chose not to.\n\n&quot;Awww rats!  Ya didn=\r\n&#39;t run feather head over!&quot;\n\nTucson replies.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s not the Autobot way, R=\r\nat Trap.  We do not take lives needlessly.  But, if some of my speedster co=\r\nmrades can get away with tearing the track, why the slag shouldn&#39;t I?&quot;\n\nHis=\r\n speed climbs to one forty MPH. Rat Trap holds on for dear life.\n\n&quot;WOOHOOOO=\r\n!  THAT&#39;S WHAT I&#39;M TALKN&#39; ABOUT! Full speed ahead, next stop,knight in silv=\r\ner armor take one.  Ya know, if she takes one look at you, she may fall hea=\r\nd over heels for ya.&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles although it hurts him to do so.\n\n&quot; Y=\r\nou&#39;re too much.&quot;\n\nRat Trap keeps an eye behind them via Tucson&#39;s rear view =\r\nmirror.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re right, I gotta keep focused.  They&#39;ll be after you like ho=\r\nunds on a criminal after that little display back there, which I may add, w=\r\nas rather impressive.&quot;\n\nTucson navigates through the tower, with Rat Trap a=\r\nt the wheel.\n\n&quot;Hey, pay attention to what&#39;s in front of us, I don&#39;t want to=\r\n smack into the wall here.&quot;\n\nRat Trap quickly averts a wall while getting T=\r\nucson away from it.\n\n&quot;Whooops, good point.  And this is why I ain&#39;t never g=\r\not a driver&#39;s license.  Okay Wheels, which way?&quot;\n\nHe takes a hard left, fol=\r\nlowing his sonar systems.  He slows his speed down once comming to where th=\r\ne signal is the strongest.\n\n&quot; We&#39;re here.&quot;  \n\nRat Trap gets out as Tucson s=\r\nlowly transforms into his robot mode.  He finds himself unstable on his fee=\r\nt, and stumbles into where Nightlight is, and falls on his knees.\n\n&quot;Wheels?=\r\n!  What&#39;s wrong?!&quot;\n\nTucson had not rested, and his damages again taking the=\r\nir toll.  He slowly gets back up onto his feet and realizes that his robot =\r\nmode takes more energy than his vehicle mode.  He had to remain in bot form=\r\n, if he was going to get Nightlight out of her bind.  \n\n&quot;Night - Light.  It=\r\n&#39;s - me.. Tucson.  I - don&#39;t have much energy left, but I have not forgotte=\r\nn about you.  R- rodimus, is hopeless.  I - can not save him now, but I can=\r\n definitely save you.&quot;  \n\nWith what appears to be a scream of anger, over w=\r\nhat Zarak and the others had done to Rodimus and Nightlight, Tucson uses a =\r\npowerful blast of sonar energy, to short out the security system around Nig=\r\nhtlight&#39;s holding cell and risks further pain by trying to break the force =\r\nshields around her, using his own body as a buffer!\n\n&quot;AHHHHH!!!!

And seeing that Darkhawk was right over him, it was his tur=\r\nn to make a move. \n&gt; \n&gt; With an unpredictability that clearly spelled his n=\r\name, Tucson sends a sonar signal, aims, and shoots at Darkhawk with a light=\r\nning reflex, sending an arrow clear into the dart riffle, in an attempt to =\r\ndisable the weapon!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Check mate.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: KK \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; IC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Darkhawk Quickl=\r\ny moves and shot a paralizing dart against Rattrap &quot;That&#39;s true little rode=\r\nnt&quot; said the Predacon &quot;You have a bigger mount&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Sandy \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, February 22, 2010 10:43 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Recovering Rodimus/BlackFortress\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whil=\r\ne inside Tucsons&#39; helmet, Rat Trap quickly delivers a shot of concentrated =\r\nEnergon via a fine needle.
