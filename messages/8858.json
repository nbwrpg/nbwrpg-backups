She let the other images pass by until she saw the image of the little snake-bot in the main section where KitKat said where the strange wolf-bot was. She did see it, and she also saw Quickstrike. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She shook her head, breaking the link. &lt;EM&gt;It&#39;s not enough, &lt;/EM&gt;she said.

She &lt;BR&gt;&gt;went through her mind from when she first went into the cave to the &lt;BR&gt;&gt;pond, to the tunnel, to finding Quickstrike, to seeing the strange &lt;BR&gt;&gt;wolf bot, to being kicked across the cave, to escaping out of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt;cave. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
