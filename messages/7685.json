It smelled of something that she \nhad never smelled before. It had a terrable smell to it.\n&quot;What is that muck?&quot;  She looked into the water.  It was too black \nand too dark to see anything.  She turned and looked at Rowdy. She \nwas getting worried for her comrads.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Rowdy Wolf:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf followed KitKat into the tunnel, where it lead to the \nlarge, dark \n&gt; pool.
