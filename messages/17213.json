Hot Rod, Battera, and \nCybershark would probably need reprogramming, but how to do that \nwithout them knowing... But it didn&#39;t matter. Their data tracks could \nbe cleared, but Hot Rod&#39;s could come in useful.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll see what Skulletron&#39;s situation is later,&quot; he says, stopping \nat a door to the CR chambers, he opens it, walking into the lab. He \nwalks over to a table and places Squizzy on it, strapping her in as \nBattera&#39;s transmission reaches his comm-link.\n\n&quot;But reprogramming is a good idea. Can you watch this femm? I have \nsomething to attend to. I&#39;ll be back shortly, then we can talk. If \nshe stirs, inject that liquid into her.&quot;\n\nHe points to a vial filled with green liquid. Turning, Zardus walks \nout of the door, and to the exit of the base. He passes Battera and \nopens the door, looking over the femm outside.\n\nLooking down at the femm, the Alliance commander&#39;s red optics record \ndata about her, his scanners, along with the Alliance base&#39;s, \nscanning her. Zardus steps out, the door closing behind him.\n\n&quot;I assume you&#39;re the bot that has Battera steaming?&quot;\n\n---------\n\n\n"}}
