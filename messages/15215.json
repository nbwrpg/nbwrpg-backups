He was going to take Berserk out \ninto public. He needed to see how he would react. And plus, he needed \nto get the clone some weapons. He tried to retreive them but the \ncourt-bots had labeled them evidence. So, the scientist team would \nhave to get a whole new set of weapons for the big, burly bot at \ntheir expense. \n\nHe opened his comm to Techy from his desk: &quot;Techy, tell the others \nwe&#39;re taking Berserk today. We&#39;ll take the hover down to vector C. \nThere&#39;s a weapons shop down there.&quot;\n\n&quot;All right.&quot; she replied.\n\n\n"}}
