She was very nervious here, but she hoped that she&#39;d be\n&gt; allright.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Truttle and Blyer looked ahead and saw the battle at the Cybertronian Fire\n&gt; on the horizon. Truttle did a quick scan.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well, those bases are definitely Maximal.&quot; He said through the com link.\nHe\n&gt; wated a few seconds while Cledar assessed the situation and then sped up\n&gt; when the order to assist the Maximals was given. The jet and the shuttle\n&gt; arrived at the battle in a matter of seconds.\n&gt;\n&gt; Blyer scanned the area, finding a suitable target, which was a large\ngestalt\n&gt; fighting another gestalt. The scan on the gestalt showed that he was a\n&gt; Decepticon. Blyer armed two missiles and made the neccessary calculations\nto\n&gt; allow the missiles to successfully fly the distance required. He gained a\n&gt; bit of altitude, and then a plate opened on both of his sides. A missile\n&gt; dropped out of each opening, fell a bit, and then turned on its engine. It\n&gt; quickly gained speed and flew at Surgital&#39;s side, but if the gestalt tried\n&gt; to evade it, it would follow him.\n&gt;\n&gt; While Blyer was firing at his target, Truttle landed on the ground and\n&gt; opened his hatch. Cledar, Rixer, and Furrier jumped out and into the\naction.\n&gt; Hefting a very big plasma cannon across his shoulder, Cledar jogged away\n&gt; from Truttle and picked out the first Decepticon he saw. He pulled the\n&gt; trigger and a giant beam of plasma lashed out, heading for Vehement. Rixer\n&gt; ran near him, a plasma pistol in one hand and a missile launcher in\nanother.\n&gt; His shoulders, which looked unusually large for a bot, suddenly launched\noff\n&gt; as two bee-bots to intercept any missiles that would be fired. Rixer&#39;s\n&gt; shoulders now looked normal, though still very large, and he shot two\nplasma\n&gt; shots and a missile at Predator. Farrior watched his teammates start to\n&gt; fight and then transformed into a large tank. He was greyish black, and\nhad\n&gt; a central turret along with a few side ones as weapons. The central turret\n&gt; could shoot a concentrated big beam of plasma while the side ones could\n&gt; shoot missiles and lasers. Quickly picking out a target, he fired a large\n&gt; beam of plasma at Injector. Now that he had no more passangers, Trattle\n&gt; transformed back into robot mode. He was medium built, and mostly green\nand\n&gt; blue. His two machine guns were already in his hands. Jogging toward Hell\n&gt; Beast, he fired shot after shot at the back of the Predacon&#39;s head.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
