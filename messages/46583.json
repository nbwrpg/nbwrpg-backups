The real\n          =\r\none. Another person posted that characters are not allowed to die\n         =\r\n currently...he is utterly incorrect.\n\n          The problem is the role-pl=\r\naying 101 aspect. People are given the\n          responsibility to judge ho=\r\nw much damage they take...however as we&#39;ve seen\n          some can&#39;t role-p=\r\nlay their way out of a wet paper bag let alone responsibly\n          judge =\r\nhow much damage their character takes. When a bot does get damaged\n        =\r\n  what typically happens here?\n\n          Here&#39;s the list:\n\n          1) Th=\r\ne enemy bot suddenly becomes cockeyed unable to hit the broad side of a\n   =\r\n       barn even if he was a g1 and standing over it.\n\n          2) The bot=\r\n never gives chase to his prey. It always lets the long time\n          char=\r\nacter slip away.\n\n          3) A short stay (a few hours usually) in the CR=\r\n chamber and any damage is\n          completely gone.\n\n          4) The cha=\r\nracter &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back as an enemy\n          infiltr=\r\nator.\n\n          5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone appears which after =\r\nvarious meeting\n          with colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; turns good again.=\r\n Personality reverts to\n          pre-evil clone.\n\n          6) Character &quot;=\r\ndies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful offspring. Personality\n          is =\r\nhardly different.\n\n          7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but the players 6 other ch=\r\naracters cart it&#39;s blasted\n          carcass back to a lab where they resur=\r\nrect him.\n\n          8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with new bot same personal=\r\nity...eventually\n          people will forget you died and you can go back =\r\nto your old form.\n\n          Since most will never let their &quot;favorite&quot; cha=\r\nracter(s) die, I mean truly\n          die, never come back like, there&#39;s re=\r\nally very little new plotlines you can\n          do with them without repea=\r\nting rehashed already done ones. Take for example\n          the geotrons pl=\r\naning to attack the new cat faction....both factions will\n          survive=\r\n, I doubt either player who controls the majority of bots in either\n       =\r\n   faction is gonna let their characters get anywhere near killed.\n\n       =\r\n   And what&#39;s to stop this from happening if a restart/sequel DOES occur? T=\r\nhe\n          role-playing by some will still stink, characters will still b=\r\ne incapable of\n          dying and given another year or so all plotlines f=\r\nor THAT game will be\n          starting to repeat. While I still do believe=\r\n a restart/sequel is in order I\n          think the role-playing problem ne=\r\neds addressing first to stop a repeat of\n          what&#39;s happening to NBW.=\r\n\n\n\n\n          ----- Original Message -----\n          From: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_ra=\r\nuq_x@...&gt;\n          To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n          Sent: Sund=\r\nay, January 20, 2002 5:57 AM\n          Subject: All Read: Important\n\n\n     =\r\n     &gt; My appologies, Narrator, I actually missed your original post.\n     =\r\n     &gt;\n          &gt; I find that Neo Beast Wars has been dragged on for too l=\r\nong, and the\n          &gt; world is becoming clogged with bases among other t=\r\nhings.

I have very few characters.

The =\r\n\n          real&lt;BR&gt;one. Another person posted that characters are not allow=\r\ned to \n          die&lt;BR&gt;currently...he is utterly incorrect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The pro=\r\nblem is the \n          role-playing 101 aspect. People are given the&lt;BR&gt;res=\r\nponsibility to \n          judge how much damage they take...however as we&#39;v=\r\ne seen&lt;BR&gt;some can&#39;t \n          role-play their way out of a wet paper bag =\r\nlet alone \n          responsibly&lt;BR&gt;judge how much damage their character t=\r\nakes. When a bot \n          does get damaged&lt;BR&gt;what typically happens here=\r\n?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here&#39;s the \n          list:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) The enemy bot suddenly becom=\r\nes cockeyed unable to hit \n          the broad side of a&lt;BR&gt;barn even if he=\r\n was a g1 and standing over \n          it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) The bot never gives ch=\r\nase to his prey. It always lets \n          the long time&lt;BR&gt;character slip =\r\naway.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) A short stay (a few \n          hours usually) in the CR cha=\r\nmber and any damage is&lt;BR&gt;completely \n          gone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4) The charact=\r\ner &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back \n          as an enemy&lt;BR&gt;infiltr=\r\nator.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil \n          clone appears which=\r\n after various meeting&lt;BR&gt;with colleagues or &quot;loved \n          ones&quot; turns =\r\ngood again. Personality reverts to&lt;BR&gt;pre-evil \n          clone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6) =\r\nCharacter &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful \n          offspring. Per=\r\nsonality&lt;BR&gt;is hardly different.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7) Character \n          &quot;dies&quot; but =\r\nthe players 6 other characters cart it&#39;s blasted&lt;BR&gt;carcass \n          back=\r\n to a lab where they resurrect him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8) Character &quot;dies&quot; \n          r=\r\neplace with new bot same personality...eventually&lt;BR&gt;people will \n         =\r\n forget you died and you can go back to your old form.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since \n      =\r\n    most will never let their &quot;favorite&quot; character(s) die, I mean \n        =\r\n  truly&lt;BR&gt;die, never come back like, there&#39;s really very little new \n     =\r\n     plotlines you can&lt;BR&gt;do with them without repeating rehashed already \n=\r\n          done ones. Take for example&lt;BR&gt;the geotrons planing to attack the=\r\n new \n          cat faction....both factions will&lt;BR&gt;survive, I doubt eithe=\r\nr player \n          who controls the majority of bots in either&lt;BR&gt;faction =\r\nis gonna let \n          their characters get anywhere near killed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A=\r\nnd what&#39;s to stop \n          this from happening if a restart/sequel DOES o=\r\nccur? \n          The&lt;BR&gt;role-playing by some will still stink, characters w=\r\nill still be \n          incapable of&lt;BR&gt;dying and given another year or so =\r\nall plotlines for \n          THAT game will be&lt;BR&gt;starting to repeat. While=\r\n I still do believe a \n          restart/sequel is in order I&lt;BR&gt;think the =\r\nrole-playing problem needs \n          addressing first to stop a repeat of&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;what&#39;s happening to \n          NBW.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Messag=\r\ne -----&lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; \n          &lt;x_rauq_x@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: \n =\r\n         &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Sunday, January 20, 2002 5=\r\n:57 \n          AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: All Read: Important&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; My appolo=\r\ngies, \n          Narrator, I actually missed your original post.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; I find \n          that Neo Beast Wars has been dragged on for too lon=\r\ng, and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          world is becoming clogged with bases among ot=\r\nher things. Ideas \n          are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; becoming exausted, if not complete=\r\nly exausted already. It \n          seems to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; me that we are almost d=\r\nelaying the end of the rpg. If \n          you&#39;ve created&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one storyl=\r\nine that you like, is it not fair to \n          say that you can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; cr=\r\neate another better one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          The idea of creating a =\r\nsequel to the rpg is one that I would \n          agree&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with. That w=\r\nould require several things to \n          happen:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) Changing the n=\r\name of the RPG.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) \n          Appropriate changes to the website.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; 3) A means to store all of \n          everyone&#39;s previous characters=\r\n (don&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; know about everyone \n          else, but I don&#39;t want to lo=\r\nse the bio&#39;s of all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my \n          characters).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4) New story=\r\n (i have an idea, not necessarily for \n          the story, but for&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n how we could create the story).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 5) \n          A catalyst to start =\r\nus all off (the story should provide \n          that).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 6) Implement=\r\nation of new rules, some of which have \n          been, and are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; bei=\r\nng, discussed in the login \n          messageboard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 7) other stuff =\r\nthat could be written if I wasn&#39;t \n          so tired.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; All =\r\nin all, since there are more people \n          voting anti-restart that I&#39;d=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; anticpated, I&#39;ll ask everyone a \n          perhaps fate deciding q=\r\nuestion:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Would it be favourable \n          to have a sequel=\r\n instead of a restart?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          --- In nb=\r\nwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt=\r\n; I&#39;m agree with Soulstice, restart isn&#39;t good idea.

Not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; am I seemingly not =\r\ntoo much an important part of \n          this RPG, despite&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the=\r\n general current lack of members, \n          and the fact that I&#39;ve been&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for getting \n          close to 2 years, but also I=\r\n am not involved in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          restart. I have very few c=\r\nharacters. Characters that, if the \n          RPG&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; r=\r\nestarted, will still be together \n          (Insecticons, specifically), an=\r\nd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; therefore it wouldn&#39;t \n          harm me to vote yes. Howeve=\r\nr, I don&#39;t think&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          could vote yes, because =\r\nI am apposed to restarting the RPG. I \n          have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; decided =\r\nto vote no. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me \n          to end the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nsaga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of Neo Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great \n          saga that we&#39;v=\r\ne worked hard over&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; years to \n          keep going.=\r\n I don&#39;t think that we could suddenly pretend&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; never happened, I think it&#39;s impossible. Maybe if we \n          ended=\r\n it and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; started the sequel, I wouldn&#39;t mind so much, \n        =\r\n  but otherwise, my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vote&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is no.
