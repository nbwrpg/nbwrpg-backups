It has been \nsuch a long time since fuel and smoke filled his sensory receptors. He \nstood for a few seconds to enjoy it. He then stepped out of Cyclonus \nand walked towards the Hill Motormaster had positioned himself at. \n&quot;Excellent Motormaster&quot; Megatron commended him. As soon as Motormaster \nnoticed Megatron there he stood to attention and saluted him. He then \nelbowed Dead-End, who was nearest, to do the same. &quot;Stand down&quot; he \ntold them. He walked up to the peak of the hill, and scanned the \nbattle field for Shockwave.\n\n\n\n"}}
