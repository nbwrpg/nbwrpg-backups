Perceptor has proven his \n&gt; loyalty to us.  He has done many favors which would have cost him his life \n&gt; if he were to be brought to Hydras now.  To me that takes a lot of \n&gt; courage, and courage is something a Maximal and an Autobot are known for. \n&gt; Let&#39;s try to put things behind us, because we have a road ahead of us that \n&gt; is not shy of being perhaps one of our most difficult journeys.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;I mean that I&#39;m getting softer&quot;replied Dryly Perceptor&quot;In our world \n&gt;&gt; thats\n&gt;&gt; somethign that we couldnt afford, the slightest weakness or mistake means\n&gt;&gt; the dead...
