She was never very good \nwith these things, but still wanted to learn about them. She saw how \nthe DNA was structured and how it interlinked.\n&quot;Do you think that if the viru is still present inside of me that I \ncan still, ah, change?&quot;\nShe wasn&#39;t to sure on how the answer may come out, but she was very \ncurious about it.\n\nShe heard his comment on Lunarpine and her spark fell slightly. &quot;Yes, \nI suppose your right. But I still have great feeling for him.&quot; She \nbreathed a heavy sigh and walked over to her corner.\n\nShe layed down and wondered what would happen to her and Lunarpine.\nShe was thinking about how he said he would help her, but how could \nhe?  It was her problem to get her new form under control, not his.\n\nShe stood up and tried to transform into the griffen mode. But she \ngot stuck. her wings didn&#39;t come out fully and her owl head was \njamming half way out. &quot;ARRHHGG!&quot; she groaned.  She stopped and tried \nagain, but she couldn&#39;t transform fully. She strained and make the \ninternal gears grind. It gave out a loud grinding sound as she \nfinally finished the transformation. But she wasn&#39;t a griffin. She \nstood upright on two legs, covered with soft, white fur. Her head was \nher robotic head. Her hands were still like her polar bear paws, but \nher fingers were more defined.  Her light gray owl wings were on her \nshoulder blades.  She looked at herself and smiled. &quot;This is a form \nthat I think I like.&quot;  Her female figure was more defined with this \nmode, even though her body was covered with soft, white fur.\nShe felt like her body had finally settled down. The tingling feeling \nhad stopped and her internal proccesses had ceased to change.\n\nShe smiled.&quot;I&#39;ll stay here in the lab untill you tell me to. And I&#39;m \nsorry for running away earlier. I know that it was stupid of me to do \nthat. From now on, I&#39;ll follow your orders. Also, can you do one more \nscan? I want to make sure that I won&#39;t change any more.&quot; She \nchuckled, &quot;If I keep changing, I&#39;ll start to have an identity \ncrisis.&quot; she couldn&#39;t help but laugh a little. It had been a while, a \nlong while since she had laughed.\n\n\n\n"}}
