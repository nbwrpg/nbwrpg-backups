Anger began to build up in him, at himself. Why was he so \nstupid? Prowl sighs, looking at the three other bots in the room. If he had \nknown that his teasing would have had this effect, he wouldn&#39;t have spoken \nback there.\n\nHe looks at the other bots, keeping quiet.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster frowns, looking from Iron Raptor to Battera. As he heard it, this \npeace talk was a risky operation, with alot of chance of ambush. But it was \nthe commander&#39;s decision, he&#39;ll keep his mouth shut untill she started making \nbad ones.\n\n"}}
