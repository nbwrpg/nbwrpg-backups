Of all the things \nthey could be doing now the last thing she desired to do was make a fool of \nherself in front of a fellow warrior. Especially a warrior such as Dinobot. \nHe could easily run down any prey he desired, that she was sure of. She \ncouldn&#39;t even trail a rabbit.\n\nTavatron sighed and kept on walking, there was nothing she could do about it \nnow, she had slready agreed to the hunt. Tavatron took a mental note of her \nsurroundings, scattered trees, a few boulders, mostly dirt and grass. It was \nalways important to know one&#39;s surroundings. To their left, however, lay a \nbeautiful forest, one she had visited many times before.\n\nTavatron sighed inwardly, a single thought crossing her mind, *it&#39;s now or \nnever...*:\n\n&quot;The hunting ground I spoke of lies beyond those trees, in the forest.&quot; \nTavatron indicated the forest with her paw. An odd feeling hovered in the \nback of her mind as she walked towards it. She shook her head but the \nfeeling lingered.\n\nAs Tavatron neared the forest she finally realized what it was... fear. She \nwas afraid to make a fool of herself in front of Dinobot. Tavatron growled \nin annoyance, now was not the time to let her emotions get the better of \nher.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
