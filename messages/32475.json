Optic laser charged while the target reeled back out of arms length, though the blade of the sword still bit into his midsection. He had been struck and this would be no small wound, thighs and legs already coated with a thick layer of mech-fluid which seeped from around the blade. Dinobot roared but not from pain, muscles tense and contracting around that of the sword which was inside of his structure and holding it tight. The sight already target at FireBlade&#39;s throat, he fired a combination of extreme plasma radiation and paralyses protons at the designated area. However, what was to some next was unexpected.\r\nCircuitry and armor melted as the blade seemed to erupt into a single flame, though only internals were effected. Dinobot cringed and suddenly jerked, sliding from the blade with a metallic ring. **\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
