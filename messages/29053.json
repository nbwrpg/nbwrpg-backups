She \nalmost was swept off her feet when a large branch snapped into view. She \njumped back, suprised.*\n\n&quot; Wass that?&quot;\n\n* A large, furry head popped out from the trees, jittering at her in anger. \nIt large, furry snout working at break-neck speed. It shook a large paw at \nher and dissapeared into the dence foliage. Snow Tech walked up behind her*\n\n&quot; What was that? It looked like a giant chipmunk!&quot;\n\n* Shadow Cat nodded*\n\n&quot; I know, what a strange world this is!!!&quot;\n\n*They walked further into the forest, but stopped when they heard a \ncommotion at the edge, or at least near, of the forest. They strained they \nears forward, hoping to hear what it was before approaching.*\n\n&quot; It might be a pred&quot; Shadow Cat whispered to Snow Tech. &quot; Let me go ahead \nand see first, no need to take unessary chances with the kittens.&quot;\n\n* She handed him the two kittens, who by now were all played out and fast \nasleep. She crouched low, consentrating on the shadows and making herself \nseem invisble by manipulating the robotic eye to see through her, or making \nthem see that she was just a shadow. She slunk forward and into a battle \nfield, careful to keep low to the ground. As she reached a hill, she spyed \nIron Raptor and prowl, seemingly exhasted by fighting. Around them were \nseveral new bots. She frowned. She couldn&#39;t tell what they were. But she \nwouldn&#39;t confront them, just in case they decided to hurt Iron Raptor or \nProwl. She slunk a little ways below the hill. She needed to think on what \nto do. She wouldn&#39;t call Snow Tech, because he had to look after the \nKittens, and she didn&#39;t want to put them at risk. She frowned. The best \napproach would have to be a direct, friendly one. She stuck out her tounge. \nNot her best subject, but she&#39;d do it anyway. She knew I.R. must be weak, \nand she didn&#39;t wnt to leave her with strangers. So, she took a deep breath \nand stood up tall and walked over the hill, looking at them all. She stopped \nand placed her hands on her hips, cocking an eyebrow at Iron Raptor*\n\n&quot; Having fun? Why wasn&#39;t I invited?&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
