A new poll has been created for the \n&gt; nbwrpg group:\n&gt; \n&gt; Yan implied he might be coming back \n&gt; this summer.  I think in respect for \n&gt; him someone (who is FAR more capable \n&gt; than me) should post for Zardus as the \n&gt; leader of the Alliance in the restart \n&gt; until he returns.  Do you agree? \n&gt; \n&gt;   o Yes \n&gt;   o No \n&gt;   o should ask Yan, but yes if he aproves We it would be a good idea \n&gt;   o it&#39;s a dumb idea, but I guess we should ask Yan \n&gt;   o I don&#39;t know who Yan is \n&gt;   o SHUTUP DEWY NOONE LIKES YOU AND PROPOSALS LIKE THAT ARE SUPPOSE \nTO BE MAD BY THE POPULAR ONG TIMEMEMBERS! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To vote, please visit the following web page:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/polls \n&gt; \n&gt; Note: Please do not reply to this message.
