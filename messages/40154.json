If your post abides by the rules then it can&#39;t \nand \n&gt; won&#39;t be disregarded. You shouldn&#39;t need to worry about have any \n&gt; illegal posts, most initial posts tend to be incorrect for various \n&gt; reasons. You&#39;ll get the hang of it quickly. =) Take Soulstice&#39;s \nstart \n&gt; post for example.\n&gt; \n&gt; WarBarge, don&#39;t encourage him! =P\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 17 Jul 2001, at 23:06, dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Sorry I&#39;m putting alot of work into these and I hate any \npossibility\n&gt; &gt; they could be dubbed illegal.\n\n\n"}}
