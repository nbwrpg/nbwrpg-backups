The room was\n&gt; d=\r\nominated by the medical bed upon which RODIMUS PRIME lay. The rest of\n&gt; the=\r\n room was fairly standard for a private repair chamber. A small\n&gt; closet wa=\r\ns off to one side, shelves, a small table a computer\n&gt; interface console, p=\r\nresumably for the doctors and staff, but could be\n&gt; set to allow the patien=\r\nt limit access as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only door apparently leading out of the ro=\r\nom was the one that\n&gt; WHEELIE was using, and there were no windows, the onl=\r\ny light coming\n&gt; from overhead lamps.\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS looked up as WHEELIE ope=\r\nned the door, he much better than he\n&gt; did last time, his optics bright and=\r\n clear. &quot;Wheelie!&quot; He said a smile\n&gt; on his face as he sat up. &quot;Tell me, wh=\r\nat&#39;s going on?&quot; RODIMUS gestured\n&gt; at the room at large, &quot;These nurses and =\r\ndoctors won&#39;t tell me\n&gt; anything.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\nWHEELIE paused.  This particular se=\r\ntup confused him a great deal.  While he would assume Rodimus was familiar =\r\nwith how an Earthern medical facility was setup, he would not think that th=\r\ne medics here who were treating him would have made such an exact match, or=\r\n even set it up according to such parameters if they had no datatracts.\n\nWh=\r\neelie&#39;s menaderings within his processor were cut off over by the gesticula=\r\ntions from Rodimus as he responded, &quot;You&#39;re in bed.  You look like you aske=\r\nd Grimlock to dance on your head.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
