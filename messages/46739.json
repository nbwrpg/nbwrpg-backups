The \n&gt; shots that Void ducked all hit Lady Right in the shoulder.  She fell \n&gt; backwards then got back up on her feet.\n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;Hey Void, is that cloud of your combutibal(SP?)?&quot;  Lepord yells.\n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;Obviously Not, cause Thirst just shot some shots.&quot;  Lobsturck \n&gt; says.\n&gt; \n&gt;    With those words Lobstruck fires 4 Eye Lasers.  Once seeing \n&gt; Lobsturck fire the two other preds fire.  Lady Right fires 25 \nbullets \n&gt; from her arms and fires 4 Eye Lasers and Lepord fires 4 shots from \n&gt; his gut gun and fires 4 eye lasers. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Dewboy from your earlier post Thirst was a short distance \nfrom \n&gt; void. \n&gt; &gt; There is no way he would be PBR at the moment. And as for the acid \n&gt; it is \n&gt; &gt; covering his entire body. If he ejected his armor he&#39;d be screwed \n&gt; anyway \n&gt; &gt; because the acid in the cloud would just cling to his now exposed \n&gt; super \n&gt; &gt; structure which noone can eject because it is the body itself. And \n&gt; as for the \n&gt; &gt; flames sticking to void, even if they did it would have been put \n&gt; out \n&gt; &gt; immediately by his body. Thank you dewboy for screwing your \n&gt; charachter over.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; IC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the four not so point blank range plasma blasts fly out at \nVoid, \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; quickly ducks to avoid them. At the same time the acidic cloud \nonce \n&gt; again \n&gt; &gt; expels a red acidic ooze all over thirst now eating away at his \n&gt; very \n&gt; &gt; structure.\n\n\n"}}
