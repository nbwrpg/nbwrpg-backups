It could get a little choppy on older \ncomputers, it didn&#39;t actually make it quite userfriendly, i just \nthrew it together.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Nice.  Whenever you get around to changing it again (that could be \na \n&gt; while), I request that you throw in a black death&#39;s head insignia \nfor \n&gt; the Rogues.  No rush, just whenever you find a good, basic skull \n&gt; (minus the lower jaw).\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
