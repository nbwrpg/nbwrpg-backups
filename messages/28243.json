He laughed, raising a hand, three laser bolts lancing \nout from the palm at FZ&#39;s sternum.\n\nRaising the other arm, he launched off an ES-seeking missile at the clone&#39;s \nleft knee joint.\n\n---\n\nVehement flew hard left firing off a couple optic blasts, intercepting the \nmissiles, the two EMP bolts striking his chest, being absorbed by a part of \nhis tattered Archbishop robes that were still in good condition.\n\nRaising both arms together, he fired a large invisible sonic wave that shot \nout at Kilfest&#39;s torso, the wave designed to badly damage internal circuitry \nwhen used on a target enough.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher fired off five optic blasts on an intercept course with the \ninbound missiles, pulling hard left in his flight, making sure he stays in \nthe general direction of the northeast towards &quot;Red Hero&quot;.  One missile \nblasted him in the chest, knocking him back in the air, extra power to both \nboosters in his feet allowing him to regain his balance in the air, blasting \nforward at an accellerated speed.\n\nRaising a wrist he launched off two energy-signature seeking missiles at \nGreven.  In his left hand appeared a grenade launcher from subspace.  Already \nset to explode on impact, he fired off two of the small explosives downward \ntowards Greven.\n\n---\n\nReflector raised a wrist, making quick modifications to a missile he launched \nit, exploding a few feet in front of the other missiles to block them.  He \nfired six rapid blasts in the general direction of the missiles just in case.\n\nHe raised his left arm, firing down a spray of acid at Endbringer, raising \nthe same twin-barreled mounted launcher attached to his wrist that had been \nfired to intercept the enemy missiles, firing one energy-signature seeking \nmissile from one barrel down at Endbringer, two regular missiles down at the \nPredacon immediately after, the Brotherhood member staying on course.\n\n------\n\nHot Spot watched as two CR chambers opened and he yelled.  &quot;Come on!  Follow \nme!  Battle outside, no time to explain!&quot; he yelled, running full speed.\n\nBlades looked to First Aid and gave a confused look.  &quot;Didn&#39;t...we just fight \nin a battle?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, we better hurry though.&quot; the medic replied, going after Hot Spot with \nBlades in tow.\n\n------\n\nDemon Wulf felt to blasts strike his right knee and he almost feel, but with \na free hand he pushed himself back up.  Opening his mouth he fired off a long \nburs to flames at Streetwise.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper formed a black orb in his hand and threw it at the Cybertronian \nFire.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw launched off two more missiles at the Cybertronian Fire from his \nports, moving forward a meter.\n\n---\n\nGroove slowly got to a knee, taking out a charge and throwing at the space in \nbetween Flesh Ripper&#39;s feet.\n\n---\n\nStreetwise fell to his back as the flames hit him full force charring his \narmor.  He didn&#39;t get up.\n\n---\n\nShockwave made a barrell roll and armed two more missiles.\n\n"}}
