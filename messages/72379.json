They had remembered something\n&gt; Tucson had said to them.  Straight Shot walks beside Leo and puts a gentile\n&gt; paw on his leg.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ya know, Tucson told us something that he wanted to tell you but never had\n&gt; the chance to.  He told me that if he had the matrix in his hands, he would\n&gt; not hesitate ta give it ta you, because he felt that even though he was\n&gt; named a Prime, he felt that if anyone is worthy of the Matrix, it would be\n&gt; you.  He told us he will always be committed to us but there was more to\n&gt; being worthy of such an honor than just keeping promises.  There is so much\n&gt; more that measures the worth of the Matrix bearer, and he felt he hasn&#39;t\n&gt; quite lived up to that yet.  But he says you have more than proved your\n&gt; worth .  He may try ta recover it but he promises it will be passed right to\n&gt; you if he gets it somehow.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from LEO PRIME, &quot;Prime is a title now, there are so\nfew who truely carry a shard of the matrix crystal anymore.&quot; There was\na small grim smile. &quot;The matrix still chooses its owners. Sometimes\nthat ownership is a wieght that many find difficult to carry.&quot;\n\nAs they arrived on the bridge, TORCA was alread rising from the\ncommand chair, AIRHAMMER and BANTOR at the navigation and helm\nconsoles.\n\n&quot;Ready for lift off.&quot; TORCA said.\n\nLEO PRIME stood looking at the bridge for a moment and then nodded.\n&quot;Lift off and send HYDRAS the coordinates to our landing point.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes sir.&quot; TORCA said as he turned to the others, &quot;Make it so.&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME took his seat, motioning for STRAIGHT SHOT and the others to\ntake seats as well. Meanwhile the ship began to rumble as it slowly\nbegan to move into the air.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
