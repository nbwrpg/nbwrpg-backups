He stood tall, \nrather than slumped with one leg sticking out in a painful position. For \nonce, his leg worked, and didn&#39;t hurt when he walked. It was healed. And by \nPrimus, it felt good.\n\n&quot;But boss,&quot; Quickstrike said, not truly ready to go anywhere. Primus, he \nforgot when he had last eaten and slept. He felt like he would passout right \nhere. His eyes looked battle fatigued, even with his repairs. &quot;---Mind if ah \nrestore mah internal energies?&quot; But then he asked, &quot;What vessel? Why me?&quot;\nMaximals, he thought.\n\n\n&gt;From: JP3884@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: bounty hunters for hire\n&gt;Date: Tue, 23 May 2000 12:14:53 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast, crouched behinde several scattered boulders with his troops\n&gt;fired his chain guns towrds Set and his minions :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine, the large and bulky turtle bot who seemed to be a natural at\n&gt;warfare, held a large gun that shot out missles. He also had two jade eye\n&gt;beams that spit out at Ra and Zues :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Jackle, Gremlin, and Transanulas just began the random assult, making\n&gt;random targets and taking the stress of the two main gunners, Marine and \n&gt;Hell\n&gt;Beast. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast ::: Once we get Set, I suspect his creations will make a \n&gt;hasty\n&gt;retreat.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine, in a gravely, gruff voice that seemed to say he had been a \n&gt;vetren\n&gt;in many wars, ::: I do agree Commander. We have the tactical advantage of\n&gt;outnumbering them and we know the valley much better. Besides, I do belive\n&gt;they are cowards.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast decided that not only the turtle bot was a warrior, but a\n&gt;skilled wiseman. Whatever ship this bot came out of, Hell Beast was glad to\n&gt;have him on his side. It seemd as though the trtle belived he was in a\n&gt;constant war, and he did have a unique respect for rank and order. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast ::: Yes Marine. Now, we&#39;ll need to get behinde them, once we\n&gt;split them apart, we will win.\n&gt;\n&gt;:::: Marine ::: But Commander, they used the same technique on us earlier \n&gt;in\n&gt;the forest. Im sure thats what they are attempting as we speak.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast ::: Ah, yes. Any suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine ::: Send Black Aracnia, Pheniox, and Gremlin to flank there\n&gt;position. They will attack from behinde while we assult from the front. No\n&gt;doubt there will be casualties though...\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast ::: Good thinking. We will contact Zardus as well...prehaps\n&gt;half of his team can help us here, and the other half can attack the\n&gt;Newcomers ship directly.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine took out a feild communicator designed to be used in heavey \n&gt;combat\n&gt;:::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine ::: Commander Zardus of the Allience, this is General Marine of\n&gt;the Predacon Empire. We request your assistance. I will send out the map of\n&gt;whats going on and where you should attack. I advise you split up your men\n&gt;and send half to help us, and the other half to attack the Newcomers ship.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: He then put it away and continued firing :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast noticed how Marine made himself General, and how he referred\n&gt;to the Predacons as the Predacon Empire. Truly he did have complete loyalty\n&gt;to the cause, and if he were born on Cybertron, he would have been a great\n&gt;transformer. Now, though, he was a fantastic general who would no doubt \n&gt;help\n&gt;the Predacons in there victories. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Set watched as the Turtle bot sent his message. He cursed and then \n&gt;tried\n&gt;to his his large green head. That warrior was single handedly crippling \n&gt;Set&#39;s\n&gt;campagin...he would have to get rid of Marine or convert him. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Ra ::: Master Set! Master Set! The transmission the Turtle bot just \n&gt;sent\n&gt;was to Zardus of the Allience!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Set ::: Damn! Tell Shuko to send out a dispatch to the Alliences base.\n&gt;We&#39;ll keep them busy there.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Ra ::: I dont think Master Shuko has any spare warriors!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Set ::: He is a smart Predacon, he wil lthink of something. Now, Zues,\n&gt;can you form Dark Messhia and crush these bugs ?!!!\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron watched as the fuzor listened to the battle outside :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron ::: Dont worry. Your all fixed up now.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: He pointed to a seat where Quickstrike was to sit. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron ::: We are only here for a short time. A coallition with Hell\n&gt;Beast. And as your commander, Im ordering you to accompany me to the\n&gt;Newcomers vessle. We will set up a small fortification there and monitor\n&gt;there communications and dispatches.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: He turned to leave ::: Get ready, we wil ldepart soon.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
