A \ncareer as Sub-Commander would do you well, yes.&quot;\n    He took his tail gun, and instead of hitting her with it, knighted her. \nIt was a silly thing to do but the moment felt right.\n\n    Tarantulas watched the two bots walk through the dark beneath him. He \nknew Quickstrike, they had many a good time back in the old war. As for the \nrodent, he didnt know. She must have gotten mixed up his clone. The bastard.\n    In his beast mode he slowly dropped, suspended from a cyberweb, and \ndangled in front of them. &quot;Aren&#39;t we punctual? Get into the Triangle room at \nthe end of the hall.
