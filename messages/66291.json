This rough nudge was \nall that was needed =\r\nto change the stasis pod&#39;s planned orbit and \nthrust it towards the inners =\r\nof the solar system.  \n\nAn object in motion stays in motion unless acted on=\r\n and this was the \ncase for the stasis pod as it drifted towards the inners=\r\n of the Solar \nSystem on a constant course until its path was caught by the=\r\n third&#39;s \nplanet&#39;s gravitational pull.  The pull was enough to cause the st=\r\nasis \npod to forgo its journey to the sun and instead to enter the precious=\r\n \natmosphere of the third planet.\n\nAs the pod came screaming down through t=\r\nhe atmosphere the metal \nstarted to heat up.  The once white metal started =\r\nto burn red as the \nstasis pod was quickly coming to the climax of its jour=\r\nney.  A trail \nof smoke could be seen by anyone that bothered to look up in=\r\nto the \nday sky.  The stasis pod finally came to rest in what was known as =\r\n\nMaine.  \n\nThe occupant of the stasis pod, who was in a stasis, woke with t=\r\nhe \nlanding of the pod.  The occupant took a quick breath as the internal \n=\r\nspeakers of the stasis pod declared,\n\n&quot;Acquiring Beast Mode.&quot;\n\nThe occupant=\r\n let out a blood curling scream as its body started to \nchange as it downlo=\r\nad the new mode.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
