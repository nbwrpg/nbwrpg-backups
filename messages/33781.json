Plus, there are factions that have 60 bots, but\n&gt; only 2 or so members (the NDE is an example of that), and this rule is\n&gt; trying to eliminate that, along with some other stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt; Its up to you whether you want to quit or not, of course, but its\n&gt; pretty childish to do that because you don&#39;t like a rule.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;*Orchid*&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Alloran has informed that a new rule in NBW is a limit of 16\n&gt; characters per member. I have 33 or 34 at the time being. I just can&#39;t\n&gt; part with some of my characters so I probably be parting with this\n&gt; RPG. I&#39;m still thinking it over but everything points to yes.
