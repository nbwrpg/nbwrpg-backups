Today was the final day, but three winners havn&#39;t been decided\n&gt; yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; The results of the last poll were:\n&gt; \n&gt; rAuq@... � � �4\n&gt; Rfa007@... � � 3\n&gt; Rudra656@... � �3\n&gt; KSLawdogg@... � �3\n&gt; Icedemon101@... 2\n&gt; TMRattrap@... � 4\n&gt; Alloran2@... � �3\n&gt; Kinger01030@... �2\n&gt; \n&gt; Quite a few of you are probably staring at the screen with jaws dropping\n&gt; about now. And yeah, I&#39;m surprised too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways, only two people made it onto the council for now (Megan and rAuq,\n&gt; you can stop worrying now). As you can all probably see, third place was a\n&gt; tie between Robo, Rudra, KSL, and Alloran. I put up a Council Election\n&gt; (Round 2) poll featuring those four people as the four options. This poll\n&gt; is only going to go on for 1 day, so everyone get your votes in\n&gt; quickly. Tomorrow evening we should have the third person elected, and\n&gt; then we can get on with all this.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first poll is still up, but if you try to vote at it, you&#39;ll get an\n&gt; error. That poll&#39;s been closed, its just there so people can view the\n&gt; results.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
