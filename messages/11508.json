Is that okay? Good.)\n\nBronco was going through the pods to find things that could e useful \nwhen rebuilding The Ark, when Fliq bursted in.\n\n&quot;Yahooooo!!!!!!!! It&#39;s been days and I&#39;m still obsessed with this new \nbeast mode. So watcha doin&#39;?&quot;\n\n&quot;Working. If you don&#39;t mind, you can help me find useful parts.&quot;\n\n&quot;Screw that! I&#39;ve got an idea, which will give us all the equipement \nwe need! Follow me!&quot;\n\nBronco follwed Octociz(Fliq! Gotta remember that now, he thought) to \nhis quarters, where he showed him the scamatics for his idea.\n\n&quot;Okay, look. This whole area is covered in debris that came off when \nThe Ark crashed. Nobody bothered to pick it up because it&#39;s debris. \nBut it&#39;s strong enough to stand the pressures of leaving and \nenetering atmospheres. So we gather it up. Hold that for a second. So \nnow we take two transport pods, and add extensions, and connectors, \nuntil it&#39;s one. Except it&#39;s got more room, can fit two people now, \nand has twice the engines, which can make it fast enough to reach the \natmosphere. Now we take the metal we collected, adn patch it on. Now \nit&#39;s strong enough to handle the burning. Now we can take her too the \nmoon, and collect useful items from the wreckage of our ship. That \nwas so huge, we could bring back stuff that would not only repar the \nArk, but make it bigger and better. It&#39;s going to be a bumby ride, \nbecause this metal is just barely strong enough by my readings, but I \nthink it should work. What do you say?&quot;\n\n&quot;Great! The stuff up there would make The Ark so strong. Let&#39;s go \ntalk it over with Spears.&quot;\n\nThe two bots set off to find Spears.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nVulois looked at Windrazor. This bot cannot be for peace?\n\n&quot;I will not except that. Go rage war on your own, if you must, but I  \nwill not be a part of it. If things get ugly, than I will decide how \nto handle it. But if you are here to attack The Alliance, than leave \nme, and do not return until you now what matters. What will it be?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
