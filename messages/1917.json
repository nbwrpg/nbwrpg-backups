He will explain it to \nyou.&quot; He says into his comm-link. He looks at Nemesis. &quot;Try not to kill them \nunless absolutely nessesary. We are allied with the predacons, and they could \ncome in handy.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDeathStorm lands near the alliance base, going inside.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m on my way.&quot; He says and heads off toward the bridge. He enters and walks \nup to Nemesis. &quot;Where are we going?&quot;\n\n"}}
