You and \nJP are doing computer stuff, and by just saying with out explanation makes it \nhard to reply to.  Not to mention, you&#39;re dealing with stuff that has no \nboundaries set upon.  There&#39;s no way to tell if Dark Mouse is better with \ncomps. than Tarantulas, but personally I think Tarantulas is probably of a \ngreater genius than Dark Mouse.\n\nBut anyway, Megatron&#39;s group wouldn&#39;t necessarily need a computer to flood \nplaces with dangerous gases.  He could also just shoot stuff in the engine \nroom and blow the whole ship up!  Just my two cents to confuse all of you \neven more, mwahahahahahahaha!  Seriously though, if you guys want to get \naround the entire mess, just skip the computers and battle it out.  I know \ntrying to find a week old post that you can&#39;t even remember is rather \nirritating)\n\n\nL. Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n"}}
