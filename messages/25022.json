Shards of metal cut into the Trainer leader but it&#39;s \nnothing his internal repairs couldn&#39;t handle. the other debris \nstrikes the shields causing it to flicker. Prebon fires five shots \nfrom his constrictor rifle at Godfather and another three at \nSharpedge.\n&gt; \n&gt; (A constrictor rifle fires beams of energy that wrap themselves \naround whatever they hit and squeeze until either the beam touches \nthe other side or id runs out of energy.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Alloran2@a... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@egroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, January 07, 2001 4:18 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Healing and Fighting\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   :::Starscream/Sharpedge/Godfather::: \n&gt; \n&gt;   ::Starscream reaches the base and walks in.
