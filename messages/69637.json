And while \nRodimus no longer clearly remembered all these ones=\r\n and what they had meant to \nhim, thier lessons were still ground into him,=\r\n and his reflexes that had been \nhoned over the years of battle! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Also, this was no \nyoung Hot Rod that stood there before =\r\nthem, but a figure shapped by the energy \nof the matrix into a character of=\r\n leadership, power and ability. He no longer \nhad access to the knowledge a=\r\nnd wisdom of the matrix, the energy having been \nstripped from him. But tha=\r\nt power that had been imparted was still there, \nreconfigured by the power =\r\nof the predacon shell program! He was faster, stronger \nand far more durabl=\r\ne then Hot Rod ever was, he was DARK RODIMUS!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; S=\r\no when Rodimus hit the wall it was not truely pain that he felt, \nbut the e=\r\nlation that a true battle was in the making. He felt that charge that \nall =\r\nwarriors felt when they faced a foe that had some metal! It was an eagernes=\r\ns \ntwisted by Predacon programming into something dark and loathsome. &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So when he stood and turned around it was not defea=\r\nt in his stance \nbut derision, &quot;So you fancy yourself to be a Prime do you,=\r\n scrappling?&quot; Rodimus \nsaid his tone still mocking as he raised his arm, sm=\r\niling as his optics glowing \nwith energy, &quot;Well let&#39;s see what you got!&quot; Wi=\r\nth a thought he fired a blast of \nplasma energy from his arm mounted cannon=\r\n at this new incarnation of Tuscon, who \nfor the moment appeared to be post=\r\nuring for Hydras!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nOOC: Remember, the matrix tha=\r\nt is housed within Rodimus has no energy of its \nown, only the housing. It =\r\ndoes not have the power to reach out and transform \nanyone, although I do h=\r\nave some ideas. I am not sure if you want to redo your \npost, or let it go =\r\nas it stands. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; (Cyclonus/S=\r\ncourge/&lt;WBR&gt;Dark rodimus)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end gr=\r\noup email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00AB_01CAB1BC.5A59E810--\r\n\n"}}
