Hate ta break it to ya but, you don&#39;t seem ta believe in him do\n&gt; you?  You think everything he inspires us to do is insane, but it&#39;s not.  We\n&gt; learn more about ourselves and we grow from these experiences.  But you\n&gt; don&#39;t seem ta want that ta happen.  Please, for Primus sake, give us a\n&gt; chance to learn from our experiences instead of sheltering us from them.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a look from LEO PRIME as he turned to regard STRAIGHT SHOT,\n&quot;Don&#39;t believe in him?&quot; he said with a cool tone. &quot;I am depending on\nwhat he started since it may be our only means of salvaging this\nmission.&quot;\n\nLEO glanced at LORD ELDER who only nodded to him encouragingly.\n\nHe looked back at RAT TRAP and STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;report to the docking\nbay.
