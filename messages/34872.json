The following is her\nwriting:\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n+++Element Galactors Cyndro+++\n\nElement jumped into the air, turned, and avoided a lot of missiles.\nMany shots riddled his armor but did barely any damage. He picked out\nthe largest robot on the battle field, which was Menasor, and ran at\nhim while he fired two missiles at the gestalt.\n\n\nThe Galactor jets both detected Megatron cowardly escaping into\nAstroblast, and headed for the Decepticon. They came to position\nbehind him and each launched two missiles at Astroblast. The\nVycir/Slasys jet was still cloaked.\n\n\nMissile after missile hit the Maximal City, and for the first time,\nCyndro felt the shields weaken by a precentage point. But the\nDecepticon achievement was short lived, because seconds later the\nCybertronian Fire&#39;s old shield generators were online, and Maximal\nCity&#39;s shield flared brighter than it was before and extended a bit.\nCyndro could see that a lot of bots were coming in for CR treatment,\nso he had lights turn on on the ground of the hallways to lead to the\nCR room.\n\n\n"}}
