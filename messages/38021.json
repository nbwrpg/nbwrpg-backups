They all transform, and\nto Havotrons furious screams, enter the ship. Hook looks around, &quot;All\nright Constructicons, let&#39;s go, and show the Autobots what this ships\ngot.&quot; as he leaps down, into the ship, followed by the rest. SLugslinger\nstands beside Soundwave, &quot;Dosent this remind you off the good ol days?,\nback to roaring around the Universe. Before we lost the war.&quot; \n\nApeface pushes Slugslinger as he climbs on, then pounds his chest, &quot;Yes,\nwe go to hunt.&quot; he yelled. Nightmare carried Jagged to the CR chambers. \n\nHook walked to the other constructicons, &quot;So, let&#39;s show em what this\nbabies got.&quot; He says, sitting down at the helm of the ship, in the\nnavagational area. Scrapper sits beside him, at the guidance system. He\nbegins to bark out orders. &quot;Mixmaster, activate the cloaking device.\nScavanger, use our radar system to keep a bead on the hidden one,\nBonecrusher, Lonhaul, get those weapon systems ready, to blow them outta\nthe sky.&quot; he says with dry emotion.\n\nHavotron sits in the throne. &quot;Soundwave, block all radio transmissions,\nso we arent detected, and happy hunting boys.&quot; \n\nAll Spinister did, was walk over to a window, and contemplativly look\ndown at the ground, as the rockets burst to life, sending flames licking\nthe launch pad with raw heat. He watched Cybertron become smaller, until\nit was gone. He whispered something, but nobody could make it out.\n\n"}}
