I do not like where we do not is going on,\n&gt; someone is playing things to another throng.  Something on this planet is\n&gt; amiss, and we&#39;ll have to find it out or end up smashed like a hiss.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE glanced over at the other DINOBOTS then, hoping that they were all\n&gt; powering down their weapons and they could figure out what had happened.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe DINOBOTS were not powering down thier weapons, but then again as\nthey were in beastmode, their weapons were their teeth and claws.\nHowever after a moment they did resume robot mode, and in this mode\ntheir weapons were not in evidence.\n\n&quot;Me Grimlock say somehting is wrong. Me Grimlock want to smash little\nDecepticon that did this to us!&quot; GRIMLOCK smashed his fist into his\nhand making a loud crunching sound.\n\nThe other DINOBOTS nodded as well, all looking to vent their anger on\nsomething, anything.\n\n&quot;Grimlock!&quot; BACKSTOP said as he approached. &quot;You have reverted back to\nnormal?&quot; He looked both surprised and relieved as he came up. He had\nbeen flying in robot mode using somehting like a jet back and now he\nwas landing nearby.\n\nGRIMLOCK nodded as he looked at BACKSTOP, &quot;You did this?&quot;\n\nBACKSTOP nodded, &quot;Yes, but it shouldn&#39;t have happened yet.&quot; He looked\nthoroughly confused.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
