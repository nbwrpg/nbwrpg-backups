He tilts his head. The beast side of him was curious in\n&gt;   seeing another beast like it, as they wern&#39;t common at all. Forgetting\n&gt;   about his &#39;orders&#39;, he walks off toward Iron Raptor, reaching her and\n&gt;   sniffing at her privates, much like a dog does to get to know another\n&gt;   dog.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; OOC: Hey Yan, your weight has nothing to do with how fast you\n&gt;   &gt; fall, it depends on how big you are (in other words, bigger=slower\n&gt;   &gt; due to air resistance) =P\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Yahoo!
