He takes another rifle, and his optics power up for optic \nblasts. He powers his boosters and flies up, clearing the trees and \nflying forward untill Scorponok was visible.\n\n&quot;Time to meet your maker, Predacon!&quot; Hunter yells as he flies \nforward. His shoulder cannons fire two signature-seeking missiles \neach at Scorponok, and both his rifles unleas a barrauge of laser \nshots, also aimed at Pred.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Scorponok starts to near the Island of london.
