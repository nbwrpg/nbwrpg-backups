He\nwas ammasing an army for a strike.\n\nMegatron and Bludgeon aproach a Cybertronian training Academy. &quot;Well,\nhere we are Megatron,&quot; Bludgeon says. &quot;Yes, and now we recruit,&quot;\nMegatron adds, holding up his newly configured cannon. He takes aim, and\nlets the awesome energy build up, and then rip a hole into the side of a\nlarge building. Bludgeon transforms, and enters, tearing the place apart\nwith his tank mode, filling the place with smoke. Megatron follows. \n\nOnce inside he holds up his cannon arm, &quot;Greetings Cybertronians, I am\nMegatron. Today I give anyone of you a chance to fullfill your training,\nand join me and the Decepticons.&quot; Megatron remembers, a commanding\nofficer stepped forward, and offered some kind of resistance. It lasted\nas long as it took for him to rip him in two with a blast from his\nFusion Cannon. The troops looked at him with fear, and all he could do\nwas smile.\n\n"}}
