He sensed a\n&gt; &gt; shadow hovering over him. &quot;Oh SH...&quot; his thoughts were cut off by a fist\n&gt; &gt; slamming down on his head forcing him to the ground. (This might be\nmoding\n&gt; &gt; but I think you&#39;ll like it.) The bums fist continued downward striking\nthe\n&gt; &gt; ground, Dogged still between the fist and the pavement. When the fist\nraised\n&gt; &gt; Doggeds crushed body lay with only it&#39;s feet fully intact and hanging\nout of\n&gt; &gt; the hole.
