He groaned, feeling like something was\n&gt; pushing him down. He had better days. He thought for a few seconds that he\n&gt; was under something. He may have been hit by something hard, because he\nfelt\n&gt; groggy.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked at the ground by his arm. There was a familiar scent to the air.\nA\n&gt; foul smell.\n&gt;\n&gt; He rapidly blinked his eyes, trying to focus his optic sensors. There were\n&gt; harsh lights mounted around certain parts of the area. The rocky ground\n&gt; below his metal body was a blue in color. There were pulsating sound\n&gt; near-by.\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Life&#39;s too short to send boring email.
