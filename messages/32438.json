He looks back behind himself, seeing\nthe NDE firing at the CF. Megatron had said not to lose anyone (I\nthink he said it. Either that or my brain&#39;s failing. If he never said\nit, then forget this sentece), and it looked like they were pretty\nclose to losing some of them.\n\nHe turns, flying at Starwind and firing his chain guns. Just a bit\nmore fun, and he would order the Decepticons out of there.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., icedemon101@h... wrote:\n&gt; Starwind/Angel Prime\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Starwind fired his front lasers cannons at Autofire.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Angel Prime:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I once was till I open the matrix. now I am Angel Prime.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
