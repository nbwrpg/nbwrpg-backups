She was in a dark room with grey\n&gt;   walls. She obviously did not recognize the place. In fact she hardly\n&gt;   remembered anything... except a burning mix of emotions towards\n&gt;   someone... Azure. Where was he now?\n&gt; \n&gt;   As she stood up in a prone position, a door slid open and a tall\n&gt;   robot, with huge weapons in his back, entered without saying a word.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Balistica: You&#39;re the one who had me repaired? Well, I guess I-\n&gt; \n&gt;   ???: You have three choices, Maximal. (He turned to face her) You see,\n&gt;   we are quite a xenophobic bunch here. We don&#39;t like Maximals. However,\n&gt;   we are disposed to let you join us as you are one of the Ancients.\n&gt;   Should you not wish to do this, you will have to join the Governmental\n&gt;   Army. There is no other option.\n&gt; \n&gt;   She was flabbergasted. She hadn&#39;t even said a word and she was being\n&gt;   stigmatized! Just what was going on?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Balistica: Huh... Just... Just who do you represent?\n&gt; \n&gt;   ???: I am from the Iron Skulls. We believe that the Maximals are going\n&gt;   to lead us astray. War is brewing, and survival means we must impose\n&gt;   our leadership.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Balistica: On second thought... I think I&#39;ll get into the army...\n&gt; \n&gt;   ???: As you wish... Someone will fetch you soon enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   SPONSORED LINKS Role playing games  Beast wars  Transformers g1  \n&gt;         Online role playing games  Role playing games online  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   YAHOO!
