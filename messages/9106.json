He walked to the exit checking the logs. Prowl was missing, \nStriker was at the Cybertronian Fire, Ramhorn was in critical \ncondition, Ramulus was checked out with Spears, and Kluster was at \nthe Fire too. This place was losing leaders like a cockroach loses \nshells. &quot;This is Lunarpine logging out for a while, I&#39;ll be back when \nit&#39;s time to be back.&quot; He transformed to wolf mode and began to run \noff. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Shadow Wing&#39; I&#39;m comeing back, I promised to \nprotect your spark, so I&#39;ll return for that promise.&quot; He thought, \nthis time making sure he wasn&#39;t speaking out loud.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Out of the engine room walked the Grey and White bot, Lunarpine \nwent \n&gt; to check on Ramhorn, still in the stasis pod looking dead, &quot;I \n&gt; should&#39;ve been here sooner my friend, can you forgive me for my \n&gt; mistake?&quot; the bot in the CR chamber didn&#39;t move. &quot;If you can hear \nme, \n&gt; speak up, yell at me, climb out and hit me, just show me you&#39;ll be \n&gt; alright.&quot; Again it didn&#39;t move. &quot;Damn it Ramhorn, Damn it all to \nthe \n&gt; pit, do something.&quot; Lunarpine punched the wall near the CR chamber, \n&gt; turns and walks out of the room with his head held low.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She perched high up in a tree.  She looked out and saw the \n&gt; expansion \n&gt; &gt; of the forest open up in front of her.  She wondered how she and \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine would ever make things work.  One minute, they were \n&gt; &gt; laughing and having fun.  And the next, trying to bite each \nother&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; heads off.  She knew that in the wild, wolves and owls mated for \n&gt; &gt; life.  But how one Cybertron would she make things work for her \nand \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine, she had no idea.  She looked and saw the clouds moving \n&gt; &gt; quickly across the sky.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She looked down and saw a rabbit hopping long the forest floor.\n&gt; &gt; She shook her head, she wasn&#39;t in the mood to hunt. She knew \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine needed to be in the company of other wolves.  She too, \n&gt; &gt; longed for the company of other owls.  She was willing to give \nthat \n&gt; &gt; up for him.  But she knew that he would never give up being a \nwolf \n&gt; &gt; for her.  She would have to learn to just accept things as they \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; not what she wished they would be.  She felt, somewhere in her \n&gt; spark, \n&gt; &gt; that someday she might have to give up and let her wild wolf go \n&gt; free.\n&gt; &gt; She somehow knew that that day would eventually come.  She let a \n&gt; tear \n&gt; &gt; roll off her cheek and down her beak.  &quot;Wolves belong in the wild \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; need to be free. If need be, I&#39;ll give you that freedom \nLunarpine.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; she said to herself.\n\n\n"}}
