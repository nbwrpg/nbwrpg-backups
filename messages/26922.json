He \nswears as a missile hits him, sending him out of control and badly \ndenting his war suit. When he regains balance underwater, one of his \nmissile launchers was no longer functional.\n\nSlayer aims the other missile launcher at the door to the tunnel that \nPrebon had been taken two, firing two missiles.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; OOC:is it legal that every bot shot 25 times in the same post?\n&gt; \n&gt; Luzbel/Attila/Kali/Shiva/Bat-probes/Black fortress&#39;s defences::\n&gt; \n&gt; Luzbel and Attila avoided the shot and shot against Iguanus (25 \n&gt; shots) while Kali and Shivah did the same against Slayer (two of \nthem \n&gt; are missile-signatures, 25 hots)\n&gt; \n&gt; Bat-probes and Fortress did the same.\n\n\n"}}
