Afte=\r\nr all, he did get an idea of his stormy like temper before they got separat=\r\ned .  It would be interesting to have a battle between Magmatron and Tucson=\r\n, as a challenge to preserve the land from further harm.  One on one, in an=\r\n honorable battle, in warrior mode of course.  And the one who remains on h=\r\nis feet, wins the freedom of the land and it&#39;s inhabitants.  He who loses, =\r\nmust retreat honorably and give up the opposition he so desperately fights =\r\nfor.  It would be an ultimate test of Honor and courage for Tucson, who mus=\r\nt realize that sometimes doing the right thing is to anticipate defeat and =\r\nlearn from that in order to avoid it the next time one faces a formidable e=\r\nnemy.  It&#39;s a lesson no mentor can teach him, it&#39;s a lesson he needs to lea=\r\nrn on his own.  \n\nI think it&#39;s a good plot seeing that for a bot, he has a =\r\nlot of backbone and unlike Rodimus, perhaps just a little too much of it.  =\r\nIt goes with having his father&#39;s temperament and stubbornness.  That too is=\r\n turning out to be a challenge for him, because Ratchet may have been the c=\r\nhief CMO, but never a Prime.  Tucson, who is very much like Ratchet, is a P=\r\nrime who is having to work with temperament issues as well as the issues im=\r\npacting everyone else.\n\nWhen Rodimus started sassing the Preds while on Tuc=\r\nson&#39;s back, Tucson was trying desperately to form an alliance and was not i=\r\nn the mood for snide commentary.  His reaction was similar to how Ratchet m=\r\night have commented on it.  Good thing Rodimus didn&#39;t get the classic &quot; Giv=\r\ne me one good reason why I shouldn&#39;t reformat your hard drive and turn you =\r\ninto a garbage scow!&quot;\nBut when Tucson lost his temper Rodimus may have pick=\r\ned up on his voice pattern which sounds EXACTLY like Ratchet when he lost h=\r\nis temper.  I don&#39;t recall Rodimus&#39;s relationship with Ratchet but he could=\r\n probably get an idea that Tucson is from the same mold as the old CMO.\n\nPe=\r\nrpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Sep 18, 2011, at 7:13 AM, S=\r\nuper Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Good, wonderful, excellen=\r\nt!

I could see the ground thing=\r\n in that&lt;br&gt;much like a loud sound could rattle your chest, like at a consc=\r\nert and&lt;br&gt;you can feel the beat in your chest. But what do you mean by fla=\r\nshes&lt;br&gt;of lightning?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Just making sure I have a clear understanding=\r\n before I have a clear&lt;br&gt;understanding. Tuscon&#39;s sonic roar could be as lo=\r\nud as thunder and&lt;br&gt;even perhaps sound like it, but would not be thunder i=\r\nn the sense of&lt;br&gt;\nbeing part of the weather patterns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For instance =\r\nnearby thunder can range as loud as 120 Db. For&lt;br&gt;references: This is roug=\r\nhly the equivalent to being within 200 feet of&lt;br&gt;a jet aircraft during tak=\r\ne-off or about 3 feet from an auto horn. A&lt;br&gt;\nchain saw is rated around 10=\r\n0 decibels. A sound of 140 decibels is&lt;br&gt;painfully loud. [Note each 10 dec=\r\nibel increase in noise level seems&lt;br&gt;twice as loud.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would imagin=\r\ne that Tuscon is probrably like Brawl in this matter,&lt;br&gt;\nbut more effectiv=\r\ne in its use, meaning he can hit at almost 300 Db if&lt;br&gt;conscentrated into =\r\na blast, probrably 200 in a cone and 150 in a wave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;300 (BEAM) can b=\r\nlow out metal and concrete and such like. Basically as&lt;br&gt;\npowerful as any =\r\nblast Megatron, Gavatron, Optimus Prime, Rodimus or&lt;br&gt;any other leader typ=\r\ne can deliver. It is just created from Sonic&lt;br&gt;energies rather than more c=\r\nonventional energies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;200 (CONE) Could concievably kill a human and =\r\nprobrably cause serious&lt;br&gt;\ndamage on some of the sensative inner workings =\r\nof a transformer. Could&lt;br&gt;do things like blow out glass and other unprotec=\r\nted crystalized&lt;br&gt;materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;150 (CIRCLE) Painfully loud and POSSIB=\r\nLY stunning affects.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Here is a list of Db counts. I cannot say I wo=\r\nuld follow it&lt;br&gt;religiously, since this is a Scifi settings and the transf=\r\normers are&lt;br&gt;not human, but it would give you an idea and could spark crea=\r\ntivity.&lt;br&gt;However some things may not work exactly as planned. So if you a=\r\nre&lt;br&gt;\ngoing to try something special, PLEASE talk it over with me first.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.makeitlouder.com/Decibel%20Level%20Chart.txt&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.makeitlouder.com/Decibel%20Level=\r\n%20Chart.txt&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.makeitlouder.com/Deci=\r\nbel%20Level%20Chart.txt&quot;&gt;http://www.makeitlouder.com/Decibel%20Level%20Char=\r\nt.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;I hope all this gives food for thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Pres=\r\nton&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 9/17/11, Sandy Panico &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz%40yah=\r\noo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@...&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@...&quot;&gt;magicquartz@...=\r\nm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps just the lightning flashes would suff=\r\nice.
