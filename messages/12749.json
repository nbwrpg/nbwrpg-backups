After his small tour, he went to a room wher=\r\ne he could do his work in peace.  He saw a desk, and went over to it, he sa=\r\nt down in the chair, which had wheels, so he could easily slide back and fo=\r\nrth to get parts from another area.  This was so totally the life!!!!!  Him=\r\n, sitting in his own quiet area, where he could do his job.  Wheeljack turn=\r\ned on the desklamp, and then slid over in his chair to a table, and rummage=\r\nd through a box full ofjunk, bits and pieces of things he had collected on =\r\nhis travels to find the Alliance base.  He grabbed some stuff, and then whe=\r\neled back to his desk.  He put the parts under the desklamp, and started ma=\r\nking something with them.\n\n         &quot;Ah, this will be a great weapon for th=\r\ne Alliance once everyone has one, but for now, I am just making the very fi=\r\nrst!&quot; Wheeljack said, as he screwed around with the junk.\n\n          An hou=\r\nr and a half later, Wheeljack had made a gun.  The gun was white and black,=\r\n the barrel was long and slender.  But, he still needed something.  He had =\r\nto get a special kind of ammunition for it, a special energy.  He walked do=\r\nwn to the lab, and started looking around to see if he could find what he n=\r\needed.\n\n        &quot;La dee da dee dum da dum-oh!  There we go!!!!&quot; Wheeljack s=\r\naid, as he grabbed some pinkish-reddish liquid.  Then he walked down back t=\r\no his little workshop.  He grabbed a funny looking device, which was giving=\r\n off electricity.  He took a small portion of the liquid and put it in a te=\r\nst tube.  Then he grabbed the strange device, and used it on the liquid in =\r\nthe test tube.  The liquid started to go all strange, and then Wheeljack pr=\r\nessed a button on his device, and the liquid was now pinkish-reddish energy=\r\n!!!  The button he pressed stopped the energy from making a short explosion=\r\n.  Yes, it worked!!!  Now he took the other liquid that was left, and put i=\r\nt into the gun.  He did the same thing with the liquid in the gun, he grabb=\r\ned his device and did his stuff.  \n\n          &quot;Yes!!!!  Yes!!!!!!!!  I pres=\r\nent to you, my newest weapon, the one and only, the Inflator!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!=\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Wheeljack screamed to himself, maniacly.  He stopped, and then=\r\n took the Inflator.  Now he had to test it and make sure it really worked. =\r\n He took a balloon, but it wasn&#39;t blown up.  He took a clothespin and put i=\r\nt on the part where you would normally blow air into it.  Then, he shot the=\r\n inflator multiple times at the balloon.  It was growing!!!!  It was growin=\r\ng!!!!  Each shot from the inflator inflated the balloon!  Now, bots had som=\r\nething to either fear or laugh at.  Wheeljack had also added a secondary fi=\r\nring mode to the gun, which would instantly inflate something until it was =\r\nnear the point where it would pop.  He was proud of his new invention, but,=\r\n he now had two things to worry about, one minor, one major.  The minor was=\r\n, getting this weapon to use by his comrades, the major was, Maximals or Pr=\r\nedacons stealing his idea!!!  Although, stealing his idea would not be like=\r\n taking blueprints from a factory, they would have to have the requirements=\r\n and experience.  No one was as good as him!!!!!!!!!  He took the gun and l=\r\nooked for Zardus outside the base.\n\n               &quot;Hey, hey Zardus!!!!!!  =\r\nI have a new gun created called the inflator!!  I was wondering if I could =\r\nhave someone make some copies of it for all the other members!&quot; Wheeljack s=\r\naid, running towards Zardus, feeling proud while holding his invention.\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0007_01C00BFF.36786600\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html;
