A \nloud rumbling is coming from the water. At first it is just a noise, \nbut than the water starts to buble, and steam rises from it. Than in \na huge explosion, a cylinder of water shoots up into the sky. It \nreaches up to the cliff. A large bot stood upon it, and walked onto \nthe cliff. It smiled with an evil grin, and lauhged out loud.\n\n\n\n&quot;Yes! Finaly, after eons of time, I have returned! Now I have a body \nwitout another Spark inside it. Now I can begin my reign of \ndestruction, as a new and improved Predacon! But whose body did I \ntake? By some leftover memory files, it belonged to a Maximal. A \nMaximal named Octociz. No matter. It has been clensed of Maximal \nflith, now that I inhabit it. Now I must find the Predacons. There \nwill be no more trying to win over rule now. The last time I tried, I \nbecame Emperor just before my body was destroyed. So now I...&quot;\n\nThe Predacon fell over in pain. New body parts started springing up \nall over the place. When the pain stopped, the bot stood up.\n\n&quot;My Spark...it had become to strong to enhabit  a normal body. I \nhave...thre forms now. Bot, Octocpus and Jet! A jet, good. It reminds \nme of the Great War. Now, my sensors detect a cave filled with \nPredacons. This must be the base. I will go there, and start at the \nbottom of the ladder. For now that I may travel at land, at sea and \nat air vey well, no enemy is safe from me. I, Starscream, shall \ndestroy the Maximals!!!!!&quot;\n\nStarscream transformed to Jet mode and took of towards the Predacon \ncave.\n\n\n"}}
