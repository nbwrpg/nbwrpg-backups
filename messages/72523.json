TALK ABOUT A PERPETUAL PEST!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n He then looks to Leo Prime.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Sorry for the outburst, Sir but Din=\r\nobot&#39;s conduct is pushing my buttons the wrong way.   I heard the whole thi=\r\nng and he&#39;s the one who started on Rattrap.  Straight Shot spoke up because=\r\n she&#39;s sticking up for him, and personally, I don&#39;t blame her.  She would n=\r\not have acted defensively if she had not been harassed.  &quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There=\r\n was a snorted laugh from DINOBOT, &quot;Oh, pick on her?

Is that how you Maximals are?  My faction right=\r\n or wrong?  No wonder you have left Cybertron in such a wretched state, for=\r\n your own blindness to everything, and regardless of circumstances your tot=\r\nal blame of every event upon another and a denial fo your own responsibilit=\r\ny.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; DINOBOT&#39;s sneer continuing, but still no making threatening moves.=\r\n  &quot;Does the Rodent still enjoy shooting his friends in the back and taking =\r\nhis gun so he can take their personal belongings?&quot;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
