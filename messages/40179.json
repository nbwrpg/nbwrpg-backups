A moment later the right head of Gemini Dragon \nunleashed four fireballs at Windlord as the left head unleashed a \nfreeze beam at Unitron once again.

Still back inside the room begins to pulsate, \nBlacknightmare would be able to feel her body beggining to heat up as \nthe Chaochitan energy built up all within it. If she did not decide \non an answer soon the room would be so full of it it would kill her.\n\nMisfire: &quot;Your answer now.

And \ncurrently the \n&gt; Alliance Island is under attack by a single robot named Chaostaur, \nowned by \n&gt; Rudra, but Punch is firing several autoguns on him and I am humbly \nwaiting a \n&gt; response)\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave/Unitron/Sixshot/Firestarter:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave did some basic and advanced maneuvers, and there were \njust to many \n&gt; shots as a dozen blasted a gaping hole in his right wing, which a \nfew seconds \n&gt; later was ripped off by the wind.  He reverted to biped mode and \ninstantly \n&gt; transformed to his ray gun mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; As big as he was originally, this massive weapon bears upon \nWindlord, firing \n&gt; off a powerful blast of gamma rays.  The Emperor reverted back to \nrobot mode, \n&gt; missile launcher in his single hand, his energy resources \ntemporarily drained \n&gt; from the demanding shot.\n&gt; \n&gt; More down towards the ground was Unitron, in his tank mode, not \nfairing to \n&gt; well.  Going at his full speed, he was able to dodge both missiles \nand all \n&gt; but two shots from Aerotaur, but the ice blast from Gemini struck \none of the \n&gt; extensive armor plates that protected his treads, and a fusion \nblast tore \n&gt; through the now greatly weakened armor there, blasting through the \ntreads.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron came to a dead halt, the Deceptcion warrior in great pain.  \nHe \n&gt; swerved his turret, firing off two explosive shells from his large \ncannon at \n&gt; the Maximal tank that had struck him, getting ready to go to an \nalternate \n&gt; mode.  The mounted machine gun on his turret swivelled and fired \noff ten \n&gt; rapid laser bolts at the Gemini who had shot at him. \n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, back in the air, the only STAG in existance easily \ndodged the six \n&gt; shots fired at him, coincidentally his name being Sixshot.  He \narmed a pair \n&gt; of missiles, launching them both, each splitting apart, one heading \nfor \n&gt; Cledar and the other at Blyer.\n&gt; \n&gt; And still in the air, for now, was Firestarter, third oldest among \nthe \n&gt; current Decepticons present at the battle.  His scanners detected \nsomeone \n&gt; getting a lock on him and two incoming objects, so he barrel \nrolled, each \n&gt; missile going by but the explosions from the shock wave rattled him \na little, \n&gt; a piece of shrapnel smashing a small hole through his cockpit and \nstabbing \n&gt; into the empty seat.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lousy Autobots.&quot; he cursed, bringing his laser weaponry to full \nand \n&gt; launching off twenty rapid laser bolts down at Hot Rod.\n\n\n"}}
