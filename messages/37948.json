Since you are infiltrating the \nMaximal Base, \n&gt; we need to give you a foolproof disguise, not just external, but \ninternal as \n&gt; well.  Im going to have to disguise your energy signature so the \nbase&#39;s \n&gt; scanners detect you as a Maximal.  We will also need to give you \nmore Maximal \n&gt; appearance, and giving you an alias wouldn&#39;t hurt.  Do you agree to \nall of \n&gt; this?\n\n\n"}}
