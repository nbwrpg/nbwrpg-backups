It was Lunarpine.  She didn&#39;t \nwant to answer it.  She knew he could fight this pred who was after \nher.  But she wanted to prove that she could make it. She not only \nwanted to prove it to him, but to herself as well.  She opened her \ncomm link. &quot;I have a Pred on my tail feathers, but I think I lost \nhim.&quot; She looked about and still didn&#39;t see the Pred. &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t \nsee him so I guess I lost him.&quot; She sighed. She liked hearing his \nvoice, but she still didn&#39;t want to face him.  She knew she would \nhave to, but she wanted to hold off on that as long as possable.\n&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; She closed her comm link and flew off to the west again.  \nshe rose into the sky to get a good look around.  She used her \ntelescopic vision and didn&#39;t see the Pred.  She flew closer to the \nground.  She knew that when she used her comm link, that she could be \ntraced.  She had to keep moving.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; The wolf opens a direct link to Shadow Wing on his comm &quot;SHADOW \nWING, \n&gt; Answer me fraggit,Are you in trouble?&quot; His comm remained silent for \n&gt; the moment, if she&#39;d only open a link he could trace it.(What is \n&gt; Shadow Wings function, you didn&#39;t put it on her character page.)\n\n\n\n"}}
