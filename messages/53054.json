And \n&gt; they&#39;re far more open-minded to boot.  Not to mention our guest here \n&gt; is a Maximal himself.&quot;  He leaves unsaid the fact that he considers \n&gt; Yggdrasil as little more than a bargaining chip at the moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil didn&#39;t like democracies, especially in combat units.

The way they land,\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;re experienced. It does remind me of Pred style, but it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; different too.

Computer, replay visual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the arrival of the newest ship.&quot;  A holo-field pops up, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; displaying the Tripredacus cruiser as it came in for a landing \n&gt; some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time ago.

We&#39;ve got business to discuss.&quot;  He heads out of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; room, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beckoning Yggdrasil and Jayde to follow him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil came up near Devilcat and looked at the data \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; displayed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: That is a new ship design. Seems like a \n&gt; warship \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since it&#39;s new, they might well have lots more where \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; come \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That means they&#39;re not alone. As for personel, I can&#39;t \n&gt; say \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fought Tripreds. But they might be elite, or they might \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; green\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rookies that have been placed there to man the ship. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rookies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could not have landed the ship as successfully as they \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is something else. The survivors of the first group \n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to observe things here and I am convinced that they \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence on most people here. The newcomers now \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edge. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frontal assault is totally out of question.\n\n\n"}}
