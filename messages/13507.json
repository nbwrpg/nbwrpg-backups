Don&#39;t let him know you&#39;re afraid of \nhim.&quot; Sky Knight said to the female Predacon of the scientist team. \nShe stood a meter away from the huge clone, Beserk. He had even \ndwarfed the largest member of their team. He had a gray face, exactly \nidentical to Megatron&#39;s. He had huge, broad shoulders, covered with \ntan fur-like faberic that went down to the center of his chest. His \narms, hands, and legs were pitch black. His fingers were armed with \nrazor sharp claws. He held a ferocious face while studying Techy.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not afraid,&quot; she mumbled, keeping her eyes on Beserk. \n\n&quot;Remember, he&#39;s a killer.&quot; Sky Knight added.\n\nBeserk snarled as she took a step forward. It was a breathy, almost \nanimalistic snarl. He took a step to the side, with his feet spread. \nShe took her movements as a threat. \n\n&quot;Wait a cycle, back up.&quot; SkyKnight said. &quot;This isn&#39;t working.&quot;\n\nShe did as he said, inches from the plexi-glass of Beserk&#39;s cell. She \nwatched him; he began to calm, but kept his optics on Techy.\n\nThere was a long pause. They both watched Beserk. He stood on guard, \nturning his head left and right to look at the two scientists. They \nwere not his creators. They were not there to give him orders on his \nnext mission, so that meant they were enemy.\n\n&quot;I got an idea,&quot; Techy said. She walked back up to Beserk, who \nimmediately snarled. &quot;Beserk.&quot; She withdrew a hand-sized devise and \nheld it up. Beserk froze. Ever since they had brought him back on-\nline they had to install a shock collar in him to be safe. &quot;Sit \ndown.&quot; she said. \n\nHe did nothing, just stood in defense. \n\n&quot;Look.&quot; She threw the devise across the room. Beserk watched \nclosely. &quot;Sit, like this.&quot; She sat down on the floor. Beserk studied \nher, blinking at her. &quot;Come on.&quot;\n\nWith some confused hesitation, Beserk sat down on the floor with \nher. &quot;See? Good.&quot; she remarked. &quot;Now, what&#39;s your name?&quot;\n\nBeserk just blinked.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m Techy,&quot; she said pointing to herself. &quot;And that&#39;s Sky Knight.&quot; \nShe pointed to the red and orange male leaning against the plex-glass \nwindow. He waved lightly at Beserk. Techy turned back to Beserk. &quot;And \nyou are?&quot; pointing to him.\n\nThere was nothing. He continued to stare at her. &quot;Techy,&quot; she said, \npointing again to herself. She pointed back to Beserk.\n\n&quot;Beserk,&quot; he said, and jumped. He blinked in surprise. Techy couldn&#39;t \nhelp but to laugh. He had jumped out of surprise of his own voice. He \nsounded identical to Megatron. \n\n&quot;Good, now we know each other,&quot; she said. He smiled and leaned \nforward.\n\n&quot;Where are my masters?&quot; he asked slowly.\n\n&quot;Your masters are under arrest.&quot; she said. &quot;It was illegal on what \nthey made you do. And it was actually illegal to build you. You&#39;re a \nclone, Beserk. You are a clone of Megatron, a Predacon leader. You \nwere a drone.&quot; Beserk looked down. It was no doubt that he \nremembered. &quot;You&#39;re no longer a drone, now. We gave you a brain. But \nsome of your old programing still remains. We want to help you to \nbecome another bot.&quot; He looked at her.\n\n\n"}}
