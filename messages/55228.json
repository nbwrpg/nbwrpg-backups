He fell to the ground and snarled. He pulle dout his \ndouble guns from his back. One at each for and fired, he then saw Kit Kat in \nthe distance.\n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She made it to the entrance and was about to collapse. She rested \n&gt; against the wall next to the main entrance and searched for the \n&gt; strength to get up.  She hauled herself up and went out the entrance. \n&gt; She stopped at the small closet compartment just on the inside of the \n&gt; doorway and grabbed an emergency ration of energon.  She tucked it in \n&gt; her shoulder compartment and went back to the battle grounds. \n&gt; \n&gt; It took her a while, but she finally made it. Her internal life meter \n&gt; was showing her power levels at 40%.  She groaned and continued on. \n&gt; She made her way to the battle field. She stopped as she found the \n&gt; scent of Windlord. She smelled the air. Even in bot mode, her sences \n&gt; of hearing and smell were still very keen.  She followed the smell. \n&gt; She could also smell three other bots with that one. She did not know \n&gt; what she would find, but she would be willing to take it on. She drew \n&gt; her pistol and followed her nose. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
