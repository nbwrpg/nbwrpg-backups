Just like, pretend you followed us or\nsomething, if you want... :)\n\nBIC: \n\nTails lifted the slippery fish with her paws, trying\nto get a hold on the wriggling body.\nIt flipped out and landed on the ground, flopping.\nTails wrinkled her nose delicately, and jumped on it,\ntrying to stop it from going any further.\nBut the fish flopped out of her reach...\nThe squirrel let out a sound that resembled a cross\nbetween a growl and a squeak.\n&quot;MAXIMIZE!&quot; She said suddenly, transforming.\nTails glanced at her &quot;hand&quot;, and realized it was a\ncannon of sorts that came out between her &quot;fingers&quot;.\nShe shot it, aiming at the fish. The blast hit a tree\nsomewhere far, far away from the fish&#39;s direction, and\nthe shock caused Tails to fly backwards and hit the\nground.\nShe glared at the still-flopping fish with increasing\nvengeance.\n&quot;Er, maybe I&#39;m not as hungry as I thought..&quot; She\ncalled out to Goldeneye.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nKick off your party with Yahoo!
