He had no idea \nthe peril he was in.\n\n&quot;Thank you for your support, Spears, but I can handle this. Striker, \nI really would&#39;nt be doing this if I were you. YHou are in alot of \ntrouble. Ramulus willl come if I tell him to. Especially when I \nthreaten yours and Sprears life. But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll get to go \nfree once I meet with him. I&#39;ll even have your memory wiped. Even the \nmemories of loving Spears, so you can forget about her. Now, I will \nshow you that insolence is not tolerated!&quot;\n\nPrebon closed the hole and sent a comm to Hammer.\n\n&quot;Activate Torture guns.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure thing, boss.&quot;\n\nInside the cell two plasma cannons came out of panels and aimed at \nStriker.\n\n&quot;Kepp firing until he is dead or says mercy.&quot;\n\nThe guns opened fire.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix looked at the group.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve got a plan. It&#39;ll take some time, though. We&#39;ve brought back \nmajor computer boards. This is like our day stuff. Top notch. We \ncould use this new computer to scan around their base, for ways to \nattack. Who&#39;s in?&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream sat in one of the chairs. The smell of mech fluid excited \nhim. He made a mental note not to double-cross Zardus.\n\n&quot;Alright. I&#39;m here to tell you that you are all in very big trouble. \nMegatron is not lost. He&#39;s just gone out of social view for the time \nbeing. He&#39;s working on something big. He&#39;s trying to unite the two \nPred factions into one under his rule. Rumour has it he&#39;s been \nworking with some Vok people, old Predacons revived. I don&#39;t know \ntheir names. All I know is that if Megatron&#39;s plan goes through, \nwe&#39;re all doomed. Now, I;m a part of the faction that is technically \nMegatron&#39;s, even though both are basically his. After repeateds by \nMaximals that left us baseless, members fleeing and two membres near \ndeath, I gave a mutiny speech. Have our group leave Megatron, ally \nwith you and help you in anyway we can. It wen&#39;t over well with some, \nbut not Phobia, who is acting as our leader. He chose to go to Hell \nBeast&#39;s old base. Now, it&#39;s closer than this is. So maybe he&#39;s only \nconcerned about getting our people to CR Chambers. Or maybe he&#39;s in \non Megatron&#39;s plot. I couldn&#39;t decide, but I couldn&#39;t take the risk, \nso i fought for the position to come here. I thought if I went to the \nPred base that Phobia would rat me out and that I would die in the CR \nChamber. I will have to have a talk with Phobia. Speaking of CR \nChambers, could I use one? I&#39;m pretty banged up here. So, you&#39;ve been \nwarned Zardus. What will you do?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
