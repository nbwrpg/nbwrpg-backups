Veratis smiled \nas he looked in at the latest addition to thier group.\n\nRazor Claw called for Ice to come closer. &quot;I heard your name during \nthe fight, Ice, It suits you well.&quot; he stared out at the prototype \nfor his kind and smiled. \n\n(Got to go, Dinners in an hour and I have Potatos to finish.)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; (Yeah you did.

She was \nfeeling \n&gt; drained, but didn&#39;t want to take any riskes untill Veratis had one \n&gt; him over. She was starting to sweat under her fur.
