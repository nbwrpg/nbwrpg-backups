This \ntime the person who was there with him was Zardus again.\n\n&quot;Glad to see you woke up. How was life on the outside?&quot;\n\n&quot;It was horrible! I was fighting Battera and Cybershark, and I \nremembered none of this!&quot;\n\n&quot;Ah, it seems that we have......&quot;\n\nSuddenly Zardus began to shake, and divide. But not into other \nZardus&#39;, different people. More and more they came, until there were \nsome on his left and some on his right.\n\nHe looked around and knew what he saw. On his left, was the entire \nAlliance. On his right, were the people who had an inlfuence on his \nreal life. Cybershark, Soundwave, Terminess, Child, The Sky \nSchorchers, HeraldAngel, AngelNemesis, Deemos, and even Hell Beast. \nBut no Battera. Than he realized it. She must be downloading the \npast! She can not exist in the dream when she really is in it. She \nmust be somewhere in his mind. Suddenly, the two sides started \nfighting each other. The Alliance programming was trying to keep the \nreal truth down. But this might end in a draw. The two programs could \ncancel each other out killing him, and anyone in his mind at the \ntime, meaning Battera. But if Battera left, the real truth would \ncollapse and the Alliance would assert intself again. He needed to \nfind her, but he was chained. He could not go anywhere. He called out \nfor her as the battle raged.\n\n&quot;BATTERA! Come quickly!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
