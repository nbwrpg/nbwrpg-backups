He \n&gt;&gt; stood\n&gt;&gt; up and headed towards the Area where Cyclonus was.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus is in the security station when Hydras has arrived. This room\n&gt; like the others in the station looked new and improved. The stations\n&gt; were fitted with computer stationsd capable of linking in to nearly\n&gt; any other station in the base as well as to any camera or minoring\n&gt; device that was connected to it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus was standing in the center of the room at the main station\n&gt; his optic focused on the screen when the doors recognized Hydras&#39;\n&gt; entry code and allowed him to enter.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Can you track the surce of the comlink that Jhiaxus recived?&quot; hissed \n&gt;&gt; when\n&gt;&gt; he arrived to the place where Cyclonus was\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus nodded his head as he was already at work on the project. It\n&gt; took him only a few moments to come up with the answer, and answer\n&gt; that he knew at the pit of his energon pump Hydras wouldn&#39;t like.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sir.&quot; he said, his voice low and formal, &quot;It would appear that the\n&gt; communications were coming from the Pentatron, the mining city, the\n&gt; same place that you sent Sky Shadow, Iguanus and Fractyl.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Cyclonus spoke a small hologram of the city appeared, showing the\n&gt; communication calls comming from somewhere in the city, although it\n&gt; was unable to isolate an exact location.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
