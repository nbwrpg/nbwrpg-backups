That was just a random comment stimulated by my desire \nto run a sharp blade through the Arizona Opera Productor&#39;s head.\n\nI see nothing wrong with the post, Ryo, except for how would you get \nice spikes in Saudi Arabia?\n\n::Zardus/WarMachine/Bloodystrike/Reptilica/DevilDuer::\n\nWarMachine roars, his scanners locking on to Koj&#39;s signature, even \nthough it was a shaky lock due to the cloaking device. Running at him \nand Inu, WarMachine approaches from behind, firing missiles at the \ntwo.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Shields, reactivate!&quot; Zardus orders, seeing the trees flying at the \nAlliance base. Jumping back as the shields reactivate, Zardus, along \nwith the autoguns, fires at the trees that manage to get through, ice \nand wood chunks showering him, but nothing major. He takes a step \nback to keep his balance.\n\nBehind him, Reptilica gives a pained yelp as he is hit by a large \nwood piece, sending him falling backwards into the Alliance base. \nBloodystrike ducks behind the door as he sees the wood flying at him, \nevading it and watching some of it land on Reptilica. He ducks his \nhead out of the doorway, firing at Inu.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer looks up into the vent, watching Diamond slither away. He \nwas kinda glad she had joined, or else Vamprah might have gotten \naway. A tasmanian devil wasn&#39;t really made for vent exploration.\n\nDevilDuer picks up the datapad and looks at it, wondering who \nDarkFate was.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
