That&#39;s how we \n&gt; know about the energon remember.  I also know about the underground \n&gt; river with an opening about 200 ft. long and 50 ft. wide.  And I \nalso \n&gt; have the status of the engine.  Not so bad.  2 of the 3 thrusters \nwill \n&gt; never run again, but I can turn them into automated cannons to \ndefend \n&gt; this cave and the other one can be used to turn this shuttle into a \n&gt; submarine.  That river is wide enough to travel all the way out into \n&gt; the ocean.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rhesus begins detaching the first of the thrusters/cannons.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The arrive and Rhesus begins tinkering with the engine.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The shuttle continues to plumet.

A brown \n&gt; horse, \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; grey horse, and a Rhesus Monkey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brown Horse: Hey not bad. From now on you guys can call me \nMustex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Grey Horse:  Just call me Stallex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:  Hey what do you want to be called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Monkey:  We&#39;re more animal now than Machine.  And like animals \nwe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; abandoned our friends at the outpost.  Why fancy up what we are. \n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just call me Rhesus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: The question of what happened to Stallex still applies even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; though I changed the back story.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:  I developed a little something I called hover-cycles.  \n&gt; They \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can go at speeds of up to 200 mph.  Thought you might like to \n&gt; know.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus presses a button and 3 come out of the storage room.  He \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; looks at the readouts of the satalite.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:  The biggest energon deposite is occupied and far away. \n \n&gt; But \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is a fair sized one about 25 miles south of here. I think \nI \n&gt; &gt; can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; still get enough thrust to get the shuttle there, but not to \nland \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it.  Believe me when this is over salvage will be the only use \nfor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this shuttle.So we better take the hover-cycles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus launches it toward the deposit (no one touch it it&#39;s \nmine) \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they take off on the cycles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A shuttle plumets towards earth.
