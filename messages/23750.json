Now, not only has she put her and Snow Tech in danger, she put her \nbest friend in it too. She felt crushed. Just hearing Iron Raptors orders \nand Prowls opinoin, she sighed and looked at the two bots with eyes that \nwhere on the verge of break-down. She knew that they didn&#39;t understand what \ndanger they where in. She spoke to them in a voice that sounded throughout \nthe small glade they where in.*\n\n&quot; you don&#39;t understand. They are following us, they have a lock on our \nsparks and will track us to the base, putting not only us 5 in danger, but \nthe entire base and all of it&#39;s occupants. There has to be a way to divert \nthem? There HAS to!&quot;\n\n8 She sank to her knees, the soft earth packing down under her weight, \nleaving a small impression. She searched her mind for all the information \nshe had learned about them when she was there, looking over and over, trying \nto find something to give them time to get away and mabey, somehow, scramble \ntheir scanners so they couldn&#39;t find them.*\n* Shadow Cat blinked suddenly, she sat up and grinned. It was so stupidly \neasy it was pathetic. She looked at Snow Tech*\n\n&quot; Can you rig-up a transmitting device that will scramble their scanners?&quot;\n\n* Snow Tech blinked and stepped back in suprise.*\n\n&quot; Uh, yeah. But what about their base?&quot;\n\n* She looked at Iron Raptor and Prowl.*\n\n&quot; You two go on ahead. We know the general direction, so we wont be lost.&quot;\n\n* She stood up and walked over to Iron Raptor, handing her the quivering \nmass of fuzz, placing it directly into her hands and closing her fingers \nslightly around him.*\n\n&quot; Take care of him. He can&#39;t be hurt normally, but the creatures that are \ncoming can. He is VERY special, so don&#39;t loose him. He is one of the most \nimportant things that me an&#39; Snowy have right now, he&#39;s our future, so \nprotect him with your life.&quot;\n\n* She then turned away from them, surveying Snow Tech as he began to put \ntogether a minute scrambling device.*\n\n&quot; we will join you soon. The divice shouldn&#39;t disort your scanners, but if \nit does let us know so we can fix it so it doesn&#39;t.&quot;\n\n* The little fuzzy kitten senced being switched hands,and wondered if he was \nsafe yet. He peeked out from his fur showing only one humongous eye. He \nmewed and looked at Iron Raptor. He stretched out to the form of her hand, \nmaking himself comfortable.*\n\n&quot; Puurrrrrrrr.&quot;\n\n* Snow Tech had finished the little device and held it proudly in the palm \nof his hand. He gave it to Shadow Cat who placed it in her belt. She then \nspread her wings of steel and grabbed Snow tech under the arm pits, lifting \nhim off the ground. She growled at him. He really needs to go on a diet, she \nthought to herself and to him she said,*\n\n&quot; I can&#39;t wait till you&#39;ve figured out your new body, i hope you have wings, \n&#39;cause flying you around is a pain, literally! my back is killing me!&quot;\n\n* They gained altitude and where soon above the trees, looking out for the \ncreachers. They seemed to be a ways off, about half a continent or so, so \nshe and Snow Tech had lots of time, and more, thanks to the scrambling \ndevice. They headed the wdirection Iron Raptor had given her, keeping her \nscanners on. She didn&#39;t want to have anymore suprises for one day...*\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
