She looked at\n&gt; Rowdy one last time. Then back to Megatron. &quot;AS you command.&quot;  She\n&gt; ran back headed back to the base.  While running back through the\n&gt; woods she taked to herself. &quot;What is wrong with me.  I&#39;m hearing\n&gt; voices from no where and telling Megatron to follow them? I must be\n&gt; loosing my logic circuits or something.  I&#39;m going nuts, that&#39;s all\n&gt; there is to it. I&#39;m loosing my mind.  I just got promoted and he&#39;ll\n&gt; demote me for sure.&quot;  she ran back to the base.\n&gt;\n&gt; DarkMouse::\n&gt; She sighed, and looked at the drone.  She was feeling better, but at\n&gt; teh same time, feeling useless.  She was a fighter and computer\n&gt; controller.  Sitting in her room, and it was spectacular compared to\n&gt; her last one, she still felt bad about not being able to fight yet.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;     Megatron looked Kitkat up and down. He grew very bored with her\n&gt; antics\n&gt; &gt; very quickly. &quot;Both of you return to base now! we will settle it\n&gt; there. Here\n&gt; &gt; were in the open.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;     Also, as insurence, he took out his tail gun and ignited the\n&gt; purple\n&gt; &gt; plasma that fuled it. If Kitkat decided to bail, she was going to\n&gt; do it in\n&gt; &gt; peices.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Aracnia listened to Darkmouse and nodded. The Medical drone\n&gt; entered,\n&gt; &gt; saluted, and began to run its programmed diagnostic on her. Aracnia\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; later open the gym up for the mouse, it would allow her to warm her\n&gt; body up\n&gt; &gt; for a battle if needed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
