You start your post with Tuscon in =\r\nthe middle\n&gt; of a very tense stand off with him being defensless and you en=\r\nd it with him\n&gt; being on the way to the Ark.  Basically you made no allowan=\r\nce for someone,\n&gt; presumably Hydras, to stop Tuscon from leaving - which is=\r\n what most evil bad\n&gt; guys would do.\n&gt; \n&gt; In message #70973 the demand was =\r\nthat the Maximals and Autobots lay down\n&gt; thier weapons if they wanted Nigh=\r\ntlight to live.\n&gt; \n&gt; In message #70975 Tuscon gives the order for all the M=\r\naximals and such to\n&gt; comply. And in that post you write that Night Shift s=\r\nubspaces his weapon, as\n&gt; Straight Shot transforms into her robot mode, dis=\r\narming her own weaponry as\n&gt; well.\n&gt; \n&gt; In message #70978 Tuscon lays down =\r\nhis weapon and in Message #70987 Kup and\n&gt; Talon do the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; This wou=\r\nld mean that all of the Maximals and Autobots in that area are now\n&gt; weapon=\r\nless, and so pretty much defenceless. At the same time much of the\n&gt; Predac=\r\non army is standing there, either in front of them, or flying over\n&gt; head. =\r\nI had posted that the preds were picking up those discarded weapons\n&gt; while=\r\n other were watching.\n&gt; \n&gt; However in message #70988 Tuscon is able to pick=\r\n up a weapon, aim it at\n&gt; someone, then with the help of the other Maximals=\r\n choose not to fire, they\n&gt; are able to talk back and forth a few times, sa=\r\nlute each other and then\n&gt; Tuscon drives off with no one stopping him.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n How do we reconcile all of that? Since you already had Tuscon sending\n&gt; me=\r\nssages out and your characters already responding, if we had someone stop\n&gt;=\r\n you in the middle of all of that, it would make it confusing as to what\n&gt; =\r\nhappened and what didn&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tuscon should not have been able to point a =\r\nweapon, talk, transform and\n&gt; drive away with no response. Does that make s=\r\nense? Anything we post in the\n&gt; middle of that would only confuse things wo=\r\nrse.\n&gt; \n&gt; We might need some editing. Like Tuscon just does the first part =\r\nof that,\n&gt; but not leave yet. Allow the rest of us to post a response first=\r\n, then if it\n&gt; is reasonable based on the responses he leaves?\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, =\r\nnot trying to to be critical, but keeping it fair.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; On Sat, Jan 22, 2011 at 7:58 AM, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I did an edit but I guess I&#39;ll add Uproar back in.

His body was powerfully built\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and heavily=\r\n armored.

He raised his\n&gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hand in the=\r\n air, the one with the arm cannon on it and begin to emit\n&gt; &gt; light\n&gt; &gt; &gt; f=\r\nrom it, much like a flash light or a beacon so that the room was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; illu=\r\nminated.
