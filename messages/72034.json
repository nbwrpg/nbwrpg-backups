It has been used as=\r\n a\n&gt; lure for many centuries with varying degrees of success.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, be =\r\nthat as it may, WHEELIE continued down the path. The\n&gt; interesting thing wa=\r\ns as he moved he could note that had been\n&gt; flattened down as if some large=\r\n vehicle had recently driven down it,\n&gt; perhaps within the past day or so. =\r\nIt allowed him to shift to\n&gt; vehicular mode and to make greater speed.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n As he drove the path began to open up as tree distance allowed for the\n&gt; p=\r\nath to enlarge somewhat, his sensors now able to pick up what might\n&gt; appea=\r\nr to be a structure of some type. It was from here that the\n&gt; signal was be=\r\ning broadcast.\n&gt; \n&gt; As he drove figures would seem to be on the path with h=\r\nim on or behind\n&gt; the trees he passed. It was like shadows or plays of ligh=\r\nt =96 you see\n&gt; it out of the corner of the optic, but when one focused on =\r\nit, it was\n&gt; gone.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the distance a roar echoed over the forest, and =\r\nthen several\n&gt; smaller ones. From the sound of it, it was coming from far b=\r\nehind\n&gt; WHEELIE, somewhere in the distance several miles away or more. Howe=\r\nver\n&gt; ahead of him a small pyramid of some sort was becoming visible, and\n&gt;=\r\n the path he was on seemed to be heading straight for it.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs he wen=\r\nt over towards the..  Rising architecture in the region, WHEELIE simply had=\r\n nowhere else to go.  Finding his way out of the communications blockade wo=\r\nuld take too long, and even then the Maximals going into it would be scatte=\r\nred.  Such a signal could easily be faked by anyone with commuincations gea=\r\nr, and whatever it was was almost guaranteed to be a decoy or a trap, not a=\r\n dropped Autobot.  Such things were a tactic as old as communications warfa=\r\nre existed.\n\nBut he simply had nothing else to go on.  For the moment, as h=\r\ne zoomed along the road slowly, the dust and mud from the jungle and the cl=\r\nearing foilage still obscuring him somewhat as he went along the tracks, he=\r\n had no other leads.  HE could not pick up anything on sensors, he was not =\r\na good enough technician to try and backtrack along the signal or try and b=\r\nypass it, adnh the foliage of the jungle was far too thick for him to attem=\r\npt any sort of scans regardless.\n\nSo, he could not do anything but drive to=\r\nwards it, cautiously as he could, keeping his scanners set to passive and r=\r\nunning along primarily on visual and auditory scanners.\n\nAt this point, he =\r\ndid not know whether the approaching structure was something made by the na=\r\ntives of thi splanet in time, or would be something of clearly alien manufa=\r\ncture.\n\nUpon feeling the..  Ghosts upon hi ssensors, Wheelie stayed quiet. =\r\n He did not know what they were, but he felt the chill upon ihs spark regar=\r\ndless.  Yet he could not see them, out of the corner of his optics or on an=\r\ny sort of sensor.  Yet there was something there, if even nothing more than=\r\n his own unease.\n\nAt the very least, hopefully there would be SOMETHING ahe=\r\nad in th structure to give him a goal..  Or, otehrwise if he was being purs=\r\nued, to give him a bit of cover he could use to shield himself if eh came u=\r\nnder attack!\n\nOOC - Assum ehe&#39;s going a bit faster now that he&#39;s trasnforme=\r\nd, but not at full speed and being cautious, but not putting in as much eff=\r\nort to remain unnoticed as he was previously.\n\n\n\n"}}
