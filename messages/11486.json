This ship is so damaged, \nit wouldn&#39;tfly again even if we replaced everything onboard down to \nthe paper clips in the captain&#39;s desk. The ark is grounded for good. \nAnd all we can do is sit here and repair parts of it just enough to \nsurvive another pred attack.&quot; She gave a deep sigh.\n\nShadow Wing::\nShe put a comforting hand on Spears shoulder.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, \neverything will work out.
