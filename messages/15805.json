She peared in and \nsaw him in beast mode, standing there.  She cried and looked at him.  \nUnder her orders, she could tell him nothing, and only reply that she \nwas Master Prebon&#39;s.  But at least she had Prebon&#39;s agreement that \nStriker wouldn&#39;t get that slagging chip.  She looked at him, glad \nthat he was alive and in reasonable condition. She tried to smile at \nhim through tear filled eyes.  She managed to whisper to him,&quot;I&#39;m \nsorry.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Prebon stared at Striker.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Striker goes without a chip, if I meet with Ramulus. If I don&#39;t, \nhe \n&gt; gets the chip and he stays here, with you. So get some rest. Soon \nwe \n&gt; go after Ramulus.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
