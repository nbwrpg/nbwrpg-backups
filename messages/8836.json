She looked into those charming \neyes of his.\n&quot;Look, I&#39;m an owl and your a wolf.  That right there making this \ndifficult.  We are two different species right now.&quot;\nShe knelt down and put the scanner on the floor.  She moved to face \nLunarpine.\n&quot;I know that a social creature, like the wolf, wil get lonely after a \nwhile if there are no other creatures like it around.  I too am \nlonely for the other owls back in the old forest.  So I thought that \nif I changed into a wolf, I could make you happier.&quot;  she smiled and \nlooked at him with careing in her eyes.\n&quot;I just wanted to make you happy. And if this works, maybe I&#39;ll even \nsee you smile once in a while too.&quot;\nShe picked up the scanner and started walking down the hallway.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine held still for a moment while Shadow Wing scanned him. \nThe \n&gt; hum of the scanner causing soothing vibrations through his body.\n&gt; \n&gt; He tranformed back to bot and started to follow her back to the CR \n&gt; room. He heard what she said about being a wolf. &quot;You&#39;re what?&quot; \n&gt; Lunarpine didn&#39;t know exactly what to think, &quot;Just what are you \n&gt; thinking?&quot; He was beginning to get upset &quot;Why the Pit would you \nwant \n&gt; to do something like that for?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He decided to let her explain herself before he jumped to \nconclusions.\n&gt; \n&gt; (These two should be a couple, they&#39;re either loving each other or \n&gt; arguing about something.)\n&gt; (One of these days Shadow Wing POW To the Moon:)\n&gt; I gotta go do laundry, we&#39;ll pick up this argument later.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
