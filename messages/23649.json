He looks at Prowl as he slides his arm around IR,*\n\n&lt;What a imature little heathen! He&#39;s worse than me! God, if he wants to play \ngames....&gt;\n\n* Snow Tech stopped just then, he watched as IR rejected his advances, and \nwas almost unable to contain his laughter. This guy was so insanely jelouse \nthat he didn&#39;t relize that he might be making her mad or anything else! What \na dope! he looks over at Shadow Cat who was standing there saying good bye \nto the bot who had scared her erlier.*\n\n&quot; Sheesh! Some peoples kids, huh Shad?&quot;\n\n* SHadow Cat smiled tolerably at Snow Techs jest to Prowl. She then frowned \nat him, knowing that this was no way a proper way to show they didn&#39;t mean \nharm to the over-zelous bot. He was obviously in love with Iron Raptor, but \nwould his jelousy and over-protectivness jepordize their relashonship with \neach-other? She knew Iron Raptor well, mabey too well, they had been best \nbuds back on the home planet, and Shadow Cat knew She had changed, but she \nhadn&#39;t changed too much. If he kept this up, who knows what will happen? \nMabey she will get mad, or mabey not, who could judge, but one thing was \ncertian. If this lover of IR&#39;s pulled and crap like the crap he pulled on \nSnow Tech, he would regret it. She might be Ir&#39;s friend, but she could only \ntake so much crap from some bots.*\n\n* She intervened Snow Techs Awnser to Iron Raptors question of going to \nbase. She knew he would just say some thing smart-assed. She side-stepped in \nfront of him, facing Iron Raptor.*\n\n&quot;I will fly the walking turd, just give us the directions.....&quot;\n\n* She never finished her sentance. Her eyes dimmed and looked into the \ndistance, seeing something they other two bots couldn&#39;t see. Snow Tech and \nthe other little bot had also gone that way. Looking as if they had turned \ninto living vegtables. As the nano seconds flew by, a look of dread and \nabsalute terror crossed all three faces until they snapped out of it, all \nlooking at the two other bots, a mix of feeling flashing across their faces. \nThe little bot curled into a ball and began to whimper, and Shadow Cat and \nSnow Tech looked as if they wanted to do the same. Finally Shadow Cat Spoke, \nand hurridely, to Iron Raptor and Prowl,*\n\n&quot; Leave now! Go, they wont find you if you go!!!&quot;\n\n* She began backing away from them, as if the very air they breathed was \ncontaminated by an evil force, waving a free hand at them to depart*\n\n&quot; They are here! how.. What did we do wrong?&quot;\n\n* Snow Tech had come up to her and put his arms around her shoulders as she \nshook. He awnsered her softly and soothingly*\n\n&quot; We did nothing wrong. They probally had transmitters implanted in us just \nin case it did happen.&quot;\n\n* He sighed and looked at the surrounding jungle.*\n\n&quot; Now where are they?&quot;\n\n* Far away, they trees shook as the terrible machines passed, leaving a wide \nberth of destruction as they passed. Animals fled in their wake, sencing \nthat they intended harm. One of the mighty things stopped and swivled its \nhead 180 degrees, a light blipped and it spoke to the others,*\n\n&lt;Suspects spotted at nine thousand nano-meres from this location. Suspects \nhave with them two unadentified organic/robotic mix creachers. Is this a \nsearch and destroy mission?&gt;\n\n* A voice spoke from the crowd of others*\n\n&lt; Search and destroy mission confirmed, anniahlate any creachers that the \nsuspects have had contact with. Leave no evidence of presance&gt;\n\n* They resumed their travel to the three bots code named Shadow 13, Snow 3 \nand Kitt 7.*\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
