The ex-predacon \nhad retreated when his scanners picked up two Maximals aproaching. He growls. \nThe ram chasing him was pretty experienced, he had to give him that.\n\nSeveral minutes later, Striker seemed to have lost the Maximal chasing him. \nHe slows down slightly, heading for Magmatron&#39;s base.\n\n"}}
