He came to kill a young child who \n&gt;isn&#39;t even here.  We faught to defend the Maximal base!&quot;  As he spots the \n&gt;tree he alters to his bird mode and takes to the air.  The tree passes \n&gt;below his legs and crashes into the base wall above the door.  He lands \n&gt;again and returns to his winged centaur mode.  He once again loads an arrow \n&gt;but this time fires it at Burning Hammer.  He can&#39;t hurt Recon because he \n&gt;isn&#39;t the enemy.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
