No, there would be too much work even\nfor us Minions. No, we have been outnumbered in our sleep, something\nMaster Unicron had not planned. We cannot hunt people down. We have to\nstart a war, but we must do this in a methodical way.\n\nHe ordered the reactivation of the section after Darkfate was out of\nit, then summoned a holoprojection of Earth.\n\nVorpal: I need you all to scout. We need to establish how well\ndefended their production facilities are in order to plan our attacks.\nThere are two places where you must NEVER go though...\n\nHe brought up images of the Cryonosis Tower and of Mount Olympus.\n\nVorpal: These are two of the Cybertronians&#39; most heavily defended\npositions. Cryonosis is a monitoring station that seems to be watching\nus. Eventually, we will have to take it out, but not yet. Olympus\nComplex, on the other hand, is the dedicated central military\nfacility. It is a place so well defended we must not hope to leave\nthere unscathed. For now, though, we will concentrate on their orbital\nfacilities. Go, and report all that you see! \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Nightstrike/Darkfate:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t have any problem... and after this, I guess that Darkfate\nneither&quot;replied Nightstrike&quot;What important thing will do?? hunt down\nthore treacherous laidies??? they are a danger that should be\neradicated as soon as possible, I guess that MAster Unicron told ya bout&quot;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Nic \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, July 09, 2005 12:30 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: The Awakened\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Vorpal: You are right.
