Double Punch is \nin his stealth mode cloaked, and hasn&#39;t opened fire on anyone yet, and \nBreakdown nor Hiss can fly)\n\nHiss/Pyro/Breakdown/Double \nPunch/Manterror/Scattershot/Punch/Bumblebee/Injector/Dark One/Scavenger:\n\n\n\nDouble Punch sees a charge go off twenty feet from him, cursing as he feels \nflames engulf him, his cloaking system still in tact.  Activating his comm. \nsystem, he sent a transmission to Zardus.  \n\n&quot;Zardus, this is Predacon Double Punch.  We are here to kill those Maximals.  \nNot to engage your forces.  Especially your mentally ill ones.&quot; \n\nDouble Punch saw Dinobot coming his way, being chased by Alliance members.  \nRaising a pincher, he fired off a missile at Dinobot&#39;s chest.\n\n---\n\nManterror fired off two ion disks at Prowl, half his back turned towards the \ndirection Tavatron was coming, leaving him vunerable for attack. (Hint, hint)\n\n---\n\nInjector cursed, raising his stinger missile launcher, flying full speed at \nProwl, firing off two stinger missiles at the flying feathered metallic \nmonstrosity of Maximal propaganda, a single optic laser blast lashing out at \nthe Maximal&#39;s left side.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee cursed, shells digging into his chest plating, knocking him back a \nfew feet in the air.  Raising both of his stinger missile launcher, he fired \noff two missiles down at Scavenger, two at Prowl.\n\n---\n\nScattershot flew through the air, raising his automatic rifle, firing off 10 \nexplosive rounds at Prowl&#39;s back, putting the boosters to full, speeding him \nup, sending him rocketing towards Prowl.\n\n---\n\nScavenger screamed, a missile going off a few feet to the left of him, \nanother hitting behind him.  Swerving to the left, the blasts missed him.  \n\n&quot;Maybe...I better stick to ground warfare.&quot; he decided, continuing to go \nafter Dinobot.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown cursed.  He needed to catch up, but if he went to artillery mode \nit&#39;d be even slower.  Raising his rifle, he fired off a few pot shots at \nDinobot.\n\n---\n\nPyro ran after Tavatron, flame cannon set on flame thrower.  &quot;Barbecued \nsaurian, my absolute FAVE!&quot;\n\n---\n\nHiss chased after Dinobot, firing a single pot shot, in hopes of compromising \nDinobot&#39;s courage, from his fusion cannon.  \n\n---\n\nDark One slowly entered the CR room, seeing the six CR chambers, stumbling \ntowards one, he finally reached it after a cycle, although it was only a \nminute, it felt like an eternity to the badly damaged robot.\n\nPressing a button, the hatch slid open, Dark One stepping in, collapsing into \nstasis lock, the CR chamber hatch sliding shut, repairs initiating.\n\n"}}
