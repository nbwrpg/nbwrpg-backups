Prowl sighs, looking at the horizon. He knew that the CF \nhad launched a shuttle a few seconds after he had sent the \ntransmission. Soon, the shuttle would be here.\n\nProwl looks down at his wrist compartment, opening it with a mental \ncommand and taking out the energy nunchuks. They quickly combine into \na staff, Prowl reaching down so that the end was up against \nFiredrill&#39;s chest. The staff humms slightly, transferring enough \npower into Firedrill to keep his energy within functional parameters.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The robot strugled to stand up, and weakly gurgled some sounds, \nthen spat\n&gt; up some fuel, &quot;Sorry&quot; he said, and then put out his hand, in a \ngesture of\n&gt; friendship, &quot;Thanks&quot; he said, to Prowls response on his friends. &quot;I \nam\n&gt; Fire..
