So she wold be in \nlove with him for now.   But she felt something strange inside of her \nspark.  Could she really be falling for him.  She did find him a \nlittle more attractive now that he was more like her. She couldn&#39;t \nhelp but wonder if she was starting to truely fall for him. She was \nbigging to think that maybe she was.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt; \n&gt; He came out of the CR. He was now mostly black with red, and very \nlittle\n&gt; yellow. The mostly red, orange and yellow paturn was gone. He walked\n&gt; right up to. Feline. He had been thinking about if she really loved \nhim,\n&gt; or was it all part of the plan. He just came out with it.\n&gt; &quot;So tell me, did we really have something, or was it just another\n&gt; pleasure of your asignment?
