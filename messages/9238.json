Again, I apologize.)\n\n* Dinobot watched as Pyro flew back from his sent ammunition actually surprised that the enemy bot had flown back as far as he did. But then the corners of his toothed mouth almost turned up in a grin as he saw Pyro loose his temper for a moment. However, when he transformed into his tank mode there was no smile even trying to show its existence across the reptilian warrior�s face�only then blank expression.\nSo, he had seen where they were going to be retreating? Well, he had it half right.\nAs much as the Alliance bot was abscessed with burning the forest he didn�t know that it wasn�t exactly the way he was going to go.\nSure, he was going to enter the forest but only for a mile or so�then he would reach his TRUE destination�and their key to freedom!\nA swamp!\nThere everything would be too dank and moist for a fire to burn, having scouted it out as he had waited for Prowl to arrive.\nIt was the perfect escape route�however, if the enemy continued to pursue him all the way to the Cybertronien Fire he would then engage�once he had Tavatron safely inside.\nIt was then that he suddenly heard something over the noise of the battle, something that he had heard before�MISSILE!!\nWith a snarl Dinobot snapped his head towards the sound but just as he turned his head and sidled aside it struck!\nThe impact of the missile caused him to stumble side but not far enough to hit Tavatron, an explosion of small pieces if armor and mech-fluid erupting from the area just behind his shoulder.\nWith a grimace he took in the pain and shook his head to clear it, then looking off towards Double Punch with a look that could turn fire to ice!\nEvery sense in his very being wanted to transform and just rip the slag out of that bot�but that thought of getting Tavatron to safety held him from doing so. Just barely!\nThen snapping his head towards Scavenger as he screamed, watching as he fell to the ground. Later simply watching as he tried to catch a ride with Pyro but was then thrown off.\nDinobot looked carefully at Pyro as he headed towards the forest, firing his cannon. Perhaps he could get some slaging in after all before they left.\nThat thought seemed to dampen the pain a bit, his own mech-fluid just pouring from his side and staining the ground at his feet red.\nIt was then that he felt Tavatron climb onto his back, noting that she had seemed a little confused when he had told her to get on. What had she thought, he was going to carry her out of there in his arms? He was afraid not. In his beast mode he had a lot more bulk and was able to move freely with added weight, Tavatron, right now, felt no heavier then a child as she rested on his back.\nHis head then snapped towards Hiss as he approached them, nearly rearing back in surprise when he felt Tavatron wrap her arms around his neck. He wasn�t used to carrying anyone let alone feeling arms around his neck, the slight feeling of choking developing. But he simply ignored it, her grasp on his neck was not tight enough to restrict breathing�yet!\nBut if they were going to get to that swamp before their way was blocked completely by fire they had to go now, no time to stay and think of any better ways of escape.\nThe turning towards the forest he judged that Pyro was close enough to be a suitable target, just hoping that Tavatron was holding on tight enough.\nWithout even looking back he scanned the distance between himself and the forest, keeping that scanning screen active as he suddenly saw the grenade Breakdown sent explode a few feet ahead.\nBut then he suddenly turned his head towards the on coming forces, an cunning and insightful glint in his eye.*\n\n� You SLAGS want me?!!� he snarled taking a few back steps towards the forest, just daring them to be brave enough to follow him. � Come and GET ME!!!�\n\n* And with that he whipped around and faced the forest, not even giving his words enough time to sink in before he was running towards the green wall of giant trunks.\nThe area he was heading for was relatively clear, actually giving the enemy room to follow with ease.\nBut just as he neared the forest he pulled a stunt that was simply convenient, something that would buy him a little time and the forest a little less grief.\nDinobot glared as Pyro as he ran, the tank-bot being perfectly aligned with his present course. Of course, he couldn�t go through the armored Alliance bot�but he could go OVER!\nWithout even a warning to Tavatron to hold on a bit tighter he launched himself into the air meters away from running into Pyro�s cannon, coming right down onto it with all his weight and then simply springing off and continuing towards the forest like it was just a pleasant outing.\nHis hope was that his weight just pressed down onto the tank�s cannon would force it to dig into the dirt as it fired it�s next shot, however, he wasn�t sure if he had applied enough.\nThough, if the attempt failed he would simply look like a smartallic, looking as if he was simply playing with the Alliance and making complete fun out of their gathered forces.\nEither way suited him just fine.\nBut whether they chased him or not, it didn�t matter to him.\nAs Dinobot entered the trees he slowed down a bit, almost to make it seem as if he was drawing on short breaths. Which he wasn�t.\nAnd if Tavatron cared to notice, every one of his muscles were tight with the energy that had not been used in battle and was just screaming to be let out.\nHowever, just to make it seem as if there was nothing wrong, and to lighten the mode so that Tavatron would stop feeling so tense� AND STOP DIGGING HER HEEL INTO HIS WOUNDED SIDE, he growled in a slightly amused and VERY slightly playful manner.*\n\n� Comfortable?�\n\n* His tone was teasing and sarcastic, knowing that riding an over-grown salamander wasn�t the best way to travel. However, with him, it was fairly smooth.\nHe gave Tavatron a small wink before turning his head forward again, giving her a very clear sign that they were going to have fun if the Alliance gave chase. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
