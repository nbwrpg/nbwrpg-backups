Ideas are \nbecoming exausted, if not completely exausted already. It seems to \nme that we are almost delaying the end of the rpg. If you&#39;ve created \none storyline that you like, is it not fair to say that you can \ncreate another better one?\n\nThe idea of creating a sequel to the rpg is one that I would agree \nwith. That would require several things to happen:\n1) Changing the name of the RPG.\n2) Appropriate changes to the website.\n3) A means to store all of everyone&#39;s previous characters (don&#39;t \nknow about everyone else, but I don&#39;t want to lose the bio&#39;s of all \nmy characters).\n4) New story (i have an idea, not necessarily for the story, but for \nhow we could create the story).\n5) A catalyst to start us all off (the story should provide that).\n6) Implementation of new rules, some of which have been, and are \nbeing, discussed in the login messageboard.\n7) other stuff that could be written if I wasn&#39;t so tired.\n\nAll in all, since there are more people voting anti-restart that I&#39;d \nanticpated, I&#39;ll ask everyone a perhaps fate deciding question:\n\nWould it be favourable to have a sequel instead of a restart?\n \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m agree with Soulstice, restart isn&#39;t good idea. All have good \n&gt; story-lines and good characters. Perhaps the best would be \neliminate  \n&gt; less importat characters of our story-line (every rpgers could \nchoice \n&gt; at whom wants eliminate) and elimitante factions where are member \n&gt; that aren&#39;t posting and join factions that have few characters \n&gt; playing. \n&gt; \n&gt; That other way than restart.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I at first wasn&#39;t sure if I could vote in this one. Not \nonly \n&gt; am I seemingly not too much an important part of this RPG, despite \n&gt; the general current lack of members, and the fact that I&#39;ve been \nhere \n&gt; for getting close to 2 years, but also I am not involved in this \n&gt; restart. I have very few characters. Characters that, if the RPG \nis \n&gt; restarted, will still be together (Insecticons, specifically), and \n&gt; therefore it wouldn&#39;t harm me to vote yes. However, I don&#39;t think \nI \n&gt; could vote yes, because I am apposed to restarting the RPG. I have \n&gt; decided to vote no. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me to end the \nsaga \n&gt; of Neo Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked hard over \nthe \n&gt; years to keep going. I don&#39;t think that we could suddenly pretend \nit \n&gt; never happened, I think it&#39;s impossible. Maybe if we ended it and \n&gt; started the sequel, I wouldn&#39;t mind so much, but otherwise, my \nvote \n&gt; is no.
