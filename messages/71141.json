Don&#39;t take it the wrong way Rodimus, T=\r\nucson&#39;s always \n&gt; had a nasty temper, even when he was just an average Auto=\r\nbot. I can remember \n&gt; a lotta bar room fights and all those times where he=\r\n&#39;d smash a con&#39;s face to \n&gt; unrecognizable smitherines.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson also a=\r\ndds in his part.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;She&#39;s right, I never lost my temper around Autobots,=\r\n only Decepticons.  But \n&gt; I would get agitated with certain Autobots from =\r\ntime to time..  But that&#39;s \n&gt; as far as that went.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot nodd=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I remember that.

I&#39;d get what he needed and deliver the goods safely back to the \n&gt; Ia=\r\ncon med bay.  Then, I&#39;d actually watch him repair damaged Autobots.  When \n=\r\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t fighting, I was using my spare time to restore old weaponry and =\r\n\n&gt; artifacts.  I got to learn a lot about simple repair work, simply by \n&gt; =\r\nwatching Ratchet, and taking his good advice.  That was all before my \n&gt; un=\r\nfortunate run in with Cyclonus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot looks up to Rodimus.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot; Of course, when he was needed on the battlefield, Tucson was always th=\r\nere, \n&gt; on time, no matter where he was or what he was doing.  I guess his =\r\ntemper \n&gt; stems from the need to see a job well done all the way through.  =\r\nHydras is \n&gt; disrupting that sense of stability, and that&#39;s what&#39;s really m=\r\naking Tucson \n&gt; angry.

I know, I was there, \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; lemme tell ya it haunts me too.  Have ya ever thought ta open u=\r\np about it\n&gt; &gt; Tucson?  Maybe that would kinda help ya heal a little bit.  =\r\nThe wounds are\n&gt; &gt; still fresh, even though that fight was a long time ago.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; You&#39;re right.  Rodimus, Legacy, I&#39;ve been=\r\n keeping something from you for \n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; long time, and that&#39;s not what a=\r\n respectable leader does.  A leader may be\n&gt; &gt; strong but he too, must open=\r\n up about the issues that weaken his state of\n&gt; &gt; mind.  It all started on =\r\nthe day of that battle, that had Rodimus abducted\n&gt; &gt; and taken over by Hyd=\r\nras and his forces.  I fought in that battle as a\n&gt; &gt; soldier. And being a =\r\nNinjabot myself, I knew of Nightrazor&#39;s properties, \n&gt; &gt; yet\n&gt; &gt; I felt tha=\r\nt if I barged in on Rodimus, it would only land me with a case \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ninsubordination.  So, I refrained from doing so, but tried to divert enemy\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; attentions indirectly.  For the most part it worked and I was able to \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; fight\n&gt; &gt; my way through those who knew nothing about Ninjabot combat. =\r\n Yet, there\n&gt; &gt; were seekers who were far more swift on their wings then I =\r\nwas on my \n&gt; &gt; wheels.\n&gt; &gt; They were bearing down on the Autobots, to the p=\r\noint that I felt that if I\n&gt; &gt; did not step in, there wouldn&#39;t be an Autobo=\r\nt left to defend the Ark or \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; planet.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He pauses.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot; From what I remember, I transformed into my vehicle mode, and started t=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; kick up dirt from my tires, in hopes that a seeker would see what I w=\r\nas up\n&gt; &gt; to.  It worked, and I grabbed the attention of several, although =\r\nI \n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; see who they were because they were rather high up from=\r\n me.  Then, \n&gt; &gt; suddenly,\n&gt; &gt; I was struck.  And I don&#39;t remember anything=\r\n more than that.  A long time\n&gt; &gt; afterwards, I was brought back online, an=\r\nd when I woke up, I could only \n&gt; &gt; see\n&gt; &gt; darkness.  At first, I thought =\r\nit was a power outage, but then, I was told\n&gt; &gt; that my optic sensors were =\r\ncompletely destroyed by the cranial shot that I\n&gt; &gt; had endured during that=\r\n chase.  I asked about you Rodimus, but, no one \n&gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; tell me what=\r\n happened.  It was at that point where I knew that I failed \n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; If=\r\n only I had listened to myself the first time, and came in front of you\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n when you were chasing Nightrazor that first time.  You would not have\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsuffered as you had, nor would your family. And since then, I pledged to \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; get\n&gt; &gt; back on my feet, and never let my defenses down again, and if I =\r\nhad to, \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; strike back harder than any Decepticon or Predacon cou=\r\nld ever fathom.  I\n&gt; &gt; failed you once Rodimus, and I pledged NEVER to let =\r\nthat happen again.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to Tucson with a thoughtful=\r\n gaze.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wow, you never even told me all that before.  Well, since w=\r\ne&#39;re opening \n&gt; &gt; up\n&gt; &gt; about it, I wish I could help you guys understand =\r\nwhat happened, but I \n&gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; remember a little bit more than he does.=\r\n Right before he got shot, I saw\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus decending just a tad closser =\r\nto us than the other seekers that \n&gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; following us.  I saw him ta=\r\nke the shot and I screamed, and that&#39;s when\n&gt; &gt; everything went blank.  I t=\r\nhink what would really help Tucson now, is\n&gt; &gt; knowing that what happened, =\r\nreally wasn&#39;t his fault.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson now turns his head toward Megatron=\r\n&#39;s body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Having the Decepticons here amongst us is highly un nerv=\r\ning to me. \n&gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; must be a way to separate them from the Autobots,=\r\n and place them in a safe\n&gt; &gt; location...  Wait, I remember something..  Th=\r\ne Decepticons had their own\n&gt; &gt; craft, The Nemisis...  Why couldn&#39;t we retu=\r\nrn them to their rightful craft\n&gt; &gt; and separate them from the Autobots, wh=\r\nere both factions would be safe \n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; harm?  Rodimus, due to circum=\r\nbstances which I have just told you, for my \n&gt; &gt; own\n&gt; &gt; emotional stabilit=\r\ny, I can not have these Decepticons here.  But I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; willing\n&gt; &gt; to help=\r\n preserve them in a safe location away from the Ark.  Legacy, if \n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; could, I&#39;d like you to find out where the Nemisis is now located and if =\r\nit\n&gt; &gt; is within reach.  Once located, I want the Decepticons brought safel=\r\ny back\n&gt; &gt; to their own ship, where they can rest in peace, thus leaving th=\r\ne Ark to \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Autobots to do the same.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot smile=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Now that&#39;s more like the Tucson I know.  I like that idea, I li=\r\nke it \n&gt; &gt; alot.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside the Ark, Uproar and Quickstride look to e=\r\nach other and just shrug\n&gt; &gt; off the event.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hmm, oh well, would&#39;ve=\r\n been fun ta see them end up in the tar pit but,\n&gt; &gt; works for me, Uproar.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ditto.  Okay, so, I guess we can go back in=\r\nside.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They get into beast mode, and prance back into the Ark.

Legacy pointedly glanced at Straight Shot and then back at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Tuscon,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;TO PUT OUR FUTURE IN JEOPARDY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE IS NOT =\r\nACCEPTABLE.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PErceptor gain control of =\r\nthe ark and activate all the internal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defences\n&gt; &gt; &gt; against the H=\r\nydra&#39;s predacons and tried to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As preceptor wo=\r\nrked, the Ark began to respond to his commands as weapons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; began to ac=\r\ntivate, internal defenses systems came online.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;What is your co=\r\nmmand?&quot; Teletran 1 asked Perceptor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MEANWHILE IN THE MEDI=\r\nCAL BAY:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight continue peacefully=\r\n sleeping while Elita jumped on the bed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her beast form an=\r\nd nuzzled in her mom&#39;s cheek while she cried in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; silence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mo=\r\nmmie&quot;said Elita&quot; I miss you so much... so much&quot;sobbed the little \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; g=\r\nirl\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while her tears fell in her mom&#39;s cheek\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Nightlight continued to sleep, as all around her the machines register=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as resting in a comma like state. All of her systems see=\r\nmed otherwise in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stable condition.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus looked at Nigh=\r\ntlight and Elita, a soft look on his face.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then Tuscon&#39;s voice =\r\nboomed through, threatening the Predacons. &quot;SLAG!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus said as he=\r\n glanced back at Elita, &quot;You stay here.&quot; Ramulus said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to =\r\nlock you in and then go see if anything can be done for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me=\r\ndical staff.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus spoke as he quickly gathered up a few med=\r\n packs and a scanner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Danged daft Predacons, causing so much damage.=\r\n&quot; Ramulus grumbled under\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breath. Ramulus was no medic, but =\r\nhe did know a bit about first aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there was something =\r\nhe could so for Santon and Bump who were still lying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the flo=\r\nor of the corridors. Perhaps they were not as . . . hurt as they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look=\r\ned. He couldn&#39;t even bring himself to think of them as dead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wi=\r\nth a last look at Elita he left. The door clicked as he locked it and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the room that Elita was in went silent except for the computer =\r\nmonitors\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were watching over Nightlight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For th=\r\ne moment all was peaceful in the medbay.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However outside the Ar=\r\nk was a very different matter!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord=\r\n and Kup keep their fire against Scourge and Deepstrike\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As the firefight continues Deepstryke took a hit, as did Scourge=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them to break off their attack on the door and swing=\r\n up into the air to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; avoid any further and more critical damage. Sever=\r\nal more of the sweeps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blasted from the skies, the last one=\r\n swinging up next to his master\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Scourge,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; almost as if for prote=\r\nction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Predacons were looking decidedly more damaged and a =\r\nbit more tired\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before. Energon looked to be looking a bit =\r\nlower than before and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from Windlord and Kup were bui=\r\nlding up on them, not to mention the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; firepower\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coming from the =\r\nfuzors as well as Leo II! Yes, the Predacons had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; breached\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the =\r\ndoor, but getting further in would be an uphill battle indeed, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ma=\r\nny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of them did not look to be in the best shape to fight it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Outside, Quickstride quickly gets Up=\r\nroar to his feet, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assesses the situation. He then looks around th=\r\ne parameters and then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remembers a body of goop, that resembled a tar =\r\npit, not far from the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ark&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parameters. Uproar looks to him.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *&lt;SNIP/CUT/PASTE&gt;*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar and Quickstride =\r\nnow approach Deep Stryke and the others with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hands up i=\r\nn submission. Quickstride is the first to approach them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deepstryke hovered in the air as he noticed the two walked towa=\r\nrds him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cannons swiveling to track them when they spoke . =\r\n. .\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, okay, you got us, you got us=\r\n. Why don&#39;t we just show you guys \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy way inta the ark h=\r\nmm? That way we all get what we want and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happy.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You, a Maximal would show a Predacon a way int=\r\no his own fortress?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deepstryke said, obviously not believing the two=\r\n for a moment, and yet \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t shoot at them either. Perhaps=\r\n there was a part of him that WANTED\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe it. Then Hydras=\r\n&#39; call went out to retreat!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Blast you Maximal!&quot; Deepstryke sai=\r\nd as he began to pull back. &quot;NEXT \n&gt; &gt; &gt; TIME\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will breach yo=\r\nur walls and TAKE what we want!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Predacons began to back up=\r\n, moving into the air, slowly moving away\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Ark, even as=\r\n the Ark&#39;s cannons and weaponry began to move and come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; online.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
