Well, \npossibly.  I&#39;m going to try and see Rock Star tomorrow.  Why?  That&#39;s a good \nquestion.\n\nJust a reminder to all, Rock Star starts tomorrow, Friday, September 7th. It \nstars Mark Wahlberg as a heavy metal fan that becomes the lead singer for his \nfavorite metal band, Steel Dragon, and Jennifer Aniston is his hot girlfriend.\n\nIts soundtrack includes Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Motley Crue, and Sammy Hagar \n(the CD soundtrack doesn&#39;t have Def Leppard&#39;s &quot;Animal&quot; though :(, so after \nhearing those four names you know you have to go TO the theatres and WATCH \nthis movie. Then go TO a store and BUY the soundtrack. It has a member of \nDokken in it for crying out loud, and you aren&#39;t at the theatres yet!? Go go \ngo go! I guarantee this movie will not suck, if it does I&#39;ll let you take \nshots at me with a baseball bat.\n\n-Unitron\n\nSeriously, see the movie, with an awesome soundtrack and a great actor like \nWahlberg, it won&#39;t, nay, can&#39;t dissapoint. )\n\n\n"}}
