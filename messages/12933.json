She was \nthinking about the transmission she got from that mysterious bot.  \nShe was now curious about who this Unicron was.  She had questions, \nbut no one to answer them.  She walked along, without noticing where \nshe was going.  She was really walking around the deck in circles.  \nShe past the bridge twice and was about to pass it again.  She wanted \nto know more about this Unicron. Where did he come from? What did he \nwant? why was he even here? Could he be persuaded to talk about \npeace? Was peace still a possablility?  She had lots of questions, \nand no answers.  She just kept walking and thinking.\n\n\n"}}
