And I WHEELIE say we walk away.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He didn&#39;t care for the endless feuding of the factions, he cared for his\n&gt; friends.

Most thought he disappeared into the war effort for the\nDecepticons.&quot; HUN-GRR chuckled, &quot;And working for you he did more for\nthe Decepticon . . . *AHEM* . . .
