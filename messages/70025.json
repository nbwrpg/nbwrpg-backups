With his night vision h=\r\ne spots a main control pannel, and realizes that Scorponok is shooting at h=\r\nim with the plasma cannons, as is Scourge, who is content on trying to fry =\r\nhis carborator.  He remains quiet, yet continues to speed around the room, =\r\nhoping that at least one of them would take the bait.  He wasn&#39;t running sc=\r\nared, he was clearly up to something strategic.  He thinks to himself.\n\n&quot; I=\r\n knew you bozos were stupid enough ta buy inta me.  That&#39;s it, keep shootn&#39;=\r\n my way, eventually I&#39;m gonna make a move toward one of them power boxes an=\r\nd then whoops, someone&#39;s gonna hit somethn&#39; by accident.&quot;\n\nHe sends a silen=\r\nt com to Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; Nightshift reportn&#39; in Sir.  I&#39;m fine, just gettn&#39; =\r\nthe chase of a lifetime in here, nothn&#39; serious.  I got a few dings on the =\r\nfenders but nothn&#39; that can&#39;t be banged out with a hammer.  Look, guys, I a=\r\nin&#39;t found Nightlight, Rodimus or Windlord, but I&#39;m kinda playn&#39; a game of =\r\ncatn&#39; mouse with the baddies.  Hopn&#39; ta get one of them ta mess up&#39;n hit a =\r\npower box by accident, instead of hittn&#39; me... OHHHH SCRAP!&quot;\n\nHe screeches =\r\nloudly as he avoids another close call with a plasma blast.\n\n&quot;That was almo=\r\nst my left front tire, close one.   Anyway, I really could use a hand in he=\r\nre, I dunno how much longer my fuel reserves are gonna hold out.  I&#39;m at ab=\r\nout a half a tank now, and the way I&#39;m gon&#39; here, that ain&#39;t gonna take lon=\r\ng ta go through... Gotta burn rubber, talk later, Nightshift out.&quot;\n\nOutside=\r\n the fortress, Tucson Prime comes out of his trance.  He holds his chest fo=\r\nr just a moment.\n\n&quot;Sorry guys, I didn&#39;t mean to frighten you. I just got qu=\r\nite the wakeup call.  We need to get into that fortress but first we need t=\r\no short out the control pannel that keeps it beneath that magma pool.&quot;\n\nRat=\r\n Trap shrugs.  \n\n&quot;Lord Elder did mention somethn&#39; about blastn&#39; inta the po=\r\nol, but we ain&#39;t got that kinda fire power on us.&quot;\n\nTuscon grins confidentl=\r\ny.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s all right, I do.  Stand back, the first step to bringing light =\r\nto a black flame, is to create a backdraft.  On second thought, I better do=\r\n this in vehicle mode. I can assure your saftey better than being in robot =\r\nmode.&quot;\n\nHe transforms into his missile truck mode, and opens his doors to h=\r\nis cab.\n\n&quot;Lord Elder, I&#39;m back, just needed to consult someone as to my nex=\r\nt move.  It&#39;s my first day on the job as a Prime and I needed a little insi=\r\nde advice.  And I got it.  Kup, I also read you, and I&#39;m going to expidite =\r\nthis mission a bit.  It&#39;s dragged on far too long.  Time for action not bea=\r\nting around the rotary.&quot;\n\nHe lines himself up for the shot and aims both mi=\r\nssile carriers at the pool, targeting not in the center of the pool, but a =\r\nslight before getting to the middle of the magma chamber.  Rat Trap and Qui=\r\nckstride buckle in, to anticipate the major kick back Tucson&#39;s missile laun=\r\nchers may have.  Then, Tucson fires, as they kick back, causing him to lurc=\r\nh backward slightly as he gets used to firing them at the same time.\n\n&quot;Ughh=\r\n, felt that.. Are you two okay?&quot;\n\nRat Trap is now on top of Quickstride, wh=\r\no is now looking to the control pannel.\n\n&quot;Umm, we&#39;re - okay.. Just a little=\r\n - bit shell shocked.  Wowwww...  Talk about kick back...  It wasn&#39;t like y=\r\na didn&#39;t warn us because ya did but we weren&#39;t expecting that...&quot;\n\nRat Trap=\r\n rubs his head.\n\n&quot;Yeah, talk about the big bang theory.&quot;\n\nTucson rolls forw=\r\nard just a slight.\n\n&quot; It even kicked me back a few feet.  I have to learn t=\r\no ground my tires when I use those missiles.  Sorry about that.&quot;\n\nRat Trap =\r\ngets back into his seat and buckles up.\n\n&quot;So, how are we gonna get through =\r\nthis?\n\nTucson parks himself safely waiting for the results of his launch.\n\n=\r\n&quot; We&#39;re going to relight the dark flame.  I have the power within me, the p=\r\nower of the Matrix.  The dark flame, represents Rodimus, who&#39;s armor is bla=\r\nck as pitch and flaming paint job dimmed to a drap pale color.  That&#39;s the =\r\nfire I need to rekindle.&quot;\n\nRat Trap gasps as does Quickstride.\n\n&quot;But Wheels=\r\n, that might that might do a number on ya.&quot;\n\nTuscon sighs.\n\n&quot; I know Rat Tr=\r\nap, it will.  I&#39;ll still be a Prime no matter what happens, but if all goes=\r\n well, we will get Rodimus back and Cyclonus will pay for his deeds against=\r\n Primus.  It&#39;s worth the risk my friends, it&#39;s worth the risk.&quot;\n\nRat Trap s=\r\nheds a tear.\n\n&quot;But but what if it kills ya? What&#39;s Talon gonna do without y=\r\na?  What am I gonna do without ya? Wheels, you&#39;re the only real friend I ev=\r\ner did have.  I don&#39;t wanna lose ya.&quot;\n\nTucson could feel a tear drip on his=\r\n dashboard.  \n\n&quot; I promise you Rat Trap, neither Talon or you is going to l=\r\nose me that easilly.  I may be out of commission for a few days, but it&#39;s n=\r\not going to kill me. Remember when we talked about the most powerful force =\r\nin the universe?  How nothing could ever surpass that?&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;=\r\n I think so.  Ya told me that love is a force no one can reckon with.  Noth=\r\ning breaks the bond of friendship no matter how powerful evil becomes.  Lov=\r\ne knows no boundaries and is the only infinite force that keeps on living e=\r\nven when one has passed on long ago.&quot;\n\nTucson gently straps Rat Trap in mor=\r\ne securely.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right Rat Trap.  Remember that.  It&#39;s our bond as frie=\r\nnds that can never be broken.  All of us, including Talon, Elita, Kup, Lord=\r\n Elder, Depthcharge, Lord Perseus, Legacy, Guardia, and Ravenchief have the=\r\n power within ourselves not because of tyranical strength, but because of t=\r\nhat one thing that neither Hydras, Megatron or Galvatron ever had.  And tha=\r\nt was True Love.  They rule with force, not with compassion.  Our heart is =\r\nwhat is going to win us this battle, our hearts are going to come together =\r\nas one and we will save those that need to be saved, and rekindle the light=\r\ns that have nearly been blown out.&quot;\n\nHe starts up his engines.\n\n&quot; NOW, LET&#39;=\r\nS DO THIS!  FOR RODIMUS PRIME!&quot;\n\nRat Trap and Quickstride join in.\n\n&quot;FOR RO=\r\nDIMUS PRIME, LEADER OF THE AUTOBOTS!&quot;\n\nTucson fires several more rounds int=\r\no the magma.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We must take out Nightshift, perhaps if we overcharge the Blackfort=\r\nress circuits we can araise it, our main focus is Rescue nightshift if we c=\r\nan capture Rodimus, Nighlight and or windlord will be a bonus... it must be=\r\n done from inside&quot;Kup open a com link to Nightshift and said &quot;Nightshift do=\r\n you copy?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Preston Carroll \n&gt; Sent: Saturday, April 10, 2010=\r\n 6:12 PM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: BlackFortress\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n   \n&gt; Who: LORD ELDER\n&gt; Location: The Ark - Command center\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;We will =\r\nbe risking as well Rodimus, Windlord and Nightlight &quot;Said Kup by comlink&quot;If=\r\n only we know where are they... is the only way to araise the blackFortress=\r\n?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder nodded sadly as he received the transmission, &quot;You&#39;re right, =\r\nit\n&gt; might hurt the folks we&#39;re trying to rescue.&quot; He sighed slightly as he=\r\n\n&gt; continued, &quot;By training I am a guardian and sentinel, not the soldiers\n&gt;=\r\n and tactical specialists that you are.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He shrugged, clearly at a los=\r\ns as to how to help, &quot;Perhaps you can\n&gt; find a way to dig?
