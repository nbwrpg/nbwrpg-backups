He saw the Oblitercons,  \njumping to the side, he avoided being trampled.  A voice cried several \nmoments later.\n\n&quot;Hey, Punch is it?  The Alliance is retreating!  Get back to base, quick!  \nBefore them Maxis hunt us down!&quot;\n\nPunch looked up, seeing Nemesis Enforcer flying away in his large bat mode.  \nSeeing Zardus following soon, he continued to hop, though towards the \nAlliance base, the same slagging place he had just come from.\n\n===\n\nManterror, Injector, and Double Punch, saw from a cliff the Maximals and the \nArk.  Activating the com, Double Punch spoke.  \n\n&lt;Hell Beast, it&#39;s Double Punch.  I&#39;m looking at the Ark, and it is slagged.  \nThe Maximals are looking like they&#39;re all going to fall over and die.  It&#39;ll \ntake them a few weeks to repair this!  All the raw materials needed.  They&#39;d \nneed an alliance!  Maybe they&#39;re gonna ally with the Alliance?  What are your \norders?  Shall Manterror, Injector, and myself stay here and spy, or do you \nneed us for something else, Hell Beast?&gt;\n\n"}}
