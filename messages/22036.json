I was knew an intelligent\nperson, but he stole something from me and I chopped his head off with a\nstick. That wasn&#39;t a threat, I am just telling you some of my stories. Once,\nI made this stupid kid cry, you see, I killed his parents, because I was\nasked to by a boss of mine, and he cried. I was so annoyed I told him and\nthe rest of his family that I would come back and kill them. I thought about\nit and did go back to kill them, but they had already left, it was a bummer,\nit would have been pretty fun to shut that little brat up. And that damned\ncranky old man! So, what&#39;s your name? I&#39;m Burning Hammer, but you can call\nme...Burning Hammer! Ahahahaaaa!! Yeah, I&#39;m funny...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Rudra656@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, November 24, 2000 10:11 PM\nSubject: Re: Assassin and Llama\n\n\n&gt; ::Lambda::\n&gt;     &quot;I understand completely.
