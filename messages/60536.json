Anyway, here it is:\n&gt; \n&gt; With my school year drawing to a close, I&#39;m considering coming \nback \n&gt; for the summer. I have a suggestion though for a new faction \n(please \n&gt; note, this will for a while at least be a one man faction). I need \n&gt; council approval though, and to know how much they can do. Here it \n&gt; is: \n&gt; \n&gt; All these being have some ability to predict the future, they \n&gt; increase this by stealing the &quot;hero/villan potential&quot; from various \n&gt; subjects who had the potential to be heros/villans (also killing \nthe \n&gt; subjects, but you have to immobilize them for a few minutes). \n&gt; \n&gt; Their leader is named Seer. He supposedly cannot die, but he never \n&gt; come to earth so he&#39;s a none factor. All his minions are required \nto \n&gt; give some of their stolen hero/villan potential to him, and he has \n&gt; incredible power, he also gives each of his servants a prophesy \n&gt; telling some detail of their deaths to help delay it. \n&gt; \n&gt; The reason they send their minions to earth (only one at a time, \n&gt; which is why it&#39;s one man, they don&#39;t want to do to much damage), \nis \n&gt; because over millions of years the change caused by someone with \n&gt; even a small bit of hero/villan potential is incredible, so the \n&gt; potential they can steal is almost limitless. They give their \n&gt; servants a target before sending them back. \n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t thought out all the details, but the first minion would \nbe \n&gt; named Fortuneteller (a female), and her prophesy would be: \n&gt; \n&gt; So long as you pay the Seer&#39;s price, no Transmetal will take your \n&gt; life (so long as you give Seer his fair share of the potential you \n&gt; steal no transmetal will kill you). \n&gt; \n&gt; He also has a council of three other powerful members of his \n&gt; faction, who will die, but share a prophecy of their death: \n&gt; \n&gt; One will die by fire, one by ice, and the last must perish thrice \n&gt; (essentially one will die, but his/her spark will return to Seer \nfor \n&gt; a new body, after which one will die by fire, then the first will \n&gt; die again, but the same thing will happen, then one will die by \nice, \n&gt; then the first will die and stay dead, but they don&#39;t know which \nis \n&gt; which and won&#39;t chance it putting themselves in danger). \n&gt; \n&gt; So I want to know how much prescience I&#39;m allowed? How can that \n&gt; effect the game? And is it o.k. to dictate how my characters can \ndie \n&gt; (they can still have the crap beaten out of them, but they can&#39;t \nbe \n&gt; destroyed any other way).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to draw attention to the message board, and the \n&gt; &gt; message \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I posted there at least a week ago.\n\n\n"}}
