She changed \nher mind, Serpentor would have to do. He was damaged, so that meant that he \nwould be less of a fight. She charged back at him, baring her jagged teeth \nas she flew at the two. She screamed and throwing her foot out just in case \nKoga decided to protect him. She grabbed  Serpentor by the back armor, \nholding to him tight. She lifted him up and headed for the forest.\n\n&quot;You and I are going to have a talk about Megatron!&quot; she said to him. She \nthen lowered her head to him and shouted shrilly. &quot;And I am not an Autobot! \nI am a Predacon!&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
