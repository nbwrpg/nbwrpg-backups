At the same time he raises his neck for =\r\nanother\n&gt; look around.  Then his head is swung ahead facing northward once =\r\nagain.  His\n&gt; long tail snaps at the ground beneath him, taking out what re=\r\nmains of the\n&gt; dinosaur bones, smashing them to splinters.  It felt good to=\r\n roar, it helped\n&gt; to release trapped emotions that had built up over time.=\r\n  Certainly Rodimus\n&gt; was trying his patience and it was a good method of n=\r\not lashing out at him\n&gt; which would have been a grave mistake.  He continue=\r\ns to wait for the Fuzors\n&gt; to arrive.  He thinks to himself as he does.\n\n&lt;N=\r\nEW&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON waited for the Maximal fuzors the other Predacons seemed to\n=\r\ngive him a wide berth. DEEPSTRYKE continued to hover into the air far\nabove=\r\n, his sensors probing over the dinosaurs, the Predacons and the\nMaximals, m=\r\nissing very little.\n\nThe predacons that could fly were still hover over the=\r\n dinosaurs just\nwatching the flames, their fire and heat doing all the work=\r\n of\ndestroying the dinosaur flesh. However the work was slow gooing and\nthe=\r\n Predacons were begining to mumble.\n\n&quot;This is burning up my heat exchanger.=\r\n&quot; One said.\n\nAnother said, &quot;Yeah along with all our fuel reserves.&quot;\n\nThere =\r\nwas a pause as others began mumbling something similar all under\ntheir brea=\r\nth.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Straightshot&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Till all are one.   I most certainly hope=\r\n you&#39;re right about this,Primus.\n&gt; Our lives depend on your theory.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Me=\r\nanwhile, having been above in Waspinator&#39;s grasp, Straight Shot could\n&gt; act=\r\nually sense some good attributes in him if there were any to be sensed.\n&gt; A=\r\nlthough they could never be allies she still could sense something positive=\r\n\n&gt; about him.  His sense of sticking to things even if he didn&#39;t like doing=\r\n\n&gt; them, was admirable and she felt he should be complemented.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Waspin=\r\nator, look I know you hate me with a passion and you aren&#39;t exactly\n&gt; on my=\r\n friends list but I want you to know that I really admire your loyalty\n&gt; to=\r\nward this mission and having the tolerance to work with an enemy bot.\n&gt; You=\r\n&#39;re doing a really good job, keep it up.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWASPINATOR flies a little=\r\n higher as his wings buzz, &quot;Waspinator is\nbetter than dumb Maximals!&quot; he sa=\r\nys as he scans over the dinosaur\nremains. &quot;But sometimes some Maximals do h=\r\nave a good point.&quot;\n\nIn his glee over STRAIGHTSHOT&#39;s comment WASPINATOR almo=\r\nst dropped her,\nbut then buzzed down to catch her. &quot;Sorry.&quot; he said sheepis=\r\nhly before\nflying on.\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Elita&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita paled and slight shaken q=\r\nhen Sourge was around and she asked in low\n&gt; voice to  Nightshift =93do you=\r\n think that scourge eats little kittens?=94\n&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Nightshift&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nig=\r\nhtshift keeps tabs on Scourge, being sure he keeps his distance.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Good=\r\n question, I think we better keep tabs on him.  Know&#39;n that slagball,\n&gt; he&#39;=\r\ns look&#39;n ta stir up some trouble.  But I don&#39;t think he eats kittens.&quot;\n\n&lt;NE=\r\nW&gt;\n\nSCOURGE chuckled as he looked down on NIGHTSHIFT, his powerful sensors\n=\r\ndesinged for tracking fleeing prey and searching for Maximals were\neasily a=\r\nble to pick up on the conversation. &quot;I have no designs on such\na little Max=\r\nimal. There would be no sport in it.&quot;\n\nStill in his hover craft mode SCOURG=\r\nE just ahead, watching the\nterrain. &quot;One would think that such a young thin=\r\ng would not be out\nhere in such a dangerous place.&quot; SCOURGE&#39;s words were no=\r\nt precisly\ncaring as much as they were the words of a pure predator. There =\r\nwas\nnothing specifically dangerous in them, but the tone indicated that\nmay=\r\nbe there was.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; hYDRAS hissed anoyed and said =93What a=\r\n waste of power, this saberback could\n&gt; have done a better use of his skill=\r\ns=94\n&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson looks to Hydras,with a sarcastic expres=\r\nsion.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If you think you can do better, be my guest.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW - Fractyl&gt;\n\n=\r\nA Predacon, his IFF signature identifying him as FRACTYL came flying\nup to =\r\nthe area, from the southwest, his beast mode was a greenish\ncolored Pterano=\r\ndon. He flew over a few of the closer dinosaurs and\nbegan spraying them wit=\r\nh some sort of caustic liquid. More smoke and\nblack smoke rose from them, b=\r\nut the affect was that the creatures\nbegan to melt as they were hit.\n\n&quot;Hydr=\r\nas!&quot; FRACTLY said excitedly over his comlink. &quot;I think I have\nanother, fast=\r\ner way to rid ourselves of these deceased reptiles.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
