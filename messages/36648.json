Quickly one wing wraped \ninfront of him while the other massive wing outstrethches and took \nthe five blasts fired at Trinity, the other eight blasts being taken \nby the the other wing. The wings then move behind him as his fists \nglow a bright green before he sends a massive blast of matrix energy \nat Virgo, which would be really bad if it hit since matrix energy \ndoesnt exactly react well with pit energy.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;*Orchid*&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Why wouldn&#39;t Trinity know why she&#39;s weak?
