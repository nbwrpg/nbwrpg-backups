He turns to Killfest, and over his comlink speaks &quot;we need to\nget in there to check what is going on, we will let Astroblast check it\nout, we&#39;ll keep them busy. He then turns to Liono, &quot;Now Maximal, feel the\nanger of a Decepticon, and he swings towards his enemy. As he move he\nsilently on a different frequency from everyone, so no one else  could\nnormally hear it (unless they intercept) &quot;Astroblast, I will keep them\nbusy, get on the ark and find our target. If it&#39;s not there look through\nTeletran&#39;s datatracks to find it.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
