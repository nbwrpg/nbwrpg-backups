On the monitors she \nsaw Quickstrike and Megatron, but the monitor with the rodent on it just \nshowed the hatch, she was gone.\n    &quot;Damn it! I know there up to something.....especially that rat.&quot; She \nhissed.\n    \n    Adrax entered the room with the transport. It was a fine ship and would \ncertianly aid them in the extermination of the Maximals. But, for the moment, \nhe was ease-dropping on the conversation between Megatron and Black Aracnia \nvia a deflector dish stationed on top of the lair.\n    &quot;If negotiations go well then the Predacons will be unstoppable! And \nmabey you, Autofire, could lead the Predacons. We will wait and see. Right \nnow things are far to sensitive to barge in and make demands.&quot;\n\n"}}
