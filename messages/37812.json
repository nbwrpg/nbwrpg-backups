I may post while i am there \nif i can but I am leaving all my autobots and chivtrons to rAuq. \nRdahl, if you may, take care of the D.E.D members and FireStrike.  I \nwill make sure to inform you guys if I will post while i am there, so \nas not to confuse Jer.  \n\nHere it goes....\n\n::Grounded/Seekker/FireStrike/JetV/Crotale/Repugnus/Slag/Dreadwind/ \nDarkwing/Needlenose/Scrapper/Quake/Havotron::\n\nGrounded smiled at Nightlight. &quot;Yes, Nightlight please do. Then \ngather Windlord and Aerotaur and get them to meet me in the \nConference Room.&quot; Grounded walked to the conference room.\n\nSeekker continued to balst his engine as Axis pulled the pod back.\n\nFireStrike looked at Nightstrike with hate in his \neyes.  &quot;Nightstrike, quit your bickering to Megatron, you will simply \ndistract him.  He is a great leader and will not need our help.  Not \nshut up and stand to attention, for when Megatron defeats this \nweakling.&quot;\n\nJetV looked to the controls of the ship.  Hitting a button the engins \nfired up kicking flame back 20 meters out of the rear \nengines.  &quot;Pacifix, the engines are warmed up and ready to go.&quot;\n\nCrotale felt the surge as the engines started the plasma flow through \nthe engine.  They were almost gone then he could show himelf to his \nbest friend.\n\nRepugnus let out a small smile as the ship surged.  Finally he \nthought &#39; maybe there will be others like me&#39;.\n\nSlag smiled at his leader.  &quot;Yes,  Ironhide make bots weak.  Dinobots \nlike us make bots strong.&quot;\n\nDreadwind and Darkwing arrived at a Energon Pub called Jer&#39;s Jome \nPub.  They walked in and looked around.  All seemed to be Ex-\nDeceptiocons from the Great War.  \nDreadwind spoke.  &quot;All Decepticons.  The ship to finish the Autobots \nas they leave is complete.  And Decepticons still wishing to fight \nunder the greatest leader Cybertron has ever seen, Havotron, speak \nnow.&quot;\nDarkwing mumbled out &quot; or don&#39;t, then die!&quot;\n\nOne bot at the side stood. Clearly overenergized and stumbling into \nthings announced &quot;I will, a huiuiuc.....fight for Havotruiiic..up&quot;  \nHe stumbled over to Darkwing and Dreadwind and fell on the ground. \n\nDarkwing said &quot;Grab him. We will use him.&quot;\n\n&quot;where is Apeface?&quot; Dreadwind asked.  &quot;We need to find Sluggy and get \nout of here.&quot;  They waited for Apeface to catch up.\n\nNeedlenose flew into the ship dockyard.  The ship was huge and filled \nwith weapons.  &quot;Wow.&quot;\n\nHavotron came in behind.  &quot;Spinister.  Gather the D.E.D.  I will make \nmy leadeer speech now for we will be leaving momentarly.  Needlenose. \nGo start the engines.&quot;\n\n&quot;umm, how exactly will i do that sir?&quot; he asked. \n\n&quot;FIND OUT&quot; Havotron yelled .  Needlenose ran into the ship looking \nfor the control center.\n\nScrapper saw Needlenose. &quot;Something I can help you with.&quot;\n\nNeedle explained what he had to do.  Scrapper turned around and \ntouched a wall panel.  The panel opend and inside was the control \ncenter. &quot;This is the most defensible base ship ever made&quot; he \nexplained. &quot;To one who did not know, the ship would justseem like al \nong hallway.  &quot;\nWith the touch of a button the engines roared to life.\n\nHavotron waited unpatietnly for the rest of his D.E.D members to \ngather.\n\nOOC:Rdahl and rAuq. I will send a email with my master plans to \noverthrow Yanshosh Incorporated and take my rightful seat as ruler of \nthe free world. I mean, umm, you know the rpg plans. yea thats it. \nummm yea... Quick security kill them, don&#39;t let my secret out.\n\n\n"}}
