He ducked close to the wall to\n&gt; make\n&gt; &gt; himself a smaller target. He scanned for autoguns and when he found\n&gt; thier\n&gt; &gt; location. Quickly transforming to bot mode  he slid a series of\n&gt; mirror chips\n&gt; &gt; across the floor.(Another thief trick I learned in other RPGs) Each\n&gt; chip\n&gt; &gt; would identify itself as him so the autoguns wouldn&#39;t get a lock on\n&gt; him. He\n&gt; &gt; knew he&#39;d screwed up, letting his curiosity get the best of him. He\n&gt; knew he\n&gt; &gt; was safe though, Curiosity only kills cats, and he&#39;s a fox.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;DarkMouse::\n&gt; &gt; She still held the gun at close range at FoxFinger. She knew the\n&gt; &gt; autoguns were on him.  She smiled. &quot;You know, your either very\n&gt; smart,\n&gt; &gt; or very stupid. Your in KitKat&#39;s base now.
