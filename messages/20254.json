He looks at her snout \non his shoulder, his eyes melting into a look of love. He loved her, \nno matter what form she was in.\n\nNodding, Prowl walks to the side of Iron Raptor, mounting her again. \nHe leans down, kissing her before whispering into her ear: &quot;I love \nyou, no matter what form you are in.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; * Iron Raptor watches Prowl jump from her back and walk over to the \npod, her \n&gt; pradictions right at the lack of movement.\n&gt; It was a blank, a protoform without a spark.\n&gt; She sighed, disappointed as well as Prowl. The Maximal forces could \nhave \n&gt; used another player in this war, but it was just as well. One less \nsoul \n&gt; which would be damned to fight a war on a losing side. One less \nspark to \n&gt; join the Matrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor them looked off across the plain, the large orange sun \njust \n&gt; touching the horizon.\n&gt; She stepped towards the sun, the direction of the Ark.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We had better get moving then...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then turned and looked over at Prowl, seeing the stump of his \nwing, \n&gt; wondering about just when he had ripped it off.\n&gt; She sidled up beside him and nudged his shoulder with her snout, \nconcern \n&gt; obviouse in her voice.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You alright?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She made a rough purring sound, cross betqeen a soft snarl and a \nlow \n&gt; growl, her snout pressed to the back of Prowls shoulder, the only \nreal \n&gt; action of affection since she had taken this twist in life.*\n\n\n"}}
