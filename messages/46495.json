Everyday you post crap on NBWRPG!  Be warned, everybody!  Now \nthat I&#39;m back, there&#39;s No Way Out!  Oh, and I hope nobody has a \nproblem with my latest transformer...\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:   \n&gt; \n&gt; An oasis lay in a hot, arid desert in Africa.  Now, this wasn&#39;t any \nold oasis.  Oh no, this oasis was different.  Something was ready to \nrise up.  The sky in the desert started to turn into a dark, twilight \npurple.  The water of the oasis started slowly turning, but then it \ngrew into a violent, raging swirl.  The sky grew grimmer and grimmer. \n A forceful wind swept across the wind, and tore the two trees at the \noasis right out of the ground.  And finally, WHAM!  A huge bolt of \nlightning struck the water!  The water stopped swirling, and the wind \nstopped as well.  The sky went back to it&#39;s sunny self.  Everything \nwas quiet.  It was quiet, however, until the ground started rumbling. \n Suddenly, there was a huge explosion, and water and sand flew \neverywhere!  And once the dust settled, there was flames in the empty \noasis, and in the flames was a large robot.......a transformer.  The \ntransformer&#39;s plating was all red, and on his chest and legs, there \nwere the shape of flames coloured black.  The transformer&#39;s left arm \nwas not red, however, and was just silver.  The transformer&#39;s face was \nred with black stripes going diagonally downward to the left.  On his \nright hand, he had a strange black glove, and on the left hand, a \nblack wrist guard thing.  The transformer walked out of the fire, and \npulled his glove down.  Then, the transformer slowly said, &quot;I \nam........Kane.......&quot;\n\n\n"}}
