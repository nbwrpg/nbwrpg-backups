And it was \nobvious with the damage she had. \n\nShe walked the edge of the forest, heading back to the Predacon cave. \nAgainst the quiet of the ambient, she heard a wolf howl. It was a \ndeep-voiced wolf, and possible very large. It was at a distance, but \nshe sensed something different from it. It revealed to her that it \nwas not just an ordanary wolf. It was a wolf-bot, like the she-wolf \nback at base. \n\nThis wolf, she could tell was not the Predacon she-wolf, but the \nmissing Rowdy Wolf. She felt the danger from him, and the sorrow. \n\n~No,~ she said to herself and bolted as fast as she could to the \nPredacon cave. At the entrace of it, she called: ~He&#39;s here! He&#39;s out \nthere!~ She sent that image of Rowdy Wolf from the source of little \nQuickstrike&#39;s mind, and shaped it differently, as a darker figure, \nand a more colder face.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
