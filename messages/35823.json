She searched\n&gt; through her DNA samples and decided to use Scorpion and Snake DNA fused with\n&gt; theAlien DNA Zardus had provided. A small pool of DNA sat before her,\n&gt; already beginning to grow. Much like Doctor Frankenstein she was creating a\n&gt; monster and didn&#39;t even know it.\n\n\n"}}
