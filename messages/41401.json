This is just as well, as the Decepticon war machine\n&gt; wouldnt have a clue as to what pressure means. He continues to look\n&gt; around, but not with curiosity, for he is not intelligent enough for\n&gt; such an emotion. He is simply looking for anything that could be\n&gt; considered hostile, as his massive frame finally reaches the ocean\n&gt; floor. He takes one plodding step forwards, then another, causing the\n&gt; ocean floor to first rumble, then on one step to crack, as he moves\n&gt; towards the signal his computers provide him with.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of the aquatic life down here has never seen anything like it, a\n&gt; creature causing such a great disturbance, as things scramble out of\n&gt; Abominus&#39; way. It dosent matter however, as Abominus dosent notice it,\n&gt; there is no spark in his eyes to show he knows what is happening around\n&gt; him, he just notices one fish, that isnt leaving. Abominus stops moving,\n&gt; and begins to speak. &quot;Grrrrrrrr.......what......do?&quot; he asks.\n\n\n"}}
