Good idea, there may be a =\r\nneed for some backup.\n&gt; Okay, we better get going.  Waspinator, I&#39;ll have t=\r\no be in alt mode for the\n&gt; mission, due to the fact that my sensors are mor=\r\ne adept in cross bow form.\n&gt; I will calibrate to your physical specs so tha=\r\nt way I&#39;m easier to work with\n&gt; and lighter on your arms.  I have a laser b=\r\neacon on the end of the launch\n&gt; bed.  When that flashes, it&#39;s locked onto =\r\nsomething.  The faster it flashes\n&gt; the closer we are.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She transforms =\r\ninto alt mode and lands into Waspinator&#39;s hands, surprisingly\n&gt; weighing ve=\r\nry little as she calibrates herself to fit his hands.  The beacon\n&gt; begins =\r\nto flash slowly, pointing north.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWASPINATOR caught STRAIGHT SHOT aw=\r\nkwardly, being that he was flying\naround with everyone in insect mode, but =\r\nwith two spindly legs he held\non to her and flew around. &quot;What is it that a=\r\nrrow bot has locked on\nto?&quot; WASPINATOR said curiously as he tried to orient=\r\n the weapon. &quot;I\ndon&#39;t see anything?&quot;\n\nHe tried to look more carefully, his =\r\nbig insect eyes glittering as he tried.\n\nMeanwhile SCOURGE and his sweeps s=\r\nurrounded WASPINATOR as they began\nto fly in the direction that the Dinosau=\r\nrs had come.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson acknowledges Leo Prime with a cal=\r\nm look on his face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Of course, Leo Prime.  I will be careful.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He=\r\n turns to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I think it&#39;s best that you and Cyclonus work toget=\r\nher, since you seem to\n&gt; be on the same wavelength.  Cyclonus, see what you=\r\n two can come up with as\n&gt; far as gathering intel.  If you wouldn&#39;t mind, w=\r\ne would highly benefit from\n&gt; the help of the Seekers. They can move far fa=\r\nster than I can.  And at this\n&gt; moment we are severely pressed for time.&quot; I=\r\nntel is going to be the most\n&gt; important aspect of how our strategy plays o=\r\nut. Without it, we really can\n&gt; not plan anything further.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks ou=\r\nt at the rising smoke and grimaces at the acrid smell of burning\n&gt; flesh.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &quot; Talon, Hydras, I suggest we meet Leo Prime on the ground and hear what=\r\n he\n&gt; may suggest we do next.  Remember, unity is our best weapon now.&quot;\n\n&lt;N=\r\nEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Unity? With them?&quot; RODIMUS grunted. He was still sitting on TUSCON&#39;s\n=\r\nback as he  looked over at CYCLONUS as CYCLONUS hovered in his robot\nmode l=\r\nooking back, neither seemed to like the idea of working\ntogether. &quot;I have t=\r\no work with him, and you with Hydras, Primus help\nus.&quot; RODIMUS whispered to=\r\n TUSCON, &quot;Maybe we should have just shot at\nthem when we had the chance.&quot;\n\n=\r\nTUSCON get&#39;s a call from WING CALIBER, LEO PRIME&#39;s tactical assistant\n&quot;Perh=\r\naps it is not the best idea to pull all the Maximals from the\nArk. Remember=\r\n there are still escaped criminals about, and we cannot\nforget Unicron&#39;s mi=\r\nnions still here too. We cannot leave the Ark\nundefended.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras=\r\n & Talon&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras Hissed annoyed by the idea to have a meeting with more=\r\n maximal, but\n&gt; the situation requires to do some stuff, he followed Tucson=\r\n and he said to\n&gt; the Maximal dragon=93What do you bet that before we reali=\r\nze Rodimus and\n&gt; Cyclonus will in the other=92s neck? It was hard to made t=\r\nhem work together...\n&gt; Skyshadow, come with me=94\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon followed Tucson=\r\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSKY SHADOW, who was also in his strange looking beast mode nodded =\r\nhis\nreptillian head and flew over to HYDRAS, his wasp like wings buzzing\nlo=\r\nudly. , &quot;Of course sir.&quot; His voice was syrupy sweet, almost too\nsweet. It w=\r\nas the voice of a trained state&#39;s man a politician who had\nlearned the art =\r\nof war, a dangerous combination indeed - for friend\nand foe alike.\n\nHe gave=\r\n TUSCON and RODIMUS a disdainful look but said nothing except\nto HYDRAS.  &quot;=\r\nI and my Fuzors are yours to command.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
