He then aims his charge launcher at Hellpeon and fires \nfour \n&gt; charges.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Incarcinator continues to fly up, dodging several blasts and firing \na \n&gt; shot at the Trainer base (very fast, explosive shell). His gaining \n&gt; altitude allowed him to see most shots and dodge them before they \ngot \n&gt; close. Aiming at Hellpeon, Incarcinator fires two more shells at \nhim.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Demise continues to run, several autogun blasts denting the armor \non \n&gt; his back. He jumps behind a hill for cover, wishing that someone \n&gt; would exit the ship so that he could tear them apart.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; They&#39;d be able to detect footprints in the sand unless he&#39;s \nflying \n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;d only be able to guess where he&#39;d be.\n\n\n"}}
