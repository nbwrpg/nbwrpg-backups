The lizard crawled from his cavern\n&gt; and watched as the bots retrned. Drill bit, apocalypse, hell beast,\ncerberus,\n&gt; killfest,  zardus.... all supplied dna to begin his perfect body. The bots\n&gt; entered him. The lizard glowed. It grew into a cacoon. It hovered in the\nair.\n&gt; The glow was so bright it could be seen from miles around. All it needed\nwas\n&gt; that burst of energy it needed to finish the transformation. Clouds\ncovered\n&gt; the area. The glow of the egg grew brighter drawing the storm. A bolt of\n&gt; lighting shot the egg. It craked. Out came a bot long since forgotten. His\n&gt; robot mode finished. He had the hard shelled armor of zardus. The eyes of\n&gt; Killfest. He had cerberus&#39;s tatical ability&#39;s in his head. He had\n&gt; apocalypse&#39;s dragon mode. And he had Drill bit&#39;s drill mode. He had hell\n&gt; beast&#39;s evil desire for death and destruction. (like he needs more.)  He\nhad\n&gt; no expression on his face. His desire to become his perfect form was\ndrawing\n&gt; him on now. He had his list that he needed to finish. He locked on his\nfirst\n&gt; target. He wanted his ultimate beast mode form. And his assasin skills to\nbe\n&gt; fully restored and to do so his first two victims where perfect for it. He\n&gt; must absorb them. he took off. His speed made a deep gash it the ground as\nhe\n&gt; flew.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
