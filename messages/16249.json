The panel then stops \nflickering.  She lays in the pod motionless.  Then her hand clentches \ninto a fist, then relaxes.  She slowly opens her eyes. She feels the \ncool air rush over her as the outside breeze picks up.  She moves her \neyes and sees Rattrap standing there.  She looked and then closed her \neyes.  She slowly sat up.  She then opened her eyes and looked at \nRattrap.  She didn&#39;t speak, just looked at him with a curious \nexpression on her face.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Rattrap:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap watched as the hatch of the pod opened, but nothing came \nout \n&gt; the way it suppose to. He pinned his ears to the side and leaned up \n&gt; to the side of the pod and looked inside. A female layed inside of \nit \n&gt; unconscious. \n&gt; \n&gt; He looked around, then back to Squizzy. &quot;I could never get these \n&gt; things. Why can&#39;t dis one pop open like they supposed ta?&quot; He \nsighed.\n\n\n"}}
