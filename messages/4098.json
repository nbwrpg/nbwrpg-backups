Artist cartwheeled through the door\nand Dracona thought about that cartwheel, only Suukie was that energetic.\nDracona walked inside. The 3 last remaining members of the Radicons walked\ninside the base. Stronghold and Scamrock set up a tent in the woods, when\nsuddenly Arrow walked in. Arrow sat next to them.\n\n&quot;Hi guys, what&#39;s up?&quot; Arrow asked. Scamrcok and Stronghold laughed. Arrow\nplayed cards with them, but he didn&#39;t know how to play, so of course\nScamrock and Stronghold ripped him off.\n\n&quot;Damn, I always lose!&quot; Arrow said.\n\n&quot;I have an idea, we can be the soltitudes! Scamrock and Stronghold!&quot;\nScamrock said. Arrow rooled his eyes to each of them.\n\n&quot;How about Scamrock, Stronghold, and Arrow.&quot; Arrow said. Stronghold and\nScamrock laughed and opened another couple of beers...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Iron Raptor&quot; &lt;ironraptor13@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, June 21, 2000 6:01 PM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor had heard the snapping sounds when Prowl had hit the ground,\nthe sounds had caused her to cringe with the sickening tone of\nthem...obviously something was going to be broken after hearing something.\n&gt; The pained look on his face as he had stood up beside a boulder made her\ncome closer to him to see just how damaged he was, her own side bleeding\nlike the Pit and feeling just as bad.\n&gt; Hearing him announce that he was alright when she knew that he wasn&#39;t she\nwalked up to him and put a hand on his side, by moving her hand along his\nside she soon felt the movement of the broken ribs and counted how many were\ndamaged.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re anything BUT fine, Prowl. You have six broken ribs and if not\ntreated can puncture you spark in no time...killing you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then looked over his shoulder and saw his damaged wing, the hole in\nit now seen by her and then knowing why they had crashed. Iron Raptor\nreached back to take his wing in her hands but it was far enough back that\nshe literally had to lean on him just to reach the wing, once in her grasp\nshe then saw that it was snapped in the same joint as before but then\nsnapped it back into place. Thinking about how he should get that joint\nreinforced so that this wouldn&#39;t happen again. As she leaned against him and\nlooking at his wing she answered his question.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No, I&#39;m no better then you. Just as damaged and just as sore, seems to\nbe the latest trend these days.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Once she then smoother out the joint she then leaned back and looked him\nstraight in the optics, smiling when she suddenly thought that he really was\nhandsome and was the right bot for her but how he could also be a real klutz\nsometimes. But then again, she was no queen of grace either.\n&gt; Iron Raptor then wiped away a bit of mech fluid from her cheek, knowing\nthat the battle was over but feeling the need that they all needed a CR\nchamber.\n&gt; She took his hand in hers and faced the Ark, the obvious sing that they\nneeded to get going.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; The battle&#39;s over and the Alliance is gone, let&#39;s go and get repaired\nnow, huh?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that she then opened her com-link to all Maximals frequencies, it\nwas time to pack it in if Liono hadn&#39;t already given the order.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Attention all Maximals, the battle is now over...head back to base and\nget yourselves repaired.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that she then looked towards the base but then back at Prowl,\ngiving a little tug on his hand for them to get a move on.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
