He speeds up, heading straight at Timeshyft, and then suddenly\n&gt;transforms, diving at him but ready to twist to avoid gunfire. While\n&gt;diving, he keeps firing from his wings, which were now on his back.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Azure The Warrior&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Timeshyft, just after firing the eight ferrous iron from his gauss\n&gt;rifle,\n&gt; &gt; reloaded his weapon. If he could just maul the autobot, and then go\n&gt;away,\n&gt; &gt; the pain he would cause would be enough to satisfy him. That, on\n&gt;the other\n&gt; &gt; hand, was easier said than done. Jetfire was renowned to be one of\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; toughest of the Autobot warriors. Victory over him would also bring\n&gt;him\n&gt; &gt; great glory among the Decepticon ranks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; T�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse\n&gt; &gt; http://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
