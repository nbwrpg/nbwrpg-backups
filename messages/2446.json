Stretching, he took out his two laser pistols from the \ndepths of subspace.  Checking them, he knew they were at full power, as was \nhe, putting them away.  Heading for the control room (or bridge), he walked \ninto the room, where Stinkbomb had died only a few hours ago, seeing an \nunknown robot (Teltoli) in their, putting its fingers near buttons, he took \nout his laser pistols aiming one at the back of Teltoli&#39;s head, the other at \nthe middle of her back.  &quot;Do not touch anything.  Slowly turn around with \nboth arms in the air, I have two weapons aimed at you, and if you try \nanything, and I mean ANYTHING, I will kill you.&quot;\n\n==================\n\nKoga Shuko sighed, seeing his ship.  It had been damaged in the battle.  \nThough they had taken the fight to two bases, damaging one badly, and \ndestroying another.  All in all, a good day&#39;s work.  Stepping into the ship, \nhe looked to Anubis and Hades.  &quot;Get to the CR tanks, Unitron, set the \nautoguns, autocannons, and missile launchers to fire at ANYTHING that is not \non our side, then get to a CR chamber.&quot;\n\n&quot;As you wish.&quot; all three said in unison, Anubis and Hades heading for the CR \ntanks, Unitron for the control room.\n\nKoga Shuko walked slowly, not nearly as damaged as the ship, much less Anubis \nand Hades.  Just a few burns on his armor, which wasn&#39;t as shiny as he liked \nit.  It made him look like a commoner.  Instead of the bridge, a CR tank, his \nprivate CR tank, or even his own quarters, he headed towards the lab, holding \nthe artificial fang, looking like it was actually made of calcium carbonate, \nbelonging to a deceased Serpentor (though he didn&#39;t know that), smiling.  &quot;We \nwill see what comes from you my pretty little tooth, oh yes, we will indee.&quot; \nhe mused, chuckling softly.\n\n===========================\n\nUsurper stood up, self destructing , the Rock going up in flames with him.  \n(Yanshosh, don&#39;t really bother putting the Rock or Usurper up on the deceased \npage, they aren&#39;t important, and I didn&#39;t want to really keep them).\n\n===========================\n\nOutside of the Alliance base&#39;s CR Chambers, Breakdown looked to his leader, \nDark One.  &quot;Shall Hiss, Scavenger, and I go to the CR chamber in the crashed \ncraft and guard it?&quot;\n\n&quot;No...I don&#39;t want anyone getting suspicious with you three never around.  \nUse these ones.  You left the defenses on, though minimal, it will let people \nknow it is owned.&quot; \n\nAll five opened a CR chamber, climbing in.\n\n==========================\n\nNemesis Enforcer and Scattershot entered the CR room, stepping up to two \nseperate CR chambers.\n\n&quot;Slag, that Dark One is in here.&quot; Nemesis said, looking to Scattershot.\n\n&quot;They&#39;re all in a CR chamber.&quot;\n\n&quot;Son of a Quint.&quot; he said, walking over to the wall near the entrance, \nsitting down and waiting.\n\n\n"}}
