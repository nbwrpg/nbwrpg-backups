My mood and temperment can change at the slightest provocation.  I&#39;m not mentally stable, it takes my total concentration to remain somewhat civil.  I can&#39;t guarentee your safety, that is why.  You may wake up on day and find me on a rampage, you&#39;d have to destroy me or run as far away as you could.  I love you, but I want you to be safe.  And besides, there&#39;s more than this base and this little war here.  When Unicron is defeated, you will have the oppertunity to travel freely, meet other bots.  You should not try to settle down with the first bot you meet.  Think of this as a grace period.
