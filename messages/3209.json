Scamrock was hit with\neveryone&#39;s blasts including the autoguns, he stood, looking rather worked\nlike he had just did a job. (Wrestling talk for looking like he got beat up\nand then lost) Suukie drew out the heavy blaster rifle from Dracona in one\nhand and fired at the base some more. Sinesis and Sinister just walked right\nthrough the fire, not even one autogun fired at them. Plintissa was shocked!\nHow could they be immune to the defenses? Then it occured to the whole\ngroup. Sinister and Sinesis spun around and opened fire on the People&#39;s\nGroup, their true allegiance being with the Predacons!...\n\nOCC: The autoguns protected by the shields cannot be shot, but rhey can\nshoot through the shields?

Looking wildly through the\n&gt; scanners, he found the People&#39;s Group all around.  Bringing more autoguns\n&gt; online to open fire on them, the shields starting to weaken and a few\n&gt; autoguns not in the protection of the shield being destroyed, he replied\nto\n&gt; the three Predacons who had contacted him, telling them the coordinates.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Injector opened his hatch, seeing some of the People&#39;s group.  Firing a\n&gt; double blast of optic lasers randomly at the People&#39;s group, he fired off\n&gt; three stinger missiles off at more random targets.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Manterror opened his hatch slightly, firing off two ion disks at the\nPeople&#39;s\n&gt; group randomly.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Bumblebee opened a hatch, firing three stinger missiles from both of his\n&gt; stinger missile launchers at Scamrock, two optic blasts firing randomly.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Idiots!&quot; Double Punch yelled, activating internal defenses, not aware\nthat\n&gt; the counter assaulting Predacons would be protected by shields.\n&gt;\n&gt; ============\n&gt;\n&gt; Breakdown awoke slowly, cursing.

The Maxis betrayed us!&quot;  Activating his\ncom\n&gt; as they both ran, Breakdown spoke with Zardus.  &lt;Zardus, this is\nBreakdown,\n&gt; we were jumped by the Maximals!  They must&#39;ve took us for dead.  We&#39;ve\nbeen\n&gt; double crossed, and those stinking Maximals are doing the crossing!
