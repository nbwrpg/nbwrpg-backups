Lightmare\ntransformed and fired 2 bolts. Both hit Arrow in the head and splattered him\neverywhere. Stronghold looked up in time to be shot in the back by Lightmare\nand forced down to his knees. Sinesis and Sinister pulled out their weapons,\nto do the same to Stronghold as they did to Suukie. Scamrock leapt up and\nhit Sinesis and Sinister both across the jaws with a spinning wheel kick!\nSinesis fell backwards into the tree. Sinister took a swing at Scamrock, but\nScamrock punches the weapon&#39;s handle, sending it flying intol a rock.\nScamrock executes a Hurracanrana onto the rock and the blade! Sineis&#39; head\ncut wide open, he stumbled a few steps and then went into stasis lock.\nArrow, being blown to pieces, mumbled about cards and how he always lost and\nthen went into stasis lock. Scamrock did a big turn kick, that almost took\nSinesis&#39; head off! Lightmare snuck up behind Scamrock, her gun was jammed\nfor some odd reason and she had to do things the old fashioned way. Scamrock\ngrabbed her by the head, not even seeing her, and snapped her down to the\nground with a snapmare. Scamrock ran forward as Sinesis sat up and hit him\nwith a jumping calf kick. Sinesis was brutally punched and kicked by\nScamrock until he went into stasis lock. Lightmare coughed a few times.\nScamrock stomped on her until she went into stasis lock. Scamrock panted\nfast and drug Stronghold and Arrow&#39;s pieces which he put into a bag, to The\nPeople&#39;s Base, it was an emergency and he and his friends had to get\nrepaired. Well at least Stronghold was his friend, Arrow was the unpaid\nbutler, heh heh. Scamrcok went into the secret passgeway in the swamp and\nthrew his 2 comrades into the CR Chamber, then jumped in himself.\n\nSinesis suddenly came out of stasis lock and then went back in, out, in,\nout, in, he started to drag Lightmare and Sinister back to the Pred base,\ngoing in and out of stasis lock at weird times. He reached the base,\nentered, and threw his comrades into the CR Chamber. He looked across the\nroom at any Preds that were there, then he went into stasis lock one more\ntime and fell backwards, right into the CR Chamber...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;; &lt;Inferno731@...&gt;;\n&lt;firefox_y2k@...&gt;; &lt;carnage_blood@...&gt;;\n&lt;thecode@...&gt;; &lt;BioBuu@...&gt;; &lt;UnderT4976@...&gt;;\n&lt;Alloran2@...&gt;; &lt;steph_pack@...&gt;; &lt;inferno126@...&gt;;\n&lt;JP3884@...&gt;; &lt;jeniff69@...&gt;; &lt;tmrattrap@...&gt;;\n&lt;dustie21@...&gt;; &lt;nashtah@...&gt;; &lt;firestorm36@...&gt;;\n&lt;warbeacon@...&gt;; &lt;shadowwarrior_ax@...&gt;; &lt;RgDaN@...&gt;\nSent: Thursday, April 13, 2000 6:59 PM\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; Ok, the Egroups thing is up and should be functional.
