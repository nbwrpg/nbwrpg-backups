So how would any of us actually\n&gt; know for sure who is behind all of this?  Is there a way ta send a recon\n&gt; team and can we be a part of it?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap turns his head to Perceptor and realizes the comment that was made\n&gt; about him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hey guys, did any of ya know that Perceptor just heard what ya said about\n&gt; the older one?  I really think that hit him really hard.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride puts a hand on Perceptor&#39;s shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t mean it that way, we all slip once in a while.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLORD ELDER looked over at PERCEPTOR, a slightly embarrased look\nflashing across his face for a moment. &quot;I did not mean that you were\nnot valuable as well.&quot; ELDER said in a slightly flustered manner.\n&quot;Only that I missed the other bot who had that same name.&quot;\n\nThere was a pause from LEGACY as he looked around, quing in on the\nconversation. It was as if he understood the words but was totally\nmissing the point.\n\nGesturing to LEGACY there was a smile on ELDER&#39;s face, &quot;Don&#39;t mind us,\ngo ahead.&quot;\n\nLEGACY nodded, &quot;Of course.&quot; He looked around again, &quot;Unfortunately\nsince this is not pure Unicronian energy, it is possible that\nMAGMATRON may indeed be behind this phenomena. Before he went into\nhiding he was known for his predilection for pursuing all things of\nUnicronian origin.&quot;\n\nHe paused as he folded his arms behind his back, &quot;However, if this is\nindeed Magmatron, then he has the assistance of something or someone\nof far more skill then he ever possesed. Manipulation of Unicronian\nbased energy with this amount of skill would require far more\nknowledge than Magmatron was known to have aquired at the time of his\ndisappearance.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
