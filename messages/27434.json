Cinders still hung in the\nair as the flam on a nearby branch crackled like the hands of a thousand\nclocks whose voices were stolen by the winds of time. The world stood still\nas a mound of ash quivered and opened on all sides to admit a solitary\nfigure entrance into the world of air and land that was Earth.
