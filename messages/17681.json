But \nuntil her hunger struck again, it would not be such a bad thing to see just \nwhat this metal thing was.\nRage sniffed the air once; simply clearing the bloody scent of her prey from \nher gore covered snout.\nThen, with a lazy growl she moved up near the metal structure, simply \nstanding about 5 feet away before coming to a stop.\nShe extended her massive head and neck until her shout nearly touched the \nshiny surface of the Alliance base armor, the strong scent of rust and steel \ncausing her to pull her head back and sneeze.\nIt stank!\nSure! She was used to the smell of rotting flesh and bone, but this was just \ndifferent and she really didn�t know what to think of it.\nRage had seen others like this, huge metal mountains that prey on two legs \nexited from, but this one was just a bit smaller�a bit.\nShe growled as she suddenly heard strange sounds just around the bend, not \nactually realizing that the Alliance entrance was RIGHT there.\nHer allosaure body shifted until her head came up right around the bend and \nagainst she side of the opening in the ship, not realizing that if she just \nsimply looked straight down at the moment she would be staring at the top of \nZardus� head.\nHowever, her keen eyes fell upon something else of interest, something that \nwas laying on the ground right in front of this steel thing.\nIt was an animal laying right in her mail view area, her shoulder brushing \nagainst the side of the exit as she took a few steps forward until she \ntowered directly over the creature(Reptilica).\nRage turned her head and looked directly down at the animal, her whole torso \nbending down and supported by her front limbs as her snout came to rest just \nabove its� head. Breathing in she took its� scent into her lungs, her \nstomach telling her that it might be a good time to feed, yet again.:\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
