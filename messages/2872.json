Across the ship, lights glare brighter for a few seconds. The\n&gt; controlls beep, reporting the power levels jumping toward 120%.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the CR room, an electric shock passes through the dead body of Ramulus,\n&gt; which was left in a CR chamber, and due to that was now fully repaired.\n&gt;\n&gt; Above the planet, a spark falters on it&#39;s jeorney to the matrix. A strange\n&gt; power pulling it back, the spark heads toward earth, and eventually into\nthe\n&gt; Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus opens his eyes, his internal computer reporting that he was fully\n&gt; functional. He stands up, exiting the CR chamber. Ramulus blinks several\n&gt; times.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m .... alive,&quot; he says in surprise, questions drifting through his\nmind.\n&gt; What had happened? He growls as he remembers the battle against the\npredacons\n&gt; in which he had been killed. Why was he alive now?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus takes a few steps and smiles. By whatever means he had been\n&gt; ressurected, he was alive, that was good enough for him!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Liono,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;Ramulus here. Reporting for duty.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus walks off toward the bridge.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; $60 in FREE Long Distance!
