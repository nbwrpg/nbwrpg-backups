(she switched to magnetic resonance) Yes! \nThere is something! A large metallic form about the size of a \ndropship!\n\nRagnar let out a cry of victory. He jumped on place and felt \noverjoyed.\n\nRagnar: Yes! Maybe we will beat this stravag planet! Let us go that \nway!\n\nAs he started forward, Katya crossed her arms, not moving and cleared \nher throat.\n\nKatya: Are you not forgetting something, quiaff?\n\nRagnar: Neg, Katya Kerensky. If it is hostiles you fear, I do not \nunderstand why. We are battlemechs after all and we will move at a \nmedium distance from each other. This way, we will be able to \nretaliate together without fearing group shots against both of us. \nBesides, I have yet to believe any hostiles are here.\n\nKatya: I see your point, but let us be prudent. Take the lead.\n\nAnd so they went, approaching the Maximal base and entering scanner \nrange.\n\n\n"}}
