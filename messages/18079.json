She \nthen hooked a hand under his shoulder and pulled up as far as she could, \ntrying to get as much of his body up on to the table.\nWith that done she sighed, but there was still no time to rest.\nIron Raptor looked Dinobot over very carefully, judging what to do next. \nAir! The first thing he needed was Air!\nShe snapped her head towards Prowl, a look on urgency on her face.*\n\n� I need a large tube, about as thick as half your wrist and as long as your \narm and torso combined. Quickly!!�\n\n* She then snapped her attention back towards Dinobot, wondering just how \nshe was going to get that tube into his lungs. But even as she thought so, \nher scanners alerted her of something very important�there was a rip in the \nwall of his lung. One that would let the air they pumped into his body if \nthey didn�t do something about it.\nBut, how to get to that lung without having to cut him open?!\nIron Raptor closed her eyes and went through the possibilities they had, and \none finally surfaced that was more likely then any others.\nThe wound in his chest, was deep and wide and led directly into his chest. \nIf they widened the wound a bit then it would be open all the way to his \nlungs, where they could find the rip and repair it! Perfect!!\nIron Raptor looked over her shoulder to Prowl again.*\n\n� I also need an energon blade and some welding material.�\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
