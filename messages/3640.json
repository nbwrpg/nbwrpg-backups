Pulling the trigger back twice, \nhe smiled as two bolts headed for Zardus.\n\n---\n\nSixshot shook in his tank mode as a rocket struck him, taking out the back \nhalf of that mode.  Swerving the cannon, he fired a powerful sonic blast at \nPerndabot&#39;s torso.\n\n---\n\nKoga Shuko raised his missile launcher, firing it off at the Ark.\n\n---\n\nUnitron fell back several feet as shots hit him.  Looking up as he could \nsmell slightly scorched metal, he saw Zardus.  Firing two optic blasts, he \nraised both laser rifles, firing four bolts each, a total of 10 laser beams \nheading for the Alliance&#39;s leader.\n\n\n"}}
