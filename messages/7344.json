Though her \nfur was charred and blackened, and her armor singed and broken, she \nwould NEVER give them the satisfaction of hearing her scream.\nTavatron weakly pulled against the restraints. She knew it was\nuseless to struggle, even a Transmetal couldn&#39;t break these bonds. \nTavatron raised her head slightly, straining her ears to detect the \nslightest sound. Nemesis appeared to be thouroughly enjoying himself, \nas did the other Alliance &#39;bots present. \n\nTavatron laid her head against the cold steel table. There was\nnothing she could do. She was completely and totally at the mercy of \nthe Alliance, as was Iron Raptor. Tavatron took a deep breath as she \nslowly closed her eyes. She wasn&#39;t asleep, but what difference did it \nmake either way? The light grenade had temporarily blinded her, \nbesides, she really didn&#39;t want to see what Nemesis was looking for. \nShe didn&#39;t want a knight, or some kind of crazy hero bursting through \nthe door just in the nick of time. She wanted a chance to fight back, \na chance to defend herself. Still, when she did get loose, and she \nwould, she was going to kill Zardus.\n\n\n"}}
