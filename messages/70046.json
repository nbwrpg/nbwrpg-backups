The speed of the rise through off\ngreat amounts of tremendously hot liquid rock, splashing the area all\naround.\n\nHowever what is even more disturbing is that as the base came up,\nsmall guns and cannons extended themseves and oriented on the\ndifferent targets. Several of them glowed for a moment and then opened\nfire on the maximals and Autobots that were present!\n\nOOC: Keep in mind that there is still a lake of super hot stone/magma\nseperating the Maximals from the fortress, like a large moat around a\ncastle.\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
