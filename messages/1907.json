She walked along, \nwatching her surroundings carefully. She had her teeth bared and her eyes \nwild. Within a few moments, she saw a room with the CR chambers, as the \nFuzor had promised.\n\nShe let out a satisfied noise, gaping her mouth and twitching her tail. She \nentered the room and approached the chamber on the left. She pressed a \nbutton on the side of it with her foreclaw, then it opened. She looked \naround, then entered. The door closed behind her and she turned her body \naround with her tail going around her side.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
