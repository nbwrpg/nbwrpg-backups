His eyes widened, trying to blot the image out of his\nmind, but not succeeding. Depth Charge&#39;s offer to help went unnoticed\nas Prowl backed up in the air.\n\n&quot;NO!&quot; Prowl yelled, now completely unaware of his surroundings. What\nwas in his head was his reality. External no longer mattered, the\nbattle was in his head.\n\nHe struggled against the imaginary bonds, hate for Megatron beginning\nto fill him. But it wasn&#39;t because of that scene alone. Something from\nhis past, something he couldn&#39;t remember, fueled it as well. He\njerked, trying to break the bonds that prevented him from getting to\nMegatron. Some shots whizzed by him in the real world, but he didn&#39;t\ncare.\n\nAs anger and a feeling of helplessness mounted, another conciousness\nbegan to rise up in Prowl, the same thing he had felt the first time\nhe had transformed into his monstrous second beast mode, and it was\nhappening again.\n\nIn his mind, his body expanded, the bonds that held him to the wall\ngroaning and then snapping as he grew. His wings shot out further\nbehind him, and his body transformed to something like a blend between\na human and a raptor, his back legs buffer than his front ones but\nabout the same length. The head was part that of an owl, with a raptor\njaw instead of a beak. Feathers stuck out of the cracks in between his\narmor. Prowl didn&#39;t realize that the same changes were happening to\nhim in the real world.\n\nHe was now standing in the room, topping 20 feet and glaring down at\nMegatron. With an enraged roar, Prowl leapt forward, snapping at\nMegatron with his massive jaws. In reality, he was soaring toward\nHalucigen, doing the exactly same action that he was attempting to do\non the imaginary Megatron.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I was going to let you do it but i think i will do it if that\nis\n&gt; ok...\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Halucigen::\n&gt; Halucigen started entering horrid graphics into the mind of Prowl\n&gt; finding it diffucult for his large mind control.
