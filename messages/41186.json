He briefly glances the table over to make sure there was no mech fluid on it or anything before entering, remembering having to lead Ominous Prime into a mechfluid-stained conference room once in the past.\n\n&quot;Have a seat,&quot; he says to Orchestra, walking to a chair and sitting down. Chaostaur walks by the door, not noticing that Zardus had entered, still working on his gun.\n\n\n"}}
