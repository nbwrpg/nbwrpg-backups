He decided to go in to investigate. Lowering himself to greet this bat. \nHe scanned the trees to see exactly where it landed. The only reason he was \nso interested was that it was defintly a strange mix of colors for a bat. \nWhich meant Robot in Disguise. The scanners picked up it&#39;s signal and it \nturned out to be Predacon.\n    &quot;Hey, are you all right? What&#39;s the matter?&quot; \n\n"}}
