He \n&gt; smiles.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I can see how you got your name.  Highly perceptive of you.  Thank you \n&gt; Legacy, you&#39;ve shed a lot of light on many of my questions.  Now that I \n&gt; know my lineage, it&#39;s time I lived up to it.  First things first, \n&gt; Perceptor and I could do with getting our sight back, and if you could do \n&gt; that I&#39;d greatly appreciate it, Stanton.  Next, we have insectoids hiding \n&gt; beneath the Black Fortress tunnels, which have to be shown a lesson about \n&gt; tampering with what is not theirs.  And Hydras last of all, could use a \n&gt; lesson in that as well.  Nobody tampers with any Autobot and gets away \n&gt; with it.  Especially when they tamper with a Prime.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns his head toward Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; They caused great harm to you Rodimus, and I&#39;ll see to it, with your \n&gt; help, that they get it back in return.  If Optimus Prime could fend off \n&gt; Megatron, I&#39;m sure I can follow in his footsteps, and fend off the enemy \n&gt; at hand.  Both Hydras and Cylconus need to be dealt with accordingly. \n&gt; Rodimus voiced an interest in dealing with Hydras and so do I.  Two Primes \n&gt; against an evil leader is sure to topple even the most evil of warlords. \n&gt; But our war does not end with just us.  If we&#39;re going to send those \n&gt; Decepticons and Predicons packing, we&#39;ll need every Autobot and Maximal we \n&gt; have in our ranks to pull this off.  Lord Elder, I&#39;d like you to contact \n&gt; Lord Perseus, and assemble a Maximal/ Autobot assembly.  The more we get \n&gt; together, the stronger we&#39;ll be.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I know who it sounds like. We only knew Optimus for a short time, but \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t mistake his voice and you most certainly sound like him.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson shows modesty in his expression.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Maybe it&#39;s just a cooincedence.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap looks to him intently.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Legacy, You know a lot about everyone, don&#39;t ya think Wheels sounds a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; lot like Optimus? And by chance, could he actually be related to him?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy turned and looked at Tuscon, his single optic pulsing for a\n&gt;&gt; moment, &quot;You come from the same construction line as the Autobot\n&gt;&gt; leader known as Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy paused for a moment as if accessing some internal memories,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You spark matrix according to the last scan record bears a striking\n&gt;&gt; similarity to Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Convoy as well as Big\n&gt;&gt; Convoy. However here are those who postulate that Spark Matriixes are\n&gt;&gt; attenuated by the actions one takes and the desisions arrived at as\n&gt;&gt; much as by default construction specifications.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Santon shrugged, &quot;What he really means Tuscon is that you are built\n&gt;&gt; along the same lines as him, and your spark is similar, but he&#39;s not\n&gt;&gt; sure if that is because that is how you&#39;re constructed or because your\n&gt;&gt; actions have made it that way.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy glanced at Santon, &quot;I believe I had already said that.&quot; he\n&gt;&gt; intoned coolly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Yeah, well sometimes your words are longer than a class 5 star\n&gt;&gt; crusier.&quot; Santon retorted smoothly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy just turned back to Tuscon, pointedly ignoring Santon.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
