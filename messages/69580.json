To him Restoration was more than jus=\r\nt restoring artifacts, making them appear and work like new, it was also ab=\r\nout restoring old programming and recovery of important data.  He did not k=\r\nnow the extent of the corruption upon which was placed on Rodimus but he kn=\r\new he couldn&#39;t just throw in the towel on his leader.  Autobots stuck toget=\r\nher, and through thick and thin, he&#39;d keep his pledge to never abandon his =\r\nfellow Autobots.  He also realized that if he was going to get anywhere, he=\r\n&#39;d have to do it himself.  \n\n&quot;On second thought, I think I&#39;ll go this one a=\r\nlone.  Don&#39;t wait up for me, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back too soon.&quot;\n\nHe bids=\r\n Kenzo good bye and walks out of the room.  \n\n&quot;Oh before I forget, have the=\r\n CR chamber prepared for Rodimus.  He&#39;ll need it more than me.&quot;  \n\nHe was d=\r\nead set on recovering his leader.  And this time, nothing and no one would =\r\nget in his way of achieving his mission.  He sends one final message to Lor=\r\nd Perseus.\n\n&quot;Lord Perseus, it&#39;s come to my attention that my leader, Rodimu=\r\ns Prime, has been abducted and altered severely.  This puts the Matrix of L=\r\neadership at a grave Risk, but most of all, his spark, which I believe is t=\r\noo precious to waste for evil purposes.  I can not abandon my leader, not e=\r\nven in his corruptive state.  I hereby announce that I am on route to locat=\r\ning my leader, and I DO intend to BRING HIM BACK.  Hopefully, the damage ca=\r\nn be reversed.  If not, there is question of the well being of the Matrix. =\r\n I must recover it, perhaps not for my own personal gain, but for the benef=\r\nit of Autobot kind.  It&#39;s too precious to lose to the hands of those who th=\r\nirst for power and greed.  I swear by Primus&#39;s name, I will return, but my =\r\nreturn may not be a fast one.  May Primus guide you as he guides me.  This =\r\nis Tucson, signing off. I will report to you again, once I know more of the=\r\n condition of my leader.&quot;\n\nHe signs off, gets off the ship, and transforms =\r\ninto SUV mode, hoping to find Rodimus via his sonar systems.\n\nTag: Kraftlos=\r\n and Cyclonus.\n\n\n"}}
