Those decades of rest in the volcano must have taken more \nof a toll on him than he originally thought. \n\nBefore standing, he ran a self diagnostic check to ensure everything \nwas okay.  Some small messages popped up on his retinal HUD. \n\n**Check complete** \n**32 Damaged pathways were located** \n**29 Were repaired** \n**3 others were too damaged therefore they were bypassed by new \npathways** \n**Armor at 95%** \n**Weapon systems nominal** \n**Servos operational** \n**Running at 98% efficiency** \n\nThat was the end of the list.  He realized that he should have done \nthat scan when he first awoke.  He rose and started walking to the \ncommand center.  He had to find out what went on as he slept. \n\n\n"}}
