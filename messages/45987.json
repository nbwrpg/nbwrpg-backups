Yet you seem to believe my \nentire \n&gt; reason for being here is to kill your charachters. Remember dewboy I \nwas in \n&gt; this RPG long before you were. And at least when I joined I didnt \nmode by \n&gt; world hopping and giving noone chances to respond to your posts. Now \nwhy \n&gt; don&#39;t you grow up a little and stop provoking me as that is what you \nare \n&gt; doing. If I wanted Dewboy I could have easily killed Mustex and \nstallex when \n&gt; they were in gorzos sub since I controlled gorzo at the time. In \nother words \n&gt; dewboy, just shut the hell up and stop making accusations.\n\n\n"}}
