Also the\n&gt; fact that TUSCON=\r\n has already been damaged once by trying to deflect\n&gt; his plasma blast with=\r\n his arm has helped immensly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agility takes power, that is a warrior&#39;s=\r\n maxim. The heavier you are,\n&gt; the more power it takes to propell yourself =\r\nthrough the air. It\n&gt; applied to TUSCON as much as it did to MAGMATRON. Alt=\r\nhough MAGMATRON\n&gt; was signifigantly heavier than TUSCON, TUSCON was not lig=\r\nht weight\n&gt; either. He was built to be a PRIME.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was two dragons fig=\r\nhting each other, one nearly twice as large as\n&gt; the other, both skilled an=\r\nd full of their own anger and power! As much\n&gt; as TUSCON was relying on agi=\r\nlity and training, it was obvious to\n&gt; onlookers that MAGMATRON was also we=\r\nll trained.\n&gt; \n&gt; A veteran of wars and battles that TUSCON had only seen in=\r\n historical\n&gt; video, MAGMATRON was also well versed in many of the combat a=\r\nrts and a\n&gt; master of several!\n&gt; \n&gt; In this draconic mode MAGMATRON was lik=\r\ne some chimeric dragon-like\n&gt; creature, his powerful forearms slashing out =\r\nvisciously at TUSCON,\n&gt; ignoring the music and noise coming from the others=\r\n!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride looks around and reloads his cannon.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Well that worked but there&#39;s still a long way ta go.  Time ta reload=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; keep shooting.  Sheesh, they even come outa the woodwork.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;N=\r\nEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; They had almost literally swarmed with SHARKTICONS, although their=\r\n\n&gt; numbers had been thinned out by at least half! Many of them were\n&gt; begin=\r\nning to circle towards the center of the cavern again as they\n&gt; regrouped a=\r\nround SKY BYTE and the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; As QUICKSTRIDE was reloading several SH=\r\nARKTICONS came at him at once\n&gt; trying to catch him while he was distracted=\r\n. The attack was not all\n&gt; that clever, but it did show a level of intelleg=\r\nence and grasp of the\n&gt; situation that the SHARKTICONS of old may not have =\r\ngrasped. However\n&gt; these new ones seemed to be a bit more astute, even with=\r\n their master\n&gt; under attack and not able to give them more direct orders.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; DINOBOT&#39;s shot over was pure luck rather than skill, b=\r\nut he would take what\n&gt; &gt; he could get as his large tail blaster glowed, hi=\r\nm trying to use it in close\n&gt; &gt; quarters to slash off the SHARKTICONS aroun=\r\nd and try to regain some room!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was a groan from =\r\nVICE GRIP.  Saved by MAXIMALS.  What was prehistoric\n&gt; &gt; Earth coming to?  =\r\nHe took the opportunity to throw off some of the\n&gt; &gt; SHARKTICONS on top of =\r\nhim, getting up, his body sparking and heavily\n&gt; &gt; damaged.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Right i=\r\nn time to be sent sprawling by the shockwave from the thrown\n&gt; &gt; explosive!=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; With the work of DINOBOT and the MAXIMAL FUZORS as well as=\r\n RAT TRAP\n&gt; and QUICKSTRIDE the SHARKTICONS were nearly spent!\n&gt; \n&gt; Except =\r\nfor the few still attacking QUICKSTRIDE most of them had\n&gt; clustered around=\r\n SKYBYTE, there were perhaps 20 of them left as oppose\n&gt; to the horde of th=\r\nem seemed to almost boil into the room a few minutes\n&gt; ago . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; . . .=\r\n could it really have been so short of a time span? . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYBYTE&#39;s sm=\r\nile had little humor in it as he watched the scene.\n&gt; Instead it had hints =\r\nof fear and, a loss of the supreme confidence\n&gt; that he once had. His optic=\r\ns glanced across the SHARKTICON carcasses\n&gt; that littered the floor.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nATTACK!!!&quot; He yelled out, forgetting about the poetry and the finesse\n&gt; of =\r\nit all, and with that single word SKYBYTE sent his last remaining\n&gt; SHARKTI=\r\nCONS into battle! Meanwhile he himself began back peddling\n&gt; towards MAGMAT=\r\nRON was battling TUSCON.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;RODIMUS!!!

OPTIMUS&#39; cannon smoking fro=\r\nm\n&gt; the firepower that he had just unleashed!\n&gt; \n&gt; He had actually attacked=\r\n PREDACONS and MAXIMALS!\n&gt; \n&gt; OPTIMUS reached down and picked up DARK RODIM=\r\nUS by the throat and\n&gt; looked at him and smiled.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Optimus no.&quot; RODIMUS=\r\n PRIME said from the ground as he looked up.\n&gt; \n&gt; OPTIMUS frowned as he loo=\r\nked down at RODIMUS PRIME, &quot;Don&#39;t call me\n&gt; that!&#39; He said as he kicked ROD=\r\nIMUS and sent him spilling over the\n&gt; side of the bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS PRIM=\r\nE was only able to stop himself from tumbling into the pit\n&gt; by a precariou=\r\ns handgrip on the side of the bridge!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Then what should we call you?&quot; =\r\nThis was the voice of SKY SHADOW as he\n&gt; landed in front of the pit along w=\r\nith his FUZORS.\n&gt; \n&gt; The figure that was once OPTIMUS PRIME, the blackened =\r\nfigure that had\n&gt; been bathed in the dark fires of UNICRONIAN energies look=\r\ned down at\n&gt; the FUZORS and then the rest of the battlefield as a wicked gr=\r\nin\n&gt; spread across his face, &quot;You can call me NEMESIS PRIME!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But for=\r\n those who wish to live, you can simply call me MASTER!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - =\r\nPreston\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
