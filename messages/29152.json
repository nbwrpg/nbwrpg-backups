She wantred to know about the ship, the Iron Fist.\nIt was part of her nature.\nBiomass nodded.*\n\n&quot; Thank you.&quot;\n\n..........................\n\n* Ruffling through the undergrowth he made his way towards water, stopping \nhere and there to dig up the occasional root his beast mode detected. \nMunching them down he continues on his way until his nose picked up the \nscent of water and he followed it to a small pond.\nTremmer (since Yan gave away the name I was keeping secret for a while, \nmight as well get it out in the open) felt his way with his diggers until \nthey felt wet and he bent his head to lap at the water. (diggers are claws).\nBut moment later he was surprised to hear someone behind him and he turned \nhis head towards the sound. With his nose alone he could tell that the \nperson was a transformer, male, a Maximal and armed.\nTremmer cocked his head to the side and scratched behind that ear, moving to \nstand on his two back legs, always facing this new person.*\n\n&quot; What&#39;s goin on &#39;er?&quot; *he asked, voice questioning but friendly. Deep and \nsmooth.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
