They needed the generator inside the basalt sphere, so the easiest way would be to cut it open and install.  Malice drew his sword.  It looked like a hammered out backbone.  It was more of a saw than a sword.  It also had cables running the length from the tip to the hilt.  When the bottom half of the handle was unscrewed and slid inside the other half, it created a whip like saw weapon.  Malice could also channel energy into it, making it more or less leathal.  In this application, Malice poured so of his stored energy into it, making it like a torch.  He plunged the blade into the sphere and in a circular motioin, cut a cross section wide enough to slide the generator inside.  He pulled the section out and drew out the heat so he could set it down.  All that was left was installing the generator and figure out where they were going to launch it.\n\nshadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@...&gt; wrote:WOlfblade::\n\nShe was glad to be back in the lab.
