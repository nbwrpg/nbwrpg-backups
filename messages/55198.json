She was having difficulty making her \nway. Her own injuries were not making things easier. She was leaving \na mech fluid trail and her body was feeling weak. She had to stop for \na minute when she had reached the half way point to the base. She \nrested for a few minutes, then kept going. With luck, she would reach \nthe base without passing out.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : SharpClaw : :\n&gt; SharpClaw remained uncouncious as he was swung over KitKat&#39;s \nshoulder.
