She knew his name. She \nknew his name! Only one other &#39;bot on this entire planet would know who he \nwas! Still... he couldn&#39;t take any chances. It could be a trick.\n\nRion sheathed his sword, which oddly enough he hadn&#39;t dropped once during \nthe entire vulture incident. He must be getting better, or maybe he was just \nlucky. Either way, Rion cleared his throat and straigtened his back. He used \nhis most adult sounding voice. Unfortunetly he was only seven, so he didn&#39;t \nsound as professional and intimidating as he would have liked:\n\n&quot;Who wants to know?&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
