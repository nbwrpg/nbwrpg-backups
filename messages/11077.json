She turned and \nwalked over to the spear.  she pulled it out of the wall and let it \ndropp to the bed.  She sat down on the bed next to the spear and \nstared at the floor.  She was pissed.  She once again had the \noppertunity to kill a pred and was denied because of another hostage \nsituation.  Anger flowed through her and she felt like there was no \nrelease for it.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Striker::\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker raises an eyebrow, looking Spears over, noting the angry \nlook in her \n&gt; eyes and the bruised hand.
