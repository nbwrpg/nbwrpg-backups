He saw the gesalts forming and \nthe alliance members attacking the CF. He hated the way that Oblitertron \nacted like he was the most powerfull robot in the universe.\n\nHe pointed his miisile launcher and fired a missile right at Oblitertron \nhead. \n&quot;Take that, Alliance SCUM!&quot; he yelled \nnbwrpg@egroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; (Carnage, Sixshot is currently in his tank form)\n&gt; \n&gt; The Oblitercons (Oblitertron)/Sixshot/Dark Wolf/Double \n&gt; Punch/Injector/Manterror/Bumblebee/Ares/Nemesis Enforcer/Scattershot:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dark One saw Dark Lavatron, and decided it was time. �He launched two \n&gt; missiles at the Cybertronian Fire, blowing apart the last EMP cannon. �He \n&gt; transformed to his biped mode, using the boosters to land on his feet \ngently, \n&gt; near the other Oblitercons.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oblitercons, their defenses are broken! �Let the slaughter begin!&quot; �Dark \nOne \n&gt; leapt into the air, his body extending and changing to take the shape of a \n&gt; head and torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Breakdown heard his commander&#39;s orders and looked to him, and saw him take \n&gt; shape. �&quot;Oblitercons, unite!&quot; he yelled so the others heard him. �He \n&gt; transformed into the right arm of the gestalt, attaching to the right side \nof \n&gt; Dark One&#39;s chest form, making the right arm.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Pyro fired a fire ball, missing a missile launcher. �He was about to curse, \n&gt; but was interrupted by the muffled yell of Dark One, and the clear yell of \n&gt; Breakdown. �He instantly transformed into the shape of a left arm, and \n&gt; attached to Dark One, forming the left arm of the mighty Oblitertron.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hiss slowly got up, and heard the yells. �He didn&#39;t understand any of them. \n�\n&gt; His audio receptors were still scrambled, and internal repairs weren&#39;t \n&gt; finished fixing them yet. �But, when he saw them all taking the form of \n&gt; Oblitertron, the obvious answer as to what his comrades were yelling was \n&gt; known to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; He leaped into the air, transforming into the shape of a right leg. �Via \n&gt; magnetics and some things only known by the deceased creators of the \n&gt; Oblitercons, Hiss&#39; form was drawn to the right side of Oblitertron&#39;s \npelivs, \n&gt; and attached.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scavenger ducked under the missile, the explosion sending dirt and a small \n&gt; amount of shrapnel into his back. �He heard the yells, and transformed into \n&gt; the shape of a left leg, mid transformation eight shots striking him, but \nit \n&gt; didn&#39;t move him because of the magnetics, and he was drawn tot he left side \n&gt; of Oblitertron&#39;s pelvis, and attached.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; The forty-five foot tall Oblitertron raised both arms and pounded them \n&gt; against his chest. �Dark One&#39;s mind easily took control of the gestalt, the \n&gt; four other minds not being as strong. �Yet, they still influenced Dark \nOne&#39;s \n&gt; actions. �They were now one, Oblitertron. �But, Dark One&#39;s mind was just a \n&gt; tad bit more prevailing. �\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;PUNY MAXIMALS WILL BE OBLITERATED!&quot; he yelled as he drew his laser cannon \n&gt; from subspace and looked for a target.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sixshot felt Dinobot&#39;s optic blast pound into his form and he swerved his \n&gt; turret to aim at the Maximal, and charged his single cannon. �But he was \nhit \n&gt; by a missile from the missile launchers which hit him in the left side of \nhis \n&gt; turret. �The explosion ripped through his weakened armor, and knocked him \n&gt; onto the right side of his tank form.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;ARGH!&quot; he yelled out in severe pain. �&quot;TWO FORMS ALREADY DOWN! �Only four \n&gt; left...&quot; He transformed to his armored carrier mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; This mode is shaped like a tank, but it had no turrets. �Only two batteries \n&gt; with two smaller cannons inside.\n&gt; \n&gt; He cursed, knowing his weapons wouldn&#39;t be as strong since he had to divert \na \n&gt; bit of enegy to repairs, or he would eventually just go into stasis lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf watched the two other gestalts. �He was tired of having to deal \n&gt; with these Maximals. �They were certainly no challenge, and he was only \n&gt; getting hit by cheap pot shots. �He would not fight in a small battle like \n&gt; this just for pot shots. �And he certainly wouldn&#39;t be outdone by inferior \n&gt; Cybertronians. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;MY BRETHREN!&quot; he roared. �He leaped into the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper heard his brother&#39;s yell, and leaped into the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw heard the roar, and transformed into his biped mode, leaping into \n&gt; the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; They did not transform into different forms, like a head, torso, leg, etc. �\n&gt; They simply merged in a bright flash of crimson.\n&gt; \n&gt; A 25 foot gestalt crashed to the ground, a mean looking sword in his right \n&gt; arm, his features resembling mostly Demon Wulf, except for the long dark \n&gt; claws on the tips of his fingers from Dark Claw, and the mean looking set \nof \n&gt; teeth from Flesh Ripper.\n&gt; \n&gt; The smaller gestalt roared. �&quot;Prepare, to die!&quot; �Dark Wolf slammed a hoof \non \n&gt; the ground, the leg looking like a wolf&#39;s only more human-like, and a hoof \non \n&gt; the end instead of a paw.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch watched the shots go by, and the missile explode against the \n&gt; ground. �The shock wave of the missile knocked him on his skit plate. �He \n&gt; cursed. �&quot;Getting closer, every slagging time.&quot; �He raised both pinchers, \n&gt; firing an energy-signature seeking missile from each at Sideswipe.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector fired off three stinger missiles from his left launcher at \n&gt; Sideswipe, and fired off two more from his other launcher at Ratchet.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Bumblebee fired off two stinger missiles intercepting the missile and a few \n&gt; shots. �The rest he blocked with his right arm and cried out in pain, \n&gt; returning fire with two stinger missiles at Torca.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror fired off three ion disks from both arms, and watched the six \ndisks \n&gt; impact with the shields. �He laughed as he saw the three Alliance gestalts \n&gt; form, and flew towards Prowl.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Ares felt the impact of the missile and shots and yelled out, slowly \n&gt; transforming to his biped mode. �He cursed, jumping back, a laser rifle in \n&gt; one hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer yelled to Scattershot via comm. transmission. �&quot;IRON \nRAPTOR \n&gt; IS IN THE BATTLE! �KILL HER!&quot; He activated the boosters in his feet and \nheld \n&gt; his wings aloft, keeping his arms akimbo with the rapid firing-laser rifle.\n&gt; \n&gt; He flew at Iron Raptor, firing off ten rapid laser blasts at her torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot cursed at Nemesis Enforcer. �&quot;Do this, do that...&quot; he sighed, \n&gt; taking out a charge and tossing it at the Cybertronian Fire. �His face \nbeamed \n&gt; with a sadistic smile as the charge got through the shields and blew up \n&gt; against the Maximal warship&#39;s hull.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at \nhttp://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
