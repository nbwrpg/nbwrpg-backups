It may have been his only cover.\n\nHe had to keep going and try to find something that could help him. But \nwhat? The only bots that he ever came in contact with were the ones that \nused him. And nothing from this planet could come to any good to him.\n\nHe kept on moving, hitting his feet against rocks and tripping over \nup-rooted little things. It took him a few more minutes until he finally \nmade it out of the forest. He looked behind himself and watched the skies \nfor the Predacon fliers. That was when he bumped into something (Dark \nMouse).\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
