A \nsmall smile flickers across his face as Motormaster punches Wildrider.\n\n&quot;I see you&#39;ve been busy,&quot; he comments, his mind sorting through all \nthe data that Wildrider gave.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Motormaster nods, &quot;Walk with me&quot; he says, as he enters the Dark \nAvian. &quot;As\n&gt; you may have noticed, we have a larger amount of troops since we \nlast saw\n&gt; each other, and I&#39;m in better shape,&quot; he says smiling. He then sees\n&gt; Wildrider, &quot;Report Wildrider&quot;, Wildrider looks around, then starts \nto\n&gt; speak, &quot;Umm, well sir, a Quintesson has arrived with the \nTerrorcons, and I\n&gt; put them all to work. The Quintesson repaired our wounded, and the\n&gt; Terrorcons are hunting down Condor&quot; he finishes smiling a wicked \nsmile, and\n&gt; he is met by a hard fist from Motormaster. The punch sends Wildrider\n&gt; soaring towards a wall. He bounces off, and rubs his face. &quot;You \nidiot, they\n&gt; will probably rip Condor to shreds&quot; he yells. He wasnt so much \nupset with\n&gt; Wildrider, but he was blowing off some steam. &quot;Send Scourge and \nCyclonus\n&gt; out to make sure the Maximal survives, Oh, and get the Quintesson \nto fix up\n&gt; your face.&quot; he finishes, disgusted with the large amounts of \nendoskeleton\n&gt; metal showing on Wildrider&#39;s face. Wildrider salutes, &quot;Yes sir&quot; and \nwalks\n&gt; away finishing the sentence, &quot;Your royal pain in the tail pipe.&quot; He \nleaves\n&gt; the Dark Avian to meet the rest of the robots.\n&gt; \n&gt; Speedbreaker climbs into Astroblast, and grabs a big sheet of metal \nto\n&gt; carry out.\n\n\n"}}
