Nearly 250 feet across and high it was a\n&gt; near perfect semi circular room all the way around. All around the\n&gt; room, starting from 30 feet off the floor the walls were lined with\n&gt; cave entrances, each of them perhaps five feet wide, hundreds of them\n&gt; all around the room and stretching high towards the domed ceiling. At\n&gt; floor level of the chamber there are several larger cave openings\n&gt; which lead off in different directions much like the one that the\n&gt; group was entering from.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the center of the room a large column, stretching from floor to\n&gt; ceiling and nearly 30 feet thick at the base. About 100 feet up there\n&gt; appears to be some sort of small metal chamber that has been\n&gt; haphazardly affixed to the column with some sort of adhesive. the\n&gt; chamber is about 10 feet tall and perhaps 4 feet wide or so. Upon\n&gt; closer inspection one could see that it is a recharging chamber, and\n&gt; it is from inside this that Rodimus&#39; signal can be detected.\n&gt;\n&gt; However high up, near the top of that column near the ceiling is a\n&gt; much larger version of the insectile creatures that you have seen. It\n&gt; looks about identical to the others with four forelegs, each ending in\n&gt; sharply barbed blades, eight legs that went along the side of the\n&gt; body, and a scorpion like tail, although the abdomen is larger, and\n&gt; overall it appeared to be 30 tall.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Maximals, Autobots and Predacon&quot; the creature said as it&#39;s wings\n&gt; buzzed, the voice definitely sounded female. &quot;Your companion has had\n&gt; much to teach and is about to become a most delicious snack. But it is\n&gt; good that you have come, you can become the main course!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The creature spread her wings, dropped from her high perch and took\n&gt; off to the air as she chuckled evilly.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
