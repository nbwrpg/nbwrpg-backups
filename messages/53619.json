There&#39;s a rule \n&gt; against making your chars too big.  Anyway, average G1 size is \ncloser \n&gt; to 20 feet tall than 40.  You&#39;re talking about a character nearly \nthe \n&gt; size of some gestalts.\n&gt;\nUmm.. Not from the stats that I know. Raksha&#39;s site even has a pretty \ngood set up of sizes.
