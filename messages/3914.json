We�re allied with them with a treaty. The NewComers have retreated and now there is only the ALLIANCE LEFT. Hold your fire.�\n\n* Suddenly there was a huge thud behind her but off to the distance and she turned her head and looked, her eyes grew big and her jaw nearly dropped open as she saw the huge Alliance weapon heading towards the Ark. Her head then suddenly snapped towards Shadow Cat. *\n\n� Get inside the base, NOW! And whatever happens do NOT fire on that huge bot heading towards us! We are supposed to have a treaty with them but thanx to a big mistake we have obviously pissed them off�BIG TIME! Now go! I�ll help deal with this!�\n\n* With that Iron Raptor then moved off towards Oblitertron, her steps a bit shaky but keeping her massive body above ground�her tail dragging. It wasn�t long before she suddenly came within 2 hundred meters of the huge robot and stopped, her head tilted a bit back so that she could look at the joined Alliance members. Her voice was a bit shaky as she then spoke but it was very clear, the loss of mech fluid causing her voice too faultier. She then opens her com-link to all Maximal fequencies�*\n\n� Attention Maximals, do NOT fire upon the approaching bot. We are with treaty with the Alliance and we shall not fire. Those who do shall answer to me!�\n\n* She then switches her com-link over to the Alliance members in which formed Oblitertron.*\n\n� Attention, Dark One, Breakdown, Pyro, Hiss and Scavenger, it had obviously come to light that us Maximals had made a mistake! We were not aware of the treaty and for that we were blind to you�good intentions. I request that we discuss this like civilized bots and stop this violence.�\n\n* Iron Raptor then looked down at the ground, her systems faltering her not being able to maintain her Second Beast Mode. With a sigh she quickly transformed into her robot mode, the gash on her side still there as she then stood up straight to meet the glare of the huge bot. Her systems were nearly shaking with fright and the need to run as she saw the robot continue towards the base and thus her position, but she then swallowed that fear and stood proud. *\n\n� But, if you have to take out your anger on somebot then take it out on me! I�m the one that shot you�or one of you. And it was a mistake, but if somebot has to pay for that mistake and all of the others that had fired on you then I�ll pay! You have anger towards a mistake that I was a part of so stop firing on others and make the same mistake that I did�and fire on me. The one whom deserves it!�\n\n* Iron Raptor waited for Oblitertron to turn it�s gun towards her and pull the trigger, she was ready to die for her mistake�taking responsibility for her actions that she knew that she was guilty of. She would parish to save her Maximals from doom from a huge threat and she was proud to do so, if her death caused the bot to be satisfied then she would die. However, she braced herself for the impact of the blow, if she was going to die then she was going to be ready! *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
