It didn&#39;t affect his plans. The Vok \nbeing, however, hears and pays interest, looking through the planet. \nOptimus Prime was back, but the Optimus Prime on the Ark was still \nthere. This one must have come from the future.\n\nNear him, Astral looks very surprised, but says nothing since his \ncommander didn&#39;t.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;What in the pit is that?!&quot; Repressor exclaims as the voice reaches \nhim and Perndabot. They and FZ were just entering the CR room of the \nIron Fist.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s nothing important. Simply an announcement,&quot; FZ replies, his \nmind instructed by Zardus&#39;. Repressor and Perndabot nod doubtfully. \nAll three bots enter CR tanks.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRecklessa, in a CR tank, doesn&#39;t hear the voice. Griplash, also in \none, fails to hear it as well.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStarlight stops her decent as she hears the voice, listening for a \nsecond but hearing nothing more. She shruggs it off, opening fire on \nPrebon with her rifle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFenox&#39;s head jerks up as she hears the words. She looks at D, \nalarmed. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn the Alliance base, a door slides open and Reptilica and \nBloodystrike emerge. The voice had woken them from their slumber that \nhad been forced by Desmonus after she had almost drained them of \nmechfluid, but they hadn&#39;t heard it. They also didn&#39;t remember \nDesmonus drinking either of their mechfluid.\n\nBoth bots set off for the bridge of the Iron Fist.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dachande&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dark Prime--&gt;Optimus Prime::\n&gt; \n&gt;     He had been wandering for days, not caring if he returned to \nNod. Suddenly he got a feeling that something wasn&#39;t right in the \nUniverse. There were too many evils, and and age old riverly could \nnot be brought to a close.\n&gt;     Galvatron was alive. Optimus Prime was stuck within the \nEvilness of Dark Prime. They would not be able to fight both being \nevil. Primus needed to be sated.\n&gt;     The Time Gateway (remember that?) Glowed with a firey reddness. \nThe source of Prime&#39;s evil and his lust for the power of Cronus was \nseated there. The Gateway exploded, shattering into thousands of \npeices.\n&gt;     Dark Prime fell to his knees. His body was wracked with pain. \nHis chest panel opened of it&#39;s own will (well, not really) and the \nAutobot Matrix emerged. It floated out from Prime&#39;s chest and then it \nopened. Releasing all of Prime&#39;s goodness back into him, but leaving \njust enough evil to get the job done. Prime&#39;s body went through a \nchange as well, from his knees to his feet became Blue, his upper \nlegs became white, his arms and chest became the familiar Prime Red. \nHis mouth plate became silver, along with much of his face, the \nhelmet that surrounded it bacame blue, his hands also became Blue.\n&gt;     As the Matrix went back into his chest a giant light emitted \nfrom him, it covered the entire planet (got permission) everything on \nthe planet saw this light.\n&gt;     A voice boomed over the planet, all bots could hear this as \nwell, no matter where they were. The voice said, &quot;Arise, Optimus \nPrime.&quot;\n&gt;     Dark Prime had died, Optimus Prime was reborn, with a new drive.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Please add Dark Prime to the Matrix)\n\n\n"}}
