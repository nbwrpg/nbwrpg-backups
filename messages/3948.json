His plans were coming to \nfrutation. He could see the planet that Megatron, Hell Beast, Liono \n(spelling?) Prime, and all the others that were fighting for Cybertron.\n    &quot;I wonder how my good friend Bazooka is?&quot; He muttered to himself. \n&quot;Oh..Can&#39;t forget Bobertron.&quot; \n    Magmatron has no beast mode yet.\n    &quot;Warning, Ionic interfearence. Unable to navigate safe landing. Emergency \nStasis Lock under effect.&quot;\n    Magmatron went into stasis lock. The Ship crashed into the planet \ncauseing a land slide. His ship was buried but Skeletons were uncovered. The \nDNA Scanner came online and began to scan, it malfunctioned because of the \nIonic interfearence and made a Fuzor mode.\n    He awoke and began his plan. Calling out to all the Dinosaurs he could \nreach. But projecting his signal from another location entirely.\n    &quot;Bazooka, Bobertron, Carnage, Dark One, Skywarp, Ramjet, Dirge, \nTerrorsaur, Cyber Claw, Ultracon, Stegotron, Triceradon, Sludge, Swoop, \nSnarl, Slag, Grimlock, Dinobot, Iron Raptor, join me in my quest. I will \nreward you greatly. I will not ask you to destroy your leaders. Simply to \njoin me in my quest. Cybertron will be ours.&quot; Magmatron Signaled to the \nDinosaur Transformers. He awaited the reply. \n\n"}}
