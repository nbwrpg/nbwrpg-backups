Yes, even magma didn&#39;t stopp him from trying to help\n&gt;&gt; his comrad=\r\nes. He&#39;s got some burn marks in his armor, and that&#39;s his damaged\n&gt;&gt; state =\r\nfor now.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BIC:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps the power he had extended outward, was=\r\n in vain. Tucson lies on the\n&gt;&gt; ground for a moment or so, but slowly rolls=\r\n back up onto his left side,\n&gt;&gt; holding up his upper body with his arms whi=\r\nch shake under the sheer pressure\n&gt;&gt; of his weight. He looks around, and fi=\r\nnds Darkhawk, severely weakened by the\n&gt;&gt; powerful blast. Night Shift waste=\r\ns no time in slapping a pair of stasis\n&gt;&gt; cuffs on Darkhawk, who in reality=\r\n was Windlord.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Gotchya. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re in good hands now. Yo, K=\r\nup! Better take this\n&gt;&gt; guy for me, I think Tucson Prime&#39;s commn&#39; around.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson calmly looks around yet with a stern expression on his face.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Not - the result I was hoping for but - it did enable us to get\n&gt;&gt; so=\r\nmewhere. Can&#39;t - have it all I suppose, but doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re giving up\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n all together.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Slowly he makes it onto his knees, and then plants on=\r\ne foot down on the\n&gt;&gt; ground, hoisting himself up to his feet, with a bit o=\r\nf a stumble. He was\n&gt;&gt; weak, extremely weak, and it was questionable wether=\r\n or not he would be able\n&gt;&gt; to continue fighting. He didn&#39;t want anyone to =\r\nsee him in such a condition\n&gt;&gt; though. He fights his weakness and tries to =\r\nshrug off the grogginess he\n&gt;&gt; feels. Night Shift nodds in agreement with T=\r\nucson Prime.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; I hear ya on that one big bot. Sometimes, ya win some,=\r\n ya lose some, and\n&gt;&gt; sometimes it&#39;s kinda like in the middle of both losn&#39;=\r\n and winn&#39;n.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson understood that the mission itself would be diff=\r\nicult so he\n&gt;&gt; prepared himself for the unexpected by working with that unc=\r\nertainty that\n&gt;&gt; plans don&#39;t always go as they are intended. He shrugs off =\r\nthe fact that\n&gt;&gt; Cyclonus is not even scathed by the energy attack. He was =\r\nnow curious about\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus and how he had handled it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Something -=\r\n Rodimus wasn&#39;t too good at doing. I have a feeling he may\n&gt;&gt; not have take=\r\nn this too well, Nightshift.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nightshift narrows his optics.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; =\r\nLemme tell ya somethn&#39; Tucson, before you became a Prime, and he was on\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nthe job, it didn&#39;t look like his spark was totally in his work. But you, th=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; quiet guy in the corner, the guy who threw caution ta the wind ta save=\r\n his\n&gt;&gt; comrades, the guy who faces adversity as it comes and ain&#39;t afraid =\r\nof it,\n&gt;&gt; and the guy who actually learned from his loss rather than compla=\r\nin&#39;n about\n&gt;&gt; it. You got what it takes, and always had it. It - just wasn&#39;=\r\nt obvious\n&gt;&gt; because you&#39;re too modest for your own good and you kinda just=\r\n kept ta\n&gt;&gt; yourself most of the time.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson listens thoughtfully t=\r\no Nightshift.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; You&#39;re right, I wasn&#39;t much for words at the time... =\r\nBut back then, I\n&gt;&gt; wanted to approach Rodimus on his not so pleasurable at=\r\ntitude on his\n&gt;&gt; position as a Prime. It seemed as if he didn&#39;t want it. An=\r\nd you know,\n&gt;&gt; responsibility isn&#39;t for everyone. And for some, it&#39;s second=\r\n nature.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Understandable. Now I admit, I d=\r\nunno if I could ever take your job big\n&gt;&gt; guy. Not that I ain&#39;t capable of =\r\nit, I know I ain&#39;t a good match for the\n&gt;&gt; position. And I ain&#39;t afraid ta =\r\nadmit that.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson Prime nodds once, and studies Cyclonus once more.=\r\n Something dawns\n&gt;&gt; on him. He seemed relieved to be free of something.\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Is it me Cyclonus or do you appear to be liberated of something that ma=\r\ny\n&gt;&gt; have been holding you back? Why do you work with Hydras anyway? What i=\r\ns the\n&gt;&gt; purpose of working with him when you can be your own individual? Y=\r\nour life\n&gt;&gt; should be as you intended, and not what others have intended fo=\r\nr you. It\n&gt;&gt; boils down to freedom. You have the chance to experience freed=\r\nom. If I were\n&gt;&gt; you I&#39;d take that chance now. As a matter of fact, Scorpon=\r\nok, Scourge, what\n&gt;&gt; seems to be holding you two back here, when you yourse=\r\nlves can be your own\n&gt;&gt; individuals as Decepticons? Does Hydras have you on=\r\n some sort of leash? I\n&gt;&gt; see no such restraints so that means if you want =\r\nfreedom you should also\n&gt;&gt; take it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Night Shift could see what Tucso=\r\nn was up to. It was one of his thinking\n&gt;&gt; outside the box kind of strategi=\r\nes. And a strategy that would benefit all\n&gt;&gt; and not just one faction. Tucs=\r\non was trying to break new ground, and as\n&gt;&gt; crazy as it all looked, he sit=\r\ns back to watch it all take place. Tucson\n&gt;&gt; Prime now steps asside and wai=\r\nts to see if any of them either try to destroy\n&gt;&gt; him, or actually agree wi=\r\nth what he was trying to tell them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Whatever any of you chose, your =\r\ndecision is your own and I will not\n&gt;&gt; interfere. We may not be allies, but=\r\n I do respect the need for one&#39;s free\n&gt;&gt; will. But if you attack me, do not=\r\n expect me to be so forgiving.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com &lt;nbwrpg=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Preston Carroll\n&gt;&gt; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight Nodded, she stood up with fear in her face. she was ready\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n to follow Rodimus\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus tapped his code on the door and it sli=\r\nd open.

Yes, even magma didn&#39;t stopp him fr=\r\nom trying to help his comrades. He&#39;s got some burn marks in his armor, =\r\nand that&#39;s his damaged state for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;BIC: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps the power he had extended outward, was in vain. Tuc=\r\nson lies on the ground for a moment or so, but slowly rolls back up onto hi=\r\ns left side, holding up his upper body with his arms which shake under the =\r\nsheer pressure of his weight. He looks around, and finds Darkhawk, severely=\r\n weakened by the powerful blast. Night Shift wastes no time in slapping a p=\r\nair of stasis cuffs on Darkhawk, who in reality was Windlord.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot=\r\n;Gotchya. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re in good hands now. Yo, Kup! Better ta=\r\nke this guy for me, I think Tucson Prime&#39;s commn&#39; around.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Tucson calmly looks around yet with a stern expression on his face.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Not - the result I was hoping for but - it did enable us to get =\r\nsomewhere. Can&#39;t - have it all I suppose, but doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;r=\r\ne giving up all together.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slowly he makes it onto his knees, a=\r\nnd then plants one foot down on the ground, hoisting himself up to his feet=\r\n, with a bit of a stumble. He was weak, extremely weak, and it was question=\r\nable wether or not he would be able to continue fighting. He didn&#39;t wan=\r\nt anyone to see him in such a condition though. He fights his weakness and =\r\ntries to shrug off the grogginess he feels. Night Shift nodds in agreement =\r\nwith Tucson Prime. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot; I hear ya on that one big bot. Sometimes=\r\n, ya win some, ya lose some, and sometimes it&#39;s kinda like in the middl=\r\ne of both losn&#39; and winn&#39;n.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tucson understood that the=\r\n mission itself would be difficult so he prepared himself for the unexpecte=\r\nd by working with that uncertainty that plans don&#39;t always go as they a=\r\nre intended. He shrugs off the fact that Cyclonus is not even scathed by th=\r\ne energy attack. He was now curious about Rodimus and how he had handled it=\r\n. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot; Something - Rodimus wasn&#39;t too good at doing. I have =\r\na feeling he may not have taken this too well, Nightshift.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nig=\r\nhtshift narrows his optics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; Lemme tell ya somethn&#39; Tucson=\r\n, before you became a Prime, and he was on the job, it didn&#39;t look like=\r\n his spark was totally in his work. But you, the quiet guy in the corner, t=\r\nhe guy who threw caution ta the wind ta save his comrades, the guy who face=\r\ns adversity as it comes and ain&#39;t afraid of it, and the guy who actuall=\r\ny learned from his loss rather than complain&#39;n about it. You got what i=\r\nt takes, and always had it. It - just wasn&#39;t obvious because you&#39;re=\r\n too modest for your own good and you kinda just kept ta yourself most of t=\r\nhe time.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Tucson listens thoughtfully to Nightshift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&q=\r\nuot; You&#39;re right, I wasn&#39;t much for words at the time... But back =\r\nthen, I wanted to approach Rodimus on his not so pleasurable attitude on hi=\r\ns position as a Prime. It seemed as if he didn&#39;t want it. And you know,=\r\n responsibility isn&#39;t for everyone. And for some, it&#39;s second natur=\r\ne.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Night Shift nodds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; Understandable. Now I adm=\r\nit, I dunno if I could ever take your job big guy. Not that I ain&#39;t cap=\r\nable of it, I know I ain&#39;t a good match for the position. And I ain&#39=\r\n;t afraid ta admit that.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Tucson Prime nodds once, and studies=\r\n Cyclonus once more. Something dawns on him. He seemed relieved to be free =\r\nof something. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Is it me Cyclonus or do you appear to be libera=\r\nted of something that may have been holding you back? Why do you work with =\r\nHydras anyway? What is the purpose of working with him when you can be your=\r\n own individual? Your life should be as you intended, and not what others h=\r\nave intended for you. It boils down to freedom. You have the chance to expe=\r\nrience freedom. If I were you I&#39;d take that chance now. As a matter of =\r\nfact, Scorponok, Scourge, what seems to be holding you two back here, when =\r\nyou yourselves can be your own individuals as Decepticons? Does Hydras have=\r\n you on some sort of leash? I see no such restraints so that means if you w=\r\nant freedom you should also take it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Night Shift could see wh=\r\nat Tucson was up to. It was one of his thinking outside the box kind of str=\r\nategies. And a strategy that would benefit all and not just one faction. Tu=\r\ncson was trying to break new ground, and as crazy as it all looked, he sits=\r\n back to watch it all take place. Tucson Prime now steps asside and waits t=\r\no see if any of them either try to destroy him, or actually agree with what=\r\n he was trying to tell them.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Whatever any of you chose, your =\r\ndecision is your own and I will not interfere. We may not be allies, but I =\r\ndo respect the need for one&#39;s free will. But if you attack me, do not e=\r\nxpect me to be so forgiving.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%=\r\n40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Preston Ca=\r\nrroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight Nodd=\r\ned, she stood up with fear in her face. she was ready to follow Rodimus&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus tapped his code on the door and it slid open.
