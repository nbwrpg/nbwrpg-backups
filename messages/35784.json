The other \nhalf, the\n&gt; &gt; mechanical one, in a final fight over organic life and it&#39;s \nfuture on\n&gt; &gt; Cyberetron proved a failure for the organic bot.  In the battle \nthey\n&gt; &gt; raged against each other.  With a qucik snap of his wrist the \norganic\n&gt; &gt; bot lashed his special energon whips across his arch-enemy&#39;s face,\n&gt; &gt; blinding him instantly. He remembers how the bot crazed, firing \nal over\n&gt; &gt; the place, and with a crazy shot it all went black for the \nprotector of\n&gt; &gt; organic life.  The shot had put his spark into stasis lock. What \nhad\n&gt; &gt; happened to his foe, his evil half, he did not know. Until not \nlong ago.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Axis looked to Aerotaur. &quot;All right, he&#39;s yours.  I am here if \nyou need\n&gt; &gt; me&quot;  He then turned and noticed Windlord in some trouble.  He \nfired two\n&gt; &gt; missiles at the traiter McGowan while Lokk and Seekker continued \nto fire\n&gt; &gt; 25 shots each at the foe.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lynxiz ran out after Lynxiz and spotting Stranato decides it is \ntime for\n&gt; &gt; payback. Firing three discs set for 1 second explosion on impact \nat him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
