He thought why even bother with Megatron \nanymore. She could always find a spot that was off the charts of Maximal and \nPredacon territory. That way she would never be bothered again. She her life \ncould never be threatened. But she would always have the memories she \ncouldn&#39;t chase away.\n\nShe could see where Megatron&#39;s base was. A cave. He hovered near-by it, \nargueing with herself. She knew he wouldn&#39;t be alone. He had his troops to \nsend before he went out himself to destory her. That was the way he always \nwas. That was a reason why she hated him.\n\nPerhaps she could tear in there, taking out a death wish. There were times \nwhen her memories where so bad, that she wanted to die. She even tried to, \nbut it didn&#39;t work.\n\nBut what was she to do? Leave and continue with the memories of Megatron and \nthe hellish way she looked, taking after a male predacon. Or go inside and \nget herself killed.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
