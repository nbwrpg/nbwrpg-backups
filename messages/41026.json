Not lasers, but \n&gt;bullet=\n&gt;s.&quot; Zardus replies to Chaostaur, then sends a transmission back to the \n&gt;Belth=\n&gt;assan:\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;This is Zardus replying. I think our two factions would indeed gain much \n&gt;t=\n&gt;hrough an alliance. I have some other matters to attend to. Can I contact \n&gt;yo=\n&gt;u when I&#39;m free to meet?&quot;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;I did post for Mosquitor, Alloran.

Computer, spark scan in a radius of 300 \n&gt;miles=\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; from here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The holoscreen projected a detailed map of the region and showed three\n&gt; &gt; sparks at the center.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; &gt; (with a smile) I knew I could count on you!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Melchana entered the room, her training session obviously having helped \n&gt;t=\n&gt;o\n&gt; &gt; manage her fury.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Melchana:\n&gt; &gt; Okay, I found the problem about the diversion core. I&#39;ll skip\n&gt; &gt; technicalities, the main thing is that it&#39;s out of order for a while. \n&gt;We&#39;=\n&gt;ll\n&gt; &gt; have to replace it entirely. If the shield are online, though, they&#39;d \n&gt;sti=\n&gt;ll\n&gt; &gt; be able to prevent damages.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; &gt; Great job, both of you! Now, I&#39;ll contact Zardus and try to make a deal \n&gt;w=\n&gt;ith\n&gt; &gt; him. Computer, open a frequency with the Alliance.\n&gt; &gt; This message is destined to Zardus of the Alliance. I am Belthassan, \n&gt;lead=\n&gt;er\n&gt; &gt; of the Prophets and Tripredacus officer in command of the Earth stage of \n&gt;=\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; operation. As you have met my friend and colleague Daemos, I suggest \n&gt;that=\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; our two factions ally. I think we have many points in common and that we \n&gt;=\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; could provide many benefits to each other.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; T�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse\n&gt; &gt; http://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
