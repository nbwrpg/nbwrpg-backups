But I can&#39;t leave to go \n&gt; anywhere with my work schedule.  But we could find a site where we \n&gt; can post pictures of ourselves and let the members of the group see \n&gt; us that way. What do you think?)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  I was just looking at stuff, and I realized that our club has \n&gt; &gt; reached some milestones. I think is the first club I&#39;ve ever been \n&gt; too \n&gt; &gt; where a new post is put in every 30 seconds, which is great for \n&gt; &gt; member imput. We are the friendliest, cheeriest bunch around. \nWe&#39;re \n&gt; &gt; not greedy or anything about winning, it&#39;s just Transformer Fun. \nI \n&gt; &gt; just wanna say thanks for making me a part of this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway, our club is turning a whole year old. Also, we&#39;re coming \nup \n&gt; &gt; to the 10,000th message since using egroupes. And since that was \n&gt; only \n&gt; &gt; a few months ago, it&#39;s a great feet. So what I was thinking was \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; we should do somethimg to get together. You know, have everyone \n&gt; meet \n&gt; &gt; at the chatroom and talk about transformer stuff. It&#39;d be great! \n&gt; Tell \n&gt; &gt; me what you think about it.\n\n\n"}}
