She felt helpless and un\n&gt; able to do anything about her situation.  Then she felt a twinge of\n&gt; courage go through her.  She tried to reopen the connection through\n&gt; the link that Veratis had used.  She used a lot of her own energy,\n&gt; but managed to open up a small link.  She tried to speak, but it\n&gt; didn&#39;t work.  She found that through the computer, she could make her\n&gt; words appear on the console. It wasn&#39;t much, but it was something.\n&gt; She tried to tap into other systems and possable find out more about\n&gt; her surroundings. But the computer was encoded and she couldn&#39;t get\n&gt; very far.  She let her words form on the console screen.\n&gt; &quot;Hello? Anyone there? I need to know about my form. Can my form\n&gt; funtion without the DNA inprinting for a short time?&quot; was what she\n&gt; had left on the screen for Veratis to find.  She then tried to reach\n&gt; a connection to her form. She tried and struggled, but couldn&#39;t make\n&gt; it work.  The mainframe blocked out most of her efforts.  She tried\n&gt; again, but could&#39;t find the connection to the &#39;brain&#39; of the\n&gt; potoform. She got one last idea to try before giving up totally.  She\n&gt; tried to establish a connection to the body of the protoform.  She\n&gt; was able to get a partial link to the arm of the form.  She felt it\n&gt; the connection and she could almost feel the arm itself.  She tried\n&gt; to raise the arm up slightly.  The arm of the protoform moved up\n&gt; about two inches off the table, then back down.  Shadow Wing felt so\n&gt; excited that she would have jumped around if she could have.  She\n&gt; couldn&#39;t help but feel overjoyed at her accomplishment.  never before\n&gt; would she take moving and being able to control her own body for\n&gt; granted again.  She was extatic.  She printed up on the console,&quot;I\n&gt; did it, I made it move, I did it!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
