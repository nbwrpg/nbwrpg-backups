But, then again, Maxima never knew \nher at all. \n&gt; Rather wary of another, she moved & shifted. She was weak & unable \nto \n&gt; confront what she may have believed Blackstorm to be a possible \nthreat. She \n&gt; watched her for a moment, her optics glued to her like a hawk \nwatching a \n&gt; mouse. Her long black claws flexed.\n\n\n"}}
