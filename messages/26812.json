He turns to Killfest, and over his comlink speaks &quot;we need to\n&gt; get in there to check what is going on, we will let Astroblast check it\n&gt; out, we&#39;ll keep them busy. He then turns to Liono, &quot;Now Maximal, feel the\n&gt; anger of a Decepticon, and he swings towards his enemy. As he move he\n&gt; silently on a different frequency from everyone, so no one else  could\n&gt; normally hear it (unless they intercept) &quot;Astroblast, I will keep them\n&gt; busy, get on the ark and find our target.
