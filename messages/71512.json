Perhaps two individuals could fit in on=\r\ne chamber if that chamber were large enough.  As far as he knew, the last c=\r\nhamber he was in was large enough to accommodate another mech, provided tha=\r\nt his guest was not too large.  In his case, Talon was just right.

This time would be more than just therapeutic.  With a feel of h=\r\nis hand over the control panel, he types in several codes that would allow =\r\nfor repairs and the presence of another individual at the same time.  \n\n&quot; I=\r\n know you took quite a bit of damage yourself.  I programmed the chamber to=\r\n repair us both simultaneously .  And that could take a while which will gi=\r\nve us plenty of quality time alone.&quot;\n\nAs his chamber opens, Tucson gently s=\r\neats Talon down first and takes a seat next to her in a position where he c=\r\nould lay back and not harm her in the process.  With a gentile coaxing he l=\r\nays both Talon and himself down on the comfortable repair bench.  There was=\r\n just one minor formality.  He had never invited a femme bot to partake in =\r\nformal courtship, and had no idea what it would entail.  With a playful loo=\r\nk of bewilderment, Tucson gives a light chuckle.\n\n&quot; I just realized somethi=\r\nng.  I have no idea what I&#39;m doing.  I&#39;ve never engaged   in active courtsh=\r\nip in my life.  You&#39;re the first and only love I will ever have.  I may mak=\r\ne a few mistakes so please let me know if I do.&quot;\n\nThe door to the chamber c=\r\nloses and soon they are together, alone at last.\n\n\nPerpetually on the move =\r\nand constantly busy. \n\nOn Jul 24, 2011, at 3:54 AM, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;ai=\r\nrly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n    \n  Talon:\n\n  Talon&#39;s face brighter and sa=\r\nid soflty &quot;I want it&quot;\n\n  -----Mensaje original----- \n  From: Sandy\n  Sent: =\r\nSaturday, July 23, 2011 9:09 AM\n  To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re:=\r\n Changing times (Cue: All Maximals & Autobots)\n\n  Tucson could sense Talon =\r\nclose to him and gives her a heart felt smile and \n  gently holds her hand.=\r\n The look on his face tells of a priceless feeling of \n  perpetual joy that=\r\n could only be felt when in the company of those you love. \n  He had found =\r\nhappiness the moment he met her, which to him was far more \n  valuable than=\r\n the most powerful weapon in the universe.
