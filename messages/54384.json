First, \nlet the spy think we will take out thier bases main power supply, \nthere by misleading them for surely the spy will tell them of our \nplan. Then, we send another in to take a hostage. Not the one closest \none to thier leader, but the one with most knowlage of thier base and \nweapons and tactics. Then we reprogram that bot to our side. In the \nmean time, we attack from the front and side with a main assault. We \ndo what damage we can to thier base and leave. With the hostage \nconverted to our side we can find another way to create more damage \nto them and possable bring them down for good. this is my humble \nopinion Commander Hydras.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
