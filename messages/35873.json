His cry of joy was prematurely inturupted as\n&gt; two laser beams pierced the smoke below. &quot;Cybrats beware, they&#39;re more\n&gt; durable than we figured.&quot; The buglike bot swerved aside dodging the beams\n&gt; scanning them as they struck the building behind him. a laser line connected\n&gt; two blades on his arm, he launched it down onto the street below hoping to\n&gt; measure Grimlocks strength by pinning him to the ground before disassembling\n&gt; him.\n&gt; ------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The bot swears, spinning around and jumping back. His scanners locate the\n&gt; bot that had attacked him, and he fires a missile back.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; Doggeds line had hit it&#39;s target but for some reason didn&#39;t hold. He lept\n&gt; skyward drawing his disk launcher. He fired a stasis disk at the bum\n&gt; planning on the disks energy draining qualities to down his opponent. A\n&gt; missle steeked by him striking a building behind him. debris began to fall\n&gt; forcing Doggeds attention to be diverted. he lept from side to side using\n&gt; his speed to avoid the falling metal. he quickly grabbed a jagged piece of\n&gt; metal andhurled it with all the velocity he could muster at the bum.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: robertdahl &lt;rdahl@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 28, 2001 8:13 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Grimlock kept smelling Repugnas. Yes, he knew this robot. It was an\n&gt;  &gt; Autobot. He sighed. That meant it would be wrong to rip it apart. &quot;Me\n&gt;  &gt; say are you...&quot; he was cut off as the two armor piercing shells hit him,\n&gt;  &gt; and exploded, sending him falling on his side. He snarled, turned his\n&gt;  &gt; head, and opened his mouth, letting loose a stream of laser fire at the\n&gt;  &gt; attacker. &quot;Yeh, now Dinobots stomp.&quot;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
