Not from the stats that I know. Raksha&#39;s site even has a \npretty \n&gt; good set up of sizes.

Installing new parts is generally time-\nconsuming, \n&gt; &gt; but the Autobot makes relatively short work of it.  After a few \n&gt; hours \n&gt; &gt; of welding, digging, and installing the necessary subroutines for \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; transformation to work, he feels his patient is ready to face the \n&gt; &gt; world, and reactivates her.  &quot;There you are.  How do you feel?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Her optics flutter & glow as she awakens. Then sits up. She didn&#39;t \n&gt; notice much difference. Wishing that she could run the quick \n&gt; diagnostics that she once was able to do. But she did the best she \n&gt; could, flexing & lookign herself over. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Feels good,&quot; as she slid off the &#39;table&#39;. &quot;I thank you. Now... you \n&gt; are still going to rebuilt my old form, correct?&quot;\n\n&quot;Right.&quot;  He gives her the thumbs-up.  &quot;Like I said, it&#39;ll take a few \ndays - longer if Hydras or the Tripreds make trouble.  But I&#39;ll do \nthe best I can.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
