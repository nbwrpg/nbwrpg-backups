At some point Elder will be called\naway, but right now he is still free.\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing up at the LORD ELDER, Wheelie glanced up at him from his position\n&gt; over nearby the ARK.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, WHEELIE spoke, &quot;They went out looking for a fight.  They did not\n&gt; intend to go gentle into that good night.  While everyone is about and away,\n&gt; someone else may come to play.  The Ark is what&#39;s here in the past, someone\n&gt; else may consider it to be excessive ballast.  Something is up, what I don&#39;t\n&gt; know, I just know I see Maximals about on the go.  I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re\n&gt; running around, nor what they intend to do on the ground.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Watching as the assault team zipped away, &quot;Something may happen to call them\n&gt; back, or they may encounter a bit of flak.  What they intend, I don&#39;t know.\n&gt; I just know you don&#39;t put your all into one big throw.  You sometimes want\n&gt; to hold some back, just in case you get a smack.  If they go into a trap, be\n&gt; lured away for an attack.  At the Ark some of us must stay.  Especially\n&gt; while everyone else is away.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Continuing to glance around, &quot;This planet is not as it will be, etched into\n&gt; my memory.  It will be different some day.  I don&#39;t belong here any way.\n&gt; But what way iwll it go?  That is what I do not know.  Will I still someday\n&gt; meet my friend?  Even though he will die in the end?  I do not know what\n&gt; will be our fate.  I can only simply commisserate.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLORD ELDER sat down next to wheelie and looked in the same direction\nthat WHEELIE had been looking until he came and interupted. &quot;The\nstars.&quot; he said as if in thought. &quot;They come and they go and yet there\nis little we can do but chart their course and watch them as they\nmove.&quot;\n\nHe smiled, &quot;Not so with Maximals and even Predacons. So many things\nchange us, move us. Things that at one time seemed immutable are\nthings of the past.&quot; He looked back at the stars, &quot;But one day this\nplanet will change, and the stars above it will change and hopefully\nwhat we do now won&#39;t change that.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from ELDER, &quot;But yes, some of us must stay behind to\nguard the Ark. in a way it is that last bastion against change.&quot;\n\nThere was a thoughtful look, &quot;But earlier you seemed so upset.&quot; ELDER\nwas of course talking about the meeting that WHEELIE had a part in\ndisturbing. &quot;Your wit seemed unusually sharp. Is there something else\non your mind?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
