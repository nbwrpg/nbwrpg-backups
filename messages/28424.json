That would mean that most attempts to pick him up \nwould be futile. The chains especially would fail (I was in a hurry \nposting at school and didn&#39;t realize that), and probably so would \nMenasor&#39;s and anyone else&#39;s grabs. However, Firearm is in stasis lock \nand can&#39;t move at all, so I can&#39;t really post for him being moved; \nthe person moving him would be responsible for posting for it.\n\n\n"}}
