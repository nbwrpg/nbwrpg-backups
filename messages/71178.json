Better to be cautious, rather than just throw themselves into a bat=\r\ntle that wasn&#39;t theirs.  Yet they knew that they had to still rescue Cheeto=\r\nr, and that was their main focus.  Night Shift and Rattrap crouch low to th=\r\ne ground, behind vegitation to avoid being seen.\n\n&quot; Slag, we got serious wa=\r\nrfare gon&#39; on ahead of us, and I know what&#39;s gonna happen when we get movn&#39;=\r\n.  Them ben&#39; some sort of Insecticon species, they&#39;re really gonna pick up =\r\non me.  I highly doubt an Autobot&#39;s gonna be able ta go un noticed around t=\r\nhose guys, but you might be able ta slip past &#39;em Rattrap.&quot;\n\nRattrap swallo=\r\nws hard.\n\n&quot;Umm, I suppose there&#39;s no go&#39;n back now is there?&quot;\n\nNight Shift =\r\nputs a hand on his shoulder.\n\n&quot;Believe me, if there was, I&#39;d be there right=\r\n with ya.  But we gotta do this for Cheetor.&quot;\n\nRattrap nodds, and gets into=\r\n his beast mode.\n\n&quot;I suppose if I stay real low ta the ground&#39;n under the b=\r\nrush, I should be okay.  I&#39;ll keep my com link open.  You on the other hand=\r\n, maybe it&#39;s not such a bad idea that ya get back inta your wheels.  Ya mig=\r\nht need &#39;em for a fast getaway.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds and transforms into veh=\r\nicle mode, backing into a thick area of dense vegitation.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll stay here,=\r\n headlights off.  If ya need help, com link me and I&#39;ll show ya where I am.=\r\n&quot;\n\nRattrap nodds and then scrambles beneath the brush, continuing forward w=\r\nithout Night Shift.  \n\nThe tiny rodent continues on his way.  He keeps quie=\r\nt and uses his nose and ears to direct him toward the source of the fire bl=\r\nasts.  He hoped he could at least see if Cheetor was anywhere close by.  Bu=\r\nt like everything else, it would be a shot in the dark.  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As Nightshift =\r\nand Rat Trap move in, they can definitely hear the sounds of a\n&gt; battle goi=\r\nng on. The smell of ozone fills the air, obviously there has been\n&gt; a lot o=\r\nf laser fire, but the smell of gun powder and explosives gives\n&gt; testimony =\r\nto the other kinds of ordinance that have been in use as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the =\r\nduo gets closer, it is easy to discern where it was coming from as\n&gt; they a=\r\npproached. As they got closer they came across what appeared to be\n&gt; Insect=\r\nicons, or at least their clones, since there were duplicates of\n&gt; several d=\r\nifferent ones. There were several that looked as if they turned\n&gt; into a gr=\r\neen and orange bee, another four or five that turned into a green\n&gt; and yel=\r\nlow Rhinoceros beetle of some sort. A yellow and black locust could\n&gt; be se=\r\nen flapping only one set of wings, but was buzzing angrily at a tree it\n&gt; w=\r\nas lodged inside of, even as several brown stag beetles were lying strewn\n&gt;=\r\n about. All of them in various sorts of extreme damage, none of them looked=\r\n\n&gt; to be functional or if they were, capable of being aware of Nightshift a=\r\nnd\n&gt; Rat Trap as they made their way through.\n&gt; \n&gt; However also mixed among=\r\n the frames of the insecticons are the remains of\n&gt; the insect like creatur=\r\nes that the Maximals had encountered underground, and\n&gt; like before they we=\r\nre of different sizes and configurations, but were easily\n&gt; recognizable. A=\r\nnd much like the Insecticons, they lay in various degrees of\n&gt; lifelessness=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only action lay ahead, as through the trees the duo continued to=\r\n hear\n&gt; the sounds of battle and could see the bright flashing lights of la=\r\nser fire.\n&gt; What ever was going on it was just ahead!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Prest=\r\non\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
