We&#39;ll see about that.&quot;  He uses the computer to take a \nlook at the program creating and controlling the shielding codes.  \n&quot;Interesting work, I&#39;m almost impressed.&quot;  He then sets about a flurry of \nprograming to duplicate the program.  It didn&#39;t take very long because he had \na template by looking at Grounded&#39;s program.  He then created four codes.  He \nconnected himself to the computer and downloaded one code.  With that done he \nsets up a fire wall so that only he can get at this new program.  He opens a \ntight band com to Aerotaur, Perplex, and Windlord.  &quot;Please come to my \nposition.&quot;  He was going to offer a code to Nightlight but he had seen her \nreceive one from Grounded.\n\n"}}
