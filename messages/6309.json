He saw\n&gt; Bobertron there, but paid him no mind. Instead he went over to the console\nof\n&gt; a computer and opened a glass hatch. Inside was a Red Button. He pressed\nit.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; ::Destron Base::\n&gt;\n&gt;     The ship came alive at the push of the Red Button. Gears whirred and\n&gt; hissed, the outer hull guns came back online, they started shooting\nwhatever\n&gt; rocks they could. Many of the rocks were blasted, but a gun created a land\n&gt; slide, many fell off that way. The ship&#39;s main weapon came online once\nthere\n&gt; was enough room to manuver. Now the Destron Base is open on one side of\nthe\n&gt; mountain. (Possibilites for arial attack)\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; ::CyberShark::\n&gt;\n&gt;     He saw the changes in the Destron Base, he knew it was time, he needed\nto\n&gt; get back to base to see what type of foe they are up against.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; ::Magmatron::\n&gt;\n&gt;     Pleased with his work he decided it was time for Phase Two. He opened\na\n&gt; comm  to all Maximals on the planet. His message went something like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;     &quot;Attention all Maximals. I am Magmatron, leader of the Destrons. I am\n&gt; emploring you help in the destruction of the Predacon ship Iron Fist. I\nhave\n&gt; seen it&#39;s weapons up close and I know what it is capable of. If it gets\noff\n&gt; this planet with enough Energon it could potentily destroy Cybertron\nitself.\n&gt; I am asking you as a fellow Cybertronian to help stop this from ever\n&gt; occuring. You may ask for whatever you may need in destroying the ship,\nand\n&gt; to help repair whatever damaged systems you may have, I open all my\nresources\n&gt; to you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;     He sent the message and went to prepare the ship in the Weapons Room.\n&gt; (Samething as Weapons locker)\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Conference Calling with Firetalk!\n&gt; Click Here!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5480/13/_/_/_/963253332/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
