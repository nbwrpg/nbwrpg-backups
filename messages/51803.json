First of all, your name isn&#39;t Kyle, and I refuse to call you that from now on.  Second of all, about your intelligence.  Being intelligent is only good in a very little way.  You can have the highest IQ in all of damned history, yet it&#39;s still nothing without WISDOM.  You lack wisdom, and therefore your intelligence is a joke. Second of all, I am not weird if I don&#39;t see women as nothing more than mere sexual objects.  I don&#39;t want to have children or marry somebody.  I extremely LOVE being alone, and I plan to be alone all of my life.  If I EVER want to have somebody there for me, it might as well be the VERY few friends I have.  Let&#39;s just say I have a lot less than 5 friends.  True friends, anyway.  Even if I haven&#39;t seen them.  Hehe.  Anyway, if all you think about in a woman is bed, why don&#39;t you go watch XPW or something. Pooboy, the way you suggested to Airly wasn&#39;t polite, all it displayed was ignorance and self-absorbsion.  So get lost.
