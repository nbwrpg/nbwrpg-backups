His mind was torn with visions of the Buggers he \nhad just \n&gt; annihilated.  He flew onward for many weeks as millennia passed in \nreal time. \n&gt;  His personal transport which had been equipped with one bomb \ncapable of \n&gt; destroying a world.  He had used that already and was now unarmed.\n&gt; \n&gt;     By some bizarre quirk of fate his transport stumbled into a \nhole in the \n&gt; fabric of space and time.  He was flung out millions of years \nbefore he had \n&gt; destroyed the bugger homeworld.  He was flung out millions of miles \nfrom \n&gt; where he had last been.  He was flung out spinning toward Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt;     He was able to gain enough control to not crash so hard as to \ndie on \n&gt; impact but he did happen to land on Enertron who died.  Before he \nstepped out \n&gt; he realized that he would need an alternate form for this strange \nworld.  For \n&gt; a touch of irony he chose the form of the bugger drones he had just \n&gt; annihilated millions of years in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt;     He stepped out and looked around.  He was on an open field \nsurrounded by, \n&gt; well, field.  This would not do to hide his ship.  He got back in \nand found a \n&gt; cave in the Appalachian Mountains half way around the world.  He \nseals the \n&gt; cave with a few shots burying the only opening.  He was careful to \nleave no \n&gt; new openings in it&#39;s wake.  It would appear to any passerby that it \nwas \n&gt; simply a recent rockslide.\n&gt; \n&gt;     He knew that there were at least some other bots here from his \nbrief and \n&gt; violent trip through the atmosphere.  Ender transmits a brief \nmessage on all \n&gt; channels.  &quot;This is Ender I wish to find someone else here.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
