The cavern stretched out for perhaps a\n&gt; mile or mo=\r\nre in diameter and was maybe two or three hundred feet from\n&gt; floor to ciel=\r\ning.\n&gt; \n&gt; The cieling itself had large stalactites reaching down perhaps 30=\r\n feet\n&gt; from the cieiling, while there are an equal number of stalagmites\n&gt;=\r\n rising from the floor. There is even a sparse type of fungi-like\n&gt; vegatat=\r\nion down here, although it is different from anything seen on\n&gt; the surface=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the center of the chasm, about a mile away from the tunnel entran=\r\nce\n&gt; there was a large cylinder of yellow light fire rising from the floor\n=\r\n&gt; of the cave and disapearing into a hole in the cieling. It\n&gt; superficiall=\r\ny looked like fire it also had the look of some sort of\n&gt; energy as sparks =\r\ncrackled and arced all around it.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is this flickering light that was=\r\n noticable from the tunnel as the\n&gt; light itself bathed the cavern.\n&gt; \n&gt; At=\r\n the bottom of the the columb of fire was a large black pit and\n&gt; hanging s=\r\nuspended above it by blackened chains was a tiny figure in\n&gt; red . . .

Leo, Big Convoy, I would like the heavier&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; M=\r\naximals to follow behind with you, and the Maximals who are swift and&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; agility based to follow me.  You can chose whoever you deem fits either=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; category.  This also holds true for the Predicons assisting in ou=\r\nr efforts.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; We have a greater chance at success if we work strategi=\r\ncally.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME looked over at BIG CONVOY.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Yeah, they are all like this in the begining.&quot; CONVOY said. &quot;Youn=\r\ng&lt;br&gt;\nand full of confidence.&quot; There was a chuckle from CONVOY, &quot;As the&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nhumans have said, ten foot tall and bullet proof.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLooking back a=\r\nt TUSCON there was a nod from LEO PRIME, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; He&lt;br&gt;\nsaid as the oth=\r\ner MAXIMALS rallied up around them.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs they moved on the tunnel tu=\r\nrned abruptly and showed them the&lt;br&gt;\nreasoning for the flickering light as=\r\n the tunnel ended at a ledge, a&lt;br&gt;\nledge that was hundreds of feet from th=\r\ne floor of a vast cavern, the&lt;br&gt;\ncieling of which was nearly fifty feet ab=\r\nove the top of the tunnel&lt;br&gt;\nthey had just emerged from. The cavern stretc=\r\nhed out for perhaps a&lt;br&gt;\nmile or more in diameter and was maybe two or thr=\r\nee hundred feet from&lt;br&gt;\nfloor to cieling.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe cieling itself had =\r\nlarge stalactites reaching down perhaps 30 feet&lt;br&gt;\nfrom the cieiling, whil=\r\ne there are an equal number of stalagmites&lt;br&gt;\nrising from the floor. There=\r\n is even a sparse type of fungi-like&lt;br&gt;\nvegatation down here, although it =\r\nis different from anything seen on&lt;br&gt;\nthe surface.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn the center =\r\nof the chasm, about a mile away from the tunnel entrance&lt;br&gt;\nthere was a la=\r\nrge cylinder of yellow light fire rising from the floor&lt;br&gt;\nof the cave and=\r\n disapearing into a hole in the cieling. It&lt;br&gt;\nsuperficially looked like f=\r\nire it also had the look of some sort of&lt;br&gt;\nenergy as sparks crackled and =\r\narced all around it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt is this flickering light that was noticabl=\r\ne from the tunnel as the&lt;br&gt;\nlight itself bathed the cavern.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt th=\r\ne bottom of the the columb of fire was a large black pit and&lt;br&gt;\nhanging su=\r\nspended above it by blackened chains was a tiny figure in&lt;br&gt;\nred . . . OPT=\r\nIMUS PRIME who was being bathed in that very fire!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAlthough it was=\r\n difficult to see at nearly a mile distant, the tiny&lt;br&gt;\nfigures of MAGMATR=\r\nON and SABERBACK were standing watching. Around them&lt;br&gt;\nwere arrayed SHARK=\r\nTICONS and some others that from that distance&lt;br&gt;\nappeared to be DINOBOTS =\r\nor at least something akin to them.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBut even at the distance there=\r\n was a booming chuckle that sounded like&lt;br&gt;\nit came from SABERBACK even th=\r\nough he was still merely a mile away!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockq=\r\nuote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-98809C21-1752-4614-BDDF-2E0F90FA6FB5--\r\n\n"}}
