Oh, um by the way, \n&gt;&gt; maybe you should thank Tucson for helping you. After all, he took a real \n&gt;&gt; gamble in going back into that tunnel to find you.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Yeah, it was a real bumpy ride too. He couldn&#39;t let ya sit there and get \n&gt;&gt; destroyed, he risked his spark ta save ya, and I&#39;m glad we got ya back.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson directs an ear toward Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, no one is going to go after you, as long as my spark \n&gt;&gt; remains strong. Rodimus, we&#39;ve been through a great ordeal, but I promise \n&gt;&gt; you that no harm to you will go un noticed. That hive has caused nothing \n&gt;&gt; but strife for all of us, and I will not tolerate that happening again. \n&gt;&gt; So here is where we stand.. We have two enemies to vanquish. Yet in order \n&gt;&gt; to stop one, we must stop the other. We need to know everything there is \n&gt;&gt; about those insectoids, and find out their weaknesses, and subdue them. \n&gt;&gt; Then, we will deal with what comes afterwards. I can only hope that all \n&gt;&gt; of us, including Windlord, will be able to turn the tables which \n&gt;&gt; desperately need turning.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus looked relieved as he heard about Eilita and Nightlight, a\n&gt; smile blossoming across his face, &quot;Good.&quot; he said, his optics bright\n&gt; with joy. He looked over at Tuscon, &quot;My friend you have saved me from\n&gt; the brink.&quot; His smiled dimmed a bit as he thought about what had just\n&gt; happened, about what he and Tuscon had just experienced.\n&gt;\n&gt; He was about to say something when when . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;DAAAADDDD!!!&quot;said a very happy childish voice. ELita Ran towards hers \n&gt;&gt; dad\n&gt;&gt; and Huged him tightly&quot;You and my mom came back!!!! I missed you daddy.... \n&gt;&gt; I\n&gt;&gt; miss you and my mom&quot;Elita started to sob&quot;you never leave me again, \n&gt;&gt; neither\n&gt;&gt; my mom, will you? will you never leave again? Mom still is in Cr Chamber \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; uncle Kup is with Windlord&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I am back, and missed you too.&quot; Rodimus said cradling Elita against\n&gt; his chest. &quot;I will always keep you and your mother safe.&quot; he said, his\n&gt; mind still running over the past events and wondering with all that\n&gt; was going on could any of them ever make that promise, that he would\n&gt; never leave them. he wished he could.\n&gt;\n&gt; He nodded to Tuscon&#39;s question about joining him, unsure what this\n&gt; would mean for Elita, but her knew that there was so much that had to\n&gt; be said.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;I jsut Finished, little one&quot;said Kup while he arrived to the room &quot;He \n&gt;&gt; will\n&gt;&gt; wake up soon... Now Perceptor, what can you tell us about the strage\n&gt;&gt; behavior of Nightlight? Why she acted as she did in the BLackfortress? \n&gt;&gt; why\n&gt;&gt; she ran of us ?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;She is a predacon, still she is; and as a predacon she behaves like\n&gt;&gt; one&quot;said dryly the male &quot;Well almost a predacon&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;What you mean?&quot;said Talon\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;I havent time to do a conventional reprogram process and she was to weak \n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; endure one&quot;Said Dryly Perceptor&quot;and and i wont continue giving more \n&gt;&gt; details\n&gt;&gt; cause this little bot will have nightmares if she hear it and some \n&gt;&gt; details I\n&gt;&gt; only told them to Tucson and Rodimus...&quot;and moving his head towars \n&gt;&gt; Rodimus\n&gt;&gt; and Tucson said&quot;I dotn know that if is the right way in Maximals but in\n&gt;&gt; Predacons some info just the comander knows it&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus stood carrying Elita in his arms, showing a surprising amount\n&gt; of energy for a bot who had just a few minutes earlier been in a deep\n&gt; life threatening coma. &quot;Young one.&quot; he said, talking to Elita, his\n&gt; voice dropping for her ears only, &quot;we grown ups have a few things to\n&gt; discuss. Go keep an eye on mommy until I get there.&quot; His was the voice\n&gt; of a loving father, a mixture of both authority and affection. There\n&gt; was so much going on and they had to get it all out in the open before\n&gt; things progressed too far.\n&gt;\n&gt; Torca the leader and general of the Maximal Fuzors also stepped into\n&gt; the room, his large tusks that were attached to his shoulder rose up\n&gt; over his head barely missed the cieling as he ducked down slightly to\n&gt; come through the doorway. He looked around his optics softening\n&gt; slightly as he saw for himself that Rodimus was awake.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes indeed we do have much to discuss.&quot; his deep voice boomed across\n&gt; the room. He looked at Perceptor for a long moment as if he were about\n&gt; to send him out of the room, but then he just turned his massive head\n&gt; to peer at Rodimus and then Tuscon, &quot;And then I am sure both of you\n&gt; will need your rest.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
