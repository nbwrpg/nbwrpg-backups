Thick fog covered the shore of the small \nisland sitting northwest of a greater continent. The last memory he \nremembered before he had entered the stasis pod was being on Cybertron, and \nbeing forced to leave his homeworld... He didn&#39;t quite remember why \nthough...

May the Matrix guide my journey...\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
