This is the first one. It brings \nup \n&gt; the question of: What did they do with the second blank after \nreviving \n&gt; Optimus Primal.\n&gt; \n&gt; After all this time the blank protoform still sits there where the \n&gt; Maximals have left it.  Finally, something clicks and the scanners \ngo \n&gt; online. It takes a lizard beast mode. Then from deep in the pit a \ndark \n&gt; force, the Inferno himself arises to claim the body. A new spark \nforms \n&gt; in it, Pure Black. Then the Maximal chip starts to work. The power \nof \n&gt; the Inferno overrides it, but not totally. The spark turns blood \nred. \n&gt; A new bot arises. He is engulfed in flame. He turns into a fairly \n&gt; handsome, red eyed, muscular bot, of pure evil. He can sense others \n&gt; with black hearts on this planet. Soon he will have servents to \nobey \n&gt; his every wim.  He walks a few feet and stops.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bot: SHADOW STAR, BLACK DRAGON MODE!\n&gt; \n&gt; His size increases from 10 ft. to 20 ft. as he turns into a dragon \n&gt; (o.k. I confesse I&#39;m sorta coping Cyberwolf). He flys toward a dark \n&gt; force.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: We need to get a few things worked out for this one. For \nstarters \n&gt; even if he gets servants I don&#39;t want the chars. Next, if some \nchars \n&gt; agree to serve him will he be allowed to alter their beast modes \nlike \n&gt; with himself (if you say yes their owners could decide how and \n&gt; naturally they&#39;d change back if they broke up with him), and I can \n&gt; assume more servants means he&#39;s more powerful, and by the way is \nthere \n&gt; a spot open in the Pack it&#39;s hard enough to form one Faction he&#39;ll \n&gt; just try to take over the Pack one by one, oh and I don&#39;t think \nKitkat \n&gt; or Drillbit would like him becaus he has a girl problem (as in \nrapist) \n&gt; but might take the guise of controllability.\n\n\n"}}
