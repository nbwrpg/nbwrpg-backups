He vowed allegiance to his leader and intended to follow it through to\nthe end.\n\nLong range scanners showed Slayer going the opposite direction. He switched\nfrequencies and called Slayer again. &quot;Lead them back toward me, I&#39;ll lay\ndown coverfire.&quot; Ignatius wasn&#39;t facing fire from the fortress so he knew\nthat he was out of range. He transformed to robot mode and dove into the\nwater. he set all operating functions on minimal hoping thier attension\nwould remain on Slayer.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 05, 2001 2:34 PM\nSubject: Re: The Blackfortress\n\n\n&gt; OOC:is it legal that every bot shot 25 times in the same post?\n&gt;\n&gt; Luzbel/Attila/Kali/Shiva/Bat-probes/Black fortress&#39;s defences::\n&gt;\n&gt; Luzbel and Attila avoided the shot and shot against Iguanus (25\n&gt; shots) while Kali and Shivah did the same against Slayer (two of them\n&gt; are missile-signatures, 25 hots)\n&gt;\n&gt; Bat-probes and Fortress did the same.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; In the distance Ignatius used his enhanced Eagle eyes to view the\n&gt; battle.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ignatius to Slayer, watch for my energy signature.&quot; The eagle\n&gt; called out\n&gt; &gt; over Trainer frequency.
