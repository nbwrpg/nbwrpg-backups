She thought for a it was Zardus \nhere to beat her for being so disrespectful to him. She stormed to \nthe door and threw it open, &quot;LOOK I HAVE JUST ABOUT HAD ENOUgh....&quot;\nShe stopped and stared at Cybershark. She couldn&#39;t believe her own \neyes.  There was CyberShark, standing in her doorway looking back at \nher.  Suddenly a flood of emotions from her part with filled her.  \nHer legs felt weak and she almost fell.  She hung onto the door and \nlooked at him. &quot;CyberShark? It&#39;s really you?&quot; She still couldn&#39;t \nbelieve her eyes.  She took a step forward and put her arms around \nhim and embraced him.  Her spark as she felt his in her arms.  A few \ntears rolled down her cheek,&quot;Oh by the Matrix I have missed you.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;David Torrey&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::CyberShark::\n&gt; \n&gt;     Still having no room of his own he was wondering what the \nblazes was going on. He looked around the hallways and noticed things \nthat could be cameras, or sensors. Cloaking was no a good idea.\n&gt;     Just after that he heard a fist slam into a bulkhead. He came \nrunning. He turned a corner and saw Battera just as she went into her \nroom.\n&gt;     &quot;She&#39;s here!&quot; CyberShark said. Many of the past emotion flooded \nhis systems and his eyes went back to blue. He then realized that he \nhad to play the good little solider for the time being, his eyes went \nto crimson again. He walked to the door and pounded on it. &quot;Battera, \nit&#39;s me.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
