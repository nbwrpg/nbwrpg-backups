He fires several shots from his gun, all of them hitting the wall \nbehind the enraged raptor.\n\n&quot;Stand down, Maximal,&quot; Dark One says calmly, sticking his gun through the \nbars on the other side of the room from Iron Raptor, Breakdown doing the \nsame. Both aim their weapons at Tavatron. &quot;Or your friend dies.&quot;\n\nThe Alliance base&#39;s interior defences emerge from the ceiling, aiming at Iron \nRaptor as Pyro and Scavanger aim their weapons at her.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNemesis Enforcer turns his head as the scanners beep, reporting a bot near \nthe base. He swears, activating his comm-link.\n\n&quot;Reptilica, you and Bloodystrike get out there and see what that bot&#39;s all \nabout. While you&#39;re at it, see who the Maxi&#39;s threw at us.&quot;\n\nNemesis Enforcer smiles, sitting back in his chair and bringing up a visual \nof the outside.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica nods, he and Bloodystrike running out of the base and heading for \nBrightBlade.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPunch and Scattershot walk into the brig, both pulling out their weapons when \nthey see Iron Raptor in a rage.\n\n&quot;Hats!&quot; Scattershot yells, jumping forward and firing at Iron Raptor, not \nrealizing that he could hit Hiss, one hand holding DeathStorm&#39;s head on his \nown.\n\nPunch stands near the door, gun ready.\n\n"}}
