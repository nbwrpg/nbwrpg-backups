He raised an arm, firing off a \nblack orb, prematurely blowing it up and interceptin all but three missiles \nwhich connected.\n\nThe Vok gestalt shook violently as missiles tore into his thick armor and \nsmall, small streams of mech-fluid began leaking and dripping towards the \nground.  Dark Wolf&#39;s ascent was slowed down, but he was still going as fast \nas he could.\n\n\n"}}
