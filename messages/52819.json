The explosions started to \n&gt; blow up the engines first, then expanded to the rest of the ship. It \n&gt; did not even have time to crash as it came apart in the air. Burning \n&gt; pieces of metal and smoldering airborne ruins fell down hard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael looked around. His ship and his command were gone, unless \n&gt; Cheetah and Tigerhawk had managed to get out. He was decided to end \n&gt; the battle though. He looked for Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Rodimus, Tyrael here. Mind keeping a piece of Hydras for me?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sanguine and Meteara were in heavy combat. Sanguine rushed at the \nVok \n&gt; and threw her in the air. Meteara quickly engaged her jets to get \n&gt; control, but was hit by a fiery steel beam. She was grounded but \ncame \n&gt; back.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sanguine approached her with deadly determination. She made a fierce \n&gt; looking stiletto out of her hand brought it closer and closer to her \n&gt; enemy&#39;s head.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meteara: Why do you want to kill me?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sanguine breathed heavily. Why? There was too much to be said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sanguine: Your race killed a brethren of mine. There is something in \n&gt; Predacon behavior that is called vengeance. That is what&#39;s going on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Little did she notice the crackling sound growing louder and louder. \n&gt; As the tip of her weapon was in range of the Vok, a massive electric \n&gt; jolt jumped on it and shocked the criminal. She fell hard to the \n&gt; ground too. Meteara stood up. She was clearly wounded too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meteara: I too have many assets. Let&#39;s finish this folly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sanguine: Yes, you are right.\n&gt; \n&gt; In an instant, Meteara started firing innumerable bullets from her \n&gt; machine guns. At the same moment, Sanguine morphed. She made a \nbeast&#39;s \n&gt; head out of her legs and went at Meteara...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
