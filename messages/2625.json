He checks all of his wepons to make sure \nthe were still funtional. He pulled out a cloth and wiped of the \nmechfluid from his sword. He went to the com consol and called for \nBLASTRAGE. He then got some cleaning robots to clean up the mess,\nfrom \nthe fight, as he waited for BLASTRAGE. BLASTRAGE walked in and looked \nat BH then at the robots.\n\nBH said to BLASTRAGE &quot;TAKEDOWN betrayed us. He killed KILLERBOT so I \nhad to kill him.&quot;\n\nBLASTRAGE mouth dropped open. He couldn&#39;t believe it. &quot;BH, go to the \nCR Chamber and heal yourself while I run the ship.&quot;\n\nBH got up from his chair and started heading for the CR Chamber. He \nturns around and looks at BLASTRAGE. &quot;If you need their dead bodies \nthey are in the Brig. Good luck.&quot; BH Steps into the cr chamber.\n\n\n"}}
