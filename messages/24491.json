He flies back upward, heading for FZ.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot hits the ground hard, remaining where he lay as his systems \nrepowered from FZ&#39;s energy draining field.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nLavatron gets to his feet, growling when he sees a Maximal gestalt \nenter the battlefield. He powers his hands for a lightning blast, but \nthen decides that the two gestalts were too close.\n\nInstead, he changes his aim, a giant lightning bolt smashing into the \nunshielded hull of the Cybertronian Fire.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler growls, firing several more shots at Manterror.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ swirls out of the way of Prowl, but is hit by Prowl&#39;s wing and is \nsent spinning down toward the ground. He stabalizes, firing several \nshots at Prowl and recieving Nemesis Enforcer&#39;s message.\n\n&quot;Forget Iron Raptor, get Kluster and bring him to me. I can \nsignificantly help us in this battle that way.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
