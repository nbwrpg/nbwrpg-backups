He was my second character in the RPG (brought in around October or November of &#39;99), and I wasn&#39;t very original back then.\n\n::Mosquitor/Zardus::\n\nMosquitor continues flying up, several shots hitting him in the side but the rest heading toward Celeno because of his continued upward movement. His side was quickly beginning to bleed, but he doesn&#39;t notice.\n\n&quot;Melt, in the name of the leadership!!!&quot; (yes yes, I know that&#39;s a cheap rip-ff of Inferno. Shut up) sounds from his voicebox as the spikes on his mouthpiece lock in, acid beginning to flow from the acid tank on his back, through his mouthpiece, and into Celeno, spreading over her internal circuitry and beginning its work.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus ducks under a feather missile the other hitting him as he dives back behind his plate, coming back out from the other side and firing two missiles at Aelo&#39;s feet, jumping into the air.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: What&#39;s the exactly the thing that the Mouthpieced does???\n&gt; \n&gt; Aelo/celeno/Ocipite:\n&gt; \n&gt; Aelo avoided the Zardus&#39;s attack and fired 2 feather missiles against \n&gt; Zardus. She knew that something happened with one of her \n&gt; sisters, &#39;cause she felt pain in her back; she looked  a Ocipite who \n&gt; was fightting agaisnt Wheeljack and Hurricane and after that looked \n&gt; that Mosquitor was  slaming his mouthpieced into her back, making a \n&gt; lot pain in Celeno. Pain that Aelo and Ocipite share.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Let my sister alone... Insect!!!!!&quot;shouted anger Aelo while she \n&gt; fired 25 energy balls against Mosquitor. Aelo recived 3 WheelJack&#39;s \n&gt; shot but she ignore them, but Hurricane&#39;s lightning bolts stun her... \n&gt; She was fightting now to recover and survive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeno knew that she was figthing for her live; she and her sisters \n&gt; had the power to absorb enemies&#39; energy with her hand and she started \n&gt; to absorb Mosquitor&#39;s energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ocipite dodged most of the Wheeljack&#39;s attacks and few shots hit her \n&gt; in her leg. But she avoided the Hurricane&#39;s lightning and said &quot;Come \n&gt; on you can do it better!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She fired 15 energy balls against Wheeljack and 10 against Hurrican\n\n\n"}}
