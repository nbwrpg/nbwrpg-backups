I may be out of commission f=\r\nor a few days, but it&#39;s not going to\n&gt; kill me. Remember when we talked abo=\r\nut the most powerful force in the\n&gt; universe? How nothing could ever surpas=\r\ns that?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I think so. Ya told me that love is a fo=\r\nrce no one can reckon with.\n&gt; Nothing breaks the bond of friendship no matt=\r\ner how powerful evil becomes.\n&gt; Love knows no boundaries and is the only in=\r\nfinite force that keeps on living\n&gt; even when one has passed on long ago.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson gently straps Rat Trap in more securely.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s right Rat T=\r\nrap. Remember that. It&#39;s our bond as friends that can\n&gt; never be broken. Al=\r\nl of us, including Talon, Elita, Kup, Lord Elder,\n&gt; Depthcharge, Lord Perse=\r\nus, Legacy, Guardia, and Ravenchief have the power\n&gt; within ourselves not b=\r\necause of tyranical strength, but because of that one\n&gt; thing that neither =\r\nHydras, Megatron or Galvatron ever had. And that was True\n&gt; Love. They rule=\r\n with force, not with compassion. Our heart is what is going\n&gt; to win us th=\r\nis battle, our hearts are going to come together as one and we\n&gt; will save =\r\nthose that need to be saved, and rekindle the lights that have\n&gt; nearly bee=\r\nn blown out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He starts up his engines.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; NOW, LET&#39;S DO THIS!

It was=\r\nn&#39;t like ya didn&#39;t warn us because ya did but we weren&#39;t expect=\r\ning that...&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRat Trap rubs his head.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Yeah, tal=\r\nk about the big bang theory.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTucson rolls forward just a sli=\r\nght.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; It even kicked me back a few feet.  I have to learn to=\r\n ground my tires when I use those missiles.  Sorry about that.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nRat Trap gets back into his seat and buckles up.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;So, how =\r\nare we gonna get through this?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTucson parks himself safely waiting=\r\n for the results of his launch.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; We&#39;re going to relight =\r\nthe dark flame.  I have the power within me, the power of the Matrix.  The =\r\ndark flame, represents Rodimus, who&#39;s armor is black as pitch and flami=\r\nng paint job dimmed to a drap pale color.  That&#39;s the fire I need to re=\r\nkindle.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nRat Trap gasps as does Quickstride.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;=\r\nBut Wheels, that might that might do a number on ya.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTuscon =\r\nsighs.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; I know Rat Trap, it will.  I&#39;ll still be a Prime=\r\n no matter what happens, but if all goes well, we will get Rodimus back and=\r\n Cyclonus will pay for his deeds against Primus.  It&#39;s worth the risk m=\r\ny friends, it&#39;s worth the risk.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nRat Trap sheds a tear.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;But but what if it kills ya? What&#39;s Talon gonna do witho=\r\nut ya?  What am I gonna do without ya? Wheels, you&#39;re the only real fri=\r\nend I ever did have.  I don&#39;t wanna lose ya.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTucson coul=\r\nd feel a tear drip on his dashboard.  &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; I promise you Rat Tr=\r\nap, neither Talon or you is going to lose me that easilly.  I may be out of=\r\n commission for a few days, but it&#39;s not going to kill me. Remember whe=\r\nn we talked about the most powerful force in the universe?  How nothing cou=\r\nld ever surpass that?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nRat Trap nodds.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; I thi=\r\nnk so.  Ya told me that love is a force no one can reckon with.  Nothing br=\r\neaks the bond of friendship no matter how powerful evil becomes.  Love know=\r\ns no boundaries and is the only infinite force that keeps on living even wh=\r\nen one has passed on long ago.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nTucson gently straps Rat Tra=\r\np in more securely.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;That&#39;s right Rat Trap.  Remember tha=\r\nt.  It&#39;s our bond as friends that can never be broken.  All of us, incl=\r\nuding Talon, Elita, Kup, Lord Elder, Depthcharge, Lord Perseus, Legacy, Gua=\r\nrdia, and Ravenchief have the power within ourselves not because of tyranic=\r\nal strength, but because of that one thing that neither Hydras, Megatron or=\r\n Galvatron ever had.  And that was True Love.  They rule with force, not wi=\r\nth compassion.  Our heart is what is going to win us this battle, our heart=\r\ns are going to come together as one and we will save those that need to be =\r\nsaved, and rekindle the lights that have nearly been blown out.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nHe starts up his engines.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; NOW, LET&#39;S DO THIS!
