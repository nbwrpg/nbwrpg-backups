She started \ncleaning it up again.  She looked at the box that was sitting on the \ncounter.  She sighed and went back to tidying up the viles and the \nlab tables.  She would have to replace the straps ont he table since \nthey were broken.  She went over to the closet and got out another \nset of the straps.  she reattached them to the table and reset the \ncontrols for the table.  She then went over to the other corner were \nthe controls for the autoguns were inside the lab.  She reset them so \nthey were operational again.\n\nShe finished cleaning up and went back to her console.  She sat down \nat her computer and looked at the link controls. So far, no one has \nreported in and no responce yet from Zardus.\n\n\n"}}
