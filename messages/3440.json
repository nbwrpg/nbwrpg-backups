He tripped and fell, but got back up and continued firing at Injector.\nTriceradon was hit in the arm by Beeline&#39;s blasts.

He then took out his gernade launcher and tried to hit Beeline with it.\nUltracon was hit in the side by Injector&#39;s missiles. It almost made him fall over, but he quickly recovered his balance and fired at Counter Punch.\nnbwrpg@egroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Double Punch/Injector/Manterror/Counter Punch:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch fired two missiles at the back of Stegotron&#39;s left knee.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Beeline dived, firing an optic blast at Triceradon&#39;s left arm.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Counter Punch stumbled back, slamming through a tree and landing face first \n&gt; into mud.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror slowly got up. �Looking to Dark Mouse, he headed for the foilage, \n&gt; retreating.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector got behind a tree, shots digging into it quickly. �Sliding to the \n&gt; side, he fired two stinger missiles at Ultracon, an optic blast at Dark \n&gt; Mouse&#39;s side.\n&gt; \n\n----------\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://home.netscape.com/webmail/\n\n"}}
