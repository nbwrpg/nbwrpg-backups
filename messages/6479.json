She looked down on the \nmountains and valleys as she flew past them.  She found herself \nflying over the old Ark.  She loked down and saw a battle taking \nplace.  She saw Ares ramming Lunarpine.  She screamed, &quot;NOOO!&quot;  \n\nShe woke up to hear her own echo running throuhg the chamber.  Her \nwounds were healing.  She remembered the battle.  She remembered \ngetting from behind and falling to the ground.  \n\n&quot;So how did I get here?&quot;  She understood that someone had to have \nplaced her in the chamber.  She wanted to get back out there and see \nif Lunarpine was ok.  But she had to wait until the damage was \nrepaired.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Smokescreen::\n&gt; \n&gt; Smokescreen runs into the Ark, dragging Shadow Wing behind him.
