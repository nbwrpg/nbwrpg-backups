RAMULUS and WOLFGANG\nwere sitting in the empty seats near NIGHTSHIFT taking turns watching\nhim and then the outside of the shuttle as it hurtled through the air.\nOccasionally they can feel a bit of air turbulance in flight, but\notherwise the trip is largely uneventuful.\n\nHowever as they drew closer to their destination WOLFGANG wistled,\n&quot;Wow! How big is that thing?&quot; He said as he got a look at the\nemmensity of the jungle they were moving towards.\n\nPROWL answered. &quot;Sensors indicate that it is quite large. It is the\narea that will one day be known as the Amazon Basin. The Basin\nencompasses seven million kilometers, though the forest itself\noccupies some 5.5 million kilometers.&quot;\n\n&quot;SLAG!&quot; POLAR CLAW said from his seat.\n\nPROWL turned to look at him, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;\n\n&quot;Communications are getting spotty.&quot; He said as he tapped one of the\ninstruments as if that would turn the communication gear back on. He\nshook his head as it had little affect.\n\n&quot;I am picking up some sort of energy field from the forest.&quot; PROWL\nsaid as he looked back at his instruments. &quot;It seems almost\nUnicronian.&quot;\n\nThere was a grunt from WOLFGANG, &quot;Seems like we are in for the hard\nstretch.&quot; He smiled, &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from RAMULUS as he looked out of the window as the\nJungle was slowly getting closer and closer, but he said nothing.\n\n&quot;Alright! Listen up!&quot; POLAR CLAW said, &quot;If you have any last minute\nmessages that need to be sent back to the Ark send &#39;em now. I am\nsending a update of everything we know. We are about to loose\ncommunications. Get ready.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
