She was stil mad \nand wanted to kill something. She stretched her wings and let go of \nthe branch. She swooped down, angled her wings and flew upward. She \nhad just popped ehr head above the trees when she saw something move \nout of the corner of her eye.  She turned and saw Vulois flying \ntowards her direction. &quot;Oh of all the slagging luck today. First he \nbeats me, now he&#39;s here to kill me I bet. Out to finish me of. Well, \nI&#39;m not letting that left over ball of used motor sludge kill me.&quot;\nShe flew upward and then out, towards the west.  She wanted to see if \nshe could out run him. If not, she would then lose him in the canyons \nbelow in the west sector.  She smiled and thought, catch me if you \ncan engine sludge. She flapped her huge wings hard and took off as \nfast as she could. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; (Sorry logo, but that&#39;s Vulois&#39; whole things.

But than \n&gt; Vulois got an image. He thought he saw something. She was kneeling \n&gt; before him, and they were infront of a big building, and she was \n&gt; crying. He didn&#39;t know what this meant, but he intended to find \nout. \n&gt; He flew after the bot.\n\n\n"}}
