Peeking his head out he looked down \nthe face\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the outside base and dug his claws in slowly scaling downwards \ntowards the\n&gt; &gt; ground far below. This was always a pain of infiltrating and \ncausing\n&gt; &gt; havoc...there was rarely a ground floor exit waiting for him...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; {Panthos}\n&gt; \n&gt;     Panthos continued scaling down the side of the Catz base, hardly\n&gt; suprised there didn&#39;t seem to be even an alarm sounded yet much less \nany\n&gt; kind of response. Smiling he continued on down the ground almost \nwithin\n&gt; leaping range as his metallic claws dug into the plating of the \nships hull,\n&gt; his eyes cautious and always watching, it wouldn&#39;t do for a turret \nto spring\n&gt; out and start firing and be caught unawares.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Only a few more feet then he could transform and head north, \nfrom his\n&gt; internal scanners he watched the cluster of signatures around this \nplace and\n&gt; noted more active signals back at the ruins of the Maximal City. \nFirst down,\n&gt; he chided himself, then switch codes and go meet your maximal \n&quot;brothers&quot;.\n&gt; The feral grin returned to his face plate and he couldn&#39;t suppress \nthe\n&gt; chuckle. Hopefully they&#39;d prove a bit more difficult than this \nbase...\n\n\n"}}
