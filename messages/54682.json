He puts his hand on \n&gt; her shoulder.\n&gt; Kup: Everything will be alright, lass. I&#39;ve known Roddy for centuries. He can \n&gt; take care of himself. He is a tough kid. He grew up when the Decepticons \n&gt; controled Cybertron. Before I got him serving in the war, he used to fight off \n&gt; Decepticreeps on his own. If he promised that he would be comeing back, then you \n&gt; can bet he will. I&#39;ve never seen him love anyone more then you. You just have to \n&gt; understand what all this means to him. Optimus was more then just his mentor, he \n&gt; was like his father. And Galvatron or Hydras has been his biggest rival, the one \n&gt; that no matter what he couldn&#39;t get rid of.

He knew hed be in \n&gt; &gt; danger of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rust plague but he didnt care this was much for imporant. He \n&gt; &gt; transformed into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his two headed dragon beast mode and flew to the coordinates.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I&#39;ll put a profile up as soon as I have a name and \n&gt; &gt; password...hint...hint hint)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Optimus Prime:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;              In his protoform body, Optimus Prime glided his \n&gt; &gt; stolen ship easily \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the void of temporal space. He was heading to Earth to \n&gt; &gt; visit some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friends. Not knowing what he would find when he got there, he \n&gt; &gt; decided he would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need a suitable vehicle mode. He found one in the ships \n&gt; &gt; databanks. A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cybertronian tanker, complete with the ability to lift off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             As he cleared Temp Space he started the scan of the \n&gt; &gt; truck, every \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little detail. Then downloaded the information into himself. He \n&gt; &gt; got up from his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chair, built for the old Autobots and Decpticons, and went to \n&gt; &gt; prepare. As he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incorporated the designs into himself he thought of all the \n&gt; &gt; people on this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet. He was ready.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             He touched his chest, the change to actual bot had \n&gt; &gt; hurt his combined \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spark. Prime was shocked as he entered the atmosphere.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             In the deep Prime voice that had once declared to \n&gt; &gt; Megatron that &quot;one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall stand; one shall fall&quot; he boomed, &quot;Magnus would dare \n&gt; &gt; betray me like that?&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He didn&#39;t even sit down as he entered the atmosphere, the ship \n&gt; &gt; shook. He was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; searching for the bomb that he knew Magnus had planted on the \n&gt; &gt; ship. &quot;Oh, crap.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             The ship&#39;s thrusters exploded, but the rest of the \n&gt; &gt; ship didn&#39;t. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, it careened out of control and slammed into the \n&gt; ground, \n&gt; &gt; throwing Prime \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out of the hatch. He slid across the ground as his ship stopped.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             When he stopped and got up he checked himself over. \n&gt; &gt; He was in full \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operation, just his good looks were damaged. He walked back to \n&gt; &gt; the ship to look. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was in bad shape, his face had been ripped apart, and the \n&gt; &gt; visor over his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ocular systems. Now everyone could see the protoform \n&gt; underneath, \n&gt; &gt; the red eye \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that turned and looked. His faceplate was smashed and dented, \n&gt; &gt; and his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;windshield&quot; chest was broken, so one could see the shoulder \n&gt; &gt; joints on the &gt; inside. All in all he looked like some sort of \n&gt; robot \n&gt; &gt; sent back from the future, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to change the future. His arm was a bit ripped up too, but he \n&gt; &gt; could live with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             Luckily for him, the communications boxes on these \n&gt; &gt; pods were nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible. He would need it to talk to the other bots. \n&gt; &gt; First though was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus and Hydra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             &quot;Rodimus Prime,&quot; he started, with disgust, &quot;and the \n&gt; &gt; one known as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydra. I have a message for you. Magnus is dead. He was killed \n&gt; &gt; trying to stop \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me. But he was unsuccessful. I am requesting a meeting with \n&gt; both \n&gt; &gt; of you, at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these coordinates.

I will \n&gt; &gt; know�&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             With that he cut off the transmission and waited, \n&gt; &gt; checking over his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guns�.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
