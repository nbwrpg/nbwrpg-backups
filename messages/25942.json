If there&#39;s one thing I learned from Deemos it&#39;s when to\nattack when they least expect it! And I taught myself how to hide one&#39;s\nidentity until the real personality is fit to escape! You have ruined my\nplans, my beautiful plans to conquer and rule, and create a world filled\nwith nothingness! And now you die!\n\nSerge aimed at Windlord, but died before he could fire. Perplex flipped back\nto his feet.\n\nPerplex: What was that about?\n\nPerplex looked to Serge. Throughout all of his history, Serge was the stupid\none, the one who never spoke and the one who always tried to be helpful. The\ncrazy one, but never the wily one.\n\nPerplex: I guess we should go home now.\n\nSomeone coughs and Perplex looks back at Serge. Serge was still dead.\nPerplex starts walking back towards the base...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, January 21, 2001 1:47 AM\nSubject: Re: Clash and Serge + Cybertronian Fire battle...\n\n\n&gt; Windlord::\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It was my fault&quot; said the male &quot;I.. shouldn&#39;t have shot...
