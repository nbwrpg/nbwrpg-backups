He scanned them both.\nOne was Destron (Spy Streak) and the other was not\n(Halucigen). He was emmiting a constant feedback to\nMagmatron, Magmatron only had a five second delay\nbetween what the drone saw and when it got to\nMagmatron.\n\nMagmatron:\n\n     &quot;Hmmmm...Interesting,&quot; Magmatron said. &quot;It seems\nthat Spy Streak has made it here after all, well,\ngood. I could use all the troops I can find. I wonder\nif anymore of my minions will be joining me.&quot;\n\nMagmatron Speaking Through Drone:\n\n     The drone&#39;s optics darkened for a second. Then\nwhen they did return they glowed with green instead of\nyellow. Magmatron spoke through his Drone, he would\nhave to make it quick, as he had another Transformer\nto meet. &quot;Greetings my fellow Transformer.&quot; He said to\nHalucigen. &quot;I am pleased that you had found my\nsecondary base, it gives me the opportunity to\ncommunicate with you before the other dispicable\nfactions rip you apart of scrap. I do hope you will\nlisten to what I have to say.\n     &quot;Allow me to introduce myself, I am Magmatron,\nleader of the Destrons. You have already met Spy\nStreak, please do stand down Spy Streak [Spy Streak\nlowered his weapons, but still glares at Halucigen],\nthank you. \n     &quot;As I was saying, I do hope you will come and\nmeet me in person, I would love to eet you. I have a\nfew escourts to bring you to my primary base, if you\nwill allow that of course. Why don&#39;t you stay right\nhere with me until they arrive?&quot; He was emmiting the\nlocation of the drone to the Destrocons, they should\nbe able to find him easily. MagmatronDrone flew up to\na computer terminal and linked up with it. On all the\nscreens of the hallway appeared Magmatron&#39;s face, then\nhe spoke again. &quot;Why don&#39;t you, Spy Streak, go to the\ncoordinates of the other Drone, you are needed there.\n[Spy Streak transformes and flys off towards Europe]\nPlease, at least give me the coursicy of you name.&quot;\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
