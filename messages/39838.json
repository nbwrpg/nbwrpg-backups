Not even a laughing matter, well for me it is, you....well you should be a little more concerend.  Now that I have pinpointed your position, I shall be there to talk in person, and take rightful control of my men.  My ETA is 1 hours twenty minutes.  I have two men that should be arriving shortly before.  Be prepared to stand down.&quot;  Havotron looked at Megatron, smiled, then lifted a finger and brought it down on the close communication button, the screen dying.  &quot;Hahahaha.&quot;\n\nHavotron walked out to see the bridge platforms complete (sorry i really need them to be done, are we still doing what we planned with the Constructicons).  He looked at the new bots.  &quot;You want an alliance, follow us immediatly then.&quot;  Thinking to himself &#39; Hmm, i shall take over them too.&#39;\n\n&quot;Spinster, Constructicons, Needlenose, follow me.  Nightmare, Jagged, Apeface, stay here to protect the base.  Apeface try adn reach Slugslinger and report to Tremor every so often. &quot; With that Havotron blasted off into the air Needlenose transforming and following with Scrapper hanging onto him.\n\n\nnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Spinister nodded to Havotron, then bowed, and slowly backed away. Ever\n&gt; silently, he headed towards the large hole in the craft, and leapt out,\n&gt; his arms extended, as he gracefully, and quietly landed on a part of the\n&gt; ship. He looked up, and saw some creatures had neard, and he stood up,\n&gt; and paced behind the structure holding the wing, but did not reapear.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron looked at Havotron for a good minute, then his lips curled in a\n&gt; sneer. His eyes flared, almost as if to say, how dare you. Then he\n&gt; reared his head back, and began to chuckle. &quot;Mwha ha ha ha ha ha. Who do\n&gt; you think you are? Scrapper, is this some kind of joke?&quot; Megatron asked.\n&gt; He was a little confused.\n&gt;\n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
