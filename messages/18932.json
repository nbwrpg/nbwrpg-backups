He was looking at an\nodd group of Transformers. He turned to Kup.\n&quot;What was that universal greeting, again? Nevermind I remember.&quot; He\nturned back to the odd TFs, and pulled out a Energon stick.\n&quot;Bah weep grana weep nini bong.&quot; The leader excepted the Energon. they\nrepeated the greeting a few time. The Junkions and Autobots danced.\nHe continued to remember the past. His grief over Feline was combating\nthe chip.\n\nOOC: Dont worry he is not turning good anythime soon. He will have a\nbattle of good and evil in his head for a wile though.\n\n"}}
