Sometimes it seemed li=\r\nke they had came past the same river bank several times, and yet they conti=\r\nnued on. \n\nThe forest was, beginning to clear, the older trees finally givi=\r\nng way to smaller younger trees. Eventually they reached the edge of a larg=\r\ne riverbank. The river flowed by swiftly with all sorts of fish and reptili=\r\nan life in abundance. The sun streamed down into the opening in the trees, =\r\nthe skies above seemed open and clear, not a cloud in the skies. But most i=\r\nmportantly there was no sign of any sweeps as well. Either they were hiding=\r\n well, or they were not there. \n\nAcross the river a large was a large clear=\r\ning, one that opened out for nearly several hundred meters. In the middle o=\r\nf it a battle raging! A triceratops was bellowing into the air at what look=\r\ned to be a small T-Rex. Small when compared to some of the larger of its sp=\r\necies, but still larger than the triceratops and FAR larger than Nightshift=\r\n and Rat Trap as they stood off in the trees. \n\nSo far neither of them had =\r\nbeen noticed.  \n\n\n\n"}}
