He runs off after her, her \nvoice drifting back to his ears.\n\nTo the pit with orders, he thought to himself as he kept running, \nthis was much more important than chain of command.\n\n&quot;Iron Raptor, wait up!&quot; he yells, speeding up as he ran after her.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * She flinched and pulled herself away as Prowl stroked her back, \nfeeling \n&gt; disgusted by his touch, but only because she was disgusted with \nherself.\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t transform and she looked like a nightmare, something \nthat she \n&gt; would never have expected in her entire online life!\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning her head Iron Raptor found herself looking sidelong at her \nhazy \n&gt; refelction in the polished hallway wall, her unfamilier arms \npulling in at \n&gt; her sides.\n&gt; Her voice a whisper.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; But I am a monster...because I don&#39;t know what else I could \npossably be.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She clenched her fists, bowed her head and closed her eyes, \nhorrigied and \n&gt; disgusted by her reflection alone.\n&gt; But she shock her head at Prowls words.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; No...nono, this goes deeper then damages. I can FEEL it, living, \nlike \n&gt; crawling like a slimy mass in the back of my mind!! Maybe...Iris \nwill know. \n&gt; She was part of my programming for years, she HAS to know something \nabout \n&gt; this!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that she whipped around, and started down the hall at a \ndead run, \n&gt; going down to all fors in mid-stride to increase her speed.\n&gt; Iron Raptor disappeared down the hall before she could give Prowl \nthe chance \n&gt; to chase after her. But she called back, her rough voice echoing \nover the \n&gt; walls.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Stay here, that&#39;s an order!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * There was no sign of Striker and she somehow knew that he wasn&#39;t \ngoing to \n&gt; be seen around the Maximals anymore, so the only bot Prowl had left \nto take \n&gt; orders from was either Kluster or herself. And even though she was \nunable to \n&gt; transform, that didn&#39;t mean that she was removed of her command.\n&gt; \n&gt; She ran down the halls as fast as she could, her claws pounding \naway at the \n&gt; armored floor as she headed for the back exit, her intended \n&gt; destination...the Ark.*\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________IRIS\n&gt; \n&gt; * There was something wrong besides the fact that the Ark was \nalmost \n&gt; completely gone, something...black. Like a gathering of stormy \nclouds on the \n&gt; edge of a blue sky.\n&gt; However...this was something seriouse. But she knew what it was \nwithout even \n&gt; having to guess.\n&gt; They had merged, her beast modes...and they were refusing to let \nthe logic \n&gt; take complete control...not allowing her to TF into robot mode.\n&gt; And she was on her way to the Ark, for the answer to the question \nIris knew \n&gt; she would ask.\n&gt; And the strange thing was, Iris knew that this would happen, it was \nonly a \n&gt; matter of time.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
