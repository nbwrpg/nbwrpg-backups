It was the sound of scream, one so full of pain that it nearly rattled his senses. But it wasn�t external, it almost seemed to be coming from the least place he had ever expected�his mind.\nThe sound echoed away into the darkness of his thoughts but the shock and sheer force of it still caused him to still, to barely breath in order to have total silence, to simply stop and listen to the last echoes.\nDinobot couldn�t understand it, couldn�t understand how a sound like that could even be�external OR internal. But it was so real, so very real! It seemed as if it had been external, almost like he could hear it with his own mechanism...but it was the loudest in his mind!\nWhere had it come from, what was the location.\nBut the concept that un-nerved him the most was that he KNEW whom that scream belonged to, to the very core of his being he knew! He had heard that same scream when he had used his own repair system on a bot that had risked her life for him, a sound that he had hoped never to hear again. It was Tavatron.\nBut where was she? Where in this slaging dirt ball was she?!\nHis scanners were empty, there were no signatures for hundreds of miles from his location�so where did the scream come from, where was the fembot who had emitted the scream?\nIt was all so confusing, not knowing yet knowing that something was wrong�.something HAD to be wrong!\nHe had felt slightly uneasy when neither their Third-In-Command  and Tavatron did not return, knowing that even negotiations didn�t take THAT long. But he trusted her, trusted her to know what she was doing and take care of herself.\nBut that scream and feeling that something had to have happened to her grew with every breath he took, if one was to look at him now they would say that he looked no different then he always seemed�but he was worried. Not his posture, not his eyes, not his expression and not his attitude displayed any of the worry he felt�.but it was there. Ceasing his spark like the icy grip of a blizzard, constantly there and growing every second. And he didn�t like it.\nIt was unnatural for him to worry so but there wasn�t anything in the known universe that could stop it, it was strange to him but it was the least thing on his mind.\nBut something was wrong, or at least something had to have happened that kept Tavatron and Iron Raptor from returning to the Ark. But then why the scream? Maybe it was his imagination, his subconscious just because he was worried. A bot could sense strange things when they were over stressed, perhaps that was just the reason.\nThough he doubted it as he was just about to move off towards the Cybertronien Fire again, thinking of how he could use the long-range scanners of the ship to locate the two missing fembots�a slight comfort.\nBut that was when it happened again, the sound of a second scream that simply shattered his concentration.\nDinobot stopped in his tracks and covered his hearing mechanisms with his clawed hands, trying to shut out the sound by pressing his hands to the sides of his head as hard as he could. But it was still there, like some awful dream that you just couldn�t wake up from.\nFinally the sound died away again, leaving the Transmetal 2 reptile there completely stunned.\nBut this time there was another sound along with the scream, the sound of grinding gears and snapping wires.\nBut why, what for? Gears, wires, pain�why?\nDinobot shook his head to clear it, the sound still fresh in his thoughts but his mind nolonger fused to trying to salvage the sound.\nNow he knew, without a doubt that something was wrong�completely wrong!\nHis eyes narrowed to slits and a snarl developed on his toothed jaw, the realization of events sinking in. Worry half-replaced by the need to slag whatever or whomever had stalled the two fembot�s return.\nHis head snapped towards the direction in which Tavatron had first headed off in, towards the area where their Third in Command was to meet Bronco for negotiations. If he was going to get to the bottom theses sounds then THERE was the first place to start looking.\nWith a quick look in the direction that he had come he then began to move off towards Grid Zark, the meeting place for the negotiation.\nIf there was anything to lead to the location of Tavatron then it was going to be there, it HAD to be!*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
