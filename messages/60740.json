She then set the\nself-destruct to fifteen seconds, and grabbed her\nbolts, staff, and communicator, the one item of\nDeviner technology she was allowed to have.  She\nplunged it into a compartment in her chest, and popped\nthe cockpit open.\n\nRacing out she shouted, &quot;GET DOWN!&quot;  and leaped behind\na rock, as the ship exploded, not a huge explosion,\nbut enough to ensure there was nothing identifiable.\n\n--- robert riley &lt;bustercross365@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Organics:\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Thank you,&quot; the valkyrie says before turning to the\n&gt; craft and Megatron.\n&gt; &quot;Hello in there, are you alright?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ydrasssil:\n&gt; \n&gt; Ydrassil didn&#39;t know hat to think and sadi&quot;Ok, I&#39;ll\n&gt; do it for this \n&gt; time as you wish&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley\n&gt; &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Organics/ Megatron Revived:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;ll find out when he finds out,&quot; Organics\n&gt; said,&quot;but right now, \n&gt; leave him alone.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Megatron Revived looked deep into the cockpit of\n&gt; the shuttle to \n&gt; see who or what was inside.  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Are you alright in there?&quot; he shouted.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ydrassil:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Your Step-brother????&quot;Ydrassil was surpriced and\n&gt; said &quot;What will \n&gt; &gt; say Rodimus if he knew this???&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley\n&gt; &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Organics:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;But he is also my step brother!
