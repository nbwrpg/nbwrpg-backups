He should be commanding the mission, but some psychotic robot was \nin charge.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown rested comfortably in a chair inside Pyro&#39;s tank mode.  &quot;Speed it \nup you big hunk of scrap.  I want to actually get to the battle in the next \ntwenty-four hours.&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up!&quot; a disembodied voice retorted, the voice filling the entire tank.  \n&quot;If you don&#39;t like my speed, get the slag out.&quot;\n\n---\n\nHiss sat inside a chair as well, this one being the drivers seat to \nScavenger&#39;s HUMV mode.  The scientist-like warrior looked around, examining \nthe terrain as they neared the middle of the dark continent.  &quot;There&#39;s to \nmuch green.&quot;\n\n&quot;I agree.&quot; Scavenger replied, the conversation ending there.\n\n---\n\nImprisoner drove in his armored carrier vehicle mode, both of his companions \ninside.\n\n&quot;We should lay low now that Unitron and his group are dead.  No point in \nseeking them out.  We should signal our craft and get off this worthless \nplanetoid.&quot; \n\n&quot;I&#39;m with Imprisoner.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah.&quot; Choran sighed.  &quot;I guess.  But AFTER, we kick Maximal tailpipe!&quot;\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer&#39;s great leathery wings beat against the air, and the \nboosters in his feet shot out near invisible jets of flames, sending him \nrocketing faster than anyone, Scattershot a couple yards behind and a few \nmore below.\n\n"}}
