He did not like his tone of voice, and f=\r\nelt that his explanation could have been a little less brash.  Especially w=\r\nhen you&#39;re addressing a Prime officer.  His expression hardens quickly.\n\n&quot; =\r\nI appreciate your concerns but I do NOT appreciate your tone of voice!  It&#39;=\r\ns as if you&#39;re trying to stop me from doing what needs to be done!  This wa=\r\nr can not be fought by ourselves, they out number us! And I will do everyth=\r\ning in my power to be sure that our numbers stay stable!&quot;\n\nStraight Shot sw=\r\nallows hard, she holds Elita in her arms, knowing that when Tucson loses hi=\r\ns temper, the whole planet would pretty much know that it was time to leave=\r\n him alone.\n\n&quot;Not good, so not good.  If there&#39;s one thing I learned was no=\r\nt ta get on Tucson&#39;s bad side. Not pretty.&quot;\n\nShe turns to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve =\r\nseen what happens when someone pushes his buttons the wrong way. He&#39;s like =\r\nRatchet, but kind of three times worse.  If he wants ta turn a bot inta  sc=\r\nrap metal, he&#39;ll do it.  It&#39;s happened before..  Umm, maybe I shouldn&#39;t - h=\r\nave mentioned that huh?&quot;\n\nQuickstride now hears Tucson raising his voice, a=\r\nnd looks up to him.\n\n&quot;Uh ohh..  Something tells me we better take cover.&quot;\n\n=\r\nIt was apparent in the clenching of his fists, that Tucson was quite ready =\r\nto defend his arguements in any means possible.  It was what he did when he=\r\n often lost his temper.  Straight Shot takes the brave step to try and calm=\r\n him down.\n\n&quot;Hey, maybe you guys can work something out?  You&#39;re right, we =\r\ndo need help but Legacy&#39;s right too.  It might upset the time balance if we=\r\n attempt ta wake up the Ark too soon.&quot;\n\nTucson turns to her.\n\n&quot; Remember wh=\r\nat Master Yokitron told us vorns ago?&quot;\n\nShe nodds.\n\n&quot;Yes, sometimes the unt=\r\nhinkable must be the thinkable.  It was his way of saying that in desperate=\r\n times, desperate measures can not be avoided.  Even if the balance of time=\r\n does get disrupted.&quot;\n\nHe nodds.\n\n&quot; Exactly.  We need help, and maybe it is=\r\nn&#39;t time to wake up Optimus Prime, but we must try and revive others to ass=\r\nist us in battle.  Legacy, I warn you now, insubordination will not be tole=\r\nrated.  Am I understood?&quot; \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;=\r\nsupercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He kneels next to the body of=\r\n Optimus Prime, as a strong desire to do so, compells him to place a hand u=\r\npon his chest, where his Matrix lays dorment.
