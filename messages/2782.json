This was enough. First Prowl, a maximal under his command, \norders him to get to a meeting, and then Sniper tells him he is in charge!\n\nHe stands up, walking to Prowl and Sniper. &quot;Enough. You two return to the war \nroom and sit down,&quot; he says firmly, &quot;That&#39;s an order, Prowl,&quot; he adds as he \nsees the maximal stiffen.\n\nProwl sighs, looking back at the explosion. He wanted to make sure Iron \nRaptor was ok, but his commander was ordering him to return to the war room. \nHe looks at Striker, an urgent look in his eyes.\n\nStriker shruggs. &quot;Allright, Prowl, come with me, Sniper, return to the war \nroom and stay there.&quot; He says and sets off toward the exit, Prowl following \nhim.\n\n"}}
