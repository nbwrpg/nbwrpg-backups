We are the storm and together we can do this .=\r\n  Tucson is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; probably out there already, fighting the battle of his=\r\n life in the name of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; freedom.  We can&#39;t let him do it alone.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere was a soft and good natured chuckle from LO=\r\nRD ELDER, &quot;Don&#39;t jump&lt;br&gt;\nfoward too fast. If you think back to your studie=\r\ns Magmatron had an&lt;br&gt;\ninterest in the Angolmois energy, which is derived f=\r\nrom Unicron, but&lt;br&gt;\nbeing a servant of Unicron himself?&quot; ELDER shook his h=\r\nead, &quot;No I can&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\nsee that.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;That would be a most astute suppo=\r\nsition.&quot; LEGACY said as he entered&lt;br&gt;\nthe chamber, his single optic seemin=\r\ng to scan the room as much as look&lt;br&gt;\naround.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnyone looking at L=\r\nEGACY might notice that he, like many of the&lt;br&gt;\nMaximals of late, had unde=\r\nrgone some changes of his own. While he had&lt;br&gt;\nnot grown any taller, he di=\r\nd seem more massive, the spread of his&lt;br&gt;\nshoulders being wider and broade=\r\nr. He looked somehting like SHOCKWAVE,&lt;br&gt;\nbut from his back there reached =\r\ncoiled tentacles which he could use to&lt;br&gt;\nmanipulate objects as well as hi=\r\ns hands. His right hand still ended in&lt;br&gt;\na massive cannon mount, one that=\r\n was, at the moment, powered down as&lt;br&gt;\nhe was among friends.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOOC=\r\n: New Legacy:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/al=\r\nbum/54620451/pic/2146411075/view&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nnbwrpg/photos/album/54620451/pic/2146411075/view&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/nbwrpg/photos/album/54620451/pic/2146411075/view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEGA=\r\nCY turned to examine each person in the room before returning his&lt;br&gt;\npower=\r\nful gaze to STRAIGHTSHOT and LORD ELDER, &quot;The energies that I&lt;br&gt;\nhave exam=\r\nined from the reports is not pure Unicronian energy but&lt;br&gt;\nenergy derived =\r\nfrom a similar source.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNOTE: When I give historical &#39;facts&#39; they a=\r\nre as historical as our&lt;br&gt;\ncharacters are aware of them.
