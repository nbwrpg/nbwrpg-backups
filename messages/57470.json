If\nsomeone would be kind enough to take Kaiser, maybe Stac...\n\nBic:\n\nAs Wolfenstein transformed, Tyrael was already taking flight.\nHopefully, he would tackle him out of the way.\n\nThe Dragoon, though, had no similar problems. He was a newcomer and\nthe predacons had not bothered with him yet. He analyzed the situation\nand his priorities.\n\nThe Dragoon: Darkangel, we have analyzed and found out that the woman\nbot that looks like a transmetal transformer might pose a threat to\nour attack. She is regrouping them. Kill her now. Our directives are\nwith Hydras, so we leave this to you.\n\n(What kind of weapon does Dragoon have?)\n\nDreadplague was hit by her assailants, but she was more infuriated\nthan wounded. Coming down, she reverted to her battle mode, a large\nand dark  figure in a black cloak, faceless, with a deadly long sword.\nHer voice became gravelly and raucous.\n\nDreadplague: Come now, Perceptor! Meet your doom!\n\nShe charged, ready to slash anything that would get between her and\nher victim. \n\n\n"}}
