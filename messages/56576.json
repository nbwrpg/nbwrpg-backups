In time.\n\nBut for today, everything was over as far as work was concerned. And the \nlittle dune buggy transformed into robot mode before he plopped down in the \ngrass and fell backwards. Until he looked up into the sky.\nHis ligaments had never been so sore in all of his entire LIFE! He was a \nresearcher, not a labor bot!\nOh well...it hadn&#39;t been like he&#39;d done all of the work himself. So everyone \nwas probably just as bushed as he was.\nBut the more and more Sand Storm thought about work, the more tired he got. \nSo he decided just to look at the pretty clouds as they floated by. Trying \nto make shapes out of them in his mind.\nWhich was kind of...fun.\n\nDiesel Runner and Blue Flame, meanwhile, were trying to come up with the \nbest action to which to do next. As Dark Cloud looked over what had been \nsalvaged earlier from their ship. When it had been whole, that was.\n&quot;Well, we both know that we can&#39;t stay out in the open for too long. So \nshouldn&#39;t we head for the nearest brush?&quot; Blue Flame suggested as he \nsurveyed their surroundings.\nAlthough D.R. just gave him a strange look. &quot; Show me a patch of brush on \nthis plain that&#39;s large enough to shelter two semi-trucks. One of which with \na cargo tailor large enough to hold the first, mind you.&quot;\nBlue Flame grinned. &quot; You know, that&#39;s not a bad idea. Dark Cloud, Sand \nStorm and myself can take turns getting out of this heat in your air \nconditioned trailer...&quot; he trailed off sarcastically.\nAnd got a good punch in the shoulder-plate for it too as the fembot beside \nhim glared dangerously. &quot; Yeah! While I drive around trying to find shelter \nfor ALL of us, you lazy clout!&quot;\n\nSuddenly Blue Flame&#39;s comm-system flared to life and both he and his \nCommander jumped. A voice blaring over the soft sounds of the plain.\n&quot;What the Pit?!&quot; D.R. snarled, not liking to be surprised as the other semi \nlooked just as shocked.\nSand Storm sat up a bit away from everyone and eyes his sub-commander. &quot; I \nthought our comms were down.&quot;\n&quot; Me too.&quot; Blue Flame answered, but a look at D.R. made up his mind for him \non whether or not to answer and he opened up the link to reply.\n&quot; Copy. This is Blue Flame of the Decepticon research vessel Nosvono \n[&lt;Noss-vo-no&gt;]. We&#39;ve just crash landed and are in need of assistance. \nOver.&quot;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.

But was the only one that did not burn up \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;into crispy atoms as it descended in the form of a great revolving fireball \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;down towards the flat grasslands of ancient Africa. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;The local wildlife having the intelligence enough to run for their pitiful \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;little lives as the alien metallic behemoth rocketed towards them. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Those aboard hanging on for their OWN pitiful little lives. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;� AH! WE�RE ALL GUNNA DIE!!� Dust Storm screeched as he hung onto whatever \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;he could, Dark Cloud included as he floated virtually in zero gravity and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;felt the temperature rising. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;He clung for dear life to the jet plane�s leg and began to sob. � I DON�T \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;WANNA DIE!!� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Suddenly the little dune buggy opened his optics and found that he was \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;floating right beside a porthole and could see the yellow grasslands rushing \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;up to meet them, and he suddenly became calm and even smiled. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;�Hey�what�s that?� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;To him it looked kind of pretty�but then he realized what it was and all \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;senses of calm completely escaped him. � WE�RE GUNNA HIT IT!� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;But by then it was too late and ship struck ground HARD. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Skidding along the open fields like a flat stone over a tranquil pond, \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;opening up the earth like a sharp scalpel before it finally lost momentum \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;and came to a slow stop. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Only to spew fuel from its 2 massive, broken tanks down the backside of the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;charred hull, fiery red hot enough to catch on fire. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Although, by then the 4 Decepticons inside had gathered enough wits about \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;them to vacate the area immediately and escape from their possible demise. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Running for their lives out into the bright sunlight of prehistoric Africa \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;just as the very vessel they�d piloted only minuets ago exploded into \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;nothing but wasted pieces of slag. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;They all watched from a distance as it burned. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;�I�m glad we weren�t in there when THAT happened.� Blue Flame commented as \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;he stood alongside his Commanding officer at the other 2. Who all seemed to \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;be quiet for a moment and contemplate the true words of the blue semi-truck. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Because it WAS true. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;They�d lost their ship, but they would have lost their lives if they�d acted \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;a moment too late. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;But still, Blue Flame had to sigh in disappointment. � But now what are we \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;going to do? We lost our research and I don�t even know where we are.� He \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;finished, looking around at the foreign planet they�d managed to crash on. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Everyone else did the same. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Mountains loomed up to the East and yellow African plain stretched out in \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;every other direction as far as the optic could see. Marred by the odd \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;skeletal tree, but that was about it. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Diesel Runner planted her hands onto her metallic hips and studied their \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;surroundings closely as the crackling fire of their ship burnt behind them. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;� That tare could have taken us anywhere. Because, if you all remember, our \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;research recorded that it was a flux in space AND time. So we could be on \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;any planet, in any time period. And this place is beginning to look more and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;more familiar the longer I look at it.� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;�How so?� Blue Flame asked, the other 2 of their team also looking to the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;broad back of their Commander. Although she continued to look out towards \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;the horizon. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;� I mean, I�ve seen pictures of this place before back at the Research \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Academy. Or at least a place that looked like this.� She said while \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;gesturing with her hand towards the landscape. � This place reminds me of \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;the pictures of ancient Earth millions of years before our Ancestors awoke \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;and started the Great War. See what I mean? There�s active volcanoes over \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;there.� D.R. pointed to a plume of steady smoke rising up from a great \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;distance away. � Although 9 chances out of 10, I�m wrong since our exit \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;factor of that tare was random. This planet is still generally young, and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;those volcanoes prove it.� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Sand Storm walked up to stand beside the towering black and Decepticon and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;clapped his hands together. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;� I can�t WAIT to study this place!� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;D.R., although this was no time for light-sparks, couldn�t help but feel the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;same way. But still� �Maybe later, Sand Storm. But right now, we have to \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;salvage what equipment we can from the ship. I think all the fuel�s burned \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;up now and it�s reasonably safe.� She said as she turned back and observed \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;the dying embers of what was left. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;� Though, it�s going to take a while�.� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;_________________________________________________________________ \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;MSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE* \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
