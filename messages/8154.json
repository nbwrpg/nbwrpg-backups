What waited for them was a\n&gt; great orb that was flashing pictures, They put there hands to it and saw\nwhat\n&gt; Herald had seen so long ago:::\n&gt;\n&gt;     a battle, Every spark on Earth was there, Mech fluid and bodies folded\n&gt; the valley. The many Factions fought senselessly. Defection was in the mid\n&gt; trying desperately to stop it all, DataStreaks body lay fallen and\ncrumpled\n&gt; in the rising pool of mech. They looked to the sky and saw Countless\nangles\n&gt; Battling there was Heraldangle singing a song of peace that was nearly\n&gt; drowned out by the bloodlust cries of the innocent falling and the\nuntruthful\n&gt; prevailing then an explosion, defection had sacrificed himself for Hot\n&gt; Rod.They saw Gigatron Fighting to get to defection and then seeing his\ncorps.\n&gt; herald had just put himself in front of one of ArcAngles FireBalls saving\n&gt; Prowls life.ArcAngle, In all of his glory had lost someone close to him.\nthen\n&gt; all were dead, the Iliad of the bots had ended in complete and utter\ndeath.\n&gt; Data Defection  and Herald Suddenly froze for 2 days.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/7078/13/_/_/_/964401215/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
