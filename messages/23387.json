His whole body is \nmetallic.\n\n\n\n::Prowl::\n\nProwl &#39;watches&#39; Snow Tech extend his shield. He sighs. The past day&#39;s \nevents were beginning to catch up to him: Iron Raptor&#39;s \ntransformation, the spark merging, the deal with the Matrix, the \nbattle with Shadow, testing out his new abilities, and now this \nencounter. He needed a recharge.\n\nHe lifts the furball off his head and hands it to Shadow Cat. Prowl \nwalks over to Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;Lower the shield, I&#39;m not going to shoot you,&quot; Prowl says. He looks \nat Iron Raptor.\n\n-Let&#39;s get back to the Cybertronian Fire, love,- he says, sliding an \narm around her. He hoped she&#39;d let him fly her back to base. He \nneeded to show Snow Tech that Iron Raptor was his own, Prowl&#39;s, not \nanyone else&#39;s.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Shadow Cat looks atthe new bot that stood before her. She wasn&#39;t \nshure if \n&gt; she could trust him, but she had to start somewhere. She lowers her \nsheild \n&gt; and returns her gun to it&#39;s magnetic holding system. She extends \nher hand in \n&gt; greeting,*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I am SHadow Cat, twin of Snow Tech and battle warrior.I greet \nyou.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She heard a commotion behind her and twists herhead to see, \nthough keeping \n&gt; the new bot in her vision. SNow Tech seemed to be in trouble. She \nsighs and \n&gt; turns back to Aerotuar and speaks in a less formal voice.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; My brother seems to be in trouble, could you please exscuse me \nfor a \n&gt; moment?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And without giving much thought, she turns toward the problem. \nThe little \n&gt; pif-ball had begun to attack Prowl and was not doing a good job. It \nseemed \n&gt; Prowls new body was imune to the little ones first stage of \ndevelopment. The \n&gt; little &#39;un senced he wasn&#39;t getting anywhere and climbed back to \nhis perch \n&gt; on Prowls head. He began to groom his fur, making it so it did not \nstand on \n&gt; end. He then began playing with Prowls wing feathers, which seemed \nto make \n&gt; the little annoyance forget he was mad at the person he \nwas &quot;playing&quot; with. \n&gt; Shadow Cat sighed in relif. If he got too mad.... She let the \nthought go. \n&gt; She new that the little guy could sence emotions like she and Snow \nTech \n&gt; could, but could not totally understand them, so could not totally \nseperate \n&gt; one thought from another. Luckily, She and Snow Tech had been able \nto help. \n&gt; Lending their combined telepathic strengths to protect the little \nguy. After \n&gt; all, he was one of them, he should be protected. She suppressed a \nshudder of \n&gt; fear on remembering the labs. She controled them though. She COULD \nNOT \n&gt; getthe little one scared or mad. The results could be \ndevestating....*\n&gt; \n&gt; * Snow Tech clicked on his sheild, it completely covered him and \nIR. He knew \n&gt; it could stand almost anything, so he wasn&#39;t worried about getting \nhurt. He \n&gt; called out,*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Uh, he&#39;s not mine, tell Shadow Cat to come get him!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Shadow Cat growled and walked over to the larger bot, stepping \nright in \n&gt; front of the gun,*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Well? Hand the dink over. Or are you going to shoot me?&quot; Hurry up \ni don&#39;t \n&gt; have all day for your desicion.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * SHe held out her hands and waited...*\n\n\n"}}
