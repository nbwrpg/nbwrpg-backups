Zardus looks over at Reptilica and Bloodystrike, hiding in the \nbushes on the other side of the natural path on which Iron Raptor and \nTavatron were bound to pass.\n\nThe bushes on the side path were thick, too thick to move through quickly, \nbut Zardus and co. were hiding in the thinnest parts, still concealed, but \neasier to get out of. The groups pulls out their weapons, waiting for the \nmaximal commander and her friend.\n\n"}}
