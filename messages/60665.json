He knew they would detect him, but it didn&#39;t matter.  None of \nthem would stand a ghost of a chance against him.  He slowed and then \ntransformed into his robot mode.  He was now in visible range of the \nbase, and he chuckled his old, evil sounding laugh.  He powered up \nthe fusion cannon on his right arm and felt it would be an \nappropriate way of indicating his presence.\n&quot;Come out Predacons!  Your Emperor is here!&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Sol&#39;ludnium Prime- Orbiting Flagship of the Seventh Fleet\n&gt;  \n&gt; Through the corridors of of the gigantic battleship Supernova, a \nlarge white and black robot walked toward an office door.  The large \nmale hit the door bell and a voice on the other side responded.\n&gt; &quot;Enter Constable.&quot;\n&gt; The door slid opened and the officer stepped in.  The large office \ncontained many decorations and awards the Admiral had accumulated.  \nIn the center of the room was a large desk, and behind it the Admiral \nsat.  He was looking at some new business from the government that \npretained to the fleet.  He tossed the data pad on the pile already \non his desk and looked at the Security officer.\n&gt; &quot;I see your mission to Oricron Core was a success.&quot; Hyper Convoy \nsaid as he stood and walked to the large window behind him.  &quot;I could \nnot expect less from you, could I, Megatron Revived?&quot;\n&gt; The large Neo Decepticon stepped forward, the stylized purple \ninsignia on his chest fully visable.  \n&gt; &quot;Yes it was.  That prisoner was quite a hand full for the crew.  \nBut overall he was apprehended without bloodshed or incident.&quot;\n&gt; The Fleet Admiral smiled and turned to Megatron Revived.\n&gt; &quot;You have served our government and it&#39;s citizens very well for the \npast few years.  Our Chief Exectutor, Tyrannis Kaitan, has given you \nfree reign.  You are basically free to do as you choose.&quot;\n&gt; Hyper Convoy turned to Megatron Revived.  He extended his right \nhand, which Megatron Revived hearily shook.\n&gt; &quot;I hear from your old friend Shockwave, that you brothe and sister \nare still very much alive.&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, the Matrix tells me they live and fight even now, but \nsomeplace I cannot go,&quot; Megaton Revived said, his hand over his chest \npanels.  Inside his armor exterior, a ornate golden Matrix of \nLeadership resided.  Vector Sigma gave this Matrix to the Decepticon \nLiege Maximo.  But Maximo made the mistake of leaving it behind.  Now \nMegatron possesses it, and eventually even the greatLiege will submit \nto justice.\n&gt;  \n&gt; ~*~\n&gt;  \n&gt; Weeks later- Restricted Area MGA-0\n&gt;  \n&gt; Weeks of travelling and bartering and threatening, Megatron Revived \nwas mere meters from the jump point were the Maximals and Predacons \njumped to the past and started the Beast Wars.  Also, Rodimus Prime \npursued Hydras through this point, and now, he had to go through it.  \nIn his armored gunship mode, Megatron Revived launched a small \ntranswarp core into the Resticted area.  Undernegth of the ship was \nan engine pod with the barrel of the fusion cannon powered to life.  \nThe transwarp core reached the correct area of spatial instability \nand Megatron Revived fired his mightuy fusion cannon, detonating the \ncore and opened a rift in space time.  he engines touch off, and the \ngunship takes off for the rift.\n&gt;  \n&gt; ~*~\n&gt; Prehistoric Earth\n&gt; The rift emptied over the north pole of the little blue planet.  \nThe white and black gunship sits motionless, observing and getting \nhis bearings.  Unicron was a far distance off, but too close for \ncomfort.  Megatron began scanning for signs of settlement, and found \nthe closest to be the Predacon base.\n&gt; /Well, let us harass these so called decendants of the \nDecepticons.  I have wondered about them so, let&#39;s see if they live \nup to there reputation. /\n&gt; The ship changed attitude, and began to enter the atmosphere, \nheaded for the Predacon base, to cause Chaos and wreak havok.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
