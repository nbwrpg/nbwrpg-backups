Battles are very \nconfusing already and the fact that some people post more attacks than \nthey get adds to the heaviness of the rpg. That is the reason.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Yeh rAuq telling people not to post is stupid. \n&gt; This rpg needed a jump start and now we&#39;re back to\n&gt; full strenght and he&#39;s telling us NOT to post, is it\n&gt; our fault he&#39;s to busy to keep the events page\n&gt; properly updated, but yet has failed to convey the\n&gt; knowledge to Winged Warrior?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  OOC: All right people lets try and stop arguing\n&gt; &gt; amongst ourselves. When I \n&gt; &gt; played this rpg there was never a council\n&gt; &gt; member(well it was yan then) who \n&gt; &gt; said dont post while im gone. So I apologize for\n&gt; &gt; continuing,  posting back in \n&gt; &gt; the day we just kept going and the person had to\n&gt; &gt; catch up. I think the \n&gt; &gt; council needs a little meeting to deal with all\n&gt; &gt; these problems. I really \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t give my characters a proper introduction\n&gt; &gt; either and for that im sorry \n&gt; &gt; I just felt it was a good way to further a story\n&gt; &gt; line. Such as Proto joining \n&gt; &gt; Megatron&#39;s ranks and The Rodimus Prime vs. Galvatron\n&gt; &gt; feud which I am really \n&gt; &gt; looking forward to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Sign up for SBC Yahoo!
