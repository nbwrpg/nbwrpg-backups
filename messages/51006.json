The plan sounds\n&gt; feasible, and since \n&gt; he wouldn&#39;t have to do anything but watch Flicker\n&gt; work, it suited \n&gt; him fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmmm, I will allow you to do this... In fact, this\n&gt; will work well \n&gt; with my plans to attack the Tripredacus base. Those\n&gt; insolent fools \n&gt; will pay for their stupidity.&quot; Megatron smiles\n&gt; cruelly, &quot;We shall \n&gt; attack as soon as you get to the Maximal Base. I,\n&gt; however, will not \n&gt; be carrying one of those communicators, Switchblade\n&gt; will.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron motions for Switchblade to approach and\n&gt; take one. He wasn&#39;t \n&gt; taking any chances, if there was a bomb or something\n&gt; like that in \n&gt; the communication device, he didn&#39;t want to be\n&gt; wearing \n&gt; it. &quot;Switchblade.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes Megs, you want me to wear the device as a\n&gt; precaution right?&quot; \n&gt; Switchblade nods in acceptance, &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll do it\n&gt; then.&quot; He walks \n&gt; over to Flicker, and takes one of the communication\n&gt; devices from \n&gt; him, then waits for instructions on how to install\n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron nods approval, then turns to the rest of\n&gt; the Predacons \n&gt; pressent, &quot;Now, the Tripredacus shall PAY. All\n&gt; Predacon troops move \n&gt; out to the Tripred base, but approach silently, so\n&gt; as to not trigger \n&gt; the sensory array.&quot; Megatron moves his hands over a\n&gt; console on his \n&gt; chair.\n&gt; \n&gt; An image of the world map that they&#39;d compiled from\n&gt; exploration, and \n&gt; from educated guessing, and Megatron put a little\n&gt; marker on it which \n&gt; signified about where the Tripred base would be\n&gt; located.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Predacons.
