One \nmissle caught her and she went flying in the air and landed.  &quot;OHH, Man that \nhurt.&quot; She looked at the damage.  It wan&#39;t too bad.  She had plenty of \nschorched hide and a few wires showing, but not too bad.  She returned fire \non Bumblebee.\n\n::DarkMouse:: The shots came within inches of her as she landed. She was \npropped up against a tree just sitting at it&#39;s base breathing very heavily.  \nShe couldn&#39;t move if she tried.  She was so worn out and too injured to do \nmuch more.  All she could do was hope the Matrix would show her mercy.\n\n----------Original Message----------\n&gt;From: KSLawdogg@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Sun, 18 Jun 2000 13:47:25 EDT\n&gt;Anubis/Hades/Nemesis Enforcer/The Oblitercons/Unitron/Serpentor/Koga\n&gt;Shuko/Shockwave/Bumblebee:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hades leapt slamming Anubis out of the way of Iron Raptor.  They both ran\n&gt;like Hell for the other Dieties who had gathered.  Upon reaching them:\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;We&#39;re ready!  LET&#39;S KICK MAXI TAILGATE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Nemesis saw Dinobot&#39;s optics charge, firing his own shot of optic lasers to\n&gt;intercept the blast.  Jumping up quickly, he transformed to his beast mode,\n&gt;activating the boosters in his feet, he blasted off into the air.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Shockwave saw the massive form of Iron Raptor.  &quot;Illogical beast modes.&quot;\n&gt;Bringing up his targeting scanners from 120 ft in the air, he got a lock.\n&gt;Firing four missiles and a burst of twenty rapid lasers down at Iron \n&gt;Raptor&#39;s\n&gt;midsection.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Scavenger saw Dinobot begin to turn towards him with a weapon.  &quot;Slag!&quot; he\n&gt;yelled, going into a quick reverse, explosions in front of him sent him \n&gt;into\n&gt;a flip, landing on his tires with a crunch.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Serpentor and Koga Shuko heard Cyber Claw screamed.  The kick sent Shuko\n&gt;slamming into the tree.\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;\n&gt;Serpentor laughed.  &quot;Stupid.&quot; was the one word he said before throwing his\n&gt;energon sword blade first at Cyber Claw&#39;s chest, rolling to the left and\n&gt;standing, his plasma rifle raised.  &quot;Megatron?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Koga laughed.  &quot;Oh, yeah, he&#39;ll answer your questions.  Evidently you \n&gt;didn&#39;t\n&gt;know him.  He&#39;s been dead for months, and only now reincarnated by my\n&gt;brilliant technology.  And the same will happen to you, without the \n&gt;cloning!&quot;\n&gt;he yelled, taking out his sword and getting in a fighting stance.\n&gt;\n&gt;======\n&gt;\n&gt;Bumblebee swerved to the left, catching a few shots in his side.  Raising\n&gt;both launchers, he fired a total of four stinger missiles off at Ursa \n&gt;Major,\n&gt;an optic blast off at Dark Mouse as he saw her bite Transantulas.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
