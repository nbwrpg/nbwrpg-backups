It calls to her briefly, then she shuts that out as well \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; takes out a tiny holo-projector.

I \nknow \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; been centuries since you died, but I still feel like I&#39;d be \n&gt; &gt; betraying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you to admit to Windlord that I ...

There was a severe lack of fruit.  This might&#39;ve \n&gt; been \n&gt; &gt; &gt; because he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never found the mess hall but that thought hadn&#39;t occurred to \n&gt; him \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yet.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Neither had the fact that he had been walking in circles \n&gt; through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the crew \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quarters area for quite some time.  Well, on his umpteenth \ntrip \n&gt; &gt; &gt; down one of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the halls he happened upon the brooding Empath heading into \nher \n&gt; &gt; &gt; room.  She \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hadn&#39;t seen him of course although she should have sensed \nhim.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps she \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was just too distracted he thought to himself.  Regardless he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; turned around \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and walked the other way searching for more fruit and maybe \nhis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; friend too, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but only if he wanted fruit.\n\n\n"}}
