She yawned and walked out of her room \nand down the hallway.  She happen to pass by the armory and saw Beachcomber \nin there getting weapons.  She stood in the door way loking at Beachcomber. \nShe drew her little dagger and kept it at her side.\n&quot;May I ask what you are doing here? And why are you taking our weapons?&quot;\nShe gave him a stern look.  She had never met him before and was extremely \nwary of him. He looked like he could kill her if he wanted to, but if he was \nan intruder, she would make sure she took him with her into the afterlife.\n\n------------Original Message-------------\n   &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt;\nDate: Fri Jun 23, 2000 1:43pm\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars RPG\n\n\nBeachcomber:\n\n\n\n\nBeachcomber entered the armory of the Ark, taking out a heavy laser rifle.  \nSetting the rifle down after getting some power cells for it, he took out a \nchain gun.  Taking out two bandoliers of shells and wrapping them around one \nshoulder and across the chest in one direction, the other in an opposite \ndirection.  Putting the chain gun in subspace, he picked up the heavy laser \nrifle, taking two grenades and putting them in subspace, stepping to the \nside, he waited for the others on guard duty to get weapons.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
