He could not see \nanyway out and there were traps set all around.  The ones that hit him did \nlittle damage due to his size and brute strength.  However he came to the \nconclusion that whomever had set these traps knew he was coming and would \nprobably be out to destroy him.  He was looking forward to it.\n\n"}}
