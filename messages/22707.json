Thats not the Predacon way...\n&gt;        Locking his shoulder into place, Megatron releases four \npowerful shots \n&gt; from his tail cannon. He was sorry to see it end like this, but if \nhe missed \n&gt; Rampage, Tankkor, and Hell Beast, who also took aim, would \ncertianly pick him \n&gt; off. \n&gt;        &quot;Get that body to the boiler room....we can use it to power \nthe ship.&quot; \n&gt; Tarantulas said, just before MEgatron took that fateful shot at \nKillfest.\n\n\n"}}
