Soon, he was flying above the \nforest in which he felt it vibrating with life.\n\nAzureBlade: Dragon mode!\n\nHis jet wings unhooked from the main body, becoming slightly more \ndragon-like, his dragon head extended from the jet, still attached by \na series of complex rings. Claws deployed and dug in the ground as he \nlanded, and his tail extended, brushing the moist forest terrain. He \nheard some wolves howl.\n\nAzureBlade: Noble beasts... True warriors, never losing their faith. \nKilling only those who need to be killed... The Maximals should take \nexample on you.\n\nAfter some moments walking in the forest, he saw a cave. He had \ndamaged some trees accidentally, so he knew he would be waited for.\n\nAzureBlade: Greetings, my friend. I am AzureBlade, and I truly come in \npeace.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., HanaKirei85@a... wrote:\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt; AzureBlade: Wait for me!

Hopefully she was big enough...her stature was small and \nlight when \n&gt; it came down to it. Taking in a deep breath, she charged foward to \npush with \n&gt; all her weight...\n&gt; \n&gt; ...and was nursing a throbbing shoulder a moment later, after \ntumbling \n&gt; backwards a few feet. Muttering some words under her breath that are \nbetter \n&gt; off not repeated, she moved foward again, pushing in place with her \nshoulder. \n&gt; \n&gt; Seeing soon this wasn&#39;t getting her anywhere, since the pod hadn&#39;t \nbudged in \n&gt; the least, Mistra sighed and sat down beside it, glaring in its \ngeneral \n&gt; direction. Great. Just great. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If I just knew my activation code...then I could transform and move \nthis \n&gt; damn thing no problem. I think anyway..&quot; Not that she could remember \njust \n&gt; what her actual form looked like. For all she knew, she maybe just \nas small...\n&gt; \n&gt; Snarling slightly in annoyance, she kicked a small stone towards the \npod, \n&gt; then looked out towards the sky. Maybe she should just forget the \nstatus pod \n&gt; and move on...why would anyone want to steal it anyway? There may \nnot even be \n&gt; another soul on this planet...even if there was, what use would her \npod be to \n&gt; them? But..then again...\n\n\n"}}
