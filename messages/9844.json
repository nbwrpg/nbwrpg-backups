I think is the first club I&#39;ve ever been\n&gt; &gt; too\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where a new post is put in every 30 seconds, which is great for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; member imput. We are the friendliest, cheeriest bunch around.\n&gt; We&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not greedy or anything about winning, it&#39;s just Transformer Fun.\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just wanna say thanks for making me a part of this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, our club is turning a whole year old. Also, we&#39;re coming\n&gt; up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the 10,000th message since using egroupes. And since that was\n&gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a few months ago, it&#39;s a great feet. So what I was thinking was\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we should do somethimg to get together. You know, have everyone\n&gt; &gt; meet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at the chatroom and talk about transformer stuff. It&#39;d be great!\n&gt; &gt; Tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me what you think about it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
