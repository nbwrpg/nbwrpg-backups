He wanted to go badly. He needed to get\nout\n&gt; &gt; again. Sitting outside the cave wasn&#39;t enough. His eyes turned into a\n&gt; &gt; appearance of wanting. But he knew he was still stuck here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ya could go,&quot; he managed to say. &quot;Ah still gotta talk t&#39; Stingtra.&quot;\nThat\n&gt; &gt; bot was worrying him. He had never seen a bot that acted like that\nbefore.\n&gt; A\n&gt; &gt; bot that hurt herself and nearly aways came back damaged.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He looked up and saw Sinester and Sinesis with two other bots.

Here he was, a well\n&gt; &gt; &gt;seasoned warrior who was stuck at home base with nothing to do.  She\n&gt; &gt; &gt;felt sorry for him.  He wanted to see some action.  And quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt;frankly, so did she.  She was bored as well.  She wanted to fight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Her spark lived for fighting.  She loved bringing down an enemy and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;chewing on his remains.  But she was stuck at home base to with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;nothing to do.  She moved over and sat next to Quickstrike.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Ok Boss-bot. Now what? Megatron and that mouse aren&#39;t back yet.  Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt;you want to go on patrol of do some recon? If we are lucky, we will\n&gt; &gt; &gt;find some bot lurking around to scrap.&quot; She had a slight smile on her\n&gt; &gt; &gt;face.  She was trying to comeup with anything to cure the boredom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5533/13/_/_/_/962987029/\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Remember four years of good friends, bad clothes, explosive chemistry\n&gt; experiments.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5532/13/_/_/_/963010717/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
