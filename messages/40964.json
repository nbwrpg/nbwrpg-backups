The truth of the matt=\r\ner is that the poll you created\n  is a relative question. RPGing is the sam=\r\ne thing as anything else, &quot;to\n  each his own&quot;. Some people will like my lon=\r\ng discriptive posts, while\n  others will find it boring and a waste of time=\r\n. Others will like posts\n  that are short and sweet, to the point, while th=\r\ne rest will feel they\n  have no substance. It really dosent matter. Also, t=\r\nhis rpg is only as\n  good as it&#39;s worse player, so we are all affected by a=\r\n bad post,\n  therefor should all be striving to get better.
