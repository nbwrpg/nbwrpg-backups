It&#39;s getting out that&#39;s \nthe \n&gt; problem. We could wander this mountain for years. But incase we \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; get out, there&#39;s something I need to do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois stopped and opened up his comm.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Battera.....It&#39;s Vulois. I&#39;ve tried moving the embassy to this \n&gt; mountain, but I think we&#39;ve taken a wrong turn and are lost. We may \n&gt; never get out. If we make it, we&#39;ll call again, but for now there&#39;s \n&gt; something I need to tell you. You&#39;ve always been the one for peace, \n&gt; even when I was scheming. In away this os your mission. Whoever \nheard \n&gt; of Preds wanting peace, eh?(chuckles hopelessly). So, since you \nhave \n&gt; been with me so long, if I don&#39;t make it, I want you to lead the \n&gt; group. To host the conference back at the embassy. Don&#39;t do \nanything \n&gt; now, we might still make it. But if you don&#39;t here from us again in \n&gt; two days, assume command. We&#39;re going to far out of range now, so \nyou \n&gt; won&#39;t be able to contact us. Good-bye Battera. You&#39;ve been a good \n&gt; friend.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois continues down the tunnel.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream/Gotron\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream and Gotron continue to fight inside the cave, when the \n&gt; message from KitKat comes through.

Quickly, we must get out before it explodes!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream and Gotron heads to the door, but from all their fire \n&gt; power, the part infront of the door collapses, leaving them trapped \n&gt; in. Starscream contacts Phobia&#39;s ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hello? Anyone? This is the Predacon Starscream(at this point \nGotron \n&gt; stares in wonder and mutters &quot;Starscream?&quot; and another Alliance \nbot. \n&gt; What&#39;s your name?(&quot;Gotron.&quot;)Gotron&#39;s his name. Please, we are \ntrapped \n&gt; inside the Pred cave. We need assistane now. The door is caved-in. \n&gt; Please, just shoot it open with the ships lasers or something.
