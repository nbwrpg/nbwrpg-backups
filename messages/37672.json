Yep, Michael Jackson, with a new album I believe is \n&gt; called &quot;Invincible&quot; that&#39;s supposed to be better than his &quot;Thriller&quot; album, \n&gt; which was pretty damn good and when he was black and didn&#39;t look like a chick)\n&gt; \n&gt; President Kaiser/Sequencer/Sinew/Captain Nemo:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The massive IGL flagship, the Otyebis, was now in Earth&#39;s atmosphere and \n&gt; rapidly descending downwards would would soon be known as Seattle, \n&gt; Washington, USA.  A major city built up quite a bit during a goldrush in \n&gt; Alaska, USA.  Travellers would stack up on supplies in the city and then try \n&gt; their luck in their greedy search of gold in Alaska.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still a dozen miles up in the air, it would take exactly fifteen cycles to \n&gt; reach the surface at the Otyebis&#39; current velocity.  It would be quite \n&gt; visible given its size (a ship that&#39;s the size of three Iron Fist&#39;s combined \n&gt; and a little more), and with a Cybertronian&#39;s ability to magnify his/her \n&gt; optic view it would be even more visible.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; President Kaiser of the Intergalactic Gladiatorial League was on the bridge \n&gt; of the mighty craft.  He looked around at the bridge crew, all mostly \n&gt; different species&#39; of organic creatures.  &quot;Captain Nemo, estimated time of \n&gt; arrival?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Approximately fifteen minutes, President.&quot; the feathered bird creature \n&gt; replied.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Very good.  And our trajectory is clear?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No, sir, there are numerous hundred foot trees blocking our landing zone.&quot; \n&gt; Sinew replied, out of his body armor but still fierce looking.  He walked \n&gt; over to the President and stood next to him. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Clear them, Sinew.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A few cannons extended from different places on the ship, several large \n&gt; fireballs shooting down at the surface, erupting in one huge flame, burning a \n&gt; large circle in the trees.  The area of the near perfect circle that had \n&gt; resulted in the weaponsfire was a few hundred feet larger than the actual \n&gt; Otyebis to give it some room when it landed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Back inside the bridge, Kaiser activated his comm. unit.  &quot;Vice-President \n&gt; Suka, assemble forty armed soldiers of your choice and have them split up and \n&gt; secure all main entryways of the ship and put the Otyebis on yellow alert.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
