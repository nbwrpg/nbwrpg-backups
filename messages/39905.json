Then super blasts, the destruction of the Axalon, \n&gt;   Trypticon! Metroplex! The Dinobots! Stasis lock Darts!!!! Yes \nthose \n&gt;   were the days tons of moding but it was all good and fun because \nmany \n&gt;   were expeirimenting and had no Idea what they were doing... \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; OOC: I agree. I never had the rules explained to me when I \nfirst \n&gt;   joined a year ago. I was new to the Internet and didn&#39;t know how \nto \n&gt;   act, and besides that I started off as just a bad RPGer. Kyle \n&gt;   Stewart, you start off as a good one, but with the same flaw as I \n&gt;   originally had. Not knowing the rules. Of course, back then the \nrules \n&gt;   page sucked, and it is nowhere near the grand spectacle it is \ntoday. \n&gt;   It&#39;s not very descriptive and informative. But back to my point, \nI \n&gt;   moded alot without even noticing it, and did things very similar \nto \n&gt;   you, Kyle Stewart (if that&#39;s what you like to be called). I once \neven \n&gt;   busted into a base and played around inside in one post because I \nwas \n&gt;   bored, and didn&#39;t know what I did wrong until months later!...\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   &gt;   From: robertdahl \n&gt;   &gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   &gt;   Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 1:45 PM\n&gt;   &gt;   Subject: Re: Kyle Stewart\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   OOC: Cool of Legendarynemasis. He&#39;s new, and it takes a while \nto \n&gt;   get the\n&gt;   &gt;   rules, you above all should know that. Now you said that your \na \n&gt;   hot\n&gt;   &gt;   head, so you should know it&#39;s not smart to go off yelling at \n&gt;   people.\n&gt;   &gt;   Kyle, don&#39;t worry, everyone&#39;s moded once or twice, but we&#39;ve \njust\n&gt;   &gt;   learned from our mistake. Again, talk to the council. Also, \n&gt;   welcome to\n&gt;   &gt;   the RPG :)\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;    \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
