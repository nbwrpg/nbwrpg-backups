In case anyone doesnt know\n&gt; what im talking about heres a portion of the post in which they did:\n&gt;\n&gt; The Vile Cannon struck the shields shorting out the generator\n&gt; powering it. Three more anchors snapped and the base rocked into the\n&gt; air and crashed down causing a gust of sand to rise through the air.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
