Nemesis Enforcer let out a groan, slowly getting to \nhis feet.  He let out a yell as he noticed that one of the bat-like wings on \nhis back had been severed in the crash.  Nemesis looked to his right hand and \nlet out another yell as he saw that his middle finger was unnaturally bent \nback.\n\nThe Predacon gripped the finger with his good hand and with a short scream of \npain bent it back into place.  Pain shot throughout his right hand as he \nclosed it into a painful fist.  Nemesis Enforcer looked about the messy room \nhe was in, not exactly sure where he was.  His thoughts were interrupted by \nMegatron&#39;s comm.  \n\n&quot;On my way.&quot; he responded into his comm. unit, leaving his room and going for \nthe storage bay, but in fact he was unintentionally going the opposite \ndirection the storage bay was in.\n\n"}}
