At the base he lands and returns to his bot mode.  There he sees \nNightlight and Perplex fighting with two unknown bots and a third unknown bot \nhelping them, sort of.  He looks between them and decides that Perplex is \nfine.  He turns and leaps at Clash drawing his staff and slashing at his \nback.  \n\n"}}
