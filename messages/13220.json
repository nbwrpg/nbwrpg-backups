But \nwhen he prepared himself to fire. He saw Rowdy Wolf below.\n\n&quot;Oh slag!&quot; he said. &quot;He&#39;s still around!&quot; He backed off, fast. He flew \ntowards the cave.\n\n\n\nRowdy Wolf leaped away from Dinotron&#39;s optic lazers. He turned his \nbody to the Dinobot. &quot;It&#39;s a waste. You are just the same as your \nenemies, yet you are too foolish to know so. This has been witnessed \nby the Vok before.&quot; He closed his yellow optics a few moments, then \nopened them again. &quot;If you wish to die, let us aid you!&quot; He raised a \nhand to the sky and wavered it around. \n\nDark clouds rolled in, thunder murmuring inside. Water decended from \nthe darkened clouds, onto the earth and the battling robots. Rowdy \nWolf transformed to beast mode and bolted away.\n\n\n\nTerrorsaur turned and watched as the clouds rolled in unannoucned. \nWater dropped down from them, but when they fell down on him, it \nburned. He screeched and looked down where the water droplets hit his \nshoulders and arms. He held his head with one hand. He noticed the \nspots where the water was landing on him, it was melting off his \nmetalwork.\n\n&quot;Oh slag, it&#39;s acid!&quot; he shouted. He turned and flew quickly into the \nPredacon cave. &quot;Let me in! Let me in!&quot; He screamed.\n\n\n"}}
