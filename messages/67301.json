He dog-paddled as fast as he could \n&gt; toward the other side of the ocean and soon was far away from the \n&gt; base. \n&gt; \n&gt; He swam to the surface when was safely away from the base and put out\n&gt; a call to Hydras. &quot;Master Hydras, I have freed myself from the \n&gt; confines of the Maximal base. I will return to your location \n&gt; momentarily.&quot;\n\nFrom behind Trelos a dark shape moved through the water swiftly rising\nthrough the waters, picking up speed as it did so. When it reached the\nsurface a black shark fin rose from the water denoting its position, it\nbegan moving in Trelos&#39; direction. \n\nEven as the shark moved a message came through from Hydras ... \n\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good, come back to base and dont stop until you two are here&quot; said \n&gt; Hydras while he had a open channel to Myrmidon\n\nMyrmidon transmitted back, (Trelos may be able to pick it up if he\nchooses) &quot;I believe I have located your wayward Trelos. I am closing on\nhis position now.&quot; Myrmidon paused and then spoke over his radio, his\nvoice grave and thoughtful. &quot;If you plan on doing anything with that\nRodimus bot, you had better do it soon. Atlantis is under siege by a\nwave of warriors from the skies. Rodimus may be a moot point soon, as\nwell as the rest of the city.&quot;\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
