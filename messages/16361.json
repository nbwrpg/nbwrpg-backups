I&#39;ve just \n&gt; read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about 150 messages, but it&#39;s okay becuase most of them aren&#39;t \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me.(*sob* nobody loves me...). And Iron Raptor, I don&#39;t mean to \nbe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rude or anything, but who gives you the right to make the \n&gt; scamatics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for my weapon? Too late now, I&#39;ll go with it, but just e-mail \nme \n&gt; next\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time and I&#39;ll telly ou about what you want to know. I&#39;m also \ngonna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scratch the post where Gotron went to Dark One&#39;s help. I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really following the battle, so I&#39;m going to get him to do \nstuff \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Starscream.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vulois\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vulois looked the two Vok up and down. Powerful, but they \nshould \n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; able to beat them. He put his arm around Child and stared at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; villains.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;This is my mountain, and will soon be a scared place of the \n&gt; Oracle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Leave now or feel our power withing!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brix patted Ramulus on the back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know. You were pretty goo up there. You came in when we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; needed it. A few more trips and and you&#39;ll get the hang of it. \n&gt; And we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may need some more trips before this is done. Now what&#39;s this \ncomp\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to say?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Starscream/Gotron\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Starscream came out of his CR Chamber in the Alliance base. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thought about what he should do. He needing to know how his \ngroup \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing. He had been thinking about Phobia&#39;s action on the ship, \n&gt; and he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to save everyone and was willing t give his life, so he&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; valiant. That means he&#39;s probably not in with Megatron. He sent \na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; message.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. I&#39;m at the Alliance base. How is \n&gt; everyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing? Did KitKat and Cave-In get their CR Chambers? And are we \n&gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything against Megatron?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Starscream walked down the hall and entered the caf. He really \nhad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing to do until his group came to the Alliance, so he&#39;d go \n&gt; hang\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out. When he go their though, he saw a familiar face.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Gotron!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Starscream! What are you doing here?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;A little ambassador stuff. What about you?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m Alliance, remember?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Oh yeah.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Come. Have some energon with me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The two sat down and started getting drunk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Trainers\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prebon kissed Spears. He had never felt like this before. She \n&gt; almost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made him want to give up his real girl. Maybe he should put \nchips \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all the fembots. He could be the player of the NBW!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You mis-understand what were doing. We are only telling \nRamulus \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we will mett him in a few days. We are not taking Striker with \nus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When we get back, there will be plenty of time to say good-\nbye.&quot; \n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kissed Spears&#39; again as Ignatius flew down.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Now, if you hop on Ignatius we&#39;ll be ready to begin.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Bullet went to the guard position by Striker&#39;s cell. \nHe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thouht to himself that with him here and Blaze controlling the \n&gt; cell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guns that the only way this person could get out is if they \nwere \n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ultimate strategist. Than again, Bullet is pretty stupid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
