He looked admiringly at all the buttons\n&gt; and controls, and how well everything fit together. He turned each\n&gt; monitor on, and could see how easily he could switch from one cell to\n&gt; another, and even view several at once should he choose. He could\n&gt; control nearly every aspect of all the cells from here.\n&gt;\n&gt; He could see from his monitor that Hydras was just having Tuscon put\n&gt; in his cell so he turned up the sound . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You look back at what you did wrong and you correct it. It&#39;s all right to \n&gt;&gt; make mistakes Rodimus, Primus knows I&#39;ve made more than my fair share \n&gt;&gt; already.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes you have made some mistakes today.&quot; Rodimus said over a speaker\n&gt; near by Tuscon&#39;s ear, Rodimus chuckled at his own joke. &quot;However you\n&gt; will pay for it for a long long time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: Sandy, I sent you an email also)\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus was about to say something really clever when Darkhawk said\n&gt; something . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Darkhawk grined and said Rodimus with malice &quot;I bet that you Girlfriend \n&gt;&gt; will be alone\n&gt; a while...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus looked over at Darkhawk, all the humor that had just been in\n&gt; his face and voice vanishing, to be replaced by a darker more\n&gt; suspicious tone, &quot;What do you mean by that Darkhawk?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
