I mean, uh, do we have \nany orders or any job assigned or anything like that?&quot;\nShe felt her face plates flush.  She could have smacked herself for that \none. She knew how stupid that one sounded.  She wanted to go crawl into a \nhole and disappear.\n\n\n---original message---\nFrom:   &lt;Dachande85@a...&gt;\nDate: Tue Jul 4, 2000 8:16pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nOOC:( Megatron, Scorponok and DarkMouse are at the Destron Base. Megatron is\nwaiting for Panzertron so they can talk. DarkMouse said that she smelled a\ntrap while they were all waiting for Panzertron to appear.  Scorponok stayed\nwith Megatron while DarkMouse went looking around.  The only door she found\nopen was a CR chamber room.  She was headed back to the room where Megatron\nwas when she heard a noise behind a door.  She listened and heard nothing so\nshe porcceded back down the hallway to the room where Megatron and Scorponok\nwere.)\n\nWrong base. Magmatron&#39;s base is the Destron base.\n\n::CyberShark::\n\n    He looked around and saw that only the hallway was open. &quot;Magmatron,\ncould you let us in to the Cafeteria? We would like to sit down and have a\nmeal.&quot; He commed to Magmatron.\n    &quot;Just a second CyberShark,&quot; Magmatron replied. A few seconds later the\ndoor to the cafeteria opened. CyberShark walked in to the medium sized room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
