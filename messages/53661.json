If the names are no good tell me.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;BIC:\n&gt;�Prometheus�      �Epimetheus�\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      A space shuttle that holds two slowly creaks through space as it\n&gt;heads to the blue and green planet known to its future residents as\n&gt;Earth.  The shuttle looks something like a Bident but instead of two\n&gt;pokers it has two lightning bolts.  It is a metallic silver/white\n&gt;color.\n&gt;\n&gt;      But enough of the space shuttle, inside the unique spaceship\n&gt;were two individuals.  They were both silver metallic.  Over their\n&gt;metallic though was more metallic but this is where the two\n&gt;individuals looked different.  One was a shinny red metallic and the\n&gt;other was a shinny blue metallic.  So for now they shall be known as\n&gt;Red and Blue.  Red was studying a map of the world known as Earth.\n&gt;Blue was sitting in the pilot&#39;s chair but instead of carefully\n&gt;planning the course he had his legs up on the controls and was\n&gt;twiddinling his thumbs.\n&gt;\n&gt;      &quot;Hey Brother,&quot; Red said as he turned and faced his\n&gt;comrade, &quot;What the Grease Bolting are you doing!  Why aren&#39;t you\n&gt;planning our landing!  I don&#39;t want to crash.  Plan ahead.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;       &quot;Plan Ahead?  Yeah right!&quot;  Blue said as he let out a small\n&gt;chuckle, &quot;You are suppose to move with the flow.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;       &quot;We need a landing vector!&quot;  Red yells.\n&gt;\n&gt;       &quot;YOU NEED a tic-tack!&quot;  Blue yells back.\n&gt;\n&gt;       Poor Poor Blue, if only he listen to his brother.  But he\n&gt;decided to not listen to his brother and decided to go with the\n&gt;flow.  Well now they are flowing on the mountains of the Northern\n&gt;Continent where they crashed.  Their exact location of the crash is\n&gt;(using the map on the events page) as far east of the Predacon base\n&gt;as possible and about an inch up.  It looks like these two bots need\n&gt;a rescue operation. (Hint:  I just making the rescue operation to see\n&gt;which groups are active and that is how I am going to decide who to\n&gt;join to rescue me.)  (So Bots, move out.)\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCharla con tus amigos en l�nea mediante MSN Messenger:  \nhttp://messenger.microsoft.com/es\n\n\n"}}
