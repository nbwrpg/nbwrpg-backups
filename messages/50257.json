I hope your \n&gt; skills will be useful to us. Now for- (he receives\n&gt; the transmission \n&gt; from Spikes and opens a channel) No Spikes, don&#39;t\n&gt; attempt anything on \n&gt; them now. They are in Maximal territory so it is\n&gt; likely they could get \n&gt; help. There was a pod landing near our base. A third\n&gt; lifeform is \n&gt; located there too. Go investigate there for now.\n&gt; Base out.\n&gt; \n&gt; He throws some long feathers back, oddly forming a\n&gt; cape. Meanwhile, \n&gt; Shadow Star comes out of the CR Chamber. Silently\n&gt; moving, he stops \n&gt; next to his superior.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadow Star: I am back, Major.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Good. We can now start. As you all know, we\n&gt; have met little \n&gt; success in our first encounter with the Predacons.\n&gt; There were many \n&gt; units that entered combat and the loss of Burrock\n&gt; only made it worse. \n&gt; That made us go out of the cover of secrecy. Most\n&gt; factions know the \n&gt; location of our base and I don&#39;t think Megatron\n&gt; liked my bragging \n&gt; about getting him. From now on, we must expect no\n&gt; quarters, and give \n&gt; none. We&#39;re lucky because we&#39;re alone on our\n&gt; continent. This is \n&gt; easier to monitor unit movement. But now, we&#39;ll stop\n&gt; to use the \n&gt; defense position. We have to know where to strike.\n&gt; We need to scout \n&gt; and find our enemies, because they are not only the\n&gt; predacons and \n&gt; maximals. And perhaps we can ally with this new\n&gt; faction that arrived \n&gt; on planet some times ago, as the computer reported.\n&gt; Are there \n&gt; volunteers?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;deltazero1&quot; &lt;DeltaZero1@h...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Talon was working on the top on the base and\n&gt; crusher stood over him \n&gt; &gt; holding a large triple laser turret on his\n&gt; shoulder while talon \n&gt; &gt; started to connect wires &quot;ok set it down here&quot; he\n&gt; said stepping back \n&gt; &gt; a bit as crusher put it down with a large thud &quot;ok\n&gt; that finished up \n&gt; &gt; the weapon defence&quot; talon said as he walked\n&gt; towards the bridges sun \n&gt; &gt; roof and gave the command for it to up so he could\n&gt; jump down &quot;main \n&gt; &gt; defences up and rdy sir&quot; he landing a few feet\n&gt; away from the others \n&gt; &gt; and moved to the side abit before crusher jumped\n&gt; down and making a \n&gt; &gt; good deal of the room rumble as his landed &quot;and\n&gt; this is crusher my \n&gt; &gt; weapons officer&quot; he said looking over at crusher\n&gt; large body\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
