Well, when a website dies when the webmaster \n&gt; stops \n&gt; &gt; updating the website... right? What if we (RPGERs) do a temporary \n&gt; website \n&gt; &gt; for NBW... but instead exist one webmaster, we&#39;ll have more. \nThen, \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; one of webmasters can&#39;t work on the website (or worst: quit) for \na \n&gt; &gt; while, the others can keep the site running and updating it. If \none \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; webmasters quits,  the others webmasters chooses an other member \nand \n&gt; train \n&gt; &gt; him/her, and give that person the passwords and needed \ninformation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When the website has to be updated, the webmasters share the job, \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; it will go much faster, since several people are doing it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What do you think?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Airly\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Check out Yahoo!
