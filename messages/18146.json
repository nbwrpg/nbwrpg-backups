Havoc&#39;s wings stuck out of his back, the missile \nlaunchers and machine guns shifted to his shoulders. His left arm (Chaos) had \ntwo missile launches emerging from the forearm, his right arm (Minion) \nhosting a tank barrel on the wrist. Repressor&#39;s copter blades stuck out of \nthe ankle of his right foot, bent upward to hug the leg, but with potential \nto straighten out and cut anything in their path. Demolition&#39;s two \n50-calliber gatling guns were mounted on his left thigh.\n\nA dual missile launcher was held in his hand, made of Repressor&#39;s missile \nlaunchers, with a large barrel in between. THe energy it took to power all \nhis weapons drained WarMachine rather quickly, so he could not stay in \ngestalt mode too long.\n\nWarMachine laughs, looking down at Shockaract, firing two missiles and a \nplasma blast from his gun at him while he takes a step forward, his foot \ndecending on Grenade.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA shadow passes over Zardus, the Alliance commander glancing sideways to see \nwhat was going on. He smiles as he sees WarMachine attacking Shockaract. One \nmore gestalt for the Alliance....\n\nZardus looks back at Blender, seeing if his slash had hit or not.\n\n"}}
