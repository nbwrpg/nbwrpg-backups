Had you had such substantial forces at your beck and call this\n&gt; entire time, we could have no doubt greatly utilized them previously.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He hissed, &quot;Instead now the MAXIMALS outnumber and outgun us even more\n&gt; significantly and have a vastly strengthened strategic hand due to your\n&gt; dillying when we could have remedied such a thing had you supported us\n&gt; earlier.&quot;  DINOBOT was..
