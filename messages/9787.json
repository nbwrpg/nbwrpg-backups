I think is the first club I&#39;ve ever been \ntoo \n&gt; where a new post is put in every 30 seconds, which is great for \n&gt; member imput. We are the friendliest, cheeriest bunch around. We&#39;re \n&gt; not greedy or anything about winning, it&#39;s just Transformer Fun. I \n&gt; just wanna say thanks for making me a part of this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, our club is turning a whole year old. Also, we&#39;re coming up \n&gt; to the 10,000th message since using egroupes. And since that was \nonly \n&gt; a few months ago, it&#39;s a great feet. So what I was thinking was \nthat \n&gt; we should do somethimg to get together. You know, have everyone \nmeet \n&gt; at the chatroom and talk about transformer stuff. It&#39;d be great! \nTell \n&gt; me what you think about it.\n\n\n"}}
