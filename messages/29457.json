In the eight overtime, \n1-on-1, our captain (GREAT guy) made the other team&#39;s player and \ngoalie look foolish to score with about 10 seconds left on the clock.\nGOAL! THE CROWD GOES WILD!\n\nDamn referee... gave me 2 mins for submarining a guy with my \nknee (submarine in hockey = making the other player do a flip, and \ntaking out his legs.) and he was trying to hit me! (not the other way \naround)\n\nHeee heee heee... *passes out in his computer chair and \naccidentally sends this message*\n\n"}}
