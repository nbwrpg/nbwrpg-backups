She listened to her scanner.\n\n&quot;What?&quot; her comm-link asked from one of her bounty hunter group.\n\n&quot;My Berserk scanner,&quot; she replied, noticing that he heard her. &quot;It&#39;s \ngoin&#39; off again.&quot;\n\n&quot;You haven&#39;t deleted that program yet?&quot; her comm-link asked. \n\n&quot;No,&quot; she replied. &quot;It went off on the nothern side of th&#39; vector. \nSomethin&#39;s goin&#39; on. I&#39;m gonna find out!&quot; She turned her track, \nfollowing her scanner.\n\n&quot;Eerie, whoa!&quot; her comm called to her. &quot;Wait!&quot;\n\nShe shut it off and went on. Her feet clashed against the ground, \nrunning faster as she came closer. She turned to a more populated \narea where a lot of business was done. She came here on occassions.\n\nShe kept a close eye out, watching everything that she ran past, \nlooking for the familiar build of the clone Berserk. She went down to \na open area. That&#39;s when she saw him. She skidded to a stop, her \nmouth and eyes wide. She gasped in surprise to see that he was fully \nrepaired.\n\n&quot;You!&quot;\n\nBerserk jerked his head and snarled instantly at her. &quot;Eerie.&quot; \n\nShe frowned at him. &quot;You know me all right.&quot;\n\n&quot;Berserk, no!&quot; a female by him shouted and grabbed his arm. What was \nshe doing trying to stop that freak. If there was going to be a fight \nbetween them, there would be a fight. Just like last time. She was \ngoing to win. \n\n&quot;Get out of th&#39; way ya idiot!&quot; she shouted to him. She withdrew a gun \nfrom behind her armor and aimed him.\n\n&quot;No!&quot; the female shouted. She dropped a large rifle that was in her \narms and jumped in front of Berserk. &quot;Don&#39;t fire!&quot;\n\n&quot;Get th&#39; Pit outta th&#39; way!&quot; She fired at Berserk. The shot hit his \nshoulder, jerking his chest back. She snarled and bared his teeth. \n\n&quot;Berserk!&quot; Berserk charged past the female. She wouldn&#39;t have the \nchance to grab him. He&#39;d plow right through her. Eerie braced herself \nas Berserk charged at her, with his black clawed hands out. She \nducked to the side. She kicked up at him, but he grabbed her ankle \nand lifted her up in the air. She threw her. \n\nEerie sat up, looking at Berserk. Two bots jumped on him, the same \nfemale and a red colored male.\n\n&quot;Berserk, power down!&quot; the male commanded. Eerie got back up and ran \nat them. She leaped up and kicked Berserk on the jaw. Berserk stepped \nback. The bot bots fell off of him.  Berserk kicked Eerie to the \nground. She landed on her chest, taking a moment to reach back and \ngrab a dagger from behind her armor. She jumped up and slashed at him.\n\n\n"}}
