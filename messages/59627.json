She drank her cup and looked at \nhim. &quot;OK, so far, you have a gift and you don&#39;t want others to know \nabout it. But a question forms in my thought procesors, why tell me \nif you don&#39;t want anyone else to know? Unless you have an offer to \ngive me, plan on killing me later on, or perhaps, you have the need \nto tell me this because you need help with something related to this \nlittle gift of yours. Tell me how close I am on that.&quot; She looked at \nhim, &quot;But yes, I shall keep what you ask confidencial. After all, if \nyou can&#39;t trust your fellow fighters, who can you trust.&quot;  She smiled \nand winked at him. &quot;I&#39;m a wolf. We keep secrets well.&quot; \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bustercross365&quot; &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice ordered a mug of energon and whiskey.  He sat at the table \n&gt; with Wolfblade and set the chunk of energon he had on the table.\n&gt; &quot;What you see here on the table is an ordinary piece of natrually \n&gt; occuring energon.  It stores massive amounts of energy, and thus is \n&gt; dangerous when exposed to high doses of its radiation.  I, however, \n&gt; can reside in a large field of high density energon.  Why you ask?  \n&gt; Because of this!&quot;\n&gt; Malice held his hand over them crystal, and started to absorb all \nof \n&gt; its energy.  Soon it was an empty transparent crystal.\n&gt; &quot;I can absorb various forms of energy, and use it.  Not only can I \ngo \n&gt; long periods of fasting, I can drain energy from energon, \ngenerators, \n&gt; even other transformers.  This is a rare ability, not many possess \n&gt; it.  So I would like for you to keep this to yourself.  Advertising \n&gt; it would draw more enemies than any of us can handle.&quot; \n&gt; He took a drink from his mug and awaited Wolfblade&#39;s response.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&gt; &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She ordered hot energon soup and a cup of liquid energon. She sat \n&gt; &gt; down and sipped from her cup. &quot;You know, this isn&#39;t half bad.  \nBut \n&gt; &gt; per my program, I&#39;d prefere a god hunt followed by a fresh kill \nof \n&gt; &gt; deer.  How about you?&quot;  She had some of the soup and looked at \n&gt; &gt; Malice. &quot;OK, my curiousity is peaked. What is it you wanted to \ntalk \n&gt; &gt; about?&quot; as she sipped from her cup.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice looked over the avalible menu as he crunched on the \nsmall \n&gt; &gt; piece of energon he had from eariler.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ve been chewin&#39; on this raw stuff.  This high energy, near \n&gt; toxic \n&gt; &gt; energon does please the palette, but I&#39;m for a hot meal.  You \npick.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
