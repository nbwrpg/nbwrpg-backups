Was he really going to kill her? She twisted and turned, \nbut he had a good hold on her.  She knew that his wold instints were taking \nover.  She had to react fast.  She let out an ear splitting screek. Then she \nreached with her tallon and scratched his arm, the one that held her.  She \nflapped her wings as hard as she could.  She was flapping her wings hard \nenough to almost lift him off the ground.\n&quot;The game isn&#39;t over yet. Kill me and it will be.&quot;\nShe realized that if he didn&#39;t span out of it, the wolf in him would kill \nher. She tried to claw at his face with her talons.\n\n----Original message----\nFrom:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\nDate: Wed Jul 5, 2000 9:06pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\nLunarpine stopped suddenly, smelling the crow realizing the irony of\nthe owls catch. All he could think how he&#39;d under reacted to her\ntrick.\n\nThe wolf transformed to bot again and lunged forward pinning the owl\nto the ground.&quot;You let your gaurd down before confirming the game was\nover.&quot; He raised a claw to the owls throat. &quot;So what am I going to do\nwith a dead carcas?&quot; He lifted Shadow Wing into the ait claw still poised \nfor the kill.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
