Malevolent and dark he brooded as his clawed finger\ntapped casually on the metal armrest of his throne. In front of him\nseveral view screens sat depicting the scene of a battle before him,\nthe figures easily recognizable to anyone who had been watching up to\nthis point: Azureblade and Animus. To the side of the screen numbers\nand graphs depicted the energy readings and power fluxuations that were\nbeing detected.\n\n�Interesting.� Came the deep almost metallic sounds of Vorpal�s voice.\n�Do you have all that you require Krytek.� Vorpal turned ever so\nslightly to take in the tall and some might even say imposing form\nstanding off to the side.\n\nSitting at a console, the deep shadows of this chamber masks many of\nKrytek�s features, only the lights from his faceplate are visible as\nthey blink on and off. �Negative.� Krytek�s voice is cold as he speaks,\n�However the scans are nearly complete. The X4 unit is operating within\nits design specification, but it was not originally manufactured for\nthis purpose.� Krytek depressed a few more keys on his console, �It is\nalso unlikely that Animus will survive long enough to complete our\ntests. He will require assistance.�\n\nVorpal�s clawed fingers stilled their tapping for a moment as the\nunicronian general paused thoughtfully. �Perhaps this intruder could\nuse a bit more ... stimulus.� His voice displayed just the slightest\ntouch of humor. �Begin phase 2.�\n\n�Understood.� Krytek responded simply as he turned to his console, \nquickly weapon system displays were brought up ... \n\nSomewhere above them, on the surface of the moon a single missile\nlauncher rose from a hidden location, turned to orient on some fixed\npoint and abruptly launched a rather large missile into the faint\natmosphere of the moon. The missile quickly flared, shot forward and\nwithin moments is gone from sight, even as the missile launcher itself\nbegan lowering itself out of view.\n\n(See more after Nic&#39;s Insert)\n\n--- Nic &lt;warriorazure@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Azureblade was caught by the blinding beam, but he stayed calm as his\n&gt; sword and Animus`s locked together.\n&gt; \n&gt; Azureblade: Now, you die.\n&gt; \n&gt; His jammed optics eerily sought out Animus&#39;s face and the predatory\n&gt; grin slowly turned into a savage laugh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unexpectedly, the attack started elsewhere than where Animus was\n&gt; looking. It came right at the center of his spark. Slowly, the\n&gt; Protoform Z part of Azureblade was trying to tear its way into the\n&gt; Minion&#39;s very spark.\n&gt; \n&gt; AzureBlade: My legacy... Protoform X could feed off fear inside a\n&gt; spark... He was botched... I will rip out your very mind!\n\nAnimus stepped back and stumbled as fear ripped over him like claws. He\nstruggled to hold off Azure&#39;s attack, even as his arms weakened in\nfear! Then suddenly like a beacon of light a rather large missile rose\nover the lunar horizon, and for a moment a smile spread across Animus&#39;\nface as he fell back, and rather than readying himself for death, he\nbegan to laugh!\n \nThe missile on the other hand rather than targeting Azure, crashed on\nthe moon&#39;s rocky surface, and rather than exploding, a large cargo\nsized door opened outward. Out of the door poured dozens of small\nCarmine red spheres, roughly half the size of a transformer�s head.\nThey floated in the air as if orienting on prey and then as if on some\ncue they began flying at Azure, attempting to attach themselves to his\narmor!\n\nAnimus tried to back away from Azure ...\n\nPreston\n(Da�minion)\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
