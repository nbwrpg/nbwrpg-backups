She ran \nout, slight in front and too the side of Ramulus.  She wanted to keep \nhim wthin her sight, just in case.  But she also wanted to scout \naround just befor the meeting.  Even thought they said they would be \nalone, she knew that the Trainers were just as smart as they were.  \nIf Ramulus could come up with cloaking devices, so could the \ntrainers.  But she had to bare in mind, the cloaking device cloaked \nsignature, sight and all visable parts of the bot.  The only thing it \ndidn&#39;t cloak, was scent. And she wanted to test with her nose, not \nher eyes or Radar.  She stayed about 50 yards out from Ramulus, with \nhim still in eye sight and sniffed around. But she knew it would be a \nwhile untill they reached the meeting place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
