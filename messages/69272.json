Perceptor Activated all inner and \n&gt; &gt; outside dedfen=\r\nces who instatntly starts to shoot agains Megatron, \nKup \n&gt; &gt; and Grymlock,=\r\n as well as Cyclonus and Scourge, inside.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hydras and Jhiaxus opene=\r\nd fire against Scourge and Cyclonus. \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor hoped that Dark Rodimus=\r\n soon be ready and join to repel \nthe \n&gt; &gt; unpleasant visitors outside\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Cyclonus looked quizzically at Hydras for a moment, &quot;Oh, you think\n&gt; super=\r\nior firepower is what I meant about being worthy?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Stepping back a pa=\r\nce Cyclonus mearly extended his hand as Hydras&#39;\n&gt; blast came at him.

They had =\r\ntrouble locking on, not just\n&gt; because of Scourge&#39;s sensor scattering armor=\r\n, but because Cyclonus \nwas\n&gt; no longer registering a minion of Unicron but=\r\n as a pure Decepticon, \nas\n&gt; he had once done . . . or will do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blasti=\r\nng a door inward Scourge stepped inside to avoid any other\n&gt; attack, &quot;Come =\r\non Cyc.&quot; he grunted as he stepped into the door, wary \nof\n&gt; any attack from=\r\n the interior of the room. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus nodded as he spoke to Hydras, &quot;Un=\r\ntil you are able to look\n&gt; beyond this base, or even this feeble world you =\r\nare not the leader \nfor\n&gt; which the decepticons seek!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus steppe=\r\nd through the door Scourge had blown open, and with\n&gt; only the slightest to=\r\nuch of power blew out another door, revealing a\n&gt; hall. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus nodd=\r\ned as he and Scourge shifted modes and flew onward,\n&gt; attempting to escape!=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
