I&#39;ll\n&gt; join the boat patrol and try to refit the scanners so we can see if\n&gt; he&#39;s underwater.\n&gt; \n&gt; He plunges from great height, not noticing a metal bird as he does.\n&gt; Still scanning the sea&#39;s surface, his left rear wheel is about to\n&gt; collide with Myrmidon...\n\nOOC: I am sorry if I am being too much of a stickler, however ... keep\nin mind that Myrmidon is probrably sitting at 10,000 feet in the air ..\ngive or take a few thousand. To most of you he is just an odd somewhat\nbird shaped dot. Rodimus can see him because he has fancy extended\nvision. However I believe it would be difficult for a Flying Delorean\nto reach that altitude, never mind do it by accident. I am not sure of\nthe specifications of your character or vehicle, so I don&#39;t want to\ncrazy about it, but that just seems to be a bit too casual. At the very\nleast it would take a few moments to reach that high, and Myrmidon\nwould have just moved .. having watched Doc appraoch for some time. \n\nIf I am off base here please let me know.\n\nPlease feel free to shoot at me, point at me, ignore me, or even tell\nthe base systems to shoot the eagle out of the sky. (the base computer\nstill sees an avian).  \n\nI am open for all. I must admit thought that it does feel a bit odd\ntelling you folks to shoot at me, but hey it&#39;s all in fun!!\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
