Yet she is the first\n&gt; to speak up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s a good question, I&#39;m happy you&#39;re willing ta hear us out.  Leo is\n&gt; missing something most important and it&#39;s something Tucson has more than\n&gt; enough ta go around.  A heart.  I just don&#39;t see that in Leo and neither\n&gt; does Rattrap.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Yeah, the first time I met Tucson I knew he was special.  I just don&#39;t\n&gt; have that feeling around Leo.  As bad tempered as he is, he&#39;s got more\n&gt; compassion ta go around.  And he believes in us on a personal level.  Leo is\n&gt; okay but he ain&#39;t got what really matters.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They both put a paw over their chest.  Straight Shot speaks up again.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; When it all comes down to it, what matters most is what&#39;s in our hearts\n&gt; and a leader without a heart is like not having one at all.  And that&#39;s why\n&gt; we have a hard time with Leo.  If Tucson was here, he may have asked the\n&gt; same question.  Tucson has a really big heart and to me, he IS A LEADER.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a small smile on WINGCALIBER&#39;s face as he listened. &quot;I can\nremember when LEO PRIME was young, back when he found by his father,\nwho was back then LIO PRIME.&quot; There was a slight shrug, &quot;Back then the\nLeo we know was just known as Leo jr.&quot;\n\nSANTON nodded as he sat down his pack and came over as well. &quot;Yes, Leo\njr was much like Tuscon, young, exuberant, full of energy and even\ncompassion.&quot; SANTON looked whistful as he thought of the past.\n\n&quot;He was much like that.&quot; WINGCALIBER said as he spoke again. &quot;But that\nwas many years and many battles ago. Since then he has become a prime,\nand the old Lio Prime became Lio Convoy and eventually Leo himself\nbecame a Prime.&quot;\n\nThere was a compassionate look from SANTON, &quot;He is going through the\nnatural growing pains of a leader.&quot; He nodded, &quot;Tuscon is a new Prime\nand has been a warrior for most of that time, he has not felt the\nstings of betrayal yet from the Predacons that Leo has.&quot;\n\nWINGCALIBER nodded, &quot;Do not judge him so harshly because he doesn&#39;t\ntrust the Predacons. I have watched him grow as a warrior and a\nleader, and I have seen the forces that have shaped him.&quot;\n\nSANTON grunted, &quot;Most leaders, most Primes start off much the way\nTuscon is now, full of life and full of trust. &quot; He nodded, &quot;I have\nserved under a few myself. but if not careful the weight of having men\ndie under your command, the weight of having to make the choices that\nwould send men to their deaths can be a burden that changes you.&quot;\n\nGesturing at the door that RAT TRAP and STRAIGHT SHOT had just come\nthrough, &quot;He is a different leader than Tuscon because he has been\nthrough different things, but that doesn&#39;t make him a bad leader, only\ndifferent. Perhaps Tuscon would have made ultimately different\nchoices, but that is the job of a leader, to make those hard choices\ndespite what everyone else wants . . . despite what he may himself\nwant to do.&quot;\n\nThe words of SANTON and WINGCALIBER are not harsh or accusatory, but\nreasoning and questioning, asking STRAIGHT SHOT and RAT TRAP to do the\nvery things they are asking of LEO PRIME, to trust, even when it\ndoesn&#39;t always make sense to.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
