Yet he was\n&gt; still shaking from his ordeal.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I think they got shook up too, but Primus knows where they&#39;re headed. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns to Wolfgang.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I never told anyone else this, but when I was in stasis, I had a dream.\n&gt; But it wasn&#39;t just any regular dream.  It was raining and I was standn&#39; out\n&gt; over the Ark, lookn&#39; up at the sky.  It was almost as black as my fur, but\n&gt; through that darkness, I saw light.  Like lightning, through the storm\n&gt; clouds.  It shimmered like lightning, but then somethn&#39; broke through those\n&gt; clouds.  Well, almost completely broke through, and behind the thin cover, I\n&gt; could see my big buddie&#39;s shape, with his long tail trailn&#39; behind him, and\n&gt; then, what sounded like thunder came outa his mouth and when he roared, I\n&gt; could see pebbles jump&#39;n on the ground, and feel the vibration under my\n&gt; paws.  And after he roared, the sky opened up and you could see this really\n&gt; bright light kinda filtering through on the ground.  Then, I woke up.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He puts a paw on Wolfgang&#39;s shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Master Yoketron believed that dreams that seemed almost real, were\n&gt; reflections of what was ta come in our lives.  I have a really good feeln&#39;\n&gt; we&#39;re all gonna come outa this on top.  And things will get better.  I know\n&gt; they will.  Because when you hear that thunder through the clouds, you know\n&gt; change is in the forecast.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWOLFGANG looked at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;You sound like one of those priests of\nPrimus.&quot; He said as nodded. &quot;One who is loyal to his friend.&quot; He\nsmiled, &quot;Not too bad a combination I guess.&quot; He said as he look\nupwards at the last of the energy motes that were moving into the\nskies.\n\n&quot;If the queen is in that mess then she went out in pieces.&quot; POLAR CLAW\nsaid as he also looked up. Each one of the motes that had escaped\nvaried from the size of a Cybertronian fist up to about the size of\none&#39;s head.\n\n&quot;Perhaps.&quot; PROWL said, &quot;But we have no idea what we have released.&quot;\n\nWOLFGANG nodded as LORD ELDER&#39;s words came over the radio. &quot;Great. We\ngo from combat duty to repair mechs.&quot;\n\nPOLAR CLAW looked around at the others, &quot;Well you heard him, we have\nwork to do.&quot; he looked over at RAMULUS, &quot;Watch the craft, we have no\nidea what else is going on. And we are going to need an easy way outta\nhere after this trip.&quot;\n\nRAMULUS nodded as he stepped off the craft.\n\nMeanwhile PROWL and WOLFGANG prepared to go inside again, hopefully\nthis time without a battle.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
