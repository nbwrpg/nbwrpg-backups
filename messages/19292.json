Then=\r\n he walked away.  He walked over to a \n  small cabinet.  He pulled out a sm=\r\nall remote and then walked back to \n  her.  He pushes a button on the remot=\r\ne and a huge tank of water \n  appeared infront of them. It had glass walls,=\r\n she could see the water \n  inside the tank.  She wondered if he was going =\r\nto try to drown her.  \n  He pushed another button and 7 sharkticons appeare=\r\nd in the tank.
