She \ncould barely out fly it with her wing damaged.  she swerved in and \nout of the trees. Her owl instincts taking over. She dove and rose.  \nThe missle was closing in. &quot;Got to out think it.&quot; she told herself.\nShe held still in front of a tree for a few seconds.  She watched the \nmissle close in.  She swooped down and let an air draft help lift her \nup and the missle hits the tree she was just in front of.  she glided \ndown and landed.  She transformed into bot mode and ran over to \nProwl. She opened fire on Zeus. &quot;Glad to see you joined the party \nLunarpine.&quot; She smiled and shot at Zeus again.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Zeus/Killer/Prowl/Striker::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zeus dives under Torca&#39;s shot, one missile firing at Torca and \nanother at \n&gt; Shadow Wing.
