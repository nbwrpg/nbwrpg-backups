He positioned \nhimself\n&gt; under Redhot&#39;s arm, to support him. He began to speak calmly, &quot;No, \nit&#39;s\n&gt; not my right to judge you worthy of being saved.&quot; he said, although \na\n&gt; bit disturbed by the voice, he knew he had heard it before. &quot;I just \ndo\n&gt; what I feel is right, and letting anyone die isnt.&quot; he then thought\n&gt; reflectivly. &lt;Would Cliffjumper have done the same, or has he gone \nto\n&gt; far from the Autobots path as well as the Maximals. Firedrill was \nstill\n&gt; young, and could be taught. They had to remember, war or no war, \nlife is\n&gt; precious. He hoped he was wrong.&gt; Beachcomber hoped Redhot was \nstrong\n&gt; enough. &quot;Do you have anyplace to go?&quot; he asked, not sure what the \nnext\n&gt; course of actions was. He was now an outcast, and wondered what \nhappened\n&gt; to the other three he was with.\n&gt; \n\n::REDHOT::\n\n    His smile softened. He tried to regain his legs and he trembled \nunder the effort. \n    &quot;You ...sound very much... l...like an Autobot.&quot; he said, humor\nin \nhis voice. &quot;You... r...emind... me of the... ones I left at... \nh...ome.&quot;\n    Confident that he could continue standing, he tested his legs by \nwalking in a small circle around the Autobot. He turned to face \nBeachcomber and gave him his characteristic Michevious grin. When he \ngot that look you knew he had something in mind.\n    &quot;Mind..you..some of them have..n..no sense of humor.&quot; he\nchuckled. \n&quot;I love..pran..pranks.&quot; His expression looked pained for a momment.\nIt was obvious he was homesick. &quot;Until...I recover completely....I \n..can..not go..h...home.&quot; he said, depressed. &quot;I..I have..no..no\nplace to go.&quot; \n    A pause lapsed before he spoke again. \n    &quot;My name is Redhot.&quot;\n\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n***************************\n\n\n"}}
