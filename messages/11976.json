But...this is a matter of confusion.  \nFirst of Jason, how do you fly into the bridge, take the charge, and \nget out of the base in under 5 seconds?  That&#39;s just confusing.\n\nSeconds, Minime, had a better chance, but he carried Spears into the \nArk (of course, this could be as the bomb was being set, I&#39;m not \nsure), set her outside of the room in about a second.  I&#39;m sorry, at \nthe least that would be 3 seconds or so.  Unless the character that \nwas helping her was the Flash.  But I don&#39;t care, if you wanna keep \nit this way, it&#39;s all the same to me, I&#39;m not going to argue this \nearly in the morning for something as unimportant as that.  Of \ncourse, Minime, before you picked up Spears, you must&#39;ve missed the \npost where I believe...Jhogan (Xiane) picked her up and carried her \ninto the Ark, which was before yours.  So your post is void, unless \nyou still want to do whatever the hell you did.  By the way, this \nisn&#39;t my last problem out one of Icedemon&#39;s transgressions.  So Ice, \nthere&#39;s another one.  And YOU are pushing ME to the edge.  At a nice \nspeedy pace)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
