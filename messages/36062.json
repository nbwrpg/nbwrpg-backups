His sensors showed a possability of overheating if\n&gt; the firey assault continued.

The force of the blow knocks him backwards a step, and\n&gt; &gt; almost sets him off balance, and denting his heavy barricade mode\n&gt; &gt; armour. He steps back again, and levels his freeze cannons at Arty&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; shoulders in an attempt to stop the bot from moving his arms at the\n&gt; &gt; shoulder. He fires twice with each arm freeze cannon for the joints.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Crossroads notices the strength advantage that the new bot\n&gt; &gt; fighting with them has, and yells to the bot, (the bum) &quot;Hey large\n&gt; &gt; new bot, (he describes the bot, kinda like &quot;hey you over there with\n&gt; &gt; the red shirt&quot; &#39;cept I don&#39;t know what the bot really looks like\n&gt; &gt; =P), CATCH!&quot; he transforms into plasma shield and sword mode,\n&gt; &gt; launching himself at the bum, hilt and handle ready to be grabbed.\n&gt; &gt; (Yan, if bum doesn&#39;t want Crossroads, he&#39;ll just transform again =)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 30 May 2001, at 8:10, CYBERWOLF4 wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Air to ground, I was thinking Anti-Gravity.

With a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vicious jab with his open hand he lands a crashing blow to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pacifix&#39;s chest region.
