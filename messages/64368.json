By now, anyone with minimum electronic\nsenses would have realized that the Silver Wings had managed to build\na warship. It was time to vent his fury.\n\nHe called for a live connection  with the other Lords and Lady. He set\nit as a high priority message that would intenionally disturb what\nthey were doing.\n\nRazorwing: Lords and Lady, dear colleagues, you might not have\nrealized it, but we have just been caught unaware. Two minions alone\nhave destroyed an orbital production plant and crippled my Silver Wing\nwarship. There have been dozens of casualties, most of them workers\nfrom the station. This is the act we were dreading in silence. War has\nbeen declared! We have to act now! I thus convene an exceptional\nGovernmental Session between the five of us to decide on the course of\nactions. I will welcome you here in Relay in just a few cycles. Be\nsure to be there!\n\nOOC: All Lords and Lady must leave their current tasks on Friday the\n12 of august. the Session will begin Saturday during the day.\n\n\n\n"}}
