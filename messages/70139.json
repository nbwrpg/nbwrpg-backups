Agitated&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Before the door slid open there was a small bell that went off, the\n&gt; warning that someone was coming. This was a warning put in so that the\n&gt; guard in the room could never be surprised by anyone entering the\n&gt; room. This was typically useful for the transport of prisoners, but at\n&gt; this time it worked in Rodimus&#39; favor as he was able to hit the mute\n&gt; button so Tuscon&#39;s reply - if there was one - would not be broadcast\n&gt; into the room.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m doing fine.&quot; Rodimus said trying to force his voice into a\n&gt; semblance of calm for Perceptor, he wasn&#39;t sure if it was working.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m just watching the prisoners.&quot; he said as he leaned back in his\n&gt; chair and began idly flipping through the screens and the cells,\n&gt; trying to look as calm and unagitated as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; The screen switched to display Nightshift.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
