He begins to pull the trigger, \nbut his finger stops halfway through.\n\nSomething was wrong... His programming was telling him to fire, but \nsomething was defying that command. He tightens his finger over the \ntrigger again, attempting to fire his weapon.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine&#39;s shot in the shoulder on the arm holding on around \nSlayer. The\n&gt; shock of the sudden pain causes him to lose his grip. Lunarpine \nretracts his\n&gt; claws desperately reaching  out with his right hand and grabs \nSlayers left\n&gt; ankle still trying to force a level confrontation on the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You call yourself Slayer? so far the names full of false \nadvertising.&quot; the\n&gt; wolfbot claims as he holds on for dear life. He still wasn&#39;t sure \nabout\n&gt; weather or not his body could handle the fall. He looked down and \nsaw\n&gt; mountainous slopes with snow. they&#39;d gone a ways since the battle \nbegan.\n\n\n"}}
