Bazooka awoke from \nStasis Lock. He transformed into Beast Mode and started to wonder around. I \nmust find a base. He thought to himself. Unfortuantly he didn&#39;t remember much \nof his programming. He didn&#39;t remember how to transform into robot mode \nanymore. He started walking around and something triggered a deep hatred. He \nremembered the bot known as Quickstrike and his mad persuit. Soon he rembered \nthat he had been blasted by Autoguns somewhere. That was all he could \nremember. He wandered for hours like this just looking at his surroundings. \nHe became quite acuanted with the world in these hours.\n    After many hours he came across a base, he tried to remember if he had \never been there before but he couldn&#39;t remember. He walked in. Memories came \nflooding back. Yes he had been here before. He remembered. \n    &quot;I am a Predacon.&quot; Bazooka said to himself. &quot;Bazooka Terrorize&quot; Now in \nhis familiar robot mode he wandered the halls. He came across the Mighty \nMegatron.\n    &quot;Do you still wish for me to attack the Ark?&quot; He asked.\n\n"}}
