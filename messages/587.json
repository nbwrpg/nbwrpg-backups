If he had been a \nlesser bot he would have jumped for joy at the announcement of battle, but \nto do so would taint his honor and disgrace himself. He just smiled to \nhimself and looked down at his claws, did he need another, more stronger \nweapon?\nDinobot thought that his new body was stronger then he really needed but he \nwasn&#39;t one to complain about that, but was it strong enough to ward off 3 \nmaybe even 4 Predacon attackers? He sighed, if it could then good for it but \nright now he had to conserve it&#39;s energy.\nDinobot looked at Tavatron and a smile played at the edges of his lips, he \nreached behind himself and pulled out a reround laser-pulse rifle, he had \nfound it in the same room that Tavatron and himself were in only half a \nmega-cycle ago.\nHe slammed a load cartridge into the loading dock of the rifle and powered \nup the fusion pulse, he then looked at Tavatron...a sinister yet pleased \nlook on his face.*\n\n&quot;You were saying?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
