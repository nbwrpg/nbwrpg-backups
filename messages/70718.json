I also understand your reservations on the matter.  I=\r\n can tell just by the tones of your voices, but I also comprehend the reaso=\r\nn behind it and it&#39;s only normal to have reservations.  I am not offended b=\r\ny your true feelings, but thankful you are willing to give Perceptor the ch=\r\nance to prove himself worthy.&quot;\n\nBefore Tucson had been upgraded to a Prime,=\r\n this sort of talk would often anger him to the point of grave annoyance.  =\r\nHe&#39;d often speak up and stick up for those being riddiculed and whenever ne=\r\ncesary, he probably would have lost his temper all together and decked the =\r\noffender right there and then.  But now, he realizes those feelings did not=\r\n come through.  Something was definitely changing.  Instead of being his ol=\r\nd self, he was evolving into someone new, wiser, more tolerant, and a lot m=\r\nore calm as an individual.  Yet, his toughness was still there, along with =\r\nhis courage, and will to fight.  He could not yet understand the meaning of=\r\n these changes, and for whatever reason, he knew they were for the better. =\r\n He now turns his head in Legacy&#39;s direction.\n\n&quot; Even as a Prime, I&#39;m still=\r\n in the process of learning.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever stop learning.  One t=\r\nhing I have to admit, if I were still my old self now, short tempered, quic=\r\nk to be critical, I may have blown the roof off the Ark, and retorted adver=\r\nsely.  But now, I couldn&#39;t find it in my spark to react as such.  I&#39;m chang=\r\ning, and as I change, I can feel the pressense of Optimus Prime.  I often f=\r\neel that if I could see my shadow, it would appear as his once did, long ag=\r\no.  Why is that?  I know I&#39;m not Optimus, yet there is a part of me that fe=\r\nels that he&#39;s within me somehow. Legacy, is there something about me that e=\r\nven I do not know?  I&#39;m very curious to find out.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As T=\r\nucson allows himself to be scanned, thoughts race actively in his\n&gt; &gt; direc=\r\ntory.
