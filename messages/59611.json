He sat at the table \nwith Wolfblade and set the chunk of energon he had on the table.\n&quot;What you see here on the table is an ordinary piece of natrually \noccuring energon.  It stores massive amounts of energy, and thus is \ndangerous when exposed to high doses of its radiation.  I, however, \ncan reside in a large field of high density energon.  Why you ask?  \nBecause of this!&quot;\nMalice held his hand over them crystal, and started to absorb all of \nits energy.  Soon it was an empty transparent crystal.\n&quot;I can absorb various forms of energy, and use it.  Not only can I go \nlong periods of fasting, I can drain energy from energon, generators, \neven other transformers.  This is a rare ability, not many possess \nit.  So I would like for you to keep this to yourself.  Advertising \nit would draw more enemies than any of us can handle.&quot; \nHe took a drink from his mug and awaited Wolfblade&#39;s response.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She ordered hot energon soup and a cup of liquid energon. She sat \n&gt; down and sipped from her cup. &quot;You know, this isn&#39;t half bad.  But \n&gt; per my program, I&#39;d prefere a god hunt followed by a fresh kill of \n&gt; deer.  How about you?&quot;  She had some of the soup and looked at \n&gt; Malice. &quot;OK, my curiousity is peaked. What is it you wanted to talk \n&gt; about?&quot; as she sipped from her cup.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Malice looked over the avalible menu as he crunched on the small \n&gt; piece of energon he had from eariler.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ve been chewin&#39; on this raw stuff.  This high energy, near \ntoxic \n&gt; energon does please the palette, but I&#39;m for a hot meal.  You pick.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
