Your thoughts are your&#39;s and I won&#39;t intrude.&quot; She cut off \nthe link to FoxFingers, and stopped reading his mind.\n\nShe smiled and easied up on her hug with Lunarpine &quot;And I won&#39;t \nforget. But I&#39;ll be able to back you up in fights a lot better now \nthat I am what I am.&quot; She kissed his cheek. &quot;I was worried about you \nwhile you were gone.

I&#39;ll not leave you \nagain.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine flinched as Ice got him in a &quot;Bear&quot; hug She was at least \n&gt; five times the strength she was as Shadow Wing. &quot;Take it easy on \nthe \n&gt; metal, I don&#39;t want to end up in the CR chamber over a hug.&quot; He \n&gt; laughed and put his arms around her. &quot;And don&#39;t think you&#39;re \ngetting \n&gt; out of my promise to protect you just because you&#39;re stronger than \n&gt; me.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Foxfingers froze in his tracks for a moment when Ice entered his \n&gt; head. The robotic equivelincy to Homer Simpsons &quot;DOH&quot; came out as \nhe \n&gt; slapped himself in the forehead. &quot;I&#39;ll remember that trick .&quot; He \n&gt; thought back as he began down the hall again. He still wasn&#39;t sure \n&gt; about the extent of her powers but he still wanted his thoughts to \nbe \n&gt; kept secret. If Veratis knew that he&#39;d broken into the maximal \n&gt; weapons locker then into a Predacon base he wouldn&#39;t be a happy \n&gt; scientist.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the lab Veratis tried duplicating the steps that he&#39;d taken but \n&gt; for some reason the bot who&#39;d just recieved Dinobots DNA seemed \nmore \n&gt; agressive towards accepting it. Veratis figured it was just the \n&gt; difference betwee Ice and this bot until he realized that he&#39;d \n&gt; forgotten to check the chip. Sure enough He was dealing with a \n&gt; Predacon Protoform this time. He tried to delay so he could program \n&gt; it but it was to late. The chip had taken effect and the Predacon \nwas \n&gt; on his way to being born.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
