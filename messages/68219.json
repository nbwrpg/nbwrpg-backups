Do we have anything to destroy it in the ductwork? \n\n\nOOC: Keep in mind, there are still only two spider spies - one here and one in the shuttle bay. I was just trying to give you a visual of roaches scattering. I don&#39;t think the spider spies can procreate or clone themselves .. athough that is an interesting idea! :)\n\nPreston\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
