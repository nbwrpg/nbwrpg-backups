She whimpered at the pain in\n&gt; her ribs when he lifted her up. Her legs where pretty well banged\n&gt; up.  She was covered in scraped and cuts.  She lifted her head\n&gt; slightly and looked at Atma. &quot;Forgive me, what was your question?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She was having trouble breathing.  Her chest hurt with every breath.\n&gt; She gasped a few times and caughed real hard.  She growled at the\n&gt; pain running through her body.  She closed her eyes for a few moments\n&gt; tto at wonder how the Matrix seamed to have it in for her lately.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; DrillBit looked at KitKat.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Most of everyone is scattered around here.
