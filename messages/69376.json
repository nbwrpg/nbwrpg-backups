Knowing that their onl=\r\ny hope of survival was to safely crash land, the pilot picked an open area =\r\nof ocean and tried to approach at a safe angle to slow itself enough to kee=\r\np the ship intact.\n\nLord Perseus and his crew walked along the bridge that =\r\ncrossed the gap between the part of the island where the hangers were locat=\r\ned and the peninsula area where the base sat.  Suddenly the sky became dark=\r\n and a rumbling noise could be heard, growing louder and louder.  He looked=\r\n up to see almost the whole sky occupied by a massive starship seemly headi=\r\nng straight for the island.  The Atlantis emergency alarm started to sound =\r\nand civilians rushed to their shelters.\n\n&quot;Everyone!  To the base!  Hurry!&quot; =\r\nordered Perseus breaking out into a run.\n\nThe rumbling sound continued to g=\r\net louder.  As Perseus and his crew reached the base door, it was quickly o=\r\npened for them then shut behind them.  He ordered everyone to move the lowe=\r\nr level of the base.  As the ship passed over the island, the sound grew so=\r\n loud that the ground shook and weaker parts of buildings started to crumbl=\r\ne, as in an earthquake.  The ship traveled for another three miles before i=\r\nt touched down in the deep ocean waters.  The force of the impact sent the =\r\nship hundreds of feet below the surface and it continued to sink until comi=\r\nng to rest on the top of an underwater mountain.  The mass of water displac=\r\ned by the ship started a massive tsunami-like wave, going out in all direct=\r\nions.\n\nThe ground began to shake again and the lights flickered inside the =\r\nMaximal base.\n\n&quot;Sir, what&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing the last he=\r\navy door to the underground section of the base.\n\nThe lights continued to f=\r\nlicker, then went out.\n\nAt that moment the ten-story-high wall of water str=\r\nuck Atlantis from the east, picking up all the boats in the harbor and toss=\r\ning them onto the land.  The parts of the docks that were not made of concr=\r\nete were pushed up and destroyed.  A moment later the water hit the buildin=\r\ngs in the lower wharf area and they immediately collapsed under the intense=\r\n weight of water.  Likewise the metal dome that made up the upper story of =\r\nthe Maximal base was immediately ripped from its foundations and carried aw=\r\nay, along with everything in the command center, the armory, mess hall, and=\r\n the main bank of CR chambers were also picked up and carried away.\n\nThe lo=\r\nwer floor of the base had a large metal slab to protect it from bombing, an=\r\nd as the water continued to pour over it, everything on the upper floors wa=\r\ns ripped away, leaving a clean plate of metal sitting at the bottom of the =\r\ncrater that was the base.  The buildings along the center of the town were =\r\na little sturdier and remained standing, though heavily damaged.  The hange=\r\nr and all the craft in it were picked up and thrown into the ocean.\n\nAs the=\r\n water came to tower it filled up the deep trench around the structure then=\r\n the wall hit it, wrapping it entirely except for the top five stories, dam=\r\naging supports, breaking out all the windows and destroying the bridges tha=\r\nt allowed access to the tower.  The wave then continued across the rest of =\r\nthe island, destroying buildings and carrying away the mass of debris, and =\r\nthen all was eerily quiet.\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0019_01C9C4E1.043270B0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Dutf-8&gt;\n&lt;META=\r\n content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6001.18226&quot;
