By the way it swung its tail it seemed as if \nno, but there was always a way.\nHowever, even as she watched this creature something moving caught her \nattention, besides the moving tail of the scorpion.\nIt was another of those 2 legged things, only slimmer and faster.( Feline)\nRage snapped her head and twisted her body in it�s direction as it \napproached quickly, her neck sweeping forward and her jaws opening \nwide�coming inches towards the creatures middle.\nThis wasn�t a simple voyage of curiosity anymore, it was life and death�and \nshe had no intent of dying!\nThese things that swarmed out of the metal structure were like ants, savage \nand quick to defend.\nBut she was surrounded by these things and couldn�t get away, so she had no \nchoice but to fight and protect herself.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
