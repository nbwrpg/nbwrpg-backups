Once he got inside he ran to the lab. Good, thought \nMagmatron, now we can begin making him Destron.\n    He made his way down to the lab. Once he came in view he started to get \nready.\n    &quot;Bobertron, who is your friend? No matter right now. Lay down on the \ntable and we can begin.&quot; Magmatron oredered. He set the controls for \nautomatic and brought the catbot to the other lab.\n    &quot;Computer scan room for alligence.&quot; Magmatron said. \n    &quot;One Destron signal and one Maximal signal in room.&quot; The computer replied.\n    &quot;Maximal, hmmm...he could come in handy.&quot; Magmatron started to think. \nThen he turned his head and saw the screen with the Key to the Ark on it. \n&quot;Yes, that should do nicely.&quot;\n    He turned and went to a drawer, pressing a button it opened, inside were \nthree cases with one chip in each. He picked one up. He then walked back over \nto the cat and opened a hatch in his head. Ever so carefully he placed the \nchip in the right place. He then closed the hatch on his head.\n    Magmatron walked back over to the Computer station and started typing in \ncodes. And questions. Finally he programmed the slight fear of Maximals and \nPredacons.\n    As soon as that was done it was time for stage two. He went outside and \ntransformed to beast mode, he then lifted off with Cheetor on his back. \nLanding just outside of the scanner range for the Maximal base he put Cheetor \non the ground. He sent a signal so that the Maximals would know Cheetor was \nthere. Then he returned to base.\n\n"}}
