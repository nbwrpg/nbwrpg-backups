I was \nthinking of installing a few new fighting programs that he might find \nuseful, but the upgrades are really that big a deal. I could give him \nnew shoulder cannons and better optic lazars, but not much beyond \nthat.)\n\nSquizzy::\nShe checked on the Beholder clone. It was now 60% complete. She would \nmake the few modifications to the bot once it was out of the CR tank.\nShe went tot he old body of Beholder and pulled out the mother boards \nand memory circuits. She would install them whent he clone was \nfinished.\n\nThe Feline clone was only 35% complete. She would need more time to \nfinish that cat clone. The mother board was slightly damaged and the \nmemory circuits were only half there. Judging from the condition of \nthe cat body, the explosion that had originated internally had blown \nout alot of the nessassary circuitry that was needed for a complete \nclone. Squizzy would have to come up with something to fill in the \ngaps. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Excuse me, Logo, but what are the new things the Alliance made?\n&gt; Beholder had some pretty up to date stuff, I want to know what \nSquizzy is\n&gt; giving him please...\n\n\n\n"}}
