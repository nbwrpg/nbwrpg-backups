Our firts step would \nbe delete both programs, the Predacon program is more agressive and \nposessive and I foresee that it would be the most problematic... The MAximal \none may be corrupted or damaged... till her memories are restored  and with \nthem her bonds with maximals we must be carefull cause she wont know if we \nare enemies or foes... in your case anyway cause I doubt that she would be \nhappy to see me.

He would have done the same for his offspring if \nhe had any.  Which brought him to think about Talon, and his future with \nher.  His love for her would never wane, and now, more than ever, he wanted \nso much to strengthen their bond.  But he had to conscentrate on the tasks \nat hand now.  After all, like Rodimus He too must carry himself like a \nPrime.  He gives a smile of approval, as Straight Shot transforms and \nconnects herself to his back, in cross bow mode.\n\n&quot; Now that we have Nightlight, Rodimus and Windlord back with us here, it&#39;s \ntime to think about how we&#39;re going to weaken Hydras and the insectoids, \nthus returning this planet to a more peaceful state of being.  We were not \nthe only ones affected by Hydras, I&#39;m sure of it, so if we do this in our \nhonor, we should carry out our mission for the preservation of this planet, \nand the innocent who reside here.  After all, it&#39;s what we do best, all of \nus.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;No let me explain myself&quot;replied perceptor he tought a second and said \n&gt; &gt; &quot;My\n&gt; &gt; suggestion is swich thier signatures, specialy Nightlight&#39;s; if Hydras \n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; seeking recapture her again, he will have to find her firts; let me tell \n&gt; &gt; me\n&gt; &gt; how: every cr in Blackfortress or our old base have a record of every \n&gt; &gt; bot\n&gt; &gt; signature that have been inside even in some cases took samples of \n&gt; &gt; them...\n&gt; &gt; do you remember what happened with Dinobot and his double in Beast wars? \n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; with Optimus Prime&#39;s puppet that MEgatron attemped to use against \n&gt; &gt; Autobots?\n&gt; &gt; something like that could happen again and had happened in Neo beast\n&gt; &gt; wars... Other way to defend themselves would be inserting a stealth \n&gt; &gt; program\n&gt; &gt; that will mask their signatures from every one, just like the device \n&gt; &gt; that I\n&gt; &gt; gave Nightlight to hide for Maximals... and unluky... for Hydras, it had \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; side effect to hide her for Predacons too. This one will work in that \n&gt; &gt; way\n&gt; &gt; but this one would be part of their bodies... not a device and could be \n&gt; &gt; used\n&gt; &gt; at will&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;it would be like we were playing hide and seek &quot;said Elita with a \n&gt; &gt; childish\n&gt; &gt; tone\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;a deadly serious one&quot;replied dryly Perceptor&quot;With those two options \n&gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; would be more safer in my point of view&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus nodded thoughtfully as Perceptor sppoke, his face going from\n&gt; what was mild alarm slowly into a more relaxed posture. He stood up\n&gt; and walked towards he daughter, scooping her up into his arms, &quot;You\n&gt; have been through a lot today young one.&quot; he said, his voice serious\n&gt; as he looked at her, &quot;This is not a choice that can be made lightly.\n&gt; Once we put that on you *we* might have trouble finding you too should\n&gt; you get lost.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus began to pace, holding Elita in his arms as he did so, his\n&gt; thoughts churning. He looked over at the comotose form of his wife,\n&gt; his optics still worried. So many choices to make, so many dangers.\n&gt;\n&gt; He sighed and turned to Perceptor, &quot;Do it.&quot; he said.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
