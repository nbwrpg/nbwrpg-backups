It does\ntransfer from one mechanical apature to another, but rather it creates\na temporary energized one and transfers from one in a manner I am not\naccustomed to.&quot;\n\nLEGACY tilted his head as he continued his scan, &quot;The distances this\nbridge could reached would not be great, perhaps planet wide only but\nit would cost signifigantly less in energy to use.&quot;\n\nLEO turned to look at STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;In the last report you guys sent\nback didn&#39;t the Predacons recover a device that DARK RODIMUS used\nduring his transport?&quot;\n\nLEGACY nodded, &quot;I have read the report. If that is a controller of\nsome type for this bridge network and we had access to this a device I\nmight be able to use it to scan for its home source.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n&gt; Talon:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Same with you&quot;said Talon\n\n"}}
