Are you aware that Decadel is trying to get the attention of any\n&gt; bots that may be inside Blackarachnia&#39;s base?  Blackarachnia or someone\n&gt; should have noticed him by now.  He banged on the door, and he tried using\n&gt; the comm-link.  Won&#39;t you please respond to his message?  He is asking if\n&gt; any bots are in the base and if he could join the predacons!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
