She sighs in relief.  She looks up to him.\n\n&quot; That was way too close that time Tucson.  Rodimus is right, what was that \nall about?&quot;\n\nTucson turns his attentions to Rodimus and Straight Shot.\n\n&quot; I - I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m sorry.  Of course, no harm will come to anyone \nhere, Legacy, Rodimus, excuse my actions, they were not done with the best \nof judgement.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to Tucson, and this time with a concerned look on her \nface.\n\n&quot; Ever since that day, you haven&#39;t been the same.  I know, I was there, and \nlemme tell ya it haunts me too.  Have ya ever thought ta open up about it \nTucson?  Maybe that would kinda help ya heal a little bit.  The wounds are \nstill fresh, even though that fight was a long time ago.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re right.  Rodimus, Legacy, I&#39;ve been keeping something from you for a \nlong time, and that&#39;s not what a respectable leader does.  A leader may be \nstrong but he too, must open up about the issues that weaken his state of \nmind.  It all started on the day of that battle, that had Rodimus abducted \nand taken over by Hydras and his forces.  I fought in that battle as a \nsoldier. And being a Ninjabot myself, I knew of Nightrazor&#39;s properties, yet \nI felt that if I barged in on Rodimus, it would only land me with a case of \ninsubordination.  So, I refrained from doing so, but tried to divert enemy \nattentions indirectly.  For the most part it worked and I was able to fight \nmy way through those who knew nothing about Ninjabot combat.  Yet, there \nwere seekers who were far more swift on their wings then I was on my wheels. \nThey were bearing down on the Autobots, to the point that I felt that if I \ndid not step in, there wouldn&#39;t be an Autobot left to defend the Ark or the \nplanet.&quot;\n\nHe pauses.\n\n&quot; From what I remember, I transformed into my vehicle mode, and started to \nkick up dirt from my tires, in hopes that a seeker would see what I was up \nto.  It worked, and I grabbed the attention of several, although I couldn&#39;t \nsee who they were because they were rather high up from me.  Then, suddenly, \nI was struck.  And I don&#39;t remember anything more than that.  A long time \nafterwards, I was brought back online, and when I woke up, I could only see \ndarkness.  At first, I thought it was a power outage, but then, I was told \nthat my optic sensors were completely destroyed by the cranial shot that I \nhad endured during that chase.  I asked about you Rodimus, but, no one could \ntell me what happened.  It was at that point where I knew that I failed you \nIf only I had listened to myself the first time, and came in front of you \nwhen you were chasing Nightrazor that first time.  You would not have \nsuffered as you had, nor would your family. And since then, I pledged to get \nback on my feet, and never let my defenses down again, and if I had to, I&#39;d \nstrike back harder than any Decepticon or Predacon could ever fathom.  I \nfailed you once Rodimus, and I pledged NEVER to let that happen again.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to Tucson with a thoughtful gaze.\n\n&quot;Wow, you never even told me all that before.  Well, since we&#39;re opening up \nabout it, I wish I could help you guys understand what happened, but I only \nremember a little bit more than he does. Right before he got shot, I saw \nCyclonus decending just a tad closser to us than the other seekers that were \nfollowing us.  I saw him take the shot and I screamed, and that&#39;s when \neverything went blank.  I think what would really help Tucson now, is \nknowing that what happened, really wasn&#39;t his fault.&quot;\n\nTucson now turns his head toward Megatron&#39;s body.\n\n&quot; Having the Decepticons here amongst us is highly un nerving to me.  There \nmust be a way to separate them from the Autobots, and place them in a safe \nlocation...  Wait, I remember something..  The Decepticons had their own \ncraft, The Nemisis...  Why couldn&#39;t we return them to their rightful craft \nand separate them from the Autobots, where both factions would be safe from \nharm?  Rodimus, due to circumbstances which I have just told you, for my own \nemotional stability, I can not have these Decepticons here.  But I&#39;m willing \nto help preserve them in a safe location away from the Ark.  Legacy, if you \ncould, I&#39;d like you to find out where the Nemisis is now located and if it \nis within reach.  Once located, I want the Decepticons brought safely back \nto their own ship, where they can rest in peace, thus leaving the Ark to the \nAutobots to do the same.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot smiles.\n\n&quot;Now that&#39;s more like the Tucson I know.  I like that idea, I like it alot.&quot;\n\nOutside the Ark, Uproar and Quickstride look to each other and just shrug \noff the event.\n\n&quot;Hmm, oh well, would&#39;ve been fun ta see them end up in the tar pit but, \nworks for me, Uproar.&quot;\n\nUproar nodds.\n\n&quot;Ditto.  Okay, so, I guess we can go back inside.&quot;\n\nThey get into beast mode, and prance back into the Ark. Yet, Uproar could \nnot help but look back with a perplexed look on his face.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hydras did a final shot and send a secret message to Nightrazor &quot;The \n&gt; &gt; door\n&gt; is open, time to leave&quot;and said in loud voice &quot;PREDACONS... RETREAT!!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Hydras picked up inferno and started to leave the area\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Tuscon&#39;s] eyes narrow dangerously.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;THAT&#39;S IT! I&#39;VE HAD ENOUGH!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He senses where Megatron&#39;s body was laying down, and slams his foot on \n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; chest, pointing an arrow straight for it!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; HYDRAS, NIGHTRAZOR, CYCLONUS, SCOURGE! IF YOU ARE WITHIN RANGE OF MY\n&gt; COMMUNICATIONS HEAR THIS! YOU DARE TO HARM MY FELLOW MAXIMALS AND \n&gt; AUTOBOTS,\n&gt; AND THREATEN TO TAKE THEIR LIVES! WELL, I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU TOO! YOU&#39;VE \n&gt; LEFT\n&gt; ME NO CHOICE BUT TO DO THE SAME TO YOU AS WELL! I HAVE MEGATRON&#39;S BODY \n&gt; UNDER\n&gt; MY FOOT, AND AN ARROW STRAIGHT FOR HIS CHEST CHAMBER! YOU STEP FOOT ANY\n&gt; FURTHER INTO MY ARK, TAKE ANOTHER AUTOBOT OR MAXIMAL AND I SWEAR I&#39;LL BE\n&gt; SURE HE NEVER WAKES UP! PERIOD!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; His voice echoes throught the Ark. With each word he rattles the Ark,\n&gt; voice booming like that of an angry lion. He was sick of the Predacons and\n&gt; Decepticon&#39;s attack on his Ark, and he holds his position over Megatron \n&gt; and\n&gt; awaits their response before doing anything to anyone. Yet, the arrow\n&gt; remains pointed for a perfect shot to the fallen Megatron&#39;s chest!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He then turns his head to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I want you to know you have full permission to permanently disable any\n&gt; predacons or Decepticons you see fit. Scour the parameters of the Ark, and\n&gt; be sure no one gets in, Rodimus. I&#39;ll handle Nightrazor in here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus looked at Tuscon, a look of complete surprise on his face, &quot;What \n&gt; are\n&gt; you doing?&quot; he said as he looked at Tuscon and then at the weapon that was\n&gt; being pointed at Megatron.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tuscon, Hydras is already retreating! LOOK!&quot; he said, pointing at Hydras\n&gt; who had picked up his fallen teammate and was already moving out of the \n&gt; Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this same time Legacy also stepped into the room, coming from one of \n&gt; the\n&gt; back corridors into the front. As a guardian, it was his job, his internal\n&gt; directive to keep the Ark and all of its occupants safe, an imperative \n&gt; that\n&gt; would also include even the Decepticons that were to wake up several \n&gt; million\n&gt; years later.\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy&#39;s single optic pulsed as he took in the scene, Hydras leaving and\n&gt; Tuscon pointing a weapon at Megatron to ensure that he did so.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;NONE OF THE ARK&#39;S OCCUPANTS ARE TO COME TO HARM.&quot; Legacy said, falling \n&gt; into\n&gt; his old coldly logical voice. His voice sounded nothing if not more \n&gt; formal,\n&gt; his tones frigid, his words clear as crystal, and his stance firm and\n&gt; resolved. Legacy pointedly glanced at Straight Shot and then back at \n&gt; Tuscon,\n&gt; &quot;TO PUT OUR FUTURE IN JEOPARDY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PErceptor gain control of the ark and activate all the internal defences\n&gt; against the Hydra&#39;s predacons and tried to\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As preceptor worked, the Ark began to respond to his commands as weapons\n&gt; began to activate, internal defenses systems came online.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What is your command?&quot; Teletran 1 asked Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; MEANWHILE IN THE MEDICAL BAY:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight continue peacefully sleeping while Elita jumped on the bed in\n&gt; her beast form and nuzzled in her mom&#39;s cheek while she cried in silence.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Mommie&quot;said Elita&quot; I miss you so much... so much&quot;sobbed the little girl\n&gt; while her tears fell in her mom&#39;s cheek\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight continued to sleep, as all around her the machines registered \n&gt; her\n&gt; as resting in a comma like state. All of her systems seemed otherwise in\n&gt; stable condition.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus looked at Nightlight and Elita, a soft look on his face.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then Tuscon&#39;s voice boomed through, threatening the Predacons. &quot;SLAG!&quot;\n&gt; Ramulus said as he glanced back at Elita, &quot;You stay here.&quot; Ramulus said.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to lock you in and then go see if anything can be done for our\n&gt; medical staff.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus spoke as he quickly gathered up a few med packs and a scanner.\n&gt; &quot;Danged daft Predacons, causing so much damage.&quot; Ramulus grumbled under \n&gt; his\n&gt; breath. Ramulus was no medic, but he did know a bit about first aid. \n&gt; Perhaps\n&gt; there was something he could so for Santon and Bump who were still lying \n&gt; on\n&gt; the floor of the corridors. Perhaps they were not as . . . hurt as they\n&gt; looked. He couldn&#39;t even bring himself to think of them as dead.\n&gt;\n&gt; With a last look at Elita he left. The door clicked as he locked it and \n&gt; then\n&gt; the room that Elita was in went silent except for the computer monitors \n&gt; that\n&gt; were watching over Nightlight.\n&gt;\n&gt; For the moment all was peaceful in the medbay.\n&gt;\n&gt; However outside the Ark was a very different matter!\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Windlord and Kup keep their fire against Scourge and Deepstrike\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As the firefight continues Deepstryke took a hit, as did Scourge, forcing\n&gt; them to break off their attack on the door and swing up into the air to\n&gt; avoid any further and more critical damage. Several more of the sweeps \n&gt; were\n&gt; blasted from the skies, the last one swinging up next to his master \n&gt; Scourge,\n&gt; almost as if for protection.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Predacons were looking decidedly more damaged and a bit more tired \n&gt; then\n&gt; before. Energon looked to be looking a bit lower than before and the shots\n&gt; from Windlord and Kup were building up on them, not to mention the \n&gt; firepower\n&gt; coming from the fuzors as well as Leo II! Yes, the Predacons had breached\n&gt; the door, but getting further in would be an uphill battle indeed, and \n&gt; many\n&gt; of them did not look to be in the best shape to fight it!\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Outside, Quickstride quickly gets Uproar to his feet, and\n&gt; assesses the situation. He then looks around the parameters and then\n&gt; remembers a body of goop, that resembled a tar pit, not far from the Ark&#39;s\n&gt; parameters. Uproar looks to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; *&lt;SNIP/CUT/PASTE&gt;*\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar and Quickstride now approach Deep Stryke and the others with \n&gt; &gt; their\n&gt; hands up in submission. Quickstride is the first to approach them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Deepstryke hovered in the air as he noticed the two walked towards him, \n&gt; his\n&gt; cannons swiveling to track them when they spoke . . .\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, okay, you got us, you got us. Why don&#39;t we just show you guys an\n&gt; easy way inta the ark hmm? That way we all get what we want and everyone&#39;s\n&gt; happy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You, a Maximal would show a Predacon a way into his own fortress?&quot;\n&gt; Deepstryke said, obviously not believing the two for a moment, and yet he\n&gt; didn&#39;t shoot at them either. Perhaps there was a part of him that WANTED \n&gt; to\n&gt; believe it. Then Hydras&#39; call went out to retreat!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Blast you Maximal!&quot; Deepstryke said as he began to pull back. &quot;NEXT TIME \n&gt; we\n&gt; will breach your walls and TAKE what we want!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Predacons began to back up, moving into the air, slowly moving away \n&gt; from\n&gt; the Ark, even as the Ark&#39;s cannons and weaponry began to move and come\n&gt; online.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
