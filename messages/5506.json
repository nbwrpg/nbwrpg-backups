She\n&gt;jumps out of the pile of fruit and starts smashing the fruit and punching \n&gt;it\n&gt;going crazy punching the tree and pants and sits on the ground panting\n&gt;paying no attention to the sharp stick thats sticking through her stomich*\n&gt;Stingtra: Having any luck with the fish? *She says to Quickstrike while\n&gt;panting*\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Saturday, July 01, 2000 8:06 PM\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike threw his large claw into the water, going for a fish. He\n&gt; &gt; grumbled as he saw it zip away. He had his tail up high, and targeting. \n&gt;He\n&gt; &gt; swayed it left and right, watching a handful of fish near-by his \n&gt;boulder.\n&gt;He\n&gt; &gt; tail hissed in frustration, having no luck.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He plunged his claw down again, and the fish scattered. He cursed in the\n&gt; &gt; Predacon language. He was so hungry. He watched after a few moments as \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; fish returned. He leaned his body closer over the edge of the boulder,\n&gt; &gt; targeting percisely. He plunged his tail down into the water. He felt\n&gt; &gt; something in between the jaws of his tail. He pulled his tail up and \n&gt;found\n&gt; &gt; out that he had a catch.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He laughed and snapped his claws in victory. &quot;Ah got one!&quot; he called \n&gt;out.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ah got one!&quot; He turned his body to the side and threw the fish from his\n&gt; &gt; tail, to the shore. It was already limp.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He looked back down into the waters. He targeted his tail, and tried\n&gt;again.\n&gt; &gt; One wasn&#39;t going to enough for him.\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Conference Calling with Firetalk!\n&gt; &gt; Click Here!\n&gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5480/13/_/_/_/962496375/\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
