Her body wasn&#39;t responding like normal. \nSome of her circuits were shorting out and she couldn&#39;t see except \nfor blurred images. Everything looked like it was in a supper thick \nfog.  She turned her head up and sniffed the air. Her audio sensors \ntold her that she was being followed. She could tell it was the preds \nshe had encountered moments ago.  She started running again in the \noppossite direction.  \n\nShe kept going, not knowing where she was headed.  She knew she was \nrunning up hill, then down hill, then back up hill.  Off in the \ndistance, she thought she heard was sounded like thunder. She sniffed \nthe air as she ran and could smell the scent of water. A water fall \nwas near by. With luck, she could get tot he bottom of the water fall \nand loose them in the mists. She stayed on her course and hoped she&#39;d \nmake it. \n\n\n\n"}}
