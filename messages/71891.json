But too far out of the box could get them all killed. And there\nwas still the matter of TUSCON&#39;s anger.\n\nYes, LEO PRIME still continued to watch TUSCON&#39;s way of commanding,\nhoping that he would prove to be the leader the Maximals needed.\nMeanwhile he still kept the call out for all Maximals to return to the\nark, there were other groups out there still returning.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
