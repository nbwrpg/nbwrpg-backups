Made true by transformer \ntechnology. I feed on energon, and need a fresh supply to keep me in \nworking order. I don&#39;t know if pure energon will do, my creators \nnever tested it on me, I was made to kill. Another thing about \nvampire&#39;s, they aren&#39;t alive, it&#39;s just a dead body. That&#39;s what I \nam, a dead body. I have no spark. Which is why I need Transformer \njuice to live. I hate it, I have never liked feeding on other \nTransformers, and I wish I could find a way to change me. Well, there \nit is, I&#39;ve never told anyone, and now I have.
