The \n&gt; eight of us are all that is left.  Alone we will not be able to \nthrive as a \n&gt; faction, so we need alignments.  We chose your group because you \nare a large \n&gt; and powerful faction, and i know of how you grew from a small group \nof \n&gt; breakaway predacons to the great power you are now.  This has \ninspired me. If \n&gt; i want someone helping me and my team out on the battlefield, id \nlike someone \n&gt; reliable like yourselves.\n\n\n"}}
