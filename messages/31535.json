Since when did a Predacon just want to talk?\n&gt; She crossed her arms and growled.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Megatron, have you ever heard of the two words &#39; Bite Me&#39;? If you wanted \n&gt; to be pleasent you&#39;d be here in person, so stop folling around and either \n&gt; get to the point or get lost.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Those were her words and she was sticking to them.\n&gt; She glaced at Epyon before looking back to the screen, sensing things\n&gt; brewing outside.\n&gt; &lt; What&#39;s the status outside?&gt; she asked Prowl, giving him a visual hint of \n&gt; what was happening in the controle room.\n&gt; It had been a while since they just talked because they felt like it.\n&gt; Something was always going on and they never had any time anymore.*\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
