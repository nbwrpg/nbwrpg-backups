Still puzzled at how they can \nbe \n&gt; entertained so easily.\n&gt; But, she guessed that that was just the way that these two were.\n&gt; If all men were like that, slag help them all.\n&gt; But these too looked simple minded.\n&gt; \n&gt; But ever so fainly, as Reptilica pointed down the wron g direction \nand was \n&gt; rudly corrected bt Bloodystrike, she wondered if the Maximals were \never this \n&gt; stupid?\n&gt; None of them seemed like it, in fact, they all seemed to be rather \nclever. \n&gt; But then why were they losing this war?\n&gt; Their kind ways, which is basically weak not only in her own views, \nbut \n&gt; everyone elses.\n&gt; Hmm...but some of the Maximals soldiers didn&#39;t seem so peaceful.\n&gt; Like the reptilien warrior she had seen back in that clearing, the \n&gt; transmetal 2 which she had sensed held the mech fluid she kept \nhungering \n&gt; for.\n&gt; But it was the first time she had ever sensed fluid so strong \nbefore, not \n&gt; even knowing until now that it existed.\n&gt; Desmonus&#39; stomach growled at the thought, hissing through her teeth.\n&gt; She would have that fluid, but first she would have to get the bot \nwho it \n&gt; belonged to.\n&gt; Perhaps reprogram him into an Alliance member, so that he would \nalways be \n&gt; around when hunger struck.\n&gt; But unlike these two, she would not have to give any sense of \nprimitive \n&gt; pleasure just to feed, she could just take it.\n&gt; Desmonus smiled, she liked that idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Desmonus suddenly shook her head to clear it, feeling Reptilica \ntrying to \n&gt; slip an arm around her, hissing but allowing him to do so.\n&gt; Mostly annoyed at breaking her train of thought.\n&gt; Then Bloodystrike trying to slip his arm around her as well.\n&gt; But she put on a smile.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yesss, we shall. But...a question while we walk: I saw a \nTransmetal 2 in a \n&gt; clearing once, batting against one of our soldiers, Oblitertron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * In order to capture and perhaps reprogram that bot, she might as \nwell \n&gt; learn his name.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hmm...silver armor, hard, mean features. Reptiliean, skilled. \nWhat is his \n&gt; name...if you know?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
