Why am I \n&gt; here?&quot; She had to think about it.  SInce she was reprogrammed, she \n&gt; had no idea why she even existed.  Her original boards were removed \n&gt; and with it, her mission assignments and logs. She looked at \nLadyHawk \n&gt; with a dishearted look.  &quot;I...I don&#39;t know.&quot;  She turned and looked \n&gt; back at her papers. She had the feeling of being alone all of a \n&gt; sudden.  She didn&#39;t know why she was here or how she even got here \nor \n&gt; what her purpose was.  She just stared at the papers in her hand \nand \n&gt; sighed.  She couldn&#39;t even come up with a good reason for her \n&gt; existants. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk knew therules of courtesy to well. Her father always \n&gt; taught her\n&gt; &gt; that there were two things you didn&#39;t argue, religion and \n&gt; philosophy. Both\n&gt; &gt; were subjects that held strong beliefs and a debate couldn&#39;t be \nwon \n&gt; either\n&gt; &gt; way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She checked the results of the cell sample from the new bot \n&gt; (Nighteyes) and\n&gt; &gt; wondered about the possibilities it could bring. (What was \n&gt; Nighteyes again?)\n&gt; &gt; Another successful aquisition of DNA. She was getting enough \n&gt; samples for her\n&gt; &gt; father it would soon be time to return with her prize. the only \n&gt; problem\n&gt; &gt; would be to lose her shadow. Or convince her to tag along with \n&gt; her. &quot;If we\n&gt; &gt; can divide the DNA samples in a bot then why not thier conversion \n&gt; chips as\n&gt; &gt; well?&quot; She pondered the moment. &quot;If a Maximal chip turns a \n&gt; protoform into a\n&gt; &gt; Maximal and a Predacon chip turns it into a Predacon then there \n&gt; should be a\n&gt; &gt; way to splice the chips together so that there isn&#39;t a \n&gt; distinction.&quot; The\n&gt; &gt; hawkbot stared at the results more intently.  She stood wondering \n&gt; just how\n&gt; &gt; to ask the question so Squizzy would think that it&#39;s idle \n&gt; conversation\n&gt; &gt; instead of possible desertion. &quot;I&#39;m here because I need a place \nto \n&gt; work.\n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s your reason?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, October 23, 2000 6:35 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: hawk and (mon)goose.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She nodded and checked the bot in the CR.  She pressed a few \n&gt; buttons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the Chamber extracted a few cells off the bot.

But then again, don&#39;t you think the Matrix \nhad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this planned out long ago? In order to have balance, the matrix\n&gt; &gt; &gt; created both Autobot and Decepticon.  Maximal and Predacon.  \nThis \n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to have happened for a reason. But what that reason is, I am not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sure.&quot;  She went back to corner of the room as started looking \nat \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paper work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lady Hawk took it for granted that Squizzy would understand. \nTwo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; facts were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relevant to her. &quot;Predacons fight because they are programmed \nas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warriors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals fight because Predacons exist.&quot; She tried to explain \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; source of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her beliefs but found it hard to put into words without \n&gt; instegating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions. &quot;I&#39;ll take you somewhere where I can make it more \n&gt; clear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometime. &quot; she said trying to change the subject. &quot;I have \nwork \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do, If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you wish to assist me you can bring me a sample of this new \nbots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; DNA&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
