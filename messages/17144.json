I just realized I&#39;ve been writing Soundwave instead of Smokescreen on \noccations. I just cought myself making that mistake. So, when I type \nSoundwave, I mean Smokescreen.\n\nSorry about that, Alloran, and thanx for bringing it to my attention.\n\n::Ramulus::\n\nRamulus nods, smiling at the others&#39; enthusiasm. He looks at Firearm. &quot;You \ngot the cloaking devices?&quot;\n\nFirearm nods in responce, producing a dozen cloaking devices from various \ncompartments. Near him, Proto also takes out a few, the two bots putting the \ndevices on the table. Ramulus takes one, snapping it onto his hip. He flips a \nswitch to test it, dissapearing and then reapearing in a few seconds as he \ndeactivates it.\n\n&quot;Good,&quot; he says, &quot;Everyone take one, all of us, except for me, will be \ncloaked.&quot;\n\nHe looks around at the bots. &quot;Is this all of us then?&quot;\n\n"}}
