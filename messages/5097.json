She could see that Stringtra like Quickstrike.  It\n&gt; was as plain as day.  She had Cheetor by the shoulders.\n&gt; &quot;You going to get the feet or is he going to help carry this bot.&quot;\n&gt; She looked at Quickstrike. &quot;I&#39;d let us carry him.  Your foot doesn&#39;t look\n&gt; all that great.  You&#39;d be better off just carrying yourself back to your\n&gt; base.  We can carry this one.&quot;\n&gt; She readjusted her grip on Cheetors shoulder.\n&gt; &quot;Well, let&#39;s get going before stuff happens again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------Original Message------------\n&gt; From: ilovealllizards  &lt;ilovealllizards@p...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wed Jun 28, 2000 11:23pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Stingtra: Alright. But if your foot hurts then I&#39;ll take one side of the\n&gt; Maxi and KitKat could take the other side and you could get up on my\n&gt; shoulders. *Stingtra walks over to Quickstrike* Stingtra: Remember, the\n&gt; roads always open.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Need a credit card?\n&gt; Instant Approval and 0% intro APR with Aria!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6034/13/_/_/_/962234872/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
