If QUICK=\r\nSTRIDE wanted to&lt;br&gt;leave there was a secondary door for that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Final=\r\nly LEO turned to TUSCON as he folded his arms behind his back.&lt;br&gt;TUSCON wa=\r\ns larger than LEO, and yet there was no fear in LEO&#39;s optics&lt;br&gt;as he caref=\r\nully examined him, noting the changes that have occured&lt;br&gt;because of his n=\r\new beast mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Undermine you?&quot; LEO PRIME said finally, his voice ne=\r\nutral and yet a&lt;br&gt;curious lilt to it. &quot;You allowed your subordinates, your=\r\n family as you&lt;br&gt;say, to intentionally try to harm another Maximal or Auto=\r\nbot.&quot; He&lt;br&gt;paused as he shifted his gaze to the map of the jungle scene fo=\r\nr a&lt;br&gt;moment. &quot;Under normal circumstances that would be automatic&lt;br&gt;disci=\r\nplinary action.
