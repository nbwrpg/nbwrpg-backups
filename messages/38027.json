Camera zooms in \nover the Bridge from left to right.  You see sitting at a computer a red \nbot.  Standing behind this red bot is a short female bot looking over the \nred bot&#39;s shoulder.  In the middle seat, or as some might call it the \ncommand chair, is a character you might remember.  If you already guessed, \nit&#39;s Hedge.  Then sitting next to the right of Hedge, at the flight control \nis a bot with what looks like scales.  Suddenly the door opens and in walks \na bulky bot.  He has a grey tent to him.\n\n  &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m late.&quot; says Sniper (A character of mine from way back when.)\n\n  &quot;You are 5 minutes late, explain yourself.&quot;  Hedge says with a serious \ntone.\n\n  &quot;My alarm clock didn&#39;t work.&quot;  Sniper says.\n\n  Hedge glares at Sniper, &quot;That is no excuse.&quot;\n\n  &quot;I am sorry.&quot;  says Sniper.\n\n  &quot;Get to your command post and order Ostick and Thug-bot up here.&quot; Hedge \nsays.\n\n  &quot;But they are on their break.&quot; Sniper snaps back.\n\n  Hedge stands up and Slap&#39;s the stuffing out of Sniper&#39;s Mouth, &quot;I said, \nOrder than up here.&quot;\n\n  &quot;Yes ma&#39;m.&quot; Sniper says as he goes to his command post.  He turns on his \ncomm system.  &quot;Will Ostick and Thug-bot please report to the bridge.&quot;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
