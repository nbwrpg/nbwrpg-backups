And evidently it&#39;s\n&gt; either destroyed or your characters can&#39;t get to it.  So you bring in a\nTM4\n&gt; driver?  Excuse me if I scoff a little!\n&gt;     This is getting ridiculous, and out of hand.  First the magical\ndriver,\n&gt; then the magical speaking with the Matrix and Oracle and such, and now\nthis\n&gt; crap.  Believe me, I&#39;m not going to let that driver be legal.  Your\n&gt; characters finding all the super powerful stuff, is not fair.  And having\n&gt; them just appear, is also unfair.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Unitron\n&gt; KSLawDogg@...\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Shoes?
