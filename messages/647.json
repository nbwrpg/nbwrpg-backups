Tavatron picked her target,\n&gt; BrightBlade!\n&gt;\n&gt; She let loose a wild hunting howl and fired her optic lasers at\nBrightBlade.\n&gt; It was long range, so her aim was slightly off, but hopefully she&#39;d get a\n&gt; piece of her.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tav took cover behind a nearby boulder, the rain of weapons fire was too\n&gt; much to risk staying in the open. Tav systematically fired her optic\nlasers\n&gt; at BrightBlade, incase the first shot hadn&#39;t connected.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *--- FREE VOICEMAIL FOR YOUR HOME PHONE! ---*\n&gt; With eVoice Now you can keep in touch with clients, vendors, co-workers,\n&gt; friends and family ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.
