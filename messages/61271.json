Yes sir!  Malice and I decided that it\n&gt; &gt; might be a good idea \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to have a back plan to the cannon already in\n&gt; &gt; construction.  We plan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to use a high mass object and collapse it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; gravity, turning it \n&gt; &gt; into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a black hole.  We wanted to launch it in an area\n&gt; &gt; of spatial \n&gt; &gt; &gt; instability.  Once the black hole had served\n&gt; it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; purpose, we \n&gt; &gt; planned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to open a time rift and send it through.  The\n&gt; rift\n&gt; &gt; should \n&gt; &gt; neutralize \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the intense gravity, expanding it to original\n&gt; &gt; size.
