To him Restoration was more than=\r\n just restoring artifacts, making them appear and work like new, it was als=\r\no about restoring old programming and recovery of important data. He did no=\r\nt know the extent of the corruption upon which was placed on Rodimus but he=\r\n knew he couldn&#39;t just throw in the towel on his leader. Autobots stuck tog=\r\nether, and through thick and thin, he&#39;d keep his pledge to never abandon hi=\r\ns fellow Autobots. He also realized that if he was going to get anywhere, h=\r\ne&#39;d have to do it himself. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;On second thought, I think I&#39;ll go this o=\r\nne alone. Don&#39;t wait up for me, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back too soon.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nHe bids Kenzo good bye and walks out of the room. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh before I forget=\r\n, have the CR chamber prepared for Rodimus. He&#39;ll need it more than me.&quot; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; He was dead set on recovering his leader. And this time, nothing and no=\r\n one would get in his way of achieving his mission. He sends one final mess=\r\nage to Lord Perseus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lord Perseus, it&#39;s come to my attention that my =\r\nleader, Rodimus Prime, has been abducted and altered severely. This puts th=\r\ne Matrix of Leadership at a grave Risk, but most of all, his spark, which I=\r\n believe is too precious to waste for evil purposes. I can not abandon my l=\r\neader, not even in his corruptive state. I hereby announce that I am on rou=\r\nte to locating my leader, and I DO intend to BRING HIM BACK. Hopefully, the=\r\n damage can be reversed. If not, there is question of the well being of the=\r\n Matrix. I must recover it, perhaps not for my own personal gain, but for t=\r\nhe benefit of Autobot kind. It&#39;s too precious to lose to the hands of those=\r\n who thirst for power and greed. I swear by Primus&#39;s name, I will return, b=\r\nut my return may not be a fast one. May Primus guide you as he guides me. T=\r\nhis is Tucson, signing off. I will report to you again, once I know more of=\r\n the condition of my leader.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He signs off, gets off the ship, and tra=\r\nnsforms into SUV mode, hoping to find Rodimus via his sonar systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nag: Kraftlos and Cyclonus.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
