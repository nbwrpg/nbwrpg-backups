He \nactivated a\n&gt; holo projector. There was a holo picture of Optimus Prime, Ultra \nMagnus,\n&gt; Springer, ArrCee, Gold Bug, Kup, and other Autobots, Aerialbots, \nand the\n&gt; Dinobots, as well as himself. Tears of oil, and other mech fluids\n&gt; appeared in his eyes, and ran down his cheek. It had been a long \ntime\n&gt; since he had looked at this, and saw his old friends. Many were\n&gt; perminetly offline, or retired. These were the bots and friends \nthat he\n&gt; searved with, for millions of years. He clicked a switch, and a \nlarge\n&gt; pic of Optimus Prime appeared. Hot Rod put his head in his hands, \nand\n&gt; looked at the pic. He began talking in a wisper, to his former \nmentor,\n&gt; teacher, and dearest friend.\n&gt; &quot;Hello, Optimus. It&#39;s been a long time.&quot; He went on for two hours,\n&gt; before going to the CR room for a recharge. He looked for Feline.\n&gt; &quot;Hello? Honey?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
