She showed all the scars \naround the symbol. &quot;I wasn&#39;t always a maximal.&quot; she stood up.\n&quot;I was a predacon.  I was with predacons on the ledge that night I \nfell.  We were trying to break into a maximal information bank.  It \nwas maximals that fired on me and my friends.  I got into a fight and \nleft for dead by my predacon friends.  I was rescued and saved by a \nbot, whom I never saw.  I knew that I could never be a pred again.  I \nchanged and became a maximal.  I cut out the pred symbol from my arm \nand put on a maximal insignia.&quot; She turned her back to him.\n&quot;That&#39;s why I went bollistic in the hostage situation.  I can&#39;t stand \npreds. I hate them down to my very core.&quot; She turned and looked at \nStriker. &quot;Ramulus knows for I told him all this already.  He was able \nto see past my past and still accept me.
