Same as \nshe would do if danger was close, just stick to mommy�s side.\nShe couldn�t see but in a few days here eyes would open but without food she \nwouldn�t last that long. Even the jerky movements of her body were getting \nweaker and her whining was getting more common too.\nAll her little heart desired was warm milk in her tummy and the warmth of \nmommy�s side. But all she got was the warmth of a strangers arms and hunger \npains.\nThe baby yipped a bit when Starice got up to get the milk bottles, surprised \nby the sudden movement and cuddling into her arms to try and stay warm and \nsafe.\nShe wasn�t use to all this moving and it was confusing her more but it would \nbe worth it since Starice was going to make her tummy pains go away, she was \njust too young to know that right now.\nHer thinking patterns were primitive but that was just because she was so \nyoung, when she grew up more her thoughts would be more complex and \ndetailed. But all she knew now was that she was hungry.\nBy now Starice had already shown her to Epyon and for some reason she could \nsmell milk but it wasn�t too much like mommy�s. And she was out of Starice�s \narms now too so there was the smell of milk but now warm side where it \nshould come from.\nHaving no energy to move the baby just stayed there and whined, feeling cold \neven though milk smelled close. Her whining got louder when her tummy \nrumbled because, by now, her body was warning her that if she didn�t eat \nfood soon it would give out on her.\nBut She was suddenly picked up and it confused and scared her, making her \nwhine more before she suddenly smelled something very close to her that \nsmelled like�like�, her mouth found the end of the bottle before her nose \ndid and the fist thing she did was open her tiny mouth and start to suckle.\nA little of the milk leaked out of her mouth and ran down her fuzzy cheek, \nputting her itty paws at the sides of the bottle, even though it didn�t feel \nlike mommy�s side and didn�t taste like her milk. But she was SO hungry.\nThe baby ate with greed, suckling and feeling the milk coat her stomach, \nmaking little sounds that a suckling baby would when they eat.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
