Her optics narrowed.

The one hand stationary. Her optics \nwent down \n&gt; to her hand in his, then her optics went up to his. Curious why \nthey were \n&gt; still holding hands. &#39;Such rubblish,&#39; she thought. But, in some \nother ways, \n&gt; she didn&#39;t mind. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then her optics went back to the map as she continued to take in \nthe \n&gt; locations.\n\n\n"}}
