I&#39;ve deceided to \nkeep rping with Pacifix, Lynxiz, Switchblade, and Astrotrain. (maybe \nCrossroads as well).\n\n   Azure, were you the last one to have characters who interacted \nwith Pacifix? I&#39;d like to know where Jer left him. Also, if anything \nhappened to the decepticons that i didn&#39;t hear about i&#39;d like to \nknow about that as well. Last I can remember, everything was at a \nstandstill. I&#39;ve got a solution to the problem, and i was wondering \nif any decepitcons would mind. \n\n   Solution: As Switchblade will, while &quot;fixing&quot; megatron, \ndisconnect his vocal abilities, and remove has ability to do \nanything except stay in pistol mode, and thus can only be used by \nanother (Switchblade or, maybe Switchblade&#39;ll add Megs pistol onto \nFirestrike... hmmm). Soundwave will then have finished fixing \nFirestrike, and have both him and Nightstrike (and anyone else who \nis willing to follow Switchblade) dispatch any loyal followers of \nMegatron (ie. Soundwave, Laserbeak, Spasstik, Rumble, Frenzy, \nStunticons, and anybody else that i might have missed, unless they \nagree to join Switchblade). \n\n   Then the decepticons will either need a leader, or join the NDE \nwith the Dark Avian. If anyone wants any of the characters that will \nprobably end up dying/coldstorage, speak up now.\n\n   I&#39;m also going to have to lighten the weight of the Autobots. \nThat means i&#39;ll have to drop Swoop, The Technobots (i like em, just \nfound i didn&#39;t like rping them), and maybe Crossroads. Haven&#39;t \nfigured out how i&#39;m going to do that, but it&#39;ll come to me \neventually. \n\n   Anyone have any suggestions for stowing away my excess Chivitrons?\n\n\n"}}
