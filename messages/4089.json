And he\n&gt;knew how he would get in. But he hopes they don&#39;t detect him. This\n&gt;signal masker only has a few cycles left of energy. He finds the air\n&gt;vent, opens it up and starts crawling through, putting the vent back\n&gt;in place. Being a Predacon, he could normally just enter the base.\n&gt;But Hell Beast would see his new body and would start asking\n&gt;questions. Questions he didn&#39;t want to answer. Besides, he wouldn&#39;t\n&gt;be a Predacon for much longer.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Acording to my scanners, the machine is right here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Vulois opens up the vent which leads into Scorponok&#39;s lab. On one of\n&gt;the table&#39;s he sees a box with a big button on it.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Yes. With this box I can whipe DarkMouse&#39;s program and re-program\n&gt;her to serve myself and Soundwave! I will make her a TM3 and she will\n&gt;aide us in the ruling of Cybertron!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Just then his internal computer talked to him.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Signal Masker has gone offline.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Oh Crap! Now he&#39;s gotta get out of here. The Preds can see his\n&gt;signature. He hopes he won&#39;t encounter any on the way out.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
