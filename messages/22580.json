He walks out of his room.\n\n&quot;Everyone, follow me,&quot; he says into his internal communication system \nwith his team. Doors opened, his team walking out. At the council \ndoor, Scyther turns around, cloaked as he makes his way toward \nKillfest.\n\nSeveral moments later, Killfest enters the CR room, just in time to \nhear the exchange between Megatron and Drillbit.EndBringer, Greven, \nand Demise walk in behind him. All four dwarfed the other Predacons \nin the room. Killfest narrows his eyes as he looks at KitKat.\n\n&quot;I just spoke to her,&quot; he says, &quot;I am to take command of the Predacon \nforces, by her orders.&quot;\n\nThe three bots stood behind him, ready to tear anyone who disagreed \nto pieces.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCloaked, Scyther silently enters the CR room, looking at Killfest, \nknowing that no one could see or detect him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Megatron entered the room to see Kitkat die, and then \nDrillbit whine \n&gt; over it. That was not the Predacon way...\n&gt;        &quot;I shall now assume complete control over the predacon \nforces within \n&gt; this base, as the next highest ranking officer it is my duty and \nprivilage. \n&gt; Waspinator, move the body into a burial pod. We will leave cargo \nbay 5 open \n&gt; for the mourners. Now, Hell Beast and i shall go to the bridge to \nmake some \n&gt; needed changes.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
