Besides, she had no idea what Plintissa was talking about when she said that she had her own group, obviously a bunch of renegades and no mads.\nBut then she looked down at Plintissa, the expression on her face clearly saying that she wasn&#39;t convinced.*\n\n&quot; No. If you have something to say then you can say it here.&quot;\n\n* She wasn&#39;t in the mood to argue about whether or not they were going into the base and she was also on the verge of just leaving and returning to the War room.\nIron Raptor knew that Plintissa was her friend, or that was how it seemed. But even with that she wasn&#39;t about to let her into the base, it would be a violation of the codes of order. And she for one was going to obey them.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
