One more comment, just on\n&gt;autobots generaly: be careful to follow the strength and size limits\n&gt;and everything. Read the rules for more info.\n&gt;\n&gt;::Prowl::\n&gt;\n&gt;Prowl raises an eyebrow, having no idea how this new bot knew who he\n&gt;was. As far as Prowl could remember, he had never seen this bot in his\n&gt;life, but he knew who Optimus Prime was, and the fact that this\n&gt;transformer used to be him, and was still an Autobot, was a good sign.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Um, ok. I think you picked kinda a bad place to tour this planet,\n&gt;though, there&#39;s a war going on.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Scorpius (No last name)&quot; &lt;scorpiusis@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The new transformer looks at Prowl, something about his name makes him\n&gt; &gt; think. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you again Prowl, the name&#39;s Optimal Prime,\n&gt;I use to\n&gt; &gt; be Optimus Prime but I was rebuilt like this after a transwarp\n&gt;explosion.\n&gt; &gt; The wave even affected the matrix shell. And just so you know, I&#39;m\n&gt;still an\n&gt; &gt; Autobot,&quot; he informs Prowl.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
