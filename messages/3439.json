She landed on a small patch of \nunscorched grass.  She looked up and saw the sky, heavy with smoke.  She \njust lay there, her gun in her hand.  She felt no pain.  No pain.  She \nwanted to just pass on to the other side.  She felt it call her.  THe soft \nvoice of the Matrix called to her.  But she felt something inside say that \nnow was not her time.  Not now it was not her time.  She closed her optics \nand saught strength in herself to move.  She opened her optics and slowly, \nvery slowly rose to her knees.  Then she rose to her feet.  She aimed her \ngun at Bumblebee and fired.*\n\n&quot;Today, I shall be a Maximal.&quot;\n\n*She kept on firing.  She knew not where this renewed strength came from, \nbut she was glad to have it.*\n\n-----Original Message-------\n&gt;From: KSLawdogg@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: NeO bEaSt WaRs RpG\n&gt;Date: Fri, 16 Jun 2000 01:48:37 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;Manterror/Injector/Bumblebee:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Manterror got up slowly, shots from Ramulus sending him flying through the\n&gt;air backwards, smashing into a boulder, rolling over it and landing behind \n&gt;it.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Injector fired two stinger missiles at Ramulus&#39; torso.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Bumblebee smiled, firing an optic blast at Dark Mouse, firing two stinger\n&gt;missiles from each launcher (four in all) at the tree Striker was hiding\n&gt;behind.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
