He looked kind of down all of a sudden to \nher.  She walked over and put a hand on his shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I \ndidn&#39;t mean to bite your head off.  It&#39;s just that I&#39;m a warrior by \nprogram and by code. I have to stand up for my leader, and that is \nMegatron at the moment.  You see, if the chain of command breaks, the \nwhole chainm goes down.  So that is why one has to stand by their \nleader, no matter what.&quot; She smiled warmly and him  &quot;Now let&#39;s come u \nwith a way to get those plans.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; DrillBit was about to defend himself to KitKat, when he thought \nbetter\n&gt; of it.
