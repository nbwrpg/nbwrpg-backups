Stronghold reached out to g=\r\nrab Stranato but he cartwheeled out of the way.\n\n                          =\r\n  &quot;We left that idiot Arrow in your CR Chamber, Plintissa.&quot; Stronghold said=\r\n.\n\n                            &quot;WHAT!?&quot; Stranato yelled.\n\n                 =\r\n           &quot;It&#39;s my base, and Arrow is welcome to be repaired there and so =\r\nare the other former Radicons!&quot; Plintissa yelled.\n\n                        =\r\n    The Radicons nodded and walked on, Stranato grumbled out something that=\r\n none of them, could understand. Airbomber seen them and waved to them. The=\r\n People&#39;s Base&#39;s secret passageway was in the nearby swamp.\n\n              =\r\n              &quot;Get ready!&quot; Train Wreck said to Airbomber.\n\n                =\r\n            &quot;What about this guy?&quot; Airbomber asked.\n\n                      =\r\n      &quot;Never mind him.&quot; Train Wreck said. Airbomber drug Drazom out of the =\r\nwater and ushered him to come along while he walked with his comrades.\n\n   =\r\n                         Dracona was getting furious, and so was Gangon.\n\n =\r\n                           &quot;Sorry Gangon, I did all I could, maybe BrightBl=\r\nade will still show up anyway.&quot; Dracona said. Gangon waited while Dracona f=\r\nlew away.\n\n                            &quot;Hey! Wait! You forgot to untie meee=\r\nee!&quot; Gangon screamed.\n\n                            Dracona didn&#39;t hear and =\r\nlanded next to the People&#39;s Group members. The Radicons, Plintissa, Dracona=\r\n, and Artist all entered the Poeple&#39;s base through the secret passage way, =\r\nthe computer reconizing them as friends. Train Wreck and Airbomber stepped =\r\ninto a door.\n\n                            &quot;Hey, Stranato, look at this! It&#39;=\r\ns amazing!&quot; Train Wreck called out. Arrow steps out of the CR Chamber all h=\r\nealed up.\n\n                            &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s got lots of beer and cig=\r\nars in here, too! and it&#39;s big enough to put a table in to play cards! How =\r\ncome we never noticed this room before?&quot; Airbomber said. Stranato walked in=\r\nto the room. Stronghold and Blender followed.\n\n                            =\r\n&quot;Wait up guys!&quot; Arrow called out, running into the room. Plintissa sealed t=\r\nhe door magnetically upon order from Train Wreck, the Radicons were locked =\r\ninside the room to sort out their problems. There was alot of banging, but =\r\nit eventually stopped. Alot of name calling, too. Plintissa laughed and sat=\r\n down at a table to play cards with Dracona.\n\n                            &quot;=\r\nOh, man! Not even a drop of beer in here! We&#39;ll dehydrate drinking water!&quot; =\r\nStronghold said.\n\n                            &quot;What are we going to do? Not=\r\nhing to smoke!&quot; Blender said.\n\n                            &quot;I have more nee=\r\nds than all of you idiots put together! I&#39;m getting fat and need to exercis=\r\ne!&quot; Stranato yelled.\n\n                            &quot;How come we can&#39;t all ge=\r\nt along! I don&#39;t like it in here neither!&quot; Arrow said. Stranato looked at h=\r\nim like he was going to kill him. Arrow cowered in the corner.\n\n           =\r\n                 &quot;You see? That&#39;s why you fail, Arrow, you don&#39;t stand up a=\r\ngainst Stranato and his stupid rules! This was our idea!&quot; Train Wreck yelle=\r\nd.\n\n                            &quot;Yeah, and nobody is getting out of here un=\r\ntil we are all friends again.&quot; Airbomber said.\n\n                           =\r\n Stranato sighed in disapointment. Arrow stood up again, and started pacing=\r\n the room. Stronghold and Blender started to look in cracks in the wall for=\r\n something to drink, despite plenty of water in this room. Train Wreck was =\r\ndiscussing something with Arrow and Airbomber, and Stronghold and Blender j=\r\noined them before long.\n\n                            &quot;Say, you guys, it&#39;s r=\r\neally lonely sitting here with nothing to do, and--&quot;\n\n                     =\r\n       &quot;Shut up and get your ass over here! Of course you can join us!&quot; Arr=\r\now said, cutting off Stranato. Stranato walks over and sits with them. Stro=\r\nnghold pulls out a pack of playing cards.\n\n                            Plin=\r\ntissa and Dracona smile to each other and walk up and out of the secret pas=\r\nsgeway, taking a walk across a field...\n\n----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n-----------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0271_01BFE256.8FDDB600\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2919.6307&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Umm, all of the res=\r\nt, but watch out for what Arrow, Blender, \nand Srronghold say, they aren&#39;t =\r\nvery normal.&quot; Stranato said.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&quot;My turn!&quot; Train Wreck said.
