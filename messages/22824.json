She nodded. He was right. \nShe straightened up her shoulders. She tried to sound more confident, \neven though she was scared out of her fur. &quot;When we land, I&#39;ll talk \nto the leader and introduce ourselves.&quot; She just hoped her shaking \nwasn&#39;t so visible.  \n\nShe was trying to develope a plan of action, but it wasn&#39;t easy since \nshe didn&#39;t know how the other bots would react. She looked out the \nwindow. &quot;We&#39;re almost there. Lunarpine,&quot; tring to make her voice have \na little more authority to it, but not by much,&quot; Call up the base and \nrequest permission to land.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Razor Claw was bewildered by the prospect that the leader was \nlooking \n&gt; for advice. &quot;Whatever you command is our task to perform.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine laughed. &quot;Don&#39;t look at me. You&#39;re in charge. Hewas \nhopeing \n&gt; she&#39;d take charge and instruct them, instead she&#39;d dropped the \nball. \n&gt; He thought to her, &quot;Take charge, you have to be strong in front of \n&gt; your troops.&quot; He knew her well enough to tell that it was just \nnerves \n&gt; that held her back. Razor Claw didn&#39;t know her as well and the \n&gt; Predacons frown upon a leader that has to ask for advice.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
