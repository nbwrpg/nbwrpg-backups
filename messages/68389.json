The true Megatron was changed into Galvatron centuries\n&gt; ago. Galvatron was merged with the Predacon terrorist Megatron to\n&gt; form Hydras. So you see Hydras is the true leader of both Decepticons\n&gt; and Predacons.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Zarak was almost making himself sick talking up Hydras like this.\n&gt; He knew that eventually they would all bow to the Generation 2\n&gt; Decepticon Empire.
