The Brotherhood \nalready \n&gt; retreated back towards their base.  They&#39;re not close enough to \nfire upon \n&gt; targets or be fired upon themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; The fact of the matter, Icedemon, is Rattrap fired two shots at \nincoming \n&gt; missiles, then twenty-five shots at Unicron, all in the same post.  \nThat&#39;s a \n&gt; mode.  If he had two guns that&#39;s ok.  As for Unicron firing three \nmissiles, \n&gt; he has two weapons that can fire missiles making able to fire a \nmax. of four \n&gt; missiles.)\n&gt; \n&gt; (In other news three cheers for the Great One, THE ROCK, for \nbeating down \n&gt; Kurt Angle and become the first six time WWF championship winner in \nWWF \n&gt; history!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark Claw/The Protectobots&#92;Shockwave:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf, though big, was able to fall to his left, the incoming \nshots \n&gt; coming from Cinder and Blades go past him and head for the \nmissiles, the one \n&gt; remaining impacting with his back and almost knocking him over, but \nhe was \n&gt; relatively ok.\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning around, he raised a hand, a yellow orb with the power of a \nsmall \n&gt; grenade launching out at Endbringer. \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper turned around, a black orb forming in his hand.  The \nVok warrior \n&gt; threw the ball of energy, using his mind to prematurely make it \nexplode and \n&gt; intercept the four missiles heading for him.  He laughed, feeling \nseveral \n&gt; objects strike him but not doing any harm.  He turned, laughing at \nthe spears \n&gt; at his feet.  &quot;You&#39;ll have to do better than that he said,&quot; kicking \nat the \n&gt; spears and sending two through the air at Aqua&#39;s sternum.  Turning \nhis head \n&gt; to the left he fired off fifteen rapid optic blasts at EndBringer.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw detected a large object heading for him.  His first \nthought was it \n&gt; was some huge missile, but he detected the signature of a Maximal.  \nDeciding \n&gt; not to wait to find out what it was exactly, he started up his \nengines and \n&gt; drove forward at top speed, a missile striking him (From Jen&#39;s \nchar.) and \n&gt; making a slight crater in his armor but nothing to serious.  One \nmissile port \n&gt; in his attack vehicle mode targeted the CF and launched two \nmissiles at it.  \n&gt; \n&gt; As he continued on a welding laser struck him but didn&#39;t penetrate \nhis armor.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Spot drove at top speed, at the current speed he knew he&#39;d hit \nthat Vok \n&gt; idiot.  But the Vok warrior was moving, and was now out of his \nway!  Almost \n&gt; absentmindedly while checking in on the other Protectobots, drove \ninto three \n&gt; missiles intended for Dark Wolf.\n&gt; \n&gt; The fourth and last in the row intended for the Vok war machine had \navoided \n&gt; the large object in its path and kept on going.  The force of the \nthree \n&gt; explosions sent the fire truck flipping in Dark Wolf&#39;s general \ndirection, and \n&gt; as the missile struck the back of the Vok and doing slight damage, \nHot Spot \n&gt; slammed into the back of the tank, knocking it forward a few meters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Spot tried to transform to biped mode but it was to painful.  \nThis was \n&gt; not his week.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Groove looked to Hot Spot as he saw the crash and Flesh Ripper, and \nthen \n&gt; fired a small amount of freezing gass towards Flesh Ripper&#39;s left \nknee joint.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Blades flew over towards Hot Spot and hovered above him, making \ndeep scans to \n&gt; determine if his leader needed a CR immediately.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; First Aid saw that his welding laser didn&#39;t work, but didn&#39;t have \nmuch time \n&gt; to think on it as a missile exploded into his back from a very \nclose range, \n&gt; sending First Aid flipping forward and crashing to his feet several \nfeet from \n&gt; the source of the missile.\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Streetwise continued gaining speed, and was only a dozen meters \nfrom Demon \n&gt; Wulf, and the Vok hadn&#39;t noticed him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave watched with joy as First Aid fell.  Not quite turning \naround, he \n&gt; raised his left arm and fired off five rapid blasts, from the long \nbarrel \n&gt; that was at the end of his arm where a hand should be, at Mantle&#39;s \ntorso.\n&gt; \n&gt; Raising his right arm in which a white hand held a missile \nlauncher, the \n&gt; robot fired off two rockets from his missile launcher at the \nCybertronian \n&gt; Fire.\n\n\n"}}
