Kup mentio=\r\nned\n&gt; &#39;blockade doors&#39; in his last post, and I just wanted to be sure - are=\r\n\n&gt; those the same blockade doors as the Maximal base in the third season\n&gt; =\r\nof the show?  With the turrets and the cave?  Do the Maximals still\n&gt; use i=\r\nt as their base?  Does the surrounding area look the same, or has\n&gt; it chan=\r\nged?\n\nHello,\n\nSorry I didn&#39;t answer your question, but out of the three act=\r\nive players already here i&#39;m the newest. However I believe that none of the=\r\n factions have a base at the ark, but it is watched. So there should be lit=\r\ntle to no changes from the &#39;tune you remember, save for the battle going on=\r\n now, and the ensuing  battle scars.\n\nHowever there is a black ball of dark=\r\nness around the ark and it is difficult to get clear readings from within i=\r\nt. Strangely there is an undefined minion (Unicronian) signature coming fro=\r\nm it. \n\nI hope this helps, and perhaps Robo or Arily could fill in anything=\r\n I forgot or got wrong.\n\nPreston \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
