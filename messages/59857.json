True that you&#39;re not\n&gt; the only offender of this, but you&#39;re one of the worst\n&gt; if not the worst- I&#39;m starting to lose track of the\n&gt; number of times I haven&#39;t had a fair crack at repling\n&gt; at because the situation has been moved too far\n&gt; forward for a fair reply.
