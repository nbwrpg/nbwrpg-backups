Whoa!  Whoa!  Strider...do you have some magical powers none of us \nare aware?  First off, your post started you off in the CF.  Heh, excuse me, \nbut I&#39;d like to say that is mass moding.  Unless there&#39;s a post I missed.  \nHow did your two characters get passed the shields, blast doors, EMP cannons, \nmissile launchers, and autoguns?  \n\nThen you seemed to have messed with cameras.  I&#39;m sorry, but the cameras are \nall hidden and embedded in walls, you can&#39;t see them.  And there really isn&#39;t \na place to hide so the cameras can&#39;t see you.  It&#39;d be dumb to have cameras, \nbut leave a nice big space where they can&#39;t see like a complete would do.\n\nNext, you have codes to storage units?  Ummm...your character magically has \nthese codes to open up storage units?  That&#39;s a little hard to believe.  \nNext, you suddenly have plenty of equipment to carry all those fancy items \nout of the CF undetected?  Internal defenses would&#39;ve taken you down long \nbefore you got out.  I&#39;m going have to say your post doesn&#39;t add up, and this \nis something I would rather have Yanshosh to talk about before any action be \ntaken.\n\n\nLord Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n"}}
