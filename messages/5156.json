Inspired by the\nancient decepticon warship Nemsis she was slightly\nlarger, with four huge gun turrets mounting plasma\ncannons, four guns foward and four guns aft of the\nmassive superstructure. Her metallic grey hull gleamed\nin the glare of the space docks lights as the crew\nfinished last minute preperations for departure.\n\n Major Panzertron stood on the bridge of the warship,\nhis towering figure dominating the crew areas. The\ndrones at the controls busied themselves with the\npre-departure procedures. \n\n Panzertron thought throu his mission again and a\nsmile played across his metallic face, Hell Beast was\nin for quite a suprise.\n\n=====\nWhen the going gets tough,\nthe tough go get a tank!\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet Yahoo!
