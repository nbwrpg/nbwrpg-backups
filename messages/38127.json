He\ntransforms to full wolf mode and tries to escape. Rock and ice fell about a\nstep behind him as he ran. He could feel the heat comeing through the cave\nfrom behind him.\n\nThe roof  cracked where Grizzltron hit it, it was made from Ice and snow\nforming and freezing over an opening to either another part of the cave or\noutside. (You decide) another good whack would allow Grizzltron to smash\nthrough to safety.\n\nA ball of flame chased the wolf as he ran at top speed towards the way he\ncame in. Lunarpine dodged as rocks fell nearly hitting him. The flames\ncreapt ever closer singeing his tail. The wolf was running out of breath\nwhen he saw the light of the exit. Just as the flames were about to overtake\nhim Lunarpine dove out, rolling down the side of the hill, the flames\nshooting out above him like a roman candle burning bright.\n\nIce landed near where Lunarpine lay panting. She transformed to her Polar\nbear form and stuck her nose close. &quot;Are you alright love?&quot; she asked\noutloud not wanting to find out if he&#39;s hurt telepathically.\n\nLunarpine rolled over, the fur on his back, tail, back legs, and rear end\nwere pretty badly burned. A natural wolf would have been paralyzed or worse\nbut since the Transformers were more than the normal animal he would be\nalright. &quot;Give me a few minutes to rest Wing.&quot; he said panting as he forced\nhimself up on his forelegs. &quot;I&#39;m just a little winded.&quot; The stubborn wolf\nwas to proud to admit that once again he&#39;d let his feelings for her put him\nin more trouble than he had to have.\n\nIce scanned the cave and mountain for any signs of thier attacker, the heat\nand debris from the bomb made it hard for her to concentrate. She couldn&#39;t\nget a lock to tell if Grizzletron was still functional.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Beast Wars AKA Proto &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 23, 2001 8:49 PM\nSubject: Re: what ever happened to Grizzltron?\n\n\n�Grizzltron�\n\n\n   Grizzltron jumps backwards to dodge the slash.
