He fired \noff a grenade at Torca&#39;s legs, followed by a sonic arc blast at Torca&#39;s left \narm.\n\n---\n\nPyro drove, the explosion of the missile sending shrapnel cutting into his \nside.  He fired off three fireballs at Sky Lynx, transforming to robot mode \nso he could get better maneuverability.\n\n---\n\nHiss fired off a blast from his fusion cannon, blowing apart the last \nautogun, catching an EMP blast in the chest, falling to his back and going \ninto stasis lock.\n\n---\n\nScavenger caught the blade missile and fell back, firing off 25 rounds at \nRatchet.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf took the missile and laughed at the dent in his armor, firing off \nthree bolts from his palm and a blade missile at Sideswipe.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper dodged one missile, 12 shots striking him.  He fired twenty-five \nrapid laser blasts at Sideswipe.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw fired off two missiles at Orion.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch watched the missile hit no where near him, and returned fire at \nOrion with two energy-signature seeking missiles.\n\n---\n\nInjector fired off two stinger missiles to intercept an incoming missile, \nfiring four stinger missiles at Orion from his other.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee dodged the missile, but caught all of the blasts.  He fired off \neight stinger missiles at Ratchet, four from each launcher.\n\n---\n\nSixshot&#39;s ignored the blasts, but the missile rocked his form.  He fired off \ntwo powerful blasts at Torca.\n\n---\n\nAres caught a missile in his current form, taking out one of his cannons.  He \nfired off twelve shots, four from each cannon, all heading for Sideswipe.\n\n"}}
