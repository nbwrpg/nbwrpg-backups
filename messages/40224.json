Apewing&#39;s right wing failed him for a second and Apewing \nfalls to the ground.  But, just before he crashed to the ground, his right \nwing started working again and he flew back up in the air\n\n   &quot;Is that all you got, you piece of Slag?&quot;  Apewing yells at Aerotaur.\n\n   Apewing takes his missle launcher and fires two missles at Aerotaur, he \nthen flies up in the air to make distance between him and his attackers.\n\n\n&gt;From: Rudra656@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Shockwave & Unitron\n&gt;Date: Wed, 18 Jul 2001 21:48:44 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;::Aerotaur/Aquataur/Terrataur::\n&gt;     The first missile hits him in the back blowing him out of the way of \n&gt;the\n&gt;second.  The third and forth missiles detonate near by burning his wings.\n&gt;&quot;He slowly picks himself up and turns around.  &quot;Fine, I can kill you first \n&gt;if\n&gt;you really want me to.&quot;  He fires four shots out of each arm cannon at\n&gt;Apewing.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Terrataur glances at Aquataur and smiles.  &quot;Hey do you have any idea \n&gt;what\n&gt;a smeel is?&quot;  She quickly responds with a negative and fires eight more \n&gt;optic\n&gt;blasts at Apewing.  Terrataur, likewise fires two powerful shots.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
