He&#39;ll be well within power limits.\n\n\n::Zardus::\n\n&#39;Awake.&#39;\n\nZardus slowly opened his eyes, looking up at the cealing. For a few \nseconds he had no idea who or where he was, but slowly his data \ntracks activated and he remembered that the Vok had made him go to \nthis lab for an upgrade. The upgrade must have been completed and the \nmachine that he had been in must have edjected him out, because he \nwas laying on his back on a table in the middle of the lab. But then, \nhe might have walked there and the Vok could have cleared that \nknowledge. Zardus groaned and sat up, rubbing his head with a hand. \nIt was simply a reflexive action, though, as he felt perfectly fine. \nHe froze, seeing his arm.\n\nIt was slightly bigger, still black, but with several red spots on \nit. One was on the back of his wrist, where his wrist computer was. \nThere were two spots beside that on the sides of his wrist, and he \nknew that there were two mini missile launchers that could emerge \nfrom both spots. The launchers would shoot missiles that were like \nFZ&#39;s: shielded against lasers and energy draining. They were small, \nmanueverable, and fast, but they did not leave a draining field like \nhis clone&#39;s. These ones only worked if they hit, but they worked more \neffectively. The orb was still burned into the palm of that hand, \nshowing both out of the back of the hand and out of the front, making \nhis hand a bit see-through.\n\nZardus blinked, looking over his body. He was definately bigger. He \nestimated that he would be approaching thirteen feet now, instead of \nthe eleven and a half that he used to be. The upgrade was obviously \nmore for efficiency than looks, because Zardus was almost identical \nto his old self. Other than the red spots on some weapon spaces and \nthe size increase, he was still covered with his beast mode feathers, \nand they still formed an extremely durable armor. In addition to the \njetpack on his back, jets were attached to his calves to give him \nextra speed in the air. He looked at his right arm and issued a \nmental command. The bottom of his wrist opened and a large device \nrotated down out of it, moving upward untill his hand was around a \nhandle and trigger. The device looked like:\n\n        Side view:                  Top View:\n          ____                      \n         /   |                       _|_ \n        -    |  )                   |___|\n        =---------+                 &#92; . /\n                                    (___) \n                                      X\n\n        Legend:                     Legend:\n\n       -, = Guns                  | Guns\n       ) Trigger/handle           . Trigger/handle\n       + Attachment to wrist      X Attachment to wrist\n\nThe device was a high-accuracy weapon. The side two guns both shot \nlasers, while the middle one shot a small missile with a highly-\nexplosive shell. There were two cameras in the spaces between the \nguns so that the screen that was in front of Zardus&#39;s hand, on the \nback wall of the weapon, displayed a depth-preceptive image of the \narea. The screen could zoom in and out to provide for better aiming. \nThree crosshairs represented the aim of the three guns. With another \nmental command, the weapon folded back into his wrist.\n\n&quot;All systems online,&quot; Zardus said without really knowing why, but the \neffect surprised him. He felt his optics charge as the laser-firing \nsystems that were in them activated, but the real improvement was the \nscanners. He could detect the area around him much better than in his \nold body, able to locate most of the bots in the Iron Fist without \nany external aid. Two guns emerged from his shoulders, aiming ahead \nof him. They could both fire highly-charged plasma beams, but their \nenergy packs needed to be recharged fairly frequently. Scanning his \nstorage compartments, Zardus found that the only pieces of his old \nequipment that he still had were his plasma launcher, some charges, \nseveral pistols, and a dagger. Two swords were stored in his torso, \nable to be charged with energy on command.\n\nZardus knew that even with his advanced body, there were still many \nbots on the planet that could prove an equal or a better to him. He \ncouldn&#39;t use all his weaponry in a battle, not without passing out \nfrom lack of energy after firing so much, as most of the weapons were \ncharged on his body&#39;s energy. However, his new body placed him far \nahead of his old one, and he had no doubt that it would come in very \nuseful.\n\n&#39;I see you like my upgrade,&#39; the Vok says in his head, causing Zardus \nto look around needlessly. The Alliance commander powers down the \noptic blasts and the shoulder cannons, the latter sliding back into \nhis shoulders.\n\n&quot;Its new, yes,&quot; Zardus replies mentally, flexing his arms and testing \nout the movement of his body. It was excellent.\n\n&#39;Good. Now go fulfill your task. You will have much trouble ahead, so \nI give you permission to make alliances as you see fit. However, fail \nand you will wish you had never crashed on this planet.&#39;\n\nZardus nods and walks out of the room, heading toward Najah and Lady \nHawk. Even though he had gone through an upgrade, he would still be \neasilly recognizable as Commander Zardus.\n\n\n"}}
