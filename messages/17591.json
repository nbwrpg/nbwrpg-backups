It was curious, and probly a trap. He locked on to its \nsigniture, \n&quot;Probe, what do you want with me?!&quot;\n\n    Megatron marvled at his success. Five clones of Inferno lied next \nto the \noriginal. Unfortunetly, the pigment of the armor went a little bad \nand the \nclones turned blue. That was no matter, though, he was going to \ndispatch them \nto crush Phobia, Kitkat, and all of there disgusting little soldiers.\n    &quot;Inferno! Clones! Get up. You have a mission.&quot; Megatron barked as \nthey \ngot up and marched over in a neat colum over to Megatron.\n    &quot;Our Queen, what are your orders?&quot; Inferno said, the official \ngeneral of \nthe clones. He was red, while the others were blue.\n    Megatron gave him a map, &quot;Find Phobia, and destroy him and any of \nhis \nallies. I want them destroyed, do you understand?&quot;\n    Inferno, and the clones, saluted. &quot;There will be nothing left of \nthem! \nTroops, take to the air!&quot;\n    The CLones, and Inferno, went into flight mode and exited the \ncave headed \ninto the darkness of the artic night, looking for Phobia, or waitng \nfor \nPhobia to find them.\n\n\n\n"}}
