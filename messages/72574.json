What can we do if his anger holds\n&gt; sway?  And his hatred is justified against all in our way?  What if he is\n&gt; under no pressure?  That he simply hates all and wants to go through them\n&gt; like a thresher?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; What Wheelie feared..  What if the Dinobots truly had gone to hate all, even\n&gt; their allies, for how they had been treated?  What would they do then?  He\n&gt; could not fight his old friends.

Be safe, and when ready\n&gt; go away.  Find the rest, and let them know.
