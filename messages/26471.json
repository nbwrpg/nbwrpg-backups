She \nreached out and put a hand on his shoulder.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry about your friends. Ship wrecks happen sometimes though.&quot;\n\nShe nodded at his question, understanding this one. &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll show \nyou around. You can even meet our commander. Here, follow me.&quot;\n\nShe turned and walked to the entrance to the Iron Fist, walking over \nthe short bridge that crossed the water that separated the \nbattlecruiser from the land and entering. She turns around, motioning \nfor D to follow.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Yes!!

They were dead, all dead?!\n&gt; His ears pressed against his head and he whined, long and mournful. \nHe bowed \n&gt; his head and sat there.\n&gt; Even the woman who was so nice to him...dead.\n&gt; He knew what death was and he didn&#39;t like it.\n&gt; D heaved a sigh and looked out towards the edge of the island, \nwondering \n&gt; just where that ship was where the deaths of friends lingered.\n&gt; But he knew better then to linger over death too much, wondering if \nhe would \n&gt; make any friends here that might replace the ones he lost.\n&gt; One never knew.\n&gt; D looked at Fenox, slightly whining again. But he soon got to his \nfeet and \n&gt; shook himself, still slightly saddened but thinking that dwelling on \nit \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t help. They were gone and there was nothing he could do \nabout it.\n&gt; He gestured towards the Iron Fist.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Show?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * He wanted to see the inside, maybe meet some more of these beings \nof \n&gt; steel.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp:/\n\n\n"}}
