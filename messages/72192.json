I cant fill up\n&gt; the gaps, not here, it would be dangerous for us...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; then Nigthlight looked around and the oppresive sorroundings give her creeps\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nOppressive is right. Even in RODIMUS&#39; chamber it is still somewhat\ndim. The lights brightened at his entrance, but the interior was still\nsomehwat spartan and the walls were colored in a dark colored paint. A\ndesk and chair, a recharging chamber, a samll viewscreen and a control\npanel presumably hooked to the bases computer systems. There was a\nsmall work out center on one side where RODIMUS could presumably work\non his target practice as well as work on testing the upper limits of\nstrength and endurance.\n\nIn one corner there was a picture of ELITA and NIGHTLIGHT it looked to\nbe hand drawn, although in the picture it was like NIGHTLIGHT was\nbefore she got her current fuzor beastmode, something like how she was\nwhen she first escaped HYDRAS&#39; clutches.\n\nThat may also remind NIGHTLIGHT of what she may have heard of the\ninsectile creatures that RODIMUS mentioned. About how TUSCON and the\nothers had to fight their way past them and escape out of the other\nside running back towards the ARK. RODIMUS had nearly sacrificed his\nlife at that point so that TUSCON could escape HYDRAS&#39; base and TUSCON\nhad dragged him all the way back to be repaired. It was a thrilling\ntime. It was around the time that RODIMUS seemed to have fought off\nthe last of the dark taint that had been so much a part of his spark\nand finally freed himself of being DARK RODIMUS!\n\nAnd yet here was DARK RODIMUS again - - - strange isn&#39;t it?\n\nDARK RODIMUS turned to look at NIGHTLIGHT, &quot;So, when did you get the\nnew form?&quot; He looked at her, examining her new frame and the changes\nit made in her robot mode. &quot;It is very . . . becoming on you.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
