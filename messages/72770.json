RAMULUS was already on board checking over the craft checking\nif it had suffered any damage.\n\nMeanwhile POLAR CLAW was looking skyward. &quot;Look!&quot; He called out as he\npointed to the tower.\n\nFrom the tower smoke still poured out and fire was errupting from it\nand the remains of the framework that was still left of its uppermost\nstorey. However coming out of the fire there were small motes of light\nlooking something like embers at first, perhaps burning pieces of of\nthe building structure, but then they began to move and fly.\n\nUpwards they moved, higher and higher into the skies they continued\nuntil they at last faded from sight, seeming to move up past the\nclouds.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
