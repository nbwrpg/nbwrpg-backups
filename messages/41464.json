He sends several commands to several\n&gt; different sectors of the shield, a mechanical sound becoming audible as panels slide aside in\n&gt; the outer walls to reveal autoguns that slide out and lock in place. The shields shimmer\n&gt; slightly as they recieve more energy, becoming a bit less see-through.\n&gt; \n&gt; All of the outer doors, except for two on opposite sides of the city, slide shut and lock\n&gt; magnetically, built well enough so that it wasn&#39;t distunguishable where wall met door. A\n&gt; slightly louder sound of gears is heard as the solar panels slide a bit down into the center of\n&gt; the city, the dome-like structure that used to be the Element, the transmission jammer moving up\n&gt; a bit to be usable.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;City&#39;s all ready, Commander. I can fully lock it down at your orders,&quot; Cyndro informs Iron\n&gt; Raptor, scanning the area just in case.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl and Rixer both hear IR&#39;s orders, getting into Maximal City and look back at IR.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Want me to help you out, love?
