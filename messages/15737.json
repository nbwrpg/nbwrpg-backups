She reached up and tried to take off the \nchip from her neck.  It shocked her hand and she shook with \npain.  &quot;That was not a good idea.&quot; she said to herself.  She layed \ndown on the bed and stared at the ceiling.  The chip controled her \nmotions, not her thoughts.  But is was slowly starting to over ride \nthat too.  She tried to think of how to get her and Striker out of \nthier situation.  But  no solutions came to mind.  \n\nShe couldn&#39;t help but feel like she had let her one true friend, and \nthe only bot she ever really cared for, down.  She could only lie \nthere and close her eyes as the tears rolled down her cheeks.\n\n\n"}}
