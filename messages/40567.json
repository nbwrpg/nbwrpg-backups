This is an \nRPG board, not a general discussion board. If you want to discus \nsomething, do it over private email or on the message board on the \nsite.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know about other people, but I am sick as hell of the \ncompletely pointless OOCs on the RPG board. Lurker, you&#39;re a great \nRPer. Now shut up and take the compliment. Dewey, this is a BW RPG. \nThe moment I see a char with even a variation of &quot;Goku&quot; as his name, \nyou&#39;ll regret it. In adition, stop moding. You can&#39;t make other \npeople&#39;s chars do things, you never posted for Mustex even attempting \nto get on Alliance Island, much less getting on it, you have no part \nin the past of NBW, and can&#39;t change it at will. Your chars have no \nlogical way of knowing about Zardus or Veratis, and its moding to \nhave them have that insight. Either explain how they know or drop \nthat storyline. It makes no sence. Also, you never even landed that \nlowlife seller or whatever of yours on the planet, and I&#39;m not going \nto write your profiles for you. Shape up. Read the rules and act by \nthem. LegendaryNemasis, please stop commenting on every post. The \ncouncil will catch it if its moding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone else: stop the OOCs. Either write RPG posts, or don&#39;t post \nat all. I&#39;m very sick of coming home from work and reading through \n100 or so damn OOC posts. I&#39;m about ready to moderate anyone who \nsends an OOC ever again. I won&#39;t, but keep in mind that I&#39;m on the \nverge of turning into a very mean person.\n&gt; \n&gt; From now on, use private email for pointless OOCs, or use the \nsite&#39;s message board. DO NOT clog up space on this board. I&#39;m sick of \nit, as I said like 10 times already in this post.\n&gt; \n&gt; There. I&#39;m through with my ranting. I really hope the OOC messages \nstop. Its very hard for me to keep up with posts as it is, and all \nthis pointless crap is starting to convince me not to even bother.\n\n\n"}}
