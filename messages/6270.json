I await your response.\n\nListening to the Maximal frequencies he hears Prowl call for \nreinforcements, He wanted to set a course and use his ship to put an \nend to the fighting. Phobia knew the armaments on the ship wouldn&#39;t \npierce the shields of a ship but it could lay a few enemies down to \nrest.\n\nUnfortunately he had to make sure the information he had got to the \nright authorities.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Prowl/Striker/Kluster/Chordate/Killer/Annihilator/Zeus/Ramhorn/Smo\nke\n&gt; screen::\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl apears near the Ark, nearly falling out of the sky from \n&gt; exaustion. His energy levels quickly recover and he stands up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m back, everyone,&quot; he says into his comm-link.
