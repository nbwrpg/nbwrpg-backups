She stood back as the chamber opened and out came a black wolf.  \nThe bot then transformed into bot mode and looked around. &quot;Predacon Leader \nKitKat2, statis, functional.&quot; KitKat shook her head. &quot;Wha, where am I? And \nhow&#39;d I get here?&quot;\nSquizzy smiled. &quot;Ah, your the one they had me cl...erhm..fix up. How are you \nfeeling?&quot;\nKitKat looked at the mongoose bot and smiled. &quot;You fixed me up? I thank you. \nNow please, I must return to my troops. Tell your leader that he will have \nthe appreciation of the PACK and can count on us for support in the future.&quot;\nSquizzy opened her commlink. &quot;Zardus, she&#39;s awake and ready to go.&quot;\nKitKat looked at Squizzy and noticed the name that the mongoose had spoke. \nKitKat said, &quot;Zardus? I know that name. But from where?&quot; she muttered.\n\n\n::DarkMouse::\nShe turned up the power to the tank and waited for the process to finish.  \nThe tank opened and out stepped the black wolf bot.  The bot transformed \ninto bot mode. The bot was KitKat.  DarkMouse smiled,&quot;AH, KitKat, great to \nhave you back among the functional bots. How ya feelin&#39;?&quot;\nKitKat looked at DarkMouse. &quot;Wha? Oh, DarkMouse. What happened?&quot;\nDarkMouse started to tell KitKat about her assasination and how she was \ncloned and brought back.\nKitKat looked around,&quot;And what happened to Drillbit? If you&#39;ve been asleep \nfor that long and I&#39;ve been in that tank, then how can I find out who&#39;s left \nof our Pack and how do we get them together again?&quot;\nDarkMouse sighed,&quot;That I&#39;m not sure about my leader. But for now, You must \nmeet the new leader of the Predacons. And who knows, you may take your place \nback as leader.&quot;\nKitKat shook her head,&quot;I may take my place as leader, but without troops, \nit&#39;s no use being a leader. What&#39;s a leader without someone to lead? No \nDarkMouse. I&#39;ll not lead untill it&#39;s the right time. That&#39;s how I became \nleader in the first place.  I let the other leader get killed, then I took \nhis place. Besides, I am worried about Drillbit. Have you heard form him?&quot;\nDarkMouse shook her head. &quot;Not yet, but I&#39;m awaiting a call back.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
