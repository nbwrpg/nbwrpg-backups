The hole is very narrow and yet for the moment very very straight. It is cutting through the soft earth of the surface, and it is obvious that if Darkhawk continues that he is risking being buried alive. \n\nThe disk is no longer in sight, although from the sound of things it is still continuing  to make progress much further ahead. \n\n&gt; Walking over to where the device was burrowing into the ground, Shard\n&gt; looked down the hole and then up at Hydras. \n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Orders?&quot;\n\n(TAG: Hydras, Darkhawk, Shard)\n\nOOC: I will let Hydras respond about the orders. Also Shard will not be able to see much down the hole with Darkhawk wriggling down. The hole looks perfectly straight as if cut with a razor . . . or a disintergration beam\n\nWelcome back Shard!!!!!! I hope all is going well!! :)\n\nPreston\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
