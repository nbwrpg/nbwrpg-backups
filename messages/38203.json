I have also entered.&quot;\n\n::Hot Rod::\n\nHe looked up at the confused Starice.\n&quot;Dont worry, we are training. These are stun weapons.&quot;\n\nOOC: Later today I am leaving and I&#39;m not sure how long I will be gone.\nIt could be up to a week. Since DrillBit is in battle, I leave him to\nYan. Also Hot Rod and Epyon, but Yan, keep Hot Rod training. if it ends,\nhave him train for the IGL. Same with Epyon when he is done watching\nEyebright. Since KitKat2 is sleeping we will just leave her alone.\nThanks! I will still be posting for most of the day though.\n\n"}}
