The prisoners have been loose since\nday one, but my characters cleared the upper decks and got it flying\nagain.  My character Celeron who is now with the Bushido Predecons got\nhis start here. Since the reset (the start of NBW Age of Wars) the\nship has been orbiting earth and it is once again in very bad\ncondition.  The remaining crew has little memory of what happened.\n\nIt would be fine to put a character down there, but I have one or two\nmore post ideas i want to do before the prisoners become more active.\nI think there was at least one other person who said they were\ninterested in joining this plot earlier.  Email or IM me if you have\nany questions and I&#39;ll try to get this plot moving.\n\nOn 9/29/07, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Heya! I may have an idea for a prisoner by the name of Spectrum. How\n&gt; would I go about inserting him onboard ship? He could easilly be\n&gt; onboard in the lower sections and the power fluxuation have freed him,\n&gt; or what ever else suits your needs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Boardwalk for $500?
