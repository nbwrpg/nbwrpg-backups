She watched as the \nmajority of them attacked Dinobot. But she didn&#39;t care. She never backed \nanyone up. It was her life she was defending. She watched as a wounded bot, \nSerpentor limped off to a tree.\n\nHer lips went into a sneer. He was perfect; she didn&#39;t need to risk herself \nin high intense of battle. She down to him, and grabbed him by the \nshoulders, lifting him up into the air.\n\n&quot;I believe you and I have to talk,&quot; she said. &quot;Predacon to Predacon.&quot; She \nwent to fly him away from the battle field.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
