She&#39;s on real high edge.)\n\n\nCyber Claw:\n\n\n\n\nCyber Claw growled at Striker&#39;s closeness. Her eyes were cold and watched \nhim closely, watched ever movememnt he made. She hissed at him, with her \nbody still pinned to the door. She wasn&#39;t moving until that door was opened.\n\n&quot;I won&#39;t join you even if you cared to spare my worthless life,&quot; she snarled \nat him. Her voice was rising to Dinobot&#39;s tone again, but this time is \nwasn&#39;t on purpose. &quot;I&#39;ve come here for only one thing. I want to know \nMegatron&#39;s whereabouts.&quot;\n\n\n&gt;From: Yanshosh@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Tue, 13 Jun 2000 17:05:22 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;::Striker::\n&gt;\n&gt;Striker lets out a breath of relief as Dinobot takes several steps back. He\n&gt;puts away his guns and his shoulder blasters conceal themselves in his\n&gt;shoulders.\n&gt;\n&gt;Striker walks up to Cyber Claw.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Please transform and join us,&quot; he says in a soothing voice, &quot;We will not\n&gt;harm you. Isn&#39;t that right, Dinobot?&quot; He says the last sentence louder, so\n&gt;Dinobot would have no trouble hearing it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Striker then turns his head to Liono, looking at the stats on the\n&gt;holoprojector.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;If their base is that well defended, we wouldn&#39;t have much of a chance\n&gt;defeating them, Liono,&quot; he says thoughtfully, looking at the info on the\n&gt;projector.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
