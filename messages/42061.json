FZ silently sends a reply back,\n&gt; though not lowering his guard.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Welcome to earth, VorbIss,&quot; the transmission reads, &quot;this is Zardus,\n&gt; Commander of the Alliance, speaking. I will send a shuttle to pick you up\n&gt; if you wish to learn more about us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With that, he sends some commands to a shuttle, the docking bay on the Iron\n&gt; Fist opening and a small shuttle flying out, blasting off toward VorbIss.\n\n::VorbIss::\n\nAs the message came in, VorbIss halted. There were other robots on this \nplanet after all. They called themselves the &#39;Alliance&quot;. \n[Do you know what a name like that means?] posed Iss to his counterpart. [The \nAlliance implies that they are allied against someone. The Alliance is at war \nwith someone else on this planet with a probablility of 64% plus/minus 16%.]\n\n&quot;Thanks for the statistics, Iss, but nobody else has said anything.&quot; thought \nback Vorb.\n\nHowever, as if to confim Iss&#39;s position, a new message came in immediately: \n&quot;This is Shivah, BlackFortress&#39;s second in rank, welcome to Planet Earth... \nWe&#39;re interesting to get an alliance with you. please reply this message&quot;\n\nVorb thought for a moment. The Alliance was sending him a shuttle. They must \nalready know where he was. BlackFortress, probably an enemy of The Alliance, \ndid not know his location. He would go with The Alliance, learn about them \nand learn of Black Fortress through their predicted-to-be warped viewpoint \nabout (potentially) one of their enemies.\n\n[Very complex] injected Iss. [But can you make the decision fast? Do I \ncontact BlackFortress or not? Because sensors indicate a shuttle is coming \nup.]\n\nAlmost validating Iss&#39;s readings, the low throb of a shuttle sounded off in \nthe direction VorbIss had been headed. \n\n[Here is what we will do. The Alliance does not know of ht einvitation by \nBlackFortress. We will not tell them. If The Alliance is deemed as an \nunacceptable party, we will defect.] \n\nVorb didn&#39;t see any better, so he shot of a transmission. &quot;Roger your \nshuttle, Alliance. I&#39;d love to get some info.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
