Thank you.)\n\n* Dinobot growled as he looked back towards the ruins of the Ark, smoldering and crackling with doused flames and loose wires, circuitry.\nThe Autobot craft was nearly totally destroyed now and he knew it, there was no hiding the fact that the cargo ship was plainly useless and dysfunctional.\nWith a shake of his head he then turned it back towards the direction that the new ship lay and began to move off towards it, knowing of it�s location from the last remaining console in which had flickered and died before him only moments before.\nHe had felt the ship shutter and nearly collapse before, the walls ready to buckle with the slightest of pressure.\nRepaired to the fullest and strength restored he had transformed into robot mode and had scanned, all but a few systems dead and a new ship breaching the atmosphere. Then simply exiting the Ark moments after the last console fell blank, the ship no longer serving its� purpose and, thus, no longer worth his concern.\nDinobot wanted to see just what this new ship looked like but was in no hurry, knowing that he would probably be confined to the new shuttle for duties when he simply wanted to explore. But he knew he had to deal with it eventually, being put to menial tasks just being one of the side effects of being a soldier. Nothing new.\nHaving no possessions at all he simply walked away from the Ark, nothing to collect or of any value to him what so ever.\nSeeing some bots scurry about, repairing and collect the their belongings. Almost like raids of the dead after a battle, soldiers picking through dead soldier�s property just to see if they could come up with something of value. But this time it was soldiers picking up their OWN belongings�only picking through the remnants of a dead ship.\nThough how others could value such materiel things was beyond him, only needing his warrior skills and wits in his entire life, not having anything in which he sought special to him.\nDinobot passed by the last bots as they rushed to gather their things, the base now far enough away that he no longer smelled the burnt components�the base leaving his mind completely in time.\nThe scenery changed in time as he neared the edge of the Island, nothing much to look at or catch his interest. \nPebbles and dust fell from the edge, no sound herd from above as then splashed and disappeared into the depths of the sea.\nDinobot looked down at the blue waters and sighed, leaving familiar ground for the vast unknown. But the more he thought about it the more he knew that that thought was wrong, it wasn�t unfamiliar ground�just territory in which he had not seen in a while. But he could not have cared if he knew it or not, nothing more then a stray thought that didn�t matter.\n(7 min later, in beast mode:)\nHe shock the last drops of water from his back talons as he took his third step onto dry land, then simply moving on towards his final destination.\nThe smell of the grass was welcoming to him, the scent of game carried to his snout from somewhere across the plain stretched before him.\nNothing but open land with the occasional spars tree in the distance, the Cybertronien Fire somewhere in the wild beyond.\nDinobot looked over the vast plain as he crested a small hill, freedom as far as the optic could see.\nThe sun beat down on a plain as wild as the beasts it held in it�s midst, the newest addition being nothing more then a beast itself. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
