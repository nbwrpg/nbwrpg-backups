It&#39;s about time we stuck =\r\na few arrows up lizard afts tail end.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift chuckles at Straight=\r\n Shot&#39;s statement, as he acklowledges Perceptor&#39;s downloads.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Gettn&#39; &#39;=\r\nem now Perceptor. Maaaan talk about heavy intel. There&#39;s no chance I&#39;m gonn=\r\na get lost now. Hmmm, I might be able ta configure a safe short cut inta th=\r\ne fortress... Any chance ya got the codes ta disable any security software =\r\nI might have ta know about?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson waits patiently for Cheetor&#39;s news =\r\nof clear passage as he transforms into his vehicle mode, opening his doors =\r\nto Lord Elder, and Talon. His engine rumbles at the start yet runs quietly =\r\nafter being started, which was a signature trade mark of his previous vehic=\r\nle form, who&#39;s engine was barely even heard when standing idol. Night Shift=\r\n also gets into vehicle form, opening his doors to Windlord and Perceptor. =\r\nHis engine silences after being started yet remains idol.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Night Shift=\r\n, as soon as Cheetor comes back, and relays the intel, you will slowly adva=\r\nnce into position with Perceptor and Windlord. Take your time, we are not r=\r\nushing into this because the faster we travel, the faster we will raise sus=\r\npicion. Feel free to take any path you wish. If you wish to go off road, ev=\r\nen better. Try not to kick up any dust on your tires if you can help it.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gotchya. If anyone can roll in silent mode, it&#39;s=\r\n me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson then turns to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If I can get everyone to move =\r\nin slowly, we have a very good chance of going unseen and unheard. I also p=\r\nlan to send a mild sonar wave which should mask all our signatures, includi=\r\nng those of Perceptors, by using a signal configuration code. I haven&#39;t tri=\r\ned doing that but I do know my sonar system can work around various codes a=\r\nnd configure a buffer that will not harm anyone who isn&#39;t under our signatu=\r\nre. If at any time, you feel that our plan is not working, feel free to int=\r\nervine&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride then turns to Lord Elder and Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I shoul=\r\nd definitely be able to smell trouble if it comes. And don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t=\r\n let anyone down. Just to let you guys know, I work better in beast form, s=\r\nince that&#39;s where all my senses are. Well, I better get out there&#39;n start p=\r\natrol duty. You&#39;ll know where ta find me. QUICKSTRIDE, MAXIMIZE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With =\r\nthat he gets into his equine mode and walks out instead of bolting out of t=\r\nhe Ark, to keep suspcions low. He sniffs the ground and as part of the illu=\r\nsion, nibbles at a few blades of grass. Yet, his ears remain focused on the=\r\n task at hand as does his eyes and nose. He raises his head while nibbling,=\r\n remaining still and doing what horses do best, which was staying still, an=\r\nd occasionally lowering their heads for a few snips of grass.\n&gt;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRod=\r\nimus nodded as he brought his console fully online. Screens lit up as commu=\r\nnication gear began to glow with readiness. &quot;We will do what we can.&quot; He sa=\r\nid, his voice, despite his words, was full of confidence. \n\n&quot;Be careful.&quot; L=\r\nord Elder said, his voice, as always the voice of reason. &quot;I can send Rodim=\r\nus to back you up if need be, but our sensors will not be able to track you=\r\n beyond a certain point. You will be on your own unless you call us.&quot;\n\n&quot;But=\r\n if you call, we will be ready.&quot; Rodimus said, the old enthusiasm creeping =\r\nback into his voice.\n\n&quot;Cheetor to base!&quot; Cheetor&#39;s voice crackeled over the=\r\n comm.-channel. &quot;I&#39;ve gotten here.&quot; He said, he was obviously out of breath=\r\n from the travel. \n\nCheetor whisteled over the channel, &quot;You should see wha=\r\nt they&#39;ve done.&quot; Cheetor is not equipped with cameras, but his voice contin=\r\nued, &quot;The base looks totally rebuilt, like some sort of fortified tower, en=\r\ncased in armor.&quot; \n\nThere is a pause, the sound of movement, probably Cheeto=\r\nr, and then he continued, &quot;There is a small lake of magma here, and the tow=\r\ner is sitting in the *middle* of it. If you can&#39;t fly, you are going to hav=\r\ne trouble getting to it.&quot; There was another pause, &quot;From what my thermal sc=\r\nanners tell me, the surface of the tower is HOT, all that hot rock sitting =\r\nnear it.&quot;\n\nThe sound of more movement, &quot;Slag!&quot; The sound of movement, &quot;I se=\r\ne one . . . two . . . three?? Scourge&#39;s flying around here.&quot; He sounded def=\r\ninitely confused. &quot;They seem to be patrolling.&quot; His voice dropped to a whis=\r\nper, &quot;I&#39;m signing off, I think they can hear me . . .&quot; \n\n&lt;Click&gt; the line i=\r\ns shut off. \n\nLord Elder turned to look at Tuscon as Rodimus stood up tryin=\r\ng to reopen the comm-channel, &quot;Cheetor! CHEETOR!!!&quot;\n\nThe channel remained s=\r\nilent. \n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n"}}
