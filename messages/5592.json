It seems to disrupt the rat&#39;s plans. \nLooking at all the monitors he noticed a small (dime sized) bug on one, his \nhand moved to crush it.\n    &quot;Bugs, disgusting creatures,&quot; He said to himself. Then he pressed a \nbutton that is at his fingures, the monitor in front of him changed to what \nCheetor was seeing. He leaned forward.\n    &quot;Well, isn&#39;t this interesting. It seems that the Maximals have a new \nallie, and he seems very powerful, he could be useful.&quot; He said commenting on \nPrimal Prime. &quot;Computer scan the that robot for anything.&quot;\n    &quot;Maximal signature dectected, no other information available at this \ntime.&quot; The computer replied in it&#39;s emotionless tone.\n    &quot;Damn! I need to know about that robot. Wait, an idea,&quot; he said to \nhimself. He leaned over to a microphone next to him, it was new. &quot;Cheetor, I \nknow you don&#39;t know where this is coming for, but I need to to stay by that \nRobot, and ask him questions about himself, like weaknesses.&quot;\n\n(If you have any reason to think I&#39;m moding e-mail me personally, I don&#39;t \nwant to take up the boards time.)\n\n"}}
