At this \ntime he felt there was no time to actually deal with enemy forces and having \none directly in the same room was not good, but at the same time, this \npredacon wasn&#39;t making any moves to attack anyone, as he could rightfully \nsense.  Yet, his pressense does make him uneasy.\n\n&quot; Leo Prime, have the Ark checked for loopholes in our security system, if \nthis predacon was able to breach our system there may be a chance  that \nothers could slip easilly by our security system. We can&#39;t afford to have \nour operations compromised, not now. And where the pit is Rodimus?&quot;\n\nStraight Shot makes it back in the room, as Tucson asks the question.\n\n&quot; He&#39;s trying to find Wheelie.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot; Of course, but does it have to take that long?  Anyway, Leo Prime, given \nthe situation at hand, which you have described as rightfully iminent, we \nwill have to do everything in our power to be sure that this planet is kept \nundesturbed, and left as Nature intended it to evolve.  But in order to do \nthat, we need an energy supply to boost the Ark&#39;s systems, and right now we \ndon&#39;t have that, but, we will if we take Quickstride&#39;s proposal into \nconsideration.  Energy is everything but at the same time, we do not want to \nsteal from this planet, when we can actually develop ways to produce our own \nby working with it rather than against it.  Perceptor brought up a very \nvalid point as well.  Hydras did have access to power, but unlike \nQuickstride&#39;s method of harnessing it, he just left it to go out of control, \nand look where that got him.  We have the upper hand, a means to work with a \nnatural resource that is less harmful to some degree, and will not risk any \ndanger to our lives and those that reside on this planet.  Now, as soon as \nRodimus gets here, I&#39;d like Quickstride to explain and show all of us, the \nproject he&#39;s working on, to provide the Ark with an energy source.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Quickstride once more.\n\n&quot; After all, energy is everything, and we have to do everything in our power \nto produce and concerve it.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As everyone walked in, talking amongst themselves, rather than being\n&gt; greeted by the site of an impatient LEO PRIME they see LEO talking\n&gt; with a green mech who is giving off a definite Predacon signature, a\n&gt; mech called CELERON.\n&gt;\n&gt; So far LEO PRIME still had no actual weapons out but he was looking at\n&gt; the Predacon and asking a question, &quot;Tell me, why did you, a Predacon,\n&gt; bring this to our attention? I would think that this would work in\n&gt; your favor, perhaps use the confusion to accomplish whatever you have\n&gt; in mind.&quot; His face was registering more curiousity than distrust at\n&gt; this point, although his manner was a bit reserved.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the same time as LEO talked the fuzors TORCA, NOCTORO were watching\n&gt; the Predacon from their sides. They were standing at the ready but had\n&gt; as yet made no hostile move.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
