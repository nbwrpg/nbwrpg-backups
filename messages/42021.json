As he \nwalked lights turned on where he was and off when he left, saving \nenergy.\n\nHe stepped into his chamber and sat in his thone.  Two balls arose \nfrom the sides, Havok placing his hands on them.  The two balls \nglew with energy as Havotron was refilled.  Holographic images \narose in front of him, showing the earth.  \n\n&quot;Focus on this new, spark.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes master&quot; \n\nThe holograph of the earth zoomed in showing only a portion of \nland, a pod there, and the wierd shifting of this bots body.\n\n&quot;Contact him immediatly, Phebus.
