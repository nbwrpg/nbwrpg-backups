One of the protoforms must have gone offline. \n&gt; Then he saw the Maximal insignia on Mustex and knew he had lost the \n&gt; protoform. Worse yet the new bot looked like a BABY, it had to be \n&gt; weak now, but it could be a formidable opponent in the future if it \n&gt; went through the same gradual upgrades as humans. He wouldn&#39;t allow \n&gt; it to happen. HE was the maost powerful bot in the universe, and it \n&gt; would stay that way.

He needed rest and the cave would \n&gt; offer\n&gt; &gt; enough concealment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Once inside the mutant found the cave paintings from a youth,  \nfrom \n&gt; what he\n&gt; &gt; could tell the youth was human, a tribe of the useless fleshy, \nweak\n&gt; &gt; creatures must have migrated away and left only thier paintings \nto \n&gt; show they\n&gt; &gt; were ever there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megaton reached out and touched the wall, a sudden charge of \nenergy \n&gt; forced\n&gt; &gt; the large bot away from the wall. He held up his hand and scanned \n&gt; it for an\n&gt; &gt; energy signature only to find nothing had happened to him. The \n&gt; scanns did\n&gt; &gt; reveal one oddity though. A thin layer of berries, sap, and mud \nhad \n&gt; coated\n&gt; &gt; his fingers. The wall paintings were wet like they were drawn an \n&gt; hour ago\n&gt; &gt; instead of  years past.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The mutant exited the cave ansd scanned the world. two pods \nweren&#39;t \n&gt; far\n&gt; &gt; away. The beast transformed to his T-Rex form and went to \n&gt; investigate. once\n&gt; &gt; nearby he detected animals, three of them. from the looks of \nthings \n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; was a mother, father and baby. A mighty swing of the monsters \ntail \n&gt; remedied\n&gt; &gt; the family situation killing the mother (leaving the baby and \n&gt; fathers DNA to\n&gt; &gt; be replicated.) After the two creatures ran away he continued to \n&gt; the pod\n&gt; &gt; where he saw Stallex and Mustex, they weren&#39;t bots he recognized.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BOOC He&#39;s all yours dewboy, try to return him in the same \ncondition \n&gt; that you\n&gt; &gt; borrowed him in.\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 2:11 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: angry\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry I recheked you got him.

A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resemblance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his former mode might exist through the DNA replication. \nThis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rivalry between him and a few bots in the game. \n(Necromancer,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Veratis,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Megaton, just to name three.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sound OK to you? either that or we&#39;ll just say a future \n&gt; temporal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anomaly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will send Megaton back in time to when Stallex was young \nbut \n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happened to him yet.
