Though these \n&gt; were just weak laser blasts from the Maximal, a\n&gt; direct hit could take \n&gt; him down.  He may have to settle for an attack on\n&gt; the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron saw another jet getting shot at by an owl. \n&gt; His guess, a \n&gt; Maximal shooting at an Alliance member.  Getting a\n&gt; lock, he fired off \n&gt; 10 rapid laser blasts at Shadow Wing.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
