Sorry I couldn&#39;t post today. My computer is on its \ndeathbed here, and I&#39;ve been trying to get an old laptop set up so I \ncan post. I&#39;m on for only a second right now, but I&#39;ll be posting \nstarting tomorrow :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; The hard drive damage made a big streak over my /usr partition, \nwhere most of the software is located on a Linux system, so my \nbrowser was crippled, along with quite alot of my instant messenger \nand other programs.\n\n\n"}}
