He folded his hands in front of him, carefully\ninterlacing his fingers, his optics never leaving Hydras.\n\nAfter a moment he smiled as if coming to some decision, &quot;So, what kind\nof base are looking to construct?&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re not looking to side with him are you?&quot; Obsidian said from his\nposition, hovering over a security station.\n\nWithout turning Cryotek said, &quot;I will make whatever choice that I deem\nfit for those under my command.&quot; he turned his full attention on\nObsidian, &quot;Or are you challenging me for command?&quot; Cryotek&#39;s voice was\ncalm and controlled, and yet there was danger in it all the same.\n\n&quot;No sir, never.&quot; Obsidian said,m his voice much lower than before.\n\n&quot;Good! Then get back to work!&quot;\n\nCryotek turned back to Hydras, &quot;Ahh yes, where were we? Yeeesss, so\nwhat type of base are you looking for Hydras?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
