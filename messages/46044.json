I agree with the faction peice and was \nalso thinking that over.  We are to spread out and have to limit \nourselves.  I think that a sequal would be better, it&#39;s almost a \nrestart but players can carry some stuff over, i just think we should \nhave at the most four factions. If a faction only has three members \nin it for more then a month the faction should be cancelled and \nthey should join a strong one until they have enough support.\n\n"}}
