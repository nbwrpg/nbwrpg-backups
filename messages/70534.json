I didn&#39;t know it until I saw Airly&#39;s response and I checked. I will \n&gt; try to keep an eye on it, but if seems that I do not respond to you in a \n&gt; couple of days but I have moved on with other threads, please nudge me. \n&gt; Either I have forgotten, or more than likely I THOUGHT I sent something \n&gt; but Yahoo kicked it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt; IC:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kup:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Walked towards the cr and motioned the others to follow, Perceptor move \n&gt;&gt; with\n&gt;&gt; them hoping to helpt them. Kup pick up windlord first and went to one of \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; labs. he glenty leave Windlord in the medical table and sedated him then \n&gt;&gt; he\n&gt;&gt; started to check him.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Apparently Windlord is completely repaired, there is no damage that\n&gt; can be detected. He is also fully energized and ready for action. The\n&gt; only thing holding him back is the stasis cuffs, and now the sedation,\n&gt; both of which which keep his higher cerebral functions offline,\n&gt; holding him in an unconscious state.\n&gt;\n&gt; As Kup and Perceptor worked, they could see another soldier, Torca was\n&gt; walking passed the room.\n&gt; (http://tfu.info/1998/Maximal/Torca/torca.htm). If anyone demanded\n&gt; respect and homage among the Fuzors it was he. Larger than even\n&gt; Noctorro he commanded attention, the apparent leader of their number.\n&gt; He was followed by a smaller soldier, Bantor\n&gt; (http://tfu.info/1998/Maximal/Bantor/bantor.htm).\n&gt;\n&gt; Torca nodded to Kup as did Bantor, and then paused as they saw\n&gt; Perceptor and then Windlord, &quot;It is good to see Windlord.&quot; Torca said\n&gt; in his deep tones, &quot;But what is Perceptor doing here?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It is apparent that Torca and Bantor had not heard current events yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
