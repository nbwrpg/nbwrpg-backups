I have to be the guy to send mails for the spiders, I suppose.\nThey&#39;re just another creature living on this world, and are way too\nbeneficial. I mean, if it&#39;s not neccasary, then why kill them? I&#39;ve always\ntried to be kind towards animals in my posts, and not to harm them somehow,\nbecause I&#39;m nothing but soft at heart. I&#39;m a vegetarian, you know. Anyway,\nsorry for even bringing it up, but I knew nobody else was going to say\nanything about all of the spider violence in this RPG, so I knew that I\nwould be the first.

The senseless killing of spiders is\n&gt; &gt; upsetting me, and I don&#39;t want to read any post with violence towards\n&gt; &gt; spiders in it. I&#39;ll have to ignore things like that.

She felt like\n&gt; &gt; herold\n&gt; &gt; &gt; self again.  She came to a small pod which appeared to have been there\nfor\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; long time. She looked around, but didn&#39;t smell any other bots near by.\n&gt; &gt; She\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tranformed into bot mode and checked out the pod.  She smiled and\nwondered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if it was the answer to her situation. &quot;Perhaps I can use this to fix\nup\n&gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little cruiser.&quot;  She opened up a panel and stuck her hand inside,\ntrying\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; find the release mechanism for the propulsion ciruits.  She pulled her\n&gt; &gt; hand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back as she felt something sharp puncture her skin.  She saw a strange\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spider biting her arm.  &quot;Get off me you little insect.&quot;(yes I know a\n&gt; &gt; spider\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is an arachnid and not an insect)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She threw it to the ground and stepped on it, crushing it under her\nfoot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She sneered at the pod. &quot;I&#39;ll not touch that thing again if it&#39;s going\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bite me back like that.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With that, she transformed into leopard mode and continued on her way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
