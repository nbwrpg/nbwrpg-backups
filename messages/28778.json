He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; took his seat slowly, eagerly awaiting Veratis to decide thier\n&gt; next move.\n&gt; &gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thought about the previous attempts at communication and realized\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megaton had made the most progress of them all. The foxbot\n&gt; snapped to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attension when his mentor finally spoke.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Find me some compatible DNA from the files.&quot; Veratis instructed\n&gt; rubbing\n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chin in concentration. &quot;DNA that could be used to find\n&gt; something.&quot; He\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; use her name but Foxfingers knew exactly what Veratis was\n&gt; searching for.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lady Hawk had been instructed to maintain radio silence when she\n&gt; left. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fct that she didn&#39;t break it didn&#39;t surprise her father. The fact\n&gt; that she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was weeks overdue concerned Veratis though. Deep down inside he\n&gt; knew she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could handle herself but she&#39;d never been exposed to these\n&gt; situations\n&gt; &gt; before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The computers beeped and crackled as the selected DNA was\n&gt; inserted into\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scanner to create the next bot. The protoform slid into place,\n&gt; receiving\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; link from the scanner. &quot;Insert the virus&quot; Veratis called out over\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; noise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the computer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The young assistant did as he was told and was rewarded with\n&gt; success. He\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a little more carefull with his selection this time. The mistake\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megaton had taught him well. This time he used the DNA from two\n&gt; females.\n&gt; &gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was proud of his choices, but Veratis was still wary. Foxfingers\n&gt; selected\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the DNA from two of the best hunters he could think of.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The stasis pod opened and out stepped a shapely silver female, her\n&gt; &gt; features\n&gt; &gt; &gt; glimmering in the light of the lab. Foxfingers regretted knowing\n&gt; that soon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the virus would take hold and she would lose her robot\n&gt; form. &quot;Hello,\n&gt; &gt; welcome\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to life as we know it.&quot; The foxbot said to her, trying to watch\n&gt; her moves\n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much out of interest as caution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Where am I and where is my unit?&quot; the shining bot queried to her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; benefactors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You are where you are needed most my associate. &quot;There was a\n&gt; glimmer of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hope in the old bots eyes when he saw what Foxfingers had\n&gt; done. &quot;Your unit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as you put it is in protoform and not ready yet.&quot; he was carefull\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; choose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his words so he didn&#39;t upset his new hope. &quot;I need your help my\n&gt; dear.&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tried to be forward with the bot but didn&#39;t want to say to\n&gt; much. &quot;My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; daughter is missing, she left to collect samples of the wildlife\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; return.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The bot remained in a tall dominant stance, keeping eye contact\n&gt; with her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creator and his assistant. &quot;Give me the information on the\n&gt; wildlife she\n&gt; &gt; went\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after and I&#39;ll find her.&quot; There was no doubt in the females voice\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; success. her alternate forms showed even greater odds against\n&gt; failure.\n&gt; &gt; Even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if the wildlife Veratis had mentioned was translife the female\n&gt; was sure\n&gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t faulter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; After The beautiful young female had gathered the information she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformed into a small and muscular silver furred wolf. her\n&gt; shining coat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reflecting the room around her. As quicly as she had scanned the\n&gt; &gt; information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she sprinted outside and transformed again. This time she formed\n&gt; a large\n&gt; &gt; &gt; silver and black hawk. the ice and snow of the frigid norwegian\n&gt; landscape\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pailed to the glory of the majestic hawk taking flight heading\n&gt; toward Lady\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hawks last known position. (Saudi Arabia) With one last call back\n&gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; base she swore into her commlink. &quot;I will return your daughter to\n&gt; you, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have the word of Silver Scout.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
