LOLI&#39;m scanning it today, and then \nI&#39;ll post it. ^_^)\n\nTeltoli laughed out loud. &quot;I know.. I shouldn&#39;t be calling you old. \nBut I&#39;m young, and anyone that is a year older than me has to be old&quot; \nShe grinned, and looked up at the sky. &quot;Getting dark..&quot; She half-\nmurmered to herself. \n\nNot that it really mattered. Her beast form, being half panther, \ncould easily see in the dark, and that carried over to her bot form \nas well.\n\n&quot;I&#39;d almost forgotten what night was like on Earth.. without a Base, \nI mean. There were so many artificial lights on Cybertron you \ncouldn&#39;t see the stars. But here..&quot; The Fuzor trailed off as she \nlooked upwards at the Milky Way.\n\nSo preoccupied in naming off constellations in her mind, Teltoli \nalmost tripped over a lone branch that was laying across their path. \nShe yelped and quickly righted heself again, and glared at the \nbranch. Then she blushed. &#39;Good one, Teltoli, now Carnage will think \nyou&#39;re so stupid you couldn&#39;t survive one day out here!&#39; Her mind \nmocked her.\n\nShe sniffed and looked back up at the stars again. Her panther tail, \nwhich was a part of her bot mode, swished gently behind her in small \nmovements.\n\n&#39;Geesh, it&#39;s a small miracle.. no make that a big miracle, that \nCarnage hasn&#39;t tried to get rid of me or anything so far. I must be \nthe most annoying bot that anyone has ever met..&#39; Her face soured \nslightly, but she continued looking at the stars over the horizon. &#39;I \nmean, I&#39;m just turning 19, and she must be.. how old? Maybe in her \ntwenties or thirties.. certainly doesn&#39;t look it though. And it \ndoesn&#39;t really matter how old the body is, as long as the mind is \nstill active. I guess. But you can&#39;t exactly go fighting wars when \nyou&#39;re eighty.. can you..&#39;\n\n&quot;Ooohh Wow! My Dad used to point out that constellation to me all the \ntime! I can&#39;t beleive I can see it here.. he used to call it the \nBattle Blade. See those two real bright stars, that&#39;s the hilt, and \nthe other two are the bottom of the hilt and the tip of the sword&quot; \n(For those in the Southern Hemisphere, think Southern Cross ^_^) She \npointed out, delight in her voice.\n\n\n"}}
