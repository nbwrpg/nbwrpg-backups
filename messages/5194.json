Arrow stood up again, \n    and s=\r\ntarted pacing the room. Stronghold and Blender started to look in \n    crac=\r\nks in the wall for something to drink, despite plenty of water in this \n   =\r\n room. Train Wreck was discussing something with Arrow and Airbomber, and \n=\r\n    Stronghold and Blender joined them before long.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Say, you guys, it&#39;s really lonely sitt=\r\ning here with \n    nothing to do, and--&quot;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Shut up and get your ass over here! Of course you=\r\n can \n    join us!&quot; Arrow said, cutting off Stranato. Stranato walks over a=\r\nnd sits \n    with them. Stronghold pulls out a pack of playing cards.&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Plintissa and Dracona=\r\n smile to each other and walk up and \n    out of the secret passgeway, taki=\r\nng a walk across a field...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/=\r\nHTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_048F_01BFE1FB.6D59B620--\r\n\n"}}
