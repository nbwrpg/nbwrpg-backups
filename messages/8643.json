Okay, now here we go.&quot;\n\nBronco was about to fire at Choran again, when Octociz spoke up.\n\nWait! The reason you keep missing is because you&#39;re overwhelmed with \nrage. You need intelligence, too. Let me help you.\n\nWhat do you have in mind?\n\nMake your homing missles lock onto the bot you&#39;re fighting, that way \nthey will follow him. But if you launch them at him, he might be able \nto deak at the last second, before the missles can repond. Fire them \ntowards that bot over there(Imprisoner). But before they hit him, \nthey&#39;ll turn and hit the original bot.\n\nOkay, I&#39;ll try it.\n\nBronco locks onto Choran, but then aims towards Imprisoner, and fires.\n\n\n"}}
