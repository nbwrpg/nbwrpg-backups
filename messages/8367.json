It&#39;s true!\n\nSinesis and Sinister walk up to Stranato with the reprogram device. Someone\ntaps Sinister on the shoulder. He turns around. BAM! Stronghold&#39;s fist\nconnects with Sinister&#39;s face! Sinesis pulls out his blaster, but Blender\ngrabs it and rips it from his hand, taking his hand with it! Sinister is\ngrabbed by Train Wreck. Train Wreck lifts him up and Powerbomb&#39;s him through\na tree. Airbomber jumps from the top of a tree and lands on Dracona,\nknocking her over. Dracona and Airbomber exchange punches. Sinesis is\nwhipped into a tree by Stronghold. Stronghold grabs Siensis by the legs and\nlifts him up. Blender jumps up and grabs Sinesis&#39; neck, 3D!!! Blender raised\nhis hands up in a sign for the Diamond Cutter. Stronghold smashed Sinister\nthrough another tree with a Diving shoulder block. Blender hits a Diamond\nCutter on Sinesis. Arrow slices off a tree limb and Sinesis is pinned under\nit. Stranato charges Sinister and grabs him, hitting a ferocious Olympic\nSlam on Sinister. Dracona shoves Airbomber away finally and looks at Sinesis\nand Sinister, just laying there...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Iron Raptor&quot; &lt;ironraptor13@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, July 24, 2000 10:41 AM\nSubject: Re: The Rescue\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor sighed and rolled her optics in frustration, but she knew to\nthat Prowl loved her and was thinking of her safety.\n&gt; Some how knowing that she was thinking of running off in a completely\ndifferent direction that they did, fixing it so that her own signature would\nseem like all four of them while she made sure that the other three\nsignatures weren&#39;t able to be detected. The sensor ghosts disappearing so\nthat they would only detect her.\n&gt; Though, since she wasn&#39;t going to exit with the others, she was going to\nexit through the front door.\n&gt; With a second sigh she then fixes him with a determined and stern stare,\nhoping that he would listen to her then despite what doubts he had in his\nspark.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; PROWL! Do you think that I&#39;m so incompetent that I can&#39;t look after\nmyself?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She shook her head.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I know better to let them get me by surprise again. But I just ask you\nto do this simple task for me this one time and you say, &#39; No&#39;?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She walked up to him and placed a gentle hand on his cheek with a sigh,\npleading very visible in her own optics.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I know you&#39;re worried about me, Prowl. But it&#39;s time to think with your\nhead...and not your spark.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
