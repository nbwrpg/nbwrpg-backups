The Maximal scientist was looking at the damage.  Badly injured \nrobots.  Extensive damage to the Ark.  It would take to long to repair.  To \nlong in the war.  Someone coudl attack.  And crush them finally. \n&quot;We have to take drastic measures.  We&#39;ve been going down the tubes.  Attack \nafter attack after attack weakens us.  Every attack we do worse.  Do you know \nwhat causes it?&quot; Ramhorn asked.\n\n&quot;Errr...bad guns?&quot; Smokescreen guessed stupidly.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re outnumbered?&quot; Beachomber said with a more probable answer.\n\n&quot;Errr...no.  &#39;Good&#39; guesses though.  &quot;Bad leadership.  Really bad leadership. \n Terrible leadership.&quot;\n\n&quot;From Liono Prime?&quot; Beachcomber asked, knowing the answer though.  Who else \ncould he be talking about?\n\n&quot;Yes.  We need to hold a no-confidence vote.  Iron Raptor needs to get in \ncharge.  From what you&#39;ve told me, she risked her life just to try and calm \ndown an insane robot.  Or at least insane with rage.  Deeds like that are \nwhat the Maximals are all about.  Peaceful solutions.  We&#39;re pacifists.  Weak \nin some eyes, but we&#39;re strong.  Iron Raptor has reminded me or what a \nMaximal is.&quot;  \n\n&quot;War sometimes makes the Autobots and ourselves forget our principles.  \nRarely with the Autobots, unfortunately not so rare with us.  Iron Raptor is \nthe best choice for our leader.  Strong.  Intelligent.  Sane.  Thoughtful.  \nCaring.  Courageous.  And if needed, one skid plate-kicking warrior as she&#39;s \nproved time, and time again.&quot;\n\n&quot;Woah.&quot; Beachcomber commented, letting everything sink in, since he&#39;d only \nbeen there for a while.\n\n&quot;Should we go tell everyone?&quot; Smokescreen asked, excitement in his voice.\n\n&quot;What?  Now?  Are you slagging crazy!?  With the Ark in ruins, and our troops \nhalf dead?  We won&#39;t be voting until AFTER the Ark is repaired.  We can&#39;t be \nin a meeting room now with all our troops near death and our base near \nblowing up.&quot;\n\n&quot;Need us to get you to a CR chamber?&quot; Beachcomber concerned, hearing they \nweren&#39;t to spread the news quite yet.\n\n&quot;No.  You go find Iron Raptor and get some orders.  Ask her what to do.  I&#39;m \nsure she&#39;ll know.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ok.&quot; Beachcomber and Smokescreen said in unison, walking off towards Iron \nRaptor, seeing her, Archangel, and Prowl together.\n\n--\n\nAfter the two other Maximals had left, Ramhorn activated his com.  \n&lt;Plintissa, this is Ramhorn.  Follow the source of my com.  I need to speak \nwith you.  It is VERY important.  I urge you to come, despite \nour...differences.&gt;  \n\n---\n\nBeachcomber and Smokescreen appraoched Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;Requestion orderes, ma&#39;am.&quot; they asked in unison.\n\n"}}
