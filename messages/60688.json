Thankfully \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; course of events has provided us with an ample source of \n&gt; potential.  \n&gt; &gt; All actions in a past so distant are magnified in the present.  \nBy \n&gt; &gt; stealing the potential of even one bot who vaguely resembles a \n&gt; hero \n&gt; &gt; or villain we could very well achieve the equivalent of \ndestroying \n&gt; &gt; Optimus Prime.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       &quot;Master, I volunteer for this service,&quot; said Ex.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       &quot;No!&quot; cut in Deus, &quot;I-I mean in such a time period the \n&gt; &gt; destiny energy could magnify the potential for the prophesy of \nour \n&gt; &gt; demise being fulfilled.

He called on his prescience, and saw the potential for \nhis \n&gt; &gt; own ends.  Fortuneteller might think she was working for Deus, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; he knew he could make her do whatever he wanted in the end with \na \n&gt; &gt; few of Deus&#39; screams if she refused to comply with his \n&gt; will.  &quot;Very \n&gt; &gt; well!
