If there isn&#39;t enough space, you\n&gt; may give my room to someone.  Right now, I care not where I sleep. I\n&gt; will be in the lab if anyone needs me.&quot; She turned to\n&gt; Drillbit,&quot;Please help him find the space for everyone. I have a lot\n&gt; work ahead of me.&quot;  She opens her hip compartment and pulls out the\n&gt; spark.  She walked down the hall looking at the spark. She still\n&gt; couldn&#39;t beleive that is was a clone spark and not a real one. She\n&gt; walked into the lab and sets the spark in a containment jar.  Walks\n&gt; to the console across the room and presses a few buttons on the\n&gt; panel.  A blue light shines down on the spark and starts to sort out\n&gt; the componants of the spark.  She presses another set of buttons and\n&gt; a small red beam starts to cut the spark into several pieces.  She\n&gt; presses the third set of buttons and small green beam starts to\n&gt; analize the DNA, cellular structure and molecular composition.  She\n&gt; let the computer work and sat in a chair near the console.  She propt\n&gt; her arm up and rested her head in her hand.  She was still very mad\n&gt; about the fact that she had killed a clone and not the real Megatron.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
