Just something about him that stirred a \npartially deleted memory.  She knew him from somewhere. Her logic circuits \nwanted her to run away from the doorway.  Her spark told her different.  \nThis was driving her crazy.  She wanted to talk to him in the worst way.  \nBut something was holding her back.  She took two steps towards Quickstrike \nand stopped.  She shook her head and truned around and walked back down the \nhallway towards her quarters.\n&quot;I must be losing my mental circuits or something.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
