Diving behind a tree, he felt it shake as \nthe energon bullet pierced into it.  Turning around from the tree, he fired \noff three fusion blasts, running and jumping, transforming in mid air.  \n&quot;Catch me, Breakdown!&quot;\n\nBreakdown stood up, catching Hiss, the ex-snake (do to alternate mode \nchanges) in his ray gun mode, small enough for Breakdown to catch with one \nhand.\n\nPunch ducked, a tree being curt in half, flipping back, a blast skinning his \nknee.  The forest was burning fast.  Firing off three blasts from his plasma \ncannon at Archangel, he dived behind a tree, going to his kangaroo mode, \nhopping away.\n\nBreakdown fired a grenade off at Steel, three powerful laser blasts from Hiss \nin ray gun mode at Ripper&#39;s left knee, running deeper into the woods.\n\nPyro grunted, blasts digging into his armor.  &quot;Eat flames, punk!&quot; the \nOblitercon yelled, firing off three fireballs at Steel&#39;s abdomen, going \nreverse at 40 MPH, smashing through charred and dead trees.\n\n"}}
