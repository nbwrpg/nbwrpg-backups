He didn&#39;t like the \nidea of her hating herself in this form, but he guessed it was only \nher way of thinking, and he probably couldn&#39;t do much to change it.\n\n&quot;If the Ark&#39;s destroyed, would IRIS still be functional, love?&quot; he \nasks her, a branch scratching across his face.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * She waited paitently while Prowl absorbed the situation with the \npod, \n&gt; probably a little effected due to the fact that it was only a \nblank. A \n&gt; proptform with no spark.\n&gt; But with spark or not, they had to get moving, mainly to find Iris \nand ask \n&gt; about what in the pit was going on herr with this wierd beast mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; She keeps her snout on the back of Prowls shoulder, knowing that \nthis wasn&#39;t \n&gt; too good of a time for him. Wounded and now facing a sparkless \nform. But \n&gt; what pain she caused him by the nudge she didn&#39;t mean to, only \nwanting to \n&gt; tell him that she knew how he felt and that it was time to get \ngoing.\n&gt; The sun was already setting and it was dangerouse to travel at \nnight, \n&gt; especially with the enemy planning to attack as she was sure thery \nwere.\n&gt; Her eyes look up into his as he looks at her, seeing that there was \nlove \n&gt; there which had replaced the blank look he seemed to have only \nmoments \n&gt; before.\n&gt; \n&gt; She could understand why he still loved her, because he loved her \nfor her \n&gt; and not her appearence, because he knew that the spark of a bot \nstill beat \n&gt; inside her exo-structured chest.\n&gt; And that was part of the reason she loved him in the first place.\n&gt; But still, this situation not only effected her but Prowl as well. \nIf she \n&gt; hadn&#39;t been in pain she could have killed him, and almost did.\n&gt; And that was why she was going to Iris now, to find out just why \nand how \n&gt; this happened so that she could find out a way to stop it from \nhappening \n&gt; next time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor simply stood still as Prowl nodded to her and walked \nover to her \n&gt; side, still a bit concerned about the stump which was the only \nthing left of \n&gt; half of his wing.\n&gt; She felt him climb on and settle himself down, moving her back and \nshoulder \n&gt; muscles a bit to settle herself more comfortably to moving with a \npassenger \n&gt; again.\n&gt; Feeling him lean down she caught the feeling of the kiss and then \nsimply \n&gt; listened to what words he whispered into her ear.\n&gt; They were comforting to a point but only so far, knowing that \nperhaps he was \n&gt; the only one who loved her no matter what shape she took...for if \nanyone \n&gt; knew how she felt she was rather frightened of this beast mode, not \nbeing \n&gt; able to trust it.\n&gt; She didn&#39;t like its instincts or actions, or how it liked \nmutilation more \n&gt; then anything.\n&gt; It was horrable!\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed as she began to move off towards the setting sun \nonce \n&gt; again , continuing on her way towards the Ark.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s one of us which thinks that then...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that she picked up her speed and soon began to run, \nheading \n&gt; straight for the Ark.*\n\n\n"}}
