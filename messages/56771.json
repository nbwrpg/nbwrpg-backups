Then, &quot;She \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;does her duty without question. She&#39;s good thus far. As to appreciate, it is \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;too early to tell. If &amp; when she is faced with the face of who she once was &amp; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;decides to stay a Predacon, then that is when I shall appreciate her more so. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;However, she has a devotion well enough to her comrades.&quot; she informed him. She \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;was rather curious, somewhat, why he asked these questions. But dismissed \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;them as his own curiousity to know how Blackstorm was doing in her new mode. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;�nete al mayor servicio mundial de correo electr�nico:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.msn.com/8HMQESMX/2755??PS=&quot;&gt;Haz clic aqu� &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
