This \ninformation was relayed to the President and Vice-President of the IGL.\n\nAn unimportant crewman sent  reply transmissions directly to the two Maximals \nacknowledging Epyon&#39;s entrance as well as Hot Rod&#39;s.  The message was as \nfollows:\n\nFor Epyon:\n\n&quot;Thank you Epyon for entering the Intergalactic Gladiatorial League&#39;s Regular \nLeague.  There will be a waiting period of two weeks (fourteen days counting \nJune 22nd) for other sentient beings to enter into the contest.  You will be \nnotified when the first matches begin.  Good luck.&quot;\n\nFor Hot Rod:\n\n&quot;Thank you, Hot Rod, for entering the IGL&#39;s Regular League.  There will be \ntwo weeks until the first matches, in which time other people can enter and \nthen the fights can begin.  If you know of anyone who would be interested in \nparticipating, go ahead and urge them on.  Good luck.&quot;\n\n"}}
