But after this post, lets take it\nto non rpg email.\n\nAnyway, I dont know whats up with that game, but Sting has never been in\nWWF. I have is biography. He started in the indies, and then went to\nGerogia Championship Wrestling of the National Wrestling Alliance. He\nhas been there ever since, because Georgia Championship Wrestling became\nWorld Championship Wrestling.\n\nAnd KSL, you had to go insult WCW, the promotion that made me a fan. I\ngot into wrestling, watching WCW with my dad in 93. They have the most\namazing star and have always been the better promotion. You say they\nhave no talent, well DDP and Booker T. are the only extreamly good stars\nthey have now. But lets talk about AOL/Time Warner WCW.\nKevin Nash, Scott Hall, Bret Hart, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Scott\nSteiner, Rick Steiner, Arn Anderson, Ricky Steamboat, Sting, Curt\nHening, Rey Masterio Jr., Billy Kidman, Road Warriors, Dusty Rhodes,\nHulk Hogan, and the greatest wrestler of all time, the Nature Boy Ric\nFlair. Of course there are many I didn&#39;t mention.\n\nOh you dont know who Scott Steiner is, KSL? Well he signed with WWF and\nshould show up in a few months. You should be amazed. He got the mic\nskills, and as far as physical shape goes, there is not one man in WWF,\nWCW, or ECW that can match up.\n\n"}}
