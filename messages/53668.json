The \nsoft breeze barely ruffled her fur.. or what you call fur.\n\nHer clear blue optics took in everything that she could see whilst \nobserving the Predacon base.\n\nShe found it ironic. The Predacons she knew... so long ago... Were \nwild, ruthless, savage... Razorclaw, Rampage, Divebomb, Headstrong, \nTantrum. They had served well. Using the &#39;natural animal instinct&#39; to \nassist in their fighting. Funny though.. they were 100% robot. They \nwere fantastic warriors.\n\nBut these.. these who were now called Predacons... she would see if \nthey measured up to their predacessors.  \n\nHer optics observed the base. Waiting.. watching for any sign of \nHydras. She was curious about this supposed Leader. Or should she \nsay... leaders. &#39;If he really was Megatron...&#39; she pondered that \nthought for a moment. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt; Maxima soared through the air. It was natural, in a way, for her to \nbe \n&gt; flying. It was something she did for millions of years.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the ground sped past her below, her optics caught site of a \ncraft as she \n&gt; neared the Predacon base. \n&gt; \n&gt; Landing a few miles upon a ridge, she watched the craft, then her \noptics \n&gt; turned back to the base to observe. A pity that she still didn&#39;t \nhave her old \n&gt; form. She would be able to scan all that was going on, & with her \nstealth \n&gt; form, get closer. \n&gt; \n&gt; But for now... she was upon the ridge, observing. Waiting for \nher ... \n&gt; victum.. prey... this.. Hydras.\n\n\n"}}
