Her logic had not completely returned to realize \njust what had happened to her yet, but she knew that Prowl wasn&#39;t out to get \nher and was more concerned about her then himself.\nThere was a large lump on her shoulder, where the synthetic bone now stuck \nout.\n\nShe stopped les then a meter away from Prowl and simply bowed her head, a \ntired expression on her face. She was hurt, tired and confused.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
