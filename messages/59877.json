His luck had been with him \nfor \n&gt; the Maximals and Predacons had returned in a mass of glory and the \nPred \n&gt; had been estatic, returning to his rightful place next to Megatron.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now that Megatron had become Hydras, the bug bot had still stayed \nat \n&gt; his side, even if he did change and maybe become a bit meaner. But \nhe \n&gt; would still be a faithful Predacon. The large metal wasp buzzed \nabout \n&gt; the base, dropping to land on a nearby crate of some \nbots. &quot;Wazzpinator \n&gt; help,&quot; the bug bot buzzed. &quot;Wazzpinator help other botzz  build.&quot; \n&gt; Wasipinator gave a flutter of his wings. &quot;Wazzipinator do good, not \nbe \n&gt; blown up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: This was a post that was directed to some bots that were \ndeciding \n&gt; to build a weapon... I can&#39;t remember who they were sorry. Maybe \n&gt; someone could just stumble upon our little bot that would be good \ntoo \n&gt; lol\n&gt; \n&gt; OMWOS\n\n\n"}}
