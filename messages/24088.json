They are now up and viewable at http://nbwrpg.com\n&gt;\n&gt; If your character isn&#39;t on there and you are 100% sure that you\n&gt; submitted him/her/it via the form, inform me about it. If your\n&gt; character isn&#39;t up there and you have not submitted him/her/it via\n&gt; the form, submit him/her/it!\n&gt;\n&gt; Other than that, take a quick look. I also updated the events page.\n&gt; Oh, and if anyone leads a faction whose base isn&#39;t listem on the\n&gt; events page, email me with the location. Thanx!\n&gt;\n&gt; I GTG, but I&#39;ll be back soon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, and as KSL requested, lets pause the battle at the CF till he has\n&gt; a chance to post.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
