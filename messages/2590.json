She yawns, after all it was a \nlong day. She starts to head for her room. She then slaps herself in the \nhead. She doesn&#39;t have a room. she heads for the bridge to ask Zardus where \nher room is. She walked into the bridge, no Zardus. She goes outside and \nsees Zardus with a bunch of guys. She walks up to Zardus &quot;Where is my room, \ncommander&quot; sh then looks at Hell beast and gives a wink.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
