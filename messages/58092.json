Sorry I didn&#39;t post recently, but it&#39;s been one hell of a \nweek. I&#39;m already overwhelmed by homeworks! I&#39;m also afraid things \nwon&#39;t get better till the start of November. This means that I&#39;ll try \nposting as often as I can, but that these post will be few and not as \noften as I would like. To make things a little better, I&#39;ll lend my \nchars to those who would like them. \n\nTyrael, though, goes to Airly if she wants it. If not, then Robo gets \nhim. And if Robo can&#39;t, well, just make a contest! =P\n\nI&#39;d like Azure to go to Jeff.\n\nAs for Yggdrasil, Dreadplague, Clawstorm and Blackfang, share them \namong yourselves or tell me if you won&#39;t use them.\n\nThanks!\n\nNic\n\n\n"}}
