Quickstrike seemed to be taking care of the situation, \nbut the forest was getting hotter and they had little time.......:::\n\n::: TRANSANULAS ::: Enough of this! You can stay here and burn, but we shall \nnot!\n\n::: Still in his vheicle mode, the transmetal spider releases a batch of \nseveral cluster missles towrds Crow Lord and then speeds off as a nearby tree \nfalls to the ground ::::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: HELL BEAST looks to RAMPAGE ::: Ah, the battle begins. Rampage, I do hope \nyou know what your getting into, this can be very stressful. And Im sure you \ndo know any major damages to the ship, and other bots is your responsibility.\n\n::: He turns to the crew ::: Alright, call Bright Blade and Gangon, Pheniox, \nand Jackle. Tell them to return to base so we can attack, as well as all the \nother predacons.\n\n::: BLACK ARACNIA nods and begins to send the transmissions ::: \n\n::: GREMLIN looks to Mosquitor ::: Hey, are you ready to kick some Maximal \nass?\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: Gremlin, language....I do run a strict ship here.\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: MEGATRON blasts at Bright Blade from the cover of a large bolder, as Rat \nTrap fires at Gangon :::\n\n::: MEGATRON ::: Damn Predacons....they should have joined me!\n\n::: RAT TRAP ::: Yeah, but whats our next move?\n\n::: MEGATRON thinks for a moment ::: well, the Predacons are going to attack \nthe Maximals shortly....I suppose we can take advantage of this!\n\n::: RAT TRAP, between blasting at Gangon ::: How can we take advantage of \nthis?\n\n::: MEGATRON says with a grim smile ::: While they blast each other, we can \nsneak inside and get rid of the Auto-bots! At last, my mission will be \ncomplete....\n\n::: RAT TRAP ::: Ah...Im a former maximal....if that happenes I would \nkinda..die.\n\n::: MEGATRON says boldly ::: Your death will be remembered....your live given \nfor a greater cause. Predacon across the galaxy will celebrate your myrterdom.\n\n::: RAT TRAP ::: No...I dont think that might be such a good idea...I mean I \nwant to help the Predacons and all, but by me dying-\n\n::: MEGATRON grabs RAT TRAP ::: Silence! You will help or I will......just \npray i dont think of a more grousome death!\n\n::: RAT TRAP swallows and salutes MEGATRON. Now he was in troble, and he had \nto make sure he didnt die for MEGATRON&#39;s stupid cause...he would have to do \nsomething. :::\n\n"}}
