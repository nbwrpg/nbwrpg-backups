What\ndoes that have to do with NBW?\n\n--- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hull of the warship Bloody Fang\n&gt; Strana Mechty High Orbit\n&gt; Clan Space\n&gt; 3063\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Because we will in a perpetual state of war, combat\n&gt; is always the \n&gt; last judge. Ghost Bear warrior Ragnar will fight for\n&gt; the proposal, and \n&gt; Wolf warrior Vladimir Ward will fight against it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Seyla&quot; Vlad whispered the word, knowing that both\n&gt; his opponent and \n&gt; the Loremaster and pronounced it too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar. He had thought the freebirth to be stuck in\n&gt; the Inner Sphere \n&gt; with the Warden Clan Wolf in exile, but the Ghost\n&gt; Bear had taken him \n&gt; as a bondsman and made him a Star Colonel in their\n&gt; Alpha Galaxy. He \n&gt; had been the prot�g� of his nemesis, Phelan Kell,\n&gt; the much hated \n&gt; freeborn Khan of those renegade Wolves, which made\n&gt; Vlad even more \n&gt; eager to slay him...\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya Kerensky of Clan Wolf rode in her new\n&gt; Solitaire battlemech. She \n&gt; had been selected to be the loremaster for this\n&gt; trial and had chosen \n&gt; to test the new light mech. Though it was a complete\n&gt; change from her \n&gt; Timber Wolf omnimech (the same her Khan had in this\n&gt; battle) she was \n&gt; used to, both because of its 50 tons less, its\n&gt; reduced armament and \n&gt; its awesome speed, she liked the mech so far.\n&gt; She evaluated the warriors. Vlad had a powerful\n&gt; Timber Wolf. If any \n&gt; mech could match speed, armor and firepower, this\n&gt; one could. Bristling \n&gt; with two box of missiles on each shoulder and lasers\n&gt; on each arm,the \n&gt; birdlike mech was a threat. Still, Ragnar was better\n&gt; armed. He manned \n&gt; a Dire Wolf, a heavier version of the Timber Wolf,\n&gt; and probably the \n&gt; most feared machine in known space. At 100 tons, the\n&gt; juggernaut was \n&gt; armed to the teeth, with a gauss rifle, a heavy\n&gt; autocannon and lots of \n&gt; lasers. It was slower, though, and thus, would have\n&gt; more trouble \n&gt; tracking the Khan. Only the pilots could tell the\n&gt; odds...\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: Skill, warriors. The trial begins now!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar sent his metal titan walking forward, sending\n&gt; a volley of \n&gt; lasers at his opponent. He was thanked by laserfire\n&gt; and a swarm of \n&gt; missiles. He knew Vlad would try to hurt him by any\n&gt; means possible, \n&gt; both because of what he stood for and because he had\n&gt; once been the \n&gt; Prince of an Inner Sphere realm, captured by Clan\n&gt; Wolf. He knew that \n&gt; rushing would only make him lose his target, so he\n&gt; preferred to close \n&gt; into range and hurt his foe with what he could.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet, as the fighting went on, no one noticed the\n&gt; energy wave coming \n&gt; in. It had taken millions of years to reach this far\n&gt; in the universe, \n&gt; having originated from the explosion of an empty\n&gt; moon.\n&gt; \n&gt; The wave hit first the mechs, then the ship, setting\n&gt; off the \n&gt; Kearny-Fuchida drives that enabled hyperspace jumps.\n&gt; Within seconds, \n&gt; the massive destruction machines vanished from the\n&gt; skies of Strana \n&gt; Mechty, three Clan officers along with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
