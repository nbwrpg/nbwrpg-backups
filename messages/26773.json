The boosters weren&#39;t \nstrong enough to be any good in earth gravity, but they were perfect \nfor space.\n\nHe watches Astroblast avoid the LA2, seeing Koj on top of it. Aiming \nhis EMP cannon, he fires at Koj.\n\n&quot;What exactly are we looking for here?&quot; he asks Motormaster as he \nfires again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKoj&#39;s eyes widen in surprise as an EMP shot hits his feet, making him \nlose the grip on the LA2 and fall off. He spins around, heading for \nKillfest with his sword ready.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer exits behind Killfest, similar boosters emerging from his \nback, below his tentacles. Two missile launchers flip out of his \nshoulders, firing at Koj. Koj ducks under, but the missiles circle \nback, heading for their target again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe LA2 shakes as shots hit the top and sides of it, blowing off a \nfew panels.\n\n&quot;Stay in the ship, Dark, I&#39;m going out to fight,&quot; Liono tells his \nbrother, opening a hatch and jumping out, firing three shots at \nMotormaster.\n\nWith the LA2&#39;s top smoking from the hit, Dark aims the cannons, \nfiring at Astroblast again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe stasis pods containing Key, Riona, and BlueStinger exit the \natmosphere, heading for the Ark.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWith a flash, Scyther&#39;s shuttle exits transwarp, several dozen miles \naway from the Ark. He checks the scanners, seeing that Killfest was \nin a battle nearby.\n\n&quot;Ah, it seems like we get our first battle,&quot; he says to the two other \nbots in the shuttle while he manuevers it closer to the Ark.\n\nIncarcinator, one of the other bots in the shuttle with Scyther, \nstands up. He was about a dozen feet tall, and the material that his \nbody consisted of was translucent, so he was a bit seethrough. He \nsmiles. &quot;Excellent. Out of prison and already slaggin&#39; bots!&quot;\n\nIncarcinator takes out a large rifle from his back compartment. The \nrifle was a mean looking weapon, with many attachments on it. It was \nmade of the same material as Incarcinator. With a silent command from \nthe bot, Incarcinator&#39;s armor slowly turns completely black. He waits \nfor them to get to the battle.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Yanshosh, would Motormaster&#39;s wounds be healed yet? I&#39;m not \nsure.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; Motormaster leaps out of the shuttle into nothingness of space, and\n&gt; manuvers himself around to fire on the attacking ship. He pulls the \ntrigger\n&gt; twice as he opens his commlink. &quot;You better not leave me out here \nafter the\n&gt; fight Astroblast. Or I might drift away from earth.&quot; He states, \nmore of a\n&gt; command than a joke.\n\n\n"}}
