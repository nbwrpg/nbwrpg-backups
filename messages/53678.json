The\n&gt;soft breeze barely ruffled her fur.. or what you call fur.\n&gt;\n&gt;Her clear blue optics took in everything that she could see whilst\n&gt;observing the Predacon base.\n&gt;\n&gt;She found it ironic. The Predacons she knew... so long ago... Were\n&gt;wild, ruthless, savage... Razorclaw, Rampage, Divebomb, Headstrong,\n&gt;Tantrum. They had served well. Using the &#39;natural animal instinct&#39; to\n&gt;assist in their fighting. Funny though.. they were 100% robot. They\n&gt;were fantastic warriors.\n&gt;\n&gt;But these.. these who were now called Predacons... she would see if\n&gt;they measured up to their predacessors.\n&gt;\n&gt;Her optics observed the base. Waiting.. watching for any sign of\n&gt;Hydras. She was curious about this supposed Leader. Or should she\n&gt;say... leaders. &#39;If he really was Megatron...&#39; she pondered that\n&gt;thought for a moment.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Maxima soared through the air. It was natural, in a way, for her to\n&gt;be\n&gt; &gt; flying. It was something she did for millions of years.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As the ground sped past her below, her optics caught site of a\n&gt;craft as she\n&gt; &gt; neared the Predacon base.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Landing a few miles upon a ridge, she watched the craft, then her\n&gt;optics\n&gt; &gt; turned back to the base to observe. A pity that she still didn&#39;t\n&gt;have her old\n&gt; &gt; form. She would be able to scan all that was going on, & with her\n&gt;stealth\n&gt; &gt; form, get closer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But for now... she was upon the ridge, observing. Waiting for\n&gt;her ...\n&gt; &gt; victum.. prey... this.. Hydras.\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Fotos: la forma m�s f�cil de compartir e imprimir fotos.  \nhttp://photos.msn.es/support/worldwide.aspx\n\n\n"}}
