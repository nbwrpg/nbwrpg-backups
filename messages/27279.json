Yet I am trapped, for the first time in Millions of\nyears have been outsmarted. This Galvatron has evolved to become cool and\ncalculating. He was not the same that left the Decepticon Empire in ruin in\nthe year 2007. There is much I dont know, and I acted rather rashly\nearlier. I should learn about my enemy before I challenge him. And if I do\ndefeat him, what of the Decepticon empire. Is there anything left for me to\nrebuild. Was my dream that easily crushed. &quot;Arggggg&quot; he screamed as he\npulled his hand back and thrust it forward, releasing a torent of nuclear\nenergy from it. The blast bore into a mountain side, wiping out the base of\nit. With no support, the mountain began to crumble. &quot;No, I am the Mighty\nMegatron, the Decepticons cannot be stopped, I will escape Galvatrons\ncontrol, and find someone to follow me&quot; he screamed to no one in\nperticular. He then started to near the Destron base, he opened a commlink,\n&quot;Magmatron, it is Megatron, demanding permission to enter&quot; he then looked\ndowncast and his face erupted in a sneer, &quot;as youre subordinate&quot;.\n\n\n\n"}}
