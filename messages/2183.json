Lauguidhing, since he had a big huge hole\nin\n&gt; his middle (which, will undoubtedly kill him), the lasers merely hitting\nthe\n&gt; wall behind him (though pieces of the wall piercing into his back,\nStinkbomb\n&gt; was way gone so he couldn&#39;t even feel it).  Not even wondering how Suukie\n&gt; mystically got repaired, he shoved his heavy laser rifle up to diagonally\nat\n&gt; the bottom of Suukie&#39;s chin (though a few millimeters away), pulling the\n&gt; trigger repeatedly, slashing his seringed and very deadly tail up at the\n&gt; middle of Suukie&#39;s chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------\n&gt;\n&gt;     Ramhorn, stepped into the armory of the Ark, not seeing anyone on the\n&gt; way.  -Dang, it&#39;s a ghost ship- the temporarily insane robot thinking,\ncoming\n&gt; back into reality, no longer crazy.  &quot;Stinkbomb, by Primus, what have I\n&gt; done!&quot; he yelled, grabbing a missile launcher and running as fast as his\n&gt; damaged legs could carry him, each &#39;step&#39; banging against the &#39;ancient&#39;\nmetal\n&gt; flooor, stopping at the door of the Ark gradually, the door slid up\n&gt; automatically, the Maximal running in, seeing the fight between Suukie.\n&gt; Yelling, &quot;Stinkbomb, hold on, I&#39;ll kill the traitor!&quot;, he raised the\nmissile\n&gt; launcher, stopping 6 feet behind Suukie, firing off a rocket at the\nmiddile\n&gt; of his back, swearing in ancient Cybertronian (a way Ramhorn likes to show\n&gt; off to everyone).\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Phone bills too big?
