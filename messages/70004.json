He had learn=\r\ned it in Ninjabot training.  He could hear the hum of the stunner beam and =\r\nlike Tucson, he maneuvers quickly, with a quick squat, ducking himself lowe=\r\nr than the beam, allowing it to go right over his head.  He was fast in his=\r\n motions, perhaps just slightly faster than Tucson, but it was still hard t=\r\no tell.  He wastes no time in transforming and alternates between SUV mode =\r\nand Robot mode to manuever away from his captives.  \n\n&quot;Slag, talk about a b=\r\naaad day.&quot;  \n\nOutside, now not far from the black fortress, going as fast a=\r\ns his wheels will carry him, Tucson Prime rushes to get to his comrade who =\r\nstill struggles to get out of the fortress in one piece.  Rat Trap anxiousl=\r\ny prepares for arrival as does Quickstride who loads up his cannons anticip=\r\nating a good fight.\n\n&quot;Y&#39;know, I think you should let them know you&#39;re commi=\r\nng, Sir. That should stir things up a bit.&quot;\n\nTucson gives Quickstride&#39;s sug=\r\ngestion deep thought.\n\n&quot; Actually, that&#39;s not a bad idea.  Why didn&#39;t I thi=\r\nnk of that?&quot;\n\nRat Trap grins, and points to his massive horn.\n\n&quot; Well, you&#39;=\r\nre a big truck, and big trucks have big loud horns.. C&#39;mon let&#39;s hear it, I=\r\n bet that&#39;ll really shake &#39;em up.&quot;\n\nTucson picks up speed as he nears the f=\r\nortress.  And then, lets loose his horn, which blasts through the air, crea=\r\nting a vibrating effect within his radius.  He sounds the horn in long inte=\r\nrvals, like an eighteen wheeler barreling into the next truck stop.  The ho=\r\nrn&#39;s sound alone, mimics that of Optimus Prime.\n\nQuickstride and Rat Trap h=\r\nang out the windows with weapons in hand.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve been waitn&#39; a long time f=\r\nor this! SO WHO&#39;S GONNA RUN SCARED NOW HUH?!&quot;\n\nRat Trap adds to the excitem=\r\nent as he hangs out Tucson Prime&#39;s driver&#39;s side window.\n\n&quot;HERE COMES THE C=\r\nAVALRY!  HEY, WHEELS, C&#39;MON, WARNING SHOT, WARNING SHOT!&quot;\n\nTucson Prime lin=\r\nes up his missile cannons for a warning ground shot, just a few miles away =\r\nfrom the fortress, hoping that hitting the ground will be enough to grab Hy=\r\ndra&#39;s attention.  He fires one missile at the ground, and then another, hit=\r\nting the land around it from in front and landing a missile which appears t=\r\no be guided, in back of the fortress, shaking up more than just the ground.=\r\n\n\nRat Trap dances in place.\n\n&quot;WHOO, HOOO! THAT&#39;S WHAT I CALL A WARNING SHOT=\r\n!&quot;\n\nTucson doesn&#39;t say much, but now comes very close to the base.\n\n&quot;Guys, =\r\nI have to let you off here, no offense.&quot;\n\nThe maximals nodd as they disemba=\r\nrch from Tucson Prime&#39;s cab and no sooner do they get out, he transforms in=\r\nto robot mode.  He stands outside, with missile chambers still smoking from=\r\n the warning shots.  As he&#39;s transformed, the missile chambers appear to be=\r\n attatched to his arms, which meant he could fire those at will if he wante=\r\nd to.  Yet, he refrains as Optimus Prime would have done.  Rat Trap and Qui=\r\nckstride remain close, waiting for his next command.\n\n&quot; We wait here, I&#39;m s=\r\nure someone is going to want to come out and investigate the premisis.&quot;\n\nHe=\r\n looks to a crater he had just left behind by the firing of the warning sho=\r\nt to the ground.  He knew they&#39;d come, it was only a matter of when.  In th=\r\ne mean time he transmits to Lord Elder.\n\n&quot;Lord Elder, I&#39;m at the dark fortr=\r\ness now.  If you see Kup, tell him to proceed with caution and remain behin=\r\nd me, in case I need backup.  I don&#39;t want him risking his spark on my acco=\r\nunt.  I started this, I need to finish it.&quot;\n\nHe looks to Rat Trap and Quick=\r\nstride.\n\n&quot;You two, I&#39;ll need you out here for diversionary tactics duty.  T=\r\nhe more of a distraction you guys can muster, the better a chance we have o=\r\nf getting Nightshift out of here in one piece.&quot;\n\nThey salute and do as told=\r\n.  Tucson waits, standing strong, as the sun shimmers off his silver armor.=\r\n  He takes the time to think, and on his mind, even more so than bringing H=\r\nydras to Justice, was the fact that Cyclonus had to pay for his crimes agai=\r\nnst Rodimus.  He had stolen the energy of his matrix, taken a power that di=\r\nd not belong to him, and Tucson Prime knew he was NOT going to stand for it=\r\n. He grits his teeth, the anger was just too much to keep in.  He stares an=\r\ngrilly at the black fortress and then out of nowhere, with a voice as power=\r\nful as Optimus Prime&#39;s..\n\n&quot;CYCLONUS!&quot;\n\nHis voice thunders like a high magni=\r\ntude quake.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: SCOURGE, SCORPONOK - Hydras, Nightshift\n&gt; Location: Bl=\r\nack Fortress - Hydras&#39; Throne Room\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hydras Hissed in Pain and taking =\r\nhis gun he opened fireagainst Nightshift, he yelled &quot;With the exception of =\r\nthe leadership, I&#39;ll grant one wish to the predacon that kill this SCUM and=\r\n I&#39;ll promote him to the second in command rank!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Scorponok groaned=\r\n as the attack from Nightshift struck home!
