She turned \nover \n&gt; and transformed into wolf mode in her sleep.  She moaned and \nmuttered \n&gt; in her sleep, tossed and turned as her mind reeled in visions that \n&gt; would make Unicron scared. \n&gt; \n&gt; She finally woke up and got out of bed.  She stretched her front \npaws \n&gt; out and arched her back.  She walked out of her room and was about \nto \n&gt; go to the mess hall. She stopped dead in her tracks as her optics \n&gt; widened with the a thought. &quot;I didn&#39;t go to bed last night. I was \nin \n&gt; the lab. How in the pit did I make it to my room if I never left \nthe \n&gt; lab?&quot;  She went back to her room. She could sniff the scent of \nMalice \n&gt; still lingering on the side of the bed where he brushed up putting \n&gt; her on it. She grinned and starting back to the mess hall. &quot;Uh huh, \n&gt; yeah, he&#39;s a softy alright. But I won&#39;t let him know that I know \n&gt; that.&quot;  She muttered to herself.  She went to the mess hall and \n&gt; transformed into bot mode. She got herself some hot energon and sat \n&gt; down at a table, trying to wake up.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Malice was jolted awake from Campflage&#39;s sream, and fell off his \n&gt; bed with a very loud thud.  He picked himself up off the floor and \n&gt; stood up too fast, stumbled a second, then went out the door.  He \n&gt; went looking for Camoflage, but was unsucessful.  He then found \n&gt; Wolfblade fast asleep at a work bench.  He picked her up and took \nher \n&gt; to his quarters.  He set he on the bed and retrieved the generator \n&gt; she was working on.  He set it on the night stand, and went to the \n&gt; cargo bay.  He found a cargo net strong enough to support his \n&gt; weight.  He took it back to his quarters, string it up as a \nhammock, \n&gt; grabbed the alarm clock, climbed into the hammock, hit the lights, \n&gt; and went to sleep.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:Wolfblade:\n&gt; &gt; She yawned and kept working.

Goodnight.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice walked down some halls and found his way to his \ntemporary \n&gt; &gt; quarters.  He opened the door and stepped in.  He sat down on the \n&gt; &gt; edge of the bed, and sat quiet for a moment.  then he pulled the \n&gt; &gt; energon storage and put it on top of the locker.  He opened the \n&gt; &gt; locker and snapped off another chunk of energon.  He leaned back \non \n&gt; &gt; the bed, crunching on the energon.  He finished it, found an \nalarm \n&gt; &gt; clock, set it, and went to sleep.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She worked trying to put together the magnet and improve it to \n&gt; work \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for it&#39;s purpose. &quot;No thanks.

I&#39;d have done the same thing. \nI \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t admit it though.&quot;  She looked back at the table and \n&gt; &gt; resumed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her work. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
