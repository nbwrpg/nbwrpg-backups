I think a\n&gt; more conditional rule needs to be imposed. That is\n&gt; athat all players in the vicinity of a scene must be\n&gt; given upto 24 hours to reply to any post. This kills\n&gt; off two birds with one stone- firstly it stops flood\n&gt; posting and second it forces people to post every\n&gt; day.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Jerame Johnson &lt;jeramej@...&gt; wrote: &gt; Nic,\n&gt; I got an Ideal for the posting, How about\n&gt; &gt; limiting it to like five post a day. I mean that\n&gt; &gt; might be better. I mean I am soo Confused with the\n&gt; &gt; ammount of post. I have SBC Yahoo DSL and I got in\n&gt; &gt; the matter of five minutes like 12 mails from the\n&gt; &gt; same source. Man it&#39;s gotta stop. I have schoool\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; work . It takes up most of my time right now and\n&gt; &gt; when I check out my post then I got like 40+ post\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; my inbox. And it like blows. I am bout ready to\n&gt; walk\n&gt; &gt; away from this game.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nic, I think the flood posting thing has gotten\n&gt; &gt; beyond\n&gt; &gt; the point of discussion, with the current modding\n&gt; &gt; going on (at the risk of pointing fingers, airly\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; shadowess agoth are by far the worst offenders at\n&gt; &gt; this), how the heck am I meant to get a fair\n&gt; chance\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; reply to posts. I think you need to set a ruling\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; stone on this because it&#39;s clear that discussion\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; pointless with the nothing coming of it. I think a\n&gt; &gt; rule needs to be set that if a player is not given\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; fair chance to reply, then any posts beyond the\n&gt; &gt; point\n&gt; &gt; of a realistic reply (as in anything that would\n&gt; &gt; exceed\n&gt; &gt; time periods where characters reply if the\n&gt; situation\n&gt; &gt; were real) be declared VOID. Because I currently\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; see how I can continue in this RPG when I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; a fair chance to reply.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://greetings.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
