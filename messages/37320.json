He knew the Council enjoyed the relay of information he sent\nthem, as they needed to get going. When he heard the explosions, he came\nright away, the Autobots were so busy, they didnt notice him crouch and\ntake in the info. He stood up, and streched out his arms, they made a\ngurgling noise of oil popping. He then transformed into his Ape mode,\nand leapt gracefully from one rooftop, to another, then leapt down, and\ngrabbed ahold of some steel gurders, to quietly move himself down. Once\nat the ground, he ran a few streets down, then transformed into his jet\nmode, and took off towards Predacon territory.\n\n"}}
