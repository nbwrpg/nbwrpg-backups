This was definetly not\n&gt; good. Prebon seemed to be stationary and functioning, but the unknown\n&gt; bots moving Blaze and Bullet could pose a problem. He&#39;d have to deal\n&gt; with that later; Prebon was top priority for now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Slayer walks back to the CR area, checking on Iguanus&#39;s status. As\n&gt; soon as the bot was out of the CR, Slayer would go get Prebon, and\n&gt; perhaps Blaze and Bullet as well, though that would have to wait.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The TRainer ship opens a full scan of the planet looking for the\n&gt; leader.
