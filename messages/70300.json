Since as it was discovered, the Black Fortress is in\nEurope, and as we know the Ark is in North America. I believe that at\nthe point in time NBW&#39;s takes place that there is a land bound route\nfrom the US to Europe, but it would take a very long time to traverse\nit. :)\n\nBIC:\nQuickstride and Straight Shot find it relatively easy to reach the\narea that Tuscon, Perceptor and Legacy are. The Ark&#39;s side of the\ncavern is steep and sheer, but here on the European side, near the\nBlack fortress, it is sloped enough that a vehicle could drive up\nwithout too much difficulty.\n\nAhead of Quickstride and Straight Shot, Legacy had been silent during\nthe trip so far, seemingly content to let the others take the lead.\nHis sensors had also locked in on Rodimus for a moment, and then like\nthe others lost him.\n\n&quot;Rodimus appeared to be in critical condition.&quot; Legacy said as he\nwalked, his cold cyclopean gaze attempting to pierce into the darkness\nahead. &quot;I did not get an exact enough scan of that creature that held\nhim to get a positive identification, however I have no information on\nwhat I gave scanned.&quot;\n\nTuscon&#39;s headlights stretched far ahead into the darkness, but beyond\nthe reach of them there was only darkness, or cave wall where the path\nbent and turned. The venting steam that had obscured their vision had\nslowed and then finally stopped. Ahead of them the tunnel appeared\nclear, although there was still little sign of Rodimus or his apparent\nabductor, save for the occasional scrape of metal on stone.\n\nThe noxious smell of magma still fills the air making the bean pod gas\nfrom Quickstride hardly noticeable, mixed in as it was with all the\nother strange odors. Also heat from the surrounding walls and floor\nmake this area very hot even for transformers, although it is still\nbearable.\n\nAhead of Tuscon, Perceptor and Legacy some sort of movement of several\ncreatures can be made out, it does not look like Rodimus  . . .\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
