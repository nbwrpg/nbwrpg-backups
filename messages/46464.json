Hottie4u2have, everything you do \nrequires a post to go with it. If you want to set a trap, then you \nhave to say that your character is setting a trap. Since you didn&#39;t \npost in advance for setting traps, it is really up to Jonathan to \ndetermine whether he minds that there are traps to slow his escape.\n\nDon&#39;t worry about your mistakes, they happen. Even for experienced \nRPers they happen on occasion. Making a mistake means nothing, \nlearning from your errors, is absolutely cruicial. =)\n\nAs I recall, Lynxiz was waiting on the north side of the base, under \na tree and therefore must see Panthos.\n\n-- Lynxiz --\n\nLynxiz perks up as an unknown panther bot comes into view. &quot;Lynxiz \nTransform.&quot; She murmurs quietly. Her form folds, and paws become \npowerful arms and legs. She frowns, &quot;Who are you?&quot; Wary, but not \nentirely battle ready, she looks over the bot. She is surprised when \nher mild sensors pick up that he is a Maximal. &quot;You&#39;re a maximal! I \nheard the base fire off a few shots, do you know what happened?&quot; \nLynxiz was almost at ease after that last discovery.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC:\n&gt; \n&gt; When did you set these traps up and the posts saying Cheetara did \nso?
