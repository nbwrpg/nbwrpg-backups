This \nwas practice, he didn&#39;t want to force her into a struggle for life and \ndeath.\nDinobot thought that he would give her a chance to give up before he was \nforced to damage her and cause mech fluid to flow.*\n\n&quot; Surrender or sustain more damage!&quot;\n\n* He waited for a reply, he WOULD hurt her if she chose to continue.\nPart of being a warrior was learning how to take pain!*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
