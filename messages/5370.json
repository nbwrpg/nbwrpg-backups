She didn&#39;t like the \nidea of someone scanning her transmissions, especially when she didn&#39;t know \nwho was scanning.  She walked around hoping to find someone who survived.  \nShe hoped that Lunarpine was alright where ever he was.  He hoped he didn&#39;t \nrun into trouble out there.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
