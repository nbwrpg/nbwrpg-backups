She blinked rapidly, a look of \nconfusion on her face.\n\n&quot;Uh.. what are you doing?&quot; She asked carefully, peeking round her \nfriends body to peer at the hole and the pigs that lay by her feet. \nRealization caught on. &quot;Oh! You&#39;re burying the chow.. I get it&quot; She \ngrinned, and kept silent for a few seconds. But she never could keep \nsilent for a long time, unless she was asleep or knocked out.\n\nThe Fuzor thought back to the way Carnage had reacted when she had \ntripped over the branch, and she winced. She opened her mouth \nslightly, as if to say something, but stopped and shut it again.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry for being such a kid..&quot; She said, so sudden that it \nstarteled even her. Where had that come from? &quot;You must think I have \nthe brain of a three year old&quot; Teltoli snorted &quot;Come to think of it, \nI probably do. You&#39;re getting sick of me, I can tell. Um.. all I&#39;m \nsaying is..&quot;\n\nShe let out a heavy sigh. &quot;Can you teach me how to fight? Like, \nproperly? My dad taught me the basics.. but obviously you can handle \nyourself in a battle. I can&#39;t, I mean seeing the way that I ran away \nfrom the Alliance/Maximal fight.. I can&#39;t believe I did that.. but \ncan you teach me?&quot;\n\nHer sentances had stumbled out in a rush, almost as if she had to say \nthem before she would change her mind. She was a teenager, in an \nadults world, and she was struggling. Sure, she could fight, she knew \nbasic tactics.. but basics didn&#39;t get you hardly anywhere in a war.\n\nThe Fuzor had never been in a war, short of the minature ones on \nEarth, so she could hardly say she had experiance. Her best tactic \nwas undercover work, she excelled at that. Having a lithe and very \nflexible body, she was perfect for that kind of stuff. But hard war.. \nand injuries.. she couldn&#39;t handle.\n\n\n"}}
