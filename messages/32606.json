Cruelty to animals wasn&#39;t a good\n&gt;thing to watch, but some people still did it.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;That&#39;s ok,&quot; she replied to Vlad. She wanted to know more about this place,\n&gt;though, so she guessed that finding out this robot&#39;s name would be a good\n&gt;idea. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; Antagony asked curiously in a polite tone.
