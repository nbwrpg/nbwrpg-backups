Tankor and Kyle, stop it, now. Kyle, please explain how Mustex got beyond Alliance shields. The only post from you dealing with how he got there was filled with extreme moding, and I didn&#39;t see another one. Mustex can&#39;t magically teleport, so I can&#39;t see a logical way that he would be walking around Alliance Island.\n\nAnd everyone who&#39;s been disrespectful to other RPGers, please stop. I&#39;ve deleted all the polls I think are offending, like the &quot;Who&#39;s the worse RPGer&quot; one. Please don&#39;t make any more.\n\n::Zardus/FZ::\n\nZardus nods. &quot;Of course.&quot;\n\nThe shields flash back to full strength, but a section in front of Chaostaur fades off, letting him in if he wanted.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s a section of the shields open, Orchestra,&quot; Zardus says over the comm, &quot;You can enter through that.&quot;\n\n&quot;I have some matters to take care of first,&quot; he transmits to Frostbite at the same time as sending a transmission to Orchestra, &quot;I may be late.&quot;\n\nHe turns, nodding at Daemos. &quot;Allright. I&#39;ll contact him. My troops will get themselves to the IGL, but thanks for the offer.&quot;\n\nHe watches Daemos fly off, making a mental note to send a transmission to this new commander as soon as he was done with Chaostaur.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ looks over Najah. &quot;Very good, Najah. The IGL is starting very soon. You can take a shuttle if you wish.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
