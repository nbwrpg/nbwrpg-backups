He catches the edge of the hole with his forepaws and pulls \nhimself through.  He leaps down in time to see them flying off still \nlaughing.  &quot;The cowards will pay!&quot;  He starts to transform but decides \nagainst it as he can move faster and quieter in this mode.  He follows them \nkeeping out of sight to wherever they are going.\n\n"}}
