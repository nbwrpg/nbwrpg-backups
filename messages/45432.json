I want to be an\nArcheologist (an even harder word to spell I need to\nget a dictionary), and I have a theory about where\nAtlantis is.  By the way if I find a way to incoporate\nit into the game and I admit where my theory puts it\nno ones going to copy me (granted it was only suppose\nto sink in 10,000 B.C. more or less and some people\nthink an extra 0 was added on over the ages_/\n\n--- x_rauq_x &lt;x_rauq_x@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; No nukes, the Infecticon cannon can&#39;t be fired any\n&gt; more, Iron Fist&#39;s \n&gt; weapon doesn&#39;t get used, (don&#39;t ya&#39; hate it when the\n&gt; other side \n&gt; feels that you don&#39;t need a nuke, or an extrememly\n&gt; large weapon for \n&gt; that matter).

A\n&gt; nuke\n&gt; &gt; you could only use once and overall would be less\n&gt; &gt; damaging.
