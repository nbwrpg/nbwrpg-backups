We\n&gt; &gt; steal the energon shelding device they&#39;ll inevitably have to use \nand\n&gt; &gt; force them to stay in Beast Mode constantly.  Then while they \nsleep\n&gt; &gt; the Beast Modes will take over leaving them helpless and at our\n&gt; &gt; mercy.  We can then use parts from there ship to repair our own \nand\n&gt; &gt; get the Pit out of here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; {Talos}\n&gt; Deck 2, CR Chamber\n&gt; \n&gt; Talos considered Sunhawks words motioning him to relax. &quot;First we \nhave to\n&gt; find the stolen ship and deal with the predicons, as is we need \nsome recon.\n&gt; Since the sensors are up at least for a certain range we should be \nable to\n&gt; spot any forces en route if they&#39;re within weapons fire range. Do \nsome recon\n&gt; outside, recruit another bot or two if you need, try and find a good\n&gt; location for construction of a sensor enhancement tower, the longer \nsight\n&gt; and comm range we have the more secure our position will be.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Turning he adjusted the comm for a ship wide broadcast and \nfinding\n&gt; repairs already showing a noticeable improvement in the operations,\n&gt; &quot;Excellent work people, we have some scanning ability, comms should \nbe\n&gt; repaired fully soon and then we can get back to our primary \nmission. When\n&gt; finished with your current activities report to the mess hall, I&#39;m \nsure you\n&gt; could all use some energon and rest. That is all...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Looking back at Sunhawk, &quot;And you have your new orders \nlieutenant, a\n&gt; prime spot for the signal enhancer is extremely important.
