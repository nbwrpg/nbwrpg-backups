See ya in\n&gt; the real world!\n&gt; \n&gt; Bic:\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael was intrigued. How could three bases be on\n&gt; this planet? Ho \n&gt; well, they&#39;ll have to destroy one more, nothing\n&gt; more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Very well, Naga. You will stay here to guard\n&gt; the base. Shadow \n&gt; Star, you will command group Tripod, with you and\n&gt; Burrock. You will \n&gt; attack the most northern base (ooc: maxies). Talon\n&gt; and me, as group \n&gt; Trian, will attack the nearest one (ooc: preddies).\n&gt; Remember, this is \n&gt; a hit and run. Our objectives are to pinpoint them\n&gt; and hit hard if \n&gt; possible. Break off the engagement at any signs of\n&gt; heavy defense. \n&gt; Everyone ready?\n&gt; \n&gt; Burrock: An attack already... I think I might like\n&gt; you, lightbird! Any \n&gt; casualties allowed?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Just as long as its not one of you, the\n&gt; more, the better.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;black_ben14&quot; &lt;black_ben14@h...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ooc:sorry guys this will be my last post.After\n&gt; that I would like \n&gt; rauq \n&gt; &gt; to take me out of NBWRPG.I&#39;m giving my chars to\n&gt; whoever wants them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:~Naga~\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He checked the scanner and after a few moment he\n&gt; turns to Tyrael \n&gt; &quot;Sir \n&gt; &gt; the scanner have found 3 bases(the Decepticon dont\n&gt; seem so alive).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
