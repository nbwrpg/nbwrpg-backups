Like Robo, and \n&gt; Azure, I&#39;m also going to be inactive for a few days. I&#39;m leaving \nfor \n&gt; the university I&#39;m attending on the 31st. (School starts on the 4th)\n&gt; \n&gt; That means that I&#39;m going to be inactive for 3-4 days, probably \n&gt; starting tomorrow. I&#39;m going to post today though. ^^\n\n\n"}}
