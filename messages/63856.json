Why\nnot have something happen and they get sent into the future. Or moved\nto a different planet all together? Hmmm, the thought plickens. \nBut I&#39;ll post three times a week or more as needed. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, rm2kmidi &lt;kraftlos@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; :-/ I don&#39;t really like the idea of going 100 years ahead in time, but\n&gt; I&#39;m up for as many posts as you want ^_^\n&gt; \n&gt; On 5/17/05, Airly &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I ok this is a important note.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Looking that things are getting a little boring in NBW and In\norder to cheer\n&gt; &gt; this up, doing things more intersting and concentrate in doing\ngood posts\n&gt; &gt; instead a big amount of posts, Azure and I were discusing some\n`points that\n&gt; &gt; will change this.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The point is as Azure said &quot;the problem here is that the\ncharacters are\n&gt; &gt; alone. they don&#39;t have any society with which they can interact.\nwhat I\n&gt; &gt; suggest is this: either change the story by advancing 100 years in the\n&gt; &gt; future or change the place. what should be done is that there\ncould be a few\n&gt; &gt; cities, but not only Maximal City and Predacon City. There would\nbe neutral\n&gt; &gt; ones also where shadowy dealings could be made&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Also NPC&#39;s chars are including in this idea that will change this RPG.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Question is that I  need to know who will post at least once a\nweek, &#39;cause\n&gt; &gt; this will help to delevelop to this idea. This and the new plot\nwill affect\n&gt; &gt; all chars involved in this RPG and will let a major interacion\namong chars\n&gt; &gt; and result a major fun\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; :)\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; What do you think?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; *   Airly   *\n&gt; &gt; ***********\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
