While I&#39;m at it, LN, can you please send the council \nexplainations for all of your weapons on your bots. We discussed \nyour ships, but your bots may be pushing our power limits. \n\nAlso, can you please try to keep your posts reasonable, words like \n&quot;massive&quot; (and especially when combined with &quot;powerful&quot;) make \nyour bots sound generally much more powerful than the other bots. \nYou may not think so but you aren&#39;t the one reading the post and \nthe one making the decision of how to respond. \n\nYour post with Gemini Dragon where he kicked Train Wreck was a \nmode, you posted for the kick hitting (which is illegal). You&#39;ve got \nto make an attempt when you attack.\n\nOrchid (and btw no need yell MODE k? =) was right in the sense \nthat all of the bots coming and helping the Chivitrons was cheap, \nbut it is incorrect to say that the Chivitrons themselves are cheap, \nthat would be a false stereotype of the group as a whole. The \nChivitrons are made up of many bots, not just one cheap one. =P\n\n\nOn 15 Jul 2001, at 2:00, Legendarynemasis@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Gestalts are allowed to be much bigger, Yan said 50 feet was the\n&gt; maximum and Gemini Dragon is 45 feet tall. its Gemini 1 and 2\n&gt; combined.\n\n"}}
