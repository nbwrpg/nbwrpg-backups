The \n&gt; base part... alright yeah... that was moding... ignoring other \npeople, bad \n&gt; form though not technically moding.  As for the shots against \nPerceptor... He \n&gt; is Airly&#39;s character thus it is her place to complain about them.  \nShould she \n&gt; desire to raise a complaint, that is her right.  It is no one \nelse&#39;s place to \n&gt; complain about it.  Trust me, if something is bothering Airly \nshe&#39;ll let \n&gt; someone know.\n&gt; \n&gt;        That said, it is all rather moot because they shouldn&#39;t \nhave been \n&gt; inside the base to begin with.  In all honesty I don&#39;t have time \nright now to \n&gt; figure out where they should be.  I&#39;m going to leave that up to \nthe \n&gt; participants and/or the other members of the council to work out.  \nI need to \n&gt; go study for an AP test first thing tomorrow morning.  Good Night.\n\n\n"}}
