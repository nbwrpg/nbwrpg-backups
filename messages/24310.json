One couldn&#39;t see anything through \nthe thick cover of these trees, and she didn&#39;t mind walking, not when \nthe scenary was beautiful like this! Dead pine needles crunched under \npaw, the smell of pine filled her nsoe, and the chirping of birds \ncascaded in her ears.\n\nSo far she hadn&#39;t found any sign of Carnage. After this she would \nhead for the mountains..\n\nA small smile crossed her cat features. Total peace - and she loved \nit! A rustling of wings was heard, and a flash of brown and white \nshot over her head. Starteled, she looked up to see a Bald Eagle land \non the branch above her head. An actual Bald Eagle, not a \ntransformer. She cocked her head to one side and transformed into her \nBot Mode. The Eagle didn&#39;t even blink an eyelid, seemingly used to \nthis sort of thing.\n\nSlowly, Teltoli held her arm out towards the eagle, who peered at her \nwith golden eyes. The Bot made crooning noises, hoping the bird would \ntrust her. With a jerky movement, the bald eagle hopped onto her arm, \nhis large talons curling around her wrist and elbow. He was huge!\n\nShe let herself smile, and lowered her arm so she could face the bird \neye to eye. The eagle started preening himself, and seemed content to \nstay with her. He turned a bit, and Teltoli noticed with a start that \nsome of his tail feathers were singed.\n\n&quot;Poor baby..&quot; She whispered &quot;Did you get caught in the tail end of a \nblast? If you&#39;ll excuse the pun..&quot; She smiled, and mentally rolled \nher eyes. &quot;I&#39;m talking to a bird&#39; She told herself.\n\nNoticing it was getting slightly dark, she sat down at the foot of a \ntree, and set the eagle on the forest floor. He watched her with big \ncurious eyes as she transformed back into her Fuzor Mode, and lay \ndown at the foot of the tree. With a squawk, he fluttered up to a \nbranch that was no more than two feet above her head, and fluffed his \nfeathers, keeping watch while she took a quick nap.\n\n\n"}}
