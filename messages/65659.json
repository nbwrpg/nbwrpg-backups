When\n&gt; &gt; he arrived at the main entrance, he was pleasantly surprised to\n&gt; find that\n&gt; &gt; all the security measures had been installed.  That combined with\n&gt; several\n&gt; &gt; reinforced internal security doors and a large outer door would be\n&gt; more than\n&gt; &gt; enough to stop a small army of invaders without needing even one\n&gt; guard to\n&gt; &gt; manage the system.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The software he wrote into the security system had an index of the\n&gt; &gt; signatures and faces of known friendlies and known enemies.  Known\n&gt; &gt; friendlies could, under normal circumstances, come and go as they\n&gt; pleased\n&gt; &gt; without the threat of being blasted away by the new security\n&gt; system; while\n&gt; &gt; an enemy, who could be as close as half a meter from a friendly,\n&gt; could be\n&gt; &gt; rendered unconscious in a matter of seconds by the security\n&gt; program.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Celeron:  Celeron to Kratos, we have completed stage one upgrades\n&gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; front entrance.
