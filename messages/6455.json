She looked at the scanner and \nscanned the bot.  It showed Predacon signature.  But the scanner \ncould tell her little else.  She put the signature into the computer \nto store it for later on.  She got up and walked to the entrance and \nlooked at the bot hanging upside down in the tree looking at them.\n\n\n"}}
