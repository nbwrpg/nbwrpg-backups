Phobia? How could you have known and not \ntell me of this rift that threatens out lives like that?&quot; She heard \nthe baby hit the floor.  She looked at it and sighed. &quot;You know \nPhobia, I could really use your advise on this one. I wish I could \nbring you back.&quot;  Then her ears perked up at ehat she \nsaid. &quot;Yeah....yeah. I can bring you back.&quot;  She scooped up the baby \nin her hands and ran to the lab.  She went to the replicator and put \nthe baby in the tray.  She crossed her fingers as she turned on the \nreplicator. &quot;I hope this works. I was originally going to use this \nfor Megatron&#39;s spark, but, Dang it Phobia. You just had to give me \nmore trouble now huh?&quot; She activated the replicator and hoped that it \nwould replicate the baby enought o get a good DNA sample.  Then she \nmight have a chance to replicate Phobia&#39;s body from the sample.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The baby climbed up the side of the captains chair and onto KitKats\n&gt; shoulder. It bit down using KitKats internal circuitry as an \nantenna it sent\n&gt; a message.\n&gt; \n&gt; In her mind Phobia appeared. His voice echoing thouroughly. &quot;In the \nevent of\n&gt; my deletion I send this message.&quot; The voice was calm and collected \nwith an\n&gt; honest tone about it.&quot;I came to this planet planning to save our \ntime. Since\n&gt; you&#39;re hearing this something drastic must have happened to me.&quot; It \npaused\n&gt; again trying to collect himself. &quot;Temporal waves from this planet \ncause\n&gt; great destruction throughout the universe, it must be stopped or we \nwill\n&gt; create the biggest Paradox in cybertrons history.&quot; with that the \nmessage\n&gt; stopped and the spider fell off and died.\n\n\n\n"}}
