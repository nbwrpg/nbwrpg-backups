He \nstarted to have shooting pains within himself. Wolveritron grabbed \nhim to hold him up and the pain was transfered. They both felt the \npain of whatever this was.\n     A blast of energy was shot out from Eclipse, and Wolveritron \nwent flying. When wolveritron hit he was glowing white, and getting a \nnew form. He was becoming Transmetal. Then he stood there, in his \nregal new form. A cloak coming off of his right shoulder. He now had \na face plate. He tested his claws. Two came out normally, then a \nthird, in the middle popped out and it was very long, almost a saber. \nHe tried the other one, the same happened. He went to beast mode, now \nhe was a TM Wolverine, which he thought was very cool. He could \nextend his beast mode claws to about twelve inches. Then he \nremembered Eclipse. He went looking for him.\n     Eclipse was lying in a shallow ditch, one that he made himself \nfrom the blast. Wolveritron transformed to Robot mode and started \nwalking down the ditch. It was still smoldering, and he couldn&#39;t see. \nThen the Sliver Wolf jumped out at him. He looked at Wolveritron with \nintelligent eyes. Then he transformed, to a werewolf form. And spoke.\n     &quot;Hey, Wolveritron,&quot; He said, helping the startled bot up. &quot;It&#39;s \nme, Eclipse, great new form, don&#39;t you think?&quot;\n     Wolveritron stood in amazement at this new Silver Wolf that is \nEclipse.\n\n\n"}}
