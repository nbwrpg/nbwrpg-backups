Manufacturing \nthe sphere, complicated but doable.  Launching it, I foresee a \nproblem.  Unless Rodimus is willing to let us tear the weapon system \nand maybe the propulsion drive apart, our choices are quite few.&quot;\n&gt; He though back to his repulser idea.  \n&gt; &quot;Maybe we can build a repulser and launch it.

Then she looked at \n&gt; Malice. &quot;Anyway, back to work. It&#39;s easy. We simply make a metal \nball \n&gt; and cut it into two halves. Fit an electro magnet into it and then \n&gt; fit it back together. Then we launch it out into space. I&#39;ll have \nto \n&gt; find out the quardinance as to where to send it though.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bustercross365&quot; \n&lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Malice said a brief &#39;til we meet again&#39;and then caught up with \n&gt; &gt; Wolfblade.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You really don&#39;t like kids that much, do you?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He walked beside her, occasionally taking note of some sound or \n&gt; &gt; sight.  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;So, were are we going to get your sphere and electromag \ngenerator?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Camoflage:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She grinned and laughed a bit. &quot;YEAH!
