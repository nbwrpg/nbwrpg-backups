You did \nsoemthing \n&gt; dumb. Introduce a hostile charachter on someone elses ship and tried \ndoing \n&gt; stuff to it without their permission. Thirst has no escape. He is \nblocked \n&gt; from all escape, the end is inevitable.\n&gt; \n&gt; IC: As Thirst lepped out of the cloud the acid was still on him, \nthat is what \n&gt; the cloud was made of. A second before thirst reached rights neck, \nvoid \n&gt; lunged forward and slammed a claw into Thirsts back and then \ngdragged him \n&gt; back before slamming him into the ground.\n\n\n"}}
