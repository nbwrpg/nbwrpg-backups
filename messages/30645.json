She stood up and heard \n&gt; Reptilica ask about her.  She went to transform into her leopard \nmode \n&gt; out of habit, and instead, transformed into a cat mode. But it \nlooked \n&gt; like she was a chrome panther or something.  She looked at herself \n&gt; and sighed. &quot;No, it&#39;s no good. I&#39;m completely without a mode. It&#39;s \n&gt; useless. I&#39;m useless.&quot;  She transformed into bot mode and walked \noff \n&gt; the shuttle.  She was still stunning, but without a beast mode, she \n&gt; was all  in chrome.\n\n\n"}}
