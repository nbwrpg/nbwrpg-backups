She mumbled a \nbit because not all her functions were fully on line.  She shook her \nhead a little and peered again out the chamber window. She said in \navery soft, but slurred voice, &quot;what&#39;s going on? Lemme out of here?&quot;\nShe tried to move her hand to push it against the door, but could \nbarely lift her arm.  She felt like she wasn&#39;t in control of \nherself.  She felt herself drifting back into sleep, but she didn&#39;t \nwant to.  She tried to fight it, but eventually gave in and fell \nasleep in the chamber that Dark One had put her in.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
