It trys to explain things with science that shouldn&#39;t be=\r\n explained with science.  You cannot scientiffycally prove wiether or not t=\r\nhe spiritual realm exists.\n\n  But partial creationism is foolishness.  If y=\r\nou are following the biblical account of creation, there is no room for int=\r\nerperatation.  The Bible tells you when it is being symbolic by using words=\r\n as: &quot;like&quot; &quot;as&quot; but when it refers to creation, it doesn&#39;t.  You cannot in=\r\nterperet on it&#39;s own; the rest of scriptures back this up.\n\n  If God has th=\r\ne power to create something from nothing, then why would he only set it in =\r\nmotion?
