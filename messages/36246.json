I think almost everyone meant him when they \nsaid the bum.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::::\n&gt; \n&gt; Having disposed of Dogged, the bot hears someone call him, turning \nand seeing a sword and shield flying at him. He grabs both, looking \nbriefly to see who had thrown it and finding no one who matched his \nmental description of someone who&#39;d have these sorts of weapons. He \nturns, seeing Repungus going at Dogged, and finds a new target, \nfiring his remaining shoulder missile launcher at the debris that \nBranded was behind while heading toward it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Cyberwolf, you&#39;ll have to repost with Branding.

He steps back again, and levels his freeze cannons at \n&gt; &gt; Arty&#39;s shoulders in an attempt to stop the bot from moving his \narms \n&gt; &gt; at the shoulder.
