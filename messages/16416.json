Inside his mind, Dark One was giving orders.\n\n&quot;In a few seconds we seperate,&quot; his voice sounds to the other Oblitercons, \n&quot;I&#39;m going to get this femm back to base. You four take out these Maximals.&quot;\n\nFiring a final optic shot at Arcangel, Oblitertron lifts Squizzy to his \nchest, a panel sliding aside as he drops her into a compartment. The gestalt \nbegins to separate, four bots resulting from the huge bot in a few seconds.\n\nDark One, with Squizzy inside his cockpit, launches off, heading for the \nAlliance base. His cockpit was simply a space with walls inside it, no \ncomputers or outlets. Seeing that Squizzy was awake, Dark One activates an \ninnercom.\n\n&quot;Calm yourself,&quot; he says into the cockpit, &quot;You&#39;ll be repaired soon.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPyro laughs, transforming into vehicle mode and firing a blast of fire at \nDepthCharge.

He jumps up, wincing at the pain as he returns fire at \nDepth Charge.\n\n"}}
