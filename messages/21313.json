People were dieing.  \nCybertronians.  He was on Cybertron.  Something was destroying \neverything.  He ran across the Cybertronian street, looking for \nsomewhere to hide, when he froze.  \n&gt; \n&gt;      A fem-bot was there in front of him.  This was the fem-bot he \nalways had visions of!  \n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Who are you??&quot; cried Dollen, feeling fear.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Your destiny,&quot; the bot said.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;My what?&quot; Dollen said, confused.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Suddenly, she exploded, and then, everything started to \nexplode.  He felt pain, then he exploded!  His spark was floating in \nnothing, and then it dissolved.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;AAAHHH!!!!!&quot; Dollen screamed, suddenly awakening from a bad \ndream.\n&gt; \n&gt;      He calmed down, then looked around.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Silent.....Where is everybody?&quot; He said to himself.  \n&gt; \n&gt;       Dollen realized they must be in battle.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Suddenly, Dollen had a vision.  It showed KitKat and the \nothers fighting the Alliance, and getting the crap beat out of them.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;No!  Not if I can help it!&quot; Dollen yelled, and ran out of the \nbase.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Dollen ran, and ran, until he arrived at the scene of the \nbattle.\n&gt; \n&gt;       He jumped out in the center of the battlefield.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;The Predacons will win!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Dollen screamed.\n&gt; \n&gt;       He grabbed his ray gun, and fired madly around, all over the \nAlliance force, inaccurately, but loads o&#39; shots.\n\n\n"}}
