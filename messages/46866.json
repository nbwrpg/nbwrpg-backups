As it rounds the corner into the atmosphere it blinks as if \n&gt; smiling and a laugh ecos thorughout the corerdors as a pod is \n&gt; launched into the atmosphere, as the pure evil being known as Auorn \n&gt; rushes toward the unsuspecting population he smiles at the \nbrillance \n&gt; of his plan as the great ship Chaoz turns off and heads in the \n&gt; direction it has come. AS the pod crashes into a rejion of Earth \nwith \n&gt; a menacing crash and a explosion that can be sensed for miles \n&gt; around, &quot;Yes I am here fianlly to reak my havok on this planet&quot; as \nhe \n&gt; sends out his sensors to find him a worthy mode of transporatation \n&gt; that the bots refer to as a beast mode. AS it comes over the two \n&gt; enemies locked in combat it senses then and fin&#92;ds there bodies as \n&gt; one sutible for his purpese. As the statis field finally goes off \nand \n&gt; the form of Auron steps out with a long black claw into the \n&gt; ground, &quot;Yes this will do nicely&quot; he said when he turned into the \n&gt; half Dragon half lion mode which would suit him. As Auron laughs \n&gt; within his new bodie he launches into the air waiting for his first \n&gt; challenge.\n\n\n"}}
