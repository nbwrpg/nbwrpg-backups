That fact surprise him. He \nnever truly hatted Rattrap, they had had an understanding and that was all \nthey needed.But now he at least had a reason to call him down and slag him.\nHe smiled to himself as he remembered the last words that Rattrap had said \nto him before he had departed towards the Matrix, he would have never \nguessed that he would join the Predacons.\nHe wasn&#39;t surprised that SilverBolt was still with the Maximals, his loyalty \nwas without question.\nBut what happened with the others still was a mystery to him, and obviously \nto Tavatron as well.\nHe thought of the question that Tavatron was now going to ask him and \nwondered if he could answer it, he would if he could.*\n\n&quot; Yes.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
