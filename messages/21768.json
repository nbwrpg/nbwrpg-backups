He spoke, \nbut she coudln&#39;t understand what he said. (Can&#39;t speak Japanese) She \nclosed her eyes as he kissed her. She felt her spark run wild and her \nwhole body tingled. She wasn&#39;t sure if it was his kiss or the loss of \nmech fluid. She pulled back. She was programmed by Squizzy to be \nloyal to the Allience, and with them, she must stay. &quot;I can&#39;t leave \nthe my leader. Zardus is my leader. I can not ignore my programming.&quot; \nShe cried silently and kept looking at HotRod.  She wanted to go with \nhim, buther program over road her emotion chips.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sure KitKat will allow you in.

Never!\n&gt; &quot;You are right, the Matrix has made my programing Maximal. The\n&gt; reprograming you did is gone.

My programing \nmay be\n&gt; Maximal, but I&#39;ll do anything to be with you. That includes staying \nwith\n&gt; the Alliance.&quot;\n&gt; That was an exageration. He wasn&#39;t sure if he would really work for \nthe\n&gt; Alliance. He was torn between his Maximal/Autobot heritage, and his \nlove\n&gt; for her.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked at her wounds.\n&gt; &quot;You need a CR. The question is, the Alliance base, or the CF. If \nyou\n&gt; ask me you are more like a Maximal. You have a kind good natured \nspark.\n&gt; You were serving the Alliance cause Zardus reprogramed you.(Thats \nwhat\n&gt; happaned right?) That programing is gong now. You arn&#39;t a Alliance\n&gt; temptress anymore. You and me are alike.\n&gt; I want to stay with you, no matter what. Now you have to decide \nbetween\n&gt; Alliance or Maximal. Just remember I&#39;ll stay no matter what you \npick.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He put his hands on her cheeks, rubing away any tears.\n&gt; &quot;Omae o korosu,&quot; he said in Japanese.\n&gt; He then kissed her, with all the love he felt for her.\n\n\n"}}
