He&#39;d fealt\ndifferent before but he now knew that Veratis had him on less than half\npower. &quot;This is incredable&quot; he exclaimed in his excitement. &quot;What have you\nmade me?&quot; the details raced through his mind as he considered how easily he\ncould shred Veratis but for Shadow Wings sake he&#39;d play along.\n\n&quot;Veratis sneered, he could sense what was going through Lunarpines mind &quot;I\nhave made you more like me.&quot; Veratis transformed into bat mode and began\nflying away from the ship. &quot;Follow me.&quot;\n\nLunarpine transformed to wolf mode and began chasing Veratis, The bat was\nthe fastest flyer he&#39;d encountered on this planet and somehow Lunarpine was\nkeeping up. Veratis changed direction without warning, remarkably Lunarpine\nchanged just as quickly.\n\nVeratis landed atop a valley miles away and waited for Lunarpine, The wolf\nshot up the side of the cliff like he&#39;d done it a million times. Lunarpine\nlanded next to Veratis turned to face the bat. &quot;You&#39;re fast for an old bot.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you&quot;Veratis answered &quot;Look&quot; Veratis nodded his head in the direction\nthey&#39;d just come from. Lunarpine followed his gaze .\n\nLunarpine fell silent as he looked back toward the ship. He couldn&#39;t see it\nfrom there, he could barely see the peaks of the camoflauge Veratis had used\nto cover the ships.&quot;What do you think about your new body now?&quot; Veratis\nasked already knowing the answer. Lunarpine and Veratis had covered hundreds\nof miles in no time and Lunarpine barely fealt any fatigue.\n\nVeratis could understand the silence, he saw the same response when he&#39;d\ngiven his daughter her new form.  &quot;You think that&#39;s impressive? Watch.&quot;\nVeratis transformed.  Before Lunarines eyes stood a creature that he didn&#39;t\nknow, it appeared to be half bot half Bat. &quot;Impressive, am I right?&quot;\nLunarpine stepped back not knowing what would come next. &quot;Try it, Think\nhalfling.&quot;\n\nIn a spark of energy Lunarpine began to transform &quot;Howllllllllll&quot; He changed\ninto a beast of large proportions that walked on two legs, (Darkstalkers\nfans think John Tallbane, Gigemon fans think Were Garouroumon.)  he still\nhad his wolfs head legs and tail, his arms were transformed into powerful\nmuscular arms that could tear a bot in two, the only response he could think\nof was &quot;Now I&#39;m impressed.&quot;\n\nThe two transformed back to beasts and started back toward the base\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;minime_316@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, September 21, 2000 2:53 PM\nSubject: Re: ARK\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Prebon\n&gt;\n&gt; Prebon laughed.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Excellent! Now, here is the plan. In a few days we&#39;ll all go on a\n&gt; scout mission at The Ark. You&#39;ll tell us which one is Ramulus. I than\n&gt; threaten to kill you if he doesn&#39;t meet me one on one. If he does,\n&gt; Striker goes home. If he doesn&#39;t, Striker gets the chip. If Ramulus\n&gt; does meet me, than I give him the chip and use him as my middle man\n&gt; to control the Maximals! You may go. You can look at Striker all you\n&gt; want. But if he wakes up, no mentioning of what I have just told you.\n&gt; The only thing I will alow you to say is &quot;I am Master Prebon&#39;s now.&quot;\n&gt; As soon as he wakes up tell me, so the torture can begin. No leaving\n&gt; the ship without my permission and no helping him to escape!&quot; Prebon\n&gt; was about to walk away, but he turned back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oh, and I hope you know what you&#39;ve gotten yourself into. I said\n&gt; Striker would go. Not you. To save him you have sacrificed a future\n&gt; with him. You could&#39;ve been with him forever, but you decided to sell\n&gt; out your friends and lose your love. Have a nice day!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Prebon left her laughing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
