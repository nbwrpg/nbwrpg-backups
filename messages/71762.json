ELDER knew=\r\n that\n&gt; he was old, older than probrably some of these Maximals suspected, =\r\nbut\n&gt; he could feel a great age in WHEELIE, an age that was getting tired.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There&#39;s got to be somehting more to this then simple survival, of\n&gt; j=\r\nust living.&quot; ELDER sighed, &quot;I mean if that&#39;s all there is then what\n&gt; are w=\r\ne figting for, what are we living for?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked back at the skies ag=\r\nain, the stars twinkling in the velvet\n&gt; of the night skies. &quot;What do you w=\r\nant out of life? What would you be\n&gt; if there was no war?&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe i=\r\nrony was probably deep, and unkonwn to most, but Wheelie was old by the sta=\r\nndards of most Autobots, having come online before the onset of the war ins=\r\ntigated by Megatron, and yet was one of the most childish and ill behaved o=\r\nf any who had worn any banner.  \n\nWheelie shrugged, &quot;What else is there but=\r\n to stay alive?  It&#39;s not like it gets any better after this dive.  What is=\r\n there to look forward for?  A never ending life of war?  And should we att=\r\nempt to move on, to the AllSpark we shall be gone.  And it will bring us ba=\r\nck someday, to fight the war in another way.  A lifespan that compares to t=\r\nhe stars, yet locked in hatred like old fashioned cars.  All I know, all I =\r\nsay, is that the war will not end any day.  All it will be is waiting for t=\r\nhe next battle to come out in forray.&quot;\n\nFor the last bit, the last question=\r\n, Wheelie looked up at the LORD ELDER a little sadly, &quot;What I want out of l=\r\nife?  What I want is an end tos trife.  For it is all I have ever known.  T=\r\nerror and war all over my home.  I know it shall not end while I am around,=\r\n and when I am but another shell interred within the ground.  It was the pa=\r\nst, it shall be what is to be.  Even when we are but history.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
