The council has told you to stop posting about the Rucak again and again, and you just argue. You spam the board with OOC after OOC, even after being told at least 4 times to use the message board. Your moon idea is a definite &quot;NO!&quot; from me. Do you realize how many things the moon&#39;s been used for? Ships crashed on it, battles have even been fought on it, bots lived on it, and that&#39;s just in NBW, not even taking into account everything on the show. And a base that big is ridiculous. The Ark is in space, but that was by council decree. Furthermore, the rest of the idea (galaxy being a power source, etc..) is really not for this RPG.\n\nBecause of you, the members havn&#39;t been able to post IC because of all the damn OOC messages, and that&#39;s going to stop. You obviously have trouble following instructions, so we&#39;ll make it simple for you. You&#39;ve been moderated, and you will stay that way until you a) send the council (the COUNCIL, not the RPG) all the possibly controversial stuff about the storyline, b) wait for the council to discuss it and give you our decision, and c) grow up enough to be able to refrain from all these idiotic OOCs.\n\nMe and the rest of the council will wait for you to send the info to us.\n\n\n"}}
