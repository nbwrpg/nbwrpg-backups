He transformed to his half wolf form to begin\nrepairs. he&#39;d lost enough mech fluid from the initial wound to slow him\ndown. Now the wolfbot had wounds in the robotic chest to worry about. His\nhalf transformation would slow the effects of the injuries but he still\nfealt them. The large werewolf looking Lunarpine opened his mouth and\nlaunched a sonic howl at Serpentor. The attack wasn&#39;t designed to do a lot\nof physical damage but it could reak havoc on the targets audio receptors.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, December 24, 2000 10:31 AM\nSubject: Re: Destruction CF (OOC to Gigan and Cyberwolf)\n\n\n&gt; (I said that I didn&#39;t care about the post Cyber, and I replied to it in my\n&gt; &quot;Total Chaos at CF&quot; post)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
