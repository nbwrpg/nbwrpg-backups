One of them will be for how long the \nRPG should be paused during Cristmas (and New Years), and the other \nwill be for when the pause should start.\n\nLast year, we paused from the 23 to the 3rd I think, to allow \neveryone to spend time with their families and go on vacations and \nall that stuff. This is important, so if you don&#39;t vote, the Matrix \nwill be mad at you. I think the polls are self-explanatory, but if \nyou have any questions, you can send me an IM/E-mail/DeathThreat, and \nI&#39;ll be more than happy to reply (unless the drugs have worn off).\n\nSo, keep in mind that the RPG will be very slow during this time due \nto lots of us going on vacation (or spending time with family or \npassed out near the beer bottle) anyways, and VOTE!\n\n\nI should really get some sleep before school tomorrow now. Cya laterz.\n\nPS. Sorry if the pathetic attempts at humor in this post offend \nanyone, I&#39;m in a strange mood. I think I&#39;ll have bagels for breakfast \ntomorrow...\n\n\nNow that I&#39;ve made an idiot of myself, I&#39;m off to bed. :-)\n\n\n"}}
