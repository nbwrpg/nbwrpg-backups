He then lowers his head back down to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;  We have to put order back into the forest.  The only way we can do that,\n&gt; is to locate the mech who is controlling the dinosaurs and subdue him.  I\n&gt; have a feeling that part is up to us.  The old dragon would have wanted it\n&gt; that way.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns to Leo Prime and Wing Caliber.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Leo Prime, Wing Caliber, I need you to head into the forest and be ready\n&gt; to direct forces on the ground.  Once we engage the enemy I know there&#39;s\n&gt; going to be trouble.  I need you to create a chaos buffer so we can avoid\n&gt; pandemonium.  Take as many Maximals and Autobots with you as you see fit.\n&gt; And most of all, please, be careful my friends.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then looks back to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I may be wrong as to the meaning of my new form but I think somehow this\n&gt; has always been within me and the old dragon could somehow sense it.  Plus\n&gt; my temper, I realize it can get rather out of hand at times.. I believe the\n&gt; term is hot headedness and of course, dragons breathe fire, so... Anyway\n&gt; that&#39;s what I think as far as your question is concerned.  All right, we\n&gt; have work to do.  The sooner we set the forest straight, the sooner we find\n&gt; Cheetor.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He now spreads his wings and offers his back to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re meant to do this together, and together we will.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS smiled as he looked at TUSCON feeling so much like a knight\nabout to slide on his steed, a dragon rider. There was a certain look\nof joy on his face, causing him to look more like HOR ROD of old for a\nmoment. &quot;Of course.&quot; he said.\n\nMeanwhile LEO PRIME nodded to TUSCON, &quot;We will do what we can.\nAirhammer gave me the cordinates where he saw the disturbance.&quot;\n\nWING CALIBER handed LEO a PADD.\n\n&quot;Hmmm.&quot; LEO said as he pursed his lips and read it. &quot;It was some\ndistance from here. I am sure you will reach it far faster than we\nwill.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from RODIMUS, &quot;We&#39;ll be careful.&quot; He slid on the back\nthat TUSCON was offering.\n\n&quot;You do that.&quot; LEO PRIME said. &quot;Have you thought about what we talked about?&quot;\n\nA scowl flashed itself across RODIMUS&#39; face. &quot;Yes. We will discuss it\nwhen I get back.&quot;\n\nThere was a grim look from LEO as WING CALIBER nodded as well,\nevidently he knew the situation as well. &quot;Tuscon, we will talk as well\n. . . when you return.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very well then.&quot; LEO said. &quot;Tuscon keep us apprised of your\nsituation. Remember, you will be on your own for some time at the\ndistance you are going. The Fuzors are already out on patrol and I\nwill call them in as required, but if you run into more trouble than\nyou can handle it will take some time for them to reach your\nposition.&quot;\n\nHe paused thoughtfully, &quot;NIghtshift is still under repairs but should\nbe finished soon. Lord Elder should be ready as well as a few others.\nWe will all be ready and standing as a buffer.&quot;\n\nAs LEO talked WING CALIBER sent a communication link for NIGHTSHIFT to\nreport to their location once his repairs were complete, the same for\nRAT TRAP and LORD ELDER. LEGACY was of course to remain where he was\nas guardian of the Ark.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
