She dodged two of the rockets and watched them collide in \nmidair.  But one followed her.  She swooped down and circled around.  \nShe led the rocket back Anubis.  She headed right for Anubis, then \nturned straight upward letting the rocket home in on Anubis.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSpears::\nShe transformed into best mode and curled up just as the rocket hit.  \nIt threw her against the hull of the ship. She laned on the ground in \na ball of half broken quills.  She got up on all fours and threw some \nof the broken quills at Hades.  &quot;Broken but still sharp.&quot; \nShe was cut and had damage, but she was still able to fight.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Imprisoner/Predator/Choran/Koga Shuko/Ramhorn/Anubis/Hades/Unitron:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Imprisoner went flying back, slamming through a tree, not moving.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Predator ducked under the blast, firing a grenade off at Firearm&#39;s \nchest, two \n&gt; optic blasts streaking out at his left knee.\n&gt; \n&gt; Choran cursed, taking out his rapid-firing laser rifle, firing off \n16 rapid \n&gt; laser blasts at Rex&#39;s pelvis.\n&gt; \n&gt; ====\n&gt; \n&gt; Koga Shuko stepped into the open, revealing Ramhorn as a \nhostage.  &quot;Back off! \n&gt;  Or the Maximal gets it!&quot; he yells.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anubis yelps, rocks hitting him.  WIth a swipe of his hand, he \nknocked away \n&gt; the quills, firing off a blast from his rocket launcher at Shadow \nWing, as \n&gt; well as three blue optic blasts at her left leg.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hades yelled, a quill stabbing into his shoulder.

Walking up \nto the \n&gt; computer, he smiled.  &quot;With the Ark in ruins, this is the last \npiece of \n&gt; equipment that needs be destroyed.&quot; Reaching into subspace, he took \nout two \n&gt; charges.  Setting both on Teletran-1.  He then too out two \ngrenades, getting \n&gt; to the doorway, throwing them, one in the middle of Teletran-1&#39;s \ncharges, the \n&gt; other hitting Teletran-2.  The grenade set off the charges on \nTeletran-1.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron ran for where Koga Shuko was, chuckling.\n\n\n"}}
