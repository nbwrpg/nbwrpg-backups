This was all strange and new.\n\nThe wolf&#39;s stomach rumbled, but it had a feeling that it wouldn&#39;t be \nfeeding on any of the creatures it had seen. It turns around, running \nback, away from all the bot.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine thought he&#39;d heard something, no someone calling to \n&gt; him. &quot;What was that?&quot; He wondered, smelling the air again. He \n&gt; followed the scent to her. He could still hear her words in his head \n&gt; when she called to him. &quot;What&#39;s become of you?&quot; He thought, \ncuriosity \n&gt; flooding his mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; He heard a voice over his comm. Veratis wanted an update on the \n&gt; situation. &quot;I found her&quot; he replied, getting her back was going to \nbe \n&gt; the diffivult part.\n&gt; \n&gt; Three clean up drones aproached scanning her. A needle came out of \n&gt; the first one and headed for Ice. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No&quot; Lunarpine yelled as he grabbed hold of it, It was trying to \n&gt; neutralise the virus. He knew that if that happened she&#39;d be dead. \n&gt; Veratis reprogrammed 2 of the drones to help get her back. Lunarpine \n&gt; picked Ice up on his back and with the help of the drones began \n&gt; carrying her back.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She was about to pass out where she lay. She felt a presance close \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; her. She opened her mind and heard the thought of Lunarpine. He \nwas \n&gt; &gt; close to her. She smiled. She could read in his thoughts that he \n&gt; &gt; still cared for her. A smiled crossed her face. She sned out the \n&gt; &gt; mental message,&quot;I&#39;m over here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Then she slipped into sleep. The snow half covered her, but the \nred \n&gt; &gt; puddle was growing under her. It was ver visible, despite the \n&gt; falling \n&gt; &gt; snow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine fought his way through ice and snow to find her. \n&gt; Nothing \n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stop him from finding her, He&#39;d travelled to far and worked to \n&gt; hard \n&gt; &gt; to bring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her back to let her succome to a virus. The bloodstains in the \n&gt; snow \n&gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting larger. Her wounds had opened worse. The half wolf was \n&gt; &gt; determined to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; return her to Veratis&#39; base without any harm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile Foxfingers flew across the sea to the country where \n&gt; &gt; they&#39;d landed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was far enough away from Predacon territory to risk a \n&gt; &gt; transmission.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Foxfingers to home, I&#39;m on my way back with lots of goodies.&quot; \nHis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hoverboard switched into high gear as he streaked across the \n&gt; water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Veratis heard the transmission and replied in kind. &quot;Where the \n&gt; &gt; underworld\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have you been? You should have been back long ago.&quot; He hesitated \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; deliver\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the bad news to him, Things were falling apart before his very \n&gt; &gt; eyes, The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; virus was loose, Lunarpine still hadn&#39;t found Ice and Lady Hawk \n&gt; &gt; still hadn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; returned. The bleak news echoed through his memory like a \nchiming \n&gt; &gt; bell.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Things just couldn&#39;t get much worse.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Foxfingers slowed down when he heard the news. He remembered the \n&gt; &gt; tracking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; device on his shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ve accompanied me far enough \nPreds.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; He flew\n&gt; &gt; &gt; low and dropped it on the icy beach. The tracking device still \n&gt; &gt; functioned,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Predacons could track him this far, and he wasn&#39;t worried \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; anything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; e\n\n\n"}}
