Probably letting my guys do all the dirty work that \nSOB...)\n\n(Ok, this is for the stuff I sure as hell didn&#39;t agree with.  \nAlloran, Ratchet and Bluestreak are firing upon Zergling and Punch, \nand those two Alliance members are inside the Ark.  The two Maximals \nI mentioned of yours NEVER entered the Ark.\n\nStomper jump kicked at Punch, yet he was never in the Ark, Icedemon.  \nAlso, my guys aren&#39;t standing around near an entry hatch in the Ark, \nbut I&#39;ll let that slide\n\nAlso, Minime...isn&#39;t Fliq a Maximal?  And if so...why is Bronco \nshooting him?)\n\nThe Oblitercons/Serpentor/Unitron/Punch/Zergling/Nemesis \nEnforcer/Scattershot:\n\n\n\n\nDark One barrel rolled, dodging several blasts.  Getting a target \nlock, he fired down a heat seeking missile at Archangel, followed up \nby 10 rapid laser blasts.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown fired off a grenade at Torca\n\n---\n\nHiss cursed, rolling, a fire ball hitting his left arm.  He raised \nhis missile launcher, firing a rocket at Archangel&#39;s sternum, shaking \nhis arm violently.\n\n---\n\nScavenger fell back, his chest plate slightly cracking.  He raised \nhis chain gun, firing off 12 armor piercing rounds at Torca&#39;s torso.\n\n---\n\nPyro laughed evilly, firing off two fire balls at Ratchet&#39;s knees.\n\n---\n\nOinker ducked under a few optic lasers, one piercing into his left \nshoulder.  He fired off three laser bolts at Shadow Wing.\n\n------\n\nHearing the scream of missiles, Zergling jumped back, Punch holding \nhim up, the missiles blowing up against a wall in front of them.  \nThey ran down the corridor, slipping into a room, the engine room.\n\nZergling raised his weapon, firing off a total of 25 rapid laser \nbolts in an arc in front of him.  (I don&#39;t want to post what the \nArk&#39;s engine room looks like, since I&#39;ve never seen it)\n\nPunch raised his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at machinery.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
