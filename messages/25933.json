He \n&gt; started to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; boil up with fury. He turned around and stared down at Perplex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perplex: I heard your whining as you ran.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Serge: (Mumbles something not understandable)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perplex: I&#39;ll give you a head start, RUN!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Serge just stood there looking at Perplex. Perplex raised his \n&gt; hand,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; showing the disk he was powering earlier. He started to make it \n&gt; grow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; larger and glow more brightly and pulsate faster. Serge walked \n&gt; slowly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; backwards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perplex: Run faster than that if you value life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Serge continued to move slowly, planning to duck the disk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Clash flew along, wondering why he had been forced to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; run by those fools back there. His arm was growing back now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Clash: How could I, it isn&#39;t possible, I am the ultimate being, \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SUPREME being, I am perfection, I can&#39;t be beaten! It&#39;s not right,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what happened? A hex?

I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; got to get out of here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deemos flew off away from the battle, contacting Sharpedge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deemos: Sharpedge, you&#39;re in command of my position, I can&#39;t \n&gt; stand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be there anymore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tarantopulous looked around him. Maximals, still firing, worse \n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him even. Why do they act this way? It was only a cease fire?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tarantopulous pondered this. After all, as soon as the Maximals \n&gt; get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their guy back, then they could fire again, right? They were just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; making things harder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tarantopulous (To Kluster): Sir, they are all still firing. \n&gt; This is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suicide. You have shown me the light, and I am most certain that \n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are killing  themselves! I can&#39;t take this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With that, Tarantopulous ran from the battle, catching the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attention of Deemos on his way...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
