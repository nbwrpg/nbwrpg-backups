Fangs that inject venom. Venom will send \nmost average BW bot into stasis, but not kill. \nAlliegance: Predacon \n\nShe was made on Cybertron, by the Predacon Council. She was designed \nto be a spy and assassin. Her moto, SEEK,SEDUCE,DESTROY. She had \nkilled many Maximal officails on Cybertron and was working her way \naround to the top leaders. She was the best in her field. The \nPredacon Council had made other bots for the same purpose as she, but \nshe had out done them all. But because of her skill, a few of the \nPredacon leaders felt she might become a threat to them. She knew \ntoo much and they now wanted rid of her. She had just killed one of \nthe Maximal Council leaders and was then turned in by one of the \nPredacon Council members. She had to flee Cybertron or be exacuted. \nBut her programs of killing and information gathering were still \nstrong and for the Predacon cause despire the fact they betrayed her. \nShe stole a small transport ship and sped off from Cybertron. She \ndidn&#39;t know if she would ever return, but for now, the further away \nshe got, the safer she felt. \n\nShe was deep into space, when a black hole opened up infront of her \nship. Seconds later, her ship was sucked into the vortex of space. \nShe tried to fight, but the ship couldn&#39;t break free. She blacked \nout from the g-forces of the black hole as the ship was sucked in. \n\nHer ship finally flew throught the hole in space and ended up near \nthe solor system on Earth. Her ship had lost power and engine drive \nwhile in the black hole. The only systems that remained active were \nlife support. She was in stasis lock at the helm of the ship. AS \nthe ship drifted past the planets, it was hit by space debre and \nrubble. Small meteors collided and smashed parts of the exterior \ndrive system and parts of the navigational systems. The ship \nevertually drifted near earth, where the gravitational pull had \nstarted to pull the ship into the earth&#39;s atmosphere. The ship fell \nfrom the sky and landed 100 yards from the Allience base. The \ntransport ship was about the size of the NASA Space shuttle. \n\nDiamond was still out cold, her body slumped over the control \nconsole. Her body bruised but for the most part, undamaged. The \nship had sustained a lot of damage and would never fly again. Smoke \npoured out of the tail and engine rooms. The wings were torn off \nupon impact. One wing flew off and hit against the Allience ship. \n\n\n"}}
