She went and looked. Another drone was \nnear \n&gt; &gt; by.  She saw it was about 60 yards away. She crouched down, just \nlike \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang did.  She crawled up really slowly to the drone. She \n&gt; &gt; crawled up right under the drone. She went to pounce and banged \nher \n&gt; &gt; head on the underside of the drone and fell the the ground.  She \n&gt; &gt; whimpered a bit and rubbed her head with her paw. &quot;Ohhwwwwiieee, \nthat \n&gt; &gt; hurrrtt.&quot; with a whine and a whimper.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang saw that the puppy bot was going full frontal at the \n&gt; &gt; drones.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She would get bored soon if she went on like this.

There was a drones mere meters away. He \nmoved\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slowly, silently, until he was just under the drone, on the \nother \n&gt; &gt; side\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of a shrub. Then, he jumped. Quick as a bullet, he leapt just \nover \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; drones and brought all his weight down on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang: I know you can do just as good. It might take time, \nbut I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know you can do it! Now it&#39;s your turn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
