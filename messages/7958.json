I&#39;m not worried though. he&#39;ll be surprised \nif he tries anything.&quot;he thought for a moment. Paranoia was one of \nhis weaknesses, and arrogance was his biggest downfall.\n\n&quot;Kluster are you sure you want to have the parts delivered outside of \nyour scanner range? Thats quite a trip to move such delicate \nmachinery. surely you have a landing bay that could fit my ship. \nMaybe you could deactivate your guns long enough for me to land.&quot; \nPhobia looked down at his sensor equipment it would be to tempting to \nland that far away with the knowledge of the cargo he&#39;s carrying. &quot;I \nawait your response.\n\nHe decided to be cautious and cover himself just in case he needed a \nquick outlet.&quot;Computer activate the babies at the Predacon base.\n\n(For whoevers at Hell Beasts old base, Mosquitor and co.)\nA baby attatches itself to the comm system activating the comm unit \nbroadcasting a message to the highest ranking predacon available.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster frowns. &quot;I&#39;m not saying ANY crime, Phobia, but we&#39;ll do our \nbest to \n&gt; overlook them.
