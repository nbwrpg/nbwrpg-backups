Whether they were changed\n&gt; bey=\r\nond fixing, it was difficult to know. If they had changed so far\n&gt; would Wh=\r\neelie still exist or would he simply pop and fall out of the\n&gt; time stream =\r\ndiscarded because his fate and movement along the time\n&gt; line changed? Woul=\r\nd it be the same for any of them?\n&gt; \n&gt; The giant shape of TUSCON with RODIM=\r\nUS on his back had passed by\n&gt; several hours ago. So far the ones that were=\r\n with WHEELIE, LEO PRIME,\n&gt; SANTON, WING CALIBER still seemed to be going o=\r\nn as he knew them -\n&gt; time itself still seemed to be moveing inexorably fow=\r\nard without\n&gt; faltering, just as solid as the Ark he was sitting upon.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Could things have already changed? Could the things that WHEELIE\n&gt; belived=\r\n to be true, the things that seemed to be an indelible part of\n&gt; his histor=\r\ny be false - already having falling victim to the changes in\n&gt; the time str=\r\neam? Again hard to know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Above WHEELIE bats took off on the nightly fe=\r\neding from nearby caves,\n&gt; floating on the hot breezes that blew off the sa=\r\nndy deserts that were\n&gt; still far to their south. Hardy bushes and grasses =\r\nswayed gentley to\n&gt; and fro, struggling to grow in ground that had been sco=\r\nrched by\n&gt; battles large and small that had been fought in and around the A=\r\nrk.\n&gt; \n&gt; What was it all for? Had they lost the battle already? Was this th=\r\ne\n&gt; battle they were suppose to be fighting?\n&gt; \n&gt; Who can say.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the =\r\ndistance a night owl snagged one of the bats and flew higher\n&gt; into the  ai=\r\nr, its tastey meal still struggling in its claws.\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWheelie&#39;s onl=\r\ny experience with wildlife had been in the artificial nexuses created by th=\r\ne Quintessons, where everything had tried to consume and destroy everything=\r\n else, where he had been such a short time ago and yet such a long time ago=\r\n.\n\nGlancing up into the sky, as he heard the sound f the Maximals within mo=\r\nbilizing, Wheelie glanced up sadly.  It was not his place to shift the wind=\r\ns of time.\n\nIt was not his place to shift the wheels of what would come or =\r\nwhat might come.  No matter how much eh wished, he could not change what wa=\r\ns to pass.  That was for someone higher, wiser than himself to decide.\n\nHea=\r\nring the sound of the Maximals leaving the Ark, Wheelie stayed quiet, and s=\r\ntayed behind.  Watching the group as they readied themselves for whatever, =\r\nhe reamined in his place.  War, strife, fighting, was the destiny of the Tr=\r\nasnformers.  And all he could do was play his part.\n\n\n"}}
