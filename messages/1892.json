His damage was taking over him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ah&#39;m goin&#39; t&#39; get mah repairs,&quot; he announced to his comrades. He\nskittered\n&gt; out into the corridors, passing rooms and closed doors. He crawled into\nthe\n&gt; repair room, where the CR chambers stood. He still wasn&#39;t used to the\n&gt; chambers. He was used to the tanks the Darkside once had. But the Darkside\n&gt; was dead. Sadly. He liked that ship.\n&gt;\n&gt; He transformed to his robot mode, and once his feet hit the floor, he\n&gt; stumbled and screamed. He caught himself, using his arms for balance. He\n&gt; stood, baring the pain. On a panel in the room, a fur pelt laid. It was\nthe\n&gt; fur pelt Rowdy Wolf gave him on his trip back home. And on the floor, was\n&gt; the torn headband. He shook his head.\n&gt;\n&gt; He sighed and limped painfully into the CR cahmber. It closed behind him.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Save 75% on Products!\n&gt; Find incredible deals on overstocked items with Free shipping!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4013/10/_/_/_/958858814/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
