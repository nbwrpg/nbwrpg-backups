But the\ninstant\n&gt; his leg bent, he screamed. He leaned to the side and held his leg wounded\n&gt; leg out.\n&gt;\n&gt; The next time he saw Sinester, he would shoot him for that shot for his\n&gt; damaged leg. That was a lousy shot. And a shot for the new Predacon\nleader.\n&gt; He now had to have more respect than that. He could have bots killed. By\nhis\n&gt; orders or always by himself. He preferred by his own &quot;hands&quot;. But killing\n&gt; someone now wouldn&#39;t work well, mainly because his body wasn&#39;t working\nwell.\n&gt;\n&gt; He needed to find his troops now. And most of all, he needed repairs.\nBadly.\n&gt;\n&gt; He held his head over his lap and groaned loudly. He grumbled a few\nthings.\n&gt; He could again see the open wound on his leg. On the edge of the foot long\n&gt; wound, were singe marks. He didn&#39;t want to move now. That dumb bot\nSinester\n&gt; cause him much inconvenice. That brace restricted some pain.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; FREE shipping, 30-Day No Question Returns, daily giveaways\n&gt; and much, much more at zZounds.com.
