But there =\r\naer\n&gt; &gt; too many pieces to this puzzle.  The Schemings of TARANTALUS, HYDRA=\r\nS, and\n&gt; &gt; CRYOTEK as well, and the ongoing schemes of each of their own un=\r\nderlings.\n&gt; &gt; This situation is too complex even within our own forces.  An=\r\nd we have the\n&gt; &gt; Maximals and the followers of UNICRON to deal with as wel=\r\nl, and other\n&gt; &gt; things.  We spend too much of our time dealing with intern=\r\nal issues.\n&gt; &gt; Pah.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Walking along then as the trio stomped off tow=\r\nards TARANTALUS&#39; bay.  &quot;And\n&gt; &gt; I am interested in finding out just how he =\r\nwas able to restore a protoform\n&gt; &gt; without the rest of us knowing, Yess..&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHADOW gave DINOBOT an appraising look, glancing at him=\r\n in the dim\n&gt; lights of the cargo bay. &quot;It is an interesting turn of events=\r\n is it\n&gt; not?&quot; He said as he walked. &quot;Tarantulus seems to be up to his old\n=\r\n&gt; tricks again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This is Hydras&#39; old ship, and I am sure Tarantulus k=\r\nnew about it. &quot;\n&gt; His voice was low and his optics dimmed slightly as he ta=\r\nlked and\n&gt; processed the information. &quot;Tarantulus could not have completed =\r\nher\n&gt; construction in the amount of time we have been on this ship. Either\n=\r\n&gt; he has moved her to this location at some point . . . &quot; SKYSHADOW\n&gt; turne=\r\nd to look at the open door that led into the room TARANTULUS was\n&gt; in just =\r\noff the cargo bay, &quot; . . . or he was already here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW - BLACKARAC=\r\nHNIA&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was a smirk from BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;I thought the addage w=\r\nas &#39;any port\n&gt; &gt; in a storm for the rats deserting the sinking ships&#39;?
