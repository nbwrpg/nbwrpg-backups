He picks up a small holograpic projector and \n&gt; &gt; looks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadly at it.  He sits down and begins to meditate.  He turns on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; projector. A picture of a girl bot comes up. The projector \nstarts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; playing a recording of a woman singing the &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; theme:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 I don&#39;t know\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 what words I can say.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 The wind has a way\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 to talk to me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 Flowers sleep\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 a silent lullaby.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 I pray for reply.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 I&#39;m reeeeaaaaady.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 (I forget how the next verse goes and that&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; actually \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a traslated version they sing twice in the series not the one \nthey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sing at the end of each episode in Japanese).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  During this Rhesus has flashbacks (hey I needed to introduce \nsome \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conflict).  A small out post with the girl, Mustex, Stallex is \n&gt; born, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they constantly try with there few resorces to figure out why \n&gt; &gt; Stallex \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has to constantly upgrade like organics to adulthood over the \nlast \n&gt; &gt; 10 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months (I just dicided to say he ages 12 times faster than human \n&gt; &gt; kids \n&gt; &gt; &gt; although it will stop after 20 months and return to normal), \nthen \n&gt; an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attack, fighters are everywhere, they four of them are running \nto \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shuttle, 20 ft. away she&#39;s grabbed from behind, she&#39;s held \naround \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; neck by a large shadowy bot he can&#39;t quite make out, she screams \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him to go, he screams he won&#39;t but pushed the button to close \nthe \n&gt; &gt; door \n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway like a coward, and the shuttle takes off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He stands up crying. He stops still looking sad.  He gets his \n&gt; tools \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and gets back to work on the cannons.\n\n\n"}}
