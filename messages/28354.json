He runs a quick internal check, making sure that\n&gt; the damage circuits were nothing major, and then activates the\n&gt; boosters on his left side. The ones on his right, along with most of\n&gt; his right side, were missing due to his missing let.\n&gt;\n&gt; The boosters cause Firearm to spin through the air, smashing into the\n&gt; ground on the same stop that Beastbox had ended up.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Slag, this gonna hurt Beastbox&quot; Beastbox frantically grabs\n&gt; whatever he can\n&gt; &gt; from the inside of Firarm (Wires chips, you name it), moving his\n&gt; arms\n&gt; &gt; around quickly, and as he notices the speed of the ground\n&gt; aproaching him,\n&gt; &gt; he tries to jump out from underneath, ripping whatever he grabs. He\n&gt; tries\n&gt; &gt; to use his feet (like hands because he is a gorrilla) and his hands\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; stradle around to the top side of Firearm&#39;s tank mode.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Yanshosh, you go ahead and tell me if any of this works, okay.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
