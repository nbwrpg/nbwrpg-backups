She finally found a vent \nthat ran to the outside.  She got up close and found it was locked \ndown. She hissed agrily.  She slithered back and around.  She found \nanother outside vent, but it too was locked down.  She hissed and \nrattled her tail. She slithered around and found the mess hall.  She \npushed out the vent over and jumped down, she transformed into bot \nmode in mid air and landed on her feet.  She hissed and tasted the \nair around her.  She kew these bots would be on alert for her.  She \nsaw that the mess hall was empty and walked to the door. She poked \nher head around and saw that the halleay was vacant.  She causiously \nwalked down the hall, not making a sound.  She had her pistol drawn \nand readied.  She stopped and looked around, still no one.  She kept \nwalking.  She ahd no idea that she was actually heading for the \nbridge of the ship.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::DevilDuer::\n&gt; \n&gt; DevilDuer swears, falling backwards and tripping over a table.

Realizing he was stalking a \n&gt; possibly-poisonous snake, he jumps back down, activating his comm.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey, everyone,&quot; he says into it, &quot;There&#39;s a snake-bot on the \nloose.
