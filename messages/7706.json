The shrapnel stuck in his back would make his position a bit \neasier to see.\n\nHe aims his gun again, the weapon flying out of his hand as a shot hits near \nhim. He is thrown to the left, rolling several times on the ground. He jumps \nto his feet, right in time for a huge tank to crash into him, sending him \nflying a dozen feet before falling to the ground, unconscious.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm transforms back into robot mode, immediately aiming his gun arm at \nDeathScythe.\n\n&quot;Just have to hit &#39;em hard enough,&quot; he says to Hot Rod.\n\n"}}
