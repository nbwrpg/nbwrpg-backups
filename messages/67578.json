Anything that they would\nlike to see? I see them as the uber faction and individually very\npowerful. They are hated and feared by all .. or at least most, and are\ncollectively powerful enough to hold their own against the forces\narrayed against them. \n\nWhat is everyone else&#39;s thoughts?\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  \nFind them fast with Yahoo!
