An Autobot beacon, this did not make sense.\n&gt;  Sending a quick pulse along his transponder, sending a quick signal to the\n&gt; TELETRAAN computer with the pinged location he was picking up the trnsponder\n&gt; signal from.\n&gt;\n&gt; This did not seem like RODIMUS, Rodimus would be running on a Maximal\n&gt; frequency, not an Autobot one.  And if someone was attempting to use an\n&gt; AUTOBOT signal as lure for a trap, would it not be easier to use a Maximal\n&gt; one instead, given the number who had according to what LEO PRIME had said\n&gt; gone missing?\n&gt;\n&gt; And so, WHEELIE, after pinging his quick burst transmission over to the\n&gt; ARK&#39;s computer banks, began to quietly go towards the transponder signal,\n&gt; his energon slingshot out now in his hands and charged.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIt took only a moment for WHEELIE to realize (. . . or remember)  that\nhe no longer had communication to the outside world. His attempt to\nping Teletran-one was met with utter silence.\n\nHowever even the signal he was recieving was strange. It was not a\ncommunication in the conventional sense. It was a resonance wave that\nwas traveling along the backround energy that was in this strange\njungle. Like a small leaf floating along a larger river, the signal\nwent out riding on the wave of energy that seemed to permeate this\nsection of jungle. It was detectable by WHEELIE&#39;s communication gear\nbut it was not being transmitted along the typical lines.\n\nOne thing WHEELIE may remember is that RODIMUS is still Autobot having\nnever become a Maximal. And it was not that this signal was being\ntransmitted on an Autobot frequency, because anyone Maximal or Autobot\nwould have recieved it had they been with WHEELIE, but it was\ntransmitting an Autobot distress signal.\n\nHowever that does lead to the question as to how RODIMUS would be\ntransmitting it, if it was RODIMUS at all? RODIMUS was smart, but he\nnever showed an apptitude for advanced communication skills,\nespecailly along the lines as this - tapping into a background energy\nresonance and transmitting a signal across it - it did seem to be\nbeyond his skill set.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
