Challenging, and many of our normal techniques\n&gt; and =\r\ntactics he would be aware of.  WHile I would enjoy little more than\n&gt; testi=\r\nng our prowess agaisnt him, success would be risky even under optimal\n&gt; con=\r\nditions, for even the MAXIMALS do not name their Primes lightly.

We would be wide to avoid di=\r\nrect conflict unless we could\n&gt; isolate and ambush him from superior forces=\r\n.
