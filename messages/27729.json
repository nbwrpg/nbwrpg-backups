With that Motormaster\nsees the two missiles from Ratchet coming towards Wildrider. He transforms\ninto his Semi mode, and pulls around so his trailor takes the missiles\nshots. Scratching his side &quot;lets do it&quot; Motormaster yells, and starts his\nengine and drives towards Triggerhappy. Wildrider jumps forward and\ntransforms to car mode following Motormaster. Speedbreaker fire twice at\nRatchet, (if he hits it wont cause damage, it will just screw up youre\nmechanics, like making youre gun not work or something, you can choose what\nit does if it hits.\n\nThe Missile hits Beastbox who falls off Squawktalk with a hole in his\nchest. As he falls he looks around nervously. He lands on the ground hard.\n&quot;OWWWW, Beastbox make you pay for that. He leaps forward with quick speed\nand jumps towards Sideswipe, trying to land on him.\n\n\n\n"}}
