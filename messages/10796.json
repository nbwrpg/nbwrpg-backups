Either worked.\nBut without repair she couldn&#39;t do anything, so, she simply stayed there. Being tossed back and forth by two male bots in which she did not know.\nIt was almost as if they were fighting over her, for some reason or another.\nIt really didn&#39;t matter, either one was warm and she was cold, her shivers increasing.\nAs Bloodystrike pulled her towards him she tried to  move closer to him for his heat, trying to warm herself.And actually succeeding.\nShe tried to do the same when she was pulled towards Reptilica, actually managing to lean against him and draw a bit of his warmth into her body as well.\nHer shivers had increased but they hadn&#39;t gotten any worse.*\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
