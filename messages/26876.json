He checks the scanners, seeing that Killfest was \n&gt; &gt; in a battle nearby.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ah, it seems like we get our first battle,&quot; he says to the two other \n&gt; &gt; bots in the shuttle while he manuevers it closer to the Ark.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Incarcinator, one of the other bots in the shuttle with Scyther, \n&gt; &gt; stands up. He was about a dozen feet tall, and the material that his \n&gt; &gt; body consisted of was translucent, so he was a bit seethrough. He \n&gt; &gt; smiles. &quot;Excellent. Out of prison and already slaggin&#39; bots!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Incarcinator takes out a large rifle from his back compartment. The \n&gt; &gt; rifle was a mean looking weapon, with many attachments on it. It was \n&gt; &gt; made of the same material as Incarcinator. With a silent command from \n&gt; &gt; the bot, Incarcinator&#39;s armor slowly turns completely black. He waits \n&gt; &gt; for them to get to the battle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Yanshosh, would Motormaster&#39;s wounds be healed yet?
