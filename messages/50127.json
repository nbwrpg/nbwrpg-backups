The Kell Hounds did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; help a lot, and their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mech facilities helped us to rebuild a rather strong\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; touman.

A young and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bright freeborn \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior of kind of Phelan Kell.

Her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warden tendencies \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never prevented her to rise in a crusader clan, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she did not like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the idea that she would not be totally able to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevent Vlad Ward to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conquer the Inner Sphere.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She saw something in the sky and magnified to see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough of it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, she still could not make out what it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: There is something coming.
