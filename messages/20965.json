And I think I&#39;ve \n&gt; fallen too far behind in the story, and it wouldn&#39;t be fair to take \n&gt; back my chars. So, Yanshosh already has Fliq and Logo already has \n&gt; Starscream and Vulois. You guys can keep them, if it&#39;s all right \nwith \n&gt; you. Now, Soulstice and I were disscussing something that I could \ndo \n&gt; with Fliq and one of his chars, but Fliq is already with Yanshosh. \nSo \n&gt; I&#39;m giving Gotron to Soulstice, and he can use him as he wants. But \n&gt; that still leaves The Trainers and Savage up in the air. If you \nwant \n&gt; them, e-mail me. I&#39;m not sure I want to give possesion of all of \nthem \n&gt; to one person. I would be too much power. I may even keep one of \nthem \n&gt; just to make sure everything doesn&#39;t go out of control. But e-mail \nif \n&gt; you want them. Tomorrow at about this time I will have my new chars \n&gt; up. I have it all set out and everything, but I&#39;m try to work out \n&gt; kinks in the origin stories. So, I&#39;ll see you all tomorrow. And \nthank \n&gt; you all for being patient with me. It means a lot to me.\n\n\n"}}
