He transforms into\nhis\n&gt; robot mode but his left wing is in pain.  He had tried to use it to\ndeflect\n&gt; the shot but it must have been stronger than he anticipated.  &quot;No matter,\nI\n&gt; will still defeat you!&quot;  Out of each of his arms emerge double barreled\n&gt; blasters (similar to the original Optimus Primal&#39;s only more menacing).\nHe\n&gt; tries to move his wing but it is still stiff and sore from the shot.  He\n&gt; grimaces &quot;I will have to fight on the ground for now.&quot;  He spots Trinity\nand\n&gt; dives forward.  He places his right wing between her and Deemos and uses\nit\n&gt; to try and knock her backwards.  This done he lands and springs back out\nof\n&gt; the way.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
