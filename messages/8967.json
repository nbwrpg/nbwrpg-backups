She decided to sit for a while.  \nShe \n&gt; pulled the rat from her shoulder and held him. &quot;How does one little \n&gt; rodent like me get into these messes anyway? huh? Do you know my \n&gt; little friend?&quot; She held the rat up to her face  and looked at him. \n \n&gt; The rat reached out a paw and touched the end of her nose.  she \n&gt; chuckled, &quot;You don&#39;t know either huh? Oh well.  I&#39;ll get us out of \n&gt; this somehow.&quot;  She sat there for a while and didn&#39;t realize that \nshe \n&gt; had drifted off into sleep.\n&gt; The rat crawled up her arm and back to her shoulder.  It curled up \n&gt; against her neck and slept as well.\n\n\n"}}
