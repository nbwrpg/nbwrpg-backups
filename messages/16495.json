His heart lept because this was no enemy, indeed, this was his \nsavior. With Rampage he could be taken to Black Aracnia and that idiot would \nprovide him with a CR chamber.\n    A few trees fell to reveal the crab. He transformed and stood over \nMegatron who lay on the ground at the doorstep of the smashed vessle. he took \nout his gun and aimed it at the tyrant. &quot;And look at what I found...wont \nAracnia be happy.&quot;\n    Megatron began to ooze out the charm, &quot;A female? Why do you follow her? I \nwould have already taken hold of this planet...she just relocates.&quot;\n    Rampage lowered his gun. &quot;What are you saying, why did you come here?&quot;\n    His red eyes narrowed, &quot;To join you...I left Waspinator and Adrax. Theyre \nidiot. At least with this fraction I could put in some of my intelligence.&quot; \nHe lied.\n    Rampage thought it over and yanked Megatron off the ground, &quot;And if i \ntake you to Aracnia....you will?&quot;\n    &quot;I will follow her and try my hardest to join the Predacons. Now lets get \nto base before some undesierables arrive.&quot;\n    They departed.\n\n"}}
