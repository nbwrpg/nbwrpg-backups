That too was something I got ridicul=\r\ned for.  One day they went too far with their snide commentary and I got in=\r\nto a severe altercation with the two of them.  I&#39;m not proud of this mind y=\r\nou, but I can&#39;t deny that it happened.  The fight ended with considerable d=\r\namage to me and the two of them, but more so to them.  Ultra Magnus had to =\r\nliterally pry me off of them because of the strength advantage I had over t=\r\nhem.  It wasn&#39;t long before we were all brought to Optimus Prime due to our=\r\n dispute that I admit that I started, and he was not happy with all three o=\r\nf us.  He did not discriminate against any of us and gave us our reprimands=\r\n as equals all at the same time.  He then told us that the lesson to be lea=\r\nrned was that we needed to work as a team if we&#39;re ever to get over our dif=\r\nferences.  The brothers were not thrilled about that and neither was I .  B=\r\nut we still did as we were instructed, we worked together during a weeks ti=\r\nme, learning how to cooperate and learn about who we really were on the ins=\r\nide.  We never thought it would work until..&quot;\n\nHe gives a sigh.\n\nIt was dur=\r\ning one of our famous battles on Cybertron, we were under heavy fire by the=\r\n Seekers and and they were much faster in flight than we were on wheels.  S=\r\nide Swipe was on my left and Sunstreaker was on my right, a good distance a=\r\nhead.  I tried to keep up with them but at the time my alt form was more su=\r\nited for strength rather than speed.  It took only one shot from the seeker=\r\ns to destroy the road ahead of me, taking the twins with it.  At that time =\r\nour differences meant nothing to me and I quicky shifted into robot mode, w=\r\nhile still in motion, mind you, I slid on my chest for a good twenty feet, =\r\nreached out and caught their back bumpers just before the fell hood first i=\r\nnto a large bottomless void, created by the seekers.  They quickly transfor=\r\nmed but I still held onto them.  As soon as they turned around, I retained =\r\nmy position so they could climb to safety.  I was never in so much pain in =\r\nmy life after that but for the first time, they were extremely thankful for=\r\n what I had done, and they apologized for all the ridicule they inflicted o=\r\nn me and so I did the same and we shook hands.  After that, we embraced eac=\r\nh other, thankful we all made it out in one piece.  I have a feeling the sa=\r\nme could be so with my sister, Rattrap and Wheelie.
