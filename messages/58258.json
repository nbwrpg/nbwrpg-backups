He and Celeron met in mid-air about half way between the two places and they were both almost hit by the firepower of the angry prisoner.\n\n&quot;Why would you imprison somebody with their weapons still weapons?&quot; Celeron angrily asked Tigon (the warden).\n\nTigon hadn&#39;t waited to listen to Celeron, he was already locked in a battle with the prisoner.\n\nThe prisoner fired a volley of three shots which hit Tigon in the chest.  Tigon blasted the prisoner with his main gun, and then kicked the prisoner out of the air.\n\nCeleron decided to sneak over to the pod and see what he could learn.\n\nThe prisoner got back up and got up real close to Tigon.\n\n&quot;You won&#39;t take me back!  NEVER!&quot; at that, he started firing violently.\n\nTigon tried to shield his face with his arm; he tripped and fell over backwards down a hill.  The prisoner saw his chance and jumped on Tigon.\n\nCeleron decided to intervene (there would always be time to pick through the pod later) he charged up his arm cannons and sneaked up behind the raging prisoner.  Tigon was not moving and the prisoner was trying to break open the armor on his back.  Celeron fired both of his cannons pointblank into the prisoner.  He was blown back a few yards and fell into the sand.\n\nCeleron decided that if he didn&#39;t act now, he&#39;d lose too and could possibly die.  He grabbed a pair of handcuffs from Tigon&#39;s tools, and he shot at the prisoner to make sure he was down.  When cuffed the prisoner, the prisoner tried to break free.  Tigon reactivated just in time to see Celeron attempting to disarm the prisoner.\n\n&quot;This prisoner has a protective field that keeps him from being disarmed.  The only way I could detain him, was to render him unconscious.&quot;\n\nThe prisoner was still struggling, Tigon took a device from his kit and strapped it to the prisoner&#39;s neck.\n\n&quot;Now we can momentarily control him.&quot; Tigon explained.\n\nCeleron kicked the prisoner who was now powerless to resist him.  Tigon glared at Celeron and Celeron immediately stopped.\n\nWhen they got back into the ship The Warden chained the prisoner to the wall and had Celeron guard him.  Tigon then prepared a chamber to keep the prisoner in.\n\n&quot;Hey...isn&#39;t there some way to disarm him?&quot; Celeron asked.\n\n&quot;I haven&#39;t found a way to.  I&#39;ve been trying for several years.  He has an energon field that is generated when someone tries to tamper with his weapons.  I&#39;ve given up trying&quot;\n\nCeleron thought that this was a challenge worth trying.  He rubbed his hands together and schemed.\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\n\nDATE: Wed, 24 Sep 2003 14:24:26\nFrom: &quot;Alex .&quot; &lt;rm2kmidi@...&gt;\nTo: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\n&gt;The radio beeped....\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;This is Celeron....

Four seconds later, Celeron had been blown back 600 yards.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Armor 20%.....&quot;  said his onboard computer.\n&gt;\n&gt;Celeron charged up the cannon on his right arm and steadied it with his left.  Once he got a lock on the prisoner who was rapidly closing on him, he fired and blew it back about half as far as he had been blown back.  Celeron realizing that he&#39;s out matched began to run.\n&gt;\n&gt;The prisoner had full flight capability and as they flew around for a while Celeron discovered that it was also well armed.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Armor at 10%.......Target at estimated 75%&quot; read the computer.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Arrrgggg!&quot; Celeron grunted as he attacked.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;{Bleep}  Celeron....I have the equipment, I&#39;ll be out there ASAP....standby.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;(To be continued)\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Message: 4\n&gt;&gt;   Date: Tue, 23 Sep 2003 03:49:36 -0000\n&gt;&gt;   From: &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: Celeron--Salvge\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;StarStorm::\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Starstorm looked all things that had happned , she hid herself and \n&gt;&gt;waited thinking what she will do next? what sould be the best to do\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bob The  Builder&quot; &lt;rm2kmidi@l...&gt; \n&gt;&gt;wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; After an hour or so; Celeron had dug out the pod.

He pulled \n&gt;&gt;the lid open and saw a pair of eyes looking back at him.  Malicous \n&gt;&gt;looking eyes.  He slammed the lid shut an locked it.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; He brushed off the side of the pod and found that this was one of \n&gt;&gt;the prisioners from the ship.  An especially violent prisioner \n&gt;&gt;because a few seconds later he began to try to break out of the pod.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I better call the Warden.  He runs away just as the pod errupts in \n&gt;&gt;flames.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Message: 1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;   Date: Mon, 15 Sep 2003 07:45:49 -0700\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;   From: &quot;Vryl The Cranberry Hag&quot; &lt;rm2kmidi@l...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: Celeron--Salvage\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Celeron steped outside the ship.  It was a boring night, he had \n&gt;&gt;solved all their problems and now the captain had been having him \n&gt;&gt;repair stuff.  Once his task was done, instead of getting another, \n&gt;&gt;he quickly sneaked out.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;He half flew, half walked up to the top of the sandy hill which \n&gt;&gt;was right next to the ship.  Then he started a scan for anything \n&gt;&gt;interesting.  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Searching........some metal, some mice, a bug....&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Somthing caught his attention.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;....ooooOOO  small pod.....&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;It was quite a ways away so he had to hike about 13 minutes to \n&gt;&gt;another mountain about 10 clicks south.  When he arrived at the \n&gt;&gt;object he discovered that it was buryed about 80% of the way into \n&gt;&gt;the sand.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Its buried.....time to get out the old shovel....&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;(To be continued)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;____________________________________________________________\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Get advanced SPAM filtering on Webmail or POP Mail ...
