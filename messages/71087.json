He was always ready to kick a f=\r\new enemy heads in.\n\n&quot; Miserable slag headed scrap heaps!  If they think the=\r\ny&#39;re gonna get the best of us, Wing Caliber, they&#39;re wrong!  C&#39;mon!  We sti=\r\nll have an Ark to defend!&quot;\n\nHe takes out his largest blast cannon, and quic=\r\nkly charges into battle, hoping to wipe out a few unwanted pests.\n\nMeanwhil=\r\ne, deeper into the Ark Tucson uses his own charismatic stealth to navigate =\r\nin the room, thinking what Night Razor may be thinking as well.  He uses sh=\r\narp hearing to pick up the smallest of sounds, even those deemed to be comp=\r\nletely silent.  He pays close attention to how the ground seems to vibrate =\r\nunder his feet, giving him indication that although hidden, he could tell w=\r\nhere his opponent was.  He slowly brings Straight Shot around.  With one of=\r\n his arms injured, he had to do things in reverse.  With the good arm, hold=\r\n the weight of his weapon, and with the bad arm, pull the trigger.  He had =\r\noften practiced alternating between his hands, and was glad he had done so.=\r\n  Being ambidextrous was an attribute.  He loads an arrow specifically desi=\r\ngned to be barbed and most difficult to remove.  He knew that it was better=\r\n just to disable his enemy rather than destroy him.  He needed Nightrazor f=\r\nor questioning.  Most effective area of targeting, would be the knee joint =\r\nImbed the arrow in a joint and his opponent would find it most difficult to=\r\n abmulate, yet it would not kill or destroy him.  \n\nNow within striking dis=\r\ntance, as determined by his sonar sensors, he sends out short pulse emissio=\r\nns to pinpoint his area of targeting.  His reading is quick, yet, anything =\r\ncould happen at this point.  He aims, and attempts to launch an arrow deep =\r\ninto his enemy&#39;s knee, if his calculations were correct.\n\n&quot;Steady Straight =\r\nShot.  We need to make this count.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot programs her mechanisms =\r\nfor optimal effeciency.\n\n&quot; Talk about a shot in the dark. Okay, let&#39;s do th=\r\nis.&quot;\n\nOutside the Ark, Night Shift quickly scrambles around the enemy fire,=\r\n brought upon by the Sweeps and is quick to cover Rat Trap who is also tryi=\r\nng to ellude them as well.\n\n&quot;Woah!  Okay, that&#39;s not workn&#39;!  Rat Trap we n=\r\need a new game plan!&quot;\n\nRat Trap scurries out of the way of Waspinator&#39;s bla=\r\nsts.\n\n&quot;Gahh!  You&#39;re right!  So, what&#39;dya suppose we do?!&quot;\n\nNight Shift qui=\r\nckly dodges more fire and gets close to Rat Trap, transforming into SUV mod=\r\ne on the fly, as he gets his buddy inside his cab.\n\n&quot;First things first, sl=\r\nip inta somethn&#39; with more speed. Whew, at least I can dodge better on whee=\r\nls.&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks up in the rear view.\n\n&quot;They&#39;re gain&#39;n on us!  C&#39;mon, w=\r\nhatever it is you&#39;re plann&#39;n ta do ya better do it fast!&quot;\n\nNight Shift now =\r\neyes an area of canyon where it appears to be like a tunnel.  Large enough =\r\nfor a SUV to speed through, but not large enough for a plane to fly through=\r\n safely.  \n\n&quot;Heeeey, I got it.&quot;\n\nRat Trap catches on.\n\n&quot;Oooohhhh lure &#39;em i=\r\nn but they can&#39;t fly out.  Or through for that matter..   Okaaay, I&#39;ll go o=\r\nut on your roof,&#39;n lure &#39;em in, you keep your wheels turn&#39;n and try not ta =\r\nget a flat tire.&quot;\n\nNight Shift opens his window.\n\n&quot;Sounds like a plan ta me=\r\n.  Okaay, let&#39;s have some fun.&quot;\n\nRat Trap scurries to his roof, and gets in=\r\nto beast mode.  He soon starts a taunting dance to try and lure the enemy h=\r\nis way.\n\n&quot; HEY, AIR HEADS, DOWN HERE!  WE KNOW YA WANT US, SO C&#39;MON, WE DAR=\r\nE YA!&quot;\n\nNight Shift also starts his taunting gestures.\n\n&quot;I know you want a =\r\npiece of my tailpipe, c&#39;mon, bet your ugly afts ya can&#39;t catch me!&quot;\n\nWith h=\r\nis wheels, he spins dust and dirt into the air, adding smoke from his dual =\r\nexhaust system for added insult.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cycl=\r\nonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In the computer control room Legacy con=\r\ntinued to work to keep as many of the\n&gt; main systems from being fried by th=\r\ne wave that had been coming from Tuscon.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor =\r\ncontinues working trying to insolate the most important parts of\n&gt; the ark =\r\nand he said &quot;HYDRAS IS A COMPLETE FOOOL!!!!...

With a roar, he replies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You got it=\r\n Sir! Consider this creep as good as junk!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus looked =\r\nat Uproar, &quot;I know you and Leo II can handle it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A call comes in to R=\r\nodimus from Torca, leader of the Fuzors. &quot;Sir! We are\n&gt; under attack by the=\r\n Predacons.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus nodded as he looked over at Ramulus, Ramulus nodd=\r\ned back at Rodimus.\n&gt; &quot;Elita.&quot; Rodimus said to his his little one. &quot;I will =\r\nhave to leave you with\n&gt; Ramulus so I can go defend the Ark.

He looks over to Wing Caliber while holding his chest.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Whewww, ohh boy, talk about a major pulsator stopper. I could so fai=\r\nnt\n&gt; right now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He catches his breath as he wipes off his forehead=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I hope the rest of our team&#39;s havn&#39; as much good luck as we&#39;re h=\r\naving.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;SLAG!&quot; Wing Caliber said from the main console on =\r\nthe bridge. With a few\n&gt; deft movements of his fingers he brings up the mai=\r\nn view screen. &quot;Hydras and\n&gt; several sweeps are attacking.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wing Calib=\r\ner turned to look at Quickstride, &quot;It would seem that this is not\n&gt; over ye=\r\nt.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wing Caliber was attempting to bring main external weapons online =\r\nor the\n&gt; shields, but at the moment nothing was working.\n&gt; \n&gt; A call came i=\r\nn from Legacy, &quot;We are attempting to bring shields and/or\n&gt; weapons back on=\r\nline, please stand by.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Tucson too, a=\r\npproaches the ninja intruder, and ignores that\n&gt; little warning about his e=\r\nnergy reserves going low. He had dealt with\n&gt; intruders of the dark many ti=\r\nmes, and being visually impaired, he knew how\n&gt; to unlock their secrets of =\r\nsteath. He nodds to Legacy&#39;s reply.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Understood Legacy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;SNI=\r\nP&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus, this is Tucson. I&#39;ve approached the area where the intr=\r\nuder is\n&gt; located. I&#39;m hoping the doors close properly to ensure capture. I=\r\n sense this\n&gt; enemy is much like myself, and instead of putting Uproar and =\r\nLeo ll in grave\n&gt; danger, I will take on the intruder personally. He has cr=\r\nossed the line in\n&gt; my envronment, and it&#39;s time he pays the price by someo=\r\nne who is as versed\n&gt; in stealth as he is. I ask you to call back Uproar an=\r\nd Leo ll to prevent\n&gt; further harm to them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; His optics narrow. He =\r\ndraws Straight Shot in his hands, to begin his\n&gt; little game of cat and mou=\r\nse.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus replied, &quot;Uproar and Leo should be about there =\r\nas well. I will send\n&gt; them a message. I am on the way out to protect the A=\r\nrk!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Rodimus continued towards the door he sent a message to Uproar=\r\n and Leo,\n&gt; &quot;Hold back! Tuscon said he would take the battle against the in=\r\ntruder.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OUTSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hydras continue fightti=\r\nng the maximals\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside the Ark, Night Shift quickly transforms and=\r\n charges the enemy with\n&gt; a plasma riffle in hand, firing rounds, hoping to=\r\n strike at least Scourge or\n&gt; Cyclonus, in hopes to disable them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\n We got some serious bolts ta pick with you punks!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap also f=\r\nires his own weaponry.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah! Let&#39;s see how you guys like be&#39;n trap=\r\nped like rats! CHAAARGE!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside the battle rages as Hy=\r\ndras, Scourge and the sweeps attempt to reign\n&gt; down fire on the more land =\r\nbound Maximals. The sweeps fan out, using their\n&gt; superior maneuverability =\r\nto its greatest advantage as they try to come at\n&gt; the Maximals from all si=\r\ndes at once!\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap and Nightshift&#39;s weapons fire back up into the a=\r\nir, although this\n&gt; time it seems to be of no avail as the sweeps twist and=\r\n turn to avoid them.\n&gt; The sweeps are nothing if not smooth and agile!\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The sweeps come back for another run when Silverbolt and Noctorro sweep in=\r\n\n&gt; from around one side, their weapon&#39;s fire cutting into the sweeps, damag=\r\ning\n&gt; one, and sending another falling to the ground with a plume of smoke =\r\nand\n&gt; fire trailing after it!\n&gt; \n&gt; The sweeps seemed temporarily stunned wi=\r\nth the Fuzor&#39;s and the Maximal&#39;s\n&gt; charge into the battle, that is until Cy=\r\nclonus, Deepstryke and Waspinator\n&gt; show up!\n&gt; \n&gt; Waspinator angles in, ope=\r\nning fire on Rat Trap, &quot;Waspinator say he getting\n&gt; tired of blowing up Max=\r\nimals!&quot; he chuckled as he said this, his wings\n&gt; buzzing as he continued fi=\r\nring at Rat Trap. &quot;Then again maybe not!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile the floating mobil=\r\ne cannon slash weapons satellite floats in the\n&gt; air, orienting its powerfu=\r\nl main gun on Nightshift and opening up with\n&gt; bursts from his powerful ion=\r\n blast cannons!\n&gt; \n&gt; However last, but definitely NOT least Cyclonus floats=\r\n in, looking majestic\n&gt; and almost regal as he maneuvered in over the battl=\r\ne. In his jet mode he\n&gt; looked to be like a hawk or an eagle, staring down =\r\nat some bit of prey on\n&gt; the ground, waiting for just the right time to pou=\r\nnce on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a small click from beneath his wings and then twin=\r\n pylons drop from\n&gt; them, their aft sends igniting and they take off target=\r\ning the Maximals\n&gt; below!!\n&gt; \n&gt; *It would seem that this battle has begun i=\r\nn earnest!*\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
