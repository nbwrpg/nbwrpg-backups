HE steped out revealing beutiful, \nalmost golden feathers as he let out the cry of a hawk followed by \nhis own voice.\n\nSunhawk:  Sunhawk Maximize.\n\nHe transformed back into himself.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; He sees the the external sensore were brough back. He connects some \nwires, fixing the internal sensors. He gets up, brushing himself \noff. &quot;Hmm, organic beast modes will help. As for the rest of us who \nprefer mechanical modes, we&#39;ll have to inselate ourselves with the \nsame technology.&quot;He checks the sensors.&quot;Damn! The ship looks like \nslag. But could have been worse, we could have crashed on Quintessa, \nor into Unicron.&quot;\n&gt; He laughed at the joke only he, and maybe history buffs, would get.\n&gt; \n&gt; {Talos}\n&gt; Deck 2, CR Chamber room\n&gt; \n&gt; Talos had moved through the damaged ship and ascended the stairs to \ndeck two where the main generators and CR chambers were located. \nAfter recieving Sunhawks and Hot Rod&#39;s reports he nodded before \nmoving to a communications hub that wasn&#39;t sparking and turned on \nship wide broadcasting, &quot;Sensors have detected massive energon \nreadings outside the ship, all personnel should report to the CR \nChamber bay for alterate form protection, do not stray far from the \nship before you have done this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Closing the channel he moved to a console and began typing, on the \ntop of the ship a hatch slid open freeing an extending pole that \nbegan scanning the surrounding area for compatible forms. After \nseveral seconds the machine stayed at a low hum holding a list of \navailable alternate forms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Entering one of the CR chambers he let the nanobots change his \ncasing to more suit the transformation to beast mode. When the pod \nopened again Talos stepped out in his mammoth form. &quot;Talos, \nMAXIMIZE!&quot; He spoke as his body adjusted back to it&#39;s robotic form. \nOpening the comm to the bridge again he spoke, &quot;Might want to repair \nthat destroyed viewing portal there guys, the damage has probably \nrendered the bridges protective fields offline or at least unstable \nthough from the time frame I&#39;m guessing unstable so be careful don&#39;t \nwant you guys slipping into stasis lock...&quot;\n\n\n"}}
