He looked as if he were about to say\nsomething when WING CALIBER placed a hand lightly on his shoulder and\ndirected his attention to WHEELIE who by this time had slid past RAT\nTRAP and STRAIGHT SHOT.\n\n&gt; And not drawing a weapon, &quot;If you two think that is worth an &#39;oops&#39; I&#39;d hate\n&gt; to see you take things out of your caboose.  If that&#39;s the best that you two\n&gt; can do, I&#39;ll say I&#39;m sorry to the two of you.  Since you both can&#39;t do that,\n&gt; I&#39;ll say it&#39;s not worth being a brat.  If you two can barely work so well,\n&gt; then I&#39;d hate to see you in a shell.  No offense, but if you can&#39;t do that,\n&gt; it&#39;s not worth trying to hit you up for chat.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Leaning back against the wall, then turning his attention back to LEO PRIME,\n&gt; and crossing his arms over as the discussion turned back to RODIMUS.\n&gt;\n\nLEO looked back from WHEELIE to TUSCON, visably brining his own anger\ninto check. &quot;Clear the room.&quot; LEO PRIME said to the others. He glanced\nat WING CALIBER, &quot;And keep an optic on RAT TRAP, STRAIGHT SHOT and\nWHEELIE, I will need to talk with them as well.&quot;\n\nWING CALIBER nodded as he gestured for the others to leave the room as\nLORD ELDER left pursing his lips thoughtfully.\n\nThere was a brief glance from LEGACY and SANTON from the other room.\nThey were completely isolated from what was goin on in this room, but\nTUSCON&#39;s outburst clearly had been heard in there. They quickly went\nback to work trying to save SILVERBOLT&#39;s life.\n\nLEO PRIME just looked at TUSCON as he waited for the room to clear his\narms hanging loosely at his sides. His optics on the Maximal Prime who\nwas clearly becoming more unstable as time progressed, the concern for\na brother Maximal prime was warring with the anger he had burning in\nhis spark, and it was written all over his faceplate.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
