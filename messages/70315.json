Being a large truck, Tucson is \n&gt; far too heavy to go too fast in such a short length of time, so 0 to 60 \n&gt; sounds just about right.\n&gt;\n&gt; BIC:\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson didn&#39;t care about surface or internal damage at this time, he was \n&gt; far more concerned about keeping his comrades safe from harm.  Quickstride \n&gt; quickly goes top side to see if Talon needs assistance as Straight Shot \n&gt; quickly attends to Perceptor.  Both of which find themselves attempting to \n&gt; ward off the enemy with either arrow or high powered gun fire.  The \n&gt; insects atop Tucson were posing a major threat to Legacy and Talon, as \n&gt; Quickstride tries desperately to back them up, shooting repeatedly to \n&gt; attempt to get the enemy off Tucson&#39;s trailer before they did any harm to \n&gt; his comrades.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Woahh, a little more pest control than I bargained for! Legacy, Talon, \n&gt; you two okay?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot too, finds herself firing off arrows just to try and slow \n&gt; the insect beings down, while she desperately tries to help Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That does it!  I wish these ugly bugs would turn around and get \n&gt; themselves caught in a spider web!  Hang in there Perceptor, I got your \n&gt; back!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson was becomming more and more annoyed by the insects.  Something had \n&gt; to be done before they destroyed his comrades.  He felt it was HIS \n&gt; responsibility to see to the welfare of his fellow Autobots and Maximals. \n&gt; He was the one in charge of their well being.  He hoped by attempting a \n&gt; Sonar blast attack, he could immoblize the bug brigade.  It would be a \n&gt; bold move on his part, and this he knew would hurt Perceptor immensely, \n&gt; since he was a predacon.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Perceptor, I need you to turn off your audio sensors for a short time. \n&gt; I&#39;m going to attempt a sonar blast which I hope will slow things down for \n&gt; us enough to get to Rodimus.  That way I know I will not harm you when I \n&gt; do emit this attack. Straight Shot, when I&#39;m through doing that, tap him \n&gt; on the shoulder to let him know it&#39;s safe to turn them back on.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Roger that Tucson Prime.  Okay Perceptor, to be on the safe side, it&#39;s \n&gt; best if you shut down your audio sensors now.  I&#39;ll tap you on the \n&gt; shoulder when we&#39;re all finished.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;supercyclonus&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, the image did not come through right. let me post it here directly \n&gt;&gt; on the website, it might come through better. :)??\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * = Wall of tunnel\n&gt;&gt; (1-7) numbers are insect troopers (1&2 are actually on Tuscon)\n&gt;&gt; S=Straight shot (Inside Tuscon&#39;s Cab)\n&gt;&gt; Q=Quickstride (Inside Tuscon&#39;s Cab)\n&gt;&gt; T=Talon (On top of Tuscon)\n&gt;&gt; Legacy (On Top of Tuscon)\n&gt;&gt; P=Perceptor (Driver&#39;s side rear)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *     1  2     *\n&gt;&gt; *     ____     *\n&gt;&gt; *  4   SQ   3  *\n&gt;&gt; *  6    T   5  *\n&gt;&gt; *       L   7  *\n&gt;&gt; *    P ___     *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
