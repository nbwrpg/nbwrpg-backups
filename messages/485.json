She swung her head around and flexed her front claws. \n&lt;P&gt;&quot;This isn&#39;t about you,&quot; she snarled. &quot;If you were smart, you&#39;d keep you mouth shut!&quot; She turned her head away. &quot;Don&#39;t start with me. I&#39;m not in the best of moods! I never am!&quot; She growled, and looked back to the area where the Maximal base would be. &quot;Where is it? Where in the Pit is it?&quot; She snapped her head to Carnage. &quot;Where is the base?&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;The Maximals didn&#39;t have enough techology or power on their ship to cloak it.
