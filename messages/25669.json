Heading into the trees, they notice that all of the \nlocal wildlife was either gone or laying low. They both immedietly became \nnervous, as they new something was dreadfully wrong. Shadow Cat motioned to \nSnow Tech and they both pulled outtheir weapons, Shadow Cat her electrical \nblaster and Snow Tech his ice cannon. They walked silently and quickly, not \ndesturbing anything with their passage.*\n\n&quot; Snow Tech, what do you think t......&quot;\n\n*Shadow Cat never got to finish her sentance, for out of a large stand of \ntrees, the troop of alien droids burst out and began firing at them. Shadow \nCat squeeled and ran, while Snow tech let loose a gasius rumble, and ran the \nopposite direction that Shadow Cat ran.*\n\nSnow Tech: &quot; EeeeeEeeeeEeeeeeeeeeEeeeeeEeeeeeeeee!&quot;\n\n* The bots immedietly split up into two groups and purseued after the \nfleeing bots. Shadow Cat burst from the bush, right into the middle of the \nbattle field. She gave no thought but kept on running, kicking up dust and \ndebrise as she ran. Meanwhile, Snow Tech was running out of the bush, near \nwere Iron Raptor had given her orders. He burst from the bush in a cloud of \nleaves and twigs, feet going full speed. He ran into the feild, hoping that \nthe other bots would confuse the aliens.\nThe Aliens on the other hand, smashed the surrounding trees to oblivion, \nmaking two large openings in the tree line. They entered the feild, and \nlooked around, confused, where where the bots?....*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
