His side is much\neasier to penetrate as the sides are more sloping, as if made for a\nvehicle to drive up from.\n\nSteam is venting from the tunnel entrance making it very difficult to\nsee as apparently water and magma are meeting violently somewhere much\nfurther inside this tunnel.\n\nAhead of Tuscon very little can be discerned as the steam seems to\nbillow out like smoke, but up ahead what sounds like metal scraping on\nstone can be heard as if something is being dragged, but quickly\nenough the sound stops.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
