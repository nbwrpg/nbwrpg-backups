But he knew if he =\r\ndid that, everyone he cared about, including Rodimus, would probably suffer=\r\n great damages.  He wasn&#39;t about to do that.  Night Shift could see just by=\r\n the way Tucson Prime was standing, as still as he was, and as solidly stan=\r\nced, that he was up to something and nothing too common either.  He always =\r\nknew when he was using his sonar emitter, as he closes his eyes, simulating=\r\n his visually impaired sensation as all sonar equipment comes online at ful=\r\nl tilt.  Extra sharp hearing, thermal sensory and touch sensory boards were=\r\n kicking in once more.  With his eyes closed, he knew his greatest of silen=\r\nt weapons could be deployed.  He concentrates, and sends a frequency and at=\r\ntempts to send a painful frequency that would only effect Decepticon and Pr=\r\nedacon programming, to the point where he thought he could cause some minor=\r\n but bothersome malfunctions, giving them all time to escape safely, yet no=\r\nt really causing any major damage.  Night Shift feels a slight vibration co=\r\nursing through his entire chassey.  And it was visible by the way he seemed=\r\n to move slightly without even having his engine on.\n\nTucson then addresses=\r\n everyone.\n\n&quot;Kup, you&#39;re forgiven.  Just don&#39;t let it happen again.  And Ro=\r\ndimus, Just because trust is hard to earn, it doesnt mean I don&#39;t have fait=\r\nh in your abilities.  Never lose touch of faith, for it will strengthen you=\r\n against weakness.  Now, for those of you not used to this, this may effect=\r\n you in some shape or form.  I appologize if it does.  I am not aiming this=\r\n attack on any of you.  Autobots, Maximals, brace yourselves.  I am going i=\r\nnto full sonic sonar attack mode.  Starting in ten, nine, eight, seven, six=\r\n, five, four, three, two... One... Deploying now.&quot;\n\nNight Shift braces hims=\r\nelf.\n\n&quot; Ohhh yeah, I bet these uglies didn&#39;t know ya had this under your ma=\r\nnifold.  Heh, this kinda tickles my axles. &quot;\n\nWhile Tucson Prime works from=\r\n the inside, Rat Trap and Quickstride now try to work from the outside.  Ra=\r\nt Trap transforms into his rodent form as Quickstride gets back into equine=\r\n form. They trot up to the fortress, and then start to feel something vibra=\r\nting through their bodies.  And then realize that it was far best to stay b=\r\nack.\n\n&quot; Woahh, feel that Quickstride?  That&#39;s somethn&#39; only Wheels can do. =\r\nWell, at least all it does is tickle my relays..&quot;\n\nHe starts to giggle as d=\r\noes Quickstride.\n\n&quot; Aw geeze, that does tickle!  I can&#39;t stop laughing!&quot;\n\nQ=\r\nuickstride falls on his back, stricken by laughter due to the ticklish feel=\r\ning he gets from Tucson&#39;s sonar emittier. Yet he was not the only one being=\r\n tickled by it.  Inside, Night Shift could barely keep himself from lauging=\r\n.\n\n&quot; Aww maaan, big bot, whatever you&#39;re usn&#39; it&#39;s don&#39; a number on my rela=\r\nys, I can&#39;t stop laughn&#39;!&quot;  \n\nTucson replies.\n\n&quot; Well, it&#39;s not like I didn=\r\n&#39;t warn you.  Good thing it&#39;s not hurting you.&quot;\n\nA transmission comes from =\r\nRat Trap.\n\n&quot; Wheels, whatever you&#39;re do&#39;n in there, ya gotta tone it down o=\r\nr else we&#39;re gonna die laughn&#39;!&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly20=\r\n02@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras/Kup/Darkhawk:\n&gt; \n&gt; Darkhawk arrived to the area a=\r\nnd he opened fire against Rodimus and the \n&gt; other maximal.
