Shadow \n&gt; &gt; Star, you will command group Tripod, with you and\n&gt; &gt; Burrock. You will \n&gt; &gt; attack the most northern base (ooc: maxies). Talon\n&gt; &gt; and me, as group \n&gt; &gt; Trian, will attack the nearest one (ooc: preddies).\n&gt; &gt; Remember, this is \n&gt; &gt; a hit and run.
