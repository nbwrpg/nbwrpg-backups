That&#39;s why I asked Airly if Myrmidon&#39;s command to put up the\nshield was successful. \n\nIn either case, I just wanted to bring out these points to keep us all\non the same sheet of music. \n\nPreston\n\n\n--- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt; Malice dropped down to one knee to avoid the armor piercing rounds\n&gt; and roll past Myrmidon.� He drew his chainsword and launched the tip\n&gt; at a control panel to drop a blast partition between them.� After he\n&gt; got to his feet he locked the partition in place and ran down the\n&gt; corridor to drop more partitions from a terminal.� He then overloaded\n&gt; the terminal&#39;s buffer with jibberish and then moved deeper into the\n&gt; base to continue backing up the computer systems.� He finally hacked\n&gt; the security system and shut down the autoguns and began looking for\n&gt; the captive Maximals.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, May 3, 2008 6:36:23 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Black Fortress\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Malice:\n&gt; &gt; The blow to the face was nothing to him as the soft tissue was\n&gt; quick\n&gt; &gt; to repair.� His free hand was fast to clamp onto Myrmidon&#39;s wrist\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; wrench it at what he hoped was a painful and damaging injury.� his\n&gt; &gt; other hand reached back and drew his katanna and spun it around and\n&gt; &gt; plunged it down toward Myrmidon.� He released his tail from the\n&gt; &gt; cieling to drop down and evade the fire for a moment, but he was\n&gt; sure\n&gt; &gt; now there would be lasting damage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myrmidon grunted as his arm was bent at an unaccustomed degree, as\n&gt; his\n&gt; servos protested. Slight sparks flew as his arm bent and fles and\n&gt; then\n&gt; resisted! It locked into place as he spun in place. \n&gt; \n&gt; A slow smile appeared on Myrmidon&#39;s face as Malice attempted to drive\n&gt; home the katana. At first it seemed as if it would be a death-lock\n&gt; shot, but at the last nano Myrmidon caught the blade on his forearm,\n&gt; the blade skitting and flashing on his armor as it cuts deep . . .\n&gt; and\n&gt; is deflected. \n&gt; \n&gt; But at the same time Myrmidon&#39;s shoulder mounted cannons reoriented\n&gt; themselves on Malice as the reconfigured thier ordinance. They click\n&gt; as\n&gt; they slide into place and blast with twin armor piercing rounds!\n&gt; \n&gt; Myrmidon&#39;s smile broadens!\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Myrmidon)\n&gt; \n&gt; ____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and \n&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
