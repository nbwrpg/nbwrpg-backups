I look forward to reading and catching up on all of the posts that I missed.\nThank you Yanshosh for adding the new address. I hope that this strange occurrence in Hot Mail does not last too long.\nAnd Fire Fox? I have sent no new posts with Dinobot since he was going to go off and fight the Alliance.\nI have heard from tmrattrap ( or now known as ironraptor) that you had sent a post that responds to my last post. Look forward to reading it and I will not post another concerning Dinobot until you have caught up.\nAgain, I look forward to the posts.\n \n                                Carnage.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
