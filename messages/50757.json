Of course, she\n&gt; couldn&#39;t expect him \n&gt; to know everything, but she did expect something\n&gt; else.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: Drawing first blood? Of course, it is an\n&gt; approach that \n&gt; minimizes losses, but where is the fun in that? We\n&gt; might as well start \n&gt; using dishonorable artillery right away.\n&gt; \n&gt; She enters the base before going on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: The bidding ritual is done in two parts.\n&gt; Before a battle, we \n&gt; issue a batchall -a battle challenge- and ask what\n&gt; forces the defender \n&gt; will use. After that, two commanders bid against\n&gt; each other to bring \n&gt; to least troops possible to achieve victory.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Owlhawk:  Each side agrees to send in a pre set\n&gt; either\n&gt; &gt; number or percent of warriors and they hold a\n&gt; battle\n&gt; &gt; to the first damage rather than death to determine\n&gt; who\n&gt; &gt; goes and who stays.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He hoped his complete guess lucked out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya was pleased.

Let us continue then. The Clans\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; developped another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; system that minimizes losses and promotes honor.\n&gt; It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is our bidding \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual.
