I am here to give \nyou a \n&gt; command. As you might know, I have been given Gorefeast&#39;s position. \nAs \n&gt; such, I am about to embark on a mission, and the council has given \nme \n&gt; free choice of my crew.

The \nrobot \n&gt; &gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had looked at right after was Bleeder, Shadow Star&#39;s superior \n&gt; &gt; officer. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; They had both talked, and Tyrael had explained his reason&#39;s for \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; choice. Bleeder had been in agreement. Now, Tyrael had to \nannounce \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the principal interested...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   He went to the junior officer&#39;s quarters. He hoped the young \n&gt; &gt; officer \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was there.
