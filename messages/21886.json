He spun around lashing his tail at the polar \nbear. his head flashed past Foxfingers hiding place snapping his \nteeth in a taunting manner.\n\nFoxfingers ducked his head all the way under the science station \nwhere he hid. &quot;Please don&#39;t eat me?&quot; he pleaded in complete horror as \nthe teeth snapped.\n\nLunarpine stepped a little closer ready to intervene at any moment.\n\nVeratis called to Foxfingers trying to get him away from \ndanger. &quot;You&#39;re a thief, remember, you can get out of any dead end.&quot; \nIf Foxfingers stayed in shock someone would have to go get him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She felt his knee hit her lower jaw. Her head lifted slightly from \n&gt; the impact. She roared and bit down on his shoulder. Sinking her \n&gt; large teeth into his flesh. Her hind legs bracing her, trying to \nhold \n&gt; him against the wall. She didn&#39;t want to kill this bot, but she was \n&gt; more of a recon bot. She was now physicaly able to fight, but \n&gt; mentally, she wasn&#39;t as prepared.
