Shadowcaster had known that some\nparts of coming back from the Matrix would be\nemtional, but he hadn&#39;t counted on how special it\nwould feel to be with his son Rattrap again. It had\nbeen a hard road for them when he&#39;d revealed himself\nto during the Beast Wars, with Rattrap initially\nblaming him for abaondoning him to grow up on the\nstreets after several failed Cybertronian Orphanages,\nbut the two had made their peace after Shadowcaster\nhad had his epiphany with the Matrix. They had just\nreally developed a strong father son bond when the\nNemesis attacked and Shadowcaster was forced to make\nthe ultimate sacrifice for everyone, including his\nson. He could still remember his last words spoken\nbefore he rammed into it on a direct line to Rattrap\n&quot;Forgive me&quot;.\n\nShadowcaster quietly approached Rattrap from behind,\ngently laid a hand on him and decloaked. &quot;I&#39;m right\nbehind you son.&quot; he answered beamingly.\n\n --- Tankor &lt;lordofdarkness11001@...&gt; wrote: &gt;\nRattrap &quot; Cheetor great to see you again.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rhinox &quot; Cheetor when the hell did you get here&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ba &quot; Hey KittyCat&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Optimus &quot; hey cheetor have you seen any sign of\n&gt; Silverbolt.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rattrap &quot; Hey cheetor do you know where ShadowCaster\n&gt; went?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OMWOS &lt;o_mighty_wife_of_shinigami@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Well then... since Tankor missed my post about\n&gt; Cheetor trying to \n&gt; talk to the other Maximals, I&#39;ll do a repost, but it\n&gt; may not work since \n&gt; I have no idea where everyones at now.\n&gt; ~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheetor&#39;s famous grin returned, &quot;Hey, you can&#39;t have\n&gt; all the fun now.&quot; \n&gt; He was excited, to see an old face back from the\n&gt; Matrix. He was \n&gt; beginging to think he was the only one that made it\n&gt; out processing when \n&gt; a familar squeky type voice floated to his ears. His\n&gt; mouth dropped open \n&gt; as he turned. That was it, he had gone insane, he\n&gt; was imaging things, \n&gt; hearing his own crews voices. His mind was still in\n&gt; a whirl after what \n&gt; Shadowcaster had told them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Rattrap? Rhinox?! BlackArachnia?!? Is it really you\n&gt; guys?&quot; His eyes \n&gt; widened. &quot;B...Big Bot?,&quot; he whispers as if he&#39;s\n&gt; afraid Optimus will \n&gt; dissaper before him.\n&gt; \n&gt; OMWOS\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo!
