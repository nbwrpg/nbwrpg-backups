She perched a while in a old \npine tree.  She waited a bit then took off again heading for the \nlake.  She just hoped that she would make it in time to help the bot \nwho called out for help.  \n\nShe finally made it to the lake that the bot had specified.\nShe looked around but didn&#39;t see anyone.  She flew around the lake \nand finally saw a bot laying on the sandy shore of the lake.  She \nflew down and transformed into bot mode.  She causiously approaced \nthe strange bot.  She looked and noticed that the bot was in stasis \nlock.  He was too big for her to carry, so she sat and waited.  When \nthe bot&#39;s internal repairs had done thier work, the bot would \nawaken.  She drew her gun and kept it ready, just in case. The bot \nwas laying just right, so she couldn&#39;t see it&#39;s symbol.  But since \nthe bot called out on the Maximal frequency, it was most likely a \nmaximal, she reasoned.  And put her gun away.  She sat and waited for \nthe bot to wake up.\n\n\n"}}
