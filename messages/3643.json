Raising his rifles, he fired a \ntotal of 8 lasers at Zardus, running off into the Ark, shields down.\n\n---\n\nKoga Shuko fired three optic blasts at Zardus, followed by a rocket from his \nmissile launcher.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor walked over to a downed Sona.  Taking out his energon blade, he \nslashed the blade down at her neck, attempting to decapitate her.  \n\n---\n\nNemesis howled, raising his rifle and firing twenty five shots across the \nbattlefield.  Six bolts heading for Rhinox, three for Serpentor, four for \nAntagony,  two at Killer, and five at Liono.\n\n\n"}}
