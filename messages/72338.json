He puts a hand over his\n&gt; mid section where most of the damage had been done.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ow, that wasn&#39;t too smart.  Well in any event, Wolfgang, you&#39;re lucky ya\n&gt; never had wheels.  Yeah they can get ya from point A ta point B in a\n&gt; relatively short time but, they can also get ya in a heap of trouble if ya\n&gt; don&#39;t pay attention ta what you&#39;re do&#39;n.  Look at me now, if I just paid a\n&gt; little more attention ta what was ahead, I wouldnt&#39;ve gotten myself totaled.\n&gt;  Oh yeah, I sure hope that when the future comes, that vehicles are driven\n&gt; respectfully.  Because if my mistake did this ta me, imagine what it\n&gt; might&#39;ve done ta the driver inside if I had one in me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes a deep breath, and braces for landing.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m just glad no one was in me, I dunno if I could stand liv&#39;n with the\n&gt; fact that I could&#39;ve killed someone, because of my mistake.&quot;\n\nSANTON stepped onto the shuttle and walked swiftly over to NIGHTSHIFT,\npulling a scanner out as he did so.SANTON was not tall per-se, but he\nwas wide and with the elephantine tusks sticking out large horns, he\nloked fairly intimidating. However most that knew him, knew that he\nwould never pick up a weapon to kill, although he was quite skilled in\nnon-lethal combat. &quot;What happened he said as he brought his large bulk\nover to stand in front of NIGHTSHIFT.\n\nRAMULUS wwas standing right next to NIGHTSHIFT keeping an optic on his\nvital signs. &quot;He tried to pick a fight with Snarl.&quot;\n\nThere was a chuckle from WOLFGANG, &quot;Yeah, he tried to hit Snarl in the\nfoot with his face!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, a few times in the horn too. I am not sure if he was all that\neffective though.&quot; RAMULUS said a broad smile on his face.\n\nGood natured banter from both as they tried to put a good face on a\nrather bad situation.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
