He heard a commotion near his \n&gt; &gt; apartment he, Megatronics, and their adoptive sister, Organics \n&gt; &gt; shared.  Several bots were gathered around the door, watching \n&gt; &gt; Megatronics stand over Organics.  Not menacing her, protecting \n&gt; her.  \n&gt; &gt; His brother was struggling with an appearently drunk, tenticuled, \n&gt; &gt; robot of unknown origin.  Neutronics pushed the gatering at the \n&gt; door \n&gt; &gt; aside and rushed the attacker.  He was knocked to the ground, but \n&gt; &gt; megatronics was able to knock the attacker away.  The mystery bot \n&gt; &gt; escaped through the window and into the night.  Megatronics \nhelped \n&gt; &gt; his brother to his feet.  They pull Organics up and Neutronics \nshut \n&gt; &gt; the door and rushed to his sister&#39;s side.  As he held her hand to \n&gt; &gt; reassure, his hand passed through her&#39;s, and the room grew black, \n&gt; &gt; Neutronics looked around, and instead of his protective older \n&gt; &gt; brother, the mighty Megatron stood rusting and laughing.  \n&gt; Neutronics \n&gt; &gt; covered his audio\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  recepters, until Megatron opened fire on them both.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice jolted awake, dropping the alarm clock in his hand.  \n&gt; &gt; Instantly, a monofiliment wire shot from his wrist.  it bounced \noff \n&gt; &gt; his index finger, pierced the clock housing, bounced off the \n&gt; &gt; insides, and exited to stick in the wall.  The clock slide down \nthe \n&gt; &gt; wire, till it rested on the floor.  He retracted the wire and \n&gt; looked \n&gt; &gt; around.  He saw Wolfblade was awake.  He picked Camoflage up \n&gt; gently, \n&gt; &gt; rested her in his lap, and swung his legs over the edge of the \n&gt; cargo \n&gt; &gt; net to face Wolfblade.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; :Good afternoon, I think.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She purred slightly as Malice stroked her head and nuzzled even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; closer to him.
