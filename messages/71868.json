Military strategy was one of his areas of\n&gt; expertise and it was a good opportunity to exercise his skills as a\n&gt; strategist.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; before I evolved into a Prime, I spent quite a few vorns assisting the\n&gt; Autobots in the military strategy department.  And this one here, is very\n&gt; much like something I&#39;ve seen before.  Not by Unicronians but by the\n&gt; Decepticons back in the days of the wars on Iacon.  I was only a rookie at\n&gt; the time but I&#39;ve always had a knack in this field of study so the officers\n&gt; gave me a chance to attempt to crack a very complex case.  It had to do with\n&gt; how they were causing Autobots to vanish on the battlefield.  As everything\n&gt; is now it was back then.  They vanished in various quadrants and when I used\n&gt; a holographic map and drew lines that connected those locations, it came up\n&gt; with an epicenter of activity around the drawn lines.  I told the officers I\n&gt; wasn&#39;t a hundred percent sure but it was possible that the location was the\n&gt; area we were looking for.  They investigated and they found the missing\n&gt; Autobots housed in an abandoned complex on Cybertron.   It was one of\n&gt; Shockwave&#39;s master plans that were intended to remain a mystery but he did\n&gt; not count on a not so average Autobot to figure it out.  I was always\n&gt; considered to be a bit strange, and off the beaten path.  But the council\n&gt; kept me on their team all the same.  They said due to my rebel like nature,\n&gt; that I would not be chosen as a commander but my skills were a great asset\n&gt; to them.  I was content with their decision all the same.  I was comfortable\n&gt; just being who I was.  So if I&#39;m not a good fit as a Prime, I respect their\n&gt; decision. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He returns to robot mode.  He looks to Leo Prime with a strategists\n&gt; expression.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I may be wrong about my theory but I&#39;m curious to see if this case is\n&gt; similar to the one I decoded back on Cybertron.   And if it is, we could\n&gt; even locate the purpetrator as well.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was an answering nod from LEO PRIME. &quot;Of course and I have seen\nthe recordings of that stratagy. What Shockwave was doing could be\ncalled a feint. He gave you something to be figured out, and yet it\nwas destract you from his more important goal.&quot;\nLEO FROWNED, &quot;Something that may be happening here.&quot; He looked at\nTUSCON as he spoke, &quot;But from what Wing Caliber tells me though is\nthat it did save them a lot of time which was useful in defeating\nSHockwave.&quot;\n\nThe screen changed as LEO entered the parameters that were known. The\napproximate place where CHEETOR was last seen as well as CYCLONUS and\nRODIMUS. &quot;Interesting.&quot; LEO said. &quot;It does seem that these soldiers\nwere all captured in a similar location, within perhaps several\nhundred miles from each other.&quot;\n\nPlugging the information on the screen the picture of that same jungle\nappeared again. &quot;It would seem that this same location is still being\npointed to.&quot; There was a slight shrug, &quot;But without knowing where\nPrimal was when he was taken it is hard to hazzard a guess.&quot;\n\nLEO looked up at TUSCON, &quot;Didn&#39;t the last report about Cheetor&#39;s\ncaptors say that they were Minion or at least the readings showed\nminion energy in use?&quot; He nodded as he stroked his chin thoughtfully.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
