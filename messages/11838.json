He leaped out of the pod and\nran hard as he could toward the entrance. &quot;Cmon get\nyour slaggin ass in gear!!&quot; he yelled back at\nLunarpine. He drew a pistol from a small compartment\nin his right leg and a plasma grenade from subspace.\nWhen he reached the entrance, he tossed the plasma\ngrenade at Hiss then took cover behind what was left\nof the Arks sheilding plates.\n--- KSLawdogg@... wrote:\n&gt; The Oblitercons/Nemesis \n&gt;\nEnforcer/Scattershot/Unitron/Serpentor/Oinker/Punch/Zergling:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer activated his comm. unit, sending a\n&gt; transmission to Dark \n&gt; One.  \n&gt; &quot;Dark One, status.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Nothing.

Nemesis\n&gt; Enforcer, your current \n&gt; leader, orders a strike against the Ark!  All forces\n&gt; assemble outside of the \n&gt; base, I repeat, all forces, assemble outside of the\n&gt; base!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Oinker got up from his recharge bed.  &quot;Alright, time\n&gt; fer sum action!&quot; he \n&gt; yelled, running out of his room for the outside like\n&gt; he had been ordered.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Zergling got up.  &quot;My loyalty, is at the current\n&gt; leaders service.&quot; he said, \n&gt; extending his claws out by 5 inches, running for\n&gt; where he was ordered to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Punch raised his rifle, walking out of the Alliance\n&gt; base, waiting.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron was closing in on the Alliance base.
