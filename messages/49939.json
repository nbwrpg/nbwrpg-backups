First one is to the\n&gt; south of this \n&gt; continent. The second one is in the bay on the first\n&gt; continent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Mmm... Vok, maybe? We shall see later... But\n&gt; we need some \n&gt; names for geographic positionning.

You shall help\n&gt; Talon preparing \n&gt; &gt; base defenses. Now that we are known, we are a\n&gt; prey. We wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; want \n&gt; &gt; to be eaten without biting back would we?
