She couldn&#39;t disable the duo before an alarm was raised - not this cl=\r\nose to the ARK.\n\nDistractin gthem was also risky, as it would still leave t=\r\nhe possibility they might call in a report first, and the ARK was too heavi=\r\nly armed, and even with many of it&#39;s personnel gone, too heavily fortified =\r\nto sneak into if they were on the alert.\n\nHer other options were risky, and=\r\n put too much to chance..\n\nSo, she did what she did best then.\n\nActed.\n\nSti=\r\nll cloaked, she transformed back to her robot mode, with nary a sound.  Art=\r\nfully slinking out of the way, she used an energon blade to slash at her, g=\r\niving the impressio upon a surface scan she had been badly beaten, damaged,=\r\n and tortured.  Leaving it upon close inspection to anyone but hopefully a =\r\nfield medic that she was on the verge of stasis lock.\n\nSetting an array of =\r\nsmoke grenades aobut her to simulate that she had just been tossed..\n\nShe w=\r\nent to fire her retro thrusters in reverse, a pre-recorded &#39;YEEHAW&#39; from QU=\r\nICKSTRIKE and the fading sounds of jet engines overhead as she &#39;slammed&#39; he=\r\nrself down over to the ground with a fading radio message &quot;Here&#39;s the garba=\r\nge back fer ya MAXIES!  Take out the trash fro us!&quot;\n\nThen, smashing hnersel=\r\nf over into the ground like she had been tossed from a great height.\n\nLet t=\r\nhe MAXIMAL&#39;s compassion be thier weakness, as it always was.\n\nOOC - Hope th=\r\nis leaves the most room for interaction!  Felt the setup was fair and give =\r\nsus a mor einteresting way to go about it rather than her trying to blast o=\r\nr sneak her way in.  \n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift continues to play the scared k=\r\nitty act as the spider now sits on his nose. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Wolfgang, this thing i=\r\ns creep&#39;n me out.  And how the pit did it get in here?\n&gt; \n&gt; He finally shak=\r\nes it off his nose, backs up and sniffs around.\n&gt; \n&gt; What if there&#39;s more o=\r\nf those spiders in here?  We gotta check this place out for stowaways.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Sent from my iPhone\n&gt; \n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As BLACKARACHNIA pressed foward she=\r\n could see the entrance to the ARK.\n&gt; &gt; It appeared to wide open. The two g=\r\nuards: NIGHTSHIFT and WOLFGANG\n&gt; &gt; appeared to be, at least temporarily, di=\r\nstracted with something else.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There were other MAXIMALS as well, b=\r\nut most of them seemed to be\n&gt; &gt; packing another ship or were generally goi=\r\nng about the business of\n&gt; &gt; trying to make repairs or modifications to the=\r\n ARK.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As BLACKARACHNIA stepped across the threshold, she might eve=\r\nn be able\n&gt; &gt; to &#39;feel&#39; the sensor net close about her. At the moment thoug=\r\nh, her\n&gt; &gt; cloak was holding it at bay. It wouldn&#39;t do it for ever, but it =\r\nwas\n&gt; &gt; still holding. A single mistep would be a dangerous one though.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Inside was the main hall of the ARK. Behind her was the way out, ahea=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; of her was the direction of the command center. Between her and that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; stood another problem.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was here that the loading of the sec=\r\nond ship was being done. LEO\n&gt; &gt; PRIME as well as NOCTORRO were moving thin=\r\ngs back and forth and\n&gt; &gt; directing others as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It would not b=\r\ne easy to get passed them, especially if NIGHTSHIFT and\n&gt; &gt; WOLFGANG starte=\r\nd nosing about more.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (OOC: Feel free to bounce off each other if y=\r\nou like)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
