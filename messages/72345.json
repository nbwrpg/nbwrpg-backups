Yet she\n&gt; &gt; appears in deep concentration as if coming upon =\r\nan important piece of a\n&gt; &gt; puzzle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Nope, nothing yet Talon but, =\r\nthere are a few aspects that kind of help ta\n&gt; &gt; narrow things down a littl=\r\ne bit.  First, from what we have all sensed, the\n&gt; &gt; energy IFF readings ap=\r\npear ta be Unicronian in nature.  So whoever it is,\n&gt; &gt; definitely must be =\r\na MINION of considerable power and they must be some sort\n&gt; &gt; of authority =\r\nfigure.  Like a military general who is a major tactician.  And\n&gt; &gt; that me=\r\nans they must be strong as well as smart.  I wonder if we would come\n&gt; &gt; up=\r\n with something by using those keywords ta do a digital intel search and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; see what that comes up with..&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rattrap nods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; It&#39;s worth=\r\n a try. But Legacy is the only bot with that kinda access ta\n&gt; &gt; that intel=\r\n.  But I bet he&#39;d help ya do a search if the three of us asked.\n&gt; &gt; It can&#39;=\r\nt hurt ta know who and what we&#39;re up against.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As SANTON ru=\r\nshed up onto the shuttle, follwed quickly enough by\n&gt; WINGCALIBER the other=\r\ns stayed on the pad in case they could be of\n&gt; other service.\n&gt; \n&gt; TORCA lo=\r\noked at STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;You could be right.&quot; He said as he\n&gt; stepped foward=\r\n into the conversation, his Fuzors stepping up as well.\n&gt; They were ready f=\r\nor action, well all except for SILVERBOLT who was\n&gt; still recovering in the=\r\n medbay.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I have read the reports.&quot; NOCTORRO said. &quot;I believe Legacy w=\r\nill be\n&gt; here shortly as well. I am sure LEO PRIME will have a few last min=\r\nute\n&gt; orders for him as he get&#39;s this mission underway.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LORD ELDER en=\r\ntered as well. &quot;Leo Prime is in conversation with Hydras,\n&gt; trying to close=\r\n the deal that Tuscon opened. If he can do that, we\n&gt; might get some extra =\r\nhelp.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked over at STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;So you think these new enemie=\r\ns are\n&gt; working with the Unicronians?&quot; He nodded as if giving the matter so=\r\nme\n&gt; serious thought. &quot;Perhaps.&quot; He looked at the others. &quot;Noctorro is\n&gt; ri=\r\nght Legacy will be here to answer as many questions as he can\n&gt; answer. He =\r\nis the closest thing we have to a science expert. I wish we\n&gt; had Perceptor=\r\n here.&quot; He paused and added, &quot;I mean the old Perceptor.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Pr=\r\neston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
