Obviously he was the youngest of the adolescents and the most fit for the long journey. Rat Trap gets on, as the others hold their ground around Night Shift.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll be back as fast as I can, and this time I&#39;ll bring backup. Okay big guy, we gotta hussle.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The stegosaurous now heads in the direction upon where Rat Trap and Night Shift originally came from. His feet move quickly as he does his best to get Rat Trap back to the Ark safely.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is Rat Trap Ta Rodimus over, Night Shift&#39;s damages are more serious than I thought, so I&#39;m commn&#39; back ta get help. He&#39;s gonna need some serious repairs and a transport back ta base, over&#39;n out.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere is no response from Rodimus.\n\nAfter a moment Legacy&#39;s cold voice comes over the radio. &quot;Rodimus is\notherwise indisposed.&quot; He said, alluding to the fact that Rodimus is\nhelping to bring Nightlight back from the brink. &quot;However Ramulus was\ndispatched to assist you. He had stopped by to get energon reserved\nbefore he left under Rodimus&#39; orders.&quot;\n\nThere is a slight pause and then Legacy continued, &quot;Ramulus reported\nin a few moments ago that he had arrived at your last reported\nlocation and was going to attempt to locate you. Are you not still\nthere?&quot;\n\nOf course there last reported location was the area of the battle\nbetween the alien insect-like creatures and the minions that looked\nlike insecticons. A place they had fled from being chased by\ninsecticon lady bugs.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
