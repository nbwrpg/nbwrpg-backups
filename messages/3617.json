FAIR \nGAME!&quot; Dark One bellowed aloud, bringing up his targeting computer, firing \nfour seeking missiles at Liono. \n\n---\n\nBreakdown activated his internal computer, getting a fixed, he launched a \npowerful rocket into the sky, descending rapidly down towards Liono.\n\n---\n\nHiss fired four fusion blasts from his cannon, waiting to see the carnage.\n\n---\n\nScavenger swerved in his HUMVEE mode, firing thirty shells at Liono.\n\n---\n\nPyro swerved his cannon, firing an arc of flames at Liono, Dark One flying \naway, followed by all the Oblitercons on the ground, Pyro&#39;s cannon aiming \nbackwards in case.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor fell to his back from Zergling&#39;s shots, firing an optic blast in an \narc at Zergling and Nemesis Enforcer, Nemesis slamming to the ground.  \nSerpentor leapt into the air, running off for the Newcomer&#39;s base.\n\n---\n\nUnitron chuckled.  Seeking missiles, easy to dodge, if you had the expertise. \n Activating flares, four ejected at the missiles (don&#39;t mean to post damage), \nthe missiles blowing up on impact, the force sending Unitron spinning.  \nTransforming to robot mode, he slammed to the ground on his side.  Hearing \nShuko&#39;s orders, he took out his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at \nLiono as he ran.\n\n---\n\nAnubis sidesteps, letting the blast scrape his arm.  Yelling in pain, he \nfired a rocket and two optic blasts off at Tigerhawk, falling back as ordered.\n\n---\n\nHades rolled to the left, the missiles going by, but laser beams twirling him \nas they hit his side.  Falling to one knee, he jumped up to his feet, as he \nran for the Newcomer&#39;s base, he pointed his laser rifle backwards, firing \nseveral rapid bolts at Tigerhawk.\n\n---\n\nSixshot looked around.  &quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re losing to these pathetic \nMaximals.&quot; firing a rocket off from his missile launcher at the Ark, he \ntransformed to his tank mode, firing a blast from the top cannon, and two \nmissiles from embedded missile launchers off at Liono, transforming to space \nfighter mode and launching off into the air.\n\n"}}
