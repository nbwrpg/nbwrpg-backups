One was tall, with beam weapons mounted into his body.  \nHis \n&gt; face was always a perpetual sneer, which cleverly disguised his \nlack \n&gt; of thinking. The other, also tall, was much differant.  He was \nlike a \n&gt; dignitary or stately male.  But his regal appearance hide his \n&gt; incredible indurance, he survived many battles, and thus his \n&gt; judgement was affected.  He regarded his companion with disgust, \nhe \n&gt; was inferior.  Suddenly a fmale voice rang out.\n&gt; &quot;Splattercannon, Necross, you are to proceed to the Maximal base \non \n&gt; the planet.  Unicron&#39;s orders.&quot;\n&gt; The female chuckled from an unseen corridor, as the first male \nwalke \n&gt; to an airlock.\n&gt; &quot;Hold it, you oaf, we need provisions, we need energon!&quot; Necross \nsaid.\n&gt; &quot;Well then let&#39;s get some and go!  Unicron commands!&quot; \nSplattercannon \n&gt; says as he turns an walks down another corridor.  They shortly \ncome \n&gt; upon an energon cache, consume their fill, and then leave for the \n&gt; planet below, intent on fighting this day.\n\n\n"}}
