Elita needed extra protection now and \nNightshift was forced to remain in alt form, seeing that it was the safest \nthing for her.  She looks to Scourge quickly and points in the direction of \nTucson&#39;s heading.\n\n&quot; SCOURGE,  SEND A GROUP OF SWEEPS BEHIND TUCSON!  HE MIGHT GET AMBUSHED \nHIMSELF!  WE GOT ELITA SECURRED!&quot;\n\nNightshift puts his window down to allow Straight Shot inside in the \npassengers seat.\n\n&quot; Your dad isn&#39;t himself and we don&#39;t know why.  But we&#39;ll do our best to \nsave him.... Again.&quot;\n\nNightshift comments.\n\n&quot; Slag he better invest in some serious anti hack&#39;n software after this \ntime.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile Tucson continues the flight and scans the ground.\n\n&quot; Noctorro, are we getting close to the Fuzors location?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD – Straight Shot and Tuscon&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot turns her attentions to Nightshift and remains hidden to \n&gt; &gt; see\n&gt; &gt; what he would do next.  Like him, the sight of Dark Rodimus was enough \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; dim her trust in the real Rodimus Prime as she remembers what had \n&gt; &gt; happened\n&gt; &gt; to him in the past.  She opens a com link to Tucson directly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Tucson, it&#39;s me, look, I think ya might have ta take leadership \n&gt; &gt; privileges\n&gt; &gt; away from Rodimus.  He&#39;s turned evil again.  And I don&#39;t think \n&gt; &gt; Nightshift or\n&gt; &gt; anyone else is gonna trust him after this.  I know I won&#39;t. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson gets her call while holding onto Noctorro, flying him back to \n&gt; &gt; where\n&gt; &gt; the other injured Fuzors are to stand guard until help got to them.  His\n&gt; &gt; eyes narrow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I was afraid of this, Noctorro.  Rodimus has been taken again. \n&gt; &gt; Straight\n&gt; &gt; Shot is right, he can&#39;t be trusted.  And he accuses me of not being in \n&gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; right of mind..  Not good, not good at all.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He continues his flight while carefully tending to his comrade.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD – TALON&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Talon was shocked about the last things that had happened and followed\n&gt; &gt; Tucson in silence\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Keep in mind that while Noctorro about 5-6&#39; tall as oppose to\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s 10&#39; but he is still a significant weight to carry. Tuscon can\n&gt; carry him or let him fly on his own, but caring for him as in trying\n&gt; to bind his injuries or something is not possible while in flight.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Leo Prime, I am flying Noctorro back to the damaged Fuzors and I will\n&gt; &gt; stand guard with them until help arrives.  In the mean time, Rodimus has\n&gt; &gt; fallen back into evil hands and I think it&#39;s best if he is barred from\n&gt; &gt; leadership duties until further notice.  I don&#39;t like being this harsh, \n&gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; right now he can&#39;t be trusted.  Tell Bump to secure Nightlight in the \n&gt; &gt; med\n&gt; &gt; bay and put the Ark in immediate lockdown. We can&#39;t afford to take any\n&gt; &gt; chances.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW – LEO&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Understood.&quot; Was LEO PRIME&#39;s response. Evidently there was more he\n&gt; wanted to say, but he was unable to say it at the moment, perhaps\n&gt; because NIGHTLIGHT was still close by.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD – NIGHTSHIFT&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightshift continues to keep his doors locked and engine in drive for \n&gt; &gt; quick\n&gt; &gt; escape if need be.  He wasn&#39;t about to let Dark Rodimus get to Elita. \n&gt; &gt; If\n&gt; &gt; anything he knew that returning her to the Ark would also put his other\n&gt; &gt; comrades at risk.  That too was out of the question.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I don&#39;t think so, Punk, you ain&#39;t puttn one mean aft hand on anyone if \n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; can help it!  You gotta outrun me first before ya even THINK about \n&gt; &gt; gett&#39;n\n&gt; &gt; your hands on her!   Hold on tight kid, I think we&#39;re in for a little \n&gt; &gt; car\n&gt; &gt; chase.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD – Elita&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What happened to My daddy!!!???&quot;said Elita almost sobbing\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW – DARK RODIMUS&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It is as if DARK RODIMUS could hear ELITA&#39;s cry – his optics\n&gt; brightening, his wicked smile getting ever that much wider as he still\n&gt; looked in her direction as NIGHTSHIFT backed and turned away.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD – HYDRAS&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;So Prime are you leaving us?&quot;hissed hydras&quot;Unlucky, Cyclonus is missing \n&gt; &gt; too\n&gt; &gt; and an old pal is willing to help, and this is over us&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hydras send an encoded message that said &quot;we have to allied to MAximals \n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; order to deal with this, Dark Rodimus is back and not under my control&quot; \n&gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; he send another encoded to Scourge &quot;Keep an eye in the child, in a \n&gt; &gt; driscrete\n&gt; &gt; way&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW – DARK RODIMUS, WASPINATOR, SCOURGE & SWEEPS&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Being that SCOURGE and the sweeps stood between DARK RODIMUS and ELITA\n&gt; DARK RODIMUS made no move to chase her down, although anyone who knows\n&gt; him is well aware of the fact that there are few faster than he across\n&gt; the open ground, except perhaps BLURR.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I read you.&quot; SCOURGE sent back to HYDRAS. &quot;We have Dark Rodimus about\n&gt; surrounded. Shall we bring him in? The child is escaping with\n&gt; Nightshift. They should be coming back towards you.&quot; There was a pause\n&gt; before SCOURGE asked the real and important question, &quot;Where is\n&gt; Cyclonus, wasn&#39;t he with Rodimus?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile HYDRAS also got a call back from CRYOTEK, &quot;What do you mean\n&gt; working with the Maximals? What&#39;s going on?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: I will be moving Tuscon and whomever is with him to a new thread\n&gt; soon as they have seperated from the main group.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
