I will. I am Predacon, it is only fitting. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; She looked at Quickstrike. After wondering about his unconscious mind, she found out that he was the one with the blank mind. His eyes were still open, but nothing was going on inside. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Where did you find him? she asked. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
