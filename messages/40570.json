This is \nan \n&gt; RPG board, not a general discussion board. If you want to discus \n&gt; something, do it over private email or on the message board on the \n&gt; site.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know about other people, but I am sick as hell of the \n&gt; completely pointless OOCs on the RPG board. Lurker, you&#39;re a great \n&gt; RPer. Now shut up and take the compliment. Dewey, this is a BW RPG. \n&gt; The moment I see a char with even a variation of &quot;Goku&quot; as his \nname, \n&gt; you&#39;ll regret it. In adition, stop moding. You can&#39;t make other \n&gt; people&#39;s chars do things, you never posted for Mustex even \nattempting \n&gt; to get on Alliance Island, much less getting on it, you have no \npart \n&gt; in the past of NBW, and can&#39;t change it at will. Your chars have no \n&gt; logical way of knowing about Zardus or Veratis, and its moding to \n&gt; have them have that insight. Either explain how they know or drop \n&gt; that storyline. It makes no sence. Also, you never even landed that \n&gt; lowlife seller or whatever of yours on the planet, and I&#39;m not \ngoing \n&gt; to write your profiles for you. Shape up. Read the rules and act by \n&gt; them. LegendaryNemasis, please stop commenting on every post. The \n&gt; council will catch it if its moding.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Everyone else: stop the OOCs. Either write RPG posts, or don&#39;t \npost \n&gt; at all. I&#39;m very sick of coming home from work and reading through \n&gt; 100 or so damn OOC posts. I&#39;m about ready to moderate anyone who \n&gt; sends an OOC ever again. I won&#39;t, but keep in mind that I&#39;m on the \n&gt; verge of turning into a very mean person.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From now on, use private email for pointless OOCs, or use the \n&gt; site&#39;s message board. DO NOT clog up space on this board. I&#39;m sick \nof \n&gt; it, as I said like 10 times already in this post.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There. I&#39;m through with my ranting. I really hope the OOC \nmessages \n&gt; stop. Its very hard for me to keep up with posts as it is, and all \n&gt; this pointless crap is starting to convince me not to even bother.\n\n\n"}}
