I want to make one clone. Just one. And with a \nlittle luck, I will make it perfect.&quot; She smiled. &quot;I had the idea of \nfighting fire with fire. Megatron made a clone of himself. So I want \nto make a clone. One of Megatron. I figure if I work things right, I \ncan send my clone of Megatron into his base, once we find it that is, \nand hopefully kill the real Megatron. Then take control of his \ngroup.  With him out of the way, we can start to consolidate the \nPredacons.  Make one huge Predacon force, then take over the \nmaximals. WE could win the war if all the Predacons united and fought \nas one team, one unit, one group.&quot;  She then started staring at her \nglass again.  &quot;We can&#39;t win a battle let alone the war if we are \nalways fighing amonst ourselves.  That&#39;s how the Maximals have \nsurvived this long.  They all stick together.  Predacons as a whole \nout number the Maximals, but untill we stop fighting amonst ourselves \nand act as one big group, we will never put an end to the war.&quot;  she \ntook a deep sigh,&quot;I don&#39;t care if I lead them to victory or not.  If \nthere is another bot that is a better leader, then so be it. but we \nmust unite to win.  All the preds. That is why I want that replicator \nto work. I first need to get rid of Megatron.  And I was hoping to \nuse his own clone against him.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Destructor walked into the mess hall and sat down with Kit Kat.
