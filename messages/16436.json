When Ignatius \n&gt; flew down low, Prebon lifted Spears off his back.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You were wondeful! I can&#39;t believe how good you are!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Hammer arrvied at K9&#39;s position.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There is no way you are following us, Maximal! DIE!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hammer opened a panel on his arm, and pulled out a grenade. He \n&gt; pressed the button and laucnhed it. He got his plasma rifle ready \n&gt; just incase this bot survived the blast.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois stepped in front of Child.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hold on Child. You have just learned this power. Too much use \nbefore \n&gt; training could cause an overload, killing yourself in the process.&quot;\n&gt; Vulois than went into a fighting stance an looked at AngelNemesis.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I, on the other hand, have been training my power for months, and \n&gt; know my limitations. Now Nemesis, watch the power of good triumph \n&gt; over evil!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vuloic concentrated, and formed an energy sword in his hand.

You can count on us.&quot; He than turned to the rest of the \n&gt; group. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All right guys. Let&#39;s give Ramulus room to think. Let&#39;s install \nthe \n&gt; new computer boards so we can maybe get this thing up and running.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix and Fliq picked up Computer boards and carried them inside.\n\n\n"}}
