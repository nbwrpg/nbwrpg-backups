The bonus of having so\n&gt; many together would mean they were distracted by one naother&#39;s presence, and\n&gt; not paying attention to her own. Ironically, the immediate arrival of the\n&gt; others would be her best asset of avoiding the patrols then as they were\n&gt; chatty and expressing their suspicions to one another.\n&gt;\n&gt; With luck, as she went to crawl along the ceiling, by the time they had\n&gt; finished thier discussion she would be long gone.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWith her cloaking field completely in place BLACKARACHNIA was able to\nwalk completely passed the two &#39;guards&#39; WOLFGANG and NIGHSHIFT who\nwere currently in conversation with each other.\n\nThe ARK seemed to be totally open.\n\nAlthough she would probably know that dropping her guard for even a\nmoment would mean instant detection! Probing sensor sweeps were moving\nover BLACKARACHNIA. It would seem that the MAXIMALS have had quite a\nfew break in in the recent past and were not taking any chances.\n\nA Single misstep would set off alarms!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
