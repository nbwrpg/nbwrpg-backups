If \nshe were\n&gt; to open her mouth and shriek right now the Alliance would be \nlooking for a\n&gt; new leader. Unfortunately that also meant that Veratis would be \nlooking for\n&gt; a new daughter.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What exactly is it you&#39;d like to know?&quot; she asked knowing he heald \nall the\n&gt; cards.
