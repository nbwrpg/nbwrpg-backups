I know you want this plot to work, but It just \ncan&#39;t. It&#39;s just like saying Mustex knows about Veratis when they have \nnot actually met in the RPG. The basic story of a rebelling faction \nsending a member to Earth was good, but you can not say \nTechno-organics were on cybertron because it is not the Cybertron that \nhas been going on. Beast Machines never happened. This means that the \nMaximals safely arrived on Cybertron, took Megatron to a trial or \nsomething, and, in some way, he went back to Earth. That&#39;s it. BM \nnever happened because if it did, Megatron never could have had went \nback to Earth, he would have been a part of Cybertron. It&#39;s hard, but \nyou&#39;ll have to deal with it.\n\n\n"}}
