The maximals could use the surviving \ntechnology for the Ark.\n\nLunarpine touched a piece of the protoform, &quot;Rest easy warrior, may \nyour next function end better than this.&quot; Not much of a eulogy but it \nhad to do.\n\nHe reached into the pod and removed what he&#39;d hoped was the memory \nand scanner array. If it still worked it might still have it&#39;s uses.\n\nBut Lunarpine had to be moving on, he still had a strong scent and \nwas determined to learn where it led.\n\n \n\n\n"}}
