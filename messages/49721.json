It has a slight\n&gt; &gt; white/gray tint to it \n&gt; &gt; with black windows.  It slowly moves towards the\n&gt; &gt; third planet from \n&gt; &gt; the sun.  The planet is mostly Blue with a couple\n&gt; &gt; masses of green.  \n&gt; &gt; The ship starts to shake as it enters the\n&gt; &gt; atmosphere.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Inside the ship sits one bot behind the controls\n&gt; &gt; of the ship.  The \n&gt; &gt; bot can not be reconized because there is a shadow\n&gt; &gt; over him.  The \n&gt; &gt; shaking get even worse as the bot&#39;s right arm\n&gt; &gt; quickly reaches over to \n&gt; &gt; the right as his yellow with black dotted arm flicks\n&gt; &gt; a switch.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    The ship doesn&#39;t stop shaking as it gets closer\n&gt; &gt; and closer to \n&gt; &gt; earth.  All of a sudden the engine blows as flames\n&gt; &gt; are thrown from \n&gt; &gt; the back of the ship.  The bot in the inside of the\n&gt; &gt; ship starts to \n&gt; &gt; punch the button he just touched.  A firey streak\n&gt; &gt; can be seen in the \n&gt; &gt; sky as the ship crash lands About 155 miles south of\n&gt; &gt; the maximal base.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Sorry if it sucks first post in the past may\n&gt; &gt; months also with no \n&gt; &gt; created jucies flowing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Sign up for SBC Yahoo!
