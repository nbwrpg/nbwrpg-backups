The sun was a few\n&gt; hours from setting and Scorponok hadn&#39;t returned from the old Predacin\nbase.\n&gt;\n&gt; She hailed Quickstrike on his commlink.\n&gt; &quot;Hey, Quickstrike,  this is DarkMouse.  Have you seen Scorponok lately? He\n&gt; has been gone hours and not returned form the old Pred base yet.  I wonder\n&gt; if he is hurt or ran into one of the unfriendly&#39;s.  If you see him, tell\nhim\n&gt; I need his help on some of the computer systems will ya.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She waited for Quickstrike to respond.  She stood at the main enterance to\n&gt; the cave.  The wind was just barely blowing and the sky was starting to\n&gt; darken in the east.  She hoped that the others would return to the cave\n&gt; before dark so she could arm the auto-defence systems.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Turn your EGROUP into a GROUP BUYING GROUP!
