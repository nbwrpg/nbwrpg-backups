She didn&#39;t have anything to do, so she wondered if she could help Plintissa build her Base? She wouldn&#39;t join her group, she would just help. If felt good to help others.\n\nOn impulse, she looked back to the spot that the bot had been hiding in. She narrows her eyes.. there was a big thing of blue! She turns back and ignores it.\n\n&quot;Plintissa, can I help you build your Base? It&#39;d be fun!&quot; *She grins*\n\n------Original Message------\nFrom: &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: May 18, 2000 10:07:06 PM GMT\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nPlintissa shook her head.... &quot;i brought some in my ship, but that bot\nSinesis destroyed my ship....my suppies were kept intact, however.....&quot; she\nsaid...she walked back and forth from her ship to the structure and built\nonto it each time....\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
