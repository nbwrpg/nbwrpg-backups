Remember in the Beast War times, \nthe \n&gt; &gt;Maximals and Predacons are the dominent factions. Any Autobots or \n&gt; &gt;Decepticons still around would surely be apart of those factions, \n&gt; &gt;Especially ones that are in military service.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at \nhttp://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\n\n\n"}}
