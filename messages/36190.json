He sensed a\n&gt; shadow hovering over him. &quot;Oh SH...&quot; his thoughts were cut off by a fist\n&gt; slamming down on his head forcing him to the ground. (This might be moding\n&gt; but I think you&#39;ll like it.) The bums fist continued downward striking the\n&gt; ground, Dogged still between the fist and the pavement. When the fist raised\n&gt; Doggeds crushed body lay with only it&#39;s feet fully intact and hanging out of\n&gt; the hole. Sparks flashed from the rest of it as all motor functions ceased.\n\n\n"}}
