He transformed to his \nsturdy looking robot mode and looked around. The air was clear and \nfresh. This was a virgin planet, untouched by the ravages of \ncivilization... yet. The Cybertronians posed a great threat to that. \nIt had to be dealt with.\n\nThat would be Lunekill&#39;s job. For now, he wanted to examine the \nEnergon&#39;s quality. He lifted his fist in the air and took his \nmomentum. He punched through the rocks and straight into a deposit. \nThen, he grasped a big chunk of crystaline energon and took it out. \nAppraising it like a jewel-crafter looking at a finely cut diamond, \nhe lifted it to his mouth and engulfed it whole.\n\nThe reaction was instantaneous and astonishing. It coursed through \nhim as a power surge, making him feel like a powerhouse. Oh, did he \nlove this sensation of power! It was the first time he had ever \nexperienced something as strong as this! It did not stop here, \nthough, as he would have expected. The surge built in him until he \ncould no longer hold it back, then, with a crackling of static \nelectricity, he literally blew the top of the mountain off. He could \nno longer control his power surge! His feelings were amplified \ntenfolds. He was enraged!\n\nNo use for Lunekill, the Cybertronians would have to die now!\n\nHe flew away and, sensing a group of Predacons, stopped. He lifted a \ndouble pulse gun and fired, again and again.\n\nRockseeker: Die, you oversized crawlers!\n\n\n"}}
