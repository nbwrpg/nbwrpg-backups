He\nwasn&#39;t sure what it was, maybe it was his high sounding talk, maybe it\nwas his tenacity, maybe it was his . . . .\n\n*SLAM!*\n\nRodimus was jolted out of his revelry by the doors slamming shut,\ncutting him off from the torture chamber. Inside he could hear\nthreatening tones coming from Scorponok and Darkhawk, and the sound of\na vehicle&#39;s engine revving.\n\nRodimus&#39; attention was diverted from further listening as a message\ncame over his comms, a text message from Perceptor.\n\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus... Go to this sector and watch out that our enemies doesnt go inside&quot; typed Perceptor fast and send the secret message &quot;They mustnt get her... Do what ever you have to to stop them&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes!&quot; Rodimus jumped as he could see the urgency with the speed that\nPerceptor was typing the message. &quot;On my way!&quot; he sent back as he\nreceived the location from Perceptor.\n\nRodimus was surprised, as the location was only a short distance away.\nWith a thought he quickly shifted into his vehicle, gunned his motor\nand moved swiftly. He figured the &#39;her&#39; that Perceptor was referring\nto was Nightlight. Nightlight was Rodimus&#39; wife, he would not let\nthose idiot Maximals get their hands on her!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Dark Rodimus)\n\n"}}
