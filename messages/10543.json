He just didn&#39;t \nshare it with us proir to the battle.  I&#39;m sure it would have worked, \nhad things not gone the way they did.&quot;  She knew that was a flat out \nlie.  She should have seen it comming that Megatron sent them out \nthere for revenge.  The other group turned him down and he wanted to \nshow them that he was the true leader. It turned out he wasn&#39;t.  he \nthought with anger and malicve, not with the cunning of  a true pred \nleader.  \n\nShe turned to Phobia. &quot;Megatron knew what he was doing, well, sort \nof.&quot; She looked at the ground then shook her head.\n&quot;I don&#39;t want to think anout this now. I have to go out and hunt. \nI&#39;ll see you later on Phobia. OK?&quot; With that, she walked off. She \ntransformed into wolf and went out into the forest.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Phobia watched the interaction between KitKat and company.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You&#39;ve done nice work&quot; he said, observing her arm, &quot;Of course none \n&gt; of this would have happened if Megatron wouldn&#39;t have led us into \n&gt; battle without a strategy.&quot; \n&gt; He carefully choosed his words.He didn&#39;t want to sound overly \n&gt; treasoness, but if someone else came up with the idea he wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; disagree.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
