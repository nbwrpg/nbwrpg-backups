Watching the explosion in the air instead of at her feet.\n&gt; Her sword arem relaxing until the tip of the blade came to rest on \nthe \n&gt; ground, her eyes still on the sky.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; I&#39;m fine.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She answered, still looking towards the retreating Shadow as he \nmoved on.\n&gt; So much for testing her body out. There was still so much she didn&#39;t \nknow \n&gt; about it.\n&gt; Iron Raptor lowered her head from the clouds and turned it towards \nProwl as \n&gt; he walked up to her, simply looking at him through the slits of her \nvisor on \n&gt; her helm, seeing Firearm pull up and then transform.\n&gt; Did he even recognize her? Probably.\n&gt; Iron Raptor gave Firearm an absentminded wave before turning her \nattentions \n&gt; back towrds Prowl.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Why did Kluster call a meeting, is it because of the threat from \nthe \n&gt; Predacons of attack?&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She was ready to go, yes.
