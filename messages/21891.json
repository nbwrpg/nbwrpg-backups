He remained still, waiting to see what Ice did next.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine saw the break in the action and took advantage. He \n&gt; transformed to his half wolf stage and dashed into the battle. \n&gt; Foxfingers rolled out and began scampering toward Lunarpine. \n&gt; Lunarpine grabbed the fox and pulled him to safety.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis watched as the stalemate continued. The virus seemed to \nhave \n&gt; given Razor Claw extra abilities too. He catalogued each movement \nand \n&gt; each technique. Both were changed thanks to him, and both were \ndeadly.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
