Red like the landscape it flew from, it rose into \nthe air. Th=\r\nen with a smooth twist of hue it turned black as the \nshadows of space enve=\r\nloped it. Like some black fog hunter-\nterminators, or sweeps as some call t=\r\nhem, along with their leader \nScourge, gathered themselves under the direct=\r\nion of the mighty \nCyclonus. Then with lightening swiftness boosters flared=\r\n turning the \nsurface of the moon crimson for the briefest of moments befor=\r\ne they \nstruck out across open space, moving with precision and ease toward=\r\n \nthe unsuspecting inhabitants of the earth. \n\n\n\nInside the pacifist Maxima=\r\nl base in Atlantis the computers continued \nto monitor the grounds, primari=\r\nly attempting to keep track of the \nfleeing Trelos. But as always a few con=\r\nes were pointed skyward, \nalways on the look out for Minions. What they saw=\r\n today the computers \nhad no way to understand. Something that was there an=\r\nd yet not there. \nThe slightest bit of distortion, that under normal circum=\r\nstances \nwould have been ignored, but in this case was large, and worse yet=\r\n, \nit was moving. (OOC: Think of Predator&#39;s invisibility when he moved) \n\nA=\r\n yellow warning light began to go off in the pacifist command \ncenter, as t=\r\nhe computer screen automatically projected course and \nheading. Approximate=\r\nd heading: Atlantis. Unfortunately no one was \nthere to notice.\n\n \n\nOn the =\r\ngrounds of Atlantis the pursuit of Trelos continues as several \nMaximals at=\r\ntempt to retrieve the rather elusive Predacon from his \nnewest hiding spot,=\r\n underwater. One boat is on the water obviously \nsearching, while a floatin=\r\ng car hovers over the waters doing its own \nsearch. Meanwhile Rodimus has n=\r\noted a rather odd dot in the skies, \none that he can see to be a Predacon e=\r\nagle. He is pointing at it. And \neven as he is doing this he notes somethin=\r\ng strange coming from \nbehind the eagle. The sky for a moment seems to flas=\r\nh and ripple, \nalmost like lightning, and yet there is a slight rotation to=\r\n the \nflashes. \n\n\n\nIn the skies above the eagle looks down noting Rodimus p=\r\nointing at \nhim, and he begins to drop out of the skies moving out over ope=\r\nn \nwater, preparing either to flee, or do a strafing run. In either case \nh=\r\ne is totally unaware of what is transpiring over his head.\n\n\n\nOn the ground=\r\ns below Rodimus can see what is coming as his enhanced \nvision sees two ver=\r\ny tiny dots spiraling out from the rippling \nflashes. At the same time Klax=\r\nons begin to go off as base computers \ndo actually recognize this threat: M=\r\nISSILES!\n\n\n\nErupting out of the skies, twin missiles streak across the skie=\r\ns, \nvortexes of flames spiraling after them like crimson, cone shaped \ncont=\r\nrails. They slam into communication towers, and the towers as \nwell as a fe=\r\nw outlying buildings burst into flames. \n\nIn the background, almost unnotic=\r\ned, a Myrmidon spirals out of the \nskies, the recipient of several laser bl=\r\nasts. Small gouts of flames \nflowing from him even as he impacts the water.=\r\n Myrmidon sinks beneath \nthe waves.\n\nAnd flying from amidst this bombardmen=\r\nt Cyclonus rises high into the \nair.\n\n&quot;The days you have known are over. Al=\r\nl that you have belongs to us! \nResist and be destroyed!! THE MINIONS OF UN=\r\nICRON HAVE COME!&quot;\n\nEven Cyclonus spoke sweeps arrive seeming to almost dark=\r\nen the skies \nfor a momsnt, disintegrator blasts providing bright flashes o=\r\nf light \nas they bath Atlantis and the Maximal base in war.\n\n\n\n- - - - - - =\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nOOC: I am sure other Maximal and Preda=\r\ncon bases/HQ&#39;s will note \nsomething similar to what the Maximal base in Atl=\r\nantis noted, feel \nfree for anyone to jump in, if it makes sense. \n\nThe onl=\r\ny thing of note is that the Sweeps and Scourge cannot be \nlocked on to with=\r\n sensors (check out their profiles on wiki). That \nshould not affect most o=\r\nf you very much, since most of you shoot by \nsight anyways, unless you are =\r\nusing base sensors or some remote \nsensing capability. \n\nAlso any Minions t=\r\nhat chose to come with are in this group as well.\n\n\n\n"}}
