And amazing characterization=\r\n going on so far for Tuscon Sandy, interested in seeing more of him now!\n\nA=\r\nlso for some reason my post for earlier was delayed over until today that I=\r\n did last night.\n\n&lt;IC&gt;\n\nWheelie glanced over at Tuscon, then over at Rattra=\r\np and Straight SHot.\n\nThen, turning over to the two, he said quite simply, =\r\nwithout rhyming, &quot;Sorry then.&quot;  With that, as LEO PRIME gestured voer to hi=\r\nm to leave, he crossed his arms and then went to walk out, glancing over at=\r\n Tuscon, and at that point, seeing the anger he had instigated in the other=\r\n PRime, he then quietly mouthed the same thing, and left.\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;We are talking about nighlgiht , sir&quot; replied  Windlord\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nLEO shook his head as he looked over at WINDLORD, &quot;No, you are talking\n&gt; ab=\r\nout Nightlight but I believe that Tuscon is talking about Elita.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He p=\r\naused meaningfully, &quot;You said she is too young and Tuscon said you\n&gt; were r=\r\night but let&#39;s hear what she has to say and that if she wishes\n&gt; to be a pa=\r\nrt of the plan then we should respect that, no matter how\n&gt; strange it may =\r\nseem.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME turned to TUSCON to get confirmation when TUSCON just=\r\n lost it!\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone paying attention to LEO could see him bristle, the li=\r\non part of\n&gt; him starting to come to the fore. He looked as if he were abou=\r\nt to say\n&gt; something when WING CALIBER placed a hand lightly on his shoulde=\r\nr and\n&gt; directed his attention to WHEELIE who by this time had slid past RA=\r\nT\n&gt; TRAP and STRAIGHT SHOT.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; And not drawing a weapon, &quot;If you two th=\r\nink that is worth an &#39;oops&#39; I&#39;d hate\n&gt; &gt; to see you take things out of your=\r\n caboose.  If that&#39;s the best that you two\n&gt; &gt; can do, I&#39;ll say I&#39;m sorry t=\r\no the two of you.  Since you both can&#39;t do that,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll say it&#39;s not wort=\r\nh being a brat.  If you two can barely work so well,\n&gt; &gt; then I&#39;d hate to s=\r\nee you in a shell.  No offense, but if you can&#39;t do that,\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s not wort=\r\nh trying to hit you up for chat.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Leaning back against the wall, th=\r\nen turning his attention back to LEO PRIME,\n&gt; &gt; and crossing his arms over =\r\nas the discussion turned back to RODIMUS.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO looked back from WHE=\r\nELIE to TUSCON, visably brining his own anger\n&gt; into check. &quot;Clear the room=\r\n.&quot; LEO PRIME said to the others. He glanced\n&gt; at WING CALIBER, &quot;And keep an=\r\n optic on RAT TRAP, STRAIGHT SHOT and\n&gt; WHEELIE, I will need to talk with t=\r\nhem as well.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; WING CALIBER nodded as he gestured for the others to lea=\r\nve the room as\n&gt; LORD ELDER left pursing his lips thoughtfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; There =\r\nwas a brief glance from LEGACY and SANTON from the other room.\n&gt; They were =\r\ncompletely isolated from what was goin on in this room, but\n&gt; TUSCON&#39;s outb=\r\nurst clearly had been heard in there. They quickly went\n&gt; back to work tryi=\r\nng to save SILVERBOLT&#39;s life.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME just looked at TUSCON as he wa=\r\nited for the room to clear his\n&gt; arms hanging loosely at his sides. His opt=\r\nics on the Maximal Prime who\n&gt; was clearly becoming more unstable as time p=\r\nrogressed, the concern for\n&gt; a brother Maximal prime was warring with the a=\r\nnger he had burning in\n&gt; his spark, and it was written all over his facepla=\r\nte.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
