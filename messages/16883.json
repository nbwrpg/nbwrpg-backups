She hugged herself \nwhile \n&gt; sitting in the corner.  She wondered why she even gave a care about \n&gt; Striker.  But she knew that he was gone forever.  She remembered \n&gt; talking to Prebon and giving herself up for Striker&#39;s release \nwithout \n&gt; a chip.  She then felt a surge as the chip on her straightened out \n&gt; her programs again.  She stopped crying and wiped her face with her \n&gt; hands.  She slowly got up to her feet and walked over the door way \n&gt; and watched Prebon and Slayer. She smiled and knew that is was now \n&gt; her place to serve Prebon and to make him happy.\n&gt; \n&gt; She walked down and went to Prebon.  She smiled and nodded to \nSlayer.\n&gt; &quot;Is there anything that I can do to help Master Prebon?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
