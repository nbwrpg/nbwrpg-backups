He was \nbored. Whilehe thought of going out and go exploring around the Predacon \nterritory, he heard gun shots. He jerked his head up and stood up. He \nlistened, then walked to the mouth of the cave. He saw Terrorsaur flying \nlow, looking like he was ready to come back in.\n\n&quot;Ah heard some shots!&quot; he said to him. &quot;Go find out what it was.&quot;\n\nTerrorsaur grumbled to himself and flew out, turning his course. He picked \nup two signatures on his scanners, one was Predacon. Megatron&#39;s Predacon.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
