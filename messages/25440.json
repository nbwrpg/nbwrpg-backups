He \nwas slowly getting used to talking to bots nearly half his size. \nDiamond, the first bot he had met on this planet, had been about as \ntall as Scorponok, half as tall as Killfest himself. And yet, he \nreminded himself drily, she assassinated KitKat, the Predacon leader, \nand cast the Predacons into civil war. Small bots could have large \nimpacts.\n\n&quot;Hmm. Yes, if we want to take that base, we will need to scout with \nonly one bot. Losing one bot is preffereble to losing twenty.&quot;\n\nHe looks at Darkfate. &quot;Scorponok seems to be willing. Do you have any \nproblem with him going?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Then I&#39;ll do It&quot; Scorponok blurts out, trying to prove \nhimself. &quot;That is,\n&gt; if Darkfate approves.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
