My shame is to great.  This ensignia \nis only a symbol of what I was, and what I hope to be again someday.  \nIt is all I have for Iam now nothing.  But I suppose I could be a \nMaximal if it could get me off the planet.  Where are we again?\n\nOOC: If Panthos knows this is Earth it&#39;ll be a big turn around.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; He fires the plasma rifle 8 times in the general direction of \nPanthos \n&gt; (general direction to compensat for where he thinks he&#39;ll probably \n&gt; dodge to,l but close enough to pose a serious risk if he stands \n&gt; still).\n&gt; \n&gt; {Panthos}\n&gt; \n&gt;     The panther almost smiled his movements agile as he dodged about \nhalf the shots, accepting the remaining four on his flank. His mocking \nchuckle as he took his seat once more shifting himself a bit to ignore \nthe scorch marks on his beast forms rump.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Yes I imagine you do have quite a bit to atone for. Attacking \nfirst against an opponent who hasn&#39;t even drawn a weapon yet.&quot; His \nchuckle became louder, &quot;Mayhaps you best shed this silly notion of \natoning yourself for having to kill your kin. You&#39;re no more maximal \nthan I am.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Now put away that weapon. In your current frame of mind you&#39;re \nlucky you could hit the broad side of cybertron. Now that I&#39;m prepared \nfor your tantrums you&#39;ll be just wasting energy attempting to hit me.&quot; \nHis eyes locked on Turtails and gave an almost feline shrug. &quot;Think \nabout it. If I wanted to scrap you I&#39;d have done it while you were in \nyour self absorbed ranting.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Besides I know where a base belonging to your faction is \nlocated in these parts already. If you&#39;re sure you want to go ahead \nand kill your brother for making a choice, I&#39;m sure they might provide \nyou with assistance. And rather than scan for it yourself I can guide \nyou. A deal you might say, information in exchange for spending my \nfirst day on this dirt ball without someone continually scorching my \nhide. Agreeable?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     The panther waited watching the maximal cautiously ready to \nspring out of the way.\n\n\n"}}
