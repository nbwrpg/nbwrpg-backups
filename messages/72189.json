He nodded as WHEELIE stepped foward. &quot;Greeings.&quot; he sa=\r\nid,\n&gt; his voice deep and powerful.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWheelie had met so many &#39;deep=\r\n and powerful and ancient mysterious&#39; types as he went on in that he checke=\r\nd another one off his mental list.  &quot;Greetings and hey there.  HOw does it =\r\nfeel to be square?&quot;\n\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a regal nod from UNUS, &quot;ahh, y=\r\nou are like the other.&quot; he\n&gt; said peering at WHEELIE&#39;s Autobot brand. &quot;He t=\r\nold me that others might\n&gt; come, but he described a different sort of symbo=\r\nl.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS gestured towards WHEELIE, &quot;You must be tired after your trave=\r\nls,\n&gt; sit, sit.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A chair was brought for WHEELIE as ASTRA and FIREHORN=\r\n moved to stand\n&gt; nearer UNUS moving ao a position of attention and then &#39;a=\r\nt-ease&#39;, the\n&gt; but of their axes resting comfortably on the ground, held ca=\r\nlmly in\n&gt; the left hands, they stood like soldiers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You have many que=\r\nstions.&quot; UNUS said with a smile, &quot;But I don&#39;t think\n&gt; my answers will help =\r\nyou much.&quot; He seated himself back in his seat,\n&gt; even this movement somehow=\r\n regal and dignified. &quot;Perhaps the what we\n&gt; are is a little easier. We are=\r\n the Cornu.&quot; As he said this he gestured\n&gt; to the other figures that stood =\r\naround the room.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He peered closely at WHEELIE again, &quot;From what we ha=\r\nve learned we are\n&gt; not much different then you I would think. Our structur=\r\ne seems to be\n&gt; largely the same, although we turn into animals while seem =\r\nto turn\n&gt; into a strange wheeled vehicle.&quot; There was a dismissive gesture, =\r\n&quot;But\n&gt; I think underneath we all about the same.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS paused, &quot;Now as=\r\n to where we came from, now that is a little more\n&gt; involved.&quot; he smiled ag=\r\nain as if realizing something, &quot;You could think\n&gt; of us as experiments, as =\r\nRattlings that have escaped their cages.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a general chuckle =\r\naround the room, most of them seemingly\n&gt; aware of what he meant.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We =\r\nhave forged ourselves a home and we live nestled in the very\n&gt; shadow of ou=\r\nr ex-creators.&quot; There was small smile from UNUS, one of\n&gt; pride and humor.\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWheelie glanced, listening, &quot;Well, then tell me what you do, if=\r\n you can say who made you too?&quot;  Listening softly, &quot;Who made you all the wa=\r\ny out here?  Without anyone else knowing the cheer?&quot;\n\nThis sounded very pec=\r\nuliar to him, as he knew that even with the Maximals focused on the Predaco=\r\nns, they were hardly going to have missed a large facility wtih a large gro=\r\nuping of units within it.\n\nMuch less where all of thier equipment and weapo=\r\nns had come from. W hile Wheelie had seen many &#39;escaped and abandoned&#39; colo=\r\nnies, they were not remotely as well equipped as this place was.\n\nFeeling a=\r\n bit worried, &quot;Can you tell me who it was, that said this thing because?&quot;  =\r\nPoitning at the symbol, &quot;What was his name, and where from did he came?&quot;  W=\r\nalking along then, not sitting, &quot;And thank you, but I must know..  Where wa=\r\ns he from, where did he go?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
