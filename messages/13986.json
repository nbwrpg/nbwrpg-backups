He \ncan&#39;t tell if he&#39;s dead or not. But even if he isn&#39;t dead, that bot \nwill never be the same. It&#39;s time to get some rest and make scars.\n\nSavage uses the rest of it&#39;s power to start flying towards it&#39;s cave.\n______________________________________________________________________\nZava\n\nZava catches up with The Chosne Ones. She nearly screams.\n\n&quot;Oh My God! It&#39;s the Chosen Ones!&quot;\n\nZava runs up and hugs Deemos. Than she explains herself.\n\n&quot;Deemos!

Please, let me \njoin you!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron arrives at The Alliance Base, watching two bots enter it.
