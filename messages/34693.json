He glanced from \n&gt; the top of his building to a &#39;chosen bot&#39;. &quot;He could&#39;ve fought my \n&gt; suspension...he could&#39;ve....&quot; he roared out blasting a missile a \n&gt; couple miles dead onto a target he made.  He looked back down to \nthe \n&gt; chosen bot, JetV, and how he was sad for having to go.  He wanted \nto \n&gt; cry out take me instead of this panzy.  But he kept his cool, this \n&gt; time.  He got up and begane to stroll. A walk down memory lane of \nhis \n&gt; friendship with Pacifix.\n&gt; &quot;NO!&quot; he cried.\n&gt; &quot;He will not leave without me&quot; he said to himself and began his way \n&gt; towards the docking bays of the Autobot&#39;s base on Cybertron\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::JetV::\n&gt; &gt; JetV got the news of his recruitment to Pacifix team.  He was \nhappy \n&gt; &gt; at first...but then learned of the danger.  He just rode around \n&gt; &gt; through the lanes on Cybertron roaming looking for an answer. He \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; always been a coward. Which is why when he was recruited to the \n&gt; &gt; Autobots took a scout job. &#39;Stay out of the way of trouble...and \nit \n&gt; &gt; will stay out of the way of me&#39; he would say to himself.  How the \n&gt; &gt; fickle evil called fate plays it&#39;s cards on the unwanting.  As he \n&gt; &gt; roamed the streets of a war torn sector he noticed the damage \nleft \n&gt; &gt; behind. Bots offline....no place left for them but the Matrix. \nAnd \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; he came upon a young bot...like himself only lees spark if none \nat \n&gt; &gt; all he had is answer to his dillema. He would go on this journey. \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; horror that the Decipticons deal on Cybertron shall not be \nallowed \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; transpire on another planet.  He stood starring at the young bot \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; wheeled around and took off heading for the housings of Pacifix.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- Autobots / Pacifix / Crossroads ---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; An interesting Decepticon transmission was captured by an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Autobot spy. When decoded, the Autobots discovered that the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Decepticons had spread out, and were trying to dominate other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; regions, and upset the fragile balance of power. The \nDecepticons \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had gone to a planet, Earth. (the coordinates were in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; transmision) The Autobot Council was troubled. They needed to \ndo \n&gt; &gt; &gt; something. The sole proposition to the council came from a \nyoung \n&gt; &gt; &gt; courageous leader; Pacifix. He suggested that they Autobots \nsend \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a secret mission to the planet and even the odds, without \ntelling \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Decepticons what was going on. That way no power struggles \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would ensue. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Autobot Council, after several long weeks of indecision, \ncame \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to an agreement. The would send Pacifix as the group commander, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and allow him to choose several bots that he feels are suited \nfor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the task. Pacifix took the task solemly and began to pick bots \nhe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; felt were worth. He chose Jazz as his second in command, he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chose Metalwarhawk, Bumblebee, Crossroads a strategist, JetV a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; scout. He was forced to leave his best friend, Crotale, behind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pacifix rose from his partial slumber and yawns. &quot;Hello world.&quot; \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; looks solemly out the window, a world that he wouldn&#39;t see in a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; couple of Cybertronian days. A world that he would regret \nhaving \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; leave, but the adventure! He had made sure the day before that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Crotale knew that he was leaving, but he was surprised that he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hadn&#39;t recieved a message yet. He conacted Crossroads and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; asked him to drop off another message for Crotale, &quot;Crossroads, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would you please drop off another message for my friend, \nCrotale?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Crossroads, who was streaming down the Cybertron Freeway at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the time, gets Pacifix&#39;s, his new boss, message. &quot;Righto boss, \n&gt; I&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have the message at his door in a sec.&quot; Crossroads downloads \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; message and heads on towards Crotale&#39;s last location. He inputs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the message into the message machine, as soon as he finds out \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that Crotale&#39;s still missing. His engins roars to life, and he \n&gt; &gt; tears off, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opening a commlink to Pacifix and relaying the news.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pacifix curses. &quot;Ok thanks Crossroads, make sure to be back at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the spaceship in two days, after today, that&#39;s when we leave.&quot; \nHe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; leaves his quarters, and transforms when he gets to the exit. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has a important meeting with the Autobot Council about what he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; might have to be prepared for.\n\n\n"}}
