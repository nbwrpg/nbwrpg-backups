He then added his own password \nto the\n&gt; door t=\r\no Lady Spire&#39;s quarters so that he and Kratos could enter \nwhenever\n&gt; they =\r\npleased.  As he logged out of the computer, he made sure to \nput things\n&gt; b=\r\nack as they were so that no one would know that he had changed \nanything.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;I think that I&#39;m done, I added a new code number to the door to \nher\n&gt;=\r\n quarters.
