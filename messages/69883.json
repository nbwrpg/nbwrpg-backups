My personal goal is not for the Minions (or any other faction for that\nmatter) to win ultimately, but to be sure that everyone has fun.\n\nHowever, while I have your attention I did have some questions that perhaps\nsomeone could help me with since I was not here during the original\ninception of the RPG:\n\nOn the Wiki page there is written:\n\n&gt; Unicron was known to threaten the Past-Earth setting of NBW,\n&gt; but an alliance of factions were able to drive him away by\n&gt; creating a super-weapon. When Unicron left the system he left\n&gt; a force of his Minions behind. Unicron has yet to return but all\n&gt; assume that he eventually will.\nAND THIS:\n\n&gt; After Unicron &lt;https://mail.google.com/w/nbwrpg_wiki/unicron/&gt; left the\nperiphery of the system, he left several\n&gt; sleeping Minions &lt;https://mail.google.com/w/nbwrpg_wiki/minions/&gt; on the\nmoon. He had realized that the\nenergon&lt;https://mail.google.com/w/nbwrpg_wiki/energon/&gt;\n&gt; present on Earth &lt;https://mail.google.com/w/nbwrpg_wiki/earth/&gt; was too\npowerful for him to absorb right away,\n&gt; and had decided to keep a watchful eye on the planet until the\n&gt; crystals were ripe for his taking. With the Cybertronians&lt;https://mail.google.com/w/nbwrpg_wiki/cybertronians/&gt;out of\n&gt; his way, he went pleased with himself.\n\nBoth of these histories seem to be slightly different. In one he was driven\naway by a super weapon and so left a force behind. In the other he left on\nhis own, and left a force to wait for better times. Any idea which is\ncorrect? Also, what super weapon is being refered to, and is it still in\nexistance? Aand, how was the energon of old Earth too powerful for Unicron,\nwas it the Vok influence on things? I would imagine that the planet\ndestroyer Unicron would not be put off by the Earth, unless biological life\nis difficult for him to absorb???\n\nAlso, is this Unicron from 4 millions years ago and so is ignorant of where\nthese BW&#39;s versions come from, or is this a Unicron that has been knocked\nback 4 million years and so has knowledge of all the transformer events?\n\nI know this is old news, and probrably not written by anyone here, but I am\nmaking sure that it is still relevant to how we are playing now. If we need\nto make any changes, now would probrably be a good time? This information\nhas an impact on how I plan to have the minions proceed and may modify the\ngoals the they have.\n\nAny insights or thoughts that anyone has would be most appreciated.\n\nThanks\nPreston\nOn Thu, Mar 25, 2010 at 2:40 AM, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: It feels like things keep interrupting the Maximal plot.
