As he does so he sends word to Lord Elder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is Tucson Prime to Lord Elder, Over!  Erect the defense shields and \n&gt; keep a window open for my arrival!  We have Rodimus Prime, I repeat we \n&gt; have Rodimus Prime!  We need all medics front and center! I don&#39;t know how \n&gt; much time we have to save Rodimus, and we&#39;re dealing with unknown life \n&gt; forms down here.  Expect us within an eight hour time span.  This is \n&gt; Tucson Prime signing out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At the Ark, Night Shift also hears the message.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sweet, the big guy did it, he got everyone tagether for a group effort. \n&gt; They&#39;re commn&#39; back.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap sits on the edge of his seat hoping for his big buddy to return \n&gt; safely.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;C&#39;mon Wheels, C&#39;mon, you can do this, I know you can do this...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In the tunnels, Quick Stride and Straight Shot try to take off the strands \n&gt; of silk from around Rodimus&#39;s body, and find it to be super sticky.\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot tries shaking it off her hands with very little luck.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Talk about being &quot;stuck&quot; in between a rock and a hard place. It&#39;s worse \n&gt; than astro sludge!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quick Stride too, has a hard time getting it off his fingers.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ughhh, you said that right Straight Shot. This goop doesn&#39;t wanna come \n&gt; off! Legacy, can ya help us out?  Can&#39;t get this stuff off of Rodimus, \n&gt; it&#39;s just too slaggn&#39; sticky.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Talon/perceptor:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; talon and perceptor go inside Tucson and started to monitor rodimus\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Preston Carroll&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, May 31, 2010 3:54 PM\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Into the Darkness\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;We have to up load all the pod&quot;said The blind Predacon&quot;All the \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; medicals\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the ark must be contacted and warned&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Legacy leaped off Tuscon&#39;s cab to help Talon and Perceptor to load up\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus, his large bulk making the job of carrying Rodimus and the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cocoon like apparatus around him easier to carry.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He carefully lifted him into his arms as he looked about, his single\n&gt;&gt; &gt; optic seeming to take in more then just what was obvious visually.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile at the caves, the red, yellow and orange colored insectile\n&gt;&gt; &gt; creatures began to buzz as their wings began to move rapidly in the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; air.

Several\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of them seemed to just now be becoming aware of Tuscon and his party\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as the queen herself settled back on the center spire of the room to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; watch her babies prepare themselves for something.
