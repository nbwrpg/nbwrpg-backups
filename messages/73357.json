I just hope you don&#39;t catch this...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns his head just in time.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; AHHHCHOO!  All right. Perceptor, Windlord, Tarantulus developed this virus\n&gt; and he&#39;s the only one who knows the cure.  Before it spreads to the rest of\n&gt; the ark, I need you to see if you can access his data files and find the\n&gt; antidote for this illness.  Uproar is also in need of treatment and he needs\n&gt; to be treated first. As soon as you get the intel, pass it onto Stanton and\n&gt; Bump. Can you do that for me?  For the Ark?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nEven as the MAXIMAL GUARDIAN was speaking LEGACY turned to regard him,\n&quot;There is no need to access Tarantulus&#39; data storage, I already\npossess all the requisite data neccesary to cure you of this malady.&quot;\n\nThere was so much about LEGACY that no one really knew. Where exactly\ndid he come from and how much did he really know about all of them? He\nsaid he was from the future and was some sort of temporal guardian,\nbut what exactly did that mean and who&#39;s timeline was he guarding?\n\nSo far no one has really had time to sit down and figure out, and now\nthat things are coming to head, finding the time will be difficult.\n\nRODIMUS turned to look at LEGACY and then TUCSON, &quot;Okay, for the\nmoment Tucson is grounded as is Nightshift.&quot; he said evenly.\n\nHe looked around at who was left, &quot;Rat Trap, you Windlord and\nPerceptor are with me, we need to find out more about the humans.&quot;\n\nRODIMUS looked over at TORCA, &quot;I will you to be my optics and audio\nsensors here at the base, consult with Lord Elder. Make sure it stays\nsafe.&quot;\n\nTORCA nodded.\n\n&quot;And send out some of your best fliers, see if you can scout out any\nmore Maximals.&quot;\n\nTORCA nodded again,\n\nLEO PRIME spoke up, &quot;And I will see about getting everything packed up\nfor a return trip to Cybertron.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from RODIMUS, &quot;Good.&quot; He turned to look at the others,\n&quot;Any questions?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
