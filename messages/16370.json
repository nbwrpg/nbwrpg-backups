We have a five bot group right now, Destructor makes \n&gt; six, \n&gt; &gt; Dollen and GoldenEye will be back soon theres eight add the \n&gt; alliance \n&gt; &gt; forces and we&#39;ll have a small army working with us, and then, \nthen \n&gt; &gt; followers will join us or fall before us, and Megatron will be \nour \n&gt; &gt; first victim.&quot; Phobias eyes lit up at the prospect of being the \nbot \n&gt; &gt; behind the bot who joined the forces of Predacon and Alliance, \n&gt; being \n&gt; &gt; the unknown shadow that the great leaders throughout history have \n&gt; &gt; cast. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She thought about the situation.  She didn&#39;t know the bots who \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; so far, helping htem out.  Usually when one helped, they \nexpected \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; favor returned, and with more in return than what was offered.  \n&gt; She \n&gt; &gt; &gt; looked at Phobia,&quot;Tell me, who is this Destrustor?  And why did \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; help us? No Pred would just help and expect nothing in return. \n&gt; &gt; Also, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if Megatron is without followers, who does that leave us with? \nI \n&gt; &gt; &gt; heard that most of our groups is gone.&quot;  She looked down and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sighed. &quot;I know that I can only trust you and Drillbit right \nnow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She looked up at Phobia.  &quot;I think it would be best if we \ntakled \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this Desctuctor. Then we need to get our group together.  I  \nknow \n&gt; &gt; I&quot;m \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not the only one who wants to get Megatron for deserting us.  \nAnd \n&gt; &gt; &gt; once Megatron is done with, we can then start looking for a \nbase \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; our own.
