The Maximal scientist was looking at the damage.  Badly\ninjured\n&gt; robots.  Extensive damage to the Ark.  It would take to long to repair.\nTo\n&gt; long in the war.  Someone coudl attack.  And crush them finally.\n&gt; &quot;We have to take drastic measures.  We&#39;ve been going down the tubes.\nAttack\n&gt; after attack after attack weakens us.  Every attack we do worse.  Do you\nknow\n&gt; what causes it?&quot; Ramhorn asked.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Errr...bad guns?&quot; Smokescreen guessed stupidly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re outnumbered?&quot; Beachomber said with a more probable answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Errr...no.  &#39;Good&#39; guesses though.  &quot;Bad leadership.  Really bad\nleadership.\n&gt;  Terrible leadership.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;From Liono Prime?&quot; Beachcomber asked, knowing the answer though.  Who\nelse\n&gt; could he be talking about?\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes.  We need to hold a no-confidence vote.  Iron Raptor needs to get in\n&gt; charge.  From what you&#39;ve told me, she risked her life just to try and\ncalm\n&gt; down an insane robot.  Or at least insane with rage.  Deeds like that are\n&gt; what the Maximals are all about.  Peaceful solutions.  We&#39;re pacifists.\nWeak\n&gt; in some eyes, but we&#39;re strong.  Iron Raptor has reminded me or what a\n&gt; Maximal is.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;War sometimes makes the Autobots and ourselves forget our principles.\n&gt; Rarely with the Autobots, unfortunately not so rare with us.  Iron Raptor\nis\n&gt; the best choice for our leader.  Strong.  Intelligent.  Sane.  Thoughtful.\n&gt; Caring.  Courageous.  And if needed, one skid plate-kicking warrior as\nshe&#39;s\n&gt; proved time, and time again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Woah.&quot; Beachcomber commented, letting everything sink in, since he&#39;d only\n&gt; been there for a while.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Should we go tell everyone?&quot; Smokescreen asked, excitement in his voice.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What?  Now?  Are you slagging crazy!?  With the Ark in ruins, and our\ntroops\n&gt; half dead?  We won&#39;t be voting until AFTER the Ark is repaired.  We can&#39;t\nbe\n&gt; in a meeting room now with all our troops near death and our base near\n&gt; blowing up.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Need us to get you to a CR chamber?&quot; Beachcomber concerned, hearing they\n&gt; weren&#39;t to spread the news quite yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No.  You go find Iron Raptor and get some orders.  Ask her what to do.\nI&#39;m\n&gt; sure she&#39;ll know.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ok.&quot; Beachcomber and Smokescreen said in unison, walking off towards Iron\n&gt; Raptor, seeing her, Archangel, and Prowl together.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; After the two other Maximals had left, Ramhorn activated his com.\n&gt; &lt;Plintissa, this is Ramhorn.  Follow the source of my com.  I need to\nspeak\n&gt; with you.  It is VERY important.  I urge you to come, despite\n&gt; our...differences.&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Beachcomber and Smokescreen appraoched Iron Raptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Requestion orderes, ma&#39;am.&quot; they asked in unison.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; SALESFORCE.COM MAKES SOFTWARE OBSOLETE\n&gt; Secure, online sales force automation with 5 users FREE for 1 year!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/2658/13/_/_/_/961657297/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
