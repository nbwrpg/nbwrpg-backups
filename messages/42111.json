How the hell did he get there?, wondered Iss. \n&gt; Iss breifly considered possibilities. Chances were pretty slim that the robot \n&gt; had just &quot;woken up&quot; from some years-long slumber, and thus been previously \n&gt; missing on sensors. That could be the messenger of another faction.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Vorb&quot; sent Iss. &quot;That bot in the clearing may be another potential ally. We \n&gt; should investigate.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; [I agree] sent back Vorb. [Let&#39;s go.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Iss took hold over VorbIss&#39;s cooperative systems, and walked VorbIss to the \n&gt; hatch controls. Iss found the &quot;Open&quot; button and pressed it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iss spoke throught the semi-open hatch entrance. &quot;Robot, do you read me? I am \n&gt; VorbIss. Who are you, and what is your faction?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Vorb::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Robot, do you read me? I am VorbIss. Who are you, and what is your faction?&quot; \n&gt; said Iss.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vorb was unsure of Iss&#39;s abilit&#92;y to operate acceptably by himself. Iss was, \n&gt; on the surface, obviously loyal to Vorb. Closer analysis of Iss, through \n&gt; their neural link, revealed a small issue, however: Iss was loyal to \n&gt; protecting the body. Vorb himself, the spark, was Iss&#39;s second priority.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vorb gently guided a nano-bot control tendril into position above Iss&#39;s \n&gt; cognitive processors. He took aim. He pushed.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Iss::\n&gt; \n&gt; Pain! Pain! Pain! Thought was wrapping itself in a body of nanoprobes and \n&gt; Vorb was is will be Iss is gone!\n&gt; \n&gt; What was left of Iss&#39;s mind after the inserted control tendril reeled. \n&gt; Infinite loops were cropping up. Glitches in his software suddenly appearing. \n&gt; And through it all, Iss&#39;s changing processors experienced everything. It \n&gt; occured to Iss that Vorb was taking over his mind, and that he had \n&gt; underestimated the spark. That soon Iss would cease to exist, and so would \n&gt; Vorb, both merging to become the entity VorbIss. This did not surprise Iss, \n&gt; though; It was like a law of nature. As taken-for-granted as gravity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iss shuddered, then suddenly was not Iss.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::VorbIss::\n&gt; \n&gt; The weird contortions of his face finally finished, what with the messy \n&gt; business of melding Iss&#39;s mind into his, VorbIss analized his situation. He \n&gt; had a taser, a laser, and a shuttle to hide in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Through the open shuttle doors, he took aim at the bot which had stumbled in. \n&gt; &quot;Halt. I am VorbIss, poly-consolidated intelligent robot. Explain yourself.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; VorbIss really really didn&#39;t want to fire. He had to act tough, of course, \n&gt; but the energy a taser shot would cost him would be too much.\n&gt; \n&gt; VorbIss waited for a reply form the haggard bot.\n\n\n"}}
