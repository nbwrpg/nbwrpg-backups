Plintissa walked outside, Dracona\nfollowing her, in a way, Dracona feels she had lost her best friend in\nPlintissa, as she was completely silent now.\n\nOff in a distant Matrix, Suukie&#39;s spark was looked upon, and the Matrix\nbelieved that he should be sent back, he wasn&#39;t ready yet, and the Maximals\nneeded another hero. A new body was contructed, and Suukie&#39;s spark was put\nin, and The Artist was born, and he was sent back to Earth...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, June 16, 2000 3:48 PM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nHappy birthday, Thecode.\n\n::Zardus::\n\nZardus raises an eyebrow.\n\n&quot;Training?&quot;\n\nInwardly, Zardus swears. It was in his best interests to keep the maximals\nalive. Without the maximals to ally with if needed, he could be attacked by\nthe predacons, possibly losing to them.\n\nHe turns to Liono. &quot;Either way,&quot; he says, &quot;Your troops need help.
