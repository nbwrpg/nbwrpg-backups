He couldn&#39;t let ya sit there=\r\n and get destroyed, he risked his spark ta save ya, and I&#39;m glad we got ya =\r\nback.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson directs an ear toward Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, no one i=\r\ns going to go after you, as long as my spark remains strong. Rodimus, we&#39;ve=\r\n been through a great ordeal, but I promise you that no harm to you will go=\r\n un noticed. That hive has caused nothing but strife for all of us, and I w=\r\nill not tolerate that happening again. So here is where we stand.. We have =\r\ntwo enemies to vanquish. Yet in order to stop one, we must stop the other. =\r\nWe need to know everything there is about those insectoids, and find out th=\r\neir weaknesses, and subdue them. Then, we will deal with what comes afterwa=\r\nrds. I can only hope that all of us, including Windlord, will be able to tu=\r\nrn the tables which desperately need turning.&quot;\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus looked reli=\r\neved as he heard about Eilita and Nightlight, a\nsmile blossoming across his=\r\n face, &quot;Good.&quot; he said, his optics bright\nwith joy.

ELita Ran towards hers dad\n&gt;=\r\n and Huged him tightly&quot;You and my mom came back!!!! I missed you daddy.... =\r\nI\n&gt; miss you and my mom&quot;Elita started to sob&quot;you never leave me again, neit=\r\nher\n&gt; my mom, will you? will you never leave again?

There\nwas so much going =\r\non and they had to get it all out in the open before\nthings progressed too =\r\nfar.\n\nTorca the leader and general of the Maximal Fuzors also stepped into\n=\r\nthe room, his large tusks that were attached to his shoulder rose up\nover h=\r\nis head barely missed the cieling as he ducked down slightly to\ncome throug=\r\nh the doorway. He looked around his optics softening\nslightly as he saw for=\r\n himself that Rodimus was awake.\n\n&quot;Yes indeed we do have much to discuss.&quot; =\r\nhis deep voice boomed across\nthe room. He looked at Perceptor for a long mo=\r\nment as if he were about\nto send him out of the room, but then he just turn=\r\ned his massive head\nto peer at Rodimus and then Tuscon, &quot;And then I am sure=\r\n both of you\nwill need your rest.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
