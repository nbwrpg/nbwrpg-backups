And I thought I had something to tell \n&gt; KSLaw, but I forgot.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq and Bronco watched Spears walks away from them, and talked \nwith \n&gt; others. They were confused, but ran back up to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My namie is Fliq, and this is Bronco. We brought back the pods \nwith \n&gt; Ramulus.(DID Ramulus bring them back while I was gone? If they \ndidn&#39;t \n&gt; tell me, so I can scratch everything I did and wait for Yanshosh to \n&gt; come back.) We know your name because Ramulus told us the story \nabout \n&gt; the attack you guys suffered when getting the pod. We thought you \nhad \n&gt; seen us arrive. We knew this was you because we heard somebody call \n&gt; the other bird-like bot Shadow-Wing. So, we&#39;re friendly and all we \n&gt; want to do is get some parts for the ship. It&#39;ll never fly again, \nof \n&gt; course, but it will make it almost impermiable. So what do you say?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (In the future we might have a big task. When we finaly finish this \n&gt; story and get ready to start the next, we have to leave everything \nas \n&gt; the way it was for G1, meaning we&#39;d have to find someway of getting \n&gt; The Ark to the volcano. I know it&#39;s probably years from now, but I \n&gt; like pointing out the obvious.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois looked at the three new bots, and agve them their \nassignement.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;From now on, you three will be known as The Peace Angels. You will \n&gt; protect the embassy at all costs. It must nto fall to any attacks. \nIn \n&gt; a few days, Windrazor and I are going to the Alliance base. You \nwill \n&gt; stay here and defend.
