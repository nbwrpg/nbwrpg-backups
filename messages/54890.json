She \nfollowed her little fox nose around to the kitchens, past the \nengineering hangers, through the private quarters and to the main \nentrance.  She looked around and inhaled the fresh outside air. She \nlooked out and saw some white butterflies dancing on the breeze.  She \nran after them in an attemp to play with them.  She jumped around and \nleaped at them. But the butterflies were always just out of \nreach. &quot;Hey, how can we play tag if I can&#39;t tag you?&quot; she giggled.  \nShe stopped a few hundred yards from the base and got a drink of \nwater from a small stream.  She sighed and sat down. She yawned and \nlayed down.  She looked up and watched the soft fluffy white clouds \npass by.  She saw different shapes in the clouds and started to name \nthem. &quot;Bunny, transport pod, small lunar module, fish, a flower, &quot;  \nshe stopped and sighed. &quot;Mom, I hope your listening. I am trying to \nbe good here. And Dad, I still don&#39;t like eating meat. It tastes \nfunny. Can I please stick with just the sweet energon?&quot;  She sighed \nand looked down. She rested her head on her paws and whispered. &quot;Mom, \nDad, wish you were here.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Nightlight still is inside the base\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
