When all is said and done, I&#39;d like very much to hear what you \nhave to tell me. Send a message for me, to Lord Elder, Stanton and Bump.  I \nwant Legacy cast out of the Ark as soon as it&#39;s possible.  And if he dares \nto return, I will deal with him personally. After that, I want the Ark \nreconfigured to recognize him as an enemy.  Therefore it will secure your \nparameter safely, from harm, if he dares to try to re enter the Ark. I&#39;ll \nlet you have the honors of reconfiguring the Ark to those specifications.&quot;\n\nNight Shift looks to Tucson.\n\n&quot;Um, you got a not so friendly look on your face..  What gives?&quot;\n\nTucson turns to Night Shift.\n\n&quot;Legacy..  I should have listened to Stanton and now, I&#39;m paying for that \nmistake.  He&#39;s beyraying us, and all right under my nose...&quot;\n\nNight Shift puts a hand on his buddy&#39;s arm.\n\n&quot;Hey, you were just ben&#39; a Prime, you were givn&#39; &#39;em a chance, like any \nPrime would do, &#39;specially Optimus.  There&#39;s nothn&#39; wrong with that, hey, we \ncan&#39;t all be perfect... But if ya ask me, Legacy, he reminds me of someone \nreal familliar...  Remember Shockwave?&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;Shockwave... That&#39;s right...  Why didn&#39;t I make that connection earlier? \nAnyway, right now we have to focus on what&#39;s most important, and right now, \nkeeping everyone safe is the most important issue at hand.&quot;\n\nHe looks back to Kup.\n\n&quot;Kup, for now, let&#39;s do what the voice demands of us, I have a feeling if we \njust play along, an opportunity will come to get out of this predicament... \nAfter all...  Someone is still on their way here..&quot;\n\nHe narrows his eyes further, and concentrates deeply and this time, he \nattempts to contact Legacy.\n\n&quot; When I took the power of the Matrix, I swore to honor my comrades by \nkeeping them safe, and trust them as equals.  I gave you that chance, and \nyou repay me by turning your back on my factions.  I will not tolerate such \ninsuborination, and it is with that in mind, that I am demanding you leave \nthe Ark  and renounce your position among us effective immediatley.  You \nwill not give Stanton, Bump or Lord Elder any grief.  If I hear of your \nreistance, I will give them the orders to terminate you on contact.  Am I \nunderstood?!&quot;\n\nFor the first time,his voice becomes gruff, as it did when he was only a \nregular Autobot.  His temper returns a slight, as it is now heard by his \ncomrades.\n\nNight Shift swallows hard.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re really lucky guys... We&#39;re lucky we&#39;re on his good side, because if \nwe weren&#39;t, it would really be curtains for us too.  I know Tucson, he \ndoesn&#39;t put up with Scrap..&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras/Perceptor/Elita:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;i dotn consider a deal till Perceptor was surrender to us, That \n&gt; treacherous\n&gt; Rat must be punished&quot; Hydras hissed with hate.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m afraid that THAT couldnt be posible, Lord Hydras&quot;taunted Perceptor by\n&gt; comlink&quot;The words &#39;Political Inmunity Granted&#39; ring some bells in your\n&gt; multiple heads?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras Tensed his body and replied with hate &quot;But always something could\n&gt; happen and the dead bots doesnt speak&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I never leave a work without finish, Hydras, you know it well&quot;replied\n&gt; Perceptor by comlink&quot;Now if you excuse me...

Do you trust me?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; **********\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita as soon as she heard the voices in her comlink and the lights turn\n&gt; off, she sought for a hideout. If a enemie was inside, it was smart not to\n&gt; be in plain sight... Maybe she could ambush him and show her daddy and\n&gt; mommie how fierce she could be, she transforms to her beast mode and hide\n&gt; behinds some pipers, listening and waitting in silence.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message----- \n&gt; From: Sandy\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 18, 2011 9:15 PM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: Wicked Blades in the Dark!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride now trots toward Rodimus.  He wasn&#39;t sure as to what would\n&gt; happen but he does as Rodimus asks.

Well, certainly smell the same and your signature&#39;s the same..\n&gt; Okay, I can trust ya.

You know, the voice, it&#39;s familliar....  Legacy...  It&#39;s \n&gt; either\n&gt; it&#39;s you, Legacy, or it&#39;s a trick.  If it is you, I ask only this, why? \n&gt; Why\n&gt; would you carry out such a deception for such a long time?  And why did I\n&gt; not listen when it was imperative to do so?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He lays them down.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If you must take someone, why not take me?  The power of the Matrix \n&gt; burns\n&gt; bright in my chest, it&#39;s what you want isn&#39;t it?  Then come, take it, but\n&gt; leave Rodimus, Lord Elder, and the rest of the Autobots and Maximals \n&gt; alone.\n&gt; That is why I&#39;ve been given this power, so that they can live without fear\n&gt; or danger.  And if I must sacrifice myself to do so, then so be it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He steps forward, and then stops, standing couragiously in front of his\n&gt; comrades, to ensure their saftey.  Yet he makes no moves to attack \n&gt; himself.\n&gt; In order to brace himself calmly, he closes his optics, waiting to see if\n&gt; the voice takes up his offer.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I second that question.

You will lay down your weapons or you will loose more than\n&gt; &gt; your companion.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The sound of the metal scraping on metal can be heard. &quot;Optimus, Hound,\n&gt; &gt; Bluestreak . . . &quot; the voice echoes slightly as if the speaker is in a\n&gt; &gt; large\n&gt; &gt; room, it trailed off ominously.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Who are you?&quot;demanded Perceptor whose still showed a cold blood\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A quiet voice came over the speakers, &quot;You have forgotten me Perceptor, \n&gt; &gt; so\n&gt; &gt; soon?&quot; There was a chuckle, &quot;Ahhh, but then we never had a chance to \n&gt; &gt; truly\n&gt; &gt; get to know each other.&quot; There was a short pause and then the voice \n&gt; &gt; said,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Perhaps we will soon enough.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Talon a Windlord were shocked and they didnt knew what to do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras was slighty surpriced but waited to know more, he typed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Cyclonus, using a secret channel, in order to find it out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what goin on\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus sent a quiet message back. &quot;It is Nightrazor, one of the \n&gt; &gt; soldiers\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; brought with me.

The power is out, and Nightlight is barely alive. This piece\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; scrap is holding her hostage!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bump cut in, &quot;I don&#39;t know what has happened to Elita.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Santon and Bump talked another voice cut in, this one over the \n&gt; &gt; Autobot\n&gt; &gt; and Maximal channels, it was heavily encrypted &quot;Stall them!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was Rodimus&#39; voice, and he was speaking rapidly. &quot;I think I have a \n&gt; &gt; way\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; get us out of this!
