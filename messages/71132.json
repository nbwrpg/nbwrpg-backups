She sighs in relief.  She looks up to hi=\r\nm.\n\n&quot; That was way too close that time Tucson.  Rodimus is right, what was =\r\nthat all about?&quot;\n\nTucson turns his attentions to Rodimus and Straight Shot.=\r\n\n\n&quot; I - I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m sorry.  Of course, no harm will come to anyone h=\r\nere, Legacy, Rodimus, excuse my actions, they were not done with the best o=\r\nf judgement.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to Tucson, and this time with a concerne=\r\nd look on her face.\n\n&quot; Ever since that day, you haven&#39;t been the same.  I k=\r\nnow, I was there, and lemme tell ya it haunts me too.  Have ya ever thought=\r\n ta open up about it Tucson?  Maybe that would kinda help ya heal a little =\r\nbit.  The wounds are still fresh, even though that fight was a long time ag=\r\no.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re right.  Rodimus, Legacy, I&#39;ve been keeping som=\r\nething from you for a long time, and that&#39;s not what a respectable leader d=\r\noes.  A leader may be strong but he too, must open up about the issues that=\r\n weaken his state of mind.  It all started on the day of that battle, that =\r\nhad Rodimus abducted and taken over by Hydras and his forces.  I fought in =\r\nthat battle as a soldier. And being a Ninjabot myself, I knew of Nightrazor=\r\n&#39;s properties, yet I felt that if I barged in on Rodimus, it would only lan=\r\nd me with a case of insubordination.  So, I refrained from doing so, but tr=\r\nied to divert enemy attentions indirectly.  For the most part it worked and=\r\n I was able to fight my way through those who knew nothing about Ninjabot c=\r\nombat.  Yet, there were seekers who were far more swift on their wings then=\r\n I was on my wheels.  They were bearing down on the Autobots, to the point =\r\nthat I felt that if I did not step in, there wouldn&#39;t be an Autobot left to=\r\n defend the Ark or the planet.&quot;\n\nHe pauses.\n\n&quot; From what I remember, I tran=\r\nsformed into my vehicle mode, and started to kick up dirt from my tires, in=\r\n hopes that a seeker would see what I was up to.  It worked, and I grabbed =\r\nthe attention of several, although I couldn&#39;t see who they were because the=\r\ny were rather high up from me.  Then, suddenly, I was struck.  And I don&#39;t =\r\nremember anything more than that.  A long time afterwards, I was brought ba=\r\nck online, and when I woke up, I could only see darkness.  At first, I thou=\r\nght it was a power outage, but then, I was told that my optic sensors were =\r\ncompletely destroyed by the cranial shot that I had endured during that cha=\r\nse.  I asked about you Rodimus, but, no one could tell me what happened.  I=\r\nt was at that point where I knew that I failed you  If only I had listened =\r\nto myself the first time, and came in front of you when you were chasing Ni=\r\nghtrazor that first time.  You would not have suffered as you had, nor woul=\r\nd your family. And since then, I pledged to get back on my feet, and never =\r\nlet my defenses down again, and if I had to, I&#39;d strike back harder than an=\r\ny Decepticon or Predacon could ever fathom.  I failed you once Rodimus, and=\r\n I pledged NEVER to let that happen again.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to Tucson =\r\nwith a thoughtful gaze.\n\n&quot;Wow, you never even told me all that before.  Wel=\r\nl, since we&#39;re opening up about it, I wish I could help you guys understand=\r\n what happened, but I only remember a little bit more than he does. Right b=\r\nefore he got shot, I saw Cyclonus decending just a tad closser to us than t=\r\nhe other seekers that were following us.  I saw him take the shot and I scr=\r\neamed, and that&#39;s when everything went blank.  I think what would really he=\r\nlp Tucson now, is knowing that what happened, really wasn&#39;t his fault.&quot;\n\nTu=\r\ncson now turns his head toward Megatron&#39;s body.\n\n&quot; Having the Decepticons h=\r\nere amongst us is highly un nerving to me.  There must be a way to separate=\r\n them from the Autobots, and place them in a safe location...  Wait, I reme=\r\nmber something..  The Decepticons had their own craft, The Nemisis...  Why =\r\ncouldn&#39;t we return them to their rightful craft and separate them from the =\r\nAutobots, where both factions would be safe from harm?  Rodimus, due to cir=\r\ncumbstances which I have just told you, for my own emotional stability, I c=\r\nan not have these Decepticons here.  But I&#39;m willing to help preserve them =\r\nin a safe location away from the Ark.  Legacy, if you could, I&#39;d like you t=\r\no find out where the Nemisis is now located and if it is within reach.  Onc=\r\ne located, I want the Decepticons brought safely back to their own ship, wh=\r\nere they can rest in peace, thus leaving the Ark to the Autobots to do the =\r\nsame.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot smiles.\n\n&quot;Now that&#39;s more like the Tucson I know.  I =\r\nlike that idea, I like it alot.&quot;\n\nOutside the Ark, Uproar and Quickstride l=\r\nook to each other and just shrug off the event.\n\n&quot;Hmm, oh well, would&#39;ve be=\r\nen fun ta see them end up in the tar pit but, works for me, Uproar.&quot;\n\nUproa=\r\nr nodds.\n\n&quot;Ditto.  Okay, so, I guess we can go back inside.&quot;\n\nThey get into=\r\n beast mode, and prance back into the Ark. Yet, Uproar could not help but l=\r\nook back with a perplexed look on his face.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hydra=\r\ns did a final shot and send a secret message to Nightrazor &quot;The door\n&gt; is o=\r\npen, time to leave&quot;and said in loud voice &quot;PREDACONS... RETREAT!!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Hy=\r\ndras picked up inferno and started to leave the area\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Tuscon&#39;s] eyes=\r\n narrow dangerously.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;THAT&#39;S IT! I&#39;VE HAD ENOUGH!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He sense=\r\ns where Megatron&#39;s body was laying down, and slams his foot on his\n&gt; chest,=\r\n pointing an arrow straight for it!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; HYDRAS, NIGHTRAZOR, CYCLONUS,=\r\n SCOURGE! IF YOU ARE WITHIN RANGE OF MY\n&gt; COMMUNICATIONS HEAR THIS! YOU DAR=\r\nE TO HARM MY FELLOW MAXIMALS AND AUTOBOTS,\n&gt; AND THREATEN TO TAKE THEIR LIV=\r\nES! WELL, I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU TOO! YOU&#39;VE LEFT\n&gt; ME NO CHOICE BUT TO DO THE=\r\n SAME TO YOU AS WELL! I HAVE MEGATRON&#39;S BODY UNDER\n&gt; MY FOOT, AND AN ARROW =\r\nSTRAIGHT FOR HIS CHEST CHAMBER! YOU STEP FOOT ANY\n&gt; FURTHER INTO MY ARK, TA=\r\nKE ANOTHER AUTOBOT OR MAXIMAL AND I SWEAR I&#39;LL BE\n&gt; SURE HE NEVER WAKES UP!=\r\n PERIOD!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; His voice echoes throught the Ark. With each word he ratt=\r\nles the Ark,\n&gt; voice booming like that of an angry lion. He was sick of the=\r\n Predacons and\n&gt; Decepticon&#39;s attack on his Ark, and he holds his position =\r\nover Megatron and\n&gt; awaits their response before doing anything to anyone. =\r\nYet, the arrow\n&gt; remains pointed for a perfect shot to the fallen Megatron&#39;=\r\ns chest!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He then turns his head to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I want you to=\r\n know you have full permission to permanently disable any\n&gt; predacons or De=\r\ncepticons you see fit. Scour the parameters of the Ark, and\n&gt; be sure no on=\r\ne gets in, Rodimus. I&#39;ll handle Nightrazor in here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimu=\r\ns looked at Tuscon, a look of complete surprise on his face, &quot;What are\n&gt; yo=\r\nu doing?&quot; he said as he looked at Tuscon and then at the weapon that was\n&gt; =\r\nbeing pointed at Megatron.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tuscon, Hydras is already retreating! LOOK=\r\n!&quot; he said, pointing at Hydras\n&gt; who had picked up his fallen teammate and =\r\nwas already moving out of the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At this same time Legacy also st=\r\nepped into the room, coming from one of the\n&gt; back corridors into the front=\r\n. As a guardian, it was his job, his internal\n&gt; directive to keep the Ark a=\r\nnd all of its occupants safe, an imperative that\n&gt; would also include even =\r\nthe Decepticons that were to wake up several million\n&gt; years later.\n&gt; \n&gt; Le=\r\ngacy&#39;s single optic pulsed as he took in the scene, Hydras leaving and\n&gt; Tu=\r\nscon pointing a weapon at Megatron to ensure that he did so.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;NONE OF =\r\nTHE ARK&#39;S OCCUPANTS ARE TO COME TO HARM.&quot; Legacy said, falling into\n&gt; his o=\r\nld coldly logical voice. His voice sounded nothing if not more formal,\n&gt; hi=\r\ns tones frigid, his words clear as crystal, and his stance firm and\n&gt; resol=\r\nved. Legacy pointedly glanced at Straight Shot and then back at Tuscon,\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nTO PUT OUR FUTURE IN JEOPARDY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PErceptor gain control of the ark and activate all the in=\r\nternal defences\n&gt; against the Hydra&#39;s predacons and tried to\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; As preceptor worked, the Ark began to respond to his commands as weapons\n=\r\n&gt; began to activate, internal defenses systems came online.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What is y=\r\nour command?&quot; Teletran 1 asked Perceptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; MEANWHILE IN THE MEDICAL =\r\nBAY:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight continue peacefully sleeping while Eli=\r\nta jumped on the bed in\n&gt; her beast form and nuzzled in her mom&#39;s cheek whi=\r\nle she cried in silence.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Mommie&quot;said Elita&quot; I miss you so much... so m=\r\nuch&quot;sobbed the little girl\n&gt; while her tears fell in her mom&#39;s cheek\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;=\r\nNEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightlight continued to sleep, as all around her the machines reg=\r\nistered her\n&gt; as resting in a comma like state. All of her systems seemed o=\r\ntherwise in\n&gt; stable condition.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus looked at Nightlight and Elita=\r\n, a soft look on his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then Tuscon&#39;s voice boomed through, threate=\r\nning the Predacons. &quot;SLAG!&quot;\n&gt; Ramulus said as he glanced back at Elita, &quot;Yo=\r\nu stay here.&quot; Ramulus said.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to lock you in and then go see if =\r\nanything can be done for our\n&gt; medical staff.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus spoke as he qui=\r\nckly gathered up a few med packs and a scanner.\n&gt; &quot;Danged daft Predacons, c=\r\nausing so much damage.&quot; Ramulus grumbled under his\n&gt; breath. Ramulus was no=\r\n medic, but he did know a bit about first aid. Perhaps\n&gt; there was somethin=\r\ng he could so for Santon and Bump who were still lying on\n&gt; the floor of th=\r\ne corridors. Perhaps they were not as . . . hurt as they\n&gt; looked. He could=\r\nn&#39;t even bring himself to think of them as dead.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a last look at E=\r\nlita he left. The door clicked as he locked it and then\n&gt; the room that Eli=\r\nta was in went silent except for the computer monitors that\n&gt; were watching=\r\n over Nightlight.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the moment all was peaceful in the medbay.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nHowever outside the Ark was a very different matter!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nindlord and Kup keep their fire against Scourge and Deepstrike\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; As the firefight continues Deepstryke took a hit, as did Scourge, forci=\r\nng\n&gt; them to break off their attack on the door and swing up into the air t=\r\no\n&gt; avoid any further and more critical damage. Several more of the sweeps =\r\nwere\n&gt; blasted from the skies, the last one swinging up next to his master =\r\nScourge,\n&gt; almost as if for protection.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Predacons were looking dec=\r\nidedly more damaged and a bit more tired then\n&gt; before. Energon looked to b=\r\ne looking a bit lower than before and the shots\n&gt; from Windlord and Kup wer=\r\ne building up on them, not to mention the firepower\n&gt; coming from the fuzor=\r\ns as well as Leo II! Yes, the Predacons had breached\n&gt; the door, but gettin=\r\ng further in would be an uphill battle indeed, and many\n&gt; of them did not l=\r\nook to be in the best shape to fight it!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Ou=\r\ntside, Quickstride quickly gets Uproar to his feet, and\n&gt; assesses the situ=\r\nation. He then looks around the parameters and then\n&gt; remembers a body of g=\r\noop, that resembled a tar pit, not far from the Ark&#39;s\n&gt; parameters. Uproar =\r\nlooks to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; *&lt;SNIP/CUT/PASTE&gt;*\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar and Quickstride now=\r\n approach Deep Stryke and the others with their\n&gt; hands up in submission. Q=\r\nuickstride is the first to approach them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Deepstryke hovere=\r\nd in the air as he noticed the two walked towards him, his\n&gt; cannons swivel=\r\ning to track them when they spoke . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, okay, y=\r\nou got us, you got us. Why don&#39;t we just show you guys an\n&gt; easy way inta t=\r\nhe ark hmm?

Perhaps there was a part of him that WA=\r\nNTED to\n&gt; believe it. Then Hydras&#39; call went out to retreat!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Blast yo=\r\nu Maximal!&quot; Deepstryke said as he began to pull back. &quot;NEXT TIME we\n&gt; will =\r\nbreach your walls and TAKE what we want!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Predacons began to back =\r\nup, moving into the air, slowly moving away from\n&gt; the Ark, even as the Ark=\r\n&#39;s cannons and weaponry began to move and come\n&gt; online.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Pr=\r\neston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
