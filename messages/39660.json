I managed to get a hold of a comp with a dial up connection. \n*shudders*\n\nAnyway, SC:BW is definately one of the best RTS games our right now, \nbut I&#39;d have to say that it ties Emperor - Battle for Dune. That game \nROCKS! =) The best integration of 3d animation into a RTS game \naround. I  LIVE to see the worm explode from the sand to eat some of \nthe enemy units... or mine but still worth it!\n\nLOL -- Lurker, it is quite difficult for me to play on battle.net, \nnot because I have problems with the game, but because you won&#39;t find \nany games that I own that I&#39;ve bought. =P ANYTHING can be downloaded. \n=) I suggest you download Kahn.\n\nAlso, Lurker, I suggest that you hold your position for now with the \ncarriers and the new characters. I would also ask you to supply \ndetailed descriptions of base defenses, the abilities of the ships, \nand descriptions of the characters that you are bringing in. If the \ncouncil is going to discuss anything, we need to be present. =P And, \nmost, if not all, of the council is away.\n\nWHO IS KYLE STEWART?!? =) \n\n--- Lokk / Axis / Lynxiz ---\n\nLokk continues his barrage of bullets at Deemos firing the rest of \nhis clip. (20 bullets) He ducks behind the side of the mountain, and \nstarts to reload. &lt;Gotta  make them believe that the are surrounded \nand they are losing... commmon!&gt; He fumbles with his clip and drops \nit in his nervous haste. He picks up his clip and keeps reloading.\n\nAxis&#39;s charging laser keeps charging, almost at full power for anothe \nround of fire. He launches another missile at Stranato headed at the \nlast location he targeted. (meaning, he arc&#39;d the missile over the \npod and it is heading towards where the last missile he fired landed, \nwhich will most likely miss, just clarifying =P)\n\nLynxiz sprints around, just out of visible range, and sets Trinity \ndown. She starts to tend to Trinity&#39;s wounds.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Only the best f*cking RTS in the world! Starcraft!\n\n\n"}}
