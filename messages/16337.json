He seemed to remember something \nsimilar, something from the beginning of the Neo Beast Wars. Red creatures, \nyes, that was it, the red creatures created by his future self, and sent to \nkill eveyone else. They had had limited shape-shifting capabilities, and they \nwere also nearly undetecteble by radar. But the creatures were a thing of the \nVok, this ... thing didn&#39;t look like them.\n\n&quot;Hmm,&quot; Zardus says, entering the lab, &quot;Would you mind me running some tests \non you?&quot;\n\n(Dcoburn, if Sickle says yes, can you send me all the info you can on him? So \nI have material for Zardus to find out.)\n\n"}}
