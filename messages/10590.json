When they were done he&#39;d have a few words of\n&gt; encouragement for them.\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Logo in the future try not to take things so personally, if\n&gt; somethings said to one of the characters, then have the character\n&gt; handle it. (IE BA called DM a slut then make BA appologize (Unlikely\n&gt; if JP sticks to form) or start a grudge match btw the two.)\n&gt; And Soulstice, don&#39;t try so hard to defend yourself, even if you have\n&gt; something to defend yourself against. Whatever it is will pass faster\n&gt; if you keep little side comments quiet. (IE you used three posts to\n&gt; fight what Logo said just so Logo could find the post and show you\n&gt; otherwise.) I don&#39;t mean to single you out,  same goes to everyone\n&gt; playing. If they (I) can&#39;t take a little ribbing from another\n&gt; character then he/she/I shouldn&#39;t be playing. If we don&#39;t like whats\n&gt; said about one of our characters then there are other characters in\n&gt; the game to take those frustrations out on this is a war and we\n&gt; control this war. now lets stop blowing up at each other and get back\n&gt; to blowing up each others bots. I said my two cents, anyone else\n&gt; doesn&#39;t like it I got two characters to take it out on.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well, actually, you just have to make sure you attach it and it\n&gt; still is\n&gt; &gt; able to be moved.&quot; Land Mine said.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Would you like me to do it, KitKat?&quot; Land Mine asked...\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, August 06, 2000 9:25 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: NBW\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She looked at Land Mine . &quot;I can use all the help I can get.
