(If I was Prime, I would&#39;ve just fired away).  Due to earlier damage \nPrime died, passing the Matrix to Ultra Magnus.  Who later on was &#39;destroyed&#39; \nby Galvatron (Unicron found Megatron and a few other Decepticons who had been \nbadly beaten at Autobot City, and Starscream had discarded them into space, \nand they were remade, Galvatron is in fact Megatron) and he got the Matrix \nand tried to use it against Unicron, who swollowed him.  Hot Rod and Co. went \nto Junk (I&#39;m skipping a lot), and made peace, then smashed through Unicron&#39;s \neye with a Quintesson craft, then Hot Rod ended up with Galvatorn.  They \nfought, Hot Rod became Rodimus Prime THEN won.  The little scum bag &#39;killed&#39; \nUnicron.  Unfortunately though, at the end of this Ultra Magnus still lived.  \nThen that retard, Rodimus Prime declared it was the end of the Cybertronian \nWars.\n\n    Skipping ahead, Starscream&#39;s ghost made a bargain with Unicron, yaddi \nyaddi yadda, Starscream&#39;s new body was destroyed by Galvatron.  What happened \nto Unicron&#39;s head is unknown.  \n    \n    Skipping farther ahead, the Quintessons screw with a dead Optimus Prime&#39;s \nbody.  Rodimus and a few others are chased to the ship carrying the dead \nAutobots, Optimus Prime takes their craft (or something like that) and \nescapes.  Then he leads an attack on the Quints, it is really an ambush.  \nInner problems, yaddah yaddah yaddah.  He dies.  But later it turns out human \nscientists rescued him before the explosion, then he comes back and leads the \nAutobots for the rest of the seasons.  He didn&#39;t die in the last episode \nseries (at least in the American vers, I don&#39;t know about the others).  They \nwere called Rebirth, a five part episode.  He never died.  No one did as far \nas it told ( in Japanese version, Sixshot killed Ultra Magnus).  Optimus \nPrime lived.  I know.  I&#39;ve seen it over a dozen times, not to mention I \nbought the video from Videoflicks.com.  Anyway, just wanted that to tell you \nto get your facts straight.  Anyone want a more descriptive history, I&#39;d be \nhappy to comply.  (Natash person, e-mail Yanshosh and tell him, he&#39;ll help \nyou)  \n\n"}}
