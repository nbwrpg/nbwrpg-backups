I know this might not mean much to \nyou, but Soundwave and I believed in honor.  We wanted honor in the Con \nranks, but no one would listen.  That is why I gathered up some Decepticons, \nand made a elite group of honrable warriors.  All of them that is left, are \nwhat we are now calling the peace angels.  I retired from the war, and vowed \nnever to get into one again.  But soon i got a damage report from the Neo \nBeast wars and saw that my old friend had been massacred by the Alliance.  \nThe only reason i came out of  retirement was to strive for peace.  I dont \nwant to lose anymore friends.\n::he hoped that Vulois beleived him::\n\n"}}
