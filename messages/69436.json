Tucson had found many joys living upon\n&gt; the island, most of them finding artifacts that he had collected and tried\n&gt; hard to restore.  Yet they were only material objects, and if not for his\n&gt; enjoyment, for the enjoyment of others to look upon even after his wake.\n&gt;\n&gt; But he also knew that Lord Perseus was correct.  If they stayed any longer,\n&gt; it would harm the people.  He transforms out of his SUV mode and addresses\n&gt; Lord Perseus formally, as taught by his Autobot bretheren.  Being blind, he\n&gt; pauses for a moment to hear if anyone was around him, to be sure that he had\n&gt; not stepped on anyone when he transformed.  He then turns his head in Lord\n&gt; Perseus&#39;s direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Yes your highness, as an Autobot, I promised not only to protect but to\n&gt; serve faithfully.  I will be joining you. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He also realized that he had not formally introduced himself to his lord.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; My name is Tucson, and as I explained earlier, I&#39;m an Autobot, ready and\n&gt; willing to serve you faithfully.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The door to the tower opened and out stepped Lord Perseus, followed by\n&gt;&gt; Kenzo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Ok Maximals.

It had taken three weeks to clear the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rubble and begin rebuilding; the Maximal base however, was a total\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loss: only the lower level remained, which merely contained a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed ractor system and the prison cells, which concievably be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modified to be used by the loca police.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;So you&#39;ll be leaving us?&quot; asked the mayor, already knowing the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; answer.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yes. I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that our presence in the city\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merely aggrivates conditions. Without us, this island would become\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much lower priority for our enemies. Though I hope we can continue\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our research together; and I promise we will do anything we can to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; help the city.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;So where will you be going?&quot; the mayor asked after a moment of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; silence.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perseus walked to the windows and sighed.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We Maximals have been divided for too long.
