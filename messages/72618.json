Tracking was not his forte,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for now he would remain mostly quiet.  HE was along for muscle, after\n&gt;&gt; &gt; all.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Whereas VICE GRIP was an expert tracker of some ability, for the moment\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was not visible (and eprhaps unknown) just digging along over\n&gt;&gt; &gt; underground.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Along with DRILL BIT, a few dozen meters and tracking the TRANSFORMERS\n&gt;&gt; &gt; up\n&gt;&gt; &gt; above by their IFF signals through the dirt, going past heavy roots and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; vines underneath.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; And WASPINATOR, flying along in the air, went very, very slowly.  While\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was an agile and adept flier, the increasing undergrowth made him slow\n&gt;&gt; &gt; down\n&gt;&gt; &gt; heavily to avoid being bludgeoned.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; And so, as they found tracks, DINOBOT watched as the battle sight was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; analyzed by the MAXIMALS, waiting for further instructions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Well what have you got?&quot; INJECTOR, one of the FUZOR&#39;s said as he came\n&gt;&gt; walking up, his right hand, more of a stinger than hand, using it to\n&gt;&gt; brush his way through the underbrush.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; TERRORGATOR glanced over at him irritably, &quot;We have a second path.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;What is it, or who is it?&quot; SKYSHADOW said in a silky smooth, and yet\n&gt;&gt; still somehow dangerous voice as he walked up, causing both INJECTOR\n&gt;&gt; and TERORGATOR to straighten respectfully, or perhaps fearfully.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; CRYOTEK pulled out a small scanner and oriented it on the trail of the\n&gt;&gt; second path, &quot;Curious. It is the lubricant from a sweep, several of\n&gt;&gt; them.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
