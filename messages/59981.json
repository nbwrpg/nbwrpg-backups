He stood there, watching the energon-bloated jewel that was \n&gt; Earth. He zoomed his malevolent attention on the three \nCybertronian \n&gt; bases and decided that these were the objectives. A low roar arose \n&gt; as he began to speak. His voice would be transmitted all over the \n&gt; planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron: I claim this planet as mine. Any Transformer on it will \nbe \n&gt; destroyed unless they choose to become my servants. Also, if you \n&gt; part with the Matrix, I may spare your spark.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Transmission ended abruptly. The Chaos Bringer turned to his \n&gt; many Minions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron: We will attack in waves. Kill all you find, unless they \n&gt; offer their alliegeance. Sky-Eye, find Bloodblade.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first squad, the Flaming Eye of Morgoth (hint hint!), left on \n&gt; that instant for Predacon base. They were Firewhip, Klash, \n&gt; Crumblefish, Sky-Eye and the big Ragebomber. They would be there \n&gt; soon...\n\n\n"}}
