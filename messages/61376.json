This Hydras was a pompus moron.  But for \nnow they were allies.  Megatron returned to dismantling Sweeps, \nslicing them with his sword or blasting them in the face with his \nhead vulcans.  He was strafed suddenly, looking up he saw a gunship \nbearing down on Hydras and him.  He brought his cannon up and \nprepared to fire.\n&quot;It&#39;s over!&quot; he said, before firing.\nThe cannon fired a 35% blast, it shook the ground as Megatron \nrecoiled.  Splattercannon evaded the blast, but lost control and \ncrashed.  He transformed and started looking for his first victim.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNigmare/Darkfate/Nightstrike\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Agree&quot;said the femme while she flew towards the place and said by \n&gt; comlink (And just for minions)&quot;REmember that we have to destroy \nthat \n&gt; cannon...
