It may have even seemed\nfor a moment like he was about to balk at the whole idea, but finally\nhe shook his head, even as a steely resolution came across it.\n&quot;You&#39;re&#39;re right.&quot; Rodimus said at length. &quot;It is the only way.&quot;\n\nRodimus held out his hand to Perceptor to shake it, one comrade to\nanother. &quot;I have respect you old soldier.&quot; Rodimus said. &quot;However when\nwe next meet, it will be as enemies.&quot; Rodimus sighed, &quot;But I wish\nthere could have been a better choice, a different choice.&quot; Rodimus\nglanced at Perceptor&#39;s Predacon badge, and then back at Perceptor.\n\nAfter they shook hands Rodimus looked over at Tuscon, &quot;You know the\nway now, just go towards the surface. I will hold them off, and\nNightshift if he is willing!&quot;\n\nRodimus set his weapon to mid setting, &quot;RUN!&quot; he barked at Perceptor,\n&quot;RUN NOW!&quot; Rodimus took aim at perceptor as he prepared to pull the\ntrigger!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
