There were thermal readings that were fluxuating tha=\r\nt indicated movement.  He frowns at the thought of having to be ambushed.  =\r\nA low growl escapes his throat, and clenched fang like teeth become apparen=\r\nt on his face.  He was ready to fight if need be.\n\n&quot; Careful, not too fast,=\r\n everyone.  There is definitely movement of the sentient kind.&quot;\n\n--- In nbw=\r\nrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson listens with a deep intensity and closes his optics to allow=\r\n for\n&gt; &gt; better audio performance.  Sounds become sharper and easier to hea=\r\nr.  Being\n&gt; &gt; blind for nearly his entire existence further enhances his ab=\r\nility to\n&gt; &gt; compensate for not having his sense of sight.  Gently he place=\r\ns one palm on\n&gt; &gt; the wall, and then concentrates on what he feels on the b=\r\nottom of his feet\n&gt; &gt; and on the palms of his hands.  He takes a deep breat=\r\nh in to catch any scent\n&gt; &gt; that may seem different to the scents around hi=\r\nm.  And finally uses his\n&gt; &gt; sense of thermal  registering which is felt th=\r\nrough the nostrils of his\n&gt; &gt; somewhat draconic facial features.  It was ho=\r\nw a snake would detect it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; prey and the same held true for other repti=\r\nles.  He narrows an optic and\n&gt; &gt; speaks with a whisper.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Night Vi=\r\nper, wait.  Something doesn&#39;t feel right.  I&#39;m picking up\n&gt; &gt; vibrations th=\r\nrough the wall and my thermal imaging system is detecting an\n&gt; &gt; unknown en=\r\ntity.
