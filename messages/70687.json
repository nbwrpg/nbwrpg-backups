As they got closer they ground became steadilly more\nbroken and trecherous, obviously the victim of mining and perhaps cave\nins from underground tunnels. However Tankor and his drones led Hydras\nunerringly around any such real dangers, guiding them on course back\ntowards the city gates.\n\n&quot;Royalty&quot; Inferno said in low tones as he came up beside Hydras,\n&quot;There is no need to allow yourself to be taken into custody. I am\nsure with you here we could easily overpower these guys.&quot; Inferno&#39;s\noptics glowed brightly, it seemed he was eager to to do something.\n\n&quot;We don&#39;t have time for that now!&quot; Taratulus whispered fiercely to\nInferno, &quot;If we attack now, there&#39;s no telling what else could come\nout of the gates!&quot;\n\nInferno glanced at Taratulus and was about to say something when two\njets streaked over head with obvious Predacon signatures and marking.\nFrom the looks of it thay appeared to be going out for some sort of\npatrol.\n\nTowards the rear most of the other Predacons were ignoring Waspinator,\nas they usually did for ther most part, even Terrorsaur, who like most\nof the others whowere here seemed eager to do something, anything.\nPredacons were made to be warriors, and they were being hearded like\ncyber-sheep to the slaughter!\n\n(TAG)\n\nJets: http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/attachment.php?do=fullview&attachmentid=2190\nTankor & Drones:\nhttp://www.tfw2005.com/resources/attachment.php?do=fullview&attachmentid=2197\n\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
