Ya may not h=\r\near from me for a while, gotta keep a low profile.  Tell Tucson Prime I&#39;m d=\r\non&#39; the best I can.  If I run inta trouble, I&#39;ll send a silent distress bea=\r\ncon.  I promise, I won&#39;t bite off more than I can chew.  These guys ain&#39;t t=\r\nhe type ta fool around...  Especially Cyclonus, who has just found out that=\r\n Tucson just got a serious upgrade.

Night=\r\nstrike\n&gt; is not one of Hydras&#39; people, he is a minion, so he belongs to\n&gt; U=\r\nnicron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder shrugged sheepishly as he closed the communication and =\r\nlooked at\n&gt; Kup, &quot;I just thought he&#39;d want to know that.
