He reached out to intocate something but Iron Raptor only moved\n&gt;her arm so that he couldn&#39;t see past it and only could notice what was\n&gt;ahead.\n&gt;Iron Raptor heard/saw well just what Prowl was thinking the wondered if men\n&gt;could get any denser. (no offence to males.) By Prowl&#39;s opinion it was\n&gt;alright to meet eachother one day and basically be in bed together a few\n&gt;days later...which is basically what they did.\n&gt;He had rights to his thoughts and so did she, so she said nothing of it.\n&gt;Iron Raptor sighed when Prowl asked her the question she had been expecting\n&gt;since she had thought up those opinions on their relationship so far.\n&gt;And she wasn&#39;t afraid to be blunt about it.\n&gt;&lt; No, I don&#39;t.&gt;\n&gt;She openly regreated it. A mistake.\n&gt;She didn&#39;t regret the love expressed, just that it was too soon and she\n&gt;barely even knew him now. Besides, she could only read the parts of his \n&gt;mind\n&gt;that he decided to show her, and those were the parts he thought about.\n&gt;Iron Raptor glanced at Prowl.\n&gt;All she knew was his name and what his part in the Beast Wars was.\n&gt;She didn&#39;t know where he came from, though had a hunch that it was from\n&gt;Cybertron.\n&gt;She didn&#39;t know if he had any family, previouse lived, anything like that\n&gt;she knew exactly Zippo about.\n&gt;But he really didn&#39;t know her all that well either.\n&gt;Not where she came from, not what she was, nothing.\n&gt;It was time to get to work on those sorts of things.\n&gt;She did love him. Or what she thought she felt was love.\n&gt;Iron Raptor sighed inwardly.\n&gt;From a manufactoring date she was lass then 11 years old, and that was new\n&gt;for a prototype. But her mind was advanced not because it was programmed to\n&gt;but because she had learned in a very quick amount of time, and so had a\n&gt;mature view of life from day 1.\n&gt;But there was still so much to learn, like the emotions she was surrounded\n&gt;by every day and ones which clouded her mind all too often. So she wanted \n&gt;to\n&gt;go slow, to get every detale, even in matters like love.\n&gt;And that&#39;s part of why that day was a mistake.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
