He frowned.\n\n&quot;No, I don&#39;t recognize him. One second, I&#39;ll check my logs.&quot; Cyndro\nsaid and the screen blanked out for a second, then Cyndro&#39;s face\nappeared again.\n\n&quot;I have it recorded that he arrived just a little while ago. The\nCybertronian Fire, which was the old base, doesn&#39;t have any logs on\nhim either.&quot; Cyndro reported and then glanced at Waterworm. &quot;I think\nhe&#39;s new here.&quot;\n\nHe then looked back at AzureBlade and Hugar. &quot;Iron Raptor and most of\nthe other Maximals are training right now,&quot; he told them, &quot;but I can\nescort you inside into a waiting room and notify her.&quot;\n\n\nCinder and Mist arrived at the exit to Maximal City and looked out at\nthe bots outside. They saw that a monitor was talking to them, and\nknew that Cyndro had things under control.\n\n\nTruttle nodded at Cledar&#39;s orders and remained by Rixer. He held his\ntwo machine guns ready just in case Iron Raptor decided to attack\nthem where they were.\n\n\nMantle, Aqua, and Rubble watched all the Maximals go into action to\nhunt down IR, and Aqua and Rubble looked at Mantle.\n\n&quot;Any special plans?&quot; Rubble asked. Mantle looked around and frowned.\n\n&quot;Not yet. Lets go that way and stick together. If we see her, me and\nAqua will combine and chase after her.&quot; Was Mantle&#39;s reply to the\nquestion after several seconds of thinking it over, and the three set\noff down a hallway.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
