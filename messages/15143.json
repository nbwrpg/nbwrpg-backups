She tried to stand, but fell back down. She\n&gt; wondered why on Cybertron she had the inclination to jumo from the\n&gt; ship.  She perked her ears up and hear the squablling of the other\n&gt; bots.  They were fighting for leadership.  She sighed and new that in\n&gt; her state, she couldn&#39;t challange for leadership.  And she needed\n&gt; help. Her body wasn&#39;t going to hold out without a CR.  She tried to\n&gt; stand agains and finally stood on her legs. She wasn&#39;t going to stay\n&gt; around let watch them get killed.  She walked over to Atma and the\n&gt; others.  She growled loudly, snapped and bared her teeth.  She raised\n&gt; the hair on her back and snarled. &quot;NOW listen to me.  If you want to\n&gt; lead this pack, you will have to fight me.  I have tried to save your\n&gt; pelts over and over again.  Phobia saved us this last time. And I am\n&gt; grateful to him.  But now is not the time to fight amonst ourselves.\n&gt; We need to stick together and get ourselves a plan.  Now I have a\n&gt; plan if you want to hear it. If not. then walk.  I&#39;m going to go and\n&gt; kill those blasted maximals.  But not this minute.&quot; she coughed and\n&gt; fell to the ground.  She looked up, still growling. &quot;Now you can\n&gt; fight me now, or walk away. Or you can stay and we can kill\n&gt; those, &quot;coughs,&quot;maximals for all they did to us. Revenge, &quot; she\n&gt; coughed and shook from the pain,&quot; REVENGE! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She could barely hold her head up. But she hoped she was able to keep\n&gt; them together for a little while longer.   She knew that even with\n&gt; only the five of them, they could attack and hurt them as baddly as\n&gt; they had been hurt.  She lowered her head and groaned.  She didn&#39;t\n&gt; care if they killed her any more.  But she still flet a sence of\n&gt; loyalty to them.  She trembled and coughed. Her chest hurt and she\n&gt; whined a bit.  She closed her eyes and hope the pain would stop.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
