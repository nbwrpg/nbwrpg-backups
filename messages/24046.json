He had noticed that Prebon&#39;s \ncomment about falure had been directed at him, and he was getting \nslightly tired of the way Prebon treated his troops. Slayer was loyal \nto the end due to his programming, but his personality didn&#39;t really \nallow him to like anyone, even the leader he was programmed to serve.\n\nSlayer stands still. He didn&#39;t have any questions.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; All the Trainers were now in Prebons office. Prebon stood with his \n&gt; back to his troops watching the flashing battle on his scanners. he \n&gt; pressed a green button on the console and a 3d view came up on \n&gt; screen. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It would seem that the Alliance has had the same idea that I \nthought \n&gt; of.&quot; He steps a little closer to the screen, &quot;A large concentration \n&gt; of Maximals have gathered at the Cybertronian Fire. Since they were \n&gt; at a strategic disadvantage I was going to have you attack them, It \n&gt; would seem that the Alliance also saw the advantage and took \naction.&quot; \n&gt; he looks at Slayer, &quot;This is a chance for all of you to make amends \n&gt; for the pathetic attack on the Ark.&quot; The comment was directed at \n&gt; Slayer but everybody had made mistakes during that attack. &quot;I want \nmy \n&gt; orders followed exactly when I order it, not later, there will be \nno \n&gt; excuses for failure. Am I understood?&quot; Prebon stared across his \nline \n&gt; of troops, Bullet, Ignatius, Blaze, Hammer, and Slayer all stood in \na \n&gt; line before him. &quot;Are there any Questions?&quot; Prebon wasn&#39;t really \n&gt; interested in questions, he was just wondering who&#39;d be the first \nto \n&gt; question him.\n\n\n"}}
