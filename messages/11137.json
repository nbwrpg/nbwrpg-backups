No, we need another way. \nSomething that wouldn&#39;t give us away in any shape or fashion.&quot;\nShe smiled at Drillbit. &quot;It was a good idea.  Say, Keep that idea in \nmind.  It may be useful yet, but not right now.  Like, you could \nprogram the virus to destroy instead of copy.  We may have a need for \nthat stuff yet.

Back on Cybertron, I developed a virus. It is like \nenergon,\n&gt; but when it runs through a computer powering it, it makes a copy of \nthe\n&gt; data. All we would have to do is dump the energon on there shields. \nI\n&gt; can develop a liquid kind, witch someone can fly over, above there\n&gt; weopons lock, and drop it on the shields.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
