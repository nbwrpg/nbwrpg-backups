It made her think of Rodimus and what could possibly be =\r\nhappening to him.  A gloomy expression is cast upon her face.\n\n&quot; Dinobot ch=\r\nose ta go back to being a Predacon.  It&#39;s so much easier being a bad guy th=\r\nese days than it is ta be a Maximal.  It&#39;s an easy way out.  That&#39;s why Rod=\r\nimus gave into that dark side of himself, it&#39;s an easy way out of dealing w=\r\nith his own personal demons.  Maybe there isn&#39;t anything we can do ta snap =\r\nhim out of that, because it was his choice ta turn on us.   Maybe all this =\r\ntime he really never wanted anything ta do with the responsibility of the M=\r\natrix, and let himself get corrupted, just like Dinobot did.  Oh sure, the =\r\nupgrades are impressive but they never stand up for what really matters.  A=\r\nnd I feel sorry for you guys because what you have will never outshine the =\r\nmost important power of all.  One so simple and one that we all share, and =\r\none that can only be found deep within all of our sparks.  Tucson said it b=\r\nest, &quot; You don&#39;t need fancy upgrades to be powerful, all you need is right =\r\nthere, inside you.  Just look deep into your spark and you&#39;ll find it.&quot;\n\nSh=\r\ne smiles as she puts a gentile paw on Airhammer&#39;s chest.\n\n&quot; Nothing will ev=\r\ner defeat what&#39;s in here, nothing.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cy=\r\nclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rattrap glares at Din=\r\nobot.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Okay, so bad stuff happened a long time ago!  I admit I mes=\r\nsed up!  But\n&gt; &gt; for the sake of Primus, can we put this behind us and just=\r\n move on!?\n&gt; &gt; Tucson&#39;s out there with Optimus Primal, Cheetor, Rodimus and=\r\n now Nightlight!\n&gt; &gt;  Every astrosecond we waste here is one less we have t=\r\na find them and get\n&gt; &gt; &#39;em back safely!  And you got Cyclonus&#39;n Scourge ta=\r\n worry about too!  So\n&gt; &gt; let&#39;s try and work together here and actually acc=\r\nomplish something!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Look, Dinobot, he=\r\n&#39;s right, our comrades need us more than ever and we\n&gt; &gt; really can&#39;t affor=\r\nd ta let them down.  Magmatron is out there and unless we\n&gt; &gt; put our diffe=\r\nrences aside, like Tucson was attempting to achieve with all of\n&gt; &gt; us, we =\r\nmight as well hand the planet over to that monster and head for the\n&gt; &gt; hil=\r\nls.  None of us want that, we work too hard to defend what little\n&gt; &gt; terri=\r\ntory we have.  Let&#39;s keep it that way. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She stands up on Quickstri=\r\nde&#39;s rump, on her hind legs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Tucson started this because he belie=\r\nves that unity is our best weapon\n&gt; &gt; against a formidable foe such as Magm=\r\natron.  If we fought separately, none\n&gt; &gt; of us would survive his onslaught=\r\n.  He did this for ALL of us.  He didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; have to but he did, and it wou=\r\nld be a real slap in the face for him if we\n&gt; &gt; let it fall apart now.  Ple=\r\nase, we gotta try ta work together, because if we\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t, we could end u=\r\np being the losers.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a watchful smile from AIRHAMM=\r\nER as he watched the\n&gt; conversation go back and forth. He is not the long w=\r\ninded sort, and so\n&gt; stays largely quiet in all of this.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ahh yes, you=\r\n were a Maximal at one time weren&#39;t you?&quot; BANTOR said to\n&gt; the new and impr=\r\noved DINOBOT, &quot;First Predacon, then Maximal and now\n&gt; Predacon again?&quot; He s=\r\naid as he tilted his head in DINBOT&#39;s direction.\n&gt; &quot;You seemed to have had =\r\nan upgrade or two.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; BANTOR gestured at DINOBOT&#39;s frame, &quot;You look more=\r\n like the old\n&gt; Megatron now, before he went all draconish.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile=\r\n on the otherside of the clearing SKYSHADOW was still looking\n&gt; at HYDRAS a=\r\nwaiting his next words and LEO was standing towards the\n&gt; middle of the cle=\r\naring, a growing sense of agitation.\n&gt; \n&gt; WINGCALIBER, TORCA and SANTON wer=\r\ne standing next to him, waiting on\n&gt; the small sidebar conference to end wh=\r\nile NOCTORRO was pacing around,\n&gt; obviously letting his own sense of impati=\r\nence get the better of him.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
