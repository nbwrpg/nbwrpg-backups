I know things\n&gt; aren&#39;t so good now and it can get to you.  But understand that\n&gt; someday, things will be different.  I&#39;m not sure how or when.  But it\n&gt; will.  You just worry about staying alive and unharmed.  I&#39;l look out\n&gt; for the rest.&quot; She smiled at Land Mine. &quot;OK?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
