She looked at \n&gt; them. &quot;Ah, Feline. I was just talking about you with another bot. \nHow \n&gt; are you feeling?&quot; she said in a cheerful and warm voice.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feline2::\n&gt; She looked up at Squizzy. She didn&#39;t feel threatened by Squizzy, \nfor \n&gt; she was short and didn&#39;t look to be a fighter at all. Plus the fact \n&gt; that Squizzy was the one who brought her back as it were. She \n&gt; shurgged her shoulders. &quot;Eh, I&#39;m ok.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s excelent. Oh, by the way and while I&#39;m thinging about it. I \n&gt; have a new program to install in you. I found it and it&#39;s of your \nold \n&gt; memories. Plus it has a few minor upgrades that your old body \ndoesn&#39;t \n&gt; have. Like a spark protection system. If you have the time, I can \n&gt; install it for you and you&#39;ll be out of here in a just a half hour. \n&gt; It won&#39;t take long at all. Would you please have a seat on the \n&gt; biotable and I&#39;ll get started right away.&quot;\n&gt; She looked at Repressor. &quot;This won&#39;t take long at all. If you want, \n&gt; you can have a seat right here or wait outside.&quot; she said \ncheerfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feline2::\n&gt; She walked over and jumped up onto the table.\n&gt; \n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; &quot;Feline, would you transform into bot mode. It will make it easier \nto \n&gt; get this uploaded and faster as well.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Feline2::\n&gt; She transformed into bot mode and waited:\n&gt; \n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; She walked over to the console and pushed a fe buttons. Then she \n&gt; walked over to Feline and pulled a cable out of the table an hooked \n&gt; it up to Feline&#39;s neural net hook up.  &quot;Now don&#39;t worry about a \n&gt; thing. You&#39;ll be out of here before you know it.&quot;\n&gt; She walked over and looked at the console. She brought up the \n&gt; programs that FZ had given here. She looked at Feline,&quot;Lay down and \n&gt; relax.&quot; She watched as Feline lay down on the table, then started \nto \n&gt; upload the predacon program.  While this was uploading, she walked \n&gt; over to Feline, with a seringe in her hand and injected Feline with \na \n&gt; drug that would keep her asleep for several hours.  She then walked \n&gt; over to Repressor. &quot;Tell Zardus that I&#39;ll take care of Feline as \n&gt; ordered.&quot;  She went back and checked her console. The pred program \n&gt; was now 40% uploaded. When the prossess was complete, Feline would \nbe \n&gt; the promiscuos, bold, and deadly bot she once was.  And even more \n&gt; loyal to Zardus than before.\n\n\n"}}
