Her optics not focusing right away.\n&quot;Oh, what happened?&quot;\nAs her otpics focused, she realized that she was upsidedown on the ground. \nHer back up against a large tree and her talons were up in the air.\n&quot;Oh how do I get into these situations I&#39;ll never know.&quot;\nShe turned and dropped to her side. She saw that her wing was damaged.  It \nhad a nasty looking tear and was cut in a few places.  Her body was \nscratched up a bit.  And her head hurt from landing on it. She stood up and \ntried to stretch her other wing. It moved but was very stiff.  She looked \naround and saw the trees were sindged or leveled from the blast.\nTHE BLAST!\n&quot;Oh boy, I got to get back to the Arc. I hope the others survived that \nblast. Shadow Wing Maximize!&quot;\n\nShe transformed into bot mode and walked back to the Arc.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
