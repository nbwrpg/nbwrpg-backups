I think Primal is BIGG=\r\nER&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So here is a size scale that I might be inclin=\r\ned to use:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://tfwiki.net/w2/images2/6/67/ROTF_A=\r\nutobot_scale_guide_1.jpg&quot;&gt;http://tfwiki.net/w2/images2/6/67/ROTF_Autobot_sc=\r\nale_guide_1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is based on the ROTF so I =\r\nthink it will work. This way we can range&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; anywhere from about =\r\nhuman sized for some of the really small Maximals&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and Predacon=\r\ns to the really large.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My question is: What do yo=\r\nu guys think? Do you think this could be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; something that would =\r\nwork for your own character concepts?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are d=\r\nifferences between Autobots and Maximals as Maximals (and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dece=\r\npticons and Predacons) generally the Maximals (and Predacons) are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; smaller (although not always) and generally do not size change much&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; and are more energy efficient.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please l=\r\net me know your ideas. I would like to know how you feel since&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n this is as much your world as it is mine.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Pres=\r\nton&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end gr=\r\noup email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-1B7DD48E-A9E5-461F-A927-C15DB322ADBF--\r\n\n"}}
