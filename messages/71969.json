Thousands of\nacres a=\r\nll around with trees reaching up over one hundred feet into the\nair like ta=\r\nll green spires reaching ever higher into the skies,\nsupported by thick pow=\r\nerful trunks and supporting power of the\nneighboring trees.\n\nAt first trave=\r\nl was easy as WHEELIE followed a trail of devastation\nand deforestation. It=\r\n was as if a stampede of hundreds of large\nanimals fled the jungle, crashin=\r\ng into trees and stripping foliage as\nthey traveled. The result of which wa=\r\ns a wide open and relatively\nsmooth open path of travel several miles into =\r\nthe immense wooded area.\nBut as time passed and the miles built upon themse=\r\nlves the impact of\nthe animal&#39;s passing become less and less noticeable, th=\r\ne area itself\nbecoming ever darker from the trees high over head and the th=\r\nick\ngrowth of brush. The ground was becoming more and more uneven as tree\nr=\r\noots grew into the pathway. What was once a brightly lit area was now\nmuch =\r\ndarker, looking like deep evening, even though the noonday sun\nburned brigh=\r\ntly over head, blocked by thge lush canopy of trees, that\nonly occasionally=\r\n let in shafts of sunlight light to break open the\ngrowing darkness.\n\nEven =\r\nthe smell of things was beginning to change. The earth smell of\ndecomposing=\r\n leaves and animal waste could be smelled. Not necessarily\na bad smell, but=\r\n one that reminded you of the richness of the soil\nthat was being moved acr=\r\noss.\n\nWHEELIE employing all the skills and experience at his disposal was\na=\r\nble to make his way in through the uneven and sometimes broken\nground, the =\r\njungle floor was perhaps among the most inhospitable to\nwheeled vehicles th=\r\nat most of the Earth at this time had to offer.\nLattice works of roots and =\r\nfoliage got caught in tires, the brush\nhaving the annoying habit of blockin=\r\ng sight and hiding nasty ravines\nand holes and twisted turns. Branches and =\r\nroots jutted out at strange\nangles threatening to stab into more sensative =\r\nand vulnerable\nundersides and tires.\n\nThe sounds of the jungle was all arou=\r\nnd WHEELIE, animals chattered at\nhim from the ground, as others hanging hig=\r\nh in the trees looked down\nat the strange orange conveyance that dared trav=\r\nel through demesne.\nThere were signs of life all around him - The catcalls =\r\nof other\nanimals, even a few roars in the distance of large predatory beast=\r\ns.\nTrees and branches moved strangely as if something indiscernible was\nmov=\r\ning among them even if the author of the movement could not itself\nbe readi=\r\nly seen.\n\nThen there was the eerie feeling of being watched. It was a feeli=\r\nng\nthat settled upon someone slowly at first. Perhaps a sound that didn=92t=\r\n\nrepeat itself or a movement than stopped when you did. Maybe it was\njust a=\r\n gut feeling that somewhere out in the density of the foliage,\nin the darke=\r\nst shadows something was out there, and it was peering at\nyou, considering =\r\nyou.\n\nIt was into this maze of tree and wood, sounds and smells that WHEELI=\r\nE\nwas driving, covered in muck and weaving past trees that were as large\nar=\r\nound as he was long. And yet despite all of that, there was a\nstrange sort =\r\nof barely discernable path that led further and further\ninto the jungle int=\r\nerior, meandering at times and yet always present.\n.\n\nOOC: For anyone that =\r\nwants to fly in, you will find that you cannot\nsee the jungle floor, at lea=\r\nst the section that Wheelie is in. You can\nsee the devastation that he foll=\r\nowed in, but after a few miles it\nfades and the jungle growth takes over. A=\r\nny smells or sounds he would\ngive off would be muffled by the dense foliage=\r\n and the ambient sounds\nand smells of the jungle. In short he would be near=\r\nly impossible to\nfind anyone on the forest floor from the air unless you fi=\r\nnd one of\nthe infrequent clearings. If you need a more aerial description o=\r\nf the\nplace I can describe that in a different post. Just let me know\n\n(TAG=\r\n)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
