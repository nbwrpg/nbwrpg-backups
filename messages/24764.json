It would give him room to try out this \nnew body. His robot mode was unfinished. On his way here he picked up a \nsignal from one with a powerful spark signature. It was Magnus. He would \nregonize him anywhere. He would deal with them later.\n Apocalypse landed close behind as did death. They looked over the bot. His \nrobot mode was pure silverish color. Very smooth. He had a silver tail with a \nsharp pointed cone at the end of it.His dragon ribs where exposed across his \nstomach. His chest had a green gem in the center of it. His red dragon head \nlayed agaisnt his back. His silver wings where not expanded and grew more \ntense. There where no visible weapons on him. But he doubted that that was \nthe case. or maybe he had yet to get all the DNA he needed.....\n\n"}}
