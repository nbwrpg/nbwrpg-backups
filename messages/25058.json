She might have to call upon her guns soon and that\n&gt; called for a transformation. Though she was more eager to get home then\n&gt; fight it out with Instrat.\n&gt; Carnage glanced over her shoulder towards Teltoli and flashed her a look\n&gt; which spoke that it wasn&#39;t wise to act too haisty, they had plenty of time\n&gt; to beat this bot if it came down to it.\n&gt; She then turned her head back only to find herself nose to snout with\n&gt; Instrat, growing and jerking her head back in irder to focus on her face\n&gt; properly. Once that was done Carnage growled at Instrat, her teeth inches\n&gt; away from the fems face, her body not even moving an inch from where it\nhad\n&gt; originally been.**\n&gt; &quot; Just hold on here! If you would care to notice that life isn&#39;t perfect\nand\n&gt; no one is perfect either.&quot;\n&gt; ** Carnage pointed a claw tipped finger towards Instrat.**\n&gt; &quot; As I recall a sertain female who was suddenly about to whack my head off\n&gt; in a clearing back there just because I was trying to get dinner. Then you\n&gt; realized your mistake. MISTAKE!\n&gt; Even YOU make mistakes, just like Teltoli had. So you see, no ones\nperfect,\n&gt; including me.&quot;\n&gt; ** Carnage growled and moved towards the pigs on the ground, throwing them\n&gt; onto her back before moving around Instrat with a growl.**\n&gt; &quot; Come on Teltoli, we gotta get home.&quot;\n&gt; ** She would leave their guest to the storm.**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
