Her instincts told \nher to be careful.  She took the drink and sniffed it. &quot;Hmm, seems to \nbe delicious. However, it&#39;s hardly fair for me to have two drinks \nwhen you&#39;ve only had one. Fix one of these for yourself and we&#39;ll \nkeep going with this little game.  No fair that the bartender has an \nunfair advantage.&quot; She grinned at him with her usual charming wolfish \ngrin. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice was a little hurt.  One of his most potent drinks flopped.  \nAs far as he knew, no Maximal or Predacon could handle the energy \nwaveform.  It was just not feasible.  Perhaps systems could be \nadjusted to tolerate just a little more, but this was ridicules.  He \ncould out drink any Seeker, Wrecker, Gestalt, Triplechanger, and even \nSupreme Commander.  This wasn&#39;t right.\n&gt; Then it hit him.\n&gt; &lt;She might be hiding the problems that stuff is causing her.  That \nexplains the optic color.  If so, then I&#39;ll catch her in the act.  \nHmp, she should be an actress on Broadway or something.&gt;\n&gt; As he dove into a series of spare part compartments and drew from \nthe liquors, he began to create a second energy format.  As he mixed \na new drink in a new glass, he secretly added extra energy and \nmanipulated it into this secondary waveform.  It did not affect the \ncolor, taste, smell, or texture, but it would cause a specific \nproblem.  This attempt, was aimed at her thermal regulator.  In her \ncurrent state, she would seek more than liquid refreshment.  Sure it \nwas a cruel joke, but at least it wasn&#39;t going to harm her.  She \ncould just run a diagnostic cycle on her systems and the problem \nwould cease to be.  With a big smirk, he served his worthy opponant \nthe new cocktail.\n&gt; &quot;See if this razes your regulators.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She took the glass and sniffed it. &quot;Hmm, smells delightful.&quot;  She \n&gt; downed it and grinned. Her optics flashed and glowed brightly for a \n&gt; moment and then returned to normal. &quot;Hmm, not bad at all.&quot;  She \n&gt; smiled and remained sitting in a proper fashion.  What she wasn&#39;t \n&gt; going to do was give him the satisfaction of knowing the that the \n&gt; drink overpowered some of her systems enough so that she couldn&#39;t \n&gt; stand up. As long as she remained sitting for a bit untill her \n&gt; systems returned to normal, she could pull it off. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am Des Wraith, the Archfiend of Flames.  I have slaughtered \nthousands of demons who opposed me and will keep doing so.
