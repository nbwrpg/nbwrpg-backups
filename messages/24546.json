It took alot more than a tackle to take down a bot\n&gt; as large as Killfest. A shot nearly hits Killfest&#39;s head, but misses\n&gt; by an inch.\n&gt;\n&gt; Killfest grabbs Aerostreak with one large hand, slamming the bot down\n&gt; onto his knee and the pointed spike on it.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Greven laughs as shots pummell his armor, denting it. He aims his\n&gt; missile launchers, sending out two from each launcher at Nighteyes.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; (Please remember the shot limits, JP)\n&gt;\n&gt; EndBringer fires two missiles at the incoming missiles, managing to\n&gt; take five of them out. The remaining three hit him in the chest,\n&gt; sending him flying backwards. He roars and jumps up, firing two\n&gt; missiles from each launcher at Tarantulus.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scyther rolls in the air, avoiding several shots. One of them hits\n&gt; him in the side, but does little damage.\n&gt;\n&gt; Flipping out his charge launcher, he fires off three charges down at\n&gt; Akron, some hitting the trees and setting them on fire, others\n&gt; passing through the canopy toward Akron.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DrillBit swears as he&#39;s sent flying backwards by an energon bolt. He\n&gt; returns fire with his gatling gun.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; A shot hits right in front of Dollen, charring the bushes. He fires\n&gt; back with a charge.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; A shadow passes over the fighting bots as a five-headed dragon flies\n&gt; over the battlefield.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I have arrived,&quot; Darkfate says to Killfest over the comm as he\n&gt; breathes fire over the enemies.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;     Tarantulas, in his vhicle mode, flew off his tires as al lthe\n&gt; shots aimed\n&gt; &gt; at him impacted. He gathered his thought, and sent a batch of eight\n&gt; cluster\n&gt; &gt; missles at EndBringer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Tankkor growled as he was pelted with blasts. He turned and\n&gt; sent his mian\n&gt; &gt; laser turret blast at Killfest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Nighteyes covered her head, and with a bleeding hand, began to\n&gt; unload on\n&gt; &gt; Greven.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Aerostreak dove into Killfest, sending them both skidding\n&gt; across the\n&gt; &gt; forest floor. (Hope you dont take that as a mode, sorry if you do.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Akron pickes her target. She see&#39;s Darkmouse and Scather,\n&gt; (Well, dosent\n&gt; &gt; actually see Scather) and sends several Energon bolt blasts at them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Putnam spots Golden eyes, and takes off into the air. He\n&gt; extends his\n&gt; &gt; hands and manages to grab hold of her leg, and begins to drain some\n&gt; energy\n&gt; &gt; out of her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Odiphious takes his riffle out and fires at Drillbit, and then\n&gt; sends an\n&gt; &gt; energon bolt at him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Venus, armed with an energon pistol, fires at Dollen. She is\n&gt; stil lsore\n&gt; &gt; from a hit she took in the shoulder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Megatron turns to Megaton. &quot;Come on, Megaton, Marine, Pheniox,\n&gt; Jackle,\n&gt; &gt; and Gremlin. Youre all coming with me to help out in the forest.\n&gt; Lets go.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;     Megatron was finally going to strech his legs after beening\n&gt; cooped up in\n&gt; &gt; the ice cave for so long.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
