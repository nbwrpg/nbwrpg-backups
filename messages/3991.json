He has already learend that it will give you a 3rd \ntransformation. If you can already fly than you will get a tank mode. \nIf you can&#39;t fly you will receive a jet mode. He checks the wiring, \nand it turns out it will double the strength of your weapons, double \nyour speed and somewhat increase your ability to defend. Vulois can \nnot wait until Soundwave shows up with the equipment. Everyone will \nbe surprised....\n\n\n"}}
