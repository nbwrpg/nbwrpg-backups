Shots ricochet off his armor as he gained speed in his \nattempt to keep up with Fenox. out of the corner of his optics he saw \ncharges coming his way. the first of which caught him off gaurd \nexploding and forceing him to change direction.he grabbed the second \none and redirected it down at Astral. the third one scored a solid \nhit causing a rupture in the back of his armor. he aimed his \nconstrictor rifle up at Starlight and fired a beam that would knock \nthe target out of the fight.\n\n&quot;You fools are nothing more than a design flaw, I am the advanced \nmodel on this world.&quot; He yells as the chase continued.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Astral/Fenox/Starlight/Recklessa::\n&gt; \n&gt; Astral growls, firing two dozen more shots at Prebon. &quot;Yes, and \nyour \n&gt; troops fell rather quickly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He believed his troops were doing fine.
