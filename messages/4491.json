DeathStorm stumbles back as a shot hits him in the \nchest, sending him slamming backwards into the panel.\n\nWith extroadanary speed, DeathStorm pulls out the black device he had made in \nhis ship, the device releasing a beam of energy at Zardus. Zardus yells as he \nis forced back into his beast mode.\n\nDeathStorm laughs. &quot;How do you like it, &#39;leader&#39;? Transformation block. My \nown design.&quot;\n\nDeathStorm lifts his gun, pointing it at Zardus.\n\n"}}
