Megatron then emerges\nfrom a bush behind him, screaming with rage, and lock Motormaster from\nbehind. Motormaster strugles, but cannot break Megatron&#39;s grip, he then\nelbows Megatron in the head. Megatron decides to grab between his legs, and\nhoist Motormaster up over his head, and throws him straight up in the air.\nMotormaster screams, as he starts to head towards the ground at a high\nspeed. Making hard impact with the ground, Motormaster then rolls over, and\nsees he is on the edge of a cliff, looking down at the Hudson bay. At the\nbottom of the cliff, and a bit off, is the Decepticons ship. He gets up and\nreadies himself for Megatron.\n\n\n\n"}}
