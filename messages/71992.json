If anything, Tucson would rely on ground\n&gt; tracking to find Wheelie.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Most likely his field track&#39;n tactics.  That means he&#39;s gonna land at the\n&gt; area and attempt ta follow Wheelie on foot.  He knows how ta identify a bot\n&gt; just by foot and tire tracks alone. One more thing, he&#39;s got sharp senses\n&gt; and he was promised he&#39;d be able ta go it alone.  Get downwind of him and he\n&gt; won&#39;t be too happy.  Even I know better then ta mess with him.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere is a dismissive grunt from POLAR CLAW as he looked back over the\ninformation on his PADD. He may not be as large as TUSCON, from the\nway he carried himself he looked well able to carry his own load in a\nbattle.\n\nHe looked over at RAMULUS and then WOLFGANG, both of whom look really\ncomfortable taking orders from him as if they both have served under\nhim for a while. With a jerk of his head he sent them both into the\nshuttle, leaving PROWL and POLAR CLAW outside.\n\nPROWL stood looking at NIGHTSHIFT, his head tilting curiously at him.\n&quot;Do you normally fear your commander so much that you would obey a\ncommand that may get him into trouble?&quot;\n\nA grunt from POLAR CLAW, &quot;If you wish to be left behind speak up or\ngear up.&quot; He jerked a finger at the shuttle.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
