His systems went into \n&gt; defense and ran towards them. He could smell a few bots and even \n&gt; firepower that had resently been fired, despite his poor sense of \n&gt; smell. He found the room where the noise was, discovering that a \n&gt; scuffle was the focus. He saw the three bots he saw in the bridge \n&gt; before, Black Arachnia lying on the floor, and Tarantulas. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;T?&quot; he said, wide-eyed. He looked around. He walked towards Black \n&gt; Arachnia to aid her. &quot;What in tarnation happpened?&quot; he asked, \n&gt; watching Tarantulas.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
