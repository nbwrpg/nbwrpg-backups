They all said you were moding because \nyou do not know about the driver. My team still has it.)\n\nVulois sits in the rafters, and hears Hell Beast&#39;s response. He sends \na message to Battera and Soundwave.\n\n&quot;All right, this is what I want you to do. Turn Battera into a TM3, \nand then hurry down to the Pred base with the driver. It seems we&#39;ve \nmade a breakthrough. Hell Beast is listening to us. I&#39;ll see you all \nat the Pred base.&quot;\n\nVulois drops down as all the other Predacons stare at him in disgust. \nHe walks with Hell Beast to his study, and tells him his offer.\n\n&quot;All right, Hell Beast. Basically my team and I want to go home. \nWe&#39;re tired of the war. So we want a deal. The three of us are named \nyour &quot;joint council&quot; so to speak. Your advisers. Your seconds in \ncommand. We basically deliver your messages and are in charge while \nyou are away. With this title we will, with a little Predacon techno \nhelp, be able to turn the next pod that crashes into a suitable ship \nfor 3. We would construct this on our own time, as to not interfere \nwith your plans. In return, we will return this mind-whiping device \nto you and give you the secret of Transmetal 3 technology. You could \nturn all the Preds into it and then have a stronger army than the \nMaximals. When the three of us leave, we will not ask for the driver \nback. It will be yours to keep. If you are looking for another \nadvantage point, than say we reach Cybertron. We can tell them of \nthe &quot;noble and coragiuos&quot; acts that Hell Beast has done in the Neo \nBeast Wars, in the name of Predacons everywhere. This may spur those \nPreds on and make them fight harder, maybe even making it easier for \nyou to conquer Cybertron when this is done. What do you say?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
