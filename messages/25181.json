I was just going with my own storylines, I wasn&#39;t \ntrying\n&gt; to make everyone cease fire or anything like that. Technosis wasn&#39;t\n&gt; important to anyone, I thought, but Chordate is such a powerful \nfigure, that\n&gt; it&#39;s easy to cause havoc by doing something like that. Understand \nnow?\n&gt; Deemos taking Technosis captive didn&#39;t insure a victory for the \nCHosen Ones,\n&gt; he just wanted to leave there with Technosis, no problem. If the \nAlliance\n&gt; left with Chordate, would there be a problem with that? If so, then \nwe have\n&gt; the hostage crisis all over again, except that unitron will \nprobably fool\n&gt; everyone into going to the Alliance base and stuff to kill them \nall. And if\n&gt; there wouldn&#39;t be a problem. Well, Chordate will die. Tarantopulous \nisn&#39;t\n&gt; about to give up something he believes in, so he keeps firing. \nCHordate\n&gt; means nothing to him.
