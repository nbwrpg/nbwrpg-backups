That doesn&#39;t \ndepend on the strength of the opponent, so it&#39;s legal. But twisting someone&#39;s \narms would depend on the other bot&#39;s strengh, so you&#39;d need to wait for him \nto respond.\n\n::Zardus/Perndabot/Reptilica/Bloodystrike::\n\nZardus spins around, looking at Cyber Claw. He looks from her to Oblitertron \nand the conflict on the ground, an annoyed look on his face.\n\n&quot;Wait,&quot; he says to Cyber Claw and proceeds to fly down toward the conflict, \nhis gun ready.\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; he says to the bots near the Ark, &quot;Maximals, lower your weapons. \nOblitertron, stand down. The next bot to fire a shot dies.&quot;\n\nZardus scans the bots in front of him, gun ready just in case.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot walks up near Zardus, his gun also ready. The huge bot looks \nthreateningly at the maximals, ready to open fire.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica and Bloodystrike return to the alliance base, dropping off the \nenergon they had mined.\n\n&quot;I NEVER want to see another energon cube in my life!!&quot; Bloodystrike yells \nout, throwing a box against the wall, &quot;And don&#39;t say anything!&quot; he snaps at \nReptilica.\n\nReptilica chuckles, walking off toward the bridge, Bloodystrike following \nhim. Once there, he sees the conflict near the Ark on the scanners.\n\n&quot;Hey, Bloodystrike, want to come with me and check this out?&quot; he asks his \npartner.\n\nBloodystrike nods. &quot;Might as well.&quot;\n\nThe two bots exit the base, setting off toward the Ark.\n\n"}}
