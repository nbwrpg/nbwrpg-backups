They were vast, deep, and housed some of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dangerous prehistoric creatures anyone had seen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Among all the chaos of the bugs and aquatic life of the\n&gt; swamp,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a long\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lost and forgotten stasis pod slipped from its peach and\n&gt; floated to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the bank\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of a body of water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     The computer, now able to activate, began the DNA scanning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; process to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; select the beast mode of the protoform within. The sphere rose,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scanned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the vast area of the swamp. After a double pass, it selected\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; powerful beast mode according to the habitat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     The sphere rejoined the pod, and the transformation began.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moments past\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the computer bagan to read off the data needed by the new\n&gt; form\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to survive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the beast wars.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     With a crack, the door opened and the new warrior crawled\n&gt; out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the pod\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and on to the bank of the swamp. He looked around. With the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; complete history\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the beast wars stored in his data banks, he would be able to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; handle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself in this new world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Looking, he said to himself, &quot;Ah, this beast mode shall\n&gt; make a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fine body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now all I need to do is to transform.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Paralysis said the code word and his Predacon Beast Mode\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emerged. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frog changed into an armored knight of the Predacon dynasty. He\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; armed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a toxen gun, a semi-automatic pistol, and optic lasers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;Ha!
