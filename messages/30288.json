Just great. well, I still need someone to \nrespond to those posts. DarkMouse is in Killfest&#39;s base. Squizzy is with \nZardus, and KitKat is going to be coming back. That part was planned before \nI left.  Besides, it could make things interesting.  If the RPG group says \nthey don&#39;t want KitKat back, then I&#39;ll nix her out. Let me know.\n\n-original message-----\n&gt;OOC: Well, Logo, you see, when Kitkat died, the predacon alliance fell \n&gt;apart.\n&gt;They are currently in a civil war, with Drillbit, Darkfate, and Killfest&#39;s\n&gt;groups against Hell Beast&#39;s. Megatron is dead.\n&gt;\n&gt;:::Wheeljack/Hun-Grr/Ramjet/Time Warp:::\n&gt;\n&gt;::he started building the repair station::\n&gt;~~~~~\n&gt;::Hun-grr reluctantly backs off::\n&gt;Hun-Grr: Fine, Hun-grr will spare.\n&gt;::he then sees all of his team members fighting each other. He fires 1 shot\n&gt;at each of them::\n&gt;Hun-Grr: QUIT IT OR HUN-GRR WILL RIP ALL YOU PERSONALLY!\n&gt;~~~~~\n&gt;Ramjet: Im not sure about their defenses, but the Trainers have 6 bots. As\n&gt;for the Predacon group, there is a large number that grows all the time.\n&gt;~~~~~\n&gt;Time Warp: What do you think we are, stupid? We tried calling her as soon \n&gt;as\n&gt;we got back online! But fine, try her if you&#39;d like.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
