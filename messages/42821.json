She felt much \nbetter and quite in the good mood. She walked out of the chamber room \nand towards the bridge again where her station was at.  She walked \npassed the mess hall and decided to see the parts of the ship she \nhadn&#39;t seen yet.  Letting her nose guide her, so to speak, she went \ndown towards the brig. She wondered who might be locked up down here. \nAnd if so, how long? Spare parts were always high in demand no matter \nwho&#39;s side you were on. Besides, maximal parts could be used for so \nmany different things. \n\n\n"}}
