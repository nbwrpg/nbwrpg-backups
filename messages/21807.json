His life had never been =\r\nfair from the \n&gt; beginning.\n&gt; Bu8t now he was searching for Von, wanting to=\r\n see him and perhaps \nget to \n&gt; know the never brother he knew nothing abou=\r\nt.\n&gt; Vons last know location: Prehistoric Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; But this young man se=\r\narching for his older half-brother had his own \nname, \n&gt; one, which his mot=\r\nher said suited him well. His name was Vlad.\n&gt; The pampered out of the two =\r\noffspring.\n&gt; But Vlad had other reasons besides a family reunion in order t=\r\no \nfind his \n&gt; brother. Their mother had passed away less then 6 months pri=\r\nor to \nthe \n&gt; present and, surprisingly, left every piece of property to Vo=\r\nn.\n&gt; So, now Vlad, was left to locate his brother and supposedly inform \nhi=\r\nm of \n&gt; everything which had happened. If Von was still alive. And if he \nw=\r\nas=85Vlad \n&gt; was sure he wouldn&#39;t be for much longer.\n&gt; From what his mothe=\r\nr had told him, Von was weak in mind and both \nspirit=85a \n&gt; very easy targ=\r\net if he wasn&#39;t careful.\n&gt; There had been no further reports on him after h=\r\ne had disappeared \non \n&gt; Prehistoric Earth and only the Matrix knew if he w=\r\nas alive. And if \nhe \n&gt; wasn&#39;t, Vlad snickered, everything would go to hims=\r\nelf!\n&gt; \n&gt; Vlads personally owner Predacon StarHopper closed in on the time =\r\n\ndeplaced \n&gt; dimensional rift, which led to Prehistoric Earth, thinking of =\r\nhis \nactions \n&gt; towards his brother if indeed he was alive.\n&gt; Vlad couldn&#39;t=\r\n just keep what his mother had legally signs off as \nVons, he \n&gt; didn&#39;t wan=\r\nt to get in slag with the law.\n&gt; But if he had proof that Von was dead, if =\r\nhe was, then everything \nwas his by \n&gt; the law. However, if Von was indeed =\r\nalive then he would have to \nresort to \n&gt; another way of getting what he wa=\r\nnted. As in returning with Vons \ndeath \n&gt; certificate.\n&gt; But for legal matt=\r\ners he wouldn&#39;t do it himself, no. He would pay \nanother or \n&gt; even a few o=\r\nthers to snuff out Von for him.\n&gt; Vlad knew that there were other bots on e=\r\narth, he just needed to \noffer the \n&gt; right price to get what he wanted. As=\r\n in ionized Energon. A perfect \ndrug or \n&gt; a very expensive and profitable =\r\n selling pieces.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rift came closer and Vlad shifted the craft to au=\r\ntopilot, \nsitting back \n&gt; in the chair of the cockpit.\n&gt; All he had to do w=\r\nas ride it out until he entered earth&#39;s solar \nsystem, \n&gt; land, find the ne=\r\narest Predacon faction, pay his assassin, and sit \nback to \n&gt; wait until he=\r\n either brought back Vons badly decomposed body to \nprove he had \n&gt; died, o=\r\nr freshly severed head=85.\n&gt; Vlad licked his lips as he leaned his head on =\r\nhis hand, being a \nPredacon was \n&gt; wonderful.\n&gt; A large dog/wolf-like creat=\r\nure resting it&#39;s huge head on the \narmrest, \n&gt; whining. Vlad knew it had ne=\r\nver liked space travel, having the mutt \never \n&gt; since he couldn&#39;t remember=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; The StarHopper entered slowly into the rift, eventually \ndisappearin=\r\ng into \n&gt; its depths. Knocking out all of the ships systems as well as Vlad=\r\n \nand his \n&gt; animal.\n&gt; The edge of the rift shimmering for a moment before =\r\nsettling, \nleaving it to \n&gt; look as if no ship had ever passed through.\n&gt; L=\r\neaving nothing but the silence of space.\n&gt; The hunt was on!**\n&gt; \n&gt; (20 min =\r\nlater)\n&gt; \n&gt; ** The rift opened on the other side, spewing out the Predacon =\r\n\nStarHopper, \n&gt; the ship turning on its axes and sparking.\n&gt; The force from=\r\n being ejected from the rift sent the small ship \nsailing \n&gt; towards Earth,=\r\n shaking it nearly to pieces before there was a \nviolent shake \n&gt; as it str=\r\nuck the atmosphere.\n&gt; Throwing the unconscious Vlad against the window as t=\r\nhe ship&#39;s \nouter hull \n&gt; turned into a large fireball, finally breaking the=\r\n atmosphere and \nbeginning \n&gt; its decent towards the ocean.
