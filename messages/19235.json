I drink to your health! Now, I&#39;ve got a great \nidea! For the Autobots and Decepticons, why don&#39;t we have a group \nmake some sort of ray, and than they blast it to cover the planet. \nWhen the bots come in contact with it, they wake up. People can take \ncontrol of them. Starting the Great War 4 million years early. Now \nthat&#39;s great. Now, I have some bad news. Heard from Bob Skir. He says \nhe would love to come, but he can&#39;t, because he doesn&#39;t want us in \ntrouble. He looked at nbwrpg.tripod.com, and saw they we were using \nsome real Beast Wars names. We&#39;re kinda breaking copyright laws by \ndoing that. If he comes, he&#39;ll atract attention to the site, and than \nwe&#39;ll be shut down and mainframe would sue either all of us or just \nthe council, depending on ow bad the infrigment. He said to keep low \nand be quiet. Either he cares of that was some lame excuse not to \ncome and keep us admiring him. I think it&#39;s the latter. And JP, if \nthere&#39;s a problem with this post tell me. By what I read I thought \nHell Beast was close to the door.)\n\nStarscream\n\nStarscream was walking towars the Maximal, whom his scanners said was \nbehind a dune, when Megatron and his cronies arrived. He couldn&#39;t be \nout here alone. He would be creamed. At least that Maximal would be \ntoasted if Megatron saw him. He ran, rolling and ducking fire, and \nwent for the door. When he got there he saw Hell Beast, trying to \nopen it. He immediatly put his hand around his neck and a launcher to \nhis head.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re running with the wrong crowd. Didn&#39;t I gvie you a warning \nalready?&quot;\n\nStarscream&#39;s signal opened the door, and he took Hell Beast in with \nhim. It locked behind him. He called to KitKat.\n\n&quot;Honey, look who&#39;s come for dinner!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nFliq\n\nBetween sobs, Fliq answered Ramulus&#39; question.\n\n&quot;He..*sniff* got so angry because they destroyed everything we got on \nthe moon that Bronco took over. It caused him to go crazy with his \nlauncher, and he shot himself.&quot; Fliq broke down again, &quot;I&#39;m the last \none now. Gekkidama&#39;s dead. Brix is dead. I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot; He \nhugged the body close and kept crying.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois kept crying for Battera, and than something. On the other side \nof the room, a mirror/mirage appeared, and it had Battera being \nabused by....him! She must be having her own dream sequence. He saw \nthe battle before him, and it semed that hte past had a slight \nadvantage, but not much. But he had to get her out of here. The \nprogram had been downloaded. It was up to it&#39;s strength now. Battera \nneeded to get to saftey. He yelled at the top of his lungs.\n\n&quot;CYBERSHARK PULL THE PLUG!!!!!&quot;\n\nOn the outside, Vulois&#39; voice spoke in the quietest tone, barely able \nto be heard.\n\n&quot;Cybershark pull the plug.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon saw that no one was contacting the other base. They were \nsending someone, and they couldn&#39;t follow because he would see \nshadows. But Ignatius had something.\n\n&quot;Sir, I think I&#39;ve found the other base.&quot;\n\n&quot;How?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve hacked into the Ark&#39;s computers, or what&#39;s left of them. They \nare prety messed up, but I&#39;ve found a log of the Ark&#39;s last 25 \ntransmissions. One goes to something called the Cybertronian Fire.&quot;\n\n&quot;That must be it! Where s it?&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s too messed up to pinpoint exactly, but I think I can narow it \ndown to a 5 square  mile radius. Except....&quot;\n\n&quot;What?&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s in South America.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, everyone on Savage. We&#39;re going across the world!&quot;\n\nThe Trainers took of for South America. On their way they sent a \nmessage to Slayer.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re going to South America for a mission. When we&#39;re done we&#39;ll \nnotify you. If we haven&#39;t when you&#39;re done find some place called the \nCybertronian Fire. We thinks it&#39;s a Maximal base. We&#39;ll need your \nhelp.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
