I want to see every last of my enemies dead at my \ncharacters&#39; feet.  But I won&#39;t be cheap and have my characters lose just for \nmy own goals unless I don&#39;t like the characters and I feel better to kill \nthem off now then later)\n\nThe Oblitercons/The Protectobots/Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark Claw/Sun \nCrusher/Reflector/Scattershot/Nemesis Enforcer/Vehement/Firestarter/Unitron:\n\n\n\nDark One rolled in the air, avoiding the barrage of lasers.  He opened a \ncomm. link to IR.  \n\n&quot;When I said a cease fire, I meant no one shot at me.  Call the idiot \nattacking me off before my comrades and I gut him and hang his corpse up \nagainst the CF as a decoration.  By the way, sensors still detect Alliance \nforces inside your ship, and I haven&#39;t seen any prisoners come out yet.  \nSpeed things up.  Most of our troops are rather triggerhappy, yet not as much \nas yours.&quot;\n\n---\n\nBreakdown fired off a sonic arc from his blaster, a couple seconds later \nfiring another off at Tarantopulous\n\n---\n\nHiss fired off four fusion blasts from his cannon at Tarantopulous&#39; chest.\n\n---\n\nScavenger continued pulling on Pyro&#39;s arm, pulling him up inch by inch \nthrough the thick mud.\n\n---\n\nHot Spot cursed as he saw First Aid and Blades.  &quot;Cotton-picking Predacon \nrust buckets.&quot;\n\n---\n\nGroove took out his photon pistol and set it to a low setting, using it like \na welder on First Aid&#39;s wounds.\n\n---\n\nBlades followed Groove&#39;s example, and used his own photon pistol to help fix \nup First Aid roughly.\n\n---\n\nFirst Aid remained unconsciouss, to much mech-fluid gone to reverse the \ndamage by merely closing the wounds up.  He needed a CR, and fast.\n\n---\n\nStreetwise continued to keep his photon pistol at the ready, not trusting \nthese Predacons in the slightest.\n\n===\n\nDemon Wulf turned his head, seeing Dark Claw pull up next to him and Flesh \nRipper pad up to his other side.\n\n&quot;Transform my brethren.&quot; he growled.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw transformed to biped mode, looking at the small number of Maxis \naround Iron Raptor.  &quot;Pathetic.&quot; he smiled.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper transformed from his hyena mode to biped mode, remaining silent \nbut keeping his claws out.\n\n===\n\nSun Crusher stopped near the hole in the bridge, knowing a shield protected \nit.  He looked to Reflector who was on his way.\n\nThe Brotherhood member hovered in the air, waiting.\n\n---\n\nReflector was only a dozen or so meters from Sun Crusher and closing rapidly.\n\n===\n\nScattershot tossed Nemesis over his shoulder.\n\n&quot;Well &#39;Emperor&#39;, so much for you.&quot; he laughed madly, launching into the air \nin the direction of Spain.\n\n===\n\nVehement looked through the hole in the hull of the CF, seeing and sensing \nSun Crusher.  He turned back to the other two robots in the room with him.  \nHe awaited a response.  If he wasn&#39;t let out soon, he&#39;d leave forcefully.\n\n---\n\nUnitron trained his rifle on the door, waiting.  He wanted to be ready in \ncase hostilities started up again.  \n\n---\n\nFirestarter armed a pair of missiles, hoping hostilities WOULD start up \nagain.  He wanted to gut some inferior Maxis.\n\n\n"}}
