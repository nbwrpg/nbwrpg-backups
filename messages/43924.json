Beast Wars 2 was one of many Japanese series that \nnever \n&gt; came over here.  Ya see, after the Japanese had shown the first \nseason of \n&gt; Beast Wars, they hadn&#39;t yet gotten episodes from season two and \nthree, so \n&gt; they showed 2 filler series while they were waiting.  In 1998, the \nBeast Wars \n&gt; 2 cartoon came out in Japan with a new set of Cybertrons and \nDestrons facing \n&gt; off on the planet Gaea for something called Angolmois energy.  The \nCybertron \n&gt; leader was Lioconvoy, a lion, and the leader of the Destrons was a \nnew \n&gt; Galvatron, who was a dragon.  All the other toys were repaints of \nBeast Wars, \n&gt; Generatrion 2, and even Generation 1 toys.  There was kind of a \n&quot;nature \n&gt; versus technology&quot; theme in the show quite similar to what Beast \nMachines \n&gt; would later do, with the &quot;good guys&quot; being animals and the &quot;bad \nguys&quot; being \n&gt; vehicles.  In case you were wondering, the next year they did Beast \nWars NEO.\n\n\n"}}
