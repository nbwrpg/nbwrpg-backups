It felt wonderful!  \n&quot;Oh...a-a drink.  Yeah.  Water?  Ok.&quot; he said, pressing a few buttons at a \ndispencer with his free arm, two cups appearing.\n\nOne of the cups had cold water in it, the other had a pink liquid, liquid \nenergon.  Since the attack in space, and then the crash, Chordate hadn&#39;t had \nmuch time to sit around and do nothing.  But with the kitty holding onto him \nso lovingly, now was a good time for him!\n\nGrabbing the cup of water, he held it in front of Feline, a shiver running \nthrough him as he began to feel the vibrations of her lovely purr, her head \nrubbing against his shoulder.\n\n"}}
