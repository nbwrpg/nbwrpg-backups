Indeed, their signatures were Maximal but they were still close enough to the Alliance base for them to send others after them, ones in which would trick them into trusting them and they take them by surprise.\nWith a growl he took two steps towards the strangers, a snarl on his fangs and his tail swaying behind him.\nTheir scent had no hostility to it, simple collected calm.\nDinobot narrowed his eyes at Necromancer and his words: elite soldiers sent to Earth to aid the Maximal force? It sounded believable enough.\nHe shifted his weight from one foot to the other as he looked at one of the strangers and then the other, the idea of this as a trick slowly proving that it may not be.\nA growl escaped his fangs before he transformed into robot mode, the transition being a little rough due to the wounds.\nDinobot looked at Necromancer, then at the other of the two bots. They were indeed Maximals, but they had only partially answered his question. He had asked who they were, they had given their functions�but not their named.\nHe kept a wary optic on them both, his voice as flat and devoid of emotion as ever.*\n\n� Your names.�\n\n* It wasn�t a question, it was a command.\nHe needed to know their names before he even began to trust them, would even go near them.*\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
