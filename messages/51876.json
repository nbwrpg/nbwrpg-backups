I would \nguess \n&gt; Galvatron&#39;s base would be the logical place for them to go but I \nknow that \n&gt; bases defenses and we arent ready to launch an assault on them \nwith the \n&gt; tripred around. Let us go in and plan our next move. I will also \nhave to pick \n&gt; a new second in command now that our troops are combined.

Cyngar \n&gt; knows to many secrets of mine we need to eliminate him. If we do \nthe tripred \n&gt; may attack us or join forces with Cyngar..also who do you think \nwould be a \n&gt; fittign second in command?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;  Proto collapsed ina  chair on the bridge from pure lack of \nenergy. \n&gt; Destructor and Quilldart stared eachother down. &quot;We are on the \nsame tream now \n&gt; galvatronian dont get any funny ideas&quot; Quilldart stared a hole \ninto his face. \n&gt; &quot;I follow Galva&#39;s spark till the end...no one elses&quot; He turned and \nwalked \n&gt; down the hall.\n\n\n"}}
