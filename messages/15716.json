I have some information concerning Megatron. If you \nwish to let the Alliance continue to survive, you will listen to what \nI say.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nPrebon\n\nPrebon went to his quarters. This was excellent. They had a new \nmember, and a hostage who they could torture to crush spirit. Plus \nthe other Maximals will undoutably try a rescue plan. And when they \ndo Savage will be ready to greet them. Plus the unstoppable force of \nTamron! But now that he had made himself known, word would grow. \nOthers may come looking. He needed a way to gain huge power and \ninfluence on this planet. If there was some way to plant a major \nleader with the chip, and weild power from behind the \nscenes.....That&#39;s it! The puppetmaster plan! Time to gain power!\n\nPrebon set to work thinking how he could luer a major leader to him.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nThe shuttle hovered above Earth&#39;s atmosphere and gave one final \ntransmission to the Ark.\n\n&quot;Spears? Striker? Bluestreak? Anybody? The calvary&#39;s coming babay! \nGet ready to replenish the Ark!&quot;\n\nHe turned to the others.\n\n&quot;Say a last prayer to the Matrix, boys. We could wind up dead yet.&quot;\n\nBrix began to lower the ship. Instantly it sped up and started \nheating. The metal at the back was very hot, and began bending. A \nfire broke out inside and at the back of the shuttle.\n\n&quot;Ramulus, we nned you to put it out!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
