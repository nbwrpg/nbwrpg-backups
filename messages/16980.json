I really wasn&#39;t planning on killing Vulois. He&#39;s just getting a \npersonality change.\n\nVulois saw them run out as the his clock ticked down. No point in \nsacrifing himself. With just under a second to spare, Vulois stopped \nhis countdown to think.\n\n&quot;I may still be alive, but what I said was true. My mission is over. \nThere is no point in going back to Child now. We would just go back \nto the mountain and be prone for another attack. It&#39;s Child and \nHerald&#39;s turn to go about peace. I&#39;ve got nothing left except this \nmountain. Wait, I need to make it convincing!&quot;\n\nVulois went to tank mode and loaded a rocket. He went down a tiny bit \ninto one of the wrong tunnels, and fired. He was almost buried in \nrock. He was barely escaped as the rocket exploded just before it \nleft the mountain surface so no one saw it. The explosion threw fiery \npieces of rock into the sky. He hoped that at least some of them \ncould die. But the important thing was....he was finaly free. \n\n&quot;Convix? Are you there?&quot;\n\nYes Vulois, but I will be leaving you soon.\n\nAm I keeping my powers?\n\nA small fraction of it as gratitude for your work. But once I leave \nyou will be back to plain old normal Vulois, the Predacon.\n\nBut what about the Peace Talks?\n\nChild will do it. If Nemesis doesn&#39;t bother him. Windrazor will se to \nit that he remembers the task.\n\nBut what can I do?\n\nWhat woudl you like to do? You are free from your duty. You may do \nanything you like.\n\nI.....I want to go to Cybertron. There is work being done here, but \nnot there. Both sides will have to work together in order for us to \nbe saved from the nebula. I will start a small peace group there, \nfocusing on organic parts. But...there is one other thing I would \nlike to do first.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nI want to say good-bye to Battera and Cybershark. Before I go through \nThe Gateway that we discovered, I will swing by the Cybertronian Fire \nand say good-bye.\n\nAre you sure, Vulois? If you go, you may not like what you find. It \nmay make you want to stay, and believe you have another mission.\n\nBut I must! They have been the closest to me, especially Battera. I \nmust see them, at least once, even if they are different.\n\nSo be it. If you leave you will be seen. I will take you to the \nCybertronian Fire.\n\nHold on a sec.\n\nVulois went to bot mode and walked down that hallway, to find the \ndrawing of AngelNemesis. He took his finger and begin to draw beside \nit. When he was finished, it was the picture of a small bot, casting \nout this monster form the land, and below it he wrote:\n\n                    The Chosen Child will be our Saviour\n\nHe spoke to Convix.\n\nI am ready. Take me.\n\nVery well. When you get there, your power will be drained a bit and I \nwill no longer be here to speak with you. Good-bye Vulois\n\nGood-bye Convix. Thank You for everything.\n\nAnd with that, Vulois vanished from the mountain, and from all of his \nfriends lives.\n\n\n"}}
