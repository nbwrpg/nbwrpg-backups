He sat forward, back \nslightly bent. His right arm sat firmly on the armrest with his hand \ncurled around the end. His left elbow sat on the other armrest with \nhis hand held to his chin. The mighty leaders first two fingers \ntapped his lips as if in deep thought. (Classic captain Kirk pose.)\n\nBlaze entered to give him a full report. &quot;The operation was a \nsuccess, Slayer will be 100% in a few days.&quot; she stepped back as if \nshe were avoiding a flying object that didn&#39;t exist, &quot;He&#39;ll regain \nconsciousness shortly.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very good.&quot; Prebon replied, shifting his weight to his other \nhand. &quot;I want him ready for action by tomorrow.&quot; Prebon wasn&#39;t a bot \nwith much patience and wouldn&#39;t let one of his bots rest for more \nthan a day unless they were dead.\n\n\n"}}
