This was a bot whom she would be wary of from now on.  She felt \nsomething in her spark for this one. And that would be dangerous for \nher. She had lived her life for the predacons, and all it gave her \nwas a grave to rest in. Now, all that her life ment was to eradicate \nthe maximals at any cost. Yet, for all her anger, she felt something \nfor this bot who had the nerve to hit her. Something,  she couldn&#39;t \nexplain.  She told herself that it was nothing and walked out of the \nroom.\n\nShe made her way back to the entrance and thought of Carnatron&#39;s \nmessage. She opened a channel to him. &quot;I am at the entrance. If you \nwish to speak to me, please meet me at the entrance of the base.&quot;\n\nAnd yet, her thoughts returned to SharpClaw.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : SharpClaw : :\n&gt; He chuckled at the femme, as he turned and moved towards the door, \nunlocking it.\n&gt; SharpClaw: Amuseing, but who do you think your threatening?
