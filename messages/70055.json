Yes, even magma didn&#39;t stopp him from trying to =\r\nhelp his comrades. He&#39;s got some burn marks in his armor, and that&#39;s his da=\r\nmaged state for now.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: \n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps the power he had extended outw=\r\nard, was in vain. Tucson lies on the ground for a moment or so, but slowly =\r\nrolls back up onto his left side, holding up his upper body with his arms w=\r\nhich shake under the sheer pressure of his weight. He looks around, and fin=\r\nds Darkhawk, severely weakened by the powerful blast. Night Shift wastes no=\r\n time in slapping a pair of stasis cuffs on Darkhawk, who in reality was Wi=\r\nndlord.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Gotchya. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re in good hands now. Yo, Kup! Bett=\r\ner take this guy for me, I think Tucson Prime&#39;s commn&#39; around.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson=\r\n calmly looks around yet with a stern expression on his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Not - t=\r\nhe result I was hoping for but - it did enable us to get somewhere. Can&#39;t -=\r\n have it all I suppose, but doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re giving up all together.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Slowly he makes it onto his knees, and then plants one foot down on the g=\r\nround, hoisting himself up to his feet, with a bit of a stumble. He was wea=\r\nk, extremely weak, and it was questionable wether or not he would be able t=\r\no continue fighting. He didn&#39;t want anyone to see him in such a condition t=\r\nhough. He fights his weakness and tries to shrug off the grogginess he feel=\r\ns. Night Shift nodds in agreement with Tucson Prime. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I hear ya on t=\r\nhat one big bot. Sometimes, ya win some, ya lose some, and sometimes it&#39;s k=\r\ninda like in the middle of both losn&#39; and winn&#39;n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson understood t=\r\nhat the mission itself would be difficult so he prepared himself for the un=\r\nexpected by working with that uncertainty that plans don&#39;t always go as the=\r\ny are intended. He shrugs off the fact that Cyclonus is not even scathed by=\r\n the energy attack. He was now curious about Rodimus and how he had handled=\r\n it. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Something - Rodimus wasn&#39;t too good at doing. I have a feeling=\r\n he may not have taken this too well, Nightshift.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightshift narrows =\r\nhis optics.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Lemme tell ya somethn&#39; Tucson, before you became a Prime=\r\n, and he was on the job, it didn&#39;t look like his spark was totally in his w=\r\nork. But you, the quiet guy in the corner, the guy who threw caution ta the=\r\n wind ta save his comrades, the guy who faces adversity as it comes and ain=\r\n&#39;t afraid of it, and the guy who actually learned from his loss rather than=\r\n complain&#39;n about it. You got what it takes, and always had it. It - just w=\r\nasn&#39;t obvious because you&#39;re too modest for your own good and you kinda jus=\r\nt kept ta yourself most of the time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson listens thoughtfully to N=\r\nightshift.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re right, I wasn&#39;t much for words at the time... But =\r\nback then, I wanted to approach Rodimus on his not so pleasurable attitude =\r\non his position as a Prime. It seemed as if he didn&#39;t want it. And you know=\r\n, responsibility isn&#39;t for everyone. And for some, it&#39;s second nature.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Understandable. Now I admit, I dunno if I could=\r\n ever take your job big guy. Not that I ain&#39;t capable of it, I know I ain&#39;t=\r\n a good match for the position. And I ain&#39;t afraid ta admit that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tuc=\r\nson Prime nodds once, and studies Cyclonus once more. Something dawns on hi=\r\nm. He seemed relieved to be free of something. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Is it me Cyclonus or =\r\ndo you appear to be liberated of something that may have been holding you b=\r\nack? Why do you work with Hydras anyway? What is the purpose of working wit=\r\nh him when you can be your own individual? Your life should be as you inten=\r\nded, and not what others have intended for you. It boils down to freedom. Y=\r\nou have the chance to experience freedom. If I were you I&#39;d take that chanc=\r\ne now. As a matter of fact, Scorponok, Scourge, what seems to be holding yo=\r\nu two back here, when you yourselves can be your own individuals as Decepti=\r\ncons? Does Hydras have you on some sort of leash? I see no such restraints =\r\nso that means if you want freedom you should also take it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Night Shif=\r\nt could see what Tucson was up to. It was one of his thinking outside the b=\r\nox kind of strategies. And a strategy that would benefit all and not just o=\r\nne faction. Tucson was trying to break new ground, and as crazy as it all l=\r\nooked, he sits back to watch it all take place. Tucson Prime now steps assi=\r\nde and waits to see if any of them either try to destroy him, or actually a=\r\ngree with what he was trying to tell them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Whatever any of you chose,=\r\n your decision is your own and I will not interfere. We may not be allies, =\r\nbut I do respect the need for one&#39;s free will. But if you attack me, do not=\r\n expect me to be so forgiving.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston=\r\n Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight Nodded, she stood up =\r\nwith fear in her face. she was ready to follow Rodimus\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus tap=\r\nped his code on the door and it slid open.
