He throws the missile launcher to the side as it runs out of ammo, and fires several shots from his rifle at the femm.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMosquitor transforms back into robot mode after Celeno falls into stasis lock, a good amount of acid still inside her and eating away. He finally notices the energy that she had taken from him, finding it a bit hard to stan in the air. Landing on the doorway, Mosquitor takes out his acid hose (mouthpiece in robot mode), sending a stream of acid at Ocipite and Aelo, splashing alot of it onto the floor.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Aelo/Celeno/Ocipite::\n&gt; \n&gt; With the hit Celeno fell in stasis lock; Aelo fell on floor, she \n&gt; lookehow her sister avoided Zaruds&#39;s missiles and  she shouted to \n&gt; Ocipite &quot;RUN!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;WHAT!!!&quot; answered Ocipite while she fired  ten energy balls against \n&gt; Mosquitor and ten agains Zardus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;DOn&#39;t ARGUE!!!!&quot; shouted Aelo while she fired ten energy balls a \n&gt; Hurrican and ten more against Wheeljack.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;WE...&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;OCIPITE Is not TIME TO ARGUE that!!&quot; Shouted Aelo\n\n\n"}}
