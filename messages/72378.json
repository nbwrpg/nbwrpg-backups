That is fine\nand well then.&quot;\n\nHe was evidently satisfied in what he saw from NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s face. He\nsat down in front of his personal console in the room and the screen\nin front of him. He tapped in a few few commands and the screen\nquickly came alive, showing the image of TUSCON in dragon mode with\nseveral other Maximals standing around him, one of them even riding on\nhis back. He appeared to be in some sort of large prison cell, perhaps\nan excercise or work out section.\n\nThere were three Sharkticon looking guards watching TUSCON and the\nothers with him with mixtures of derision and boredom. There was no\nsound comming from the screen, it was a purely visual display.\n\n&quot;Give me one good reason why I shouldn&#39;t crush his spark.&quot; DARK\nRODIMUS said as he looked at the screen, his finger tapping on the\nconsole in an odd beat. It meant nothing of itself, but it was\nsomething that the old RODIMUS used to do when he was trying to come\nto a decision that no one else agreed with.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
