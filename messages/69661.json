That is the fun part of\nit all, isn&#39;t it? But now poor Zarak, who was actually standing over\nTuscon before all this happened, who was actually detecting Rat Trap,\nhas no chance to RP in any of that.\n\nAll I&#39;m asking, if you dont mind, please, slow down the amount of\nevents in a single post.  It makes it better for us all. :)\n\nI will post when I get home from work :)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\nOn 2/23/10, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Yes he&#39;s in the halls of the base.  What happened is Dark Hawk really\n&gt; got him ticked off, and its this anger that&#39;s driving him to react as\n&gt; quickly as he does.  It&#39;s like an adrenaline rush, which he gets when\n&gt; someone really gets on his nerves, or is doing something to endanger those\n&gt; he cares about.  Right now, he&#39;s at that point where reasoning with him\n&gt; won&#39;t do any good.

Yet his legs very\n&gt;&gt; shakey from the paraylizing effects of the weapons, it was clear that his\n&gt;&gt; upper body was returning. Still rather dented from his ordeal, and\n&gt;&gt; damaged,\n&gt;&gt; he was not about to let Darkhawk get his way.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; On the contrary, same here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He sends a sonar wave to Rat Trap, which intern, interrupts the effect\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; the paraylasis dart, thus returning him to a somewhat normal state.

Nice gon&#39;.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson thrusts Darkhawk to the ground harshly and then transforms. Rat\n&gt;&gt; Trap gets the cue and gets into his front cab.

BURN RUBBER!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson spins his tires and creates another smoke screen with his duel\n&gt;&gt; exhaust system as his engine roars to full tilt. Now he was able to sense\n&gt;&gt; Nightlight, and before leaving he was determined to get her out of there.\n&gt;&gt; It\n&gt;&gt; may not have been Rodimus who he had intended but if he could not save his\n&gt;&gt; leader, he would at least save a trusty comrade.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap keeps buckled in. Tucson assesses his systems, and finds his\n&gt;&gt; location tracking units online.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Tracking systems online all systems working at sixty percent, and I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have\n&gt;&gt; now pinpointed Nightlight&#39;s location. She&#39;s been moved.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap looks back, seeing that Tucson had a chance to literally run\n&gt;&gt; Darkhawk over but chose not to.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Awww rats! Ya didn&#39;t run feather head over!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson replies.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s not the Autobot way, Rat Trap.

They&#39;ll be after you like hounds on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; criminal after that little display back there, which I may add, was rather\n&gt;&gt; impressive.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson navigates through the tower, with Rat Trap at the wheel.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, pay attention to what&#39;s in front of us, I don&#39;t want to smack into\n&gt;&gt; the wall here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap quickly averts a wall while getting Tucson away from it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Whooops, good point. And this is why I ain&#39;t never got a driver&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; license. Okay Wheels, which way?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He takes a hard left, following his sonar systems. He slows his speed\n&gt;&gt; &gt; down\n&gt;&gt; once comming to where the signal is the strongest.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; We&#39;re here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap gets out as Tucson slowly transforms into his robot mode. He\n&gt;&gt; finds himself unstable on his feet, and stumbles into where Nightlight is,\n&gt;&gt; and falls on his knees.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Wheels?! What&#39;s wrong?!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson had not rested, and his damages again taking their toll. He\n&gt;&gt; &gt; slowly\n&gt;&gt; gets back up onto his feet and realizes that his robot mode takes more\n&gt;&gt; energy than his vehicle mode. He had to remain in bot form, if he was\n&gt;&gt; going\n&gt;&gt; to get Nightlight out of her bind.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Night - Light. It&#39;s - me.. Tucson.

Patetic bot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;interogation chamber, you and Zarak take every piece of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information\n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;coudl be usefull, even if that means to use painful means; when\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you\n&gt;&gt; have a good\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;amount of information we can go to take the matrix...\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (SNIP)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Zarak straightened, crossing his arms over his chest as he coolly\n&gt;&gt; looked at Perceptor. &quot;Of course&quot; he said, the look on his face a cold\n&gt;&gt; blank\n&gt;&gt; mask, revealing nothing of the inner turmoil he was dealing with. There\n&gt;&gt; was\n&gt;&gt; a part of him that wanted to blast the little Predacon for daring to tell\n&gt;&gt; him anything. But the ugly thing was that Zarak still needed the extra\n&gt;&gt; forces that Hydras and his Predacons brought to the table.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So rather than commanding his Scorponok unit to open fire on the\n&gt;&gt; base he just nodded and said, &quot;I apologize, I have overstepped my place.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile Cyclonus and Scourge continued to face down Dark\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus,\n&gt;&gt; the air was tense as Dark Rodimus&#39; optics stared into Cyclonus, niether of\n&gt;&gt; them ready to back down, both of them remembering the last battle they\n&gt;&gt; fought!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However it was Perceptor that broke the deadlock as he continued\n&gt;&gt; giving orders . . .\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (PASTE)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The rest, we have to Keep an eye in maximal base things are\n&gt;&gt; becoming\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interesting lately there, Rodimus... I need you for task&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The affect of the command was almost instant as Rodimus stepped\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back\n&gt;&gt; from Cyclonus and Scourge and looked over at Perceptor. &quot;What&#39;cha need\n&gt;&gt; Percy?&quot; Rodimus said to Perceptor, happy for the moment that it was\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor and Hydras giving orders and not Cyclonus and his lap dog.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cyclonus, seeing the break in the tension also stepped back,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pulling\n&gt;&gt; Scourge back with him. &quot;There will be another time Scourge.&quot; he said\n&gt;&gt; quietly, &quot;No need to fight this out here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scourge nodded, &quot;Yes, there will be.&quot; he said darkly. His optics\n&gt;&gt; still watched Rodimus, his look almost hungry as he smiled evilly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As the tensions between Cyclonus, Scourge and Rodimus cooled Zarak\n&gt;&gt; turned to look at Tuscon, wondering what information this bot could hold.\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Come&quot; Zarak said to Darkhawk, &quot;Let&#39;s see what this Auto . . . &quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *BEEP*\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Zarak was caught in mid sentence by his scanner going off, the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand\n&gt;&gt; held one that he had been keeping trained on Tuscon. He glanced down at\n&gt;&gt; it,\n&gt;&gt; a curious look on his face. For some reason it was registering a life sign\n&gt;&gt; where there had been none before. It was located somewhere near Tuscon&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; head.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Zarak stepped forward to take a more careful scan . . .\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Yup, the same scanner he had been scanning him with a few\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; posts\n&gt;&gt; ago. It is still out and processing :)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus/Zarak)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
