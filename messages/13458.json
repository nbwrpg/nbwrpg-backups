You got blown around, making stupid phone calls,\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generally been letting your ego get to you!&quot; Deemos yelled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Deemos!

Oh, yeah, Infectra, throw\n&gt; &gt; Airbomber\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out, he&#39;s of no use to me anymore!&quot; Deemos said. Airbomber hled his\nhead\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pain and fell onto the ground. He showed all of the signs of death.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Looks like you don&#39;t have to worry about him.&quot; Deemos said. Deemos\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Artist walked to a secluded area, around the base where nobody was\n&gt; &gt; looking.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, what do I have to do?&quot; Artist asked.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;v ebeen thinking, what you have to do is...die.&quot; Deemos said.\nArtist\n&gt; &gt; &gt; looked at Deemos to try and get out of this, but Deemos raised a claw\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; smashed it into Artist. It went right through. Artist was brought to\nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knees.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You failed, and I am not as forgiving as that idiot Megatron.&quot; Deemos\n&gt; &gt; said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He pulled out rifle and shot Artist with it, in the head. Artist\ndidn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time to react before Deemos pulled a hand full of wires from his back\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; jerked out, ripping his spark out and leaving gore all over. He pushed\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; button on the claw and the spark exploded. Artist&#39;s hand reached out\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grabbed a sparkle, then stopped moving.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Too compassionate.&quot; Deemos said. He dropped the wires, let the mech\n&gt; fluid\n&gt; &gt; &gt; run off of his fingers and slicing Artist up. He stored the piecesin a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; freezer and made note that it was a package that needed to be kept\ncold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I hope all of you are hungry.&quot; Deemos said before walking inside of\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; base with mech fluid dripping off of his fingers.

Just a small bit that fixes it\nall\n&gt; &gt; up,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; huh?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * Iron Raptor nodded but didn&#39;t turn and watch Arcangle and Silver\nSting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; leave, listening but also watching her finger trace small designs on\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; glass of the window.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her mind was still reeling about Arcangles plan, thinking of just what\n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; needed to do to pull it off smoothly. She already knew that they\nneeded\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; repair the Ark and get those engines set up and online before they\neven\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thought of placing the Autobots in it. Not to mention they needed Iris\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make up the proper auto-pilot system for the flight into the Earth&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; orbit,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something that was going to be the toughest part of this mission yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iron Raptor shook her head slightly, there was so much to do and so\nmuch\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worry about. In all her life she had never been so busy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But then Felines voice broke through her concentration, tilting her\nhead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slightly in the fembots direction as she listened to her speak.*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I don&#39;t need to forgive you for anything, Feline. You have problems\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we&#39;ll just have to work around them until you bring them to an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * She then watched Feline exit the room in the corner of her eye, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; turning her head and looking out of the window again with a sigh. Her\n&gt; mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going back to the mission at hand as well as the one they had to get\n&gt; down\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as soon as they got back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Either mission couldn&#39;t be too difficult, she had to admit that there\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fair amount of events that could go wrong but they would work around\n&gt; them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But then she heard Felines dainty foot-steps again, wondering just why\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fembot was returning for. But once she heard Feline speak she knew.*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Room 6-20 and just up from the hallway where the armory is located.\n&gt; You\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t miss it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * Iron Raptor had actually paid attention to where Prowl had taken her\n&gt; &gt; after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her Alliance ordeal, looking at the details of the rooms she passed\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; making note of their locations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But now there were more important things to worry about, like thinking\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the condition of Tavatron and Dinobot when they found them. Thinking\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how close they would be to the Alliance base and how attack was more\n&gt; &gt; likely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then anything else, lucky as hell if they weren&#39;t.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though, as her finger traced another pattern in the glass she felt a\n&gt; hand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slip around her but knew whom it was. She would always know Prowl&#39;s\n&gt; touch,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the feel of it nearly made her forget that he had gotten her back\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an insult that had gone just a little bit too far.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iron Raptor&#39;s optics narrowed at the thought of that insult, knowing\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she really wasn&#39;t angry about it but a woman&#39;s weight was a touchy\nthing\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she didn&#39;t like it made fun of. Though, her revenge for that insult\n&gt; wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But when she heard Prowl speak and looked up seeing her own reflection\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the glass but actually looking at Prowls. *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Yes. I&#39;m going with Arangles plan. It&#39;s fairly clever if you think\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it long enough, and has a very high possibility of actually working.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * Her mind was wondering again from the thoughts about their missions,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually dwelling on the feel of his touch instead of them. But then\nshe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shook her head slightly to clear it, reminding herself that she was\n&gt; still\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the process of making him pay for that insult.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iron Raptor looked down at his hand on her waist and then up at him,\nher\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expression being that of a look that reflected her words. *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; And just what do you think YOU&#39;RE doing?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * She put a hand on her hip and the other on his that was on her\nwaist,\n&gt; &gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fingers working to pry each one of his from the grasp her had on her.\n*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; &#39;Heavy as a TRUCK,&#39; huh? Well, you think you can just come over here\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; touch me like this? I think not.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * At the last word she finally pried his hand free and let it fall,\nthen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taking a few steps away from him and walked over to the projector and\n&gt; &gt; turned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it off. Making sure that she swung her hips a bit while she had walked\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tease him. *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; You&#39;re going to pay for the insult, Mister. And this is your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; punishment.until you learn you lesson.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * And it was, that he wasn&#39;t allowed to touch her for a little bit. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course she would stop once he learned his lesson, slag knew that she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to keep this up forever. *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
