The \nmission \n&gt; was a simple one. Get the clone into Maximal hands.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the next part however, Wolf swallowed hard, gulping. Of course \n&gt; he would never let his fear show.

He would have to talk to \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor later about informing him of things before hand. On the \n&gt; &gt; other hand it was, perhaps, a tactful decision. Hydras might have \n&gt; &gt; simply blasted the bot earlier.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wolfenstein. The foolish bot returns from his escapade with \n&gt; &gt; failure... I should melt you to scrap right now for your insolent \n&gt; &gt; behaviour, but I have a better idea.&quot; a small smile catches the \n&gt; &gt; edges of Hydras&#39; mouth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Maxima dear, begin work on the Blackstrom clone.&quot; Hydras says \nwith \n&gt; &gt; a short glance back at the female predacon. &quot;Implant a virus into \n&gt; &gt; the clone to lay dormant until they try to reformat the \nBlackstorm \n&gt; &gt; clone and return her to Nightlight.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Predacon commander turns back to the newly returned \n&gt; &gt; Wolfenstein. &quot;Ah yes, now for your part. It is your job to escort \n&gt; &gt; the clone on a recon mission which vectors nearest to the Maximal \n&gt; &gt; base. I&#39;m sure their sensors will pick you up. It will be your \njob \n&gt; &gt; to make sure the clone gets into their hands safely, and I don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; mean just hand it to them. Make it real, trick them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, and one more thing.&quot; Hydras&#39;s hand slides into his arm and a \n&gt; &gt; spiked semi-sphere forms around his hand - Hydras Fusion Cannon - \n&gt; &gt; and points it at the new but old Predacon.
