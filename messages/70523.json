He is quick to kneel down to Vestige, and picks him up gently. He was not about to leave him behind.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They&#39;re comming, Vestige, hold on, we may not be able to escape the horde, but we can lose them long enough to get our bearings.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson takes his chances and prepares to get off the rail car, hoping to at least get Vestige to a safe place, even if it were just for a few moments, to assemble a reasonable strategy to get rid of the horde, perhaps even vanquish them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There has to be some way to stop them. Everything has a weakness, it&#39;s just a matter of finding it. No radar, no sonar, looks like my eyes will have to do.&quot;\n&gt;\n\nVesige stirred again as Tuscon talked, his voice was weak as he spoke,\n&quot;They are trying to corrupt this world.&quot; He paused as if trying to\ndredge up enough energy to continue speaking, &quot;When they arrived\neverything . . . . changed.&quot;\n\nEven as Vestige talked the car slid into a dark tunnel the buzzing\noutside could be heard still getting louder as the insects tried to\nfollow the car inside, although the width of the tunnel was slowing\nthem down a little.\n\nThe car pulled into a dimly lit station and the magnacar door slid\nopen to display an empty platform. The platform was pretty standard as\nplatforms go, gun metal grey walls, steel beams acting as pillars were\npositioned evenly at different parts of the room.\n\n&quot;TUSCON!&quot; came Rodimus&#39; voice. &quot;WHERE ARE YOU TUSCON, I CAN&#39;T SEE YOU!&quot;\n\nIt echoed throught the station. A look at Vestige showed him to be\nunconscious again.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
