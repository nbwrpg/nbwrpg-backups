He brought a hand up to hold his chin, &quot;Hmmmming&quot; every few \nseconds.\n\n&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; Hiss asked in delight.  &quot;I did do a good job, \ndidn&#39;t I?&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;d he do!  I bet he buthcered my once great looks, right?&quot; the former \nBreakdown yelled, getting up and looking around for something that would \nreflect his image.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think so.  If anything I feel stronger.  What did you do to us, \nexactly, Hiss?&quot; Scavenger asked, rubbing his hands on his face, noticing \nsignificant changes.\n\n&quot;Basically I added some weapons, changed parts of your face, added on armor, \nmodified your alternate modes, and added extra power cells inside your frame \nso you will perform 60% better than usual.  Oh, and I increased your height \nby one foot.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, Pyro, I wasn&#39;t provided with much energon.&quot;\n\n&quot;We have to conserve our energon, Hiss.&quot; Dark One remarked.  &quot;Anyway, \nBreakdown and Scavenger are your old names, you need new ones.  How about \nMortar and Scrounge?&quot;\n\n&quot;I liked Breakdown better.&quot;\n\n&quot;And I liked Scavenger better.  Scrounge sounds like the name of some Earth \npet.&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up!  You&#39;ll do as I say.  You&#39;re much stronger.  We just need an \nopportunity to test your newfound abilities.  Will there be any changes to \nOblitertron, Hiss?&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;ll be a little stronger but not by a marginal amount.  If we want \nOblitertron stronger I&#39;d have to specifically work on that area, not those \ntwo.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, well.&quot; Pyro said with a grin.  &quot;When do I get to be upgraded?&quot;\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t need to so you won&#39;t.&quot; Dark One said.\n\n"}}
