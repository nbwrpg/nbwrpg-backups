She could feel the techno part taking over the organic \npart of her.  She was loosing her edge along with the rest f the Maximals.  \nShe needed a break. She needed to rekindle the owl in herself. &quot;uh, mind if \nI join you hunting? I proise not to go after the same rabbit that your \nchasing.&quot; She smiled slightly.\n\n---Original Message---\nFrom:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\nDate: Wed Jul 5, 2000 6:48pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\nLunarpine looked up at Shadow Wing, he could sense her emotions, like\na mother who failed to protect her eggs from preditors.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going hunting. I need to get away for a bit. All this\ninactivity&#39;s dulling my senses. I can see it in the other Maximals,\nthey&#39;ve lost thier edge on this planet. We were given these senses to\nadapt to this planet, not to colinize it.&quot; The thought of technology\nwinning out over nature sickened him. Maybe being one of this planets\nnatural creatures for a time distorted the yechnological side of him,\nmaybe not. Either way the Maximals were inadvertently doing what they\nset out to prevent.\n\n&quot;We need to stay sharp Wing, back at the Ark I smelled something,\neven the sensors didn&#39;t notice. Nobody noticed it except me. If our\nleaders rely on technology that much then we&#39;ll all end up looking\nlike the Ark. I for one wouldn&#39;t want that.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
