One never could tell when an ambush was to be sprung!\nShe looked at Prowl to see if she could tell his reactions to the surroundings by his body language, it was then that she saw his muscles moving beneath his plumage. Apparently by the tone of them and their bulk he either worked out or the constant Pred and Alliance battles kept him fit, either conclusion would work but she was impressed...also the fact that he could even carry a being the size of her.\nIron Raptor smiled at the comment he had made when they had first landed, that also triggered the comment that he had made to her when she had first been introduced to the Beast Wars. In simple words, when she had fell on him by cause of Rampage.\nShe shook her head as she followed him deeper into the forest, he was a piece of work!\nIron Raptor then regarded his skills, obviously he had been in the Beast Wars longer then she had been and was known for his skills.\nWhy didn&#39;t Liono decide to make him some marked rank, like second or even third...before she joined?\nThe answer eluded her but she knew that he was a very good soldier and obviously was very skillful.\nShe nodded and sighed as she followed Prowl, hearing his words. She always did like the sound of his voice, for some reason or another.*\n\n&quot; Yes, I guess so.&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
