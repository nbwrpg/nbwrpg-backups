He followed the cords and made sure that they were not\nrunning to anything vital.  Then he carefully removed them.\n\nAs he was leaving the room he accidentally bumped a pannel in the\nwall, some wiring fell out of the wall.  It looked like this had never\nbeen used for anything, they had plastic insulator caps on them.  So\nhe these wires as well.\n\nHe returned to the room with the computer and got to work making final\npreparations to get the computer system online.\n\nOOC: Do they have a power generator?\n\n\nOn Mon, 18 Oct 2004 13:14:43 -0700 (PDT), robert riley\n&lt;bustercross365@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:  The interior is as follows: the control area at the front of the ship\n&gt; is about the size of a bedroom.  There is a hall passing two rooms of\n&gt; bedroom size, and actual bedroom and storage room.  At the end of the hall\n&gt; there is another average sized room, that is the engine and power area, the\n&gt; back wall is all intruments and access panels.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Hellplague:\n&gt;  \n&gt; The Sweep commander followed after Celeron, mostly to make sure he was doing\n&gt; what he was supposed to.

He decided to get to work on the network hub and leave\n&gt; the for later.  The hub had not been damaged severely and most of it\n&gt; was repaired by simple rewiring, but he still needed more parts.  So\n&gt; he went out of the room and this time started exploring further into\n&gt; the ship than he had before.....\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: How big is this ship?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;NOW...
