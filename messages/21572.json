He laughed.  The side \nthe Oblitercons were against were utterly pathetic in the battle.  Their so \ncalled leader was defeated in the first few cycles.  No, that side would not \nbe a good one to side with. \n\nVehement activated his comm. unit, speaking into the device embedded in his \nforearm computer.  &quot;This is Vehement.  KitKat, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve shown that \nyou aren&#39;t a reliable, since you ran at the first sign of danger.  If you or \nany of your members attempt to come onto my territory, my defenses and \nsoldiers will shoot to kill, and will not take prisoners.&quot;\n\nHe smiled, deactivating the comm. unit, looking to his two men.  &quot;Sun Crusher \nand Reflector, follow me.  We have work to do.&quot; the Archbishop said as he \nstood, heading down a hall and towards the nearest access hatch.\n\n"}}
