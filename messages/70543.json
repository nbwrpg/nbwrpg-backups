You can drive me to where we need to go, I don&#39;t mind.  And sometimes, t=\r\nrust just comes from the heart.  And a heart that trusts, is a heart that&#39;s=\r\n compassionate, and a heart that feels compassion is one that has true powe=\r\nr.  Nothing can overpower that, nothing.  That&#39;s what I keep telling everyo=\r\nne back at Autobot Headquarters.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you have powerful we=\r\napons, if you don&#39;t have what truely matters, then you have hardly anything=\r\n at all.  You have more than that to go around old friend, I can feel it.  =\r\nNow, let&#39;s get you to your repair chamber. Oh, if you feel weak, just let m=\r\ne know and I&#39;ll take over.&quot;\n\nHe waits for Vestige to get in. \n\n--- In nbwrp=\r\ng@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson narrows his optics. A bit un nerved, but not frightened enoug=\r\nh to turn back and run. Instead, he would press on, and while doing so, whi=\r\nle holding Vestige in one arm, as his strength could allow him, with the ot=\r\nher arm, he reaches for a spare emergency canister of energon which he had =\r\nsaved for dire need. This was that dire need. He opens it, and holds it for=\r\n Vestige to drink from it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I don&#39;t know where we can find a repai=\r\nr chamber, but this should help you find just a little bit more energy. It&#39;=\r\ns my last reserve, but you need this more than I do. Here, drink, it&#39;s ener=\r\ngon, and it will help you keep some energy in your body.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the sa=\r\nme time, Tucson was keeping an ear out for the metallic spiders and insects=\r\n. His pace steady, as he continues to walk forward, keeping his headlights =\r\na blaze to light his way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;ll get through this Vestige, I promis=\r\ne you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vestige&#39;s systems flicker and sputter as Tuscon feeds him the =\r\nenergon\n&gt; and then with a small burst of energy his optics brighten. &quot;Thank=\r\n you\n&gt; Tuscon.&quot; he said, his voice horse and raspy but clearer than before.=\r\n\n&gt; It is obvious that although Vestige is doing a little better he is\n&gt; sti=\r\nll in need of repairs. For some reason his self repair circuits do\n&gt; not se=\r\nem to be healing as effeciently as they should.\n&gt; \n&gt; He nods as Tuscon prom=\r\nised to get them through, &quot;I . . . I don&#39;t know\n&gt; why, but I feel as if I c=\r\nan trust you.&quot; he says, his voice weak but\n&gt; still clear. With a shaky arm =\r\nhe points further down the path that\n&gt; Tuscon is taking them, &quot;There is whe=\r\nre I must go, down there. The\n&gt; chamber where I need to be sits there.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The direction that Vestige points is simply a long hallways, that\n&gt; after=\r\n maybe 30 yards or so bends around a corner and apparently\n&gt; continues on. =\r\nThere are doors on either side of the hall at different\n&gt; points, and light=\r\ns on the cieling illuminate the hall ahead. So far\n&gt; there is no evidence o=\r\nf insects, and whatever scraping noise that was\n&gt; heard before seems to be =\r\nmuch further away.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vestige climbes unsteadily to his feet, and much li=\r\nke an old man\n&gt; attempts to hobble slowly down the hall, seemingly focused =\r\non the task\n&gt; ahead. &quot;Come.&quot; he says, his voice weak, but now filled with a=\r\n grim\n&gt; determination.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
