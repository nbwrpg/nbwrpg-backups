His wounds were healing\n&gt; successfully and he&#39;d soon be ready to fight. He looked outside seeing the\n&gt; other three chambers were empty. The Eaglebot stretched his wings far as he\n&gt; could inside the cramped tank. He didn&#39;t know what happened he just knew\n&gt; that things were either better than he thought or as bad as he had feared.\n&gt; &quot;Computer, who is present in this base?&quot; he asked softly almost hoping it\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t respond.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Slayer is scanning on the bridge.&quot; it responded in an echoing mettalic tone\n&gt; fit for the voice of a hollow unfealing machine.\n\n\n\n"}}
