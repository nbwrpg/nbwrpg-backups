Shokaract is bombed by missiles and cringes. He\ntransforms to robot mode and aims his gattling cannon at Havoc, firing off\nhis missiles at Havoc. Burning Hammer kept dodging Serge and was getting\nclose to him again. Stronghold and Blender attacked from behind. Burning\nHammer swiped them off but was nailed with a missile from Serge. He slowly\nrose again. Serge reverts back to beast mode and tries to stomp Burning\nHammer, who was a small bot. Burning Hammer rolls out of the way and rises\nto full. Blender sliced across him with his saw, but he still stands. He\nfires off a missile that blows an aproaching Rizopas away. Stranato and\nInzola enter the battle. Stranato fires at Serge. Serge is hit by the shots\nbut doesn&#39;t flinch much. Doom Ice throws a grenade that blows Stranato up.\nInzola fires and knocks Doom Ice over Serge leaves a puddle of mech fluid on\nthe ground from his neck and moves toward Burning Hammer. Burning Hammer\ndodges all attempts to squash him and fires at Doom Ice. Doom Ice manages to\nmove in time. Inzola cartwheels away from the shots from Shokaract. Deemos\nslowly sneaks around everyone to try and get a clear shot at Burning Hammer.\nInzola rols into Serge and he knocks her over with his tail. Burning Hammer\nknocks Stronghold over and blasts Blender down...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, October 13, 2000 6:12 PM\nSubject: Re: Enemy Fire\n\n\n&gt; DevilDuer isn&#39;t at the battle, Alloran.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/Havoc/Repressor/DevilDuer/The Oblitercons/Bloodystrike::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus looks around at the battle, realizing that DevilDuer, Battera,\n&gt; Voluis, and Cybershark hadn&#39;t come back. He flies up, looking down at\n&gt; Rage as the monster continues to attack his troops.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If she stays conscious, lure her to the enemy,&quot; he says into his\n&gt; comm-link to Feline, about to swoop down on Deemos and Shockaract\n&gt; when a bot flies into view.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Who is the owner of this base?&quot; the bot asks. He was a jet. Two\n&gt; rocket launchers along with several maching guns were mounted onto\n&gt; his wings, and his bottom had a hatch that looked like it could drop\n&gt; bombs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I am,&quot; Zardus says, flying up to him and looking him over.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Good,&quot; the bot says, &quot;My name is Havoc. Me and my troops will be\n&gt; joining you for the time being. We will need use of some facilities\n&gt; after the battle.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus nods, looking at Havoc. &quot;Excellent.... That is the enemy,&quot; he\n&gt; points down to Shockaract&#39;s group, &quot;Except for him,&quot; he says as he\n&gt; points at Burning Hammer.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Turning around without a word, Havoc dives down at Shockaract&#39;s group\n&gt; with record speed, pulling up seconds before hitting the ground and\n&gt; flying over them, missiles streaming toward Shockaract. &quot;War\n&gt; Machines, attack the enemy,&quot; he says into his comm-link, climbing for\n&gt; another dive.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Repressor flies into the scene, swirling around to face Shockaract&#39;s\n&gt; group. Going forward, the chopper shoots missiles at them from side\n&gt; mounted missile launchers, aiming at Jetstorm.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Bloodystrike ducks under a shot, gaining altitude and replacing his\n&gt; missile launcher with a rifle.\n&gt;\n&gt; He aims quickly, firing off three shots at Diskus.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Dark One swears, recieving Zardus&#39; transmission (the one about the\n&gt; battle). He looks at Tarantulus. &quot;You can have this pod. But we will\n&gt; meet again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes off into the air and flies off toward the Alliance base, the\n&gt; rest of the Oblitercons following him, also having recieved Zardus&#39;\n&gt; transmission.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer frowns, waiting for the pod to get done scanning. This was\n&gt; wasting time, and time was valuable right now....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Diskus flies straight up and avoids the missiles.
