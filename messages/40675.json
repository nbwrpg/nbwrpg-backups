Tankor and Kyle, stop it, \nnow. Kyle, please explain how Mustex got beyond Alliance shields. The \nonly post from you dealing with how he got there was filled with \nextreme moding, and I didn&#39;t see another one. Mustex can&#39;t magically \nteleport, so I can&#39;t see a logical way that he would be walking \naround Alliance Island.\n&gt; \n&gt; And everyone who&#39;s been disrespectful to other RPGers, please stop. \nI&#39;ve deleted all the polls I think are offending, like the &quot;Who&#39;s the \nworse RPGer&quot; one. Please don&#39;t make any more.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/FZ::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus nods. &quot;Of course.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The shields flash back to full strength, but a section in front of \nChaostaur fades off, letting him in if he wanted.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There&#39;s a section of the shields open, Orchestra,&quot; Zardus says \nover the comm, &quot;You can enter through that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I have some matters to take care of first,&quot; he transmits to \nFrostbite at the same time as sending a transmission to Orchestra, &quot;I \nmay be late.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns, nodding at Daemos. &quot;Allright. I&#39;ll contact him. My troops \nwill get themselves to the IGL, but thanks for the offer.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He watches Daemos fly off, making a mental note to send a \ntransmission to this new commander as soon as he was done with \nChaostaur.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; FZ looks over Najah. &quot;Very good, Najah. The IGL is starting very \nsoon. You can take a shuttle if you wish.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
