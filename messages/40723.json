Like the\n&gt;rules\n&gt; &gt; &gt;say, unless you get Zardus&#39; permission for that silly story, the\n&gt;Alliance\n&gt; &gt; &gt;never did anything to Mustex, Stallex, Rhesus or the Carnitrons.\n&gt;Oh, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;if\n&gt; &gt; &gt;you really want to write stuff that&#39;s actually worth reading(And\n&gt;no, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;didn&#39;t enjoy your silly little story) then you can always look for\n&gt;some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;advice from Jeff, sometimes me, KSL and a few others most likely.\n&gt;You&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; &gt;need to gain a more complex vocabulary and more understanding of\n&gt;things.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ok, everything I just said probably sounds really weird right now,\n&gt;but jume\n&gt; &gt; &gt;it.  Speak up if you really wanna **** with the Abyssian Badass!\n&gt;And,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;everybody, since there&#39;s a lot of OOCing going on, I suggest you\n&gt;be like me\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and learn to balance OOCing and ICing by putting them both into\n&gt;one post.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;*Speeds off on his Harley* =)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;BIC:   Decadel continued to roam the halls and corridors of\n&gt;Maximal City.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &quot;Errr...must find.....somebody to enslave....soon!&quot;\n&gt;Decadel said\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Decadel walked on, pondering who he should enslave.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; T�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse\n&gt; &gt; http://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
