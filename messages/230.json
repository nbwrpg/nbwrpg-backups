Liono, on the other hand....\n\nShe walks over to Iron Raptor. &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Blue Stinger. Nice to meet you!&quot; :)\n\n\nKey lands behind Liono. &quot;Hey, love.&quot; She says, putting an arm around his \nwaist, &quot;I found a nice valley. Would you like to go there with me?&quot;  :)\n\n\nSona and Antagony bend over the thing that they are working on. They were \nalmost finished... :)\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
