Perceptor&#39;s message bellowed \n&gt; and he saw the anger in Rodimus&#39;s eyes..&quot;Yes Prime do it use your anger I love \n&gt; it!&quot; As Rodimus lept off at incredible speed He shot fire from his mouth,the \n&gt; two tails lashing out toslice open the bot, his eyes shot out the lasers and \n&gt; his shoulder blasters rang out 15 shots all right onto the coming Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: I hope you dont mind a little CC. I posted for a little damage to Hydras, \n&gt; &gt; but nothing critical.\n&gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus brought his arms down in a &quot;x&quot; formation, forcing the swords, and \n&gt; &gt; Hydras&#39; arms down. Rodimus then grabbed Hydras around the wrist with his left \n&gt; &gt; hand. He dug his saw which was in the place of his right hand, down into \n&gt; Hydras&#39; \n&gt; &gt; arm. With his balance on his left arm, Roddy flipped both legs up to double \n&gt; &gt; dropkick Hydras. After hitting this he back flips away and to his feet.\n&gt; &gt; Just then Perceptor is heard over the comm system.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus stands motionless, and optics look empty, like all hope had been lost. \n&gt; &gt; But then...\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Enough of this! Maximals, kill these bastards in cold fluid!\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; face shows nothing but hate. He grits his teeth together, while \n&gt; letting \n&gt; &gt; out an yell that could destroy an audio receptor. He is almost fomeing at the \n&gt; &gt; mouth, with the mixed mech fluids that leak from it. The anger causes his &gt; \n&gt; normally blue optic sensors to turn a crimson red. His gaze locked on Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus empties his mouth, spitting all the energon and other mech fluids from \n&gt; &gt; his mouth at Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: On this day, Galvatron, I&#39;ll finally KILL YOU!!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus transformes to car mode and fires his propulsion rockets.

How could they?! She was a mother, a good bot, she didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; deserve this. They targeted her just to get at Rodimus...\n&gt; &gt; Kup drops to the floor.\n&gt; &gt; Kup: Cam, you may have to help with that baby more if you can. Her father is \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; commander, and she just lost her mother...\n&gt; &gt; Kup looks up at the picture of Perceptor on the monitor.\n&gt; &gt; Kup: Rodimus will lose all control now. I fear that are leader is gone, and a \n&gt; &gt; killing machine is in his place. I actually pitty those Predacons now, for \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus will do to them.
