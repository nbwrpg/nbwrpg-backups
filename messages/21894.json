She was feeling \ndrained, but didn&#39;t want to take any riskes untill Veratis had one \nhim over. She was starting to sweat under her fur. This was taking \nmore out of her than she had planned on. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Razor Claw left his feat and his shield dissapaited, he again hit \nthe \n&gt; wall with a thud. &quot;What weapon is this?&quot; His confusion was matched \n&gt; only by his inability to move.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine knew that she couldn&#39;t keep this up forever so he decided \n&gt; to end the fight. He charged forward and put his claws to the \n&gt; Raptor. &quot;You can let him go now, he&#39;s not going anywhere.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Razorclaw was pinned and without his feat to ground him he couldn&#39;t \n&gt; activate his shield. &quot;Ganging up on me? I thought Maximals fought \n&gt; fair.&quot; he stared at Lunarpine hoping for the chance to escape.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;To bad we aint your average maximal.&quot; Lunarpine stared right back \nat \n&gt; him, The Raptor knew he wasn&#39;t kidding and looked away. &quot;You win, \nI&#39;m \n&gt; your prisoner.&quot; The Predacon thought he was a POW, he didn&#39;t know \n&gt; that Veratis wasn&#39;t part of the war.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis stepped forward, &quot;Let him down Lunarpine, He&#39;s not \n&gt; responsible for his actions.&quot; Lunarpine let go and stepped \naside. &quot;I \n&gt; think I have some explaining to do.&quot; He started his origin speech \nand \n&gt; Razor Claw listened.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Did I send you information on Veratis, Foxfingers, and Lady Hawk \n&gt; yet?)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She entered into Razar Claw&#39;s mind and saw him put up his \nshields. \n&gt; &gt; She still could use her abilities against him. She changed into \n&gt; &gt; griffen mode without realizing it. She concentrated and pushed \nhim \n&gt; &gt; against the wall with her mind.

He remained still, waiting to see what Ice did next.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine saw the break in the action and took advantage. He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformed to his half wolf stage and dashed into the battle. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Foxfingers rolled out and began scampering toward Lunarpine. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine grabbed the fox and pulled him to safety.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Veratis watched as the stalemate continued. The virus seemed to \n&gt; &gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; given Razor Claw extra abilities too. He catalogued each \nmovement \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; each technique. Both were changed thanks to him, and both were \n&gt; &gt; deadly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
