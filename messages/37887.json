The Predacon attackers had him outnumbered, outgunned, \nand outout of luck. various shots struck the Eagle in flight sending \nhim into a tailspin. He transformed to bot mode turning, ready to \nfire at the pursuing bots. In the distance he saw the smoke as the \nTrainers base burned to the ground. He saw Slayer, even through the \ndisguise he remembered him. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You called me a traitor then bring this upon our unit?&quot; The bot \nwas alone, afraid, looking for someone to blame for the damage. &quot;You \nbrought them here, you dropped the defences, you destroyed everything \nwe had hoped to learn. He leapt in the air flapping his wings to push \nhimself higher. The shots were hitting him hard but in his state of \nmind he could&#39;t have cared. He lifted his talons fireing 25  shots \nfrom his talons, and two missles from his left arm at the Trainer in \ndisguise.\n\n\n"}}
