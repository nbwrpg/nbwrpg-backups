She went over and printed out the analysis \nthat the computer had worked out so far.  She studied the DNA \nsignature and chemical compositions of the spark.  She walked around \nthe room, looking at the print outs and studying them.  She noticed \nwhere the DNA was missing for the correct skin pigmentation.  She \nalso noticed that the spark, even though it had energy, it was \nlifeless.  She looked up from the papers and stared at the the wall. \n\n&quot;That means then, the body must have a remote control to it some how. \nOr the brain was programmed to act a certain way.  But somewhere, \nthere had to be a remote control for it.&quot;(let me know if this theory \nis correct on the clones. I don&#39;t know a whole lot about cloning, so \nif I get this wrong, please correct me.)\n\nShe studied the DNA again and wondered if there was something she was \nmissing.  The only thing that was really missing, was the body.  \nShe wondered that if she had the whole body to analysize, she shook \nher head and disregaurded that thought.  The body was in almost \ntotally destroyed and what ever she would have wanted for study was \ngone.  She then turned and looked at the spark.  It sparkled a bit \nunder all the lazars. She sighed and sat back down, waiting for \nDestructor to some and tell her the replicator was finished.\n\n\n\n"}}
