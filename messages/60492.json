The bounty hunter roused around to find himself being kissed a second time.  The minion breaks the kiss, a satisfied look on her face.\n&quot;Did you enjoy that?&quot; Malice said in a deep, unforgiving voice,&quot;cause that may be the last one you get.&quot;\nThe minion was genuinly suprised, even as Malice delivered a punishing blow to her exposed abdomine.  She stood, then doubled over, gasping for breath.  malice sood and stretched his back.  He had his sinister grin as he approached, and then charged.  Body checking Hellplague, Malice used the momentuum to punch, kick and slash, with his claws and limbs.  Hellplague came to rest near a ridge over looking an enormous energon deposit.  She looke over the edge down into the glowing chasm, and as Malice charged again, got an idea.  Just before he got to her, Hellplague jumped up and over the hunter, and kicked hard, sending him to the chasm floor.  Malice fell, tumbled, and came o rest, impaled with giant shards of energon piercing his body.  He rests motionless, before the rest of the fighters to see.
