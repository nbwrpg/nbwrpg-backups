Jotunn be ready.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Grimlock closes the link and realizes that he hasn&#39;t radioed  ahead to\n&gt; tell Atlantis Air Traffic control who he is.

Lots of em too. Sweep&#39;s\n&gt; were everywhere. Maximals were out numbered and out gunned fast. City\n&gt; tore apart bad. Cyclonus and Scourge, leaders, went for Rodimus Prime.\n&gt; Rodimus fought Cyclonus alone on near island. He lose. Cyclonus make\n&gt; somekind of light beam. Take Matrix from Rodimus.
