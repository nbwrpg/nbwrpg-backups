She was to hurt in the spark.  She \ndissapointed herself and worse, dissapointed him.  She wished she had \nbeen scrapped by the pred.  \nShe spoke softly, &quot; I can&#39;t transform into my beast mode.  I damaged \na wing. I can&#39;t fly for a while. Go one without me. I&#39;ll make it back \nto the base.&quot;\n\nShe really didn&#39;t want him to go. But at the same time, she was very \nashamed of herself and her actions.  Once again, her emotions got her \nin trouble.  And now she worried that she might loose a friend as a \nresult.\n\n\n"}}
