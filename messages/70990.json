You start your po=\r\nst with Tuscon in the middle\nof a very tense stand off with him being defen=\r\nsless and you end it with him\nbeing on the way to the Ark.  Basically you m=\r\nade no allowance for someone,\npresumably Hydras, to stop Tuscon from leavin=\r\ng - which is what most evil bad\nguys would do.\n\nIn message #70973 the deman=\r\nd was that the Maximals and Autobots lay down\nthier weapons if they wanted =\r\nNightlight to live.\n\nIn message #70975 Tuscon gives the order for all the M=\r\naximals and such to\ncomply. And in that post you write that Night Shift sub=\r\nspaces his weapon, as\nStraight Shot transforms into her robot mode, disarmi=\r\nng her own weaponry as\nwell.\n\nIn message #70978 Tuscon lays down his weapon=\r\n and in Message #70987 Kup and\nTalon do the same.\n\nThis would mean that all=\r\n of the Maximals and Autobots in that area are now\nweaponless, and so prett=\r\ny much defenceless. At the same time much of the\nPredacon army is standing =\r\nthere, either in front of them, or flying over\nhead. I had posted that the =\r\npreds were picking up those discarded weapons\nwhile other were watching.\n\nH=\r\nowever in message #70988 Tuscon is able to pick up a weapon, aim it at\nsome=\r\none, then with the help of the other Maximals choose not to fire, they\nare =\r\nable to talk back and forth a few times, salute each other and then\nTuscon =\r\ndrives off with no one stopping him.\n\nHow do we reconcile all of that? Sinc=\r\ne you already had Tuscon sending\nmessages out and your characters already r=\r\nesponding, if we had someone stop\nyou in the middle of all of that, it woul=\r\nd make it confusing as to what\nhappened and what didn&#39;t.\n\nTuscon should not=\r\n have been able to point a weapon, talk, transform and\ndrive away with no r=\r\nesponse. Does that make sense? Anything we post in the\nmiddle of that would=\r\n only confuse things worse.\n\nWe might need some editing. Like Tuscon just d=\r\noes the first part of that,\nbut not leave yet. Allow the rest of us to post=\r\n a response first, then if it\nis reasonable based on the responses he leave=\r\ns?\n\nAgain, not trying to to be critical, but keeping it fair.\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n=\r\nOn Sat, Jan 22, 2011 at 7:58 AM, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; OOC: I did an edit but I guess I&#39;ll add Uproar back in.

By the way,\n&gt; this =\r\nis the part where you take my place and win the war.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With that transmi=\r\ntted, Tucson accerates as he kicks up dirt under his\n&gt; enormous tires. Now =\r\nthinking about Legacy, was turning on the short fuse\n&gt; once again. He sends=\r\n another message.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You leave me no choice Legacy. No choice but to oust=\r\n you myself.

Evidently the Ark shielding was still in p=\r\nlace,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; it was not allowing anyone in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus frowned, &quot;Up=\r\nroar! Get over here! If we are going to get back in,\n&gt; &gt; then we need to wo=\r\nrk together. That shield is supposed to hold off all\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Predacon for=\r\nces.

His body was powerfully built\n&gt; &gt; and heavily=\r\n armored. He looked to turn into a lion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The third was Ramulus (htt=\r\np://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ramulus) who had like the\n&gt; &gt; others been on patrol for=\r\n a while, surveying the area and trying to keep\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; free from Predacon=\r\n invasion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They also come up beside Rodimus, Leo II, obviously the =\r\nleader of the\n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; two, &quot;What now sir?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus looked at Qu=\r\nickstride and Uproar, &quot;Well let&#39;s get out of sight,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; then we can d=\r\niscuss it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *Meanwhile Inside the Ark:*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor had recei=\r\nved Tuscon&#39;s message and sent attempted to send a\n&gt; message\n&gt; &gt; to Lord eld=\r\ner, however at the moment there was no answer from the elder\n&gt; &gt; Maximal.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the same time Legacy was still standing in the med lab along with=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; others, his single optic glowing in the darkness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It woul=\r\nd seem that Nightlight&#39;s vital systems are being held at minimal\n&gt; &gt; levels=\r\n.&quot; Legacy said as he directed his gaze to the wall panel nearest\n&gt; &gt; Nightl=\r\night. A small light blinked, indicating her spark was still online,\n&gt; &gt; but=\r\n that there was not enough power to reboot her systems.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turned t=\r\no look at the others, his face glowing in the darkness, lit by\n&gt; &gt; his own =\r\noptic, and the glowing bar on his chest plate. He raised his\n&gt; right\n&gt; &gt; ha=\r\nnd in the air, the one with the arm cannon on it and begin to emit\n&gt; light\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; from it, much like a flash light or a beacon so that the room was\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nlluminated. He casually looked around, &quot;Perhaps we could locate a back\n&gt; ou=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; or reserve power system . . . &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy paused as Tuscon&#39;s mes=\r\nsage came in.

And in that =\r\npost you write that Night Shift subspaces his weapon, as Straight Shot tran=\r\nsforms into her robot mode, disarming her own weaponry as well. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;In message #70978 Tuscon lays down his weapon and in Messa=\r\nge #70987 Kup and Talon do the same.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;This would m=\r\nean that all of the Maximals and Autobots in that area are now weaponless, =\r\nand so pretty much defenceless. At the same time much of the Predacon army =\r\nis standing there, either in front of them,=A0or flying over head. I had po=\r\nsted that the preds were picking up those discarded weapons while other wer=\r\ne watching. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;However in message #70988 Tuscon is=\r\n able to pick up a weapon, aim it at someone, then with the help of the oth=\r\ner Maximals choose not to fire, they are able to talk back and forth a few =\r\ntimes, salute each other and then Tuscon drives off with no one stopping hi=\r\nm. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;How do we reconcile all of that? Since you a=\r\nlready had Tuscon sending messages out and your characters already respondi=\r\nng, if we had someone stop you in the middle of all of that, it would make =\r\nit confusing as to what happened and what didn&#39;t. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Tuscon should not have been able to point a weapon, talk, transform =\r\nand drive away with no response. Does that make sense? Anything we post in =\r\nthe middle of that would only confuse things worse.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;We might need some editing. Like Tuscon just does the first part of that=\r\n, but not leave yet. Allow the rest of us to post a response first, then if=\r\n it is reasonable based on the responses he leaves? &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;Again, not trying to to be critical, but keeping it fair. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Preston&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail=\r\n_quote&quot;&gt;On Sat, Jan 22, 2011 at 7:58 AM, Sandy &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;magicquartz@...&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid;=\r\n MARGIN: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; PADDING-LEFT: 1ex&quot; class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;OOC=\r\n: I did an edit but I guess I&#39;ll add Uproar back in. I&#39;ll get his p=\r\nrofile up again soon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BIC:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tucson first hears Noctorro&#39;s=\r\n message. He knew he would have to send him a signal, and the best one to h=\r\nis knowledge, was the same message Rodimus had given, when activating the m=\r\natrix. So, quietly to Noctorro himself, he sends this com link, silently.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Light our Darkest Hour.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, he recieves Legacy&=\r\n#39;s transmission. Not at all thrilled with the results of course. His eye=\r\ns narrow coldly. His fists, clench up tightly as those all wheel drive syst=\r\nems begin to kick in fast. This often happened when he lost his temper, and=\r\n a short fuse takes nothing to ignite. Night Shift and Straight Shot could =\r\nsee what was about to happen. They knew his expression all too well. They l=\r\nook back to Kup.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot; I know that look on his face Kup, that&#39;=\r\ns not good.. Straight Shot, send a message ta Rodimus.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Straigh=\r\nt Shot nodds and sends her message.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Rodimus, we got a major pr=\r\noblemo here.. Remember Tucson&#39;s short fuse? Umm, well, that&#39;s commi=\r\nng back, with a vengeance.. He looks like he&#39;s just about ta erupt, big=\r\n time. OOH SCRAP, HE&#39;S TAKEN UP ONE OF HIS MISSILE CARRIERS! TUCSON NO!=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Tucson eyes his adversaries, while aiming his left missile c=\r\narrier toward them. He hears Straight Shot, and then realizes exactly what =\r\nwould happen if he were to fire that missile. He grits his teeth, and decid=\r\nes against it. The carrier is lowered.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Night Shift sighs in relief.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; Thank Primus. Tucson, sir, don&#39;t scare us like that.&quo=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tucson nodds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to. Something just c=\r\name over me. Yet, I am still not happy with Legacy&#39;s response. I have t=\r\no get back to the Ark before someone there is harmed.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Night S=\r\nhift nodds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; I think we can handle things here. Rodimus should=\r\n be on his way, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;s gonna bring help. Go on, you got =\r\nan Ark ta save.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He salutes Tucson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tucson looks back to=\r\n his adversaries.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot; Even though I&#39;d like nothing better th=\r\nan to vanquish your evil hold on this planet, I&#39;ve come to realize that=\r\n a far more critical situation has just arrisen. I am not giving up in cowa=\r\nrdice, and this is NOT the last you will see or hear of me.&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nHe transforms into his truck mode, and then pivots his many wheels, puts hi=\r\nmself in reverse to make a swing around, as back up signals sound, to safel=\r\ny bring his trailer around without touching anyone or anything. Then a hiss=\r\n of his hydraulics and he rolls away toward the Ark.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Rodimus,=\r\n the situation at the Ark has escalated. I am heading back to ensure the sa=\r\nftey of our comrades, and to personally oust Legacy myself. And as for your=\r\n assistance, I thank you profusely for your efforts. By the way, this is th=\r\ne part where you take my place and win the war.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;With that tra=\r\nnsmitted, Tucson accerates as he kicks up dirt under his enormous tires. No=\r\nw thinking about Legacy, was turning on the short fuse once again. He sends=\r\n another message.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;You leave me no choice Legacy. No choice but=\r\n to oust you myself. Keep in mind that you have but a limited time to chang=\r\ne your mind and comply with my demands! And if anyone is harmed in the mean=\r\n time, I WILL GIVE TO YOU WHICH YOU GIVE TO THEM!&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Outside, w=\r\nith Quickstride and Rodimus, Uproar trots over to them, and lies down in th=\r\ne grasses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; I&#39;m sorry, I lost it for a minute there.. Okay=\r\n, you need help, I&#39;m in, definitely. Whatever you want I&#39;ll do it.&=\r\nquot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Quickstride could not help but intercept Tucson&#39;s message=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Uh ohh, ohhhh boy. I hate that I&#39;m able ta do this. My e=\r\nars just caught a transmission from Tucson Prime. He&#39;s heading back, an=\r\nd judging by the tone of his voice, he&#39;s in a beast of a mood. Said som=\r\neth&#39;n about ousting Legacy the hard way. I hate ta see what that entail=\r\ns..&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Uproar grins kiddingly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;And I thought my tem=\r\nper was nasty. Sounds like he&#39;s got a shorter fuse than I do. Think we =\r\ncan stick around&#39;n watch him throttle that Legacy guy?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He =\r\nsays with a cat like grin. \n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40=\r\nyahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Super Cyclon=\r\nus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&gt; *Near to the Blac=\r\nk Tower:* \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; As Tuscon and the rest =\r\nlay down their weapons, the other soldiers move to&lt;br&gt;&gt; encircle the Max=\r\nimals and the Autobots.

Scourge just stepped away from the opening that Windlord fir=\r\ned out&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; from and let the shots go harmlessly into a bulkhead, scorc=\r\nhing it only&lt;br&gt;&gt; slightly.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; However that slight amount =\r\nof time allowed Windlord and Rat Trap time to&lt;br&gt;&gt; scurry further into t=\r\nheir crawl space and find an interior bulkhead to hide&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; behind.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Scrap!&quot; Scourge&#39;s voice said from the outside.=\r\n There was a pause and then,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Cyclonus, they have fled into th=\r\ne walls.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; There was another pause, and then Scourge c=\r\nhuckled, &quot;Of course.

In the darkness their=\r\n shapes could only be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; barely made out, but they looked like black =\r\nmetallic spiders, Hydras&#39; wall&lt;br&gt;&gt; guardians!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; (OOC=\r\n: Rat Trap may recognize them from last time.

He gives Quick=\r\nstride a quizzical look as the equine&lt;br&gt;&gt; Maximal sniffed him.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; (OOC: Quickstride&#39;s sniff reveals nothing wrong.)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; He was about to let Quickstride in on what he had planned when Uproar&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; appeared. Rodimus appears taken aback though by Uproar&#39;s concl=\r\nusion that it&lt;br&gt;&gt; was Legacy that had turned evil. While Rodimus didn&#=\r\n39;t know that much about&lt;br&gt;&gt; Legacy, having only seen him briefly whil=\r\ne being rescued and repaired, there&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; was nothing to hint that this =\r\nattack was Legacy&#39;s doing. He was about to say&lt;br&gt;&gt; something when U=\r\nproar ran towards the Ark to be let in . . .&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;KRACK POW=\r\n&lt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; As Uproar ran towards the Ark, what seemed like a rou=\r\nnd bolt of lightening&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; appeared, sending Uproar flying several yard=\r\ns through the air, to land&lt;br&gt;&gt; heavily on the ground! Evidently the Ark=\r\n shielding was still in place, and&lt;br&gt;&gt; it was not allowing anyone in.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus frowned, &quot;Uproar! Get over here! If we are goi=\r\nng to get back in,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; then we need to work together. That shield is s=\r\nupposed to hold off all the&lt;br&gt;&gt; Predacon forces. We are not going to ge=\r\nt in by brute force.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; As Rodimus talked three other M=\r\naximals seemed to almost materialize out of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the underbrush, such w=\r\nas their skills at camouflage.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The first was Wing Caliber,=\r\n (See: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Skywarp&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://=\r\ntfwiki.net/wiki/Skywarp&lt;/a&gt; ) an old&lt;br&gt;&gt; Maximal stratagist and militar=\r\ny teacher, who from the brownish feathers&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; along his frame turned i=\r\nnto some sort of eagle.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The next was Leo II, (&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;a =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://en.academic.ru/pictures/enwiki/76/Lioconvoy_gathering.jpg&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://en.academic.ru/pictures/enwiki/76/Lioconvoy_gatheri=\r\nng.jpg&lt;/a&gt; ) the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; adopted son of Lio Convoy, and who looked much li=\r\nke him, and who had&lt;br&gt;&gt; obviously picked up many of his mannerisms. His=\r\n body was powerfully built&lt;br&gt;&gt; and heavily armored. He looked to turn i=\r\nnto a lion.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The third was Ramulus (&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://tfwi=\r\nki.net/wiki/Ramulus&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ramulus&lt;/a&gt;) =\r\nwho had like the&lt;br&gt;&gt; others been on patrol for a while, surveying the a=\r\nrea and trying to keep it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; free from Predacon invasion.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; They also come up beside Rodimus, Leo II, obviously the leader of the=\r\n other&lt;br&gt;&gt; two, &quot;What now sir?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus look=\r\ned at Quickstride and Uproar, &quot;Well let&#39;s get out of sight, and&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; then we can discuss it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; *Meanwhile Inside the=\r\n Ark:*&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Perceptor had received Tuscon&#39;s message and sen=\r\nt attempted to send a message&lt;br&gt;&gt; to Lord elder, however at the moment =\r\nthere was no answer from the elder&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Maximal.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; At th=\r\ne same time Legacy was still standing in the med lab along with the&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n others, his single optic glowing in the darkness.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;I=\r\nt would seem that Nightlight&#39;s vital systems are being held at minimal&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; levels.&quot; Legacy said as he directed his gaze to the wall pane=\r\nl nearest&lt;br&gt;&gt; Nightlight. A small light blinked, indicating her spark w=\r\nas still online,&lt;br&gt;&gt; but that there was not enough power to reboot her =\r\nsystems.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; He turned to look at the others, his face glowin=\r\ng in the darkness, lit by&lt;br&gt;&gt; his own optic, and the glowing bar on his=\r\n chest plate. He raised his right&lt;br&gt;&gt; hand in the air, the one with the=\r\n arm cannon on it and begin to emit light&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; from it, much like a fla=\r\nsh light or a beacon so that the room was&lt;br&gt;&gt; illuminated. He casually =\r\nlooked around, &quot;Perhaps we could locate a back out&lt;br&gt;&gt; or reserve =\r\npower system . . . &quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Legacy paused as Tuscon&#39;s me=\r\nssage came in. He turned to look at Santon, Bump&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and Perceptor, a =\r\nlook of disbelief momentarily flashing across his face.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Le=\r\ngacy straightened as his cold voice comes across the channel, &quot;I will =\r\nnot&lt;br&gt;&gt; comply with your command.
