I would like to meet your leader, if you are not the \nleader yourself. I have a history to deal with, and I wish to know if your \ngroup can appreciate my abilities through it.\n\nHe then waved a hand towards the newcomers that had been waiting with him.\n\nAzureBlade:\nI guess my other companions here have motives other than mines to join up, \nso I will let them speak.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
