He was determined to get through the crisis =\r\nand find Rodimus. His heart had shown him the way, and there was nothing an=\r\nyone could do to stop him. With Vestige in his cab, he keeps careful watch =\r\nover his newly found old friend, and secures him with a saftey belt around =\r\nhis shoulders, to keep him safely in place on his seat.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hold on Vestig=\r\ne, the ride may get rough, but we will make it.&quot;\n\nVestige makes no movement=\r\n, but with Tuscon&#39;s help he is securely held\nin the seat of Tuscon&#39;s cab.\n\n=\r\nWith a burst of power from Tuscon the powerful vehicle rushed foward,\npushi=\r\nng through the rest of the hall and powering through the frame of\nthe doorw=\r\nay. As Tuscon came into the room he was immediately ensnared\nin what would =\r\nappear to be vines or perhaps more of those Tendrils\nsimilar to the ones th=\r\nat had bound Rodimus before all this started.\nThey attempted to snake thier=\r\n way around his vehicular mode to hold\nhim in place.\n\nThe walls and floor o=\r\nf this room were white, sterile and clean. The\nfloor was crafted from some =\r\nsort of metal as were the walls. In the\nmiddle of the room a single bed sur=\r\nrounded by all sorts of scanning\nand medical equipment. Three insect creatu=\r\nres were standing over the\nbed. They were obviously of the same race as the=\r\n spider like creatures\nand the winged ones that had been harrassing Tuscon =\r\nbefore, but these\nwere in a more humanoid mode, a &#39;robot&#39; mode if you will.=\r\n All three of\nthem were female, at least they would appear to be if a human=\r\n were\nlooking on. On the bed a figure lay strapped down, the form blocked\nf=\r\nrom view by the figures that stood over it.\n\n&quot;You are too late Autobot!&quot; On=\r\ne of the three females said, the taller\nof the two in the center. &quot;We have =\r\nall that we need from this one, and\neven now your data will fill our banks =\r\nwith data, data that we can use\nto bring about your destruction.&quot;\n\nThe tend=\r\nrils that were struggling to hold on to Tuscon were begining\nto change not =\r\nonly color to match Tuscon, but also thier texture and\nshape were modifying=\r\n as well.\n\nThe larger female stepped away from the bed to walk towards Tusc=\r\non,\n&quot;The queen will want you for herself.&quot; The female smiled, &quot;We shall\nsee=\r\n that you are prepared for her.&quot;\n\nAs the female approached it was possible =\r\nto see the figure on the bed,\nit looked like Hot Rod!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
