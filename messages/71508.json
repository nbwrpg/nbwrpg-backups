The look on his face tells of a priceless feeling of \nperpetual joy that could only be felt when in the company of those you love. \nHe had found happiness the moment he met her, which to him was far more \nvaluable than the most powerful weapon in the universe.  What better way to \nexpress one&#39;s love and the joy it brings by giving something back that is as \nprecious as love itself.  He was ready to take the next step.  As Rodimus \ngraced Nightlight by fathering a child, so promised Tucson as he gently \nholds her hand.\n\n&quot; Talon, I have yet to give you something.  A gift truly which comes from my \nspark.  A family is formed when the love of two sparks come together as one. \nAnd as you have given me so much of your heart, I would like to give you so \nmuch more of mine.  That of course, is if you want me to.  I promise not to \ndo anything unless you conscent to it first.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord/Talon\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon followed Tucson.\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord signed and said &quot;No much, Hydras has a bunch of new friends, \n&gt; mainly\n&gt; bring by Cyclonus...

He didn&#39;t look so good. \n&gt; Anyway,\n&gt; lemme show ya what I have so far on the turbines.  The wind turbine isn&#39;t \n&gt; so\n&gt; bad but the hydro turbine is another story.  We need materials that won&#39;t\n&gt; rust and pollute the water sources here.  Hopefully there are such\n&gt; materials.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He scratches behind his left ear in brwilderment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jul 22, 2011, at 4:44 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tucson couldn&#39;t help but rest his forehead in his left hand, closing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; optics for a moment, then re opening them.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot; Please excuse me, I fully agree with you Leo Prime, I was listening \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you.  You&#39;re right, I do need a few more hours in CR.  Quickstride,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Legacy\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is your best bet for engineering purposes, he can help you with \n&gt; &gt;&gt; research,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; development and construction.  What you&#39;re proposing seems a bit \n&gt; &gt;&gt; complex,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and it&#39;s always good to have someone else with you to collaborate \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Quickstride nods enthusiastically.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot; I was hoping ta have his support actually, well do.  There&#39;s a few\n&gt; &gt;&gt; things\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I need ta sort out as far as materials.. And of course design and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; functionability.  &quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tucson smiles gently and then turns to the little green mech.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot; I assure you that if you assist us in locating the escaped predicons,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; will be granted immunity from enemy forces.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; **OOC: I will let Kratlos respond here as soon he is able. **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He then turns to Leo Prime.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot; I have a feeling Hydras may take advantage of the situation and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; attempt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; another assault on this parameter.  Be sure our boundaries are well\n&gt; &gt;&gt; guarded\n&gt; &gt;&gt; around the clock, and have everyone take turns running guard duty.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was a raised optic ridge as TUSCON continued giving directives,\n&gt; &gt; but he said nothing and just nodded graciously. LEO turned to look at\n&gt; &gt; the Fuzors, â€œThat will be primarily your duties, security of the \n&gt; &gt; Ark.â€\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; TORCA glanced over at TUSCON a curious look on his face and then back\n&gt; &gt; at LEO PRIME.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; â€œDo it Torca, we need to get this place secure. Coordinate with Legacy\n&gt; &gt; and Lord Elder here.â€ LOE gestured at the two mechs being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; â€œI think they have been the primary guardians.â€\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEGACY looked over at TORCA and QUICKSTRIDE, â€œOf course. I should be\n&gt; &gt; of assistance to Quickstrideâ€™s construction as well as base security.\n&gt; &gt; I will add all of you to the primary register at the close of this\n&gt; &gt; meeting.â€\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the other side of LEGACY, LORD ELDER sat with his arms folded\n&gt; &gt; nodding appreciably. â€œOf course Prime.â€ Elder said as he stood.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He nods as a signal that things were adjourned for the time being.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot; That pretty much covers everything, Leo Prime, thank you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He tries to get up from his seat and stumbles.  Quickstride catches \n&gt; &gt;&gt; him.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot; Whoa, careful sir.  Leo, better call someone for transport to the CR\n&gt; &gt;&gt; chambers, his balance is really messed up.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEO didnâ€™t have to say anything as SANTON quickly stepped off the\n&gt; &gt; stage and moved quickly to TUSCONâ€™s side. â€œDonâ€™t worry, he said in \n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; deep and yet somehow comforting voice. â€œWe will get you to the CR\n&gt; &gt; chamber.â€\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He looked up at LEO PRIME who just nodded back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; SANTON smiled and slowly stood, allowing TUSCON to lean on him all he\n&gt; &gt; wanted. The medic was quite large and looked as if he could carry\n&gt; &gt; easily TUSCON if needed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;What will be my duties sir?&quot;said windlord at Leo Prime who was \n&gt; &gt;&gt; standing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a corder of the room\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEO PRIME looked at WINDLORD a small smile on his face as he came off\n&gt; &gt; the stage. â€œWell you have wanted to make up for your time with Hydras\n&gt; &gt; right? Tell me what you know of the Predacon. Perhaps there is\n&gt; &gt; something that you learned that can help us.â€\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
