I have finished the escape tunnel and\n&gt; got the computer systems running.  I also got the auto-defence systems up\n&gt; and running.  I just need your help with the scanners and a few other\nlittle\n&gt; things is all commander.  I got the internal scanners up and I fixed the\n&gt; main console so you and the other commanders can run the whole base from\n&gt; there.  It will only respond to your voice commands so no one else other\n&gt; than us four  can run it.&quot;\n&gt; She thought for a moment that she was over stepping her bounds.\n&gt; &quot;Uh, but I can remove my voice command capability from it if you wish\n&gt; commander.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------Original Message-------\n&gt; &gt;From: crow_lord@...\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Scorponok\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;I told you already, when I got back to the Predacon ship, I found\n&gt; &gt;that my room was underattack. So, I snuck behind all of them grabed\n&gt; &gt;some stuff and let them leave then I grabbed the rest and came back\n&gt; &gt;here.&quot; Scorponok smiled at Darkmouse.
