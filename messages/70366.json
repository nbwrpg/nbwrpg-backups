In fact Rodimus&#39; form cannot be truly seen, as he&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; covered\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; head to foot in them, however every scan confirms that he is indeed \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there somewhere. Scans also reveal that although he is healthy, he \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; undergoiong his own ordeal, something left over from the insects. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Time\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is of the essence to get him back and repaired.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As the party makes it way back to the Ark they can hear several\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; explosions behind them, the walls rumbling around them but so far\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; nothing seems to inhibit their travel.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile back at the Ark Lord Elder was there at the headquarters,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; apparently he had not taken any time for rest or even to eat, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; instead\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he manned the communicatyion station waiting for any word.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;We read you Tuscon!&quot; Elder said as the call came in. &quot;We will have\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; medical staff standing by when you get here.&quot; Elder manipulated a \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; few\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; controls as he spoke, &quot;and the shield is up and waiting for your\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; entrance.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Elder turned back to Kup and just smiled broadly, &quot;They&#39;re alive!&quot; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; said, nearly leaping out his chair with happniness.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It takes Tuscon hours of driving, but finally Tuscon arrives at an\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; opening, a final break in the long monotony of near featureless\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; smoothly tunneled walls. They at long last arrive at an opening to a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rather deep pit.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The pit is very deep and very dark and it seems to go on for a very\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; long time. It is roughly 8-10 feet and looking down it runs nearly\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; straight down into the depths of the earth; even with artificial\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; light, its end point cannot be seen as it continued into the \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; darkness\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; below. However looking up, several hundred feet up a tiny pinprick \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; light can be seen, it is the surface! However to reach the top one\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would need to be able to fly or have extremely good climbing\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; abilities, as there are no hand holds and not even a single plant\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; breaks the surface of the walls lining this area, the sides are\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; extremely smooth and sheer,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; almost as if someone had cut it with some sort of high energy beam. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; .\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From beneath Tuscon&#39;s position heat and noxious fumes rise from \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; below,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; clearly show the danger of failing to climb or fly properly and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; plunging into the super heated depths. It would be a grizzly end\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; indeed.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
