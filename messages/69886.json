I&#39;m sure Hydras wants my full report, and I got plen=\r\nty ta tell em. Got lots ta tell you too. Ohh yeah, some juicy gossip all ri=\r\nght... And it starts with Pretty boy there, who&#39;s on the ground. He ain&#39;t g=\r\nonna be down&#39;n out for long, ohh no. He&#39;s got too much power behind him ta =\r\ndo that. He&#39;ll be out of it for some time, but I doubt no more than twenty =\r\nfour hours. But lemme tell ya the good stuff when we get back ta the fortre=\r\nss.&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course&quot; Scorponok said, his voice full of skeptical curiosity.\nWi=\r\nth a swiftness that did not immediately seem possible for the giant\nmechani=\r\nzed scorpion, Scoprponok began moving swiftly towards the Black\nFortress.\n\n=\r\n As he moved he got a message from Hydras . . .\n\n&gt; &quot;Keep an eye in Nightshi=\r\nft, in maximals and Autobots...\n&gt; sometthing isnt all right&quot; then he\n\n&quot;So t=\r\nhe old boy isn&#39;t slow after all.&quot; Scorponok mumbled to himself,\nhopefully t=\r\no quiet for the radio to pick up. &quot;I understand.&quot; Scorponok\nradioed back to=\r\n Hydras as he continued on.\n\n&quot;What else did you see in the Ark?&quot; Scorponok =\r\nsaid to Nightshift. &quot;and\nwhere is the Matrix now then?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Tucson unsuspectedly sets up a two way com link between what&#39;s happening=\r\n within his radius and the Ark. He sends a text message back to Kup and Lor=\r\nd Elder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; So far so good. Mild suspicion but nothing significant yet. =\r\nI think they&#39;re buying into him. When they go, and are well out of range, t=\r\nell me, and I&#39;ll return inside the Ark. Night Shift&#39;s doing his part, now i=\r\nt&#39;s my turn to do mine.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He pauses between text messages.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; By the =\r\nway, be ready to light our darkest hour. It&#39;s time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; For once, all the =\r\nreservations, apprehensions and anxieties Tucson had were all melting away.=\r\n He realized that there was no going back to trying to correct the mistakes=\r\n which he thought were already made, but it was time to step forward and le=\r\nave new legacies and bring new hope to those who need it badly. It was time=\r\n to step up to the plate and accept destiny for what it was and not as he t=\r\nhought it should have been. The Matrix had once asked him what his self wor=\r\nth was. And now, he could see it. He was worth a great deal. Not just as a =\r\nwarrior but as an innovator, and a new light of hope for all Maximal, and A=\r\nutobot kind. Things did happen along the way, which he thought he could con=\r\ntroll, but now as he lies motionless, he realizes that some times not all s=\r\nituations can be handled without some degree of difficulty. There would be =\r\nhard times, and Chaos was the balance between Harmony and insanity. Without=\r\n it there wouldn&#39;t be a planet to protect and a universe to save. He sends =\r\none more message to Lord Elder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I believe I owe another visit to Opti=\r\nmus Prime. The Matrix may be expecting me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Yeah, fly, right=\r\n..
