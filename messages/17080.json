A rage \nand hate boiled up in him, and he raised his hands to stop the other two \nrobots.\n\n&quot;What!&quot; Nemesis said loudly.\n\n&quot;That is Hot Rod.  An Autobot...or rather, a Maximal.  Or an impostor.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, whazzzz your point?&quot; Scattershot said quickly.\n\n&quot;Hot Rod killed Unicron.  He&#39;s a good guy, to make it easy to understand for \nyou.&quot;\n\n&quot;Reheheheally?&quot; \n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n&quot;In that case...&quot; Nemesis Enforcer drew his rapid-firing laser rifle, taking \naim at Hot Rod&#39;s torso.\n\n&quot;Well...I reckon this varmint better get hog-tied and eaten by wild banshees, \npartners.&quot;\n\nThe other two Alliance members looked over to Scattershot.\n\n&quot;Good one!&quot; Nemesis said, high-fiving Scattershot, as Scattershot took out \nhis automatic rifle, taking aim at Hot Rod.\n\nUnitron could see Feline with Hot Rod, but ignored it. He raised both of his \nlaser rifles at Hot Rod, pulling the trigger twice for each weapon, his \nhatred for Autobots in general, and especially Hot Rod overriding his logic \ncircuitry.\n\n"}}
