This wasn&#39;t \nwhat she wanted to do either.  She wanted to spend time with her \nbeloved Lunarpine. But this was something that needed to be done \nfirst.   She looked at RebelYell,&quot;Don&#39;t worry, when we are done with \nthe repairs, then we can take a little time off. And all the \nmaintencance bots were destroyed already.&quot;  She turned and looked at \nLunarpine and smiled at him.  She blew him a kiss and went back to \nwelding the plates on the side of the hull. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Terry Barlow &lt;twb176@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::RebelYell::\n&gt; RebelYell grumbled to himself as he worked. This is\n&gt; not the kind of work he enjoyed. &quot;I&#39;m a soldier, not a\n&gt; slaggin&#39; maintenance bot!&quot; he thought. Still, he\n&gt; admitted this ship had taken quite a beating, and if\n&gt; repairs werent done soon theres no way it would hold\n&gt; up under fire. So RebelYell decided to keep his\n&gt; complaints to himself. And besides, after this, he\n&gt; would kill some Preds one way or the other, even if he\n&gt; had to go look for the Pred base himself.\n\n\n\n"}}
