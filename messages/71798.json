The screen got bigger as the mi=\r\nnicam approached DARK RODIMUS, in&lt;BR&gt;the corner were cordinates indicating =\r\nwhere they were at the time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then the screen went black, presumably =\r\nwhere DARK RODIMUS vanished&lt;BR&gt;from sight and then the screen went black ag=\r\nain.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;That didn&#39;t show us much.&quot; LEO said, clearly getting preturbed=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Patience.&quot; WING CALIBER said as he carefully reran the scene in s=\r\nlow&lt;BR&gt;motion.
