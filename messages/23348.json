I have been caring for her since she fell off of your back at the battle.  We have our own little group now.  It&#39;s growing.  I would like you to come back and speak with her.  Unfotunately I don&#39;t know where they are right now.  Windlord should be here by now.&quot;  Just then he recieves Windlord&#39;s message.  &quot;This is Aerotaur.  Is there a problem Windlord?&quot;\n\n"}}
