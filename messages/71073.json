Okay, like you \nsaid, carefully, and simultaniously.  I&#39;ve done that before several times, \nbut it&#39;s been a while since I had ta do this last.&quot;\n\nHe takes the tools given to him by Wing Caliber, and carefully, he follows \nhis instructions to a T with surpsingly good dexterity and with an extremely \ndelicate and stable hand.\n\n&quot;Ohh I hope that works..&quot;\n\nIn another part of the Ark, Uproar transforms into his beast mode and bounds \nin to find no sign of the intruder anywhere.  He growls angrilly.\n\n&quot;GRRRR! That rotten slag ball got away!&quot;\n\nHis expressions change quickly upon finding Elita. A gentile look comes over \nhis face, as he crouches down to check her over, to be sure she hadn&#39;t been \ninjured in any way.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry little cat, as long as we&#39;re here, that mean slag ball pred \nisn&#39;t gonna lay another finger on ya.  And if he does, he&#39;s had it.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Leo ll\n\n&quot;Sir, I&#39;d like to be Elita&#39;s body guard until we figure out how ta catch and \nstop that slag ball.&quot;\n\nHe puts a protective paw around Elita, gently holding her against his \nmassive body.\n\n&quot; No ugly slag pred&#39;s gonna try that scrap on you while I&#39;m around, I \npromise.&quot;\n\nOutside the Ark, Tucson did not like the idea that his comrades and his home \nwere being compromised by the Predacon forces.  He knew something had to be \ndone, and did not care what condition he was in.  For now, Rat Trap had \nstopped the leaking of battery fluid, and for this moment, with the regular \nflow of fluid back into his system, he could at least transform into his \nrobot mode, with just a bit of pain from his injurred arm.\n\n&quot; Torca, thank you for your help, I appreciate it deeply.  Now, it&#39;s my turn \nto contribute to the cause.  The only way we&#39;ll be able to regain control of \nthe Ark, is if we throw off a disrupter wave, that will cancel out enemy \nprogramming.  I am now capable of doing so since we are at such close \nrange.&quot;\n\nHe narrows his optics dangerously.  This meant he was fully prepared to do \nwhatever it took to regain the Ark&#39;s control.\n\n&quot;Legacy, this is Tucson Prime..  I am going to emit a sonar wave at full \nmagnatude.  It will disrupt the enemy programming and give you a window of \nopportunity to take back the programming of our systems.  At that time, I \nneed you to commence reconfiguration, as it will be very easy to regain full \ncontrol of the system. &quot;\n\nNight Shift transforms and prepares to back up his commander.\n\n&quot; This is gonna work, I know it will.&quot;\n\nTucson then transmits to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Rodimus, as full control of the Ark is re established, it will be your \nopportunity to head a clean sweep of the Ark entirely.  That means any enemy \nforces that are still present, will be yours for the capture.  But do not \ndestroy.  Anyone you find, will be valuable for questioning.  Once captured, \nthey&#39;re to be brought to the questioning room, where I will personally \nquestion them myself.  Good luck comrade.&quot;\n\nHis expression turns resolute as he now stands solidly with a firm foot on \nthe ground.  He begins to transmit the most powerful sonar wave ever emitted \nby his systems.\n\n&quot;Legacy, I&#39;m transmitting now.  Be prepared.  Leo ll, I&#39;ll need you to head \nanother scouring team on the outer parameter of the Ark.  No doubt if there \nare any enemy forces that have escaped, they may still be within range of \ncapture.  Take the south parameter and extend your search as widely as you \nsee fit.  Noctorro, I will need you to head a group of Maximals to scour the \nNorth Parameter outside the Ark&#39;s boundaries.  The further we go, the better \nour chances are at capturing enemy intruders.  Night Shift, I want you to go \nwith Kup, and scour the East Paramater.  Talon, Windlord, Rat Trap, you will \ntake the West Parameter.  Go as far as all of you see fit, but safely within \nrange. It&#39;s our only assurance of securing our base from further attack.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to Tucson.\n\n&quot;I take it I&#39;m with you.&quot;\n\nHe nodds.\n\n&quot;Yes, I have a feeling I will need you this time.  If Hydras thinks he&#39;s \ngetting the best of us, he&#39;s sadly mistaken.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor/Elita/hydras\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor continued to working trying to turn off the ark&#39;s Shields and \n&gt; running at same time the Ark&#39;s scanners looking for any thing that isnt \n&gt; all right for Decepticons and Autobots that were inside the ark while he \n&gt; said &quot;Any other thing that I have to know??&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *************************************\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita breathed with relief, she never had been soo scared in her short \n&gt; life &quot;I&#39;m here&quot;said aloud with her childish voice &quot;Be carefull he just \n&gt; Vanish...

Although it looked to be \n&gt; &gt; assembled differently, he could actually make out what needed to be done \n&gt; &gt; and quickly goes to work on the defusing aspect of the bomb.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ahh, here we go, yep, the wiring is all the same as I remember it, just \n&gt; &gt; configured differently around the bomb&#39;s inner power core and timing \n&gt; &gt; device. Okay Wing Caliber, first things first, we need ta snip the cable \n&gt; &gt; that runs from the battery pack to the explosive compound, which is the \n&gt; &gt; blue and white wire I&#39;m pointing to, on my left. That will cut the power \n&gt; &gt; off to the main explosive. After that, the counter will mean nothing, \n&gt; &gt; unless of course that slag ball managed to do a bypass on it.. Let&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; see... Checking for a... Son of a... SLAG! There is a bypass on this. I \n&gt; &gt; hate that. I know how ta do this but it&#39;s a pain in the aft ta do it. \n&gt; &gt; Okay, here goes nothing.. Stupid pred /minion whatever the slag this \n&gt; &gt; creep is.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Wing Caliber nodded as he stood at one of the controls looking at a \n&gt; computer console. &quot;I have the schematic down here.&quot; He said to \n&gt; Quickstride. &quot;You will have to disengage the bypass. To do that you will \n&gt; have to do it manually with a polarized microcrimp.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Stepping over to a small cabinet, obviously where there is a repair kit \n&gt; for bridge computer work, Wing Caliber reached in and retrieved a tool. \n&gt; &quot;If you don&#39;t have one, we have one here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Be careful.&quot; Wing Caliber said, &quot;You will have to cut it all off at the \n&gt; same time while cutting power to the system.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the site of the door, Uproar&#39;s finest of weaponry were his claws, \n&gt; &gt; even more so in robot mode. He charges at the door, in robot mode, and \n&gt; &gt; prepares to unleash his powerful claw attack, hoping to tear the door to \n&gt; &gt; shreads.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The door actually gives way under Uproars powerful assault. The door \n&gt; already partially damaged by the intruders explosion that wedged it there, \n&gt; Uproar&#39;s claws make quick work of the rest of it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Good work Uproar!&quot; Leo II said as he nodded approvingly at Uproar, the \n&gt; door laying in large slashed pieces.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Leo! BEAST MODE!&quot; the maximal said as Leo shifted into his large \n&gt; transmetalled lion mode. &quot;COME ON!&quot; he said to Uproar as he took off down \n&gt; the hall, letting off a large roar as he ran!\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; elita continued Running and jumping trying to avoid the shots,\n&gt; &gt; praying to someone comes to help her soon. She didnt know but\n&gt; &gt; she did a wrong turn and the corritor was large but has a dead\n&gt; &gt; end\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The intruder continued to give chase, flying after the fleeing Elita, with \n&gt; a quiet menacing laughter. As Elita quickly began to realize her error as \n&gt; she could see the end of her corridore the intruder landed several meters \n&gt; from her, looking like some cold shadow in the darkness. His optics \n&gt; sparkled wickedly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I believe your time for running is over.&quot; He said as he began to move \n&gt; towards her! That is until the sound of something else could be heard in \n&gt; the halls.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;. . . ELITA, WE&#39;RE COMMING, HANG IN THERE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It was the sound of Uproar&#39;s voice echoing along the halls. Then there was \n&gt; the sound of a large roar.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;FRELL!&quot; the intruder whispered in annoyance. &quot;I don&#39;t have time for \n&gt; this.&quot; He looked at Elita and then back up the hall and then back at \n&gt; Elita, &quot;You will live. But I will come back for you another time my \n&gt; pretty, yes, and then we shall talk, we shall talk at length.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The intruder laughed and then disappeared as if fading into the shadows.\n&gt;\n&gt; MEANWHILE OUTSIDE:\n&gt;\n&gt; Tuscon and the rest of the crew arrive at the Ark. So far nothing seems \n&gt; undamaged. Silverbolt and Noctorro are flying around, so far unable to \n&gt; penetrate the shielding of the Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;GREAT!&quot; Noctorro said to Tuscon and Torca in his deep booming voice. &quot;We \n&gt; still can&#39;t get in.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes. The vile Predacon still holds us at bay.&quot; Silverbolt added.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Some distance away, hidden from sensors Hydras and the sweeps watch this \n&gt; all with apparent interest. The sweeps continue to stay close to Hydras to \n&gt; block him from radar and sensors. So long as no one comes over the rise, \n&gt; he will remain hidden.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I am ready to vacate.&quot; A message comes from Blackrazor to Hydras. &quot;I \n&gt; believe I have a small present for the maximals.&quot; There is a small evil \n&gt; chuckle.\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: I am not sure exactly where Hydras has hidden himself, but I will \n&gt; assume that it not easily visable, although Hydras should be able to see \n&gt; the group of approaching Maximals and Autobots.)\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
