Beholder was now complete. But Feline was \nonly at 55% complete.\n\nShe opened up the tank and got the Beholder clone out of the tank. He \nwas very heavy, but she finally managed to get it up onto a table. \nShe opened up the chest panels.  She hooked up an energon IV up to \nthe bot.  She carefully removed the cloned mother board and installed \nthe original board. She then hooked up two cables to the bot&#39;s head \nand went over to the console. She inserted the memory disk and \nstarted to download the old memories and programs. She also installed \nan anitvirus program. So that the bot won&#39;t get any programming \nviruses in the furture. It&#39;s programs would remain intact no matter \nwhat.\n\nShe knew the computer would take a few  minutes to finish the \ndownload. She walked over and started on the other upgrades. She \nadjusted the shoulders to have a jet pack and shoulder cannons.\n\nA few hours later, she was finished. She looked at the bot on the \ntable.  It was now fully ready to activate. She went over and looked \nat the spark chamber.  She needed to have this bot working on it&#39;s \nown and not under another bots control. She went over to the original \nbody of Beholder and took out the old spark chamber. She then removed \nthe clone&#39;s spark chamber and installed the original chamber in the \nclone.  She then added liquid energon into the spark chamber. Then \nclosed the chamber and the chest panels.\n\nWith little time to waste, she removed all the connections and IV&#39;s \nto the bot. Next, she put four electrodes on the bot&#39;s chest. She hit \na few buttons on the console and flooded the bot&#39;s body with pure \nenergy.  Three zaps  and she turned off the power.  She removed the \nelectrodes and put everything away. She walked over to the bot. It&#39;s \neyes were flickering as the power surged through it.  She knew that a \nnew spark was forming in the old spark chamber.  She smiled.\nShe gently touched the bot&#39;s face and then walked over to her console.\nShe sent a message to Zardus that one clone was now alive and ready.\nThe bot would wake up any second now.\n\nShe walked back over to the Beholder clone. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
