I \nwant to make radio contact with the Decepticons here on Earth.  Schedule \na meeting and a place where i will take my place as new leader of the \nDEcepticons.&quot;\n\nScrapper turned and smiled.  Nightmare seemed to do all the work for \nhim, and he would rather play with a radio then lifting bodies.\n\nHe walked to the transmitter and sat down.  &quot;Attention Decepticons of \nEarth precint.  This is Scrapper of the Decepticons for Earths \nDomination. My leader, Havotron, has been sent to take over control of \nall Decepticons.  Your mission to sieze control of Earth has taken to \nlong so you must give in to us and your new commander Havotron.  Your \ncurrent commander, must meet with Havotron as soon as possible. Do you \ncopy?&quot;\n\nQuake turned to Apeface.  &quot;No, how bout we walk because that would be \nfast.  Geez.  Quake turned and jump up transforming into his jet mode \nand shooting straight up through the mountains tunnel created by the \nships impact and out into the open air.\n\nrdahl@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Nightmare nodded, smoke hazing above his head as he did it. He walked\n&gt; over to the rubble, and put down Jagged very gently. He then moved\n&gt; Needlenose out of the way, and began to swat pieces of ruble out of the\n&gt; way, clearing Spinister. He hoisted Spinister over his shoulder, then\n&gt; grabbed Jagged and Needlenose, and lifted them off the ground by their\n&gt; arms, then headed back to the CR chambers. He placed each once in\n&gt; carefully, then entered one of his own, and set it on the same setting\n&gt; as Jaggeds, replication of Alien lifeform.\n&gt; \n&gt; Apeface trudged over to the hole in the side of the ship, as Spasma rode\n&gt; on his back. &quot;We take to the air?&quot; He asked Quake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
