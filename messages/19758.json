She followed her nose and found a small \nstream near the base. She frolliced in the water. It was cool and \nmade her new skin tingle. She played like a cub.  She caught a few \nfish and played some more.  She then got out of the water and layed \ndown in the grass.  It was wonder. She layed in the sun, basking in \nit heat and light.  Her fur seamed to take on a slight glow in the \nsun. She smiled and looked around as  she layed there. The trees were \nso green and lush, the birds sang and flied around.  The flowers were \nvibrant with color.  It was like she was discovering the beauty of \nthe world for the first time.  She knew that the sky was blue and the \ngrass was green, but for the first time, she really saw just how blue \nand how green things were. She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. \nShe could smell the grass under her.  The wind carried the scents the \nanimals that were around in the area. She felt like she was in \nparadise. \n\nShe woke up a little while later. About an hour had past. She got up \nand stretched. She felt her wings getting stronger as well as the \nrest of her.  She thought about Lunarpine and wondered if he would \nlike such a place. She walked back to the base.  She could the scent \nof something that she hadn&#39;t smelled before.  It was another bot. She \nwalked closer to the ship.  The scent was much stronger.  She wasn&#39;t \nsure who she was picking up on, but she wanted to make sure Veratis \nwas alright.  She walked in and looked around for him. &quot;Veratis? \nWhere are you?&quot; She had kept her mind closed, for fear of intruding \non his private thoughts.  She didn&#39;t mind this new ability, but she \ndidn&#39;t always want to know what a bot was  thinking either.\n\n\n"}}
