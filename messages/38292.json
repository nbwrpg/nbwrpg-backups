Depart with Astrotrain, he will\n&gt; fill you in.&quot; Megatron looked up to Menasor. &quot;Show him to me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Menasor stood their staring at Slaughter, then lowered his hand to the\n&gt; ground, so Slaughter&#39;s feet were dangling just above it, but he held his\n&gt; iron clad grip. Megatron looked deep into Slaughter&#39;s eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So, who is foolish enough to enter the Decepticon headquarters?&quot; He\n&gt; asked.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
