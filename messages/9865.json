He frowns. The \nreadings reported that there was an opening beyond the back wall. He walks \nover to it, looking it over from the cealing to the floor. His eyes narrow as \nhe sees a small button to the side.\n\nStretching out a hand, he presses the button, jumping back as the wall slides \ninto the floor, revealing a cavern. Autofire&#39;s eyes widen, his face settling \ninto a grin in a few seconds. He walks into the cavern, looking at the \nvehicle inside. From the size of it, it was about a three-seater transport \npod. It had two guns on its side, and another one mounted on its top.\n\nAutofire smiles, walking forward to slide his hand across the smooth surface \nof the vehicle. He looks down at his scanners again, seeing their report. It \nwas a sort of flying vehicle, good for transportation.\n\nHe turns to Adrax. &quot;Hey, look at this,&quot; he says, pointing to the pod.\n\n"}}
