Well, then let&#39;s work together and \nwipe some out. Now that you have that cat over there, we can use it \nfor bait. Set a trap, make the maxi&#39;s come to us and then we spring \nthe trap, and kill them at our leasure. Like shooting fish in a water \ntank.  What do you say? Want to have some fun killing a few Maximals?&quot;\nDeplomicy wasn&#39;t one of her strong suits, but here, she was really \ntrying to pull this off. IF she could convince them to use the cat as \nbait, then maybe Galvatron would trust her enough to give her the \ncodes she could finish learning all there was in the data bases of \nthat ship.  \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Luzbel/Attilla\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Stop Attilla&quot; shouted the Luzbel while Attilla dogged the \nshot &quot;Are \n&gt; you telling us, Mikey mouse&#39;s sister that you&#39;re in our side?
