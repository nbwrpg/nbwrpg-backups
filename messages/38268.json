I&#39;m pretty sure the Trainer base did\n&gt; explode. I vaugely remember reading that. Anyways, if it didn&#39;t,\n&gt; forget this post.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Killfest/EndBringer/Demise/Scyther/Incarcinator/Neody/Crater/Slayer\n&gt; ::\n&gt;\n&gt; Killfest and his group were far enough from the Trainer base when it\n&gt; exploded for the blast not to be fatal, but it sent all of them\n&gt; flying. Demise and EndBringer go into stasis lock, the rest of them\n&gt; staying concious and beginning to get up.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Neody watches the base explode, his link with his two pods that he&#39;d\n&gt; sent being severed as they were vaporized. The ground under his feet\n&gt; shakes, making him fall backwards.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Crater dives down on the ground as the Trainer base explodes, debris\n&gt; flying over him, lots of it digging painfully into his back, severing\n&gt; his spine. The damage war repairabe, though.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Slayer growls, turning around as Ignatius calls him a coward to see\n&gt; the other Trainer being pummeled heavily by weaponfire. He sighs and\n&gt; flies down toward him, transforming into beast mode and concentrating\n&gt; on approaching him so he could grab him with his feet.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
