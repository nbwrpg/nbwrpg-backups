He could tell \nInjustice bugged her too.  Maybe Hellplague was asleep when she made \nthe clone.  He would have to watch his double closely in the near \nfuture.\n\nInjustice shrugged his shoulders.\n&quot;I guess we should.  So we&#39;re supposed to back up Hellplague?  Why?  \nIs she incapible of leading?&quot;\nThe large form of Splattercannon moved quickly in front of the black \nand purple clone.\n&quot;You should know your place.  You can&#39;t question your superiors.  Be \nsilent and do as you&#39;re told.&quot;\n\nThe Sweep commander turned to the other Minion before stepping back \nto a panel on the wall.\n&quot;The Cannon, and anyone near it.  Maximal or Predacon, they are all \ntargets.&quot;\nHellplague hits a button and the chamber seals it&#39;s main door, and \nthe room depressurizes.  The the outer door opens, to reveal the \nplanet below.  Hellplague opens her comm to the other Minions.\n&quot;We&#39;re are now departing.  Await my signal.&quot;\nHellplague transforms and the Sweeps follow suit.  She then eases out \ninto space with the Sweeps in formation behind her.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNightmare/Nightstrike/Darkfate::\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Malice nodded and followed Blacknightmare, casting a cold glance \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; the clone.\n&gt; \n&gt; BlackNightmare feel camly when they left the room, something about \n&gt; this bot made her feel uneasy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Injustice stood up straight and lost his mad expression.
