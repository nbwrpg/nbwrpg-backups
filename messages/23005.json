One \nstray shot and we are all dead.&quot;\n\nA command from his internal communication system sends Demise, Greven \nand Scyther heading to the bridge, and EndBringer to him.\n\n&quot;Demise, Greven, and Scyther will aid in the attack of the engine \nroom. I don&#39;t recommend sending EndBringer there, he is not easily \ncalmed. And having over-excited troops in the engine room isn&#39;t a \ngood thing.&quot;\n\nDarkmouse jumps up, her gun ready. &quot;Do ya want me to go attack to?&quot; \nshe asks hopefully.\n\n&quot;No, you&#39;re too valuable to lose. We&#39;ll need you here controlling the \ndefences.&quot;\n\nGrumbling, Darkmouse sits down. Killfest looks at DrillBit. &quot;I think \nwe should help in this attack as well. I, for one, am eager to gut \nthis Megatron.&quot;\n\nHe turns his head as GoldenEye runs into the room. She was breathing \nheavily.\n\n&quot;Hey, commander,&quot; she says to DrillBit between breaths, &quot;What do you \nwant me to do?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to Apoc, and looked at him through the door hatch.\n&gt; &quot;Megatron and most of his forces are in the engine room, attemptine \nto\n&gt; take computer control. Witch he cant because that network is tied in\n&gt; with Dark Mouse&#39;s spark. I say we attack the engine room. but your\n&gt; tactic of attack is sound.&quot;\n&gt; He then turns to Killfest.\n&gt; &quot;Order all your troops to join us. I&#39;ll do the same. We&#39;ll attack \nthe\n&gt; engine room wave after wave. Inform them to kill any of Meg&#39;s troops\n&gt; they encounter on the way.&quot;\n&gt; He turns back to StarScream and Dollon.\n&gt; &quot;You guys stick with me. We&#39;re command team Alpha. Killfest, take a\n&gt; couple of your guys. Have them with you at all times. We cant avord \nto\n&gt; loose a commander. Not again. You&#39;ll be command team Beta.\n&gt; Once we have are troops set we&#39;ll attack.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
