From what I know, and I can say I \nknow quite a lot on these guys, their commander is a direct descendant \nof Optimus Prime and a relative of Talos. From what I heard, he&#39;s \nquite fond of pred-busting and very direct too, but I guess he&#39;s okay. \nAnd even though I hate their ways, they are VERY efficient. They \nprevented that terrorist act on the capital 2 mega-cycles ago and they \nmanaged to end the hostage taking of Ujika with minimal casualties. \nThey are strong. And I think that if one has turned pred, he should be \none of the primary targets.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Not sure, Katya.
