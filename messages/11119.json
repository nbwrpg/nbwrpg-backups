Some battle just \ndon&#39;t go as planned. I mean, if every battle was easy, the maximals \nwouldn&#39;t be around right now. So don&#39;t talk baddly about our leader \nlike that. Besides, the only reason I&quot;m even thinking about this is \nto do this FOR Megatron. Got it? A warrior doesn&#39;t turn tratior on \nthier leader. No matter how bad it sometimes looks. &quot; She turned and \nfaced the others. She smiled,&quot;Now then, first we need to see what it \nis we plan to take over. The ship it&#39;s self. We need to know the \nskematics of the ship and all the possable ways to get in and if need \nbe, get out. Then we come up with a plan of attack.  First off, we \nneed plans of the ship.&quot;\n\n\n\n-- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit:: turned towards land Mine.\n&gt; &quot;Of course getting killed is bad.
