I see that things \n&gt; have changed in my absence. But, no more worries, things will be put \n&gt; to rights.\n&gt;      &quot;Which is what I have come here to discuss, All these pathetic, \n&gt; weak factions. Where are the Autobots and Decepticons of old? From \n&gt; what I have learned in the data disks, that I stole, there are many \n&gt; smaller factions here. The NWO? The Tripreds, even the Maximals and \n&gt; Predacons; what are all these things?\n&gt;      &quot;You two are the leaders of some prominent groups, Rodimus, you \n&gt; act as though I taught you nothing,&quot; He walked over to him, and \n&gt; placed his hand on his shoulder, as he had left his gun on a ripped \n&gt; apart stump. Secretly he had placed a bug on his shoulder, very tiny, \n&gt; about the size of a freckle. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you crushed those that seek \n&gt; to rip your faction apart?&quot;\n&gt;      He let go and walked to Hydra, &quot;And you, although part of you \n&gt; may have killed me long ago, you have fallen from your vaunted seat. \n&gt; You have had to merge with the new Megatron. Galvatron not enough for \n&gt; you?&quot;\n&gt;      Prime held Hydra&#39;s upper arm, and placed a bug on it.\n&gt;      Then he turned and walked away, back to where he had begun. &quot;I \n&gt; have crossed galaxies to put things to right here,&quot; He bent down to \n&gt; grab his gun, which he promptly attached to his leg.\n&gt;      &quot;You are both free to go,&quot; He said, then smiled at Rodimus, &quot;Oh \n&gt; yes, one last thing...You both remember Magnus, right? Well, he gave \n&gt; his life to bring me back, and look at how well his wish was granted!&quot;\n&gt;      He transformed into his truck mode and lifted off, flying right \n&gt; over Rodimus&#39;s and Hydra&#39;s head.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: The bugs are simple tracers, they won&#39;t do much more than \n&gt; say &quot;Hey! Rodimus/Hydra is here!&quot; Detected easily enough, with the \n&gt; right equipment, which most bases would have. Removal is easy too.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
