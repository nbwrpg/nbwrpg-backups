Cutie entered the area that would later be Augusta \nGeorgia (I don&#39;t want you to know exactly where I live now do I). He \nthen laid down clutching a small disk close to his heart. It showed a \npress conference with Optimus Prime after they arrived back on \nCybertron. He didn&#39;t care his shuttle had crashed. This was the right \nplanet, he had been going for the 20th-21st century but when didn&#39;t \nmatter. Optimus had spoken for 4 mega cycles. He mentioned several \nEarth legends. Among them was the fountain of youth. After finding the \ndisk Cutie had worked for 10 stellar cycles to find out where Earth \nwas. Now he could find the fountain of youth (one of the few known \nlegends with no known root in true history or nature) and pray it \nworked on bots.\n\nOOC: If you want to complain cutties stupid talk to whoever came up \nwith Bob first.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Is it my fault my superior intellect (this is the way\n&gt; I talk when I don&#39;t have time to think out what I say\n&gt; which is pretty much whenever I&#39;m not typing) I have\n&gt; gained extreme amounts of imagination, and hense\n&gt; impationse with such things as rpgs.

By the way I would do this in polls but\n&gt; &gt; no one&#39;s answering \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mine anymore and I want comments about your\n&gt; &gt; opinions. Would you be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; willing to have a char in a faction made entirely\n&gt; &gt; of proto-humans \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to banish the &quot;demons&quot; from their planets,\n&gt; &gt; and should they be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed to use magic and energon spear and\n&gt; &gt; hammerheads to even the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; odds.
