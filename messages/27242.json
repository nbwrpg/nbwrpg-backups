When me, JP, and KSL had \ndiscussed that rule, we came up with 25 shots for rapid fire, 8 for \nsemi-automatic, 4 for heavy-fire weapons, and 2 for \nmissiles/charges/etc...\n\nOur reasons for coming up with that high number for the rapid fire \nwas that rapid-fire weapons do less damage than heavy-fire and \nmissiles. By rapid fire, I think we meant something like BA&#39;s leg \nguns (more of an annoying than damaging). Since then, people have \ntaken rapid fire to mean quite alot of things, like 25 exploding \narrows (I think I saw that a little while ago), and other things like \nthat. Those are NOT 25 shot weapons, they&#39;re four shot.\n\nIt kinda looked natural to me, untill a member brought it up to me a \nlittle while ago (if that member wants to be identified, they can \nidentify themselves. I don&#39;t know if they want to be ananomous or \nnot), and I can see their point. As they said, bots fired only about \n2 or 3 times at a time in the show, and that is what the rule on gun \nshots was supposed to accomplish.\n\nSo keep in mind that when you&#39;re firing 25 shots, they&#39;re very weak \nshots (as stated above, like BA&#39;s leg guns), and don&#39;t do too much \ndamage. Sonic blasts, optic lasers, exploding arrows, etc, would all \nbelong either in the 8 shots per post zone or the 4 shots per post \nzone. So let&#39;s all try to correct this (I&#39;m not saying it was just \neveryone else; I&#39;m guily of this too).\n\n\n"}}
