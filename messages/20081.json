It \nalways worked, she had to give credit to that.\n\nShe watched him roll over and sit up, but seeing him clench his jaw in pain.\nIron Raptor simply shifted her position and looked towards him, seeing if \nthere was any other damage. There was none other then a few scratches and \nhis broken wing.*\n\n&quot; You hit a few branches, disconnected your processor and broke your wing.&quot;\n\n* But there was a tone of anger in her voice as well as concern. If he \nhadn&#39;t tried to grab her this would have never happened.\nShe growled.*\n\n&quot; And if you ever pull a stunt like that again it won&#39;t be branches that do \nthat to you next time!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then got to all four of her feet and glared towards Prowl, her \neyes narrowed.*\n\n&quot; Now get back to base.&quot;\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
