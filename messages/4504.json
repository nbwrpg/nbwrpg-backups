Passing planets once in a while, watching their moons circle around their hemispheres until eventually moving on to the emptiness of space again.\nThat was what it was like to be dead, like to be on the long journey towards the Matrix�at least for him. In simply words�utterly boring!\nThe images dancing behind closed eyes was not good nor evil, simply�there. A reminder of what it was like to be separated from one&#39;� body...in hope of finding the place where all transformer sparks spent the rest of eternity. Where all were one. But that was not to be for Dinobot, the thoughts of how he had died and of the past battles making him turn back�to begin again.\nBut there was something that had made sense to him now that he thought about it, in this new body but in the same old war. Maybe the reason that he never found the Matrix was because�he wasn�t ready to. He wasn�t ready to give up battle for eternity at rest, no willing to give up the warrior that lobed for action�so he never found it. One might have to be willing to join the Matrix in order to find it, in which he was not.\nSo, that was his conclusion of why he was there right now. Had come back from the depths of time to take up the battle again, with new wits, knowledge and power!\nThat factor suited him just fine, but then why was he feeling more empty inside then he had ever felt before? Was he missing something? The battles were here, the thrill and suspense�what was he missing? It touched the back of his mind that it might be something tin which he had never had in his past life, something that he seemed to need but had no idea what it was.\nIt was frustrating to try and think about what it might be that he was missing but it just kept nagging and wouldn�t go away, perhaps what was needed so close that it caused the nagging�but what?!\nThe thought was quickly dismissed as his internal computer�s voice echoed throughout his mind, the images of his journey towards the Matrix simply replaced by a scan of his systems. The internal voice clearly stated that his body temperature had slightly risen due to some external cause, the thought of the vent was the cause�no doubt. Or even a blanket thrown over him by some observant bot, whatever it was it was slowly raising his temperature�but not quite enough to stop the shivers. But in an attempt to stop the shivers he moved his body a little closer to the warmth of whatever was bringing his temp up.\nHowever, he was a bit curious of what it could be, there was not much harm in finding out for himself.\nWith a rather slow and sleepy movement Dinobot lifted his head from the floor and raised it to his shoulder, his optics still closed, trying to smell if there was in fact some blanket overtop him. When nothing more then the smell of cold steel net his snout he then turned his snout towards his back, if there was something there then he was bound to smell it�even if it was just the warm air of the vent.\nWith a sigh he simply moved his snout onto his back, the sudden scent of something familiar then coming to his senses and then following it. His snout bumped against something soft, almost with a feathery texture to it. With a careless habit he then did something that his species was known for, to simply find out what it was without wasting too much energy. Great White sharks do the same thing when they don�t know what something is, mainly to see if it�s edible.\nHe mouthed it, the action simply being nothing more then biting gently down on the object in meaning to identify it.\nDinobot felt the softness of the object in his mouth but then let it go the familiar feeling of fur in his mouth being something that he didn�t like the taste of. But then something occurred to him and he snouted the soft object again, he knew that smell. His sleepy systems identifying it as a paw of something that he knew, then slowly identifying the scent as Tavatron�s. Tavatron!!\nWith a growl he opened his eyes, taking a moment to focus on the surroundings but then coming to clarity. The furry shape of Tavatron against his back, with her head on her paws in which just happened to be ON his back!\nThe feeling of warmth from her body was obviously what he had felt before, it being a little more comforting but now seeming to be nothing more then strange and alien. And anything alien or strange he met with what he always had before, aggression. Not knowing any other way of dealing with it.\nDinobot narrowed his eyes at the sleeping wolf, how dare she touch him when she knew that he never did like it. It was too�too�foreign! It was something that he didn�t know of, something that wasn�t like him to know of.\nThe thought of moving crossed his mind but then when he went to twitch his tail he found that it hurt like he never thought possible, slowly moving his other limbs proving the same outcome.\nWith a snarl he then gave up, there was hope in the Pit of escaping this situation, nothing else to do other then put up with it.\nBut for some reason he knew that he could put up with it, he could eventually get used to Tavatron against him. But he had no idea why. Perhaps his beast mode�s adaptability? Or some other reason. But it was also a slight comfort to have her so near, knowing that he was not alone�at the moment.\nWith a small growl Dinobot took one last look at Tavatron, and then set his head back down on the floor. \nHe closed his eyes but this time it took him a bit longer to fall to sleep, the question of why he still found the fembot�s presence so comforting working out it�s own solution.\nThen, darkness engulfed the warrior again�lost in the timeless void in which was his subcoucious*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
