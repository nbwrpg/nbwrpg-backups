He \nhad found it while doing patrolls, back in the time when the Ark was still in \ngood condition, and the Alliance was on the Maximals&#39; side. He glances at \nSpears, walking beside him.\n\nSuddenly an urge to pick her up over comes him (my chars have been having \nlot&#39;s of urge&#39;s lately, havn&#39;t they?), Striker not resisiting it one bit as \nhe swoops Spears off her feet with a quick motion, picking her up and hoping \nthat she wouldn&#39;t resist.\n\n"}}
