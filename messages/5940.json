She faced high winds, hail and \n&gt; snow.  She headed into the wind and kept a straight course.  She \nwas \n&gt; hit by large hail stones.  One hit her wing. She flew down and \n&gt; landed.  She transformed into bot mode.  With her wing damaged, she \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to fly for a while.  It needed time to heal.  She \n&gt; kept walking with her face down to help block the wind and snow.  \nShe \n&gt; stopped and stood still.  She realized her emotions had gotten her \nin \n&gt; trouble again.  Here  she was, running away from one problem and \n&gt; getting into another one.  She came to the conclusion that she \nwould \n&gt; have to go back to the base.  She would have to face Lunarpine and \n&gt; deal with her feelings.  She hated her emotional side.  She wanted \nto \n&gt; get rid of it.  It always messed up her logic circuits.  She opened \n&gt; her comm-link. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey Lunarpine. I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll...Oh never mind.&quot;  She closed her \nlink.  \n&gt; She forgot about the bot trying to kill her.  She forgot about how \n&gt; any pred could home in on her signal.  She was too deep in \nthought.  \n&gt; She started walking south, back to the mazimal base.  But since she \n&gt; couldn&#39;t fly, it would take her a while. Especially in a storm.\n\n\n"}}
