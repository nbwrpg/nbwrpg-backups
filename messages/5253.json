He remembered being in the forest, trying\n&gt;to escape a granade, but next part he remembered him waking up in CR fluid.\n&gt;He paniced a little. His eyes were wide, looking around the area, finding\n&gt;himself in familiar surroundings. It was the cave of the Predacon base.\n&gt;\n&gt;He shook his head and stood up. He looked over and saw Stingtra.

Come on. Wake up? I think \n&gt;we\n&gt; &gt;should just put him in a CR Tank or Chamber. I think CR Tank would be\n&gt; &gt;better. *Stingtra stands up holding Quickstrike steps up to a CR Tank and\n&gt; &gt;lowers Quickstrike in and watching him to see if he&#39;s gonna wake up*\n&gt; &gt;Stingtra: Quickstrike?
