Again, my dad with his War \n&gt; Games. Anyway, tomorrow I get on a plane for Washington, and won&#39;t \nbe \n&gt; back till late Thursday. Please, I beg you, could someone send me \nand \n&gt; e-mail on Thursday, re-capping everything that happened since my \nlast \n&gt; post till the RPG. I would owe you so much. Until Thursday, Logo \ncan \n&gt; have Starscream and Vulois, and Yanshosh can have Fliq. I don&#39;t \nwant \n&gt; to give the Trainers to anyone. Their too important. CYA Thursday!\n\n\n"}}
