After all,\na\n&gt; predacon sabertooth tiger kitten needs to stretch her legs once in a\nwhile.\n&gt; She went outside and started running into the dense underbush.  She was\n&gt; growling a kitten growl and having fun.  She saw a small butterfly and\n&gt; decided to chase it.  She swatted at it and  growled, trying to be as\nfierce\n&gt; as she could.  She ran about 4 miles before she stopped and looked around.\n&gt; She sat down and tried to get her barings. She hadn&#39;t payed attention to\nhow\n&gt; she got there in the first place, so she had no idea how she got there.\nShe\n&gt; called out a kitten roar and hoped someone might help her back to her\n&gt; friends.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
