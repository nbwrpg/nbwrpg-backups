All of a sudden the window that had been\nsupporting Needlenose shattered in sending him flailing into the ship\nstraight for Spinister.  Quake stood and locked his knees in the\nflight so as not to fall over.  Scrapper got to the controls and\npondered how to land.  &quot;Havotron, my lord, I have found a large\ngeographical hieght sticking out of the ground on the island we are\nheading at.  There is a solid H20 format on the top that proves to be\nsoft.  If we hit it we shall survive.&quot; Scrapper said.\n\n&quot;Very well, get to it everyone.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
