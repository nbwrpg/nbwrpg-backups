She looked down at her communicator but then back up at Prowl, Plintissa was the enemy now...why would she be at the base?\nShe breather an annoyed sigh/growl as she then turned towards the doors of the room, she was busy enough without having to worry about other bots in which were branded traitors. But she thought that she might as well go and see what Plintissa wanted, no harm in that.\nIron Raptor walked up to the doors but then turned to Prowl before she exited.*\n\n&quot; Excuse me but I have some other business to attend to. Prowl. You&#39;re left in charge here until my return. If any other bots come then seat them and prepare them for the meeting...please.&quot;\n\n* She was just about to turn and walk out of the doors when she remembered her plans to copy the Predacon&#39;s defense systems, then then looked back at Prowl.*\n\n&quot; Oh, I almost forgot. And please bring up the 3-d scan of both the Predacon&#39;s ship and the Ark on the main holo-screen. I need it for a demo when I get back.&quot;\n\n* And with that she then walked through the doors and began to make her way towards the front doors of the ship, passing room after room until she came to the front doors of the Ark.\nShe looked about for any transformers but there was none to see, where were they all?\nIron Raptor shook her head before she pushed the doors open and then exited outside, sighting Plintissa and Dracona as she closed the doors behind her.\nShe armed her weapons but kept them in their holds as she then walked a bit towards Plintissa, she wasn&#39;t sure if her old friend would fire on her but she knew for a fact that she wasn&#39;t about to let either one inside of the base.\nHer expression was stern and serious, if they had something to say then they had better say it quick.*\n\n&quot; I have a meeting to attend so say what you have to say quickly, I don&#39;t have all day.&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
