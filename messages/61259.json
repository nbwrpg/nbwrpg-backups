I want to explain something.&quot;\nThe sobbing female stopped crying and looked up at the valkyrie.  Tears streamed from the corners of her optics, but she stood and followed Organics.  They ntered the dining room and Wolfblade collapsed in a chair.  Organics got them both a glass of enegon, and sat next to the smaller femme.\n&quot;I understand you greive, I wish he was still here too, but it&#39;s not a lost cause.&quot;\n&quot;What?&quot; Wolfblade asked,&quot;you mean, he did go and join them, like Kup said?&quot;\nOrganics was a little suprised Kup told her Malice joined the Minions volentarily, but dismissed it.\n&quot;No.  In fact, he fought with such a feriocity, any Decepticon would cower befoe him.  They would come and come, and he continued to throw them aside.  But he got too tired, they finally swarmed him, and captured him.  They ran away after that, he broke their will to fight, he fought well-&quot;\n&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; Wolfblade yelled, standing suddenly and slamming her fists into the table.\n&quot;HE&#39;S NOT DEAD!  STOP TALKING ABOUT HIM LIKE HE&#39;S DEAD!&quot;\nOrganics kept the cool exterior, and stood to comfort the smaller bot.  Wolfblade broke into sobs again, and leaned against Organics.\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean it like that,&quot; Organics said, holding Wolfblade by the shoulders,&quot;we&#39;ll get him back, Rodimus and the others are already working on a plan to gt him back.  Please keep faith in the others, we&#39;ll get Malice back, don&#39;t worry.&quot;\nWolfblade stopped sniffling and took a few deep breaths.\n&quot;Alright, thank you Organics.  Just don&#39;t tell anyone about this,&quot; she said, laughing a little.\nOrganics laughed a litle and sat back down.
