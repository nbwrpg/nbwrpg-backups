I assumed that the weapon fired on Nightrazor was fired rapidly l=\r\nike a machine gun. Nightrazor&#39;s aft-plating from near midway to near his bo=\r\nosters was hit with bullets in a line along his frame as he shot forward an=\r\nd upwards. for a brief moment his aft stealth shielding failed with the dam=\r\nage, but it quickly reasserted itself. \n\nPreston \n(Nightrazr)\n\n--- In nbwrp=\r\ng@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;warriorazure@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Did Nightrazor =\r\nget hit or not?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercy=\r\nclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Nic &lt;warriorazure@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chop=\r\n and Brody were about to report, well, nothing, when the air over\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n geyserous area seemed to cool. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chop (whispering): Brody, don=\r\n&#39;t act surprised, but I think we got\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that bastard. Let&#39;s do a subtle =\r\npass.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brody (whispering back): Right! I&#39;m switching to thermal=\r\n scan.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The hot air fuming upwards effectively broke under a co=\r\noler cushion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that didn&#39;t move. Chop rose in the air, targeting the an=\r\nomally and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; armed a magazine of tracking bullets. As he flew over it, =\r\nhe fired\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the whole magazine.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nightrazor simply watched the d=\r\nuo from his vantage point. As they rose\n&gt; &gt; and searched he looked at them =\r\nclosely. He could tell that the ship had\n&gt; &gt; no clue as to his where abouts=\r\n, but these two were a different matter. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is only as they got c=\r\nloser he realized what they were doing. The\n&gt; &gt; buffeting heat from the sur=\r\nface would be stalled or redirected by his\n&gt; &gt; presence. Here in this locat=\r\nion he could be discovered by indirect\n&gt; &gt; means. Then his attention was ca=\r\nught by the click of a magazine being\n&gt; &gt; loaded into position. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nith a burst of power he shot foward and up, putting as much distance\n&gt; &gt; be=\r\ntween him and the warmth comming from the surface below, even as the\n&gt; &gt; fu=\r\nll clip of trackeing bullets were unleashed by Chop. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Strafing sho=\r\nts ripped into his aft armor causing pain to flood his\n&gt; &gt; systems and his =\r\ncloaking field flickered. For the briefest of moments\n&gt; &gt; Nightrazor&#39;s aero=\r\ndynamic ebony form was revealed as he moved away . . .\n&gt; &gt; and then was gon=\r\ne as he passed out from beneath them. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For another moment ionized =\r\nparticles from his engines attracted the\n&gt; &gt; attention of the bullets from =\r\nChop as Nightrazor pushed his engiens\n&gt; &gt; temporarilly beyond what his cloa=\r\nking shields could handle. But the\n&gt; &gt; bullets were quickly left behind as =\r\nthe ship rose further into the air\n&gt; &gt; and the cloaking field restablished =\r\nits presence. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nightrazor considered firing back as he fled, but h=\r\ne knew as soon as he\n&gt; &gt; completely dropped his shields the other ship woul=\r\nd no doubt open fire,\n&gt; &gt; and he was not here for conflict. With a boost of=\r\n power, now well\n&gt; &gt; within his cloaking field&#39;s ability to mask he rose hi=\r\ngher and higher\n&gt; &gt; into the air. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He would either have to watch f=\r\nrom a distance or move on, he was really\n&gt; &gt; in no position to take on two =\r\ndefenders plus a well armed ship.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; (Nightrazor)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;      \n&gt; _____________________________________________=\r\n_______________________________________\n&gt; &gt; You rock.
