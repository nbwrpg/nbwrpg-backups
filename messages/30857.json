Got a mirror?&quot;\n\nSquizzy::\nShe turned from her work bench and looked at Feline.  She dropped the \nbeaker that was in her hand and stared at Feline. &quot;Ah, oh boy. I \nthink I did too good a job.&quot;  Squizzy glanced down at her own body \nand started to feel seriously out classed.  Trying to hide her own \nextremely low self image, she smiled,&quot;Well, I think I&#39;ll need to arm \nyou with a proton excellerator unit and a plasma rifle. And I&#39;ll call \nfor a clean up crew.&quot;\n\nFeline:;\nShe looked at Squizzy with a perplexed look on her face. &quot;Uh, why all \nthat?&quot;\n\nSquizzy:\n&quot;Because, the guys will be drooling in the  halls once they see you \nand the floors are slippery already. Second, You&#39;ll need to fight off \nthe guys with a fight to get thier hands on you.&quot;\n\nFeline::\nShe smiled at Squizzy&#39;s words.  She turned and looked at her \nreflection in the side of the CR tank.  She gazed in amazement at her \nreflection. She was now a stunningly beautiful black panther bot.  \nShe had soft black fur that felt like velvet to the touch.  She still \nhad her tall, slender,beautiful female figure.  She smiled and saw \nher wonderfully white panther fangs. Her eyes were of saphire blue \nand her whiskers were long and sensual.  She turned and looked at \nSquizzy. &quot;Thank you. I look and feel wonderful. Let me know how I \ncould repay you.&quot;\n\nSquizzy:\n&quot;Oh, it&#39;s nothing really. Go and do a test run. I&#39;d be careful if I \nwere you. You&#39;ll have half the males on the ship chasing you down the \nhalls.&quot; she said with a chuckle. \n\nFeline::\nShe smirked. &quot;I hope so. I do hope so.&quot; And with that, she turned and \nleft the lab.  She walked down the hall and towards the bridge, \nhoping to run into a few bots to see what the reaction might be. \n\n\n"}}
