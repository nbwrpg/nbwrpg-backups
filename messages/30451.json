KitKat2 is for Drillbit&#39;s team and is with the \nBlackfortress group.  KitKat3 is working for Zardus. But since both \nKitKat&#39;s think they ar the original, and they look exactly like the \noriginal, and they both think and opperate the same, you&#39;ll need to \ncheck the number infront of the character.  OK, this concludes the \npublic service announcement for this portion of the RPG. Thank you. \n\nLogo. \n\n::KitKat3::\nShe went outside and left the base.  She was headed fo the black \nfortess.  She knew that once she was there, she would find her old \ntroops there. She couldn&#39;t wait to see them.  She hoped Drillbit was \nstill alive and well, as well as the rest of her troops.  She high \ntailed it over the trails and ran as fast as she could.  She was in a \nbig hurry, her spark just had to see Drillbit once again.\n\n::KitKat2::\nShe looked at the other team mates that had returned.  She looked at \nBludgeon and winked. &quot;It&#39;s great to see you as well. You know, it&#39;s \nhard to find a great working team of bots these days. I&#39;m glad you \nall made it.&quot;\nShe went just outside the base entrance for a bit of fresh air.  It \nfelt great to have the old team back.  She did miss Terrosaur and the \nothers. She missed Quickstrike and Rowdy Wolf. She wondered what \nwould have happened had not that monster in the cave taken Rowdy. She \nshrugged her shoulders, &quot;Ancient history.&quot; she said with a sigh. \nShe lowered her head at the memory of having to kill LandMine and \nTimebomb.  She still felt guilty after all this time about having to \nkill a member of her pack to save that bot&#39;s suffering at the hands \nof the enemy.  She shook her head,&quot;It&#39;s not easy living with the \nguilt is it? I wonder if other leaders feel remorse as well, or is it \njust me?&quot;  She sat down and looked up at the sky. The clouds lazily \npassed on by.  She sniffed the air and thought she smelled a wolf. \nShe shook her head and sniffed again.  She only picked up her own \nscent. She continued to think of the mistakes and triumphs along her \ntour of leader.  She knew one thing for sure, she would lead again. \n\n::KitKat3::\nShe neared the Black Fortress.  She smiled and knew she still had 5 \nmiles to go, but she felt like it was only a city block.  She wanted \nto see her old pack again. \n\n\n"}}
