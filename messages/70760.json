I give you a chance to be my general in\n&gt; this new army that I am building.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The dark floating figure next to Cryotek rustled, turneing its optics\n&gt; on Cryotek for a moment.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Now now Obsidian.&quot; He said, his voice cold humor as he spoke without\n&gt; taking his optics from Hydras, &quot;You well know your place in my\n&gt; armies.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The dark floating figure called Obsidian turned to coldy look At\n&gt; Hydras, Malice in his optics.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It would seem that Obsidian we rather that you you didn&#39;t join us.&quot;\n&gt; Cryotek said as he chuckled evilly, &quot;What say you Hydras?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
