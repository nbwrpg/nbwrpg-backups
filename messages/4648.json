He had ruined treads, and just before he could\n&gt;really beat on Unitron, he re-treated. Coward! This isn&#39;t over.\n&gt;Vulois walks over to the CR Chamber, when Battera comes in.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Hey, Battera. You just missed a great battle. I&#39;ve set up some\n&gt;quarters for you, so you can go rest their.(Than in a whisper he\n&gt;adds) I&#39;ll tell you, Soundwave and our newcomer Terminess the details\n&gt;when I come out of the chamber.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Vulois enters the CR Chamber\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;Terminess smiles. Unitron barely missed those missles. Next time,\n&gt;after a few more calibrations, he won&#39;t be able to. But this project\n&gt;will have to be put on hold for a few days. She has to go get her pod\n&gt;so she can start working on the ship out of here.\n&gt;\n&gt;Terminess quietly leaves the Predacon base.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
