They flew\ntowards the single large volcano that dominanted the island. The skies\nhere were choked with smoke and ash, while the grounds, nearly bereft\nof vegatation, were burnt and ruined, only brown whisps of life were\nable to hang on tenaciously in this barren rocky landscape, blown\nabout by hot winds. In several places large gouts of obsidan like\nstone rose from the ground as if thrust through the ground by the\nviolent shaking from beneath. They resmbled the claws and bones of\nsome terrifyingly huge mishappen beast.\n\nIt was over this that marauder flew, carrying Lamia. He finally came\nto rest near the top of the volcano, on a lonely ledge. Setting her\ndown he shifted into his robot mode.\n\nHe smiled at her as he gestured at the vista of destruction that was\naround them, &quot;Welcome home Lamia.&quot; he said, his voice dark and cold.\n&quot;This is only the begining.&quot;\n\nBehind them a previously hidden door in the cliff face itself opened\nrevealing only darkness inside. Red lights slowly came on, looking\nlike burning embers that lit the interior, revelaing a large hall that\nled further into the mountain itself.\n\n&quot;Come.&quot; Marauder said, &quot;we have much to do.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
