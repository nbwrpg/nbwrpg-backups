She came to the Quarters section.  She mapped out \nwhere the rooms where in relation to other parts of the she had been \nto already.   She went futher down and came to the lab area.  She \nwalked into the room and looked around.  She saw the tables and other \nwork benches.  She saw the autoguns in the celing.  She saw the CR \nchambers just in the next room.  She smiled, she had been here \nbefore.  She walked back into the hallway.   She saw a stairwell \ngoing downward.  She decided to expoler the ship and hat was what she \nwas going to do.  She walked down the stairs towards what parts of \nthe ship, she didn&#39;t know.  she found herself walking along part of \nthe engine room.  She smiled and mapped, in her memory banks, all \nthat she could see.  She kept walking and looking.  If someone caught \nher, she would just say she was lost. After all, she as new to the \nship, she thought.\n\n\n"}}
