She smiled \nat him and turned to face her work.  She was wanting to take some \ntime off from the war and spent it with him.  She wanted to go \nfishing and walking around with him. Sit and watch the sun set, and \nthen after a bit watch the sun rise.  She knew that when that \nhappened, she would find ways keep him awake long enough to watch the \nsun rise. She smiled at the thought. She loved just being near him \nand with him.  For now, she would have to be content with sitting \nnext to him in the dining hall. She gave a dissapointed sigh, she \ndidn&#39;t want to have to wait untill the end of the war to be with the \none bot she loved.  \n\nshe turned to the new bot. &quot;How&#39;s that patch coming?&quot; She looked at \nher&#39;s. &quot;I&#39;m done with this one.&quot; She went over and grabbed another \npeice of sheet metal and started to weld another section onto the \nhull.\n\n\n"}}
