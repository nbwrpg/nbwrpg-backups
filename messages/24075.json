He didn&#39;t like being left alone with those two, even if \nTarantsulas was half trusting. He needed to get away. He needed time \nto figure out what was wrong with himself, and find out how to right \nit. Maybe he could force some repairs onto it.\n\nHe crawled out from his hidding spot, looked left and right, then \nskittered to the exit-way of the cave. He stopped and transformed to \nrobot mode. \n\nSnow. That slagging awful stuff. He wasn&#39;t made to deal with it, but \nright now, he had no choice. He stepped out, and quickly shut the \ndoor behind him. He walked out into the cold, chilling his metal \narmor. Within a few steps, he looked down at the edge of the walkway, \nwhich looked oddly to him. It was the side of a mountain. Slag, where \ndid they take him to?\n\nDown below, there was something going on. Battle, that what it was. \nHe couldn&#39;t go down there, even if most of his insticts would love to \nbe in it. He was not fuctional enough to deal with it. He was \ndeprived of energy and with dizzy spells. \n\nHe walked off to the side, down to a rocky slide. He put one foot \ndown, looking at the slope. He could get down there if he was \ncareful. He leaned to the side, grabbed a hold of a rock at the side, \nand took a few steps down sideways. \n\nWithin a few seconds, looking down, his vision started to spin. He \nheld on tight to the side of the moutain. He closed his optics \ntightly. If something like this kept up, he would fall. He waited a \nfew more moments until his dizziness lightened up. He then make the \nrest of his decent down to the foot of the mountain.\n\n\n"}}
