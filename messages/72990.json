Yet if Magmatron kne=\r\nw of it, perhaps he may know what would come next.  Ever so gradually, Tucs=\r\non begins to move faster and faster as feet seem to lift off the ground bef=\r\nore they even touch it, and then it comes.  He lifts his body off the groun=\r\nd and spin kicks the wall, with great force, attempting to weaken the wall.=\r\n\n\nDon&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful for things you alrea=\r\ndy posses.
