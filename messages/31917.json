Today was the day, 1 year ago, that i joined\n&gt; &gt; this RPG.  I had\n&gt; &gt; been doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; searches all over the internet for RPGs, but none\n&gt; &gt; really caught my\n&gt; &gt; eye until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i saw the link- Neo Beast Wars RPG. I decided id\n&gt; &gt; like to check it\n&gt; &gt; out, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fell in love as soon as i read the story and\n&gt; &gt; looked at the\n&gt; &gt; characters.  I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knew i must join immeadiately, so i used an old\n&gt; &gt; favorite character,\n&gt; &gt; Torca.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My profile was an immeadiate mode, and i was\n&gt; &gt; pretty stupid when i\n&gt; &gt; was new.  I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remember my first post like it was yesterday.\n&gt; &gt; Torca burst into the\n&gt; &gt; Predacon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; base and put his gun up to Quickstrike and tried\n&gt; &gt; to eliminate his\n&gt; &gt; spark.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Talon got really pissed at me.  But soon i started\n&gt; &gt; to catch on, and\n&gt; &gt; created\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stronger characters and some good stories.  In my\n&gt; &gt; time here in the\n&gt; &gt; RPG, i saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many changes.  I&#39;ve seen ultra-powerful groups\n&gt; &gt; rise and fall,\n&gt; &gt; extremely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; talented RPers come and go(not to mention a lot of\n&gt; &gt; idiots), and\n&gt; &gt; built\n&gt; &gt; &gt; firendships with members.  Id like to thank\n&gt; &gt; Soulstice for his\n&gt; &gt; friendship and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; partnership, Zardus for putting up with me through\n&gt; &gt; my early times,\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone else that ive had the pleasure(or\n&gt; &gt; displeasure) of RPing\n&gt; &gt; with, and i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hope my next year here will be even better.  Just\n&gt; &gt; wanted to get that\n&gt; &gt; off my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
