She \nopened her left forarm panel and installed the small control board \nfor her chips.  She had one in HotRod, one in Battera.  She had only \none chip left to install.  She picked up the chip and put in her arm \nwith the panel.  She then closed her arm panel and smiled.  She could \nnow control the other bots and not lose the controls.  She started \nworking on a plan to get HotRod and Battera over to Zardus.  She knew \nshe had to create a diversion to get them all out and with minimal \ndamage.  She didn&#39;t want to hand damaged goods over to Zardus.  She \nopened her link, &quot;Battera, could you come to the lab please?&quot;\nShe smiled.\n\nBattera::\nShe walked down the hall and to the lab,&quot;Yes, you called for me?&quot;\n\nFeline:: She opened her arm panel and activated the ship inside \nBattera.\n\nBattera::\nShe felt a surge of information flood her mind. She fell to the round \nshaking and then stood up as the chip took control of her.  She \nlooked at Feline. &quot;What is it that you want?&quot; she said in a rather \nrough voice.\n\nFeline::\nShe smiled and walked up close to Battera.  SHe whispered into \nBattera&#39;s ear,&quot;I want you to go to the Allience base and tell Zardus \nthat you now serve him and that I will be going back to the base \nsoon. You are to follow and obey Zardus now. Got it?&quot;\n\nBattera::\nShe smiled evilly and looked at Feline, &quot;Yes, right away.&quot;\nShe then walked out of the lab.  She headed to the entrance and \nstepped outside of the base.  She transformed into her bat mode and \ntook off towards the sky.  She had the distict feeling like she was \nfinally finding her place. \n\n(The chip mostly changes the nature of the bot from maximal to \nPredacon.  All personallity chances from good natured to evil.  And \nmakes the bot prone to obeying who ever installed the chip. But it \ndoesn&#39;t make them slaves completely)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
