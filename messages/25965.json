He levitates from the ground towards the airborn Recklessa, not much\nof an expression in his doom stricken eyes. &quot;You my friend,&quot; he starts to\nboom, his voice different from before, much more hollow, and devoid of\nkidness, &quot;are quite a pain in the tailpipe&quot; flying towards his target with\nmurderous intent in his eyes.\n\n\n\n"}}
