She really did want to know because she had never had any move \nfrom family after her father had died and she had forgotten how it feels \nlike.\nThough, Carnage hadn�t failed to see just how Teltoli had drawn back at her \nquestion, almost as if it was something strange and probably the last thing \nthe fuzor ever expected her to ask. But she had and she wanted to know.\nBut the look in her green eyes dulled slightly as Teltoli began to explain \nit, and it was rather hard for her to hear it when she spoke of how they \nwere always there to support.\nIt was hard for her and she knew it, and she couldn�t possibly really know \nwhat Teltoli was trying to express through her words because she hadn�t \nexperienced anything like it that she could still remember.\nA long time ago: she thought. I knew the answer to this question. But now I \nhave to ask.\nCarnage sighed and then turned her reptilian head so that she was looking \nstraight again, even though she no longer carried her head as high as she \nhad before. Touchy subjects were always hard to explain and deal with but it \nwas all part of every day life. If you couldn�t deal with it then you \ncouldn�t deal with life.\nShe glanced towards Teltoli.** � I would give anything to have a fight with \nmy parents.� Just to hear their voices again: she finished inside of her \nmind.\nTeltoli was so lucky! She had grown up on a nice family and was basically \nprotected all her life, or that was what she was getting from that she told \nher. She had both her parents.\nCarnage looked at her, another question forming on her mind.** � What was \nyour life like when you were growing up?� ** another honest question. But \nCarnage wasn�t asking these just to compare them to her own life, she was \nactually formulating something in her mind which just might help Teltoli \nbecome the warrior she wished to be�if she ever asked her to teach her \nanything.**\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
