He focuses on the insignias they bear on their chest and arms.\nIt is obvious they are neither maximals nor predacons, but he doesn&#39;t \nknow about them. He stays put. They seem to know he is somewhere \naround, but he was lucky enough not to have been truly noticed. \nBesides, their implied threat didn&#39;t bother him. He&#39;d heard and lived \nthrough worse. And he had the big guns right now.\n\nThat&#39;s when he noticed he didn&#39;t anymore. Somehow, the Bullet had been \ndestroyed in high orbit. Forget about the artillery. Although he felt \nlike swearing out loud right now, he was too much in his mission of \nimmobility to try anything. He was a little more vulnerable right now. \nIf they get to find him, he would have to play it safe, but he would \ngladly try to escape against all odd the way Optimus Prime would do \nit.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Torin ambles after her.
