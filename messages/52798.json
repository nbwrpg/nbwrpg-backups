His eyes flash red as he glares \naround with \n&gt; utter hatred and determination.  &quot;First I will avenge you.  Then \nthey shall \n&gt; all leave this world.  This is my solemn promise m&#39;lady.&quot;  He gently \nlays her \n&gt; head back on the ground and stands up.  He glances around quickly \nfinally \n&gt; spotting the one she had been fighting with unconscious not far \naway.  He \n&gt; walks over to Sanguine&#39;s body and stands over her.  He glares at her \n&gt; unconscious form.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;It&#39;s too bad I won&#39;t get to hear you scream.&quot;  He fires a \nconcussion \n&gt; missiles directly at her body, the shockwave sending him flying back \nthrough \n&gt; the air into the trees.

He fires another concussion missile overhead only this \ntime it \n&gt; is tinted with bright red to get the attention of those below him.  \nHe raises \n&gt; his voice so that it can be heard by all on the battlefield above \nthe weapons \n&gt; fire.  &quot;ATTENTION CYBERTRONIANS!
