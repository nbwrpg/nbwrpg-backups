Though we will have more work when Unitron returns, and then even \nmore.  I suggest a short recess to repower ourselves.&quot;\n\n&quot;Agreed, Shockwave.&quot; Firestarter said, walking out of the room and heading \nfor his quarters.\n\nShockwave got up and left the conference room heading for his own quarters \nwhich had once been Vehement&#39;s.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch, Manterror, and Injector were still in the repair bay but were \nover 95% complete and would be out shortly.\n\n---\n\nWith the rest of their army dead in their holographic battle in Iacon, \nReflector leapt forward only to get a foot to his abdomens and he fell to the \nground.\n\n&quot;Nice try.&quot; Sun Crusher smiled, slashing down but Reflector rolled out of the \njust in time and returned fire with an optic blast that nearly knocked \nCrusher off of his feet.  &quot;Then again, this may take a little longer than I&#39;d \nthought.&quot;\n\n---\n\nOutside of the Ramora Sixshot and Ares continued their perimeter patrol.\n\nTransforming to space fighter mode, Sixshot lifted off into the air, Ares \nfollowing his example.  Each armed a pair of missiles and their laser \nweaponry and were ready to wreak havoc on any intruders.  They then spotted \nRainchark and flew towards him, Sixshot activatin a comm. link to the \nunidentified robot.\n\n&quot;Unidentified robot,&quot; he said refering to Rainchark, &quot;identify yourself, your \nfaction, and your intentions.  If you fail to do so you will get a one way \nticket to the great junkyard in the sky!&quot;\n\n"}}
