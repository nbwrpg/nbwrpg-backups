A bright flash emitted from the camera, \nthe flash designed to temporarily disable optic sensors, the flash heading \nfor the Maximals present.\n\n---\n\nVehement&#39;s face contorted into a smile, the robot doing a flip backwards and \ntransforming into the shape of a sword.  The sword hovered for the briefest \nof seconds, not affected by the flash, same as Sun Crusher.  The tip of the \nnine foot long broadsword began to glow a dark emerald.\n\nA bolt lanced out form the tip of the blade, extending into a fifty by fifty \nradius, the middle of the blast pointed at Iron Raptor.\n\nControl returned to Vehement, who instantly felt more drained then he ever \nhad, scanners telling him he had lost 80% of all his power in that single ye \npowerful blast.  He transformed back to robot mode, feeling but not showing \nhis weakness.\n\n\n"}}
