I have been an avid RP=\r\n&#39;er for \nquite some time. I have played table-top (since the mid to late \n8=\r\n0&#39;s), MUSH/MUX/MUD sites (since the early 90&#39;s) as well as PBeM&#39;s \n(for a c=\r\nouple of years now.) Usually the biggest problem you have \nwhen playing a l=\r\not of characters is focus. Generally table-top and \nMU*** sites are real ti=\r\nme play so it VERY difficult to play more than \n2 MAYBE 3 at a time without=\r\n delays creeping in to the RP or \ncharacters becoming 2 dimentional with on=\r\nly a single line of post. \nHere on PBeM&#39;s, because you write when you are a=\r\nble, it is easier to \nplay multi-characters however we still have problems.=\r\n People tend to \nforget details of what all thier different characters are =\r\ndoing, \nwhere they are suppose to going, and what theier goals are.\n&gt; \n&gt; I =\r\nbelieve that is sorta what happened with Shard. \n&gt; \n&gt; When Robo left, mysel=\r\nf and Airly picked up his characters, but now \nit is becoming a bit unwield=\r\ny as we try to remember what his \ncharacters are suppose to be doing in add=\r\nition to what are own \ncharacters are doing. Perhaps we should scale back t=\r\no a reasonable \nnumber, that way we can focus properly, and hopefully folks=\r\n don&#39;t get \nlost in the overload. \n&gt; \n&gt; Right now I am running: Cyclonus, S=\r\ncourge, Marauder (Malik), \nRodimus, Lord Elder, Skorponok (and Zarak) - and=\r\n then there are the \nminions. However up till now Cyc, Scourge and Rodimus =\r\nhave been \nunconscious and Skorponok has been largely silent, making it a b=\r\nit \neasier, but that of course is changing. \n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps I will drop a few=\r\n of these in the very near furture to make \nthings easier on me\n&gt; \n&gt; I look=\r\n forward to any comment or thoughts on ways we can make this \nplace better.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; Wrom: SQHYUCDDJB=\r\nLVLMHAALPTCXLYRWTQTIPWIGYOKSTT\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Monday,=\r\n September 15, 2008 6:11:44 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: OOC: Shall we speak?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI know in the past there have been some RPs I have not been keeping \n&gt; up w=\r\nith, but at least I made that attempt to notify that I would be \n&gt; missing =\r\nor not around if I was too busy. But when I had a little \nmore \n&gt; time and =\r\ncould, I always come back to the RPs. My focus is upon the \n&gt; story and the=\r\n regular interaction with other players. I&#39;m telling a \n&gt; story not just fo=\r\nr my own fun and benefit, but for those out there \n&gt; who may be lurking and=\r\n reading theses stories. And believe me, \npeople \n&gt; DO come and glance at t=\r\nhese. I&#39;ve had a fan base in the past from \n&gt; some of my role playing stori=\r\nes. Those stories only fail or end \nwhen \n&gt; other players do NOT remain inv=\r\nolved. \n&gt; \n&gt; Get involved people! If you join ANY Role Playing game or stor=\r\ny, \nyou \n&gt; MUST realize that you should make that commitment to role play \n=\r\noften. \n&gt; Take that time. Trust me, it&#39;s not that hard to do so. Otherwise,=\r\n \nif \n&gt; no rules or guidelines have been laid down how often you should \npl=\r\nay, \n&gt; then state how often you can play OOC in the list or forum you are \n=\r\n&gt; involved in. Get to know the story and how fast that pace is. \n&gt; Especial=\r\nly when you are interacting with other people... those \npeople \n&gt; wait on y=\r\nou. Some RPs I&#39;ve been in in the past... people will \n&gt; continue to post an=\r\nd leave you behind if you can&#39;t keep up with a \n&gt; story. But your lack of c=\r\nommitment to something you joined is not \nthe \n&gt; fault of others. \n&gt; \n&gt; Per=\r\nhaps this is rude of me... but I&#39;ve been doing this a long, long \n&gt; time.. =\r\nthese online role playing stories. I&#39;m only passing along to \n&gt; you what wa=\r\ns said to me and what has happened to me. It can be \n&gt; frustrating and turn=\r\ns people off when you are left behind. But \nthere \n&gt; is a difference in how=\r\n you are left behind. Don&#39;t be left behind at \n&gt; your own fault cause you r=\r\nefuse to take the time to post. \nRemember... \n&gt; you are affecting someone e=\r\nlse. Another player&#39;s character is held \nup \n&gt; by you and they can&#39;t do any=\r\nthing until you post something, whether \n&gt; IC or OOC. \n&gt; \n&gt; You join, be co=\r\nmmitted. And use communication! \n&gt; \n&gt; ~Lady B\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroup=\r\ns. com, &quot;xochitla2006&quot; &lt;xochitla2006@ ...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ok after medit=\r\nating a while our fellow living, I felt some how \n&gt; guilty \n&gt; &gt; of that hap=\r\npened. I admit the part that I have with and I feel \nthat \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; have to=\r\n care more of this RPG. In order to improve our situation \n&gt; &gt; here, I have=\r\n follow suggestion in order to keep things running:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. If a player=\r\n is waitting an answer for another player and that \n&gt; &gt; answer didnt come, =\r\nI strongly suggest that you char focus in \n&gt; another \n&gt; &gt; player.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n2. In case that your char is stuck in a situation, move him/her \nin \n&gt; &gt; or=\r\nder to you can interac with actives or more receptives players.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Also Stac suggest follow:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. If somoene is going to be involved=\r\n, they need to make that \n&gt; &gt; commitment to post on a regular basis. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 4.  Players at least are active and post at least once a day to \n&gt; keep=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; the story moving and not leave other players who are involved in \n&gt; t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; dark and in hiatus... \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I Know that above is not always pos=\r\nible, but I suggest that you \ntry \n&gt; &gt; to post at least once x day or not b=\r\ne so absent for so long.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Stac says &quot;When I get involved, I=\r\n get involved&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also  want to admit that I dont get so invo=\r\nlved lately and I \nwant \n&gt; &gt; to be the first one to be involved again in th=\r\nis RPG.
