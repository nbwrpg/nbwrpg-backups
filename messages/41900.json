I&#39;m me\nand you are you. And yes Hogan did become famous in WWF, as did Scott\nHall. But all the other names I mentioned became famous in NWA/WCW. Even\nNash was Vinnie Vegas in WCW before Diesel in WWF.\n\nAnd Flair is old now, but he is still the best. Thats why he is a 11\ntime NWA World Heavyweight Champ, 8 time WCW World Heavyweight Champ,\nand 2 time WWF World Heavyweight Champ. And the older wrestlers in WCW\ngot the gold because they desearved it. \n\nAll I can say is the 4 Horsemen need to come back. A perfect 4 for the\ngroup would be Ric Flair(cause he has always led them), David Flair(he\nis Flair&#39;s son he desearves the spot), Chris Benoit, and Dean\nMalenko.(Since Benoit and Malenko were Horsemen in WCW) Also Arn\nAnderson of course. He cant wrestle anymore, but he can be a part of it.\n\n"}}
