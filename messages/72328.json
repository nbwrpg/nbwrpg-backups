You seem to=\r\n be more understanding than the usual lot.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He walks with=\r\n Big Convoy, as if walking beside Lord Elder.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nIf BIG CONVOY were human he would probrably look like Arnold&lt;br&gt;\nSchwarzen=\r\negger as he did in &#39;Predator&#39; or perhaps &#39;Conan&#39; with perhaps&lt;br&gt;\na little =\r\nof a &#39;Captain America&#39; kind of a feel. He was tall, massive&lt;br&gt;\nand he had =\r\na confident air about him, almost a swagger. He felt like a&lt;br&gt;\ngrizzled ol=\r\nd soldier, and yet still strong enough to handle anything&lt;br&gt;\nthat was thro=\r\nwn at him.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHe grunted, &quot;I am sure you stand for truth, justice and=\r\n the&lt;br&gt;\nCybertronian way?&quot; There was a bit of dark humor in his words as h=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\nwalked with TUSCON. &quot;I am here because I was captured and brought&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nhere, just as you have been brought here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBIG had brought TUSCON=\r\n into a large holding area where many different&lt;br&gt;\ntransformers were being=\r\n held.
