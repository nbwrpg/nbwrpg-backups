She knew that she was no \nfighter.  She felt dissapointed in herself.  She thought she could make him \nthink that she could make it.  But she failed herself as well as him.  She \nknew he was a fighter, a better hunter.  He would survive.  She transformed \ninto her bot mode.  She lifted her head, swallowed her spark, and walked in. \n  She saw Lunarpine out of the corner of her eye.  She didn&#39;t turn to face \nhim, she just kept walking.  She knew her emotions were her weakness.  But \nshe couldn&#39;t help it.  Her spark was as big as the rest of her. Normally she \nwouldn&#39;t mind, but now, she hated that fact.  She just walked to her room \nand sat on her bed.  She leaned forward, rested her head in her hands and \nstarted to cry again.  She hated and liked him at the same time.  And now \nshe couldn&#39;t even look at him.  She wanted to rip out her spark. She just \nsat there and let her spark burn.\n\n\n---original message----\nFrom:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\nDate: Wed Jul 5, 2000 10:44pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nLunarpine could see her pain, Shadow Wing wasn&#39;t programmed as a\nwarrior. He saw that now, he fealt for her but knew that a wolf and\nan owl weren&#39;t meant to work together, were they? He turned back to\nthe crow and gobbled it up. In his world scavenging food was just as\nimportant as hunting it. Shadow Wing was a good hunter as an owl but\nshe didn&#39;t seam to realize that she was more. she has the ability to\nchange into something that gives her an edge yo the hunt. If she\ncould learn that, she might survive. In the cold he&#39;d want her at his\nside, but he still wasn&#39;t sure how she&#39;d fight in this climate. Her\nemotions were her weakness. One moment she wanted the hunt, the kill,\nthe next moment she wanted to run away and hide.\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; he said more to himself than to her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I had to\ndo that to help you survive.&quot;\nLunarpine wiped his mouth and headed back to base, alone again.\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
