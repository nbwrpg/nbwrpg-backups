Destructor offered \nus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; help, the alliance offered us help, I think we should move one \n&gt; step \n&gt; &gt; &gt; at a time. We have a five bot group right now, Destructor makes \n&gt; &gt; six, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dollen and GoldenEye will be back soon theres eight add the \n&gt; &gt; alliance \n&gt; &gt; &gt; forces and we&#39;ll have a small army working with us, and then, \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; followers will join us or fall before us, and Megatron will be \n&gt; our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; first victim.&quot; Phobias eyes lit up at the prospect of being the \n&gt; bot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; behind the bot who joined the forces of Predacon and Alliance, \n&gt; &gt; being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the unknown shadow that the great leaders throughout history \nhave \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cast. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She thought about the situation.  She didn&#39;t know the bots \nwho \n&gt; &gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so far, helping htem out.  Usually when one helped, they \n&gt; expected \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; favor returned, and with more in return than what was \noffered.  \n&gt; &gt; She \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looked at Phobia,&quot;Tell me, who is this Destrustor?  And why \ndid \n&gt; &gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; help us? No Pred would just help and expect nothing in \nreturn. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if Megatron is without followers, who does that leave us \nwith? \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heard that most of our groups is gone.&quot;  She looked down and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sighed. &quot;I know that I can only trust you and Drillbit right \n&gt; now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She looked up at Phobia.  &quot;I think it would be best if we \n&gt; takled \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this Desctuctor. Then we need to get our group together.  I  \n&gt; know \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&quot;m \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not the only one who wants to get Megatron for deserting us.  \n&gt; And \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once Megatron is done with, we can then start looking for a \n&gt; base \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own.  BUt Megatron has to be delt with. As long as he is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; around, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we will never have a moment&#39;s rest.  After that,&quot; she \nsuddenly \n&gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angry look on her face,&quot;After that, I want to pay back those \n&gt; &gt; &gt; slagging \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maximals.&quot; She relaxed, &quot;What do you think Phobia?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;re currently at the base of a Predacon named \nDestrucror, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Starscreem went ahead to the alliance base, Goldeneye and \n&gt; &gt; Dollen \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering returning to us and Megatron is currently \nwithout \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; followers I suggest we meet the alliance, track him down \nand \n&gt; &gt; take \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; care of our problems one at a time.&quot; Phobia knew to leave \nout \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; part about Destructors offer so he&#39;d have an ace in the \nhole \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fell through.
