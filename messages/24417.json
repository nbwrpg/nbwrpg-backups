Safe and secure, \nVenus disarmed the girl from all her visable weapons.\n    Ominous came to look at the bot. She seemed to be a Predacon....but she \nwould have to be converted to serve them. It might be a messy procedure. \n&quot;We&#39;ll begin when that blast she took heals. In the meantime, I want \nOdiphious to monitor her. Akron will go and see where they&#39;re taking \nDarkmouse, and from there we shall attack.&quot;\n    &quot;Yes sir. I will prep the surgery room. Venus, set up the Liquid Energon \ntransfer tube. And keep an emergency CR chamber on hand, just in case.&quot; \nSubcommander Putnam ordered as Ominous walked away to the bridge.\n\n    Akron skidded out from the base, headed in the direction of Darkmouses \nbase. If she was there, she could follow them, if not score the litte vermine \nfor herself.\n\n    \n\n"}}
