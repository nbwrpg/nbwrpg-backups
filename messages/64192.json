Their names were Guardia, Ravenchi=\r\nef,\nand Salveo.  Together with Perseus, they were the Pasificus Maximals. \n=\r\nThey lived on the island of Atlantis, and hoped to stay out of combat;\nhowe=\r\nver, they made sure to keep their fighting skills sharp so that\nthey would =\r\nnot be defenceless.  They vowed not to use force unless\nthey were defending=\r\n themselves or a defenceless person.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but Ra=\r\nvenchief and Guardia: you go and\nfind out where this pod is.
