She unfolded her wings and \nstretched.  She yawned a bit and looked around the room.  She slowly \nsat up on the edge of her bed.  Sleeping for that long a time does \nmake one a bit stiff in the joints.  She walked around her room a bit \nto wake up and walk out the stiffness.  She noticed that she wasn&#39;t \ncalled for. No one had come to her room to notify her of the leader \nreturning to the base. She folded her wings behind her, opened he \ndoor to her room and walked out into the hallway.  She went along \nuntill she came to the mess hall.  She went to the food dispencer and \ngot a few items.  She sat down and munched on an apple.  She wondered \nwhat happened? Had the leader returned and just to busy to tak to \nher? Or had the leader returned at all?\n\n\n"}}
