She hated mind \n&gt; controllers. With all her spark she hated them.  She stared at her \n&gt; wrists as he worked on her. She was seeing herself kill the High \n&gt; Predacon council leader, SythWave. She smiled at seeing his mech \n&gt; fluid on her blade. She remembered when she found out that it was \nhim \n&gt; doing the controlling over her. She suddenly snapped back into \n&gt; reality as she felt sharp pain in her arm as he worked.\n&gt; \n&gt; She smiled, &quot;You always this charming, or just charming a snake?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
