She \nlooks over her shoulder and doesn&#39;t see anything, so doesn&#39;t worry. She \nwalks near Iron Raptor in time to hear her and Lionos speeches. She \nimmedietly dislikes Liono, what fool would be that cruel and inconsiderate \nto their commander? Him obviously. Her eyes narrowed when he turned his back \non her and began to walk away. What an Ass hole! She ran and caught up with \nhim, dashing in front of him, cutting him off.*\n\n&quot; You are the most disrespectable, ego-centric, self centered ass-fucker \ni&#39;ve EVER seen, and i&#39;ve seen alot! You have no right to talk that way to \nIron Raptor. Not only is she your leader, but she has more brains than you \nhave and a heart of gold, which is more than you will ever have. If you \ndon&#39;t like her methods, then go join the preds!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;RYO D&quot; &lt;striderzero1@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Iron I  Don&#39;t  need a Reply\n&gt;Date: Thu, 18 Jan 2001 18:39:45 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;::Liono Prime::\n&gt;Liono dislikes her attitude his eyes narrow &quot;Iron use your brain of more\n&gt;than a stopper for the air whizzing between your ears.&quot; Liono reflects if\n&gt;she thinks everything someone says is questioning her command he show what \n&gt;a\n&gt;question command is. &quot;Iron you know what your problem is when your not\n&gt;P.M.S. ing is your to damn scared to give a order.
