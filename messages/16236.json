And he met them with \nhis own, but with rage instead of anger.\nHe took an aggressive step towards her and bared his teeth as he spoke his \nvoice a roar. *\n\n� I SHOULD be speaking!!  My armor was taken in an act which has saved a \nlive, YOURS was taken in an act of STUPITITY  from not accepting good advice \nwhen it was given!!\nAnd at least I am not a COMPLETE FOOL and so much an INCOMPOTANT warrior \nthat I was STUPID enough to be caught by the Alliance and their childish \ntricks!\nSo it is YOU whom have no right to speak, WENCH!!�\n\n* Dinobot was in a complete rage, every one of his systems stressing and his \nspark pounding in his head.\nThis woman had completely PISSED HIM OFF and he wasn�t about to take it with \na dumb look, knowing that it was she whom was in the wrong on this matter.\nHowever, in the state of aggression in which he dwelled in, he was in no \nmood to think rationally and carefully about what he was saying.\nAnd frankly, he didn�t care!\nHowever, he had caught himself in the last sentence of his words, for, he \nalmost called Tavatron a whore instead of a wench, something that he would \nhave dearly regretted.\nAnd when Tavatron turned her head from him and towards Necromancer his rage \nonly built, wanting to grab her head and make her look at him. To know about \njust how angry he was with her.\nAnd it seemed, every single word out of her mouth annoyed, angered, and \ncompletely raged him�even when they WEREN�T directed at him.\nHis tail thrashed and tore up earth as it slammed against the ground, just \nas Tavatron looked back towards him.\nShe was walking?!!\nHow DARE she just walk away from an argument like this, when it hadn�t even \nbegan yet.\nDinobot growled loudly and took a few steps towards Tavatron as she walked \naway, reaching out a clawed hand to snag her shoulder and whip her around to \nface him, to face his words like a real warrior.\nBut just before he could get a hold on the fembots shoulder he was suddenly \nhauled upright.\nHe gave a loud snarl of surprise before he was simply tossed onto \nNecromancer�s back.\nDinobot growled in annoyance and glared over the dragons� shoulder to stare \nat his head.*\n\n� What in the pit do you think you are doing?!�\n\n* He then simply slid down off of Necromancer�s back and onto the ground, \nanother wave of pain flashing through his body as his third fluid pump \ndeactivated.\nJust GREAT! PERFECT!\nNow he could slip into stasis lock any moment, and without him even knowing \nit!\nHe growled and looked in Tavatron�s general direction, seeing her get \nblasted aside by a bot by the name of Catgut.\nPerfect, now she was in trouble and he couldn�t even do anything, just stand \nthere and watch with his circuits failing.\nBut then something else caught his attention, another bot�but this one was \ncloser�and by what he was hearing, friendly.\nDinobot leaned against Necromancer�s side as his systems wavered and a wave \nof nausea swept over him, making him lean more heavily.\nThis bot, in which he didn�t know (Foxfinger) was offering him his help, \nsomething that could be greatly used at the moment�but not by him.\nHe growled, it sounding a little wet thanks to more mech-fluid which coated \nhis throat.*\n\n� Tavatron needs�back up. Assist her.*\n\n* And that was all he could manage to say before he was forced to swallow a \nmouthful of fluid as it gushed up from his throat.\nDinobot hung his head and bent, placing his hands on his knees to prevent \nhim from doubling over.\nHe could feel the stasis lock closing in, and if one more�just ONE MORE \nfluid pump shut down he would die from lack of mech-fluid to the brain.\nA slow and agonizing death.\nBut, Tavatron�s safely came first, and he wasn�t leaving willingly without \nher!*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
