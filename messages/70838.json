I could do with a little spy work \nmyself, if I don&#39;t use my skills I&#39;ll lose my touch.  All right, I&#39;m in on \nit.&quot;\n\nTucson grins.\n\n&quot;I agree.  Infiltration is the best method.  And to do it indirectly is even \nbetter.  Cheetor, Rat Trap, Nightshift, three of our best infiltrators, who \ncan virtually go in undetected.  Cheetor, Night Shift, you can probably \ncover the parameters in a shorter time span, so you will be given the task \nof infiltrating the fortress from a wider vantage point.  Rat Trap, you will \ntake a more direct course through any small space you can find at the \nfortress.  But keep in mind, first, you want to access the complex, get a \nfeel for your surroundings, and remain silent, so is not to be suspected too \nearly in the game.&quot;\n\nRat Trap salutes.\n\n&quot;Gotycha Wheels.  Not one peep outa me or one action till you say so.&quot;\n\nNight Shift looks to Cheetor.\n\n&quot;Meanwhile, we might be able ta draw up a map for Lord Elder&#39;n Tucson.  We \nget the lay of the land down, and we got a good chance at this mission.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to them.\n\n&quot; You guys are still gonna need backup. And since Tucson&#39;s needed here, \nbecause he&#39;s strong enough ta guard the Ark, we should definitely have some \nsolid protection out there for you.&quot;\n\nShe turns her gaze over to Rodimus as if to drop a very subtle hint.\n\n&quot; And who better ta provide that than you.  I know you can do it Rodimus \nPrime, It&#39;s like Tucson said, with faith in each other, we can do anything.&quot;\n\nTucson smiles.\n\n&quot; She&#39;s right, Rodimus, if anyone can be a stronghold for this mission, it&#39;s \nyou.  She has faith in you, and so do I.  This may prove to be a challenging \nmission but I know you are more than capable of doing it.  So, as a fellow \nPrime, will you do me the honor of accepting her request?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Well, you heard it straight from Lord Elder, Straight Shot. But that \n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t form a formidable force against Hydras.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nodds with understanding.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It was worth a shot. Oh well, you&#39;re right. We got enough power here to \n&gt; &gt; take down Hydras if we put our sparks to it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap grins.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Oooooh A big brain storm is hitting my tiny processor... When in \n&gt; &gt; doubt, send the little guys in ta do the dirty work. I could go with \n&gt; &gt; Cheetor, and like I did before, sneak into the small spaces and have \n&gt; &gt; myself a little fun... Ya know, cross a few wires.... Technical \n&gt; &gt; difficulties...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift steps forward.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Or try ta connect with their central computer system from here&#39;n ya \n&gt; &gt; know, infiltrate without physcially infiltrating....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap bounces with excitement.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ooooh, I like that. No one gets hurt, and we might just possibly lower \n&gt; &gt; the enemy&#39;s resistance...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson narrows a brow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That might just work.. After all, sometimes we have to think off the \n&gt; &gt; pavement don&#39;t we?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheetor was looking decidedly excited as talk was centered around\n&gt; infiltrating the Predacon base, his optics blazed slightly as he\n&gt; nodded. His smile dimmed a bit though when the talk turned to\n&gt; technological infiltration methods as his brow furrowed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Elder on the other hand just nodded as the others talked. It\n&gt; looked as if he were about to say something when his attention\n&gt; suddenly distracted by a chirp on the communications board, he walked\n&gt; over to it and began to type in a series of commands and listen to\n&gt; something.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheetor looked at Elder for a moment as he worked and then back at\n&gt; Tuscon and Rat Trap, crossing his arms over his chest. &quot;Don&#39;t you have\n&gt; to have some sort of physical link to thier system?&quot; Cheetor said,\n&gt; although it is obvious that his knowledge of electronics and hacking\n&gt; was somewhat limited. &quot;Maybe we still need to infiltrate.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
