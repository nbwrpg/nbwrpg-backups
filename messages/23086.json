Ice and Razor Claw remained in beast \nmode both\n&gt; hoping no trouble arose.\n&gt; \n&gt; The door slid open recognizing his Maximal signature. Ice opened \nher mind to\n&gt; Lunarpine &quot;Be careful my love, I don&#39;t want anything to happen to \nyour\n&gt; beautiful pelt.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll take that as an order&quot; Replied Lunarpine mentally back to Ice.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ice looked around, &quot;Any idea where the conference rooms are?&quot; she \nasked out\n&gt; loud, hoping open communication wouldn&#39;t arouse any suspicion.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sorry Ice, I&#39;ve only been here once.&quot; Lunarpine sniffed the \nair, &quot;I&#39;m\n&gt; getting a bunch of scents this way, if we follow them it should \nlead us to\n&gt; the meeting.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Then let&#39;s go, we haven&#39;t flown all this way to stand here \ntalking.&quot; Ice\n&gt; could sound more confident now that she was on friendly ground. She\n&gt; remembered this place from when it had first crashed, the only time \nshe&#39;d\n&gt; ever visited. She smelled the air, she too could sense the crowd of \nbots.\n&gt; \n&gt; Razor Claw stood almost bolt upright as his eyes swept the ship, he \ndidn&#39;t\n&gt; like being here. even though he was no longer Predacon he still \nfealt as if\n&gt; he were in enemy territory. &quot;Settle down, you&#39;re with friends.&quot; Ice \ntold him\n&gt; mentally hoping to settle his nerves. she&#39;d known since they \nentered Maximal\n&gt; airspace that he was nervous about the mission. He acted ready to \nsnap, she\n&gt; hoped that he&#39;d be able to hold his temper until they were far away.\n\n\n"}}
