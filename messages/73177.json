Sinnertwin, it&#39;s an ape!  Small fleshy things\n&gt; are really great!  They want to make ti so you can&#39;t escape!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Continuing on with his heckling, &quot;Cutthroat, grow a moat!  Everyone things\n&gt; you&#39;re a brutal trote!  They all thing that you&#39;re a wuss, and that you&#39;re\n&gt; just an idiotic cuss!  Rippersnapper, look at yoU!  I bet you semll all the\n&gt; organics so much too!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE had fought the TERRORCONS in the GREAT WAR dozens of times.  That\n&gt; meant he knew all their psychometrical quirks, the flukes in their\n&gt; personalities that were their weaknesses.  His hope was to set off their\n&gt; each inferiorities to set them against one another or disrupt their\n&gt; coherency!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs WHEELIE spoke, there was a collective roar from the TERRORCONS as\ntheir humor turned to anger and then even rage!\n\n&quot;I do not smell like snot!&quot; BLOT yelled out.\n\nRIPPERSNAPPER turned over to him, &quot;Actually you do!&quot; He smiled wickedly.\n\nThen there was another roar as GRIMLOCK stepped foward followed by his\nDINOBOTS. &quot;Me Grimlock say Wheelie needs our help! Dinobots attack\nTerrorcons!&quot;\n\n&quot;NO!!&quot; Yelled BACKSTOP who&#39;s voice somehow managed to rise above the\nnoise. The volume caused the others to pause for a moment.\n\nBACKSTOP looked from the DINOBOTS to the TERRORCONS. &quot;No.&quot; He said\nmore quietly this time. &quot;We have a bigger target then ourselves.&quot;\n\n&quot;And just what&#39;s is that?&quot; HUN-GRR said in derisive tones.\n\nPulling out a small device BACKSTOP looked again to the TERRORCONS and\nDINOBOTS, &quot;Our true foe is Magmatron!&quot;\n\nPressing a button on the device a portal opened, and through it the\nsounds of a battle could be heard.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
