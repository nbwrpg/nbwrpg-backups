Just \nremembered, if all things go according to plan I&#39;ll be gone most of the day \nfrom this upcoming Tuesday to Friday, maybe more.  Then the week after that \nfrom Monday-Friday I&#39;ll be pretty much gone on vacation, though I&#39;ll still \nstart the IGL.)\n\nScatterblaster/Vehement/Otyebis Staff/Teufel/Sun Crusher/Reflector:\n\n\n\n\nScatterblaster landed, unharmed from the recent engagement with Vehement and \nthe obvious traitor Zardus.  Checking his rifle, he walked up to a hatch \nguarded by a few IGL soldiers.  They led him into the Otyebis, and towards \nanother hatch with his name above.  He sighed.\n\n&quot;It says Scattershot.  My name is Scatterblaster.&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up.&quot; one of the guards said, kicking Scatterblaster in thorugh the \nhatchway, shutting and locking it behind him.\n\n---\n\nVehement landed on an opposite side of the ship as Scatterblaster, several \nguards escorting him to his arena without a word.\n\n---\n\nSeveral Otyebis soldiers carried a package to the arena Ultimo Campion was \nin, opening the hatch long enough to throw it in at Ultimo unrespectfully, \nshutting and locking it afterward.\n\n===\n\nSun Crusher and Reflector soared into the general area of Teufel, flying in \ntheir biped modes.  They landed a few feet from the Zardus double, both \nseemingly unarmed but each was ready to exterminate if needed.\n\n&quot;Welcome, Sun Crusher and Reflector.  The Chaos-Bringer wishes us to locate \nsome kind of Cybertronian pieces in this area.  Vehement was here, but he had \nto participate in the IGL.  Begin scanning from the air, I will scan from the \nground.&quot;\n\nSun Crusher and Reflector looked to each other, engines powering them up and \nlaunching in the air as they acted out the will of Unicron.\n\n"}}
