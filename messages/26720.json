He was, indeed, far from weak but he didn&#39;t see running blindly into trouble as a good policy on keeping one&#39;s life. He put his rifle away and looked down at Shesta, who had stayed near him the whole time.\r\nThey were simply wasting time here and Vlad was eager to locate Von so that they could end this and their mother&#39;s land would be his.\r\nAt that thought Vlad smiles to himself and ran a hand over Shesta&#39;s silky head, knowing that he always got what he wanted. However, he didn&#39;t want to risk injury to himself and would need a hitman who could get rid of Von for him, if he was still alive. Mother had always said that Von wasn&#39;t anything to be scared about, that his spark was bigger then his brain. Which, for Vlad, would make his fall all the easier.\r\nSo Vlad turned towards the IronFist, Shesta on his heels, and began to move towards it. A pair of bots catching his interest, a fembot and some wolf. Walking towards them as they seemed to enter the base, Vlad flashed one of his famous smiles.** &quot; My Dear Lady, may I ask you a simple question which&#39;ll only take a cycle of your time?&quot; ** Vlad approached Fenox, Shesta still at his heels. He wanted to know if she could recommend somebot he could use as his hitman, which was why he was here in the first place.\r\nVlad had always known how to impress the ladies, and his young and handsome looks only helped him the more. not to mention, he was always taller then most of them, and in this case it was no exception. But all he wanted was to know, not to court.**\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
