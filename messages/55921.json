He \nlooked at the managerie of bots before him. He was beginning to like \nsome bots in the group. Tyrael was a prominant leader and a good one. \nKaiser may have been an older bot, but has lost nothing of his \nwarrior prowess over time. He for some reason found the new bot femme \nannoying. One should respect a warrior, even if they don&#39;t like \nthem.  But then again, some bots just had a lack of programming. He \ndecided to just avoid the femme altogether. He had a hunch that she \nwould be bad for business.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I&#39;m the future english teacher and I&#39;m the one translating \nfrench\n&gt; expressions in english! lol!\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Nevermind my choice of word, we&#39;ll beat those metal butts\n&gt; while they&#39;re down anyways. As for your presence at this strategy\n&gt; meeting, you&#39;re here to help me prepare the assault. However, I&#39;ll\n&gt; have a special assignment... A newcomer, is it? Where is he now?\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to Synergy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Excuse him. He&#39;s grumpy but he&#39;s a top notch fighter and a\n&gt; valuable officer too.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Kaiser/*******::\n&gt; &gt;        He slowly turns around in his seat at the tactical station\n&gt; and looks \n&gt; &gt; at Major Tyrael very carefully.  &quot;Major, I have two questions:\n&gt; First, who \n&gt; &gt; exactly says &#39;Beat them while they&#39;re hot&#39;?  I&#39;ve heard \nof &#39;striking\n&gt; while \n&gt; &gt; the iron is hot&#39; or &#39;beat them while they&#39;re down&#39; but never &#39;beat\n&gt; them while \n&gt; &gt; they&#39;re hot&#39;.  Because frankly that just doesn&#39;t make any sense.&quot; \n&gt; He takes a \n&gt; &gt; deep breath before beginning again.  &quot;Secondly, why exactly are \nyou\n&gt; planning \n&gt; &gt; the strategy.  HELLO, military strategist.  That is what they\n&gt; brought me out \n&gt; &gt; of retirement for.  If you&#39;d like me to be doing something else \nthen\n&gt; by all \n&gt; &gt; means reassign me, but right now I&#39;ve got nothing to do except sit\n&gt; here and \n&gt; &gt; stare at the tactical console.  Oh yeah, that reminds me we have\n&gt; company \n&gt; &gt; incoming at a high rate of speed.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        The unknown bot finally stopped circling the mountain and\n&gt; flew in a \n&gt; &gt; straight line toward the nearest base, in this case the \nTripred&#39;s. \n&gt; He stops \n&gt; &gt; just outside the defensive perimeter and lands.\n\n\n"}}
