The score is \n106 \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Ballers an=\r\nd 102 for the Gorrilaz.  The story so far has been \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; play by Go=\r\nrzo.  Gorzo, A rookie from Crystal University is 30 \nfor \n&gt; 34 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shots=\r\n made.  10 3-pointers and 15 dunks for a total of 50 \n&gt; points.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But=\r\n can the last rank Gorrilaz with the help of Gorzo beat the \n&gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n rank Ballers?  Lets go down to the court to see what happens.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Court Side Announcer:  Hello, we have 20 secounds left in the \n&gt; game. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Gorrilaz are passing in the ball as we speak.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nA bot wearing a jersey that says &quot;Bentals&quot; passes the ball in to \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; bot wearing a jersey thats says &quot;Gorzo&quot;.  Gorzo Dribbles the \nball \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n down the court and passes it to a bot with a jersey that \n&gt; says &quot;Bob&quot;. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bob then passes it to Bentals and Bentals passes it a bot with \n=\r\n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; jersey that says &quot;Micko&quot;.  Micko passes the ball to Bentals an=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bentals passes it to Gorzo.  Gorzo steps up to the 3-point line \n&gt;=\r\n and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; jumps up making it look like a jump shot.  At the last second h=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; passes it to a jumping bot, which is by the goal, whose jersey \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; reads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned then slams the ball for an Alley-op(SP?).  \n&gt; Bots \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a different jersey grab the ball.  The bots jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reads =\r\n&quot;Feller&quot;.  Feller passes the ball in to a bot with a \njersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which r=\r\nead &quot;Rauq&quot;.  (Time to make Rauq look Stupid.)  Rauq \nstarts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dribbili=\r\nng the ball down court when he trips over his own feet. \n \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bal=\r\nl leaves his hands and rolls into Gorzo hands.  Gorzo, who is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; standi=\r\nng behind the 3-point line and takes a jump shot.  The \nball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sails i=\r\nnto the hoop as the Buzzers sounds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Court Side Announcer:  HOL=\r\nY RUST POCKET, THE GORRILAZ WIN 107-\n&gt; 106.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; THE GORRILAZ WIN!!!\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;5 Years Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Bot that was wearing the Gor=\r\nzo jersey 5 years earlier was in \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; small 2 person shuttle.  He is=\r\n Flying around Earth.  All of a \n&gt; sudden \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the right wing catches on =\r\nfire and falls down towards Earth as \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shuttle falls down with =\r\nthe wing.  The shuttle lands near Mid-\n&gt; Africa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about 10 miles from =\r\nwhere Dewboys Characters are.\n\n\n"}}
