We&#39;ve gone back in \ntime.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mustex desperately trys to get the life support systems back up.  He \n&gt; knows this things only chance is either to have his or Stallex&#39;s DNA \n&gt; scanners implanted (remember all bots have them built in since \n&quot;Beast \n&gt; Machines&quot;) or to live long enough to get back.  The only major peice \n&gt; of machinery around is the Shuttle.  Then he remembers the \n&gt; hover-cycles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mustex:  STALLEX!

It was an old capsule, about from the \n&gt; &gt; Great \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; War. It entered the atmosphere, fire surrounding it. It went \n&gt; down \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about in central africa. The robot inside was still alive, but \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy would be out in just a few cycle.
