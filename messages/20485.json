She stepped back from the bear \nand kept walking on. She stopped and looked back at the bear. She \nmsiled, &quot;Yeah,your a noble animal. And thank you for your \ngenerosity.&quot;  SHe smiled at the bear then continued on.\nLeaving the bear behind. \n\nShe felt her shoulder throbbing and hurting even more. She was \nstarting to have trouble walking.  She kept going and went over the \nhill.  She stumbled and rolled down the hill. She landed on her chin \nand cut her lip on one of her teeth. She stood up and cursed under \nher breath. Her shoulder was still dripping red liquid and now her \nlip had a small cut.  She tasted the fluid and grimiced. &quot;Ick, Oh \nthat stuff tasted horrible.&quot; \n\nShe walked a little further until she shoulder hurt so badly she \ndidn&#39;t want to take another step. She layed down in the snow and \nbreathed heavily.  The pain was getting worse, and she was starting \nto get hungry, very hungry.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\nThe bear drew closer and smelled the stranger. It didn&#39;t know why or \n&gt; how it had the same scent but it knew the twin wasn&#39;t appearing \n&gt; threatening. It&#39;s twin was a bit larger than her but it wasn&#39;t \n&gt; fealing threatened. It nuzzled against Ice smelling the bandages on \n&gt; her back. It stepped back slightly, then moved back again. The \nfemale \n&gt; bear sensed an oddity about it&#39;s twin, something that didn&#39;t \nbelong. \n&gt; It was getting fearful and a bit nervous.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
