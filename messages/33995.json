He realised what was\ngoing on, &quot;Symphony, pmhahh, you stay here and give me cover fire on\nthat robot&quot; he said, pointing towards Incarcinerator. He jumped up past\nthe hill, and transformed, hitting the ground with a tire wrenching\n250mph squeal, and roared towards his comerades.\n\n\nOOC: So Dcoburn, Slaughter can&#39;t be detected by defense systems?\n\nBIC:\nAs soon as Quatro launched his attack, eight hiddent laser turrets\nextended out of the ground. They each then displayed four laser cannons,\nand began to all spin. Each time one made a revolution, it would fire\ntowards Quatro. (Your in over your head)\n\nQuatro&#39;s fire power passed the turrets, and nailed the base, charring\nthe side. Luckily they hit the heavily armored side of the base.\n\n"}}
