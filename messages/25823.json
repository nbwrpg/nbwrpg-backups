He groans into the dirt \nhe has piled up with his face and passes out.*\n\n*The alien bots run past Snow Tech&#39;s corpse of trees that he is passed out \nin. They search for him through the bush, but do not find him.Since anger \nand frustration is not built into their emotion chips, they continue to look \nundonted, but they start to look farther and farther away, till they are too \nfar away to be seen.....*\n\n* The black Piff ball was still falling towards Dinobot. He did not make a \nsound because he left it behind long ago, so Dinobot would be unable to hear \nhim.............*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
