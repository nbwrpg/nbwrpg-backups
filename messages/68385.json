Lets see how things\n&gt;  turn out.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Megatron X:\n&gt;\n&gt;  After much study and paitent waiting, three aircraft; two about the\n&gt;  size of an average maximal and the third signifigantly smaller-\n&gt;  infiltrated the city from three different directions. The largest\n&gt;  rumbled down a thouroghfair, almost a block in shape. At it&#39;s bow\n&gt;  was a large barreled fusion cannon wile the top portion contained two\n&gt;  secondary cannons on either side of a twin missile pod. The second\n&gt;  aircraft; noticably faster, was set apart by its air foils and two\n&gt;  precision beam rifles. The last, was tiny by comparison, flying high\n&gt;  over the building until it dove down to join the other two.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Once the three craft converged, they combinded into an even larger\n&gt;  ship, the small flyer compacting and fitting inside the faster flyer,\n&gt;  which connected to the bow section of the larger gunship. The ship\n&gt;  hovered over an intersection for several minutes as a crowd gather\n&gt;  around it. And then it suddenly fell.\n&gt;\n&gt;  But before it crashed to the roadway, it transformed. The cannons\n&gt;  fell away and reconfigured as the body reformed. The large engines\n&gt;  formed strong legs. The wings and forward fuselage formed the upper\n&gt;  body and arms, with the wings forming two broad shields at the\n&gt;  shoulders. The fusion cannon attached to the bottom of the right\n&gt;  forearm, while the twin barreled rifle found home in the left hand.\n&gt;  With missiles to protect his back, Megatron X Stood before the crowd\n&gt;  and sneered.\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot;People of the world, Megatron has returned!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n"}}
