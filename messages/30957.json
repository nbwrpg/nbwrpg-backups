She walked into the conference room and nodded to DarkFate. \nShe motioned for him to talk to her when he was finished.  She stood \njust outside the doorway, hoping to see if she could make her plans \nwork or not.  She hoped that if the predacons had gathered enough \nstrength in her absence, then perhaps they could launch an all out \nassault on the maximals and crush them once and for all.  Then, she&#39;d \ntake out the Allience.  She still remembered how She was betrayed so \nlong ago.  But just as these thoughts went through her mind, the \nloyalty program jolted her and she fell to her knees.  She got up and \nsighed. &quot;Zardus is my master and it is him who I obey.&quot; she said \nwhispering to herself.  Her optics flashed, but returned to norma.  \nNow her only thought was on crushing the maximals. \n\n\n::KitKat2::\nShe made it to the weapons bay and the shuttle hanger. She couldn&#39;t \nbelieve how  no one stopped her during her explorations. \nShe took a wrong turn and found herself in the holding cell area. She \nswallowed hard and walked carefully down the hallway.  She saw cells \non either side of her as she walked.  \n\n\n"}}
