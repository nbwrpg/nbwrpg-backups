He had also=\r\n listened to Lord Elder and thought it was best to allow him to do what he =\r\nneeded to do.  With Tallon and Perceptor in his cab, he was more than conte=\r\nnt and rolls at a good reasonable speed with the two of them in his cab.\n\n&quot;=\r\n Thank you Perceptor, I&#39;m honored to have you with us.  Now, this is what I=\r\n call valuable, having friends among you through the best and worst of time=\r\ns, knowing that your comrades are willing to make a great effort to preserv=\r\ne what is most precious, is something even the most priceless of articles c=\r\nan never hold an ounce of wealth to.  Tallon, after hearing how you became =\r\none of us, it honors me to see how much you have evolved and for that my co=\r\nmpassion for you will never die.&quot;\n\nHe thinks for a moment, about Hydras, an=\r\nd gathers his words carefully.\n\n&quot;I doubt very much that Hydras has any capa=\r\ncity to feel the compassion that all of us are capable of feeling.  I know =\r\nthat will be a downfall for him, because without compassion there can be no=\r\n loyalty, no honor, and most certainly no assurance of victory.  And withou=\r\nt those elements, I doubt very much he will be able to hold his place on th=\r\ne upper hand for much longer.  We have to gather our forces, come together =\r\nas one, and only then will we be able to take back what is rightfully ours =\r\nand preserve what is remaining of our planet.&quot;\n\nWith his words he comes to =\r\na slow stop.  His sonar systems could only carry him to a certain range, bu=\r\nt then realizes that he&#39;s out of range for proper echolocation system funct=\r\nion.\n\n&quot;Tallon, I&#39;m out of range for my sonar system.  Could you take my whe=\r\nel for me?  I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone or any of you.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson opens =\r\nthe passenger&#39;s side door for Perceptor, hearing that he was\n&gt; &gt; on that si=\r\nde. He was happy to have passengers, because to him, having his\n&gt; &gt; comrade=\r\ns around was a great comfort.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Tuscon opened his door to let Talon, =\r\nPerceptor and Lord Elder in,\n&gt; Elder just waved Tuscon on, &quot;No, I will need=\r\n to talk Cheetor alone.\n&gt; Just because he has yet to come to know Perceptor=\r\n here, does not give\n&gt; him leave to talk to you as he wishes is. I will pul=\r\nl him aside to\n&gt; talk to him. I&#39;ll get back to you.&quot; Elder chuckled, &quot;Cheet=\r\nor should be\n&gt; okay, Ramulus is the one that may need more time than most. =\r\nHe has not\n&gt; been one to trust anyone.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder turned aside to catch up=\r\n with Cheetor who was walking off to one\n&gt; side, although sullen, still had=\r\n a good pace. Elder was forced to jog\n&gt; for a moment and lay a comforting h=\r\nand on the young Maximal&#39;s shoulder\n&gt; and pull him to a stop. The two began=\r\n walking together at a somewhat\n&gt; slower pace talking in low tones.\n&gt; \n&gt; (T=\r\nAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
