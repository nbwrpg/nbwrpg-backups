And, if it was by getting to Plintissa&#39;s &quot;CR Chamber&quot;, \nI&#39;d have to say...please stop moding already.  Gosh, you make me wanna kick \nthe crap out of someone.  A CR takes energy.  A base takes energy.  How does \nPlintissa even know how to build one?  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a complicated process.   \nWhere the Hell did she get the Cybertronian components from on Past Earth, \nwhere the wheel hasn&#39;t even been invented.  How did she get all the scrap \nmetal?  Where is she getting the energy to power the CR Chamber?  Think \nbefore you post, god.  And another thing, you never posted for the charge \nRamhorn tossed into the bridge set to explode in five seconds.  Did Suukie, \nwith all his wounds, mystically get out of the bridge via teleportation?  I&#39;m \nreally ticked, and now you&#39;re bringing in the rock?  I have to agree with \nTalon, that is a dumb idea.  That ruins the entire thing.  I&#39;m willing to \ntake this up with Yanshosh/Zardus (and the Council), but you are driving my \npatience, and I&#39;m you&#39;re doing the same to a lot of other people, with your \nwhole &quot;destroy the Ark&#39;s defenses, steal the Autobot/Decepticon bodies, go \ninto an underground base which you made lickety split in a few seconds&quot;.  \nThat is moding.  You even admitted to moding, on purpose, so no one could \nruin it.  That&#39;s part of the RPG, TheCode, everyone participates.\n\n\n\nStinkbomb/Ramhorn:\n\n"}}
