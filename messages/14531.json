Thanx.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor almost fell over in relief that this new bot wasn&#39;t here to\n&gt; announce some attack on the Ark or some other heavy mission/problem she\n&gt; would have to deal with.\n&gt; A smile crossed her lips as she stepped away from the scematic of the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire(and Prowl) and towards the new Maximal, actually glad to\n&gt; meet Quake and how their force just grew a notch.\n&gt; There were so many new bots coming to this world all the time, every new\n&gt; Maximal was more welcome then anything else.\n&gt; Iron Raptor, however, wasn&#39;t quite as swamped with work as before and\ncould\n&gt; actually afford this smile, the only other worry on her mind being that of\n&gt; the Ark.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hot Rod, huh? Well, he told you to come to the right fembot.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She held out her hand towards Quake, the smile on her face not wavering\na\n&gt; bit.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Pleased to meet you, Quake. As you already know, my name&#39;s Iron\n&gt; Raptor...current Maximal Commander. And I would like to OFFICIALLY welcome\n&gt; you to the Maximals as well as the Beast Wars.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * But, just like Feline, she also wouldn&#39;t mind knowing just what sort of\n&gt; qualifacations this man had and how he could be of value to the Maximal\n&gt; force (skills).\n&gt; Iron Raptor qhickly looked him over, from top to bottom. Noting everything\n&gt; about him that she could, and all that he hadn&#39;t told.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If you wouldn&#39;t mind, Quake? Could you please tell me a bit about\n&gt; yourself, skills and so on?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * However, time was preciouse and she would have to make this a bit of a\n&gt; short introduction, knowing that she had much important things to deal\nwith.\n&gt; The Ark, for one.\n&gt; Though, already she was thinking of the just where she could send Quake to\n&gt; keep him busy, a job that didn&#39;t require too much if everything went\nright.\n&gt; Protecting the Ark. He would go out with the repair and protection team\nshe\n&gt; sent before she left for the Embassy.\n&gt; Though, Kluster&#39;s news of the Ark cave in was none too assuring.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You see, I like to know as much about ever individual Maximal as I can\nand\n&gt; I also like to hear them speak themselves instead of having to look over a\n&gt; file every time. It makes them more familier with a few things and helps\nto\n&gt; break the ice.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
