Good then. I guess this is the whole of \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;   crew. I&#39;d tell you more about this mission, but not in here. Too \n&gt; many\n&gt; &gt;   ears and I don&#39;t trust about all of them. Suffice it to say, your\n&gt; &gt;   paycheck is sitting calmly on the mobile station and you are \n&gt; eligible\n&gt; &gt;   to 3.75% of the profits we make on this operation. The number \n&gt; might\n&gt; &gt;   seem low, but wait for the real thing!

In\n&gt; &gt;   fact, one of the pleasure bots was saying the same thing to a \n&gt; drunken\n&gt; &gt;   miner who was nearly passed out on the floor. Lucky for her, the \n&gt; guy\n&gt; &gt;   had already paid her, twice rather than once, drunk as he was.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
