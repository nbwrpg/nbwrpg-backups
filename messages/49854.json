Do not dissapoint \n&gt; me \n&gt; &gt; you have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; so much potential. Now go and get in ur pod. We&#39;ll launch you \nfar \n&gt; &gt; out of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thier sensors so they cant tell u didnt fall from space.   \nYou&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; then land \n&gt; &gt; &gt; safely infront of the tripred base and get rescuded.
