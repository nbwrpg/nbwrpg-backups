I \ncome not from the future where you lay, but rather I have been here \nall along. Destroy me now and those you call the Decepticons will \nreduce you to a molten ball of flame in a matter of mere centuries.\nYou will have to refrain from delivering the killing blow, not only \nyours, but that of even those you do not control! Mark my words: I \nfear you not!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Polar Claw &lt;cycodrone@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Primus was not amused as he watched through his\n&gt; connection with Shadowcaster. Taking control, he sent\n&gt; a chillingly stern message through to every spark in\n&gt; the vicinity of of the Earth and its satellites.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I will warn you once abomination- end your temporal\n&gt; sabotage now, or I will eradicate your spark and the\n&gt; sparks of all your minions from existence.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile outside the Arkt, giant robotic forms were\n&gt; materialising out of thin air. The first to\n&gt; materialise was a samurai like figure with a skeletal\n&gt; face, his brown and yellow familiar to all those who\n&gt; knew their Cybertronain history.  His virtually\n&gt; indestructible Neo-titanium sword drawn, his eyes\n&gt; meant business. While the thought of working with\n&gt; inferior warriors such as Autobots sickened him, he\n&gt; knew all too well that Primus&#39; commissioning of him\n&gt; was a matter of honor, in edition to the fact that\n&gt; Unicron&#39;s dishonourable tactics sickened him to the\n&gt; core. Bludgeon was reborn- and he meant business.  He\n&gt; was shortly followed by an all too familiar Silver and\n&gt; Gold T-Rex.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The moment after he materialised, he transformed into\n&gt; robort mode, Energio Sword drawn and double barrelled\n&gt; mortar launcher in hand- Grimlock had returned.  Next\n&gt; to materialise was a form new to all- his warrior\n&gt; visage looked a mixure of american Indian and Viking,\n&gt; his power sword in hand- Magnaboss was born. \n&gt; Following him was a giant, even by Autobot standard,\n&gt; his wings and backpack towering over bludgeon and\n&gt; Grimlock, as his round head and broad shoulders formed\n&gt; before the rest of his solid built robotic body\n&gt; materialised, his double barreled particle beam cannon\n&gt; at the ready- Skyfire was reborn.  Next to him, the\n&gt; technorganic form of a wolf with a a mean look on his\n&gt; face srpouting a mean looking cannon appeared-\n&gt; Carnivac had joined the fray.   Folloing Carnivac, a\n&gt; green and grey moving powerhouse materialised with\n&gt; enough firepower to back up any arguement it put\n&gt; forward. The tanks transformed to reveal the former\n&gt; Autobot Headmaster- Hardhead.  Hardhead was then\n&gt; joined by two more comrades- the first a being of\n&gt; great courage and one worthy of being called a warrior\n&gt; even by Bludgeon&#39;s standards. Even though he had been\n&gt; physically weak in the past, his fluro green, black\n&gt; and gold form now stood as tall as bludgeon, as Primus\n&gt; had seen fit to revive his body at its most powerful-\n&gt; Bumblebee had returned.\n&gt; \n&gt; The final Autobot to appear looked somewhat like a\n&gt; samurai in armour- the tall, tower-like shoulders,\n&gt; even broader form than his traditional body, coupled\n&gt; with his sword of pure energon and double barrelled\n&gt; laser cannon, made this Autobot even more\n&gt; inspirational and intimidating than he had been in the\n&gt; past.  Optimus Prime had returned.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: the materialising takes place over mere seconds\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: Primus addressed all transformers in the Earth\n&gt; sphere once more &quot;Send your minions chaos bringer, but\n&gt; beware, just as you have your minions, I have my\n&gt; champions. Take note of their sparks abomination- when\n&gt; you do, you&#39;ll see your minions do not stand a\n&gt; chance.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Primus waited for a reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: In case some people are wondering, I&#39;ve had\n&gt; Primus bring back these transformers in their most\n&gt; powerful forms that we saw them in  in the toy line-\n&gt; thus Bludgeon has his pretender shell, as does\n&gt; carnivac, Bumblebee is a Gobot, Skyfire is in his\n&gt; original form as is Grimlock, Magnaboss has been used\n&gt; for the autobot/maximal quartet, and Optimus Prime is\n&gt; a Laser Rod. \n&gt;  --- Jerame Johnson &lt;jeramej@y...&gt; wrote: &gt;\n&gt; NewHope 2:\n&gt; &gt; Where the Bigger Vessel Landed in the ocean.

He stood there, watching the energon-bloated\n&gt; &gt; jewel that was \n&gt; &gt; Earth. He zoomed his malevolent attention on the\n&gt; &gt; three Cybertronian \n&gt; &gt; bases and decided that these were the objectives. A\n&gt; &gt; low roar arose \n&gt; &gt; as he began to speak.
