This is all because I let him go the first time he \nattacked.  As \n&gt; for you Sarge, I have just as much reason to kill him.  In our last \nfight I \n&gt; lost an arm and a leg defending others.  I nearly died because \nthere were \n&gt; bots in the battle that shouldn&#39;t have been there.  I couldn&#39;t care \nless \n&gt; about his lackeys.  Now then, let&#39;s get to the meeting so we can \nfinish it \n&gt; and start planning our attack.&quot;  He stands tall glaring at Sarge.\n\n\n"}}
