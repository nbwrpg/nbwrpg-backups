If it could, it would have sighed in annoyance.\n\nIt turns around, sending a thought out into time and space. Another Vok arrives almost instantly.\n\n&quot;The Ikoto aren&#39;t holding up their bet too well. I think they&#39;re being delayed,&quot; it says, the other Vok waiting for it to elaborate. &quot;I also think that we should take this time to prepare better. We are strong on the planet right now, but we can use more strength.&quot;\n\nThe other Vok nods. &quot;Agreed. What did you have in mind?&quot;\n\nA 3d picture of Dinobot materializes between the two Vok, spinning around slowly. &quot;This one. We already have exprience with him, and he shows great potential as a warrior. I suggest we recruit him before he ends up fighting against us.&quot;\n\nThe other&#39;s thoughts obviously show that it approoved and without further delay, it turned around and departed, leaving the first Vok to begin working on recruiting another warrior to the Vok cause.\n\n\n"}}
