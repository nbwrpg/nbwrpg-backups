That way it \ndepends on the RPing skills of the RPers and such. There are some \ncharacters that are more powerful than other characters. Those \ncharacters are called gestalts. =) Leaders are also more powerful,  \nbut powerful or not, they can be taken down. Being overwhelmed 7 to \n1 = a certain fate known as defeat.\n\nHottie, I&#39;d appreicate if you emailed me privately about any \nquestions you have, instead of posting one line OOC messages to the \ngroup. They are just useless clutter to 99% of the RPG and are best \nkept to private email. Did you read the poll regarding the \nmoderation of Dewboy for 5 days regarding OOC posting infractions? I \nhate to threaten, but it&#39;s the only way to get the point across \nsometimes. If you keep posting OOC messages, there will be a poll \nlike that for you. Dewboy and I both have private addresses, if you \nfeel like emailing either of us, which are located in each one of \nour posts, and in the members section. Otherwise, you could get an \ninstant messenger like YahooMessenger, MSN, ICQ, etc and use it to \ntalk to people. This might seem harsh, but you have been told at \nleast once to stop posting OOC messages.\n\nI&#39;m not sure who&#39;s posting for the Chivitron shields, but having \ntaken the damage that they have, I&#39;m not sure how long they will be \nstanding. Wasn&#39;t Gunthers the one who was supposed to be covering it?\n\nOne last thing, IF the Chivitron base has shields, are bots able to \nwalk through them? I can&#39;t remember.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Thanks, Jeff, I should never have doubted your abilities as a \nmoderator. Oh, and Hottie? You can make your characters be a bit \nstronger if you want to, until the Council catch you, but then I can \njust say that my guys are stronger than yours. So that means you \ncan&#39;t do that. Was that confusing? I&#39;m confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: Ransack and Venom each move apart from each other, \nsuccessfully avoiding the 2 foot in diameter fireballs.
