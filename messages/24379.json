Two regular \nmissile launchers emerge from Lavatron&#39;s shoulders, arming themselves \nfor when the enemy would reapear.\n\nLavatron fires as he sees Snow Tech fly out of the clouds, screaming. \nHe fires a missile, but misses the Maximal. Lavatron runs toward Snow \nTech, yelling when he feels the ice hit his left foot, freezing it in \nplace. Lavatron growls, aiming his palms at Snow Tech. Lightning \nbolts fire from both his palms, tearing up the ground where they hit, \nand then heading for Snow Tech. The two missile launchers on his \nshoulders aim upward, firing two missiles into the clouds at Shadow \nCat.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * SHadow Cat blinked in suprise. This isn&#39;t what she had in mind. \nThe most \n&gt; she expected is that he would deflect it. Not fire it back! she \nwatched as \n&gt; the bolt came towrds her, she was not worried. Electric energy did \nher no \n&gt; harm, she was a part of it as much as it was a part of her. But she \ndid not \n&gt; want them to know that. She placed her open hands in front of her \nand \n&gt; &quot;caught&quot; the bolt as it came at her. Again she gathered it up, but \nshe knew \n&gt; it would be usless to fire it back. So, instead, she gathered it up \nand \n&gt; stored it in her porpultion systems. She turned them on and flew \noff with \n&gt; her extra boost of speed. She swooped down and caught SNow Tech \naround the \n&gt; waist and again flew up into the clouds, hoping they would provide \nsome \n&gt; cover from the Pred.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Snow Tech, you need to use your ice beam to freeze his feet, so \nhe can&#39;t \n&gt; move. I&#39;ll see what i can do from there. Oh, and i hope you can fly&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Shadow Cat then let go of his waist, letting him fall to earth. \nSnow Tech \n&gt; screamed, closed his eyes and spread his wings. He didn&#39;t know how \nto fly, \n&gt; but he could glide. He soared downward for a good five seconds \nbefore he \n&gt; relized that he wasn&#39;t falling, but flying. Of sorts. He glided \ninto a small \n&gt; stand of brush, landing akwardly, but he managed to untangle \nhimself before \n&gt; anyone could notice. He krept out of the bush, and creeped up on \nthe large \n&gt; Pred. He called up all the Winter energy he could, and filed it \ninto his \n&gt; blaster. When that was done, he pointed the gun not at it&#39;s head, \nbut it&#39;s \n&gt; feet.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; This aught to stall him for a bit!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And he fired a wide beam, making sure that it would hit it&#39;s feet-\nup.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
