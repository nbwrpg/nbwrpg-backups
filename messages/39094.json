The reason that I asked if the Radicons were \ngoing to attack is because Termitron and Lynxiz might have been \nable to see them coming from a distance. Lynxiz was bird \nwatching and absorbing the beautiful surroundings, while Termitron \nwas scouting around the Chivitron base. I don&#39;t know if Train Wreck \ncould run Termitron over from where he (Termitron) is. =)\n\nOOC: (WingedWarrior) Where did Starstomp&#39;s asteroid land?\n\n0==0 Lynxiz 0==0\n\nLynxiz looks up from her brief sojourn and notices a disturbance in \nthe calm around her. She quickly pulls up her binoculars, and \nlooks downward around her on the mountain peak. She initiailly \ndoesn&#39;t find anything, but the an out of place site catches her \nattention, a train speeding towards the base. She hisses, &quot;I know \nhim from the last fight.&quot; She opens a commlink to the Chivitrons, \n&quot;Chivitrons, your base has incomings, prepare for an attack.&quot; She \npulls out her disk launcher, cursing the fact that it is a slower fire \nweapon. She fires four timed (4 secs upon impact) explosive disks \nahead of the incoming train. Knowing that her disks would likely \nserve only as a distraction, she transforms, &quot;Lynxiz, Beast Mode!&quot; \nand starts down the mountain back to the Chivitron base.\n\n\n\nOn 5 Jul 2001, at 19:37, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Yeah, I think the Radicons and Chosen Mafia would show up by now,\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t they?\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: Train Wreck spotted Termitron and Lynxiz.
