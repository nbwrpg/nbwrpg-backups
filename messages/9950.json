He called her cute? That \nwas one thing she never thought another bot would ever call her. \nCute? She watched him look her over.  \nShe clasped her hands in front of her and looked down.  She couldn&#39;t \nhelp but blush. \n&quot;Well, thank you. I appreciate your offer for help.&quot;\nShe tried to think of something to say but couldn&#39;t come up with \nanything.  She glanced over at the empty fruit bowl.\n&quot;Uhm, would you let me go to the mess hall and get some more friut \nfrom the food dispencer? I seam to be out at the moment.&quot; She was \nstill blushing from his earlier made comment.  She walked over and \npicked up the bowl and held it against her.  She looked at him \nwaiting to see if he would let her go and get it or not.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Firearm::\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm laughs at Battera asking him if he was the leader. &quot;Nope, \nI&#39;m just a \n&gt; fighter.
