She didn&#39;t move as her optics\ntraveled around the room, too damaged and too much energy loss to support\nmovement any longer.\nShe would have growled to herself if she would have had the strength, the\nMaximals just leaving her like this and not even bothering to offer a\nrepair.which she would have accepted gladly.\nHer optics fell upon Rex as he stayed on duty near by, not even realizing\nthat she was whimpering.\nDamaged and captured, it couldn&#39;t get any worse.\nWith a shuddering sigh she turned her optics on Gangon, being in the next\ncell to her, in much better condition she might add.\nThis was all going terribly wrong; nothing had worked out the way it was\nsupposed to.\nHowever, she had to get out and she knew of a bot that could help her.\nWith much effort BrightBlade activated her internal transmission system,\nready to send a message that would appear right on the main screen of the\nreceiver.\nThis is what the message read: *\n\n&quot; Perndabot, I&#39;ve got a whole smack of Maximals for you to slag. Just get to\nthe brig of the ship and you&#39;ll have them. But I&#39;m injured and can&#39;t escape\nmyself, as well as another Predacon in the cell next to me. *sigh* I know it\nsounds impossible but if you hit fast and true you&#39;ll be able to get in, get\nus, slag a few Maxis and get out. There&#39;s a button on the Cloaking device\nthat&#39;ll help you through the shields. There should also be a power charger\nthat&#39;ll pump up the power on one of your blasters if you attach it to it,\nthat&#39;ll help you get in and out before the Maximals even know what hit them.\nNow, let&#39;s get this show on the road, huh?!&quot;\n\n* That was all the power that she had as the message ended, her breath\nbecoming even shallower. Just hoping that Perndabot would puck up on such a\nweak frequency.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at\nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
