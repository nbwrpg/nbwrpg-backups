Except...for what I just \ndid now...dang...) to Zardus is just wrong and shameful.  That is an insult \nreserved for the lowliest of men (good thing Zardus doesn&#39;t read these posts, \neh?).  But I have to agree with uh...Hollywood Narrator, I think that&#39;s what \nhis moniker is-- *stops to watch the pigs fly* Shouldn&#39;t we vote on who the \nnew Councilmember is?  I mean, sure, we&#39;d all agree you should kick Crow Lord \nout because he&#39;s a lazy bumb.  Sure you could replace him with Azure, hell, I \nthought he WAS a Councilmember, but the point is the PRINCIPLE.  The Council \nwas made to service the people.  A restriction of power and all those other \nanti-fascist gobbledygook, which is strange since a Russian from MOSCOW made \nup those rules...seems fishy to me...\n\n&lt;&lt;Kyle does tend to abuse the polls more than others, and that change \n of rules does affect him more than others, but any member of the rpg \n who wants a poll, ANY poll, can still email it too me, and i&#39;ll put \n it up quickly. Trillian (my chat prog) tells me when I have mail, \n thus allowing me to hop on my comp and create a poll at any time.&gt;&gt;\n\nWell, you see, there&#39;s the whole &quot;the whole being punished because of one&quot; \nthing I was babbling on about.  It&#39;d be much faster for US to make the poll \nwe want.  Plus if by some amazing act of whatever primitive god(s) are out \nthere we make a poll that is ingenious we&#39;re going to want credit for it, \ninstead of a big ol&#39; &quot;Made by Rauq&quot; slapped on the poll.  \n\nAnd please, United States Presidents are not tyrannical...well...the \nDemocrats are but the Democrats are widely known as IDIOTS and LOSERS and \npeople who mess with Microsoft and SCREW US with stock over in the long run \nand cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars because of some BS \nantitrust/monopoly case that makes me want to puke and beat the hell out of \nClinton!  Errr...uh...moving on...if Gore was President instead of Bush, I \ndoubt we would&#39;ve gone to Afghanistan because those Democrats are tree \nhugging hippies, they would&#39;ve just lobbed some more cruise missiles.  But \nha, we showed the Talibs!  Oooh...I guess you getting America caught in a \nbloody ground war worked out REEEEEEAAAAL WELL, didn&#39;t it?!  HAHAHAHAHA!\n \nUh...that&#39;s about all I have to say (Democrats suck!).  It&#39;s probably obvious \nthis is not as well written and planned out as my last e-mail which was \nbeautiful, but I wasn&#39;t listening to Iron Maiden and Rammstein when I wrote \nthe first one and coincidentally all the rage came out.  But I doubt the \nmusic has anything to do with it... (KILL!  KILL!  KILL!)\n\n-Teufel\n(Oh, dont&#39; worry about not being able to remember my new name Narrator, I \nmean I&#39;d make fun of you but I don&#39;t even know how to pronounce \nit...so...yeah...)\n\n"}}
