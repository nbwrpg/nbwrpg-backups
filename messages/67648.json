Most of us are either on the moon or somewhere on Earth. It\nhelps to keep our locations separate by using different subject lines.\nI hope it is not too confusing for you. The easiest way for you to jump\nin would be to create your own story line, describe in general terms\nwhere you are and allow one of us to merge with you. \n\nI hope that helps. Feel free to ask as many questions as you like, and\nI am sure we will all be glad to help you to slide in as smoothly as\npossible. \n\nPreston\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  \nFind them fast with Yahoo!
