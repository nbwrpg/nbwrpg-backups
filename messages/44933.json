The story you tell me about implies that only a few \nbots were left, but this contradicts what has happened on cybertron. \nHowever, I guess nothing holds you from using the story on another \nworld, with some minor changes. There is a bot owned by Lord of \nDarkness (wonder where he is now) named Cheetor, and a X-Predacon \nnamed Black Arachnia.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; O.k. and Optimus was quickly arrested after discovering the orocal \nand \n&gt; everyone thought that was that, but a few of his followers survived? \n&gt; He never fought a second war or rescued any sparks, and barely had \n&gt; time to find out about organic core and its superiority to water?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., wingedwarrior41@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Sorry Dewboy. I know you want this plot to work, but It just \n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t. It&#39;s just like saying Mustex knows about Veratis when they \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; not actually met in the RPG. The basic story of a rebelling \nfaction \n&gt; &gt; sending a member to Earth was good, but you can not say \n&gt; &gt; Techno-organics were on cybertron because it is not the Cybertron \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; has been going on. Beast Machines never happened. This means that \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; Maximals safely arrived on Cybertron, took Megatron to a trial or \n&gt; &gt; something, and, in some way, he went back to Earth. That&#39;s it. BM \n&gt; &gt; never happened because if it did, Megatron never could have had \nwent \n&gt; &gt; back to Earth, he would have been a part of Cybertron. It&#39;s hard, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll have to deal with it.\n\n\n"}}
