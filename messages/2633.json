Things like that.  I&#39;ll only be putting down the major \nevents, like the Newcomers (Koga Shuko and Set) landing, or the People&#39;s base \nbeing blown sky high by enemy forces.  Or the Alliance base being atacked and \nrecieving damage.  I will be doing this for a few reasons:\n\n#1.  The events page only averaged 7 hits a day, and about 2 of them were \nmine when I checked on the page.  \n\n#2.  Summer is only a few weeks away.  When more people get more time to RP, \nthe e-mails will most likely double, therefore overrunning Yanshosh and \nmyself.\n\n#3.  Just trying to update the page (when some days have over 100 posts) and \ntrying to keep up with the events in the RPG, or to act out our characters, \nhas become aggrivating and a nearly impossible task for Yanshosh and myself.  \nTherfore, with its newly proposed format, it won&#39;t take up our time to RP.\n\n#4.  Finally, because the RPG has gotten along fine without it for over a \nyear.  \n\n\nI utterly oppose any response on this e-mail.  There is no need for it.  Any \ncomments about the page go to me: KSLawDogg@....  Not reply.  \n\nThank you,\nLord Unitron AKA SJW\n\n"}}
