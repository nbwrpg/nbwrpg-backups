Back in his days \n    with the Radicons, when he had received the=\r\n lobotomy from the leader \n    of the group, Kracken, he still never questi=\r\noned any orders or \n    actions.

His optics lit up brightly wh=\r\nen Heartbreak had kissed Phoenix \n    and thrown her down. He knew the prev=\r\nious events would be \n    commonplace, but he thought this was going too fa=\r\nr.

People called \n    the cops.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; BIC:=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Arrow had watched the \n    events with indifference. He h=\r\nad certain laws &lt;BR&gt;he abided by. His own \n    twisted laws. One of those w=\r\nas not to question &lt;BR&gt;what his fellow bot did. \n    And he hadn&#39;t done so,=\r\n yet. Back in his days &lt;BR&gt;with the Radicons, when he \n    had received the=\r\n lobotomy from the leader &lt;BR&gt;of the group, Kracken, he \n    still never qu=\r\nestioned any orders or &lt;BR&gt;actions. When a comrade made a \n    mistake, he =\r\nwould let it play out, and &lt;BR&gt;when an enemy made a mistake, he \n    would =\r\ntake quick action and harm &lt;BR&gt;them quickly and efficiently. Sneaky \n    ki=\r\nlls were obviously not against &lt;BR&gt;his law, as he recalls right at the \n   =\r\n moment how he had ripped the &lt;BR&gt;spark from the body of the very child he =\r\n\n    had cared for in the &lt;BR&gt;Chivtrons. He considered it a merciful act.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \n    &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Deemos, meanwhile, was quite shocked by the events. He=\r\n thought it \n    &lt;BR&gt;was disgusting and inappropriate. This was hypocrisy, =\r\nas Deemos was \n    &lt;BR&gt;the one who had sliced a team member to bits just fo=\r\nr not doing \n    &lt;BR&gt;better in battle when Deemos led his own group. He bri=\r\nefly recalls \n    &lt;BR&gt;Shokaract co-leading his group and almost becomes gla=\r\nd, for some \n    &lt;BR&gt;unknown reason, but then puts his attention back on th=\r\ne events at \n    &lt;BR&gt;hand. His optics lit up brightly when Heartbreak had k=\r\nissed Phoenix \n    &lt;BR&gt;and thrown her down. He knew the previous events wou=\r\nld be \n    &lt;BR&gt;commonplace, but he thought this was going too far. However,=\r\n this \n    &lt;BR&gt;thought came from the guy who had plotted viciously killing =\r\nhis wife \n    &lt;BR&gt;and son and had succeeded.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spider, meanw=\r\nhile, had the \n    third point of view. He was proud and &lt;BR&gt;smiling. He en=\r\njoyed everything \n    that went on. He was a rookie bot who &lt;BR&gt;was eager f=\r\nor action and any sort \n    of exciting event, no matter what &lt;BR&gt;kind.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, a \n    couple of STASIS PODS (I&#39;m sick of ships) f=\r\nall down on &lt;BR&gt;the planet. What \n    will they become? What sides will the=\r\ny be on? Does &lt;BR&gt;anyone \n    care?...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; ----- O=\r\nriginal Message \n    -----&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; From: Richard Allen&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; To: \n    nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sent: Sunda=\r\ny, February 16, 2003 \n    5:09 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject: Party at nWo=\r\n base!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; : : Wolfenstein/Razor/Die=\r\nsel/Heartbreak : :&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wolfenstein gets out o=\r\nf the CR chamber.

He &lt;BR&gt;stepped forward \n    very slowly, surely s=\r\ncaring the femme bot.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n    Razor: Now my dear,=\r\n you will belong to us. If you... service us &lt;BR&gt;you may \n    live. If you =\r\nrefuse, I&#39;ll kill you where you stand.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ra=\r\nzor reached out with the torch and began to ingrave \n    letters &lt;BR&gt;into t=\r\nhe beautiful body of Phoenix. She would surely be \n    screaming &lt;BR&gt;from t=\r\nhe pain, as the energon flame burnt through her armor, \n    melting &lt;BR&gt;pie=\r\nces of her away. As Razor finished, Phoenix had the nWo logo \n    &lt;BR&gt;burne=\r\nd across her chest. She had been branded.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n All the boys started to laugh at what they had done. \n    All except &lt;BR&gt;W=\r\nolfenstein, who looked away.
