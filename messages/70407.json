He scans as\n&gt; healthy and sleeping, but these cables have snaked their way through\n&gt; many of his vital systems.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bump doesn&#39;t even turn from his observation as he spoke, &quot;Fortunately\n&gt; these cables are inert and are making no effort to stop us. I get the\n&gt; feeling that they were once connected in some way to some sort of\n&gt; being.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon spun back to look at Rodimus, &quot;What?!?&quot; He ran his scanner over\n&gt; Rodimus again, &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; he said as he sighed, &quot;I&#39;m afraid to\n&gt; know what Rodimus went through down there.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy, who was still carrying Rodimus looked over at Kup, &quot;Rodimus\n&gt; has been through an ordeal, but I believe it is within our power to\n&gt; repair him, however it will take some time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon and Bump both nodded their agreement. Santon looked up at\n&gt; Legacy as both he and Bump backed away slightly, &quot;We will need your\n&gt; complete report on whatever it was that did this.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy nodded as he started to walk further in the entrance and\n&gt; towards the medical bay, Santon and Bump both following him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Silverbolt who had come to stand next to Kyp, looked at Rodimus his\n&gt; optics dim and thoughtful, &quot;He was a hero Kup, even if he had fallen\n&gt; into the trap of a black hearted villain.&quot; He turned to look at Kup,\n&gt; &quot;He will pull through, that&#39;s what heroes do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
