I&#39;m not sure if the punishment\nsentance will be a period of time or until they send out an apology\nletter (over private email to everyone) or the duration of the battle\nor what, but for now I guess we&#39;ll continue without them. If anyone\nhas a good idea of how they can earn free-posting privilages again,\nplease email it to me.\n\nPlease send any posts having to do with this argument over private\nemail from now on. Dcoburn and JP, I mean nothing personal by\nmoderating you guys, I&#39;m just trying to keep the peace. I hope we can\nremain friends.\n\n\n"}}
