He then \ntransformed into Prime&#39;s robot mode and fired the big gun at any maximal that \nmoved. Carnatron sent a telepathic message to Hydras, &quot;Sir you might want to \nget here...only you are a match for Rodimus.&quot; Hydras growled. &quot;The rest of you \nstay here Sharpclaw come with me.&quot; He turned into the dragon and flew towards \nflicker.\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; Rodimus heard Condor over the comm, but didn&#39;t have time to reply. He knew that \n&gt; the CR failed. Condor was gone. Rodimus let out an angered growl as he, somehow, \n&gt; picks up even more speed.\n&gt; Eventually Rodimus had caught up with the rest of the Maximal force. They were \n&gt; good troops.\n&gt; Rodimus starts to overtake them. He sees Flicker, but was still trailing.\n&gt; Rodimus yells out with so much anger that you would think he had gone mad. Maybe \n&gt; he had.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: FLICKER!!!!!!!!!!
