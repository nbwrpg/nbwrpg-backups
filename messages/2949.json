One minute you&#39;re fighting \noutside with Pegasus and Striker, the next you mysteriously get through \nsealed doors to Plintissa.  You&#39;re also not really responding to Pegasus \n(Jfrey) as I&#39;ve noticed.  I think you should try clarifying these things, \nbecause what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t really making much sense)\n\n\nRamhorn:\n\n&quot;Slag!&quot; Ramhorn yelled, slamming a foot to the ground.  &quot;Insubordinate fool.&quot;\n~Ramulus, this is Ramhorn.  I need you go to (gives the coordinates and \nsection where Plintissa) and take Plintissa, she&#39;s a kind of squid robot, and \ntake her to the brig and guard her.  If she attacks at all, shoot to kill.  \nWe can&#39;t afford to lose anymore good Maximals.  You&#39;ll have internal base \ndefenses to help you.  THere are two others, you may have to shoot to kill \nanyways.&quot;\n\nWatching Kamodia try to get in, he presses a few buttons, another missile \nlauncher extending from the side of the Ark, firing two seeking missiles at \nWraith.\n~Striker, Pegasus, it&#39;s Ramhorn.  Try and take these people out fast, kill \nthem if you have to.  We&#39;ve got intruders inside the Ark and we need them \nstopped~\n\nSeeing Bluestreak and Ratchet on a video monitor, Ramhorn smiled.  Activating \na comlink to them, he spoke: \n\n~Hey, if you&#39;re Maximals we need your help,~ Ramhorn spoked, unlocking the \ndoor Bluestreak and Ratchet were near, ~We&#39;ve got intruders, and if you join \nus we need your help badly.  If you go after them (he gives them their \npositions, their being Plintissa, Wraith, and Kamodia), you have \nauthorization to shoot to kill~\n\nRamhorn took out his submachine gun, loading it up.  \n\n"}}
