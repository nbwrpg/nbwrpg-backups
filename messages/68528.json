Let&#39;s do a subtle pass.\n&gt; \n&gt; Brody (whispering back): Right! I&#39;m switching to thermal scan.\n&gt; \n&gt; The hot air fuming upwards effectively broke under a cooler cushion\n&gt; that didn&#39;t move. Chop rose in the air, targeting the anomally and\n&gt; armed a magazine of tracking bullets. As he flew over it, he fired\n&gt; the whole magazine.\n\nNightrazor simply watched the duo from his vantage point. As they rose\nand searched he looked at them closely. He could tell that the ship had\nno clue as to his where abouts, but these two were a different matter. \n\nIt is only as they got closer he realized what they were doing. The\nbuffeting heat from the surface would be stalled or redirected by his\npresence. Here in this location he could be discovered by indirect\nmeans. Then his attention was caught by the click of a magazine being\nloaded into position. \n\nWith a burst of power he shot foward and up, putting as much distance\nbetween him and the warmth comming from the surface below, even as the\nfull clip of trackeing bullets were unleashed by Chop. \n\nStrafing shots ripped into his aft armor causing pain to flood his\nsystems and his cloaking field flickered. For the briefest of moments\nNightrazor&#39;s aerodynamic ebony form was revealed as he moved away . . .\nand then was gone as he passed out from beneath them. \n\nFor another moment ionized particles from his engines attracted the\nattention of the bullets from Chop as Nightrazor pushed his engiens\ntemporarilly beyond what his cloaking shields could handle. But the\nbullets were quickly left behind as the ship rose further into the air\nand the cloaking field restablished its presence. \n\nNightrazor considered firing back as he fled, but he knew as soon as he\ncompletely dropped his shields the other ship would no doubt open fire,\nand he was not here for conflict. With a boost of power, now well\nwithin his cloaking field&#39;s ability to mask he rose higher and higher\ninto the air. \n\nHe would either have to watch from a distance or move on, he was really\nin no position to take on two defenders plus a well armed ship.\n\nPreston\n(Nightrazor)\n\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nYou rock.
