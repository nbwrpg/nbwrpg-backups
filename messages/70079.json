If you want to back up and RP, make any changes or additions,\n&gt; please let me know. I have made it look grim, hope you guys are\n&gt; satisfied with it)\n&gt;\n&gt; BIC:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hydras hissed &quot;Separate the bots named Kup and Nightshift, I want them in\n&gt;&gt; the high security cells and also I like that they dont know where is the\n&gt;&gt; other one... Set the Scanners in order to have a check out every 5 \n&gt;&gt; cicles&quot;\n&gt;&gt; and looking to Tucson said &quot;And our special Guest will have The Pit...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras gave orders, Cyclonus entered the different commands into\n&gt; the system. Some doors closed while others opened allowing Hydras\n&gt; access to the &#39;PIT&#39; as he described it. In addition to being small and\n&gt; confined, like a real pit it was positioned below the main cell block\n&gt; section.\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras approached, one could not help but notice the cannons that\n&gt; were oriented along the way along with security cameras. Occasionally\n&gt; a purple strobe light would flash along the hall as if scanning it for\n&gt; intruders.\n&gt;\n&gt; When Hydras approached the &#39;PIT&#39; with Tuscon in tow, the door to it\n&gt; opened, allowing heat and steam to hiss as they escaped the room.\n&gt;\n&gt; The interior of the room itself was approximately the size of a cargo\n&gt; pod - just large enough enough to hold a single transformer, and even\n&gt; then only manacled. The tempature of the room could only be called\n&gt; hot! A human, should he or she have the unfortunate circumstance to\n&gt; arrive here, would quickly be overcome by the heat.\n&gt;\n&gt; The walls of the room were cut from a mixture of stone and galvanized\n&gt; Cybertronian metals, they were solid and thick, seemingly designed for\n&gt; brute strength and durability. The manacles that were positioned along\n&gt; the wall were also thick and cut apparently from the same type of\n&gt; metal as the walls. They were attached directly to the walls and\n&gt; allowed very little if any movement, depending on the mercy of the one\n&gt; administering the punishment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Only a single machine was positioned in this chamber, presumably to\n&gt; provide the energy requirements for transformers. (OOC: Transformers\n&gt; food and drink). This machine also provided the only illumination for\n&gt; the room, and also like the lights in the chambers above, the machine\n&gt; was recessed into the walls and protected by a transparent material\n&gt; unless it was feeding time.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the moment the illumination from the machine was bright, but it\n&gt; would dim as the door closed or if commanded by Hydras or some other\n&gt; duly appointed security officer.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Then he send a private messages to Cyclonus&quot; Cyclonus, go to\n&gt;&gt; the throne Room and take the lady with you... Be glente, she&#39;s one of us, \n&gt;&gt; I\n&gt;&gt; want that you keep an eye in her while Perceptor is busy here... If\n&gt;&gt; something happens her, you will pay for that, understood?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus, who had been observing the progress of each one from the\n&gt; main security section nodded as he got the message from Hydras. &quot;Of\n&gt; course.&quot; he said calmly. &quot;Each prisoner has been put in their cells as\n&gt; per your orders, and the doors closed and sealed. When you are done\n&gt; with Tuscon, his door will be sealed as well.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus checked a few controls as he sent Rodimus a few orders,\n&gt; meanwhile he continued his radio communication with Hydras, &quot;I will\n&gt; have Rodimus to take over here while I take care of our guest.&quot; he\n&gt; said, talking about Nightlight. &quot;Rodimus will be able to observe\n&gt; Tuscon as well as any of the other Autobots and monitor them to ensure\n&gt; that no one will be able to escape.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: Of course that monitoring will allow Tuscon and Rodimus to have\n&gt; a conversation as well. heh heh)\n&gt;\n&gt; TAG\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
