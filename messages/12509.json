She shook her head. \nShe had things to do here.  Here is where she belonged and here is \nwhere she would stay.  \n&#92;\nShe thought about Phobia. Maybe he could help he out.  She would have \nto wait for a bit, but she would go to his ship and talk to him. &quot;I \ndon&#39;t know how you can tell what I&#39;m saying or know my thoughts \nPhobia.

Somehow, possibly a subconscience kick in the head by \nTarantulas, \n&gt; she knew she would find what she was looking for in there.\n\n\n"}}
