His talons scrape on the base&#39;s metallic floor \nand his light grows stronger with every passing moment.\n\nTyrael: This, Predacons, might be my last stand. But if it is so, it \nshall be yours as well! I WILL ERADICATE YOU ALL!\n\nHe rises in the air, fast, almost as a comet, and throws two light \nshards at Skulletron, one at Waspinator and one at Quickstrike.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA few kilometers away, Vlad sees the first signs of combat as faint \nexplosions.\n\nVlad: Come, lady, we are needed. Even though we are Clan Warriors, I \ngave my word that I would assist the Tripredacus, and I will not fail.\n\nHe starts running towards the base.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Eric Bischoff&quot; &lt;1641coburn@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; : : Skulletron : :\n&gt; \n&gt; Skulletron sees the defense fire coming, and he quickly makes a leap \nbehind a boulder.
