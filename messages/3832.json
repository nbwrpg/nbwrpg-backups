She looks around a bit confused, and then \ngoes back out to the battle. She tells herself to remember to thank whoever \nhad saved her while she shoots at Hades.\n\nBlue Stinger opens her eyes. She stands up, trying to ignore the pain in her \nwing, and walks back to the battle.\n\nSona wakes up as the sword hits her neck and almost cuts her head off. She \nrolls to the side, transforming into beast mode.\n\nAntagony falls into a boulder as all the rockets and shots hit her. She goes \nunconscious.\n\n\n&gt;From: crow_lord@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Mon, 19 Jun 2000 20:12:53 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;Scorponok\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Scorponok looked at Darkmouse&#39;s Brain. He slowly Checked to make sure\n&gt;she knew of Megatron and megatron being the Leadar. He made sure She\n&gt;knew that QuickStrike was 2nd in command. He also made a list of all\n&gt;the other bots in their little group in her head. Scorponok then\n&gt;pulls\n&gt;out a little laptop and plugs it into Darkmouse&#39;s Processing unit.\n&gt;She\n&gt;pulls out, from the laptop, two little blocks with a button on it. He\n&gt;hids the laptop and the 2 blocks. He slowly wakes up Darkmouse. &quot;All\n&gt;finish.&quot; Scorponok walks away with the laptop and the two blocks. He\n&gt;puts the laptop and 1 of the blocks in his hand. He takes the other\n&gt;block and walks up too Megatron. &quot;I have a present for you Megatron.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
