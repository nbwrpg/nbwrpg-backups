He nearly falls forward, looking at the others and breathing heavily.\n\n&quot;Ok,&quot; he says in between breaths, &quot;Here&#39;s some stuff.&quot;\n\nHe produces a bunch of chips and guns out of various compartments, dumping \nthem on the table.\n\n&quot;Those chips counteract their chips,&quot; he says, regaining his breath, &quot;They&#39;ll \nreport false information that you&#39;re under the Trainer&#39;s control, but they \nwill keep you under your own control. The guns launch these chips, plus a \nmodified virus, designed to destroy the mind control chips.&quot;\n\nHe glances at them all. &quot;We each need one, if we&#39;re gonna fight them.&quot;\n\n"}}
