Earth made a simple mistake, he skimmed through my mail. I don&#39;t \nmind that he returned to base, but he is not in control, yet.\n\n::Magmatron::\n\n    &quot;Your services are welcome here Destrocons. I will allow you to choose \nyour quarters. They are down that hall and to the right.&quot; Magmatron said.\n    &quot;Now for Bobertron.&quot; He said as he saw them. &quot;Greeting Bobertron. I am \nglad to see that you have returned to base. I will be away for a little while \nand I wish for you to run the base. There is an encoded message for you in \nthe event of my death. It will only be accessed if I am offline for good. \nGood luck in running the Destrons.&quot;\n    He took his leave. Transforming to Beast Mode he flew to the Iron Fist. \nHe transformed to Robot mode. He starts to bring about a main weapon. An \nenergy blast. It would no way destroy the ship, or even dent it, but it would \nserve his purposes.\n    &quot;Iron Fist, I can destroy the ship. And I will destroy it if you don&#39;t \nsurrender utterly to me.&quot; Magmatron said. He knew that a bug was on him, he \nalso knew that it might help him.\n\n"}}
