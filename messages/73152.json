WASPINATOR had been carrying a large load\n&gt; of supplies for the group which had been dropped when he had been set upon\n&gt; by KILLER PUCNH.\n&gt;\n&gt; She SMIRKED then, landing in a graceful sommersault from the clusmy swing,\n&gt; &quot;Oh?&quot;  Her spinnerettes going up, her then firing over her machine guns over\n&gt; at the munitions, energon cubes, and other spare things WASPINATOR had been\n&gt; carrying, moving over to detonate them!\n&gt;\n&gt; While KILLER PUNCH would be nowhere near the blast radius to be hit by the\n&gt; explosion in all likelihood, an energon fueled fire and consumables would be\n&gt; no doubt hopefully quite distracting over for him and give the femme time to\n&gt; flee, abandoning WASINATOR to his fate!\n&gt;\n&gt; Assuming that the explosive fire and the resulting blaze in the jungle had\n&gt; her opponent distracted, she would switch to BEAST MODE To scuttle away in\n&gt; the darkness!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nKILLER PUNCH spun as the explosives detonated and then leaped\nbackwards. While he was not known for his agility in these matters,\nexplosive ordnance always garned much in the way of respect.\n\nAs he turned around and panned the scenery for BLACKARACHNIA she was\ngone. &quot;Blast!&quot; KILLER PUNCH said as he realized the diversionary\ntactics he had fell for. &quot;Run little insect, run!&quot; He yelled out!\n\nHe glanced back at his two comrades as he silently wondered how long\nit would be until they revived. The shielding had not yet destabilized\nenough for him to get a scan on GUILE DART and BAZOOKA.\n\nKILLER PUNCH continued to scan the area, using his sensative vision\nand hearing, knowing other higher tech sensors would be of little use\nhere . . . at least not yet.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
