Happy Holidays!)\n\nHysteria/Tavatron/Rion\n\nHysteria rolled to the left this time, and caughtthe tail end of \nObliteratron&#39;s attack. She let out a yelp as she became airborne, and landed \nseveral yads closer to the CF. This wasn&#39;t going to work. She wasn&#39;t capable \nof damaging Obliteratron! Hysteria watched as the shields fluctated, they \nwouldn&#39;t hold much longer. She ran across the plains and inside the CF, \nskidding across the floor as she made her way to (wherever Chordate is):\n\n&lt;to Chordate&gt;&quot;What&#39;s our status?&quot;\n\n*****\n\nTavatron flipped forward this time, over Scattershot&#39;s weapon&#39;s fire. She \ncouldn&#39;t keep doing this, there had to be someway to take out that flying \nslag! She sent to waves of energy at him, one from each end of the staff. \nThe first was aimed at his head, the second at his propulsion system.\n\n*****\n\nRion fell to the ground with a loud *thud*. He lay there for a moment, \ncatching his breath. He was so glad to see her! He couldn&#39;t believe it! She \nwas here, now, on the planet!!\n\n&quot;I&#39;m *gasp* glad to see you too!&quot;\n\nHe climbed to his feet, balanced, and looked at Diana with that little hint \nof mischief in his eyes that meant he was up to something. He ran at Diana, \nand playfully tried to tackle her, like they used to do when they were \nsupposed to be practicing basic self-defense:\n\n&quot;Betcha can&#39;t pin me!&quot;\n\n&gt;Scattershot flew forward, firing off twenty-five explosive rounds at\n&gt;Tavatron, the energy blast striking him in the left side.  He slowly\n&gt;descended, but his mind clicked, and he ignored the pain because he was\n&gt;psychotic.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
