Foxfingers plan had worked, unfortunately he was out of \nchips. He held still as he could hoping the autoguns would think he \nwas destroyed. He knew Darkmouse knew he was alive so it wouldn&#39;t be \nlong till she corrected them. He had two options, either escape or \nfind a place on the ship that didn&#39;t have autoguns. If he left the \noutside guns would reduce him to slag. He scanned the ship and found \nan area of the ship without guns. He stayed close to the wall \nsneaking under a few cameras. He slowly worked his way to the safe \nspot.
