This goes to everyone. If you \nhave Maxi chars, GET TO THE SLAGGING MEETING.\n\n::Kluster::\n\nKluster frowns, recieving Chordate&#39;s transmission. &quot;I see. Allright, \nput them on enemy. But if they approach, alert me. THe Maximals are \nhaving a meeting right now, but I&#39;d appreciate it if you stayed and \nwatched the scanners.&quot;\n\nHe growls, pushing a button near his seat. A transmission is sent out \nto all Maximals, repeated over and over and over untill they would be \ndetected to be within the Cybertronian Fire. The message also played \nover the intercom of the CF.\n\n&quot;All Maximals, this is the fourth call. Get to the Cybertronian \nFire&#39;s conference room immediately. This meeting is not optional.&quot;\n\nKluster ends the transmission, sitting back in his chair. What kind \nof a team was this? No wonder they needed help in the war. He looks \nat the hologram of Koj, frowning.\n\n&quot;Why did you and Inu just steal supplies from the Cybertronian Fire?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (I&#39;m taking back control of Chordate from Yanshosh)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Chordate:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Chordate sipped a cup of slightly heated energon.  It was about \nfive degrees \n&gt; lower than the temperature needed to set the energon off into an \nexplosion.  \n&gt; He spit his energon up on his lap, though he ignored that, and \nlooked at a \n&gt; monitor.\n&gt; \n&gt; He saw Koj and Inu shoot open storage chamber and continued to \nwatch them \n&gt; leave the Cybertronian Fire.  He activated his comm. unit to \nKluster and Iron \n&gt; Raptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Kluster, Iron Raptor, this is Chordate.  Those two new Maximals, \nKoj and \n&gt; Inu, have just stolen quite a bit of supplies from the Cybertronian \nFire, and \n&gt; in the direction they&#39;re heading, I can only see one real important \nthing, \n&gt; the Ark.  I&#39;m going to place them on enemy.&quot; he ended the \ntransmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; He finished putting them on enemy only a cycle later, when a \nthought popped \n&gt; into his head.  Ever since that Predacon inflitrated the \nCybertronian Fire, \n&gt; the codes had never been changed.  The comm. frequencies and shield \n&gt; frequencies had, but nothing else.\n&gt; \n&gt; He began working on that, knowing it would only take a couple \ncycles to set \n&gt; up the programs to randomly change the codes that would then send \nall the new \n&gt; codes to those with the authority.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Such as, people, I can&#39;t tell who gets which codes because I don&#39;t \nknow all \n&gt; the Maximals, but for something like emergency shut off of all \nsystems in the \n&gt; CF, new recruits wouldn&#39;t have that.  That would be just Iron \nRaptor, \n&gt; Kluster, and Chordate.  Please be logical like that when Chordate \nfinishes \n&gt; the codes and I have him send &#39;em out.  Thank you)\n\n\n"}}
