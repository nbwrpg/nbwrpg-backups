Everyone go revote on that poll. I made it ananamous (so\nthat people arn&#39;t afraid of me getting revenge or something if they vote\nyes), and I changed the question to better reflect the situation. Changing\nquestions erases the results though, so people need to revote.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt;\n&gt; Slayer shrugs in the air. &quot;Allright. Lets go to a remote continent or\nsomething.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He speeds up, approaching Maximal City, though he wasn&#39;t planning on\nstopping there.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I refuse to vote for this poll. Who ever made it was only taking into\n&gt; &gt; account one side of the arguement, and wants the answer to be no.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, it is incorrectly written, it should read: &quot;Does Zardus have the\n&gt; &gt; right to delete other player&#39;s polls if those polls are generally\n&gt; &gt; useless, offending to anyone, and/or refer to DBZ in anyway.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 21 Jul 2001, at 21:45, nbwrpg@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Enter your vote today!
