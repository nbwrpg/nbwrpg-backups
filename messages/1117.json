She nodded...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wise idea, Ramhorn. But I&#39;m afraid that just scouting out the situation\n&gt; may be wasting to much time. My scanners detect that it is an Alliance\n&gt; attack,&quot; she said while looking at the screen of a functioning comp, &quot; and\n&gt; by their amo we won&#39;t even have a base left if we don&#39;t act now. I&#39;m\nheading\n&gt; out to the field, I suggest that you and the remainder of the Maximals do\n&gt; the same.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that she deactivated her com-link and then turned to Teltoli, she\n&gt; gestured to the pile of guns and then to the doors with her hand before\n&gt; stepping down from the bridge and walking towards the Ark&#39;s doors...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I would pick more then just one weapon, Teltoli. But once you have\n&gt; selected the right ones for you please make your way to the battle field.\n&gt; It&#39;s obviously going to be an even longer day.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that Iron Raptor made her way to the doors but just before she\npushed\n&gt; them open she spoke to Iris...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Iris, if it&#39;s passable please activate the top-side auto guns. They\nwould\n&gt; be a real big help right about now.&quot;\n&gt; IRIS: &quot;Only A-6 and B-12 are functional at the moment, but I&#39;ve already\ngot\n&gt; them trained on the enemy, shall I begin to fire?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor sighed as she opened the door...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That would be nice. Yes...please.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that done she closed the doors behind her and looked out at the\n&gt; attackers, she noticed that Tavatron and Dinobot were still outside but on\n&gt; the other side of the ship opposite to the side the Alliance was\nattacking,\n&gt; she opened her com-link to them...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Tavatron, Dinobot. It&#39;s time that you both came in. There&#39;s an attack on\n&gt; the other side of the ship from you but I&#39;m afraid that you&#39;ll have to\nmiss\n&gt; it. Go and get yourselves repaired, alright? If the battle&#39;s still going\non\n&gt; when you are recovered then join in. Iron out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor left her com-link open and looked around, it was then that\nshe\n&gt; spotted two new bots off in the distance. She altered her com to them and\n&gt; spoke...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; To bot&#39;s 665 and 457 (Carnage + Cyber Claw) at this present time I would\n&gt; please wish you to come inside of the Ark. At that time you may receive\n&gt; repairs and so on.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With a quick alterationn she switched to all Maximal frequencies...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Attention Maximals, we gotta battle on our hands. If you&#39;re repaired\nthen\n&gt; please make your way to the battle field, there&#39;s fresh weapons in the\n&gt; bridge so grab a few on your way by.Iron Out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Now with that done it was time to start attacking and stop defending,\nthe\n&gt; enemy was not as big as the last but their amo made up for their number.\n&gt; Iron Raptor growled as she began to walk towards Nemesis Enforcer, she\n&gt; roared and then stopped...looking him straight in the optic.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Get lost Alliance scum, we need none of your kind around here today!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Without even waiting she took a step back and growled, she was in no\nmood\n&gt; to be messed with and it was time to let these enemies know about it!*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; SECOND BEAST MODE!!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that she transformed into her SBM and towered over the ground, the\n&gt; black exoskeleton super structure almost seeming to draw in all of the\nlight\n&gt; around her. (looks like an over-grown Alien, remember).\n&gt; She roared and then headed for the nearest target...Scavenger!\n&gt; With a reflex that would even make a viper jealous she opened her jaws and\n&gt; brought them down and around Scavenger&#39;s shoulders, it would only be\nnano&#39;s\n&gt; until her 7 inch teeth sank into his super structure and lifted him high\n&gt; into the air!*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; eLerts\n&gt; It&#39;s Easy.
