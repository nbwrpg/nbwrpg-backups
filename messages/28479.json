The \nSupernova/Flare jet fires three missiles at Unicron, one from one \nwing and one from the other, while the Vycir/Slasys/Scrap jet fires \nthree large plasma blasts at Vehement.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (Airly, an energy-signature seeking missile tracks the energy-\nsignature of a \n&gt; bot.  It focuses in on the energy-signature.  Flying side to side \nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt; exactly dodge it.  Just wanted to let you know that)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron/Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron didn&#39;t smile or show any emotion.  After Darkfate&#39;s reply, \nhis \n&gt; opinion of the being was that Darkfate was somewhere between a \ncockroach and \n&gt; the organic matter pond scum feeds upon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving sharp left through the air he dodged all but two shots that \nstruck him \n&gt; in his armored right abs, but he was relatively undamaged.  He sent \na plan to \n&gt; his followers via inner monologue comm and he began activating \nseveral \n&gt; algorithms inside the Ramora.\n&gt; \n&gt; Raising both arms he fired four missiles, all energy-signature \nseeking \n&gt; missiles, two from each arm, down at Darkfate.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement nodded at what seemed a sound plan from Unicron, firing \noff ten \n&gt; rapid optic blasts at a bat probe.  Raising his left arm, he \ncharged up a \n&gt; sonic wave and launched an invisible wave of destructive sonic \nenergy down \n&gt; towards Darkfate.  Raising his right arm, the barrel that was there \ninstead \n&gt; of the arm fired off three fire balls at Shivah.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher raised an arm, launching two energy-signature seeking \nmissiles \n&gt; from a barrel at the bottom of his wrist, the missiles heading for \nAlecto.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector would&#39;ve liked to comply with his master, but there were \nto many \n&gt; shots.  Forming a black orb in his hands, he threw it forward and \nmade it \n&gt; prematurely explode, intercepting all the lasers.  The flames from \nthe blast \n&gt; lightly scorched him, but he was relatively unhurt.  He fired off \nthree optic \n&gt; blasts at Perceptor&#39;s abdomen.\n\n\n"}}
