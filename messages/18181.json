She was the only one left, out of a \nfour hundred bot crew, she was the only surviver.  She was starting \nto feel guiltly about living when her family didn&#39;t. She cried and \nwhimpered. &quot;I&#39;m sorry mom.  I hope you can hear me, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She \ncried even harder, her tiny spark, breaking.  \n\n\n"}}
