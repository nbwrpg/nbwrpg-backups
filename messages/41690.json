Galvatron?&quot;  She looked at \nhim with a puzzled look on her face. For a brief moment, her optics \nsaw blurred images of things that had been. She slapped her hand \nagainst her head. &quot;Why can&#39;t I remember?&quot; as she snapped at herself.  \nShe saw him sit down. She relaxed a bit and lowered her pistol. But \nshe kept it in her hand.  &quot;Where have I been? I&#39;ve been sleeping. You \nknow, Hybernating. Things got to hot for a while, so I just made \nmyself disappear. Hey, that&#39;s what us rodents do best.&quot; She gave him \na half a smile. She was uneasy about this bot. He was so nice and \nfriendly. Was he a maximal? &quot;Your not a maximal are you?&quot; as she \nnarrowed her optics at him and slowly raised her gun again.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  He smiled. &quot;Im sure youve heard of me. My name is Galvatron. I \nknow you bec \n&gt; once Magnus was  a friend of yours and I do contain memories from \nthat \n&gt; experience. And the emotions of careing and understanding of you \nthat came \n&gt; with. He is running around on this planet somewhere I am sure. But \nright now \n&gt; I wish just to talk to you.&quot; he sat down n a rock. &quot;Where have you \nbeen all \n&gt; this time?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
