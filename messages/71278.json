He decided that true courtship was best kept for\n&gt; when he could finally see her as he hoped to see her, with his own eyes.\n&gt; Yet, at this moment he was very happy.  Just to have someone in his life \n&gt; was\n&gt; a gift enough for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; When I first came back online, I thought there may have been a power\n&gt; outage in the med bay.  Then I was told it was no loss of power.  The \n&gt; medics\n&gt; told me that the cranial shot I sustained was the culprit for my visual\n&gt; impairment and that they weren&#39;t positive, but thought the damgage could \n&gt; be\n&gt; reversed.  After that, I recovered from other physical damages, but got \n&gt; used\n&gt; to being blind.  Other senses compensated for that and I just accepted it\n&gt; for what it was.  Then an Autobot engineer came up with the idea of \n&gt; fitting\n&gt; me with a sonar system, and it worked.  I suppose I won&#39;t be needing it\n&gt; anymore once the repairs are complete.  That&#39;s - if it can be repaired.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I knew it would take a long time, so I procrastinated and things got out\n&gt; of hand during the wars against the predicons and Decepticons, so I put \n&gt; that\n&gt; on hold for a while, until we found a moment of calm.  So much for that.\n&gt; Now that Hydras and the Decepticons are at full force, and us with just a\n&gt; small handful of warriors, I fear that a full sense of calm won&#39;t be\n&gt; achieved.  It&#39;s up to Rodimus, Lord Elder and myself to get us to that\n&gt; point.  I know we can do it, and if I&#39;m going to pull my weight in this \n&gt; war,\n&gt; I have to have all my senses online, including my sight.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His crystal blue optics although dimmed, shimmer like aquamarines against\n&gt; the sun, as the light of the room catches them. Only until his sight is\n&gt; returned, would they once again be iluminated with the same light as the\n&gt; optics of all the others.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Talon:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes&quot;whispered Talon&quot;It&#39;s time &quot; and she Give him a deep and sweet Kiss\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message----- \n&gt; &gt; From: Sandy\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, June 12, 2011 4:40 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: the ARK to awaken from sleep!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: This one&#39;s for Airshadow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson returns her kisses with some of his own, and then holds her \n&gt; &gt; gently\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; his arms.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What I wouldn&#39;t do to be able to see you with my own eyes, and finally\n&gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; my optical sensors repaired permanently.

If he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were human it might even seem like a blush. &quot;Who can say Uproar, who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can say? I would imagine that that is something that we may all want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to do at some point.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; TORCA and NOCTORRO walked with ELDER as well, their large forms\n&gt; &gt; &gt; swaying as they walked, the sound of their footsteps large and heavy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as their metal booted feet hit the deck plating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We still must talk.&quot; TORCA said looking at ELDER, his tone somber and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resigned. NOCTORRO was tapping out a small message as they talked, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he looked up and nodded in agreement as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ELDER nodded as he glanced at TORCA and then at the others. &quot;Uproar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; why don&#39;t you show Perceptor around the base and help him get settled\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in, I would imagine he will need to find some quarters and perhaps a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recharging chamber coded to his requirements.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ******************************************\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moving to Legacy&#39;s quarters, Straight Shot thinks for a moment \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying anything, which was her best of traits.  Once she had an idea\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what she wanted to say, she looks up to Legacy, with an air of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sincerity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always had for everyone, including her brother.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Thanks, for letting me talk to you, I appreciate it.  I just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wanted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ya know that I think my brother doesn&#39;t quite understand where \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coming from and maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s so critical of your actions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always been like that, not just around you, but with me too, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes it gets on my nerves.  But with things as they are, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happened ta him in the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s put up such \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and why he&#39;s so determined ta think off the pavement.  And maybe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed with mine too, at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Honestly though, how do you feel about his thinking outside the box?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a reason why you&#39;d rather not go that way?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For a moment LEGACY looked confused, his single crimson optic boring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into STRAIGHT SHOT as his mind ran over what she said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I do not understand all of the colloquialisms than you have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; utilized.&quot; He said at last, &quot;But I ascertain that you are attempting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to explain your sibling&#39;s actions to me and inquiring as to why I will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not allow Tuscon to disturb Optimus Prime&#39;s chassis.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; LEGACY&#39;s optic flickered for a moment. &quot;I appreciate your intent.&quot; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said his words clear and well articulated. &quot;But I do not require an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explanation, since I have taken no offense to his actions; to do so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be an inefficient use of my time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;However to answer your question I will replay something for you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turning to the screen that was standing behind LEGACY he fired a beam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of energy at it. But instead of it exploding into shards of glass and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; debris it simply changed to show a mountainous scene, a volcano, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then the volcano exploding to reveal the Ark. It was obvious from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; motion that the events were being speeded up for ease of viewing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Soon after it happened a small satellite like device rose up from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ark and began to travel away from it and after a while return. After\n&gt; &gt; &gt; another short moment, short because of the speeded up play back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MEGATRON flew out along with STARSCREAM, SOUNDWAVE and a few other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Decepticon seekers, obviously having been repaired by the device. They\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all land on a cliff and look back at the Ark, and STARSCREAM fires a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blast at the Ark and they all fly off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Inside the Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMUS PRIME is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also is knocked into the beam and his repair process begins.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (OOC: This is the scene from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the bots and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cons fell to earth and 4 million years had passed.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The scene fades to black.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;These sequence of cannot be disrupted.&quot; LEGACY intoned coldly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Without the Autobots none of you would be here.&quot; LEGACY turned back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to face STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;And without the Decepticon&#39;s attack on the Ark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Autobots will not survive.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; LEGACY folded his arms behind his back, &quot;There can be no disruption of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the time flow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There was a small beep on LEGACY&#39;s panel causing him to look over at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it. &quot;Interesting.&quot; He said curiously. &quot;It would seem that I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; required on the bridge.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
