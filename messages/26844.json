He reaches up with his arms \nand opens his chest plate, a blast of pure energy erupting from it \nand smashing into Motormaster. After the blast is through, Liono \ncloses his chest plate, one of his hands covering the hole right \nbelow his chest.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; No you didnt dont worry about it, I can barely rmember as he never \nused it\n&gt; in the show.
