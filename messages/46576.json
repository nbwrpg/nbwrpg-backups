The real\n&gt;       one. Another person posted that characters are not allowed to \ndie\n&gt;       currently...he is utterly incorrect.\n&gt; \n&gt;       The problem is the role-playing 101 aspect. People are given \nthe\n&gt;       responsibility to judge how much damage they take...however \nas we&#39;ve seen\n&gt;       some can&#39;t role-play their way out of a wet paper bag let \nalone responsibly\n&gt;       judge how much damage their character takes. When a bot does \nget damaged\n&gt;       what typically happens here?\n&gt; \n&gt;       Here&#39;s the list:\n&gt; \n&gt;       1) The enemy bot suddenly becomes cockeyed unable to hit the \nbroad side of a\n&gt;       barn even if he was a g1 and standing over it.\n&gt; \n&gt;       2) The bot never gives chase to his prey. It always lets the \nlong time\n&gt;       character slip away.\n&gt; \n&gt;       3) A short stay (a few hours usually) in the CR chamber and \nany damage is\n&gt;       completely gone.\n&gt; \n&gt;       4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back as an \nenemy\n&gt;       infiltrator.\n&gt; \n&gt;       5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone appears which after \nvarious meeting\n&gt;       with colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; turns good again. Personality \nreverts to\n&gt;       pre-evil clone.\n&gt; \n&gt;       6) Character &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful \noffspring. Personality\n&gt;       is hardly different.\n&gt; \n&gt;       7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but the players 6 other characters cart \nit&#39;s blasted\n&gt;       carcass back to a lab where they resurrect him.\n&gt; \n&gt;       8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with new bot same \npersonality...eventually\n&gt;       people will forget you died and you can go back to your old \nform.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Since most will never let their &quot;favorite&quot; character(s) die, \nI mean truly\n&gt;       die, never come back like, there&#39;s really very little new \nplotlines you can\n&gt;       do with them without repeating rehashed already done ones. \nTake for example\n&gt;       the geotrons planing to attack the new cat faction....both \nfactions will\n&gt;       survive, I doubt either player who controls the majority of \nbots in either\n&gt;       faction is gonna let their characters get anywhere near \nkilled.\n&gt; \n&gt;       And what&#39;s to stop this from happening if a restart/sequel \nDOES occur? The\n&gt;       role-playing by some will still stink, characters will still \nbe incapable of\n&gt;       dying and given another year or so all plotlines for THAT \ngame will be\n&gt;       starting to repeat. While I still do believe a restart/sequel \nis in order I\n&gt;       think the role-playing problem needs addressing first to stop \na repeat of\n&gt;       what&#39;s happening to NBW.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;       From: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt;\n&gt;       To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt;       Sent: Sunday, January 20, 2002 5:57 AM\n&gt;       Subject: All Read: Important\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       &gt; My appologies, Narrator, I actually missed your original \npost.\n&gt;       &gt;\n&gt;       &gt; I find that Neo Beast Wars has been dragged on for too \nlong, and the\n&gt;       &gt; world is becoming clogged with bases among other things. \nIdeas are\n&gt;       &gt; becoming exausted, if not completely exausted already. It \nseems to\n&gt;       &gt; me that we are almost delaying the end of the rpg. If \nyou&#39;ve created\n&gt;       &gt; one storyline that you like, is it not fair to say that you \ncan\n&gt;       &gt; create another better one?\n&gt;       &gt;\n&gt;       &gt; The idea of creating a sequel to the rpg is one that I \nwould agree\n&gt;       &gt; with. That would require several things to happen:\n&gt;       &gt; 1) Changing the name of the RPG.\n&gt;       &gt; 2) Appropriate changes to the website.\n&gt;       &gt; 3) A means to store all of everyone&#39;s previous characters \n(don&#39;t\n&gt;       &gt; know about everyone else, but I don&#39;t want to lose the \nbio&#39;s of all\n&gt;       &gt; my characters).\n&gt;       &gt; 4) New story (i have an idea, not necessarily for the \nstory, but for\n&gt;       &gt; how we could create the story).\n&gt;       &gt; 5) A catalyst to start us all off (the story should provide \nthat).\n&gt;       &gt; 6) Implementation of new rules, some of which have been, \nand are\n&gt;       &gt; being, discussed in the login messageboard.\n&gt;       &gt; 7) other stuff that could be written if I wasn&#39;t so tired.\n&gt;       &gt;\n&gt;       &gt; All in all, since there are more people voting anti-restart \nthat I&#39;d\n&gt;       &gt; anticpated, I&#39;ll ask everyone a perhaps fate deciding \nquestion:\n&gt;       &gt;\n&gt;       &gt; Would it be favourable to have a sequel instead of a \nrestart?\n&gt;       &gt;\n&gt;       &gt;\n&gt;       &gt;\n&gt;       &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; I&#39;m agree with Soulstice, restart isn&#39;t good idea. All \nhave good\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; story-lines and good characters. Perhaps the best would be\n&gt;       &gt; eliminate\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; less importat characters of our story-line (every rpgers \ncould\n&gt;       &gt; choice\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; at whom wants eliminate) and elimitante factions where \nare member\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t posting and join factions that have few \ncharacters\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; playing.\n&gt;       &gt; &gt;\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; That other way than restart.\n&gt;       &gt; &gt;\n&gt;       &gt; &gt;\n&gt;       &gt; &gt;\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I at first wasn&#39;t sure if I could vote in this \none. Not\n&gt;       &gt; only\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; am I seemingly not too much an important part of this \nRPG, despite\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; the general current lack of members, and the fact that \nI&#39;ve been\n&gt;       &gt; here\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; for getting close to 2 years, but also I am not involved \nin this\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; restart. I have very few characters. Characters that, if \nthe RPG\n&gt;       &gt; is\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; restarted, will still be together (Insecticons, \nspecifically), and\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; therefore it wouldn&#39;t harm me to vote yes. However, I \ndon&#39;t think\n&gt;       &gt; I\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; could vote yes, because I am apposed to restarting the \nRPG. I have\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; decided to vote no. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me to \nend the\n&gt;       &gt; saga\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; of Neo Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked \nhard over\n&gt;       &gt; the\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; years to keep going. I don&#39;t think that we could suddenly \npretend\n&gt;       &gt; it\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; never happened, I think it&#39;s impossible. Maybe if we \nended it and\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; started the sequel, I wouldn&#39;t mind so much, but \notherwise, my\n&gt;       &gt; vote\n&gt;       &gt; &gt; is no.
