He didn&#39;t like \nthe sounds of it. He had nothing with him to tell him how the auto-guns here \nfairing. He wasn&#39;t in the control room. He was blindly in the cooridor. He \ntensed with the explosions of the battle outside. He shoulders were bunched \nand his odd looking hands were crunched together when others bunched their \nfists togeher. Quickstrike had to improvise on that. He had his little ways \nto get his messages out. His face was his best expression, and now they were \nwild.\n\nHe was confident, but he wasn&#39;t sure how the aut-guns would last. He \nremembered almost more than half of the aut-guns were destoryed in one \nbattle with Hell Beast&#39;s troops when he turned them against the scums. But \nhe was sure the shields would hold. Sure the Maximals could shoot the \nauto-guns to the high Pit, but they couldn&#39;t get past the shields.\n\n&quot;Guard th&#39; ramp jus&#39; incase somethin&#39; happens,&quot; he said to Mantella, then \nbolted off.\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Sun, 11 Jun 2000 20:31:25 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;The Populists were blasted by the shots and fired back, Suukie was out of\n&gt;sight now, and unbeknownst to the People&#39;s Group, he was right up to the\n&gt;Pred Base destroying Autoguns, and just looking for a Pred beeating!...\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Sunday, June 11, 2000 8:01 PM\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike jolted straight.
