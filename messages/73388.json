This further loosens up dull scale like film which comes\n&gt; off like silver translucent material, similar to what a snake sheds.\n&gt; Beneath it, brilliant shimmering scales emerge.  It was like he was slowly\n&gt; evolving beneath an old skin.  And as serpents do, his tail seems to grow a\n&gt; tiny bit longer with the shedding of his old skin.  Yet this was only\n&gt; happening in his beast mode.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmm..  Talon, could you scratch behind my neck for me?  It&#39;s the one place\n&gt; I can&#39;t reach.  I&#39;ve never encountered shedding, and this must be what\n&gt; happened to the old dragon from time to time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Uproar looks to the shed material curiously and paws at it.  He finds it\n&gt; hard like metal.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Woah, it got really hard.  Like armor almost.  Neat.  This must happen ta\n&gt; reptiles all the time.  I&#39;ve even heard of spiders shedding skins if you can\n&gt; believe that.  Ughhh..  I bet Tarantulus does that too, when he&#39;s in spider\n&gt; mode. Hey speak&#39;n of natural processes, dragons are thought ta breathe fire,\n&gt; but you don&#39;t seem ta do that huh?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson shakes his head.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No, but I do recall being able to produce some electrical particles using\n&gt; the same principle .  And when I roar, it mimics the sound of thunder.  I\n&gt; suspect the old dragon was some sort of elemental master.  He breathes\n&gt; lightning and roars out thunder through his vocal chords.  I&#39;m beginning to\n&gt; think he may have past that down to me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Uproar chuckles.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That means when you and Talon have a family, your offspring is gonna\n&gt; inherit that ability.  Ya never know, your first kid might end up being a\n&gt; dragon, or ya might get lucky and have one of each.  But if it does take\n&gt; after dear old dad, better make sure it&#39;s not a fire breather.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson chuckles and rubs his paw on Uproars head, messing up his fur in a\n&gt; playful manner.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;ll see, don&#39;t count the dragons before they hatch.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Uproar continues to laugh.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No, seriously, dragons are known ta have more than just one offspring.\n&gt; They&#39;re like gators and crocs, they tend to have a clutch of eggs that hatch\n&gt; into hatchlings.   Reptiles and birds normally produce eggs that hatch when\n&gt; they&#39;ve fully developed.  The only exception is, that some snake species\n&gt; actually bare live young.  Now that could happen too, but for the most part,\n&gt; dragons lay eggs and so do birds.  Soooo, you guys might just produce a\n&gt; small clutch of eggs that need ta be incubated over a course of time.  I\n&gt; dunno, its just some intel I read on birds and reptiles.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s alright, I&#39;ve read that too at one point.  You&#39;re correct, it could\n&gt; happen that way.  Which makes me curious as to other organic properties I\n&gt; seem to be experiencing..  Like hunger...  I admit, I snapped up a fish from\n&gt; a near by water source and I consumed it in beast mode.  And the other\n&gt; mammals for some odd reason sparked my appetite.  But I didn&#39;t have the\n&gt; spark to hunt them.  I merely got a meal from the water instead. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Uproar nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Confession, I took down a wild pig and I ate it... In beast mode of\n&gt; course.  And it tasted really good too.  I bet Stanton would know what&#39;s\n&gt; happening to us, right Stanton?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs TUCSON and NIGHTSHIFT talked a troubled expression was on BUMP&#39;s\nface. He glanced over at SANTON who only nodded.\n\n&quot;You must be careful.&quot; SANTON said as he and BUMP carefully prepared\nNIGHTSHIFT in an effort to cure him of the spreading metallic\ninfection. &quot;Despite the fact that we have these beast modes we are not\ntruly organic life.&quot;\n\nBUMP nodded, &quot;We still have gyro stabilizers instead of fluid based\ninner ear chambers. We have energon pumps instead of organic hearts.&quot;\nHe shook his head, &quot;We are not truely beasts with genetic codes who\nlay eggs and such.&quot;\n\nThere was a pause as BUMP reached over to pull a sensor closer to\nNIGHTSHIFT, &quot;Just because the natural animals do certain things\ndoesn&#39;t mean that we do.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; SANTON said, &quot;We do not become animals, we only simulate them\nclosely enough that we become virtually indistinguishable from them.&quot;\n\n&quot;I have analyzed the infection.&quot; LEGACY said as he turned and faced\nthe others folding his arms behind his back. &quot;This &#39;infection&#39; is not\ntrying to terminate you Nightshift.&quot; LEGACY said in cold\nmatter-of-fact tones. &quot;It is trying to strip you of all your organic\ncomponants to make you completely Cybertronian.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
