I mean at the end of the day\n&gt; we&#39;re in an RPG that essentially is international. As\n&gt; such there are often MASSIVE time zone differences\n&gt; between some players. I mean I&#39;ve been trying to be\n&gt; diplomatic about the issue, but to be blunt, this\n&gt; situation is really starting to PISS ME OFF!!!!! I&#39;m\n&gt; at the moment in the middle of a scene where I can&#39;t\n&gt; fairly reply (the attn: maximals one) because people\n&gt; are posting 40 replies when I&#39;m either at work or\n&gt; asleep.  Airly, you say that the council should\n&gt; discuss this issue, well tell me, excatly WHEN you\n&gt; plan on doing this. The fact is that this is exactly\n&gt; in the vein of the split second posting and not\n&gt; posting for other characters rule. It effectively\n&gt; stops players from being able to play properly, and I\n&gt; for one am getting SICK OF IT!!!!! So how about we\n&gt; bypass the discussion and use a little something\n&gt; called common sense and just be aware of any players\n&gt; who aren&#39;t getting a fair chance to respond.\n&gt; \n&gt; *gets off soapbox*\n&gt; \n&gt;  --- Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; I really think we should go with this way in the title\n&gt; of our posts. \n&gt; It would make it all easier for everyone, and those\n&gt; who wanted to do \n&gt; only the posts where their chars are concerned could\n&gt; do it much more \n&gt; easily.

I&#39;m in 50 lists, over half of\n&gt; those are RPGs... \n&gt; so... makes \n&gt; &gt; it difficult for me to... check 100+ emails a day\n&gt; when I don&#39;t \n&gt; have much time \n&gt; &gt; as it is.

I&#39;ve mentioned this to Airly...\n&gt; about in the \n&gt; subject \n&gt; &gt; heading.. putting the title of the &quot;scene&quot; then in\n&gt; (( ))  put the \n&gt; character that is \n&gt; &gt; posting followed by an ATTN then the characters that\n&gt; are to read & \n&gt; respond to \n&gt; &gt; a certain post.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve learned this from a couple other RPGs in which\n&gt; has made \n&gt; RPGing MUCH \n&gt; &gt; easier... defered from wrong posting, blitz posted,\n&gt; etc. Keeping \n&gt; the story at a \n&gt; &gt; steady enough pace & a VERY good storyline too. \n&gt; &gt; Maybe we can adopt this?
