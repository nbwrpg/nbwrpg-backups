But you \nshould be feeling better shortly.&quot;\nShe stayed next to him. She was getting worried.  Quickstrike was \ndown and needed help and attention.  KitKat was off at the Vokcave \nlooking for Rowdy.   Stringtra and Wildfire were off in the forest \nafter Wildfire told her there was danger out there. Megatron was who \nknows where doing who knows what and the Matrix knew when he would \nreturn.  \nThat left her, Terrorsaur, Scorponok and Drillbit.  She felt scared \nand sick at the same time.  No one was there other than Scorponok, \nwho could lead the group.  And she hadn&#39;t seen Scorponok for a while.\nShe knew that if something happened, she couldn&#39;t defend the base and \nthe others for very long.  She had the autoweapons and a few other \nlittle tricks, but nothing that would stay off an attacker for a \nreally long time.  She was getting nervous.  She got up and walked \nover to Terrorsaur.  She looked up at him with worry in her eyes.\n\n&quot;If anything happens, can I count on you to help me around here? I \nwill be needing you eventually. There are only 5 of us here at the \nbase. And you are the strongest out of all of us right now. Please \ntell me that when the time comes, I can count on you to help?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike looked up at Dark Mouse with his foot still propped up \nagainst \n&gt; the wall. He nodded to her in agreement for her help. &quot;Go ahead!&quot; \nhe \n&gt; mumbled.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
