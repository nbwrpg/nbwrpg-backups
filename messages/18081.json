All she had wanted was a meal and now she was pined in, \nnowhere to go but fight her way though. And she was vastly outnumbered as \nwell.\nRage roared/whined as she swung her body away from the directions the damage \nwas coming from, only to swing into the direction which another bot was \ncharging her at(Hurricane) but also managed to get a few of the 25 shots \nTreadshot had aimed towards her as well.\nShe backed up a few steps to avoid the charging bot but then was blown onto \nher side from the amo sent towards her from Treadshot.\nRage landed hard onto her side, a wave of dirt billowing up as she slid a \nfew feet, giving off a surprised, pained and raged roar.\nShe lay there for a second before she heaved her great body once to try and \nstand, finding that she hadn�t succeeded she tried again and managed to \nright herself. Her body low and supporting her weight with her front limbs, \nlooking towards her attackers.\nShe had to get away, and quickly�before they managed to kill her.\nRage just began to turn and head towards the forest line when she was \nsuddenly hit in the right side by a crimson beam(His), but absorbing the \nimpact of the blow with all of her limbs.\nBy now she was completely torn, mech-fluid flowing everywhere and wires \nhanging from her sides.\nBut now she had more of a need to get away then ever, snapping her body \ntowards the forest again, and began heading towards it at a dead run.\nAll that was in her mind was that she had to get away, had to get away!!\nShe was almost there when something chilly suddenly struck her head and \nsomething painful hit her legs at the same time, tipping her over and snout \nfirst into the dirt.\nHer head was frozen, and she was unable to open her mouth to give a roar of \nprotest as dirt flew up and her body crashed to earth.\nThe only thing which stopped her body from sliding was the fact that it had \ncollided into a tree, knocking the trunk of it over and crashing across her \nbody, pinning it.\nRage struggled weakly under the weight of the tree, but soon her struggling \nbecame weak quivers and movements of her muscles.\nThere was no escape!:\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
