He looks at the three, his optics level with Dinobot&#39;s.\n\nStriker&#39;s shoulder blaster emerge, aiming at Dinobot and Cyber Claw, &quot;I \nordered both of you to take a step back. No one is leaving untill this is \nsettled. WITHOUT violence,&quot; he adds, looking kinda hypocritical with two guns \nand two shoulder blasters aimed at the bots.\n\n&quot;Now, both of you take several steps back,&quot; he says sharply to the two bots, \n&quot;And you transform,&quot; he orders, looking at Cyber Claw.\n\n"}}
