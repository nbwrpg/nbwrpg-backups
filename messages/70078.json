If you want to back up and RP, make any changes or additions,\nplease let me know. I have made it look grim, hope you guys are\nsatisfied with it)\n\nBIC:\n\n&gt; Hydras hissed &quot;Separate the bots named Kup and Nightshift, I want them in\n&gt; the high security cells and also I like that they dont know where is the\n&gt; other one... Set the Scanners in order to have a check out every 5 cicles&quot;\n&gt; and looking to Tucson said &quot;And our special Guest will have The Pit...&quot;\n\nAs Hydras gave orders, Cyclonus entered the different commands into\nthe system. Some doors closed while others opened allowing Hydras\naccess to the &#39;PIT&#39; as he described it. In addition to being small and\nconfined, like a real pit it was positioned below the main cell block\nsection.\n\nAs Hydras approached, one could not help but notice the cannons that\nwere oriented along the way along with security cameras. Occasionally\na purple strobe light would flash along the hall as if scanning it for\nintruders.\n\nWhen Hydras approached the &#39;PIT&#39; with Tuscon in tow, the door to it\nopened, allowing heat and steam to hiss as they escaped the room.\n\nThe interior of the room itself was approximately the size of a cargo\npod - just large enough enough to hold a single transformer, and even\nthen only manacled. The tempature of the room could only be called\nhot! A human, should he or she have the unfortunate circumstance to\narrive here, would quickly be overcome by the heat.\n\nThe walls of the room were cut from a mixture of stone and galvanized\nCybertronian metals, they were solid and thick, seemingly designed for\nbrute strength and durability. The manacles that were positioned along\nthe wall were also thick and cut apparently from the same type of\nmetal as the walls. They were attached directly to the walls and\nallowed very little if any movement, depending on the mercy of the one\nadministering the punishment.\n\nOnly a single machine was positioned in this chamber, presumably to\nprovide the energy requirements for transformers. (OOC: Transformers\nfood and drink). This machine also provided the only illumination for\nthe room, and also like the lights in the chambers above, the machine\nwas recessed into the walls and protected by a transparent material\nunless it was feeding time.\n\nAt the moment the illumination from the machine was bright, but it\nwould dim as the door closed or if commanded by Hydras or some other\nduly appointed security officer.\n\n&gt; Then he send a private messages to Cyclonus&quot; Cyclonus, go to\n&gt; the throne Room and take the lady with you... Be glente, she&#39;s one of us, I\n&gt; want that you keep an eye in her while Perceptor is busy here... If\n&gt; something happens her, you will pay for that, understood?&quot;\n\nCyclonus, who had been observing the progress of each one from the\nmain security section nodded as he got the message from Hydras. &quot;Of\ncourse.&quot; he said calmly. &quot;Each prisoner has been put in their cells as\nper your orders, and the doors closed and sealed. When you are done\nwith Tuscon, his door will be sealed as well.&quot;\n\nCyclonus checked a few controls as he sent Rodimus a few orders,\nmeanwhile he continued his radio communication with Hydras, &quot;I will\nhave Rodimus to take over here while I take care of our guest.&quot; he\nsaid, talking about Nightlight. &quot;Rodimus will be able to observe\nTuscon as well as any of the other Autobots and monitor them to ensure\nthat no one will be able to escape.&quot;\n\n(OOC: Of course that monitoring will allow Tuscon and Rodimus to have\na conversation as well. heh heh)\n\nTAG\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
