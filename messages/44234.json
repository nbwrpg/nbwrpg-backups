I know much more than I knew when I last saw \nyou, but I still don&#39;t know what is going on on this planet. Is your \nwar with the Maximals over, or is this a continuation. That bot said \nhe wasn&#39;t a Predicon, but wanted me dead when he thought I was a \nMaximal. Do you know what&#39;s happening?\n\nHe was intentionally trying to sound smart because he didn&#39;t want \nRampage to think he was the retarded bot he had once befriended \nalthough he was still a friend. He also felt that this was an \nimmotional moment that called for advanced dialogue.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I&#39;m gonna say yeah, because I am not sure what JP did with him \nwhen\n&gt; he first brought him back. Kslawdogg do you know? Yeah it is moding \nnot\n&gt; to accept dammage, but I am accepting dammage, I got hit by your \nstun\n&gt; gun, and Megatron&#39;s main arm dosent work. Plus I&#39;ve already accepted\n&gt; lots of dammage this fight, from KSLawdogg (could you respond to\n&gt; Spasstik&#39;s attacks big guy:) and Prowl. Plus I am going somewhere \nwith\n&gt; this.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron did not let any of this faze him. He was suprised this was \nnot\n&gt; a Maximal. &quot;Never call me a Predacon.&quot; Megatron said through \nclenched\n&gt; teeth. He strained to raise his cannon arm again, aiming at Mutate. \nWith\n&gt; a quivering strain, he aimed at the mutated creature.\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n&gt; \n&gt; Rampage rode over the terrain, his treads grinding the earth. He \nlooked\n&gt; up at the two hovering robots. &quot;Ahhh it is you my friend.&quot; He \nwhispered,\n&gt; when he then noticed the one robot aiming at him. &quot;It can&#39;t be,\n&gt; Megatron, ho ho ho, we are going to have fun here. HERE ARE SOME \nIRON\n&gt; RATIONS.&quot; he screamed as his gattling gun barrel turned, then fired \noff\n&gt; a rocket at the Decepticon leader. The shell screamed off towards \nthe\n&gt; Decepticon leader, leaving a trail of smoke as it slammed into\n&gt; Megatron&#39;s back, tearing a hole into his armor, and sending him\n&gt; plummeting to the ground.\n\n\n"}}
