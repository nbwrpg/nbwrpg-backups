She always relied on \nherself to get through things. She was going to rely on her mind to \nget her to this new plan, and settle herself down, keep a low \nprofile. \n\nSomething finally clicked. That one bot at the new Predacon base \nsounded welcoming to her, even sounded like he wanted her to stay. \nThat is if she felt like it. Bug-boy didn&#39;t like her. She could \nsettle down there until she could figure out what the Vok wanted.\n\nShe followed her nose and navagational systems and walked on, towards \nthe position of the Typicon (Being terrible today with writing. \nForgive me.)\n\n\n"}}
