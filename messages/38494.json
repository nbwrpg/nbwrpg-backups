Weaponfire passes by inches under him, but none hits him as\nhe flies up, turning sharply and now flying back the way he came, the\nthree Preds and him facing away from each other at the moment.\n\n&quot;And run is exactly what I&#39;m planning to do,&quot; Slayer replies to the\nshout quietly, more to himself than to the Preds, since they\nprobably wouldn&#39;t be able to hear him anyways. Now flying back toward\nthe destroyed trainer base, he adjusts his course a bit, heading\nsouth.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; lUZBEL/ KALI/ ATTILA::\n&gt;\n&gt; the three bot increased hteir speed too and soon were behind\nSlayer. &gt; Luzbel and attilla fired 25 times and kali fired 2\nmissiles. the &gt; three bots tried to force Slayer let go of Ignatius.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You can run, but not hide &quot; shouted Luzbel\n\n\n"}}
