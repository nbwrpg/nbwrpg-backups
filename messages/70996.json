I hope that helps.\n\nPreston\n\n\nPreston&#39;s Posts (70985 & 70986=\r\n)\n\nRe: Wicked Blades in the Dark!!\n\n\nNear to the Black Tower:\n\nAs Tuscon an=\r\nd the rest lay down their weapons, the other soldiers move\nto encircle the =\r\nMaximals and the Autobots. Insecticon, Bruticus-X, and\nIguanus moved in alm=\r\nost eagerly to pick up the mighty weapons that\nTuscon has dropped, while In=\r\nferno, the self proclaimed bodyguard of\nHydras watched Tuscon carefully, hi=\r\ns optic ready to spot treachery.\n\nQuietly a short message is sent to Tuscon=\r\n, =93Tuscon.=94 The deep voice of\nNoctorro, the leader of the Maximal Fuzor=\r\ns can be heard, =93My team is\nhere. Rodimus sent us to aid you. None too so=\r\non it would seem.=94\nNoctorro=92s words are grim, a soldier=92s humor in th=\r\nem. =93We await your\nsignal.=94\n\nAt the same time Injector, Buzzclaw, Terro=\r\nrgator, and Quickstrike move\nto do the same with Kup, Nightshift, Straights=\r\nhot, Talon and the\nothers. Skyshadow, the leader of the Predacon Fuzors jus=\r\nt watches with\na gloating look on his face, it is almost as if he wants the=\r\nm to\nattack and keep the battle going.\n\nMeanwhile Phobia and several sweeps=\r\n keep an eye on things from the\nair, while Terrorsaur and Waspinator landed=\r\n, ready to help out as\nneeded.\n\nAt the same time Legacy processed Tuscon=92=\r\ns command for him to leave\nthe Ark. There was a long pause, and then the te=\r\nmporal guardian=92s cold\nvoice comes across the channel, =93I will not comp=\r\nly with your command.\nI have been tasked with the . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;\n\nDeepst=\r\nryke transmits to Hydras, =93Hydras. I am picking up an encrypted\ntransmiss=\r\nions to and from Tuscon, he is attempting to communicate with\nthe others. I=\r\n am generating a radio dampening field now in this area.\nOnly the Predacons=\r\n will be able to transmit.=94\n\n\nMeanwhile inside the Black Tower:\n\nWindlord=\r\n=92s attempt to open fire on the Scourge was met with a measure\nof futility=\r\n. Scourge just stepped away from the opening that Windlord\nfired out from a=\r\nnd let the shots go harmlessly into a bulkhead,\nscorching it only slightly.=\r\n\n\nHowever that slight amount of time allowed Windlord and Rat Trap time\nto =\r\nscurry further into their crawl space and find an interior bulkhead\nto hide=\r\n behind.\n\n=93Scrap!=94 Scourge=92s voice said from the outside. There was a=\r\n pause and\nthen, =93Cyclonus, they have fled into the walls.=94\n\nThere was =\r\nanother pause, and then Scourge chuckled, =93Of course. I will\nbe ready for=\r\n them.=94\n\nFrom further inside the crawl space the sounds of chittering cou=\r\nld be\nheard, and then several groups of optics could be seen in the distanc=\r\ne\ncoming towards Rat Trap and Windlord. In the darkness their shapes\ncould =\r\nonly be barely made out, but they looked like black metallic\nspiders, Hydra=\r\ns=92 wall guardians!\n\n(OOC: Rat Trap may recognize them from last time. Als=\r\no keep in mind\nthat Rat Trap and Windlord should be in beast mode. They wou=\r\nld have to\nbe to fit inside the crawl space. In the toon the Beast Modes di=\r\nd not\nhave offensive weaponry, except for teeth and claws)\n\nOutside the Ark=\r\n:\n\nRodimus was positioned in a small grove of trees, ducking down behind\nse=\r\nveral large rocks. He gives Quickstride a quizzical look as the\nequine Maxi=\r\nmal sniffed him.\n\n(OOC: Quickstride=92s sniff reveals nothing wrong.)\n\nHe w=\r\nas about to let Quickstride in on what he had planned when Uproar\nappeared.=\r\n Rodimus appears taken aback though by Uproar=92s conclusion\nthat it was Le=\r\ngacy that had turned evil. While Rodimus didn=92t know\nthat much about Lega=\r\ncy, having only seen him briefly while being\nrescued and repaired, there wa=\r\ns nothing to hint that this attack was\nLegacy=92s doing. He was about to sa=\r\ny something when Uproar ran towards\nthe Ark to be let in . . .\n\n&gt;KRACK POW&lt;=\r\n\n\nAs Uproar ran towards the Ark, what seemed like a round bolt of\nlightenin=\r\ng appeared, sending Uproar flying several yards through the\nair, to land he=\r\navily on the ground! Evidently the Ark shielding was\nstill in place, and it=\r\n was not allowing anyone in.\n\nRodimus frowned, =93Uproar! Get over here! If=\r\n we are going to get back\nin, then we need to work together. That shield is=\r\n supposed to hold off\nall the Predacon forces. We are not going to get in b=\r\ny brute force.=94\n\nAs Rodimus talked three other Maximals seemed to almost =\r\nmaterialize\nout of the underbrush, such was their skills at camouflage.\n\nTh=\r\ne first was Wing Caliber, (See: http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Skywarp ) an\nold Max=\r\nimal stratagist and military teacher, who from the brownish\nfeathers along =\r\nhis frame turned into some sort of eagle.\n\nThe next was Leo II,\n(http://en.=\r\nacademic.ru/pictures/enwiki/76/Lioconvoy_gathering.jpg )\nthe adopted son of=\r\n Lio Convoy, and who looked much like him, and who\nhad obviously picked up =\r\nmany of his mannerisms. His body was\npowerfully built and heavily armored. =\r\nHe looked to turn into a lion.\n\nThe third was Ramulus (http://tfwiki.net/wi=\r\nki/Ramulus) who had like\nthe others been on patrol for a while, surveying t=\r\nhe area and trying\nto keep it free from Predacon invasion.\n\nThey also come =\r\nup beside Rodimus, Leo II, obviously the leader of the\nother two, =93What n=\r\now sir?=94\n\nRodimus looked at Quickstride and Uproar, =93Well let=92s get o=\r\nut of\nsight, and then we can discuss it.=94\n\nMeanwhile Inside the Ark:\n\nPer=\r\nceptor had received Tuscon=92s message and sent attempted to send a\nmessage=\r\n to Lord elder, however at the moment there was no answer from\nthe elder Ma=\r\nximal.\n\nAt the same time Legacy was still standing in the med lab along wit=\r\nh\nthe others, his single optic glowing in the darkness.\n\n=93It would seem t=\r\nhat Nightlight=92s vital systems are being held at\nminimal levels.=94 Legac=\r\ny said as he directed his gaze to the wall panel\nnearest Nightlight. A smal=\r\nl light blinked, indicating her spark was\nstill online, but that there was =\r\nnot enough power to reboot her\nsystems.\n\nHe turned to look at the others, h=\r\nis face glowing in the darkness, lit\nby his own optic, and the glowing bar =\r\non his chest plate. He raised\nhis right hand in the air, the one with the a=\r\nrm cannon on it and begin\nto emit light from it, much like a flash light or=\r\n a beacon so that the\nroom was illuminated. He casually looked around, =93P=\r\nerhaps we could\nlocate a back out or reserve power system . . . =93\n\nLegacy=\r\n paused as Tuscon=92s message came in. He turned to look at\nSanton, Bump an=\r\nd Perceptor, a look of disbelief momentarily flashing\nacross his face.\n\nLeg=\r\nacy straightened as his cold voice comes across the channel, =93I\nwill not =\r\ncomply with your command. I have been tasked with  . . . .\n&gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;  . .=\r\n . the protection of the Ark as well as that of the\nMatrix. I will not know=\r\ningly leave the Ark undefended or the Matrix in\nthe hands of another.=94\n\nL=\r\negacy turned to look at his console as he understoodf what happened.\nCommun=\r\nications had been cut part way through his message. He turned to\nlook at th=\r\ne others, his single optic cold, =93It is illogical to believe\nthat I would=\r\n attempt to harm the Ark or allow anyone to take it from\nthe Maximals.=94\n\n=\r\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\nOOC: Please keep in mind that radio/video communications fr=\r\nom the\nbattle field around the Black Tower have been severed for the Maxima=\r\nls\nand Autobots. Those at the Ark however are free to communicate with\neach=\r\n other if they choose.\n\nSandy&#39;s Message: (Message #70992)\n\nTucson now recie=\r\nves Notcorro&#39;s message. He thinks of a way to signal him\nwithout drawing at=\r\ntention to himself or the others. It was critical. He keeps\nhis weapons dow=\r\nn, and sends an encrypted message back to Noctorro.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re right, I&#39;m no=\r\nt exactly perfect, and help would gladly be appreciated.\nI have an idea. Wh=\r\nile I have you on an encrypted signal, I best let you know to\nstart moving =\r\nin now. But try to remain unseen, move in gradually, and quietly.\nIf you ca=\r\nn, send in several fuzors in at a time, and in phases, send in others,\nacco=\r\nrding to their skills and expertise. I will continue to hold my position\nhe=\r\nre.&quot;\n\nNight Shift and Straight Shot keep quiet. They could tell Tucson was =\r\nin thought,\nand somehow thinking up a strategy to get them out of their bin=\r\nd. He now had to\nsend a message to Legacy.\n\n&quot;Legacy, if you can hear me, I =\r\nstrongly suggest that you heed my demands and\nvacate immediately. You are e=\r\nndangering the lives of Nightlight and the others,\nand those who endanger m=\r\ny comrades, deserve not to be among them. Although, I\nwill be willing to me=\r\net with you privately in a remote location of your choice.\nBut not now. Now=\r\n is not the time. Heed my words now and things will not be\ndifficult.&quot;\n\nBac=\r\nk at the Ark, Uproar hears Rodimus, and trots over to him, looking a bit\nco=\r\nnfused. Quickstride looks over to him as well.\n\n&quot; Sorry for the fuss, hey, =\r\nwhat&#39;s go&#39;n on? Why won&#39;t the Ark open for us?&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks over to =\r\nhim.\n\n&quot;Legacy is holding the Ark hostage, I think, or at least that&#39;s what =\r\nI got from\nthe last message from Lord Elder.&quot;\n\nUproar looks to the Ark and =\r\nback at Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Whew, I&#39;m glad you stopped me, Sir. No tell&#39;n what kind =\r\nof attack I could&#39;ve\nmet up with. Okay, I&#39;m definitely in on helping you ou=\r\nt. But how are we gonna\nget the Ark back without getting blown ta scrap?&quot;\n\n=\r\nQuickstride looks to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Yeah, what he said, how are we gonna get ou=\r\nta this mess? This is something\nneither one of us has ever encountered.&quot;\n\n"}}
