They will pay, I swear! Alpha, tell the others from our group.\nWhen I get done with this IGL stuff, I intend to make the Decepticon&#39;s\nburn in the pit. How dare they take a good Maximal and turn him into one\nof them.&quot; \nHe closed his link. The look of anger turned to one of sadness. Epyon\nstarted walking. He just passed Khonkler without a word.\n\nHot Rod watched all this carefully. He had an idea what what had\nhappaned. He had seen that look many times. He had that look many times\nhimself. The look and feelings a Commander get when they loose someone\nunder their command. Hot Rod walks up to Epyon.\n&quot;It hurts, I know. I lost many under my command. Many of my friends in\nthe Great Wars. And every time, I felt that I had failed as Autobot\nCommander. I had let them down. But the truth is its not your fault.\nBlame the enemy. The ones truely at fault. Not yourself.&quot;\n\n&quot;But it is my fault Hot Rod. When Condor was taken by the Decepticons I\nsaid we&#39;ll go after him. But then their was the Maximal City project and\nnow the IGL. I kept putting it off. Now he is worse then dead. Now he is\na Decepticon.&quot;\nHe turned towards the arena.\n&quot;I hope this starts soon. I&#39;ll take some anger out on them.&quot;\n\n&quot;You sure you wont be distracted, in there?&quot; Asks Hot Rod.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Answers Epyon.\n\n"}}
