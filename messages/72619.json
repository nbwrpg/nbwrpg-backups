It was the gift of understanding even though he had done\n&gt; something incorrect.  He smiles back to him and for the first time, feels\n&gt; relief from inner torment that had burned in him for a long time.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I promise, I&#39;ll keep it in check from now on. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gives a coy grin.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Now, time to have a little fun.  By using sound at different intervals and\n&gt; frequencies, I could easily confuse the guards into thinking that we are in\n&gt; opposite directions from where we really are.  But I have to be in beast\n&gt; mode for that.  It&#39;s your call , Convoy, just give the word and I will\n&gt; execute my ploy.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBIG CONVOY and his team were still moving swiftly down the halls as\nTUSCON spoke, so at the moment he just held up his hand as he stopped\nat another branching and looked both ways.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re moving off the grid.&quot; LONG RACK warned over their encrypted\ncom link. &quot;I can track you, but I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in the rooms off\nthe halls, they are all labeled in some sort of code.&quot;\n\n&quot;Break it.&quot; CONVOY said as he glanced down at a door opening at the\nfar end of the hall.\n\nThere was a grunt from LONG RACK, &quot;It&#39;s not that simple.&quot; He sounded\nvaguely annoyed but distracted as well. &quot;I will see what I can do.&quot; He\nsaid after a moment.\n\nCONVOY glanced at TUSCON, &quot;So what were you saying about distracting\nthe guards?&quot;\n\nA door did open and down the hall came a troop of six SHARKTICON\nguards moving swiftly in their direction.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
