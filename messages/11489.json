Or he simply didn�t know how to deal with the factor that there was a warrior ahead of him that was more aggressive that he had first pondered.\nHe kept his optics on the male bot as he spoke, listening to the tension in his voice.\nSo, this bot was named Necromancer?\nHe sneered at the name, thinking that it sounded a bit soft to him. But each bot chose their name, knowing that there must have been a reason why he had chosen one such as that.\nBut his optics narrowed as the fembot interrupted, his attention being averted to her as she spoke.\nNoting that it seemed as if there was a bitter sense in her voice, almost snooty.\nDinobot growled as she spoke her name and then turned on the male bot, thinking of how they must be brother and sister at the mention of them being related.\nIt was fairly obvious. The fem seemed far too bitchy to be his wife or faience, too young to be his mother or other relation, so the only other conclusion was that she was his sister.\nHe growled at Hell Drak, knowing that such an attitude directed towards others was a bigger offense then he was sure she knew. It was disrespectful. \nAnd he wasn�t about to be disrespected by a bot such as her.\nHis voice was a growl as his tail sway behind him�*\n\n� Such disrespect to others will NOT be tolerated within the Maximal force, I assure you.�\n\n* The claws on his hands flexed, giving his point a rock solid meaning.\nDisrespect WOULDN�T be tolerated, especially by him. Disrespect towards him was most likely to be met with being backhanded by a sharpened claw. \nIf there was one thing that he believed in it was giving respect where respect was due.\nDinobot then turned his attention towards Necromancer, his aggression easing off a bit so that he was no longer glaring at him. A simple, blank look meeting the new bot.\nThe tension in his body had not eased off and his muscles nearly rippled with it, in face, when ever his chest expanded as a breath was taken in�they did.\nEven though there had been no hostility shown he still had his doubts, clearly masked by his blank expression.\nDinobot backed off a step, giving Necromancer a chance to ease off and let him know that he didn�t take him as much of a threat any longer.\nWith a flat voice he spoke�*\n\n� What are your qualifications?�\n\n* With that he waited in the darkness, his armor reflecting the moons silver light perfectly.\nBut his question was clear if one could understand it. What were their skills? That was all.*\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
