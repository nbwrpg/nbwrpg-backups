Get outside with your team and fight them! \nScourge, Mosquitor, arm youselfs and join them!\n\n::: Jackle ::: You do realize we are vastly outnumbered.\n\n::: Hell Beast growls as he activated the external Autoguns and raises \nshileds. ::: Shut up, we will not let this base fall to a bunch of money \nhungry leeches!\n\n::: Jackle ::: Should I call for MArine, Pheniox, Gremlin, and Transanulas?\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Marine and Gremlin are on there way...\n\n::: On the view screen, Scourge, and now in the distance firing at Sixshot \nare Marine and Gremlin :::\n\n::: Hell Beast, holding a chain gun ::: Excellent! Now lets get out there!\n\n::: They run down the rampand take a few shots at Shuko and his dieties. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron looks at the completed tunnles ::: Good work, yes. I am very \npleased with you work.\n\n::: Waspinator limps inside, carring himself barely. ::: Waspinator hurt!\n\n::: Megatron ::: Waht? Wheres Shredder? What happened?\n\n::: Waspinator ::: Waspinator was going just like Megatron wanted, but \nWaspinator got shot!\n\n::: Megatron slams his transmetal two T-rex foot down ::: Damn him! Get \nyouself in a CR chamber! \n\n::: Megatron thinks for a moment and checks the scanners. Sure enough there \nis a battle brewing at the Predacon base. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Ah, Waspinator! I have a much more important task for you!\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Transanulas throws another rock, bored out of his insane mind. Pheniox \ndose the same. :::\n\n::: Pheniox ::: Do you think we&#39;ll be attacked?\n\n::: Transanulas ::: I dont know, or care for that matter. \n\n::: Pheniox ::: Someones grumpy.\n\n::: Transanulas ::: And someone is also starving. This assignment is totally \nunimportant! I say we reconstruct the tower into a wepon of mass destruction!\n\n::: Pheniox ::: Really now?\n\n::: Transanulas ::: Yes. It would use the smae basic principals. Instead of \nsending Energon radiation into comm systems, we can program the tower to send \nthe radiation on a broadcast directly into a bats energy signiture.\n\n::: Pheniox ::: ...So the energon would lock on to the person and basically...\n\n::: Transanulas ::: It would kill them!\n\n::: Pheniox, being the former leader of an Anti-maximal terrorist group likes \nthe idea. ::: When do we start?\n\n::: Transanulas picks up a tool box and begin to chuckle. :::\n\n~~~~~~~`\n\n::: Waspinator, barely held together, waits outside of the Newcomers ship. \nHis mission was simple and clear. :::\n\n::: Waspinator, in his beast mode, buzzed closer, until several auto-guns \nbegan to take notice, where apon he backed away. :::\n\n::: Waspinator ::: Waspinator dont like this job!\n\n::: Ra, in his firebird beast mode hovers behinde him ::: Waspinator will die!\n\n::: Waspinator tkaes flight, without even looking to see who chasing him. He \nflys as fast and as far away from Ra as he can. Ra, though, follows him \nsending fireballs streaming past the bug. Soon, they are close to the \nmountian, where Megatron awaits. :::\n\n::: Waspinator then dives down, and Ra follows laughing in what he belives to \nbe his triumph. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Now Ive got you....\n\n::: Waspinator flys past Megatron, who pops up and fires one hit at Ra, \nsending him skidding to the ground. Both Predacons rush over to him. :::\n\n::: Ra ::: ....W-whats are you doing?\n\n::: Megatron ::: Winning the beast wars of course!\n\n::: With that, Megatron injects Ra with a tranc, and they take him inside \nthere base. :::\n\n"}}
