Kinger got my permission several times, \nand cleared it with me every step of the way. You&#39;ve escaped damage \nfor Megatron waaay to often (ie. not even responding when War, Famine, \nand Pestilance self-destructed all around him), and this will not be \none of those times. \n\nRewrite that post, taking into account everything in Kinger&#39;s, or \nyou&#39;re the one that&#39;s moding. Megatron is your character to post \ndamage for, but remember that the whole area was completely \nincinirated, so geting blown out harmlessly is not an option. \nPersonally, I don&#39;t see a way for any bot involved to get out of this \nalive.\n\nThe post you just wrote is void.
