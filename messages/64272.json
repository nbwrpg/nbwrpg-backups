Good. Exit. Need to find it. Dang!\n&gt; \n&gt;   Balistica found herself in a part she did not recognize. In fact, she\n&gt;   recognized no part of the base at all. They all looked the same\n&gt;   gunmetal color, functional, devoid of any spark. This one, however,\n&gt;   looked different. There were computers, lots of them, as well as a\n&gt;   door that clearly indicated warning signs, but warnings of what.\n&gt;   Against any common sense, Balistica entered. What she found\nsurprised her.\n&gt; \n&gt;   There was a Maximal, his affiliation symbol clearly visible on his\n&gt;   chestplate, lying down on a table. Wires ran from him to the\n&gt;   computers... or was it the other way around? Nonetheless, those Preds\n&gt;   were obviously going to do something with him... if they hadn&#39;t\n&gt;   started yet.\n&gt; \n&gt;   She walked up to him and tried to wake him up.
