The Chosen Ones still wern&#39;t there, but \nhe could explain the plan to Deemos.\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; he says, stretching out his arm. A small device emerged \nfrom his wrist comp, making a hologram of Hell Beast&#39;s old Predacon \nship.\n\n&quot;Recently, there&#39;s been alot of activity around the Predacon base,&quot; he \nbegan, the hologram zooming in on scanner reports, &quot;From what the \nscanners can say, they&#39;re doing something to the base, perhaps \nmodifying it in some way.&quot;\n\nThe hologram zooms out, zooming in on the platform the Preds were \nbuilding near the water. &quot;At the same time, Predacons belonging to \nthis same group are building a facility near the water, one that looks \nlike a launching bay. Last time we met with this group of Predacons, \nit wasn&#39;t peaceful, and since these new developments are beginning \nright after the Alliance moved to the Iron Fist, which happens to be \nin water, there is a fairly high chance that they&#39;re building \nsomething in their base to use against the Iron Fist.&quot;\n\nThe hologram zooms further in on the platform.\n\n&quot;In any case, this platform is a large threat to us until we build \nunderwater defences. Whether the Predacons are launching something at \nus from it or not, it needs to be exterminated.&quot;\n\nHe looks around at the bots, &quot;Any questions so far?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; The Oblitercons/Minion/Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark \n&gt; Claw/Scattershot/Sixshot/Ares/Double \nPunch/Manterror/Injector/Bumblebee:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The Oblitercons walked up to Zardus, followed by Scattershot, \nSixshot, and \n&gt; Ares.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch and his ex-Predacons stopped walking near Zardus, not \npaying \n&gt; heed to the three Vok, Demon Wulf, Flesh Ripper, and Dark Claw, also \n&gt; assembling near Zardus, all of th\n\n\n"}}
