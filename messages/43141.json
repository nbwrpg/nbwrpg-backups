It \nshowed that no matter how hard we&#39;re hit, we will stick together and \npull through. OK, so using  Dr, Suess may not have been the best \nthing, but the author did get the point across. No matter what, we as \na nation is here to help each other when terrible things happen and \nthat we can really pull through.  It wasn&#39;t ment to target anyone \nother than one imparticular individual, but that was obvious.\nOther than that, I&#39;m sorry. I thought perhaps you might find, not \nnessassarily humor, but at least get a smile at the job the author \nhad done.  I thought it was well writen. And the point was still \nmade, together we stand. Now and always. No matter what may come. \n\nAnyway, in the future, I shall not make the same mistake twice. I \nshall not post anything but RPG material on this message board. Once \nagain, I&#39;m sorry.\n\nLogo. \n\nIf you wish to respond, please PM me. Thank you. \n\n\n"}}
