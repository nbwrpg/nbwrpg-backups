Meaning I could come \nback, but probably not, and if I did it wouldn&#39;t be till February or \nMarch. I&#39;m giving The Trainers to Cyberwolf. The two chars I did \nbring in, I&#39;ll svae them till when and if I come back. Please don&#39;t \ntake me off the list. I plan on stopping by once a month to give you \nan update on my personnal problems, catch up on things, and tell you \nhow close I am till returning. Well, this is goodbye. Thank You all. \nI will miss you very much, even those who I have gotten into \narguements with. I wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Hawnaka\n(spelling?), Happy Kwaanza, happy New Years&#39;s, Happy Valentine&#39;s Day, \nHappy Easter, Happy Yom Kipur, and all those other holidays. Until we \nall meet again in that great big Cybertron in the sky, goodbye.\n\nYour  friend, Mike Smith(You may think that&#39;s a phony name, but it \nain&#39;t! The Frank Reinhart thing is just my e-mail name.)\n\n\n\n\nP.S. Sunday&#39;s my birthday, if you&#39;d like to know.\n\n\n"}}
