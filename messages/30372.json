She used her arm to clean \noff the screen. &quot;Man, doesn&#39;t anyone clean shop around here?&quot;  She \nnoticed that her first observation was incorrect.  She looked up at \nKitKat2 and Drillbit. &quot;Eh, hey, lovebirds. OK, I may have made a \nsmall mistake in my calculations.  It seams there&#39;s only one bot at \nthe CF. Sorry  I broke you two up from getting all,&quot; she stuck out \nher tongue and made a face. &quot; mushy and stuff. Go on and get out of \nhere. You two make me ill with all that  Oh, I love you stuff.&quot;  She \nturned her back to them and went on scanning the area. \n\n\n::KitKat2::\nShe smirked at DarkMouse. &quot;You know, for all the energon on this \nplanet, I&#39;d love to know how you seem to know so much about what goes \non inside a base.&quot;\n\nDarkMouse::\nShe turned to KitKat2 and frowned. &quot;Well, I&#39;m a rodent. I have ears \nyou know. Big ones. Now go and have fun you guys.&quot;  She stood up and \nheaded for the door. &quot;Ick, lovey dovey stuff. I need some air.&quot;  She \nleft the station and headed to the hatch.  She walked outside, but \nonly a few feet from the door.  She looked up at the sky. &quot;Eh, some \nbots have all the luck in life.&quot; \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Err...
