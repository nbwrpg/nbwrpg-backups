Fenox was also Vice-Admiral, and he was liked just=\r\n as much, if not more.\n\n       Fenox stood beside Astral, looking out.\n\n   =\r\n     &quot;Yes.....We&#39;ll be there........We better be prepared for any enemies t=\r\nhat may be on the planet.\n\n        Astral turned to Starlight, who was at t=\r\nhe computer consoles.\n\n       &quot;Starlight, check the planet for any warfare =\r\ngoing on,&quot; He said.\n\n        Starlight nodded, &quot;Yes, admiral, at your servi=\r\nce,&quot; She said, and started pressing buttons rapidly.\n\n        Starlight loo=\r\nked at the admiral shamely, &quot;Unfortunately, yes.....There is much warfare g=\r\noing on between many factions.  Right now, the three main factions are know=\r\nn as the Maximals, Predacons and the Alliance.  It looks like we won&#39;t be a=\r\nble to finish this experiment without getting a few scratches.&quot;\n\n          =\r\nFenox sighed.\n\n       &quot;Let&#39;s just hope everybody survives,&quot; He said.\n\n     =\r\nAstral nodded at Starlight, and then continued looking at Earth.\n\n       &quot;Y=\r\nes, Fenox, let&#39;s hope that everybody does survive,&quot; He said.\n\n       Then, =\r\nAstral made tight fists with his hand.\n\n       &quot;We may even have to........=\r\n.Get Recklessa to do her job,&quot; He said, with fear and anger in his voice.\n\n=\r\n     Meanwhile Griplash was in his lab, looking at some DNA specimens from =\r\nthe Earth&#39;s early animals.\n\n        And then, at the back of the big ship, =\r\nwas Recklessa, the Lavacons most fearsome warrior.  She was the mass destro=\r\nyer of the Lavacons, but, she isn&#39;t expecting to have to use her ability on=\r\n this &quot;harmless&quot; experiment.\n\n        A couple hours passed by.  The ship w=\r\nas now entering Earth&#39;s atmosphere.\n\n      Astral sat in his chair at the f=\r\nront of the ship.  Fenox sat in his chair, awaiting their arrival on Earth.=\r\n  Everyone was at the front, in their seats, jumpy about getting on Earth. =\r\n The ship suddenly began to go out of control as a cyclone was heading stra=\r\night towards the ship.\n\n      Astral and Fenox jumped out of their chairs i=\r\nnstantly.\n\n      &quot;Shit!!!  Starlight, stear the ship out of that thing&#39;s pa=\r\nth!!!!&quot; Astral screamed.\n\n     &quot;Yes sir!!!  Come on stupid thing!!!!  Go, g=\r\no, goooo!!!!!&quot; Starlight said, pounding everything in front of her.  Sudden=\r\nly, she went and turned the ship right off course of the cyclone&#39;s path.\n\n =\r\n     The emergency alarm went off.  The ship was going down!!!!  Down!!!!!!=\r\n\n\n     Astral yelled at Starlight, &quot;Get this thing back up!!!!!  Now!!!!&quot; H=\r\ne said.\n\n       It was too late.  \n\n     The ship was far away from the cyc=\r\nlone, but was now ready to impact on the ground.  \n\n     The ship hit it, a=\r\nnd went skidding forward, and then flipped twice.  The ship hit a gigantic =\r\nboulder, and then the nose of the ship was scrunched up.\n\n       Everyone w=\r\nas flung all over the place during the crash, Fenox was shot straight out a=\r\nnd was laying on the ground.  Starlight lay with her face on a control boar=\r\nd.  Astral was thrown against Griplash, who was squished in between two com=\r\nputer consoles.  Recklessa was also shot out, and was......Buried in coconu=\r\nts????  Hmmm......Palm trees????  Sunny weather???  Ah, yessss.........This=\r\n was.........The Bahamas!!!!  \n\n         Fenox woke up, along with Reckless=\r\na and Griplash.\n\n      &quot;Oh man....I don&#39;t feel so........Oh man,&quot; He said, =\r\nstruggling to move his aching body.\n\n      Recklessa grabbed a coconut and =\r\ncrushed it in her hand.\n\n      &quot;Talk about headaches,&quot; She said, rubbing he=\r\nr poor, coconut bashed head.\n\n       Griplash picked up Astral, and brought=\r\n him outside.\n\n      &quot;You two alright??  Where are we anyway??&quot; He said, si=\r\ntting Astral down and rubbing his shoulder.\n\n          Fenox layed down on =\r\nthe ground, and said, &quot;I think we&#39;re in the Bahamas.  Oh man, my whole body=\r\n aches like hell!!&quot;\n\n        Recklessa sat down beside Fenox.\n\n       &quot;My h=\r\nead feels like a pillow that&#39;s just been stuffed with a big rock,&quot; She said=\r\n, leaning over on Fenox.\n\n      Fenox edged away from Recklessa, and then h=\r\ne got up.\n\n      &quot;Hey, how&#39;s Astral?  We better check him out,&quot; He said, ru=\r\nnning over to Astral.\n\n     Recklessa grumbled, and walked over to Astral.\n=\r\n\n     Griplash got up, and went over to Astral.\n\n       &quot;Hey, Admiral, you =\r\nfunctioning???  Yoohoo, Admiral??&quot; He said, waving his hand back and forth.=\r\n\n\n     Fenox bent down by Astral, &quot;Come on Astral, speak, speak!!&quot; He said,=\r\n crossing his fingers.\n\n       Astral slowly opened his eyes, and saw Gripl=\r\nash, Fenox and Recklessa.\n\n     &quot;I&#39;m alive!!!!  Good!!!  Excellent!!!  Fant=\r\nastic!!!  Fantabulous!!!!&quot; He said, standing up and brushing himself off.\n\n=\r\n      &quot;Ah, looks like we crashed in the Bahamas,&quot; He said, looking at the s=\r\nurrounding.\n\n        Everyone went and sat down by some trees, and talked. =\r\n \n\n     Then, Griplash brought up, &quot;Hey......Something&#39;s not right......We&#39;=\r\nre still missing something......&quot; He said.\n\n      Suddenly, everybody shout=\r\ned, &quot;Starlight!!!!!!!!!!  We forgot all about her!!!!!!&quot; And then, they all=\r\n ran back into the ship.  \n\n      They took out Starlight, and brought her =\r\nby the clearing of trees. \n\n       They let her rest, hoping she was still =\r\nonline.\n\n    30 minutes passed, and Starlight finally recovered from the cr=\r\nash.\n\n      &quot;Did we make it??  Did everyone make it??&quot; Was all she was able=\r\n to get out in a low mutter.\n\n       Astral helped him up and patted her on=\r\n the shoulder.\n\n      &quot;Yep, we all made it.......But, unfortunately, we don=\r\n&#39;t have a base.  We&#39;ll have to survive in the wilderness....Of the Bahamas!=\r\n!!  Yes!!!!  We&#39;re stranded, but we&#39;re stranded on the Bahamas!!!!!  What a=\r\n great place to be stranded eh??&quot; He said, smiling.\n\n    Starlight sat down=\r\n.\n\n    &quot;Ya, that&#39;s so great, I forgot to yell yippee,&quot; She said, groaning.\n=\r\n\n      They all sat down for a few hours, and then decided to get on with t=\r\nhe experiment.\n\n          Griplash frowned.\n\n       &quot;This is just great, th=\r\ne crash destroyed the DNA specimens.  Luckily, we brought our own DNA scann=\r\ners just in case,&quot; He said.\n\n        They all scattered off in search of a =\r\nbeast mode.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(I&#39;m gonna do this =\r\nindividually)\n\n::Astral::\n\n      Astral was now 1 mile away from the place =\r\nwhere everyone was going to meet back up.  He scoured the area, but found n=\r\nothing.  He continued walking peacefully, enjoying the sun, until he trippe=\r\nd on something.  He got back up, and saw the thing, it was, some kind of bo=\r\nne.  He began digging it up, and there it was, the remains of a dinosaur bi=\r\nrd.\n\n      Astral got out his DNA scanner thingy, and then began his stuff.=\r\n\n\n        &quot;Hmmm......A Pterodactyl.........Yes..........I wonder what this =\r\nwill look like?&quot; He said, and took the beast mode of a Pterodactyl, with a =\r\nfew.....Hot differences.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Feno=\r\nx::\n\n        Fenox kept going south.  After a while, he saw a dead animal..=\r\n.......A panther.......Hmmm, this might suit him.\n\n          &quot;Wait till tho=\r\nse guys see me, I&#39;ll show them who&#39;s really a cool cat!!!!!  Make that, bur=\r\nning cat!!!&quot; He said, and took the beast mode.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Starlight::\n\n      Starlight was having tons of luck find=\r\ning animals for beast modes, but she just couldn&#39;t find the right one.  She=\r\n kept walking along and eventually decided to take a rest.  While she dozed=\r\n off, a wasp came and landed on her hand.  She dropped the DNA scanner thin=\r\ngy, and it activated itself, and took the form of a wasp as a beast mode, e=\r\nxcept fiery.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Griplash::\n\n    =\r\n    Griplash strolled along through a shady area.  As he was walking, a sna=\r\nke came slithering up his leg.\n\n     Griplash picked it up, &quot;Hey there litt=\r\nle buddy, how&#39;s it going?&quot; He said, nicely.\n\n     Griplash sat, holding the=\r\n snake, and talking to it about the crash and all.  Then, Griplash finally =\r\ncame to the conclusion that he liked snakes.\n\n     &quot;You know little buddy, =\r\nI think I&#39;ll make you my beast mode, &quot; He said and used the DNA scanner thi=\r\nngy.  Now, Griplash was a Lava snake.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=\r\n~~~~~~\n::Recklessa::\n\n       Recklessa didn&#39;t like this at all.  There was =\r\nno animals on this place!!!!!  She decided to do a little fancy work.  She =\r\ntook off with her thrusters and went at full speed.  She saw a group of big=\r\n, strong animals.  She saw that they were elephants.  Strength, they had.  =\r\nSpeed, that was a whole different story.  She liked it.  She used the DNA s=\r\ncanner and took the beast mode of an elephant and turned it into a big, wal=\r\nking fireball.  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Back At The G=\r\nrove)\n\n        Astral was the first to arrive back at the meeting place.  F=\r\nenox and Griplash came back at nearly the same time.  Starlight was third, =\r\nand Recklessa came back last, since she was the farthest.\n\n      All of the=\r\nm looked at eachother, eager to see one another&#39;s beast modes.\n\n      They =\r\nall formed a circle, and then Griplash spoke, &quot;Ok, fellow Lavacons, on the =\r\ncount of 3, we go beast mode!!&quot; He said.\n\n      &quot;1!&quot;\n\n      &quot;2!&quot;\n\n       &quot;3=\r\n!!!&quot;\n\n   They all yelled together, &quot;Beast mode!!!&quot;\n\n     They all looked at=\r\n each other.  Recklessa was dazzled at Fenox&#39;s beast mode.  They all liked =\r\nFenox&#39;s beast mode, actually.  Astral&#39;s beast mode was astonishing too.  Gr=\r\niplash&#39;s snake beast mode fitted him good, and Starlight&#39;s beast mode was a=\r\nccidental, but still ok.  Recklessa&#39;s beast mode was the real jawdropper.\n\n=\r\n      &quot;What??  An elephant on the Bahamas??!!  Ok, I must be dreaming!&quot; Sta=\r\nrlight said, staring at Recklessa.  They all stared at Recklessa, with puzz=\r\nled looks.\n\n      Recklessa let out a loud warning with her trunk.\n\n      &quot;=\r\nHey, animals are unpredictable these days eh?&quot; She said.\n\n     They were al=\r\nl animals, excpet either made up of fire or lava.  It got dark soon, so the=\r\ny all went to sleep at the spot of trees.  For safety, they had night shift=\r\ns for gaurding.\n\n(OOC: How was THAT for an intro/arrival???  Really folks, =\r\nI have to admit, that was one of the best yet!)\n        \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_000A_01C025B0.579C3260\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html;
