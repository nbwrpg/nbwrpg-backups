He wasn&#39;t going blind after all but the lack=\r\n of light did not bother him in the least.  He settles down with Big Convoy=\r\n, coiling his long tail as a courtesy to his new comrade, hoping not to imp=\r\nose on him at all.  As he lays down, he tucks all four limbs under his body=\r\n and gives a bit of a yawn.  His teeth and saber like fangs glisten in what=\r\n little light there could be  in the chamber.  After a long stretch of his =\r\njaws, Tucson closes his mouth and turns to Big Convoy.\n\n&quot; So much corruptio=\r\nn, greed and deception.  How much of that can any planet endure before it c=\r\nomes to it&#39;s death? Magmatron is to me a murderer from what you told me.  I=\r\n do hope our alliance can finally put an end to his unjust wrath.  And one =\r\nthing is certain, and I hate to admit it, but after seeing what has been do=\r\nne to Rodimus and his own lack of determination to fend off his own demons,=\r\n there isn&#39;t anything I can do to help him.  I tried and I almost succeeded=\r\n but a lot of that depends on Rodimus.  If he wants to fight it he has to d=\r\no that on his own.  But I know now that he chose his path, and I can not ge=\r\nt him out of his own mess.  And a bit of a mess it is.  He wants to work as=\r\n an enemy, then so be it.  He will be treated as one.  Big Convoy, you will=\r\n see a part of me that may appear rather ruthless, but it is only to convey=\r\n an important message.  Those who oppose me pay a painful price, and Rodimu=\r\ns has now opposed me more than a few times.  He will not be spared of his c=\r\nonsequences when we encounter each other.  To me he is THE ENEMY.&quot;\n\nHis opt=\r\nics glow an icy blue as draconic eyes narrow in thought.\n\nPerpetually on th=\r\ne move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Oct 12, 2011, at 12:25 PM, Super Cyclonus =\r\n&lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson salutes Longrack=\r\n, Stampy and Sharpedge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Honored to have you working with me.

But a bit of visual impairment =\r\ndid not scare him,\n&gt; &gt; he was used to it. It&#39;s not long before the room goe=\r\ns black on him once\n&gt; &gt; again. But instead of panic, he straightens up, and=\r\n cocks his ears to the\n&gt; &gt; direction of the cell entrance. Footsteps. They =\r\nwere very far off but he\n&gt; &gt; could hear them with surprising clarity, and f=\r\nor once was happy to have his\n&gt; &gt; sense of hearing returned. Along with tha=\r\nt his sense of touch and taste\n&gt; &gt; were also enhanced as he uses his nostri=\r\nls to feel the rise of temperatures\n&gt; &gt; in the room,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Ah, that was=\r\n part of my problem. I am not used to working with vision,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve lived w=\r\nith blindness most of my life and have learned to adapt.

But now I\n&gt; &gt; unders=\r\ntand, through darkness there is light, even though my eyes were never\n&gt; &gt; m=\r\neant to see it. I can do this, I can fight Rodimus and no matter how well\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; he was trained, one can never see the way a sightless warrior can. He ma=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; be trained but he has never lost his sight.

Magmatron is to me a murderer from=\r\n what you told me. &nbsp;I do hope our alliance can finally put an end to h=\r\nis unjust wrath. &nbsp;And one thing is certain, and I hate to admit it, bu=\r\nt after seeing what has been done to Rodimus and his own lack of determinat=\r\nion to fend off his own demons, there isn&#39;t anything I can do to help him. =\r\n&nbsp;I tried and I almost succeeded but a lot of that depends on Rodimus. =\r\n&nbsp;If he wants to fight it he has to do that on his own. &nbsp;But I kno=\r\nw now that he chose his path, and I can not get him out of his own mess. &n=\r\nbsp;And a bit of a mess it is. &nbsp;He wants to work as an enemy, then so =\r\nbe it. &nbsp;He will be treated as one. &nbsp;Big Convoy, you will see a pa=\r\nrt of me that may appear rather ruthless, but it is only to convey an impor=\r\ntant message. &nbsp;Those who oppose me pay a painful price, and Rodimus ha=\r\ns now opposed me more than a few times. &nbsp;He will not be spared of his =\r\nconsequences when we encounter each other. &nbsp;To me he is THE ENEMY.&quot;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;His optics glow an icy blue as draconic eyes narrow =\r\nin thought.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Oct 12, 2011, at 12:25 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;dis=\r\nplay:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      =\r\n&lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson salutes Longrack, Stampy and S=\r\nharpedge.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Honored to have you working with me.

But instead of panic, he straightens up, and cocks his ear=\r\ns to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; direction of the cell entrance.  Footsteps.  They were ve=\r\nry far off but he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; could hear them with surprising clarity, and for=\r\n once was happy to have his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sense of hearing returned.  Along with=\r\n that his sense of touch and taste&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; were also enhanced as he uses h=\r\nis nostrils to feel the rise of temperatures&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in the room,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ah, that was part of my problem.
