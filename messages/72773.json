He was bent on going through.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We continue on, we take our chances through the portal.  Something tells me\n&gt; it&#39;s the way to go.  All right, this is it, all or nothing.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With another powerful roar, he charges onward, this time, slowly extending\n&gt; his wings, feeling that the need for flight would come soon enough.  He\n&gt; could feel his limbs comming off the ground, as he extends his talons to Big\n&gt; Convoy and the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Those of you who can get on my back, do so now, Big Convoy, grab onto my\n&gt; talons, and hold on as tight as you can.  I sense I may need to take\n&gt; flight..  Something is driving me to fly.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs BIG CONVOY was nearly the same size as TUSCON, only a few inches of\nhieght and a few pounds of weight seperated the two, there was no way\nfor TUSCON to carry him. However BREAK and MACH KICK climb on TUSCON&#39;s\nback, thier combined wieght nearly half of his if not more. Even with\nthose two it could make for a rough flight of he had to fly.\n\nCONVOY nodded, &quot;Go through now! I will do what I have to do once I get\non the other side.&quot;\n\nKeying his radio spoke into it. &quot;We&#39;re going through the portal.&quot; He\nsaid to LONG RACK. &quot;I don&#39;t know how much communication we will have\non the other side.&quot; He paused meaningfully, &quot;Get everyone home.&quot;\n\n&quot;But sir . . &quot; LONG RACK responded.\n\n&quot;That is an order!&quot; BIG CONVOY responded evenly.\n\n&quot;Yes sir.&quot; LONG RACK came back. &quot;I read you loud and clear.&quot;\n\nTurning back to TUSCON if he was still in the room he made shooing\nmotions as all around them the sounds of many booted feet could be\nheard running down the halls. It would only be a matter of moments\nbefore they were over run.\n\nPulling out several grenades BIG CONOY looked around the room, &quot;Before\nwe go we&#39;re going to leave them a little gift!&quot;\n\nLetting the safety clips detatch he smiled as he saw the pins hit the\nfloor. He tossed them near the door, watched them bounce and then dove\nthrough the portal!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
