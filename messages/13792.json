As I&#39;ve said before, I am \nreally proud of everyone. Sure, we&#39;ve had misunderstandings and \nfights, but everyone really knows that it&#39;s all about having fun. We \nwe&#39;re all excited about the get together in the chatroom thing, but \nnow that summer&#39;s over it will be too hard to do. So this is my idea \nnow. We add a bit to the members page. We each e-mail in something \nabout ourselves, what we&#39;ve done here, what we&#39;d like to do and \nanything else you want to say. Pictures would be great. If anyone \nelse has any ideas, please say so.)\n\nVulois\n\nVulois turned to Child, confused at first, but than shocked.\n\n&quot;Child! Did a voice in your head tell you that?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nFliq\n\nFliq heard Ramulus. He looks over his shoulder to find him.\n\n&quot;Oh good! We thought we&#39;d lost you. Come on, Brix is waiting.&quot;\n\nFliq guides Ramulus to the bridge.\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream watched the battle from inside the cave. When the bot that \nwas leading in Megatron&#39;s place returned, he went to her full of rage.\n\n&quot;Thos bots outside made you kill one of our one kind. We should not \nlet them get away with that! Let me lead everything we&#39;ve got out \nthere in a counter attack!!!!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nNoble/Savage\n\nFor years the organic beast had been lurking in the shadows of Past \nEarth, with only vague memories of what happened to him on Cybertron \nBeing in contact with a spark. Having it removed, and letting him use \nhis body freely. Than being encaged by Maximals. It doesn&#39;t remember \nhow it got here though, only that bots are here and they are fighting \neach other. He has been watching the battles. Watching defenses \ncrumble. Now it was his turn. He is too animal-like to make a plan, \nonly wanting to destroy. Now is the time. Bots would pay for \ntormenting him on that starnge metalic planet. The beast Noble, and \nthe monster Savage, would now destroy.\n\nThe Beast started running towards one of the bases.(The Ark)\n\n\n"}}
