Firedrill turned his attention, &quot;What?&quot; He started, but\nCliffjumper reved his engine, and then in two seconds roared out towards\nthe open land at 300mph, tearing up the ground. &quot;Don&#39;t worry kid, i&#39;ll\nbe back&quot; he shouted. Beachcomber turned around and transformed as well.\n&quot;He&#39;s probably just going to blow of some steam, I hope&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;d\nbetter go keep and eye on him&quot; he finished in a cool tone, burning out\nat his highest speed, significantly lower than Cliffjumper&#39;s.\n\nFiredrill looked on, a bit worried. He turned to Sublime. &quot;Ummmmmm, i&#39;m\nnot sure what theyre going to do.&quot; he said.\n\n"}}
