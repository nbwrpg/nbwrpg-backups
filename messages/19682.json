She hoped he \nhadn&#39;t heard what her and Squizzy had been discussing. She stepped \nback and buried the DNA scans from the CR chambers in with the other \ndata they&#39;d collected. &quot;Nail everything down? How am I supposed to do \nmy work if I can&#39;t move it?&quot; she was hoping her snotty pampered \nattitude would keep Zardus&#39; mind away from her tests.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Sorry if this post is quick, I got 3 mins before class.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/WarMachine/Bloodystrike/Reptilica/DevilDuer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Aproaching the lab, Zardus stops as he recieves a transmission, \n&gt; supposedly from a ship. He frowns, looking at his wrist comp and \n&gt; scanning through the reports. That wasn&#39;t right...
