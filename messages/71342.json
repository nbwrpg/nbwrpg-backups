He too, could sense something a miss.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re right =\r\nKup, something is disturbing about Windlord...  It seems that perhaps some =\r\nPredacon programming may have remained there residually..  Hopefully Stanto=\r\nn and Bump will be able to convince him to have another scan done of his lo=\r\ngic circuitry, just to be on the safe side.  No doubt that Hydras has impac=\r\nted us all, especially those who have been infected by that Predacon shell =\r\nprogram.&quot;\n\nHe tightens his fist.\n\n&quot; That is why perhaps it&#39;s wise that I co=\r\nnfront him one on one.  He has not infected me but has struck at Rodimus, W=\r\nindlord and Nightlight.  For their saftey, I take the burden of dealing wit=\r\nh Hydras personally.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot, Uproar, Quickstride, and Rat Trap nea=\r\nrly fall out of their seats with eyes wide with shock. Straight Shot is the=\r\n first to speak up.\n\n&quot;ARE YOU NUTS?!  YOU CAN&#39;T DO THAT HE&#39;LL KILL YOU!&quot;\n\nQ=\r\nuickstride chimes in next.\n\n&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s like whoah, seriously not a very =\r\ngood decision sir..  Very generous but wow, that could really be messy.&quot;\n\nR=\r\nat Trap looks to Tucson.\n\n&quot;Wheels, ya can&#39;t, ya just can&#39;t do that.  You go=\r\nt a great bunch of bots, like ya said, please ya gotta accept help this tim=\r\ne.&quot;\n\nTucson looks to everyone.\n\n&quot; I know you have all expressed concern ove=\r\nr my actions, when it comes to Hydras, and I fully understand why you are s=\r\no concerned.  Hydras needs to be stopped, but I can not expect any of you t=\r\no become vulnerable to his attack, when it is I who should be doing somethi=\r\nng about him personally.  Rodimus, I owe it to you to avenge what he has do=\r\nne to you, Nightlight and Windlord, soley due to the fact that when you nee=\r\nded me years ago, I did not come through for you.  Now, I have to redeem my=\r\nself for that costly mistake, and amend the wrongs which have been set upon=\r\n you.&quot;\n\nUproar looks to Tucson.\n\n&quot; But, that wasn&#39;t your fault.  I read up =\r\non it, you didn&#39;t do anything wrong, you were out there going above and bey=\r\nond the call of duty and you were unexpectedly hit from behind.  There was =\r\nno way you could have avoided what happened to you.  Although, we don&#39;t kno=\r\nw who did it do we?  That wasn&#39;t in the intel I read.  Guys, We can&#39;t let T=\r\nucson face Hydras all alone, it&#39;s way too dangerous.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks =\r\nto Leo Prime and everyone else.\n\n&quot;Leo Prime,everyone, I believe I know how =\r\nta fill in the gaps as to what happened vorns ago.  I was with him during t=\r\nhat battle.  He had finished dealing with some of the heavy hitting battlec=\r\nhargers, when he noticed that Rodimus and the others were getting seriously=\r\n pegged out in battle.  He couldn&#39;t just sit there and watch it happen, and=\r\n he knew that decoy detail wasn&#39;t best suited for his alt form which at the=\r\n time, was more designed for utility and off road driving.  But he couldn&#39;t=\r\n bare to see anyone suffer or be oppressed so he did the unthinkable, and b=\r\neyond his ability specifications, he sped out there to catch the attentions=\r\n of the Seekers, who were concentrating on striking at the Autobot speedste=\r\nrs.  Well, Tucson got their attention and began to draw them away from Rodi=\r\nmus and the others, but then, un be known to him, way out in the distance, =\r\nCyclonus hid himself nicely among cloud cover, and decided to take a pop sh=\r\not at Tucson.  Well, I saw out of the rear view, Cyclonus in the distance, =\r\nand then I saw the shot coming toward us.  After that, Tucson and I were st=\r\nruck, but I was the only one who saw the shot and the perpetrator.  Then, a=\r\nnything after the strike, I really don&#39;t remember.&quot;\n\nNight Shift now hobble=\r\ns into the room slowly.\n\n&quot; I do.  I - was there too.  I could see Cyclonus =\r\nheadn&#39; toward &#39;em, but I was so far off fightn&#39; some of the combaticons, I =\r\ncouldn&#39;t get there fast enough ta swing Tucson or Straight Shot outa the wa=\r\ny.  I was miles behind them  and no matter how loud I beeped my horn ta war=\r\nn &#39;em, they couldn&#39;t hear me.  Then, yeah, I saw that slag ball hit my budd=\r\ny, and there was an explosion that went miles up in the sky.. I thought for=\r\n sure he was a gonner..  I did my best ta get back up, and then got Tucson =\r\nback ta base..  He was off line for a long time, and when he woke up, he th=\r\nought the power went out..  Little did he know he was struck blind by Cyclo=\r\nnus, never ta see the light of day again, or at least until he got a second=\r\n opinion from a medic.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot knew that Talon would also like to s=\r\nee Tucson get his sight back.  She smiles to Talon and puts a hand on hers.=\r\n\n\n&quot; I think Talon said it best, when she said it was time we gave Tucson ba=\r\nck his eyes.  Leo Prime, before anything else, I think it&#39;s time you guys f=\r\nought as a whole, and you really can&#39;t do that unless all of you can see th=\r\ne road ahead of you.  So, if I may do so, I want to request that Tucson Pri=\r\nme undergoes a detailed examination and full repair of his visual impairmen=\r\nt.&quot;\n\nTucson looks to Straight Shot and Talon.\n\n&quot;They&#39;re right.  It&#39;s time I=\r\n stopped procrastinating.  Stanton, Bump, I would like to give you two the =\r\nhonor of undergoing this proceedure.  I&#39;ve seen your work, and I would be h=\r\nonored if you would perform the repairs.&quot;\n\nHe looks to everyone confidently=\r\n.\n\n&quot; We will do this, we will overcome every obsticle they&#39;ve put in front =\r\nof us.  But we must work as a team if we&#39;re to achieve success.&quot; \n\n--- In n=\r\nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Kup looked in sadness how Windlord Stormed out the room and then he loo=\r\nked at Tucson said  =E2=80=9CIt seems that Nighlight is in her old self... =\r\nBut time will tells, this experience have been a tought one...
