The CR tank was \nregenerating the body nicely. It was already 25% complete. She had \nall the DNA scanned into the computer and let the tank do the rest. \nShe had to make a few modifications on the weapons and scanners. The \nones on the old bot were out of date and she simply upgraded the bot \nto modern standards. \n\nWhile the Beholder clone was in the tank, she went to work on the \nFeline clone. She had to reassemble it somewhat and check the back up \nmemory diskes. Both bots had thier old memories intact and she could \ndownload them into the clones once they were complete. This would \ngive the clones thier old personality and habits. They would also \nrecognize thier old comrads and such. This would make things easier \ninstead of programing them as new bots entirely. \n\nShe finished with Feline&#39;s DNA and hooked up another CR tank. She \nthen ran the programs and started to generate the Feline clone.\nShe smiled and felt rather sure of her work. She had cloned bots \nbefore, but from living specimens, not the remains of a bot. But it \nstill involved the same stuff, so she felt confident that her work \nwould turn out just right. \n\n\n"}}
