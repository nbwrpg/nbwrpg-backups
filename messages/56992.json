ONLY if the \nothers back off! I don&#39;t want this place destroyed as much as you!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; With this she made her way, leaping, down to the ground then \nwaltzing up towards Kup. Her optics caught sight of Convoy as well. \nThis intregued her.. she hadn&#39;t seen this one before. Then her \ncrimson optics glared at Empath. Empath was making another wrong \nimpression with her. \n&gt; \n&gt; She then turned her optics on Kup as she stepped up to him. &quot;I \ndon&#39;t wish to do anything with the inhabitants inside. I&#39;m merely \nprotecting them.&quot; Pausing. &quot;Even though as much as I loathe your \nAutobot companions in stasis, my intentions are true & pure. I only \nwant those inside to remain untouched.. & unharmed.&quot; Another \npause. &quot;I&#39;ll be willing to give my life for them. I&#39;m placing my very \nexistance on the line here, Kup. If Rodimus still sees a problem with \nthat, then he can come to face me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;As to the others here, I believe that the Ark should have no \ninhabitants, but I will regularly return here. I have the Ark & \nTeletran 1 wired to notify me of intruders as well as Defenses armed \n& ready when anyone other than I are nearby. Hence, why you were \nfired upon. If you don&#39;t like that... then... the Ark can suffer in \nthe future.&quot; Her voice so serious. However, she was SO bound & \ndetermined to have this her way. There was one reason as to why. & he \nwas inside the Ark. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her crimson optics gazed at Kup, awaiting his response. \n&gt; Yahoo!
