He\ncounldn&#39;t believe this (wait until my next char shows\nup Hugars approved and you better start praying I\ndon&#39;t target you with him I just have to deside on a\nfew last minute details before he shows up). He still\ndoubted his &quot;destiny was fulfilled, so he might still\nhave some &quot;devine&quot; protection, but this was just\nhumiliating.\n\n--- Legendarynemasis@... wrote:\n&gt; Actually I didnt ignore them. RDahl said he fired on\n&gt; something else after I \n&gt; told him that hellpeon wasnt there. Unless he meant\n&gt; the somethign else being \n&gt; the Infecticon fighting presently(Rdahl can you\n&gt; clear that up for me?). And \n&gt; as for the 8 shots fired at the charachter, I havent\n&gt; posted yet so you cant \n&gt; even say I ignored them.  Besides only one was fired\n&gt; at the chrachter \n&gt; directly. The others were shot around him.\n&gt; \n&gt; IC:\n&gt; As the central shot approached the Infecticon, a\n&gt; thin barrier of chaochitan \n&gt; energy appeared and took the shot, and then\n&gt; immediately dissapeared \n&gt; afterward. The other seven shots all went past the\n&gt; Mysterious infecticon \n&gt; harmlessly. It then quickly opened fire on mutates\n&gt; torso and fired with each \n&gt; micro fusion blaster inside its chest twice, sending\n&gt; a total of twelve fusion \n&gt; blasts at mutate. As this happened the being flew\n&gt; backwards at an incredible \n&gt; speed and picked up Megatron, who was now in gun\n&gt; mode.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nFind a job, post your resume.\nhttp://careers.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
