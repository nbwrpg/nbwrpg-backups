Rat Trap appeared, Tuscon\n&gt; &gt; revived, Darkhawk was k=\r\nnocked down, and for a moment it seemed as if\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon was going to drive=\r\n right over him, but then he swerved, and\n&gt; &gt; after a blast from Rat Trap t=\r\nhat blasted open a section of wall they\n&gt; &gt; took off down.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zarak s=\r\nmiled as he sent a few shots from his energy rifle down after\n&gt; &gt; the fleei=\r\nng Autobot and Maximal!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Quickly he leaped over to where the fallen=\r\n Darkhawk lay as he opened a\n&gt; &gt; communication to Hydras and Perceptor, &quot;Th=\r\ne prisoner has escaped!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Zarak looked back over at the hole that was bl=\r\nown in the door as he\n&gt; &gt; spoke, &quot;There were two of them.

The faster it - pulsates, the \nclosser you - are to finding the =\r\nArk. It was installed on my helmet after I \nbecame visually impaired, so I =\r\ncould find my way back to the Ark after - each \nmission. The beacon reacts =\r\nto the alloys used to build the ship. And only ones \nused by Autobots. &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rat Trap takes the transmitter.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;But withou=\r\nt this you&#39;re a sittn&#39; duck. This is our ears, this is how \nyou navigate.

Now, get - \ngoing.=\r\n You have a lot of ground to cover.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rat Trap nodds, \nwhil=\r\ne Tucson secures the transmitter onto his left ear, while in his rat form. =\r\n\nThe transmitter seems rather large for his ear yet, he carries it \nsuffici=\r\nantly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot; You can count on me Wheels.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nHe=\r\n leaves his disabled friend, and darts out into the hallways in his rat for=\r\nm, \ncautiously moving and freezing in place once in open areas. The transmi=\r\ntter \nblips slowly. He still had a long way to go before he could reach the=\r\n \nArk.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, Preston \nCarroll &lt;supercyclonus@&lt;WBR&gt;&=\r\ngt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; For the \nbriefest of moments Zarak cau=\r\nght a glimpse of the reading on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; his \nscanner, and all he could=\r\n see immediately that what was hidden in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nTuscon&#39;s helm was no=\r\n simple rat, there was too much energy there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; H=\r\nowever the rat quickly transferred energy to Tuscon in the form \nof a&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; fuel dump, and quicker than Zarak would have thought possible \nTusc=\r\non&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was back in action, along with Rat Trap!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; It seemed like it only took seconds! Rat Trap appeared, \nTuscon&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; revived, Darkhawk was knocked down, and for a moment it \nseemed=\r\n as if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tuscon was going to drive right over him, but then he \n=\r\nswerved, and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; after a blast from Rat Trap that blasted open a \n=\r\nsection of wall they&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; took off down.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n \nZarak smiled as he sent a few shots from his energy rifle down after&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; \n&gt; the fleeing Autobot and Maximal!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Quick=\r\nly he \nleaped over to where the fallen Darkhawk lay as he opened a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; \ncommunication to Hydras and Perceptor, &quot;The prisoner has escaped!&quot;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \nZarak looked back over at the hole that was blown in the door a=\r\ns he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nspoke, &quot;There were two of them. One of them was hiding o=\r\nn that Tuscon&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Autobot. He somehow freed him and they&#39;re drivi=\r\nng through the \nbase!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Even as Zarak did quick s=\r\ncan of Darkhawk to \ncheck his vitals, a deep&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; thunk of metal bo=\r\nots hitting thick deck \nplating could be heard from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; behind him=\r\n. A door slid open.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; After ascertaining that Dar=\r\nkhawk would live he stood and \nturned, &quot;Yes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; my old friend, the=\r\n time has come once again.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Taking up the entir=\r\ne frame of the door was the massive figure \nof&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Scorponok, Zara=\r\nk&#39;s second body so to speak. At the moment it \nwas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; headless, g=\r\niving it a strangely ghastly and yet vulnerable \nappearance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; H=\r\nowever that was easily rectified as Zarak leaped into \nthe air and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; with the tel-tale sounds of gears grinding he shifted \ninto a head, on=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that slipped perfectly between Scorponok&#39;s \nshoulders and cl=\r\nicked.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In his own form Zarak was \nshort, even di=\r\nminutive, but now joined once&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; again with Scorponok he \nwas ful=\r\nly head and shoulders taller then most&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Maximals and \nPredicons=\r\n! With a Decepticon purple frame and powerfully&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; built \ngreen l=\r\nimbs he radiated aggression and domminance! The cannons&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nmount=\r\ned on his shoulders and the massive claws that he had for hands&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&g=\r\nt; were mute testimony to the true destructive potential that lay at \nhis&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; command.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He transformed into his \nde=\r\nstructive crab mode and took off after Rat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Trap and \nTuscon!&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; OOC: I think that Cyclonus and Scourge and \nthe r=\r\nest are somewhat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; separate from all this for them not to be \nin=\r\nvolved, so I will post for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; them in a different letter.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (Zarak-Scorponok)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0039_01CAB4E8.3BF980E0--\r\n\n"}}
