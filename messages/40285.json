Well its a hologram \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; I cant reveal who it is yet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And upon those words the room went dark again and then features \n&gt; &gt; reappeared, this time it looked like the room Blacknightmare was \nin \n&gt; &gt; first with the same pedestal that the orb came up off of. Slowly \n&gt; &gt; three other orbs flew all around Blacknightmare and scanned every \n&gt; bit \n&gt; &gt; of info about her and everything that has been done before they \n&gt; &gt; dissapeared into the pedestal. Slowly three chambers in the floor \n&gt; &gt; opened and then three holograms appeared over them, disturbingly \n&gt; &gt; lifelike. The first Hellpeon, the second Orchestra, the third \n&gt; showing \n&gt; &gt; a much larger robot. The Hellpeon hologram walks up to \n&gt; Blacknightmare \n&gt; &gt; and stares down at her as it laughs evily.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hellpeon: &quot;Predacon trash, what makes you think your so smart? \nYou \n&gt; &gt; will be destroyed by the Bamphomet and then devoured. I should \nnot \n&gt; &gt; even waste my time with you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Holo-Hellpeon walks on back over to where he appeared and stands \n&gt; &gt; there. Next, the Orchestra Hologram walked over to Blacknightmare \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; placed a hand on her face.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Holo-Orchestra: &quot;Come my love, The Alliance has been destroyed \n&gt; &gt; completely let us go and salvage all their technology and use it \nto \n&gt; &gt; defeat our enemies. Then we can live together in peace..&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Orchestra Hologram then stepped away back to his place. \nFinally \n&gt; &gt; the third unknown Hologram steps up to Blacknightmare.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ????: &quot;Come with me child and together we shall take over the \n&gt; &gt; Universe! All shall fall before my will for I am the god of all \n&gt; &gt; Infecticons. IF you defy me then death shall be your fate.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The third being then walks back over to where it appeared over \nand \n&gt; &gt; Misfire floated over to Blacknightmare.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Misfire: &quot;You must choose one of those three selections and then \n&gt; &gt; descend into the chamber beneath the one you choose. Once you \nhave \n&gt; &gt; selected your choice you will go to the next level. Where you go \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; what happens to you depends on your choice.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With that said Misfire descneds into the pedestal over the ground \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; then dissapears with it as it descends.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blacknightmare:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The femme said &quot;The Bamphomet&quot;\n\n\n"}}
