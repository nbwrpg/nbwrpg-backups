When they were done he&#39;d have a few words of \nencouragement for them.\n\nOOC: Logo in the future try not to take things so personally, if \nsomethings said to one of the characters, then have the character \nhandle it. (IE BA called DM a slut then make BA appologize (Unlikely \nif JP sticks to form) or start a grudge match btw the two.)\nAnd Soulstice, don&#39;t try so hard to defend yourself, even if you have \nsomething to defend yourself against. Whatever it is will pass faster \nif you keep little side comments quiet. (IE you used three posts to \nfight what Logo said just so Logo could find the post and show you \notherwise.) I don&#39;t mean to single you out,  same goes to everyone \nplaying. If they (I) can&#39;t take a little ribbing from another \ncharacter then he/she/I shouldn&#39;t be playing. If we don&#39;t like whats \nsaid about one of our characters then there are other characters in \nthe game to take those frustrations out on this is a war and we \ncontrol this war. now lets stop blowing up at each other and get back \nto blowing up each others bots. I said my two cents, anyone else \ndoesn&#39;t like it I got two characters to take it out on.\n\n\n  --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Well, actually, you just have to make sure you attach it and it \nstill is\n&gt; able to be moved.&quot; Land Mine said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Would you like me to do it, KitKat?&quot; Land Mine asked...\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, August 06, 2000 9:25 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: NBW\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She looked at Land Mine . &quot;I can use all the help I can get.
