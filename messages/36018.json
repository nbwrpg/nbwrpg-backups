It is on this moon that the Infecticons, the race that \nhave invaded the Cybertronian galaxy in the Vile Force&#39;s future, that the \nInfecticon&#39;s evil master reigns. All around and even below their master \nlurks, few Infecticons ever visiting the moon. In orbit around the moon is a \nmother ship for the Infecticons having their second in command and a group of \nhigh ranking Infecticon council members sit at a table with a 3D Hologram of \nthe moon hovering above the table. each of the Infecticons are shrouded in \ndark cloaks, the room also dark with no lights except for the glows of the \nfaces of the Infecticons, who are not robots... but are actually beings made \nof energy. Soon the second in command of the Infecticon army stands in front \nof the council members and the 3D image of the moon.\n\nDiablos: &quot;I shall call this meeting to order now.... During our invasion of \nthe Cybertronian solar system we intercepted a transmission from one of the \nspace stations to a location yet unknown. In the transmission one of the life \nforms ordered a secret base to prepare its transwarp warpgate to send a group \nof their men back in time to the past to prevent this future.&quot;\n\nAll members of the council grumble and growl as one of them slams their fist \ninto the table.\n\nDemonite: &quot;We can&#39;t allow them to alter our future. Cybertron will be ours as \nit was destined to be!&quot;\n\nJust then the room and the entire ship shakes as the moon the ship is \norbiting rotates to what appears a massive crack in the moons surface, soon \nafterwards the crack opens a bit spilling a massive red light onto the \nInfecticon mothership. Inside the Mothership itself all Infecticon troops and \ncivilians stop as do the people on the Infecticon planet as they look up at \nthe massive red light. Soon all of them listen to the words of their master, \nwhich is actually the moon itself.\n\nThe Bamphomet(the moon): &quot;Eons ago... when the great war broke out between \nthe Autobots and Decepticons... A large group of Autobots and Decepticons \nleft the world on a ship to avoid the conflict... They did not wish to \npartake in the fighting and set off to find a world at peace. They visited \ncountless worlds, each war torn and showed no signs of ending their wars. \nFinally they arrived here.. at system void... It is here that they found the \npeace they sought... a world whose bueaty rivaled that of a thousand jungle \nworlds... The system unknown to them at that time was also filled with a \nsepcial energy that was being emitted from a dimension other then the pit... \nor the Matrix... the power enfused with their sparks and soon changed it to \nthat of the new energy. The power made them stronger, Faster, smarter then \nthey thought possible. When they discoveded this they realized that this \ndiscovery would lead to a war between themselves out of greed... out of \nfear... and out of hate... and thus the Autobots and Decepticons sacrificed \nthemselves... mind... body... spark... and merged with each other into one \nsingle concious being... in doing this... they created a direct portal to the \ndimension from which they drew their power from and with it they created a \nrace of beings to help the new being in their quest to bring peace to the \nUniverse... that being that was created was I. The beings that I created were \nyou... and for Eons you have been my instruments of peace... and that peace \nshall come by destroying all weapons that cause war... Which is sentience \nitself... Only when all sentience has been rid of the universe can the peace \nwe strive for be achieved... We have already eliminated countless races and \nhave assimilated them into myself... including their worlds... mind... body.. \nand spark... these Cybertronians in our present seem to be bent on resisting \nus... therefore, like them... we shall send our own men to the past and \neliminate their men... and all other Maximal and Predacons on the planet. Our \ntime must not be altered. If it is it may compromise our mission. Begin \nconstruction of a home for the team of men that I shall create... Begin your \nwork now and don&#39;t dwell on individual thoughts any longer... we must not \nstray from out path of peace. Go... now... and prepare...&quot;\n\nWith that the crack in the moon closes and it rotates away from the ship and \nthe planet.
