Veratis looked on startled, it was \nno wonder she fealt cramped, instead of the proportions of a \nhalfbreed polar bear/ owl, she was now the size of a full grown polar \nbear. &quot;My dear, I don&#39;t think Shadow Wing is appropriate anymore.&quot; \nHis mind went blank, he didn&#39;t know what to make of her new form all \nhe could see is what could now be possible.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She had fallen asleep in the chamber. She woke up and jerked around \n&gt; as her new form became fully awake. She hit the chamber door with \nher \n&gt; huge paw. The sound echoed in the chamber and was almost deffening. \n&gt; She thought about how to get out.  She didn&#39;t have hands anymore, \n&gt; they were huge paws with gigantic claws. She thought about how to \nget \n&gt; out.  She heard Veratis thoughts, Till all are one. She thought out \n&gt; to him,&quot;Can I get out of here, it&#39;s cramped.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine reached the transport pod and transformed to his half \n&gt; wolf \n&gt; &gt; state, he tried to operate the controls but unfortunately his \nlarge \n&gt; &gt; claws were to awkward to set the coordinates. He knew he was out \nof \n&gt; &gt; options, if he turned to robot mode he&#39;d collapse into stasis \nlock \n&gt; do \n&gt; &gt; to the shot he&#39;d taken in the gut. There were no options open to \n&gt; him \n&gt; &gt; except take a chance on auto pilot. &quot;Computer return me to \nVeratis&#39; \n&gt; &gt; position.&quot; The computer came to life and carried him skyward. the \n&gt; &gt; only drawback to using the computer was that the coordinates \nwould \n&gt; &gt; automatically be relayed through the maximal network including \nthe \n&gt; &gt; one on the CF. Lunarpines wounds were still healing, to bad they \n&gt; &gt; weren&#39;t healing faster. He really wanted to find the trainers \nbase \n&gt; &gt; and put an end to them. He opened his comm to Ramulus &quot;If theres \na \n&gt; &gt; tracker available you might want to send it into the mountains to \n&gt; &gt; track Slayer.&quot; he caught his breath. &quot;Slayer left a trail of mech \n&gt; &gt; fluid long enough for a blindbot to follow, I&#39;m going offline for \na \n&gt; &gt; bit, My destination&#39;s in the computer, I&#39;ll be back when I can.&quot; \nHe \n&gt; &gt; signed off and sat in the control seat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile Veratis watched the screen to see what the virus was \n&gt; doing \n&gt; &gt; to Shadow Wings body. he&#39;d taken away most of the signs that she \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; a translifeform. It was as if he&#39;d created a new breed of \n&gt; translife. \n&gt; &gt; the way the matrix had intended. He smiled a sly grin and held \nback \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; sinister laugh. The words came to him again, &quot;Till all are one&quot; \nHe \n&gt; &gt; stepped back, suddenly seeing what exactly the words meant, \n&gt; Translife \n&gt; &gt; and nature would become one and this freak before him was the \n&gt; &gt; beginning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers curled up in the corner of his forcefield away from \nany \n&gt; &gt; security cameras. To anyone watching he would appear to have \ngiven \n&gt; up \n&gt; &gt; and curled up in fear. Not this bot though. He&#39;d been through \n&gt; tougher \n&gt; &gt; situations, escaping this one would be a piece of datacake. He \n&gt; slowly \n&gt; &gt; removed his cutting torch from his side and began to use it on \nthe \n&gt; &gt; floor. He&#39;d soon be free to roam, but with the information he&#39;d \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt; uncovered he&#39;d have to escape and report his findings to Veratis \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; the Maximals if they&#39;d listen to him after the stunt he&#39;d pulled \n&gt; back \n&gt; &gt; on the CF. &quot;Theres not a forcefield that can hold me.&quot; he thought \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; his torch cut through the floor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nearby a spider watched curiosly as the foxbot attempted his \n&gt; escape. \n&gt; &gt; The foxbots key to survival was escape, the spider anylized the \n&gt; &gt; possability and knew that it wasn&#39;t right for it&#39;s kind. Long as \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; predacons didn&#39;t know that some spiders were still active they \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt; still survive.\n\n\n"}}
