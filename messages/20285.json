She hadn&#39;t been one to talk \n&gt; about things, but she had already told DevilDuer more than she \nwanted \n&gt; to. She needed to get away from him for a bit and clear her head.\n&gt; \n&gt; She walked down the hall and found the mess hall. She sat down at \nan \n&gt; empty table. She stared at the opposite wall.  She thought about \nhow \n&gt; he mentioned reprogramming. The thought made her shudder. She had \n&gt; been programmed and reprogrammed so many times, she wondered how \nmuch \n&gt; of her really was her and how much was the council&#39;s programs.\n\n\n"}}
