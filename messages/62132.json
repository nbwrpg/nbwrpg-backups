He did not trust him, but of course his memory was somewhat on the fritz, his internal chronometer was still making adjustments and realigning his memory.  Still, he was not going to go rest without not taking precautions.  He went back to the cabin and accessed the computer, and adjusted the security systems.  If someone tried to open a hatch without verbal authorization from him, the security system would alert him via the plug- in that connected him to the ship.  With this in place, he turned back to Blacknightmare with a lope sided smile.\n \n&quot;Sorry about that.  My memory is still adjusting,&quot; he said, resting his chrome like hands on her shoulders.  \n \nIt was then he noticed the &#39;scar&#39; that circled each finger on his left hand.  he always managed to forget it was there, and the story on how he got them.\n \n&quot;Well, I guess we should get some sleep too, it might get busy here if we are not careful,&quot; he said, sitting in his chair and pulling her down to sit in his lap.\n\nAlex Sell &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\nCeleron found his way back to the Engine room, somewhat dissapointed\nthat his plan had not worked.
