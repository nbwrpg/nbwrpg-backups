The sweeps above continue to fly around, their\nprobing beams watching the Maximals and Autobots as they move around.\n\nAnd then Hydras spoke on the radio . . .\n\n&gt; opening his comlink to all Predacons and Decepticons&#39;s channels\n&gt; �EXECUTE THEM ALLL!!!!!�\n\nAs Hydras and Tuscon once again clashed, the Predacons eagerly reopen\nthe violence of the battle, unleashing the full force of their\nfirepower on the Maximals! Explosions rocked the ground as sadly each\nof the Maximals were out numbered, several to one!\n\nOne of Kup�s blasts clips Phobia�s wing, �BLAST YOU!� she screams out\nin pain as her wing tip smoked from the attack. She slowly circled in\nthe air, her flight not quite as graceful as it once was.\n\n�You�re going to pay for that!� The crimson queen of fear said as an\nominous click marked the sound of her autoguns engaging. With a thrust\nof force she began to open fire on Kup sending a rattling train of\nbullets in his direction!\n\nAt the same time Talon attempted to race towards Tuscon, however\nSkyshadow, the leader of the Fuzors stepped in the way, his weapon\ncocked and ready to fire, �Where do you think you�re going?� he said\nas he sneered at Talon, trying to kick and send the Maximal stumbling\nback!\n\nStraight Shot and Nightshift had both shuffled their way over to\nTuscon, but now in addition to facing Hydras, they also faced those\nwith him: Insecticon, Bruticus-X, Iguanus, and also Inferno. In reply\nto Hydras order to execute the Maximals, their optics had brightened\nas they brought their weapons to bear and powered them up.\n\n�This is going to be fun!� Insecticon said as he cackled.\n\n�Quit your yackin� till the job�s done.� Iguanus said as he aimed his\nweapon, and like the rest opened fire!\n\nMeanwhile at the Black tower!\n\nInside the walls the spider like Predacons continued their chase, the\nominous sounds of their metal legs hitting the walls creating a rapid\nfire clicking sound as they pursued Rat Trap and Windlord. Four of\nthem came out of the shadows their bright multifaceted optics seemed\nalmost hungry as they moved.\n\nThe chase took them over pipes and under a bit of duct work, past a\nbulk head and down a long passage way deeper and farther inside the\nwall. As they ran they could see the grillwork of small vents that\ngazed out into other rooms. Interestingly, one of them, as they\napproached it appeared to be lit!\n\nOutside the Ark!\n\nRodimus nodded as they all moved out of sight of the Ark and moved\nover under the cover of several large rocks and trees. As he walked he\ngot a call from Perceptor . . .\n\n&gt; &quot;I have an idea to let our friends escape BlackFortress area... and\n&gt; PErhaps reboot Nightlight, alltough i dont know how much of her\n&gt; former self is retained&quot; said Perceptor to Rodimus in a heavely\n&gt; encripted message&quot;But we have to let Tucson know, what Legacy&#39;s\n&gt; sittuation really is and this has been an unfortunate\n&gt; misunderstanding... He&#39;s loyal to us... so far I watched... &quot;\n\nRodimus nodded as he looked up at Uproar and Quickstride. �It would\nseem that Perceptor has vouched for Legacy. He said he has been loyal\nall this time.�\n\nHe took a moment to glance around, putting Percpeptor on hold for a\nfew moments prepared his plan.\n\n�This mission is going to be dangerous.� He said to Leo, Wing Caliber,\nRamulus, Uproar and Quickstride. As Rodimus spoke, he kept his voice\nvery low, almost as if even here he was not sure if they could be seen\nor over heard. He carefully held up a small device. �But this is what\nI think will get us in.�\n\n�A Spark scrambler?� Ramulus said. �Where did you get that?�\n\nRodimus smiled grimly, �This was the one that Perceptor had given me a\nwhile back. I had almost forgotten that I had it.� He glanced around\nfor a second, and then continued. �I believe I can modify this thing\nto allow us to get past the shield.�\n\nLeo II just looked at Rodimus, not sure what to make of what he was\nsaying, but he was willing to listen.\n\n�What do you mean we can get in with that?� Wing Caliber said,\nobviously mistrustful. �It scrambles spark signatures not force\nfields.�\n\nRodimus nodded grimly, �Yes, but I believe that the shield is still\nset to recognize certain spark signatures, it is just being held in\nover ride mode right now.� Rodimus pulled out one more device, a small\npower converter. �I believe I can disrupt the shield in a small\nlocalized area, to create a doorway that would allow us to enter.�\n\nLeo II�s optics brightened in recognition, �I see. You can play with\nthe shield�s spark recognition parameters.� He smiled ruefully, �It\nwouldn�t bring down the whole shield, but it would allow us to run\nthrough before it closed on us again.�\n\nWing Caliber nodded as well, �You do know the shield will adjust to it\nafter that.�\n\nRodimus nodded, �Yes, but if this works as I plan, it will only have\nto work once.�\n\nWing Caliber and Leo II nodded in agreement.\n\nMeanwhile inside the Ark itself\n\nPerceptor spoke into his radio . . .\n\n&gt; I need confirmation for my next step, I know how to create enough\n&gt; havoc to Let Tucson and to others Scape but I need your permission.&quot;\n\nThere was a short pause, and then Rodimus&#39; voice answered, �Of course\nPerceptor. What�s your plan?�\n\nMeanwhile little Elita, as she wondered through the base picked up a\nbit of noise and the sound of a voice . . . a voice that was definitly\nnot Rodimus, or even anyone that she recognized.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n(TAG)\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
