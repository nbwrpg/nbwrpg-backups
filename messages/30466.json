Just as he was ready to lash out in anger he came\nto the unproven fact that he was Megaton, indestructible leader of the\nPredacons. (In his mind anyway.) He looked back in the direction he&#39;d tossed\nIce, &quot;Do yourself a favor and quit while you&#39;re alive.&quot;\n\nLunarpine used his speed to the best of his ability and raced up Megatons\nback. he raised his claw to strike only to be blown away by a puff from the\ndragons nostrils. &quot;Bad dog, Stay down.&quot;\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 6:58 PM\nSubject: Re: Ice/ New battle\n\n\n&gt; OOC:: thanks being easy on me here.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; She tried to dive out of the way, but the dragon got her by the\n&gt; wing.  She roared out as the teeth peirced the flesh and almost tore\n&gt; the wing from her shoulder.  She still swiped at him.  Then she tried\n&gt; another idea.  She closed her eyes, ignoring the pain, and sent the\n&gt; mental image of the dragon&#39;s scales starting to fall off.  Then the\n&gt; dragon&#39;s skin started to peel away. MEch fluid running fast down his\n&gt; body.  It was a grusome thought, but she tried hard to make the\n&gt; dragon think it was really happening. With luck, he&#39;d gasp in fear\n&gt; and let her go.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Megaton stood tall taking the shot, his thick scales prevented any\n&gt; major\n&gt; &gt; damage. Another shot, then another. The blows fealt like a few\n&gt; punches\n&gt; &gt; instead of claws. The dragon was beginning to feal annoyed by the\n&gt; winged\n&gt; &gt; polar bear swatting at him. Without warning the great beast snapped\n&gt; his head\n&gt; &gt; forward, biting at Ice&#39;s puny body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Prowl::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prowl nods, weapons still ready. &quot;Why did you come to the Maximal\n&gt; &gt; base then?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Dragon watches his playthings attacking as he spoke, &quot;I came to\n&gt; make you\n&gt; &gt; an offer you can&#39;t refuse.&quot; (Sorry couldn&#39;t resist) the mutant was\n&gt; almost\n&gt; &gt; enjoying himself watching the other mutants futile attempts to hurt\n&gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;And as soon as anyone important shows up I&#39;ll make that offer\n&gt; yessssss&quot; His\n&gt; &gt; Megatron side was working it&#39;s way into his logic, this was one\n&gt; thing he&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; tried to avoid. The former Pred leader would have destroyed these\n&gt; bots\n&gt; &gt; before the fight began but that would leave the faction weak.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine saw the futal attempts that Ice was using and transformed\n&gt; to his\n&gt; &gt; half wolf mode. again he hit Megaton with his howl in the back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Megaton was caught off gaurd and forced forward, He remained on his\n&gt; feet and\n&gt; &gt; swung backward at the wolf with his spiked tail.
