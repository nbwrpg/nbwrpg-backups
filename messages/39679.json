Stal=\r\nlex\n  is by far the more\n  talented fighter, but he can not match his fathe=\r\nr in\n  strength and speed, so\n  Mustex continues pushing Stallex back.

I&#39;ve seen =\r\nalot of bots fall from that mistake.\n  Alot of bots wouldn&#39;t\n  have bothere=\r\nd teaching you that. Now back to beast\n  mode.\n  Stallex:Beast Mode!\n  Must=\r\nex:Beast Mode!\n  Stallex:Internal repairs.\n   They begin to run off.

He&#39;s\n  an old friend and he can teach you about stealth.\n  Stallex:What a=\r\nbout you?\n  Mustex:I have a plan to take out the &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, but\n  it&#39;s a =\r\n1 bot job.\n  Stallex:You know how dangerous that is.\n  Mustex:Yes but  it&#39;s=\r\n even harder for 2 bots to\n  infiltrate. I have a shot\n  alone though.\n  St=\r\nallex:O.k., but come back alive. I want to be the\n  one to beat you.\n   The=\r\ny run off on their way to Egypt.\n\n  2.Mustex and Stallex\n  Location:Trainin=\r\ng City,Egypt\n  Status:Preparation\n\n   Mustex and Stallex walk into a room. =\r\nRhesus is\n  sitting at a desk with his\n  back to them. He is leaning over s=\r\nome circuits\n  examining them. Mustex has his\n  hands behind his back and i=\r\ns wearing his poker face.\n  He knows the following\n  conversation will be a=\r\n simple matter of wearing down\n  Rhesus who is completely\n  oblivious to th=\r\nem.\n  Mustex:Rhesus!\n   Rhesus jumps. Mustex walks around in front of him.\n=\r\n  Mustex:Still wasting precious Maximal computer space\n  on your own privat=\r\ne\n  casino my,my,my. Stallex go start training with\n  drones,Rhesus will be=\r\n with\n  you soon.\n   Stallex walks out.\n  Rhesus:Ahh,my good friend. So the=\r\n &quot;Carnitrons&quot; rise\n  again. I can hear the cry\n  &quot;Carnitrons Carnivate&quot;. We=\r\n were the only sensible\n  group. We had a simple\n  motto of &quot;stay alive&quot;.\n =\r\n Mustex:Shutup! If we were so great then why did I lead\n  us to get ambushe=\r\nd by\n  the &quot;Alliance&quot; for our first battle. As I recall 5 of\n  the 7 of us =\r\nwere\n  damaged beyond repair. Now I see that anything except\n  a 2-way war =\r\nleads to\n  extra senseless casulties. That&#39;s why I intend to make\n  everyon=\r\ne pick Maximal\n  or Predicon. All you can think about is revenge on the\n  &quot;=\r\nAlliance&quot;,and the\n  rebirth of a lost cause. All I want is these parts and\n=\r\n  a transport.\n   Mustex hands Rhesus a paper. Rhesus looks upset as he\n  r=\r\neads it.\n  Rhesus:Where am I going to get a D.N.A. simulator.\n  Mustex:You&#39;=\r\nre a bigger fool than I thought if you\n  think I don&#39;t know where\n  Fox Fin=\r\ngers got his.\n  Rhesus:Even so it will take me several weeks, but pay\n  cou=\r\nld speed me up.\n  Mustex:Did I mention I&#39;m planning to take out the\n  &quot;Iron=\r\n Fist&quot; the Alliance\n  will be permantly crippled.\n  Rhesus:Well in that cas=\r\ne just let me step into the\n  next toom to get what you\n  need. So,we can f=\r\ninally get revenge for Croctas,\n  Kangato, Tigecs, Socrow, and\n  my lovely =\r\nMonkessa. I&#39;ve just finished about half a\n  dozen special\n  hover-cycles. T=\r\nhey should do fine for you.\n  Mustex:Oh, and by the way I told my son you&#39;d=\r\n train\n  him.\n  Rhesus:Small price to pay. Does he know about the\n  &quot;Carnit=\r\nrons&quot; yet.\n  Mustex:Not a clue.\n  Rhesus:Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t snich &#39;till yo=\r\nu come to\n  your senses.\n   Rhesus hands Mustex a large box of parts and wa=\r\nlks\n  away to train Stallex.\n\n  3.Mustex\n  Location:Training City,Egypt\n  S=\r\ntatus:Traveling\n  Destination:Alliance Island,Spain\n  ETA:5 hours\n\n  Rhesus=\r\n:Come back alive.

Uh,that is\n  until you get back.\n  Mustex:=\r\nbye\n   Mustex jumps onto his waiting hover-cycle and races\n  off.\n\n  4.Must=\r\nex\n  Location:Alliance Island, Spain\n  Status:Infiltration\n\n   Mustex looks=\r\n at the newly completed drone in front of\n  him. He activates\n  the D.N.A. =\r\nsimulator. The drone takes on his\n  appearance. He is positioned 500\n  yard=\r\ns from the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; so the Alliance won&#39;t risk\n  an attack unless he\n  g=\r\nets closer. He activates another pocket sized drone.\n  It begins its missio=\r\nn\n  to plant a device he had built 100 yards from the\n  base, 40 feet under=\r\n. When\n  his monitor says the drone is done he calls out the\n  code that wi=\r\nll activate\n  the drones programming.\n  Mustex:Beast Mode!\n   Mustex turns =\r\non his jammer and attaches it to his\n  belt. The drone begins\n  transmittin=\r\ng a Maximal  frequency,goes to Beast\n  Mode,and bounds for the base.\n  Must=\r\nex keeps low to the ground so he won&#39;t be spotted.\n  The auto-guns begin\n  =\r\nfiring, but no transformers come out. The horse jumps\n  away from every sho=\r\nt.\n  He stops at 100 yards away.\n  Drone:Mustex Maximize!\n   The drone tran=\r\nsforms and begins firing arrows at the\n  shield of the base. He\n  dodges al=\r\nl the beams,but only has enough power at this\n  kind of level for 15\n  minu=\r\ntes. Fortunately,he doesn&#39;t need that long. The\n  main turrets fireand take=\r\n\n  him out. The shields flicker from power loss,but stay\n  intact. Mustex t=\r\nhen\n  smiles when his monitor shows the pocket sized drone\n  the pocket siz=\r\ned drone\n  has reached the surface. He activates the device and\n  it transm=\r\nites a Maximal\n  frequency. The drone then starts firing. It has enough\n  p=\r\nower for 6 shots. The\n  &quot;Alliance&quot; is beginning to sweat. The main turret\n =\r\n fires again and the shield\n  goes down. Mustex deactivates th device and c=\r\nharges.\n  Mustex:Beast Mode!\n   As he charges he scans the base. The shield=\r\ns will be\n  down for the next hour.\n  It will be down for the next hour. It=\r\n will take him 10\n  minutes to navigate\n  the corridors to his destination =\r\nand 10 minutes to get\n  back. He will go in\n  the  one way they won&#39;t expec=\r\nt,The Front Door, 10\n  yards away he transforms.\n  Mustex:Mustex Maximize!\n=\r\n   Mustex draws a cyber arrow and blows the door open.\n  Using his frequenc=\r\ny\n  jammer as cover he sneaks to his destination. He walks\n  into the Energ=\r\non\n  storage room. The Energon will magnify the explosion\n  of the small ex=\r\nplosive\n  he made. He walks over to a computer console and hooks\n  it up to=\r\n the\n  &quot;Alliance&quot; network. If a remote connection is placed\n  on it it will=\r\n blow from\n  2 connections to the network. It can detect the\n  Energon and =\r\nwill blow if much\n  is removed. It can detect the energon in the room and\n =\r\n will blow if to much is\n  removed. It takes 20 minutes to diffuse and it w=\r\nould\n  be set for 15. There is\n  no deactivation code. The full blast could=\r\n probably\n  not be contained. Even if\n  the explosive is covered an electro=\r\nnic signal will\n  ignite the energon. He set\n  it and ran out.\n\n           =\r\n   CHECK!

So,we can finally get revenge for \n  Croctas,&lt;BR&gt;Kangato, Tigecs,=\r\n Socrow, and&lt;BR&gt;my lovely Monkessa. I&#39;ve just \n  finished about half a&lt;BR&gt;d=\r\nozen special&lt;BR&gt;hover-cycles. They should do fine \n  for you.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Oh,=\r\n and by the way I told my son you&#39;d \n  train&lt;BR&gt;him.&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:Small price =\r\nto pay. Does he know about \n  the&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Carnitrons&quot; yet.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Not a clue=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t \n  snich &#39;till you come to&lt;BR&gt;your senses.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&nbsp;Rhesus hands Mustex a large \n  box of parts and walks&lt;BR&gt;away to t=\r\nrain \n  Stallex.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3.Mustex&lt;BR&gt;Location:Training \n  City,Egypt&lt;BR&gt;Stat=\r\nus:Traveling&lt;BR&gt;Destination:Alliance Island,Spain&lt;BR&gt;ETA:5 \n  hours&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nRhesus:Come back alive. You know I can&#39;t restart \n  the&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Carnitrons&quot; wit=\r\nhout&lt;BR&gt;you.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:You&#39;re not going to resart them \n  with or without&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;me.&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:I&#39;ll take good care of the kid... Uh,that \n  is&lt;BR&gt;until yo=\r\nu get back.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:bye&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Mustex jumps onto his waiting \n  hover-c=\r\nycle and races&lt;BR&gt;off.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4.Mustex&lt;BR&gt;Location:Alliance Island, \n  Spai=\r\nn&lt;BR&gt;Status:Infiltration&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Mustex looks at the newly completed \n=\r\n  drone in front of&lt;BR&gt;him. He activates&lt;BR&gt;the D.N.A. simulator. The drone=\r\n \n  takes on his&lt;BR&gt;appearance. He is positioned 500&lt;BR&gt;yards from the &quot;Iro=\r\nn Fist&quot; \n  so the Alliance won&#39;t risk&lt;BR&gt;an attack unless he&lt;BR&gt;gets closer=\r\n. He activates \n  another pocket sized drone.&lt;BR&gt;It begins its mission&lt;BR&gt;t=\r\no plant a device he \n  had built 100 yards from the&lt;BR&gt;base, 40 feet under.=\r\n When&lt;BR&gt;his monitor says \n  the drone is done he calls out the&lt;BR&gt;code tha=\r\nt will activate&lt;BR&gt;the drones \n  programming.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Beast Mode!&lt;BR&gt;&nbs=\r\np;Mustex turns on his jammer and \n  attaches it to his&lt;BR&gt;belt. The drone b=\r\negins&lt;BR&gt;transmitting a Maximal&nbsp; \n  frequency,goes to Beast&lt;BR&gt;Mode,an=\r\nd bounds for the base.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex keeps low \n  to the ground so he won&#39;t be =\r\nspotted.&lt;BR&gt;The auto-guns begin&lt;BR&gt;firing, but no \n  transformers come out.=\r\n The horse jumps&lt;BR&gt;away from every shot.&lt;BR&gt;He stops at \n  100 yards away.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Drone:Mustex Maximize!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;The drone transforms and \n  begins firi=\r\nng arrows at the&lt;BR&gt;shield of the base. He&lt;BR&gt;dodges all the \n  beams,but o=\r\nnly has enough power at this&lt;BR&gt;kind of level for 15&lt;BR&gt;minutes. \n  Fortuna=\r\ntely,he doesn&#39;t need that long. The&lt;BR&gt;main turrets fireand take&lt;BR&gt;him \n  =\r\nout. The shields flicker from power loss,but stay&lt;BR&gt;intact. Mustex \n  then=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;smiles when his monitor shows the pocket sized drone&lt;BR&gt;the pocket \n  s=\r\nized drone&lt;BR&gt;has reached the surface. He activates the device and&lt;BR&gt;it \n =\r\n transmites a Maximal&lt;BR&gt;frequency. The drone then starts firing. It has \n =\r\n enough&lt;BR&gt;power for 6 shots. The&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Alliance&quot; is beginning to sweat. The =\r\nmain \n  turret&lt;BR&gt;fires again and the shield&lt;BR&gt;goes down. Mustex deactivat=\r\nes th \n  device and charges.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Beast Mode!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;As he charges h=\r\ne scans the \n  base. The shields will be&lt;BR&gt;down for the next hour.&lt;BR&gt;It w=\r\nill be down for \n  the next hour. It will take him 10&lt;BR&gt;minutes to navigat=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;the corridors to \n  his destination and 10 minutes to get&lt;BR&gt;back. He =\r\nwill go in&lt;BR&gt;the&nbsp; one \n  way they won&#39;t expect,The Front Door, 10&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nyards away he \n  transforms.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Mustex Maximize!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Mustex dra=\r\nws a cyber arrow and \n  blows the door open.&lt;BR&gt;Using his frequency&lt;BR&gt;jamm=\r\ner as cover he sneaks to \n  his destination. He walks&lt;BR&gt;into the Energon&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;storage room. The Energon \n  will magnify the explosion&lt;BR&gt;of the small e=\r\nxplosive&lt;BR&gt;he made. He walks over \n  to a computer console and hooks&lt;BR&gt;it=\r\n up to the&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Alliance&quot; network. If a \n  remote connection is placed&lt;BR&gt;on=\r\n it it will blow from&lt;BR&gt;2 connections to the \n  network. It can detect the=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Energon and will blow if much&lt;BR&gt;is removed. It \n  can detect the energ=\r\non in the room and&lt;BR&gt;will blow if to much is&lt;BR&gt;removed. \n  It takes 20 mi=\r\nnutes to diffuse and it would&lt;BR&gt;be set for 15. There is&lt;BR&gt;no \n  deactivat=\r\nion code. The full blast could probably&lt;BR&gt;not be contained. Even \n  if&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nthe explosive is covered an electronic signal will&lt;BR&gt;ignite the \n  energon=\r\n. He set&lt;BR&gt;it and ran \n  out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  CHECK!
