What did the Predacon tyrant have\nanyway, an obsession with him so much that he had to clone him more then\nonce? Was he that good of a warrior that fought at his side that he had to\ngo and create these clones in hope of them gaining his expertise that could\nbe used under his power again? So many more questions ran through his mind\nbut he knew that his time was up and it was basically time to pay the piper,\nhis questions had been answered and now it was time to keep his word and\ndeliver the information that he had promised. But so many questions he was\nstill urging to ask! Like, &quot; What your function under Megatron&#39;s rule,&quot; and\n&quot; What ever possessed you to turn against him to the point of wanting to\nspill his mech fluid?&quot; But these questions would remain unanswered but now\nhe knew the basics of!\n&gt;  the problems and was beginning to form solutions to them but only ones\nCyber Claw could carry out.\n&gt; Dinobot had heard the way that Cyber Claw had told him her name but didn&#39;t\ncare to hear the two words after it, he could tell by that and her posturing\nthat she didn&#39;t think that much of herself and it was a real shame. He saw\nthe way she fought and even though she had his talents cloned into her she\nhad so much of her own potential, she become so much more then a soldier\njust fighting to stay alive and chase after their hate.\n&gt; That thought drew his attention towards the way he, himself, had acted in\nthe past and it shamed him to know for facts that he had acted in the same\nway...but had gotten nothing out of it at all. He had wanted to kill Megatro\nn with such a blind passion that all else was a blur to him this very day,\nhe remembered nothing other then the pure need to rip Megatron limb from\nlimb and watch his spark go towards the place it deserved to go the\nmost...the Pit!\n&gt; But Dinobot just shook his head at Cyber Claw&#39;s words, but remained silent\nabout it...that was the way she thought of herself and she had the right to\ndo so.\n&gt; He listened carefully as to not miss a word of it and was not surprised to\nfind Megatron at the source of it. Him being the main source of his own past\nproblems.\n&gt; Ever inch of her tale made perfect sense and it was one that was that of a\nbot who was running from their past but trying to control it as well...an\nimpossible task.\n&gt; Dinobot uncrossed his arms as he listened to the last of Cyber Claw&#39;s\nexplanation, the puzzled look on his face disappearing to be replaced by\nunderstanding but also accompanied with a bit of common sense.\n&gt; He kept optic contact with Cyber Claw as she finished her story and then\nlooked at him with a cock-eyes expression, asking him the question he had\npromised to answer. His answer was short and sweet, but a feeling that she\nshouldn&#39;t be going off alone was beginning to creep into his exo-structure\nbut he simply pushed it back down like he had his rage before.\n&gt; He nodded but then simply turned around to face the War room and began to\nwalk towards it, Tavatron was probably worried sick that he was beating the\nslag out of the fembot by now.\n&gt; With a twitch of his tail he stopped and looked over his shoulder, looking\nmore at the wall beside him then at Cyber Claw.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Sector 56.1 or 12-C. Either with Hell Beast or stationed at the Predacon\nbase. Good luck.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that he then continued off towards the War room and almost\ndisappearing into the shadows before a second sentence was heard from his\nthroat, more aimed at no bot in particular but loud enough for Cyber Claw to\nhear...intentionally.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Though any bot with half a nano would know not to go into battle without\na planed strategy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
