Rodimus cocked his head as if the answer was obvious, &quot;Because you are\n&gt; stuck down here with us.&quot; Rodimus said as he glanced back up at the\n&gt; top of the hole. &quot;You saw how your boss fired down here a few moments\n&gt; ago.&quot; Rodimus pointed ujp with his free hand to show some of the\n&gt; battle scars the wall had taken. &quot;If he starts firing at us like he\n&gt; did before, then he might bring the whole room in on us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus fixed his gaze on Perceptor as he grips his weapon with both\n&gt; hands again, &quot;and no matter what you think you want to do, if that\n&gt; happens you will be just as dead as we are.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus waited, his weapon still drawn and pointed at Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
