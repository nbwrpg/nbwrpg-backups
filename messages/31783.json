I \nhope you&#39;re considering joining us.  Both of you.  Although it may be a bit \ndull for you Angel Prime.  We don&#39;t get many attacks way out here.  And we \naren&#39;t equipped to attack anyone.  But we could really use the help.  We need \nto get some shields on this base.&quot;\n\n::Obfucious::\n    Still standing outside the base, &quot;Sirs I&#39;ve been thinking about this \nproblem.  I think I can develop a different type of shielding for the base.  \nIt wouldn&#39;t be the best but it might work.  First we&#39;d need typical force \ntype shielding for use against missiles, lasers, etceteras.  Second a type of \nback up shielding.  It wouldn&#39;t affect incoming attacks but it would affect \nthe incoming attackers.  A typical shield system uses a bubble of force to \nstop attacks. But deflecting them takes energy and they can be brought down.  \nI propose focusing energon in such a way that it creates a bubble of an \nenergon field around the base.  This would prevent bots from getting through. \n Unfortunately the instability would mean we couldn&#39;t get out while they&#39;re \nup.  We would have to attack from well within the bubble to prevent stasis \nlock.  Our shots will still be able to pass through the shielding but theirs \nwould not.  And the energon shields would last until the energon power source \nran out.  It wouldn&#39;t last more than a day or two but that would be enough to \nrepair and get back to battle.&quot;\n\n    &quot;Next for weapon systems we&#39;ll need automated turrets.  Mounted in the \nmountain side and around the base.  I&#39;d also like a mine field but that \nwouldn&#39;t be necessary.  Maybe some more primitive traps, like the hole we&#39;re \none step to the right of, or the logs.  They&#39;re primitive but effective.&quot;\n\n    &quot;The shielding I can modify and repair from spare parts in the base but I \ndon&#39;t think I can make turrets from anything in there.  I&#39;ll need at least \none example and some spare parts to build more with.&quot;\n\n::Aerotaur::\n    &quot;I think it&#39;s time we visit the Maximals again Windlord.  They owe us a \nfavor or two.&quot;\n\n"}}
