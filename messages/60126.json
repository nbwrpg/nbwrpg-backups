Malice was obviously \nuncomfortable around her as his body language showed very well. Her \nsystems were re-setting themselves, but it seemed to taking an \neternity for her.  She glanced up at Malice and felt her belly turn \nupside down.  She picked up a small set of tools and started to \nfinish the small touches on thier project. &quot;Uh, by the way, erhm, \nwell, thanks for your help. Back there....I mean.&quot;  She tried to hide \nher face behind the large sphere on the work bench. She wasn&#39;t sure \nwhy some of her circuits were acting as funny as they were. Or wny \nsome of her lanugage skills went haywire a little while ago. She told \nherself she would put herself in a CR chamber when this was done and \nrun a complete diognostic on herself. However, she had to admit, even \nto herself, she thought she was feeling something when she thought, \nsaw or looked at Malice. She looked and found herself staring at the \nsphere as she had gotten lost in thought, She shook her head and \nreturned to work. &quot;Hope this works. I&#39;d hate to battle this bot in \nhand to hand combat.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice nervously chuckled as he released his hold on her waist, and \nsupports her by the shoulders.  He struggled to find an excuse, but \nhis tongue was tied in an amazing series of knots.  He just shut up \nand walked Wolfblade into the lab and to a chair.  He walked to the \nsphere, and turned, still nerivous and trying to sort out the \nprevious moment&#39;s events.\n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s finish this thing, ok?&quot;\n&gt; He looked at his partner, his nerviousness showing well, he was \nwanting a disraction, but, at the same time, felt something else.\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She found herself being held up by a male bot and wasn&#39;t sure what \nto \n&gt; do. She had her hands on his chest as she looked up at him. &quot;Ah, I, \n&gt; uh, erhm, eh, well, this isn&#39;t what I was expecting. Eh, I mean, \nthis \n&gt; isn&#39;t what I wanted. No, No, I mean, I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to, \n&gt; uh...&quot;  She couldn&#39;t believe her predicament. She found herself \n&gt; actually blushing as she couldn&#39;t manage to ingage her audiable \n&gt; functions.

He walked over to Wolfblade and helped her to her \nfeet.  \n&gt; &gt; Although she was recovering, she still had trouble standing.  He \n&gt; &gt; gently held her upright, so he could look her in the optics.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You should take it easy.

She growled but played as thought she couldn&#39;t even move \n&gt; her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; optics if she wanted to. &quot;You know, your good. Your very good. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, you don&#39;t have to rub it in.&quot;  She frowned a bit and \n&gt; &gt; wished \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her body would recover faster. She grumbled, &quot;Great, and if I \nwas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; around when you and your brother were together, who knows if \nI&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; &gt; still be functioning or not. i don&#39;t think I&#39;d survive.

She she waited just a second to \n&gt; run \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; quick internal diognostic. She was about 50 %.  She decided to \n&gt; use \n&gt; &gt; &gt; what she had. She stood up as quickly as possible. She turned \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; leaned on the back of the chair. She kissed Malice on the nose \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then walked/hobbled/limped out towards the mess hall door. &quot;You \n&gt; too \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can learn a few things Oh great Sarcastic One.&quot; as she walked \nout \n&gt; &gt; &gt; into the hallway.  She stopped just outside the door and leaned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; against the wall. &quot;Sheesh, note to self, don&#39;t drink with that \n&gt; bot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; again,&quot; under her breath. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley \n&lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice began to chuckle softly.

You&#39;re just mad I \ncaught \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to you so quickly.

He stood behind Wolfblade, taking her shoulders \nin \n&gt; &gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; big hands and gently tossed her back and forth in between his \n&gt; &gt; hands.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Your a good Maximal or Maxitron or whatever, too bad you \nwere \n&gt; &gt; not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; online when me and my brother came online.
