I see that things \nhave changed in my absence. But, no more worries, things will be put \nto rights.\n     &quot;Which is what I have come here to discuss, All these pathetic, \nweak factions. Where are the Autobots and Decepticons of old? From \nwhat I have learned in the data disks, that I stole, there are many \nsmaller factions here. The NWO? The Tripreds, even the Maximals and \nPredacons; what are all these things?\n     &quot;You two are the leaders of some prominent groups, Rodimus, you \nact as though I taught you nothing,&quot; He walked over to him, and \nplaced his hand on his shoulder, as he had left his gun on a ripped \napart stump. Secretly he had placed a bug on his shoulder, very tiny, \nabout the size of a freckle. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you crushed those that seek \nto rip your faction apart?&quot;\n     He let go and walked to Hydra, &quot;And you, although part of you \nmay have killed me long ago, you have fallen from your vaunted seat. \nYou have had to merge with the new Megatron. Galvatron not enough for \nyou?&quot;\n     Prime held Hydra&#39;s upper arm, and placed a bug on it.\n     Then he turned and walked away, back to where he had begun. &quot;I \nhave crossed galaxies to put things to right here,&quot; He bent down to \ngrab his gun, which he promptly attached to his leg.\n     &quot;You are both free to go,&quot; He said, then smiled at Rodimus, &quot;Oh \nyes, one last thing...You both remember Magnus, right? Well, he gave \nhis life to bring me back, and look at how well his wish was granted!&quot;\n     He transformed into his truck mode and lifted off, flying right \nover Rodimus&#39;s and Hydra&#39;s head.\n\n(OOC: The bugs are simple tracers, they won&#39;t do much more than \nsay &quot;Hey! Rodimus/Hydra is here!&quot; Detected easily enough, with the \nright equipment, which most bases would have. Removal is easy too.)\n\n\n"}}
