Instead, you two are meerly scanning.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks at the two, wondering if they could pull this off. &quot;You \ntwo will \n&gt; arrive at the Maximal base, posing as two Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus looks at Feline, &quot;You shall use your charm, along with some \nhelp from \n&gt; Skulletron&#39;s abilities, to lure the Maximals into giving you two \nquarters. \n&gt; Once inside, you will scan the ship, and use the computers in your \nquarters \n&gt; to find out as much as you can about it, the defences and \neverything.

But don&#39;t overdo it, if they&#39;re \nkilling each \n&gt; other in the halls, you&#39;ll have trouble getting out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus looks at the two bots, &quot;Any questions?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
