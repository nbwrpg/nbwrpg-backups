We both know that my weapon is superior to yours, and that I shall be \nthe victor...while you get a one way tickey to the Pit!&quot;\n\n: But even though her trigger finger was getting edgy, she heard this \nMaximal out. Though, she had to admit...it was boring!\nShe sighed, cocking her gun.:\n\n&quot; I&#39;m TRYING to escape. What&#39;s it look like?!!&quot;\n\n: But then she smiled.:\n\n&quot; And the only reason I used that bomb on that Maximal was because, \nsurprisingly enough, I had no intention on killing him. He saved my life, \nand for that I spared him.&quot;\n\n: BrightBlade eased her grip on her gun.:\n\n&quot; Unlike you...&quot;\n\n: Her voice calm and emotionless as she suddenly shifted her aim towards \nKlants chest-plate and fired, moving to the side so that Klant&#39;s charge \nwouldn&#39;t touch her.:\n\n**********************************\n\n: Rage shifted under the weight of the great tree which had fallen on her, \nthe sudden icy feeling around her skill melting in the afternoon sun to the \npont of movement.\nBut it was still in her mind, she had to get away!\n\nWith a large heave of her great body she mannaged to wriggle out from under \nthe fallen tree, staggering to her feet.\nShe was still wounded and bleeding, in pain and generally cranky. But she \nstill was going to get away if it killed her, which she would try to avoide.\n\nRage growled plaintively as she began to slowly move off into the woods and \naway from the Alliance base, her vision a bit blured and her steps unsure.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
