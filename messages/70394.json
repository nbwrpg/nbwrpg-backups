As Talon got closer he\n&gt; could hear last bit of the conversation Legacy was having with Cheetor\n&gt; via radio. Cheetor was saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t trust those\n&gt; Predacons, they&#39;ve fooled us before.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t trust those Predacons at all!&quot; Ramulus quipped, also over the \n&gt; radio.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You don&#39;t trust anyone Ramulus!&quot; Cheetor said, half jokingly\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You are correct.&quot; Legacy replied via radio, cutting into thier side\n&gt; conversation, &quot;However so far Perceptor has proven loyal in this\n&gt; respect.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheetor sighed, &quot;Okay, I gotcha. Give the bot rope to hang himself with.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson sends out a sonar wave, and quickly finds the hook with his hand, \n&gt;&gt; wrapping around his arms securely. He looks down to the others.\n&gt;&gt; &quot; All right, I have the cable. Can you pull more than just one of us up \n&gt;&gt; at a time? If not, I&#39;ll wait until the others are up there safely.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Talon got to the top he could see Cheetor standing at the top of\n&gt; the pit, with Airhammer in his strange Hammerhead Shark-Hawk beast\n&gt; mode hovering watchfully in the air, he seemed agitated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus was standing at the edge of the pit, the rope that was\n&gt; dangling down had been shot from Ramulus&#39; forearm, and that he was\n&gt; standing braced to pull others to saftety.\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy, on the other hand had not slowed in his flight as he rose\n&gt; higher into the air, taking Rodimus in the direction of the Ark,\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Maybe I could get two or three if I could get some help here.&quot;\n&gt; Ramulus griped as he glanced meaningfully at Talon, Cheetor and\n&gt; Airhammer!\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
