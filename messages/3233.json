Plintissa was hit worse as usual and was getting mighty angry.\nAll of the &quot;Random attacks&quot; were directed toward Suukie, who was doing most\nof the damage. Suukie was knocked back and forth and he shot at the ion\nDisks, knocking one away but the other one of the Ion Disks met his mid\nsection and with a quick slice, and mech fluid leaked all over the battle\nfield as Suukie dropped like a rock. The Radicons were also hit with some\nlasers, and were getting annoyed. Plintissa, Dracona, and the Radicons\nwalked over and grabbed Suukie.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; Plintissa ordered. Suukie squirmed away and stood up looking\nvery insane.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not leaving until the Maximals win and the Preds are crushed!&quot; Suukie\nsaid, his blood still dripping fast, he didn&#39;t make a rhyme. Plintissa\ngrowled and grabbed him.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not going to see you die! Your coming with me!&quot; Plintisssa said,\ndragging Suukie.\n\n&quot;No, I must do this, I love you.&quot; Suukie said back to her without rhymes.\nPlintissa understood.\n\n&quot;Yeah, I know, I love you too, that&#39;s why I&#39;m taking you back!&quot; Plintissa\nsaid. Suukie pulled away.\n\n&quot;If you love me let me destroy the enemies of the Maximals, I promise I&#39;ll\nnever leave you.&quot; Suukie said, sounding very serious. Sinesis and Sinister\njump Suukie within a second, and he fought with them both. Plintissa tried\nto help but Suukie threw her back with one hand. Plintissa understood and\nthe People&#39;s Group stepped baack into hiding. Suukie brawled with them both,\nbut they quickly overtook him and pounded on him with clubs...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, June 12, 2000 10:30 AM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; (Yes, Code, my fault.
