Straight Shot too, looks forward as does Quickstride, \n&gt; who doesn&#39;t keep his eyes off the front windshield.\n&gt;\n&gt; For the most part Tucson Prime had kept his promise to keep everyone safe. \n&gt; He wasn&#39;t about to put his comrades and Perceptor into any more perril. \n&gt; He locks and loads a few blast cannons located on either side of his front \n&gt; cab, just below the head lights, just in case he may have need of them. \n&gt; Quickstride aims outside the passenger&#39;s side window, as Straight Shot \n&gt; gathers back her courage and aims out the driver&#39;s side with her forearm \n&gt; affixed to what ever target was moving in on them.  Yet, knowing that \n&gt; Tucson was in charge, Straight Shot and Quickstride wait for Tucson to say \n&gt; the first words.\n&gt;\n&gt; Steam vents out the hydraulic systems which connect his front cab to his \n&gt; trailer with a loud hiss.  He then pivots his tires to the right, and \n&gt; makes a firm stance in parked position.  His engine idols with a rumbling \n&gt; noise.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We know you&#39;re approaching our location.  You will show and identify \n&gt; yourself immediately.  If you do not comply, I will be forced to terminate \n&gt; you!  You have thirty astro seconds to come forward!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; This was it, Tucson Prime was not fooling around.  More and more his \n&gt; demeanor, and tone of voice resounds more and more like Optimus Prime. His \n&gt; physical features, although silver and black in color, also nearly \n&gt; resemble those of the legendary Autobot leader.  He doesn&#39;t cower, and \n&gt; does not move, letting whoever was out there know, that they weren&#39;t about \n&gt; to scare him off.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor/Talon:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Something mechanical is a proaching... i can sense it... my sensor cant\n&gt;&gt; said what is&quot;said dryly the male.

Meanwhile stones and rocks of varying sizes began to fall. First\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it was grains of sand, then pebbles and then larger and larger pieces.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tuscon continued to push forward, using his great size and agility to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; move around what he could and to bull his way through what he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; For the first few minutes it seemed as if a mountain was going to fall\n&gt;&gt; &gt; on top of Tuscon and those along with him. After they had traveled\n&gt;&gt; &gt; several miles the only trembling got worse and worse, as the walls and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; floor continued to shake and even split in spots.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;CRASH!!!&lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tons of rock fell behind Tuscon, perhaps a mile or so back, falling\n&gt;&gt; &gt; between them and the area where the battle had taken place, making\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that area totally impassable.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; However the area ahead was calm as they trembling stopped. A billowing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cloud of dust came flowing up the tunnel from where the rock had fell,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; but so far nothing dangerous was showing itself.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ahead sensors could not detect any sign of Rodimus, however there was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; also no other breaks or branches breaking off from their path. There\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was only one direction Rodimus and his abductor could have gone -\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight ahead.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The air is in the tunnel was getting decidedly cooler as the group\n&gt;&gt; &gt; traveled, and up ahead Perceptor could catch a slight scent of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; something mechanical. What ever it was out of range of sensors, but it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was up ahead and they were steadily approaching it!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
