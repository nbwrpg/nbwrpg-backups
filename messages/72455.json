Neither him nor Scourge are about, they seem to be\n&gt; doing without.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sighing, and elaborating, &quot;As for what&#39;s up wtih GRIMLOCK, I don&#39;t think any\n&gt; can say or say not.  HE and the rest of his DINOBOTS are about, but no one\n&gt; knows for sure or without.  They seem to be smashing around, driving\n&gt; everyone into the ground.  They say there&#39;s some sort of prison ship, under\n&gt; attack by someone named MAGMATRON and SABERBACK after a clip.  I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; what&#39;s going on, but something is heavily wrong.  GRIMLOCK is after other\n&gt; MAXIMALS, and something pains me to say so, but he seems enraged from the\n&gt; get-go.  Within this area of land, we are cut off and must make a stand.\n&gt; And you are in no way ready to go, so we must say here for now and we both\n&gt; know.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWith a calm expression RODIMUS watched WHEELIE carefully as he talked,\ntaking in the information.
