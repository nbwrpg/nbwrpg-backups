BOYAHH!  Hydras better watch his tail end noww.&quot;\n\nTucson gives Rodimus a firm handshake.\n\n&quot;Glad to have you aboard.  Kup, Windlord, you will be with Rodimus, backing \nup Night Shift, Cheetor and Rat Trap.  They have to access the fortress from \nremote points.  Windlord, if you like you can join him since you know the \nfortress better than we do.  Perceptor, you too, have an excellent recall of \nHydras&#39;s fortress.  Your intel will be most valuable on this mission. \nTherefore, I&#39;d like to team you up with Night Shift, where you&#39;ll be safe \nfrom harm, and assured a speedy getaway if things go awry.  And, it looks \nlike Straight Shot has chosen you Kup, to serve you as a weapon.  She will \nnot let you down, and her arrows are formidable.  It&#39;s not every day she \ntrusts anyone beside me.  I know you&#39;ll wield her well.  You better take \nthis too, Kup, my rerserve arrow holster.  As they get used, it creates \nmore.  You&#39;ll need them.  Arrows will serve you well, because unlike photon \nblasters, they fly silent, and only until they hit their target, does anyone \nknow about them.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot giggles.\n\n&quot;And ya never have ta worry about running out of ammo or juice. Anyway, \nready when you are.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, that&#39;s right, Lord Elder&#39;s correct, I do need a physical uplink in\n&gt; &gt; order ta do the dirty work. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift nodds too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, then physical infiltration it is. I could do with a little spy \n&gt; &gt; work\n&gt; &gt; myself, if I don&#39;t use my skills I&#39;ll lose my touch.

She has faith in you, and so do I. This may prove to be a \n&gt; &gt; challenging\n&gt; &gt; mission but I know you are more than capable of doing it. So, as a \n&gt; &gt; fellow\n&gt; &gt; Prime, will you do me the honor of accepting her request?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus looked at the others as they talked, his optics revealing very\n&gt; little of the inner turmoil that was inside. He was about to go up\n&gt; against the best that had caught him and turned him into a monster.\n&gt;\n&gt; His optics hardened as he nodded, &quot;I will go.&quot; He said with a finality\n&gt; in his words. &quot;Hydras deserves to be paid back for what he did to me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; some steps could be heard and Kup and Windlord appeared in the Room,\n&gt; &gt; Windlord looked with a gloomy expresion, his behavior while he was in\n&gt; &gt; Hdyras&#39;s power ashamed him beyond words.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Is it a mission to pay the favor at Hydras? if that&#39;s the case I&#39;m in&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kup looked him and looked at the group\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus nodded at Kup, a fleeting smile flashed across his face, &quot;I\n&gt; can think of no better friend to have at my back then you.&quot; He said,\n&gt; his face reflecting the thanks he felt.\n&gt;\n&gt; He turned to Windlord, &quot;Are you sure you are ready to go up against\n&gt; Hydras, he has done much to you as well, turned you inside and out. It\n&gt; will not be an easy thing to see him again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
