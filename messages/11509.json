By \nthe way how&#39;d Spears suddenly get stuck with command?\nHopefully someone brought a mechanic into this game.\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; (I don&#39;t know EXACTLY what happened to my other chars, but I am \n&gt; assuming that they brought back the pods with Ramulus to the Ark, \nand \n&gt; are now helping Ramulus, Spears, Wolveritron and everyone else re-\n&gt; pairing the Ark. Is that okay? Good.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Bronco was going through the pods to find things that could e \nuseful \n&gt; when rebuilding The Ark, when Fliq bursted in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yahooooo!!!!!!!! It&#39;s been days and I&#39;m still obsessed with this \nnew \n&gt; beast mode. So watcha doin&#39;?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Working. If you don&#39;t mind, you can help me find useful parts.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Screw that! I&#39;ve got an idea, which will give us all the \nequipement \n&gt; we need! Follow me!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bronco follwed Octociz(Fliq! Gotta remember that now, he thought) \nto \n&gt; his quarters, where he showed him the scamatics for his idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Okay, look. This whole area is covered in debris that came off \nwhen \n&gt; The Ark crashed. Nobody bothered to pick it up because it&#39;s debris. \n&gt; But it&#39;s strong enough to stand the pressures of leaving and \n&gt; enetering atmospheres. So we gather it up. Hold that for a second. \nSo \n&gt; now we take two transport pods, and add extensions, and connectors, \n&gt; until it&#39;s one. Except it&#39;s got more room, can fit two people now, \n&gt; and has twice the engines, which can make it fast enough to reach \nthe \n&gt; atmosphere. Now we take the metal we collected, adn patch it on. \nNow \n&gt; it&#39;s strong enough to handle the burning. Now we can take her too \nthe \n&gt; moon, and collect useful items from the wreckage of our ship. That \n&gt; was so huge, we could bring back stuff that would not only repar \nthe \n&gt; Ark, but make it bigger and better. It&#39;s going to be a bumby ride, \n&gt; because this metal is just barely strong enough by my readings, but \nI \n&gt; think it should work. What do you say?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Great! The stuff up there would make The Ark so strong. Let&#39;s go \n&gt; talk it over with Spears.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The two bots set off to find Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois looked at Windrazor. This bot cannot be for peace?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I will not except that. Go rage war on your own, if you must, but \nI  \n&gt; will not be a part of it. If things get ugly, than I will decide \nhow \n&gt; to handle it. But if you are here to attack The Alliance, than \nleave \n&gt; me, and do not return until you now what matters. What will it be?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
