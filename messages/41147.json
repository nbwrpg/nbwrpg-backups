If you dont know the rules will be glad to supply you with a link in \nthis mail and c/p the rule in which it says you must post for leaving and \narriving in an area.

This \nmeans that you cannot control them, post damage for them, etc.\n\n\n#8 Do not go vast distances in one post. If you&#39;re going from South Africa to \nEurope, post your char leaving, and in about half a day or so, post him/her \narriving.\n\n#9\nThe following weapons are banned. If you wish to bring in new/original \nweapons, get them authorized by the council. You may not have any of the \nfollowing under any condition: \nany sort of seeking missiles \nshockwaves and EMP shots \nflare bombs/flash grenades \nWeaponry that defies shields of bases and ships\n(This one I got hit with but its my fault for not following this rule in the \nfirst place, which reminds me I need to edit some bios...)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWell I hoped this mail helped you dewboy and I hoped it helped the council as \nwell since they don&#39;t need to state the rules a billionth time since I just \ngave you a link to them.
