He felt much better. His sides and chest no \nlonger ached, and he no longer felt lightheaded or tired.\n\nDeathScythe gets to his feet, muttering &quot;DeathScythe, assassinate,&quot; \nand transforming into robot mode. He looks down at himself, looking \nover his hideous form.\n\nHis wolf hind-legs served as his feet, an extra pair of arms coming \nout to serve as his robot arms, leaving two hooves sticking out \nbehind his back. Out of his shoulder stuck several fish fins, the \nother one carrying the shark fin. His whole body was covered by \nrandom patches of different skins, hides, fur, and scales. Out of his \nback stuck his beast mode head, grinning its collection of teeth. His \nwings were folded over his back, providing a cape to hide his beast \nmode head, making it look like a hump on his back.\n\nHe walks out of the bedchamber, looking around for Zyber. He had to \nget some information out of her, about this planet among other \nthings, and then she would no longer be neccessary.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Zyber looked through the blinding snow, but saw nor smelled any \ngame.\n&gt; But then she remembered jusy why she had journeyed all the way to \nthe \n&gt; south...to find game in the first place.\n&gt; She looked left and then right, still seeing nothing other then \npure snow.\n&gt; A sigh escaped her muzzle.
