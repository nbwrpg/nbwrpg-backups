She looked at the body\n&gt;she had stepped on. She looked back at Quickstrike,&quot;I..I stepped on\n&gt;one of them. I...it..&quot;  She looked at him with a frown. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.\n&gt;I&#39;n overly jumpy right now.  Sorry.&quot;  She looked down walked quickly\n&gt;past Quickstrike.  Slightly embarrest at herself.  She wasn&#39;t happy\n&gt;that a warrior like herself was, well, acting silly.  She stood a few\n&gt;feet away in a darker corner, the shakes had returned ad she would\n&gt;have to wait them out for a few moments untill they past.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike jolted and stopped when he heard Dark Mouse squeak in\n&gt;alarm. She\n&gt; &gt; nearly leaped onto his back. She got him in a defensive\n&gt;mood. &quot;Aaah!
