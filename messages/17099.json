She stared at the scanner trying to piece\n&gt; together her mistake. She thought hard for a few moments before the\n&gt; realization hit her. she&#39;d stayed in her half organic mode so the \nscanners\n&gt; picked up her as well as Devilduer. &quot;Well if thats the way you want \nto play\n&gt; this game I can play too.&quot; if the guns were to fire she&#39;d be ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; Battera&#39;s cold greeting caught Lady Hawk off gaurd. a quick relapse \nof the\n&gt; battle helped her a little. &quot;I am Lady Hawk, daughter of Veratis \nand member\n&gt; of the royal family of Avaria. and I find it to be an insult to \nhave your\n&gt; guns facing me.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 04, 2000 7:11 AM\n&gt; Subject: Alliance Base\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Zardus/Dark One/Alliance Base::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Zardus looks from Battera to Dark One, who had just come up to \nhim,\n&gt; carrying\n&gt; &gt; Squizzy.
