She knew she could read and project \n&gt; thoughts. \n&gt; &gt; But she wondered if she could do anything else.  She looked \naround \n&gt; &gt; the lab for a small object. The clipboard near Veratis would \nwork. \n&gt; &gt; She closed her eyes and saw the clipboard in her mind. Then she \n&gt; &gt; openend her eyes and stared at the clipboard. She concentrated \nwith \n&gt; &gt; all her strength. She tried to move the clipboard.  But it didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; move. She tried again. It still didn&#39;t move. She sighed and \n&gt; wondered \n&gt; &gt; if she was trying to pick up something too heavy. She looked at a \n&gt; &gt; sheet of paper on the console. She closed her eyes and envisioned \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; paper in her mind. Then she opened her eyes and looked at the \n&gt; paper.  \n&gt; &gt; She focused her mind and envisioned an invisible hand, reaching \nout \n&gt; &gt; from her mind and grabbing the paper. Then she envisioned the \npaper \n&gt; &gt; being lifted up off the console. The paper giggled a little, then \n&gt; &gt; lifted off the console an inch. She smiled, but in doing so, it \n&gt; broke \n&gt; &gt; her concentratin and the paper fell down onto the console, then \n&gt; slid \n&gt; &gt; off and onto the floor. &quot;Oh darn, almost had it too.&quot; she said \n&gt; loud, \n&gt; &gt; not worrying if Veratis heard her or not.\n\n\n"}}
