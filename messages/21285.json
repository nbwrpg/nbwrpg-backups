So at least she wouldn&#39;t have \nto figure all of this out on her own.\nBesides, she also was sure that Prowl knew a hell of a lot more then she did \nabout all this, and maybe could fill her in on a few things to help her \nunderstand.\n\nBut Iron Raptor watched him nod after she spoke his name, not use to this \nbody and its speaking abilities.\nThough, as she watched him lean closer to her, she suddenly felt...felt that \neverything would be all right.
