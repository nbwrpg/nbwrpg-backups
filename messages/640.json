He&#39;s firing \nat Scourge.)\n\n* Dinobot snarled as he readied himself for Scourge&#39;s reaction to his \nassault, in a way something seemed to be missing.\nHe pondered the thought for a few nano-clicks when the answer came to him, \nTavatron wasn&#39;t there fighting alongside him. He growled and took a step \nforward, it almost seemed to feel like standing out in the open with no \narmor on without Tavatron to back him up.\nDinobot growled, as long as she was in the Ark he wasn&#39;t sure if she was \nalright or not and that fact disturbed him. Why, he had no idea.\nHe growled, Tavatron was the only bot that he trusted to watch his back.\nDinobot shook his head and looked in Scourge&#39;s direction, but this wasn&#39;t \ntime to worry about that now. He was there and fighting for not only his own \nlife but Tavatron&#39;s and everybot else&#39;s as well.\nHe aimed his rifle at Scourge but then targeted Tankoor and fired, a mirage \nof charges headed for the tankbot as well. He couldn&#39;t even bare to think \nabout what the Predacons would do to the bot&#39;s inside if they ever got in, \neven what they would do to Tavatron!\nDinobot growled, they MUST NOT get inside!!!*\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
