Megatron, Tarantulus, HellBeast, had gone \nto Aracnia&#39;s base. She opened her link. &quot;What is going on Megatron? \nDo you need any help?&quot;\n\nShe then checked her long range scanners and found where Destructor \nwas at. She opened her link to him. &quot;Destructor, give me the reason \nto move, and we shall.&quot; She was following her insticts. And they said \nto follow Destructor.\n\nShe looked at Quickstrike. &quot; Get ready, we&#39;re moving ourselves.&quot;\nShe opened her link to DarkMouse, Drillbit, Dollen and \nGoldenEye. &quot;Hey all, we&#39;re moving. Grab your gear and all we might \nneed. We&#39;re out of here. We got something that might be better and \nstand up to the Allience better.&quot;  At this point, she really had no \nidea what she was doing or where they were going, but her faith in \nher team was strong. She smiled, &quot;And Drillbit, I need to talk to \nyou, in private, when you get a moment.&quot;\n\nShe chuckled quietly to herself. She looked again at Quickstrike. She \nput her hand on his shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you again my frined.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
