He recognized the \nvoice from the past.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Can&#39;t say I&#39;m happy to see you functioning. Now out \nof my way you Decepticon b*tch!\n&gt; Maxima&#39;s attack had a very big flaw. Although she managed to slice \na bit of Rodimus&#39; hood, she failed to realize what a sports care \ngoing at speeds over 200mph would do. He simply plowed into her \nwithout careing in the least for the Decepticon femme. This would \nsurely cause some heavy damage to Maxima.\n&gt;  EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:arriving soon enough after Carnation....\n&gt; \n&gt; She landed ready for combat.

The only \nother thing was her tail... it still attached to her, she would not \nuse it... not yet. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her clear blue optics glared at Rodimus. &quot;Well, well.. Rodimus \nPrime. I&#39;m rather surprised to see you... functioning! But.. that \ncan easily be REMEDIED!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She leapt at Rodimus, ready to attack him in a vicious primal \nrage, her claws slashing at him. \n&gt; Yahoo!
