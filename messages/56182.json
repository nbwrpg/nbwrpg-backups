When I sign \non, all I ever see is strings of rapid-fire post exchanges between \ntwo individuals, which generally leaves a few characters miles ahead \nof everyone else in the timeline.  It&#39;s frustrating to find your \ncharacters dropped by the wayside simply because your limited windows \nof Internet time each day don&#39;t coincide with the rest of the group.\n\nIt&#39;s a great RPG on most fronts, but if this trend of forcing folks \nlike me to weed through 20-40 posts a day and desperately try to play \ncatch-up with our characters continues, well, you&#39;re going to be left \nwith one less member.  I simply don&#39;t have the time or the patience \nto keep up with this much longer.  Those responsible for skewing this \nRPG in an annoying, unfair, and unrealistic manner should know who \nthey are.\n\nCouncil members, PLEASE put some sort of cap on the number of posts \nper character each day.  If nothing else, it gives everyone a chance \nto participate without fighting to get a word in edgewise.\n\n\n"}}
