The large male hit the door bell and a voice on the other side responded.\n&quot;Enter Constable.&quot;\nThe door slid opened and the officer stepped in.  The large office contained many decorations and awards the Admiral had accumulated.  In the center of the room was a large desk, and behind it the Admiral sat.  He was looking at some new business from the government that pretained to the fleet.  He tossed the data pad on the pile already on his desk and looked at the Security officer.\n&quot;I see your mission to Oricron Core was a success.&quot; Hyper Convoy said as he stood and walked to the large window behind him.  &quot;I could not expect less from you, could I, Megatron Revived?&quot;\nThe large Neo Decepticon stepped forward, the stylized purple insignia on his chest fully visable.  \n&quot;Yes it was.  That prisoner was quite a hand full for the crew.  But overall he was apprehended without bloodshed or incident.&quot;\nThe Fleet Admiral smiled and turned to Megatron Revived.\n&quot;You have served our government and it&#39;s citizens very well for the past few years.  Our Chief Exectutor, Tyrannis Kaitan, has given you free reign.  You are basically free to do as you choose.&quot;\nHyper Convoy turned to Megatron Revived.  He extended his right hand, which Megatron Revived hearily shook.\n&quot;I hear from your old friend Shockwave, that you brothe and sister are still very much alive.&quot;\n&quot;Yes, the Matrix tells me they live and fight even now, but someplace I cannot go,&quot; Megaton Revived said, his hand over his chest panels.  Inside his armor exterior, a ornate golden Matrix of Leadership resided.  Vector Sigma gave this Matrix to the Decepticon Liege Maximo.  But Maximo made the mistake of leaving it behind.  Now Megatron possesses it, and eventually even the greatLiege will submit to justice.\n \n~*~\n \nWeeks later- Restricted Area MGA-0\n \nWeeks of travelling and bartering and threatening, Megatron Revived was mere meters from the jump point were the Maximals and Predacons jumped to the past and started the Beast Wars.  Also, Rodimus Prime pursued Hydras through this point, and now, he had to go through it.  In his armored gunship mode, Megatron Revived launched a small transwarp core into the Resticted area.  Undernegth of the ship was an engine pod with the barrel of the fusion cannon powered to life.  The transwarp core reached the correct area of spatial instability and Megatron Revived fired his mightuy fusion cannon, detonating the core and opened a rift in space time.  he engines touch off, and the gunship takes off for the rift.\n \n~*~\nPrehistoric Earth\nThe rift emptied over the north pole of the little blue planet.  The white and black gunship sits motionless, observing and getting his bearings.  Unicron was a far distance off, but too close for comfort.  Megatron began scanning for signs of settlement, and found the closest to be the Predacon base.\n/Well, let us harass these so called decendants of the Decepticons.  I have wondered about them so, let&#39;s see if they live up to there reputation. /\nThe ship changed attitude, and began to enter the atmosphere, headed for the Predacon base, to cause Chaos and wreak havok.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
