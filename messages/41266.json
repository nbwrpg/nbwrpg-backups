Various styles of\n&gt;RPing is used in this RPG. Theres Chat ways of actions or using &quot;::&quot; before\n&gt;and after every action, theres the script like RPing, which I use as well \n&gt;as\n&gt;some others, Theres also people who use story telling kind of RPing. If \n&gt;there\n&gt;was just one way that everyone RPed it would be fine but everyone uses\n&gt;different kinds so it may confuse the person. Although teaching the basics \n&gt;of\n&gt;RPing would be good but teaching them HOW to rp would be a bit rough. Heh\n&gt;everyone sooner or later learns on their own and they can adapt to styles\n&gt;they like.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
