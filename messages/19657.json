She sat up and looked\n&gt; around the lab. Looking down at her arms, she could see the outside\n&gt; of the skin changing. It was starting to cover the outside of the\n&gt; form. She moved slowly and a bit awkward. She stood up and leaned\n&gt; against the table. She looked at Veratis and spoke in a very sratchy\n&gt; voice, &quot;where is lunarpine? wil he make it back soon?&quot; SHe tried not\n&gt; to focus on the discomfort that came with the changing of her form.\n&gt; She took a step forward and stopped. It felt all to strange to be\n&gt; walking again.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk searched the medical files from any past injuries the\n&gt; alliance\n&gt; &gt; members might have had. she was hoping to simulate the DNA through\n&gt; the CR\n&gt; &gt; chambers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Phobias babies watched the happenings around KitKats group. they\n&gt; watched the\n&gt; &gt; conference with Magnus and Gabriel with simulated interest.
