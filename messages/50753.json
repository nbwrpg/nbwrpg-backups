It was all a Quintesson trap. He was to lead us Autobots to are destructi=\r\non. Prime fought it though and saved us, however he was on a ship that was =\r\ndestroyed. We thought he was lost forever. About six months later we learne=\r\nd that a Science ship from Earth had been near by. They were testing a new =\r\nalloy, by seeing if their ship could withstand a sun going nova near by. It=\r\n did. They also pulled Optimus out before his ship was destroyed. They had =\r\nalso taken aboard spores from the sun. Mere contact with these spores turne=\r\nd living things into hateful maniacs. The scientists who found the spores h=\r\nated Transformers so they lead us to find Optimus. Then they infected many =\r\nAutobots. It soon spread to the Decepticons, the human race, and then into =\r\nthe universe. Rodimus was even infected. We managed to have a Quintesson re=\r\nbuild Optimus once again. By coating himself in the alloy from the science =\r\nship he was able to take the Matrix of Leadership from Rodimus. Optimus use=\r\nd the last power of the Matrix and destroyed the Plague with the wisdom of =\r\nthe ages. Optimus continued to lead us from then on untill the Great Wrs en=\r\nded.

A \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; holographic image of himself would \n  display. &quot;I am so glad &lt;BR&gt;Rodimus &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; we \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; could come to terms. As for our one on \n  one battle. Dont you &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; worry. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will happen in due time.
