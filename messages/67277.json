Laser fire all around, the smell of\nozone and charred metal was like thick smog in the air. As the first\nwave passed over though, one thing became clear, there was only one\nCyclonus, commander of this invasion, and somewhere amidst the sweeps\nthere was scourge the master of the hunt. But what Rodimus was not\nwrong about was the sheer number of them, and the power of them! \n\n     As the carnage built it became painfully obvious to anyone who had\nfought Cyclonus in the past, that while he make look similar, this\nreformatted Cyclonus was sleeker, more agile, and the damage his\nmissiles and cannons were doing were rivaling what Galvatron did on his\nbest days. \n\nThe sweeps were cutting a devastating swath of wreckage through the\ncity as smoke rose to cover the sky in puffs of inky blackness. From\nhigh above Cyclonus looked down and approved even as Scourge hovered\nnext to him. \n\n&quot;You two!&quot; Scourge&#39;s rough voice somehow managed to penetrate the\ncacophony of the battle to reach Nighstrike and Darkfate . �You�re\ncoming with us!�\n\nWithout waiting for an answer Cyclonus, and Scourge banked twards the\nMaximal base, even as several sweeps took up position around them,\ntheir cannon fire laying waste to the front gates of the base as they\nlanded, renewed cannon fire giving them an entrance!\n\nHigh overhead Sweeps continued the onslaught as they pressed their\nattacks!\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;Minions)\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
