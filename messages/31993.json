If it couldn&#39;t catch air, and \n&gt; therefore couldn&#39;t float, then they would both land at the same time. \n&gt; Ever watch Bill Nye: Science Guy? Wait.... lemme think about \n&gt; this.  Weight is mass multiplied by gravity, therefore force. Force \n&gt; doesn&#39;t affect velocity. \n&gt; \tThe equation you would have needed to use to calculate how \n&gt; fast the objects are traveling is Ep + Ek = Ep + Ek (Ek=kinetic \n&gt; energy, and Ep=potential energy). \n&gt; \tEk on the left side would cancel, because v=0 (v=velocity). The \n&gt; Ep on the right side would also cancel out, since h=0 (h=height). \t\n&gt; \tThat leaves Ep=Ek. Ep=mgh, and Ek=0.5mv^2. (the &quot; ^ &quot; sign \n&gt; represents &quot;to the power of&quot;). \n&gt; \tThen you&#39;d have mgh=0.5mv^2. Mass cancels, making leaving \n&gt; us with gh=0.5v^2. \n&gt; Thus, I conclude that mass doesn&#39;t affect how fast you fall, only \n&gt; how high you are at the start.\n&gt; \n&gt; PS: weight is a force, in newtons.
