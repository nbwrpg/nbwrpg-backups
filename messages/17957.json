She saw Drillbit get hit and fall.  She shot at Megatron \nand then Megatron blew up into a million pieces.  She ran over to \nDrillbit, but he was dead. She held his body in her arm and cried. \nShe picked him up and took him to the base.  While walking she heard \na loud noise.  She turned to see what it was....\n\nHer head fell out of her hand and she jerked up. She looked around \nand saw that she was in the lab. She breathed a deep sigh of relief. \n&quot;Oh thank the matrix, it was only a dream.&quot;\nShe looked at the console.  Te computer was still working on the \nspark.\n\n\n\n"}}
