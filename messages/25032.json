He flipped up to miss the slash and \nused all his force to go straight down on top of the bot. He was on the bots \nback. He wrapped his legs around the bots waist. He took his left arm and \ngrabbed the bots left fore arm to keep it down. He used his right arm to grab \nthe bots right forearm. He wrapped his tail around the bots left shoulder and \nyanked it with all his strength to the left. Ripping it off. (because I am \nright on top I am allowed to post some damage.) His teeth shined in the sun. \nHe took a large bite into the bots right shoulder. His teeth clenching in. He \npulled to the right with enormous power most likley ripping off that arm \nunless the bot had some type of super glue holding him togeather. To make \nsure her through out his fire energy wich would incenerate it on contact. \nWhen his tail had wrapped aroung the left shoulder the end stuck into the \nbots ribs.  Sucking out his mech fluid and into galvatron. His green jewel \nglowed and shot a beam right through the bots upper back area. Wich would \ncome out his middle chest.his knee guns shoit multiple energys into the bots \nsides. Galvatron smiled with his teeth in the bots right shoulder as the \nflame energy came out with a muffle sound he said.... &quot;Some things just \nshouldnt tast like chicken.&quot;\n\n"}}
