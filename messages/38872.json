Again she needed help and \nshe needed it so slaggin fast!!!\n\nStarstomp:\nI am the cybertronian named Starstomp and I request urgent assistance. To \nany sentient entities that are situated to the west of my position, please \ncomply as fast as possible. I am currently bordering stasis lock and I am \ncompletely willing to help you!!
