She \nentered and saw her crew busy at work.

Soon we will be \nunited...and a council will be established on Earth for the Predacons.&quot;\n    She walked around the room, and sent the message to Cyber Claw to come as \nquickly as possible for a briefing. Cyber Claw was an asset to the team, and \nhe role would be Information Officer, as in getting and delivering top secret \ninformation. Mainly agianst the Maximlas, the Predacons sworn enemies.\n\n"}}
