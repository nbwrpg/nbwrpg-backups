Yes, he was a\nmachine who&#39;s very size and power commanded respect. Not only that but\nhe had forged a group of predators . . . of PREDACONS seemingly out\nthe defeat that had been dealt them by the Maximals at the end of the\nfirst Beast Wars. Was he still MEGATRON and GALVATRON or was he\nsomething wholly different and how would this affect the future of the\nPredacons? Only the future would say.\n\nAs the group made their way to the meeting room there was indeed an\nopen message link waiting for HYDRAS, although the signature was not\nthat of STRAIGHT SHOT and instead of looking for WASPINATOR it was\naddressed properly to the current Predacon commander HYDRAS.\n\n&quot;We must talk.&quot; were the words that were waiting for HYDRAS as he\narrived. LEO PRIME&#39;s stern face appeared to look through the link and\nsee not only HYDRAS but those who were traveling with him, peering\ninto his very secrets.\n\nOf course that was not the case, since HYDRAS would have to\nacknowledge him first, and it would be up to him how much could be\nseen.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
