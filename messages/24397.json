And, just to let you know, they just might actually \nwork. Then we�ll see if the Alliance is the most powerful factor in the \nBeast Wars. We�ll see. Than it�ll be MY turn to brag.\nAnd the Maximals DO rule! Because they�re the coolest! AND�all of them work \nhard to succeed at their goals.\nThat�s what counts! Because their goal is to win the Beast Wars and send \ntheir enemies packing. And with all their determination, they�ll do it!\nAnd don�t be so cocky. Without those gestalts the Maximals would have the \nAlliance retreating with their tails between their legs. Besides, I plan to \ndo something to even the odds with those gestalts.\nNo offence�just wanna get you back for that vat of acid crack. ;D\nOh! And Merry Christmas weekend to everyone too!\n\n\n\n\n* Iron Raptor swears under her breath as she watches her shots miss, \ngrowling and then moving in the target lock in a bit to aim towards \nNemisis�s chest.\nBut then she growls again as he suddenly activates his com-link and calls in \na message to Zardus.\nAfter pressing the triggers of the auto-mounted weapons again, sending 6 \ncharges towards Nemesis, she calls over the noise of the battle.*\n\n� So weak you can�t even fight your own battles without a little help? Get \ndown her and I�ll give you a reason to call reinforcements!�\n\n* She was more powerful now, but this mounted pair of blasters was weighing \nher down and she couldn�t use her body to it�s top abilities. Slightly, in \nthe back of her mind, she wished that she could use those pinfeathers on her \nback to fly, meeting Nemisis Enforcer on his own field of battle.\nAnd also, she slightly wondered just what Prowl was up to now, hoping that \nhe was alright and kicking some butt, rather then it being opposite and HIS \ntail feathers on the line.\nIron Raptor quickly thought, in order not to distract Prowl from what he was \ndoing.*\n\n&lt; How�s it going, love?&gt;\n\n* But she had little time to receive anything right away if she had tried, \nseeing Nemisis suddenly yell out over the noise and send a rather large \nassault of charges towards her.\nIron Raptor quickly moved the guns back into place behind her shoulders and \ntook out her sword, then wondering slightly what the little fuzz-ball in her \nback compartment was doing. It had been a rough jog over here and she hoped \nthat he wasn�t too shaken up. But she couldn�t let him go, not out into a \nbattle like this.\nMoving her legs to brace for impact, Iron Raptor extended the shield on her \nleft arm as she held the sword ready by her right cheek.\nA few second before the charges hit she called back over her shoulder \ntowards Tavatron as she delt with her own problems.*\n\n� How are you holding up?!�\n\n* But then the first of the charges hit, striking the shield and making it \nbuck back slightly with the impact. But then something happened, something \nthat Iron Raptor hadn�t expected.\nThe shield had absorbed the charges energy!\nThe blade of the sword glew for a moment after the shield had taken the \nenergy from the charge and transferred it through Iron Raptor�s body and \ninto the sword itself.\nA few more charges hit the shield and they were absorbed too, but some also \nmissed. There were a few though, which had landed fairly close and the \nimpact of them shattered the occasional rock, sending shards of it towards \nIron Raptors armor.\nCutting through a bit and digging into her skin/armor under.\nShe winced.\nThis fight wasn�t going well, not at all!\nBut then, suddenly feeling the sword very hot in her hands, and without even \nknowing it, Iron Raptor found herself lowering the shield and retracting it, \nsimply leaving her out in the open, the sword�s blade glowing very brightly.\nThe battle mechanism as kicking in now.\nThe handle of the sword now so hot it was burning her palm. But she didn�t \nnotice, glaring at Nemisis Enforcer from under her helm.*\n\n� Play? If you insist!�\n\n* The blade of the sword suddenly exploded with light, the blade so blinding \nthat she didn�t dare look at it.\nA sudden burst of invisible energy erupted from the sword, blowing up dirt \nall around Iron Raptor, her cape flapping in the wind, which seemed to \nsurround her.*\n\n� But I�m warning you! I play ROUGH!!!�\n\n* Concentrating on a small flicker of light which seemed to be her still \npoint and center, Iron Raptor called upon that flicker with her thoughts and \nstrength. Soon, that flicker developed into a roaring inferno, and it was \nthen that a bright sphere of purple light developed around Iron Raptor, the \ncolor of the power the sword had created.\nThen, at the second her eyes snapped directly towards Nemisis the orb \nexpanded, in a split second.\nFrom only the size of a small house to that of a large building, the energy \nexploded up and out. Any enemy within its � mile radius would most likely \nfeel its power. But this was directed towards Nemisis, and it would only be \nhim who could feel the pain and be defeated by it, if she had done it right.\nWhich was yet to be seen.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
