But he didn&#39;t\n&gt; know what good he would do. He may just get in the way.\n&gt;\n&gt; Something hard hit the top of his head, freezing his thoughts. He cried\nout\n&gt; in pain, grabbing for his head. He looked down, seeing that a heavy shard\nof\n&gt; rock had broken off from the ceiling of the tunnel. That was the signal\nfor\n&gt; him to get the Inferno out of there. He wasn&#39;t needed.\n&gt;\n&gt; He ducked his head, a little embarassed. &quot;Ah&#39;ll jus&#39; go. Hollar if ya need\n&gt; anythin&#39;!&quot; He walked out as quickly as he could. As he exited, he saw that\n&gt; his body was covered in black dust and soot. He wiped at his arms and\nchest.\n&gt; He would have to clean this off. He transformed to beast mode and left the\n&gt; cave.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Life&#39;s too short to send boring email.
