Oh my...are you sure that is what\n&gt; the profecy meant? Literally till all are one? I&#39;m not sure.  I\n&gt; agree, combining the maximal and predacon programs may be a good\n&gt; thing, but then again... OK, think about how the predacons and\n&gt; maximals get alone now.  If you combine the programs, you&#39;ll eithr\n&gt; have a bot that is totally neutral, or totally insane. But, there may\n&gt; be another way.  What if we took the best of both and combined parts\n&gt; of the two programs, but not doanload the whole program.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; -Lady Hawk listened intently, it was possible to teach a bot when\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s programming is new, but it was to hard to teach a new bot old\n&gt; &gt; tricks. &quot;Right now there are still two main programmings, Maximal\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; Predacon. What if we were to combine the two? Not just combine\n&gt; &gt; animals but combine programming too.&quot; Squizzy was smart enough to\n&gt; &gt; know when ideas were right or wrong.
