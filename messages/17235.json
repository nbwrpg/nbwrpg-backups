She still felt \ncold and wasn&#39;t sure why.  She felt drained and almost exhausted \nthough she didn&#39;t know why. She could only truely &#39;feel&#39;(close to the \nsence of touch) the connection she had with Veratis.  But the fear of \nthe unknown and not having any sence of control scared her beyond any \nmeasure of fear she had ever had before. &quot;Please tell me Veratis,,why \nare you helping us? Please tell me who you are? Where did you come \nfrom?&quot; She was hoping that she might either make friends with this \nVeratis or gain some sort of advantage.  She was to scared not to try \nto do something. Even if it was only talking. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;I communicated with him not to long ago, he has what we need, he \n&gt; just said he wanted to check something out at the base.

Outside the link he monitored the different \nreactions \n&gt; his words received.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
