A dirty move, but effective. This one is good. She tossed her head, \nscreeching loudly, her voice getting deeper with her rage. She was famous \nfor her voice and her temper. She threw herself on her back, landing on the \nother raptor.\n\nShe leaped up to her feet, and scurried backwards, into clearer view. She \nwas almost identical to Dinobot, except she had dark skin under her eyes, \ndue to her stresses of struggling to survive out in the wilds. She lowered \nher head, twitching her tail wildly. She flexed her inner toe claws.\n\n&quot;Get out!&quot; she screamed at the other raptor. Her voice had turned into her \nDinobot tone that was known to scare off rivals that knew him. &quot;Get out!&quot;\n\nSuddenly, Cyber Claw could smell a new scent. She curled her lips, eyeing \neverything that could be seen.\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
