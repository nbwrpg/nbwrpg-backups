Domnijoe gives the communications pannel a hard smack and\nthe \nproblem fades. Sort of.\n    Blindchaos looks at his companion. \n    &quot;what did he say?&quot;\n    &quot;I believe we&#39;re being rescued.&quot; Domnijoe says. She pauses a \nmomment and sends out another message.\n    &quot;Our communication systems&quot;, she says, &quot;are a mess so I hope you \ncan hear me. Thank Primus there are still Decepticons on the planet. \nWe have a downed ship. We&#39;re in need of energon.&quot; She pauses and \nfirmly kicks Blindchaos to rid him of his endless smirk. It was\nreally \nannoying her. &quot; We will wait for your arrival. Domnijoe out.&quot;\n    Blindchaos looks hopeful and flabberghasted at the same time. \n    &quot;Who&#39;s Cyclonus?&quot; he says.\n    Domnijoe shruggs.\n    &quot;Beats me. The name sounds familliar but it&#39;s probably my \nimagination.&quot;\n    &quot;You think Megatron is still here?&quot;\n    Domnijoe sighs.\n    &quot;I hope. We need a kick ass and take names leader again. The \nshmucks I was stuck with were too...wussy.&quot; \n    &quot;Like me.&quot; The Decepticon male says, mournful for the first time \non their trip.\n     &quot;I never said that.&quot; Domnijoe snapps. &quot;Yer just so God-damn \nchipper all the time.&quot; The Decepticon female leans back on the \ncomputer terminal. &quot;You know I can&#39;t do your job like you do. Nobody \ncan. I&#39;m sure the present leader will have plenty of work for you to \ndo.&quot;\n     Domnijoe suddenly notices the communications pannel hadn&#39;t cut \noff her message when she thought. She bangs the computer, which shuts \nit down. She hoped Cyclonus didn&#39;t hear the entire conversation.\n     She sighs. (This should be an interesting expanation) she thinks \nto herself, (If he cares about what was said.)\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n****************************************************************\n     \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Cyclonus:::\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus: Yes, we are leaving now.\n&gt; ::he opens his comm to the source of the distress call::\n&gt; Cyclonus: This is Cyclonus.
