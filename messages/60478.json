His puncture \n&gt; wounds had mostly recovered by now, but his energy reserve was \n&gt; noticably affected.  This enraged him, no opponent had ever dropped \n&gt; his power by such a degree, and this would be the last time.  He \n&gt; opened fire with both his weapons, acid blaster on Rodimus and \n&gt; missile blaster on Cryaltron.\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; Then, the sixth minion of Unicron decended, with a few of her \n&gt; Sweeps in tow.  The Sweep commander landed and looked over the \n&gt; battles in progress.  Her interest was perticularly drawn to the \n&gt; fight between Malice and Nightstrike.  She took a step closer and \n&gt; watched he two fight in interest, while the Sweeps went to aid the \n&gt; other minions.\n&gt; &gt; \t\t\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
