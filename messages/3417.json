He fell to his knees,but quickly got back up. He looked to see who shot him but didn&#39;t see  anyone because Double Punch was in stelth mode.(I think) Counter Punch&#39;s and Injector&#39;s blasts hit him but they only did minimal damage.He continued firing at the Predacons.\n\nTiceradon managed to roll over out of the way just as Beeline&#39;s blast hit the ground where his head had been.\n\nStegotron&#39;s back plates protected him from Double Punch&#39;s missile. He then dodged Injector&#39;s missiles and fired back.\nStegotron:Where the slag are those maximal reinforcements I called for!\n\nnbwrpg@egroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Double Punch/Injector/Counter Punch:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch smiled. �Raising both of his pinches, he fired a missile at \n&gt; Ultracon&#39;s back, and a missile Stegotron&#39;s back.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Beeline, the cyber-bee, dived, firing an optic blast at a downed Triceradon.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Counter Punch stumbled back from Ultracon&#39;s blasts, firing three shots from \n&gt; his photon rifle at the Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector twirled to the left, avoiding all the shots but one, sending him \n&gt; slamming into a tree. �Raising his launcher, he fired off three stinger \n&gt; missiles at Stegotron, an optic blast heading for Ultracon.\n&gt; \n\n----------\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://home.netscape.com/webmail/\n\n"}}
