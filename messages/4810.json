Where was all the glory? Where was all the Maximals\n&gt; to slag?!\n&gt; She looked down halls as she passed them, thinking about how she&#39;d like\n&gt; Gangon to be walking beside her. She smiled at that thought. Him with all\n&gt; his comments about her pretty he thought she was, his crazy antics that\nmade\n&gt; her laugh on the inside but she never showed.\n&gt; He was a funny bot...but she had grown to like him...even a bit more then\n&gt; she let on.\n&gt; In plain...you could ALMOST say that she loved him.\n&gt; BrightBlade sighed again, but with him not with her at the moment she was\n&gt; still bored out of her tree!\n&gt; Well, she could always ask if Hell Beast had anything he wanted her to do.\n&gt; She opened her com-link to his frequency.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; This is BrightBlade. Is there anything in which you require me to do for\n&gt; you, My Lord?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She quietly waited for a responce.\n&gt;\n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt;\n&gt; Rage growled as she looked between the trees and spoted the enemy ship,\nthe\n&gt; huge metal thing in which stank of steel!\n&gt; She looked it over from her vantage point, how strange and ugly it was!\n&gt; She then saw something walk out of it, it was another of those raptor\n&gt; things! The things that tastes just as bad as the things they lived in\n&gt; smelled!\n&gt; Rage shook her head at remembering the taste, something she never wanted\nto\n&gt; sink her teeth into again!\n&gt; She stayed where she was and watched, there was no point in giving away\nher\n&gt; position when she didn&#39;t want to.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!\n&gt; 1.
