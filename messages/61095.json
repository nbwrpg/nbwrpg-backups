She put them away, and picked up her\n&gt; staff.  She felt for where Unicron was, and pointed it\n&gt; there.  She closed her eyes, and began to see.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There&#39;s...a...a...a matainence shaft that&#39;s\n&gt; unguarded, because it has a powerful shield\n&gt; surrounding it.  Unicron merely lowers the shield when\n&gt; neccessary for repair purposes.  But every two\n&gt; Megacycles the shields weaken, due to a standard\n&gt; intruder scan, for fifteen cycles.  If you situate\n&gt; youself outside of Unicron, and have a shield\n&gt; puncturer (OOC: Not sure what that thing Black Aracnia\n&gt; used was called), then at the last minute, after the\n&gt; scan is through but before the shield is re-raised,\n&gt; you can open a hole and get in.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The effort finally overcame her, and she fell to her\n&gt; hands and knees panting.\n\n\n\n"}}
