I am also about to conclude an agreement with \nZardus the leader of the faction called the Alliance. They could assist us, \nfor now. I will recommend you to Zardus.\n\n(to Zardus):\nI am on the move. (he started over to where Zardus was) But I must remind \nyou that I will take part to the IGL and that I shall soon depart. If any of \nyour troops need a ride aboard the Hellgate, it&#39;s on me. If you would like \nother troops to assist you, may I suggest that you contact Commander \nBelthassan in Australia? He is an old comrade, and he has just established a \nbase there...\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
