Superimposing the two, he \ngets \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; rough blueprint to work from.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna have to take you \noffline \n&gt; &gt; for a while, while I install the upgrade.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Very well,&quot; she stated with a grace & sophistication in her voice. \n&gt; She awaited for his instructions.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh, and for your information... there are some raw materials in \nthe \n&gt; hold, including Cybertronium. I would prefer my old form back just \nas \n&gt; it once was.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;OOC: BTW, there is pix of Maxima in her transforming mode under \n&gt; Photos, it&#39;s the 2nd form, both robot & jet mode. If you wish, she \n&gt; can have a tank mode as well, just I don&#39;t have the tank pic yet. \n&gt; Under Files is the details of her height, speed, etc. Her exo cover \n&gt; is basically as tough as Arcee&#39;s if not slightly toughter. \n&gt; Have fun.\n\nOOC: Just as long as it&#39;s inside NBW limitations - ie 16 feet tall or \nless.\n\n&quot;Okey-dokey, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;  Jackie heads to the hold and soon \nreturns with a double-armload of parts.  He glances around for a \nsuitable workstation and settles on a nearby table.
