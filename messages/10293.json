As foar \nas she was concerned, she was the commander now. She single handedly saved \nthe ship, and the dominance of the Predacons as well.\n    &quot;Alright you parasitic slut, you&#39;lll be caged here until I talk with \nMegatron. Your boyfriend is eight levels up, and the internal weponry is \nstill armed and ready so I suggest you stay put.&quot; Aracnia said, motioning \nwith her gun for Darkmouse to enter the vault where energon was formerly kept.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n    The mirk of the swapms was the thickest in all the beast wars. No other \nplace was as dismal or dark as the swamps that bordered the Predacon and \nMaximal territories. They were vast, deep, and housed some of the most \ndangerous prehistoric creatures anyone had seen.\n    Among all the chaos of the bugs and aquatic life of the swamp, a long \nlost and forgotten stasis pod slipped from its peach and floated to the bank \nof a body of water.\n    The computer, now able to activate, began the DNA scanning process to \nselect the beast mode of the protoform within. The sphere rose, and scanned \nthe vast area of the swamp. After a double pass, it selected the most \npowerful beast mode according to the habitat.\n    The sphere rejoined the pod, and the transformation began. Moments past \nand the computer bagan to read off the data needed by the new form to survive \nin the beast wars.\n    With a crack, the door opened and the new warrior crawled out of the pod \nand on to the bank of the swamp. He looked around. With the complete history \nof the beast wars stored in his data banks, he would be able to handle \nhimself in this new world.\n    Looking, he said to himself, &quot;Ah, this beast mode shall make a fine body. \nNow all I need to do is to transform.&quot;\n    Paralysis said the code word and his Predacon Beast Mode emerged. The \nfrog changed into an armored knight of the Predacon dynasty. He was armed \nwith a toxen gun, a semi-automatic pistol, and optic lasers. \n    &quot;Ha! Now to contact the Predacons...and to end the reign of the Maximals!&quot;\n\n"}}
