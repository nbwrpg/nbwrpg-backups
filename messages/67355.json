I apologize in\n&gt;  advance.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  BIC:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  The =\r\nair is becoming positively filled with the acrid smell of laser\n&gt;  fire and=\r\n the bite of acid. The skies above are still thick with sweeps,\n&gt;  but for =\r\nthose keeping count, the number of them is beginning to\n&gt;  diminish. Whatev=\r\ner the various defenders are doing it is beginning to\n&gt;  take its toll on t=\r\nhe minions. But so far their onslaught continues\n&gt;  without let up!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  =\r\nSweeps around the base continue a holding pattern above and beyond the\n&gt;  d=\r\noor, either out of range or the field of view of the door&#39;s cannons\n&gt;  and =\r\ndefenders. They continue concentrating firepower around the base,\n&gt;  their =\r\nheavy lasers and disintegration beams bathing its shields in\n&gt;  scintillati=\r\nng colors. Blasts from Guardia and the gate guards continue\n&gt;  to keep the =\r\nsweeps at bay, and even succeed in bringing down a few. As\n&gt;  a result the =\r\nsweeps redouble thier efforts to stay out of the direct\n&gt;  line of fire and=\r\n attempt to harass anyone trying to leave through the\n&gt;  doors. (OOC: No th=\r\ne sweeps are not at the doors, but anyone trying to\n&gt;  come out may have to=\r\n face their firepower from an oblique angle. The\n&gt;  sweeps may not be able =\r\nto totally block the door, but they can make\n&gt;  exits difficult. IE: people=\r\n should be able to leave, but should pose\n&gt;  having to dodge cannon fire an=\r\nd such) \n&gt;  \n&gt;  As for Salveo, his scans for any other minions other than t=\r\nhe ones in\n&gt;  the air, or otherwise already accounted for come up negative.=\r\n However\n&gt;  as far as most of his sensors are concerned the sweeps are not =\r\nthere,\n&gt;  only infrared picks up a slight vapor trail from their exhaust wh=\r\nen\n&gt;  they engage engines in heavy thrust, or visual cameras as they pan ov=\r\ner\n&gt;  their fields of view. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Somewhat nearby:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Several sweeps =\r\ngo up in an amazing blast of fire and pyrotechnics as\n&gt;  Lord Perseus&#39; long=\r\n black rifle lights into the air. Several charred and\n&gt;  smoking frames fal=\r\nl from the skies and hit the streets below! For the\n&gt;  rest of the sweeps t=\r\nhe reaction is swift as they swing away from the\n&gt;  fortifications for a mo=\r\nment and circle around trying to find an\n&gt;  opening. For the moment Perseus=\r\n&#39; immediate area is free, however the\n&gt;  walls of his fortification still r=\r\numble and debris continue to fall\n&gt;  around him as laser fire targets his l=\r\nocation from sides he cannot yet\n&gt;  defend! \n&gt;  \n&gt;  In the air above:\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n  Cyclonus turned away from Ravenchief&#39;s as the Maximal fell away from\n&gt;  h=\r\nim, the expression on his face giving no hint to his inner thoughts.\n&gt;  Ins=\r\ntead he turns his attention to his true prey ...   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  On the streets b=\r\nelow:\n&gt;   \n&gt;  As Ravenchief pulls himself out of his fall and swings up, tw=\r\no sweeps\n&gt;  move in his direction led by a slightly larger one. &quot;Ahhhh, so =\r\nwe meet\n&gt;  again. I have come to return the favor!&quot; Laughter rings out as l=\r\naser\n&gt;  fire opens up from Scourge and soon enough from the sweeps beside h=\r\nim.\n&gt;  (OOC: I know Windlord is in route, but not sure how close he is)\n&gt;  =\r\nNear the waters:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  At the water below:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Below near the water the=\r\n combined firepower of Kup, Doc and Rodimus\n&gt;  Prime are enough to finish o=\r\nff the few remaining sweeps that menace\n&gt;  them. Sending several smoking an=\r\nd charred wrecks to a wet grave beneath\n&gt;  the ocean waves. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  However=\r\n their respite is short indeed as Cyclonus and nearly a half a\n&gt;  dozen swe=\r\neps move over the railing floating down to the waterfront,\n&gt;  perhaps the v=\r\nery sweeps that scattered to avoid Cyclonus&#39; earlier\n&gt;  missile attack have=\r\n returned. Now they circled Cyclonus, like air bourn\n&gt;  lions waiting for t=\r\nhe command to attack! \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Cyclonus looks down, and with a gesture from =\r\nhim the Sweeps swirled\n&gt;  forward, their cannons lashing out at Doc and Kup=\r\n, even as Cyclonus\n&gt;  continued is decent. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  &quot;Rodimus Prime!&quot; The old=\r\n timber of Cyclonus&#39; voice resonated against\n&gt;  the cliff walls. &quot;You have =\r\nonly one choice ahead of you now.&quot; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Perhaps this is the same Cyclonu=\r\ns of old, perhaps not, but as he\n&gt;  descended, the very power he radiated s=\r\nhowed something there was\n&gt;  something newa bout him. This is NOT the Cyclo=\r\nnus that served under\n&gt;  Galvatron. The reformat he and Scourge had undergo=\r\nne changed them\n&gt;  somehow, and it is as if Cyclonus has been fully unleash=\r\ned, and finally\n&gt;  brought to his fullest potential. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  His voice deep=\r\nened as he continued, &quot;You will give me the Matrix now,\n&gt;  or I will lay wa=\r\nste to you and this entire city and take it from your\n&gt;  smoking frame!&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt;  __________________________________________________\n&gt;  Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;=\r\n  Tired of spam?
