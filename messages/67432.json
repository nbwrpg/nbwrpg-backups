Rodimus flips and lands on his back but he quickly rolls to\n&gt; his feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus fires a few of his arm mounted lasers to stir up the sand in\n&gt; front of Cyclonus. Rodimus tries to use this cover as he again leaps\n&gt; at Cyclonus trying to hand out a forearm shot across the jaw.\n\nCyclonus expected a return attack from Rodimus, but not one from this\nangle. His head is rocked back by the force of Rodimus attack and he\nstumbled back a pace or two. &quot;Hrmph. Rodumus, stooping to underhanded\nmeans so quickly?&quot; His voice betraying more of a dark humor than\ninjured pride.\n\nCyclonus is obviously a seasoned warrior and he quickly regained his\nproper balance. It is also possible that a few of his backward steps\nwere feigned as it left him with ample room for his next atack! With a\nflex of his powerful legs Cyclonus leaped into the air, as he did so he\nspun and at the last moment snapped out a leg, his foot flexed and\nready, Cyclonus attempted an arial round house kick on Rodimus.\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
