For all you know, there could be something that kills all the\n&gt; predacons in it with the push of a button. But that would be against the\n&gt; rules, so there isn&#39;t. So stop declaring things moding that you have no\n&gt; knowledge about.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Blue Stinger looks over at the Ark. She pushes several buttonson her wrist\n&gt; and turns back to fire at Inferno. Somewhere inside the Ark, a secondary\n&gt; energy supply turns on. The computer beeps. &quot;Energy levels at 70% and\n&gt; rising,&quot; It says, &quot;Teletran 1 online.&quot; The shields renew their power and\nthe\n&gt; autoguns resume their fire with a vengence.\n&gt;\n&gt; Several autoguns destroy some of the Ion disks that Manterror shot at\n&gt; Antagony, but the rest hit her. She stumbles back and fires at Manterror\n&gt; along with the autoguns.\n&gt;\n&gt; Key looks up from where she was sitting on the ground. She sighs. &quot;I have\nto\n&gt; get back to help the maximals.
