The blow caused the Maximal to \nshake his head after he stopped moving to try and make the room stop spinning \naround him.\n\n&quot;On the subject you won&#39;t die, just be knocked into stasis lock.  I shall let \nmy Dark Lord slay you.&quot; Vehement laughed as he charged forward, stabbing \nforward with his blade.  The metallic blade pierced through Smokescreen&#39;s \nrelatively weak armor, penetrating out the other side.  The Archbishop smiled \nat the sight of his seven foot long broadsword sticking through Smokescreen&#39;s \nabdomen.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m...not...going...down...that easily...&quot; Smokescreen spat up mech-fluid as \nhe tried to speak, his talk gurgled.  He fired an optic blast off at \nVehement, the laser energy piercing into the Archbishop&#39;s left cheek.\n\nThe Brotherhood leader let go of his sword, Smokescreen falling to the ground \nin stasis lock.  Gripping his left cheek with a hand he could tell the wound \nhad gone deep, but hadn&#39;t damaged any vital components.  Lucky for Vehement, \nSmokescreen&#39;s vision still told him the room was spinning.  &quot;Garbage!&quot; he \nyelled, kicking the side of Smokescreen&#39;s head.\n\nReaching down Vehement picked up Smokescreen by the throat, lifting him up \nuntil his feet were a few feet from the ground.  Putting his free hand \nforward, his outstretched palm began emitting sonic waves at Smokescreen&#39;s \ncheset.\n\n-Prepare to take down the shields and then head back to base on my command- \nthe dark warrior said via inner monologue comm. to Sun Crusher and Reflector, \nwho hovered outside the bridge, weapons aimed at the hole in the CF.\n\nVehement felt a shake and cursed.  &quot;What was that!&quot; he yelled, knowing his \nminions could hear him.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m detecting another hole in the Cybertronian Fire, the main entry way to \nthe CF was blown apart somehow.  Shields are still up.&quot; Reflector reported.\n\n&quot;Excellent.&quot; Vehement smiled, still emitting sonic waves at Smokescreen&#39;s \nchest, breaking it apart quickly at the molecular level.\n\n\n\n"}}
