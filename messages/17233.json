She could only imagine what that \n&gt; kind of payback Veratis might want.  She suddenly felt cold and \n&gt; started to feel drained.  She still had to hang on untill Lunarine \n&gt; returned.  She made a promise to never leave him and she wasn&#39;t \nabout \n&gt; to break it now. &quot;when do you expect Luanrpine to return?&quot; her \nspark \n&gt; jumped as the thought of being stuck here without him crossed her \n&gt; mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Veratis was trying to word together the proper response in \n&gt; &gt; understandable terms.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I had to remove your spark from Lunarpines, you are in a newborn \n&gt; &gt; protoform, The DNA scanners are trying to assimilate the DNA I \n&gt; &gt; imprinted and programmed to reject it.
