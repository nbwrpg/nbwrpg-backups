She could feel the gentle hand of a bot \n&gt; stroking her head.  It took a bit of effort, but she managed a weak \n&gt; smile. She sighed softly, feeling no more pain and feeling much \n&gt; better, exhausted, but better. She slowly opened her optics and \n&gt; looked up at Blackfang. She whispered, &quot;thank you.&quot; and closed her \n&gt; optics again.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Blackfang leaned his back against a wall and started to chuckle.
