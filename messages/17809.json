She lay there, \ngasping for breath.  Most of her body was covered in mech fluid. She \nlooked up with her eyes and saw Andromeda.  She gave a small \nsmile.  &quot;We got them, we hit them hard huh? we got them. They fled \nlike the cowards they were huh?&quot;  She coughed and choked.&quot;Did we get \nour bots back? We got Spears back and Striker yes? yesss.&quot;  She \nclosed her eyes.&quot;Thank the Matrix we got our friends back. That&#39;s \nwhat we fought for, friends.&quot;  She closed her eyes and \nwhispered. &quot;Till all are one.&quot;\nHer body then lay still and the light in her optics faded.  Her spark \nstopped beating in her chest and joined the matrix.\n\n\nPlease put SnowCat on the deceased list.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Andromeda:::\n&gt; \n&gt; Andromeda: Sure, ill help, if you help with Bluestreak\n&gt; ::She looks at SnowCat::\n&gt; Andromeda: i think she needs help too.\n\n\n"}}
