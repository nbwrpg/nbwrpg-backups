You like WWF better, because they&#39;re good guys, and \n  therefore yo=\r\nu cheer them on, much like what marks generally do. No shame in \n  that, bu=\r\nt what I said is completely true and it&#39;s not worth arguing the \n  truth. P=\r\nA: Booker T has been wrestling for 15 years now. HE&#39;S paid his \n  dues... &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n\n  No...then I am not a &#39;mark&#39;.  Who the hell comes up with these gay wor=\r\nds like \n  &quot;bomdigity&quot; and making &quot;tight&quot; into a meaning for &quot;cool&quot;?  When =\r\nthe Rock \n  first came into the WWF he wasn&#39;t the Rock.  He was Dwayne John=\r\nson.  And he \n  was booed.  Then he was Flex Kavana.  And he was booed.  Th=\r\nen he was Rocky \n  Maiva, and he was booed.  Then he became the Rock.  Then=\r\n because of this \n  great character he had made, he gained popularity and i=\r\ns as great as he is.  \n  He has charisma and personality.  He has great mov=\r\nes and talent.  He&#39;s not a \n  babyface, by the way, he&#39;s a heel.  So you&#39;re=\r\n wrong about that.  The only \n  time I root for babyfaces is when they&#39;re r=\r\nidiculously outnumbered and \n  someone is to much of a wuss to fight them. =\r\n Which, gee, the Rock always goes \n  in headfirst.  And I like bad guys maj=\r\norly, hence the whole Decepticon thing \n  with me.  In G1 they&#39;re trash-tal=\r\nked and always lose, but they&#39;re still cool \n  because they have attitude u=\r\nnlike the mostly monotonic attitude of the \n  Autobots.  &quot;They&#39;re in troubl=\r\ne we must aid them.&quot;  But the Decepticons, \n  &quot;They&#39;re in trouble, let&#39;s si=\r\nt back and watch &#39;em burn!&quot;  Rock isn&#39;t really a \n  bad guy, but he sure as=\r\n hell isn&#39;t a babyface.\n\n  See, if you&#39;d read what I type, you&#39;d notice I t=\r\nalked about the charisma and \n  moves.  Costumes aren&#39;t that important.  He=\r\nll, look at Kane.  What he&#39;s \n  wearing now is gay.  Before that he had it =\r\nperfected.  I don&#39;t like the whole \n  biker thing with Undertaker.  But tha=\r\nt&#39;s okay, because they make up for it \n  with skill and cool attitudes.  Th=\r\ne WCW lacks those.\n\n  If WCW or ECW were any good, they wouldn&#39;t have falle=\r\nn.  They&#39;re just \n  breeding grounds for really good wrestlers like Stone C=\r\nold and such who join \n  the WCW.  Only reason WWF superstars joined WCW is=\r\n there contracts would end \n  with the WWF and ol&#39; Turner would be there wa=\r\nving muchos money in their face. \n   Booker T.&#39;s been wrestling in what for=\r\n 15 years?  He sure as hell sucks for \n  going that long.  \n\n  The Rock has=\r\n NEVER backed down from a fight.  Everyone else has.  Stone Cold, \n  Kurt A=\r\nngle, Shane O&#39;Mac, all of &#39;em.  That&#39;s part of the Rock&#39;s character.  \n  He=\r\n won&#39;t back down, even if he gets the hell beat out of him.  Sometimes he \n=\r\n  wins, sometimes he doesn&#39;t.\n\n  -L.
