If an election does\n&gt; start up I know I will \n&gt; be throwing my hat in and I know that at least one\n&gt; council member thinks I \n&gt; should be on the council. After all some of the\n&gt; things I have talked to the \n&gt; council about have been met with positive feedback.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
