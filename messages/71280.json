But with things as they are, and \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happened ta him in the past, I can kind of see why he=\r\n&#39;s put up such \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and why he&#39;s so det=\r\nermined ta think off the pavement.  And maybe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wh=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed with mine too=\r\n, at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Honestly though, how do you feel about his =\r\nthinking outside the box?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a reason w=\r\nhy you&#39;d rather not go that way?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For=\r\n a moment LEGACY looked confused, his single crimson optic boring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i=\r\nnto STRAIGHT SHOT as his mind ran over what she said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I do=\r\n not understand all of the colloquialisms than you have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; utilized.&quot; =\r\nHe said at last, &quot;But I ascertain that you are attempting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to explai=\r\nn your sibling&#39;s actions to me and inquiring as to why I will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not a=\r\nllow Tuscon to disturb Optimus Prime&#39;s chassis.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LEGACY&#39;s o=\r\nptic flickered for a moment. &quot;I appreciate your intent.&quot; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said hi=\r\ns words clear and well articulated. &quot;But I do not require an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explan=\r\nation, since I have taken no offense to his actions; to do so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would=\r\n be an inefficient use of my time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;However to answer your=\r\n question I will replay something for you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Turning to the =\r\nscreen that was standing behind LEGACY he fired a beam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of energy at=\r\n it. But instead of it exploding into shards of glass and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debris it=\r\n simply changed to show a mountainous scene, a volcano, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then th=\r\ne volcano exploding to reveal the Ark. It was obvious from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moti=\r\non that the events were being speeded up for ease of viewing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Soon after it happened a small satellite like device rose up from the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ark and began to travel away from it and after a while return. After\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another short moment, short because of the speeded up play back,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MEGATRON flew out along with STARSCREAM, SOUNDWAVE and a few other\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Decepticon seekers, obviously having been repaired by the device. The=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all land on a cliff and look back at the Ark, and STARSCREAM fire=\r\ns a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blast at the Ark and they all fly off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inside t=\r\nhe Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMUS PRIME is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also=\r\n is knocked into the beam and his repair process begins.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (O=\r\nOC: This is the scene from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the bots and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncons fell to earth and 4 million years had passed.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The sce=\r\nne fades to black.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;These sequence of cannot be disrupted.&quot;=\r\n LEGACY intoned coldly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Without the Autobots none of you would be =\r\nhere.&quot; LEGACY turned back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to face STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;And without the D=\r\necepticon&#39;s attack on the Ark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Autobots will not survive.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LEGACY folded his arms behind his back, &quot;There can be no disrupt=\r\nion of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time flow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There was a small beep on LE=\r\nGACY&#39;s panel causing him to look over at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it. &quot;Interesting.&quot; He said=\r\n curiously. &quot;It would seem that I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; required on the bridge.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
