A quick calculation gave him a true \nestimation of the size.\n\n&quot;NOW!&quot; Rodimus said as he leaped up from their place of waiting and began to \nrun towards the shield, he holding the device in his hand. Behind him Leo \nII, Wing Caliber and Ramulus were quickly behind him.\n\nWith a quick toss Rodimus sent his device hurtling towards the shield as he \nran up to it. &quot;Hurry, we have only a few seconds before the shielding \nadapts!&quot;\n\nInside the Ark\n\nAll of the medics, Legacy, Bump, Santon and Perceptor kept a vigil on \nNightlight, and for the moment her vitals continued to remain steady and \nstrong even in their sedated state â€“ her systems were stable and running \nunder their own power now.\n\nLegacy looked up, his optic sensor glowing strangely. &quot;Facinating&quot; he said \nas he stood up.\n\n&quot;What is it?&quot; Bump said as he looked over at Legacy, alarm creeping onto his \nface and into his voice.\n\n&quot;I am detecting a distant seismic disturbance.&quot; Legacy said after a moment \nof contemplation.\n\nSanton looked at Nightlight as if half expecting this to be affecting her. \n&quot;Where is it coming from?&quot; he said as he now turned to Legacy, for the \nmoment confident that this seemed to have no affect on their patient.\n\nLegacy paused for a moment as if examining his internal records. &quot;Unknown&quot; \nhe said finally. &quot;I would need full access to the Ark&#39;s sensors.&quot; Legacy \nlooked back at Santon and Bump, &quot;However if this is indeed a result of \nPerceptor&#39;s destruction of his former base then the exlosion was truly \nmassive on a large scale.&quot;\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs Legacy and the others talked, the voice that was speaking to Elita \ncontinued talking, &quot;Elita. I am hurt, badly hurt.&quot; It sounded like Lord \nElder still, but the voice was steadily getting weaker.\n\nThere was the sound of crawling and shuffling. &quot;I was ambushed and knocked \nunconscious.&quot; The voice paused, &quot;Elita, where are you?&quot;\n\n\nWith the Maximals on the way back to the Ark!\n\n&gt; &quot;Noctorro, Torca, I&#39;ve regained sixty percent of my energy reserve.\n&gt; It should be enough for me to drive on my own now. I thank you\n&gt; deeply for your assistance, and wish not to burden you any further.\n&gt; After all, towing a vehicle my size and weight, must put quite a strain\n&gt; on your systems. I&#39;d rather not see that happen.&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot; Torca said in deep tones. &quot;We are always here for the Maximals \nand you Autobots.&quot; His tone was grave.\n\nTorca and Bantor who had been the actual ones to help pull began to come to \na slow halt. They were not fast as most vehicles go, but they were large \nenough. Bantor was perhaps fully the size of a large jungle cat, but Torca \nwas as large as a woolly mammoth and looked strong enough to pull Tuscon by \nhimself if necessary.\n\nLooking up Torca spoke to Noctorro, &quot;You and Quicksilver get back to the \nArk. I think we have this under control, the Ark is the most important thing \nnow.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sir!&quot; They both said in unison as they both began flying off in the \ndirection of the Ark.\n\n(OOC: The Maximals might notice now that communications are no longer being \nblocked. They can communicate with each other as well as the Ark.)\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
