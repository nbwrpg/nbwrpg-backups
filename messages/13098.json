She stopped about 10 \nfeet inside the ship.  Her instincts told her she had arrived at the \nplace where she was supposed to be at.  She looked around with a \nlittle amazement in her eyes.

It was charred, had holed in the walls, falling \napart.  She said in a soft voice,&quot;What happened here?&quot; She didn&#39;t \neven realize she had spoken aloud. She was transfixed on the ship.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Ramulus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus nods. &quot;Allright, I&#39;ll show you where they are,&quot; he says, \ntransforming \n&gt; into robot mode and walking off toward the Ark.\n\n\n"}}
