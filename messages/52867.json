Anyway, here I am, back once \nmore. Crawling back has become typical of me. Well, this time I&#39;m \nback for a few reasons. They are below if any of you want to read. I \ndoubt you do, but this is my post and I will type what I want to.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1: nWo is 4 life.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2: Azure wrote me this pretty little letter and cheered me up.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3: Rudra didn&#39;t respond to my teasing RPG posts and I wasn&#39;t having \nfun anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4: Cardhead didn&#39;t reply to the Boogerman post. Thanks, buddy!\n&gt; \n&gt; 5: Saliva&#39;s &quot;Always&quot; is awesome. That&#39;s not a reason, but I believe \nit to be fact.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6: This RPG can&#39;t live without me. Don&#39;t say it can, because I like \nto think it can&#39;t. Shut up.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7: Wrestlers shouldn&#39;t get so mad. If I got any madder I&#39;d be like \nHHH, and that&#39;s definitely not a good thing. I have to make it to \nreason 8 I can say I have a Megaman total. (GEEK ALERT)\n&gt; \n&gt; 8: I like wasting the time of the innocent with worthless posts \nlike these. Yeah, I wasted your time if you read down this far. Oh, \nnot quite. There&#39;s a reward for your patience provided you did not \nclick delete as you read this. It&#39;s 1 million dollars plus a bomb. \nOh, never mind. I&#39;m sorry, people, this post was my cry for \nattention! It&#39;s because I don&#39;t know how to say that NBW is part of \nwho I am now, despite all of the random outbursts of rage. Oops, I \nguess I just did. I&#39;m high on no-sleep right now, forgive this shit. \nThanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Mister Zeeryo\n\n\n"}}
