Thank you.)\n\n* Dinobot snarled at Cyber Claw as she refused to transform and prove him correct, the snarl soon developing into a growl as it died from his throat.\nThis was absurd as well as annoying and it was going to stop...NOW! He was sick of this stupid game that this stranger had them all playing, trying to make them believe that it was the real Dinobot when the spark signature and the scent were against it already...it&#39;s body deceiving it before it even had began.\nHe then took a few more steps towards the stranger but this time there was no reasonable sentence from his mouth that was trying to convince the others that he was whom his signature identified him as, there was only the cold realization that there was only one more way to get this bot to transform and he was just about to use it. Brute force!\nIn order for this stranger to survive it would have to trasform if he attacked it, not enough power in it&#39;s beast mode to beat him back if he was bent on killing it.\nBut Dinobot had heard Cyber Claws claim that he was to get back or be ripped to shreds, a feat that could not be accomplished without her transforming...not to mention the cold fact that it it would be very difficult to defeat him in any mode.\nHe bared his teeth at the imposing bot as he then took another step, completely ignoring the fact that Striker and Tavatron had placed themselves between the stranger and himself in order to prevent this but at the moment he was a bit to pissed off to give a nano.\nDinobot&#39;s tail thrashed behind him and nearly hit striker but he knew where the Maximal was and knew not to hit him, his optics were trained on Cyber Claw...only 5 feet away from him now due to his advances.\nHis voice cold and harsh...*\n\n&quot; Transform or die! The choice is yours to make.&quot;\n\n* If this bot did transform then he would simply stand down but not before he gave it a through thrashing for imitating him, but if it did not then he would simply slag it, thus, causing it to transform in order to save it&#39;s own life.\nDinobot then stopped and glared straight at Cyber Claw as he then locked the two claws on his hands in a position that would be convenient to slash across the stranger&#39;s neck and end it&#39;s life...quick and painless.\nHe was sick of all of this and if threatening this bots life solved the problem then so be it, but in a way he knew that it would make up some sort of excuse that he was some clone trying to destroy it in order to take the name that was really his!\nDinobot snarled loudly and deeply as he then bunched his muscles to give his body strength if they were to slash at the stranger, it was time to prove this bot wrong...the cost would be it&#39;s life if not.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
