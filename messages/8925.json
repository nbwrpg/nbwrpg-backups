I&#39;m sure you have an interesting life (sitting in a chair \nand hoping for a girl all day could be interesting, I guess), so go and live \nit, and stop bothering the rest of us.\n\nAnd everyone, please cut down the number of irrelevant OOC mails (Get a life \nincluded). If you don&#39;t like the beach, SoulStice, have Sinister argue \nthrough IC, not OOC.\n\nTo rskieper@..., you can set eGroups not to send you any mail, and read \nit at egroups.com/messages/nbwrpg, so your account doesn&#39;t get millions of \nemails.\n\nEveryone that still wants to argue, there is a message board on the site, \nalong with a chat room, both of which were put up for OOC purposes that have \nnothing or little to do with the RPG (like &quot;I&#39;m an idiot who doesn&#39;t have a \nlife but wants everyone else to get one&quot; (Crow Lord)).\n\n"}}
