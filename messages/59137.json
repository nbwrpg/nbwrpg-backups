Her power cells recharged as they \nalways did when she slept.  She awoke to the sound of the alarm going \noff from her trip lazars.  She jumped and looked around.  She saw a \nlarge animal. It was about 6 and a half feet tall. Massive branch \nlike things sticking out of it&#39;s large elongated head.  It&#39;s legs \nwere very long and very thin. It had dark brown skin and fur.  What \nshe saw was a moose, but since she had never seen one before, it \nlooked like a monster. It was larger than her, but she knew she could \ntake on anything she had seen so far in the woods.  She reset her \nlittle alarm system and laid back down and went to sleep. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras picked up the signal of new comoer and he sent StarStorm to \n&gt; find out what&#39;s going\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
