He starts his repairing sequence, leaving\nhim weaker. He fires a single missile at Flesh Ripper. (PS, where did you\nget that odd name from?)\n\n&gt; Ares turned his turret, bring all four cannons to point a little ways to\nthe\n&gt; side of the area of the Mafia base he had been firing on.  He fired four\n&gt; shots from each cannon, a total of sixteen shots lancing out at the Mafia\n&gt; base.\n\nSerge watched as the shots pummelled the base, the base&#39;s alarm got louder\nby the second. Serge wanted it to shut up bad. He stepped in front of Ares\npath and fires 4 missiles. 2 from each shoulder cannon.\n\n&gt; Minion yelled out as autogun fire dug into his foot.  Raising his rifle,\nhe\n&gt; fired off 25 explosive shells at the Mafia base.\n\n(Is it just me, or is everybody out to destroy the damn base? Pardon me.\nHeh.) The base lost a large autogun, they had 2 left as the larger autoguns\nfired at Minion is retaliaton and lock on targeting.\n\n\n"}}
