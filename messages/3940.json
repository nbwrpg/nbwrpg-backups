The mighty \noptimal Optimus delivered his orders.\n\n&quot;Brix Prime, you are to take you crew to the Neo Beast Wars. With the \nadded 10 people we will finaly stop Hell Beast.&quot;(Optimus is unaware \nof the peace treaty being implimented.)\n\n&quot;Yes sir! We will leave immediatly!&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nThe young Maximal Octociz was saying good-bye to everyone he cared \nabout. He was going to war. A war he might not return from. He looks \nat their faces one more time, and boards his ship. the Mirorition. \nHis captain, Brix Prime is there, and all of his buddies. They are \nvery chummy today. They don&#39;t know if they will be back.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; said Brix.\n\nAnd so the Mirorition pulled out from Cybertron, starting there \njourney. After a few days of space and time travelling, they finaly \nsaw it. The place where the Wars are being held. Suddenly, there was \na problem.\n\n&quot;The ship isn&#39;t steering correctly, sir!&quot;\n\n&quot;Probebly the preds fidling with us. Where are we headed?&quot;\n\n&quot;Right for the moon!!&quot;\n\n&quot;Brace for impact!&quot;\n\nThe ship crashed right into the moon, causing much damade. Most of \nthe crew was killed on impact. The only survivors were Brix Prime, \nOctociz and another maximal named Gekkidama. Brix immediatly took \ncontrol.\n\n&quot;To the stasis pods!&quot;\n\nOn the run, a barrier fell right onto gekkidama. They tried to lift \nit, but they saw the damage. In a few moments, Gekkidama had died. \nThey aid good-bye and than left for the pods.\n\nOnce they got there, only one of them had not been fried. Brix \noptided to give it to Octociz.\n\n&quot;I must stay with my ship. It is more important to get you to safety. \nI will start building a minture ship from scrap parts here, and maybe \nyou can launch a rescue mission. I will be fine.&quot;\n\nSo Octociz said good-bye and hoped into the pod. Brix launched him, \nand there he was travelling towards earth, the only one out of the 10 \non the Mirorition. In a short time his pod landed, but in the water! \nAfter all this strugling, he would still die from rusting. than he \nremembered something Brix told him.\n\n&quot;Earth has different conditions that our robot modes cannot take. We \nwil be changing them so that we may function.&quot;\n\nThe pod starting a scanning process, and soon he began to feel the \nchanges. When he was done and got out of the pod, he found he liked \nthe water. He had 8 slimy arms and a bulging out head. He knew it \nall. He swam up to the surface, lept into the air and transformed to \nBeast mode. He was Octociz the Octopus, the Maximal, and he was here \nto fight the Neo Beast Wars. He ran off in search of the other \nmaximals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DarkMouse::\n&gt; She turned and walked down the hallway.
