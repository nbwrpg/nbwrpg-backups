Either he has someone who=\r\n has injured him in the\n&gt; past that he can then humiliate for the purposes =\r\nof revenge, or he has\n&gt; himself a capable assistant if his reprogramming ha=\r\ns gone.  I would see few\n&gt; other ways of resources that we all would indulg=\r\ne in.  To humiliate one who\n&gt; had wronged us or to indulge in the irony of =\r\ntheir remaking.  There are\n&gt; fewer things more..  Predacon to be done.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Perahps, ironically, unaware that was a reason for his own resurrection.\n&gt;=\r\n &quot;But, I would like to find out how he gathered himself a new protoform and=\r\n\n&gt; located her regardles sto remake and reprogram without the rest of us\n&gt; =\r\nknowing.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; At tihs point, DINOBOT walked along with SKYSHADOW and FRA=\r\nCTYL to his\n&gt; sides.  Speaking quietly to SKY SHADOW.  &quot;What I Wonder is wh=\r\ny he so readily\n&gt; cooperates.  My..  Files on him are rather limited, but I=\r\n do recall there\n&gt; was little love lost between him and..  Our Lord.&quot;  DINO=\r\nBOT&#39;s immediate\n&gt; loyalties to HYDRAS rather htan the one who had made him.=\r\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a thoughtful pause from SKY SHADOW as he looked at DINOB=\r\nOT,\n=93I have been wondering that one myself.=94 He said quietly. =93He mus=\r\nt\nhave an agenda of his own, but so far he has been very closed lipped\nabou=\r\nt it.=94\n\nFRACTYL walked along quietly just listening; obviously his mind w=\r\nas on\nother things. The social intrigues of Predacon life was not his\ntypic=\r\nal interest.\n\n=93Perhaps that is why Tarantulus chose this moment to reveal=\r\n her.=94\nSKYSHADOW said. =93She may be able to get closer to Hydras or Cryo=\r\ntek\nthen he could.=94\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Her search upon CRYOTEK =\r\ngave her enough to go on.  Enough to, in her state\n&gt; of vassaldom, to be aw=\r\nare that something didn&#39;t fit.  &quot;He&#39;s come from..  The\n&gt; future, as we did.=\r\n  But I would gather further along.  So what has he seen\n&gt; there?  And he h=\r\nardly seems the sort to accept a double cross so readily.\n&gt; Much less to gi=\r\nve usch resources over to HYDRAS.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pausing, and then going over the rat=\r\nher..  Minimal data they had of his base\n&gt; of operations, &quot;So, just what ex=\r\nactly do you know he is pursuing?  And\n&gt; consider me..  Surprised you&#39;re co=\r\noperating again with Megatron yourself.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTARANTULUS sighed as he lo=\r\noked at BLACKARACHNIA, for a moment his\ninsanity falling away to reveal the=\r\n true malevolent intellect that\ndrove him. =93Sometime we must all do thing=\r\ns that we don=92t want to do\ndear to survive. As for CRYOTEK, that is why y=\r\nou are here, find out\nwhat you can.=94\n\nAnd then HYDRAS approached. TARANTU=\r\nLUS gave BLACKARACHNIA a knowing\nlook before he turned to face HYDRAS.\n\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nOLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras:: &quot;Deal, my tutor&quot;hissed Hydras with a smile and added to h=\r\nid comlink\n&gt; &quot;Inferno, report?&quot; The Hydras came in the room and looking at =\r\nboth spiders\n&gt; said harshly&quot;TArantulus how did you explain this... unusual =\r\nand non\n&gt; autorized Project????&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nCRYOTEK nodded as he followed behi=\r\nnd HYDRAs, seemingly content to walk\nin his student=92s shadow, his malevol=\r\nent optics staring balefully into\nthe room.\n\nThere was a dark and wicked ch=\r\nuckled from TARANTULUS, his apparent\nbout of lucidity gone in an instant as=\r\n he turned to face HYDRAS, =93She\nis my project. I found her, I built her a=\r\nnd now I have restored her to\nthe perfection that she was meant to be.=94\n\n=\r\nTARANTULUS waved in the direction of BLACKARACNIA his hand going from\nher s=\r\nhoulders to her hand, displaying her in much the same way an\nartist might d=\r\nisplay his best most treasured piece of art. =93She is\neverything she was m=\r\neant to be and more.=94\n\nINFERNO who had been with HYDRAS up this point tur=\r\nned to him, I am here sir.=94\n\nOOC: I am sorry. Inferno never left Hydras&#39; =\r\nside, unless there was a\ncommand that Hydras gave that I missed? I just for=\r\ngot to mention him\nin the last post of two, but that was an over sight on m=\r\ny part :)\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
