Although he had cleared a majority of them, there were still others t=\r\no contend with.  But with fear of draining too much energy in vehicle mode,=\r\n to power the missile cannons, he relies on hand to hand combat, and prepar=\r\nes to go against the sweeps by relying on his Ninjabot skills, rather than =\r\nfire power, to preserve his energy.  He would now use his own body as a shi=\r\neld and weapon.\n\n&quot; I copy that Rodimus.  Now, let&#39;s see if the sweeps are b=\r\nrave enough to face me one on one.&quot;\n\nGracefully, he puts his body into comb=\r\nat position, taking all the stances of a skilled Ninja warrior.  He concent=\r\nrates on listening to what&#39;s around him.\n\n&quot;Talon, Lord Elder, they&#39;re close=\r\n, watch your backs and your surroundings.&quot;\n\nFrom where Straight Shot and Ku=\r\np are, Straight Shot too, hears the enemy closing in, as she relays the dat=\r\na back to Kup.\n\n&quot;Woahh, they&#39;re onta us!  Talk about leading ants to a pick=\r\nnic!&quot;\n\nNight Shift now gets into combat position, and draws out a few plasm=\r\na revolvers.\n\n&quot;Scrap!  Things are definitely gonna get ugly out here.  And =\r\nI hate ta say it but we&#39;re outnumbered and unless we get creative, we&#39;re hi=\r\nstory.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot replies while in Kup&#39;s grip.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s right Kup, I thi=\r\nnk I need to switch ammo to EMP charged arrowheads.  That might be able to =\r\nhelp throw the remaining sweeps off their afterburners, and it&#39;s the only c=\r\nhance we got of actually evading disaster out here.&quot;\n\nShe takes a moment to=\r\n callibrate her auto loading system to pick up the EMP arrowheads.\n\n&quot;Okay, =\r\nlocked&#39;n loaded.  It&#39;s up to you now, Kup.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Rat Trap is quick t=\r\no find a tiny hole to disappear into, as he points to it while still with W=\r\nindlord.\n\n&quot;Psst, follow me Windlord, over there, see?  That hole.  We can f=\r\nit and they can&#39;t.  When in doubt, hide it out.&quot;\n\nBack at the Ark, Quickstr=\r\nide is on top alert, as he sees the wave of energy pass by.  He&#39;s quick to =\r\nget into robot mode at the sight of it.\n\n&quot;Woahh hello!  What the scrap was =\r\nthat?!  Rodimus, we got activity out here, of an unknown origin!  I saw som=\r\ne energy waves, but nothing positive to identify!  Whatever it is, it&#39;s inv=\r\nisible, and it&#39;s using some sort of cloaking device ta maneuver!  I&#39;m gonna=\r\n attempt to get a fix on it.&quot;\n\nHe quickly dashes down to where he had seen =\r\nthe waves, and keeps alert with his cannon aimed over his shoulder.\n\n&quot;Come =\r\nout, come out wherever you are....  You can&#39;t hide behind an invisible barr=\r\nier for too long, without running out of energy....&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As Tuscon began pro=\r\njecting his powerful Sonar waves into the air, the affect\n&gt; on the sweeps i=\r\ns immediate and obvious as they begin flying in different\n&gt; directions, it =\r\nis as if they are nearly blind!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It is some sort of disruptor wave.&quot; O=\r\nne of the sweeps grunts, they are\n&gt; close enough for Tuscon to at least hea=\r\nr, even if he cannot see them via his\n&gt; sensors. The sweeps looked almost d=\r\nrunk as they tried to swing higher into\n&gt; the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seemed to be hav=\r\ning an impact on the sweeps that Kup and Straightshot\n&gt; were dealing with a=\r\ns well. In an explosion of flames another falls from the\n&gt; skies, while tra=\r\niling behind it a rather large plume of smoke.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***********************=\r\n******************\n&gt; \n&gt; The remaining three sweeps come together trying to =\r\nstay out of range of\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s waves of disruption, but another is knocked=\r\n from the skies by\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s missiles. The remaining two circle around, fi=\r\nring laser beams down\n&gt; at the Maximals!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile at the tower as Win=\r\ndlord and Rat Trap watched the tower began to\n&gt; rumble, and a large door op=\r\nened in its side, like some great jaw or perhaps\n&gt; some ancient draw bridge=\r\n part of the base&#39;s wall itself began to separate\n&gt; from the rest and lower=\r\n itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; From inside the base several figures could be seen flying out=\r\n! Deepstryke in\n&gt; his cannon mode rose from the base, followed quickly by P=\r\nhobia in jet mode\n&gt; and several more sweep. They began to move away from th=\r\ne base in the\n&gt; direction of Tuscon and Kup.\n&gt; \n&gt; The door to the base bega=\r\nn to close.\n&gt; \n&gt; *****************************************\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile b=\r\nack at the Ark Rodimus received Tuscon&#39;s message. &quot;Gotcha.&quot; He\n&gt; said as he=\r\n quickly began to fortify the Ark&#39;s shielding. &quot;Shield at 100%&quot; he\n&gt; said t=\r\no Tuscon.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Quickstride!&quot; Rodimus said over the radio, &quot;Keep an optic o=\r\nut, from what\n&gt; Tuscon is telling me the battle is getting bad out there.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile in the skies above Quickstride a small ripple appeared for a=\r\n\n&gt; moment. Perhaps it was a bit of air displaced by heat, or perhaps it was=\r\n\n&gt; something more.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
