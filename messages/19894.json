Requesting \npermission to enter. I am heavily damaged and need to speak with the \nleader.&quot;\n\n&quot;Granted,&quot; Kluster replies, &quot;I&#39;m Kluster, the ship&#39;s captain, I&#39;m at \nthe entrance if what you need to say is urgent.&quot;\n\nThe hatch opens behind Kluster, Shredder limping in. He was leaking \nmechfluid, and had dents and scorch marks all over his torso.\n\n&quot;The Destrons,&quot; he says, breathing a bit heavily as he leans against \na wall, &quot;They&#39;re gonna destroy the Maximals. I got away to warn you, \nbut they nearly kill me.&quot;\n\nKluster frowns and taps a few buttons on the console he was near, \nchecking the position of the Destrons. &quot;They and the Predacons are \nhelping us rebuild the Ark.&quot;\n\n&quot;They&#39;re allied,&quot; Shredder says, his face turning from weary to \nserious. He was making things up, but he wanted Cerebrus \ndead, &quot;They&#39;ll get in good with your group, find out stuff about your \nship, and then backstab you. I&#39;d know, I used to be a Predacon, and \nthen a Destron. Its normal procedure.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus stops a few miles away from the Alliance base, his scanners \nreporting gunfire. He activates his comm-link, sending a transmission \nto the CF.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m at the Alliance base,&quot; he says, &quot;Should I ask Zardus for his \nhelp?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProto lands at the Cybertronian Fire, passing Shredder, Kluster, \nChild, and Galvatron and heading toward the CR chambers.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRex groans, nearly falling out of a CR chamber as the door opens. He \nwas repaired, but his head hurt like the pit from the gas that \nBrightBlade had gotten him with.\n\nHe stumbles out of the CR room, heading for his quarters.\n\n&quot;Kluster,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;I think the Predacon female \nthat infultrated the ship has gotten away. She might have info on the \nship, I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m gonna take a rest, I&#39;ll be in my quarters if \nanything comes up.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler lands at the Cybertronian Fire, entering and looking at \nKluster and the group of bots around him.\n\n&quot;Mangus says that the Alliance is trying to destroy time,&quot; he says to \nKluster, &quot;I say we get Zardus&#39; opinion on this.&quot;\n\nKluster nods. Too many things were happening at once, he didn&#39;t like \nthis. He recieves Ramulus&#39; message, replying to it.\n\n&quot;Yeah, tell Zardus I really need to meet with him at the Cybertronian \nFire. This is turning out to be very confusing.&quot;\n\nHe taps a few keys on the console, bringing up a list of Predacons. \nHis eyes narrow as he sees the name Megatron, tapping a few keys.\n\n&quot;Megatron would be glad to help in Maximal destruction,&quot; he mutters \nto himself, looking through scan logs. He recieves Rex&#39;s \ntransmission, not bother to decide. If the Predacons had info on the \nCybertronian Fire, they were a definite threat. Maybe the act at the \nArk was a trick after all..\n\nBehind Kluster, Shredder watches the screen over Kluster&#39;s shoulder. \nThe Maximal in front of him seemed to be lost in thought. Shredder \nsmiles to himself. His plan was working.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Logo, did Firearm&#39;s attempt at getting Spears&#39; spark temporarily \ninto the machine succeed?)\n\n\n"}}
