It is known only as The Plague.  \nIt&#39;s effects \n&gt; are both swift and deadly.  Fortunately it&#39;s deadliness eventually \nkilled it \n&gt; off enough for those of my time to develop a vaccine.  \nUnfortunately she is \n&gt; from a few decades before my time.  She doesn&#39;t appear to be \ninfected \n&gt; however.&quot;  He pauses for a moment.  &quot;There were rumored accounts, \nnothing was \n&gt; ever confirmed mind you, but I have heard stories of carriers.  \nSome have \n&gt; been infected but survive without symptoms for some unknown \nreason.  There is \n&gt; a way to test.&quot;  He thinks to himself for a moment.  &quot;First, if \nWindlord \n&gt; hasn&#39;t been bitten, get him out of there.  There&#39;s something in the \nbite that \n&gt; transmits the disease.  Then I need to borrow an expendable \nmaintenance \n&gt; drone.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
