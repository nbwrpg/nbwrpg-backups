She landed the \nship and came out.\n\nMelchana: Daemos said the vines should be here somewhere... now \nwhere... oh... I see...\n\nOn her left, a massive techno-organic vineyard stood. The fruits it \nbore were ripe, full of energon and ready to be harvested. Melchana \ntook out a large cargo hold from the ship. She started cutting the \nenergon fruits with her arm blades. In a few mega-cycles she COULD be \nover...\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDaemos: Now Belthassan, I have to tell you about the harvesting \nmission. First though, you must assure me you will tell no one.\n\nBelthassan: I agree, but it is not without an afterthought.\n\nDaemos: That is fine for me. We are to bring back the energon to \nRaiko-fhi 8 for weaponry loading.\n\nBelthassan: Raiko-fhi 8? You mean the institute? Why is that?\n\nDaemos: I am sorry, friend... It seems our lords have had more trust \nin me than in you... It is wasteful, I think... That is why they told \nme the great lines of the plan. You have heard of the prototype Matrix \nweapons, did you not?\n\nBelthassan thought for a moment. Matrix weaponry? It did sound \nfamiliar but... No... There was no way. He dropped his jaw in awe.\n\nBelthassan: Why was I never told? What uses will this have?\n\nDaemos: Do not worry. It will be reserved for the Homeworlds for now. \nI doubt we will have access to these soon.\n\nBelthassan: But the Matrix is not a toy, and even less a weapon! You \nknow it as much as I do! Why would they even consider this?\n\nDaemos hardened himself.\n\nDaemos: Behave, captain! These answers are not mine to give, and we \nare not in any position to discuss orders! Deal with what you have!\n\nFor the first time on this planet, Belthassan transformed into a big \npolar bear and went wordlessly to the Matrix chamber, angry at the \nfew things he just learned.\n\n\n"}}
