At least \nnot\n&gt; &gt; you. (He was staring hard at Maxima) You must understand that in \nno\n&gt; &gt; way you can be left alone, and seeing that you are former \ncomrades, \n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; simply can&#39;t do that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Although he doesn&#39;t like it, he stays near the two decepticons.\n&gt; \n&gt; She glared at the intruding if not unwelcome transformer. Then \nturned \n&gt; back to Empath.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the two discussed, a bit too far for Blackfang to hear, Ragnar \n&gt; came\n&gt; &gt; up a small hill and overheard the conversation. He decided not to \ndo\n&gt; &gt; anything about and kept the info for himself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Instead, he went back a few meters downhill and stomped on a \nnearby\n&gt; &gt; log, utterly shattering it. They would hear him.\n&gt; \n&gt; She heard him alright. This annoyed her a lot. Sneering at the \n&gt; interloper. She had a feeling that her quest to restore herself \nwould \n&gt; not be easy by any means.\n\nHaving sensed Ragnar&#39;s presence long before she heard him, Empath \ndecided the best place to hide was right out in the open.  She knew \nthe Ghost Bear had overheard.  &quot;I don&#39;t see what you&#39;re complaining \nabout, Maxima.&quot; she says.  &quot;They scrapped your old, highly \ninefficient body in favor of a top-of-the-line model.  I&#39;m quite \nhappy the way I am now.  But, if you really want to find Teletran-1, \nbe wary.  The Tripredacus forces would gain even more of an advantage \nthen they have already if the Ark were destroyed, and they know \nthis.  You must be careful not to lead them to it by accident.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
