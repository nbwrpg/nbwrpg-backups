To you it may seem=\r\n like failure, to me, yes, it was a mistake but also a learning experience.=\r\n Learn not to go too fast, yet make decisions carefully.

Big deal, happens all the tim=\r\ne.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson then looks to Cyclonus, yes, he had looked as he had before=\r\n he had lost his sight. It didn&#39;t surprise him though. He had see and been =\r\nthrough worse.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m sorry Cyclonus, there are no secrets to share wit=\r\nh you.

You have me and now you have =\r\nnothing to fear from the outside world, because your main threat is now in =\r\nyour possession. Think about it, what can they do? They&#39;re no threat to you=\r\n at all.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Night Shift nodds in agreement to his commander&#39;s statement.=\r\n Tucson looks to all his comrades before having to be separated from them.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Kup, I did not intend to put your spark in danger, and for that I am =\r\ndeeply sorry.

Well, until Hydras sends his goons out ta find us which is probably what=\r\n&#39;ll happen.... Ooohh, bean pods...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Again he thinks of nothing but foo=\r\nd and begins to munch on the bean pods.

He looked at =\r\nNightshift, &quot;Is this what you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meant by get it?&quot; he said, the sarcasm =\r\nthick in his voice. &quot;I think we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; got it then, yes we did.&quot; he chuckled=\r\n at his own joke.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As all this was going on the doors slid open =\r\nand Cyclonus stood there,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weapon drawns and optics darting around the=\r\n room. The cyclonus that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stood there, while familiar to most, was ver=\r\ny different from the last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time Tuscon had seen him before he lost his=\r\n sight. This Cyclonus was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little taller and sleeker, even in his ro=\r\nbot mode his lined and form\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bespoke speed and aerodynamics. He seemd =\r\nlarger and more imposing than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when he last stood before him, his armo=\r\nr thicker and more resilliant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than when he was a simple lacky for Gal=\r\nvatron. It is as if he had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grown into something more than what he was=\r\n, even his spark no longer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; registered as pure Decepticon, there was t=\r\nhat aspect that was always\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unicronian, however on his chest was embla=\r\nzed the purple symbol of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Decepticon forces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Upon seei=\r\nng the turn of events Cyclonus nodded satisfactorilly as he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; turned to=\r\n Hydras, &quot;What ever wave that was from Tuscon awakened\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jhiaxus from s=\r\ntassis. He has the security section secured.&quot; He turned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his gaze on T=\r\nuscon, &quot;We will have to have it analyzed to see what ever\n&gt; &gt; &gt; defence to =\r\nit can be mounted.

Because right now, I&#39;m just gonna =\r\nhave ta call ya Hot Rod. There \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ain&#39;t no Prime in there that I can s=\r\nee. Nope, not at all. Not one trace. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; There, I said my peace, and no=\r\nw I&#39;m gonna do as told.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Tucson Prime does nothing to rebel a=\r\ngainst orders. Yet, he listens to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Night Shift carefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &quot; All right Hydras, ball is in your court. I will comply to your demand=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as you wish.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly=\r\n2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight ga=\r\nsped in terror\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From: Preston Carroll\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Se=\r\nnt: Tuesday, April 13, 2010 11:32 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: BlackFortress\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Who: =\r\nSCOURGE, SCORPONOK, Hydras, Darkhawk, Perceptor, Nightshift,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Tusco=\r\nn Prime, Kup, Rodimus, Nightlight\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Location: Black Fortress - Thron=\r\ne Room\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Scourge, who had never been affected by the disrup=\r\ntor wave from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Tuscon, quite probrably because he is of minion desi=\r\ngn rather then\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just decepticon, just watched, unsure of what to do=\r\n. His optics blazed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with repressed anger as he looked from Hydras =\r\nto Tuscon and back, his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; finger quivering on the trigger of his wea=\r\npon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Scorponok on the other hand, after having been brush=\r\ned aside so\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; casually by Tuscon, now stood with his weapons oriente=\r\nd at the Autobot\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; leader, ready to fire his own barrage of weapons.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However what is of more concern is the internal weaponry=\r\n, the wall\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mounted cannons that oriented, not just on Tuscon but a=\r\nlso the other\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; maximals and Autobots in the room.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n A voice came over the loud speakers could be heard, however to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; surprise of many it was not Cyclonus&#39; but one that was somehow deeper\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; and yet colder at the same time, it was Jhiaxus. &quot;It would appear\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; Tuscon Prime that your assessment of the situation is not as it would=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; seem.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Entering this base without preperation,=\r\n and leading your back up in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; here without assesing the true odds a=\r\ngainst you was a tactical flaw on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your part.&quot; The voice continued =\r\ncoldly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;If you do anything other than follow the very sp=\r\necific orders of our\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; leader Hydras, I will have the entire arsonal=\r\n of this facility open\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fire on you.&quot; The energy cannons that were =\r\nin the room began to glow\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as they prepared for action, &quot;You will c=\r\nomply.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Unfortunately it was at this point that Rodimus s=\r\nhowed up with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight, &quot;AH SLAG&quot; Rodimus said as he took in the=\r\n situation . . .\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
