Your probably wondering where the hell \nI&#39;ve \n&gt; been. Ya see, I&#39;m in the process of moving and my internet has \nbeen \n&gt; cut off, as well as cable tv...*sigh* Anyway I havn&#39;t been able to \n&gt; get on and do anything in any RPG, forum or anything else I&#39;m \n&gt; involved with online. I&#39;m only on now because I managed to get on \na \n&gt; friends comp. Hopefully I&#39;ll be online soon after the move. It&#39;s \n&gt; going to be a few weeks though. If you havn&#39;t done something \nalready \n&gt; with my charrs then the other council members should take them. If \n&gt; you feel you need to find a council replacment for me then do so. \nI \n&gt; miss RPing and everyone here. Untill next time NBW. Peace!\n&gt; \n&gt; ~RoboRick\n\n\n"}}
