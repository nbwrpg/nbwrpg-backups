I \n  &gt; =\r\n  &gt;   came across \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; a post talking about Neo beast Wars RPG.  I =\r\nhad\n  &gt;   &gt; been looking to join \n  &gt;   &gt;   an RPG, \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; but none o=\r\nf them interested me, until NBW.  When\n  &gt;   &gt; i joined, it was \n  &gt;   &gt;   =\r\njust a \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; mailing list.  Every day, people sent posts of\n  &gt;   &gt; =\r\nthe current list of \n  &gt;   &gt;   members.  \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Eventually, we became=\r\n part of egroups (now\n  &gt;   &gt; Yahoogroups), and were \n  &gt;   &gt;   able to \n  =\r\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; gain a much larger amount of members.  When i\n  &gt;   &gt; joined, the=\r\n council \n  &gt;   &gt;   was \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Yanshosh, Kslawdogg, JP3884, and Infer=\r\nno371. \n  &gt;   &gt; Soulstice was there \n  &gt;   &gt;   too, then \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; being=\r\n called &quot;code,&quot; much to his disliking.  The\n  &gt;   &gt; Maximals were led \n  &gt; =\r\n  &gt;   by Liono \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Prime, the Predacons by Hellbeast.  The Allianc=\r\ne\n  &gt;   &gt; was there, but it \n  &gt;   &gt;   was far \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; smaller.  And s=\r\no i began my long involvement.  I\n  &gt;   &gt; saw the tide turn \n  &gt;   &gt;   both=\r\n ways \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; in the war, and small custom factions spring up\n  &gt;   &gt; =\r\nand then disapear.  \n  &gt;   &gt;   I saw my \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; fair share of idiots (=\r\nahh Icedemon), but there\n  &gt;   &gt; were also some great \n  &gt;   &gt;   posters.  =\r\n\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; There was Dachande who started the Destrons,\n  &gt;   &gt; Logo, who=\r\n had the \n  &gt;   &gt;   hottest female \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; characters ever, my good fr=\r\niend shomin, with his\n  &gt;   &gt; psycho \n  &gt;   &gt;   religiousness, \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;=\r\n carnagedarkness, with (his/her? not sure) long,\n  &gt;   &gt; thinky posts with =\r\n\n  &gt;   &gt;   Dinobot, \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; and many others.  And let&#39;s not forget\n  &gt;=\r\n   &gt; Minime_316, this RPG&#39;s only \n  &gt;   &gt;   tragedy.  \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; For thos=\r\ne of you who don&#39;t know, Minime\n  &gt;   &gt; overdosed himself with \n  &gt;   &gt;   p=\r\nills.
