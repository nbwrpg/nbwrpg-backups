He then aims his charge launcher at Hellpeon and fires four \ncharges.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIncarcinator continues to fly up, dodging several blasts and firing a \nshot at the Trainer base (very fast, explosive shell). His gaining \naltitude allowed him to see most shots and dodge them before they got \nclose. Aiming at Hellpeon, Incarcinator fires two more shells at him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise continues to run, several autogun blasts denting the armor on \nhis back. He jumps behind a hill for cover, wishing that someone \nwould exit the ship so that he could tear them apart.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; They&#39;d be able to detect footprints in the sand unless he&#39;s flying \nbut\n&gt; they&#39;d only be able to guess where he&#39;d be.\n\n\n"}}
