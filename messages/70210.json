We were all\nfighting basically in a hallway, and that hallway was getting a might\nfull! Sending missiles into such a confined space was bound to have\ninteresting results, I thought this would be fun, plus it did get a\nchance to shake everyone up at the same time.\n\nEveryone that was in the fight, except those that were with Legacy\nshould be down in the large chamber below.\n\nI did this also to create persepctive. Keep in mind that the bots are\nactually in an extremely dangerous position. Nearly all the Predacons\nand Decepticons are here, while the bots are spread out. You have\nRodimus and Tuscon who are both Prime class, but you also have Hydras,\nJhiaxus and Cyclonus who are each one nearly the same strength.\n(Legacy is also nearly in that class as well) However as the cons have\nothers in the room: Deepstryke, Phobia, Nightrazor, Scourge, the bots\nonly have Nightshift. also the cons also had the internal base\ndefences firing as well, which made this whole battle interesting.\n\nHopefully this shake up will give the bots a chance to regroup and\ndecide what they are going to do while every one is recovering. If you\nwant to stay and fight that is cool, however with the odds, I would\nseriously recommend get out of there as quick as you can. If this was\na battle where we were using stats and rolling dice . . . well thing&#39;s\nwould probrably not end well :)\n\nAnyways, game on!\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
