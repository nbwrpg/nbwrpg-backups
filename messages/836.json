The last one, however, connected with her side. Tavatron clutched\nher\n&gt; injured side, the smell of burning fur filled her nostrils. Sometimes her\n&gt; beast mode was really annoying! She tried to stop the flow of mech-fluid,\n&gt; her ribs, still aching from the previous battle, were now broken again.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I am not weak!&quot; Tavatron crouched behind what remained of the boulder and\n&gt; waited until BrightBlade was at Gangon&#39;s side. She raised her head above\nthe\n&gt; boulder, charged her optic lasers to full power, and fired, this time\nmaking\n&gt; sure her aim was true.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Have you been a naughty girl?\n&gt; Click Here\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3662/7/_/_/_/957213224/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
