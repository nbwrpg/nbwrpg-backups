He would have been glad to be rid of this annoyance, yes, but =\r\nit would have been somewhat disappointing as well. \n=A0\nSo when Rodimus was=\r\n spun around by Tuscon, the Autobot may have missed the wicked smile on his=\r\n face, When Tuscon tried to=A0ram Rodimus into a wall, he may not have noti=\r\nced that the sound of crunching metal was not=A0Rodimus&#39; but the reinrorced=\r\n wall shearing and tearing under the force of the assault. It was not the s=\r\nound of=A0Rodimkus&#39; defeat that resonated through the room, but it was some=\r\nthing else!\n=A0\nMany of the same teachers that had instructed Tuscon had tr=\r\nained a young Hot Rod as well -=A0=A0Jazz, Prowl, Brawn, Kup, even Optimus =\r\nhimself! And while Rodimus no longer clearly remembered all these ones and =\r\nwhat they had meant to him, thier lessons were still ground into him, and h=\r\nis reflexes that had been honed over the years of battle! \n=A0\nAlso, this w=\r\nas no young Hot Rod that stood there before them, but a figure shapped by t=\r\nhe energy of the matrix into a character of leadership, power and ability. =\r\nHe no longer had access to the knowledge and wisdom of the matrix, the ener=\r\ngy having been stripped from him. But that power that had been imparted was=\r\n still there, reconfigured by the power of the predacon shell program!=A0He=\r\n was faster, stronger and far more durable then Hot Rod ever was,=A0he was=\r\n=A0DARK RODIMUS!\n=A0\nSo when Rodimus hit the wall it was not truely pain th=\r\nat he felt, but the elation that a true battle was in the making. He felt t=\r\nhat charge that all warriors felt when they faced a foe that had some metal=\r\n! It was an eagerness twisted by Predacon programming into something dark a=\r\nnd loathsome. \n=A0\nSo when he stood and turned around it was not defeat in =\r\nhis stance but derision, &quot;So you fancy yourself to be a Prime do you, scrap=\r\npling?&quot; Rodimus said=A0his tone still mocking as he raised his arm,=A0smili=\r\nng as his optics glowing with energy, &quot;Well let&#39;s see what you got!&quot; With a=\r\n thought he fired a blast of plasma energy from his arm mounted cannon at t=\r\nhis new incarnation of Tuscon, who for the moment appeared to be posturing =\r\nfor Hydras!\n=A0\nOOC: Remember, the matrix that is housed within Rodimus has=\r\n no energy of its own, only the housing. It does not have the power to reac=\r\nh out and transform anyone, although I do have some ideas. I am not sure if=\r\n you want to redo your post, or let it go as it stands. \n=A0\nPreston\n(Cyclo=\r\nnus/Scourge/Dark rodimus)\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
