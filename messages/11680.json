But of course, they weren�t about \nto let HER know that.\nHer shivers were getting worse and now, if anybot touched her, they would \nfeel her cold under their grasp.\nShe kept her eyes glued on Smokescreen, her arm reaching to him and pleading \nin her optics.\nWhat gullible fools these Maximals were, how easy it was to tamper with \ntheir emotions and minds.\nBrightBlade suddenly flinched, a pain washed over her but it wasn�t from her \nwounds�it was from her HEAD! She couldn�t figure it out; she hadn�t hit her \nhead or anything. Why should anything happen?\nShe put a hand on her temple and closed her eyes, swaying a bit from the \nsudden rush of nausea that passed over her.\nSomething was happening to her, something very strange.\nBrightBlade didn�t notice that Rex still had his weapon trained on her, and \nshe didn�t notice that she had taken Smokescreens hand and had slowly rose \nto her feet.\nBut she leaned against the wall with a shocked look on her face, not really \nknowing just what was happening.\nAll of a sudden she thought that she was a real Maximal when she had been a \nPredacon all her life, and she suddenly had the notion that the Maximal \nGrimmler loved her.\nShe almost found herself looking towards him with a slight bit of longing, \nwanting and wishing that he really did love her.\nBut then she shook her head and took in a beep breath, letting it out \nslowly.\nShe had to remember that she was a Predacon and not a Maximal, and that \nGrimmler could never love her.\nBut even as she thought this she felt the thoughts planted into her mind \nflare, becoming stronger then they had been before.\nBrightBlade leaned against the wall and let go of Smokescreens hand, finally \nlooking over towards Grimmler as he splashed water into his face.\nHe was rather handsome; she shook her head again.\nWhat was she thinking?! Was she going insane?!\nBut even as she looked away from him the feelings began to grow, becoming \neven stronger then they had been before.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
