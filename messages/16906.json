Something shocked her. She hissed and screamed at the \nsame time. But the scream didn&#39;t last long. \n\nShe opened her red optics again, sneering as she looked around. Below \non the ground was markings that wasn&#39;t of any race she knew of. She \nhad seen it before at certain artifacts. She just didn&#39;t know what \nthey ment.\n\nSomeone&#39;s head and face flashed in her mind. Cyber Claw hissed and \nshook her head. It appeared again. It was a male face, ancent \nlooking, with horns on the side of the head. The optics were dark. \nThe face kept steady behind her optics until he was constantly there. \n\nShe wondered.\n\n&quot;Are you Unicron?&quot; She had heard of tales.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; the burly voice of the head replied. &quot;I speak for the Vok.&quot;\n\n&quot;The Vok?&quot; she asked.\n\n&quot;You are of the decendant of the Decepticons,&quot; he said.\n\nCyber Claw hissed. &quot;I&#39;m not a decendant. I&#39;m a genetic creation. Line \nmeans nothing to me.&quot;\n\n&quot;Either way, you are of the Beast Wars.&quot;\n\n&quot;Was,&quot; she corrected him with a snarling voice. &quot;I quit Megatron. I \nquit the war! I am for my free self.&quot;\n\n&quot;A free agent,&quot; Unicron breathed. &quot;This will serve us well.&quot;\n\nCyber Claw spat. &quot;I serve no one! I serve myself until I am nothing \nleft but madness. Which I beleive I have already become. I am sister \nto The Wild.&quot;\n\n&quot;An invader that serves this planet. How interesting. You may become \na canidate for our project.&quot;\n\n&quot;Project? What Project?&quot;\n\n&quot;To rid of both Predacon and Maximal race that threaten this planet \nwith their wars.&quot; Cyber Claw listened carefully. It was true. Her \nforest was burt down because of the Predacons. \n\n&quot;Oh.&quot; She closed her optics. &quot;I want something out of this. I want a \nfavor.&quot; There was a pause. &quot;If I fail, or when your project is done, \nI want you to kill me. I have a past that haunts me and I cannot deal \nwith it no longer.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then you shall be relieved,&quot; Unicron said. &quot;There is one piece of \ninformation we must find that remains at the fringe. There was a \nPredacon that was chosen to be our servent. Find the truth of his \ndemise. The creature had power and armor that had potential to aid \nour Project.&quot;\n\nCyber Claw blinked. &quot;Well, who---&quot; She was cut off when flashes of \nimages of a small young Predacon male went across her head. He had a \nstrange build, a slim bluish green and gold face. He had a heavy \nchest, mismatched arms, large feet, and almost chilling wide optics. \nA strange beast mode that fit him. A scorpion with a tail of a cobra. \n\nVoices of females called out a name: Quickstrike. It were calls for \ndistress, looking for each other to find him.\n\nShe shook her head. &quot;All right. Anything to destroy my worthless \nlife.&quot; The wires let go, and she landed on her hands and feet into \nthe ground. She looked up. All was quiet. She frowned with her harsh \nface and walked into the section where she was first grabbed. On the \nstalactmites, faces of bots and some full figures were shown. A few \nshe recalled. She remembered Terrorsaur&#39;s, Rattrap&#39;s, Cheetor&#39;s, \nDinobot&#39;s reformated body, even Megatron. \n\nShe blinked.\n\n\n"}}
