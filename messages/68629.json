Quickly it shifted form and looked upward, its form and visage&lt;BR&gt;&gt; disturbingly familiar to those who know their history. The cyclopean&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gaze, the right arm sporting dual mounted cannons, the left arm that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; IS a cannon. Despite the color changes it looked like SHOCKBLAST!! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Who ever it is, it stood below them, and began to fire upwards at the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; incoming minion!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quickly the remaining three minions scatter!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Phobia shoots into the air and rolls to one side flying protectivly&lt;BR&gt;over where Deepstryke fell, her movements swift and sure, but there is&lt;BR&gt;a slight note of panic in them!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tumult and Decibel on the other hand streak in flying right at the&lt;BR&gt;black\n and crimson figure, a full spread of missiles launching from each&lt;BR&gt;of them. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thier missiles land with stupifying power and the ground cracks as&lt;BR&gt;multiple explosions pit thier force against it. Yet out of the fire&lt;BR&gt;and smoke the black tank moves seeming only a little worse for wear. A&lt;BR&gt;few dents seem to crack its once perfect shell, but it niether slows no&lt;BR&gt;stops its own awesome assult. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A rear mounted turret spun and oriented on Decibel as twin searing&lt;BR&gt;beams cut through the air and into her rear stabilizer struts, she&lt;BR&gt;cried out agony!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meanwhile the main cannon lined up on Tummult and disgorged an energy&lt;BR&gt;blast that seemed to heat the air as it passed! The flier was a little&lt;BR&gt;too nimble for the new commer and was able to evade it, just barely. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Who are you?&quot; Phobia&#39;s powerful voice spoke dangerously from her&lt;BR&gt;protective postion over Deepstryke. &quot;You attack us at your peril!&quot; She&lt;BR&gt;was worried, her\n scanners were picking up niether Predicon or Maximal&lt;BR&gt;signatures. She assumed robot mode her cannons ready to fire!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;I AM LEGACY . . . &quot; Came the cold reply from below, &quot; . . . AND YOU DO&lt;BR&gt;NOT POSSESS THE POWER TO DEFEAT ME.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;You are wrong!&quot; Phobia let loose with a powerful wave of energy&lt;BR&gt;blasts, designed destabilize ones fear centers. &quot;FEAR ME!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The blast hit the newcommer, the one revealed as Legacy near dead&lt;BR&gt;center, and he didn&#39;t slow. &quot;FEAR IS IRRELIVENT. YOU ARE AN ABNORMALITY&lt;BR&gt;AND YOU WILL BE TERMINATED!&quot; The cold and relentless voice spoke from&lt;BR&gt;below. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cannon blasts from Legacy drove Phobia to look for cover as they came&lt;BR&gt;dangerously close to shering off her shoulders!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;OOC: I am not sure what Darkfate or Nightstrike are doing, so I&lt;BR&gt;couldn&#39;t post a response to them. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;OOC: Also I am sure if the Maxi&#39;s are approaching they should clearly&lt;BR&gt;be able to see the battle. Deepstryke&#39;s down,\n Phobia&#39;s protecting him,&lt;BR&gt;Tumult and Decibel is in the thick of fighting a black and red&lt;BR&gt;futuristic hover tank of good size. I will be posting him soon on the&lt;BR&gt;wiki site. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Preston&lt;BR&gt;(Da&#39;minion &amp; Legacy)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _&lt;BR&gt;Be a better friend, newshound, and &lt;BR&gt;know-it-all with Yahoo!
