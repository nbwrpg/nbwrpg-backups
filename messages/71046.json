WHY DON&#39;T YOU HAUL YOUR COCKY AFT OUT HERE AND FACE U=\r\nS LIKE A REAL WARRIOR!&quot;\n\nQuickstride snorts.\n\n&quot;Yeah, quit hidn&#39; behind your=\r\n little fire crackers &#39;n fight like real bots!&quot;\n\nUproar raises a brow.\n\n&quot;He=\r\neey, wait a minute, Leo ll, Wind Caliber, I got an idea.  Cover your noses,=\r\n this might get stinky.  Hey, Quickstride, eat any bean pods lately?&quot;\n\nQuic=\r\nkstride raises a brow, and transforms into his beast mode.\n\n&quot;As a matter of=\r\n fact, I did.  And a lot of &#39;em.  Stand back fellas, stay down wind, and tr=\r\ny not ta breathe any of this in.  We&#39;re about ta stink out the biggest stin=\r\nker in this place!&quot;\n\nHe turns his rump in the direction of where the intrud=\r\ner is, and releases his stink attack.\n\nMeanwhile, on the way back to the Ar=\r\nk, Tucson gets Rodimus&#39;s report.  He is not happy with what he hears.  Almo=\r\nst immediately, his temper begins to escalate.\n\n&quot; NO, NO, NO, NOOOO!  NO ON=\r\nE DISTURBS THE ARK!  NO ONE!\n\nHis engine rumbles with the power of his ange=\r\nr.  It gives him just enough power to start his engine.\n\nRat Trap gasps.\n\n&quot;=\r\nWoah, easy Wheels...  Guys, ya better let those harnesses go, Wheels isn&#39;t =\r\nin a really good mood...&quot;\n\nNight Shift notices the change in his leader.\n\n&quot;=\r\nOhh scrap, he&#39;s right!  Guys, he&#39;s got his engines up!  We can drop the har=\r\nnesses!&quot;\n\nTucson&#39;s engine roars back to life, yet he doesn&#39;t take off in a =\r\nmad dash as of yet.\n\n&quot; THE ARK IS IN PERRIL!

No telln&#39; what&#39;s gonna happen when he gets ba=\r\nck ta the Ark now..&quot;\n\nIt was clear, if there was any temper left in Tucson,=\r\n he had just lost it completely.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cycl=\r\nonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; INSIDE THE ARK\n&gt; \n&gt; As Uproar and Quick=\r\nstride follow Leo II and Wing Caliber up towards the\n&gt; bridge, the trip is =\r\nnothing if not dark and silent. There is virtually no\n&gt; sound, except for t=\r\nhe small sounds that the four themselves make as they\n&gt; walked.\n&gt; \n&gt; Leo II=\r\n and Wing Caliber both seem adept at walking soundlessly, staying\n&gt; close t=\r\no the shadows, but in this oppressive silence, even their footfalls\n&gt; could=\r\n be heard at times, magnified by the echoing in the halls.\n&gt; \n&gt; As they app=\r\nroach the bridge, the door actually slid open as the get close =96\n&gt; appare=\r\nntly even if the rest of the ship is without power, the bridge still\n&gt; has =\r\nit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Screens line the walls as Leo II, Wing Caliber, Quickstride and Up=\r\nroar walk\n&gt; on the bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Where is the intruder.&quot; Leo II growled und=\r\ner his breath. He also sniffed\n&gt; the air looking for any trace of him.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Wing Caliber walked over to one of the console, &quot;Sir look!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Leo II wa=\r\nlked over to see what Wing Caliber was pointing at. And there on\n&gt; the scre=\r\nen was the image of the front bay where the inert forms of Optimus\n&gt; Prime =\r\nand Megatron as well as the other Autobots and Decepticons were\n&gt; laying. H=\r\nowever in the corner of the screen there was a timed count down of\n&gt; 2 minu=\r\ntes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s a bomb!&quot; Caliber said. &quot;We have to get back to the main cha=\r\nmber, now!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It was only then that there was a quiet chuckle from the c=\r\norner as a dark\n&gt; figure stepped from the shadows. It was difficult to tell=\r\n, but he looked\n&gt; like one of the old seekers, like Thundercracker or Skywa=\r\nrp, although his\n&gt; marking were somewhat different. He was shrouded in dark=\r\n blacks and purples\n&gt; and about the same size as any other Predacon or Maxi=\r\nmal. &quot;No, you won&#39;t.&quot;\n&gt; he said, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;You wil=\r\nl stay here and watch\n&gt; your friends, and your entire world go up in flames=\r\n!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a dark chuckle as the figure disappeared and the doors to=\r\n the\n&gt; bridge opened and then closed, to be followed closely by a small det=\r\nonation\n&gt; on the door!\n&gt; \n&gt; It was locked, permanently!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Elita nodded, it was time to be brave, hunt the Predacon could wait; she\n=\r\n&gt; opened her tiny com link and call her dad&quot;Daddy!!!! Someone hurted Uncle\n=\r\n&gt; Elder... He need Cr or Medic bay...He has fell unconceus... he looks very=\r\n\n&gt; bad&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elita get&#39;s an answering call from Rodimus, &quot;You ju=\r\nst stay put little one I\n&gt; am on the way to you now. Try to keep Lord Elder=\r\n out of sight until I get\n&gt; there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as Rodimus spoke, almost as i=\r\nf he could hear them speak about him Lord\n&gt; Elder groaned and moved slightl=\r\ny, but did not regain consciousness.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This was a... Em=\r\notional lapsus, dont expect to wacth a lot&quot;said coldly\n&gt; Perceptor but then=\r\n his voice was tunned with a slight pride&quot;Above all my\n&gt; creations, the Bla=\r\nckFortress was the greatest&quot;and added with a more cold\n&gt; tone&quot;But sometimes=\r\n... Sacrifies are needed&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon and Bump looked at each ot=\r\nher and then shrugged a small smile on\n&gt; their faces.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Of course.&quot; Leg=\r\nacy said in cold tones. He turned to regard the ex Predacon\n&gt; scientist, &quot;H=\r\nowever there may yet be time to construct another, perhaps\n&gt; putting it to =\r\nbetter use this time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ON THE WAY BACK TO THE ARK\n&gt; \n&gt; The tr=\r\nip back is longer then any of them had anticipated. Having to carry\n&gt; and p=\r\null the large bulk of Tuscon back to the base was not the fastest mode\n&gt; of=\r\n travel.\n&gt; \n&gt; However there did not seem to be any opposition either. There=\r\n was no hint of\n&gt; Predacon or Decepticon energy signature to be felt. Not a=\r\n single wrong smell\n&gt; and or anything out of the ordinary, except the feeli=\r\nng of being watched.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Tuscon] now turns his com link o=\r\nn to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus, this is Tucson, I need to know the status\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; of the situation at the Ark, over.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus&#39; voice crack=\r\nled as it came over Tuscon&#39;s radio, &quot;We are inside the\n&gt; Ark now. I have ju=\r\nst been told that Lord Elder is damaged. We are on our way\n&gt; to him now.&quot; T=\r\nhere was a pause and then Rodimus continued, &quot;Leo II, Wing\n&gt; Caliber, Uproa=\r\nr and Quickstride went to the bridge to check things out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a=\r\n small sound over the radio, &quot;Slag!&quot; Rodimus said after a moment.\n&gt; &quot;That s=\r\nounded like a small explosion coming from the bridge. I&#39;ll get back\n&gt; to yo=\r\nu.&quot; Rodimus signed off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile as the group continued to trek back =\r\ntowards the Ark, high above,\n&gt; barely in sight range a large dark form move=\r\nd swiftly through the skies. It\n&gt; was like a dark cloud that for a moment o=\r\nbscured the sun. It was not quite a\n&gt; bird and more than some dinosaur. How=\r\never even at this range its shape was\n&gt; easily recognizable =96 a DRAGON!\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; As quickly as it came it continued to move away towards the north and t=\r\nhen\n&gt; east, its attention apparently on something else as if disregarding t=\r\nhe\n&gt; Autobots and Maximals on the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a moment it could be mad=\r\ne out that the figure was carrying two other\n&gt; dark forms, the forms hangin=\r\ng in wicked clawed talons. However their\n&gt; identities remained unknown as t=\r\nhe figure quickly moved further and further\n&gt; away, an occasional wing flap=\r\n propelling it to faster and faster speeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I detected Minion in that=\r\n thing.&quot; Bantor said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca grunted, &quot;We had better get back to the Ar=\r\nk quickly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a nod they continued to pull Tuscon west, back toward=\r\ns the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
