Dark One, followed by his four Oblitercons stepped up.\n\n&quot;Welcome, Dark One.&quot; Vehement said with a smile.  Slag. Vehement thought.  \nThere would be no way to know his name if I just arrived on the planet! \n\n&quot;How do you know my name?&quot; the leader of the Oblitercons asked, turning to \nhis troops.  &quot;Head back to base, except for Sixshot, Ares, and Double Punch.&quot;\n\nThe orders were followed out as the troops headed off.\n\n&quot;Now answer my question.&quot;\n\n&quot;Dark one is your name?  That&#39;s somewhat amusing.  I merely meant &#39;dark one&#39; \nas in the color of your body.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, who are you?&quot;\n\n&quot;I am Vehement.  Leader of this ship.&quot;\n\n&quot;I am Dark One.  A soldier in the Alliance,&quot; Dark One said, though he was \nreally just a mercenary, &quot;the leader of the Alliance is Zardus.  He is not \nhere though.  He usually leads all major attacks personally, but we moved our \nbase, so he is needed with our bases.&quot;\n\n&quot;So, that is your base on the island.&quot;\n\n&quot;...yes.&quot; Dark One hesitated.  &quot;What did that blasted KitKat want with you?&quot;\n\n&quot;She wanted me to ally with her.  But now it seems she&#39;s much to weak to \nprotect my forces if we got in a battle.&quot;\n\n&quot;Heh.  Can&#39;t protect yourselves?&quot;\n\n&quot;The robots you see in front of you are all that remain of us.  We got in a \nbattle with three Maximal strike cruisers, and the rest were killed in the \ncrash.&quot;\n\n&quot;Blasted Maximals.  So, why should I let you live?&quot;\n\n&quot;Though we have little cannon fodder value, we can produce energon from solar \ntechnology.  And weapons, and our base is quite strong.  With three bases at \nyour disposal.  Though, I&#39;d like to remain neutral.&quot;\n\n&quot;Interesting...I&#39;ll have to contact our leader.&quot; Dark One activated his comm. \nunit, setting the frequency to the inner monologue comm. unit in Zardus&#39; head.\n&quot;Zardus, Dark One here.  KitKat&#39;s pathetic forces have retreated.  The leader \nof the base we are at, Vehement, wishes to discuss a peace treaty with us.&quot;\n\n"}}
