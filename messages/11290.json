It&#39;s so wonderful to meet you Chordate.&quot;  She purred lightly \nand held his arm snuggly in her arms.  She gave a dreamy sigh and \nwalked with him.  \n\nAs they were walking, she was mapping the layout of the ship in her \nmemory banks for later on.  \n\nShe spoke softly to him.&quot;I was lucky to have made here.  I was even \nluckier to have found such friends like you here.&quot; She leaned up and \nkisses him on the cheek. &quot;Thank you.&quot; She rested her head back on his \nshoulder.  She was smiling, not only for him, but she was very \npleased with how well things were working out so far.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Chordate:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Chordate sighed in a happy tone.  Feline was still brushing the tip \nof her \n&gt; tail against his neck.  It felt nice.  Listening to what she had to \nsay, he \n&gt; smiled back.  &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; he responded.  That was all he \ncould get out, \n&gt; now that Feline had began holding onto his arm tightly and was now \ncloser \n&gt; than before.  He sighed happily once more, continuing to walk for \nthe mess \n&gt; hall, wishing the moment would last forever.  But, he knew, as soon \nas the \n&gt; computer told him the intruder was on the move, he would have to \n&gt; unfortunately go.  &quot;Oh, heh, how silly of me.  My name is \nChordate.  What&#39;s \n&gt; yours?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
