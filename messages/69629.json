As he se=\r\nems to step closser to Rodimus.  This distracts him somewhat as he looks ba=\r\nck at his former leader. At this time, his body seems to take on some mass =\r\nthat it had not had before, thus increasing his size a bit, to become just =\r\nslightly taller than Rodimus.  \n\n&quot;Huh? What in the name of Primus?&quot;\n\nHis bo=\r\ndy, still well shaped, and sleek, continues to take  on more and more of a =\r\nresemblence to that of Optimus Prime.  It was as if this power of his heart=\r\n were going to the next level.  So eager and willing to bring a comrade out=\r\n of the darkness that the power of compassion was now acting as if the body=\r\n itself was possessing the Matrix of Leadership.  Although, no such matrix =\r\nis housed in Tucson&#39;s body.  He puts his hand over his chest.\n\n&quot; Optimus...=\r\n.

He =\r\nconcentrates the energy from his all wheel drive systems into that one hand=\r\n and uses it as a vise around Rodimus&#39;s fist. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Trust me, I don&#39;t wan=\r\nt to do this Rodimus.

His hands clamp down painfully hard onto Rodimus&#39;s arms,=\r\n and his grip remains as solid as a powerful vise. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You fail to see =\r\nthat what Hydras, Scourge and Cyclonus are doing, is merely using you as a =\r\npawn. They&#39;ve tampered with you and have no intentions of giving you power.=\r\n All they want is the power you possess, and it appears they are succeeding=\r\n in doing so. I know you have it within you to conquor this hold they have =\r\nover you. You just have to want it bad enough to do it. The Rodimus I know =\r\nwould NEVER fall to such low standards. THE RODIMUS I KNOW WOULD BE STRONG =\r\nAND RESIST THE TEMPTATIONS THAT BEFALL HIM! But I see you are not that Rodi=\r\nmus anymore. You have become no better than MEGATRON! IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT=\r\n?! TO HAVE A HISTORY THE SAME AS THE INFAMOUS DECEPTICON LEADER WHO WROTE H=\r\nIS OWN DEMISE?! TO HAVE EVERYONE DESPISE YOU AND WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO =\r\nDESTROY YOU?!

It was what Tucson was now feeling. He had been s=\r\nubdued enough, and now he was itching to show his true colors.
