Rodimus turns to face a monitor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus: What on Cybertron is going on!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup is at the monitor in an instant, looking over the data.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup: Nightlight isnt our only problem now. This shows that a \nlarge \n&gt; force is entering Earths atmosphere. The trajectory shows them \n&gt; heading for the connon site. They...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup&#39;s optics grow wide, his mouth open as shock overtakes him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup: Roddy, their configuraton match those of the Sweeps! I&#39;m \nnot \n&gt; detecting any Decepticon signatures though.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; face grows serious. He stands behind Kup, looking over \n&gt; his shoulder. He studies the data for a moment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus: Their Sweeps alright. Just like Scourge&#39;s goons back in \n&gt; the day. Not Decepticons thought. They must be Unicron&#39;s troops \n&gt; then. Remember he created the original Sweeps, along with Scourge, \n&gt; Cyclonus and Galvatron by reformatting Decepticons. Unicron must \n&gt; have learned of the connon project. The Minions he sent must have \n&gt; told him. Now he has ordered a massive strike on it to pave the \nway \n&gt; for his arrival.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus thinks over this dire situation for another few moments.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: This could be both bad a good for us. The good \n&gt; thing is that if Unicron feels that he must strike like this then \n&gt; the cannon must be capable of stopping him and hes scared. The bad \n&gt; thing is that its going to take one hell of a defensive effort to \n&gt; stop the Sweeps.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus looks to the Maximals and Autobot in the room.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Kup, make an announcement. Round up the Maximals. \n&gt; I&#39;ll contact the other commanders.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus heads to a communciation station. Meanwhile Kup opens a \n&gt; commlink on all Maximal/Autobot channels.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup: Maximals this is Security Chief Kup. A serious situation \nhas \n&gt; arised. Unicron has sent a massive force to strike at the cannon \n&gt; that is being constructed to defend against Unicron. All Maximals \nas \n&gt; well as other fections will be needed to defend it. Orders are \nhere \n&gt; by issued to all Maximals and allies to report immedietly to the \n&gt; cannon construction site for battle. Good luck and may Primus \nwatch \n&gt; over all of you. Kup out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup closes the link.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus has set up repeating subspace visual/audio signal to be \n&gt; sent to the other faction commanders.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: This is Maximal Commander Rodimus Prime calling \nthe \n&gt; Predacon and Tripredacus Commanders. We have detected a assault \n&gt; force arriving on the planet. This force is headed for the cannon. \n&gt; The force seems to consist of Sweeps, similar to the old \nDecepticon \n&gt; class. This leads us to believe that this force is a pre-emptive \n&gt; strike by Unicron. I&#39;m sending every bot that the Maximals have to \n&gt; defend the cannon. I suggest that the Predacons and Tripredacus do \n&gt; the same. I hope to see you on the battle field. Prime out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Roddy closses that channel and faces the other bots in the room.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Ok guys, its time. Transform and roll out!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup dashes through the halls, checking the ammo for his rifle on \n&gt; the way. Once outside he transforms to his truck mode and heads \nfor \n&gt; the cannon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus waits behind to make sure everyone follows their orders.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: I&#39;m ready for a good ol&#39; fight!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yojinbo of Nightmare &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Sweep commander slowed as the rest of her assault team \nexited \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; hold.  As the last of them flew out, sh signalled the strike \nforce \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; begin re entry, which lasted  many long cycles.  After they \n&gt; entered \n&gt; &gt; Earth&#39;s atmosphe, they corrected thir course and made a bee line \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; the cannon, whose purpose was to destroy their master, and they \n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t have that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC:\n&gt; &gt; Maximals- You can detect the large force of Sweeps and send help \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; the cannon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Predacons- The cannon may be taken by suprise, depending if you \n&gt; &gt; detect the minions as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
