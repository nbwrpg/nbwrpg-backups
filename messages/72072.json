Yet the tip of his left wing still takes some damage, Tucson\n&gt; does manage to literally dodge the bullet.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Not bad, so close but yet so far.  So, Grimlock, what else do you have\n&gt; besides that fuel consuming energy weapon of yours?  Surely you&#39;ve been\n&gt; upgraded with more sophisticated skills other than what you have, don&#39;t\n&gt; you?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He is quick to whirl the sword into his hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Big guns only shoot so far before they run out of power.  Now, let&#39;s try\n&gt; that again shall we?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere is little response from the large Dinobots, save for a renewed savagery!\n\nGRIMLOCK just snarled, his optics a bright red anger evident across\nhis face. There is again little reaction to TUSCON&#39;s taunts except\nthat he pulled out his rather large energy sword in hand, the air\nsparking as it came to life.\n\nSLAG on the other hand looked almost happy that TUSCON had dodged the\nfirst blow as he also pulled out his own sword, which was only\nslightly smaller than GRIMLOCK&#39;s own blade.\n\nThe dinobots may lack TUSCON&#39;s specialized training in ninjabot\ntechniques, but they have been fighting in wars, battles and\nskirmishes for many more times then he has been alive and are well\nversed in the fighting arts of war!\n\nSLUDGE and SNARL come in with biting attacks, their teeth razor sharp\nand their jaws powerfully strong as GRIMLOCK and SLAG attempt to hack\nat TUSCON!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
