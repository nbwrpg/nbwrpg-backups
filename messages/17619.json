I see his dead body.&quot;  She just then had a strong urdge to \ncheck out the old cave. &quot;OK, Orders, let&#39;s get that cave checked \nout.  He was supposed to meet me here. Starscream, Drillbit, \nBludgeon, head to the cave and use your scanners for any signs of \ntranformer life forms inside. Let&#39;s make this a clean sweep.  If \nthere is nothing here, then we will scout for a base.&quot; She walked \nslowly to the towards the cave. &quot;Phobia, check that body and head, \nmake sure that it is the real Megatron. My nose is twitching and  I \ndon&#39;t like this whole mess. It was way to easy.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He followed KitKat.\n&gt; &quot;That couldn&#39;t have been Megatron, just to easy.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
