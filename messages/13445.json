The first \nbeing the destruction of the Cybertronian fire.....\n\nScourge: But last time we attacked we didn&#39;t even damage the sheild!\nInferno: We should analyze the material sent by Brightblade (should it be \nvalid).\nRampage: I doubt we can trust that material. It is probably protected by some \nfunction that put a virus in it. First we will need to develope an EMP \nshockwave weapon strong enough to disable theirs.\n\nHun-grr: We will begin work on it immediately.\nThe Terrorscon begin work on developing the EMP weapon.\n\n"}}
