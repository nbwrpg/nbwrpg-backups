He lands on his butt, skidding a few feet.\n\n&quot;Right,&quot; he replies to Prebon as he jumps up, picking up his dropped \nrifle and firing again, &quot;And I&#39;m Unicron.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFenox speeds up, still heading for the Iron Fist.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStarlight rolls in the air to try to avoid the shot, but it hits her \nleg, severing it. She swears and cuts the mechfluid flow to her leg, \nfiring three more charges down at Prebon.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRecklessa growls when she realizes who the rest of the team were \nfighting. It was that bot that had blasted her into the water!\n\nShe jumped into the air, her jetpack activating and sending her \ntoward Prebon.\n\n&quot;Die!!!!&quot; she yells, firing two large missiles at Prebon.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Prebon knew that the odds were in his favor, most of the Alliance \nwas \n&gt; at the CF so there was a good chance of victory. &quot;My troops fell \n&gt; because they didn&#39;t listen to logic.&quot; The three he was fighting \nwere \n&gt; a fair team. Shots ricochet off his armor as he gained speed in his \n&gt; attempt to keep up with Fenox. out of the corner of his optics he \nsaw \n&gt; charges coming his way. the first of which caught him off gaurd \n&gt; exploding and forceing him to change direction.he grabbed the \nsecond \n&gt; one and redirected it down at Astral. the third one scored a solid \n&gt; hit causing a rupture in the back of his armor. he aimed his \n&gt; constrictor rifle up at Starlight and fired a beam that would knock \n&gt; the target out of the fight.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You fools are nothing more than a design flaw, I am the advanced \n&gt; model on this world.&quot; He yells as the chase continued.\n\n\n"}}
