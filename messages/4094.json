How did TM3 Volois know of the mind erasing device??\n\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; TM3 Vulois could see it in the distance: The Predacon ship. And he\n&gt; &gt; knew how he would get in. But he hopes they don&#39;t detect him. This\n&gt; &gt; signal masker only has a few cycles left of energy. He finds the\n&gt;air\n&gt; &gt; vent, opens it up and starts crawling through, putting the vent\n&gt;back\n&gt; &gt; in place. Being a Predacon, he could normally just enter the base.\n&gt; &gt; But Hell Beast would see his new body and would start asking\n&gt; &gt; questions. Questions he didn&#39;t want to answer. Besides, he wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; be a Predacon for much longer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Acording to my scanners, the machine is right here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vulois opens up the vent which leads into Scorponok&#39;s lab. On one\n&gt;of\n&gt; &gt; the table&#39;s he sees a box with a big button on it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes. With this box I can whipe DarkMouse&#39;s program and re-program\n&gt; &gt; her to serve myself and Soundwave! I will make her a TM3 and she\n&gt;will\n&gt; &gt; aide us in the ruling of Cybertron!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just then his internal computer talked to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Signal Masker has gone offline.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Oh Crap! Now he&#39;s gotta get out of here. The Preds can see his\n&gt; &gt; signature. He hopes he won&#39;t encounter any on the way out.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
