He accepted\nthe cease-fire pretexting the Beast Wars concerned him more, but he\ndoesn&#39;t realize that the Tripredacus are as much a part of the Beast\nWars as any other group on this planet. So, General Blackheart, what\nis our main goal for now?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; \n&gt; Roddy opens a return channel.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: This is Commander Prime at Maximal HQ. It&#39;s good to\nhear from you, Tyrael. I had heard some stories of what your fellow\nTripredacus have done on Cybertron, and what they plan to do here.\nUnder normal circumstances I would have to fight your forces, but I&#39;m\nmore concerned with the Beat Wars right now. So I agree to the cease\nfire. The Predacons are more important right now.\n\n\n"}}
