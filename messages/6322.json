I needed a break from the computer. I�ll be posting \nregularly from now on, promise.)\n\nTavatron felt as if she was falling. Twisting and turning in a black abyss \ndevoid of all light. Encompassed in the darkness, it�s black tendrils snaked \nabout her body in an attempt to make her a part of that darkness, devoid of \nlight and feeling. There was a time in her life when she would have embraced \nthe darkness, a time when nothing else had mattered. But now, now the \ndarkness was breached by a pinhole of light. That pinhole grew until it \ndrove out the darkness, turning the limitless void into one of green grass \nand massive trees, a realm bordered by reason and emotion.\n\nTavatron suddenly found herself wandering amidst a forest of redwoods and \nmassive oaks. This was new. The light, the grass, the FEELING, this had \nnever been a part of her dream before. It was foreign, and frightening. It \ntook a great deal to frighten the wolfen warrior, but this dream scared her. \nShe was used to the darkness, in essence it had become a part of her, but \nthis light, this was different. What could bring about the sudden \nillumination of eternal night? Suddenly Tavatron felt herself being pulled \naway, away from the contentment and relaxation, away from the light. \nTavatron once more found herself enveloped in darkness, but this was not the \npainless void of her subconscious, this was real.\n\nWith much effort Tavatron opened her crimson optics. Small sparks leapt from \nthe corners of her eyes. Tavatron bit back against the pain, however this \nvery action only caused more sparks to erupt from her battered body. \nTavatron rubbed her head in an effort to relieve her headache when several \nmore blasts drew her attention away from her own injuries to the status of \nher commander. Tavatron growled softly, her optics blurred and \nmalfunctioning. She could make out the shape of an immense raptorian \ncreature. Either her mind was playing tricks or she was about to die. Either \nway she was in too much pain to care which:\n\n&quot;Beast� mode.&quot;\n\nTavatron had barely spoken when an ear-shattering scream erupted from her \nthroat. Her mind was racing as she dug her hind claws into the metallic \nfloor. A loud screech echoed off the walls as her claws scratched and tore \nwildly at the floor. Tavatron had attempted to transform, and failed \nmiserably. Now she was not only severely damaged, but trapped somewhere \nbetween robot and beastmode. Sparks flew from every joint as Tavatron cried \nout once again. The pain was intolerable. The sound of grinding gears and \nsnapping wires filled her ears as, in a last ditch effort, Tavatron slammed \nher body against the floor, hoping to jar loose whatever it was the was \npreventing her transformation.\n\nWith a whine of protest the gears finally complied as Tavatron�s armor \nreorganized itself. She lay there, panting softly, her body occasionally \nsparking. The barrage of fire that had hit her earlier had done more damage \nthan she had anticipated. Tavatron�s eyes fluttered open, shutting again \nwhen she found herself staring directly into an overhead light. Tavatron \ndrew her feet under her and slowly stood, her legs surprisingly sturdy \ndespite the painful transformation. Tavatron looked up, only to find herself \nstaring at the barrel of a gun, and the only thing separating her from the \nowner of the gun some bent bars. Out of the corner of her eye should could \nmake out a large figure, too large to be Iron Raptor, but not large enough \nto be her second beastmode. Tavatron took a tentative step toward the \ncreature, her eyes still slightly unfocused:\n\n&quot;Iron Raptor?&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
