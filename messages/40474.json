He was\n&gt; poised with his only weapon, a reflective staff. The 2 small cannons\n&gt; fired and he deflected both shots. Then his incredible senses\n&gt; detected a slight soundless shift in the metal beneath his feet. He\n&gt; quickly turned,hurled the staff at the source,and jumped away from the\n&gt; next 2 beams. He then stared astonished as Mustex caught the staff in\n&gt; mid flight.\n&gt; Rhesus:Computer,deactivate firing pattern. You&#39;ve improved.\n&gt; Mustex:Shutup. I&#39;m here to ask for your help. I need to find the\n&gt; Mutants. I need Veratis to pinpoint how Stallex started as a baby and\n&gt; worked his way up to this age. With Veratis&#39; access to protoforms\n&gt; maybe I can force him to create dozens of new Maximal babies.\n&gt; Rhesus:No.\n&gt; Mustex:Come on. You weren&#39;t always a piece of slime. Do you remember\n&gt; why you\n&gt; carry that staff.\n&gt; Rhesus:No.\n&gt; Mustex:Well I do, because you have to much honor to carry a blaster.\n&gt; Rhesus:Go away.\n&gt; Mustex:Fine then! Maybe my best friend died with the other Carnitrons.\n&gt; Rhesus:I always told you times change.\n&gt; Mustex:Finish your own quote, but warriors never do!\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have no intentions of vastly using Rhesus. He&#39;s just another Trump\n&gt; card\n&gt; for Mustex(the first being Stallex). He&#39;ll probably just jump out from\n&gt; behind a boulder and save Mustex or Stallex&#39;s circuits.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
