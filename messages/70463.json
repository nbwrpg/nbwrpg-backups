A heart can still talk to a heart and get through, it&#39;s the one \n&gt; thing that separates us from our enemies.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He rolls in as Rat Trap nodds to Lord Elders&#39; statement and then looks to \n&gt; Cheetor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Oh? And I suppose you know about this computer pussycat?  Oh well, if ya \n&gt; ask me this thing&#39;s due for some major upgrades.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift looks back at Cheetor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;He&#39;s gotchya there kiddo.  He&#39;s right, this stuff goes back vorns ago, it \n&gt; could do with a sizeable upgrade.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then turns to Airhammer.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gotchya, no hard feeln&#39;s, we&#39;ll talk later!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride snorts.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Patience isn&#39;t one of Noctorro&#39;s strong points is it?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Got that right, and that could hurt &#39;em sooner or later.  Now, about \n&gt; Rodimus..  Looks like Tucson can&#39;t get through ta his radio &#39;cause it&#39;s \n&gt; off line. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap anaylizes the tendrils.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s gotta have somethn&#39; ta do with those tendrils.  But if we rip &#39;em \n&gt; off, we&#39;ll do more harm than good.  Truth is we have no idea what we&#39;re \n&gt; dealn&#39; with and I don&#39;t wanna make things worse.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmmm, maybe a little encouragement from familliar comrades will sort of \n&gt; get &#39;em gon&#39;under there. Night Shift, as far as ya know, Wheels worked \n&gt; really close ta Rodimus right?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sure did.  Although, they had their disagreements now&#39;n then.  Rodimus \n&gt; ben&#39; a hot rod, and Tucson ben&#39; an off roader, who always put saftey \n&gt; before speed, and Rodimus with his habit of speedn&#39; on the roadways...  Oh \n&gt; yeah, that kinda did annoy Tucson a little bit, but other than that, \n&gt; they&#39;re close.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap listens.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Okay then, maybe if Wheels was here, talkn&#39; ta him, that might spark \n&gt; somethn&#39; without him havn&#39; ta give up his spark ta save &#39;em. Wait here, \n&gt; I&#39;m gonna go get Wheels.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As he darts out to find Tucson Prime, he nearly bumps into Lord Elder, but \n&gt; catches himself, as he approaches Tucson Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tucson Prime, sir, your radio isn&#39;t gettn&#39; through ta Rodimus, and truth \n&gt; is we dunno what will.  Our guess is that if you could stay in the room \n&gt; with us  and start conversn&#39; with &#39;em, that might just spark somethn&#39; in \n&gt; &#39;em ta try&#39;n come back online and fight off whatever hold those tendrills \n&gt; got on &#39;em.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, Perceptor just told me.  Lord Elder, I&#39;ll be in the CR chamber room, \n&gt; looking after Rodimus with Night Shift and Rat Trap.  I strongly believe \n&gt; that Perceptor and Rat Trap&#39;s idea will hopefully get something going.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He drives Talon in with him as well as Perceptor, as he comes to a halt in \n&gt; the very room where Rodimus is lying in a coccoon of Tendrils.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus, I&#39;m here, and I have a message for you.  Nightlight and Elita \n&gt; desperately need you, and truthfully so do I.  We are strength in numbers, \n&gt; and without you that strength can not hold. You are sadly missed my \n&gt; friend, and I will not have you be missed for long.  Do you hear me? \n&gt; You&#39;ve faced worse, you can overcome this, I know you can.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap taps feverishly on the computer to try and get it to desist \n&gt;&gt; &gt; firing on Perceptor, at the same time he was happy to know that Lord \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Elder had said something to Tucson Prime.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;UGHH! C&#39;mon computer, if I say somethn&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay! It ain&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; &gt; like I&#39;m gonna bug ya with a virus! Perceptor&#39;s a pred but he&#39;s changn&#39; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; sides! Stupid piece of outdated hardware! Well, at least Lord Elder \n&gt;&gt; &gt; said somethn&#39; ta Wheels, I don&#39;t wanna ever hear him try&#39;n ta put his \n&gt;&gt; &gt; spark on the line ever again.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The computer readily responds to Rat Trap&#39;s wishes and shuts down its\n&gt;&gt; attack sequence. The shield&#39;s drop and the weapons go back to stand-by\n&gt;&gt; condition. However on Rat Trap&#39;s console the computer continues to\n&gt;&gt; register the fact that there is a Predacon signature in the area\n&gt;&gt; although all other alarms shut down.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lord elder looked around the command center, his stance calm and\n&gt;&gt; relaxed. &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; he said consolingly to Rat Trap, &quot;We have lost\n&gt;&gt; too many already, I am not looking to loose Tuscon so quickly.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheetor came up and stood next to Rat Trap smacking him on the back in\n&gt;&gt; a friendly gesture, &quot;You think you got the computer under control\n&gt;&gt; now?&quot; he said teasing the smaller Maximal as he smiled, &quot;You look like\n&gt;&gt; you couldn&#39;t handle it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride and Night Shift try to deal with Noctorro, but his prodding \n&gt;&gt; &gt; was getting on the Autobot&#39;s nerves more than anything else.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Look, we&#39;re don&#39; the best we can, and we really don&#39;t know what we&#39;re \n&gt;&gt; &gt; dealn&#39; with here, this is completely alien ta all of us and you&#39;re \n&gt;&gt; &gt; gonna have ta show some patience.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride snorts and looks over to Noctorro.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;C&#39;mon, give us some breathing room will ya?! Geeze!.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Noctorro looked like he was about to go off for a moment, his optics\n&gt;&gt; looking a definite crimson as he locked gazes with Quickstride.\n&gt;&gt; However Airhammer stepped in the middle of them and looked back at\n&gt;&gt; Noctorro, &quot;Maybe we can go find out. It&#39;s obvious they have much work\n&gt;&gt; to do.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Noctorro nodded and laughed as he rubbed the back of his head with a\n&gt;&gt; nervous almost embarrased gesture, &quot;Sure.&quot; he said looking definitly\n&gt;&gt; sheepish. &quot;You&#39;re right, let&#39;s go.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Airhammer looked at Quickstride and Nightshift, &quot;He get&#39;s that way\n&gt;&gt; sometimes, but he means well.&quot; he said quietly as they turned to leave\n&gt;&gt; the room.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Outside, Tucson Prime acknolwedges the readiness to come aboard.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;This is Tucson Prime to Lord Elder, I&#39;m comming back to the Ark as you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; requested. And let&#39;s see what the medics can do, if they need my help \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m here to give to them. Perceptor, Talon, don&#39;t worry, you will not \n&gt;&gt; &gt; be losing me any time soon, I assure you. I wonder if I can get a link \n&gt;&gt; &gt; up with Rodimus remotely. As an Autobot we should be able to com link \n&gt;&gt; &gt; with each other.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He attempts to connect with Rodimus&#39;s com link, hoping to get through \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to him.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elder responds from the command center, &quot;I will pass that on to them.\n&gt;&gt; I am sure they are working as hard as they can.&quot; Elder said, trying\n&gt;&gt; keep the peace, and yet trying to keep Tuscon from jumping headlong\n&gt;&gt; into sacrificing himself again.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon attempts to connect with Rodimus but get&#39;s no response. It is\n&gt;&gt; as if his radio is offline or not responding. Perhaps it has something\n&gt;&gt; to do with the fact that Rodimus is completely wrapped in the strange\n&gt;&gt; alien metal tendrils.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
