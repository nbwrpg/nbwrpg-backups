How to deal with femmes.  I want one, the same \nway Malice does.  I do not understand how he does it.&quot;\nNightstrike: &quot;What femme do you like? Blacknightmare???&quot;said \nNightstrike\ninjustice:  &quot;No, diffinetly not.  Perhaps Organics could be swayed.  \nHmmmm.....&quot;\nNighstrike: the male laughted and said &quot;She? ohh come on, she hates \nyou&quot;\nInjustice:  &quot;Malice hated all of you with extreme prejustice before \nhe was brainwashed.&quot;\nnighstrike: &quot;Unlucky we can&#39;t brainwash her, Unicron needs her... by \nnow &quot;\nInjustice:  &quot;Perhaps.  But wills are easily broken, we just have to \nfind out how to make her a total slave.&quot;\nNightstrike: &quot;True... but stillwe have to convince Unicron he must \nbe more willing to find those renegades by now, instead have a \nservant more&quot;said the male while he drank his energin&quot;Besides.. \nMalice&#39;s brainwashed resulted wrong, he shouldnt&#39; be so willing to \nrepeat the same&quot;\nInjustice:  &quot;Malice&#39;s brainwashing was a gamble, there was a high \nprobablity that it would not have worked because of his unique \nphysiology.  That is why it was not as big of a success than it \ncould have been.\nNightstrike: &quot;In this one situation it&#39;s the same&quot;replied the \nmale&quot;She&#39;s strong like his bro, and she has an attachment here&quot;\nInjustice:  &quot;That attachment is her weakness.  The bird boy is \nreally the only thing keeping her defiant.  If we faked his demise, \nshe would be a little more suseptable to control.&quot;\nNighstrike: &quot;What are YOU???? suggestting?&quot;said Nightstrike serious\nInjustice:  &quot;Make it look like the parrot kicked the bucket and let \nher find out when she goes to feed him.  She&#39;ll be crushed, she&#39;ll \nbe too broke up over him she&#39;ll do anything.&quot;\nNighstrike: &quot;Are YOU suggest me that&quot;he lowed the vioce&quot;I kill the \nparrot?&quot;\nInjustice:  &quot;Not kill, just render him unconscious for a long time.  \nMake it look like he is dead.  But don&#39;t kill him, Unicron might get \na little angry.&quot;\nNightstrike: &quot;What do you expect win with this farse, \nInjustice?&quot;said coole the male&quot;what would I win?&quot;\nInjustice:  &quot;Favor of Unicron, more power, perhaps a slave willing \nto do ANYTHING we ask her to.&quot;\nNighstrike: &quot;What if she left this base as soon as she belived that \nhe&#39;s dead?&quot;\nInjustice:  &quot;She can&#39;t.  She does not have security clearance, she \nwouldn&#39;t even open a minor security door.  She&#39;d have to get a \nweapon and shoot her way out.&quot;\nNightstrike: The male didn&#39;t looked very convinced\nInjustice:  &quot;Do you have so little faith in your allies?  Why can&#39;t \nyou believe me for once?&quot; the clone demanded, becoming very annoyed.\nNightstrike: &quot;Think this... if our little farse is discovered, she \nwont&#39; cooperate or her cooperation would be hardest to get... and \nthe only one who could do that to the parror, safely for him, is \nHellplague, I&#39;m not a tech...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
