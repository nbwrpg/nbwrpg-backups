Any tech-bot could do you that favor - \n&gt; knowing our resident genius, Wheeljack-X, he&#39;d be happy to help.&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; A whispering voice causes her ears to prick up, despite knowing \nthat \n&gt; there was nobody to make the sound - it&#39;s not coming through the \nair, \n&gt; but rather in her mind.  Empath blinks.  &quot;Did you hear something?&quot;\n\nCocking a brow. &quot;No, I didn&#39;t,&quot; she glanced about her. She was uneasy \nenough as it was, & now Empath had to make her even more uneasy. \n\nWheeljack-X, huh? she thought. Seemed that if he would become \ninvolved that something may go wrong. But then again, if he was like \nthe Wheeljack she &#39;knew&#39;, then he was a genius is some form.

Walking past Windlord, not \nstopping. &quot;I ask at least that no one follows me, won&#39;t attract as \nmuch attention if I am unaccompanied by some form of .. Autobot.&quot; she \ngrowled as she padded by him & then broke out into a run. \n\n\n"}}
