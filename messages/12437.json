For many reasons, he didn&#39;t believe her. He \nwasn&#39;t going to stop for no one, in fear that she was from either \nMegatron&#39;s or Hell Beast&#39;s sides. He dodged trees and jumped over \ndowned trees, snapped in half and uprooted. \n\nHe charged through the forest, with the dry leaves brushing against \nhis furless feet. Approaching a slide, his back foot crashed against \na dead log, which made him loose his balance and slip. His body went \ntumbling down, first on his side. He soon tucked his body in until he \nlooked like a ball, and rolled down the slide. At the foot of it, his \nbody rolled off the eroded base, and fell into the ground with a \ngrunt.\n\n\n"}}
