Blood red eyes glowed errily as they swivled in their \nsockets, watching the other bots around him. A long tail sweeped back \nand forth, perfectly in sync to his steps. White metallic skin gleaming \nunder the lights, the Transmetal 2 Dinobot had been reborn. \n\nHe knew naught how it had happened, or anything before he newal of \nlife, but what Megatron now Hydras had told him. He was a Predacon, a \nnoble Warrior, that stood proudly next to his leader. He snarled at \nthat thought, his tail sweeping agiatatedly. What he had been told was \nafter the Maximals destroyed their ship, he had been blown free of the \nwrekage, severaly damaged. Only then afterwards was he found by fellow \nPreds and taken to the CR tanks.\n\nDinobot made his way through the halls, looking for Hydras. His memory \ncircuits were still scrambled, but he had a feeling he was told the \nfull truth. Even though his spark was not whole, it still spoke of \nhonor.
