But after this post, lets take it\n&gt; to non rpg email.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I dont know whats up with that game, but Sting has never been in\n&gt; WWF. I have is biography. He started in the indies, and then went to\n&gt; Gerogia Championship Wrestling of the National Wrestling Alliance. He\n&gt; has been there ever since, because Georgia Championship Wrestling became\n&gt; World Championship Wrestling.\n&gt; \n&gt; And KSL, you had to go insult WCW, the promotion that made me a fan. I\n&gt; got into wrestling, watching WCW with my dad in 93. They have the most\n&gt; amazing star and have always been the better promotion. You say they\n&gt; have no talent, well DDP and Booker T. are the only extreamly good stars\n&gt; they have now. But lets talk about AOL/Time Warner WCW.\n&gt; Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Bret Hart, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Scott\n&gt; Steiner, Rick Steiner, Arn Anderson, Ricky Steamboat, Sting, Curt\n&gt; Hening, Rey Masterio Jr., Billy Kidman, Road Warriors, Dusty Rhodes,\n&gt; Hulk Hogan, and the greatest wrestler of all time, the Nature Boy Ric\n&gt; Flair. Of course there are many I didn&#39;t mention.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh you dont know who Scott Steiner is, KSL? Well he signed with WWF and\n&gt; should show up in a few months. You should be amazed. He got the mic\n&gt; skills, and as far as physical shape goes, there is not one man in WWF,\n&gt; WCW, or ECW that can match up.\n&gt; \n\n\n=====\nREPLY SOON          HARLEY PARRY FROM ST.THOMAS\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
