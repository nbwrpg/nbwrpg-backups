So \n&gt; much so that he found himself tearing a bit from both eyes.  Straight Shot \n&gt; was also showing tears in her eyes, as she holds Rat Trap&#39;s hand in \n&gt; support.  She could also see that Silverbolt was also pouring his heart \n&gt; out for Tucson and Rodimus to pull through, and with her free hand, she \n&gt; gently puts it into Silverbolts.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If there&#39;s one thing Tucson Prime told us that I&#39;ll remember always, is \n&gt; the fact that we have something that no Predacon or Decepticon, or \n&gt; Unicronian will ever possess.  A power so simple yet so powerful that only \n&gt; those with pure hearts possess it.  You&#39;re feeling it too, you have that \n&gt; power, we all do.  We just gotta tap into it, and let it be felt by Tucson \n&gt; and Rodimus Prime.  If they can feel that we&#39;re pulling for them, they&#39;ll \n&gt; find the strength to make it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap smiles back to them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;She&#39;s right Silverbolt, we can do this, we got what it takes, it&#39;s in our \n&gt; hearts, and no one can take that away from us, no one.  But if Wheels&#39;n \n&gt; Speedy are gonna make it, we gotta show them that our hearts are pulln&#39; \n&gt; for them all the way.  See?  Every time we put our hearts inta them, that \n&gt; light pulsing in Wheels, it gets brighter&#39;n brighter. He knows  guys, he \n&gt; knows we&#39;re pulln&#39; for &#39;em.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Oh yeah, I&#39;m just noticing that now.  He knows we&#39;re pulln&#39; for &#39;em all \n&gt; right, he can feel our energy commn&#39; tagether.  We might not know that \n&gt; we&#39;re radiatn&#39; somethn&#39; out at &#39;em, but he sure does.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With every hope poured into Tucson&#39;s success in recovering Rodimus, his \n&gt; chest glows brighter and brighter with each pulsation.  It&#39;s as if he \n&gt; could actually channel the energy put out by his comrades in a spiritual \n&gt; sense of being.  And on the table, even in slumber he lets them know just \n&gt; how he feels about their support.  He wispers.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I - will - not fail you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Silverbolt stood and watched as Nightshift, Elita and the others\n&gt;&gt; poured out thier hearts out over Rodimus. He turned and looked at\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus and Tuscon through the glass, his hands behind his back. He\n&gt;&gt; felt rather than saw Torca and Bantor come to stand behind him, all of\n&gt;&gt; them watching the struggle that was going on, on the others side.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; They watched as Santon, Bump and Legacy, perhaps the best technicians\n&gt;&gt; that they had available worked on Rodimus, thier movements swift and\n&gt;&gt; efficient. Silverbolt did not normally go in for the whole spiritual\n&gt;&gt; side of things, but he could not help but to clench his fists and hope\n&gt;&gt; with ever fibre of his being that Rodimus would pull through.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
