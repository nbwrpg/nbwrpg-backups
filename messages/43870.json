His chest compartment opened up, as a device rose slowly out\nof it, a binocular type gadget, that lowered over his eyes, as he looked\nat Alpha Dolphy. &quot;No no, we do not double team a Decepticon warrior,\nespecially one as proud as Firestrike.&quot; He whispered to himself, as he\nheld up his one free hand. His wrist compartment opened up, as his hand\nslid back into the joint, then was replaced by a thin barrel. He\nextended his arm, and fired a blast of laser first at Alpha Dolphy, then\nin behind of Prowl, in an attempt to give Firestrike a safe escape.\n\nOOC: The laser isnt very powerful, and if it hits would only stun for a\nsecond at the most, it would not cause any dammage.\n\n"}}
