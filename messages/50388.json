Megatron is waiting in \nthe control room for the Predacons, most of which are &#39;busy&#39; or \nsomething. I really don&#39;t have much to post about right now, but I \nstill have to read the posts up till when i last checked em.\n\nI guess i have to stick my nose in, cause this obviously aint \ngetting better, it&#39;s getting worse. *raises verbal shields*\n\nFirst think that needs to happen is a cease fire in this flame war \nbetween cardhead, lurker, and narrator. it started wrong right from \nthe start. certain things which shouldn&#39;t have been said, were said, \nand the replies were less than sucessful at defusing the situation \nand it blew up. \n\ncardhead, if you don&#39;t like Narrator&#39;s posting style, that&#39;s your \nproblem. Telling him that you don&#39;t like it, with a bunch of \nsenseless slander isn&#39;t going to make him post the way you&#39;d like \nhim to post.\n\nNarrator, keep ooc comments out of your posting, if you want to say \nsomething, say it and no pot shots. And I find it really hard to \nbelieve that you managed to put &#39;piece of dog shit&#39; and &#39;grow up&#39; in \nthe same context.\n\nIf anyone wants to grow up, then they should shut up about this \nstupid arguement, and get back to role playing. Nothing anyone can \nsay now short of an appologies and &#39;I&#39;m being quiet&#39;, can show me \nthat anyone is growing up.\n\n*preps for backlash*\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BULL-FUCKING-SHIT YOU HAVE.
