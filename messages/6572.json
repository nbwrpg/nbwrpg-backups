All but Savanna seemed to be caught up in \nPhobias tale. Savanna had a look on her faceplate like a person who&#39;d \nseen a movie one to many times, and already memorized the ending.\n\n&quot;While we conducted scans a Temporal wave hit my ship, freezing all \nelectronic systems, including the crew and myself. I awoke on board a \ntrader ship. the traders already scavenged the warship and virtually \neveryone on board. I was spared because they needed someone to \nexplain the technology to them.&quot; Now was where he had to mince words \nto seem sincere and trustworthy.\n\n&quot;I worked with the alien traders and learned the controls of thier \nship. I assisted them in fitting it with a transwarpdrive. they \nfigured that if they could travell through time and space they&#39;d be \nable to beat thier competition.\n\nI had other plans for the ship. I &quot;convinced&quot; the traders to let \nme &quot;borrow&quot;the ship to track the wave to it&#39;s source. When I \nattempted to contact Predicon HQ on cybertron and they told me \nthere&#39;d never been a colony on Metallasis or a mission to find it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Have I lost anybody yet?&quot; \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, firefox_y2k@h... wrote:\n&gt; -^Hysteria^-\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria sighed deeply, so much for leaving. She stood behind \nKluster \n&gt; while he talked with Phobia. Her eyes nervously darted around the \n&gt; room. Her beastmode was uncomfortable around lions, and it was \n&gt; effecting her logic circuits. Still, she would be alright, she just \n&gt; had to keep her beastmode under control. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kluster shakes his head. &quot;We&#39;re not here to leave.
