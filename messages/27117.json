Beacon? A few small roasts? Side-pork? Maybe a sort of thick soup? There were many things with which a sow could be made into, but either a roast or a soup seemed to be the most right out of them all. However, it would be roast this morning. Filling and satisfying but wouldn�t coat the stomach and make a person feel too full like a soup. Also, Teltoli would be able to take a few along on her task. Roast it would be.\r\nCarnage shifted her feet and looked the pig over to decide whether to begin cutting, finally deciding to gut it first and go from there. Transforming into Robot Mode she removed a short sword from her back, meant for close combat but worked just as well slicing through the hide of a sow this morning. And, with a swift stroke the belly was sliced open and intestines spilled onto the earth, but with her other hand Carnage quickly yanked them from their hold in the body and set them aside, knowing they could be used.\r\nBlood stained the ground as she made short work of the sow, cutting and slicing so that everything was in pieces and choice parts were selected which she would make the roasts from. Haunches and shoulders mostly with a few dozen strips of muscle from the legs, back and sides where side pork could be made as well as beacon. Taking as much meat from the sow as she could, not wasting a single bit.  The head could be used as a trophy, but Carnage wasn�t the sort to hunt for sport and would remove the skull instead. Taking out the innards and then drying it out after rubbing bear fat over it all to make it water resistant, thinking that a pigs head-shaped carrying case could be useful when plucking berries from their vines in mid-summer. Nothing was wasted, everything was used.   The hooves could be boiled down and used as a gritty paste which could be rubbed over the hides of deer and elk to remove the fur before tanning them to make warm blankets, and the bones had their uses as well.\r\nThe ribs could be splintered and then fashioned into needles for sewing, the spine could be chucked up and used as legs for chairs and tables. All other assorted bones could be used in many different ways, but she liked using them for soups the best. Added flavor. \r\nBlood up to her elbow-joints, Carnage leaned back and looked at what she had before her. Bones in one pile, hunks of flesh with strips of muscle which they would eat this morning in another. Head and hooves already cleaned and ready for transport. Now all she had to do was pack what she was taking back and cook what she wasn�t. Glad to have gotten it over with so there would be almost no weight as she continued home.\r\nSticking the bloody blade into the ground, Carnage left the sword to venture into the near forest in search for large leaves and stalks to wrap and tie the items in. Quickly returning with what she needed she set it onto the ground and moved to sit down beside it all, spreading a leaf out before her and reaching for the head and spine.\r\nHowever, the sound of flapping wings caught her attention as she laid the head onto its� place on the leaf, looking up and spotting Teltoli landing with an arm full of firewood.     She looked at the wood and decided that it satisfied her, looking up at the face of the fembot fuzor. ** � Good.� ** Carnage then moved and placed the spine upon the leaf, not caring if Teltoli noticed her bloody arms and the pile of guts and organs she had landed beside. However, Carnage wasn�t done with her yet.** � There�s a bog a few clicks away, think you could fish out a torso sized boulder for me? Also, get a few pints of the black moss that grows on the trees there.�� ** those tasks would be difficult but she knew that Teltoli could do it. It was all part of getting her ready for what she had to do later on in the day, which would test her body and spirit to its� max.**\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
