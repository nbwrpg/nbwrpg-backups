Her jerking back his arm and slamming her paws into his chest \nat the same time nearly snaps off his arm, a couple of nasty-sounding snaps \ncoming from it. Prowl gritts his teeth in pain as claws dig into his chest, \nmechfluid flowing out of the wounds.\n\nThis was something he least expected: his mate attacking him after he was \nnearly killed by a 45-foot tall gestalt. Perhaps this was her way of getting \nhim back for worrying her.\n\n&quot;Love, what are you doing?&quot; he says in a strained voice, his good arm taking \nhold of one of her forelegs and trying to push it away from his chest. He \njerks his other hand back, the acid-weakened metal tearing one her teeth. \nProwl&#39;s arm goes limp as he pulls it out of Iron Raptor&#39;s mouth, leaking \nmechfluid, its moving mechanism completely disabled.\n\n"}}
