You could obtain power that spans the universe,\n&gt; a name \n&gt; for yourself greater than any Cybrtronian Autobot or\n&gt; Decepticon! The \n&gt; future is yours to make, here and now! Join us!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Around him sweeps manuvered, their movements agitated and\n&gt; aggressive \n&gt; as if they too knew of the tense offer delivered to the\n&gt; Predicon \n&gt; commander.\n&gt; \n&gt; Decibel floated nearby Cyclonus uncharacteristically\n&gt; silent, only a \n&gt; low chuckle coming from her vocators.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Grimlock, Lord Elder, and Legacy fired at the incoming\n&gt; sweeps, their \n&gt; firepower combined with that of the shuttle and Ark is\n&gt; great indeed! \n&gt; Explosions dotted the skies as many sweeps attempted to\n&gt; dodge the \n&gt; fire and are unsuccessful.\n&gt; \n&gt; However the sweeps were becoming more cagey as the fight\n&gt; continued, \n&gt; as if they were learning from the deaths of the previous\n&gt; ones, \n&gt; becoming more skilled, even seeming to anticipate attacks! \n&gt; \n&gt; Even Scorponok and Zarak are feeling these repercussions.\n&gt; Their \n&gt; attack from the rear bit a large sized hole in the minion\n&gt; formation \n&gt; as the fusion cannon, rockets and machine guns rip into the\n&gt; mass. Yet \n&gt; for the G2 Decepticons it was like shaking a bee-hive. At\n&gt; the first \n&gt; they had not been attacked as the Sweeps had been ignoring \n&gt; Decepticons and Predicons, but that changed with this\n&gt; attack! As more \n&gt; sweeps maneuvered through the air to fill in the hole\n&gt; opened by \n&gt; Scorponok and Zarak, disintegration cannons opened fire on\n&gt; them, the \n&gt; air filling with a slight burning smell!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Jhiaxus and Myrmidon headed into the mass of the sweeps,\n&gt; and the \n&gt; sweeps enfolded them, twisting and turning. The jets were\n&gt; more agile \n&gt; then the sweeps, but the sweeps seemed to be well armored,\n&gt; and \n&gt; possesed a rather large numerical advantage. \n&gt; \n&gt; Shots are fired on both sides, Jhiaxus and Myrmidon both\n&gt; taking down \n&gt; several sweeps at a time, but these seem to be replaced by\n&gt; a \n&gt; seemingly endless number of them. \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As Dark Rodimus arrived it was becoming obvious to the\n&gt; casual \n&gt; observer that even though many of the sweeps had been\n&gt; destroyed, \n&gt; there were still many of them in the skies. The smell of\n&gt; burnt metal \n&gt; and alloy was begining to fill the air, as smoke covered\n&gt; the ground \n&gt; obscuring vision of many. \n&gt; \n&gt; However even through all that the aerial form of Cyclonus\n&gt; stood out, \n&gt; resplendent and majestic, like an emperor looking over the\n&gt; land he \n&gt; will soon conquer! \n&gt; \n&gt; As Dark Rodimus&#39; firepower reaches into the skies,\n&gt; Cyclonus turned \n&gt; toward it as if at the last moment detecting it, but it is\n&gt; too late! \n&gt; Power ripped through his systems as circuits are\n&gt; temporarily \n&gt; overloaded and his once pristine armor is singed, scorched\n&gt; and \n&gt; pitted! \n&gt; \n&gt; Inwardly Cyclonus smiled as he knew who it was that did\n&gt; this: Rodimus \n&gt; had arrived!\n&gt; \n&gt; Flipping through the skies by the power of the blast it\n&gt; took a moment \n&gt; for Cyclonus to regain his bearing in the air. As he\n&gt; leveled out, \n&gt; already sweeps were rallying to his aid, bringing their\n&gt; cannons to \n&gt; bear on Rodimus and opening up on him!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;NO!&quot; Cyclonus called to them, his voice\n&gt; radiating power and \n&gt; authority.  &quot;He is mine!&quot;  he commanded as he\n&gt; launched twin \n&gt; incendiary missiles at Rodimus, ones that glowed like\n&gt; miniature twin \n&gt; suns, as they seemed to almost glide foward toward Rodimus!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It is time!&quot; barked Scourge across the minion\n&gt; communication network, \n&gt; even as he watched his commander and friend get pulled into\n&gt; the fray. \n&gt; His gruff voice crackled in the ears of Nightstrike,\n&gt; Darkfate and \n&gt; Tummult. \n&gt; \n&gt; With a single command sweeps pulled out and away, launching\n&gt; from the \n&gt; center of the group. They did not target Rodimus or the\n&gt; Decepticons! \n&gt; Instead nearly a third of the remaining sweep moved at\n&gt; their primary \n&gt; target, led by Scourge, and Tummult (and Darkfate and\n&gt; Nightstrike??), \n&gt; with cannons blazing they pushed towards the ARK!\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
