This is a heavy laser rifle (for reference, look at\n&gt; &quot;Aftermath&quot;, which was after the Other Voices parts, in that western-like\n&gt; fight between Maxis and Preds).  At point blank range, that gun would&#39;ve\n&gt; blown a frickin&#39; hole in Suukie&#39;s GUT!  I urge you to repost that Code.\nThe\n&gt; weapon has a power pack, it doesn&#39;t depend on the power of Stinkbomb&#39;s\n&gt; energy.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Find long lost high school friends:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4056/10/_/_/_/959130849/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
