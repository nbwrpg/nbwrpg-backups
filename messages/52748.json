He had only taken mild damage from the blow of the shields.  Looking over at the ship which was now clearly active, he began to calculate a way to get back in.\n\nSince this ship had no crew and the defences were up there must have been a provision for crew returning and needing to get in.  Celeron scanned radio frequencies... No radio signals, no active radio receivers anywhere in range.  How did they get through?  Infrared remote?  He aimed at the main shield generator on top of the bridge dome.  No effect, the shields aparently kept out all energy including infrared.  There had been a face announcing the defences...  could that have been AI?  As stupid as he felt about this he crawled down the hill up within inches of the shield.\n\n&quot;Computer!?!&quot;\n&quot;Yes&quot;\nFinally he was getting results.\n&quot;Lower the defence systems.&quot;\n&quot;Authorization code?&quot;\nHe scanned the computer, the only numbers that he got back were the shield&#39;s frequencies.\n&quot;Authorization code....&quot;\n&quot;Perimeter cannons will activate in 10....&quot;\n&quot;One moment, the code is coming back to me.&quot;\n&quot;Eight...&quot;\n&quot;Celeron, Authorization code: 101110110010110010?&quot;\n&quot;Five...&quot;\nHe looked around...this was a private cruiser not a government military ship.  Out of tricks, he decided to fall back.\n&quot;Two...One...&quot;\nAs Celeron flew back up to the hill he was grazed in the back by fire from the ship&#39;s cannons.  He would have to institute a new strategy.\n\n\n__________________________________________________________\nOutgrown your current e-mail service?
