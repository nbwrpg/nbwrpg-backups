Me=\r\nrely sighing, &quot;So, what else do we know?  And what can we expect when there=\r\n we go?  If this is over ea patrol, we may end up giong down the hole.  Som=\r\ne backup would be nice, in case we encounter something gunniing for us turb=\r\no-mice.  What are we to do, when we encounter something unfriendly unlike y=\r\nou?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf this was a sweeping patrol in attempt to locate the missin=\r\ng RODIMUS, the trio of them would not exactly be in much of a position over=\r\n to do anything if they found him, given something which could damage or co=\r\nrrupt RODIMUS would be way outside of thier combat abilities, even wtih the=\r\n new upgrades of STRAIGHT SHOT&#39;s quill darts.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo, LEO PRIME and TU=\r\nSCON not being the sort to send out a suicide mission, WHEELIE&#39;s processor =\r\ngave him two possibilities that iether this was going to be a simulated mis=\r\nsion and out in teh field there would be other MAXIMALS or traps setup ahea=\r\nd to make the trio of them cooperate to have to bypass them.  Either that o=\r\nr if this was a true patrol, then they would expected to immediatley respon=\r\nd back if they encountered anything and to not engage in the slightest bit =\r\nof combat.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email =\r\n--&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-50--1048985296--\r\n\n"}}
