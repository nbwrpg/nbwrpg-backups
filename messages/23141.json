He pushes a button to send HotRod a transmission.\n\n&quot;Welcome back, HotRod,&quot; he says. The Maximal hadn&#39;t been at base for a \nwhile, &quot;We&#39;re about to have a meeting, please report to the conference \nroom.&quot;\n\nThe Maximal looks up as Lunarpine and company enter, looking the three \nover.\n\n&quot;Hello. I&#39;m assuming you came for the meeting. Please sit down.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine followed the scent to the meeting room. the door opened \nand he\n&gt; faced a handful of other bots, some he knew some were strangers. \n(Who&#39;s at\n&gt; the meeting so far?) he entered followed by Ice and Razor Claw. Ice\n&gt; transformed to her robot mode, a bots head on a furry body with \nclaws and\n&gt; Polar bear legs. she couldn&#39;t fully transform, this was as close as \nshe\n&gt; could come. &quot;I never imagined there were so many of us&quot;She thought \nas they\n&gt; entered\n&gt; \n&gt; Razor Claw transformed to bot mode and looked around. it was hard \nfor him to\n&gt; fathom that one day he might be linked to one of these bots. If \nVeratis&#39;\n&gt; dreams came true there wouldn&#39;t be any factions, there would be only \none.(No\n&gt; highlander reference intended.) He glanced around the room, all the \nbots\n&gt; looked more like targets than allies to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Razor Claw calm down, we&#39;re not here to fight, we&#39;re here because \nthey need\n&gt; us, and we need them.&quot; she telepathically tried to calm him but his \nemotions\n&gt; were filled with fear and hatred for every bot in the room. A \nveritable fuse\n&gt; waiting to reach the firecracker, all he needed was an excuse \n\n\n"}}
