She swept low, he moved to the \nside, trying his damndest to stay ahead of her. In the wild the beast \nhad to stay ahead of the hunter, or end up lunch. Even though they \nwere only playing, he had to be a wolf, in both actions and reactions.\n\n&quot;Catch me if you can Wing, If you&#39;re beast enough.&quot; Lunarpine had to \nrattle her chains a little, if she couldn&#39;t handle a little ribbing \nthen she couldn&#39;t handle a real fight. The soldier in him had to know \nfor sure who he could depend on when the firefight began.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She laughed.&quot;Oh really?

She \n&gt; felt the owl in her self start to fly again. She had a smile on her \nface and \n&gt; the wind under her wings.  She saw him running along just ahead of \nher.  He \n&gt; looked happy and free.  He was like a puppy again.  Running with \nthe wind in \n&gt; his face and his tongue hanging out.  She laughed. He looked happy \nto just \n&gt; be running again. Without worry or care, just having fun again.  \nShe flew \n&gt; after him and came up behind him.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to catch you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---Original message---\n&gt; From:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wed Jul 5, 2000 7:08pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Was Lunarpines response,&quot;Better yet, how about a\n&gt; game of tag,I haven&#39;t tracked airborne prey in a long time.&quot;\n&gt; Lunarpine was anxious for a challenge, and a little fun.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh by the way, &quot;YOU&#39;RE IT&quot; he reached up and gave Shadow Wing a\n&gt; smack, as he transformed to Wolf mode and ran off.
