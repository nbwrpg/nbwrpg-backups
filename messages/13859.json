As soon as Iron Raptor \nsaid yes, she would run out into the halland call CyberShark about \nthe good new.  She thought, How could a Maximal leader refuse the \npossablilty of peace.  She looked at Iron Raptor.  &quot;I know it sounds \ntoo good to be true, but I am asking that you join us.&quot;  She looked \ndown and thought for a moment.  &quot;If if would make a difference.  I&#39;ll \nstay here and you can follow my friend back to our embassy.  Your \nfriends here can keep a gun to my head untill you return.  I&#39;m \noffering my life in the hopes you will join in the peace talks.&quot;\n\nShe knew CyberShark wouldn&#39;t be too happy about this if he had just \nheard her say what she just said.  \n\n\n"}}
