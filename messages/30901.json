He\nthen responded to the comm links, &quot;Astroblast, refuel, we will need you\nsoon. Stunticons, you are all dismissed, Terrorcons, Terrorcons,&quot; Megatron\nwas having problems reaching them. He shut down his comm-link, and left the\nroom. &quot;Worry about Condor later Switchblade, we have a world to take.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
