Until then his only existence was as cells from \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; transmetal T-Rex Megatron and a large Maximal dragon named \n&gt; Necromancer.\n&gt; &gt; Since Veratis&#39; past hasn&#39;t really been revealed as to where he \ngot \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; protoforms he&#39;s been &quot;Improving&quot; (Experimenting on with a mutant \n&gt; virus which\n&gt; &gt; removes most signs of a robot form) I&#39;m sure something can be \n&gt; worked out,\n&gt; &gt; maybe have Stallex attacked by a bot resembling Megaton. A \n&gt; resemblance of\n&gt; &gt; his former mode might exist through the DNA replication. This \ncould \n&gt; open a\n&gt; &gt; rivalry between him and a few bots in the game. (Necromancer, \n&gt; Veratis,\n&gt; &gt; Megaton, just to name three.)\n&gt; &gt; Sound OK to you? either that or we&#39;ll just say a future temporal \n&gt; anomaly\n&gt; &gt; will send Megaton back in time to when Stallex was young but it \n&gt; hasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; happened to him yet. (If theres anyone who understands temporal \n&gt; physics\n&gt; &gt; please explain them to me, I&#39;m getting a headache just thinking \n&gt; about it.)\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 11:32 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: angry\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex had improved,but his dad was furious and figting harder \n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ever so Stallex was being crushed.
