In a sector of what we know\nas the milky way in the past there is a planet ravaged by a war and still\nto be ravaged in the future. Filled with countless life, oceans, and land\nmasses a small planet could forever change the future. In all its natural\nglory the badlands of this planet earth has a scaring remain of the first\nbattle, a space cruiser of sorts sticks out of this land as it dosent\nbelong, the predacon shuttle stolen by a band of renegade predacons. As we\nzoom in we see it has not been used in a while and all but abandond, almost.\n\nA fimiliar hum emits from the wreckage underneath the dry molten rock. In a\nmelodic form a voice unheard speaks.\n\n\n&quot;Stored enough energy for emergency frequency. Initiating&quot; at that the\nmelodical voice stops and begins to radio any cybertronian frequency.\n\n&quot;Emergency, cybertronian unit off line, in need of assistance&quot; beams the\ncomputer. &quot;In need of assistance, head to these coordinates imidiatly.....&quot;\nAs the unheard noise go&#39;s offline everything returns to normal, as it\nshould be.\n\n\n\n"}}
