You and him usually post minutes apart, and \nwhen you can&#39;t post, by a magical coincidence he can&#39;t post either.)\n\nVulois\n\nVulois looks at Windrazor and Terradive.\n\n&quot;This is what I like to call the &quot;nerve center of the mountain. Eight \ndifferent tunnels to go through. One leads to my lair, seven will \nlead deeper and deeper into the mountain with twists and turns that \nyou won&#39;t remember your way back, and the last one leads to a giant \nlake of Alligators. We have a 1/8 chance that we will end up in the \nright one. But I think this is the one. Follow me.&quot;\n\nVulois heads down one of the tunnels.\n______________________________________________________________________\nFliq\n\nFliq leads Ramulus to the hull around the  mid-section.\n\n&quot;Okay, this should do. Let&#39;s wait for Brix.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix\n\nBrix walks into the storage room and finds a box full of tools.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s in here somewhere. I&#39;ll just take the box.&quot;\n\nJust than Brix thought he heard the sound of footsteps.\n\n&quot;Huh? Wha? Forget it. My imagination.&quot;\n\nBrix heads down to where Fliq and Ramulus are, but the sound still \nfollows....\n(Ooh! Spooky.)\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream heres the yelling of words between KitKat and Testifyer. \nHe runs out of his room and does a flip over Testifyer&#39;s head, \npulling out his two blasters in the process. He landed, turned around \nand put them against Testifyer&#39;s head.\n\n&quot;Do that again, and so help me Matrix I&#39;l blow your f&#39;n head off.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron saw that Reptillica was handling it, and went back to his post.\n______________________________________________________________________\nZava\n\nZava watched as Deemos made plans.\n\n&quot;What?!? No Destruction! Please tell me it&#39;s the back-up plan!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
