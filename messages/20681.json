The \nwork drones combined with \n\n&quot;Excellent,&quot; he says, activating his comm-link, &quot;All bots step back, \nthe Alliance base is coming back in.&quot;\n\nThe shuttles carrying the Alliance base begin to move closer \ntogether. The Alliance base will need to be connected in the air and \nthen lowered.\n\nThe Alliance commander looks down at his wrist comp, studying the \nscanning reports he had noticed earlier. The Predacons were \ndefinitely doing something...\n\nThe Predacons in that base were not his allies. Zardus&#39; eyes narrow \nas he sees the spark signatures of Megatron and Hell Beast. He pushes \na few buttons, opening a channel to the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n&quot;Maximals,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;The Predacon base is displaying \nsome activity that you might want to check. It could have something \nto do with you, I suggest you check it out. Megatron and Hell Beast \nare involved.&quot;\n\nHe ends the transmission, opening his comm to the Alliance again.\n\n&quot;Oblitercons, WarMachines, Chosen Ones, Dark One, Flesh Ripper, Dark \nClaw, Scattershot, Sixshot, Ares,&quot; he looks across the island, seeing \nthe four Predacons, &quot;And you four, report to me, I have a mission for \nyou.&quot;\n\nA plan was forming in his mind. If the Maximals supported him in \nthis, and pronably even if they didn&#39;t, he could take out an enemy \nPredacon base.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemolition exits the Iron Fist, having put Zergling in a CR chamber, \nset it to put him into stasis lock, locked it, and ordered the \nautoguns to take him out if he emerged.\n\n&quot;You wanted to see me?&quot; he says, walking toward Zardus.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc swears as he looses Cybershark&#39;s signature, turning around and \nrecieving Zardus&#39; transmission.\n\nGoing full speed, he sets off for the Iron Fist.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer frowns. &quot;Hmm.. We don-AAAHH!!&quot;\n\nHe&#39;s thrown to his feet again as the shuttles begin to unite the \nAlliance base in midair, the floor shaking more then ever.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m gonna give Zardus a piece of my mind after this!!&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica sighs, getitng to his feet, Bloodystrike doing the same \nright next to him.\n\n&quot;I guess we&#39;re movi-AAAHH!!&quot; both bots are thrown to the floor again, \nBloodystrike sliding down the hallway as the Alliance base shakes \nagain.\n\n\n"}}
