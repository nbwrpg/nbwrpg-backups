The computerized\nvoice directed it&#39;s comments to Ignatius, &quot;Now that you see who&#39;s in charge\nI think you can behave. I have a few suggestions you may want to follow.&quot; it\npaused while Ignatius was unfrozen by the Stasis field. &quot;1, none of the\nprisoners are to be harmed unless we need an example, you may use this one.&quot;\nthe computer showed a diagram of the Trainer bridge and the figure of Ramjet\nlit up. &quot;2 I SUGGEST opening a line of communication with the attackers.&quot;\nIt had scanned the files and found that they had at least 2 high ranking\nPredacons trapped that would bring a high price.&quot;3 I&#39;ve directed all power\nfrom the defenses in the cargo bays to the shields if your friend needs a\nplace to go she will be safe there.&quot; He was referring to Zoe but he avoided\nuseing names to keep the prisoners from gaining any knowledge.\n\nIgnatius aproached the comm and transmitted sirections to the nearest cargo\nhold to Zoe. The lone Trainer then opened a comm outside the base to the\nattacking forces. &quot;You don&#39;t seem to understand the gravity of the\nsituation, You can&#39;t hurt us from where you are, I on the other hand can do\nanything I want to your associates.&quot; He waited a moment for the Pred troops\nto let it sink in. &quot;You may set your weapons down and leave or seal the fate\nof your associates.&quot; he decided to use the example opening visual he scanned\nRamjet for his transforming cog. He held up his arm and fired a low level\nblast at the mechanisms location. the bot wouldn&#39;t be destroyed, but there&#39;d\nbe no way for him to transform which would take any possability of the jets\ncombining into thier gestault. The other benefit was that as long as the\nopen wound was in the stasis field it wouldn&#39;t heal giving the attackers\nmore incentive to  decide what to do. &quot;Leave your weapons and go home and\nI&#39;ll release them, fail to do so will result in this bots termination\nshortly followed by the same fate for the others.&quot;\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, June 11, 2001 12:06 PM\nSubject: Re: Mesage to Scyther, Starscream, Endbringer, Demise.\n\n\n&gt; Oh good. Scyther is a flyer :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Scyther/Incarcinator/Demise::\n&gt;\n&gt; Scyther flies back a bit more, deciding that this was a safe enough\n&gt; distance. He then aims his charge launcher at Hellpeon and fires four\n&gt; charges.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Incarcinator continues to fly up, dodging several blasts and firing a\n&gt; shot at the Trainer base (very fast, explosive shell). His gaining\n&gt; altitude allowed him to see most shots and dodge them before they got\n&gt; close. Aiming at Hellpeon, Incarcinator fires two more shells at him.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Demise continues to run, several autogun blasts denting the armor on\n&gt; his back. He jumps behind a hill for cover, wishing that someone\n&gt; would exit the ship so that he could tear them apart.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; They&#39;d be able to detect footprints in the sand unless he&#39;s flying\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;d only be able to guess where he&#39;d be.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
