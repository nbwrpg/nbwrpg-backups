Fuji heading West.  Not Far to go to reach the Decepticon base.  \n\nNeedlenose flew right behind.  Looking to Spinister he whispered &quot;God he is obsessed with power.&quot;\n\nScrapper flew behind them in robot form, hopefully with the rest of the Contructicons behind.\n\n0-------------------------------------------------------------------------0\n\nTremor drove to the edge of the main island they were based on.  &quot;Water, great, now what Heater&quot;\n\nHeater jumped out looking.  &quot;Are  you really that dense Tremor.&quot;  Heater transformed to his dual photon pistol.  Firing off seven shots taking out trees. &quot;Tiptop attach those to Tremors treads, we are going to float across.&quot;\n\nTremor looked at Heater, then transformed.  &quot;Or you know, we could just like fly across&quot;  Grabbing Heater and  Tiptop in their respective weapon forms he jumped into the air flying off his base island and towards another group of islands somewhat south-east of them.\n0-------------------------------------------------------------------------0\n\nDarkwing and Dreadwind looked to each other.  &quot;Well these two don&#39;t seem interested in surrendering control, but they will when Havotron is done with them&quot; Dreadwind said.\n\n&quot;Ya whatever&quot; came the reply from Darkwing.\n\n&quot;Lets go&quot;\n\n&quot;AWW slag, I have to join with you again&quot;\n\n&quot;Lets just go you pile of rust.&quot;\n\nThey both jumped into the air forming two jets, then the two jets formed one.  They blasted off to the east almost at the Decepticon base.  \n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
