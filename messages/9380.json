She went to \nthe lab and looked around.  She saw the viles that had the mind \nnumbing liquid in it.  She had used it on Dracona.  It would do the \nsame for Quickstrike.  It would stop the pain and hopefully make him \nfeel better.  She grabbed a vile and a needle.  She filled the needle \nand walked over to Quickstrike.\n\n&quot;I have something that might take away the pain.&quot; she looked at him \nand wanted to help him.\n&quot;Please let me give this to you.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
