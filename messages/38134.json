The \nprojectiles\n&gt; from the machine guns seemed to follow him. The eaglebots body, \nbattered and\n&gt; beaten on throughout the battle was denting and beginning to crack. \nHe\n&gt; landed behind a sand dune hopeing that the cover would be enough to \nprotect\n&gt; him. He stuck his head and left arm up fireing a missle towards \nDrillbit. At\n&gt; this point he was trying to save some amunition since there were \nlogically\n&gt; more than one Predacon left to battle against.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, June 23, 2001 9:05 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Kill the Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He jumps to the side, the last three energy shots hitting his \nleft leg.\n&gt; &gt; He gets to a kneeling position and take aim at Ignatius.
