Man, a giant robot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Astral flew up into the air, as did Fenox.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        &quot;Oblitertron, I&#39;ve faced gestalts like you before, you\n&gt; &gt; scum!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ll take you down!!!!&quot; Then, Fenox tapped Astral&#39;s shoulder.  \nHe\n&gt; &gt; turned.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;Ah.....Zardus, is it???

BURN!!!!!!  LET THE\n&gt; &gt; DARKNESS\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CONTROL THE HEAT!!!!&quot; Then, suddenly, things started happening.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        The Lavacons&#39; bodies started changing a bit(ok, a lot).\n&gt; &gt; Their optics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went redder, and not just firey red, the normal way, they were\n&gt; &gt; evillish red.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And, all of their bodies changed from burning reds and oranges, \nto\n&gt; &gt; evil,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evil, blacks and reds.  An evil grin spread across each one&#39;s \nface,\n&gt; &gt; being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shown only by the fire in each one&#39;s mouth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Astral, or, what was Astral, said, &quot;HHHHAAAHHHHAAAA!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MUAHAHA!!!!  Oblitertron.....Oh, stupid Oblitertron!!!!  Stupid\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Zardus!!!!!!!  AHAH!!!  Now, you&#39;ve caused us to reach one of \nour\n&gt; &gt; superior\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forms!!!!!  HAHAHA!!!!!!  Now, we are the Dark Lavacons!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nHAAAAHAAAHAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OHHAAAA!!!!!&quot; He laughed, evilishly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &quot;Come on Dark Lavacons, while we crush these Alliance\n&gt; &gt; fools, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can have fun at the same time!!!&quot; Astral said, laughing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Recklessa was even more dangerous now.  She grabbed her\n&gt; &gt; gatling guns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and fired around the area, burning all the trees and stuff down.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Griplash grabbed his sword, and cut through trees,\n&gt; &gt; destroying stuff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Starlight cackled as she shot her crossbow everywhere, \nmaking\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ground go on fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Fenox fired his optic lazers at Zardus, except, being a \nDark\n&gt; &gt; Lavacon,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fenox didn&#39;t put any major effort into it, no feel.  Just fired \nit\n&gt; &gt; for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hell of destroying things.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Astral laughed so evil, as he was in the air, firing \nflame\n&gt; &gt; rockets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everywhere in sight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         The Dark Lavacons are completely evil, the only thing \nthey\n&gt; &gt; want to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do is destroy things, they will even shoot at eachother, the\n&gt; &gt; shooter not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; caring, and the one getting hit not carring.  DESTROY is their \nmain\n&gt; &gt; theme.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Skulletron::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Skulletron suddenly started to wake up.  Uggh, where was \nhe??\n&gt; &gt; (He&#39;s in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a CR right???)  Ah ha, he was in a CR Chamber.  He wanted to get\n&gt; &gt; out, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; better be careful.  He stepped out of the CR, and started \nrunning,\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Feline&#39;s workshop(or where ever the hell she was).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      He looked at Hot Rod, then at Feline.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      &quot;Fe...Fe..Line......Feline........Man, am I GLAD to see\n&gt; &gt; you!!!  Help\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me!!!!  QUICK!!!!  What do I do....These Maxi&#39;s will be all \nover me\n&gt; &gt; now, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ran as fast as I possibly could to get here, to hide.  Cover \nme??&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Then,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Skulletron looked at Hot Rod again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      &quot;Wow, Hot Rod, lookin&#39; good!!!&quot; He commented.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
