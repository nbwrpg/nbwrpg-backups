(I&#39;ll be bringing in a Maxi soon)\n&gt; \n&gt; The Preds need a mechanic so Switchblade is joining.\n&gt; \n&gt; |---Megatron---|\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron ignores his minions as they proceed to do as ordered. A \n&gt; nagging feeling tugs as his mind as he recalls the bots who decided \n&gt; to join his team. Of all the bots who showed up, only one hadn&#39;t \n&gt; made his appearance yet, Switchblade.\n&gt; \n&gt; As if on queue, two glowing green eyes shift position, and a dark \n&gt; green and black, 3.5 foot tall bot strolls in from one of the dimly \n&gt; lit corridors. Megatron&#39;s eyes narrow as the nonchalant bot makes \n&gt; his way towards the Predacon leader. &quot;Switchblade...&quot; says Megatron.\n&gt; \n&gt; |---Switchblade---|\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade hops over some debri, and lands himself right in from \nof \n&gt; Megatron, only to receive a devastating blow to the upper torso by \n&gt; from a irritated Megatron. &quot;I suppose I was asking for that, &#39;o \n&gt; mighty Megstron.&quot; He maintains a sarcastic tone, only partially \n&gt; masking his respect and fear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Getting back up, he dusts himself off, and turns to face the \n&gt; leader. &quot;So, what needs to be done? I see that the ship was... \n&gt; damaged... to say the least in the atmospheric entry. I&#39;m guessing \n&gt; that Repairs are necessary...&quot; he sighs almost dejectedly, but \nperks \n&gt; up immediately.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron ignores the smaller bot&#39;s antics, &quot;Yes, repairs do need \n&gt; doing. Your first task is to help Perceptor fix the scanners, and \n&gt; then you can salvage the parts from the engine.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade nods. &quot;Alright.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He hops over to Perceptor, and punches the larger bot in the \n&gt; knee, &quot;Alright ya heap, what have ya done so far?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
