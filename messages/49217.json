They may have working \ndefenses...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the other side of the base, group Trian was getting close. Tyrael \nknew what that meant. He prepared some shards, ready to throw them.\n\nTyrael: Talon, get ready. We attack on my mark... NOW!\n\nHe sent two light shards flying at the base. He wanted to test the \nshields, so no need to use the big thing right away.\n\n\n"}}
