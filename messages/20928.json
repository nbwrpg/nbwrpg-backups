She was dreaming of sparring \nwith him as in the old days. She smiled. In her dream, he stood up \nand said to her, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid Wing. I didn&#39;t risk spark and limb \nto save you just to see you brought down by a flu bug, we&#39;ll get you \nthrough this I promise.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but smile.  She knew that \nhe meant it. \n\nShe awoke a little while later. She yawned and stretched and stood \nup. She looked around the lab and wondered where she was allowed to \ngo in the base. She hoped she would ba able to find something to do. \nBeing a big bear cooped up in one room for days on end was not her \nidea of fun. She looked around and thought to Veratis, &quot;What am I to \ndo now? What will happen with these new modes that I have?&quot;\n\nShe felt a tickle in her nose and she sneezed. But in doing so, she \nchanged from polar bear into her halfling form.  She looked up at her \nwings and sighed. &quot;This is going to drive me bonkers. What good is \nthis half form going to accomplish, other than instill fear into \nother for not knowing what I am.&quot; Then the thought entered her mind. \nShe had three forms. No one but they knew this. She could approach a \nbot in one form and attack in another. She could also get cought or \ncaptured in one form and then use another form to escape. She was \nfinally seeing the possabilities of her new body. She smiled and \nchuckled to herself. &quot;Oh wouldn&#39;t those preds get a big suprize if \nthey ever saw me again.&quot; she chuckled. She almost wanted to go into \nbattle, just to see thier reaction to her changing.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis spoke openly to Lunarpine as if Ice weren&#39;t there. There \nwas no\n&gt; sense trying to hide anything from her. He knew that her telepathic \npowers\n&gt; weren&#39;t in her control. &quot;We have to find a way to control this. \nRight now\n&gt; she&#39;s on the verge of either insanity or corruption.&quot; He feared for \nher if\n&gt; she ever deciced to use this power improperly. &quot;I&#39;ll work with her \nbut\n&gt; you&#39;ll have to help too.&quot; He turned back to Ice. &quot;Rest for now \nyoung one,\n&gt; you have alot of hard work ahead of you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine watched as Ice fell asleep. He could still hear her voice \nrambling\n&gt; on in a tired, half asleep dilogue. He moved closer to her and \nplaced a hand\n&gt; on her head. &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid Wing. I didn&#39;t risk spark and limb to \nsave you\n&gt; just to see you brought down by a flu bug, we&#39;ll get you through \nthis I\n&gt; promise.&quot; He started out the door but felt the urge to stop. He \nturned back\n&gt; as if to say something. &quot;Just wait till our next match, we&#39;ll see \njust what\n&gt; your new form can do.&quot; He knew ?Veratis could only hear his \nthoughts if Ice\n&gt; broadcast them to him.\n\n\n\n"}}
