That is deep enough. I can feel the\n&gt; energon!\n&gt; \n&gt; He aimed with his laser and melted the last barrier.\n&gt; Under his eyes, \n&gt; the energon sphere pulsated. The build-up started\n&gt; working its effect \n&gt; on him, but he took no mention of it. What he had in\n&gt; a arm&#39;s length \n&gt; was much more better...\n&gt; He moved his hand and tried to break a piece from\n&gt; the sphere. However, \n&gt; what happened was not what he had planned. The\n&gt; energon began to \n&gt; vibrate at the touch, soon making the ground shake\n&gt; and emitting a \n&gt; strange and strident sound.\n&gt; For one of the first time in his life, Warhead was\n&gt; awed. He felt not \n&gt; fear, because his programs did not permit him, but\n&gt; he was very \n&gt; impressed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warhead: PREDACONS! OUT OF THE HOLE NOW!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; This, however, was too late. The sphere imploded and\n&gt; sent a wave of \n&gt; energy towards the surface, and one ray of light\n&gt; jetted in space. It \n&gt; went in all directions in a radius of 5 kilometers.\n&gt; All transformers \n&gt; it hit would be struck down, suddenly overwhelmed by\n&gt; the energon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warhead fell on the ground, in a stasis lock. The\n&gt; predacon base would \n&gt; see that they had lost them...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
