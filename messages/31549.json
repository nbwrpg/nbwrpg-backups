Very little of the shockwave hits him, Prowl&#39;s circuitry straining to keep active, his arms and legs shutting off. He fires two missiles from each of his two wind missile launchers at Fireblade, all of them locking on and following as Prowl gains altitude. He didn&#39;t want any more of those grenades near him.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; ::FireBlade::\n&gt; He continues to stare at Prowl somewhat confused....\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;This is not the usuall result I get from this little trick&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Figureing something is wrong and that his plan won&#39;t work he goes to\n&gt; his more natural methods than thinking...fighting...He quickly pumps\n&gt; out three EMP grenades trying to get them in a 15 m radius of Prowl\n&gt; amd becaus of his movement he becomes uncloaked and begins running for\n&gt; the CF again....\n\n\n"}}
