Sorry, man, but you won. It was either stay and die or live \nto fight another day.\n\n::Killfest/Greven/Scyther/Demise/EndBringer::\n\nKillfest growls as shots hit the foliage around him. Without being \ntold, his team spreads out, making themselves harder to hit. They \nwere all surrounded by trees and bushes, except for Scyther who was \ncloaked above the trees.\n\nKillfest activates the inner communication system of his group. &quot;On \nmy command, turn, aim, and open fire, then resume retreat.&quot;\n\nHe takes a few steps and spinns around. &quot;Now.&quot;\n\nA missile launcher flipping over his shoulder, Killfest fires two \nmissiles at Putam. He pulls a missile launcher out of a side \ncompartment, firing two more. The missiles turn, locking on to Putam \nand following him. Killfest turns, resuming the run again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven spins around on Killfest&#39;s command, ignoring an energon beam \nthat hit him. He fires four missiles at Akron, and then spins around \nand runs off.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther spins in the air, firing down three charges at Odiphious and \nthen spinning back around and flying off again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise, knowing he had no long-distance weapons to contribute, \ncontinued to smash through threes, most of the bolts missing him as \nhe made his way toward the Predacon cave.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer smiles, listening to Killfest&#39;s orders. He spins around as \ncommanded, firing four signature-seeking missiles at Venus. Spinning \nback around, EndBringer takes off through the bushes again.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Damn it! Just when I sit down to get into the battle Yan has to \npull out. \n&gt; This isnt over!\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron watched the Predacons pull out, or retreat, or do \nwhatever they \n&gt; were going to do. As he recived the information on thier base \nstatus, he was \n&gt; tempted to follow them, and crush them durring there brief \nconfusion. But, \n&gt; looking at the smoldering woods and his hurt predacons he put that \nthought on \n&gt; hold.\n&gt;     &quot;Return to base. Victory is ours once agian. Next time we meet \nwith \n&gt; Killfests bunch, they will not live to see another battle. It will \nend next \n&gt; time.&quot; He said, looking off into the distance, some what entranced.\n&gt; \n&gt;     As for the Energonians, they watched them go. The foursome \nlanded and \n&gt; regrouped briefly. Putnam spoke first: &quot;we will follow them! They \nwill not \n&gt; get away with such a dishonorable escape.&quot;\n&gt;     Akron nodded. Odiphious, with a solem face reminded them of \nOminous with \n&gt; the girl, but Putnam put to rest his worries. The four of them \nturned towrd \n&gt; the fleeing Predacons and pressed after them, taking to the air for \na hasty \n&gt; pursuit. All the while they would send blast after blast at them.\n\n\n"}}
