He snorts angrilly, and gets into beast mode. Rat Trap remains in his beast form, and bristles his own fur.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If I were you chumps I wouldn&#39;t get too cocky!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride joins him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s right plane brains! This time, we&#39;re not gonna go easy on ya!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He rears up in front of Deepstryke, flailing his sharp hooves.\n\n&quot;No Don&#39;t do that.&quot; Legacy said as Quickstride launched foward to get\nat Deepstryke.\n\nMeanwhile drew backwards a little drawing the attacking Quickstride\nback a few steps. As this happened Deepstryke is easily struck with\none of the many flailing hooves that fly at him from Quickstide,\nsending the well armored and hovering Deepstryke, still in his gun\nunit mode back a few meters.\n\nDeepstryke just slide back easily enough, his armor only damaged\nsuperficially, a few scuff marks and a few gouged hoof prints in his\nmetal plating. &quot;An interesting tactic.&quot; Deepstryke said as he\nreoriented his weapons. &quot;As a light calvery unit you ut yourself off\nfrom your primary artillery unit. Not the most advantageous of plans.&quot;\n\n&quot;Computer, engage shield wall.&quot; Deepstryke said as primary weapon\nglowed and then fired! The beam targeting Quickstride, even as the\ntell tale humming noise could be heard of an energy field appearing\nbetween Quickstride and Legacy, perhaps cutting off the Maximals from\nthe aid of the others!\n\nEven as Deepstryke was doing his manuver Phobia took advantage of the\nfact that Rat Trap was focused on Deepstryke and not her. With a blast\nof laser fire sent a swath of energy at Rat Trap!\n\nNightrazor tried to do the same with Legacy, but the large tank turned\nhis turret mounted ion cannon on the ebony colored ex minion and laid\ndown some fire power, sending him back a few steps, his chassis\nsmoking from a few hits. Nightrazor was hurt, but definitely not out\nyet!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
