How dare he? He knew Megatron and knew \n&gt;how\n&gt; &gt; to surive here? To him, Striker might as well be a rookie, with Sinesis.\n&gt;The\n&gt; &gt; greedy fool. As far as he was concerned, he was leader.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He looked up at him, with his crimson eyes burning brightly. &quot;You? No\n&gt; &gt; way,tin-horn! Ah&#39;m in charge! And if Megatron is alive, let me hear it\n&gt;from\n&gt; &gt; &#39;im! Ya don&#39;t know nothin&#39;! Ah&#39;s been here longa than ya. Ah&#39;s seen\n&gt;weirder\n&gt; &gt; slag than ya, so ah&#39;m in charge. Who ya think ya are? Ah&#39;m one of\n&gt;Megatron&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; original troops! Ah knew that Rattrap wasn&#39;t nothin&#39; but trouble. Ah&#39;s\n&gt;say,\n&gt; &gt; ah&#39;m in charge!&quot; He ducked his head at the pain at his leg.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Suddenly, Quickstrike nearly had a spark attack, hearing a foreign \n&gt;voice,\n&gt; &gt; Hiss&#39;. He jerked his head towards him, with his eyes wild. &quot;Who&#39;s \n&gt;friend?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; he asked Hiss. Transulas, he was thinking. Oh, Primus, he hooped so.
