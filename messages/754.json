Carnage was about 2 meters off the ground before they suddenly zoomed up, thanks to the warm rising air under her wings. Slowly but surely the were making it to the island!\n\n&quot;Okay, this is probably the weirdest sight and thing I have ever done, and I bet it looks real weird too, but you can open your eyes Carnage!&quot;\n\nSeeing the raptor keep her eyes firmly closed, she sighs and concentrates on getting to the island.\n\n&quot;There must be a battle, I can see laser shots..&quot; she stops as one array of shots goes everywhere &quot;Woah! Someone&#39;s going crazy!&quot; She laughs\n\nSuddenly the thermal drops, and Teltoli feels a jolt. Oh great the thermal had stopped, but they were only 100 meters away, they were going to make it!\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
