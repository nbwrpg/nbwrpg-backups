Snarling and trying to wriggle a bit loose so she could get a good snap at him, just ONE that ended with his mech fluid on her fangs.\nBut as much as she tried and could not do so, snarling and growling as she continued to snap then with plain annoyance.\nIron Raptor then snapped her head towards Tavatron as she saw Punch head for her out of the corner of her optics, then increasing her struggling as she saw him place his gun at her head.\nShe struggled with all her might to get out of Dark One&#39;s clutches, her optics wide with the fear that Punch just might shoot her.\nBut then quickly turning her head to the side, her captor&#39;s gun simply slamming against her cheek instead of her head.\nThe mech fluid oozed from the fresh wound on her cheek but she didn&#39;t notice the pain much. But then she roared and bared her teeth towards Punch, though her struggling had stopped she still leaned against Dark One&#39;s grasp and towards Tavatron&#39;s tormentor.\nShe stopped struggling for Tavatron&#39;s sake but she wanted Punch to know one thing: The first chance she got his throat was hers!\nHer voice a snarl.*\n\n&quot; FINE! But you better watch your back!&quot;\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
