He \nmoved over, not turning his yellow glowing optics to her.

He gathered \nvaried sized pieces of wood from the side of the cave.\n\n&quot;Are you staying?&quot; he asked Zyber.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
