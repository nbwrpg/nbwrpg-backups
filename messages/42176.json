She turned to \n&gt; Galvatron. &quot;You coming?&quot; And with that, she started running after \nthe \n&gt; two dragons and the cat.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Panzer::\n&gt; She tried regain her control. Her body wasn&#39;t responding like \nnormal. \n&gt; Some of her circuits were shorting out and she couldn&#39;t see except \n&gt; for blurred images. Everything looked like it was in a supper thick \n&gt; fog.  She turned her head up and sniffed the air. Her audio sensors \n&gt; told her that she was being followed. She could tell it was the \npreds \n&gt; she had encountered moments ago.  She started running again in the \n&gt; oppossite direction.  \n&gt; \n&gt; She kept going, not knowing where she was headed.  She knew she was \n&gt; running up hill, then down hill, then back up hill.  Off in the \n&gt; distance, she thought she heard was sounded like thunder. She \nsniffed \n&gt; the air as she ran and could smell the scent of water. A water fall \n&gt; was near by. With luck, she could get tot he bottom of the water \nfall \n&gt; and loose them in the mists. She stayed on her course and hoped \nshe&#39;d \n&gt; make it.\n\n\n"}}
