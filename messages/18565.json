He growls. He was not going to let another shot like that hit \nhim.\n\nZardus looks down at Grenade, Zardus fires two dozen more shots.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThis time, Reptilica was ready. He dives and spins, easily avoiding all the \nshots. He had figured out this bot&#39;s strategy: just fire till the enemy&#39;s \ndead.\n\nReptilica smiles, firing two missiles at Jetstorm and then a rapid succession \nof rifle shots, spread out so they would be very hard to dodge, but careful \nnot to hit the missiles.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc laughs as he sees Beholder fall, another bomb emerging out of the \nWarMachine and flying at Beholder.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA missile explodes against the bottom of Repressor, sending him spiralling \nbefore he recovers.\n\nHe turns in the air, his weapons getting a lock on Gigas and Horn Drill again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike jumps backwards, severe scratches on his chest from Sharpedge&#39;s \nweapon.\n\nHis thrusters activate, sending him flying up and firing multiple shots at \nSharpedge&#39;s neck and head.\n\n"}}
