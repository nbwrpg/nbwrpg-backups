He grouns, \ntossing a charge at Megatron.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer laughs, feeling the heat but paying little attention to \nit. He turns, his tentacles raising Tankorr in the way of Marine&#39;s \nmissiles. EndBringer increases the voltage his tentacles were putting \nthrough Tankorr.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven growls as a bot lands on his back. He reaches behind him, \ntrying to grab Aerostreak and toss him off. He swings at Terrorsaur \nwith his other hand as he approaches the bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther slies upward, a lasso passing underneath him. Two energon \nshots hit Darkmouse, but he keeps safe. Scyther flies further upward.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise ripps another tree out of his way. He was close now.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGoldneye falls toward the ground, thrown around a bit by the wing \nMegaton had created earlier.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Screaming at the firepower of Starscream, Nighteyes sprints \nas fast as \n&gt; her bleeding legs carry her. By far, she is the most damaged \nPredacon in this \n&gt; whole mess.\n&gt;        Looking back at her attacker, she jumps and manuvers herself \nup into a \n&gt; large tree. There, she waits only a moment before leaping from the \ngreen \n&gt; brush of leaves and asending on Starscream with two pistols raining \ndown \n&gt; blasts on him. As the shots fall, so do the drops of mech off of \nher body.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Megatron watches as Killfest come back with four more \nexplosion \n&gt; blasts. He braced himself, and was sent rolling violently. He got \nup 50 yards \n&gt; further from him. With one eye gone, and now a middle finger \nsnapped off \n&gt; somewhere, and a portion of his hip to accompany it, he was leaking \nmech.\n&gt;        He held out his Tailgun, and fired 15 shots after Killfest. \nSome aimed \n&gt; for him legs, others at his chest, and three for his face. Megatron \nwas going \n&gt; to damage this bot, there was no escaping it. He wanted to put \nKillfest \n&gt; through misery.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tankkor began to rip the tenticles off of his large Vhicon \nbody, but \n&gt; they began to overwheal the titan. He yelled, thrashed, and sent \noff shots \n&gt; into mid air. Turning, he aimed for a tree and fired.\n&gt;        The tree burst into a spectacular fire freenzy and soon, the \n&gt; neighboring trees around it became engulfed. The battle scene soon \nbecame an \n&gt; inferno, complete with falling brush, smoke, ash, and an incredible \nheat.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Marine winced as a branch covered in flames fell near him. \nHe looked \n&gt; at Endbringer, and bent down on one knee, coughing from the smoke. \nHe aimed \n&gt; his missle launcher for Endbringers back, where he assumed the \ntenticles \n&gt; sprouted from. He fired five deafining bursts.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tarantulas slowly backed away, his face cover, &quot;Oh no...&quot; He \nrasped \n&gt; silently, waiting to get hit by Greven. He held out his gun in \nfront of his \n&gt; and fired a round of 25 blasts at him.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Aerostreak dives to Grevens back, two of his claws extended \nand aimed \n&gt; to dig into the bots backside.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Akron sees Scather disappear, but she continues forward. The \nshound of \n&gt; the struggling kept her on his trail. She sent out 4 energon blasts \nin a \n&gt; line, one of them bound to hit him.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Putnam was sent slamming itno a tree, one engulfed in fire. \nHe jetted \n&gt; back into the sky, now with a light singe covering his silver \narmor. He \n&gt; watched as Akron fired on Scyther and Darkmouse, with a slight clue \nto what \n&gt; direction they were in. He joined her.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Odiphious and Venus rise to join Putnam and Akron. Now with \nDarkmouse \n&gt; invisable, it would be difficult to hit her from the ground. Venus, \nwith her \n&gt; lasso, tossed it out in the direction of the shots.\n\n\n"}}
