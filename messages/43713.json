The story s=\r\no far has been the \n&gt; play by Gorzo.  Gorzo, A rookie from Crystal Universi=\r\nty is 30 for 34 \n&gt; shots made.  10 3-pointers and 15 dunks for a total of 5=\r\n0 points.  \n&gt; But can the last rank Gorrilaz with the help of Gorzo beat th=\r\ne first \n&gt; rank Ballers?  Lets go down to the court to see what happens.  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Court Side Announcer:  Hello, we have 20 secounds left in the game. \n =\r\n\n&gt; The Gorrilaz are passing in the ball as we speak.\n&gt; \n&gt; A bot wearing a j=\r\nersey that says &quot;Bentals&quot; passes the ball in to a \n&gt; bot wearing a jersey t=\r\nhats says &quot;Gorzo&quot;.  Gorzo Dribbles the ball \n&gt; down the court and passes it=\r\n to a bot with a jersey that says &quot;Bob&quot;. \n \n&gt; Bob then passes it to Bentals=\r\n and Bentals passes it a bot with the \n&gt; jersey that says &quot;Micko&quot;.  Micko p=\r\nasses the ball to Bentals and \n&gt; Bentals passes it to Gorzo.  Gorzo steps u=\r\np to the 3-point line and \n&gt; jumps up making it look like a jump shot.  At =\r\nthe last second he \n&gt; passes it to a jumping bot, which is by the goal, who=\r\nse jersey \n&gt; reads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned then slams the ball for an Alley-op(SP?).  =\r\nBots \n&gt; with a different jersey grab the ball.  The bots jersey \n&gt; Reads &quot;F=\r\neller&quot;.  Feller passes the ball in to a bot with a jersey \n&gt; which read &quot;Ra=\r\nuq&quot;.  (Time to make Rauq look Stupid.)  Rauq starts \n&gt; Dribbiling the ball =\r\ndown court when he trips over his own feet.  The \n&gt; ball leaves his hands a=\r\nnd rolls into Gorzo hands.  Gorzo, who is \n&gt; standing behind the 3-point li=\r\nne and takes a jump shot.  The ball \n&gt; sails into the hoop as the Buzzers s=\r\nounds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Court Side Announcer:  HOLY RUST POCKET, THE GORRILAZ WIN 107-1=\r\n06.  \n&gt; THE GORRILAZ WIN!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;5 Years Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Bot that was =\r\nwearing the Gorzo jersey 5 years earlier was in a \n&gt; small 2 person shuttle=\r\n.  He is Flying around Earth.  All of a sudden \n&gt; the right wing catches on=\r\n fire and falls down towards Earth as the \n&gt; shuttle falls down with the wi=\r\nng.  The shuttle lands near Mid-Africa \n&gt; about 10 miles from where Dewboys=\r\n Characters are.\n\n\n"}}
