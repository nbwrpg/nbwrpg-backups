Puts a CD in the computer record this fight I\n&gt; need to gather all the data on the other fighter.&quot;  Tigerhawk Spins around\nin\n&gt; the command chair &quot;Heres the plan in 2 steps. &quot;Tigerhawk Pulls up layout\nof\n&gt; Zardus ship. &quot;odds are that the alliances holding cell are here a red\nlight\n&gt; goes off in the center of the ship.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Step.1 Autoguns and shields.\n&gt; &quot;Me and the Radicons can generate a high enough energy level to Draw off\nthe\n&gt; autoguns. While Archangel will break through the shields&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tigerhawk Tosses a weird shaped grenade to Archangel &quot;this Pure Water a\n&gt; device which a hole in the shield pure water is water with the\nelectrolytes\n&gt; removed so it cannot carry electricity and a shield energy is mostly\n&gt; electricity so it will give you some time to get in.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Step.2  Split into teams and search the ship.\n&gt; Get Iron and hall ass back here and get ready to defend against a counter\n&gt; attack. Hands all the people going a holocube\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This our chance to get the preds and alliance fighting each cube will\nmake\n&gt; us look like a pred of your choice. Tigerhawk turns on his cube and looks\n&gt; like hellbeast.\n&gt;\n&gt; Computer &quot;pred  alert pred alert autoguns online.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tigerhawk cut off the cube &quot;It will mask out energy signals.
