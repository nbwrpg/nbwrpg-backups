BLIGHT was known to be an expert in biowarefare and the\ntechnologies that make up transformers, but never as an object of\nworship . . how disgusting!\n\nAs for the stones themselves, the ones that are being thrown in the\nmouth of the statue, from what sensors indicate, they were giving off\nsome sort of radiation . It is difficult to tell what type of affect\nthe radiation is having on the humans since the ones that are handling\nthe stones are robed and covered in animal skins.\n\nOnce the stones enter into the mouth of the statue they quickly fell\ndown some sort of tube and  disappeared - presumably going underground\nsomewhere.\n\nAs WINDLORD and PERCEPTOR watched, the statue of BLIGHT darkened\nslightly and then the optics stopped glowing as the mouth shut.\n\nThe Proto humans fall silent for a moment and then stood and turned\naway as they began to walk back into the forest again.\n\nOne human stopped for a moment as if he sensed the MAXIMALS watching them.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
