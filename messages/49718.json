Enjoy!\n\nHall of the Khans\nStrana Mechty\nClan Space\n3063\n\nThe dark-haired man clad in wolf leather rose swiftly and hit the \nmarble desk hard with his fist at hearing the proposal.\n\n&quot;Are you mad, Khan Bjorn?&quot;\n\nThe rumor of the shout echoed in the auditorium. Bjorn Jorgensson \nlooked around him. Marthe Pryde of the Jade Falcons was also outraged, \nbut the grins of both Perigard Zalman and Asa Taney rpoved that he had \nmade a point.\n\nBjorn: Am I, Khan Vladimir? The battle fought and won by the Star \nAdders agaisnt Liao troops show that they have what it takes to take \non the Inner Sphere. With a little time, every Clan could learn how to \ndeal with our foe. After all, the Smoke Jaguars did not learn, and \nthey are a dead Clan today. That is why every Clan should have a \nholding in the Inner Sphere.\n\nVladimir Ward glared furiously at the Ghost Bear Khan. The reasons he \nstated were only pretexts to weaken the Wolves and the Jade Falcons by \nhaving their worlds taken by the home Clans. The move would strengthen \nthe Warden cause while creating a buffer for the base against attacks \nfrom the Draconis Combine. It was interesting enough for every Clan to \ntake the bait, even knowing it to be a trap.\nHe would not allow it.\n\nVladimir: Very well. Let us vote on the subject.\n\nAs Kael Pershaw, the wrinkled and battle-torn Jade Falcon Loremaster \npronounced the end of the vote, the result showed that only 4 of the \n28 Khans had voted agaisnt the proposal. They were the Wolves and Jade \nFalcons, as Bjorn had expected.\n\nVladimir: There Bjorn. You have your proposal. I hereby challenge the \ndecision cast by this vote.\n\nBjorn: Just as I thought. I propose a trial by single combat. After \nall, we need not start a war about this matter...\n\nThe reference to the refusal war that had pitted the Wolves and Jade \nFalcons agaisnt each other a few years ago provoked a mild chuckle in \nthe crowded Khans. Vlad simply let it pass.\n\nVlad: So be it. I shall stand for the opposants. Who will fight \nagainst me?\n\nBjorn let a smile creep up.\n\nBjorn: He is a man I trust with my life. He was once one of yours, \nKhan Ward. Since this will be a mech fight, he will go in my place. I \nhope he does not kill you... much...\n\n(To be continued...)\n\n\n"}}
