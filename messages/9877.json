The Pod outside of the\nbase opens. Time Bomb wanted to ask Megatron first, but he knew he couldn&#39;t\nlet it sit out there. He walked outside of the base and stared at the\ncreature. It was a spider, a large Trapdoor Spider.\n\n&quot;Halt! Which side are you aligned with?&quot; Time Bomb asked. The Spider\ntransformed to robot mode, he looked meaner than the meanest thing to crawl\nout of the pit.\n\n&quot;What sides are there?&quot; He asked.\n\n&quot;Well, we&#39;re the Predacons under Megatron&#39;s comand, and--&quot; Time Bomb was cut\noff.\n\n&quot;Good, I&#39;m a Pred.&quot; The Spider said. Time Bomb kept his cannon out.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s your name? And which Preds are you with?&quot; Time Bomb asked.\n\n&quot;Etchingar. And I&#39;m on Megatrangs side, too.&quot; The spider replied.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s Megatron, Megatron may get annoyed if you can&#39;t get his name right, he\nmay give you clean up for a job.&quot; Time Bomb said. Etchingar looked annoyed.\n\n&quot;Look, is it my fault your leader has a confusing name? Come on! I want to\njoin and get off of these stupid streets!&quot; Etchingar yelled.\n\n&quot;Megatron, a Pred from a pod out here wants to join, shall I let him? He has\nmade no challenges and just wants to join some team to get off of the\n&#39;Streets.&quot; Time Bomb said into his commlink tuned to Megatron&#39;s frequency...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;JP3884@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 02, 2000 10:45 PM\nSubject: Re: DrillBit back at base\n\n\n&gt;     Black Aracnia watched Megatron flee. It didnt matter now. THe battle\nwas\n&gt; won, the ship saved, all thanks to her. As for the two intruders....they\n&gt; would be dead in minutes if not now. She watched Quickstrike scurry right\n&gt; into the corridor where Darkmouse was, which also was where the nerve gas\nwas\n&gt; being let loose. He would stumble right into it.
