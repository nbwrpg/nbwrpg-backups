But he knew he\n&gt; had to take his time and not jump to conclusions.  Attacking whoever was\n&gt; coming was not a good idea, but remaining alert was.  He tests the air with\n&gt; his nostrils and listens carefully as to what is approaching him.  He shifts\n&gt; his weight and gets onto his four feet in preparation to move if he had to.\n&gt; Yet he wanted the approachers to know that he was no small creature.  He\n&gt; rumbles a  deep draconic growl just to give the approachers an idea what\n&gt; they were coming close to.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere are quiet voices, &quot;He&#39;s not dead.&quot; One voice said from one of\nthe figures approaching.\n\n&quot;I can hear plain as you.&quot; Said another.\n\nThere was a third voice, &quot;He is not out but he is injured. Spread out\nand we will take him from all sides.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sir.&quot; Came the answering replies.\n\nThree individuals began spreading out to surround TUSCON on three\nsides, TUSCON&#39;s keen senses helping him to keep track of their\nposition as they came around. Their size was difficult to make out\nwith all the brush and such between TUSCON and the ones trying to\nsurround him but they did seem to be on the large size, but not on the\norder of the dinobots, but then again how many were?\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
