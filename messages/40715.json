He will be unavailable \n&gt;for\n&gt; &gt; some time, he&#39;ll be attending some gladiator event or something. He was\n&gt; &gt; trying to get an arrangement with Zardus, leader of the Alliance and \n&gt;said he\n&gt; &gt; would recommend us to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; &gt; Haha! Old friend! You haven&#39;t changed at all! Always trying to prove you \n&gt;are\n&gt; &gt; the best! Well, for the Tripredacus and the Matrix, I widh you luck!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Melchana:\n&gt; &gt; Yeah, but maybe his mercenary act is going to get him killed... Too much\n&gt; &gt; enemies means you never miss some fun, but sooner or later, he will be \n&gt;done\n&gt; &gt; for good!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Gesper:\n&gt; &gt; So what do we do? Do we work for Zardus for some time?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps... (he thinks for a bit) Gesper, you will stay here to establish \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; perimeter defenses. Get the shield online and reconfigure the \n&gt;surrounding\n&gt; &gt; techno-organic vegetation so it can provide us with some defensive\n&gt; &gt; firepower. Melchana, connect the shield&#39;s absoring devices to the Shadow\n&gt; &gt; Destiny&#39;s generator. I&#39;ll be looking at the tactical emplacement of the \n&gt;base\n&gt; &gt; and bring modifications to the orders I gave if need be. Gesper, if \n&gt;Zardus\n&gt; &gt; sends a message, relay it to me in top priority. He is likely to be an \n&gt;ally\n&gt; &gt; to us in this war. If he wants our assistance, I will go along with\n&gt; &gt; Melchana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The two others acknowledge their orders, Melchana hoping that Zardus \n&gt;will\n&gt; &gt; call soon...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; T�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse\n&gt; &gt; http://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=====\n&gt;REPLY SOON          HARLEY PARRY FROM ST.THOMAS\n&gt;\n&gt;_______________________________________________________\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Get your free @... address at http://mail.yahoo.ca\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
