He saw Soundwave standing around. He contacted him.\n\n&quot;Soundwave, we need to get Zardus as happy as possible. If you help \nhim, he might come to listen. Help in the battle, but don&#39;t do so \nmuch as if to attract alot of attention, and only kill if someone is \nactually trying to kill you. Keep life alive at all costs! Vulois \nout.&quot;\n\nVulois went back to working on the embassy.\n\n\n"}}
