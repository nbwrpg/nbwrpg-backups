I have been trying to raise\n&gt; Lord Perseus but i&#39;m sure you can get in touch with him. Status report:\n&gt; Rodimus Prime and Remus both injured. Rodimus&#39; repairs are being taken care\n&gt; of in the CR chamber. Remus is being repaired in one as well but his\n&gt; problems could be caused by means other then just physical damage. Actally\n&gt; Rodimus Prime is now Hot Rod. The Minions succeded in their plans and\n&gt; stripped The Matrix of Leadership from Rodimus after he was defeated by\n&gt; Cyclonus in combat. Kup is currently watching over Hot Rod and Remus in the\n&gt; base med bay. Relay that to Perseus. Also tell him that we have a plan that\n&gt; I need to discuss with him.\n&gt;\n&gt;   ::Kup/Hot Rod::\n&gt;\n&gt;   Kup had started to nod off when one of the CR chambers chimed. It&#39;s\n&gt; process was finished. With a hiss the door on the chamber opened and Hot Rod\n&gt; stepped out.\n&gt;\n&gt;   The two old friends come face to face.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hot Rod: ..... I... I failed, Kup....\n&gt;\n&gt;   Kup: No you didn&#39;t, Roddy. You fought Cyclonus with everything you had.\n&gt; We&#39;ll get The Matrix back.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hot Rod: How? The Minions ae too strong. I couldn&#39;t beat one of Unicron&#39;s\n&gt; heralds with The Matrix. How am I supposed to do it without it?\n&gt;\n&gt;   Kup: We&#39;ll find a way. Elder has a plan. He and Windlord went to find Lord\n&gt; Perseus and discuss it. The plan is to....\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hot Rod: Later, Kup. Where are Nightlight and Elita?\n&gt;\n&gt;   Kup: Nightlight is showing Hevn around the city. He made a comeback while\n&gt; you were fighting Cyclonus. I&#39;m not sure about Elita.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hot Rod opens a comm channel to Nightlight.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hot Rod: Nightlight, this is Rodi... This is Hot Rod. Do you read me?\n&gt;\n&gt;   He was met with nothing but static.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hot Rod: Hmm... I wonder whats up with that.\n&gt;\n&gt;   He switches the channel to Elita.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hot Rod: Elita, this is your dad.
