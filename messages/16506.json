He put his arm around her and used the comm on \nhis other.\n\n&quot;Blaze, turn the cell guns on.(the cell guns flipped out of their \npanel.) Ignatius, come over here with some chains that tie around his \npuny little neck. Make them real tight. We&#39;ll walk him down to the \nmed lab. If he tries to transform, the tightness of the collar will \npop his head off.&quot;\n\nIgnatius came with the rope.\n\n&quot;Alright Ignatius, get in there. Blaze, if he makes an attempt at \nsomething fire the guns. We are all to use everything possible to \nkeep him at bay. Now let&#39;s go.&quot;\n\nIgnatius opened the cell and stepped forward.\n\n&quot;Easy wolfy. Once we wipe your memory, it&#39;ll al be over and you can \ngo home.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
