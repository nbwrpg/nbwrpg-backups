She let her logic circuits go and let her instincts \ntake over.  She turned and looke at Starscream. &quot;SO you want to take \non a mouse huh? This mouse bites back.&quot;  She fired her optic lazars \nat Starscream.  She then jumped up and started to climb over the \nfallen trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; (JP, You are forgetting Drillbit&#39;s attack on Inferno.)\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream saw the bot fall down twice, giving him time to catch up \na \n&gt; bit. The only problem was that he had to manuver through all of the \n&gt; trees. He was catching her though. Time to cut her off......\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream launcheed a missled into a tree a few metres infront of \n&gt; her into a tree, causing it to catch on fire and fall down, \nblocking \n&gt; her path. He continued the chase.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon was getting ready to attack the Ark, when he decided to \ncheck \n&gt; up on the three chips he had installed in three different bots. He \n&gt; went to the computer and checked their status.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first was Savage. Everything was fine. Prebon had complete \n&gt; controll over him.\n&gt; \n&gt; The second was Koj. The chip was giving off no signs of anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Damt it! He must have used those Ninja powers of his to defeat it. \n&gt; Well, it might be somewhere in the Maximal base, so it could still \nbe \n&gt; of some use. Chip 30175A, self destruct!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The chip exploded wherever Koj has put it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The thirs was Spears. He was waiting for this. He examined the \n&gt; readings. Most of the time it had complete contro, but than there \nare \n&gt; some blanks that could not be accounted for. The Maximal Chip. They \n&gt; have both intergrated themselves into her vital systems. Removing \n&gt; either one would result in immediate termination. When he got her \n&gt; back he would find a way to fix that though. She must be going \nnuts, \n&gt; not remembering stuff that well. Just than the message came in from \n&gt; Spears. Time to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Trainers! We are leaving early and going to Spears&#39; positio. I&#39;ve \n&gt; locked onto it. She wants to return to us. We must go rescue our \nlost \n&gt; comrade! And perhaps we could pick up a dead body and place the \nspark \n&gt; of Lightrade in it! We must go!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The other Trainers left the base and hopped on Savage with their \n&gt; cloaks on, ready to go. Prebon waited, signaling for Slayer to come.\n\n\n"}}
