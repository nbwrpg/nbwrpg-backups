She went and hid in a dark corner.\n\n&quot;Yes....soon all these Predacons will die.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream, on the ship, checks to make sure everyone is here.\n\n&quot;Phobia...Pseduo...Atma...Goldeneye....Dollen...Terrorsaur...Hey, has \nanyone seen KitKat?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois begins to run faster, as his hope fufills.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve al heard of Transmetal tchnology, and how Megatron \nmde it stronger into Transmetal 2. Well, when I was evil, I stumbled \nacross a TM3 driver, even stronger than TM2. Soundwave built the \nmachine to use it. I&#39;m a TM3 right now. That&#39;s why I have so many \ntactics. Battera is a TM3, and so was Soundwave. We were the only \nones ever to use the technology. I was caught trying to double-cross \nHell Beast, and he took it from me. So now I.....LOOK! We&#39;re here!!!&quot;\n\nVulois drops the equipment and looks around. A tear came to his eye. \nThis was the first place he ever met Soundwave, after calling him to \nhim. He sat down and cried, tears of joy and tears of Sadness.\n______________________________________________________________________\nSavage\n\nThe quills get stuck in Savage&#39;s hide, and Striker&#39;s shots make huge \ngashes in Savage&#39;s skin. He yells out a roar of agony, big enough to \nbe heard miles away. He looked at Striker and smelled. This bot had \nalot of him on him. This was the one he almost killed before. He sent \ntwo fireballs at each of them.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\n&quot;Well...kinda,&quot; saiid Brix, &quot;But never a planet as beautiful as this.&quot;\n\nThey continued towards the ship.\n\n\n"}}
