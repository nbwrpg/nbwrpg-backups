His wrist comp beeps a bit, reporting a bot near the door. He taps a \nfew keys to stop the autoguns from opening fire.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s a bot near the entrance,&quot; he says to Battera, &quot;Can you show her in, \nask her what she wants, and make sure she doesn&#39;t go loose in the base? I \nhave to attend to this bot.&quot;\n\nHe takes Squizzy from Dark One, walking off toward the lab.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Alliance base&#39;s autoguns recognize DevilDuer&#39;s DNA, but also recognize \nLady Hawk&#39;s. The doors stay closed, the autoguns aiming at Lady Hawk, ready \nto fire just in case.\n\n"}}
