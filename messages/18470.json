I thought you were at the CF. Just replace every CF wit \nthe word Ark in that post.)\n\nStarscream\n\nStarscream dropped his jaw at what KitKat said. Phobia dead? No way. \nIf Megatron did it, he would pay. Starscream remembered that he did \nnot fully trust Phobia, but he respected him for his pychological \nknowledge and thought of him as the only one of the group besides \nKitKat that was his peer. No time to mourn though. He had to go and \nhelp Drillbit fight Inferno.\n\nStarscream flew out of the base towards Drillbit.\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon smiled.\n\n&quot;Our chip has over-powered the Maximal programming. When she comes \nout of stasis, she will be ours again.&quot;\n\n&quot;But how do we get her out?&quot; Blaze asked.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s where you come in. We will all turn our cloaks off, and \ndistract the Maximals by drawing them outside for a battle. \nMeanwhile, you will still have your cloak on, and will enter the base \nthrough a large panel that is missing on the other side of the ship \nbecause of previous battles. When you find Spears, slap this cloak on \nher and run back to base. We&#39;ll keep the battle up until you are at \nthe base. Put Spears in a holding cell until I get there, and if she \nwakes tell her the Maximals did something evil to her and we must fix \nit. Everyone understand? Good. We begin in 10 cycles. Everyone load \nup!\n\n\n"}}
