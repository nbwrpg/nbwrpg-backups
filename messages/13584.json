From what he\n&gt; peiced together, this was a colonization post. It was put here to observe\nthe\n&gt; planets evolution, and then with the data they would begin to relocate on\nto\n&gt; the planet. As he read further he found out that when the original Beast\nWars\n&gt; took place, the Aliens began to observe the bots as a threat. They hadnt\n&gt; encountered any intelligent life before and this scared them. They knew\nthe\n&gt; Maximals were trying to stop Megatron from destroying the Autobots, but\nfelt\n&gt; both races needed to be exterminated.\n&gt;     The Aliens constructed a ship called the Armada. It was an automated\n&gt; warship that would activate when the Observation Bunker was destroyed. The\n&gt; Armada is a large vessle, loaded with warheads to eradicate all\nintelligent\n&gt; life. When the bunker was destroyed, it began its mission to destroy the\n&gt; transformers.\n&gt;     The Bunker was destroyed when the Carbon Dioxide filter shut down and\n&gt; allowed Oxygen to flood into the bunker, which the aliens could not\nbreath.\n&gt; From what the arachnid determined, they had been dead for a week, leaveing\n&gt; them with a few days to stop the vessle.\n&gt;     &quot;Aracnia! We have troble! These Aliens, it seems, figured out that we\n&gt; would get to them sooner or later. A warship is headed this way,\nprogrammed\n&gt; to eradicate any intelligent life. Our metal bodys and sparks will be dead\n&gt; give aways.&quot; Tarantulas said to Aracnia.\n&gt;     She turned to him. &quot;Damn it! When will it arrive?&quot; She yelled.\n&gt;     &quot;Four days, and then according to the data, it will begin an automated\n&gt; assult via warheads.&quot;\n&gt;     She paused for a moment. She knew only oner person who could aid them\nin\n&gt; a situation like this. &quot;Alright, get Megatron on the Comm, we need to\ntalk.\n&gt; Now!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
