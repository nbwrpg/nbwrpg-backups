Cyclonus\nwas n=\r\not an engineer, but he was originally trained as a saboteur,\nwhich means he=\r\n knew a lot about how things worked, even if it was\ngeared more for destruc=\r\ntion then repairs. He was never quite sure why\nUnicron had crafted him with=\r\n these skills, but there were times when\nthey did come in handy . . . like =\r\nnow.\n\nPointing back in the direction they had come, Cyclonus gestured at a\n=\r\nfew holes in the walls Scourge had created when he had attempted to\nhit Rat=\r\n Trap. &quot;Those are yours, make sure that the walls are seamless\nwhen you are=\r\n done.&quot;\n\nScourge nodded and walked towards the first hole grumbling under h=\r\nis\nbreath, &quot;Dirty Maximal scum, now I have to clean up after his filth\n... =\r\n&lt;grumble&gt; &lt;grumble&gt;&quot;\n\nCyclonus looked over at Scorponok, &quot;The torture chamb=\r\ner is yours. Seal\nup the hole that was made, and find out how he got in in =\r\nthe first\nplace.&quot;\n\n&quot;What?!?! You do not tell ME what to do!&quot; Scorponok&#39;s an=\r\nger blazed\nagainst Cyclonus.\n\nHowever rather than respond, Cyclonus just ca=\r\nlmly walked away, almost\nas if daring Skorponok to shoot him.\n\nScorponok&#39;s =\r\nguns trained on Cyclonus, but then he glanced over at\nHydras and then back =\r\nat the door to the torture chamber. Then with\nwalked inside the torture roo=\r\nm and slammed the door!\n\nCyclonus himself continued walking without breakin=\r\ng stride. Although\nhis back was to Skorponok, he had never taken his attent=\r\nion from the\nlarger Decepticon, until Skorponok enter the chamber and slamm=\r\ned the\ndoor.\n\nCyclonus continued towards the computer room where he would\ni=\r\nnvestigate what other damage, if any Rat trap had done to the\ninteriors of =\r\nthe base.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus/Scourge/Scorponok)\n\n"}}
