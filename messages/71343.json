He too, could sense something a miss.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re right Kup, something is disturbing about Windlord...  It seems that \nperhaps some Predacon programming may have remained there residually.. \nHopefully Stanton and Bump will be able to convince him to have another scan \ndone of his logic circuitry, just to be on the safe side.  No doubt that \nHydras has impacted us all, especially those who have been infected by that \nPredacon shell program.&quot;\n\nHe tightens his fist.\n\n&quot; That is why perhaps it&#39;s wise that I confront him one on one.  He has not \ninfected me but has struck at Rodimus, Windlord and Nightlight.  For their \nsaftey, I take the burden of dealing with Hydras personally.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot, Uproar, Quickstride, and Rat Trap nearly fall out of their \nseats with eyes wide with shock. Straight Shot is the first to speak up.\n\n&quot;ARE YOU NUTS?!  YOU CAN&#39;T DO THAT HE&#39;LL KILL YOU!&quot;\n\nQuickstride chimes in next.\n\n&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s like whoah, seriously not a very good decision sir..  Very \ngenerous but wow, that could really be messy.&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks to Tucson.\n\n&quot;Wheels, ya can&#39;t, ya just can&#39;t do that.  You got a great bunch of bots, \nlike ya said, please ya gotta accept help this time.&quot;\n\nTucson looks to everyone.\n\n&quot; I know you have all expressed concern over my actions, when it comes to \nHydras, and I fully understand why you are so concerned.  Hydras needs to be \nstopped, but I can not expect any of you to become vulnerable to his attack, \nwhen it is I who should be doing something about him personally.  Rodimus, I \nowe it to you to avenge what he has done to you, Nightlight and Windlord, \nsoley due to the fact that when you needed me years ago, I did not come \nthrough for you.  Now, I have to redeem myself for that costly mistake, and \namend the wrongs which have been set upon you.&quot;\n\nUproar looks to Tucson.\n\n&quot; But, that wasn&#39;t your fault.  I read up on it, you didn&#39;t do anything \nwrong, you were out there going above and beyond the call of duty and you \nwere unexpectedly hit from behind.  There was no way you could have avoided \nwhat happened to you.  Although, we don&#39;t know who did it do we?  That \nwasn&#39;t in the intel I read.  Guys, We can&#39;t let Tucson face Hydras all \nalone, it&#39;s way too dangerous.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to Leo Prime and everyone else.\n\n&quot;Leo Prime,everyone, I believe I know how ta fill in the gaps as to what \nhappened vorns ago.  I was with him during that battle.  He had finished \ndealing with some of the heavy hitting battlechargers, when he noticed that \nRodimus and the others were getting seriously pegged out in battle.  He \ncouldn&#39;t just sit there and watch it happen, and he knew that decoy detail \nwasn&#39;t best suited for his alt form which at the time, was more designed for \nutility and off road driving.  But he couldn&#39;t bare to see anyone suffer or \nbe oppressed so he did the unthinkable, and beyond his ability \nspecifications, he sped out there to catch the attentions of the Seekers, \nwho were concentrating on striking at the Autobot speedsters.  Well, Tucson \ngot their attention and began to draw them away from Rodimus and the others, \nbut then, un be known to him, way out in the distance, Cyclonus hid himself \nnicely among cloud cover, and decided to take a pop shot at Tucson.  Well, I \nsaw out of the rear view, Cyclonus in the distance, and then I saw the shot \ncoming toward us.  After that, Tucson and I were struck, but I was the only \none who saw the shot and the perpetrator.  Then, anything after the strike, \nI really don&#39;t remember.&quot;\n\nNight Shift now hobbles into the room slowly.\n\n&quot; I do.  I - was there too.  I could see Cyclonus headn&#39; toward &#39;em, but I \nwas so far off fightn&#39; some of the combaticons, I couldn&#39;t get there fast \nenough ta swing Tucson or Straight Shot outa the way.  I was miles behind \nthem  and no matter how loud I beeped my horn ta warn &#39;em, they couldn&#39;t \nhear me.  Then, yeah, I saw that slag ball hit my buddy, and there was an \nexplosion that went miles up in the sky.. I thought for sure he was a \ngonner..  I did my best ta get back up, and then got Tucson back ta base.. \nHe was off line for a long time, and when he woke up, he thought the power \nwent out..  Little did he know he was struck blind by Cyclonus, never ta see \nthe light of day again, or at least until he got a second opinion from a \nmedic.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot knew that Talon would also like to see Tucson get his sight \nback.  She smiles to Talon and puts a hand on hers.\n\n&quot; I think Talon said it best, when she said it was time we gave Tucson back \nhis eyes.  Leo Prime, before anything else, I think it&#39;s time you guys \nfought as a whole, and you really can&#39;t do that unless all of you can see \nthe road ahead of you.  So, if I may do so, I want to request that Tucson \nPrime undergoes a detailed examination and full repair of his visual \nimpairment.&quot;\n\nTucson looks to Straight Shot and Talon.\n\n&quot;They&#39;re right.  It&#39;s time I stopped procrastinating.  Stanton, Bump, I \nwould like to give you two the honor of undergoing this proceedure.  I&#39;ve \nseen your work, and I would be honored if you would perform the repairs.&quot;\n\nHe looks to everyone confidently.\n\n&quot; We will do this, we will overcome every obsticle they&#39;ve put in front of \nus.  But we must work as a team if we&#39;re to achieve success.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup looked in sadness how Windlord Stormed out the room and then he looked \n&gt; at Tucson said  â€œIt seems that Nighlight is in her old self...
