He pinned his ears and stoppped \nin his tracks. He looked around, puzzled where Zyber&#39;s voice had come from. \nThen he remembered what Quickstrike had told him about the comm-links that \nevery bot had.\n\nHe had never used his, since he lived on his own, not even knowing other \nbots existed. He wasn&#39;t sure how to respond to it. Quickstrike never told \nhim how. He kept his ears pinned, not sure what to do. Sher requested of her \nwelcome remain. He&#39;d allow if he knew how to respond to her.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
