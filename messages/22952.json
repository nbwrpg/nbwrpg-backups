This is an excellent \n&gt; stronghold. \n&gt; &gt; The engin room...if they want to keep any kind of power I suggest \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; surrender to us. But for now I want to talk to Killfest and \n&gt; Drillbit.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron said as he gazed into a monitor.\n&gt; &gt;        Paralysis brought up a visual comm and gave the go sign to \n&gt; Megatron. \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Killfest, you digusting a loathsome vermine, I dont know what \n&gt; youre trying \n&gt; &gt; to pull but If you dont get out of my ship, not only will I cut \nall \n&gt; power off \n&gt; &gt; to you and your men, including the inviormental controls, I will \n&gt; flood the \n&gt; &gt; bridge and corridors with the exhust from the Transwarp engins. \n&gt; True, \n&gt; &gt; transformers dont need to breath, but you know as well as I do \nthat \n&gt; it will \n&gt; &gt; strip your armor off in a matter of seconeds, leaving you a \n&gt; pathetic pile of \n&gt; &gt; scrap where your spark will fizzle out.&quot; He smiled even \nmore, &quot;And \n&gt; from here \n&gt; &gt; I also have access into the mainframe computer, so this whole \n&gt; lockdown thing \n&gt; &gt; isnt going to last for to long. I expect a message from you in no \n&gt; less than \n&gt; &gt; 30 minutes. If you dont respond I will flood this ship. Commander \n&gt; Megatron \n&gt; &gt; out.&quot; He said finally and turned off the visual link.\n&gt; &gt;        &quot;Very well done Megatron. Rampage, go and begin to churn \nthe \n&gt; exhust \n&gt; &gt; from the engines, I want to expell it at a moments notice. As for \n&gt; the rest of \n&gt; &gt; you, be wary, they will most likely try to get inside here, even \n&gt; though there \n&gt; &gt; is a lockdown.&quot; Hell Beast said making himslef comfortable.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Tarantulas sped through the corridors as fast as his \nvhicle \n&gt; mode would \n&gt; &gt; allow. The internal autoguns did fire apon him, but the shots \nthat \n&gt; did hit \n&gt; &gt; him did little to slow him down. The mech he was bleeding was a \n&gt; small wound \n&gt; &gt; that could actually be delt with manually.\n&gt; &gt;        Reaching his destination he transformed and ducked under \nthe \n&gt; &gt; crossfire. Taking out a lockpick he carefully inserted it into \nthe \n&gt; door tech \n&gt; &gt; lock and poped it open after a few minuted off password tag. He \n&gt; stepped \n&gt; &gt; inside and locked it agian behinde him. He walked over to the pod \n&gt; where the \n&gt; &gt; remains of Kitkat lay. The bitch was getting payback.\n&gt; &gt;        After ripping the wires from the pod, the ones responsable \n&gt; for keeping \n&gt; &gt; the cloning process going, he ripped open the lid, took the \n&gt; remains, and \n&gt; &gt; chucked them over his shoulder. He turned and left the lab, the \n&gt; doors open \n&gt; &gt; this time, and raced down that hallway, taking a hit in the \n&gt; shoulder that \n&gt; &gt; hindered him but a minute.\n&gt; &gt;        Apon reaching the engin room doors, rather large, thick \n&gt; doors, he saw \n&gt; &gt; Inferno waiting to let him in. He pushed through and the heavy \niron \n&gt; doors \n&gt; &gt; shut quickly, air tight. He saw his fellow commrads around him as \n&gt; he dumped \n&gt; &gt; her reamins on the floor.\n&gt; &gt;        &quot;Well done arachnid!&quot; Megatron said as he came closer. &quot;If \n&gt; they want \n&gt; &gt; her back, they will negotiate. Otherwise Were going to pump he \n&gt; preety little \n&gt; &gt; corpse with enough ammo to make her look like she went through \nthe \n&gt; exhaust \n&gt; &gt; process. Which, we might do anywas. Hahaha.&quot; He mused to himslef \nas \n&gt; he poked \n&gt; &gt; her with his tail cannon gun.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Black Aracnia looked to Quasar. They were only down the \nhall \n&gt; from the \n&gt; &gt; rebels. If they found her and her daughter, you could bet she \nwould \n&gt; live very \n&gt; &gt; much longer.\n&gt; &gt;        &quot;Quasar, transform into beast mode and go into the \nhallwasy. \n&gt; I want \n&gt; &gt; you to run as fast as you can to the engin room. Thats the only \n&gt; room as \n&gt; &gt; important as the bridge and I can bet Megatron is holding up \nthere. \n&gt; Take \n&gt; &gt; these directions if you get lost. Im going to find Quickstrike.&quot; \n&gt; She said, \n&gt; &gt; her eyes beginning to fill with tears from the worry she was \n&gt; under. &quot;Just \n&gt; &gt; promise me you wont stop for anything, because if you do youre as \n&gt; good as \n&gt; &gt; dead.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        The Predacons, under Megatron, were armed, and had been \n&gt; waiting to \n&gt; &gt; fight for a long while. Kitkats plan to attack the Allience had \n&gt; taken to \n&gt; &gt; long, thus the high tension they were having now. Once these \nrebel \n&gt; Predacons \n&gt; &gt; were delt with Megatron planned on making a few alliences of his \n&gt; own. But for \n&gt; &gt; now, Killfest, Drillbit, and that little bitch Darkmouse were the \n&gt; top targets \n&gt; &gt; on his agenda.\n\n\n"}}
