Scanning the surface, he identified a mass energy \nsignature, the Ark.  Already passing the ozone layer, he was visible from the \nground now, barely.  All that could be seen without zoomed vision was a \nbright, small dot in the sky.  Checking his scanners, Shockwave was 5000 \nmiles and closing quickly on the Ark.  4600.  3980.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName: Shockwave\nGender: Male\nAlternate Modes: Ray Gun, space fighter\nSide: None (OTHER, NOT NEUTRAL)\n\nCharacter History:\n\nAlmost completely based on his namesake, Shockwave the leader of the \nDecepticon Empire in G1 Megatron&#39;s absence while on Earth, he was created in \ntwo hundred years ago.  Made by the Tripredacus Council in hopes of a new \ngeneral, their plan backfired, Shockwave despising them for not being \nDecepticon, which technically he was.  Totally obliterating  the war factory \nwhere he was forged, he declared an all out war on the Tripredacus Council, \nin turn unintentionally helping the Maximal Elders in their own agendas.  \nAdding a second mode, a space fighter, to his transformation capabilities, \nShockwave escaped, the Tripredacus Council and Maximal Elders in a joint \nmission were trying to kill him.  Reaching past Earth, a place where most \nfeared to tread, he decided to make his conquests there.  Not joining any of \nthe factions, he found them all to be pathetic and irrelevant.\n\nCharacter Personality:\n\nCold and brutal, he likes to take a scientific approach to war most of the \ntime, though sometimes he will go on murderous instincts.  Is sometimes \nconfounded by emotional and rash thinking.\n\nCharacter Stats:\n\n&quot;Clarity of thought before rashness of action.&quot;\n\nFunction: Ground Descruction and Air/Space Support\n\nStrength: 9.5\nIntelligence: 10\nSpeed: 7\nEndurance: 7\nRank: 9\nCourage: 9\nFirepower: 9\nSkill: 10\n\nAlternate Mode Descriptions:\n\nSpace Fighter:\n\nPurple and blue, the cone has a spike extending from the point.  Maximum \nspeed is Mach 5 and the Max range is 800,000 miles in a planet&#39;s atmosphere, \nMach 10 in space with a range of 2 million miles.  With a variety of \nmissiles, he also has laser weaponry, which makes his arsenal deadly.\n\nRay Gun:\n\nCan fire deadly laser blasts, gamma rays, light, infra-red, radio waves, and \nx-rays.  Along with many more.  Has flight capabilties in the purple ray gun \nmode.\n\nRobot Mode Description:  \n\nAlmost completely purple, his single yellow optic in the middle of his head \ngives him a wide variety of visions (check all vision capabilities in ray gun \ndescription).  With a laser weapon that extends instead of a hand on his \nright hand joint, it can be a hand or laser weapon.  In subspace he possesses \nenergon, a repairing unit, a missile launcher, charges, and a laser rifle.  A \nlarge purple Decepticon symbol rests on his chest.\n\n"}}
