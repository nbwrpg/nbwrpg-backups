They saw them go into the CR chamber room, and waited.  They could see \nflames.  Luckily the fire prevention systems when in, quickly putting the \nflames out with flame retardent foam.  They then saw the Predacons stand near \nthe entrance to the bridge.\n\nBeachcomber activated his com on a secure channel to the bridge&#39;s com system. \n &quot;This is Beachcomber,&quot; he whispered, &quot;there are three Predacons outside of \nthe bridge, be careful.&quot; he said, raising his laser rifle, he charged \nforward, firing three laser bolts off at Rampage&#39;s back.\n\nRamhorn fired 23 sonic shells off at Rampage&#39;s back.\n\n---\n\nScattershot landed on his knees, bending over a few feet from DeathStorm&#39;s \nhead. \n&quot;My...my power!  It&#39;s slipping away!  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!&quot; he screamed, \nraising his fists into the air, slamming them on the ground, still screaming \n&quot;No!&quot;.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor watched Scattershot, chuckling, firing a blast from his plasma \nlauncher, sending Scattershot forward, slamming to the ground unconsciouss \nafter catching the blast in the middle of his back.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer swooped, a foot going forward, sending Serpentor slamming \ninto a tree.\n\n---\n\nThe Oblitercons slowly approached the Ark, Dark One looking to his men.\n&quot;Predacons just got into the Ark.  Scavenger, Breakdown, and Pyro, take them \ndown.  Hiss and I, will take down the Newcomers.\n\nThey all nodded, the three named before heading for the hole in the hull of \nthe Ark.\n\nHiss transformed into his laser gun mode, Dark One catching him.  Taking aim, \nhe fired a single laser burst, blowing apart the plasma rifle in Anubis&#39; \nhands, the Newcomer stumbling backwards.\n\n===\n\nAmobeous scans detected an increase in energy signatures.\n\n&quot;Alright...Bacterium, we&#39;re in a base.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the same base or \nnot.  Either way, we may be able to get in good with the other Maximals if we \ngive them this information.  I&#39;ve heard tales that the Maximals who stay to \nlong on this planet become uncivilized war mongers.  If that&#39;s true, \nhopefully this information will help.  Doubtful, but maybe not.  When I say \nwhen, transform to robot mode.  Be sure to have weapons ready.  We want to be \nable to get out quick if we are trapped.&quot;\n\n"}}
