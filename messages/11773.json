I feel awful. My\n&gt; &gt; stomach is weird, I have a huge migrain and I&#39;m always dizzy. I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; findig it hard to think even as I right. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s my day off\n&gt; &gt; from work. I onyl wenty on now because if I didn&#39;t I would be so\n&gt; far\n&gt; &gt; behind. I still had a hundred messages to read. I&#39;m going to go lay\n&gt; &gt; down. Alloran, I&#39;ll give you and your men the tour tomorrow. I&#39;m\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; gonna do a quick thing on Fliq and Bronco.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now that they have Fliq&#39;s permission, they headed straight for The\n&gt; &gt; Ark&#39;s scanning systems.
