She watched the form \nchange and take on new atribute, new ones that she had never konwn of \nbefore. She go up and stood next to the table.  She looked at saw \nVeratis. She spoke, but her voice was scratchy and rough.&quot;What have \nyou done? Why is this happeneing? Why not give me my old form back? \nWhere is Lunarpine?&quot; She searched his mind, hoping too find the \nanswers.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis tried not to think, Shadow Wing could obviously sense every \nthought.\n&gt; he released the hold on the DNA scanner, it wasn&#39;t doing anything \nmore than\n&gt; slow her growth. scans showed that somehow her Spark had \nreconfigured her\n&gt; form to an owl. and the body had selected the form from the DNA \nhe&#39;d given\n&gt; it. she wasn&#39;t turning into a fuzor, she was becoming something new.\n\n\n\n"}}
