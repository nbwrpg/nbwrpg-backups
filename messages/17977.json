He was a \nPredacon? And than he wanted peace? He was gifted by the Matrix? This \nwas all too much. And Battera had a point. No peace would come untill \nthe Alliance won the war. And he had to help them. He didn&#39;t realize \nthat this was the programming talking. Deep within Vulois, his \noriginal programming fought the chains, and seemed to be succeding, \nbut this reassurane Battera put in about the Alliance drove it back \nand his current programming stayed in control. He looked up at them, \namazed.\n\n&quot;Thank You for telling me the truth. And you sharkbot. What is your \nname? I&#39;m sure I knew once upon a time, but I can&#39;t recall now.&quot; Than \none of the things Battera had said clicked in him. &quot;Cybertron? Did \nyou say Cybertron? I wanted to go back to Cybertron. That means....if \nthe old me was going back, than there must be a way I discovered. It \nmust be buried within my Alliance Programming! We could all go home!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
