She was accepted on the team that she was \non, and she wasn&#39;t going to betray. It was KitKat&#39;s old team. She \nwanted to honor her old friend&#39;s memory.\n\n&quot;DrillBit,&quot; she says into the comm, sending the transmission to \nDrillBit, &quot;Some bots just contacted me. They say they want me to join \nthem because I have energon blood. Can you please take care of them?&quot;\n\nShe enters the mess hall and sits down at a table, sighing and \nrelaxing in her seat.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Ominous Prime looked across the vastness of the Greek isles. \nIt had to \n&gt; admit it was a beautiful place, one that would serve as an \nimportant location \n&gt; in the future. The volcano, containing Darkfates base, loomed in \nthe distance.\n&gt;        &quot;Shes in there. We will have her. You failed the first time, \nfail \n&gt; agian and I shall make you suffer.&quot; Ominous said coldly to his \ntroops behinde \n&gt; him. The new addition of Quasar was with them. She had finally been \nbroken, \n&gt; just as Darkmouse would be.\n&gt;        &quot;Commander we will not fail. Lets send a transmission. I \ndoubt we \n&gt; could enter there base anyways.&quot; Putnam suggested, handing a Comm \nunit to \n&gt; Ominous.\n&gt;        He took it, held it to his mouth and said, &quot;Darkmouse, \nenergon flows \n&gt; through your veins. You belong with the Energonians. Join us, our \nsuperior \n&gt; race, and relish in the glory of victory that will be ours!&quot; He \npaused, face \n&gt; darkened. &quot;If you do decline this offer, however, we will have to \ntake you by \n&gt; force. And I do promise you that we will not fail agian.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
