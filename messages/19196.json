It was perfect down to the \nlast detail. Even the perfect skin color.  It stood before her in \nbeast mode.  She hooked up a few wired to his head and started in on \nthe program that would let her control the clone.  She smiled broadly.\n&quot;Yeah, a few more minutes, and he&#39;s ready.&quot;  She had on a small head \nset that would allow her to give the commands to the clone. She also \nprogrammed it to take only her voice commands.  She added a few extra \nprograms that would allow her to control the clone with out the \nheadset if they were in close proximity.  But for the most part, it \nwould have to be controlled through the head set.  She worked \nfeverously to get this finished. She was grinning with self pride at \nher accomplishmetn.  She culdn&#39;t wait to face her clone off with the \nreal Megatron.  She would give her right arm again to see Megatron&#39;s \nface when he saw his own clone.\n\n\n"}}
