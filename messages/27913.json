He felt the urge to laugh at what he considered \nan utterly pathetic attempt to defeat the greatest being in the Universe, \nnext to Unicron.\n\nHe let go of his sword, it disappearing into subspace.  The right hand that \nwas holding it flashed and changed into the shape of a small dagger, a \nglowing energon dagger.  He stabbed the blade that was his hand at the left \nside of Hot Rod&#39;s abs.  At the same time he had changed his left arm into the \nshape of a cannon and less than a second after he had moved his right arm to \nstab at Hot Rod he had the left arm head for the ex-Autobot&#39;s right abs.\n\n"}}
