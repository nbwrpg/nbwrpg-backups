Yes, they ha=\r\nve seen him before. To them he is a guardian, and the more offerings they g=\r\nave him, he would return their kind gestures by offering his protection. Bu=\r\nt there is more to these paintings.. A strange mysterious figure, with an a=\r\nura around it.. To me it seems evil. Another idol, someone else to worship.=\r\n .. People portrayed in black and white.. White, meaning those who look to =\r\nthe Silver Dragon and black to those who worship the intimidating idol.. I&#39;=\r\nve seen ancient pictographs before on Cybertron, and these are different bu=\r\nt in the same format. Talon if the dragon is a physical being, then this da=\r\nrk idol must be as well.

It=\r\n was another dragon. Yet this one was a bit smaller than he was, but the sa=\r\nme coloration. He takes note of its slender shape. It was female. She looks=\r\n to him as he looks to her.

T=\r\nhen, a third change, due to extensive damage to my previous form, which cou=\r\nld not be repaired, I was guided to my final evolution, this one.

Tucson looks to the offe=\r\nring. It was a most generous portion of fish. Yet now he could not eat it, =\r\nbut he knew Talon would need nourishment. He nods gently to the Protohuman =\r\nand accepts his offering with a gentile touch of his nose on the man&#39;s shou=\r\nlder. He allows him to stroke his snout as some sort of good luck ritual. T=\r\nhe man bows in graciousness to Tucson&#39;s gesture of kindness and leaves him =\r\nbe with Talon.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m not so sure what all of that meant but, whatever i=\r\nt was, it was a very kind gesture on his part.

Yes,=\r\n they have seen him before. To them he is a guardian, and the more offering=\r\ns they gave him, he would return their kind gestures by offering his protec=\r\ntion. But there is more to these paintings.. A strange mysterious figure, w=\r\nith an aura around it.. To me it seems evil. Another idol, someone else to =\r\nworship. .. People portrayed in black and white.. White, meaning those who =\r\nlook to the Silver Dragon and black to those who worship the intimidating i=\r\ndol.. I&#39;ve seen ancient pictographs before on Cybertron, and these are diff=\r\nerent but in the same format. Talon if the dragon is a physical being, then=\r\n this dark idol must be as well.

It was a massive guilt slammed upon his=\r\n heart. Yet how could he get the animals to understand that he had to leave=\r\n them in such a short time?

He watches attentively and at that moment, the creatur=\r\ne lifts its head. It was another dragon. Yet this one was a bit smaller tha=\r\nn he was, but the same coloration. He takes note of its slender shape. It w=\r\nas female. She looks to him as he looks to her. She slowly approaches him a=\r\nnd they look gently to each other like brother and sister. In draconic voca=\r\nlization, Tucson explains who he is and his dilemma. She intern rumbles bac=\r\nk and bows her head. She nods as he does.
