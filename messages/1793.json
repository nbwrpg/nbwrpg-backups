It was down right STUPID! Or so she thought, she had been alone for so long that perhaps she had lost her taste for strange company.\nShe almost seemed to feel crowded with just Rowdy Wolf and Striker there, but she couldn&#39;t just leave. She knew that if a battle did break out then she would be left to pick up the pieces, even if it meant picking up the pieces of a damaged bot.\nZyber shook her head as she came across a small stream, she bent down and began to wash the bowl with a sigh.\nIt seemed that sometimes life just wasn&#39;t fair to some.\nHer snow white fur fluttered about her face as a slight wind came up, so unfair.*\n\n____________________________________________\n\n* Iron Raptor had caught that Prowl had gotten the meaning of her look, but she also caught something else when his eyes met hers.\nShe shrugged, or maybe it was her imagination?\nWhatever cause, it could wait. It was not time to get out of there so that they didn&#39;t end up fighting for their lives just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nIron Raptor nodded and turned ever so carefully to follow Prowl away from the battle, there was just some fights that a bot had to stay out of. This was one of them!\nShe came up beside of Prowl, the trees around them were close together and barely wide enough for one bot to pass in between.\nIron Raptor swerved to avoid smacking into an upcoming tree and brushed against Prowl&#39;s shoulder, she passed the tree and continued on.*\n\n&quot; Sorry.&quot;\n\n* She whispered for the accidental brush, expecting Prowl to say something about it before her that meant his dislike.\nIron Raptor looked about the forest, it was quite dank and dark...not too different from the forests back on her home planet, Sirose.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
