Most of the lasers hit him in\nthe back, denting the armor covering his jetpack. He looks back only\nto be hit by more shots, these ones coming from Autofire.\n\nZardus growls, accelerating and firing his energy draining missile\nlauncher twice at Unitron, then firing a normal missile from his gun\nat Autofire. Out of the corner of his eyes, he sees Predacons arrive\nand begin to attack the NDE.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAutofire rolls out of the way of the missiles, turning around for\nanother pass at Zardus.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (IR, Double Punch is cloaked, so unless you used some special\nscanner it \n&gt; would be impossible to target/see him.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The Protectobots/The Oblitercons/Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark\nClaw/Nemesis\n&gt;\nEnforcer/Scattershot/Imprisoner/Predator/Choran/Shockwave/Unitron/Firestarter/\n&gt; Double Punch/Manterror/Injector/Vehement/Sun\nCrusher/Reflector/Smokescreen:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf watched the massive team up on Dark One and turned his\nhead, \n&gt; firing off five rapid optic blasts at the Cybertronian Fire,\nignoring autogun \n&gt; fire striking his form.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper felt forty shells bounce off of his chest, the force of\nthe \n&gt; numerous rounds knocking him back a few feet.  He looked down to his\nchest, \n&gt; which was covered with small dents.  &quot;You&#39;ll pay for that!&quot; he\nyelled, \n&gt; getting ready to charge, but saw two missiles heading for the\nOblitercon who \n&gt; had opened fire on him and he jumped to avoid the resulting\nexplosion.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw felt small explosions on his frame, the grenades doing\nlittle \n&gt; damage.  He armed his launchers, firing two missiles at Breakdown\nand two \n&gt; missiles at the Cybertronian Fire, autogun fire striking already\ndamaged \n&gt; areas all over his frame.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Slowly getting up, Dark One barely jumped out of the way of the ion\ndisks, \n&gt; landing on his right side hard.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Breakdown let out a yell as missiles struck him in the back, nearly\nsending \n&gt; him flipping forward.  Turning around, mech-fluid leaking down his\nback, he \n&gt; raised his greande launcher, but realized Injector was to far away. \nSo he \n&gt; fired three optic blasts at his opponent.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Pyro slowed down, no one pursuing him.  He raised his cannon, firing\noff \n&gt; three fireballs at Vehement.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hiss remained silent, still hurting badly.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scavenger was struck by a missile, sending him flipping through the\nair, the \n&gt; inside of vehicle mode badly burnt and smashed up.  Scavenger&#39;s\nscanners \n&gt; could make out Hiss going through the air quickly in the opposite\ndireciton.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Spot saw the five images of Headstrong and fired two fireballs,\none at \n&gt; two different of them, and jumped out of the way of one of the light\nblasts, \n&gt; the other burning a large hole in his chest that leaked mech-fluid.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Groove got up slowly, firing two photon blasts at Sinnertwin&#39;s\ntorso.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Blades felt weapons fire blowing into his armor, knocking him back\nthrough \n&gt; the air against his engines.  The apache whined as it turned, arming \n&gt; missiles.  Two missiles launched out at Shockwave.  &quot;You&#39;re Emperor\nof \n&gt; nothing!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; First Aid slowly got up, looking at the Autobot who had saved him. \n&quot;Thanks.  \n&gt; Who are you?&quot; he asked, a little flummoxed.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Streetwise ran forward, raising his pistol and firing off three\nphoton blasts \n&gt; at Reflector&#39;s sternum.  &quot;Take that you Decepticreep wanna be!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Imprisoner activated the laser cannon attached to his frame, the\nlarge cannon \n&gt; firing off three powerful laser blasts at the CF were heading\nstraight for \n&gt; the damaged ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Predator dodged some autogun fire from the Element.  &quot;You&#39;ll have to\ndo \n&gt; better than that.&quot; he chuckled, raising the rocket launcher on his\nshoulder \n&gt; and firing off a missile straight at the CF.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Choran had finished with his modifications and took aim.  He held\nthe trigger \n&gt; down for a few seconds, twenty-two laser bolts blasting out at\nProwl&#39;s torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer raised his rifle, firing off twenty-five rapid\nlaser bolts \n&gt; at one of Headstrong&#39;s hollow images.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot took aim, firing off ten armor-piercing rounds at\nDivebomb. (If \n&gt; he&#39;s still at the battle).\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave spinned in the air, the two missiles from Blades passing\nby \n&gt; harmlessly and exploding.  Shockwave got a lock and fired off ten\nrapid laser \n&gt; blasts at Blades.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am a Decepticon Emperor you moronic Autobot.  Your resistance\nwill only \n&gt; drain resources.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Two flares launched on at the last minute on an intercept course\nwith the \n&gt; incoming missiles, the explosions burning Unitron&#39;s frame slight. \nArming his \n&gt; missiles once more he fired off two missiles at the Cybertronian\nFire, ten \n&gt; rapid laser blasts lancing out from his nosecone at Zardus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Prepare to die, traitor.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Firestarter barrel rolled, avoiding three charges, the other blowing\na gash \n&gt; into his armored space fighter form.  Those were hits he couldn&#39;t\ntake.  \n&gt; Arming his missile launchers he fired off two energy-signature\nseeking \n&gt; missiles at Zardus from his left launcher and fired off twenty-three\nrapid \n&gt; laser blasts at the Cybertronian Fire from his nosecone.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Puny Maximals, you are more pathetic than your anscestors, the\nAutobots.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Beeline the lifeless cyber-bee fired two optic blasts on an\nintercept course \n&gt; with the charges heading for Double Punch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch looked at the explosions in the air and laughed,\nraising both \n&gt; pinchers and launching a total of two missiles at the Cybertronian\nFire from \n&gt; his left pincher.\n&gt; \n&gt; He broke into a run, getting a target lock and firing two\nenergy-signature \n&gt; seeking missiles at Cliffjumper.\n&gt; \n&gt; (By the way, DP is cloaked)\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror pulled hard left through the air, barely avoiding the\ncharges from \n&gt; the CF and the explosion of the charges sent a light coating of fire\nover his \n&gt; green body, dimming it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;ARGH!  NOTHING CAN DEFEAT THE MANTERROR!&quot; he screamed, raising both\narms and \n&gt; firing off four ion disks at the Cybertronian Fire, two from both\narms.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector raised his right arm, two stinger missiles heading for the \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire.  Almost seemingly out of nowhere, optic blasts\nstruck \n&gt; Injector, knocking him back through the air.  Though only a few\nseconds later \n&gt; Injector was stabalized.  &quot;Who dares attack me?&quot; he said, focusing\non \n&gt; Breakdown.  &quot;Ah, the mercenary.  A gun for hire is no match for\nInjector of \n&gt; the Neo Decepticon Empire!&quot; he yelled, heading downward at top speed\nfor \n&gt; Breakdown, the air resistance (that Yan was WRONG about) put pain on\nthe \n&gt; wound in his sternum that was leaking a tiny bit of oil from exposed \n&gt; circuitry.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised his left arm, firing two stinger missiles down at the\nOblitercon \n&gt; Breakdown.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Smokescreen exited the Cybertronian Fire, looking to Vehement\nimmediately.  \n&gt; He raised his heavy-laser rifle, charging the Brotherhood member who\nas \n&gt; rather far away.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What I failed to do shall be righted, in Primus&#39; name I swear.&quot; he\nsaid, \n&gt; while raising his rifle and taking aim at Vehement.  He cocked his\nrifle, the \n&gt; only thing he was waiting for was to be in range to open fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement didn&#39;t notice Smokescreen.  Fire balls from the pyromaniac\nPyro had \n&gt; struck Vehement almost harmlessly, the charred armor invisible since\nthe \n&gt; normal color of his armor was a deep black.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You make your greatest mistake, Alliance trash.&quot; he said loud\nenough for \n&gt; Pyro to hear.  He raised his right arm, a barrel at the end of it. \nTwo \n&gt; energy-signature seeking missiles launched out at Pyro.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher saw six shapes heading for him.  Raising his left arm he\nlaunched \n&gt; a single missile that he had explode prematurely.  Two charges were\nstill \n&gt; inbound and Sun Crusher only now attempted to move out of the way,\none charge \n&gt; blowing up against his left abs, creating a dent in his side that\nwas rather \n&gt; painful.\n&gt; \n&gt; But due to his training with the Brotherhood, he was able to hide\nhis pain \n&gt; from others.  And pain he was in, though it was starting to\nsubside.  \n&gt; &quot;Prepare for death!&quot; he yelled, raising his right arm and firing off\ntwo \n&gt; missiles at the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector looked didn&#39;t know who Streetwise was talking to or that\nhe had \n&gt; shot at him, but the Brotherhood member knew he had indeed been shot\nat when \n&gt; two photon blasts struck him in the chest, sending him backwards two\nand a \n&gt; half feet, the robot quickly regaining stabalization in the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Heathens.  You think you can stop those in the righteous path? \nWhen the \n&gt; Chaos-Bringer comes you shall feel the wrath of the righteous one\nand his \n&gt; followers.&quot; He raised both arms, launching two missiles from both\nbarrels on \n&gt; each arm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Four missiles launched from his left arm at the Cybertronian Fire. \nThe other \n&gt; arm sent two missiles at the Cybertronian Fire and two\nenergy-signature \n&gt; seeking missiles at an idle robot.  First Aid.\n\n\n"}}
