Like the rules\n&gt;say, unless you get Zardus&#39; permission for that silly story, the Alliance\n&gt;never did anything to Mustex, Stallex, Rhesus or the Carnitrons.  Oh, and \n&gt;if\n&gt;you really want to write stuff that&#39;s actually worth reading(And no, I\n&gt;didn&#39;t enjoy your silly little story) then you can always look for some\n&gt;advice from Jeff, sometimes me, KSL and a few others most likely.  You&#39;ll\n&gt;need to gain a more complex vocabulary and more understanding of things.\n&gt;Ok, everything I just said probably sounds really weird right now, but jume\n&gt;it.  Speak up if you really wanna **** with the Abyssian Badass!  And,\n&gt;everybody, since there&#39;s a lot of OOCing going on, I suggest you be like me\n&gt;and learn to balance OOCing and ICing by putting them both into one post.\n&gt;*Speeds off on his Harley* =)\n&gt;\n&gt;BIC:   Decadel continued to roam the halls and corridors of Maximal City.\n&gt;\n&gt;           &quot;Errr...must find.....somebody to enslave....soon!&quot; Decadel said\n&gt;to himself.\n&gt;\n&gt;           Decadel walked on, pondering who he should enslave.\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
