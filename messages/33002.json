He was back in the Sulaco. How he\ngot there, or what had happened every since he had left, he didn&#39;t\nremember. Getting up, he sees Magmatron.\n\n&quot;What happened?&quot; he asks, rubbing his head.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., t882hcc91@y... wrote:\n&gt; Magmatron:\n&gt; \n&gt;      The same opening that had allow Magmatron to leave this galaxy \n&gt; also allowed him to return. He was back in the Sulaco, it looked the \n&gt; same as when he left it. Only dustier. Magmatron also had a new body. \n&gt; The great head of the black TM2 allosaurus poked it&#39;s way through the \n&gt; portal. Then the rest stepped through. He transformed to his new \n&gt; robot mode, he looked somewhat like a cross between TM2 Megatron (the \n&gt; allosaur tail on the back of the head) and Tigerhawk (allosaur head \n&gt; on his shoulder)\n&gt;      &quot;SLAG!!&quot; He roared. He typed in a few button and the autoguns \n&gt; came online, breaking away all the rock that had once surrounded the \n&gt; Sulaco. The rock flew from the ship with a huge force. &quot;Apocalypse, \n&gt; get to the Sulaco, now. I have war to discuss with you.&quot;\n&gt;      Magmatron paid no heed as Cerberus crawled behind him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cerberus:\n&gt; \n&gt;      In his new Techno-organic body he was capable of cloaking, a \n&gt; technology he had copied from Dachande. He crept quickly by \n&gt; Magmatron, the &quot;leader&quot; not even knowing. He got out of the base and \n&gt; headed towards a cave, decloaking as he did.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dachande:\n&gt; \n&gt;      A transdimensional rift opened and Dachande was thrown out of \n&gt; it. He slammed into the ground hard. He had gotten rid of his cursed \n&gt; beast mode, and the only true way for Magmatron to command him. Now \n&gt; all Dachande wanted to do was find Battera and eliminate Magmatron \n&gt; once and for all.\n\n\n"}}
