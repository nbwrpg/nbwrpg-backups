Gave us lotsa scrap metal t&#39; use in the \nfuture.&quot;\n\nThey reach the CR chambers at the same time that Bloodystrike enters. \nBloodystrike walks to the CR chambers, putting Life in one and \nReptilica in the other. DevilDuer motions to the remaining CR.\n\n&quot;That one&#39;s for ya to use,&quot; he says, &quot;Ya&#39;ll be out in no time, then\nwe \ncan get ya registered as an Alliance member an&#39; all.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Diamond::\n&gt; She smiled, rather pleased with herself thus far.&quot;Well, as I had \n&gt; said, I came all the way from Cybertron.  I was under the command\nof \n&gt; the High Predacon Council.  I was desined and created as an \nassassin. \n&gt; I killed many high Maximal officials. but the one that got me\nalmost \n&gt; killed was the assassination of Quantis.  I killed him and then my \n&gt; leaders turned me into the maximal authorities.  I was to be tried \n&gt; and killed. But I escaped.  The last thing I remember was my ship \n&gt; getting sucked into a black hole. After that, I remember nothing \n&gt; untill I woke up in your arms.&quot;  she smiled at him, &quot;Which I aim to \n&gt; thank you properly for later on.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; She tried her best to help all three of them to the lab.  She got \nthe \n&gt; last three chambers ready. &quot;OK all, just step in and in no time \nflat, \n&gt; you&#39;ll be as good as new.&quot;  she said in a cheerful voice.  She \n&gt; wondered how she went from protoform and DNA engineer to hospital \n\n\n"}}
