This wasn&#39;t a normal \npredacon. No predacon would ask for another&#39;s trust.  A normal \nPredacon would tell her to shut up or die, or outright shoot her. No, \nthis bot was something else.  She just didn&#39;t know what.  She stood \nby him, not making a sound. She carefully put her hand on his \nshoulder and listened for the maximal reply.  She looked down, closed \nher eyes and smiled.  She couldn&#39;t help but like him.  Maybe her \ncomeback from the matrix had changed her in some small way, she \nthought.  Or maybe she needed her logic circuits checked, but she \nfound herself wanting to believe him. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Destructor didn&#39;t look back..&quot;Do not be afraid.
