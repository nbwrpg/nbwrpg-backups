Combining replies for everyone.\n\nBIC:\n\nTu=\r\ncson gives Talon a thoughtful smile and gently holds her hand for a few ten=\r\nder moments.\n\n&quot; The most important thing Talon, is your saftey.  If all els=\r\ne fails, whatever happens, if we lose this battle or if we win it, what mat=\r\nters most to me, is your saftey, and the saftey of all others.&quot;\n\nHe turns h=\r\nis head in Rodimus&#39;s direction.\n\n&quot; I almost forgot about who would look aft=\r\ner the Ark, very good point Rodimus.  Quickstride, I&#39;d like you to remain b=\r\nehind with Rodimus as backup.  He&#39;ll need you, since you seem to be able to=\r\n hear and smell things from far distances.&quot;\n\nQuickstride salutes.\n\n&quot;Yes sir=\r\n, I&#39;ll make sure nothing comes between us and the Ark.&quot;\n\nAs Tucson acknowle=\r\ndges everyone, Straight Shot nodds, and quickly transforms into her cross b=\r\now mode, while leaping up into Kup&#39;s hands. She also acomidates herself to =\r\nhis hand grip, to make it easier for him to implement her.\n\n&quot; Ready when yo=\r\nu are Kup.  My mechanisms are the same as a conventional cross bow, but I m=\r\nay appear much lighter than the traditional weapon.  I was designed like th=\r\nat for quick use, and precision.&quot;\n\nTucson turns his head to Kup.\n\n&quot; Don&#39;t w=\r\norry if you think you&#39;re going to miss a target, Straight Shot knows how to=\r\n compensate for that.  She can also help align her target and she will let =\r\nyou know when to fire if you think you need her guidence.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds =\r\nto Windlord.\n\n&quot;Hey, Windlords got a point guys, when do we head out?&quot;\n\nTucs=\r\non turns to Rat Trap.\n\n&quot; We begin now.  But we are not going to charge into=\r\n battle, seeing that Hydras may suspect our movements.  Cheetor, I trust yo=\r\nur instincts to the fullest, what I&#39;d like you to do, is scout the paramete=\r\nrs first.  Once you determine if the coast is clear, relay that to me, and =\r\nthen, we will slowly move into position in the areas Cheetor deems fit.  I =\r\nalso suggest we go in seperate teams.  Several at a time, spread out, and g=\r\no unseen.   Rat Trap, Windlord, you will travel with Night Shift, seeing th=\r\nat he is well versed in stealth combat.  He will get you to the fortress qu=\r\nietly, and under the noses of our enemy.&quot;\n\nNight Shift turns to Perceptor.\n=\r\n\n&quot; That&#39;s cool with me.  Perceptor, if ya could, send me a download of the =\r\nbase parameters, so I know where I&#39;m drivn&#39;.  If I get lost, I could get di=\r\nstracted, and then we&#39;re in really deep scrap.  The key ta how I operate is=\r\n me keepn&#39; my mind on where it has ta be.&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks to Rodimus.\n\n=\r\n&quot; If ya don&#39;t mind, I think you better station me outside, on top of the Ar=\r\nk, so I can keep an ear out for trouble.  That way, if something happens, I=\r\n can alert you guys.&quot;\n\nTucson&#39;s expression becomes as Resulte as Rodimus&#39;s.=\r\n  Now it was time, it was time to show Hydras that with the strength of fai=\r\nth and unity, no other power could overshadow the Maximal&#39;s or the Autobots=\r\n greatest attributes.  \n\n&quot;Rodimus is correct in his statements. It&#39;s time t=\r\no repay our debt to Hydras, and reverse what destruction he has inflicted o=\r\nn this planet, and on everyone who innocently suffered needlessly under his=\r\n regime.  Now, we begin.  Cheetor, I&#39;d like you to begin a scan of the para=\r\nmeters, and report back to me, as soon as you feel it&#39;s safe to continue, N=\r\night Shift, Windlord, and Rat Trap will begin phase two.  Phase three will =\r\ninvolve myself, Talon, Lord Elder, and then you will rejoin me for that as =\r\nwell.  While that happens, Rodimus, Stanton, Bump,and Quickstride, will rem=\r\nain here, to be sure the Ark is kept safe.  Rodimus, as soon as Quickstride=\r\n alerts you, that is the time to make your move.  We aren&#39;t leaving anythin=\r\ng to chance, and with our bases covered, we need not worry about that.  But=\r\n be cautious, watch your backs at all times, for anything can happen to any=\r\none, and we must not become too overconfident of our abilities, but be caut=\r\nious as we implement them.  Most of all, good luck and keep safe.&quot;\n\nTucson =\r\nturns to Cheetor.\n\n&quot; Cheetor, you may begin.  And good speed to you comrade=\r\n.&quot;\n\nHe puts a gentile hand on Cheetor&#39;s shoulder.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus stood looking =\r\nat the others and nodded a look of cold resolve\n&gt; on his face. &quot;Hydras need=\r\ns to be put out of commission once and for\n&gt; all.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I will stay here a=\r\nt the Ark to keep watch over it.&quot; He shrugged\n&gt; slightly, &quot;With most of the=\r\n force leaving, we need someone to watch\n&gt; it.&quot; He crossed his arms over hi=\r\ns chest, &quot;With Legacy, Santon and Bump\n&gt; here, we should be able to hold up=\r\n for a while.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder looked around, his optics intent and cautiou=\r\ns, &quot;Remember,\n&gt; Hydras has a very strong force over there, equal to ours, a=\r\nt least in\n&gt; numbers.&quot; Elder looked over at the monitor, &quot;Some of our force=\r\ns are on\n&gt; patrol; I will alert them should you guys need some back up.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Cheetor nods emphatically as the others talk and discuss battle plans.\n&gt;=\r\n He looked over at Tuscon, &quot;I will travel with you. You may need the\n&gt; back=\r\n up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus opened a commlink with the medbay where Perceptor, Legac=\r\ny,\n&gt; Bump and Santon were trying to work on Nightlight, &quot;How are things\n&gt; g=\r\noing in there? We could use Perceptor out here to help us to take\n&gt; Hydras&#39;=\r\n base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
