I killed him and then my \nleaders turned me into the maximal authorities.  I was to be tried \nand killed. But I escaped.  The last thing I remember was my ship \ngetting sucked into a black hole. After that, I remember nothing \nuntill I woke up in your arms.&quot;  she smiled at him, &quot;Which I aim to \nthank you properly for later on.&quot;\n\nSquizzy::\nShe tried her best to help all three of them to the lab.
