Slayer seemed to know this. Pride\n&gt; seemed to be the only reason this fight continued. Lunarpine refused\n&gt; to lose. He wasn&#39;t losing fluid nearly as fast as Slayer so he knew\n&gt; that he could outlast the bot even if it caust Lunarpine his own\n&gt; life. He wanted to save Shadow Wing but not if it cost the rest of\n&gt; the maximals thier lives by giving the traitor the chance to live. If\n&gt; he left Slayer&#39;s weapons alone Slayer would continue fighting and\n&gt; Lunarpine would have the opportunity to finish him. He had a better\n&gt; idea though. he leapt forward again slashing both claws at Slayers\n&gt; shoulder cannons and biting for his neck. If he got a hold on him at\n&gt; close range this battle would be as good as over with Lunarpine the\n&gt; victor.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Slayer continues to fly backwards, Lunarpine&#39;s slash leaving deep\n&gt; &gt; gashes in his chest. He was losing mechfluid quicker and quicker..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Enough of this, Maximal,&quot; he says, sending another barrauge of\n&gt; &gt; firepower at Lunarpine, &quot;Die. I have other things to do than kill\n&gt; &gt; you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine sees the opening he&#39;s created and leaps forward with a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful slash from his right claw. his body takes abuse as he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; charges but the surge of adrenaline going through him drowns out\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pain. It was time to put an end to this battle and to the traitor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; once and for all. Lunarpine couldn&#39;t let the fact that they once\n&gt; &gt; &gt; served together matter. At this moment only two things mattered\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him. Winning or losing would be the difference between who stands\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tall and who crawls away licking thier wounds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC Thank you and have a nice day.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
