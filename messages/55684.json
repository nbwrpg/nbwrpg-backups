You&#39;re here now, and until Hydras gets back to us, I&#39;m in \ncharge of this circus.&quot;  Flicker swirls the contents of his glass \naround.  &quot;While we&#39;re here ... Skyblaze, could you perhaps explain \nhow you sensed the death of a transformer I doubt you&#39;ve ever met?&quot;\n\n&quot;I, and my young daughter here, are not originally from Cybertron,&quot; \nSkyblaze says.  &quot;We are members of an energy-based race called the \nLumin - and sadly, we are a dying breed.  Most of us are too old to \nreproduce, including myself.&quot;\n\nFlicker raises an eyebrow.  &quot;Well, that clears up a few things.&quot;  \nPhoenix slides closer to him and rests her head on his shoulder.  \nFlicker automatically puts his arm around her shoulders - something \nthey&#39;ve done many times before.  &quot;It looks like your amnesia&#39;s \nfinally been cured.&quot;\n\nPhoenix smiles.  &quot;Yeah, finally.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt;        &quot;Hmm...?&quot;  He thinks for a moment.  &quot;Yes, I suppose there \nwas that one \n&gt; that Flicker killed during his escape.  Which I might add,&quot; he \nturns back to \n&gt; Flicker, &quot;was poorly planned.  You probably could have walked out \nwithout \n&gt; anyone noticing.  I doubt anyone has noticed my absence yet.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
