JP, what is your major malfunction?  Why can&#39;t you be courteous?\nIf this gets me kicked out of the game, so be it. You are a sadistic bully.\nI&#39;ve really enjoyed playing this game, except for when it comes to dealing\nwith you. Playing with people like Roborick and Yanshosh, and reading posts\nby Kinger and Airly is enjoyable. But you are a waist of my time. Why would\nhe do this to get out of a game, instead of just saying &quot;I Quit&quot; Even if it\nis a trick (which I dont believe it is, because I have more faith in\npeople) isnt it safer to just be polite? Just from reading your posts, I\nknew you would do some kind of sick twisted thing like this. I feel for\nyou, because you obviously dont have any redeeming qualities. Go ahead and\ninsult me back, with your elementary bashing, and crude post. Nothing you\nsay matters, cause everyone on this chat is levels above you when it comes\nto dealing with people. Go see a psychiatrist, because you are a royaly\nscrewed up person. Get a life. Sorry everybody, but I have no patience for\ndiscusting scum.\n\n\n\n"}}
