Go slowly.&quot; He glanced over at Hydras, &quot;I will send you a\nreport as soon as I know more.&quot; he said, his voice already destracted\nas he looked over the injured, trying to decide who needed his help\nfirst.\n\n*     *     *     *     *\n\nA few minutes later in Hydras&#39; throne room many of Predacon soldiers\nwere already begining to arrive as per his orders.\n\nTwo of Hydras&#39; long time soldier were among the first, Terrorsaur,\nWaspinator, they looked somewhat out of sorts. They had been away for\nquite some time and it was obvious that they had only recently\nreturned from other duties and other commanders, and they were still\nunsure of this new form of Megatron called Hydras.\n\nThen came the fuzors, the Predacons who&#39;s beast modes were\ncombinations of two different beasts at one: Skyshadow, thier leader\nand then Injector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, and Quickstrike, Quickstrike\nbeing the most familiar to Hydras.\n\nThe last to arrive was Taratulus. He came striding in looking every\nbit put off by this seeming intrusion on his time. He seemed surprised\nat the number of soldier that appeared here and said nothing. Instead\nhe sat back as if biding his time, suddenly interested in all the new\nthings going on, and the new opportunities presenting themselves.\n\nWith all these soldier showing up, there were still others who may\nhave been out on patrols or are unavailable. However there are two who\ndid not appear nor check in: Jhiaxus and Scorponok.\n\nAs Hydras entered the room followed by Deepstryke, Blackrazor and\nPhobia as well as Igunanus and then by Inferno, the room came to\nattention. &quot;We are yours to command mighty Hydras!&quot; Sky Shadow said as\nhe came to the front and saluted. &quot;What are your orders?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
