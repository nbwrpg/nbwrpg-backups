Swordance was a rather funny character, and she use to \nlaugh for hours just watching Rion try and do the instruction what were \ngiven to him by that instructor. Even though she tried to keep quiet, \nsometimes she would chuckle too loudly and Swordance would come rushing out \nand babble at her in some tongue she didn�t understand. Sounding like some \nautiotape wound backwards.\nDiana chuckled. That bot was always good for chuckle.\nBut Diana�s smile turned to that of concern as Rion explained that \neverything would be alright. He always said things like that when times \nturned rough, and in a time like this she really wanted her mother.\nDiana nearly jumped with fright as Rion leapt to his feet and extended a \nhand toward her, leaving her all wide eyed and her fur all bristled.\nShe didn�t take his hand as she got to his feet, feeling a little better, \nbut not too much. Diana pointed the way she had come. *\n\n� Okay. But not that way. There�s a big harry spider.� She sat back on her \nhonches and made wriggling motions like spider legs with her paws, also \nlaying her ears back against her head and making a disgusted face. *\n\n� Icky!�\n\n*Diana straightened herself then and then trotted up the nearest sandbank, \nlooking around and sighing. *\n\n� There�s nothing to explore!� She called back down to Rion. � It�s all sand \nand bugs and stuff!�\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
