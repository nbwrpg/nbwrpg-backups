He \nsinks to the bottom beside the ship, and bends over. He shoves his \nlarge hands under what he thinks is the bottom of the ship, pushing \nit towards the island since he shoved too hard. A rumble ensues and \nvibrations can be felt in the surrounding area. The ship rolls up the \nincline slightly, then settles roughly in Abominus&#39; massive hands\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Stratus::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Allright, I&#39;ll have him get the ship up.
