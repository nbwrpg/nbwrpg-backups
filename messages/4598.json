Finaly an oppurtunity to test \nout his TM3 body. He turned to Tank mode, firing missles around the \nbattlefield, but primairily at Unitron.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTerminess smiled to herself. A battle had broken up. She was not a \ngood warrior. So she was going to test out her new manu-guns. She got \ninto the chair and the large helmet went over her, giving her a \npicture of the battlefield. She activated the manu-guns, 3 huge \nBazooka type weapons. She decided to try them out on Unitron, and \nwould change to a different bot later. She began firing.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nBronco smiled.\n\n&quot;Times up, octociz. Now you die.&quot;\n\nBronco raised his blaster right at Octociz. Octociz had prepared to \ndie. But than Bronco&#39;s hand shook, and he pulled the gun away. He \nlooke sad.\n\n&quot;I...I can&#39;t kill you. I feel something for you, like I know you from \nsomewhere.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll let me help. Maybe we can find something.&quot;\n\nIt looked like Bronco was going to co-opertate with Octociz, but a \nmesage came from Iron Raptor, stating that he had won and the would \ngive him the tracking computer. Suddenly that fragile bot had gone \nback to the hatred filled Bronco he was before. He sent a message \nback to Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;I will give you one more mega-cycle. If I don&#39;t get my computer, I \nwill kill him.&quot;\n\n&quot;But....,&quot; said Octociz, &quot;But I thought you wanted my help?&quot;\n\n&quot;SHUT UP! I don&#39;t need your help. Anything that i used to know or was \nis gone. I want to be Bronco, and that&#39;s who I&#39;m going to be. I won&#39;t \nhesitate again. You have one mega-cycle.&quot;\n\nThe look of small hope turned to dispair again. Octociz only hoped \nthat Iron Raptro would get here in time.\n\n\n"}}
