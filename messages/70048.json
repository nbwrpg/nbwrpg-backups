Scorponok\nis holding his shot since he cannot, at this point, see well in the\ndark. However Scourge has no problem targeting folks in the dark due\nto his tracking sensors and enhanced senses, and he is firing at\nNightshift :)\n\nHowever it does seem that I misread your last post. I didn&#39;t realize\nthat Tuscon had made it all the way into the throne room before we\nposted the description of the fortress rising.\n\nBefore I post for Scourge and Scorponok I need to understand what they\nare seeing. What shape is Tuscon in?\n\nBefore you answer, please keep in mind that as soon as the fortress\ncame out of the magma, it would have been pretty much as I described\nin the last post I made for the base.\n\nThe displaced magma should have made it difficult for any ground based\nperson to approach immediately - imagine something like a huge ocean\nliner or larger rising from the water, and the amount of splashing\nthat would have occurred as it broke the surface - however here it is\nsearing hot magma! Once the base rose, it would have opened fire on\nthe Maximals, which would have included Tuscon, especially as he was\nstanding there ripping open the front doors. Then also there are the\ninterior defenses which would have been firing at Tuscon, or any other\nMaximal or Autobot the whole time that they made their way to the\nthrone room. That is a lot of firepower flying around.\n\nWhat is Tuscon&#39;s condition, so I can have folks react accordingly?\n\nThanks\nPreston\n\n"}}
