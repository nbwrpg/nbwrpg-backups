I hope it helps you Jd. I wrote it kinda fast, so I hope you \ncan follow =\r\nit)\n\nThe battle that stands before the optics of all is truly huge! \n\nOn on=\r\ne side is this battle is what will one day be known as mount St \nHillary an=\r\nd buried in its side is the Ark, the core and strength of \nthe Maximals and=\r\n Autobots of even this century. However at this \nmoment the ark is not visi=\r\nble covered as it is by some ball of ebony \ndarkness that obscures the imme=\r\ndiate area - A darkness that for the \nmoment appears to defy or at least hi=\r\nnder the probing of sensors and \ncommunications in and out. Strangely enoug=\r\nh, despite its inhibitive \neffects the darkness appears to have a definite =\r\nUnicronian signature \nto it. It is into this darkness that Kup has flown, a=\r\nnd so far has \nnot been heard from!\n\nNear to the ark, just outside the dark=\r\nness a shuttle - Maximal by \ndesign - is firing blasts into the air in the =\r\nhopes of defending the \nenshrouded ark against the onslaught of minions in =\r\nthe air! Nearby \nstand two defenders, Grimlock and Lord Elder who much like=\r\n the \nshuttle are firing into the air!\n\nOn the otherside of the battle are =\r\nthe Predicons and the Decepticons, \nwho appear to actually defending the ar=\r\nk as well! Hydras, Darkhawk \nand Perceptor have recently arrived on the sce=\r\nne, and are sending \ntremendous amounts of fire power into the seemingly un=\r\nending supply \nof minions that have swooped out of the skies! \n\nAbove them =\r\nall are the minions, sweeps of Scourge and Cyclonus, \nterminators of all th=\r\nings Cybertroninan =96 Autobot and Decepticon \nalike! They are commanded no=\r\nt by Decepticons but by the word of \nUnicron, and their commanders Cyclonus=\r\n and Scourge. The sweeps strike \nand attack, like killer bees on some unsus=\r\npecting prey! Decibel a \nminion lieutenant, who took damage from Hydras&#39; la=\r\nst attack screams \nin pain as she unleashes a viscous sonic attack of her o=\r\nwn, the sound \nof her pain becoming a sonic cone of destructive waves!\n\nIn =\r\nthe midst of all of this Jhiaxus and Myrmidon are flying, \nattacking these =\r\nflying menaces with ever ounce of strength pulsating \nthrough their systems=\r\n. Myrmidon has spiraled to the ground smoke \ncoming from several hits, and =\r\nyet he still continues to fight on even \nas Jhiaxus fights desperately to s=\r\ntay in the air!\n\nOn the ground just behind the battle lines beneath them Sc=\r\norponok \nfights a massive battle, as fusion powered blasts erupt into the a=\r\nir \nscorching several sweeps and yet these are only replaced by still \nmore=\r\n as they seek to separate him from his mortal spark. \n\nAnd yet at the very =\r\ncenter of all this, surrounded by a seeming storm \nof sweeps are two figure=\r\ns, fighting it out, locked in some battle \nthat none of the sweeps dare to =\r\nenter: Cyclonus and Rodimus! Cyclonus \nappears to be taller, more powerful =\r\nthen he was of old, his palms \nglow as he watches his foe carefully. Rodimu=\r\ns appears different as \nwell - His frame rather than its bright fiery red a=\r\nppears much \ndarker, almost black, and the wicked gleam from his optic is v=\r\nery \ndifferent from the one that many Maximals would recognize. \n\nIt is int=\r\no this conflagration of war and destruction that Shard has \nstumbled. And a=\r\ns he does so several sweeps - who appear to have \nnoticed his appearance - =\r\nturn toward him in mid air, with eerily \nsyncretus movements, several red d=\r\not `painting&#39; Shard as they do so! \n\nOOC: Jd, if you want Shard to fire aft=\r\ner Kup, that&#39;s cool. However as \nof the last update he is inside that big b=\r\nlack ball of Darkness that \nis surrounding the Ark and is not visible. I le=\r\nave it up to you as to \nwhat you want to do. Lord Elder and Grimlock are bo=\r\nth on the Maximal \nside, as is that shuttle, but there are few other Maxima=\r\nls or \nAutobots visible at the moment, unless you want to count Rodimus or =\r\n\nthere are some I have forgotten. \n\nShard might notice that the entire batt=\r\nle seems aimed not at Maximals \nvs Predicons but against the sweeps that ar=\r\ne dropping down on \neveryone from above, and seem intent upon destruction!\n=\r\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n"}}
