He led the way there to Dinobot, so he thought. \nHe stopped in his tracks, his body posed for battle. The Dinobot was \nstill there, this time closer. \n\nHe noticed something by his feet. It was a bot. And not just any bot. \nRattrap. Quickstrike optics brightened with thoughts of revenge. His \nrounded mouth plate slipped into a grin. He looked back at the \nDinobot, and noticed another thing different. This note was on the \nbot itself. It wasn&#39;t Dinobot.\n\n\n\nCyber Claw glared out cautiously out as a tiny young looking male ran \nout before her. He had a bizzare build, none she ever seen or dreamt \nof. \n\nShe spoke: &quot;Predacon, I come in peace. I am Cyber Claw. I want to \njoin your group, forgiveness for my betrayal. I bring you a Maximal \nin hopes of a definate welcoming and trust.&quot; She picked up Rattrap \nwith one hand. &quot;Do you accept?&quot;\n\n\n\nQuickstrike blinked and turned his head to look at his two comrades. \nHe turned his head back to Cyber Claw, and quickly said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; \nRattrap was what he really wanted.\n\n\n"}}
