Getting a lock, he \n&gt;fired\n&gt;four missiles off at the tower, gaining altitude quickly.\n&gt;\n&gt;===\n&gt;\n&gt;Nemesis Enforcer stopped, walking into the room, rifle raised.  Looking to\n&gt;Zardus in beast mode for a moment, he looked to the black box and \n&gt;DeathStorm.\n&gt;  &quot;Transformation lock, eh?  I want in!&quot; he yelled, pulling the trigger,\n&gt;firing 10 rapid laser bolts off at DeathStorm&#39;s chest torso.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Scattershot transformed into robot mode, entering the Alliance base and\n&gt;heading for his quarters, hearing laser bolts he smiled.  Taking out his 8\n&gt;inch energon blade, he laughed.  &quot;Time to gut someone!&quot; he yelled, walking\n&gt;slowly towards the source.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
