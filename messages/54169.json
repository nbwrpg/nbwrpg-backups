Like she had done so for millions of years; listening to orders, \nwaiting upon Megatron, even Galvatron, hand & foot; doing what ever mission \nthey asked of her; doing them without question, even though she may have \nhesitated on a couple of them, but nonetheless, she did her duty... without \nquestion. \n\nBut to finally hear him praise her... she had waited forever it seemed for \nthis. It was her goal in life,... to become his favorite warrior, to be his \nsecond in command. Commanding the Decepticons was not something she strived \nfor, it was a major honor, but... it was to replace Starscream that was her \ngoal. Now... would it be possible? There was no Starscream here... or so she \nthought. Last she saw of him was on Cybertron when Galvatron incinerated him, \nthen she heard of his return soon after disappearing into deep space. She \nknew he was out there, & found him upon a world as a sort of God to \nfleshlings. But.. it had been many years since she had seen Starscream. \n\nShe gazed at Hydras. In a trance, sort of stunned look. The organic side of \nher felt the rush of emotions surging through her. Emotions she was no \nprepared to experience, let alone experienced at all. \n\nThen she smirked, a wicked & dreamy look, &quot;All the better to serve you with, \nmighty Hydras. I am yours... to command as you see fit.&quot; A daring leap of \nfaith. But sometimes one had to dare to test the limits.\n\nShe realized that she was still clinging to him. Her form against his. She \nsmirked. Dare they part each other&#39;s company? True, that they could devise \nplots together, but... he did give her a mission. But she would wait a little \nlonger before starting that mission. \n\nShe laughed as a thought approached her. &quot;How coincidental. I do believe that \nthere is a Earth creature &#39;story&#39; or symbol of something called a ying & a \nyang: one is the dragon, the other a tiger. Both were symbols of great power &\n wisdom.

He was the result of what happened when Megatron & \nGalvatron merged. \n\nHer paw-hands went to his faceplate, as she touched him upon both sides, she \nhad noticed the difference in their color, slightly. Curiousity was what \ndrove her to study him. She wondered if she could touch those reminants of \nboth Leaders she once served. As she touched Hydras, her spark called out to \nMegatron & Galvatron.
