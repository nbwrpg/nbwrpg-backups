He was dizzy and weak. He mumbled, &quot;Ow, \nwhat hit me?&quot; He lifted his head, looking around at an interior of a room. \nHe looked down and saw a green glow mark on his side.\n\nHe remembered now. He was caught spying on two Preds, Stingtra and \nQuickstrike. He forgot how mean that son of a snake was. One crazy on two. \nHe remembered how the sparks flew when he fired a shot before the little \nthing jumped on him.\n\nOn primus! Where was he? Cheetor sat up.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
