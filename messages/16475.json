She still had her ribs causing \nher pain. She leaned back and thought about what the future would \nhold.  Despite her pred programming, she just didn&#39;t have the \nambition that most other preds had.  She focused more on the concerns \nof her team.  She wanted to try to make they were taken care of.  She \nthen realized that she would never make a good pred leader. She \nlowered her head and sighed.  She could never rule with the hand of \nterror like Megatron did. Or sacrifice her team mates to save \nherself. She took a deep sigh and wondered how she ever made it this \nfar as a leader.  She then thought of getting even with Megatron. \nThat thought brought a smile to her face.  She would like getting \nrevenge on him very much.  She then thought that if they killed \nMegatron, that would bolster the confidence in her team and then they \ncould attack and get those maximals that put them in this situation \nin the first place.  She realized that revenge was a good motivator \nfor herself and would just as good for her team mates.  She smiled \nand rested her head on her hand and slowly drifted off into sleep.\n\n\n\n"}}
