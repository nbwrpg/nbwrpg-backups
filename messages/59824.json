He picked himself up off the floor and stood up too fast, stumbled a second, then went out the door.  He went looking for Camoflage, but was unsucessful.  He then found Wolfblade fast asleep at a work bench.  He picked her up and took her to his quarters.  He set he on the bed and retrieved the generator she was working on.  He set it on the night stand, and went to the cargo bay.  He found a cargo net strong enough to support his weight.  He took it back to his quarters, string it up as a hammock, grabbed the alarm clock, climbed into the hammock, hit the lights, and went to sleep.\n\n\nshadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@...&gt; wrote:Wolfblade:\nShe yawned and kept working.
