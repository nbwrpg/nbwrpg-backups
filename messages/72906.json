Nothing out of his mouth, not even a growl.\n&gt; Then he raises his head somewhat with a reserved sigh.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; To assure the alliance, you promised the Predacons a maximal stasis pod.\n&gt; Why was this not brought to my attention directly?  And why did you agree\n&gt; with this bargain without my consent?  I thought I could trust you, Leo but\n&gt; it seems that like Rodimus, that air of trust simply isn&#39;t there.  I&#39;m not\n&gt; at all pleased with what has come to my attention, and I demand that the\n&gt; bargain be revoked immediately.  I also demand that you step down from\n&gt; command until further notice.  A life is not a mode of currency that can be\n&gt; exchanged for cooperation.  We must earn that right with trust and the\n&gt; promise to follow through with difficult challenges.   Now as of this\n&gt; moment, I request that Big Convoy assumes command beside me, since he has\n&gt; truly earned my trust during this time.   That&#39;s all I have to say, let&#39;s\n&gt; finish what we started, without having to pay with a life that is not our\n&gt; own.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; All the while, his tone is kept soft but with a very heavy heart.  He turns\n&gt; away from Leo, with his head lowered in disappointment.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME frowned, one that deepened as TUSCON talked.\n\nThere was a frown from SANTON as well, but he carefully put his arm on\nLEO&#39;s shoulder as he could see the anger that was building in him as\nTUSCON talked.\n\nIn fact there were various blinks and looks of surprise from most of\nthe MAXIMALS present. Although PREDACONS like SKY SHADOW got a\nmischievous look on his face as he heard the accusation, although\nCRYOTEK&#39;s was more amused than anything else.\n\n&quot;What!?!?&quot; LEO PRIME finally blurted out, his word an explosive sound.\n&quot;You relieve me of what and assign whom?&quot;\n\nLEO made to walk up to TUSCON but SANTON held him back, &quot;You do not\nhave the right to call for my resignation of command, my authority\nextends from the council.&quot; LEO&#39;s optics darkened further, &quot;And what\nmake&#39;s you think I would *ever* sell a life for *anyone* for *any*\npurpose? That sounds like a Predacon lie! and you believed it.&quot;\n\nFolding his arms over his chest LEO glaring at TUSCON, looking and\nobviously feeling very insulted. &quot;Perhaps it is you who needs to step\ndown if you are so easily taken in by this obvious ruse!&quot;\n\nBREAK and MACH KICK walked over and rooted around the hole that DRILL\nBIT had left behind as if they could pull him out of it.\n\n(TAG)\n\n-Preston\n\n"}}
