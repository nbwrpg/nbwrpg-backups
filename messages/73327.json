We don&#39;t even know what that is.&quot;\n\nJHIAXUS gaped as he looked down at his sensor reading, &quot;It is not\nregistering properly on my scanners. I am getting a lot of neutrino,\ntemporal and gravitational distortions from it!&quot; He said as he quickly\nbanked his ship away!\n\nSCORPONOK glanced back at HYDRAS, &quot;You have always been so quick to\ntake over, do you have any suggestions?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
