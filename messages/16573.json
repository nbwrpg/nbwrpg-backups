I thought he said it out loud. I&#39;ll just say in \nthis post that it was a guess, so that if it was right Striker \nwould&#39;ve felt without that option. And the door to Striker&#39;s cell is \nopen right now. Ignatius opened it. And Code, their in a mountain \nwith may tunnels and their at the top. You can&#39;t just talk, cause \nthey won&#39;t here you. Scan the mountain for technology and when you \nfind stuff just send a comm message. No word on Bob Skir yet. \nProbably forgot about us.\n\nTrainers\n\nPrebon gazed at Spears\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t want to have to give you the order, but it&#39;s all up to \nStriker here.&quot;\n\nPrebon looked at him. He was hoping Striker would do something when \nhe said he knew about his self destruct program, so Prebon would know \nif he really has one on, but he didn&#39;t flinch. He could probably put \nStriker out now, but he wouldn&#39;t know if he would explode or not. He \nhad to go with what he had.\n\n&quot;Striker, you don&#39;t understand, do you? The Maximals are only my \nfirst plan. If that fails, I&#39;m sure their are other groups that would \nfall for it. The minute you leave this ship though, Savage would be \nwaiting. And he wouldn&#39;t be happy. He hates you with all his soul, \nand he&#39;s nearly killed you before. He&#39;ll put you in stasis lock, and \nthan you explode. He&#39;ll probably get really hurt, but he&#39;s tough and \nwill survive after rehibilitation. It&#39;s not worth it Striker. You can \ngo free. And I also made a promise to Spears that if she serves me \nwell in the recent future, I may release her. This is the only chance \nyou&#39;ll get! I&#39;m not an evil sorcerer. I&#39;m only looking out for my \ngroups best interests. This is your only chane of survival and love. \nTake it!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nVulois\n\nVulois looked at Child.\n\n&quot;Yes I know. We have to work, or all is lost.&quot;\n\nHe turned back to Windrazor, Terradive and Afterburner.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll show you. Follow me.&quot; Vulois entered the base with Child still \nin his arms.\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream/Zardus\n\nStarscream.\n\n&quot;Yes, Lord Zardus!&quot; He turned to Gotron.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve got to go help some Alliance guys beat Maximals. I&#39;ll meet \nyou back here when we&#39;re ready for battle.&quot;\n\n&quot;Got it!&quot;\n\nStarscream sent a message to Phobia.\n\n&quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. Zardus has agreed to loan us the entire \nOblitercon force for our battle. They form a giant bot, remember? But \nin return for this I have to go fight in one of their battles. I will \ncontact you when I come back to the Alliance base.&quot;\n\nStarscream left for the battle.\n\nGotron sent his own message.\n\n&quot;Wheeljack, this is Gotron. Zardus told me to aid you in retrieving \nthe probe. What are your co-ordinates?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
