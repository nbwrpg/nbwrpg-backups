Simply stating the\n&gt; facts.And I understand your mistake. And, I never realized that you shot\nat\n&gt; Dinobot, CODE, however, it&#39;s too late to post them now.)\n&gt;\n&gt; * Dinobot&#39;s breathing was quick and uneven, the pain in both his side and\n&gt; chest the most extreme he had ever felt.\n&gt; The armor which had covered his side and half his chest was now completely\n&gt; gone, the volnerable circuits belieth covered in a constantly flowing\nsheet\n&gt; of mech-fluid.\n&gt; His head still bowed and the sight in his left optic gone, he simply\nkneeled\n&gt; there and collected himself. Actually forced to push back the incredable\n&gt; pain from his wounds with only his will power, his back becoming slick\nwith\n&gt; the sweat it took to keep the pain tollerable.\n&gt; He just KNEW that he wouldn&#39;t be able to make it back to the CF in one\n&gt; piece, the hint of battle always in his mind the second he had stopped in\n&gt; this clearing.\n&gt; No matter how peaceful, no matter how quant, the thought was always there.\n&gt; Dinobot missed the sounds of Prowls beating feet as the Maximal ran up to\n&gt; him, his optics clenched shut and his teeth bared and jaw clenched.\n&gt; However, as he opened his optics he finally heard Prowl&#39;s words, turning\nhis\n&gt; head towards the Maximal very slowly while taking in a long and very\npainful\n&gt; breath.\n&gt; But Prowl was on his blind side, and even turning his head to see the\ncomrad\n&gt; sent a splitting pain down his spine.\n&gt; A snarl trickled through his clenched teeth as he turned his head towards\n&gt; the ground once again, bowing his head while he coll,ected enough energy\nto\n&gt; do exactly the last thing he wanted to do right that moment.\n&gt; With more will power then he knew he stood, grunting as he straightened\nout\n&gt; his knees and alighned his spine so that he was standing upright.\n&gt; If he would have had any shade of real color, he would have just pailed.\nThe\n&gt; pain had increased, and if he was any less a man he would have whimpered\nin\n&gt; pain.\n&gt; However, he simply swallowed that whimper and looked towards Prowl with\nhis\n&gt; good optic.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I can make it...on...my own.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * He then looked out around the clearing, noticing that it was now\n&gt; completely dystroyed! All of it, completely gone! There were charge\ncraters\n&gt; every where, and downed trees, mech-fluid.\n&gt; This glade was no longer the peaceful dwelling in which Tavatron and\nhimself\n&gt; had relaxed in only 40 cycles ago. Now, now it was a battlefield.\n&gt; Dinobot growled, it sounding a little wet thanks to the mech-fluid which\nwas\n&gt; now working it&#39;s way up his throat.\n&gt; He spat the fluid from his throat as another thought entered his mind:\n&gt; Tavatron.\n&gt; Where was she, and was she injured?\n&gt; The area on which his good optic looked over didn&#39;t hold her within it&#39;s\n&gt; sight, so that meant that she would have to be on his blind side.\n&gt; All that mattered to him was getting her back to the CF and away from\nHarm,\n&gt; they also had no way of defeating the Alliance giant...so the battle was\n&gt; lost on their part.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
