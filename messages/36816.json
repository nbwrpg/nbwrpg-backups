A though \nraces through his head, &lt;&lt;There is an enemy outside your ship, \nand he is threatening to kill Commander Ironhide! I should save the \nCommander.&gt;&gt; He runs towards the bot, and to the side, making \nsure that there is nobody in his line of fire. His twin autocannons \nbegin firing in bursts of eight, and his arm freeze cannons launch \neight freeze blasts in total all directed at the bot near Ironhide, Arty.\n\n\n"}}
