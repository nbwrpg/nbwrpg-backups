If it gets to hot, pull out.&quot;\n\nNemesis and Scattershot both got up, heading off towards the Alliance base.\n===============\nRamhorn sighs, activating his com.  &lt;Iris...I think it \nis...hello...could...hmmm...this is so silly!  Tell Iron Raptor that Suukie \nmurdered Stinkbomb, and to have you set to open fire on Suukie if he \napproaches...errr...thanks&gt; Ramhorn grabbed Stinkbomb&#39;s body the Maximal \nDEAD, dragging him into the engine room, he put the &#39;corpse&#39; into an \nincinerator, shutting the door and heading for a CR chamber, slamming his \nfist against the wall.\n===============\nThe Rock went over to his stasis pod, getting in.  -Well, there&#39;s only one \nway to go, and that&#39;s down!- he thought to himself, pushing downward on the \nstasis pod, the pod going sliding down the Himalayas, at 8,500 FT high.  \nAfter several minutes, an avalanche was following Rock, the sea of white \ngetting closer and closer, Rock yelling out as what looked like a shooting \nstar came at him.  Hitting right in front of him, his own stasis pod went \nflying through the air 20 ft, slamming into the cold, wet snow, the avalanche \nburying him 10 ft deep.\n------------------\nThe figure, known as Usurper (a code name), activated the outer thermal \nreadings.  Below 0 degrees out farenheit.  Pressing a few buttons, the hatch \nof the stasis pod strained to open, snow beginning to fill the pod, though \nsteam was rising around it from the heat of hitting the Earth&#39;s surface.  \nFinally pushing it open, Usurper, 8 ft high, stepped out of the pod, shaking. \n Spotting a leg sticking out of the snow a few feet away, he walked over to \ninvestigate. \n---------------\nThe Rock could only see white, his optics moving side to side, widening as \nsomething grabbed him by the right leg, an unknown force with immense \nstrength ripping him out of the snow&#39;s grip.  Looking up, he recognized a red \nMaximal insignia.  Getting up, he spoke. &quot;Slag, am I glad to se-ugh!&quot; he \nyelled, a punch to the gut sending him keeling over, a kick sending him to \nhis back.\n\n&quot;At first, I thought this was a worthless ice planet after I came out of \nstasis lock and my internal repairs were done.  But now, I see, it is Earth \nin the past,&quot; reaching into subspace, the figure took out a laser pistol, \nslowly raising it as he spoke, &quot;the Maximal Elders tried to exterminate me \nfor what I did at Nebulos, but they failed.  You, one of their cronies, \nmust&#39;ve found me out.  I don&#39;t know how, but it-URGH!&quot; The Rock leapt up, \ntackling Usurper into the snow, a few swift punches causing the enemy to drop \nhis pistol, the rock getting up and kicking him in the stomach a few times.  \nGrabbing the laser pistol, the Rock began to run down the mountain, hoping \nnot to run into a patch of land with no snow on it.\n-------------------\nUsurper stood quickly, after Rock had gotten a hundred feet away.  Taking out \na sniper rifle, he smiles, activating the electric scope, zooming in closely, \nthe crosshairs closing in on the back of Rock&#39;s left shin, pulling the \ntrigger back a single time, a blue bolt shot out, tearing through the \nunsuspecting Rock&#39;s shin, tumbling to the ground yelling pain.  Putting the \nrifle away, taking otu another pistol, Usurper headed for the Rock, going at \na slight jog.  \n\n"}}
