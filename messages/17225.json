(Without Alex Trebek) Strikers advanced senses would let \nhim smell them before they were close enough to strike. (No pun \nintended.) At least with Lunarpine there in plain sight the trainers \nwould know that they&#39;re dealing with a level field.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Ramulus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus nods. &quot;Allright, but that&#39;s the only weapon we have agains \n&gt; those chips so far.
