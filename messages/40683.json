It is a flashback to tell of the day the\nCarnitrons were slaugtered(SUPPOSEDLY by the Aliiance),it may present\ncontriversy, but please I want to be a fiction writer so enjoy.\n\n A young Mustex is standing on a large rock before 6 other bots(all \nin Beast\nMode). They are in a narrow canyon.\nMustex:Carnitrons I call you to give up all past ties! We are new and \nwe now\nclaim to take what we need, help whoever WE need, and anialate those \nwe\ndon&#39;t.\n Suddenly a blast is fired from above.\nMysterious Bot:Feel the wrath of the Alliance.\nMustex:What why would the the Alliance attack us. TRANSFORM!\nCarnitrons:CARNITRONS CARNIVATE!\n The Carnitrons begin firing back,but to little avail. Mustex sees \nhis friend\nRhesus is in trouble without long range weapons.\nMustex:RHESUS RUN!\n Rhesus runs out of the canyon and seeing all is lost Mustex joins \nthem.\n(later)\n Mustex and Rhesus return to find their friends devestated. They hear \na moan\nand see that Croctoc is still barely alive. They run over to him.\nMustex:Oh no. You&#39;ll be o.k.. We&#39;ll get help.\nRhesus:We&#39;re so sorry! We should have stayed and fought!\nCroctoc:No way! The only reason any of us lasted as long as we did \nwas to\ncover for yo guys. This way the Carnitrons will never entirely be \ndead even\nif you 2 choose a new path. Now you can destroy the ones who did this.\nCARNITRONS FOREVERRRRRrrrrr...\nRhesus:I&#39;ll destroy the Alliance.\nMustex:Wait a minute. We don&#39;t know for sure it was them yet.\nRhesus:Do whatever you want.\n He runs off leaving Mustex alone with Croctocs shell. Mustex buries \nthe 5 of\nthem,and changes his insignia back to Maximal. He then senses 2 \nstasis pods\n(Stallex&#39;s and a null)and heads off to claim his new ally.\n\n\n I&#39;ll gladly accept if anyone makes up a confession for their \ncharacter. The\nAlliance story doesn&#39;t sound totally believealble(although I&#39;ll use \nit with\npermission from Zardus).\n\n\n\n"}}
