The Maximals are \n&gt; complacent right now but they could easily attack us.  If we kill too many of \n&gt; them they may very well do that.  I think we should separate them then send a \n&gt; forged video of the others being killed.  That way they still crack without \n&gt; as much risk to us.  I think Blaze said he(?) was a computer specialist.  He \n&gt; should be able to make an indistinguishable video.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
