As\nthey moved across the broken terrain they drove past were it looked as\nif a massive battle of some sort had taken place some time ago. This\nis obviously were the minions had made their attack on the Ark several\nmonths ago. Only now was the scorched ground begining to heal as weeds\nand different wild grasses were begining to peak out from beneath the\nrocky grounds.\n\nThe Ark is as Tuscon and the rest left it. Even for Perceptor, the Ark\nhas not changed appreciatively since the last scans he had recieved\nfrom it. A broken ship lying partial entoumbed in the side of a mid\nsized mountain.\n\nAs Tuscon and those that were with him approached the Ark the Ark\ncomputer voice could be heard, &quot;Predacon signature detected.&quot; The Ark\nshields snapped into place as the base went on alert and weapons began\nto target Tuscon . . . or perhaps someone he&#39;s carrying.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
