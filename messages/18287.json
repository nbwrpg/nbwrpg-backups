She had a big knot on her head \nfrom where she hit the tree branch.   She was still laying there, and \nseeing with blurred vision from the impact.  She had hit that thing \nrather hard.  She rolled over on her side and groaned. &quot;Oh cripes, \nwhere did that brick wall come from?  It just ran out in front of \nme.&quot; She slowly got up to her knees.  She transformed into bot mode \nand looked around.  She had only been out for a few minutes, but that \nwas time lost that she could have used to run away with.  She looked \naround and rubbed her eyes.  her optics were stilled a little fuzzy, \nbut she could see something, something bigger than her, running \ntowards her.  She turned and went to run, when she hit the tree \nbranch again.  She fell down and groaned. &quot;Gee, you&#39;d think the \nMatrix wasn&#39;t on my side today.&quot;  She got up again and this time, she \nducked under the branch.  But the bot was not almost on top of her.  \nShe just ran, vision blurred still, she just ran through the forest.\n\n\n\n"}}
