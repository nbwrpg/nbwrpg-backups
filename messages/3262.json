The \nbattle sounded like it had ceased. He kept listening just to make sure. The \nMaximals could make a counterattack. Maybe they were at the ramp right now, \nready to blow the hatch down, and he and Mantella were right there.\n\nThe ambient was a numb silence. Quickstrike was a little unsettled by it. He \ncould hear his own spark pulse with the quietness.\n\nHe leaned away from the hatchway and stood up straight.\n\n&quot;Sounds like it&#39;s over,&quot; he announced to Mantella near-by. It was a good \nthing to him. He rather now fight at this time. But if he had to, he was \nready. He always was. Even if was injured.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
