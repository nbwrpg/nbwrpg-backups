At Feline�s introduction she simply nodded, ready to \nlisten to this new bot�s story and to decipher if she was either true friend \nor a foe in the image of another.\nAs Feline began to relate the story of how she had come to be there Iron \nRaptor listened intently, taking in everything that this fembot related to \nher.\nBy the time that she was through with her tragic telling she was on her \nknees and held her hands to her face, seemingly in utter despair but not \nwithout sympathy�even slightly.\nIt was strange, but for some odd reason that story that Feline had related \ndidn�t sound as real as she was sure the fembot intended it to be. But there \nwas still nothing that she could use as a solid factor against her, other \nthen she had been with the Alliance for a time and might have learned \nsomething vital about them.\nBut with the fembot on her knees in the corner, now wasn�t the time to \nquestion her.\nIron Raptor walked over to the crying Feline and held out a hand to her, \nactually feeling sympathy for the little cat-bot.*\n\n� Come on, get to your feet. There�s no reason to worry about the Alliance; \nyou�re with us now. And if there�s anything we Maximals are known for, it�s \nour respect for one another.�\n\n* But then she suddenly developed a slightly annoyed expression on her face, \nlooking off into space. *\n\n� Most of the time.�\n\n* But her voice was low, mostly speaking to herself then Feline. But then \nher calm and collected expression returned when she looked down at Feline, \nher hand still held out to help the fembot back to her seat. *\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
