Save yourselves.&quot;\n\nShe winced in pain and moaned as the pain surged through her body. She tried \nto lift her gun but it was too heavy for her to lift in this weakened state. \n  She tried to transform but couldn&#39;t.  All she could do was lay there.  She \nhated not being able to fight.  She hated not being able to move.  What \nhappened to her? She didn&#39;t even know how she got outside.  She saw \nTurantulas standing next to her.  She wanted to get back at him for what he \nhad done to her.   She tried with all her strenght to lean a little closer \nto him.  She got within inches of one of his 8 legs.  She closed her optics \nand bit down as hard as she could on Turantulas&#39;s leg.  She sunk her teeth \nin as far as she could and held on.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
