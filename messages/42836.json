Sure they&#39;re going slowly=\r\n at the moment \nbut \n&gt; it&#39;s a \n&gt; &gt; really big annoyance having a commander =\r\nas a character. \nEspecially \n&gt; when \n&gt; &gt; they&#39;re being called on 24-7 and e=\r\nxpected to post right when \n&gt; someone needs \n&gt; &gt; them. It&#39;s really stressfu=\r\nl. Especially when I didn&#39;t ask for the \n&gt; position \n&gt; &gt; and now that I&#39;ve =\r\ngot it I really wish that I hadn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t \n&gt; exactly \n&gt; &gt; expect to have=\r\n everything dumped into my lap, so to speak.  So, \n&gt; with regret \n&gt; &gt; none =\r\nthe less, I&#39;ve decided to leave the NBW.  I mean, it&#39;s not \n&gt; like I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n going to be missed or anything. IR never really did much anyway=85\nif \n&gt; y=\r\nou think \n&gt; &gt; about it, right?  So these characters are up for grabs:\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Diana\n&gt; &gt; D\n&gt; &gt; Tremmer\n&gt; &gt; Zyber\n&gt; &gt; Desmonus\n&gt; &gt; Biomass\n&gt; &gt; Nue&#39;e an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; Sublime!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyone can take `em. No one needs to ask.  Though I=\r\n would like to \n&gt; keep IR, \n&gt; &gt; if that&#39;s alright with everyone? She was my=\r\n first character and \nif \n&gt; I ever \n&gt; &gt; decide to return I would like to ha=\r\nve her.  Maybe when school \ndies \n&gt; down a \n&gt; &gt; bit I&#39;ll come back. But it&#39;=\r\ns just too much now.
