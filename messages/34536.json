Rion pushed through the thick vegetation on the other\nside of \n&gt; the trees and stopped short.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I&#39;m going to let you take it from here Meg^_^)\n&gt; \n&gt; * * * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Swyft:\n&gt; \n&gt; (I didn&#39;t get a reply to my last e-mail, so I&#39;m just gonna... do\nsomething, \n&gt; yea...)\n&gt; \n&gt; A light scraping noise and small scratches marked Syft&#39;s passing as\nshe \n&gt; dragged her claws against the left wall of the hallway. She was a\nlittle \n&gt; bored and had not been listening to Devilduer&#39;s response (If there\nwas one):\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Who did you say your leader was?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * * * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron:\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron stretched and groaned as she pushed herself into an akward\nposition \n&gt; against the side of the CR chamber. It had taken a while, but all of\nthe \n&gt; internal damage had been repaired.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;No thanks to you.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;What is that supposed to mean?&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron rubbed the side of her head as she pushed the CR hatch open\nall the \n&gt; way. She clambered out, her legs unsteady after being in a confined\nspace \n&gt; for so long. She stretched one, then the other before leaning back\nand \n&gt; twisting, listening as her back cracked into place.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;You&#39;ve nearly gotten us killed numerous times since our arrival. I\ndon&#39;t \n&gt; plan on dying anytime soon. You, on the other hand, are expendable.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron&#39;s body became rigid as waves of electricity shot through\nher. The \n&gt; voltage forced her to lean against the wall for support and dig her\nclaws \n&gt; into the thick metal. Finally, after several antagonizing minutes\nTavatron \n&gt; was able to force Tav to release her hold on the form they shared\nand \n&gt; collapsed against the wall.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;That... hurt.&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Yes, and there is nothing you can do about--&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tav cried out as Tavatron mentally shut her out from any conscious\nthought.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Finally, peace.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron walked through what remained of the original CF. It seemed\na lot \n&gt; had happened since she entered the &#39;R chamber. The battle still\nraged, but \n&gt; on a less impressive scale. The sounds told her what little she\nneeded to \n&gt; know. Tavatron left the ship and watched as the Decepticons battled\nwith the \n&gt; Maximals and vice versa.\n&gt; \n&gt; (If I made any mistakes lemme know, kay?)\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
