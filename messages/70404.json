Not even myself. So, I ask all of \n&gt;&gt; you to show him the respect, you would show your leader, Lord Elder, and \n&gt;&gt; Primes who have governed before me. Let this be known that it is not a \n&gt;&gt; request, but as a Prime, I am telling you to respect those who have shown \n&gt;&gt; the capability of turning over a new leaf.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Quickstride nodds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; He&#39;s telln&#39; the truth guys, Perceptor&#39;s legit.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Straight Shot also gives them a thumbs up.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;And if I didn&#39;t give a thumbs up then you&#39;d know it&#39;s not true.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheetor paused, anger and distrust written clearly on his face, and\n&gt; although he&#39;s too far away from Tuscon, or anyone still in the pit to\n&gt; see it, it is also in his voice as he responded with a single word,\n&gt; &quot;FINE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile Ramulus and Airhammer say nothing, although Ramulus grumbled\n&gt; slightly as he attempted to draw poeple up. However it was impossible\n&gt; to say whether Ramulus was grumbling about Perecptor about pulling\n&gt; poeple up by himself or perhaps about the situation in general,\n&gt; Ramulus was a grumbler anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheetor came over and began helping Ramulus pull as Airhammer stayed\n&gt; in the air, acting as security, his sharp sensors keeping a lookout.\n&gt;\n&gt; With Cheetor&#39;s help, and hopefully anyone else who was pulled up, it\n&gt; was easy to pull everyone else out of the pit, even Tuscon, who proved\n&gt; to be the heaviest of them all.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson Prime waits for everyone to get out safely before making moves to \n&gt;&gt; get himself out of the deep hole. He assists on holding the cable so is \n&gt;&gt; to make it easier for the others to climb out. It was what Optimus Prime \n&gt;&gt; would have done, before helping himself out of a tight jam.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; All right, I don&#39;t wish to overload anyone, so I will wait until \n&gt;&gt; everyone else is out safely, before I get out of here myself. I want to \n&gt;&gt; make sure that no one is left behind.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor/Talon:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Let him be alone&quot;defended Talon at Perceptor while she landed &quot;He \n&gt;&gt; &gt; didnt\n&gt;&gt; &gt; liked to come with us but he was caught helping Rodimus and others \n&gt;&gt; &gt; leave\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hydras&#39;s territory, he handt choice&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; She was ready for help.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ********\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I knew that this will happen&quot;whispered bitterly Perceptor.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Preston Carroll&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, June 10, 2010 5:42 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Into the Darkness\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As talon flew up, he quickly caught up with Legacy, who was himself\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; flying much slower as he was carrying Rodimus. As Talon got closer he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; could hear last bit of the conversation Legacy was having with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheetor\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; via radio. Cheetor was saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t trust those\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons, they&#39;ve fooled us before.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t trust those Predacons at all!&quot; Ramulus quipped, also over \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; radio.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You don&#39;t trust anyone Ramulus!&quot; Cheetor said, half jokingly\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You are correct.&quot; Legacy replied via radio, cutting into thier side\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; conversation, &quot;However so far Perceptor has proven loyal in this\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; respect.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheetor sighed, &quot;Okay, I gotcha. Give the bot rope to hang himself \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Tucson sends out a sonar wave, and quickly finds the hook with his \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hand,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wrapping around his arms securely. He looks down to the others.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot; All right, I have the cable. Can you pull more than just one of us \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; up\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; at a time? If not, I&#39;ll wait until the others are up there safely.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Talon got to the top he could see Cheetor standing at the top of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the pit, with Airhammer in his strange Hammerhead Shark-Hawk beast\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mode hovering watchfully in the air, he seemed agitated.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus was standing at the edge of the pit, the rope that was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; dangling down had been shot from Ramulus&#39; forearm, and that he was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; standing braced to pull others to saftety.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy, on the other hand had not slowed in his flight as he rose\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; higher into the air, taking Rodimus in the direction of the Ark,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Maybe I could get two or three if I could get some help here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus griped as he glanced meaningfully at Talon, Cheetor and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Airhammer!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
