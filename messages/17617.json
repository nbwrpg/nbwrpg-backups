We can try to clear out our old cave or go scouting for a \nnew one? Any ideas?&quot;\nFor a pred leader, she knew her one weakness was that she like to \nfunction as a group and not as separate bots, but more like one \nfunctioning unit. But then again, it got her this far.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Bludgeon:::\n&gt; \n&gt; Bludgeon: Id hate to crash the party, but, Kit Kats right.
