We have reason to believe that a\nvery infections and lethal plague is airborn and heading this way. If\nyou are infected you will not notice symptoms at first, but will later\nencounter small glitches, and eventually decay of rust.

I guess the attack on the Predacons that\nKatya and I were planning will be delayed even more. \n&gt; He reaches the office and finds only Yggdrasil inside. \n&gt; Kup: Commander, I&#39;m sure you heard my report over the comm.
