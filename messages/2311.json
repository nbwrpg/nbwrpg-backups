Oblitertron/Nemesis Enforcer/Koga Shuko/Scattershot/Hades/Anubis/Unitron:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Oblitertron let out an evil laughed as Radistor split apart, Breakdown\ntaking\n&gt; over at this moment in a battle:\n&gt;\n&gt; ( Dark One&#39;s essence surged forward, taking the shape of his body at a\n&gt; yellowish tunnel, grabbing Pyro, he pulled his fellow comrade back,\nkneeing\n&gt; him the back, Breakdown flying in, uppercutting Dark One, then flying into\n&gt; the tunnel)\n&gt;\n&gt; After a minute of not moving, Oblitertron came back to life, Dark One in\n&gt; control, falling to one knee from not moving from the autoguns&#39; attacks,\n&gt; firing an optic blast and a burst of flames simultaneously at the side of\nthe\n&gt; base, as he prepared to stand up.\n&gt; --------------\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer stumbled back, a few autogun shots digging into his left\n&gt; side, firing off his last rocket off at a space in between two autoguns.\n&gt; --------------\n&gt; Anubis began to approach Nemesis, a single autogun shot hitting him in the\n&gt; side of his armored head, Anubis yelled in pain, falling to one knee,\nfiring\n&gt; off a missile at the People&#39;s base in anger.\n&gt; --------------\n&gt; Hades fired off a missile at the People&#39;s base, putting the launcher into\n&gt; subspace, as it ran out of ammo, taking out a laser rifle in one hand, an\nuzi\n&gt; shaped weapon that fired shells.\n&gt; -------------\n&gt; Unitron fired off four shots (total) from his two laser rifles, the\nkickback\n&gt; not even being noticed by him, two bolts heading at a autogun, another two\nat\n&gt; a different autogun.\n&gt; -------------\n&gt; Koga Shuko yelled two bolts from the leader of the Radicons digging into\nhis\n&gt; heavily armored side, seeing Anubis screw up he sighed, not being able to\nsee\n&gt; his attacker, firing off a missile at the People&#39;s base, no longer able to\n&gt; see the Radicons.\n&gt; -------------\n&gt; Scattershot flew ahead, seeing the Radicons sitting down, except for the\n&gt; leader, taking out his last charges, he threw them down at the Radicons,\n&gt; taking out his machine gun that fired explosive rounds, about to show\nthose\n&gt; punks why he was called Scattershot.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;
