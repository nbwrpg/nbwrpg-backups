I wonder what kind of a mo=\r\nod we&#39;ll find Tucson in..  You know how much he hates it when Hydras makes =\r\na mess of things, imagine what he&#39;s gonna be like if he has ta deal with a =\r\nsecond nemesis.  And then there&#39;s this thing about Rodimus..  That is so go=\r\nnna put him over the edge.  And you really don&#39;t wanna see an angry dragon =\r\nwhen he&#39;s in the worst of his moods.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot nods.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; No, w=\r\ne don&#39;t .  I hope Rodimus tries to explain himself gradually around my brot=\r\nher because if he plows into him about it, yeah, Tucson will snap, and we d=\r\non&#39;t want that.  But if he waits and thinks about how to explain in a civil=\r\n manner, Tucson will listen to him.  But if he says he can not be trusted w=\r\nith the Matrix, then his request to hand it over has ta be honored, and it =\r\ncan only be given to Leo Prime as he requests.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap cocks his head=\r\n curiously.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Why can&#39;t Wings hold onto it?  He&#39;s earned that right mo=\r\nre than a few times.  He put his life on the line for everyone and he gave =\r\nhis all ta Silverbolt when he didn&#39;t even have enough for himself.  So why =\r\ndoesn&#39;t he deserve that honor?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot looks to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Goo=\r\nd question, he never said why he didn&#39;t feel that he deserved to have the M=\r\natrix.  But he wants Leo Prime to hold onto it so we have to honor his requ=\r\nest. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstride nods.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Come to think of it, I kind of remembe=\r\nr seeing a lot of damage to the walls of that cave the first time we went i=\r\nn to scope it out.  It looked like a large animal was taking his anger out =\r\non the walls.  That old dragon must&#39;ve had a really baaaad temper and he di=\r\ndn&#39;t want to take it out on any other creature but himself.  And now, Tucso=\r\nn is the Silver Dragon, temper and all.  So he probably feels that his flaw=\r\ns aren&#39;t worth the honor of the Matrix.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t be envious of what you =\r\ndon&#39;t have, be grateful for things you already posses.  Nothing is worth mo=\r\nre than family and friends.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 30, 2011, at 1:40 AM, &quot;adamsafran&quot; =\r\n&lt;adamsafran@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; LEO PRIME gave HYDRAS a surpri=\r\nsed look, but then shook his head,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Fine.&quot; he said.
