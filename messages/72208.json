There were other short nods of\n&gt; assent from around the room as well.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;We were among the first of his experiments.&quot; UNUS spoke in low tones,\n=\r\n&gt; his voice hard as his optics blazed slightly. &quot;But we were more than\n&gt; he=\r\n had anticipated and were able to escape our captors and found our\n&gt; way he=\r\nre.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He gestured at the building around them, &quot;It is we who have built=\r\n this\n&gt; structure and we who stand firm against they who would control the\n=\r\n&gt; jungle.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Returning his arm to his side UNUS looked squarely at WHEEL=\r\nIE, &quot;As to\n&gt; who it was that spoke to us about your coming, we have no name=\r\n for\n&gt; him. He told us a few small things about himself and then was overco=\r\nme\n&gt; by his injuries.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was slight smile, &quot;However we have repair=\r\ned him. My physicians\n&gt; were just informing me that he had awakened when yo=\r\nu arrived. This was\n&gt; a most serendipitous event indeed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS gesture=\r\nd, &quot;Come I will take you to him.&quot; His gestures were to one\n&gt; of the side do=\r\nors leading further into the structure. &quot;Perhaps he will\n&gt; have answers for=\r\n you as well.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ASTRA and FIREHORN made to follow as well.\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWHE=\r\nELIE was not particularly well versed over in the intricacies of Predacon a=\r\nnd Maximal politics, but even he had heard a glistening of the dread MAGMAT=\r\nRON.\n\nWalking along with the three, he nodded, &quot;Perhaps, that is the way I =\r\nshall go.  As they say, the more I shall know.&quot; \n\nWalking along&lt; &quot;And I am =\r\nsorry you came from Magmatron.  He is a terror that let much on.  I must ap=\r\nologize for what he made you this day, I am thankful you were able to get a=\r\nway.&quot;\n\nWalking along wtih them towards the mysterious unit that they had me=\r\nntioned who had told of thier origins, and watching around quietly.  The pr=\r\nesence of Magmatron and the unit he had not heard of desginate Saberback wo=\r\nuld be filed away in his processor, as soon as he was out of this strange n=\r\null zone of communications to be broadcast back to the Maximal command staf=\r\nf present.\n\n\n\n"}}
