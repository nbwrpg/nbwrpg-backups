He =\r\ncould see the statue not\n&gt; &gt; too far off and the trail that led between the=\r\n town and the cave and\n&gt; &gt; the town and the mine entrance to the cave.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; From the cave there was the sounds of dim laser fire, it came out\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsounding somewhat like aggressive crickets as things went back and\n&gt; &gt; fort=\r\nh!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was a vague sense of PREDACON in the area but nothing spe=\r\ncific,\n&gt; &gt; perhaps they were in hiding, waiting for the nest moment of atta=\r\nck.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Deep behind a small hill, out of optical sight of TUCSON and t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; others the PREDACONS were watching, crouching silently.
