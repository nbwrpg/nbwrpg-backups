Should I win, the protoforms will be Tripredacus property \nand will not belong to my employer, which will most likely be you at that \ntime. As for my capacities, I am a murderer, an assassin, a terrorist, a \nsoldier, a warrior, an extremist, a shock trooper, I am anything you would \nask of me. However, I suggest you to give me specific orders, because any \ndetails that you will not have covered will be left to my discretion. This \nwill ensure you that no... how could I say... frustrating events will \ninterfere with your plans. As for my reward, we will see to it later.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
