It seems like it&#39;s almost a\nreligion to him and his group. The three of them seem almost fanatical about\nit.&quot; He walked past her a little, his back was now to her, &quot;Let&#39;s play thier\nlittle game and see just what the next move is.&quot; He didn&#39;t exactly trust the\nscientist but wanted to repay the debt he owed. If that meant pulling one of\nhis group out of trouble then that&#39;s what he&#39;d do. He wouldn&#39;t drag Ice into\nthis battle though, he still thought of her as the recon bot that Shadow\nWing had been.\n\nVeratis stood up for a moment holding his head. &quot;Is there a problem?&quot;\nInquired Foxfingers as he placed a hand on his meantors back. Veratis\nglanced around the room, trying to regain his equilibreum, &quot;I just got dizzy\nfor a moment it&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot;\n\nThe Protoform with the Raptor DNA was nearly complete. Veratis had hoped\nthat the spark inside could be taught the ways of Prime. Time would tell\njust who or what would become of the new translife form.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, November 22, 2000 9:38 AM\nSubject: Re: Obsessive compulsive behavior begins.\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She smiled and put Lunarpine down gently. She closed her eyes and\n&gt; concentrated on Veratis.  She looked inside Veratis&#39; mind and\n&gt; searched for the thoughts on LadyHawk.  She found some in the back of\n&gt; his mind. She whispered while she kept looking. &quot;She is one of his\n&gt; group. She is,&quot;takes a deep breath,&quot; looking for the same things that\n&gt; FoxFingers is. Samples, to help create the new bot forms. Fulling the\n&gt; prophecy of Primus.&quot; she stopped and opened her eyes, but the link\n&gt; was still there. She stared at the wall. &quot;He is, worried about her.\n&gt; She has not returned and he is concerned.&quot;\n&gt; Her body trembled slightly, she hadn&#39;t yet kept a link up this long\n&gt; and it was starting to drain her.
