As she \nenters the CR room, she spots Burning Hammer on the ground \nunconcious, &quot;Burning Hammer? Uhh, hello?&quot; She puts Trinity into \nan empty (obviously =P) CR chamber, and starts the process \nknowing that the small bot will be done soon. Then she turns to \nBH, &quot;Hmmm, you don&#39;t look so good...&quot; She kneels beside him, \nand examines him, looking for a reason for his unconcious state.\n\nMeanwhile, outside the Chivitron base, Lokk is still hiding behind \nthe hill. He spots Windlord fighting close combat with Vampiza, \nand grumbles, not wanting to shoot and damage his fellow \nChivitron. He picks out Apewing, and his twin chainguns unload \nhalf a clip each, hoping to surprise the bot.\n\nAxis peeks his head over the pod, and spots Speed Viper. He fires \na laser blast, then arcs a missile at the bot. Then he crouches \nback behind the pod.\n\n\nOn 22 Jul 2001, at 18:02, Roland the Last Gunslinger wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Mmmmmm YOU KNOW WHAT?
