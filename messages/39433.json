And as a reward for your loyalty, I would ask that \n&gt; you please assemble a unit of 12 outside the city limits. Ready to move out \n&gt; and assist the Chevron cause at my command.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Thus...she placed her faith in the Maximal that stood at her side. As \n&gt; squad leader for this mission.\n&gt; It HAD occurred to her time and time again that, someday and soon, she had \n&gt; to single out and officially title a transformer to take up the role of \n&gt; 2nd-In-Command.\n&gt; But her attention was soon grasped by AzureBlade; a pleased look crossing \n&gt; her features when he bowed but then that expression was wiped clean off her \n&gt; face when he suddenly spoke his TRUE name.\n&gt; &lt; Protoform Z?!&gt;\n&gt; She remembered the reports on the Protoform X that was in the original Beast \n&gt; Wars...and she remembered the fight she had with it before she was named \n&gt; 3rd-in-command.\n&gt; Slag! That had been one tough bot.\n&gt; And here, bot bowing right in front of her was just ANOTHER of those \n&gt; creatures.\n&gt; Iron Raptor&#39;s expression became cold as she eyed AzureBlade, a thoughtful \n&gt; brow lifting. The dominant claw on her boot armor coming down and sparks \n&gt; flew as the tip collided with the armored floor.\n&gt; It was questionable...yes. But could she condemn another prototype that was \n&gt; no different then herself?\n&gt; Her expression softened a bit.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; AzureBlade...though I know nothing of your sins I am sure that, as long as \n&gt; your actions remain true to the Maximal cause, orders are followed, and your \n&gt; loyalty remains pure for the remainder of your existence, all will be \n&gt; forgiven.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * A growl tricked from her throat as blue eyes narrowed.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; But for a time being you will remain close to me. So that you not only \n&gt; show that you are worthy to the fellow Maximals but to me as well.\n&gt; Until you have proven so, your acceptance into this unit is reserved.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor looked down at him.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Do you understand?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
