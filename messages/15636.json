The\n&gt; battle in which HotRod is in, it is too far away. Besides, how would\n&gt; Skulletron know about HotRod being hurt if they are still inside the\n&gt; ship?  But HotRod could be brought into the ship in damaged condition\n&gt; after the fight.  SO Feline would still be able to reek havoc after\n&gt; he is brought back to the ship.)\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Feline::\n&gt;\n&gt; She smiled at the thought of destroying the maximals from within.\n&gt; They would never expect a friend to turn on them like that.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Skulletron/Necromancer::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Skulletron looked at Feline.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &quot;Hey, beautiful, we&#39;ll go get that fool Hot Rod.

Necromancer\n&gt; quickly picked up the tree, struggling not to drop it.  He used all\n&gt; his might to lift it up, and TRY to drop it on top of Breakdown\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
