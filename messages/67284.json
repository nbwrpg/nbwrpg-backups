Red like the landscape it =\r\nflew from, it rose \n&gt;  into \n&gt;  &gt;  the air. Then with a smooth twist of hue=\r\n it turned black as \nthe \n&gt;  &gt;  shadows of space enveloped it. Like some bl=\r\nack fog hunter-\n&gt;  &gt;  terminators, or sweeps as some call them, along with =\r\ntheir \nleader \n&gt;  &gt;  Scourge, gathered themselves under the direction of th=\r\ne mighty \n&gt;  &gt;  Cyclonus. Then with lightening swiftness boosters flared \nt=\r\nurning \n&gt;  the \n&gt;  &gt;  surface of the moon crimson for the briefest of momen=\r\nts before \n&gt;  they \n&gt;  &gt;  struck out across open space, moving with precisi=\r\non and ease \n&gt;  toward \n&gt;  &gt;  the unsuspecting inhabitants of the earth. \n&gt;=\r\n  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  Inside the pacifist Maximal base in Atlantis the computers \n&gt;  =\r\ncontinued \n&gt;  &gt;  to monitor the grounds, primarily attempting to keep track=\r\n of \nthe \n&gt;  &gt;  fleeing Trelos. But as always a few cones were pointed \nsky=\r\nward, \n&gt;  &gt;  always on the look out for Minions. What they saw today the \n&gt;=\r\n  computers \n&gt;  &gt;  had no way to understand. Something that was there and y=\r\net not \n&gt;  there. \n&gt;  &gt;  The slightest bit of distortion, that under normal=\r\n \ncircumstances \n&gt;  &gt;  would have been ignored, but in this case was large,=\r\n and worse \n&gt;  yet, \n&gt;  &gt;  it was moving. (OOC: Think of Predator&#39;s invisib=\r\nility when he \n&gt;  moved) \n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  A yellow warning light began to go o=\r\nff in the pacifist command \n&gt;  &gt;  center, as the computer screen automatica=\r\nlly projected course \nand \n&gt;  &gt;  heading. Approximated heading: Atlantis. U=\r\nnfortunately no one \nwas \n&gt;  &gt;  there to notice.\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  On the ground=\r\ns of Atlantis the pursuit of Trelos continues as \n&gt;  several \n&gt;  &gt;  Maximal=\r\ns attempt to retrieve the rather elusive Predacon from \nhis \n&gt;  &gt;  newest h=\r\niding spot, underwater. One boat is on the water \n&gt;  obviously \n&gt;  &gt;  searc=\r\nhing, while a floating car hovers over the waters doing \nits \n&gt;  own \n&gt;  &gt; =\r\n search. Meanwhile Rodimus has noted a rather odd dot in the \n&gt;  skies, \n&gt; =\r\n &gt;  one that he can see to be a Predacon eagle. He is pointing at \nit. \n&gt;  =\r\nAnd \n&gt;  &gt;  even as he is doing this he notes something strange coming \nfrom=\r\n \n&gt;  &gt;  behind the eagle. The sky for a moment seems to flash and \nripple, =\r\n\n&gt;  &gt;  almost like lightning, and yet there is a slight rotation to \nthe \n&gt;=\r\n  &gt;  flashes. \n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  In the skies above the eagle looks down noting =\r\nRodimus \npointing \n&gt;  at \n&gt;  &gt;  him, and he begins to drop out of the skies=\r\n moving out over \nopen \n&gt;  &gt;  water, preparing either to flee, or do a stra=\r\nfing run. In \neither \n&gt;  case \n&gt;  &gt;  he is totally unaware of what is trans=\r\npiring over his head.\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  On the grounds below Rodimus can see wha=\r\nt is coming as his \n&gt;  enhanced \n&gt;  &gt;  vision sees two very tiny dots spira=\r\nling out from the rippling \n&gt;  &gt;  flashes. At the same time Klaxons begin t=\r\no go off as base \n&gt;  computers \n&gt;  &gt;  do actually recognize this threat: MI=\r\nSSILES!\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  Erupting out of the skies, twin missiles streak across=\r\n the \nskies, \n&gt;  &gt;  vortexes of flames spiraling after them like crimson, c=\r\none \nshaped \n&gt;  &gt;  contrails. They slam into communication towers, and the =\r\ntowers \nas \n&gt;  &gt;  well as a few outlying buildings burst into flames. \n&gt;  &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt;  &gt;  In the background, almost unnoticed, a Myrmidon spirals out of \n&gt; =\r\n the \n&gt;  &gt;  skies, the recipient of several laser blasts. Small gouts of \n&gt;=\r\n  flames \n&gt;  &gt;  flowing from him even as he impacts the water. Myrmidon sin=\r\nks \n&gt;  beneath \n&gt;  &gt;  the waves.\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  And flying from amidst this b=\r\nombardment Cyclonus rises high \ninto \n&gt;  the \n&gt;  &gt;  air.\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  &quot;The =\r\ndays you have known are over.
