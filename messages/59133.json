She managed to create a make-shift sensor beam.  It \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; surround the ship, but at only 15 feet away.  It was a foot off \nthe \n&gt; &gt; ground. And it gave a soft hum, but she could barely hear it.  \nWith \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; little luck, she had it run off solar power. The had to use one \nof \n&gt; &gt; her own small power cells to help store energy while the sun was \n&gt; &gt; down.  Her own power levels ran at 75% on a full charge now.  BUt \n&gt; she \n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t worried. So far, she had no clue other bots existed. And \nif \n&gt; no \n&gt; &gt; other creatures were like the spindly legged thing she saw \nearlier, \n&gt; &gt; then she&#39;d be fine.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just on a sheer whim, she opened up her forarm scanners and \n&gt; &gt; radar. &quot;Hmm, wonder if I&#39;ll pick up anything other than \natmospheric \n&gt; &gt; interferrence.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The mayday could not be picked up do to the global \ncommunications \n&gt; &gt; jamm that was currently in effect.

The sky \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; brilliant oranges and reds.  She got up, tansformed into bot \nmode \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; set about making her ship a little more livable.  She found her \n&gt; &gt; small \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tool kit and started working on fixing the emergency power \ncells, \n&gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they were too far damaged.  She did find her distress beacon.  \n&gt; She \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pressed it and hoped someday, someone might find her. It gave \nout \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; general MAYDAY. But no allience signals. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She cleaned up most of the rubble and made a pile of scrap \n&gt; outside \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ship.  Next, she went to the console.  Th best she could \n&gt; manage \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was fixing her chair.  She sat in it and propped her feet up. \nShe \n&gt; &gt; put \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her hands behind her head and leaned back.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, it won&#39;t be so bad here.
