He shuddered, shaking his head\n&gt; lightly and flickering his red eyes after she called him cutey. It felt\n&gt; weird, but he didn&#39;t respond to it strongly.\n&gt;\n&gt; He transformed to his robot mode and walked to the outside of the cave. He\n&gt; leaned against the side of the rock formation. He crossed his arms, and\n&gt; stared out. So this was their base? He really didn&#39;t like this situation.\nHe\n&gt; was going to be on edge too much, maybe that was why he was being so surly\n&gt; to the females. He really didn&#39;t like yelling at them. They were nice\nbots.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked back. Their gang needed a flier.\n&gt;\n&gt; He had a strike of an idea. He knew Rowdy Wolf would know how to help\nthem.\n&gt; He had rather good protection of his own cave in the high mountains.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hey Scorponok, where&#39;s boss-bot?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; &gt;Date: Sun, 25 Jun 2000 18:48:15 -0400\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;*Stingtra smiled at Quickstrike* Stingtra: I don&#39;t need to go out if you\n&gt; &gt;have something for me to help you with, cutey. *Stingtra walks over and\n&gt; &gt;grabs an apple* Stingtra: Want anything to eat?\n&gt; &gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Sunday, June 25, 2000 6:48 PM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstrike felt stupid.
