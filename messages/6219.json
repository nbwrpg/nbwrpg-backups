LIVE!!!!\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m back from my camping trip, everyone. I&#39;ve just read 300 emails \n&gt; while talking to alot of people, so I might be confused on some \n&gt; things. Please forgive me if I am, I&#39;m still burned from camping.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, KSLawdogg has given me controll of all his Maximal and Alliance \n&gt; characters until he returns (if anyone wants, I can forward his \n&gt; email).\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/Nemesis Enforcer/Hiss/Breakdown/Scattershot/Punch::\n&gt; \n&gt; With a flash, Zardus apears in the forest, falling to his knees, \n&gt; panting. He gets up, looking around.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Nemesis,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;What&#39;s the situation?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Hiss grins, taking a step forward.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I think I will!&quot; he snarls at Iron Raptor, walking up to the bars, \n&gt; his gun aimed at her, &quot;You foolish raptor you will never escape and \n&gt; we will destroy your maximal,&quot; he says, not realizing the danger he&#39;s \n&gt; in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hiss, back away. She might get dumb and start biting,&quot; Breakdown \n&gt; orders, the rest of the Oblitercons holding their guns ready.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer looks up as he recieves Zardus&#39; transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The Maximals threatened to attack, Zardus,&quot; he replies, &quot;But we told \n&gt; them that we&#39;ll kill the Maximals if they d-&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The scanner beeps, reporting an object hitting the shields, and \n&gt; interrupting Nemesis. Nemesis looks down at the scanners and swears, \n&gt; then nearly cracks up laughting\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The Maximals threw someone into our shields, Zardus!&quot; he says into \n&gt; his comm-link, &quot;I think their logic circuits are burned!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I see,&quot; Zardus&#39; voice replies, &quot;Try not to kill the females unless \n&gt; necessary, I have use for them. I will go deal with Panzertron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer turns around, deactivating the comm-link. &quot;You heard \n&gt; him!&quot; he says to the Alliance members there, &quot;Scattershot, Punch, get \n&gt; to the brig. Tell Dark One and his gang to get out there and kill \n&gt; someone. You two stay and guard the prisoners.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Punch and Scattershot nod, setting off toward the brig.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Zardus turns around, continuing toward Panzertron&#39;s ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Delta, could you meet me at my location,&quot; he says into his comm-\n&gt; link, &quot;And bring the cloaking device with you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5533/13/_/_/_/963188363/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
