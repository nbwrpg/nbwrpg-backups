He&#39;s probably to lazy to have his characters \ngo willingly :)\n\nSequencer/Sinew/Captain Nemo:\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo skimmers descended rapidly.\n\n&quot;Sinew, we have arrived.  Scanners detecting the subjects.  Shall we proceed?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why do we need them?&quot;\n\n&quot;The President requests more entrees.  And here we are.&quot;\n\n&quot;Great...&quot; Sinew sighed.  The robot powered up its wrist cannons as a hatch \nopened outside of the skimmer.  He leapt out, his boosters activating.  \nSeveral humanoids leapt out of the hatch as well, jetpacks strapped to their \nbacks as they descended rapidly.\n\n&quot;Unit Menasor, prepare ofr extermination!&quot; Sinew yelled down, his wrists \nfiring off a rocket each, two rockets heading down towards Menasor&#39;s chest.\n\nThe several gumby humanoids opened fire, a few had laser rifles, a few had \nmissile launchers.  All the while both skimmers were charging their main \nweapons and locking onto the gestalt.  Two mechanical destablizer shells were \nlaunched at Menasor.  If they struck successfully, they would paralyze \nMenasor for several hours until they were removed.\n\n--------\n\nTwo skimmers flew near the Himalayas, taking a more safer approach.  Both \nskimmers fired off three mechanical destablizer shells, one each heading for \nthe Technobots and one for Cliffjumper.\n\nCaptain Nemo sat at the bridge of one of the skimmers.  &quot;Prepare four teams \nof men to go down and retrieve them.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, Captain.&quot; a sergeant replied, acting on the captain&#39;s orders \nimmediately.\n\n"}}
