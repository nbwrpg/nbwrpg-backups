I want a special project from you... \n&gt; Something like I did once with Optimus Prime, this is the bot... Work\n&gt; quickly...  we&#39;re running our plan&quot;\n&gt;   \n&gt;  &quot;Yes master Hydras&quot; said trought the com link  Perceptor\n&gt;   \n&gt;  &quot;Our objetive is lead Rodimus here and his wife to  Blackfortress\n&gt; once she&#39;s captured&quot;said the male&quot;and in that way that noone  notice\n&gt; it or knows who did it&quot; said the Male\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Lord Jhiaxus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Jhiaxus: Hydras, are you thinking about using a haloimage puppet like\n&gt; Megatron.. err, you once used in the likeness of Optimus Prime? You\n&gt; tried to have the puppet lead the Earth bound Autobots into some\n&gt; distructive crystals, correct? I enjoy history.\n\nMyrmidon just nodded as Jhiaxus and Hydras spoke, keeping his silence\nfor the moment. Purple optics glowed thoughtfully from the darkness\nbeneath his lion helm as he regarded the two predacons before him.\nSilently Myrmidon wondered just how powerful this Rodimus must be to\ncommand such attention and what fool would actually leave his fortress\nundefended to chase a female so foolish as to be caught as they were\nplanning to do. \n\nMyrmidon shook his head as his thoughts took a different turn. &quot;I will\ngo and observe this Atlantis. Then we can  determine what this\ndisturbance is and its signifigance.&quot; Myrmidon glanced at the Atlantis\nimage to get his bearing and then turned to go.\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nCatch up on fall&#39;s hot new shows on Yahoo!
