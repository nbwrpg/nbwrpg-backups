I love you devil and mercyless spark and your cunning \nmind...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She listened, her optics upon him almost like she was in a trance. \nShe was \n&gt; listening. Like she had done so for millions of years; listening \nto orders, \n&gt; waiting upon Megatron, even Galvatron, hand & foot; doing what \never mission \n&gt; they asked of her; doing them without question, even though she \nmay have \n&gt; hesitated on a couple of them, but nonetheless, she did her \nduty... without \n&gt; question. \n&gt; \n&gt; But to finally hear him praise her... she had waited forever it \nseemed for \n&gt; this. It was her goal in life,... to become his favorite warrior, \nto be his \n&gt; second in command. Commanding the Decepticons was not something \nshe strived \n&gt; for, it was a major honor, but... it was to replace Starscream \nthat was her \n&gt; goal. Now... would it be possible? There was no Starscream here... \nor so she \n&gt; thought. Last she saw of him was on Cybertron when Galvatron \nincinerated him, \n&gt; then she heard of his return soon after disappearing into deep \nspace. She \n&gt; knew he was out there, & found him upon a world as a sort of God \nto \n&gt; fleshlings. But.. it had been many years since she had seen \nStarscream. \n&gt; \n&gt; She gazed at Hydras. In a trance, sort of stunned look. The \norganic side of \n&gt; her felt the rush of emotions surging through her. Emotions she \nwas no \n&gt; prepared to experience, let alone experienced at all. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then she smirked, a wicked & dreamy look, &quot;All the better to serve \nyou with, \n&gt; mighty Hydras. I am yours... to command as you see fit.&quot; A daring \nleap of \n&gt; faith. But sometimes one had to dare to test the limits.\n&gt; \n&gt; She realized that she was still clinging to him. Her form against \nhis. She \n&gt; smirked. Dare they part each other&#39;s company? True, that they \ncould devise \n&gt; plots together, but... he did give her a mission. But she would \nwait a little \n&gt; longer before starting that mission. \n&gt; \n&gt; She laughed as a thought approached her. &quot;How coincidental. I do \nbelieve that \n&gt; there is a Earth creature &#39;story&#39; or symbol of something called a \nying & a \n&gt; yang: one is the dragon, the other a tiger. Both were symbols of \ngreat power &\n&gt;  wisdom. If not anything else.&quot; informing him as she held onto \nhim, gazing at \n&gt; him. Fascinated by him. He was the result of what happened when \nMegatron & \n&gt; Galvatron merged. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her paw-hands went to his faceplate, as she touched him upon both \nsides, she \n&gt; had noticed the difference in their color, slightly. Curiousity \nwas what \n&gt; drove her to study him. She wondered if she could touch those \nreminants of \n&gt; both Leaders she once served. As she touched Hydras, her spark \ncalled out to \n&gt; Megatron & Galvatron. Would they answer in return?\n\n\n"}}
