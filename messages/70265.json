Maybe it&#39;s time, ya know? New era, new Prime? You&#39;re it now Tucson P=\r\nrime, you&#39;re gonna be our new hope for a better future. And you&#39;re already =\r\ndon&#39; that. Ohh yeah, you&#39;re gonna be a legend, and I think Rodimus knows it=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime pauses for a moment, and then understands what Night Sh=\r\nift was telling him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I just didn&#39;t think it would happen this soon Ni=\r\nght Shift. You&#39;re right. We&#39;ll all leave together and get everyone back to =\r\nthe Ark.&quot;\n\nAs the Autobots, Maximals and Perceptor begin to make their way =\r\nout\nRodimus nodded, his armor once again that smooth black and polished\nfin=\r\nish of Dark Rodimus, the cold white flames majestically across his\nchest. H=\r\nowever it was amber colored optics that looked up at Cyclonus\nand Jhiaxus a=\r\ns they come down the tunnels toward him.\n\n&quot;Yes, brothers, comrades it is ti=\r\nme to end this.&quot; Rodimus said, his\nvoice sounding strained.\n\nRodimus turned=\r\n as if he were about to fire his weapons at the\nretreating Tuscon and Perce=\r\nptor, but instead sent a spread of rockets\nat the tunnel walls and ceiling!=\r\n\n\nExplosively the walls collapsed, bringing tons of rock down towards\nthe f=\r\nloor, cutting off any chance of attack that Cyclonus and the\nothers may had=\r\n in Tuscon&#39;s direction!\n\nThe last sounds that can be heard from the inside =\r\nis Cyclonus as he\nsaid, &quot;Now, what is . . .&quot; there is a pause and then Cycl=\r\nonus&#39; voice,\n&quot;. . . RUN FLEE NOW!&quot; and then Rodimus&#39; distinct laughter!\n\nA =\r\nmessage comes to Perceptor and Tuscon from Rodimus, &quot;Protect\nNightlight! I =\r\nhave broken my promise to her, but I think she&#39;ll know\nwhy.&quot;\n\nThen the cave=\r\n began to rumble as, on the other side of the newly\nfallen wall of stone an=\r\nd debris, the explosive charge that Perceptor\nhad left finished its count d=\r\nown! The debris rumbled and shook as if\nit were about to erupt with somethi=\r\nng, but then it finally fell\nsilent.\n\nSteam and the unique smell of sulfur =\r\nbegan to fill the air, venting\nfrom the other side of the fallen wall.\n\nMea=\r\nnwhile . . .\n\nWho: LEGACY, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA, Rat Trap, Quickstride,\nLocat=\r\nion: Black Fortress - Hallways\n\n&gt; In another part of the tunnel system, Qui=\r\nck Stride, who was full of determination to get at Deepstryke and the other=\r\n seekers, falls for the lure, as Rat Trap tries desperately to go after him=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wait, I smell a rat, and it&#39;s not me! Don&#39;t fall for it Quickstride=\r\n! IT&#39;S A TRAP! UGHHH THAT STUPID HORSE!&quot;\n\nLegacy continued firing at the sh=\r\nield, his cannon attempting to bring\nit down with a resonance burst!\n\nDeeps=\r\ntryke on the other hand chuckled as he lured Quickstride back to\nan area wh=\r\nere the Black Fortress&#39; autocannons were operative, and then\nhe stopped, as=\r\n the cannons oriented themselves on Quickstride.\n\n&quot;Ahh Maximal, and here is=\r\n where your foray ends.&quot; Deepstryke said\ncoldly as his own cannons come onl=\r\nine. &quot;It&#39;s a shame you fell for this\nso easily.&quot; Deepstryke said as he gloa=\r\nted. &quot;Fir . . . &quot;\n\nEven as he spoke the walls and floor began to shift and =\r\nrumble as\nsomewhere below the Fortress, Perceptor&#39;s explosion went off! The=\r\n\nlights and power to the auto cannons and the shield that Deepstryke\nhad in=\r\n place, separating Quickstride from the others shut off,\nplunging them all =\r\ninto a sudden darkness!\n\n&quot;WHAT?!? NO!&quot; Phobia said in surprise, although wh=\r\nere she was exactly\nin the darkness was difficult to make out.\n\nA cannon bl=\r\nast lanced out at Deepstryke, in this new darkness looking\nlike lightning! =\r\nDeepstryke is knocked backwards as Legacy transmitted\nto Quickstride, &quot;Come=\r\n. It is time to leave this place quickly.&quot;\n\nLegacy&#39;s engines revved as he b=\r\negan to back out and work his way\ntowards the exit, although he kept his ca=\r\nnon oriented in Deepstryke&#39;s\ndirection should he have to defend himself fur=\r\nther. His headlights\ncame on, lighting up the tunnel ahead.\n\nSo far Phobia =\r\nand Blackrazor were no where to be seen, although noise\nfrom Deepstryke cou=\r\nld be heard coming from somewhere in the darkness\nbehind them.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPres=\r\nton\n\n"}}
