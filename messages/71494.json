You&#39;re right, I do need a few more hours in CR.  Quickstride, Legacy \nis your best bet for engineering purposes, he can help you with research, \ndevelopment and construction.  What you&#39;re proposing seems a bit complex, \nand it&#39;s always good to have someone else with you to collaborate with.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nods enthusiastically.\n\n&quot; I was hoping ta have his support actually, well do.  There&#39;s a few things \nI need ta sort out as far as materials.. And of course design and \nfunctionability.  &quot;\n\nTucson smiles gently and then turns to the little green mech.\n\n&quot; I assure you that if you assist us in locating the escaped predicons, you \nwill be granted immunity from enemy forces.&quot;\n\nHe then turns to Leo Prime.\n\n&quot; I have a feeling Hydras may take advantage of the situation and attempt \nanother assault on this parameter.  Be sure our boundaries are well guarded \naround the clock, and have everyone take turns running guard duty.&quot;\n\nHe nods as a signal that things were adjourned for the time being.\n\n&quot; That pretty much covers everything, Leo Prime, thank you.&quot;\n\nHe tries to get up from his seat and stumbles.  Quickstride catches him.\n\n&quot; Whoa, careful sir.  Leo, better call someone for transport to the CR \nchambers, his balance is really messed up.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n\nOn Jul 21, 2011, at 2:14 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson nods in agreement.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Very well Leo Prime.  Quickstride will head the construction of the \n&gt;&gt; wind\n&gt;&gt; and hydro turbines.  Anyone who wishes to be on that team, report to\n&gt;&gt; Quickstride for instruction.   As for Cheetor, I&#39;m afraid he has yet to \n&gt;&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; found.  Nightshift and Rattrap did all they could to search for him, and \n&gt;&gt; I\n&gt;&gt; do believe Nightshift is severely damaged and will need immediate \n&gt;&gt; repairs.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; LEO PRIME nodded, “Quickstride will head that team. Coordinate with\n&gt; Legacy on that as well. He is primarily the Ark’s guardian and has\n&gt; been effecting repairs for some time. His knowledge of science and\n&gt; general engineering seems to be off the charts.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Straight Shot sits up and looks to Leo Prime.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;He&#39;s not listening to me.  Maybe he&#39;ll listen to you.  He&#39;s already \n&gt;&gt; taken\n&gt;&gt; more of his share of hard hits and if he thinks he&#39;s gonna go out there \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; do it all again, he&#39;s flipped a microchip or two. &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson directs his attention over to Straight Shot.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; I know, I know, you have every right to not approve of my actions, but \n&gt;&gt; I\n&gt;&gt; failed this faction once, I will not fail it again.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Straight Shot swallows hard as a tear trickles down her right eye.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; No, what happened back then wasn&#39;t your fault.  None of it was.  Leo \n&gt;&gt; he&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; blaming himself for what happened to Rodimus and the others on himself. \n&gt;&gt; He\n&gt;&gt; thinks that if he had just been a little more careful, he could&#39;ve \n&gt;&gt; prevented\n&gt;&gt; Hydras from winning that battle.  But it wasn&#39;t his fault.  I was in his \n&gt;&gt; cab\n&gt;&gt; with him as an on board scout, looking out for possible ambush.  I saw\n&gt;&gt; someone in the skies far off behind us and I froze because he moved in\n&gt;&gt; really fast.  By the time Cyclonus moved in for the shot, I could barely \n&gt;&gt; say\n&gt;&gt; anything.  I was terrified.  Then that&#39;s when it happened.  I don&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; remember\n&gt;&gt; too much after that but he was not the bot who failed the faction, I was.\n&gt;&gt; And there isn&#39;t a day that goes by without me being reminded of that \n&gt;&gt; costly\n&gt;&gt; error I made out on that battle field.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson moves over to his sister and puts a hand on her shoulder.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; No, that was never your fault.  It was mine.  I should have never asked\n&gt;&gt; you toventure out with me on such a dangerous mission.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He then looks to everyone.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Times are about to get difficult.  In order to win the battle ahead we\n&gt;&gt; have to work together, and we need to remain strong.  We will overcome as \n&gt;&gt; we\n&gt;&gt; have for centuries.  Freedom is the right for all sentient beings.  Now \n&gt;&gt; let\n&gt;&gt; us win it, for this planet, for us and for Primus.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a look from LEO PRIME as he watches the scene unfold. “You do\n&gt; look like you need more time in the CR chamber before you can resume\n&gt; full duty status Tuscon.” LEO said soberly.\n&gt;\n&gt; LORD ELDER, who had just walked into the room nodded as he walked\n&gt; straight up the middle isle. “Yep, Tuscon is known for trying to push\n&gt; himself too hard. If he balks too much, perhaps I can get Santon over\n&gt; there to give him a sedative.” ELDER pointed at the bulky medic who\n&gt; was sitting on the stage.\n&gt;\n&gt; Although LORD ELDER was being a bit facetious SANTON nodded grimly as\n&gt; he looked over at TUSCON, “Yes, rest would be the order of the door.\n&gt; And a few more hours in the CR.”\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson puts an arm around Talon with a playful smile on his face.  It \n&gt;&gt; would\n&gt;&gt; be his only moment of light heartedness.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; You&#39;re absolutely right, Talon but it&#39;s a shame that CR chambers are \n&gt;&gt; only\n&gt;&gt; designed for one individual at a time.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He wispers quietly with a cat like grin on his face.  He then turns to \n&gt;&gt; Leo\n&gt;&gt; Prime, with an attentive nod.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Nightshift and Rattrap were out looking for Cheetor together but, an\n&gt;&gt; unknown insectile force attacked them and in an effort to elude them,\n&gt;&gt; Nightshift spun out and collided with something in the forest which \n&gt;&gt; caused\n&gt;&gt; extensive damage.  He should be in med bay now.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rattrap takes his seat.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late Wheels, I had ta help Ramulus get Nightshift inta the med\n&gt;&gt; bay.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;That&#39;s all right, I understand.  Now as far as the escaped enemy forces,\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;d like to send Silverbolt with Kup to the ship&#39;s parameter to see if \n&gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; pick up on their signatures.  Once they&#39;ve determined the path of the\n&gt;&gt; escaped predicons, I&#39;d like a full report and please, try not to take \n&gt;&gt; them\n&gt;&gt; on your own.  Call for backup the minute you find them.  I worry about \n&gt;&gt; all\n&gt;&gt; of you, and if Anything ever happened to anyone of you, I&#39;d never forgive\n&gt;&gt; myself.  &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He sighs.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; No one has the right to control what isn&#39;t theirs to govern.  Freedom \n&gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; the right of all sentient beings and the right of creatures who were born\n&gt;&gt; Naturally to this planet.  Leo Prime, I vote we take care of the \n&gt;&gt; perpetrator\n&gt;&gt; together.  He seems to need a taste of his own medicine.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; LEO PRIME nodded again, “And perhaps this mech here.” He pointed to\n&gt; the green mech that had the predacon IFF signal, “Could help you with\n&gt; locating the ship and finding survivors.”\n&gt;\n&gt; Looking back at TUSCON and then LORD ELDER as well as a few others LEO\n&gt; intoned. “Does anyone have anything else to add before I dismiss the\n&gt; meeting?”\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
