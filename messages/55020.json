I have been \n&gt; &gt; Galvatron&#39;s loyal bot since he was created by unicron. I was created by \n&gt; &gt; Unicron to serve him and will till my spark stops pulsating. I have gone \n&gt; &gt; through great evolutions and now I am ready to help him bring back the \n&gt; &gt; glory \n&gt; &gt; of the decepticons, and with Prime back....its going to be that much \n&gt; &gt; sweeter. \n&gt; &gt; Satisfied?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Quite,&quot; she stated dryly. But.. she was all the more truly satisfied. \n&gt; \n&gt; As she moved towards the Bridge. &quot;So.. you served Galvatron?&quot; her distaste \n&gt; was slightly apparent. But she was even more curious about this Decepticon. \n&gt; &quot;Do forgive me, as I do not know you well enough. Though... it does bring me \n&gt; &#39;joy&#39; to know that another Decepticon is within my presence.&quot; continuing in \n&gt; her deep & sophisticated femme voice. Her claws clasped behind her as she \n&gt; strode along talking to Carnation. \n\n"}}
