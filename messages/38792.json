We could have problems if \nya still blow the bombs in 5 cycles...\n\nStarstomp:\nRoger that...\nAnd shut yer scrappin&#39; exhaust! If you dare to call me babe one more time, \nI&#39;ll blast you back to Cybertron!\n\nThe lady bot was tired of Electrod&#39;s constant and annoying tries at picking \nher up. But the frequency problem worried her. In the Jupiterian asteroid \nbelt, there were not much outside sources that could interfere with the comm \nsystem of the Sledgehammer mining base.\nBut what could she do about it? The charges were in place and if they blew, \nshe probably would have no damage at all, as deep as they were.\n\nStarstomp:\nControl, this is Pounder3, charges are in and ready to blow.\n\nThen, they blew... And harder than they were supposed...\n\nElectrod:\nAll units!! We are under attack! There&#39;s a Pred destroyer comin&#39; right above \nus!!\n\nStarstomp:\nSlag it!! That last blast... it detached the whole spinward portion of the \nbase!!\n\nThe un-blown part of the base was starting to derive...\nBut then, some unknown force came in...\n\n(Vok 1):\nCommence time-space warp...\n\nThe base vanished and reappeared crashing down in the plains at the feet of \nthe Rockies of Earth&#39;s future north America.\n\nStarstomp:\nControl, do you read?\n\nThere were no answers, because the only parts of the base that had not \ndisintegrated were the section were she stood and the cr and DNA scanning \nchambers...\nThe crash was hard, but she made it. A crater was created. She crawled to \nthe chamber, not knowing were she was or even how she had gotten there. What \nshe did know is that she was almost in stasis lock and that she needed to \nget a beast mode installed.\n\nStarstomp:\nInitiate DNA scanning, long-range... Contact the nearest technological \nfacility, if any, with a peace and urgent help request. (This means the \nChivtrons)\n\nThe computer soon found a beast mode, and the female robot embarked the CR \nchamber (or at least what could be left of it) and was fixed with her new \nbeast mode. But there was a glitch. The remaining ateroid debries interfered \nwith the DNA scanner. The result was a strange looking buffalo, seeming it \nhad been carved out of a stone block.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
