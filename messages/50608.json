To him, it was like\n&gt; wasting words that \n&gt; could be best kept. It was alien to him to be called\n&gt; so familiarly. He \n&gt; did not feel comfortable with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned back to the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vlad: WHAT SAY YOU WARRIORS?

He thought of his options. He could\n&gt; start firing, but he \n&gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not decided which group was the best to go with.\n&gt; Those Rogues were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; greater in number, but that did not prove\n&gt; anything. Ice Hellion \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Warriors were many, and their prowess in combat\n&gt; did not reflect \n&gt; &gt; this. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Tripredacus, on the other hand, seemed less\n&gt; organized, even \n&gt; &gt; though \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they seemed better armed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; His declaration of being the object of the trial\n&gt; of possession \n&gt; &gt; might \n&gt; &gt; &gt; motivate them, but he harbored no illusions. He\n&gt; was a human, \n&gt; &gt; unknown \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to these machines. He had not proven himself,\n&gt; but was confident he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could be of some use.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then, there was this female robot. He did not\n&gt; know who she was or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which team she was in, but it seemed as though\n&gt; she had a clear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mission, maybe even unknown to her. There had to\n&gt; be a way he could \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bring her with him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In all these options, running was not present.\n&gt; It was the cowards \n&gt; &gt; way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out, and Wolf Warriors were not cowards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or... yes...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He fired his two missile racks in the air and\n&gt; forty tiny \n&gt; explosions \n&gt; &gt; &gt; peppered the sky. He intended to make a show.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vlad: I AM KHAN VLADIMIR WARD OF CLAN WOLF. I DO\n&gt; NOT KNOW WHO YOU \n&gt; &gt; ARE, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BUT I RECOGNIZE YOUR VALUE AS WARRIORS. I\n&gt; SUGGEST A TEMPORARY \n&gt; &gt; &gt; CEASE-FIRE SO WE MAY DISCUSS BETTER AMONG\n&gt; EQUALS.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He knew the chances that the enemies see\n&gt; themselves as equals were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; slim, but it was worth trying.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nHotJobs - Search Thousands of New Jobs\nhttp://www.hotjobs.com\n\n"}}
