He soon figures out\n&gt; that sonar was not going to work, nor was his radio communication device.\n&gt; He hoped that the others knew Morse Code, and begins to tap audibly on a\n&gt; stalagmite, with one claw, just enough to make sound, but no damage.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the code, he types.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Radio and sonar communication is useless now.  Looks like we&#39;ll have to\n&gt; resort to more primative measures.  Don&#39;t worry Big Convoy, I&#39;m not going to\n&gt; bite off more than I can chew.  If anything, I&#39;m taking my time and doing\n&gt; this carefully.  Patience is something I learned from my master.  Sometimes\n&gt; things can not be done too quickly, and must be done over a lapse of time.\n&gt; And sometimes it&#39;s best to make little disturbance and to keep things as\n&gt; they are found.   That&#39;s what we need to do.  I&#39;ll try my best not to break\n&gt; anything, &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As he walks on, the tip of his wing catches a sharp edge of a rock, and\n&gt; tears slightly.  He grunts in pain.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I should&#39;ve been more careful.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nActually BIG CONVOY is not far behind TUSCON as he stopped. TUSCON is\nfar enough ahead to be running point, but with communications being\ndown CONVOY had come to the conclusion - if TUSCON got too far ahead,\nhis value as a scout would be gone since they couldn&#39;t communicate.\n\nAs TUSCON grunted CONVOY was just coming around the corner behind him\nand waved him on.\n\nMeanwhile TUSCON could just barely pick up what sounded like voices,\nor at least a voice. It was too low to make out what was being said\nexcept for a short parts.\n\n&quot;inform . . . . .  what we&#39;ve found and . . . . . We&#39;re going to keep\non . . . . .&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
