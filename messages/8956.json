I&#39;m not here to make \ntrouble.  I gave my weapons to Chordate, I promised I&#39;d be no trouble \nor try to cause any.&quot;  She stopped and put her hands on her \nhips. &quot;You know,if I was going to do something, don&#39;t you think I&#39;d \nhave done it by now.  I have walked up and down most of this ship.  \nI&#39;ve had ample oppertunity and time to do anything.  I could have \nescaped long before now.  But I haven&#39;t done anything, I haven&#39;t run \naway, and to top that, I came here of my own free will to try to talk \nabout a truce and hopefully a long standing peace treaty.&quot;  She shook \nher head.\n&quot;You know, there has been so much hatred between our factions that \nneither group will even try to make peace.  There is so much hate and \nanger and pain that neither one will look past that ans even try to \ntalk about peace between us.&quot;  She put her hands down and stormed \npast him muttering about how this is going to be a long and hard \nassignment.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Rex::\n&gt; \n&gt; Rex starts to walk after Battera. &quot;I&#39;ll escort you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He walks after the femm, keeping his gun down.
