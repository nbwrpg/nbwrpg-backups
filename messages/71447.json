I saw something th=\r\nere that I want to investigate, a possible location for a portable wind pow=\r\nered energy turbine. &quot;\n\nUproar looks to Quickstride and Windlord. He was ve=\r\nry much interested in the concept of generating clean and efficient power, =\r\nwithout harming the environment.\n\n&quot; Hey I&#39;m all for that if ya need help, g=\r\nuys. Wait a sec...  Quickstride, that idea of yours, do you realize how muc=\r\nh power that turbine is gonna give us once you get it up and running?  Enou=\r\ngh ta create a sizable shield and weapon system for the Ark...  Dude, that&#39;=\r\ns huge!  That&#39;s something the Preds don&#39;t have!  Go on, tell Leo Prime, man=\r\n if that turbine project is a go, like Rodimus said it is, imagine how many=\r\n lives you&#39;re gonna save.&quot;\n\nHe nudges his equine friend with a gentile paw.=\r\n  Quickstride nods and transforms into robot mode.  Usually a very modest f=\r\nellow, he walks up to Leo Prime, with a holographic image of a wind turbine=\r\n, completely portable, resting. In a recessed rockface of a near by cave, e=\r\ntched in a very tall mountain which is surrounded by dense forest land appe=\r\naring untouched as the turbine powers itself with wind and uses a hydro tur=\r\nbine system as backup.\n\n&quot; Leo Prime, Sir, if I could I have something to sh=\r\now you, that could very well enable us to protect the parameter, environmen=\r\nt, wildlife, and  Natural habitats that have established themselves here.  =\r\nAll we need are the energy resources to pull it off.  I think I have someth=\r\ning here that will enable us to do it all.  It&#39;s a turbine that runs on win=\r\nd with an extension that runs on water as a backup power source when there =\r\nisn&#39;t any wind being generated.  Best part is, it&#39;s completely portable and=\r\n designed for quick disassembly so we can leave the planet as we find it, c=\r\nompletely untouched.&quot;\n\nHe shows Leo Prime a simulation of the workings of h=\r\nis invention.\n\nTucson Prime arrives with Talon, just in time to hear the pr=\r\noposed idea by Quickstride.\n\n&quot; A power source running only on wind and hydr=\r\no electricity.  Simple, yet natural, without harming the ecological balance=\r\n of this planet.  And did I hear you correctly, Quickstride?  Could that tu=\r\nrbine give us enough power to protect and supply our reserves with enough n=\r\natural energy to fend off our enemies sufficiently? &quot; \n\nQuickstride grins m=\r\nodestly.\n\n&quot; Well there is a lot of testing that&#39;ll have ta be done, but if =\r\nit works like I hope it&#39;ll work, it could, yeah definitely, it would give u=\r\ns the home team advantage.  But as I show it in this simulation, location i=\r\ns everything.  I know where I need to position this system and all I need i=\r\ns some help to transport and assemble the turbine system.  I made sure to d=\r\nesign it with light, but sturdy materials, just in case.&quot;\n\nTucson nods and =\r\nturns to Leo Prime.  \n\n&quot; I think this is something we should strongly consi=\r\nder.  When Rodimus and the others get here, we&#39;ll resume the meeting as you=\r\n intended to,  Leo Prime.  Quickstride, what you have here is something hig=\r\nhly valuable.  Why didn&#39;t you propose this earlier?&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks to =\r\nTucson modestly.\n\nWell, I didn&#39;t wanna interrupt Leo Prime or any of you gu=\r\nys.. &quot;\n\nTucson shuffles Quickstride up front where all the leaders sit duri=\r\nng important meetings.  Uproar gives his buddy a thumbs up.\n\n&quot; Way ta go Qu=\r\nickstride.  You&#39;re part of the house now.&quot;\n\nTucson gives Quickstride his se=\r\nat.\n\n&quot; Now as soon as Rodimus and the rest of the team gets here, I want th=\r\nem to see and hear your proposal for the turbine system you&#39;re designing.  =\r\nAnd please, don&#39;t be shy.  You have something Hydas doesn&#39;t have, a perpetu=\r\nal and natural energy resource, plus the means to access it in a harmless m=\r\nanner.
