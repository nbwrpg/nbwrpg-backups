Triggerhappy tries to turn around, but is\nhit by Chromedome&#39;s shots, and now he is badly damaged.\n\n          &quot;And I thought Autobots were bad, these Maximals are like giant\nbumblebees with an extralarge stinger!&quot; He said to himself.\n\n           Triggerhappy is starting to go down, his engines had been a\nlittle damaged as well.  Triggerhappy didn&#39;t have the logic to retreat, and\nso he turned around and began firing his photon blasters at Prowl.  This\nProwl was bugging him, Prowl was very fast, and had a sleek body.\nTriggerhappy would strike him down if it was the last thing he did in this\nbattle.  Of course, Triggerhappy didn&#39;t have to fight alone.  He shouted\ndown to Motormaster and the others, trying to make himself clear over his\nengines.  The ash started to get to him and his optics too.\n\n          &quot;Hey guys!

He went to her side.\n\n          &quot;It&#39;s been a while since I last engaged in combat.
