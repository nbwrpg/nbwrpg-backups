Despite =\r\nhis massive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appearance, he managed to stay hidden most of the tim=\r\ne. He was\n&gt; &gt; vaguely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; known, asa rumor in the hoodlums of the cit=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Little by little, he approached Silver Wings through=\r\nout the\n&gt; city.

They had be=\r\nen ravaged by the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uprising the Iron Skulls had lead and viewed Jo=\r\ntunn&#39;s demotion\n&gt; as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; candy punishment. The perpetrators, the so=\r\nldiers themselves, had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; barely been chastised for that, and resent=\r\nment was strong\n&gt; because of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this inaction among the surviving po=\r\npulation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He agreed with them, and told them they shoul=\r\nd get even in one\n&gt; &gt; way or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another. Like a prophet, people took=\r\n him to heart and remembered\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was hope for the wounded=\r\n, the hope of recovery and\n&gt; vengeance.

Deadfur\n&gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nike that. They&#39;d lost contacts there, and he&#39;d decided to\nstay to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n help rebuilding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When an agent told him someone looking=\r\n like the missing Sergeant\n&gt; &gt; Ultra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Magnus was talking of gettin=\r\ng back at the Iron Skulls in the\n&gt; &gt; people&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; area, that worried =\r\nhim. But, he didn&#39;t want to take decisions on\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself.
