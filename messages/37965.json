As it ends she smirks and turns to her \nown gestalt team.\n\nFrostbite: &quot;You two, prepare we are going to show these Cybertronians \nhow to do things. Hellpeon shall enter the individual tournament and \neliminate all competition.&quot;\n\nTHe two archon beings nod and look up as a hologrphic image appears \nabove them. Frostbite then taps a button causing an extremely strong \ntransmission to be sent to the IGL tournament area or whatever.\n\nFrostbite: &quot;This is commander Frostbite of the Infecticon team \ncurrently on this planet. We would like to participate in this event. \nWe shall send our strongest warrior and our gestalt team to the \nlocation of your message to prepare, if this is ok with you. Anyways.&quot;\n\nElsewhere at the Trainer base that should be exploding and taking out \neverthing within 50 miles by now from what Cyber said... The Energy \ncolumn dissapates and Hellpeon hovers out of its epicenter and above \nthe base. Soon afterward he recieves a Telepathic message from \nFrostbite and Nods. He then speeds off towards the IGL ship. Hellpeon \nwas lucky this time seeing as how he would need alot of time to \nrecooperate from releasing that amount of energy. However before he \ndissapears into the distance, he sends a telepathic message to \nDarkfate.\n\nHellpeon: &quot;Go to sector 44-26-C... Now. You will speak with my leader \nthere.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; President Kaiser:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From atop the exact center of the mighty IGL craft, several \nantennaes \n&gt; extending, three orbs blasting off from what looked like three \ncannons on \n&gt; other sides, quickly ascending until they were in Earth&#39;s orbit, \nthe orbs \n&gt; transforming into satellites.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the powerful antennaes and positioning of the satellites the \nIGL would \n&gt; be able to communicate with all the major bases rather well and \nthey would \n&gt; even be able to get their transmission through jamming systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Depending on the type of base and its equipment, either an audio or \naudio and \n&gt; picture message would appear.  Most likely the audio and view of \nthe \n&gt; President speaking.  The message consisted of:\n&gt; \n&gt; A slightly menacing robot who was thirteen feet tall, though it was \nhard to \n&gt; tell with him sitting in a large black luxurious chair.  His body \nwas a \n&gt; comfortable mix of red and gold.  On primarily red colored chest \nthere was a \n&gt; golden symbol of the IGL, a sword with a shield behind it.  His \nblue optic \n&gt; sensors brightened as he first spoke.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Congratulations, Cybertronians and any other beings,&quot; Kaiser \nbegan, his \n&gt; voice very deep, &quot;I am President Kaiser of the IGL, the \nIntergalactic \n&gt; Gladiatorial League.  Now I know you are all busy plotting and \nscheming \n&gt; futily to defeat your opponents but believe me, this is a very \nimportant \n&gt; message that could thrust the balance of power into your favor.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The IGL holds matches year long, but only once every year do they \nhold the \n&gt; Intergalactic Gladiatorial League Combat Championships.  We were \nhoping that \n&gt; some if not almost all of you Cybertronians would participate in \nthis.  There \n&gt; will be two divisions.  The Regular, and the Gestalt.  The regular \nwill \n&gt; consist of normal combatants with numerous one on one battles until \nthere is \n&gt; a final one on one battle to determine the IGL Champion of the \nRegular \n&gt; League.  The victor will receive five protoforms and equipment to \nmake mold \n&gt; them into anything they desire, including a gestalt team.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No doubt that would help any faction begin rising to power.  And \nfor the \n&gt; Gestalt League, all gestalt teams may fight one one, as in one \ngestalt team \n&gt; against the other.  These &#39;one&#39; on &#39;one&#39; matches will continue \nuntil there \n&gt; are only two teams left and the victor of that final bout will be \nIGL \n&gt; Champions of the Gestalt League.  They will receive armor \nmodifications, 200 \n&gt; kilos of liquid energon, and if they fight well enough a protoform \nand \n&gt; equipment for them to do with as they wish.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Normally the bouts are not fights to the deaths, but upon request \nand \n&gt; agreement from the combatants this kind of match can occur (if you \nhave any \n&gt; spare chars. you need to kill off, hint, hint).  A faction may \nenter as many \n&gt; warriors into each league as wanted.  In example, one faction could \nenter \n&gt; twenty-five robots into a league.  Or if they had four gestalt \nteams, they \n&gt; could enter them into the league.  Although, they would have to \nfight each \n&gt; other as if they were enemies.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Our craft, the Otyebis, is a mighty ship and assassination is not \nsomething \n&gt; to worry about.  If we wanted you dead, it would&#39;ve been much \neasier to \n&gt; simply bombard you from orbit with our grealty superior weapons, or \noverrun \n&gt; you with our many garrisons of assorted beings.  But that&#39;s not we \nwill do.  \n&gt; There is a zero tolerance for fighting outside of the arenas.  We \nwill not \n&gt; allow your petty differences to interfere with our show.  Anyone \nwho attacks \n&gt; our craft will be obliterated.  If a target of an enemy faction is \nin a \n&gt; middle of a match and his enemies attempt to interfere, we will \ncrush them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A smile crept up on the lips of the non-Cybertronian robot.  &quot;You \ncan \n&gt; register into the IGL by simply sending transmissions to our ship, \nwe have \n&gt; the resouces to deal with constant messages.  You have (two IRL \nweeks) to \n&gt; register.  Feel free to ask any questions (send &#39;em to \nKSLawDogg@c...) when \n&gt; you send your transmissions.  This message will replay for 48 hours \nin case \n&gt; anyone misses this message.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The IGL President was replaced by the golden IGL symbol with a \nbackground of \n&gt; red.\n&gt; \n&gt; (If you have any questions, e-mail me.  This isn&#39;t a trick to crush \npeople, \n&gt; Yan won&#39;t allow it.  Just something I thought of to add a little \nspice to the \n&gt; attack, retreat, attack theme that seems to be going on in the \nRPG.  Since \n&gt; Yanshosh and I have characters in the IGL command, we are not \nallowed to win \n&gt; because it would seem unfair.  The way the winner will be decided \nis as if it \n&gt; were a real battle.  Whoever&#39;s character(s) give first lose.  There \nwill be \n&gt; no complete retreats, though in some matches there will be \ndifferent \n&gt; terrians, such as forest, etc, for people to run and try and hide \nin if \n&gt; things get dicy)\n\n\n"}}
