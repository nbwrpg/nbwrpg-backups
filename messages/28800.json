It crashed through stray \nrocks and \n&gt; pecies of metal as it flew past the previous site of the Ark battle \nand hit \n&gt; the Earth&#39;s atmosphere at a fantastic speed. It&#39;s rate didn&#39;t slow, \nbut in \n&gt; fact increased until it was nothing more than a burning blur in the \nsky. The \n&gt; pod would have quickly overheated if it had not broken through the \n&gt; atmosphere and foud it&#39;s way to a great body of water. It crashed \nand sank \n&gt; nearly to the bottom before its flotation device activated and it \nbegan to \n&gt; resurface.\n&gt; \n&gt; The pod bobbed on the surface of the rippling water, the DNA scan \nactive but \n&gt; finding nothing suitable. Then a small creature cried out as it \ndove toward \n&gt; the pod. THe blue bird quickly realized that the new addition to \nits habitat \n&gt; was not eadible, and pulled up as it flew out of site. That was \nenough, \n&gt; however, to provide the &#39;bot within the pod a form.\n&gt; \n&gt; The pod opened with a lou HISS as the bot within sat up and \nstretched. She \n&gt; took a moment to realize where she was before turning to gaze at \nthe large \n&gt; base beside her.(The Iron Fist)She then turned her attention to her \n&gt; reflection in the  now still water:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now this, I can live with.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Swyft smiled as she continued to admire herself in the glassy water.\n&gt; \n&gt; (See the characters page for Swyft&#39;s stats)\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
