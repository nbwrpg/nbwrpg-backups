It was what he hoped to hear. Deep down=\r\n he was hoping that somewhere along the line someone like Nightstrike could=\r\n turn over a new leaf. She was proof of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Talon, I&#39;m actually =\r\nhappy you told me this. It actually assures me that my intentions aren&#39;t as=\r\n crazy as I thought they may seem. Remember when we were fighting Nightstri=\r\nke? How skilled he appeared to be? He gave us a run for our money, mainly m=\r\ne, but there was sheer talent in his approach, sheer talent that would not =\r\nhave been at all recognized if I hadn&#39;t encountered him. I don&#39;t think Unic=\r\nron would have ever appreciated him for that, instead, he uses him as a pup=\r\npet to do his dirty work, not at all giving him recognition for his efforts=\r\n. And what does he do when they fail? Disposes of them. But what if someone=\r\n else, who he thought was an enemy, actually turned out to be a friend? You=\r\n&#39;ve proven that it can happen, see? It doesn&#39;t change how I feel about you.=\r\n So, this time, I&#39;d like to try a different approach with Nightstrike. I&#39;d =\r\nlike you to be with me as well as Depthcharge and the others, because I wan=\r\nt them to see the same thing. If we show compassion to those who are otherw=\r\nise cast asside, because they aren&#39;t good enough, we can make friends out o=\r\nf enemies. Okay, let&#39;s go see if this works. It might not.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He esc=\r\norts Talon outside, holding her hand.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Okay guys, sorry about that=\r\n.. I had a slow leak in two tires and I had a heck of a time finding spares=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Thought so. Kinda is hard ta find tir=\r\nes for a big guy like you.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson now looks to the others as he =\r\nalso transmits to Lord Elder.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; First, I&#39;m also transmitting to Lo=\r\nrd Elder and Kup, and guys, sorry about earlier, I didn&#39;t mean to scare you=\r\n. Okay, everyone, this is what I hope to accomplish.. Nightstrike may be a =\r\nminion, but Unicron doesn&#39;t value his minions like we value each other. I d=\r\noubt he&#39;s ever been shown appreciation for his talents and abilities. And I=\r\n have a feeling he&#39;s been given false promises. I&#39;d like to try and talk to=\r\n him, on a neutral basis, because even though he doesn&#39;t work for Hydras, h=\r\ne may just have some understanding about Predacon technology that may come =\r\nin handy if Night Shift isn&#39;t able to get the information on his end, due t=\r\no the level of risk he&#39;s taking. I don&#39;t want him to go over his head on so=\r\nmething. If he needs to abandon the mission, please, inform him that I have=\r\n nothing against it. In fact, I hope he realizes when it does become too da=\r\nngerous to pull out. So this way, if he can&#39;t get it, at least I might have=\r\n a chance to get it on my end. I&#39;m begining to think that maybe I may have =\r\nto resort to plan B after all.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap swallows.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; So, =\r\nNight Shift might not make it?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson shakes his head.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nI highly doubt it. It was a very risky proposition and I don&#39;t know why I e=\r\nven let him do it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap salutes Tucson Prime.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Tucs=\r\non Prime, I hereby volunteer my little rat aft ta a call of dangerous rescu=\r\ne duty.

You a=\r\nlmost lost your life back there, I can&#39;t have that hang over my head, absol=\r\nutely not. We&#39;ll see how it plays out. He may be able to get out of there, =\r\nbut if he puts in a distress call, I&#39;ll assemble a rescue team for the job.=\r\n All right, let&#39;s do this.
