Red like the landscape it flew from, it rose \ninto \n&gt; the a=\r\nir. Then with a smooth twist of hue it turned black as the \n&gt; shadows of sp=\r\nace enveloped it. Like some black fog hunter-\n&gt; terminators, or sweeps as s=\r\nome call them, along with their leader \n&gt; Scourge, gathered themselves unde=\r\nr the direction of the mighty \n&gt; Cyclonus. Then with lightening swiftness b=\r\noosters flared turning \nthe \n&gt; surface of the moon crimson for the briefest=\r\n of moments before \nthey \n&gt; struck out across open space, moving with preci=\r\nsion and ease \ntoward \n&gt; the unsuspecting inhabitants of the earth. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the pacifist Maximal base in Atlantis the computers \ncontinued =\r\n\n&gt; to monitor the grounds, primarily attempting to keep track of the \n&gt; fle=\r\neing Trelos. But as always a few cones were pointed skyward, \n&gt; always on t=\r\nhe look out for Minions. What they saw today the \ncomputers \n&gt; had no way t=\r\no understand. Something that was there and yet not \nthere. \n&gt; The slightest=\r\n bit of distortion, that under normal circumstances \n&gt; would have been igno=\r\nred, but in this case was large, and worse \nyet, \n&gt; it was moving. (OOC: Th=\r\nink of Predator&#39;s invisibility when he \nmoved) \n&gt; \n&gt; A yellow warning light=\r\n began to go off in the pacifist command \n&gt; center, as the computer screen =\r\nautomatically projected course and \n&gt; heading. Approximated heading: Atlant=\r\nis. Unfortunately no one was \n&gt; there to notice.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; On the grounds=\r\n of Atlantis the pursuit of Trelos continues as \nseveral \n&gt; Maximals attemp=\r\nt to retrieve the rather elusive Predacon from his \n&gt; newest hiding spot, u=\r\nnderwater. One boat is on the water obviously \n&gt; searching, while a floatin=\r\ng car hovers over the waters doing its \nown \n&gt; search. Meanwhile Rodimus ha=\r\ns noted a rather odd dot in the skies, \n&gt; one that he can see to be a Preda=\r\ncon eagle. He is pointing at it. \nAnd \n&gt; even as he is doing this he notes =\r\nsomething strange coming from \n&gt; behind the eagle. The sky for a moment see=\r\nms to flash and ripple, \n&gt; almost like lightning, and yet there is a slight=\r\n rotation to the \n&gt; flashes. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In the skies above the eagle looks=\r\n down noting Rodimus pointing at \n&gt; him, and he begins to drop out of the s=\r\nkies moving out over open \n&gt; water, preparing either to flee, or do a straf=\r\ning run. In either \ncase \n&gt; he is totally unaware of what is transpiring ov=\r\ner his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On the grounds below Rodimus can see what is coming=\r\n as his \nenhanced \n&gt; vision sees two very tiny dots spiraling out from the =\r\nrippling \n&gt; flashes. At the same time Klaxons begin to go off as base \ncomp=\r\nuters \n&gt; do actually recognize this threat: MISSILES!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Erupting o=\r\nut of the skies, twin missiles streak across the skies, \n&gt; vortexes of flam=\r\nes spiraling after them like crimson, cone shaped \n&gt; contrails. They slam i=\r\nnto communication towers, and the towers as \n&gt; well as a few outlying build=\r\nings burst into flames. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the background, almost unnoticed, a Myrmid=\r\non spirals out of the \n&gt; skies, the recipient of several laser blasts. Smal=\r\nl gouts of \nflames \n&gt; flowing from him even as he impacts the water. Myrmid=\r\non sinks \nbeneath \n&gt; the waves.\n&gt; \n&gt; And flying from amidst this bombardmen=\r\nt Cyclonus rises high into \nthe \n&gt; air.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The days you have known are o=\r\nver. All that you have belongs to \nus! \n&gt; Resist and be destroyed!! THE MIN=\r\nIONS OF UNICRON HAVE COME!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even Cyclonus spoke sweeps arrive seeming =\r\nto almost darken the \nskies \n&gt; for a momsnt, disintegrator blasts providing=\r\n bright flashes of \nlight \n&gt; as they bath Atlantis and the Maximal base in =\r\nwar.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I=\r\n am sure other Maximal and Predacon bases/HQ&#39;s will note \n&gt; something simil=\r\nar to what the Maximal base in Atlantis noted, feel \n&gt; free for anyone to j=\r\nump in, if it makes sense. \n&gt; \n&gt; The only thing of note is that the Sweeps =\r\nand Scourge cannot be \n&gt; locked on to with sensors (check out their profile=\r\ns on wiki). That \n&gt; should not affect most of you very much, since most of =\r\nyou shoot \nby \n&gt; sight anyways, unless you are using base sensors or some r=\r\nemote \n&gt; sensing capability. \n&gt; \n&gt; Also any Minions that chose to come with=\r\n are in this group as well.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
