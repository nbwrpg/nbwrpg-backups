(I know I&#39;m modeing by\nmaking suggestions ooc and I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m in no hurry to see those two\ndie just yet.)\n\nNow back to the action\n\nLunarpine&#39;s next view is a light flashing before him, he could feel a\ncomfortable warmth there. All around him he could see visions of warriors,\nMaximals Predacons, And a few symbols he didn&#39;t recognize. He&#39;d heard bots\nspeak of this place before when they were brought back from beyond, he\nsomehow knew where he was he just didn&#39;t know how he got there or why he was\nhere.\n\nLunarpine thought his punishment for his failures would surely be the pit,\nand the clincher would be his failure to save Shadow Wing. Now he knew he\nwas to late. Now he knew that he&#39;d cost himself his own life for a worthless\ngesture.\n\nHe sensed somehow that every bot around him knew his thoughts, his fears,\nhis emotions. Somehow he could sense thiers too. warriors of the highest\nquality, sciencebots destroyed before thier greatest achievements could be\ncreated, Predacons who fought valiantly to save lives instead of extinguish\nthem.\n\nA ball of light approached him and took shape a youthfull bot, an image that\ndidn&#39;t seem to belong here was now before him. Lunarpine opened his mouth to\nspeak but quickly learned it wasn&#39;t necessary.\n\nThe new bots voice consumed him &quot;I was Piston of a group from the last great\nwar, I was a new recruit for a unit called the Misfits of Cyberton I have\nbeen selected for your adjustment.&quot;\n\nLunarpine,s confusion was the normal response for a bot struck down\nunexpectadely. The voices seemed to laugh. again he attempted to communicate\nthis time with his thoughts. &quot;How&#39;d I get here? and why are you adjusting\nme?(Please this is a spiritual moment avoid any lewd comments.)\n\nPiston glanced back &quot;I&#39;m the rogue of the group, the young stubborn one. I\ndied in a battle with a technowizzard in the swamps of paradrose. My\nadjustor was a rogue too, are you sensing a pattern?&quot;\n\n(I&#39;ll continue in another post shortly so you people don&#39;t get eye strain\nreading this.)\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, August 17, 2000 3:23 PM\nSubject: Re: Don&#39;t die yet Wing!!!!\n\n\n&gt; If no one object, and this is subject to change, but is it OK if\n&gt; Lunarpine takes her spark out and keeps it in his body in a\n&gt; compartment or something and have it conneccted to his power supply?\n&gt; I can&#39;t post for her while she is in this state, but he can buildher\n&gt; a new body in time, This is just an ida so let me know.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Logo Morph, under normal circumstances I would say to let her die,\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ve lost too many characters already, don&#39;t let Shadow Wing\n&gt; die!...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
