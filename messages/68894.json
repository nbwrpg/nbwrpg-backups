Using their agility and speed they turned \nin \n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; air, spinning as the weapons continued to pepper the skies with \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; bullets and energy!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy for his part pulled back, using=\r\n the Ark as an additional \n&gt; &gt; &gt; defence as he laid into the oncoming sweep=\r\ns. Much like Lord \n&gt; Elder&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attack, it was effective but the sweep =\r\ndisperesed, leaving him \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pick one or two out of the air at a time=\r\n rather then destroying \n&gt; &gt; many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; at a time. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Jhiaxu=\r\ns and Scorponok, Grimlock and Hydras and Rodimus all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; approached from=\r\n their different vectors, they could all see the \n&gt; &gt; grim \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vista of =\r\nthe sweeps, and the number of them was staggering. At \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; center =\r\nof all this Cyclonus floated a cold calm amidst the \nstorm \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; swe=\r\neps that floated around him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To those who had been at the bat=\r\ntle above Atlantis the sight \n&gt; &gt; brought \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a darker reality: Although=\r\n there were not as many sweep here as \n&gt; &gt; there \n&gt; &gt; &gt; were at Atlantis, w=\r\nith Cyclonus were several other minions: \n&gt; &gt; Darkfate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Nightstri=\r\nke as well as three others which were unknown - A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; warning that this =\r\nbattle may prove to be far more dangerous \nthen \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one before.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Grimlock landed and attacked his breath weapon attack prov=\r\ned \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; effective, striking down several sweeps and singed =\r\nseveral \nothers \n&gt; &gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they maneuvered out of his way. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; As Hydras approached from the rear his guns opening up on the \n&gt; rear \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; flank of the sweeps, they dispersed into the skies as several \nof \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthem \n&gt; &gt; &gt; were brought down and many more came in to take their places. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As the sweeps coiled around, absorbing the attacks from the \nw=\r\nould-\n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; defenders, in unison they began to open fire on Ark and=\r\n Legacy \nas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well as Grimlock and the defending shuttle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n At same time minions were receiving orders from Scourge who was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him=\r\nself floating into position and was more then ready to prove \n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself=\r\n, &quot;Tumult, Nightstrike and Darkfate You are with me! We \ngo \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndestroy the ark, and TAKE the Matrix!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The answer from Tumult =\r\nwas quick, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; as he powered up \nhis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; engines and maneuvered h=\r\nimself into position near the top of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; host.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Strangely=\r\n the response for the approaching Decepticons and \n&gt; &gt; Predicons \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was=\r\n a bit different - Although the Sweeps avoided combat, no \n&gt; combat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwas initiated. Instead Hydras recieved a call: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hydras&quot; Cyclo=\r\nnus&#39; calm voice crackled over the communication \n&gt; lines \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in an ancie=\r\nnt Unicronian code. &quot;You were once Galvatron, I can \n&gt; feel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his esse=\r\nnce within you, and I have felt it since you have \n&gt; &gt; approached. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n have given you and yours a stay of execution because of that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ancien=\r\nt connection between us.
