In fact one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the biggest complaints before the restart was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that there were too many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pointless battles.  To make it all about\n&gt; &gt; fighting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be a mistake.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now if you want to fix these problems and\n&gt; &gt; resubmit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your idea to the council, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suggest you send it to the council.  Your idea\n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merit and might work if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you can fix the flaws.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
