Why is it that you always look\n&gt; for some way to insult Legendary Nemasis when he&#39;s minding his own\n&gt; business? You need your ass kicked, and that&#39;s the bottom line.\n&gt; WHAT!? That&#39;s the bottom line. WHAT!? It&#39;s where the name is signed\n&gt; at the bottom of the contract. WHAT!? It&#39;s over. You wonder why\n&gt; people don&#39;t like you, especially Legendary Nemasis, well, it&#39;s\n&gt; probably because you do your best to insult him every post, you need\n&gt; to know when to stop. You act like LN is the bad guy, when it&#39;s you\n&gt; who won&#39;t end the war you disgusting little bitch. And I also\n&gt; believe that Legendary Nemasis was right. He had the character\n&gt; first, then it&#39;s his property, including the name, bottom line...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
