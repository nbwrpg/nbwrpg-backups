Bitch?! But \nit was a good thing that he loved her and didn&#39;t mind how she \nacted...otherwise he would have just gotten a hard cuff alongside his head!\nBut then she thought inwards towards her beast mode, it still having that \nrange of thought in its mind.\nShe smirked.*\n\n&lt; You think I&#39;m a bitch like it&#39;s a bad thing....&gt;\n\n* The mode simply looked at her, or her inner self anyway. Surpried at first \nbut then rolling its eyes and just settling down, like she wasn&#39;t even worth \nthe waste of memory it took to look at her.\nIron Raptor laghed inside of her mind.*\n\n&lt; And you call ME the bitch?!&gt;\n\n* But then Iron Raptors eyes snap towards Prowl as she recieves that thought \nabout her soubnding like a commander...and hot too.\nSimply sighing and giving him a look that simply asked if he ever thought \nabout anything else?\nBut then she sees him get ready to take off, thinking about her wings as \nsoon as he mentions that he could fly her beck to base.\nIron Raptor ponders it for a moment.\nShe didn&#39;t know the first things about flying...and she had always had a \nrather restricted fear of hights.\nThen looking to Prowl again and nodding.*\n\n&lt; Yes...please. Running would take too long...and slag knows that if the \nmerge or whatever did this...something&#39;s happened to my beast mode too. \nBut...&gt;\n\n* She waled up to Prowl, but with her eyes seriouse...with a little sarcasm \nin her thoughts.*\n\n&lt;...keep your lips to yourself, please.&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
