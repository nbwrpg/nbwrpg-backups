The first thing he does is swat the spider-spy \n&gt; off of his neck. He doesn&#39;t realize what it was. Rodimus exits the room to find Jhiaxus, Hydras and \n&gt; Perceptor. \n&gt;\n&gt; Dark Rodimus: What is the situation? Who needs to die? \n\nDark Rodimus attempts to swat off the spider spy, but is unable to dislodge it with such a simple move. it appears to have attached itself to him - like a tick! It has already transmitted its information, and so it has one final command! \n\nConnected as it is to Dark Rodimus&#39; neck, and through its probe to his spinal nexus;  it began to glow and flash in a rythmic patturn, a slow beat that is accelerating .. a count down to something ominious!\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
