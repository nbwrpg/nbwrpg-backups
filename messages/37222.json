Finally some progress, he \nthought\n&gt; to himself. &quot;Well, it dosent matter where your from, to any robot \nthis\n&gt; is fatal.&quot; he said, emitting a low power laser from one hand, as he \nheld\n&gt; the line to graft it into place. The superstructure could wait, but \nthis\n&gt; fuel pump and engine couldn&#39;t. He then went to the engine, grafting\n&gt; damaged parts together, mostly doing as little as possible as not to\n&gt; wreck anything.\n\n\n::REDHOT::\n\n    Redhot continued resting, his eyes closed. He silently tolerated \nthe Autobot&#39;s prodding. The rest seemed to do some good. That and the \nenergy he had drunk were helping stabalize his mind. He used the time \nand his growing strength to remember his last trip to Cybertron. He \nremembered his lover and the...pleasurable...momments they shared \nbefore his departure. He remebered sharing friendly words with his \nbrothers, notably Starscream and Skywarp. Redhot sighed, desperately \nhomesick. Sometimes he hated dimension travel.\n    He looked up at the Autobot as he repaired his &#39;engine&#39;, a \ngrateful smile brightening his weary face.\n    &#39;Th..thank you.&quot; he whispered.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n**************************\n\n\n"}}
