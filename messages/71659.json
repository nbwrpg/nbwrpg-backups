He knew silence\n&gt; would be his greatest weapon as far as keeping Elita safe.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I copy you, Lord Elder, I&#39;m seven hundred breams North by Northeast, and\n&gt; Elita is with me and safe in my cab.

Both LEO and ELDER\nlooked at each other knowingly. ELDER was about to say something to\nthat affect when LEO got a call . . .\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD TUSCON&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Leo Prime, I am flying Noctorro back to the damaged Fuzors and I will\n&gt; stand guard with them until help arrives.  In the mean time, Rodimus has\n&gt; fallen back into evil hands and I think it&#39;s best if he is barred from\n&gt; leadership duties until further notice.  I don&#39;t like being this harsh, but\n&gt; right now he can&#39;t be trusted.  Tell Bump to secure Nightlight in the med\n&gt; bay and put the Ark in immediate lockdown. We can&#39;t afford to take any\n&gt; chances.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD NIGHTLIGHT&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I heard that&quot;said Nighlight while she looked as if she where to have a\n&gt; nervous break down&quot;he is... his dark side has came back isnt?... What\n&gt; happened??&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME looked at both ELDER as well as LEGACY and WING CALIBER as\nthings were begining to fall into place, at least as far as NIGHSHIFT\nand ELITA.\n\nLEO looked at NIGHTLIGHT, &quot;I don&#39;t know completely what happened yet,\nbut we will find out as soon as we can.&quot; He put a consoling arm around\nNIGHTLIGHT&#39;s shoulders. &quot;But why don&#39;t we take you back to your\nquarters where you can rest. You have just taken on a new form and\nyour body will need time to adjust.&quot;\n\nThere was a smile from ELDER, &quot;When we will get to the bottom of this\nwe will let you know everything. I promise.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
