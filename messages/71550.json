We can le them know, how things in the\n&gt; past can change and go.  To the Autobots in far deep space, they shall not\n&gt; have to live in eternal disgrace.  If Megatron shall change the past, can we\n&gt; both leave him agahst?  Whatever Hydras here thinks he has, can we not\n&gt; escalate for better whereas?  For can we not fight fire wtih fire?  Changing\n&gt; the future to our better desire?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Whispering quietly, &quot;Could we bring Optimus back?  LEt the Cybertronian\n&gt; Resistance know hope holds out to cut them some slack?  Is that what we can\n&gt; do?  A message sent tot his time to breed hope anew?  It would be so easy,\n&gt; it wouldn&#39;t even leave us queasy.  Just prop up the Ark&#39;s Distress Beacon,\n&gt; have it flux and send home a story?  To tell them of it&#39;s glory?  By the\n&gt; time they got back here, we would be gone and the Ark free and near.  It\n&gt; would give us reason to send everyone home, the Decepticons and Predacons\n&gt; themselves to toss a bone.  For they could not hold out against and army,\n&gt; they would abandon the field as would we.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a thoughtful nod from RODIMUS.
