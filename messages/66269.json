We have gone to radio silence with the security forces because we don&#39;t want to get them involved.  They are still fairly week since the last attack. \n\n&quot;Another problem facing us, is that we have filled our two holding cells already.  Ordinarily this wouldn&#39;t be a problem because we would just use the police station, however that is not an option either due to the previous attack. \n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think we can afford to take any more prisoners, so we will have to find some way to drive off this intruder, reason with it, or render it unconscious and take it somewhere far away.&quot;\n\n He hit a button and brought up a map of the port region of the city.\n\n&quot;What I propose is that we divide into three teams.  The first team will be lead by myself.  I would like two of you with me.  We will go down and directly confront this bot.  The first team will have a set of capture gear in case things turn violent. \n\n&quot;The second team will be our backup and will try to keep the bot from reaching the city.  Since there is only a single ramp up from the port into the rest of the city, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem, however this team&#39;s role is crucial.  They will also have a set of capture gear. \n\n&quot;Finally, our third team will be assisting the troops here in case the base comes under attack.  This team can consist of one or two people because they will have the troopers, Salveo, and Kenzo to back them up if the base is breached.&quot; \n\n&quot;The base will remain in high-security lockdown the entire time.  The main entrance will be fully armed and guarded.  The shields will remain up.  Teams one and two will leave though the lower entrance tunnel near the holding cells.  After they leave, we&#39;ll close all the partition blast doors to ensure that the base is well fortified.&quot; \n\n&quot;Salveo will remain here to direct the mission over the radio.  Kenzo, you can choose to stay in the medical bay or defend the front enterance.  Remember that it will be difficult to move around once the partitions are up.  Nightlight and Elita;  I don&#39;t want Elita to get hurt, she should remain somewhere safe.
