He began surveying his surroundings, \nscanning the horizon until his gaze is drawn to an average sized nondescript \nbuilding entirely similar to those around it except for a small statue on \nit&#39;s roof.  A statue of himself.  &quot;No, it cannot be.  Why would they have \nsomething like that?  For that matter why is this Inner-Cybertron.&quot;  He \nfocuses his eyes more closely on the points of light in the sky only to \nrealize that they are not in fact stars but the lit tips of incredibly high \nstalactites.\n\n       The realization came to him as a bit of a shock but he shook it off \nand proceeded toward the building with his statue.  He walks inside and is \nquickly ushered into a large room.  A rather scrawny bot with no obvious \nweapons comes into the room.  Aerotaur was still tense but the bot was polite \nand to the point.  &quot;You&#39;re wondering about the statue.  It is of you.  Well, \nmore precisely, another you.  You, in this timeline, unite the peoples of \nCybertron after many battles.  But that is not your destiny.  Actually, you \nsee... We have a bit of a problem here.  One from your timeline fell into our \nworld... We need you to take him back.  He was causing a bit of a \ndisturbance.&quot;  He hands Aerotaur a small control box with one button on it.  \n&quot;When you return to your world you must push that button and he will \nrematerialize somewhere on the planet.  After that the circuit will fry and \nwe will never meet again.&quot;\n\n       Aerotaur takes this news in stoically and nods his understanding.  He \nis then whisked off to a small portal and shoved through to land back in his \ncave.  He solemnly presses the button and, on a small deserted island a \ngroaning body appears.\n\r\n--part1_57.18a9cfdf.2b8c48ff_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=3Darial,helvetica&gt;&lt;FONT  SIZE=3D2&gt;::Aerotaur::\n&lt;BR&gt; &nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned around eager to find his ghoulish g=\r\nuide but saw only stone walls where his voice was echoing from. &nbsp;He be=\r\ngan surveying his surroundings, scanning the horizon until his gaze is draw=\r\nn to an average sized nondescript building entirely similar to those around=\r\n it except for a small statue on it&#39;s roof. &nbsp;A statue of himself. &nbs=\r\np;&quot;No, it cannot be. &nbsp;Why would they have something like that? &nbsp;F=\r\nor that matter why is this Inner-Cybertron.&quot; &nbsp;He focuses his eyes more=\r\n closely on the points of light in the sky only to realize that they are no=\r\nt in fact stars but the lit tips of incredibly high stalactites.\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt; =\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The realization came to him as a bit of=\r\n a shock but he shook it off and proceeded toward the building with his sta=\r\ntue. &nbsp;He walks inside and is quickly ushered into a large room. &nbsp;=\r\nA rather scrawny bot with no obvious weapons comes into the room. &nbsp;Aer=\r\notaur was still tense but the bot was polite and to the point. &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;r=\r\ne wondering about the statue. &nbsp;It is of you. &nbsp;Well, more precisel=\r\ny, another you. &nbsp;You, in this timeline, unite the peoples of Cybertron=\r\n after many battles. &nbsp;But that is not your destiny. &nbsp;Actually, yo=\r\nu see...
