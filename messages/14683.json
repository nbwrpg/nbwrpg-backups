I live in Oakville Ontario\n&gt; Canada, and maybe some of you know from the news, and I&#39;m pretty sure\n&gt; dcoburn knows cause he&#39;s canadian too, but this week in Oakville is\n&gt; the PGA Canadian Open, where all the golf stars come for a\n&gt; tournament, and this year TIGER WOODS came, for the first time in 3\n&gt; years, and the last time he came the thing was in Montreal so I\n&gt; didn&#39;t see him but anyway I got his autgraph and shook his hand, and\n&gt; we had a conversation about how he played the round. I still can&#39;t\n&gt; believe it. I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH TIGER WOODS!!!!!! Sorry, I was\n&gt; screaming all the way home. Damn it, I&#39;m acting like a school girl.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois lead Windrazor and Terradive deeper and deeper into the\n&gt; mountain.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Um.....Now I don&#39;t knwo if this is the right way, and it&#39;s too late\n&gt; to turn back.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois continued to go down the tunnel in faint hope.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Fliq/Brix\n&gt;\n&gt; The space travellers continued to remove the hull, when Brix piped up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So, Ramulus, like that view of the earth from up here? Beautiful,\n&gt; ain&#39;t it.&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Gotron/Starscream\n&gt;\n&gt; Gotron was unnoticed in the battle, so he quietly snuck into the Pred\n&gt; cave. The Preds maybe willing to retreat, but Gotron wasn&#39;t ready\n&gt; yet. He stood just inside the door. He would probably die because of\n&gt; this, but he might knock off Deemos in the process. He waited for the\n&gt; Chosen Ones to claim their prise.\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream heard the word to retreat.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No way! Predacons never die down! I will not retreat!!!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream entered the Pred cave, but immediatly was caught by a\n&gt; right fist. Gotron and Starscream met eyes, and each thinking the\n&gt; other was a Maximal, started firing with blasters. Most of the shots\n&gt; went wide, hitting, and destroying the Pred cave.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Noble/Savage\n&gt;\n&gt; Noble was wandering around a valley, regaining strength, we looke dup\n&gt; to a cliff and saw too bots(Spears and Striker). Another chance to\n&gt; kill bots, he thought. He forced his anger under control, and worked\n&gt; to the bottom of the ledge. There he transformed into Savage. He flew\n&gt; up to meet them, and as soon as their eyes met he fired a large\n&gt; fireball.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
