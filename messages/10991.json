Hey, get up!&quot; He shook \nher trying to wake her. He stood up and grabbed her by the arms. He dragged \nher to the CR room, but when he got her there, he knew it was too late. He \nstared at her lifeless body. It wasn&#39;t fair. He never knew a bot he liked \nthat died on him.\n\nHis optics glowed an almost expressionless glare. He slowly walked out of \nthe room, into the corridor. He pressed his back against the wall and slid \nhis body down into the floor. He ducked his head between his knees and made \na strange whimpering tone.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
