It would let her body repair its self. \nComing back from the dead was a hard thing to go through, but the mouse was \ntaking it well.\n    She inserted the needle into her right arm and let the medicine flow \nthrough her viens with the energon. Thw widow could now leave her, knowing \nshe would be safe from harm. The worst part was over, tommorow she would be \nup and running like nothing happened. \n    Leaveing the room, she recalled Quickstrike being rather depressed. He \ncould keep a vigil over Darkmouse while she was attending Megatron. Walking \ndown the corridor she entered the alcove to his quarters. They were one of \nthe largest on the ship. Originally ment for the senior staff, but in times \nof war.....\n    She pused the keypad, and entered. In the great room of his quarters lay \nchairs, sofas, tables, and art work recreated digitally by some of the \ngreatest Predacon, and even Decepticon artist ever. She made her way through \nthe room to enter the hall way that led to his chamber. With her black claw \nshe scrapped softly.\n    &quot;Quickstrike? I want to talk to you about Darkmouse. Quickstrike?&quot; She \nasked agian softly, comfortly.\n\n"}}
