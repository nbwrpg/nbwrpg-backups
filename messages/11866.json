He decided that his only chance was to\nattempt to make a run for the Armory. He ran inside,\ndown the corridor and into armory. He grabbed the\nfirst weapons he saw,a large chain gun and a semi\nautomatic laser rifle. He ran back out, activated his\njet pack, and took off after the jet bot. He fired 25\nrounds from his chain gun and 4 shots from the laser\nrifle at the jet&#39;s engines.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
