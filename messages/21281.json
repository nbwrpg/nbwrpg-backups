He looked to peastelense. &quot;Use your  ability.&quot; he nodded and he shot his \nfamous arrow. It hit near some of the alliance members. It was coded to send \na virus through all surronding enimes. This would not hurt kit kat or the \nothers for it was formatted not to. It would only keep them in pain fo 20 sec \nat most. So the horsmen flew down yelling for the retreat and destructor \ngrabs kit Kat by the arm and starts to fly away.\n\n"}}
