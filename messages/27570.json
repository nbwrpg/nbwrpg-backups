They would stand little \nchance of a \n&gt; hard battle arising in this situation. Ominous commanded they stay \nand fight.\n&gt;        &quot;Blast them agian, and Quasar, repair the left Naucel. Its \nleaking \n&gt; energon from Aleo&#39;s blast.&quot; Ominous said. To the left of the main \nshuttle, \n&gt; Akrons shuttle made a sharp about face and sent three energon \nmissles raining \n&gt; down on Aleo&#39;s vessle.\n&gt;        As for Greven, Ominous targeted him agian and fired. This \ntime only \n&gt; two blasts from the Tripulse canon. He needed to save as much \nenergy as \n&gt; possible.\n&gt;        Venus, in the smaller shuttle to the right, begins to ready \nweapons \n&gt; for the upcoming vessles.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        Hell Beast looked to Shockwave. &quot;Were packed and ready. \nDetenators are \n&gt; placed throughout the cave. We can leave now. Take us to the new \nbase.&quot; He \n&gt; glanced at the transport shuttles and the team of Predacons \npiloting them. \n&gt; The Neo Deception Empire was just beginning.\n\n\n"}}
