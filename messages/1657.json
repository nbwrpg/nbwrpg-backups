That means, we will tell him/her she&#39;/he&#39;s gone via e-mail or IM, \nand kill him off in the RPG.  Really no exact way how to kill the character \noff, maybe an avalanche, tripping on a rock down Mount Everest.  \n\nAlso, yes, I&#39;ve noticed a character named &quot;Tocra&quot;, which is supposed to be \nTorca.  You can&#39;t really blame someone for bad spelling.  Some people, just \nplain suck at it and can&#39;t type the simplest words, ::Hack, cough::.  But, I \npersonally would have to say you just making a character, and making Torca \ngood friends with Liono, a mode, unless you discussed it with him.  That&#39;s \nlike if I made a character who was best friends with Zardus, or said he was \nZardus&#39; partner in crime back on Cybertron and try and get him to have power \nin the Alliance.  To do something like that, you need the permission of the \ncharcacter&#39;s owner, unless you make two friends between your own characters.\n\nPS: Decepticons own.  I&#39;m a Decepticon in every RPG I play, except for this \none, because of new rules it no longers allows members of the glorious \nDecepticon Empire.  But Decepticons would&#39;ve won, except for Galvatron!  How \nGalvatron?  Wouldn&#39;t it be more accurately Unicron?  I think not.  Unicron \nwas probably going to spare Cybertron, but that idiot who didn&#39;t know jack \nabout the Matrix tried to use it on Unicron...then he went crazy later in \n5FoD, and made the Empire collapse.  Blow up Cybertron and Earth, what a \nputz.  As for Rebirth, that is one of the crappiest episodes I&#39;ve ever seen.  \nLike the Autobots needed the help of the Nebulans to destroy a bunch of \nnear-defenseless robots.  They&#39;d just shoot them from a ways away, that&#39;s \nwhat their rifles are for!\n\n"}}
