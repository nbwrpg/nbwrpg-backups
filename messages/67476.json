The wisdom of the ages, the\n&gt; power of the Matrix had almost been Rodimus&#39; life force for so long.\n&gt; He belonged to the Matrix as much as it belonged to him. Now it was\n&gt; gone. The Matrix shell being depleted as it&#39;s awesome power was\n&gt; extracted from it&#39;s connection with Rodimus&#39; spark. This was the fall\n&gt; of the legend. The chosen one was beaten and failed to protect the\n&gt; very thing he was alive to protect.\n\nThere was no change of expression from Cyclonus as Rodimus screamed\nout. Energy streamed between them, first from between Cyclonus&#39; hands\nto Rodimus chest then sparks began to jump all along them. For a moment\nthey rose from the ground as powerful electrical fields danced in\nbetween them. Wind began to blow and once placid waters became strong\nand choppy For a moment the skies darkend as clouds before the sun, and\nin the distance thunderclapped .. and then all was was complete. \n\nCyclonus and Rodimus both fell to the ground for a moment sprawled out\non the sandy beach. Cyclonus sat up his optics going yellow then orange\nthen resuming thier dark red. \n\nRising into the air Cyclonus&#39; feet merged and boosters replaced them\nallowing him to hover in place. As he did so it became obvious that\nsomething about Cyclonus had changed with the defeat of this foe. He\nwas still damaged, his armor burned and desnted in many places, cracks\nseeming to run his full length and yet he was subtly different. He took\na moment to survey his fallen foe, his look unreadable as if absorbing\nwhat had been done. \n\nAs he watched Rodimus appeared to glow red as Scourge and the remainder\nsweeps above &#39;painted&#39; him preparing to destroy him utterly.\n\n&quot;No.&quot; Cyclonus word was clear and final, his face still somber. &quot;He has\nfallen as a warrior, and I will allow him to be buried by his fellows.&quot;\n\n\nThe red targetting beams winked off and Rodimus resumed his normal hue.\n\n\nFrom behind Cyclonus Scourge&#39;s gruff voice can be heard, &quot;Hrmph. He was\na fool! Let&#39;s use this moment to destroy him and that city behind us.&quot;\n\nCyclonus shook his head, &quot;We abide by this battle. We have won, and we\nshall leave.&quot; He turned to look at Scourge, &quot;But we shall be back.&quot; For\nthe first time a smile appeared on Cyclonus&#39; face, &quot;but without the\nmight of Rodimus they will not be able to stand against us.&quot;\n\nSourge nodded in approval.\n\nCyclonus looked skyward as sweeps continued to circle and as several\narrived apparently from some distance away. They merged with the rest\nand circled as if waiting. &quot;Is everything in readiness?&quot; Cyclonus asked\nScourge without looking away from the sweeps.\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; Scourge&#39;s voice full of eagerness. &quot;everything is going\naccording to plan.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good.&quot; Cyclonus&#39; smile faded as he rose up into the air and then\nassumed his starfighter mode. &quot;Then it is time for us to depart. leave\nRodimus to his own .. and leave that one as well .. &quot; indicating Remus\n&quot;He can report our victory to thier remaing leaders, and they will come\nto fear us, as all will!&quot;\n\nWith a burst of sheer power Cyclonus rose up into the clouds as Scourge\nfollowed suit and then the sweeps. Then like some dark storm they rose\nhigh into the air took one last sweep, and then faded into the setting\nsun, quickly disappearing from all visual sensors.\n\n-----------------\n\nDown below on the sandy beach calm waters continued to lap against the\nfallen form of Rodimus as the tide was begining to come in. Trees in\nthe distance began to blow and sway as natural winds resumed. the cool\nbreezes blew sand around, slowly begining to cover the scorched sands\non the beach. In the skies sea birds cautiously began fly, a few even\nwere bold enough to try to land on Rodimus, thinking him a nice warm\nresting place as they looked for fish. \n\nTranquility with unyielding boldness and resolve began to reassert\nitself once more.\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
