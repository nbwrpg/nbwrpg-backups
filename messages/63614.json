The anger of a\nforgotten past will have to wait.  She must self focus on the issues\nat hand. Right now she would have to learn more about her present\nsituation in order to be of greater help with her new found friends.\nShe transformed into barn owl mode and flew down the hallways of the\nbase.  As she flew, she heard the sounds of sobbing and low voices\neminating from the mess hall.  She thought it best to not get involved\nand fly past.  As she did so, she saw Megatron with a female bot.  In\nmid-air, she transformed into bot mode and dropped to the floor.  She\nstood there in the doorway for a moment, her hatred for Decepticons\nglaring on her optics.  Noting that he was not harming her and that he\nwas supposed to be on thier side, she turned and walked away. As she\nwalked down the hall, she thought about her mind block.  She started\nto walk towards the entrance doors. &quot;If I can find the back-up chip, I\ncan remember and perhaps find out what is going on. Or at least what\nwent on.&quot;She made her way to the entrance and transformed into bot\nmode.  She took to the skies and went out in search of her pod.\n\nIt took only a little while before she found it. Inside the pod, under\na small and well hidden panel was a tiny microchip.  The case was\ndusty as ever, but the chip showed no damage.  With the chip in her\ngrasp, she returned to the base.\n\nShe walked in and headed for her quarters.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
