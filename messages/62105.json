He decided to get to work on the network hub and leave\nthe for later.  The hub had not been damaged severely and most of it\nwas repaired by simple rewiring, but he still needed more parts.  So\nhe went out of the room and this time started exploring further into\nthe ship than he had before.....\n\nOOC: How big is this ship?\n\n"}}
