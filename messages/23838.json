She thought for a second \non how confused her friends back there must be. She felt stupid,she slapped \nher forhead, and in doing so, let go of Snow Tech&#39;s one arm-pit. He dangled \nthere in her one arm screaming at her to grab hold before he fell. She \nsnapped to her sences and looked down on him, grabbing his other arm pit as \nshe did.*\n\n&quot; Uh, i kindda rushed things didn&#39;t I?&quot;\n\n* Snow Tech nodded and spoke to her*\n\n&quot; I was wondering when you&#39;d notice that you where, and are, making a fool \nof yourself.&quot;\n\n* He smiled as she frowned down at him, wanting to smack him, but afraid of \nletting him fall.*\n\n&quot; You know i could let you fall onto those trees down there and make you \nwalk to the fight!&quot;\n\n* He grinned and shook his head*\n\n&quot; What! And let all the joy in your life die with me? I don&#39;t think so!&quot;\n\n* She grumbled and turned around, heading back to her friends to apoligize*\n\n&quot; What fun?&quot;\n\n* She landed in front of Prowl and Iron Raptor, putting down Snow Tech down \nand stepping aside, directly in front of Iron Raptor. She hung her head and \nmumbled out her apology.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sorry that i ran off like that, my fear surciuts mustta over-ridden my \nlogic circuits. I hope that you&#39;ll forgive me?&quot;\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
