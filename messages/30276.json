Without back up, she&#39;d be on her own.  She checked \nth side bag and found two plasma pistols.  She smiled, &quot;Alone, but not \nunarmed.&quot;  She kept her course and would reach the IronFist soon.\n\n\n-----original message-------\n&gt;::FZ::\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Take the fastest vehicle in the Iron Fist and scout out..&quot; he\n&gt;pauses, his mind going over the locations to be scouted.
