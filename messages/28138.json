Even if he had tried to plan that, he couldn&#39;t have planned it \nbetter.\n\n&quot;Galactors, you know what to do!&quot; he says, both jets seperating into \nseperate bots. The Galactors fly through the air toward each other, \nmissing the EMP blasts fairly easily, though several almost get him \nby some. The Galactors reach each other, combining once again, but \nthis time into different jets. Scrap was now with Vicyr and Slasys, \nand Supernova and Flare made up the other jet. Both jets angle \nupward, looking like an air show as they barely avoid colision with \neach other, zooming apart and still heading up. So far, the Galactor \nproject was a success.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; The base is on land, Yan, in Mongolia. Im glad that youre on top of \nit, \n&gt; couldnt have done it with out you buddy.\n&gt; \n&gt;        The missles hit the shields and sent a wave of energy across \nthe force \n&gt; feild. Quickly, the EMP Canon targeted the Jets and sent a shot \nafter each of \n&gt; them. The missle launchers targeted the bots outside the base and \nsent spark \n&gt; seeking missles after them.\n\n\n"}}
