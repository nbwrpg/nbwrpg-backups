Whether he has a robot \nmode at all is yet to be discovered.\nChained and shackled most of his unnatural life, all D has ever known was \nthe back view of cell bars. Experiments and strange injections are all part \nof a normal day. But not all of his life is science and pain, times where \nthe silence of his chamber is more of a pleasure them most could ever know.\n\tHowever, that all changed the day that the scientific vessel he was created \non happened to slip into a rift that just happened to lead to prehistoric \nEarth.\nThe ship crash-landed on the coast of the planetï¿½s mainland and from there \nwas destroyed, leaving the soul survivor as D.\n\n\nPersonality:\n\nGenerally shy from his mistrust in people, D is very polite because, like \nthe people he gre up knowing, is afraid that if he was to do the wrong thing \nhe would be punished. D has no difficulty understanding things, but with his \nlack of speech he has a hard time expressing himself.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
