The pilot had not fared\nmuch better, most of its form has torn and damaged by tree limbs and\nbroken strips of metal. Physically the pilot looked dead, although if\nit were alive it would still be unable to move due to the limbs and\ndebris. Interestingly despite the heavy damage to the rest of its\nform, the pilot&#39;s chest and hip quarters are intact, so it is possible\nto determine that the pilot was female, although there is no faction\nsymbol present.\n\nVenom&#39;s voice comes of the radio, &quot;Lamia, report!&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
