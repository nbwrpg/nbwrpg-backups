He\n&gt; loved this Predacon technology. Zardus fires back at Prebon with\n&gt; three shots from his plasma launcher.\n\nPrebon held his arms in front of him as the plasma blasts hit, he was\ndetermined to show Zardus what a superior model could accomplish.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, it appears the Mighty Zardus has,&quot; he says, &quot;Although I&#39;d be\n&gt; interested to know why you are attacking my base.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPrebon recieved Zardus&#39; transmission. &quot;They&#39;re still able to communicate?\nItold Blaze to make sure to eliminate that possability.&quot; He wasn&#39;t happy\nabout how disorganized this organized attack was becoming, his trainers were\nworking well together but were still being sloppy. &quot;Hello Zardus, you have\nan impressive ship, I must admit for Predacon technology it has it&#39;s\nadvantages.&quot; he didn&#39;t want to keep the line open or he knew that the ships\ndefenses would lock on to him but he couldn&#39;t help to gloat. &quot;I function for\nthe fight, I&#39;m programmed for battle, and I attack you because it is the\nmost logical strategic move for this battle. Unless of course you have a\nmore logical solution.&quot;\n&gt; Slayer and Recklessa plunge into the water, both trying to get at\n&gt; each other. The underwater defences of the Iron Fist begin to\n&gt; activate.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Havoc smiles as the shots from Bullet&#39;s disruptor are intercepted by\n&gt; the shields. The shields let things out, but they didn&#39;t let them in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Havoc fires two missiles at Bullet, still laughing.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBullet saw the shields block the disruptor blast, this battle had already\nproved more senseless than the trainers had origionally thought, he fired\nagain, this time he fired at the ground outside the shields, a dustcloud\narose causing a mist to form where the shields were, if Bullet couldn&#39;t hit\nhis targets then his targets wouldn&#39;t see him.\n\n&gt; The Lavacons continue to fire at the Trainers.\nalready taken care of.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OK Yanshosh, since theres already been posts involving cover I&#39;ll\n&gt; say\n&gt; &gt; limited cover. As for distance, they&#39;re supposedly a superior race\n&gt; three\n&gt; &gt; miles is nothing to thier main weapons.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bullet looks up, seeing havok, The missles head toward him faster\n&gt; than he\n&gt; &gt; can react. Suddenly the missles explode in mid air as a burst of\n&gt; energy\n&gt; &gt; strikes them down. Blaze stands, disruptor in hand awaiting further\n&gt; attacks.\n&gt; &gt; She aims at Hovok firing three shots from her disruptor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ignatius joins Slayer in his attempts to bring down Wheeljack. he\n&gt; fires his\n&gt; &gt; eyebeams at the Alliance bot, and two missles at the shields\n&gt; covering the\n&gt; &gt; power unit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hammer rises again and fires an energy beam across the battlefield,\n&gt; moving\n&gt; &gt; back and forth at Sharpedge and Godfather.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;re taking abuse here&quot; Hammer calls out. With the limited cover\n&gt; he didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; feel such a small unit could be much effect.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prebon believed differently though as he continued to push for\n&gt; advancement,\n&gt; &gt; the disruptorblasts were doing thier job and weakening the shields\n&gt; but it\n&gt; &gt; still wasn&#39;t fast enough. &quot;Continue the advance, so far theres been\n&gt; little\n&gt; &gt; resistance, as long as they can&#39;t call for reinforcements we have\n&gt; the upper\n&gt; &gt; hand.&quot; Prebons inspirational words pushed the Trainers forward with\n&gt; the need\n&gt; &gt; for success or deleation. Failure was not a possability or an\n&gt; option.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
