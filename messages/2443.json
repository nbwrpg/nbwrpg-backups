He \ntransforms back into robot mode, a wave on nausea sweeping over him.\n\nProwl walks to Iron Raptor and puts his hands aroung her, kissing her, &quot;We&#39;ll \nhave plenty of time later...,&quot; he says as he takes a step back, looking Iron \nRaptor over to make sure she was all right. The scrape on her cheek wasn&#39;t \ntoo serious. &quot;Right now let&#39;s get back to base.&quot;\n\nProwl&#39;s eyes widen as he glances at his arm, which was now covered with Iron \nRaptor&#39;s mech fluid. He seriously hoped that his hug hadn&#39;t hurt her.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re injured!&quot; He says, concern in his eyes and his voice, &quot;Transform to \nbeast mode.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Tritan, &quot;We&#39;ll manage. Thanks for your help, though.&quot;\n\n"}}
