Without the\nfrequency to them that Guiledart has they cant adapt.\nThis is going to be easy.&quot; He and his troops flew back\nto the ship and watched as Drillbit started the hole.\nHe looked at Cyngar. &quot;They have locateing mines. The\nsignals will take care of that so I suggest to totaly\nelemenate them you bring some for the destructocons\nwhen we arrive.&quot; He was ready.
