One could only&lt;br&gt;\nhope that =\r\nas time passed and the lava cooled and turned into rock and&lt;br&gt;\ndirt that t=\r\nhe jungle would recover its lost area and once again be the&lt;br&gt;\nluxuriant g=\r\nreen carpet that it was.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever as the team circled above it was =\r\neasy to see that the area&lt;br&gt;\nthat was damaged was small compared to the va=\r\nstness of the jungle&lt;br&gt;\nitself. There were still thousands of acres of jun=\r\ngle still left&lt;br&gt;\nuntouched by the destruction.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBut now they jour=\r\nnied home, back towards the ARK and back to the&lt;br&gt;\nrelative saftey of the =\r\nMAXIMAL headquarters.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt felt like only a short period of time bef=\r\nore they could see the&lt;br&gt;\noutline of the very mountain that the ARK sat at=\r\n the base of,&lt;br&gt;\nstrangely enough another volcano, one that would one day =\r\nerrupt&lt;br&gt;\nitself.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nA call came into TUCSON, it was from LORD ELDER=\r\n, &quot;Nightshift has been&lt;br&gt;\ntrying to reach you.&quot; He said, his voice were pe=\r\nrfectly clear. &quot;I am&lt;br&gt;\nsending you his last known coordinates.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nSurprisingly enough the coordinates were only 50 miles from the ARK,&lt;br&gt;\nju=\r\nst outside of the ARK&#39;s immediate sensor range.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- P=\r\nreston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-E09BB4D6-D046-4DC4-8B27-C23FB7FE6DBD--\r\n\n"}}
