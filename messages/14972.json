If it wasn�t for the fact that they could be \nattacked at any time, he could have easily fallen asleep at his post.\nBut it just so happened that the numbness of his open chest wound had began \nto ware off and the pain was now beginning to return, now and again suddenly \nshifting to life and making him wince as it sparked.\nTHAT wasn�t a good sign. But then again, neither was the open gash in his \nchest that continued to bleed like never before. Though, not failing to hear \nthe muffled sounds of the wolfin fembot as she slept.\nDinobot glanced into the shadows of the woods for one last moment before \nheaving himself to his feet, brushing himself off only to find that the \nsilver armor of his chest was completely covered in a fresh wash of his own \nfluid.\nHe growled as his own hands dripped with mech-fluid but then quickly turned \nhis head towards the stream and where Tavatron lay sleeping, his optics \nfalling upon her after looking over the sparkling surface of the flowing \nbrook.  It was time for them to get moving, and hope that they reached the \nCybertronien Fire before he went into stasis lock from lack of fluids.\nDinobot took in a deep breath of the crisp night air as he turned once again \ntowards the forest, watching every shadow for any movement, which might \nsignal some sort of enemy attack. One last check never hurt anybot anyway.\nHowever, he was a bit surprised to suddenly hear the waking rustle of fur as \nhe turned back towards the small stream running through the glade, seeing \nTavatron get to her feet after just stretching.\nShe would have been repaired by now, her beast mode taking care of that. \nWhich meant that now was just as good a time as any to get moving, and maybe \nthey would be at the Maximal ship by evening the coming day.\nDinobot growled, IF he didn�t slow then down with his wounds they would get \nthere by then. But he was going to make sure that they did reach it at the \nappointed time, no matter how wounded he was or how badly he bled.\nHe shifted his gaze to the forest in, which was the direction they would \nleave, where the swamp lay that they MUST cross. The position of the moon \nabove the canopy clearly translating to him that it was around the tenth \nmega-cycle, the perfect time to get the hardest part of their journey over \nwith and done.\nAs he heard Tavatron speak he knew her words, though why anybot would be \nworried about HIM was completely from his mind. Though, he knew that if \nanything they would be concerned about Tavatron�s welfare, and that she \nreached the Maximal base safely. And he was going to make sure she did.\nDinobot looked carefully into the darkened shadows of the forest once again, \nbut then quickly back towards the brook where Tavatron stood.*\n\n� Agreed.�\n\n* His voice a growl, though, only due to the sudden wave of mech-fluid that \nflowed freely from his open chest wound, seeming to replace the coat that \nhad began to dry. A simply wave of pain flowing along with it.\nHowever, he wasn�t concerned, he had been in worse condition then this \nbefore and lived.\nDinobot turned from Tavatron with a snarl as he heard the leaves above \nrustle, the wind picking up slightly and causing the glade floor to dance \nwith what moon light the canopy was letting through.\nThough, it also brought a new wash of fresh air to the wounded warrior�s \nmetallic lungs, taking it in and breathing deeply.\nLetting out the breath, Dinobot turned once again towards Tavatron, though \nhis face set with the same aggressive stature he always wore when there was \na task ahead.\nHowever, inside he hoped that she wouldn�t see just how badly his wound was \nbleeding and the canopy shadows would hide it, no need for concern when \nthere was an important duty at hand.*\n\n� Ready?�\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
