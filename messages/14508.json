I hope Darkmouse and paralysis have gotten him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Paralysis saw the battle outside, but easily made it into the \ncave with a \n&gt; little back door Darkmouse had informed him of earlier. The base \nwas in \n&gt; shambles, soon there was going to be a cave it. \n&gt;  He continued deeper into the cave when he heard Megatron and \nWaspinator \n&gt; yelling...\n&gt;     &quot;Get out there and defend the cave you insect!&quot; He bellowed, \nand \n&gt; Waspinator threw down his wepon.\n&gt;     &quot;No, Waspinator tir-&quot; Thats all he got to say because Megatron \nbatted his \n&gt; head off and then turned to the frog.\n&gt;     He glared, &quot;Aracnia sent you? Indeed....she should have come \nherself. No \n&gt; matter. Soon you and everyone else on this planet will be dust, and \nI shall \n&gt; claim triumph for the Decepticons once and for all! Yes!&quot;\n&gt;     Paralysis opened fire on the windbag, sending him flying into a \ndark \n&gt; corner. &quot;You cant contact them with out a computer!&quot;\n&gt;     With that, he blew apart the computers in the room, bit by bit. \nSmoke \n&gt; filled the area, and Paralysis realized that Megatron was gone. And \nthen the \n&gt; fire eruppted.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron took his chance, gathered up Waspinator and fled from \nthe cave. \n&gt; It would be gone soon....and now that he couldnt contact the Armada \nit was \n&gt; sure to leave. His minions, besides Waspinator, had grown quite \nbold and he \n&gt; could do with out them. Besides, Kitkat was a far better leader.\n&gt;     Carrying Waspinator, he entered the swamps and ran as fast as \nhe could. \n&gt; He would have his revenge, One day.....\n&gt; \n&gt;     The Armada, with the link severed, began its return trip home. \nThe vesske \n&gt; entered a warp corridor and vanished from view.\n\n\n"}}
