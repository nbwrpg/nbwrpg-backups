Reaching behind him, he pulls out a large\nsword, slashing it at Abominus as he nears him. The two missiles he\nhad shot earlier turn, heading for his enemy&#39;s back.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe kick hit Lavatron, making him stumble back and lose his balance.\nHe falls on his butt, but fires four lightning bolts while doing so.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I&#39;ll continue posting with Abominus if the others don&#39;t mind.\n&gt; ::Abominus/Surgital::\n&gt; \n&gt;     Abominus ran sideways and avoided the missiles, then shot 2\nblasts at Galaxor.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;     Surgital put front his Explobody arm to block the lightning\nbolts, since Explobody was the most durable Bodicon.  The bolts tore\ninto Surgital&#39;s arm, but not badly.  The electricty surged through him\na little with each bolt, but he remained standing.  He couldn&#39;t die,\nthose were his orders, after all.  Surgital threw a roundhouse kick at\nLavatron.\n\n\n"}}
