He checks himself over as he=\r\n \n&gt; runs. His signature masker was still operating but the grenade \nblast \n=\r\n&gt; had fried his cloaking device.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Finall he is coming up on an o=\r\nuter wall. Two rockets later and \n&gt; there is just a hole. Rodimus leaps out=\r\n, transforming to behical \n&gt; mode. He lands on all screeching tires. Headin=\r\ng for Mt. St. Hillary.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the ship Scourge is running to chase dow=\r\nn his fleeing prey, \n&gt; his weapons at the ready as his face wears a grim lo=\r\nok of \n&gt; determination. Trailing behind him where four other sweeps running=\r\n \n&gt; like soldiers in lock step with thier commander. \n&gt; \n&gt; They all screech=\r\n to a stop, Scourge holding up a hand, they looked \n&gt; around as they could =\r\nall feel the sudden a force shield that sprang \n&gt; into place cutting them o=\r\nff from Rodimus. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even as the spun around, standing back to back as th=\r\ney surveyed the \n&gt; area, guns came alive on the walls and began to orient o=\r\nn the \n&gt; minions, and cut into them with metal cutting fury!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Scourge =\r\ngrunted as the bullets burned into him! Although his armor \n&gt; was tough and=\r\n designed for heavy combat, even he was not impervious \n&gt; to the attacks. T=\r\nhe sweeps were not doing as well as he was. Two of \n&gt; them were cut down im=\r\nmidiatly, and the other two were looking worn. \n&gt; \n&gt; Looking up down he smi=\r\nled as lubricant leaked from several wounds, \n&gt; for he noticed the age of t=\r\nhe floors and the walls of this room. \nThis \n&gt; ship had been abandoned for =\r\nquite some time, and time had not been \n&gt; kind to it. The walls were rustin=\r\ng in spots and the floors were not \n&gt; much better. The fiasco with the grea=\r\nndes on the level above was \n&gt; proof of that!\n&gt; \n&gt; With a feral gin Scourge=\r\n pointed his weapon upward, &quot;The battle is \n&gt; not over yet prey! We are com=\r\nming for you!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Most ship shields were designed to capture prisoners =\r\ntwo \n&gt; dimentionally, foward, back and to the sides, Scourge on the other \n=\r\n&gt; hand was creating a door the ship was not prepared to block. With a \n&gt; sm=\r\nile he fired his disintergration beams upwards, vaporizing the \n&gt; upward bu=\r\nlkheads. \n&gt; \n&gt; With a leap he and the two remaining sweeps with him leaped =\r\ninto \nthe \n&gt; air, shifting into thier sleeker, and better masked hunter-see=\r\nkers \n&gt; modes they few upwards, thier weapons blasting upwards even as the =\r\n\n&gt; ship attempted to contain fire on them as they moved!\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, with=\r\n a terrific explosion, one that sent metal debris over \n&gt; the side of the s=\r\nhip and into the surrounding area, they fairly \n&gt; errupted from the top of =\r\nthe ship, not too far from where the \nbridge \n&gt; sat. \n&gt; \n&gt; Floating in mid =\r\nair, his sensor scattering armor keeping the ship&#39;s \n&gt; autoguns at bay, now=\r\n that they were free of the ship enviorns, he \n&gt; looked around as he assess=\r\ned the situation. \n&gt; \n&gt; Only two of the six sweeps he had brough with him h=\r\nad survived, and \n&gt; from the looks of things Rodimus had continued to flee.=\r\n Scourge had \n&gt; failed, and he knew it. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Commander&quot; Scourge&#39;s voice c=\r\nrackled across the minion encrypted \n&gt; channel, &quot;Rodimus has successfully f=\r\nled the ship and is headed in \n&gt; your direction, I failed to destroy him.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; After a pause Cyclonus&#39; calm voice transmitted itself to \n&gt; Scourge, &quot;=\r\nNo, your attack on him was a test, his destruction will \nbe \n&gt; at MY hand. =\r\nHad you succeeded then he would be unworthy of me, like \n&gt; all the rest tha=\r\nt have faced me. It would seem there something of \nthe \n&gt; Prime in him afte=\r\nr all.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; The voice of Cyclonus paused for a moment and then \ncontinued=\r\n, &quot;Return \n&gt; to my location, here you will find a way to redeem yourself.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot; Came Scourge&#39;s reply, the voice of an mech who had been just \n&gt;=\r\n been given a stay of execution. &quot;I am on my way!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that Scourge a=\r\nnd the sweeps shot into the air, moving swiftly \n&gt; and silently in the dire=\r\nction of the ark!\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Scourge & Sweeps)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
