Dinobot�s down and completely devoid of \nmech-fluid in the hall. Stasis lock. I could use your help.�\n\n* And with that, she exited the room, knowing that they would have to check \nhim out before they placed him into a CR chamber, thankful for the repair \nstation Feline had made up in the CR room.\nShe entered into the hall and turned the corner, Tavatron coming into view, \nthen seeing the downed Dinobot at her feet.\nThere was no time to wait for Prowl as she quickly ran up behind Tavatron \nand looked down at the damaged bot, her systems scanning over him and \ndetermining what was wrong.\nIron Raptor squatted down and look a closer look over Dinobot, not even \ntaking notice of the puddle of his mech-fluid she happened to be standing \nin.*\n\n� He�s stopped breathing, and there�s no more mech-fluid left in his body. \nIf we don�t get his fluid limit back up and air into his lungs, he�ll die. \nAnd by the looks of it, we have about 12 min to do it.�\n\n* With that she simply, but quickly, took one of Dinobots� arms and slung it \nover her shoulder, putting an arm around his back and then standing up�the \nbest she could.\nHe was heavy!\nIron Raptor gritted her teeth as she struggled to keep her balance, \nwondering that if she took a step that the weight of this bot would bring \nher down with it.\nHowever, she would have to find out sooner or later, the need to get him to \nthe CR room dominant over all.\nShe took a step towards Tavatron and the CR room but the weight of Dinobot \nwas almost too much for her to take alone, wondering just how a bot could \nlook so lien and be so heavy at the same time.\nShe growled with the effort it took just to keep him from falling, must be \nmuscle. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
