He moves it, seeing if it was, and is rewarded by a jolt of \npain. He smiles slightly as she rubs his side.\n\n-Of course I can stay awake,- he replies to her, excited at the idea \nof getting his and Epyon&#39;s plan underway. With the new spaceship \nbehind him, that plan had just gotten better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor keeps a steady pace because she wanted Prowl and \nherself \n&gt; inside of the CF as soon as they could be and it would still be a \nfew min at \n&gt; the pace they were going. But she was willing to take this time to \nhelp \n&gt; Prowl get his feet under him and hoped he would forgive her for \nbreaking his \n&gt; wing in SBM.\n&gt; She could tell that he was pretty shaken up and she rubbed his side \na bit.\n&gt; &lt; Looks like you got one when I got mine back, babe.&quot;\n&gt; She smiled at him all the same.\n&gt; It was a powerful mode and she was sure that if he could just get \ncontrole \n&gt; of it he&#39;d be something to be feared in battles, and her thoughts \nrelayed \n&gt; that too.\n&gt; &lt; Think you can stay awake?&gt;\n&gt; Iron Raptor didn&#39;t really want him sleeping but she could take a \nmega cycle \n&gt; or two for him to rest and relax in his quarters before she got him \ndown to \n&gt; work on what she had in mind.\n&gt; It was about the right time to get down to his plan.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://\n\n\n"}}
