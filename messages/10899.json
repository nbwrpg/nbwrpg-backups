If your good=Maximal, the transformation term is \n&gt; Maximize, that turns you from beast mode into bot mode.\n&gt; The bad=Predacon guy term is Terrorize.\n&gt; If your neutral, you pick one or the other, but play your character \n&gt; as you see fit and not by what a normal faction member may be like.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ::GoldenEye::\n&gt; \n&gt; She smiled at the sqirrel.
