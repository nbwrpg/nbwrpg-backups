There were practically no trees where they were, so she launched herself into the air at a height where she could could keep an eye on both the Raptor and Carnage. \n\nIt sounded strange, keeping an eye on the Raptor. Still.. she had better\n\nOnce airborne, the thought of actually finding another Maximal popped into her head. Was it what she *really* wanted? To belong to a base, have a team, and fight the Predacons day after day? She shakes her head, mostly to herself. \n\nIt didn&#39;t sound right. She loved travelling with her friends.. yeah.. her friends. The Raptor.. Teltoli didn&#39;t hold anything against her, it was just that she had insulted her, Carnage and Dinobot!\n\nShe couldn&#39;t remember much of Dinobot, only a very short and fuzzy memory of him doing something to help her. But by this.. it was enough to go on to beleive Carnage&#39;s words.\n\nBut joining the Maximals? Maybe not. What if she joined Neutral? That way she wouldn&#39;t have to fight anything, accept something that was attacking her. She really didn&#39;t like the idea of hating the Predacons guts, maybe some of them weren&#39;t that bad like the rest?\n\nTeltoli shakes her head, and keeps her focus on the sky, but stores the thoughts away for later pondering..\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
