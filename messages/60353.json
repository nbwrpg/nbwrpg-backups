With little sucsess it crashed \n&gt; into a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pile of sharp energon. A small shrpnel piece was jammed \n&gt; through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protoform slightly oh so slghtly penetrating his spark. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protoform took the shape of a nearby Falcon, but with a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; translucent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body that shined blue. Inside you could see the mechanics at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; work, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet his outter body was the hardest material many had ever \n&gt; seen. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cryaltron pulled himself out of the pod and ran a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diagnostic. &quot;Energon posioning iminent, spark in jeapordy, \n&gt; death \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inevitable.&quot; The shrapel still stuck out of his chest, he \n&gt; broke \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off leaving a crystal like object infront of his doomed \n&gt; spark. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his robot form shoulders were sharp extendesions of energon, \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his fingers and feet. In his falcon form his wings were made \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same. His body was basicly made of hardned energon and the \n&gt; spark \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encased in an energon crystal, the spark slightly ever so \n&gt; &gt; &gt; slighty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pierced in the front of it. &quot;How long do I have?&quot; came an \n&gt; voice \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience, his exact age was unknow but he survived many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wars. &quot;Unclear progression unmeasurable.&quot; Cryatron \n&gt; &gt; &gt; snarled, &quot;Slag \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it!&quot; He transformed into his Falcon mode.
