Please, I beg you, could someone send me and \ne-mail on Thursday, re-capping everything that happened since my last \npost till the RPG. I would owe you so much. Until Thursday, Logo can \nhave Starscream and Vulois, and Yanshosh can have Fliq. I don&#39;t want \nto give the Trainers to anyone. Their too important. CYA Thursday!\n\n\n"}}
