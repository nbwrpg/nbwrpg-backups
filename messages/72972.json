Once the =\r\ngarlic begins to\n&gt; sizzle, lower the heat one notch on the stove.  Once the=\r\n garlic colors\n&gt; slightly, remove it from the skillet and put aside on anot=\r\nher plate, and\n&gt; save it for the end of the cooking process.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4: while w=\r\norking on the garlic in the skillet, quarter three large chicken\n&gt; breasts =\r\nand then slice them into kabob like pieces.  Once this is done, drop\n&gt; it i=\r\nnto the skillet and turn occasionally.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5: As the chicken cooks, prepare=\r\n a handful of fresh sage, and add it to the\n&gt; chicken when it begins to hav=\r\ne a light golden color.  Also re introduce the\n&gt; garlic and add salt, and l=\r\nemon juice.  Saut=E9 until golden brown.\n&gt;\n&gt; And then..  ENJOY.  ^^\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
