Her energy level was stable \nbut nowhere near the needed capacity in order to activate her Second Beast \nMode again, if needed.\nIron Raptor looked at Liono, at least she knew that he was pleased with the \nbattle&#39;s outcome.*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
