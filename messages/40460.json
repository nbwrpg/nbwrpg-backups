Though it&#39;s not in the rules (Yan forgot to add it \nin), \n&gt; holograms are images, and cannot do damage.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 19 Jul 2001, at 20:55, Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The simulation Hellpeon smirked as it flew forward at \nBlacknightmare\n&gt; &gt; and slashed at her with its Chaochitan energy sword a few times \nbefore\n&gt; &gt; launching another large Chaochitan energy at Blacknightmare. For \nher\n&gt; &gt; there was no other escape from here except death, thus was the \npenalty\n&gt; &gt; for failing the test. Meanwhile Blight simply smirked at Darkfate \nand\n&gt; &gt; then turned and headed towards one of the walls.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blight: &quot;They will work. Or you will die. As far as I can see its \na\n&gt; &gt; win-win situation for me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With those words Blight walked through a new opening in the wall \nthat\n&gt; &gt; sealed itself right back up after he left. He was now once again \nin\n&gt; &gt; the main control room of the complex, and soon a transmission was\n&gt; &gt; opened to all of Darkfate&#39;s troops, their frequency was also\n&gt; &gt; discovered when Blacknightmare was scanned. He chuckled somewhat\n&gt; &gt; before his message played over the comm lines of every single \nmember\n&gt; &gt; of Darkfates men.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blight: &quot;This is Blight, of the Infecticons, your commander, \nDarkfate\n&gt; &gt; is now our prisoner. If you do not do as we say, we shall kill \nhim.\n&gt; &gt; You are all to stop with whatever you are doing and are to come \nto the\n&gt; &gt; location of this transmission. You will recieve further orders \nfrom me\n&gt; &gt; then. If you need a landmark... just hover over the big \nwhirlpool.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blight laughed to himself as he then pressed another button. Back \nin\n&gt; &gt; the part of the base Alecto was in, an anti gravity device \nactivated\n&gt; &gt; beneath her and sent her flying out of the chamber and back to \nledger\n&gt; &gt; and co. At that point the whirling water vortex greatly shrank \nleaving\n&gt; &gt; only a small entry point down to the same sealed off section of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; base. And still at the bases&#39; center a massive hole was now in the\n&gt; &gt; ground but all within the hole was metal and electronics beneath \nthat.\n&gt; &gt; And still the nanites continued to build down deeper into the \nalready\n&gt; &gt; seemingly bottomless thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blacknightmare/Darkfate::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blacknightmare felt chaotical energy  struk her but she would \n&gt; &gt; fight; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; she had a lot things to live, she had to destroy Vamprah and  \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most important: She liked to see Orchestra again. Blacknightmare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started to looking for a way to scape... Pain was increasing \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; every second.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Darkfate smirked and said &quot;I will be a prisioner without worth,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unless you try to force the troops that I bring here to work \nfor \n&gt; &gt; you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
