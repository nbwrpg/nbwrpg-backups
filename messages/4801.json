The darkness that enveloped her sleeping form comforting and \nwelcome, but no longer needed. She slowly opened her optics, letting her \neyes adjust to the ark�s artificial light. She stretched, her mouth open in \na wide, wolfen yawn exposing multiple steel teeth. That was the only odd \nthing about her beast mode. Instead of real white, wolf canines, bicuspids \nand the like she had silver titanium teeth. Quite effective when it came to \nhunting. NOt to mention kicking some Pred and Alliance skid plate.\n\nTavatron groaned as she forced herself to stand, still a little groggy from \nher nap. She blinked her eyes several times before sending a com to Iron \nRaptor:\n\n&quot;On my way.&quot;\n\nTavatron left the com open as she gently nudged Dinobot�s neck with her \nsnout to see if he was awake yet. When he failed to respond she leaned close \nto his snout, her ear inches from his massive jaws. She listened for a few \nmoments. When she was satisfied that he was still breathing she pulled her \nhead back. Being so near to such massive jaws unsettled her. Tavatron spoke \ninto her com unit:\n\n&quot;Dinobot is� unavailable at the moment. I, however, will gladly accompany \nyou.&quot;\n\nTavatron stretched one more time before walking on padded paws to the \nmassive ark doors. She took one last look over her shoulder at Dinobot. As \nmuch as she enjoyed his company she didn�t want to wake him from his much \nneeded slumber. She turned back towards the hallway that lay before her, the \nsoft click of her nails on the metallic floor sending a slight shiver down \nher spine. She never did like that sound, an unfortunate drawback of her \nbeastmode. Tavatron walked across the bridge, mentally surveying the damage. \nThey were in dire need of repairs. A pity that such a large base was not so \neasily defended. Tavatron walked through the ark doors, the distant clouds \nthreatening rain.\n\nTavatron gazed up at her commander, the corners of her mouth turned up in a \nslight smile. She was glad to be outdoors, and to be under the command of a \ncompetent leader. She had nothing but the utmost respect for Iron Raptor. \nNot that she had anything against Liono, but even she had to admit that Iron \nRaptor was a skilled warrior and leader. Tavatron then gazed at the \nlandscape before them, calculating how far behind she would have to remain \nin order to stay hidden, but not so far behind as to lose sight of her \ncommander. She sighed softly, awaiting orders.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
