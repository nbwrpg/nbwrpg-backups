Her and love.\n\nBut soon the itch on her nose began to get worse and she brought her breath \nin, stepping out of Prowls arms and trying to pinch her nose to stop the \nsneeze...but it was too late.\nIron Raptor covered her nose, and closed her eyes, sneezing a bit hard.\nBut just as suddenly as she sneezed something happened, something \nsurprising....\nOut from behind her shoulders sprouted two long, full white wings. Feathers \ndrifting from them to catch on the breeze and drift all around both Prowl \nand herself.\nStretching out to thrie limits until equalling more then 3 times be body \nlength.\nIron Raptor leaned back, looking towards Prowl as the wind picked up and \nblew her hair in waves. Feathers floating on the wind, catching currents and \nfloating away.*\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
