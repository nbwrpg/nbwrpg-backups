Then he retaliates with several \n&gt; energy bursts from his laser sword.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jayde yelps and scrambles back, looking for an opening to bring her \n&gt; own nailgun to bear.  Torin, Riekan, and Fury are out of reach for \n&gt; Yggdrasil&#39;s initial attack, but they fight back anyhow: Torin fires \n&gt; his plasma blaster, Riekan launches an explosive harpoon, and Fury \n&gt; (after transforming) opens up with his cybervenom gun.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Seeing Gatara&#39;s gun pointing at him, Yggdrasil is taken between \nnot \n&gt; &gt; moving and seeming like any other tree or moving and opening fire. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t exactly seem like any other tree because the shots will \n&gt; reveal \n&gt; &gt; that he has metal plates all over.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Slag, he thought, they got me now...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unless...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The huge tree moved.

He roared.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil planned to act on intimidation. Since his beast mode was \n&gt; &gt; bigger than his robot mode, and that he was 13 ft tall as a robot, \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; would be achievable. But he wanted to add some effect.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He swung his arms around, breaking the other trees nearby and \n&gt; sending \n&gt; &gt; those tumbling down either in front of him or directly at the \n&gt; Rogues.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, some of Gatara&#39;s shots had hit, but they had done no \n&gt; more \n&gt; &gt; than light armor damage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I want them converted to jamming beacons, then we&#39;ll place them \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; strategic points to knock out all enemy communications and \nsensor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; scans,&quot; Devilcat explains.  &quot;Right now, though, we have to \n&gt; resolve \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some border troubles of our own.
