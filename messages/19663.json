He ducked close to the wall to \nmake\n&gt; himself a smaller target. He scanned for autoguns and when he found \nthier\n&gt; location. Quickly transforming to bot mode  he slid a series of \nmirror chips\n&gt; across the floor.(Another thief trick I learned in other RPGs) Each \nchip\n&gt; would identify itself as him so the autoguns wouldn&#39;t get a lock on \nhim. He\n&gt; knew he&#39;d screwed up, letting his curiosity get the best of him. He \nknew he\n&gt; was safe though, Curiosity only kills cats, and he&#39;s a fox.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;DarkMouse::\n&gt; She still held the gun at close range at FoxFinger. She knew the\n&gt; autoguns were on him.  She smiled. &quot;You know, your either very \nsmart,\n&gt; or very stupid. Your in KitKat&#39;s base now. So, what are you doing\n&gt; here?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Message 2\n&gt; &quot;Getting away I hope.&quot; Foxfingers yelps as he  dove to the ground \nsliding\n&gt; past Darkmouse. He hoped that his mirror chips would confuse the \nautoguns.\n&gt; if they didn&#39;t then the autoguns would have to go through Darkmouse \nto hit\n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sent: Monday, October 30, 2000 6:37 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Foxfingers\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Sorry, I thought Starscream had gone to intercept FoxFingers.  No\n&gt; &gt; matter, it shall be taken care of.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; DarkMouse::\n&gt; &gt; She looked at the monitor with KitKat and the other bot. Then a \nsmall\n&gt; &gt; red light started flashing. She looked at the other screen and \nsaw a\n&gt; &gt; bot trying to sneek in. She grinned,&quot;Oh it looks like I&#39;ll have a\n&gt; &gt; little fun today after all.&quot; She got up and looked at \nDrillbit. &quot;YOu\n&gt; &gt; stay here and tell me what I miss on the conversation. I&#39;ll be \nright\n&gt; &gt; back.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She drew her pistol and walked out. She went down the hallway and\n&gt; &gt; towards the entrance. She stopped just around the corner from the\n&gt; &gt; other bot. She heard his foot falls get sloser. She raised her gun\n&gt; &gt; and jumped out from behind the corner, aiming at the intruder.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;FREEZE OR YOUR DEAD! AUTOGUNS! TAKE AIM!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The autoguns aimed at FoxFingers, but waited for the command to \nfire.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Foxfingers reached the side of Destructors ship. he found an\n&gt; &gt; airvent leading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inside.
