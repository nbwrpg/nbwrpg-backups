How lovely!  I\ndon&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been told how stupid that was by Yanshosh or anyone,\nbut if you haven&#39;t, I&#39;ll tell you.\n&gt;\n&gt; Putting something like that inside an e-mail is ok.  OOC or IC.  But on a\nsubject, that doesn&#39;t fly.  IF you do that again, you will be penalized\nheavily)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
