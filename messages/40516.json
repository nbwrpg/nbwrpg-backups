The hologram does damage to \nher mind which is represented as blacknightmare. What happens to her \nthere happens to her in the pod.

Blacknightmare is in a simulation type \nthing\n&gt; &gt; where hjer body is actually in a capsule of sort.

Though it&#39;s not in the rules (Yan forgot to add it \n&gt; &gt; in), \n&gt; &gt; &gt; holograms are images, and cannot do damage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On 19 Jul 2001, at 20:55, Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The simulation Hellpeon smirked as it flew forward at \n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and slashed at her with its Chaochitan energy sword a few \ntimes \n&gt; &gt; before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; launching another large Chaochitan energy at Blacknightmare. \nFor \n&gt; &gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there was no other escape from here except death, thus was \nthe \n&gt; &gt; penalty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for failing the test. Meanwhile Blight simply smirked at \nDarkfate \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then turned and headed towards one of the walls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blight: &quot;They will work.

He was now once \nagain \n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the main control room of the complex, and soon a transmission \nwas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opened to all of Darkfate&#39;s troops, their frequency was also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discovered when Blacknightmare was scanned. He chuckled \nsomewhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before his message played over the comm lines of every single \n&gt; &gt; member\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Darkfates men.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blight: &quot;This is Blight, of the Infecticons, your commander, \n&gt; &gt; Darkfate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is now our prisoner.

You will recieve further \norders \n&gt; &gt; from me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. If you need a landmark... just hover over the big \n&gt; &gt; whirlpool.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blight laughed to himself as he then pressed another button. \nBack \n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the part of the base Alecto was in, an anti gravity device \n&gt; &gt; activated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beneath her and sent her flying out of the chamber and back \nto \n&gt; &gt; ledger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and co. At that point the whirling water vortex greatly \nshrank \n&gt; &gt; leaving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only a small entry point down to the same sealed off section \nof \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; base. And still at the bases&#39; center a massive hole was now \nin the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ground but all within the hole was metal and electronics \nbeneath \n&gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And still the nanites continued to build down deeper into the \n&gt; &gt; already\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seemingly bottomless thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blacknightmare/Darkfate::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blacknightmare felt chaotical energy  struk her but she \nwould \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she had a lot things to live, she had to destroy Vamprah \nand  \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most important: She liked to see Orchestra again. \nBlacknightmare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started to looking for a way to scape...
