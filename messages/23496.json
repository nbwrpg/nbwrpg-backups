LOL I don&#39;t exactly wanna start out an\nRPG with no=\r\n-one to RPG -with-. :D\n\nI&#39;ll attach my profile down the bottom.. *_*\n\n~*~*~=\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\n\nThe gentle si=\r\nlence of the night was broken sharply by the sound of a Status\nPod suddenly=\r\n zipping through the sky and crash landing on the soft Earth.\nBirds squawke=\r\nd and flew off, startled, and flapped their way to a possibly\nmore peaceful=\r\n area.\n\nThe moonlight reflected off the polished metal, only marred by a sl=\r\night dirt\nscrape. The DNA scanner opened the panel and slid upwards, sendin=\r\ng out an\nelectronic wave.\n\n::DNA found:: It reported, and slid back into th=\r\ne Pod. It clicked and\nwhirred for a few minutes, then the lid cracked open =\r\nwith a hiss. A shadow\nclimbed out, it=92s movements cautious.\n\nWhat little =\r\nlight there was showed a dark black panther, with silver/black\nwings attach=\r\ned to it=92s shoulder blades. Her emerald green eyes glittered in\nthe low l=\r\night, and she darted a few quick looks around her to make sure she\nwasn&#39;t g=\r\noing to be attack or anything like that.\n\nA glimmer of light caught her Max=\r\nimal mark, but she found herself wondering\nwhy she was with the Maximals. T=\r\nhe last time she was here, they had bene led\nby Liono Prime. The bot smirke=\r\nd a little, and sat down in her Panther/Hawk\nmode, waiting a little before =\r\nshe could travel.\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*=\r\n~*~*~*~*~\n\nName: Teltoli SilverWing\n\nGender: Female\n\nBeast Mode Characteris=\r\ntics: As a Panther/Hawk Fuzor, Teltoli has the body of\na panther, with silv=\r\ner =91socks=92 on her four paws. Her eyes are emerald green.\nFrom her shoul=\r\nder blades are two large wings, also black with silver marks.\n\nBot Mode Cha=\r\nracteristics: In her Bot mode, Teltoli is also black with green\neyes, and s=\r\nilver on her arms that look like elbow-length gloves, and silver\nringlets o=\r\nn her ankles. She is very pretty, in a girlish sort of way. Her\nfaded gray =\r\nMaximal mark is on the outside top of her right leg. Her face is\nfaintly ca=\r\nt-tish, with the two rounded ears on top of her head, and faint\nwhisker mar=\r\nks. Her black wings also stay on her back in Bot Mode, so she can\nfly.\n\nWea=\r\npons: The panther tail turns into a whip with a long scythe-like blade at\nt=\r\nhe end. From her wings, come two long rapiers that she can use with deadly\n=\r\naccuracy.\n\nPersonality: Teltoli is a kind, caring Bot, easy to love and be =\r\nloved with\nall her heart, and acts a lot like a small child in the way of i=\r\nnnocence.\nBut sometimes that gets her in trouble when she=92s in battle. Ho=\r\nwever, once\nshe is fired up for a fight, she will go down to the end for he=\r\nr friends and\nleader.\nHer father was a great warrior, and taught her many o=\r\nf his moves, and her\nmother taught her others things, like healing with her=\r\nbs when one was\nrunning low on power.\n\n------------------\nTeltoli SilverWin=\r\ng\nPanther/Hawk Fuzor\n\n\n______________________________________________\nFREE =\r\nPersonalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=3Dsignup\n=\r\n\n"}}
