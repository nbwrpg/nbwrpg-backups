Now, that&#39;s totally up to you if ya want the=\r\n \n&gt; training, just see me after we get repaired, and I&#39;ll set up a training=\r\n \n&gt; program for ya. Hmm, maybe Rodimus might wanna join in on it too..

The reason why it didn&#39;t work on Tucson or me, is \n&gt; that Master Yoki=\r\ntron&#39;s training sorta prepared us spiritually for what could \n&gt; come down t=\r\nhe pike. Clear minds empty of thoughts are less likely ta get \n&gt; infected b=\r\ny negative influences, simply because there&#39;s no thought energy ta \n&gt; hold =\r\nonto. Clear mind, clear soul, clear spark. Bad stuff just goes in one \n&gt; wa=\r\ny, and out the other. You guys had a lot on your minds when Hydras took \n&gt; =\r\nyou. And that couldn&#39;t be helped, but now it can be. I bet my spark plugs \n=\r\n&gt; that if you and Rodimus train with me, I can get both of ya up ta our lev=\r\nel \n&gt; and that&#39;ll make you a pair of the strongest Autobots this side of th=\r\ne \n&gt; galaxy, but not the type of strength most warriors perceive. This type=\r\n of \n&gt; strength is the strength of spirit, inner peace, and harmony. A perf=\r\nect \n&gt; balance between spark, soul, and mind. And yeah, there&#39;s a lotta dex=\r\nterity \n&gt; aquired in Ninjabot training, the type of dexterity that makes ev=\r\nen Tucson \n&gt; Prime a bit different then the traditional Autobot Commander. =\r\nIt&#39;s a \n&gt; difference Hydras has no inclination how ta fend off.

I need new hydraulic shock \n&gt; absorbers, =\r\ntiming belt, and I know my struts need work, new tires, body \n&gt; work, and T=\r\ny Rods fixed. Oh yeah, need a new front and back end alignment \n&gt; too.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; To repair the damgages to his alt form, he now transforms into his vehicl=\r\ne \n&gt; mode, to prepare for the rest of his repairs. He also notices a busted=\r\n \n&gt; headlight on the left side.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Scrap, throw in a new headlight for t=\r\nhe left side, new bumpers, front, \n&gt; back, side, and awww slag, transmissio=\r\nn&#39;s actn&#39; up. Probably because I \n&gt; smacked that tree real hard in alt form=\r\n. After this is all done, I am so \n&gt; gonna give those preds the bill, liter=\r\nally. In other words, I need a total \n&gt; overhaul ta my alt form.

And that=\r\n couldn&#39;t be helped, but now it can be.  I bet my spark plugs &lt;br&gt;\nthat if =\r\nyou and Rodimus train with me, I can get both of ya up ta our level &lt;br&gt;\nan=\r\nd that&#39;ll make you a pair of the strongest Autobots this side of the &lt;br&gt;\ng=\r\nalaxy, but not the type of strength most warriors perceive.  This type of &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nstrength is the strength of spirit, inner peace, and harmony.  A perfec=\r\nt &lt;br&gt;\nbalance between spark, soul, and mind.  And yeah, there&#39;s a lotta de=\r\nxterity &lt;br&gt;\naquired in Ninjabot training, the type of dexterity that makes=\r\n even Tucson &lt;br&gt;\nPrime a bit different then the traditional Autobot Comman=\r\nder.  It&#39;s a &lt;br&gt;\ndifference Hydras has no inclination how ta fend off. THA=\r\nT&#39;S the direction &lt;br&gt;\nTucson is gonna take, and if you guys were trained i=\r\nn our art, so more power &lt;br&gt;\nto ya.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHe then looks to Bump, as th=\r\ne repair bench does its job to repair the &lt;br&gt;\ninternal damages done to him=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; Speakn&#39; of performance, that reminds me...  I need new hydraul=\r\nic shock &lt;br&gt;\nabsorbers, timing belt, and I know my struts need work, new t=\r\nires, body &lt;br&gt;\nwork, and Ty Rods fixed.  Oh yeah, need a new front and bac=\r\nk end alignment &lt;br&gt;\ntoo.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo repair the damgages to his alt form,=\r\n he now transforms into his vehicle &lt;br&gt;\nmode, to prepare for the rest of h=\r\nis repairs.  He also notices a busted &lt;br&gt;\nheadlight on the left side.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Scrap, throw in a new headlight for the left side, new bumpers, front=\r\n, &lt;br&gt;\nback, side, and awww slag, transmission&#39;s actn&#39; up.  Probably becaus=\r\ne I &lt;br&gt;\nsmacked that tree real hard in alt form. After this is all done, I=\r\n am so &lt;br&gt;\ngonna give those preds the bill, literally.  In other words, I =\r\nneed a total &lt;br&gt;\noverhaul ta my alt form.  And if you can help it, I&#39;d lik=\r\ne ta hold onta this &lt;br&gt;\none for a while.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrp=\r\ng@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight S=\r\ntood up And leave her daughter in the bed, she smiled and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sa=\r\nid&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to her daughter &quot;I be righ back in  no time, just remain h=\r\nere&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes Mommie&quot;said happily Elita&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight smiled and she walked toward the interior of th=\r\ne cr, she &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; looked&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to Bump and said &quot;I&#39;m ready, =\r\ncould you add any defensive skills that I &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; may&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nneed?? please&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; BUMP looked =\r\nat NIGHTLIGHT quizzically, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; manipulated a fe=\r\nw controls on his screen. &quot;If you are looking for a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; specific abili=\r\nty, I can see what I can do, but as far as skills, that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is somethi=\r\nng you learn.
