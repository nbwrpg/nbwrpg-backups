How can we stop them????&quot;sid anxiously Quetzalcoatl &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Mirage knew better. &quot;Don&#39;t stand there man RUN!&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Sludge tranformed and began whipping his tail around and barely missed &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Mirage &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;as the bot ducked and slid out of the cargo bay. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Swoop was still in bot mode as he began firing his rifle around him ... &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Snarl and Slag began ripping the C R chambers apart soon only the sealed one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;remained... &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Grimlock turned. &quot;DinoBots Stop!&quot; Grimlock turned to the new bot. &quot;You Fix, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;You give back Hard skin!&quot; He pointed at the chamber growling holding the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;gigantic sword. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;QUETZAL COATL: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Quetzalcoatl had a sudden idea said camly the bot while he crawled towards &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;the T-rex&nbsp;&quot;Grimlock, do you wish to&nbsp;destroy decepticons and Preds?&nbsp;&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Grimlock turned. &quot;What Preds?&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Mirage listened in, he was a scout, a spy, he wasn&#39;t a warrior. He didn&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;want his body busted up any more then he wanted his indy form dented. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;others walked over and soon stood around the single bot... &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;QUETZALCOATL: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Preds&#39;re deceandent of Decepticons.... Autobots have desendeantes too: The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Maximals.&quot;replied Kindly the male, he tought a little and added&quot;Our records &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;said that a party of maxis, preds and a faction that was giving trouble in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Cybertron: the Tripedocus are here. Also a party of Decepticons and some old &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Autobots too. Your old form its ok, but here is inadecuate, you see: here &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;exist a bunch of&nbsp;energon and it could hurt you in your old form. But this &lt;BR&gt;&gt;one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;will help you a lot here and also &quot;the box&quot; though that this form it&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt;better &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&#39;cause it doesn&#39;t like that anyone of you result hurt or even dead.&nbsp;Also, it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;improved a lot of your old weapon &#39;cause we need keep away the Preds and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Deceps from the &quot; Ark&nbsp;&quot; where Prime&nbsp;is. Curent Council wants that&nbsp;&quot;Ark&quot;&nbsp;stay &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;without chance until our sleeping fellows, wake up in several years ago.... &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;When mission ends, we will left this timeline and &quot;the &nbsp;box &quot; can revert the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;changes&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Quetzalcoatl hoped that the explanation calm down the dino- bots &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Grimlock punched the C R chamber and the status light blinked and began to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;count down. &quot;Me GrimLock Want hard skin back, Then me smash Decepticons.&quot; He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;raised his fist as the chamber door opened slowly showing the outline of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;last member of the team. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&quot;LOOK OUT, GRIMLOCK!!!!&quot;shouted the male &quot;Or you will hurt a fellow!!!!&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;A large hand reached out and caught Grimlocks fist. &quot;No worries Little one.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;The figure walked out standing taller then all the others. Scourge smiled as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;best he could as his face plate lifted and his eyes glowed blue. He stood a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;good 12 feet tall, but his shoulders gave him the appearance of at least 14 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;feet. He was all black and like grimlock carried a large sword, he looked &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;like as if he could have been optimus&#39; twin brother... He He turned to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;mirage. &quot;Hey you ok out there?&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Mirage smiled and waved his hand sheepishly. &quot;yeah.&quot; &nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&quot;Sir... I...&quot;crawled Qutezalcoatl in his beast mode towards the male &quot;Are &lt;BR&gt;&gt;you.. all right??&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Scourge looked down at Quetzalcoatl. &quot;Affirmative Autobot, Now lets complete &lt;BR&gt;&gt;this mission.&quot; He walked outside and turned to Grimlock. &quot;Follow and protect &lt;BR&gt;&gt;the rear muscle head.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;GrimLock growled. &quot;Me King, Me no...&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&quot;Prime put me in command himself you wanna question that!&quot; Scourge stood face &lt;BR&gt;plate to face plate with the Dinobot... &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Quetzalcoatl sighed and tought&quot;Why aren&#39;t dinobots smartest?&quot; and said &quot;Sir, according with datums that I got from the remained files of the council... It seems that a party of Maxis and preds are here too...&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Scourge cracked his knuckles. &quot;Always ready to beat new people.&quot; He walked outside and looked around. &quot;Quetzalcoatl, which way to the ark?&quot;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;QUETZALCOATL:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Sir, I don&#39;t like said anything against you say...&quot;replied Quet&quot;But, tru problem are Preds...
