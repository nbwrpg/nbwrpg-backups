One of them is an\n&gt;owl, and the other is a lion that is part of Magnaboss. This Prowl is the\n&gt;owl, but he has a fairly strange history, probably different from the \n&gt;toy&#39;s,\n&gt;and I&#39;d doupt he and Bluestreak could possible be brothers, but IM me if \n&gt;you\n&gt;have any comments.\n&gt;\n&gt;::Prowl/Striker::\n&gt;\n&gt;Prowl looks at Iron Raptor, as she places her hand on his arm. &quot;Actually I\n&gt;have no idea what I&#39;m doing. You&#39;re third in command, I was hoping you&#39;d \n&gt;take\n&gt;over from here,&quot; he says, feeling slightly stupid. He turns to Rhinox, not\n&gt;hearing the sleepy murmurings from Cyber Claw.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;I have read about you in data logs back on Cybertron. There are plenty of \n&gt;us\n&gt;here, but they havn&#39;t got here yet.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;At that point, Striker walks into the room, nearly crashing into Cyber Claw\n&gt;in the proccess. He looks at her, surprised. &quot;Welcome, I don&#39;t believe we\n&gt;met.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
