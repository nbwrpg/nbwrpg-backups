He\nstayed with Hydras, always attempting to keep himself between him\nHydras and Tankor, his optics glowing watchfully. The fuzors on the\nother hand were not so happy with the orders. There were a few\ngrumbles and angry faces, but they generally complied with Hydras as\nwell.\n\nTerrorsaur just looked at Tarantulus for a moment as if sharing some\ninternal thought, but then, like the others they appeared to follow\nsuit, lowering weapons and readiying to follow.\n\n&quot;Me no like Tank-bots.&quot; Waspinator said, some how voicing the opinion\nof many, as he glanced at the many muzzles that seemed to be pointed\nin his direction. He sighed as he stood next to Hydras.\n\n&quot;Good choice.&quot; Tankor said after Hydras gave his commands to the his\nsoldiers. Tankor gestured to the other tank drones with him, and they\ncircled around like soldiers guarding some sort of convoy. &quot;Come.&quot;\nTankor said as he too shifted into vehicular mode. Several tanks\npositioned themselves infront of Hydras&#39; crew while others were\nbehind, tankor beside them.\n\n(OOC: Assuming that Hydras does follow . . . )\n\nWith that Tankor began to lead them all back towards the city. In the\ndistance several jets swooped over the city, looking like giant agile\nvultures as they dipped up and down at various points.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
