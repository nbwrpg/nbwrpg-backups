Literally! Amphorbasis!&quot;\n\nWith that one word each head began to crackle with energy as the tail \ndid as well. A second later each head sent out an energizen beam of \nfire and liquid Nitrogen before the tail sent out a blast of \nelectricity. Each blast then combined and swirled in the air before a \nsingular massive blast flew straight down at Trainwreck. Nearby Zero \nReaches methos and glares as he grabs his shoulder and spins him \naround to meet his glare.\n\nZero: &quot;So we meet again... perhaps we are destined to clash... Let&#39;s \nfinish this!&quot;\n\nWith those words Zero slams his Energy blade into the blade of \nMethos&#39;s energy scythe each bot pushing into their weapons to through \nthe other one off balanca.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; After the attacks, Train Wreck&#39;s outer surface was black and his \nwheels were smashed in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Train Wreck: That all ya got?...\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Legendarynemasis@a... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, July 14, 2001 8:44 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Clash\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Vile smirks as he watches Trainwreck sustain the firepower, \nhowever he would \n&gt;   not be able to do that for much longer. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Vile: &quot;Gemini, form the Gemini Dragon and teach this train to \nhave respect \n&gt;   for the past!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Gemini 1 and 2 nod before each leaps up high into the air and \nglows. The \n&gt;   clouds above begins to swirl. Thunder begins to crackle as the \nsounds of \n&gt;   transforming can be heard from a above a second later the clouds \nliterally \n&gt;   are sent scattering as a massive &quot;meched out&quot; double headed \ndragon around 45 \n&gt;   feet tall descends from them, its massive wings flapping wildly \nas 18 square \n&gt;   like objects surround it. Both heads roar loudly and then speak \nat the same \n&gt;   time their voice having an echo to it. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Gemini Dragon: &quot;Destruction shall be dealt unto all...&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Vile looks up at the massive beast and smirks before he flys back \nand away \n&gt;   from Trainwreck a nice Distance. Methos who is ontop of \nTrainwreck also looks \n&gt;   up at Gemini Dragon. He then somehow sweatdrops and then flys off \nTrainwreck \n&gt;   as if he was being chased by an army of Maximals with spark \nextractors. Up in \n&gt;   the air the Gemini Dragon&#39;s right head shoots forward and \nunleashes a massive \n&gt;   stream of flame at Trainwreck, at the same time the left head \nshoots out a \n&gt;   nice large stream of liquid Nitrogen at the wheels of the chosen \nmafia \n&gt;   member... From the front Vile unleashes another two antimatter \nblasts at \n&gt;   Trainwreck. \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo! Terms of \nService.\n\n\n"}}
