He growled in mind speak ::Diablo, \n&gt; Transform!::\n&gt; \n&gt; His Bot mode Dark Blue and Midnight Black. He legs are strong, and \n&gt; sturdy, supporting a spike at the knee which can be driven into \n&gt; opponents. His chest is plain, rippled with muscles, leading to his \n&gt; arms which at the elbows have another two spikes. His face remains \n&gt; the same, except for the fact the fur gives way to dark blue metal \n&gt; and the stalk eyes vanish.\n&gt; \n&gt; Diablo took out his scythe with his left hand and a huge machine \ngun \n&gt; in his right. The machine gun had poison loaded darts that would \n&gt; explode on contact. He fired off 25 poison bullets at WindLord.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Windlord::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I figured that...&quot; replied the hawk and he took off in robot \nmode \n&gt; &gt; and pointed his feathers-missiles towards Devil and shot.\n\n\n"}}
