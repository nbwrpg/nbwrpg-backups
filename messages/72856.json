Doing his\n&gt;&gt; bidding?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It was always known that despite his fierce streak of independence\n&gt;&gt; MAGMATRON was a Predacon at heart and some believed that he got his\n&gt;&gt; start among the DECEPTICON ranks in the days long before the peace\n&gt;&gt; accord working for the original MEGATRON.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He had definitely spent some time working with this MEGATRON, but that\n&gt;&gt; was long before the PREDACONS and MAXIMALS had actually come to the\n&gt;&gt; EARTH itself.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson inches just a little bit closer to Drill Bit, with a heavy and\n&gt; serious stance.  As each clawed foot touches the ground, dust kicks up just\n&gt; from the mere action of him putting them down.  Claws click against the\n&gt; surface of the cave&#39;s floor, as a thwapping of his tail can be heard as\n&gt; slaps against the hard surface it was coming in contact with.\n&gt;\n&gt; The dragon growls.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You heard my comrade.  Identify yourself.   Are you friend or foe?&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Drillbit&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a quiet laugh from DRILL BIT, &quot;Your comrades have bought our\n&gt; assistance, for now.  The Maximals agreed for our assistance to rescue you\n&gt; in return for a stasis pod and a sparked protoform after this is over, sworn\n&gt; on the Matrix.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; An outright lie - DINOBOT had wanted it, but LEO PRIME had essentially beat\n&gt; him down over it.  But right now, there were seeds of chaos to sow for DRILL\n&gt; BIT as the MAXIMALS would probably be rushing down the tunnel in a swarm\n&gt; then. A ll teh while to try and stir up some chaos when hte two groups\n&gt; &#39;met&#39;.  &quot;And we are here to rescue you all.  Tel lme, how was you stay now?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;No, tell me that Leo Prime wouldn&#39;t trade the life of a protoform for\nworking with the Predacons?&quot; MACH KICK looked so sad and hurt as he\nthought of it.\n\nBREAK grunted, &quot;I don&#39;t believe it! Leo would have to tell me to my\nface that same story before I believe it.&quot;\n\nBIG CONVOY looked at TUSCON, &quot;You&#39;re working with Leo Prime. I heard\nhe was sent to Earth. Do you believe this . . . this Predacon!?!&quot;\n\nThere was indeed a level of confusion sewn among them, even if it was\nvarying levels of disbelief and questionings.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
