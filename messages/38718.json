The reptillian beast stalked through the\n&gt; cave hunting his unsuspecting prey. Necromancers scent was strong, the\n&gt; mutant knew that his DNA doner was near, Looking over a series of\n&gt; Stalactites he creapt closer. From where he was he could see what he&#39;d\ncome\n&gt; for. Somehow the Mutant hadn&#39;t suspected that the hunt would end this\n&gt; easily, or this quickly. The mighty T-Rex dove forward biting down on what\n&gt; he believed was his enemy. His attitude quickly changed with the\nrealization\n&gt; that all he had was a pile of shedded scales. &quot;So you&#39;ve gotten rid of\nyour\n&gt; old form. That won&#39;t save you, one day soon I will execute you like the\n&gt; inferior unit you are.&quot; The mutants insanity was obvious but his logic\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be denied.
