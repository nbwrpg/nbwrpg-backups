They were confused, but ran back up to her.\n\n&quot;My namie is Fliq, and this is Bronco. We brought back the pods with \nRamulus.(DID Ramulus bring them back while I was gone? If they didn&#39;t \ntell me, so I can scratch everything I did and wait for Yanshosh to \ncome back.) We know your name because Ramulus told us the story about \nthe attack you guys suffered when getting the pod. We thought you had \nseen us arrive. We knew this was you because we heard somebody call \nthe other bird-like bot Shadow-Wing. So, we&#39;re friendly and all we \nwant to do is get some parts for the ship. It&#39;ll never fly again, of \ncourse, but it will make it almost impermiable. So what do you say?&quot;\n\n(In the future we might have a big task. When we finaly finish this \nstory and get ready to start the next, we have to leave everything as \nthe way it was for G1, meaning we&#39;d have to find someway of getting \nThe Ark to the volcano. I know it&#39;s probably years from now, but I \nlike pointing out the obvious.)\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n\nVulois looked at the three new bots, and agve them their assignement.\n\n&quot;From now on, you three will be known as The Peace Angels.
