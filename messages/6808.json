She had heard Tavatron�s words, actually worried that she would start struggling again and then they might end up dead. But her own careless actions had almost cost the same thing, she knew better now.*\n\n� Its� OK, Tavatron. I�m all right. Just worry about yourself, I can take care of myself.�\n\n* Her tone was forced, calm and in an official order. Out-weighing Punch�s tone of superiority, her own position in the Maximal forces giving her plenty of practice. Her purpose was to make Tavatron believe that she was truly all right, even though she was in the worst situation she had ever been in.\nBut as her own tone died away she then felt Dark One move to hit her again, simply moving her head again so that this time he hit her collar plates instead. But instead of simply letting it pass she then snapped out towards Dark One�s hand, her teeth baring down upon the top of his hand. Her jaws close enough to feel the breath from her lungs.\nShe had smartened up but she wasn�t about to let anyone touch her, eager jaws ready to snap at what ever touched her.\nThey had to learn that lesson sooner or later, not to come too close.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
