He left us to die. Now it&#39;s time to repay him \nfor whst he did. I was loyal to him, and he deserted us. No, he \ndeserves to die. Let&#39;s go to the old cave, then find Megatron. It&#39;a \npayback time.&quot;   She transfomed into wolf mode and looked up at \nPhobia. &quot;I&#39;ll be ok. I&#39;ll not die before my revenge is taken.&quot;  She \nopened her link. &quot;Drillbit, Phobia and I are getting ready to leave \nfor the old cave to meet the others there. Please come with us.&quot;\n\nShe closed her link and looked at Phobia,&quot;Don&#39;t tell Drillbit this, \nbut if I get captured, kill me and put him in charge. i don&#39;t want to \nbe used against my group. Got that Phobia? No leverage for our \nenemies.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Phobia looked to the sky as if it had all the right answers, the \nsky stared\n&gt; back mockingly not revealing it&#39;s vast knowlege. &quot;You&#39;re the wolf, \nyou\n&gt; should be able to find his scent.&quot; he stood at the edge of a sloping\n&gt; landscape looking out to the horizon. &quot;The Alliance and Starscream \nare\n&gt; meeting us at the old cave.&quot; How&#39;re you holding up?&quot; he placed a \nhand on her\n&gt; chin &quot;Any second thoughts about destroying the piece of slag?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
