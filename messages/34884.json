That would be a waste. If she destroyed him now then she \ncouldn�t come back and feed later.\nBetter to take only what she needed.\nDesmonus ran a forked tongue over her scaled lips; she could just taste the \nmech fluid now!\nBut soon, the rubble of the CF came into view and she dropped from the sky. \nBetter to be stealthy then stupid. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
