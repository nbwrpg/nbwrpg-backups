Hydras has\n&gt; &gt; fused Megatron&#39;s deceptiveness with Galvatron&#39;s insanity! He \nplays\n&gt; &gt; everyone for his own personal advancement. You seem bright; \nyou&#39;d do\n&gt; &gt; well to step out of the way... That&#39;s not what Alpha Trion has \nplanned\n&gt; &gt; for you anyways, don&#39;t you think?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He grinned and waited for her reaction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her crimson optics glowed brightly. Angering her. Then growled \naloud with a \n&gt; mixed cry from a tiger & hawk an odd screech that was deafening.\n&gt; \n&gt; As she aimed at Tyrael once more, dodging one feather, but the \nother hit her \n&gt; arm, inbedding into the left shoulder. \n&gt; \n&gt; Growling in pain, then turning back to Tyrael as she tossed away \nthe rifle. \n&gt; Then whipped out 2 energy swords she barely uses. One small like \nthe size of a \n&gt; bayonet, the other the size of a cavalry saber. \n&gt; \n&gt; Despite her wounds, she started a charge towards Tyrael, despite \nhe was in \n&gt; the air. &quot;Come to face a REAL Decepticon, Tyrael!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Pausing, &quot;Alpha Trion does NOT govern MY fate!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
