But she braces herself.\n&gt; \n&gt; But then at Reptilicas report that they were merged again she \nslowly gets to \n&gt; her feet, hanging onto the wall for support just in case the base \ndecided to \n&gt; shake again.\n&gt; Though, Desmonus turnes her amber optics towards Reptilica.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; But why did we have to relocate in the first place. I thought \nthat we had \n&gt; already chosen our landing spot the last time we set down?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Desmonus steps away from the wall a bit, but keeping a bit close \nto it \n&gt; just to make sure she had something to support her if something \nelse \n&gt; happened.\n&gt; She began to dust off her armor and her wings, looking behind to \nmake sure \n&gt; there weren&#39;t any smudges on her rear.\n&gt; Nothing.\n&gt; Desmonus looked towards Bloodystrike as he turned his gaze towards \nher.\n&gt; But glad that at least it was the drink he was after at the moment.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Sounds good to me.
