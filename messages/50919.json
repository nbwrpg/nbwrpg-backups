Due to being a former WCW(a wrest=\r\nling company) in 1996, I have decided I will join the New World Order.  I w=\r\nill make characters for other groups soon though.  Seeing as how they like =\r\nto base their characters on wrestlers, I will stick with the trend.  I&#39;m no=\r\nt sure how many characters we are allowed to have, but it looks like some p=\r\neople have a small handful, so I will just start off with three.
