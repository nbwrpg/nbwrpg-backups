She groaned at the pain inher chest \nand body.  She tried to think about how to attackthe maximals and get \nback at them for all they had done to her team.  First, they needed a \nbase. Then again,  They may only need the cave for cover.  She \nthought about keeping her pack more on the move.  Keep the cave for \nrepairs and stashing supplies.  She could keep them a moble unit and \nattacke the maximals randomly and not worry about them attacking \nthier base, for they wouldn&#39;t have a technical base.  And allt he \nsupplies int he cave could be kept so it could be moved out at a \nmoments notice.  She smiled at her idea.  It could work, she thought.\n\nShe coughed and groaned at the pain.  She felt her body go numb for a \nbit.  And for a brief moment, she didn&#39;t feel any pain as she fell \ninto the darkness of sleep.  She entered a deep sleep.\n\n\n"}}
