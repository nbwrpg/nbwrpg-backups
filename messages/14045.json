She \nrose and returned fire on Stronghold and Doom Ice.\n\n\n\nKitKat  redeived several shots to the shoulder and chest.  She fell \ndown and layed on the ground near the entrance of the cave.  She \ncalled to the computer,&quot;OPEN FIRE IN MAXIMAL SIGNATURES!&quot; She layed \nthere breathing hard and trying to catch her breath.  She wondered \nwhy she always got so darned beat up in battle.  She thought thaqt \none of these days, those maximals would get lucky and get her foe \ngood.  But not today.  She rose to her knees and returned fire.\n\nThe computer opened autogun fire on Deemos, Doom Ice, StrongHold, \nRazopas, and all the other Maximals.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Stronghold was hit and just grunted. Blender ran to him to protect \nhim. Doom\n&gt; Ice took the shots for Deemos, she was weakening. Doom Ice fired a \nshot at\n&gt; Goldeneye.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Damn bird, just give up and give him to us!&quot; Deemos yelled...\n\n\n\n"}}
