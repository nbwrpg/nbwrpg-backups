But no=\r\n, all four of those WWF members \n  you listed would still talent even if th=\r\ney lost every match against the \n  &#39;Alliance&#39;, coincidentally a name for tw=\r\no major evils IRL and IC :).  \n  Alliance members have no talent, save the =\r\nWWF superstars that went over to \n  it.  They pretty much have no charisma,=\r\n the WWF superstars do.  Tajiri alone \n  is more colorful than every WCW co=\r\nmbined, save Booker T.  Booker T. has some, \n  but with moves like the spin=\r\nerooni, to me, he&#39;s just a joke.  Especially \n  since he&#39;s copying the rock=\r\n bottom and giving it some name like the &quot;book \n  in&quot;.  How the hell does B=\r\nooker come up with such lame names?  Good Leppard...\n\n  Watching WCW on cab=\r\nle, when it was on, caused me to fall asleep.  Good \n  Leppard, how it was =\r\nboring.  Bringing in those wrestlers who did no \n  interesting moves.  The =\r\nannouncers were as irritating as Paul Heyman&#39;s voice. \n   The referees were=\r\n as bland as the WCW &#39;superstars&#39;.  That&#39;s why it should&#39;ve \n  been called =\r\n&quot;We Can&#39;t Wrestle&quot;.\n\n  &quot;Robert Van Dam is a rising athlete.&quot;  Sorry, but I =\r\ndon&#39;t like wrestlers \n  being shoved down my throat to try and make me like=\r\n them.  It&#39;s bad enough \n  his costume sucks, much like all of the WCW and =\r\nits intros.  Heh, probably \n  the best fighter in the Alliance is Shane O&#39;M=\r\nac and that&#39;s because he&#39;s WWF \n  material. \n\n  The Rock is the greatest wr=\r\nestler ever.  He isn&#39;t shoved down people&#39;s \n  throats, he has more charism=\r\na than anyone, he&#39;s funny, and best of all, he&#39;s \n  got killer moves and co=\r\nuld kick anyone&#39;s ass in real life.  I know someone \n  might say &quot;the Rock =\r\nis being crammed down my throat&quot; so I just wanted to say \n  that.  Anyone w=\r\nho disagrees is just plain in the grip of idiocy.\n\n  Has there ever been a =\r\ngood WCW coming over to the WWF?  Not really.  The \n  Radicalz? Nah.  Benoi=\r\nt, Guerrero, and that fat guy who kept acting like a \n  Casa Nova, no.  Per=\r\nry Saturn...he&#39;s not a good wrestler but he&#39;s funny with \n  his insane act.=\r\n  We needed someone to replace Al Snow in that department.\n\n  ECW has had s=\r\neveral good wrestlers come over.  Tazz, Rhyno, and the Dudley \n  Boyz.  But=\r\n the Alliance still sucks.  That&#39;s why the script had WWF \n  superstars go =\r\nover there.  WCW losers fighting the WWF?  Ha!  Kane and \n  Undertaker coul=\r\nd take &#39;em all out.  \n\n  Booker T&#39;s been WCW champion five times?  Wow.  Ro=\r\nck&#39;s been WWF champion six \n  times.  And a WWF title is worth five WCW tit=\r\nles.  I had an earlier \n  conversation about this over IM, wish I&#39;d saved i=\r\nt so I could just copy and \n  paste.)\n\n  - L.
