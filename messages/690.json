The shot hits the entrance of the \ncave that Zenyak had thrown them into and several rocks fall, blocking the \nway out. Shredder looks over at Zenyak.\n\n&quot;To the death, Zenyak. Using swords. Use of guns would cause a cave in, and \nwe&#39;d both probably die,&quot; Striker says.\n\n&quot;Very well!&quot; Zenyak says, puts his gun away, and launches himself at Shredder \nwith his sword slashing.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl jumps out of the way of Mosquitor&#39;s shot. &quot;You should really warn your \nopponent before doing that, you know?&quot; Prowl says, firing back at Mosquitor.\n\nThe stupid bug ducks with a confused expression on his face. &quot;We&#39;re in \nbattle. Why would we warn each other?&quot; He asks, firing back.\n\nProwl rolls out of the way. &quot;Because,&quot; He says, firing a shot at Mosquitor, \n&quot;It is good manners.&quot; Prowl grins when he sees that this is confusing the bug.\n\nMosquitor blink, trying to sort it all out. &quot;But battle isn&#39;t good manners. \nGood manners in a battle are not...&quot; He blinks again as he totaly confuses \nhimself, forgets to dodge a shot from Prowl, and stumbles backward.\n\nProwl chuckles, firing a few more shots at Mosquitor, who rolls out of the \nway behind a boulder.\n\n"}}
