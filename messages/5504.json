He\n&gt; grumbled as he saw it zip away. He had his tail up high, and targeting. He\n&gt; swayed it left and right, watching a handful of fish near-by his boulder.\nHe\n&gt; tail hissed in frustration, having no luck.\n&gt;\n&gt; He plunged his claw down again, and the fish scattered. He cursed in the\n&gt; Predacon language. He was so hungry. He watched after a few moments as the\n&gt; fish returned. He leaned his body closer over the edge of the boulder,\n&gt; targeting percisely. He plunged his tail down into the water. He felt\n&gt; something in between the jaws of his tail. He pulled his tail up and found\n&gt; out that he had a catch.\n&gt;\n&gt; He laughed and snapped his claws in victory. &quot;Ah got one!&quot; he called out.\n&gt; &quot;Ah got one!&quot; He turned his body to the side and threw the fish from his\n&gt; tail, to the shore. It was already limp.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked back down into the waters. He targeted his tail, and tried\nagain.\n&gt; One wasn&#39;t going to enough for him.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Conference Calling with Firetalk!\n&gt; Click Here!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5480/13/_/_/_/962496375/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
