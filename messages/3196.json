He didn&#39;t like\n&gt; the sounds of it. He had nothing with him to tell him how the auto-guns\nhere\n&gt; fairing. He wasn&#39;t in the control room. He was blindly in the cooridor. He\n&gt; tensed with the explosions of the battle outside. He shoulders were\nbunched\n&gt; and his odd looking hands were crunched together when others bunched their\n&gt; fists togeher. Quickstrike had to improvise on that. He had his little\nways\n&gt; to get his messages out. His face was his best expression, and now they\nwere\n&gt; wild.\n&gt;\n&gt; He was confident, but he wasn&#39;t sure how the aut-guns would last. He\n&gt; remembered almost more than half of the aut-guns were destoryed in one\n&gt; battle with Hell Beast&#39;s troops when he turned them against the scums. But\n&gt; he was sure the shields would hold. Sure the Maximals could shoot the\n&gt; auto-guns to the high Pit, but they couldn&#39;t get past the shields.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Guard th&#39; ramp jus&#39; incase somethin&#39; happens,&quot; he said to Mantella, then\n&gt; bolted off.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; &gt;Date: Sun, 11 Jun 2000 20:31:25 -0400\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Populists were blasted by the shots and fired back, Suukie was out of\n&gt; &gt;sight now, and unbeknownst to the People&#39;s Group, he was right up to the\n&gt; &gt;Pred Base destroying Autoguns, and just looking for a Pred beeating!...\n&gt; &gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Sunday, June 11, 2000 8:01 PM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstrike jolted straight.
