The Humans wanted their kid back. He \nwould oblige them... to a point.\n\nAlready, the small girl was shaking back into conscience. Quite fast, \nit would seem, as she was now screaming for her parents to save her. \nHe and his companions smiled at the thought.\n\nThe large muscular man arrived with two smaller ones. The freed the \ngirl from the plants that tightly held her. None of them saw the... \nthing leap from the top of the tree. None of them survived to tell \nthe tale.\n\nHe had heard one of his friend say that he was a machine, but he did \nnot believe it one bit. He circled the place where the humans died, \nand swiftly decided that he would eat them. He savagely tore at three \nof them with three different heads at the same time. Blood covered \nhis mouth and that of his friends.\n\nAries: Enough now! Leo, you stop being such a loser and accept it! \nWe&#39;re not a stupid mindless beast!\n\nLeo: Aries, shut up! I&#39;m in charge now! You could never prove that \nbefore and you&#39;re not going to start now!\n\nAries: Oh yes I will!\n\nWith a cry of excruciating pain, Leo was relegated to a spectator \nposition. Aries was now in command and he transformed.\n\nHe was not tall, nor was he very impressive. He was just a simple \nrobot. It was more than enoughto prove a point, though.\n\nAries:Ha ha! See now? Okay, The food&#39;s not good anymore. Let&#39;s fly \naway.\n\nWith that, he stretched his leathery wings and started to cross the \nMediterranean sea, heading for Greece.\n\n\n"}}
