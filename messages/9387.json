Sometimes he just needed to get \nout and fly around. Natural flight was his uniqueness among the others. He \nwas only flier with flight in both modes.\n\nAs he entered, he saw Dark Mouse. He hovered then landed. &quot;Only me, huh?&quot; He \nshrugged his wings. &quot;Well of course. I thought Megatron was here. Where is \nhe?&quot;\n\n\n&gt;From: logomorph@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: NBW\n&gt;Date: Tue, 01 Aug 2000 15:35:58 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;::DarkMouse:;\n&gt;\n&gt;She kneeled down next to Quickstrike and injected the liquid into his\n&gt;shoulder. &quot;It will take it a minute or two to take effect.  But you\n&gt;should be feeling better shortly.&quot;\n&gt;She stayed next to him. She was getting worried.  Quickstrike was\n&gt;down and needed help and attention.  KitKat was off at the Vokcave\n&gt;looking for Rowdy.   Stringtra and Wildfire were off in the forest\n&gt;after Wildfire told her there was danger out there. Megatron was who\n&gt;knows where doing who knows what and the Matrix knew when he would\n&gt;return.\n&gt;That left her, Terrorsaur, Scorponok and Drillbit.  She felt scared\n&gt;and sick at the same time.  No one was there other than Scorponok,\n&gt;who could lead the group.  And she hadn&#39;t seen Scorponok for a while.\n&gt;She knew that if something happened, she couldn&#39;t defend the base and\n&gt;the others for very long.  She had the autoweapons and a few other\n&gt;little tricks, but nothing that would stay off an attacker for a\n&gt;really long time.  She was getting nervous.  She got up and walked\n&gt;over to Terrorsaur.  She looked up at him with worry in her eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;If anything happens, can I count on you to help me around here? I\n&gt;will be needing you eventually. There are only 5 of us here at the\n&gt;base. And you are the strongest out of all of us right now. Please\n&gt;tell me that when the time comes, I can count on you to help?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike looked up at Dark Mouse with his foot still propped up\n&gt;against\n&gt; &gt; the wall.
