Ever since Hell \nBeast had occupied the cave, a cave in had trapped him in ice. Unable \nto fight out, Autofire had been forced to go into stasis lock to save \nhis life. Many months, perhaps even years, have passed from that \ntime, with Autofire remaining under the ice in stasis lock.\n\nThe rumble that passed through the cave as Megatron began to force \nhis way through the ice wall was the first wake up call to Autofire&#39;s \nsystems. They had been completely immobile for a long time, and now \nthe shaking was booting some of them up. The second call came with a \nhuge tremmor, shaking the ice off of Autofire as a child would shake \ndried earth from a long lost toy. Autofire&#39;s systems began to fully \nreactivate, some of them damaged, but most were in good shape. In a \nfew seconds his optics light up.\n\nWith the groan of gears that had not been moved in a long time, \nAutofire stood up from what had been his icy tomb. He stood tall, \neasilly topping 16 feet. His body was almost totaly black, with some \nred coloring in some places as well. With night falling outside, it \nwas nearly impossible to see any of Autofire&#39;s features except for \nhis bulk and his many weapons sticking out of his shoulders and \ntorso. A light flickered on, the source of the light attached to the \ntop-left part of Autofire&#39;s head. He looked around, everything now \nvisible. Autofire looked like a seasoned warrior, with the gashes and \nscrapes of combat, though they had been mostly brought on by the \ncavein that had trapped in. He was large but well-porportioned, and \nwould be agile as well as strong in combat. Two guns were attached to \neach side of his torso, as well as a gun each on his forearms, and a \nmissile launcher on his shoulder. His optics had the ability to fire \nlaser bolts. For hand-held weapons he used a pair of chainguns, \nstored in his wrists. Taking out one of these chainguns, Autofire \nlooks around, spotting Megatron.\n\n&quot;Identify yourself,&quot; the bot growls, approaching Megatron with the \nchaingun leveled at the Decepticon&#39;s head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megatron gasped for air, he had been digging a long while, and \nhadnt found\n&gt; anything, he was almost out of energon, and if he didnt find \nanything, he\n&gt; might die out in the arctic. No, he cant, he took a step back, and \nwound up\n&gt; his fist, and shot it forward with all his might into the icy wall, \na huge\n&gt; rumble coming from his immences strength, as the ice cracked, and \nthe wall\n&gt; gave way, as the hundreds of tons of ice above came crashing down, \nand in\n&gt; all the chaos, of the huge tremors, and the large amout of ice \nfalling,\n&gt; Megatron had to aim his cannon upwards, and with what remained of \nhis\n&gt; energy, fire a huge blast, to keep himself from getting buried. The \nstream\n&gt; of raw power cut through the ice falling towards him, melting it as \nsoon as\n&gt; his power hit it. Then there was silence.\n&gt; \n&gt; He fell to the ground, panting, his energy reserves where almost \nused up in\n&gt; that blast, and a huge hole where all the ice fell remained, &quot;I \nmust get\n&gt; the .... energy&quot; he whispered, as he crawled forward.\n\n\n"}}
