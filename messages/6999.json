She really wanted to stay out in the wilderness for a \nwhile longer, but she had to return.  She opened her commlink to \nQuickstrikes specific frequency. &quot;We found Rowdy and all three of us \nare headed back to the base Commander Quickstike. Sir we shall return \nshortly. KitKat out.&quot; Normally she would go through the formalities \nlike that.  But she felt it would be good to make Quickstrike look \ngood in front of an old friend.  She looked at Terrorsaur, and then \nto Rowdy.  She liked another wolf being around.  She hoped he would \nbe around for a while.  She still missed having a pack.  And being \nint he company of another wolf again felt good.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Rowdy Wolf:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No, this is it.&quot; he said to KitKat. He turned his head, to where \nZyber was. \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to help my friend. You are welcomed to follow. But your \ndecision \n&gt; is your own destiny.&quot; He turned his head back to KitKat and \nTerrorsaur. He \n&gt; put his rifle behind his armor and fur, then transformed to his \nbeast mode. \n&gt; &quot;Then we shall go?&quot; he said to them. &quot;Lead the way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Terrorsaur lifted himself into the air and transformed to beast \nmode. He \n&gt; lowered down and grabbed the bundle of furs in his claws. He even \nmanaged to \n&gt; put a fur blanket over his back and wings.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
