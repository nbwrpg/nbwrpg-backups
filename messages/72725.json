It was clear as the snarl on his\n&gt; face and the narrow of his brow that he was not going to let anyone step all\n&gt; over him.   He folds in his wings to protect them from harm and on all\n&gt; fours, manages to lunge forward toward the guards, with open jaws, hoping to\n&gt; catch and toss one of them into the other, creating a domino effect.\n&gt; His strong tail acts like a rudder as it slaps hard against the wall.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON lunged out, BIG CONVOY, MACH KICK and BREAK stepped out as\nwell, firing lasers up and around TUSCON targeting the SHARKTICON\nguards.\n\nQuickly the guards are dispatched!\n\nThe lead one is caught by TUSCON and sent flying back into two others\nwhile the rest are caught by the laser fire from MACH KICK and BREAK.\n\nBIG CONVOY backs up TUSCON as well, his own firepower, while tightly\ncontrolled in this tight quarter, is powerful and forceful as he\nopened up with his laser cannons.\n\nSoon enough the SHARKTICONS are lying in heaps strewn about the floor\nand the walls are scortched from the exchange of energy that came\nthrough. There are also various dents and abrasions are on the wall\nfrom where SHARKTICONS were caught and thrown into it.\n\nThe door they came through still stands open.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
