But at least there had been \nno contact; also, he had gotten the point across rather well. Or so he \nhoped.  Through proximity or word, he could not tell.\nBut he had seen no concern on Tavatron�s part, making him question whether \nor not she had realized just what he had said�and how much will power alone \nit took him to say it. Which made him feel foolish and wonder just why he \nhad bothered to say anything. But it did not matter to him, what was done \nwas done, said was said. All he need do now was wait and see what the \nresults would fathom out to be.\n\nDinobot shifted his weight on his aching legs, but a complaint he muttered \nnot. It was all part of the effect that long run her on his body after \nrepairing so soon, knowing that a few other faults might show up once or \ntwice before his body began to settle down.\nBut it didn�t matter, he could stand it.\nSuddenly Dinobot�s stomach growled loudly.\nExcept hunger.\nSlightly discomforted by his digestive system voicing its need for \nsustenance, he shifted his weight, looking towards Tavatron as she looked \naway from him. His mind shifting from his hunger to the problem at hand, his \nmind almost seeming to be wheeling once again.\nShe looked away�what did he do wrong now?\nGrowling, Dinobot looked at Tavatron for a few more moments before he turned \nhis transmetal reptilian head away and towards the edge of the cliff.\nThe wind stirring up small wisps of sand disturbed from his clawed hind \nlimbs as he walked to the edge of the chert and looking down. The rock \ndisappeared into the thick forest below, his entire torso over the edge so \nthat his clawed hands moved over thin air.\nDinobot looked straight down, squinting and scanning the dike, which seemed \nto run up from the base of the cliff and along the small mountain stream \nleading away from the mass of rock.\nThis place must have been volcanic once upon a decade. His eyes glancing \ntowards Tavatron as she caught but then turned as she stood and brushed \nherself off, seeing that she was finally ready to obey commands and return \nto base.\nStepping away from the edge of the cliff, and towards the direction that the \nfembot was facing.\n\nDinobot was just about to follow after Tavatron�s steps when he suddenly \nheard a very soft flapping coming from just below the cliff edge, looking \nover his shoulder to see a pair of butterflies� flutter and dance into the \nair. Their wings being that he heard.\nThey twisted and twined around each other, delicate little patterns in the \nair, both seeming as if one.\nDinobot looked at them for a continued moment, watching their dance and \nalmost seeming to see something more then insects.\nSuddenly his eyes seemed to be clouded as he recalled a dream, only flames \nwere behind the crucified figure of Tavatron.\nHearing his own voice.\n� Who did this to you.� It echoed through his mind, then Tavatrons answer, � \nYou did.�\nIt was strange, but made sense�as well as confusing him. There were so many \nthings that could be told out of just that one though, but with an easy \nshake of his head his eyes refocused on the blue sky and the flittering \ninsects.\n\nDinobot glared at the dancing bugs in his vision, turning around and away \nfrom them as well as the message of his dream, moving away to follow \nTavatron. His tail swinging up behind him and eliminating the peaceful and \nmeaningful dance of the bugs, leaving their fairy dusted wings to drift upon \nthe wind. Now empty and as soulless as he.\n\nIt wasn�t long until Dinobot caught up to Tavatron, striding in pace beside \nher, his face forward and expressionless�besides his usual aggressive \nvision.\nHe glanced at her once as they walked in silence, not even looking towards \nher as she spoke but listened intently.\nHalf of the reason he was out here was to hear her explanation of \nabandonment, after all.\nBut what Tavatron had said was wrong.\nWithout looking at her he replied with a flat voice.** � There is an excuse, \nperhaps not acceptable, but one none the less.�\n** Whether she knew it or not, an excuse is a reason, perhaps true or not a \nreason none the less.\nTavatron�s excuse was the reason she had run away when he needed her, \nwhatever that reason might be. One, however, he was eager to hear.\nBut enough of him speaking, it was her turn.\nThough, what was that he heard from Tavatron�s mouth? Not running from her \npast any longer?\nDinobot snarled as he thought.\nSo, this femms excuse for escaping, her reason for running from the \ndifficult situation was by cause of some sort of event or phrase from her \npast?\nHe growled. Oh yes, he knew the past well. Something, which did never, \nseemed to be kind to anyone in this cursed war, and also something you could \nnever hide from.\nOne could never run from the past because it was always with you, made and \nstill making you who you are. But Dinobot only growled again, watching a \ndisturbed wood creature scamper through the grasses. Refusing an unholy \nstrong urge to go after it.\nBut that was just the unstably  and ferociousness of the transmetal 2 side \nof him speaking. Simply putting that urge on hold either until this \nsituation was over or another time arose.\n\nDinobot looked towards Tavatron a moment as she spoke again, his mind \nreturning to more important matters.\nLooking ahead again as the last sound drained from the femms throat.\nHis own voice colder then before.**\n\n� That is, somewhat, of the reason I am here.�\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
