His arms and hands\n&gt; follow the flow of water that jets out of the fissures.  Yet the water\n&gt; simply follows the flow of his arms rather than splashing on them.  And with\n&gt; the water came the compulsion to transform into his beast form.   And then\n&gt; as warrior once again became the dragon, he embraces the element of water\n&gt; and melds with its own natural forces and then, with his powerful tail, he\n&gt; strikes the wall, attempting to finally break it to further weaken it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Fire may not have been his theme but he embraces something far more\n&gt; significant than simple flames.  The element of Thunder, and lightning and\n&gt; the raging torrent of rain water that follows the first clap of thunder.  He\n&gt; gives a draconic roar that sends a thunderous boom toward the Sharkticon\n&gt; guards, and throughout the cavern.\n&gt;\n&gt; He can hear Yoketron&#39;s phrases as he carries forth and recites them to his\n&gt; enemies.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Fire may be powerful and capable of massive damage, yet fire is not the\n&gt; most formidable element of nature.  For it has a weakness, water.  And even\n&gt; more powerful than water, is the storm that spawns it.  Embrace the power of\n&gt; the storm, be at one with the tempest, and bring forth the light that\n&gt; follows darkness. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson&#39;s armor shimmers as the glint on each metallic scale flashes like\n&gt; lightning. He stands his ground and begins moving his wings, kicking up a\n&gt; slight breeze in the cave.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I am the storm, and I will not be easily stopped.  Your darkness will see\n&gt; light, like it or not.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWith that final tail slap the wall of rock and debris shattered,\nsending stones flying in many directions.\n\nBehind that though was a massive wall of water that burst out like it\nwas comming through some sort of massive hose and quickly fired out of\nthe shaft it had been trapped in and it began flowing in the direction\nof the flaming pillar, which was on the direct other side of the large\ncavern!\n\nAt nearly one mile away it would take the water approximately a minute\nor so to reach the other side where the column of fire like energy was\nflowing over OPTIMUS PRIME and streaming from the pit that was beneath\nhim into a hole in the top of the cave.\n\nDARK RODIMUS looked down at NIGHTLIGHT and carefully set her down and\nlooked up at SABERBACK and then pointed at the water that was coming\ndown on them.\n\nIn the distance the SHARKTICONS who were indeed much closer were\nalready forced to veer out of the way and circle around.\n\n&quot;Fuzors, attack!&quot; TORCA said as AIR HAMMER and NOCTORRO rose into the\nair and began firing on the now disoriented SHARKTICONS, sending them\nfleeing to the side.\n\nTORCA and BANTOR fired as well and it took ony a few moments to send\nthe SHARKTICONS crashing to the ground to be overwhelmed by the\ntorrent of water that was rushing at them.\n\nMeanwhile SABERBACK, who had been already watching merely frowned as\nhe pulled out a device and began to manipulate it. The air near\nhimself, DARK RODIMUS, MAGMATRON and OPTIMUS PRIME suddenly distorted\nslight as a force field snapped into place.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight did a small groam, almost an unoticeable one, But she continued\n&gt; unconseus and her wound still was bleeding\n\nNodding DARK RODIMUS looked back down at NIGHTLIGHT wondering and\nhoping that her self repair circuits would kick in.\n\nAt the same time MAGMATRON continued to smile as power flowed along\nthe cables that had been set up between himself and OPTIMUS PRIME.\nMeanwhile OPTIMUS&#39;s whole body began to sag, as if his own power\nreserves were being depleted.\n\nEven his screams had become just grunts of pain.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
