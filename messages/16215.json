On my back.�\n\n* She blew on it to cool it a bit before turning towards the bed and walking \nover to it again, sitting at it�s edge and holding cups rip up to the \ncreatures lips.\nZyber tilted her head as she studied the animals features, wondering just \nwhat it could be�but she could never guess. It was everything. *\n\n� Here you go. Drink it lightly and slowly, it is fairly potent. It will \nwarm you up�and begin small repairs of your internals.�\n\n* She waited patiently for him to drink, just hoping that he wouldn�t try \nand lunge out of bed again. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
