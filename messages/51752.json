He wasn&#39;t even wasn&#39;t even taking a shot at Airly. \nCorrecting someone&#39;s english spelling/grammar is hardly an insult, \nand I have no clue how one could be considered an idiot for that. I \nhelp Airly with her grammar sometimes too, and that doesn&#39;t make me \nan idiot, so it obviously doesn&#39;t make Kyle one either.\n\nThough &quot;Long live the NBWRPG&quot; is more correct than &quot;Long life to \nNBWRPG&quot;, but both are acceptable in that we understand the ultimate \nidea being presented. Essentially, there&#39;s no point in arguing or \npetty name calling, so cut it out, and please don&#39;t do it again.\n\n\n"}}
