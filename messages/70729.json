We&#39;ve yet to find out what that is don&#39;t we?

Could we actually reverse the effects of that simply by reading the dat=\r\na on that file?&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks to him curiously.\n\n&quot;Heeeey, that could wor=\r\nk.  But that&#39;s up ta Wheels if he wants you ta try that.&quot;\n\nTucson turns his=\r\n head in Night Shift&#39;s direction.\n\n&quot;As interesting as that sounds, I don&#39;t =\r\nthink it would be wise for you to do something this complicated by yourself=\r\n. Too many Autobots fell to the wrath of the Decepticons and I&#39;d hate to lo=\r\nse another to Hydras.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;Yes sir, Tucson Prime.  I won&#39;=\r\nt try it alone, I promise.&quot;\n\nTucson turns his head to everyone.\n\n&quot; Night Sh=\r\nift, your course of action is well coordinated and I believe that route sho=\r\nuld be tried.

He \n&gt; &gt; smiles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I can see how you g=\r\not your name.  Highly perceptive of you.  Thank you \n&gt; &gt; Legacy, you&#39;ve she=\r\nd a lot of light on many of my questions.  Now that I \n&gt; &gt; know my lineage,=\r\n it&#39;s time I lived up to it.  First things first, \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor and I coul=\r\nd do with getting our sight back, and if you could do \n&gt; &gt; that I&#39;d greatly=\r\n appreciate it, Stanton.  Next, we have insectoids hiding \n&gt; &gt; beneath the =\r\nBlack Fortress tunnels, which have to be shown a lesson about \n&gt; &gt; tamperin=\r\ng with what is not theirs.  And Hydras last of all, could use a \n&gt; &gt; lesson=\r\n in that as well.  Nobody tampers with any Autobot and gets away \n&gt; &gt; with =\r\nit.  Especially when they tamper with a Prime.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turns his head t=\r\noward Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; They caused great harm to you Rodimus, and I&#39;ll se=\r\ne to it, with your \n&gt; &gt; help, that they get it back in return.  If Optimus =\r\nPrime could fend off \n&gt; &gt; Megatron, I&#39;m sure I can follow in his footsteps,=\r\n and fend off the enemy \n&gt; &gt; at hand.  Both Hydras and Cylconus need to be =\r\ndealt with accordingly. \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus voiced an interest in dealing with Hyd=\r\nras and so do I.  Two Primes \n&gt; &gt; against an evil leader is sure to topple =\r\neven the most evil of warlords. \n&gt; &gt; But our war does not end with just us.=\r\n  If we&#39;re going to send those \n&gt; &gt; Decepticons and Predicons packing, we&#39;l=\r\nl need every Autobot and Maximal we \n&gt; &gt; have in our ranks to pull this off=\r\n.  Lord Elder, I&#39;d like you to contact \n&gt; &gt; Lord Perseus, and assemble a Ma=\r\nximal/ Autobot assembly.  The more we get \n&gt; &gt; together, the stronger we&#39;ll=\r\n be.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus=\r\n@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I know who it sounds like.
