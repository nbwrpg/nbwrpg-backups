Powered by abundant\ngeothermal energy and hidden just the same, Megatron\nhad moved Hellplague, Malice and wolfblade there for\nsafety.\n\nhe figured soon the factions would seek to elminate\npeople none of them could control, so for their\npreservation they moved to the dark island of\nHokkaido.\n\nAs he was running routine security checks of the\nisland and the surrounding waters, he picked up a\nminion signal.  if it was unfriendly he would have to\nquickly eliminate it, lest it lead to trouble. \nLeaving Hellplague in the base, megatron transformed\ninto vehicle mode on a catapult pad and was launched\nout of a sea side hanger, which was well hidden when\nthe tunnel was shut.  he flew only a few feet over the\nraging waters of the northern seas, making his way to\nhonshu, where the minion signal was coming from.\n\n&#39;I just hope its Blacknightmare.  If I can get her\nback to the base, she&#39;ll finally be safe.&#39;\n\n--- airly2000 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Blacknightmare:\n&gt; \n&gt; Blacknightmare landed in that volcanic area, she\n&gt; knew that her former \n&gt; pals and all factions there would hunted her down\n&gt; for their own \n&gt; reasons.
