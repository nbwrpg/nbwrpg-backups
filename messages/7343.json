A missile launcher takes aim at Ares, firing two signature-seeking \nmissiles.\n\nThe laser batteries swirl around to fire at Hades and Ares, the EMP cannons, \nonce again recharged, firing at Anubis.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRex laughs as he sees Hell Beast retreat. He runs after the Predacon \ncommander for a while.\n\n&quot;And don&#39;t come back, coward!&quot; Rex yells loudly enough for Hell Beast to \nhear, then turns around to return to the ship.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster looks from the running Predacons to his ship, leaughing \ngood-heartedly as he fires at Koga.\n\n&quot;Ha!&quot; he says into his comm-link, sending the message to all Maximals and \nPredacons, &quot;Three attacks and they couldn&#39;t even scratch the ship!&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker smiles as he sees the Predacons run.\n\n&quot;Good battle, eh, Hell Beast?&quot; he says into his comm, sending the \ntransmission to the Predacon commander, &quot;Too bad you couldn&#39;t stay longer.&quot;\n\nWith that, he turns to fire at Ares.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Maximal victory!&quot; Ramulus yells as he sees Hell Beast retreat. He smiles, \nturning to fire at Anubis.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen&#39;s eyes widen as he sees Hell Beast and the Preds run. Another \nMaximal victory! He turns around to walk toward the ship. He was pretty \ndamaged, so he headed toward the CR chambers.\n\n"}}
