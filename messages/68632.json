If you could, please define what\nordinance you are using so I know how to have Legacy respond. Thanks))\n \nAs the last two minions make thier way onto the battle field they are\nscanned and targetted, even as they launch thier own attacks. \n\nNightstrike and Darkfate&#39;s lasers reach through the air towards the\ncrimson and black hover tank. They strike! Thier twin attacks searing\nalong the dense armor of the craft, creating small scorched lines along\nthe exterior, but other wise leaving it remarkably unharmed. \n\nThe tank on the other hand brought its twin mounted rear cannon to bear\non the duo and began a firing rapid plasma beam attacks into the air,\ntargetting thier wings and engiens!\n\nEven as this happened, Decibel and Tummult both swung through the air\nin wide arks, swiftly comming back around, thier engienes screaming as\nthey brought to bear thier firepower! Twin missiles, a full spread\nlaunch from each of them and moved in the direction of Legacy!\n\nThe strike was tremendous, Tummult&#39;s ballistic missiles and Decibel&#39;s\nsonic ones created a true cecophany of sound light and power. However\nas the tank moved smoothly out from beneath the blast, the energy of\nthe attack sloughing off newly errected shields, it was obvious they\nhad underestimated this foe.\n\n&gt; ::Lord Elder::\n&gt;\n&gt; As the Maximal&#39;s Matrix Quest shuttle nears the Ark, Elder looks out \n&gt; the view ports down at Mt. St. Hillary.\n&gt; Elder: We&#39;re late! There is a battle down there. Minions... I&#39;m sure \n&gt; of it.\n\nAs the Maximal craft came into range, the ship was scanned as the tank\nbelow targetted it. After a short moment the targeting beams from the\ntank switched focus, the shuttle is apparently being ignored. \n\nThe Hover tank turned its attention to the minions in the air, firing\nblasts at the dodging aircraft. \n\nTummult continued his upward climb until he also saw the approaching\nMaximals. A grunt and a sight escaped him as he saw thier chance for\nsuccess retreating from thier grasp. \n\n&quot;Minions, RETREAT!&quot; Tummult&#39;s deep voice transmitted over thier radios\non encrypted channels. &quot;Thier are too many for us to take. Phobia, get\nDeepstryke and get out of there!&quot;\n\nTummult continued to climb as Phobia transformed and latched on to\nDeepstryke with some sort of cable. Decibel grumbled and circled, but\nonly fired covering shots to aid thier escape from the tank below. \n\n(Tag Nightstrike, Darkfate and Maximals)\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minions & Legacy)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
