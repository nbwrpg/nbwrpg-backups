Time Bomb was worried since everyone was shooting at Land Mine, he ran\nto her and found she was wounded pretty bad. The bad part was that she was\nquickly losing blood, and needed to have the blood flow stopped. He could\nburn her. No, that wouldn&#39;t work, the wound was too big and it would hurt\nher too much if he covered the whole thing. He decided he had to do a decent\njob, then. He powered his laser to flame mode and sent a small firey beam\ninto her side. She was still bleeding, she wasn&#39;t even looking at him, just\nlifelessly looking at Megatron. Time Bomb knew why Land Mine always came\nprepared for this now. He took out her survival kit and wrapped her up, that\nwould be okay for until they got back to base. Time Bomb picked up Land\nMine, nodded to Megatron and sat down behind the rock next to Megatron...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 02, 2000 7:33 PM\nSubject: Kick &#39;Em While They&#39;re Down\n\n\n&gt; Injector/Manterror:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Injector landed, a few feet from KitKat.  &quot;Hello, traitors!&quot; he said with\na\n&gt; smile, kicking at the side of KitKat&#39;s head, firing off a stinger missile\nat\n&gt; Terrorsaur.\n&gt;\n&gt; Manterror fired off a single ion disk at the rock Megatron was hiding\nbehind.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
