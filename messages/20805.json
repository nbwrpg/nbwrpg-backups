But something struck me, I don&#39;t know if you thought of it: \nWar by Attrition. I don&#39;t know our numbers, or thiers, but it seems \nthat if we send one massive attack we might suffer more casualities \nthen if we sent a group of let&#39;s say ten. Then when they get the word \nthe retreat and another group of ten starts to attack.\n&gt;     &quot;This proboly only work if we could repair the troops. Meaning \na CR Chamber area. I have CR Chambers and portable generators that \ncan be in a good position within the hour. But we would also need \nAutoguns, and my base doesn&#39;t have extra.\n&gt;     &quot;That is why I am coming to you, I would like to help you, in \nreturn for your help in the future.&quot;\n&gt;     He finished looking her in the eye.
