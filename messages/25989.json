A cavern \nsomewhere in a volcano.  The golden pyramid is about a little over a dozen \nfeet in height and twenty feet in diameter.  The ancient device began racing \nas it starting coming online.\n\nHow long had it been out?  It had been damaged somehow, possibly an \nearthquake.  An estimated five thousand years perhaps.  It couldn&#39;t do \nanything as its advanced sensors told it.  Its power was only at fifteen \npercent.  For now it would just have to dip into its cold fusion reactor \nwhich had been damaged.   Procedure Soe Level One would have to be initiated \nwhen energy was restored.  Then procedure Chasm Level One would have to take \neffect after that.  Then it would be strong enough to initiate its main \nobjectives.  For now it could only scan, and that&#39;s what it did.  Very \nintense and thorough scans on what it could.  Some things the golden pyramid \ndidn&#39;t have the energy to scan because of shields.  Others had their shields \ndown and weapons fire was going off.  No unity, no togetherness.  Just how \neverything was supposed to go.\n\n"}}
