He would have be=\r\nen glad to be rid of this annoyance, yes, but it would have been somewhat d=\r\nisappointing as well. \n \nSo when Rodimus was spun around by Tuscon, the Aut=\r\nobot may have missed the wicked smile on his face, When Tuscon tried to ram=\r\n Rodimus into a wall, he may not have noticed that the sound of crunching m=\r\netal was not Rodimus&#39; but the reinrorced wall shearing and tearing under th=\r\ne force of the assault. It was not the sound of Rodimkus&#39; defeat that reson=\r\nated through the room, but it was something else!\n \nMany of the same teache=\r\nrs that had instructed Tuscon had trained a young Hot Rod as well -  Jazz, =\r\nProwl, Brawn, Kup, even Optimus himself! And while Rodimus no longer clearl=\r\ny remembered all these ones and what they had meant to him, thier lessons w=\r\nere still ground into him, and his reflexes that had been honed over the ye=\r\nars of battle! \n \nAlso, this was no young Hot Rod that stood there before t=\r\nhem, but a figure shapped by the energy of the matrix into a character of l=\r\neadership, power and ability. He no longer had access to the knowledge and =\r\nwisdom of the matrix, the energy having been stripped from him. But that po=\r\nwer that had been imparted was still there, reconfigured by the power of th=\r\ne predacon shell program! He was faster, stronger and far more durable then=\r\n Hot Rod ever was, he was DARK RODIMUS!\n \nSo when Rodimus hit the wall it w=\r\nas not truely pain that he felt, but the elation that a true battle was in =\r\nthe making. He felt that charge that all warriors felt when they faced a fo=\r\ne that had some metal! It was an eagerness twisted by Predacon programming =\r\ninto something dark and loathsome. \n \nSo when he stood and turned around it=\r\n was not defeat in his stance but derision, &quot;So you fancy yourself to be a =\r\nPrime do you, scrappling?&quot; Rodimus said his tone still mocking as he raised=\r\n his arm, smiling as his optics glowing with energy, &quot;Well let&#39;s see what y=\r\nou got!&quot; With a thought he fired a blast of plasma energy from his arm moun=\r\nted cannon at this new incarnation of Tuscon, who for the moment appeared t=\r\no be posturing for Hydras!\n \nOOC: Remember, the matrix that is housed withi=\r\nn Rodimus has no energy of its own, only the housing. It does not have the =\r\npower to reach out and transform anyone, although I do have some ideas.
