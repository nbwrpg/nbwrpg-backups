He sees her in the water but \nfeels \n&gt; helpless as centaurs can&#39;t swim due to their shape.  In a fit of \ndesperation \n&gt; he tries to transform again.  With the need to save her he returned \nto his \n&gt; semi-robot mode still retaining his wings.  He dove into the water \nand came \n&gt; up under her lifting her out of the waterand flying out into the \nsunlight.  \n&gt; He bends over her and says &quot;Trinity?  Can you hear me?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
