I heard there was an attack on the \nmaximal base going on, and the city&#39;s my character, along with a big bunch \nof maximals so i need to be filled in :)\n\n(i&#39;m playing it by ear for now) :):)\n\n++Cyndro Mantle Mist Aqua Cinder Rubble Truttle+++\n\nChecking his scanners, Cyndro detected some Decepticons heading for Maximal \nCity. He smiled internally to himself, cause he can&#39;t smile externaly due to \nlack of a mouth. These guys were in for a big surprise!\n\nCyndro sent a few commands through his systems which caused the shields to \nflash up, reflecting the sun and acting as the barrier between harm and \nMaximal City. His various autoguns, missile launchers, and heavy turrets all \nactivated and swirled in the direction of the attackers. With a brief beep \nfrom the top of the Maximal City, the transmission jammer activated and \nbegan blocking all transmission but Maximal ones for miles around. The \nDecepticons&#39; communications were now cut off, including the one Triggerhappy \nsent to the other Decepticons; the jammer scrambled it before it got out far \nat all, although that would probably be unknown to the sender. They would \nnever know how bad they would lose...\n\nSeveral shots hit Cyndro&#39;s shields, but he merely laughed them off silently \nand fired back with missiles and lasers at the attackers. &quot;Attention all \nMaximals,&quot; he said through the intercom inside Maximal City, &quot;We are under \nattack! Lets kick some butt!&quot;\n\n----\n\nMantle and his team were in the mess hall when Cyndro&#39;s announcement came \nthrough. Mantle jumped up with his weapon already in his hand.\n\n&quot;You heard that! Let&#39;s go!&quot; he said to his group. Cinder, Mist, Rubble, \nAqua, and himself all ran down the hallway toward the exit and armed their \nweapons while running.\n\n----\n\nTruttle had been training in the holo rooms, but the announcement got his \nattention. He took out a few guns, ran off at full speed toward the exit, \nand left the holographic opponents to fight by themselves.\n\n:):):)\n\nooc: i hope that wasn&#39;t too bad :)\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
