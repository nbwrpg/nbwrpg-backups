The thoughts and emotions all \nswirled to life, mixed with a kind of rageful confusion only death could \nbring. Every other moment, the searing truth of possibly being shut-down \npermanently urged him to move on...to keep trying. &quot;I...must...fight...&quot; He \nuttered those words to aid his struggle to live, to surface from his grave. \n&quot;...the Vok...the TransMystiks...&quot; He continued with all his power, moving \nupwards, striving to stay online. &quot;FireStorm...Aquaries...&quot; He felt the \nopening growing wider, pain slashing through his dull optics. Yes...the \nsurface...he reached it. With a tired, clenched fist, his shimmering metallic \nfingers bursted through the ground, reaching for the air above his grave. \n&quot;BioStinger...you have proven yourself worthy again. For this, we grant you \nlife. Now continue your fight...&quot;. That voice, the voice of the Voks mixed \nwith his own, flared himself to sheer life, just as night began to fall over \nthat lonesome mountain.\n\n"}}
