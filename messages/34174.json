His rear rockets\n&gt; &gt; fire, incinerating several shrubs and charring a tree behind him, as\n&gt; &gt; he moves forward. Slowly at first, Astroblast gains speed and\n&gt; &gt; momentum quickly, putting distance between himself and the trees\n&gt; &gt; below. He head towards the CF, and Megatron&#39;s location, reveling at\n&gt; &gt; the chance to help Maximals and their allies to their matrix.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dead-End fly&#39;s past Skyscream, and lands on the ground, he \n&gt; &gt; groans. His eyes widden as he spots the impending doom. He \n&gt; &gt; quickly rolls to the side as two shells crash beside him. He rolls\n&gt; &gt; into a rock. Not a big rock, but a rock large enough to stop him\n&gt; &gt; from rolling. The third shell replaces Dead-End&#39;s arm, and some of\n&gt; &gt; his side armour, with a tangled mesh of mechafluid and wires.

He smiles at his \n&gt; &gt; clever disguise; the sparks coming from the laser look like the\n&gt; &gt; sparks that would come from a damaged robot, and him being cloaked\n&gt; &gt; leaves it looking like a wreck on the ground. &quot;Just wait\n&gt; &gt; Speedbreaker, you&#39;ll be up soon,&quot; he says quietly, mostly to\n&gt; &gt; himself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On 8 May 2001, at 18:32, robertdahl wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Okay, every post sent by Scorpius, has a date on it before he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quit.

Megatron then looks at Triggerhappy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Scourge, and Cyclonus. &quot;Transform my Decepticons, and ATTACK&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yells, poiting at the Element. &quot;Nightstrike, follow their flank,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; listen to Cyclonus.

Skullgrin&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yells reffering to the Pretender. &quot;Receive&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megatron then jumps straight up into the air, and starts a back\n&gt; flip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As he does, he starts to fold in on himself, and shrink,\n&gt; transforming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into his gun mode. He then falls towards Skullgrin, waiting for\n&gt; him to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; catch him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Motormaster walks up towards Speedbreaker, to inspect the damage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wildrider continues to fall, and gracefully just misses the\n&gt; shells, as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he was keeping his eyes on Incarcinerator. He looks towards\n&gt; Shockwave,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and starts to laugh. &quot;Commander Shockwave.
