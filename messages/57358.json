Before I can go though, I owe\n&gt; something to Rodimus. I also want to learn more about the Tripreds\n&gt; here, and possibly stage a raid against them.

We fight these Beast Wars here on Earth,\n&gt; while our governments are destroyed and our leaders dead.

I was ordered to\n&gt; &gt; bring Talos back with me, but he has been dead for a long time now.\n&gt; &gt; Seeing Optimus here made me think... I must do what I can to dig those\n&gt; &gt; damned Tripredacus out of our world! If someone has to rise up against\n&gt; &gt; them, then I am ready to follow, and if no one else is up for the\n&gt; &gt; task, then I will go alone. Maybe I will die there, but at least, I&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; do this in his memory!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He pointed at Prime, knowing that he might not be as good a leader as\n&gt; &gt; he had been, but at least, he would try.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: Don&#39;t be mad at me, Kup.

He just stood there in utter amazament. In\n&gt; &gt; &gt; front of him was Optimus Prime, the venerable Autobot, the ideal to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attain, the fabled leader, but most of all, the grandfather he never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had the chance to meet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He raised a hand and passed it on the huge head of his ancestor. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; felt nostalgic, thinking of Pumpskin, who had fallen in the hands of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Preds, the Tripredacus, who had conquered his homeland, and\nof the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Survivors, trying to build a semblant of resistance on Earth. His\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fists clenched and emotion swirled in his mind. He hated the\nPredacons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for their constant tugs on the Pax Cybertronia, but he was now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; loathing against the Tripredacus. Something had to be done...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: I will have to go, Kup.
