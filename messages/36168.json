He sensed a\nshadow hovering over him. &quot;Oh SH...&quot; his thoughts were cut off by a fist\nslamming down on his head forcing him to the ground. (This might be moding\nbut I think you&#39;ll like it.) The bums fist continued downward striking the\nground, Dogged still between the fist and the pavement. When the fist raised\nDoggeds crushed body lay with only it&#39;s feet fully intact and hanging out of\nthe hole. Sparks flashed from the rest of it as all motor functions ceased.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, June 01, 2001 9:16 PM\nSubject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n\n\n&gt; They&#39;re BW size.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::::\n&gt;\n&gt; Dogged&#39;s punch hits the bot&#39;s chest with a clang of silver against heavy\narmor, the bot not flinching.
