I&#39;ve been Christmas shopping for about 20 people, \nthank the matrix for dollar stores... Anywho, I should be able to post more \noften now. With the break coming up, my teacher&#39;s have decided to let up on \nthe work. I sense an ulterior, motive, but hey, as long as I don&#39;t haveta \nwrite another essay! Oh, I&#39;m going to reactivate my other char, Hysteria. \nI&#39;ll probably post with her tomorrow. I&#39;ll post now^_^)\n\nRion bounded over the sand dune, and slide, head first, down the other side. \nAfter a few moments of coughing and rubbing his eyes he stood, and gasped. \nThere, laying right infront of him, was a small leopard with little wings. \nShe was surrounded by large birds. They had wings like his, that would \nexplain his abnormal beast mode. He was a fuzor, it just wasn&#39;t very \nnoticible!\n\nRion raised his wrist cannon and fired at the large circle of birds:\n\n&quot;Get away from he- Aaahhhhh!&quot; The recoil sent Rion flying back against the \nsand dune. He landed with a thud. He sat up and looked behind him at the \nmess of feathers that lay around him. He quickly righted himself, drew his \nsword, and chraged the few remaining birds:\n\n&quot;Leave her alone!&quot;\n\nHe swung wildly at them. He wouldn&#39;t have hit the broad side of the CF, but \nat least he was trying.\n\n&gt;* The birds kept coming in, investigating her until a swipe from her paw\n&gt;sent them back a few feet, but moments later were back again.\n&gt;&lt; Stupid birds!&gt; Diana thought as she swatted at another one, which came \n&gt;too\n&gt;close.\n&gt;Too tired and hot to run, she sat there and batted at the buzzards, getting\n&gt;the occasional peck on the leg.\n&gt;Too young to know how to use her scanners, she didn�t know that help was\n&gt;just around the corner,\n&gt;But now the vultures were beginning to go behind her where she couldn�t \n&gt;swat\n&gt;at them enough, striking out hard and fast. Pecking her back and hind legs.\n&gt;Diana tried to get at them, but every time she tried to turn around to get\n&gt;them they stepped back and squawked at her.\n&gt;But finally, nearly 20 min of fighting off the huge birds, Diana collapsed\n&gt;with a plaintive mew, unable to get her legs to keep her up anymore.\n&gt;\n&gt;The huge vultures finally moved in now, causally and slowly. Circling the\n&gt;lump of wheezing fur and occasionally pecking at it with their sharp beaks,\n&gt;a mew replying every strike.*\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
