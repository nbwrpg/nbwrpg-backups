Megatron in charge? She had thought that it was Hell Beast \nwho had the Predacons, her being his second-in-command.\nBut she simply shrugged and continued, finally ready for the download.\nShe opened her com-link to the Predacon base, again in the coded \ntransmission. *\n\n� BrightBlade to Predacon base, be ready for download�NOW.�\n\n* And with that she activated the download, schematics of the Cybertronien \nFire�s defensive systems transferring from the main comp into the Predacon \nmain hard-drive. However, there were quite a few systems in which she had \ncoded on purpose, far to important to just let anybot go through them. Such \nas shield codes and weaponry defenses, all coded in patterns that only she \ncould decode. No way for any other to break into them.\nIt was then that she suddenly heard the door seal shut, then realizing that \nshe had been found out. She cursed to herself and opened a COM to Perndabot. \n*\n\n� I�ve ran into a spot of trouble, It�ll be an emergency evac. You might get \nyour chance to kick a little Maximal butt after all.�\n\n* With that she deactivated her com-link and finally finished the info \ntransfer, leaning back and deactivating the comp. Shutting it and looking \ntowards the air vent.\nWith a growl she realized that it was sealed off as well.\nThen the sprinklers activated, as well as a fair amount of foam erupting \nfrom the walls.\nWith a yell of surprise she found herself covered with foam, knowing that \nthey would know where she was now. But she had her own plans.\nWith a sigh of annoyance she wiped the foam from her eyes and headed over to \nthe far wall, scooting to the side as a foam spray activated. Looking at it \nfor a moment, noticing just how much pressure the foam was emitting as it \nemerge. A smile coming across her face as she realized that she would have a \nway out after all. Then plugging it with her finger she leaned against the \nwall with her elbow, smiling wider as she heard the sound of an erupting \npipe and a gushing sound.\nWith all the passer of the foam, her finger plugging it�s only escape route \nso it had to find another way out. So, the pipe exploded and now the foam \nwould be running into the systems or on the floor on the other side of the \nwall.\nIf it was the systems then it would short circuit them, the seals around the \nvent she had first come in deactivating and letting her out.\nIf not, she would be forced to use more expensive tactics. *\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
