He was sparkless \n(heartless) and cared nothing for others, he lived for nothing other then \nbattle. How could one with such a kind spark even think of him as a friend?\nHe looked down at his mech-fluid stained hand again as Tavatron walked away, \nsomehow, someway,she was trying to see something else in him, something \nother then...a warrior.\nDinobot looked from his hand and watched Tavatron walk down the hall, what \nwas she trying to find, what was she looking for? He looked back towards the \ndoors and growled deeply, it wouldn&#39;t matter anyway...there was NOTHING \nthere to find! Nothing at all...but a warrior. A warrior that had taken \nyears to make, that had taken so long to become what it was today. Sparkless \nand cold!\nDinobot snarled as he thought of those two words, &#39;sparkless and cold.&#39; The \nvery definition of himself, nothing more...nothing less.\nHe glared at the doors and dug his claw into his palm again, a harsh reality \nbut one none the less.\nDinobot dug his claw deeper as he continued to think, a reality that had \ncome into solid form as he had lived his past life. He had had to learn how \nto become cold and emotionless in order to survive his training as a \nPredacon soldier, before he had joined Primal.\nBut it was Primal and his people that had tried to show him that there was \nmore to life then complete discipline, there was...life itself!\nDinobot sighed and relaxed his hand, perhaps he would some day see what \nPrimal saw? The secret that made a warrior much more then what he was now, \nmore then he could ever dream.\nDinobot looked back in the direction that Tavatron disappeared in, did she \nknow what that secret was?*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
