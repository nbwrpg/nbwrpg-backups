They fooled you \nthe same as they fooled galvatron by telling him there was a decepticon \nmatrix of leadership. I was lucky enough to have a piece of the autobot \nmatrix to bond with my own spark, it gives me strength. The strength I need \nto take down Aerotaur. If he were a normal enemy it would be one thing. But \nhe claimed his body was made by the devil himself.
