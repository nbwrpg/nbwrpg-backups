Yggdrasil, beast mode!\n\nThe two huge machine guns on his shoulders start bending with some \ncrackling and come to cover his arms and torso. Some of the &quot;spikes&quot; \nin his back rise to cover his head, and a strange looking face \nappears. His legs retract inside and four massive shorter legs prod \nout of him. His transformation is complete. He is now a giant oak \nfiend.\n\nHe moves out quickly about ten meters from the pod and stands besides \nanother rather big tree, not moving. It would be difficult for anyone \nto tell him apart only by sight. He starts using his various \nsophisticated sensors to scan the nearby base.\n\nYggdrasil thinks: Hmm... pretty advanced ecm in that base. If not for \nthe geoscan, I wouldn&#39;t have found it...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rogue Star - Command Center:\n&gt; \n&gt; Devilcat looks at the readout with an arched eyebrow.  &quot;A Maximal \n&gt; ship, planting itself so close to our headquarters?

Done.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The holographic map of Earth showed where some bases were located. \n&gt; &gt; Unluckily, it didn&#39;t reveal anything else. None of the \n&gt; &gt; characteristics, no faction, nothing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But Yggdrasil was worried about the number of bases. Five?!? There \n&gt; &gt; were supposed to be only Maximals and Predacons here! Choosing \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; be difficult...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: Alright. Computer, aim pod launcher on these \n&gt; coordinates. \n&gt; &gt; Launch 15 seconds after my mark.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Before anything else, he relayed a remote detonator for the ship&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; laser to his comm system.
