He frowns. With \nthree bots, \n&gt; the pod would be easier to carry than with one. If they got Brix \nand Octociz \n&gt; split up first, they&#39;d have three bots, including himself, to carry \nthe pods.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Briz/Octociz,&quot; he says into his comm-link as he gallops off toward \nthe pod \n&gt; Octociz had detected, &quot;I&#39;m heading for the pod you found.
