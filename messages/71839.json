Sorry for being so snippy over in character and o=\r\nut of character.  I can see how Tuscon is developing, and hope it will be i=\r\nnteresting and I can contribute to it.  \n\nAnd I don&#39;t mind Wheelie getting =\r\nhis cumuppance for his misbheavior, he contributed to it too.\n\nAnd I was ex=\r\npecting Rattrap to have an interesting method to deal with Wheelie as well.=\r\n  Looking forwards to things!\n\nAnd good posting so far, and sorry for being=\r\n so petty about things or coming off that way!\n\nAnd I&#39;m fine with the attem=\r\npt, just don&#39;t pose hte result for me and I&#39;m good!\n\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: LOL! I can de=\r\nfinitly understand as how folks could get upset with\n&gt; how Tuscon is acting=\r\n, he does seem to be especially mean and ornery\n&gt; these days.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as =\r\nan FYI Tuscon is suppose to be going through some problems\n&gt; that he is hav=\r\ning to come to terms with, mainly anger and agression\n&gt; due in part to his =\r\nnew form. I would suspect that its instincts and\n&gt; temperment is making Tus=\r\ncon&#39;s already short tempor even shorter. So\n&gt; that is why Tuscon is acting =\r\nmore angry and aggressive then normal. So\n&gt; if we can, let&#39;s try to deal wi=\r\nth that aspect in character as best as\n&gt; we can and give Tuscon some really=\r\n good RP.\n&gt; \n&gt; But we can also think that Wheelie&#39;s temporment also gives u=\r\ns a good\n&gt; chance for RP, since we know that he tends to cut pretty deep al=\r\nso.\n&gt; It&#39;s the interation that makes things fun. I look foward to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nYou know though as a thought, I would have imagine that Rat Trap would\n&gt; kn=\r\now how to deal with it better than most. Rat Trap is a simlar style\n&gt; chara=\r\ncter. He doesn&#39;t usually resort to conflict, but rather letting\n&gt; his mouth=\r\n do all the talking - you know how he and Dinobot got along\n&gt; :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Now a=\r\ns to power posing, I am perfectly fine with Wheelie ignoring the\n&gt; implied =\r\ndamage that he took and just side stepping it. No character\n&gt; can pose the =\r\ndamage another character takes, he can only pose the\n&gt; circumstances around=\r\n it and let the other person around it choose what\n&gt; is to happen.\n&gt; \n&gt; As =\r\nfor posting, I will let the others post first. I don&#39;t want to go\n&gt; to fast=\r\n for everyone :)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; On 8/22/11, adamsafran &lt;adamsafran@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC Uhm, Quartz, Wheelie was basically giving your charact=\r\ners some sass, but\n&gt; &gt; then Rattrap and  Straight Shot then tried to assaul=\r\nt him, which if it had\n&gt; &gt; worked would have sent him to the medbay, and no=\r\nw Tuscon is getting in Leo\n&gt; &gt; Prime&#39;s face for having attempted to stop Au=\r\ntobots from starting a fight in\n&gt; &gt; the medbay.  I&#39;m aware he&#39;s your charac=\r\nter and protecting his sister, but I\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t see this exactly as somethin=\r\ng a Prime would do. :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And in the future, please don&#39;t powerpose me=\r\n, pranks or otherwise -\n&gt; &gt; especially when it comes to something that woul=\r\nd inflict significant damage,\n&gt; &gt; liek slamming him into quills!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
