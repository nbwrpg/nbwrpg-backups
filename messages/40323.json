I will accept that absorbing thing however as for using \nit to better herself I will ignore that since that entire energy \nabsorbing and bettering thing is not listed anywhere in \nBlacknightmares bio. Which I just looked at, and if it \nsuddenly &quot;appeared&quot; there I would be very suspicious of it. Also note \nthat energy from sparks doesnt act like normal energy. Since \nBlacknightmare isnt a creation of the Bamphomet and the energy is \nspecifically created to be used solely by those he creates it would \nhave a very bad negative effect on blacknightmare if she absorbed it \nand/or tried to use it to improve anything. I will not reply until \nyou have replied to this. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: GREAT JOB Legendary Nemesys!!!!!  but let me ask you what&#39;s \n&gt; infectrons beliefs, if their balief are &quot;Peace&quot; why Zero is chasing \n&gt; them?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blacknightmare felt chaotical energy  struk her but she would \nfight; \n&gt; like the three ladies she could aborb any type of energy and use it \n&gt; against her enemies, but she has a diference: she could use that \n&gt; energy to improve herself.... but that happen rarely.
