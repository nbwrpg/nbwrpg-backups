This is \n&gt; concerning our biggest security threat right now,no, not Deemos, but \n&gt; Trinity.  She must be trained immediatly to know how to fight, and \n&gt; take care of herself.  She is being held back and that takes our \n&gt; attention in a fight.  Second threat is this Deemos.  Now, Sarge. I \n&gt; say our best chance of survival against him and his growing army is a \n&gt; surprise attack.  I would like you to devise a team, and I will show \n&gt; you my plan.  Now Windlord, Aerotaur, and Axis.  Would you accompany \n&gt; to meet with the Cybers.\n&gt; \n&gt; He opened a commlink to the Cybers.  &quot;This is Grounded, Defense \n&gt; Commander of the Chivtron faction.  We would like a meeting with \n&gt; you.  I am patching through a point where we shall meet.  (today&#39;s \n&gt; iceland.)  22-45-78594.
