They had hurt him yes, but far from dead was he. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Clinging \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the walls of earth slowly the silver ooze climbed and \n&gt; climbed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ever so slightly. Over the course of years it clung and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; scratched \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its way back to the sun. With a spurt liek an eruption of a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gyser a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shiny line of silver shot into the air. Hovering in the air \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; molded into a metallic ball. The sun gleamed against it \n&gt; showing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spark in its center. Its conciousness searched and searched \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; memory a form it could manifest into. Suddenly it sprang \n&gt; forth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; arms \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and legs. It had transformed into Rodimus Prime. Lookign at \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hands and feet his reformed memory circuts connected with \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dark \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spark. The gangled voice that came forth was his spark in a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; projected form and not of Rodimus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Prime..&quot;P..rrrrr....o...t...o..lives!&quot; Suddenly with a burst \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transformed into Starscream&#39;s jet mode and blasted off \n&gt; towards \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nearest Predacon base. &quot;Attention to any predacons please \n&gt; &gt; &gt; contact me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and lead me to your base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
