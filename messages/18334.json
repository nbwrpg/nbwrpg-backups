She didn&#39;t know what this bot was up to, but the whole \nidea wasn&#39;t all that bad. &quot;So your not going to destroy the \necosystem, mearly help it along so both bot and naute can coexist?&quot;  \nShe smiled. &quot;I had never seen that done before, but if it is \npossable, that nature and bot can exist in harmony like that, I&#39;d be \nglad to help try.&quot;\n\nShe smiled and showed her willingness to help.  But her mind was \ntrying to figure out what this bot was really up to.  This bot wasn&#39;t \nwhat she appeared to be.  There was something that LadyHawk was \nhiding.   But she couldn&#39;t quite figure it out.  She wondered why \nthis bot, who knew all this knowledge was having her do most of the \nwork? Then it came to her, LadyHawk didn&#39;t know it all.  But then, if \nshe didn&#39;t know, why pretend to know.  To save her tail feathers? \nMost llikely.  But for now, Squizzy would play along and find out all \nshe could. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk was startled by the revelation. She tried to remain \ncollected.\n&gt; &quot;Are we not disrupting this planets growth just by being here?&quot; \nLady Hawk\n&gt; knew the results every time technology was introduced into an \necosystem. &quot;My\n&gt; hopes aren&#39;t to upset the natural balance but to create a middle \nground\n&gt; between what we are and what the planet could be.&quot; It was an \nargument her\n&gt; father had used hundreds of times but every time the warmongers \nwould turn\n&gt; the argument around and throw it in his face.\n\n\n\n"}}
