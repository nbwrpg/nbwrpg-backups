Rodimus then grabbed Hydras around the&lt;BR&gt;wrist with his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; left &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand. He dug his saw which was in the place of his right&lt;BR&gt;hand, down into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras&#39; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arm. With his balance on his left arm, Roddy flipped both&lt;BR&gt;legs up to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; double &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dropkick Hydras. After hitting this he back flips away and&lt;BR&gt;to his feet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just then Perceptor is heard over the comm system.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus stands motionless, and optics look empty, like all&lt;BR&gt;hope had been &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; lost. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But then...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Enough of this! Maximals, kill these bastards&lt;BR&gt;in cold &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; fluid!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; face shows nothing but hate. He grits his teeth&lt;BR&gt;together, while &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letting &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out an yell that could destroy an audio receptor.
