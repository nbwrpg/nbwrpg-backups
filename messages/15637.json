That was the one\nthing\n&gt; he hadn&#39;t wanted to happen; the giant Alliance gestalt caused too much\ndeath\n&gt; and destruction.\n&gt;\n&gt; A shadow covers Prowl as Dinobot runs up to him, mechfluid spraying over\n&gt; Prowl as Dinobot is hit. He swears, glancing back at Oblitertron as\nanother\n&gt; shadow passes over him, this one of Oblitertron&#39;s foot.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Oblitertron laughs as Dinobot is hit with his optic lasers, bringing a\nfoot\n&gt; down on the two bots. Before the foot has a chance to hit either of them,\n&gt; though, a tail smashes into Oblitertron&#39;s head, the bot stubling to the\nside,\n&gt; his foot missing the Maximals by a few feet.\n&gt;\n&gt; He spins around, firing his rifle and optic lasers at Necromancer.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
