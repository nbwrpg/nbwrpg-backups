An expression of childlike \nwonder crosses her face as she sees the outdoors for what she thinks \nis the first time.  But she&#39;s a little confused, because it all \nvaugely reminds her of something ... something that occasionally \nflashes through her dreams ...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Flicker wants to rush over to her, but realizes it would not be for \n&gt; the best, so he begins unloading quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Gatara activates a remote control as she lands, decloaking the \nship \n&gt; &gt; and allowing Flicker his first good look.  It&#39;s not nearly as big \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; a battleship, but the latter would have a rough time fighting the \n&gt; &gt; former - Rogue Star bristles with assorted weaponry, not all of \nit \n&gt; &gt; Cybertronian in origin.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Personally, I don&#39;t care about the rubber duck.  You&#39;ll see her, \n&gt; all \n&gt; &gt; right,&quot; she tells him, &quot;but she&#39;s staying right here until \nexactly \n&gt; &gt; half your ship&#39;s cargo is aboard Rogue Star.  Riekan!  Jayde!  \n&gt; &gt; Torin!  Let&#39;s go, already!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The two males tramp out of the ship, with Phoenix between them, \n&gt; head \n&gt; &gt; down.  She&#39;s a mess - she hasn&#39;t seen the inside of a CR chamber \nin \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; long time.  There&#39;s no sign of the other Rogue.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well, where&#39;s Jayde?&quot; Gatara asks, irritated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Last I saw, she was in her sister&#39;s room,&quot; Torin explained.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gatara rolls her eyes.  &quot;That explains it.  Alright, let&#39;s get \nthis \n&gt; &gt; stuff unloaded.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
