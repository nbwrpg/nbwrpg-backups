After that, I recovered from other physical damages, but got=\r\n used \n&gt; to being blind.  Other senses compensated for that and I just acce=\r\npted it \n&gt; for what it was.

So much for that. \n&gt; Now that Hydras and the Deceptico=\r\nns are at full force, and us with just a \n&gt; small handful of warriors, I fe=\r\nar that a full sense of calm won&#39;t be \n&gt; achieved.

And maybe \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his personality clashes with yours.

But instead of it exp=\r\nloding into shards of glass and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; debris it simply changed to show a mo=\r\nuntainous scene, a volcano, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then the volcano exploding to reveal =\r\nthe Ark.

They\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all land on a cliff and look back at=\r\n the Ark, and STARSCREAM fires a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blast at the Ark and they all fly of=\r\nf.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Inside the Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMU=\r\nS PRIME is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also is knocked into the beam and his repair process begin=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (OOC: This is the scene from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the =\r\nbots and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cons fell to earth and 4 million years had passed.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; The scene fades to black.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;These sequence of cannot be disr=\r\nupted.&quot; LEGACY intoned coldly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Without the Autobots none of you woul=\r\nd be here.&quot; LEGACY turned back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to face STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;And without th=\r\ne Decepticon&#39;s attack on the Ark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Autobots will not survive.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; LEGACY folded his arms behind his back, &quot;There can be no disruption=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the time flow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There was a small beep on LEGACY&#39;s pa=\r\nnel causing him to look over at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it. &quot;Interesting.&quot; He said curiously.=\r\n &quot;It would seem that I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; required on the bridge.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
