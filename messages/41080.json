Now he has to get some energy. He will have \nto\nhunt down some large animals. He knows it is not fair. It was the most\npainful thing possible to an organic to have their energy sucked out \nof them,\nlet alone to end only in death.\nMustex:Carnitron is there any other way to get the power.\nCarnitron:Well actually there is a small Rocak generator near here \ncapable\nof producing small amounts of Energon that might get us a little \nfarther.\nMustex:I&#39;m on it.\n He runs out.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt;  Mustex comfortably sits at the controls. The others had reported \n&gt; that the\n&gt; ship seemed difficult to control, almost wild, but it is so easy to \n&gt; him.\n&gt; Several times it almost seemed that the ship read his mind. Soon \nthey \n&gt; will\n&gt; have to stop at India. It seems almost sad that at full power this \n&gt; ship\n&gt; could destroy the Ark like it was nothing,but it couldn&#39;t now even \n&gt; fly around\n&gt; the world at 200 mph or 1 billionth of its maximum speed(no current \n&gt; living\n&gt; being could survive its maximum speed although I may later try to \n&gt; negociate\n&gt; wormholes).\n&gt;  Suddenly he is in a darkness.\n&gt; Voice:Master...master...master...\n&gt;  Mustex approaches a strange purple creature.\n&gt; Mustex:Who are you?\n&gt; Creature:I am Carnitron...Master.\n&gt;  Carnitron bows down to Mustex.\n&gt; Mustex:Ca-Car-Carnitron.\n&gt; Creature:Yes that is what you christened me. If you don&#39;t like it I \n&gt; am yours\n&gt; to change.\n&gt; Mustex:So you&#39;re the ship?\n&gt; Carnitron:Yes,but its not important. I am here to give you a \npresent.\n&gt;  He raises his hand and sparks fly at Mustex. Suddenly he is awake. \n&gt; Stallex\n&gt; and Rhesus are there. Still,it is different. There are now strings \n&gt; connecting\n&gt; both objects and ideas to each other. He can even vaguely glimpse \nthe\n&gt; universes core which was both everywhere and nowhere.\n&gt; Mustex:What happened?\n&gt; Stallex:Some kind of power surge. You look like a partial \ntransmetal \n&gt; now. The\n&gt; ship&#39;s behaving better maybe you taught it some manners.\n&gt;  He had. Now that they had talked the ship knew who it could trust.\n&gt; Mustex:Let me have a mirror.\n&gt;  He isn&#39;t a part transmetal he saw. That would have effected both \nsome\n&gt; organics and some robotics,this change effected only his Robotics. \nHe \n&gt; knows\n&gt; what he is.

It burns his hand,but he \n&gt; ignores \n&gt; &gt; it. Then\n&gt; &gt; suddenly sparks jump out of the side and cause his hand to glow. \n&gt; Once \n&gt; &gt; again\n&gt; &gt; he ignores it.\n&gt; &gt; Stallex:Why &quot;Car...\n&gt; &gt; Mustex:Don&#39;t go there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Mustex,Stallex,and Rhesus walk along the Sahara(don&#39;t ask \nwhere \n&gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hover-cycles are)when suddenly the ground caved in under them. \n&gt; When \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stood up they were surprised to see a small spaceship.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:I thin-thin-think it mig-might be Ear-Early Ro-Rocak. \nNot \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; late\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind you,but still a 300 year technological quantum leap ahead \nof \n&gt; &gt; us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  They walk inside and examine it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:The good news is this ship could fly the 3 of us to \n&gt; &gt; Cybertron \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximal reinforcements. The bad news is the powercells are \nshot. \n&gt; &gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bonus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good news is that with this technology we can tap tousands of \n&gt; &gt; energy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sources\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on this planet. The bonus bad news is that the only one that \nwill \n&gt; &gt; &gt; suffice in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; less than 500 years is to drain it from animals,proto-\nhumans,and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other bots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and that&#39;s just cruel.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex:If we want to be the best we have to make sacrifices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:True.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Mustex begins partially charging the ship woth some of his own \n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex:Just be careful not to drain to much.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Just enough to pick up our wrecked hover-cycles\n(OHHH!),and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe get a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lttle more power out of them.\n\n\n"}}
