Night was \n  beginning to set&lt;BR&gt;in, the first sta=\r\nrs were already making their appearance \n  in the dusky&lt;BR&gt;skies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(T=\r\nAG)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Preston&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white; CLEAR: both&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0041_01CC54AB.9C858A80--\r\n\n"}}
