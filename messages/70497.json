The other Fuzors were\n&gt; off on other missions or else they would also be here to witness this\n&gt; event.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hrrmph.&quot; Noctorro said, not one for all those words and wishes. he\n&gt; was a machine of action and combat. But he also turned to look at the\n&gt; operation through the glass, his optics focused on Rodimus and Tuscon,\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus is made of the stuff of leaders and warriors. He will pull\n&gt; through.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Airhammer though did pay heed to the words, &quot;Hope is sometimes all we\n&gt; have.&quot; He glanced at Noctorro, &quot;Even for us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Noctorro nodded.\n&gt;\n&gt; *     *     *     *     *\n&gt;\n&gt; In the medical bay itself Bump and Santon hooked the lines to Tuscon,\n&gt; ensuring that they were secure. With a beep Tuscon&#39;s life signs began\n&gt; displaying themselves on the monitors next to Rodimus&#39; So far they\n&gt; showed that Tuscon was in good condition at nearly full power.\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy came to stand between Rodimus and Tuscon as Bump and Santon\n&gt; turned back to Rodimus with cutting tools in hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; With a nod to Legacy Santon gave the order, and legacy pulled a\n&gt; switch, and  almost immediately Tuscon&#39;s world began to swirl as\n&gt; colors and sounds hit against him . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
