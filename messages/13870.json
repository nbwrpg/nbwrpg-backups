She\nnever did make any friends and it looked like she never would. She felt like\na fool for thinking that it was possible for Wrath to be her friend. She\nsmiles when she remembers the bot that loved her. Than she frowns when she\nremembers the full story. He used her for monthes before he made another\nfembot jealous. Than he ran off with her but before he did he tried to kill\nher. He thought she was dead but she figures that she wasn&#39;t lucky enough\nfor that*\n\n\n\n*Kamodia shakes her head and sits there*\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;RoboRick007&quot; &lt;rfa007@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, August 31, 2000 11:50 PM\nSubject: Hot Rod And Arc&#39;s Talk\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt;\n&gt; Hot Rod looked at ArcAngel, woundering what he had to say.
