With that said, it&#39;s go time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n They transform into SUV modes and drive outside where Night Shift now turn=\r\ns from Autobot into Decepticon. The chase begins quickly and furiously arou=\r\nnd the Ark, as Tucson tries to lure Night Shift away.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Chase me all yo=\r\nu want, you&#39;re not getting your hands on the Matrix!&quot;\n\nLord Elder nodded as=\r\n the two nearly twined Autobots, Tuscon and\nNightshift completed their plan=\r\ns and were ready to put them into\naction.\n\n&quot;I will stay here.&quot; he said, obv=\r\niously still not completely convinced\nthat this plan would work, but was ho=\r\npeful none the less. &quot;Be\ncareful.&quot; He said as he stood and altered the shie=\r\nld so that it would\nburst open for Nightshift, as if he had just broken out=\r\n instead of him\nbeing let out.\n\nHe glanced around for a moment as if he tho=\r\nught he heard something.\n\nWith a small shrug he brought the shield back to =\r\nfull strength and\nresumed his seat to watch the battle unfold via sensors a=\r\nnd cameras\nfrom the Ark.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
