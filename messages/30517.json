He then tosses Megatron back, and is hit in the back by Cutthroat.\n&gt; &gt; As he falls to his stomach, the seecond blast hits Megatron, sending him\n&gt; &gt; down too. For a moment no one moves.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Speedbreaker arrives back at base with Stratus, and lets him go on the\n&gt; &gt; ground. &quot;Who&#39;s winning?&quot; he questions, asking Dead End.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron then stirs, and is met by a fist from Motormaster. Grinding of the\n&gt; &gt; metal fist against his jaw fills his audio modules, and pain fills his\n&gt; &gt; sensory receptors. Motormaster was always strong, he thought, but not\n&gt; &gt; Megatron. As he finished his thought, he sent his fist, plunging it into\n&gt; &gt; Motormaster. Motormaster&#39;s armor buckled under the raw power of the fist,\n&gt; &gt; and indented, and when he recovered Megatron was on his feet. Megatron\n&gt; &gt; moved in, and locked Motormasters hands. They pushed back and forth,\n&gt; &gt; Motormaster teetering on the edge of the cliff. He then pushed back, and\n&gt; &gt; they moved back from the cliff.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron wanted to finish this now, and put all his power into another\n&gt; &gt; push, the circuitry in both warriors hands crackled. Megatron freed one\n&gt; &gt; hand from the death grip, and send it into Motormasters face. The impact\n&gt; &gt; sent Motormaster backwards, and he slipped on the edge of the cliff,\n&gt; &gt; loosing his balance. Before he could fall, Megatron grabbed him by the\n&gt; &gt; shoulder. &quot;This ends now Motormaster&quot; he snarled, and sent one last fist\n&gt; &gt; into Motormaster, and gravity pulled him down the cliff.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He picked up speed, and then hit a jagged rock at the bottom hard, and\n&gt; &gt; stopped moving. Megatron smiled, he hadnt felt battle in a long while, and\n&gt; &gt; enjoyed the strong fight against Motormaster.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
