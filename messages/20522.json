Both bots \nwere excited in anticipation, trying not to act desperate.\n\n&quot;Would you preffer and empty room?&quot; Reptilica asks Desmonus, \nrealizing it was a stupid question as soon as it left his lips.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Desmonus watches as Reptilica turns and looks at her, simply \nstepping a \n&gt; bit closer to him as he steps a bit closer, not minding at all at \nhis \n&gt; attempts to put his arm around her.\n&gt; But knowing that Bloodstraike was also trying to do the same thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; She simply hissed a bit.\n&gt; Let them believe that I give a nano about them, she thought. Let \nthem think \n&gt; that they can get away with trying to extract pleasures from me. \nNot even \n&gt; knowing that all I&#39;m here for now is for a meal. But I can play \ntheir little \n&gt; games, let them think they have the upper hand.\n&gt; As long as I can feed without threat of the supply running \nit ...all is \n&gt; well.\n&gt; But she smiled at Bloodystrikes words and leaned towards him just a \nlittle.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hmm...yes, a good idea indeed. Lead on, Reptilica.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that she simply follwed the males, her stomach growling \nin \n&gt; anticipation all the way.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
