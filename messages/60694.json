My spark is a creation of Vector Sigma, a near complete \ncopy of the original Megatron, up until the year 2005, when Unicron \ncreated Galvatron.  But my memory goes back farther, before the \nQuintessons made Megaton the Tyrant that tried to destroy the \nAutobots.  I am here in search of family, but if any of you stand in \nmy way-.....&quot;After that Percepto said &quot;The should mean, you , so \ncalled Meagatron that you&#39;re a clone... a copy of Our leader... and \ntha mean, Maxima... that he isn&#39;t the true MEgatro, Acopy could \nbe... the true one, no... &#39;cause the TRUE MEGATRON it&#39;s still \nalive... and ya know who is, Maxima&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Megatron Revived:\n&gt;  \n&gt; The clone decended.  This femme was bold, taking a chance that he \nwouldn&#39;t scrap her on a whim.  She definatly was a Predacon.  But \nshe was wrong about him.  About his character and his purpose here.  \nHis face was younger, not the middle aged face of Megatron the \nTyrant, but the youthful face of Megatron before he was driven mad.\n&gt; &quot;I believe you have mistaken me for someone else,&quot; Megatron \nRevived said as he decended to speak with this creature.  She was \nbeautiful.  If he wasn&#39;t looking for family right now, he would \nseriously concider trying to get to know this femme.\n&gt; &quot;I am not the same Megatron that tried to defeat Optimus Prime.  I \nwould explain my origins, but it would be futile, for everyone \nbelieves the biased Autobot and later Maximal Councils.  So, make it \nbrief.  I have little patience or time to deal with idle chit chat.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; MaximaSR74@a... wrote:\n&gt; Endulging in that kiss... the part of her that had finally gotten \nuse to the new form & ideal way of the Transformers... enjoyed this \naffection now. No longer resenting the small organic part of her. \n&gt; \n&gt; As the kiss was broken, she grinned & nodded. &quot;As you wish,&quot; she \npurred. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then gracefully glided out of the chamber... heading towards the \nentrance where the Megatron clone was.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shaking her head as she barely caught sight of Waspinator flying \nout & taking on the brunt of Megatron&#39;s cannon blast.... \n&gt; \n&gt; Striding out through the doors with great confidence, glancing \nbriefly at Perceptor as she passed by him. Then returned her crimson \noptics to gaze upon the haunting fiure of Megatron. Her core \ntwisted... feeling as though her loyalties were going to be tested \nterribly. Ever so loyal to Megatron... but if there were 2 of them, \nhow could she be loyal to both? \n&gt; \n&gt; Remaining bold & confident, she spoke in a likewise voice, &quot;Rather \nbold of you to return to us after all this time!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; That fembot, feline form... slender, attractive for one of her \nstature... white with black stripes in some places... a mix of metal \n& organic... a pair of wings from her back... making her appear \nlikened to an angel. \n&gt; \n&gt; She awaited Megatron&#39;s response. \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
