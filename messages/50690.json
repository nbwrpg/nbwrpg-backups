He&#39;d been listening to the \nconversations in the base entrance.\n\nTo avoid suspicion, he quickly disconnects himself, and transforms \ninto robot mode, quickly expanding as the rest of his body comes out \nof subspace. Not bothering to say anything, he simply observes \nFlicker and Pheonix intently, checking out their weaponry, and \ndefensive abilities based on what he could analyse with his visions.\n\n----------------------------\n\nMegatron enters the control room moments later behind Flicker, \nPheonix, and the other Preds. He immediately goes over to the \ncontrol chair, and sits down. His fingers click on a a keypad \nsituated on side of the chair&#39;s arm. A disply appears above the \nholopad about a metre and a half in front of him.\n\nThe display showed a diagram of the explored portions of the world \nso far, and Megatron wanted to know whether Wolfenstein, Flicker, \nPheonix, or Skulletron had anything to add to the map. He turned his \nattentions to Flicker, instead of the diagram.\n\n&quot;Flicker, you had a plan. So, put it into the computer, and do tell \nabout it. Leave no details out.&quot; Megatron smiles a smile which \nexpressed his intrest in what Flicker had proposed. &quot;Oh, and don&#39;t \nwaste too much time, I have other matters to deal with, like \nplanning the assault on the Tripreds for their insolent attack on \nour base. Those fools will not go unpunished.&quot;\n\nWithout looking as Switchblade, his eyes narrow, &quot;Switchblade... I \nsee you&#39;ve found your way out of the CR chamber.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yah, something like that Megs...&quot; Switchblade nearly yawns, \nexpressing his apparent boredom. &quot;I wonder if the Tripreds have one \nof those artifact piec--&quot; He cuts off, leaving Megatron and the \nothers to fill in the thought.\n\nThe possibility that the Tripreds had one of the pieces of artifact \nwas strongly possibe... something that would have to be looked into. \nMegatron considers it, then his mind shifts back to the present \nsituation.\n\nMegatron waits for Flicker, signaling for the other Preds to let him \ntalk.\n\n\n"}}
