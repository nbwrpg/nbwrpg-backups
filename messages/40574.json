The\nship will never take off.&quot; he pointed his cannon at the nearest thing,\nSwitchblade, and was about to incinerate the Decepticon hacker. Just\nthen though, he had an idea. He turned around, and activated the main\nlaser cannon on the front of the ship. He looked throught the camera\nwith a smile, as they hummed to life.\n______________________________________________________________________\nSea Gulls flew calmly over the ocean, but in seconds they scattered from\na nois, like hundreds of thunder bolts. A ray of intense heat emerged\nfrom the Hudson bay, as the Dark Avian blasted it&#39;s finest weapon. Due\nto not being ancored, the recoil caused the dark ship to fall back on\nthe cliff, and it began to teeter, then the weight of the ship, helped\nwith gravity began to plummet into the Hudson Bay. It landed with a huge\nsplash, sending a tital wave up, and towards the group of fighting\nDecepticons who were on the beach.\n\nMegatron stabalized himself. He turned to his troops. &quot;I have buisness\nto attend to, Switchblade, steer the ship to the location I talked to\nyou about earlier.&quot; with that, Megatron soared out of the floating ship,\nand towards the Obylisk.\n\n"}}
