His fuel pump than sank very quickly\nwhen he didn&#39;t see any. \n\n&quot;Bad move Decepticon.&quot; a voice came from his right flank, as his eyes\nwidened in horror. He whirled around to fire, but as soon as he saw\nCliffjumper, the minibots gun was already smoking, and he didn&#39;t even\nrealise the pain he was in, as the laser from Cliffjumper smashed into\nhis hand holding the gun. He howled in pain, as he was forced to drop\nthe weapon. He then looked at the Autobot, who was reading another shot.\nHe began to see his life flash before his eyes, it was over. \n&lt;The Autobots not much bigger&gt; he thought, it was his only choice. As\nCliffjumper fired again, the stream of laser missed as Caliburst leapt\nover, and towards Cliffjumper. The red Autobot put his hands up, and\ncaught the targetmaster on his forearms, as Caliburst clanked against\nhim. He quickly regained his bearings however, and on desperation,\nflailed his arms, smashing Cliffjumper in the face multiple times, as\nwell as kicking him in the midsection.\n\nCliffjumper had to shut one eye, and looked through pain at the desperat\nbarrage, as he dropped his gun, and jumped backwards, landing on his\nback awckwardly, leaving Caliburst still in the air. The little\nDecepticon then was pulled downward, as Cliffjumper jutted his legs out\nferociously, and with the aid of gravity, sent Caliburst sailing several\nfeet. The Decepticon landed in a disgusting position, with an even\ngrosser thud, and lay there, a motionless piece of crumpled metal, as\nCliffjumper pulled himself up. He spat out a piece of the inside of his\nmouth, and looked through one banged up eye, at all the trouble being\ncause to him, but it looked like it was all over.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s move in.&quot; he suggested to Torca, as he moved down the hill.\n\n"}}
