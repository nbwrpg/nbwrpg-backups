He&#39;ll be well within power limits.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Zardus::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Awake.&#39;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zardus slowly opened his eyes, looking up at the cealing. For a \nfew \n&gt; &gt; seconds he had no idea who or where he was, but slowly his data \n&gt; &gt; tracks activated and he remembered that the Vok had made him go \nto \n&gt; &gt; this lab for an upgrade. The upgrade must have been completed and \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; machine that he had been in must have edjected him out, because \nhe \n&gt; &gt; was laying on his back on a table in the middle of the lab. But \n&gt; then, \n&gt; &gt; he might have walked there and the Vok could have cleared that \n&gt; &gt; knowledge. Zardus groaned and sat up, rubbing his head with a \nhand. \n&gt; &gt; It was simply a reflexive action, though, as he felt perfectly \n&gt; fine. \n&gt; &gt; He froze, seeing his arm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was slightly bigger, still black, but with several red spots \non \n&gt; &gt; it. One was on the back of his wrist, where his wrist computer \nwas. \n&gt; &gt; There were two spots beside that on the sides of his wrist, and \nhe \n&gt; &gt; knew that there were two mini missile launchers that could emerge \n&gt; &gt; from both spots. The launchers would shoot missiles that were \nlike \n&gt; &gt; FZ&#39;s: shielded against lasers and energy draining. They were \nsmall, \n&gt; &gt; manueverable, and fast, but they did not leave a draining field \n&gt; like \n&gt; &gt; his clone&#39;s. These ones only worked if they hit, but they worked \n&gt; more \n&gt; &gt; effectively. The orb was still burned into the palm of that hand, \n&gt; &gt; showing both out of the back of the hand and out of the front, \n&gt; making \n&gt; &gt; his hand a bit see-through.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zardus blinked, looking over his body. He was definately bigger. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; estimated that he would be approaching thirteen feet now, instead \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; the eleven and a half that he used to be. The upgrade was \nobviously \n&gt; &gt; more for efficiency than looks, because Zardus was almost \nidentical \n&gt; &gt; to his old self. Other than the red spots on some weapon spaces \nand \n&gt; &gt; the size increase, he was still covered with his beast mode \n&gt; feathers, \n&gt; &gt; and they still formed an extremely durable armor. In addition to \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; jetpack on his back, jets were attached to his calves to give him \n&gt; &gt; extra speed in the air. He looked at his right arm and issued a \n&gt; &gt; mental command. The bottom of his wrist opened and a large device \n&gt; &gt; rotated down out of it, moving upward untill his hand was around \na \n&gt; &gt; handle and trigger. The device looked like:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Side view:                  Top View:\n&gt; &gt;           ____                      \n&gt; &gt;          /   |                       _|_ \n&gt; &gt;         -    |  )                   |___|\n&gt; &gt;         =---------+                 &#92; . /\n&gt; &gt;                                     (___) \n&gt; &gt;                                       X\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Legend:                     Legend:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        -, = Guns                  | Guns\n&gt; &gt;        ) Trigger/handle           . Trigger/handle\n&gt; &gt;        + Attachment to wrist      X Attachment to wrist\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The device was a high-accuracy weapon. The side two guns both \nshot \n&gt; &gt; lasers, while the middle one shot a small missile with a highly-\n&gt; &gt; explosive shell. There were two cameras in the spaces between the \n&gt; &gt; guns so that the screen that was in front of Zardus&#39;s hand, on \nthe \n&gt; &gt; back wall of the weapon, displayed a depth-preceptive image of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; area. The screen could zoom in and out to provide for better \n&gt; aiming. \n&gt; &gt; Three crosshairs represented the aim of the three guns. With \n&gt; another \n&gt; &gt; mental command, the weapon folded back into his wrist.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;All systems online,&quot; Zardus said without really knowing why, but \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; effect surprised him. He felt his optics charge as the laser-\nfiring \n&gt; &gt; systems that were in them activated, but the real improvement was \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; scanners. He could detect the area around him much better than in \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; old body, able to locate most of the bots in the Iron Fist \nwithout \n&gt; &gt; any external aid. Two guns emerged from his shoulders, aiming \nahead \n&gt; &gt; of him. They could both fire highly-charged plasma beams, but \ntheir \n&gt; &gt; energy packs needed to be recharged fairly frequently. Scanning \nhis \n&gt; &gt; storage compartments, Zardus found that the only pieces of his \nold \n&gt; &gt; equipment that he still had were his plasma launcher, some \ncharges, \n&gt; &gt; several pistols, and a dagger. Two swords were stored in his \ntorso, \n&gt; &gt; able to be charged with energy on command.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zardus knew that even with his advanced body, there were still \nmany \n&gt; &gt; bots on the planet that could prove an equal or a better to him. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t use all his weaponry in a battle, not without passing \nout \n&gt; &gt; from lack of energy after firing so much, as most of the weapons \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; charged on his body&#39;s energy. However, his new body placed him \nfar \n&gt; &gt; ahead of his old one, and he had no doubt that it would come in \n&gt; very \n&gt; &gt; useful.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;I see you like my upgrade,&#39; the Vok says in his head, causing \n&gt; Zardus \n&gt; &gt; to look around needlessly. The Alliance commander powers down the \n&gt; &gt; optic blasts and the shoulder cannons, the latter sliding back \ninto \n&gt; &gt; his shoulders.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Its new, yes,&quot; Zardus replies mentally, flexing his arms and \n&gt; testing \n&gt; &gt; out the movement of his body. It was excellent.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Good. Now go fulfill your task. You will have much trouble \nahead, \n&gt; so \n&gt; &gt; I give you permission to make alliances as you see fit. However, \n&gt; fail \n&gt; &gt; and you will wish you had never crashed on this planet.&#39;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zardus nods and walks out of the room, heading toward Najah and \n&gt; Lady \n&gt; &gt; Hawk. Even though he had gone through an upgrade, he would still \nbe \n&gt; &gt; easilly recognizable as Commander Zardus.\n\n\n"}}
