Superimposing the two, he \n&gt; gets \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rough blueprint to work from.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna have to take you \n&gt; offline \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for a while, while I install the upgrade.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Very well,&quot; she stated with a grace & sophistication in her voice. \n&gt; &gt; She awaited for his instructions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, and for your information... there are some raw materials in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; hold, including Cybertronium. I would prefer my old form back just \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; it once was.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;OOC: BTW, there is pix of Maxima in her transforming mode under \n&gt; &gt; Photos, it&#39;s the 2nd form, both robot & jet mode. If you wish, she \n&gt; &gt; can have a tank mode as well, just I don&#39;t have the tank pic yet. \n&gt; &gt; Under Files is the details of her height, speed, etc. Her exo cover \n&gt; &gt; is basically as tough as Arcee&#39;s if not slightly toughter. \n&gt; &gt; Have fun.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Just as long as it&#39;s inside NBW limitations - ie 16 feet tall or \n&gt; less.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Okey-dokey, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;  Jackie heads to the hold and soon \n&gt; returns with a double-armload of parts.  He glances around for a \n&gt; suitable workstation and settles on a nearby table.  Putting his \n&gt; burden down nearby, he turns to Maxima.  &quot;If you&#39;ll just lie down \n&gt; over here, we can get started.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
