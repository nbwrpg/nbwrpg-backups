Oh, and Oblitertron is no where near the Ark. He&#39;s \nalmost right next to the Alliance base. Do you want to rewrite your \npost, or did your chars fly to the Alliance base in one post?\n\n::Ramulus::\n\nRamulus&#39; eyes narrow as Prebon flies off. That was strange... Very \nstrange, indeed. Prebon seemed to be almost desperate to give up \nSpears, and he would probably have known that he wasn&#39;t worth Striker \nin the first place. Ramulus frowns, a plan forming in his mind.\n\nLost in thought, it takes Ramulus a few seconds to realize Brix was \nadressing him.\n\n&quot;Wha?&quot; he says, shaking out of his trance, &quot;No, we don&#39;t go attack. \nI&#39;ve got a better idea.&quot;\n\nHe walks back to the remaining functional computer panel, inserting a \ndisk and downloading the results of the chip scans. He turns to look \nat Brix and Fliq.\n\n&quot;You two stay here in case of an attack. I got to take care of \nsomething.&quot;\n\nRamulus transforms into beast mode, galloping off at full speed for \nthe Cybertronian Fire.\n\n\n"}}
