Yes, even magma didn&#39;t stopp=\r\n him from trying to help his comrades. He&#39;s got some burn marks in his armo=\r\nr, and that&#39;s his damaged state for now.\n\nBIC: \n\nPerhaps the power he had e=\r\nxtended outward, was in vain. Tucson lies on the ground for a moment or so,=\r\n but slowly rolls back up onto his left side, holding up his upper body wit=\r\nh his arms which shake under the sheer pressure of his weight. He looks aro=\r\nund, and finds Darkhawk, severely weakened by the powerful blast. Night Shi=\r\nft wastes no time in slapping a pair of stasis cuffs on Darkhawk, who in re=\r\nality was Windlord.\n\n&quot;Gotchya. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re in good hands now. Yo, K=\r\nup!

Can&#39;t -=\r\n have it all I suppose, but doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re giving up all together.&quot;\n\nSl=\r\nowly he makes it onto his knees, and then plants one foot down on the groun=\r\nd, hoisting himself up to his feet, with a bit of a stumble. He was weak, e=\r\nxtremely weak, and it was questionable wether or not he would be able to co=\r\nntinue fighting. He didn&#39;t want anyone to see him in such a condition thoug=\r\nh. He fights his weakness and tries to shrug off the grogginess he feels. N=\r\night Shift nodds in agreement with Tucson Prime. \n\n&quot; I hear ya on that one =\r\nbig bot. Sometimes, ya win some, ya lose some, and sometimes it&#39;s kinda lik=\r\ne in the middle of both losn&#39; and winn&#39;n.&quot;\n\nTucson understood that the miss=\r\nion itself would be difficult so he prepared himself for the unexpected by =\r\nworking with that uncertainty that plans don&#39;t always go as they are intend=\r\ned. He shrugs off the fact that Cyclonus is not even scathed by the energy =\r\nattack. He was now curious about Rodimus and how he had handled it. \n\n&quot; Som=\r\nething - Rodimus wasn&#39;t too good at doing. I have a feeling he may not have=\r\n taken this too well, Nightshift.&quot;\n\nNightshift narrows his optics.\n\n&quot; Lemme=\r\n tell ya somethn&#39; Tucson, before you became a Prime, and he was on the job,=\r\n it didn&#39;t look like his spark was totally in his work. But you, the quiet =\r\nguy in the corner, the guy who threw caution ta the wind ta save his comrad=\r\nes, the guy who faces adversity as it comes and ain&#39;t afraid of it, and the=\r\n guy who actually learned from his loss rather than complain&#39;n about it. Yo=\r\nu got what it takes, and always had it. It - just wasn&#39;t obvious because yo=\r\nu&#39;re too modest for your own good and you kinda just kept ta yourself most =\r\nof the time.&quot;\n\nTucson listens thoughtfully to Nightshift.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re right, =\r\nI wasn&#39;t much for words at the time... But back then, I wanted to approach =\r\nRodimus on his not so pleasurable attitude on his position as a Prime. It s=\r\neemed as if he didn&#39;t want it. And you know, responsibility isn&#39;t for every=\r\none. And for some, it&#39;s second nature.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot; Understandab=\r\nle. Now I admit, I dunno if I could ever take your job big guy. Not that I =\r\nain&#39;t capable of it, I know I ain&#39;t a good match for the position. And I ai=\r\nn&#39;t afraid ta admit that.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime nodds once, and studies Cyclonus o=\r\nnce more. Something dawns on him. He seemed relieved to be free of somethin=\r\ng. \n\n&quot;Is it me Cyclonus or do you appear to be liberated of something that =\r\nmay have been holding you back? Why do you work with Hydras anyway? What is=\r\n the purpose of working with him when you can be your own individual? Your =\r\nlife should be as you intended, and not what others have intended for you. =\r\nIt boils down to freedom. You have the chance to experience freedom. If I w=\r\nere you I&#39;d take that chance now. As a matter of fact, Scorponok, Scourge, =\r\nwhat seems to be holding you two back here, when you yourselves can be your=\r\n own individuals as Decepticons? Does Hydras have you on some sort of leash=\r\n? I see no such restraints so that means if you want freedom you should als=\r\no take it.&quot;\n\nNight Shift could see what Tucson was up to. It was one of his=\r\n thinking outside the box kind of strategies. And a strategy that would ben=\r\nefit all and not just one faction. Tucson was trying to break new ground, a=\r\nnd as crazy as it all looked, he sits back to watch it all take place. Tucs=\r\non Prime now steps asside and waits to see if any of them either try to des=\r\ntroy him, or actually agree with what he was trying to tell them.\n\n&quot;Whateve=\r\nr any of you chose, your decision is your own and I will not interfere. We =\r\nmay not be allies, but I do respect the need for one&#39;s free will.
