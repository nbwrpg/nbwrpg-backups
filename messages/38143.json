Megatron put his arm with the fusion cannon to his chest to\n&gt; announce himself. &quot;I am Megatron. Leader of the Decepticons.&quot; He \nlooked\n&gt; down at them, for their response.\n\n\n::Domnijoe and Blindchaos::\n\n    Blindchaos completely disregarded the &#39;no-smirk&#39; demands Domnijoe \nimplemented on him. He gave Megatron the biggest, brightest (and to \nDomnijoe, the most disgustingly sweet) smile he could muster. The\ngrin \nheld the charm of a young puppy who would do anything ordered of him.\n    &quot;Name&#39;s Blindchaos.&quot; he said, staring up. &quot;I specialize in\ntorture \nand interrogation.&quot; He threw his thumb over his shoulder, pointing\nout \nDomnijoe. &quot;She&#39;s told me much about you.&quot; His smile became more \ncandied, but it held a hint of what he was truely capable of. &quot;I am \nhonored to serve you.&quot; he said and stepped backward, letting his \nfemale companion speak.\n    The Decepticon femme&#39;s look was dirty when she looked at \nBlindchaos, but became respectful when she looked up at Megatron.\n    &quot;Hello again, Lord Megatron.&quot; she said. &quot;Long time no see.&quot; She \nsaluted. Her gaze was unafraid, bold but leery of someone with \nMegatrons strength and reputation. &quot;Domnijoe at your command.&quot; she \nsaid. &quot;I served under you before your disappearance on Earth. This is \nthe first time we have spoken. I would be honored to serve you again.&quot;\n    Blindchaos chuckled.\n    &quot;She&#39;s a kick tale pipe and take names gal.&quot; he said. &quot;But she&#39;s \ngot good aim and eager in battle.&quot; His smile faded some. &quot;Although\nI&#39;m \nnot much good in a fight, I can make prisoners sing like a bird.&quot;  \nDomnijoe saw Blindchaos&#39; grin become sadistic, the first time since \nshe met him. Pushing the image from her mind, she eagerly looked at \nMegatron for her first orders.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n******************\n\n\n"}}
