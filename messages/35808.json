It certainly looks like Slaughter is between a boulder and a\n&gt; &gt; very hard place.  Since just entering the Decepticon base, he&#39;s went\nfrom\n&gt; &gt; the frying pan into the fire!  I lost Skulletron once, I won&#39;t have him\n&gt; &gt; ressurected into Slaughter and be lost again!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; IC:  Slaughter was getting desperately hungry, and had to eat soon or he\n&gt; &gt; would die, but he also had to avoid being blown to pieces.  Many\n&gt; projectile\n&gt; &gt; explosives were being shot at him.  Slaughter was hit by 15 rifle shots\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; FireStrike, and this time only a few bits of flesh flew off, but slime\n&gt; still\n&gt; &gt; flew everywhere like normal.  Slaughter got away from Stratus.  He\n&gt; forward,\n&gt; &gt; but high enough, and stuck his pincirs into the ceiling, then acted like\n&gt; &gt; their was sticky things on his hands, and quickly went across the\nceiling,\n&gt; &gt; avoiding the mega missile, and the rockets, and all shots that were\nheaded\n&gt; &gt; at him(sorry for missing all those shots, but I didn&#39;t want my new\n&gt; favourite\n&gt; &gt; character to die!)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Slaughter jumped down from the ceiling, onto the floor again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      &quot;HUNGRY!!!&quot; Was the only thing Slaughter seemed to be, and be able\nto\n&gt; &gt; say.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Slaughter lunged at Shokaract, opening his jaw to try and take a\n&gt; bite\n&gt; &gt; out of Shokaract.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
