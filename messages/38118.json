It stood somewhat hunched on\ntwo feet, it&#39;s oblong head forward to maintain balance.\n\nOn the right a snake alien made from Najahs cobra DNA coiled about five feet\ntall. Its forked toung dripping deadly venom suitable for melting it&#39;s prey\nbefore digesting it. It uncoiled pushing itself to it&#39;s full length of\naproximately fifteen feet. A dark green crossbread of it&#39;s serpentine scales\nand the aliens armored almost shelllike skin reflected the light of the\nroom. It flexxed a hood about six feet in diameter. &quot;An impresive sight if I\nmay be so modest.&quot; Lady Hawk was torn by her accomplishment. She was\nfearfull for what these crossbreeds were to be used for, but she couldn&#39;t\nhelp to feel a small bit of pride based on the life she had just created.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 23, 2001 1:20 PM\nSubject: Re: Wolfgang\n\n\n&gt; ::Zardus/FZ::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus nods. &quot;We have stasis pods, but not any Maximal ones.
