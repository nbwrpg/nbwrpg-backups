I am also good with\ndemolitions.  I don&#39;t think my past is terriably important, but if you must\nknow I grew up off of Cybertron on a ship with my parents and brother.  My\nbrother died and my parents commited suicide because of my proding.\nImmediately there after I comandeered the small ship, which wasn&#39;t hard\nbecause I was now alone on it, and spent some time wandering around.  I got\ninto some crossfire in orbit.  The bigger ships probably never noticed me\nthere.  I climbed into the one stasis pod on board and the ship was\ndestroyed.  The next thing I knew I woke up here on this strange planet in a\nfield of llamas.  Then Burning Hammer came for me and I walked here with\nhim.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
