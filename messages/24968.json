He growls, reaching back and \nthrowing Megatron off him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise smashes through a tree, seeing Marine firing at EndBringer and \ncharging at the bot, swinging his claws at his back.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer doubles over, nearly coughing his &#39;lungs&#39; out as he \ninhales the gas. He jumps back, firing rather blindly at Tankorr with \nseveral missiles.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther turns sharply around, several bolts nearly hitting him. He \nflies as fast as he can away from the energonians, wanting to lose \nthem.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven trips on a rock, falling and spinning so that the cluster \nmissiles would hit Aerostreak. He wanted the bot off. Greven didn&#39;t \nappreciate being chocked, but he could go on without air for a little \nwhile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Megatron sees the charge sail towrds him. He curses and runs \nas the \n&gt; blast explodes behinde him. He is sent flying forward, slamming \ninto \n&gt; Killfest, with a back smoking from the burn of the blast.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tankkor yells as he knee cap bursts from Marines shot, and \nalso from \n&gt; the large amount of electricity. He thrashes, and fianlly frees \nhimself, \n&gt; rolling away from Endbringer. Marine, meanwhile, extends his hand. \nA small \n&gt; tip slides from his wrist, it was tipped with a gas bullet. On \ncontact it \n&gt; would release a knock out gas....but, in Endbringers case it just \nmight send \n&gt; him into a violent coughing fit. Marine fired.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Aerostreak drives his hands deeper into Grevens neck, using \nall of his \n&gt; strength to choke the bot. Tarantulas is slapped to the side, but, \nwith \n&gt; Greven so close, he fires another batch of cluster missles at close \nrange.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Putnam, Venus, Akron, and Odiphious continue to follow \nScyther. When \n&gt; they hit him, the energon gave a quick siloquette of his figure. It \nvanished, \n&gt; but gave them something to go on.\n&gt;        They continued, all of them, to fire at Darkmouse and \nScyther. Blue \n&gt; blasts of energon enegy lit up the skies.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Jackle, Gremlin, Pheniox, and Nighteyes gather together, \nunder cover. \n&gt; The odds agianst them is great. &quot;Alright, split up and take these \nguys as far \n&gt; away from here as possible. We already took out Dollen....&quot; Gremlin \nsays, as \n&gt; he scans over a wound with a medkit.\n&gt;        Nighteyes nodds, turns, and hauls south. Gremlin takes \nnorth, Pheniox \n&gt; goes west and jackle goes east.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Hell Beast opened the door to look at Shockwave, &quot;AH, sorry \nto keep \n&gt; you waiting. Please, come in.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        Rampage, Inferno, and Waspinator watch the display showing \nthe battle. \n&gt; They shook thier heads. It was messy.\n\n\n"}}
