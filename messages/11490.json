She cursed but had little time to \ndo anything else as the door unsealed, snapping her head towards the door \nand shielding her eyes with her hand from the light that filtered in as it \nopened.\nCold and soaked from the sprinkler systems she was enveloped in light, \nsnarling at the fact that she had been found out.\nShe took her hand from her eyes but had no time to react as she was suddenly \nhit by something, slamming her back against the wall and knocking her head \nback to his it as well.\nBut instead of being able to simply stand to see what was the matter other \nrapid shots pinned her to the wall, taking one after the other in the chest \nplate. Her cloaking device short-circuiting due to the wetness. The air \naround her shimmering until she was no longer cloaked, the cloaker on her \nhip now useless.\nFinally the shots ended but then she was suddenly shot a few times in the \nknees. Them bucking and causing her to fall to them and her hands, the water \naround her hands and legs turning red with her own mech-fluid.\nBrightBlade shook from cold and shock, her system wracked with damage and \npain.\nShe slowly looked up towards the door, her face splattered with her own \nfluid.\nIt was a Maximal, his cannon aimed at her, not realizing before but he had \ncharged and it was his shots that had gotten her.\nA bit of mech-fluid came up her throat but she didn�t notice, it leaking out \nof her open mouth as she squinted towards Firearm, shaking.\nShe lifted one of her hands from the floor and touched it to her chest, then \nlooking at the shaking hand as it dripped fluid, simply setting it back onto \nthe floor to support her weight again.\nRex�s words almost seemed as if they were far away, her squinting eyes \ntrying to focus on his back shape against the blinding light of the doorway.\nBrightBlade groaned and took in a breath and coughed, slowly getting to her \nfeet but clinging to the wall to make sure that she didn�t fall.\nShe had been shot down before she had had a chance to do anything, these \nMaximals had gotten better.\nBut there was just one hitch, she was unarmed. She had had no room for \nweapons with all the gadgets she had brought. But she had completed her \nmission and had gotten the data. She was done.\nEven if she was captured now she would find a way to get away, there was no \nchance in the Pit that they could take all of her devices from her.\nBrightBlade looked towards Firearm and Rex as they stood before her, a \npained but helpless look in her face. Noticing that Smokescreen and Grimmler \nhad joined them as well.\nBut then her expression changer to one of defiance, she had won over them \nwhether they knew it or not.\nEven now the data would be analyzed and accepted. She had seceded.\nBrightBlade looked towards Rex with a smile on her face, wrenching as her \nchest sparked and her knees gave out. She fell to her knees and looked up at \nthem.*\n\n� What are you going to do, shoot me?!�\n\n* She was unarmed and she was riding on the fact that Maximals wouldn�t \nattack her if they knew, but some didn�t. She would have to see.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
