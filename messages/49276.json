He prepares\n&gt; for return fire, \n&gt; as his red optics finally find a lone Tripred, who\n&gt; could only be \n&gt; their leader.\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade frowns, as he starts hacking the lock\n&gt; combo on a \n&gt; slightly larger storage container. His green optics\n&gt; flicker, giving \n&gt; away his irritation. \n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade redoubles his efforts, nearing a\n&gt; succesful unlock, &quot;Damn \n&gt; locks are made better these days... but still not\n&gt; good enough for \n&gt; me.&quot; He makes short work of the last part of the\n&gt; protection, and \n&gt; with a victorious evil grin opens the lid.\n&gt; \n&gt; His grin is short lived, as a violent explosion is\n&gt; triggered by his \n&gt; opening the case. Switchblade is thrown backwards,\n&gt; and he smashes \n&gt; into another containder, scratching it&#39;s hard\n&gt; covering slightly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Th...&quot; *bzzt* &quot;That...&quot; He struggles to get to his\n&gt; feet grumbling \n&gt; to himself, &quot;was unexpected.

Being such a\n&gt; feather weight bot, he \n&gt; was easily tossed by the explosion.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks into the mysterious box.\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ooC:\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the artifacts storyline idea, I&#39;m guessing\n&gt; that people don&#39;t \n&gt; mind that much. Therefore, I&#39;ll go ahead with it,\n&gt; but I&#39;m not sure \n&gt; what the effect of the of the artifacts will be, so\n&gt; i&#39;m going to \n&gt; encourage that people email me with ideas. =) I&#39;ll\n&gt; choose the best \n&gt; one, or a combination of effects. Since this is a\n&gt; storyline thing, \n&gt; It does sorta affect everyone. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle, in reply to this post which is copy/pasted at\n&gt; the bottom of \n&gt; this email:\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, that&#39;s fine with me. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Since we&#39;re finally getting into the\n&gt; artifacts,\n&gt; &gt; and rAuq has yet to answer my e-mail concerning\n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll bring this up right here.  I say the\n&gt; documents\n&gt; &gt; stolen from Snowowl the day of her murder were all\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Maximal research concerning the artifacts, and\n&gt; &gt; Megatron ordered the assasination.
