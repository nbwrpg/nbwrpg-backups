This was the first attack in a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;new War, the first blow. At the same time, he feared what the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;Predacons, all of them, would do. For now, though, he had no other&lt;BR&gt;&gt;choice. He had to show the Minions that the Silver Wings were not&lt;BR&gt;&gt;going down... or at least not alone.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;RazorWing: Shieldings Battalion, prepare to board for immediate low&lt;BR&gt;&gt;orbit intervention. Shieldings Battalion, prepare for immediate \naction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;The Shieldings battalion was not the fastest nor the strongest the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;Silver Wings had mustered, but they were a vigorous and resistant&lt;BR&gt;&gt;unit. Razorwing trusted their abilities to defend the station.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;In a matter of minutes, the Blackfeather warship was launched. It was&lt;BR&gt;&gt;going to engage the minions, then unload the troops it transported to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;offer a maximum resistance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;The Silver Wings, however, had kept hidden their starship development&lt;BR&gt;&gt;program. Razorwing knew he would hear it from the other Lord.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;But he had other business to do, and they would have to answer too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;T1msn Search.
