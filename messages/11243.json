But he didn�t flinch and never showed any signs of discomfort, since there was nothing he could do there was no point in making a big deal out if it.\nHe was awake even though his eyes were closed, taking in all of the night sounds as the sun dipped down. Gathering the energy in which he would need to get Tavatron back to the Cybertronien Fire, knowing that the way ahead was rough and he would need every inch of power he could muster to get her to safety. But he would do it, even if he had to drag himself through the front door with his teeth!\nDinobot took in a deep breath and released it; his wounded side feeling as if it weighed far more then it did, pressing down onto his metallic lungs.\nAs much as he tried to relax his side it seemed to tense up just after he thought he had succeeded, annoying him greatly and causing his tail to swing slightly behind him. He had done everything he could have to tent to his wounds, and now he was tending to his power supply. Powering up whatever energy he had to make the journey ahead.\nIt was then that he heard Tavatron transform into beast mode and howl, also hearing several answering howls off into the distance. Not understanding a single phrase.\nTheir haunting voices fading away into the darkness as the silver moon rose in the east, a full circle appearing through the trees and gradually climbing the sky. The stars already out and shining above, casting their own amounts of light onto the Earth.\nDinobot sighed as a small wind picked up, cool and dry as it swept in through the trees and into the glade.\nIts calming winds seemed to flow over his wound, soothing the constant pain slightly.\nIt was then that he opened his eyes, watching the blades of grass dance inches from his snout as the wind continued to sweep in.\nThe surroundings were bather in deep purple, blue and black, white lights burning in the sky above as the moon continued to rise in the east. It was night, a time when it stirred the blood of all wild creatures.\nA time where shadows reigned supreme.\nIt was that that Tavatron�s voice suddenly broke the silence, yet, seeming almost as soothing and gentle as the wind which flowed over his wound.\nHe concern did her credit, however, it was not needed. He was far from dying  from lose of mech-fluid. But if he continued to bleed as he was then he wouldn�t be far for long.\nBut there was nothing that she could do to help him, and what she could he knew she wouldn�t.\nA growl sounding from between his fangs as he shifted his head, then laying it back onto the grass inches from where it had been before.*\n\n� There is nothing you can do.�\n\n* He took in and exhaled another deep breath, feeling the weight of his injured side again but giving no external indication of his discomfort.\nClosing his eyes again, Dinobot began to concentrate on his energy levels again. Building enough to get them home without a hitch, perhaps even having a bit left to get himself to his new quarters and repair after seeing Tavatron into a CR chamber.\nIt was then that he heard Tavatron raise herself, wondering if she was going to rest now and stop worrying about him. With all that happened she deserved a rest, knowing that being strapped to a torture table could not have been the best experience.\nHe lay there, expecting to hear the soft steps of her retreating to a more comfortable area and leaving him to rest and recover his energy, however, he only heard a set of two steps that were actually approaching him.\nAgain he heard her voice, but what he heard was not what he expected to hear.\nInstead of informing him that she was going to rest in a different location, she told him to be still. But�why?\nIt wasn�t two seconds later when he found out!\nAt first he felt a paw on his back, it actually causing his back to shift with the weight it expressed.\nHis eyes shifting in that direction to see just what was going on, a very uncomfortable feeling washing over him.\nDinobot had never liked anybot near him while he was injured, with Tavatron�s paw so close to his open wound his systems began to tense up again. Causing a powerful wash of pain to pass over him, knowing that his color would have drained if he had been anything else then silver.\nHe felt her weight shift, however, towards him?\nDinobot lifted his head with a growl but one that was more questioning then aggressive, wondering what she was doing so close to his wound like that.\nBut then it hit him, she was going to CLEAN it!\nHis head snapped up from the ground, suddenly coming face to face with Tavatron�a bit too late.\nBy then she had already cleaned his wound and had backed off, leaving him completely surprised and confused. \nHis expression was that of puzzlement as well as amusement as he watched Tavatron spit out the foul tasting mixture of spark extraction and hydraulic fluid, then watching her run to the brook quickly and wash her mouth out.\nNarrowing his eyes at her for a moment before turning his gaze to his wounded side, noticing that a new sheet of fluid had replaced the old, however, the flow was definitely slower.\nWith a painful snarl he slowly got to his feet, feeling his stomach rumble but knowing that it would be a goof solar-cycle until he ate again. Looking towards the brook where Tavatron was now resting, knowing that he could fill his stomach with the cool liquid and keep the hunger pangs away.\nWith a pained groan he willed his stiff limbs to move, then beginning to make his way slowly towards the babbling brook.\nIf it wasn�t his wounds that were screaming then it was his stomach, sounding almost as if it was beginning to devour his internals to satisfy his hunger.\nWith a growl he reached the brook a few feet down from Tavatron and dipped his snout into the water, bringing in as much water as he could in one mouthful and swallowing.\nIt was then that he suddenly felt his stomach heave, spitting out what water he had in his mouth in order to keep the contains on his stomach down.\nOf course, there were internal damages. Thinking of just how foolish it was of him to forget.\nWatching mech-fluid flow down the stream and into the forest from what he had spit out�and internal bleeding.\nAlso a fairly good reason of why his side had bled so much, just as his chest was continuing to bleed.\nHowever, during all of this ha managed to keep all of his actions calm, in order to make sure that Tavatron would get the rest she needed and not to concern herself with him again.\nThe only thing betraying him, if one cared to look hard enough, was the mech-fluid trickling from his tightly closed jaws.\nBut he turned his head away and lifted his body away from the water, slowly making his way back to the fluid stained rise.\nIt was a bit obvious that he had to conduct a few internal repairs before they moved out, it taking no more then a few cycles. Nothing more.\nDinobot came to the top of the stained rise and was just about to ease himself down onto the soft grass, suddenly noticing two strange bots that had just entered the clearing.\nHe eyed them, keeping on his feet and rising to his full height, even wondering if Tavatron had noticed them.\nHe growled. Their signatures showed that of Maximals, but he had never noticed them before.\nMust be new bots.\nDinobot looked towards Tavatron quickly before locking his eyes on the strangers, his fangs bared towards them.*\n\n� Who are you?�\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
