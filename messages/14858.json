He \nplaces the Maximal on a chair, strapping him in. Tapping a few keys on the \nconsole to get the shuttle ready for liftoff, activating the autopilot system \nto fly back to the CF in five minutes, Ramulus runs back outside.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not gonna let you fight this alone,&quot; he says, his gun ready as he comes \nup to Brix, &quot;We&#39;ve got 5 minutes to get this over with, or the shuttle leaves \nwithout us.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker&#39;s eyes widen as he sees Savage suddenly go for Spears.\n\n&quot;Watch out!&quot; he yells, continuing to fire on Savage. He growls as he moves \nquickly flying toward Savage, the sudden movement sending a spasm of pain up \nhim. He hadn&#39;t realized that the bot&#39;s fireball would do so much damage.\n\n"}}
