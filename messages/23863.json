He barely dodged an EMP blast, cursing.  \n&quot;I&#39;m always the main target!&quot; he yelled, firing down to missiles at Teltoli.  \nHis bottom was down towards the ground, so he was not effected by the flare.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown transformed into his artillery mode, firing off a shell at the \nCybertronian Fire.  The flare went off, but since Breakdown didn&#39;t have any \noptics in this form, he was unharmed.\n\n---\n\nPyro transformed to tank mode, firing off three fire balls at Hot Rod, \ndriving for him.  &quot;You&#39;re going down traitor!&quot;  Being in a tank form, he was \nnot effected by the flare.\n\n---\n\nHiss energized his fusion cannon.  He ducked down, as his optics were blinded \nby the flare.\n\n---\n\nScavenger laughed as the flare went off.  He remembered the last time Magnus \nhad tossed a flare, and had prepared himself.  He fired off 25 explosive \nrounds at Magnus, charging at full speed.\n\n---\n\nSixshot dived downard, avoiding most of the shots, some clipping his back \ndorsal fin.  He yelled out in an attempt of intimidation, firing off ten \nrapid laser blasts at Aerotaur.  His bottom was pointed to the ground, so the \nflare had no effect.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw drove up to the scene of the battle, launching off two missiles at \nthe Cybertronian Fire, the weapons exploding against the shields.  The flare \nwent off, and a cycle later out popped his brethren, Demon Wulf and Flesh \nRipper.\n\nDemon Wulf touched to the ground, raising his sword to point at Gabriel, and \nfiring off a blade missile at him, the blade of his sword being replaced in \nless than a second.\n\nFlesh Ripper fired off ten rapid optic blasts at Rex, walking towards the \nMaximal with his teeth showing and his claws outstretched from his finger \ntips.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch saw autogun fire hit near him, trying to hit a fellow Alliance \nmember next to him (Godfather).  He saw Teltoli open fire on Godfather, and \nraised both pinchers, and smiled to himself while in his stealth mode.  &quot;Bye, \nbye...&quot; he cursed and covered his optics as the flare went off, still \ninvisible though.\n\n---\n\nManterror covered his optics, but soon regained his composure, firing down \ntwo ion disks at Caitiff.\n\n---\n\nInjector dived, but the flare blinded him, sending him slamming into the \nground, an EMP blast hitting his knee joint and making his leg useless \ntemporarily.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee averted his eyes from the flash, and awaited until it cleared.  He \nfired down a total of six stinger missiles at the Cybertronian Fire, three \nfrom each weapon.  He watched them explode against the shields, and then \ndodged autogun fire.\n\n---\n\nAres transformed to tank mode.  But in midtransformation, the flare went off \nand blinded him, so he collapsed, holding his optics, in midtransformation.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor slithered, transforming into biped mode and charging, seeing Magnus \nfire the flare into the air.  He deactivated his optic sensors until the \nflare died out, and reactivated them.  He hoisted his plasma launcher up \nagainst his shoulder, and fired a blast at the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n---  \n\nCaitiff flew backwards, slamming to the ground from all the shots.  He got \nup, chest bleeding, when one ion disk passed over his head, and the other \nslashed off his left hand.  He fell to his knees, letting out screams of pain.\n\n====\n\nChordate slammed his fist against an armrest of his chair.  &quot;Slag it!  \nKluster, requesting authorization to use the missile launchers.  We need to \nfire them into the bulk of the Alliance to scatter them.&quot;  He watched as the \nshields dropped to 74%.\n\n\n\n"}}
