All she knew was that that fem-reptile was in for the shock of\nher\n&gt; life if she thought she could overpower Hell Beast.\n&gt; Of course, BrightBlade would never try such a stunt, she wanted to die in\n&gt; battle...not at the hands of her commander.\n&gt; She herad Dremona tell the she-spider and Pheniox to drop in later and\nbring\n&gt; the rest of the fembots with them.\n&gt; She narrowed her optics at that fact, this could prove to be useful but\nnow\n&gt; was not the time. She had other plans, involving the Maximals.\n&gt; BrightBlade walked up to the bridge and up to Hell Beast, if she had a\nplan\n&gt; then it was all his right to know about it. Besides, it was her time to\n&gt; report on events.\n&gt; She kneeled down in front of her commander and bower her head, the actions\n&gt; meaning nothing more then COMPLETE respect and loyalty.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I have a bit of information on the Maximals and Alliance if you wish to\n&gt; hear, My Lord.\n&gt; That croon, Zardus has kidnapped the fembots Tavatron and Iron Raptor.\nThis\n&gt; two forces in which are now not a problem, held and captive. Which means\n&gt; that our own forces do not need to worry about that reptile transforming\n&gt; into that huge behemoth, thus, kicking our own skid-plates.\n&gt; However, the Maximals are abandoning the Ark now and moving into an even\n&gt; bigger battle ship, a problem to the fullest.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then took in a deep breath, the information in which she had\nobtained\n&gt; about the new ship could prove useful. If she was permitted she would\nenter\n&gt; the new ship and scope out the weaponry, giving Hell Beast all of the\n&gt; information she found.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; My Lord, the weapons on the new Maximals abode are extremely powerful\nand\n&gt; will create a problem for us. However, I have an idea. With you permission\nI\n&gt; will infiltrate the new ship and collect the information on the weaponry\nand\n&gt; bring back a full-scale diagram of every room and crawl space in that\nship.\n&gt; With my hacking skills and hot wiring ability I will be able to map every\n&gt; weak point in that ship and relay the information to you. A step towards\n&gt; defeating the Maximals at their own game.\n&gt; But, of course, only with you permission...Lord.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Then, on her knees she waited for her commander&#39;s reply.\n&gt; Not sure of his reaction her spark sped up a bit, knowing that he didn&#39;t\n&gt; like failure and knowing that she was most likely to be punished if she\ndid\n&gt; fail.\n&gt; The thoughts of what he would do to her flashed behind her optics,\nwondering\n&gt; about which actions would be worse.\n&gt; But she was loyal, she would continue to fight for Hell Beast if he even\n&gt; nearly killed her.\n&gt; She was just that type of bot.\n&gt; But then another thought creesed her mind: Where was Gangon?\n&gt; She hadn&#39;t seen hide nor hair of him for the past few weeks, where could\nhe\n&gt; be?\n&gt; But she waited, listening carefully for her Lord&#39;s decision.*\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Special Offers in July from Tupperware.com!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6336/13/_/_/_/962928014/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
