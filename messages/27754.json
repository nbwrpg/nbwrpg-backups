His armor took most of it, but the pain was still felt. \nFirearm&#39;s jetpack worked harder as the gravity increased, but he \nstill managed to clear the ash and blast up toward the sky.\n\n&quot;Eat this!&quot; he yells, firing three charges down at Dead-End, Drag \nStrip, and Skullgrin.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster gets up, shaking ash off of himself from the shuttle \nexplosion. He picks a bot on his scanners and fires two missiles at \nDead-End.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::??::\n&gt; \n&gt;        A pod lands quickly, and oddly, near the Cybertronian Fire.  \nOut steps a robot in perfect shape, and appearing really frightening \nand monstrous.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;Skullgrin is back!!!!&quot; He said in triumph.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Skullgrin then heard the battle.
