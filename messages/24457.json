From her perspective, it was all color and texture, \npartially hidden from view by the many veils of clouds.  But the ebony pools \nwithin their aqua casings enlarged, and all became clear.  The metallic shine \nof robots and faux beasts of the land and lower atmospheres winked up at her, \nand each flare of crimson and orange near the ground was observed and taken \ninto record.  \n\n    Considerable attention was also payed to the titanic inert mass that was \nthe center of the world at the time.  From here, it did not seem so grand, \nnor important.  And yet tiny creatures around it were scuffling about like \nants for possession.  Or was there some other purpose...?  For such musings \nshe would have to be closer, and learn more of those many scrambling robots \nbelow.  \n\n    &quot;Starting to get pretty bored with this flighty-lighty cloudland crud \nanyway..&quot; \n\n    Metal pinions swept back, changing their angle and that of their owner.  \nFor a moment there was the image of a white shape curling gracefully through \nthe air above a sea of clouds.  Then she dived into that deep misty sea.  \nTrails of water vapor accompanied her as she left the high heavens \naltogether, twirling around her wings and neck.  Silently, the avian glided \ndown from the sky, taking up a perch on a rock outcrop not particularly far \nfrom the battle.  Folding her wings, she gazed across the grassy plain, \nobserving the world from this new perspective.  Perhaps things anew would be \nseen, as such happens often when you look at things from a di--  &quot;It is HOT \nout here.&quot;  Or not.\n\n    From here she spotted another large mass, but unlike the first this one \nwas moving.  And it was under attack.  &#39;Whee, destruction!&#39; the bird mused to \nherself, settling back on the rock.  &#39;Whichever ones win...I suppose I&#39;ll \nhave a chat with them.&#39;  Sky blue oculars half closed as the equivilant of a \ngrin darted across that ebony beak.  She waited.\n    \n    And waited.\n\n    A tumbleweed bounced on by.\n\n    A bug crawled across her foot.\n\n    &quot;.....&quot;\n\n    Her wing itched.\n\n    &quot;FINE then.  TAKE your time.  MAKE me come over there.&quot;  The bird \nannounced to nobody, climbing back onto her webbed feet.  She spread her \nwings out as if to take flight, but instead she...changed.  In an instant her \nstructure was far more humanoid, a slim and short robot with brilliant white \narmor, glints of black visible underneath at her joints, and across her \nmiddle.  Around her waist was a belt complete with a holster for what was \napparently her only offensive weapon, a strange streamlined gun.  One hand \nreached down and took ahold of it, pushing a small button on the side.  The \nweapon&#39;s charge meter slowly began filling up.\n    \n    The gun was drawn and she flexed her wings, still present though \nmodified.  A pair of boosters had been added in the transformation.  A simple \nhelmet with two crests at the top surrounded a pale face, with eternally \nazure eyes targeting the combatants in the distance.  The semi-loud roar of \nthe boosters on her wings echoed across the land and she took off, soaring \nrapidly toward the fighting.  \n\n    - The Mysterious Trumpeter Swan &#39;Bot ( :P )\n\n"}}
