Your weponry is fantastic and you seem \na capable and intelligent Major. Together I belive we would dominate the \nBeast Wars. Yet....I would understand your hesitation into a pact with anyone \nat the momnet. If i were you, I think people were trying to become friends \nwith me only to use your vessle.

No less.\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Demona looked to Inferno and pushed past him ::: Move insect, I need to \ntalk with the Commander.\n\n::: Demona walked up the open ramp into the main corridor and then made her \nway into the bridge which always seemed to be filled and busy with bots. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast watched the pink T-Rex walk around several consols and stand \nin front of him. And he had to admit she was incedibly irresistable. :::\n\n::: Demona ::: Terorize!\n\n::: She transformed into her small, yet sexy robt mode. ::: \n\n::: Demona bowed ::: Hello Commander Hell Beast.

Besides that, I dont fight, \never.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: What? You must have other skills!\n\n::: Demona ::: I rely on my witts. If that isnt good enough for you, mabey i \nshould be leading this group.\n\n::: Hell Beast snarled ::: Power hungry fembot!

Im going to get some quarters, \nand then I will talk with you. There will be alot of changes around here.\n\n::: She began to walk off and then turned to Black Aracnia and \nPheniox ::: Drop in later, we need to talk.
