Just\n&gt; like my old modem!)\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Aw, dang it!&quot; Quickstrike turned around and looked at the vent face. He\n&gt; walked up to the wall. He attempted to jump up into the vent, but he was\ntoo\n&gt; short to reach it. He tried two more times, but with no avail.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Beast mode.&quot; Quickstrike transformed to beast mode and climbed up the\nwall,\n&gt; into the air shaft. He crawled around inside it, and called, &quot;Dark Mouse.\n&gt; Dark Mouse? Where are ya rodent?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Megatron:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ah, a good logical bot.&quot; he said. He stood up. &quot;I belive it&#39;s time for us\n&gt; to return their glory. It doesn&#39;t make sense for fellow Predacons to fight\n&gt; amoung themselves while we can put out energies into fighting the Maximals\n&gt; and even the Alliance. A Predacon uses team work. What you need is an\n&gt; experienced leader like myself.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
