For all the hell she went through at the hands of \nthe Rogues, she is still innocent in many ways, and betrayal is an \nalien concept to her.  Knowing little about Hydras or Megatron, she \nis unaffected by Skulletron&#39;s arguement.  However, she knows she&#39;s in \na tight squeeze.\n\n&quot;Flicker ...&quot; she whispers so low even Wolfenstein would barely be \nable to hear her.  &quot;What would you do?&quot;  Somewhere in the back of her \nmind, a memory thought long deleted comes to the surface.  She sees \nonce again the horror of the Rogues&#39; attack on the defenseless \nconvent she had once called home.  She sees Flicker stand up to them, \ndespite being hopelessly overmatched.  In desperation, she had \nsurrendered herself to protect him and her people.  Now, it seems to \nher to be the only route open once again.  \n\n&quot;I ... I surrender ...&quot; she says aloud, her voice choked from more \nthan just the wolf-bot&#39;s arm.\n\nOOC: Do what you will, just don&#39;t try to kill her - she has a mutant \nspark that can&#39;t be destroyed.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Wolfenstein : : \n&gt; Wolf is shocked by his friends actions, but does see his point.

He has his gun \naimed at the nWo side, but slowly spins around, aiming at Wolfenstein \nand Pheonix.  He takes a step back. Skulletron:  Come on Wolf, join \nme!  You know it as well as I do, this is inevitable!  Can&#39;t you see \nthat Hydras has smeered the Predacon legacy and is just using us as \npawns?
