HINT HINT!  WINK WINK!)\n\nPresident Kaiser/Sequencer/Sinew/Imprisoner/Predator/Choran:\n\n\n\n\n\nKaiser sat in his luxurious office and was a little disgusted.  All the IGL \npresidents before him had been organics of some type because of prejudice, \nhence the office for the organics, with all the padded chairs and such.  The \noffice was so large it even had a small grassy prarie.  He&#39;d been President \nfor twelve years but still hadn&#39;t been able to remodel the office but no one \nwould let him.\n\nTyping on his computer terminal on his huge he read over five hundred \nmessages from sponsors, broadcasters, and investors, reading five hundred \nlengthy messages in under a minute.  A ring came from his terminal and he \npressed a few buttons and a link was instantly set up.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, Kaiser,&quot; a voice replied over the comm., &quot;we&#39;ve got those three Preds \nyou requested to see.  Don&#39;t really see why you&#39;d--&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up, Sinew, and just do it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;\n\nKaiser stood up from his seat and stretched his mechanical joints and then \nsat back down as the doors opened to his huge office.\n\nIn walked several armed humanoids with laser and ballistic rifles in red and \ngold uniforms, in the middle of them were the ten foot tall robot, Sequencer, \nand the perfect looking Sinew, his uniform consisting of more metal and pads \ninstead of just fabric like most of the other IGL security officers.\n\nSinew pushed forward the now completely unarmed bounty hunters, Imprisoner, \nPredator, an Choran.\n\n&quot;Nice set up you got here.&quot; Imprisoner said, seeing that obviously Kaiser was \nin charge around here.  &quot;Question is what do you want with us?&quot;\n\n&quot;First off, I am President Kaiser of the IGL, Intergalactic Gladiatorial \nLeague.  The League, or IGL as we prefer, is filled with combatants from all \nover the Universe.  Robots and organics alike--&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s the point?&quot; Predator asked as he interrupted.\n\nSinew sent an armored fist forward that hit the middle of Predator&#39;s back \nsending him collapsing forward to his knees, weapons pointed at Imprisoner \nand Choran, making them decide not to retaliate.\n\n&quot;My point, Predacons, is it helps unite the Universe and believe or not helps \nstops wars.  More than it starts anyway.  Warring species solve their \ndifferences in the arenas we have.  Much better for business and we make \ngreat profits.  We&#39;ve already bought several planets and moons and the IGL is \neven a government body.  And your sole purpose is to fill up slots in the \nIntergalactic Gladiatorial League Championship that will be taking on Past \nEarth very soon where we may recruit more slot fillers.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why would they fight?&quot; Choran asked.\n\n&quot;The rewards.  If one of you three manage to actually win, which is doubtful, \nyou could be rewarded.  Now get these worthless Cybertronians out of my \nsight.  They&#39;re the scourge of the galaxy.&quot;\n\n&quot;And what the slag are you?&quot;\n\nKaiser simply walked back to his office, not responding as the bounty hunters \nwere lead away back towards their cells many levels down through the \nginormous Otyebis.\n\nKaiser was thirteen and a half feet tall.  He was red and gold and was \ntoughly built looking like he could fight, and he could, being a former IGL \nchampion five years, which was got him his job as President despite his being \na robot.  He used to be a general in a robotic army of a robotic society from \na planet called Ketrad where they had murdered their organic masters.  They \nwere treated well, but they just despised them for some reason and made them \nextinct.\n\nHe activated his comm. to the Vice President of IGL, Suka.  &quot;Suka, report to \nmy office immediately.&quot; (THAT&#39;S YOU ZARDUS)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
