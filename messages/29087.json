I \nhad to go \n&gt; &gt;to this awards banquet for day school and changed my Internet \nprovider. The \n&gt; &gt;reason none of my characters have Bios is because for a while me \nand friend \n&gt; &gt;have be reading books on animation and studying it in my art \nclass. So I \n&gt; &gt;going to Try ((Try Being the key word)) to animate a 3 minute \nshort for my \n&gt; &gt;bios one for each characters. But to see if this works the way I \nwant I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt;going to try to do a general music video for the Neo Beast Wars. \nThis is \n&gt; &gt;long time taking process which means with day school, night \nschool, work, \n&gt; &gt;and mischief, the two of us will be working on this in our spare \ntime. But \n&gt; &gt;before I start I want to ask permission to animate and draw your \ncharacters \n&gt; &gt;for the general Music Video. The characters that get picked we \nwill be \n&gt; &gt;listed and we are picking by the Bios you posted on the Web site \nif your bio \n&gt; &gt;reads well enough to draw you then your character may get picked. \nIf you \n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t want to be drawn say so and you will not be picked. \nCharacters that \n&gt; &gt;are drawn will be drawn in a drawn by Gene in Transformers G1 \nstyle or with \n&gt; &gt;strong anime edge by me. Before I start if I make this and it is \ndecent will \n&gt; &gt;you add it to the page Yan?))\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;::The WildCats::\n&gt; &gt;All of the Wild C.A.T.S enter stealth mode and fall back to Cats \nLayer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;_____________________________________________________________________\n____\n&gt; &gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!

And \nthey are:\n&gt; \n&gt; Maximal Blossom\n&gt; gender:female\n&gt; alternate form:pink and white car \n&gt; Backround:She and Dinobot have known each other since they were \nkids and in the process fallen in love with other. They now have a \nson name Buddy.She&#39;s also good friends with Rinox,and Optimus. \n&gt; \n&gt; Maximal Butterfreak\n&gt; gender:female\n&gt; beast form:butterfly\n&gt; Backround:Dinobots &#39;sister&#39;. When Butterfreak was still a protoform \nher original spark faded &#39;cause of a mis-fired blast. Dinobot was the \nonly one on the scene,and so he willing gave half his spark to her. \nSo the two are in a way brother and sister because of the spark they \nnow share.   \n&gt; \n&gt; Maximal Buddy \n&gt; gender:male\n&gt; Alternate form(s):grey and white car and helicopter\n&gt; backround:the off spring of Blossom and Dinobot. Buddy wanted a bat \nbeast form but his father disagreed saying it would be too dagerous. \nBorn during the beast wars (first season near the end) Buddy wanted \nat first to grow up like any other normal kid but was stuck where he \nwas. After the beast wars had ended Buddy got the chance to know \nCybertron,unlike earth which he calls home.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at \nhttp://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
