Today was the day, 1 year ago, that i joined this RPG.  I had\nbeen doing \n&gt; searches all over the internet for RPGs, but none really caught my\neye until \n&gt; i saw the link- Neo Beast Wars RPG. I decided id like to check it\nout, and \n&gt; fell in love as soon as i read the story and looked at the\ncharacters.  I \n&gt; knew i must join immeadiately, so i used an old favorite character,\nTorca.  \n&gt; My profile was an immeadiate mode, and i was pretty stupid when i\nwas new.  I \n&gt; remember my first post like it was yesterday.  Torca burst into the\nPredacon \n&gt; base and put his gun up to Quickstrike and tried to eliminate his\nspark.  \n&gt; Talon got really pissed at me.  But soon i started to catch on, and\ncreated \n&gt; stronger characters and some good stories.  In my time here in the\nRPG, i saw \n&gt; many changes.  I&#39;ve seen ultra-powerful groups rise and fall,\nextremely \n&gt; talented RPers come and go(not to mention a lot of idiots), and\nbuilt \n&gt; firendships with members.  Id like to thank Soulstice for his\nfriendship and \n&gt; partnership, Zardus for putting up with me through my early times,\nand \n&gt; everyone else that ive had the pleasure(or displeasure) of RPing\nwith, and i \n&gt; hope my next year here will be even better.  Just wanted to get that\noff my \n&gt; chest.\n\n\n"}}
