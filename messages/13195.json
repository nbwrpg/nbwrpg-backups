Promise. & Sorry for the long post.\n\n* Iron Raptor watched Feline leave the room, a rather flustered sigh \nescaping from her throat.\nShe had thought that she wouldn�t be very comfortable once she explained why \nshe had called her here, knowing that the Alliance frightened her so badly. \nAnd now it almost seems as if she had made matters worse.\nIron Raptor sat up and leaned her elbows against her knees as she hears \nProwl and Hot Rod, looking at the floor with a tired look in her eyes.\nFeline was too upset to go on this mission now, just as she had feared. So, \nnow it was onto plan B.\nBut first, to answer both of these bot�s questions. *\n\n� Oh. Tavatron and Dinobot�s signatures both stopped in Grid 16 and I asked \nFeline if she would run a Search and Recover mission for me. To go and see \njust why both of them aren�t moving anymore, and if they�re damaged or in \nstasis lock to go and recover them. But she�s had some rough spots with the \nAlliance and Grid 16 is just too close to their base for comfort. So, she�s \nupset about it.�\n\n* Iron Raptor then the looked up at the ceiling for a moment before resting \nher head on her heads, looking at the holo-projections of the two missing \nMaximals. Wondering if Feline�s fear for Dinobot was part of it, or maybe \njust a fear of males in general.\nShe tilted her head to the side for a moment with another sigh.\nWell, by what Feline had told her about her experiences with the Alliance, \nshe couldn�t really blame her for her fears. But that cat-bot would have to \nlearn how to act around the male gender without jittering all the time, it \nwas something that would take her a bit of time to get over but eventually \nshe would�she had too.\nIron Raptor continued to look at the projections.*\n\n� So, I�ve finally decided that�I�m not going to send her out. She can stay \nhere and calm herself down while I go with a bot or two and see what�s up \nwith our missing Maximals.�\n\n* That was her plan B, but there was also a part that Feline was going to \nplay in it as well.\nShe wasn�t going to send her out and deal with the problems of bringing both \nof her Maximals back, but she had a feeling that at least one of them was \nextremely injured and needed immediate medical attention. And she could \nalmost bet her Second Beast Mode on that Dinobot was that one.\nBut that also meant that a CR chamber couldn�t heal him all the way, so he \nwould need excess attention outside before finally being placed in one. That \nwas where Feline came in.\nShe would treat him with the medical attention that he needed. But since her \nfear of males is the major thing to think about, she would make sure that \nDinobot would be offline for repairs before she let Feline near him.\nIron Raptor thought that it was a fairly good plan, but she would discuss it \nfurther with Prowl on her way to Grin16. A second opinion was always handy.\nShe opened her com-link to Feline with another of her sighs.*\n\n� Feline? About the recovery mission: Don�t worry about it. I�ve decided \nthat you can stay behind on this one, give you a chance to calm down a bit \nand gets use to the place a bit more. I�ll be going instead. But�I want you \nto be ready for when we get back, I have a few things for you to do. Does \nthat sound alright?�\n\n* Iron Raptor waited with her com-link open, ready to receive Felines \nreply.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
