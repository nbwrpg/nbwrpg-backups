I wouldn&#39;t want to take more of you rtime.  Energon\n&gt; is a precious thing, enough of your help I have taken, I wing.  Please, let\n&gt; me know, when Rodimus is up and ready to go.  At that point I will be ready\n&gt; tot alk, but until then I would rather think and walk.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; smiling politely over at them, the refugees whom he was not sure yet if he\n&gt; could trust or know much of yet, and not wnating to be aggressive unless\n&gt; necessary.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, if not interrupted, WHEELIE would be going out to the front of the\n&gt; temple, to sit upon the roof of it and wait for any sign of whatever was the\n&gt; cause of this heavy external jamming to cease.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was no interruption, WHEELIE was allowed to go perch himself on\ntop of the structure they had been inside of. It was relatively flat\nat the top, with stairs leading up to it. Had this been a truely\nreligious place, this might have been the area were sacrifices were\nmade to angry god&#39;s and were mortals feared to tread except at the\nbehest of the priests. However there was none of that, there was only\nstone and metal and the debris that had landed on it like leaves and\nsuch. It made for a nice place for WHEELIE to sit.\n\nTime passes . . .\n\nEventually the shape of ASTRA could be seen climbing up the stair, her\noptics glowing slightly as the sun above was begining to set. She\nstopped as she saw WHEELIE, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re up here. I would not want to\nintrude.&quot;\n\nShe turned as if to leave.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
