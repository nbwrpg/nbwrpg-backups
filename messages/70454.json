As compassionate as Prime, if it mea=\r\nnt that his life was in danger, he would protect a new comrade with his own=\r\n spark.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t do that Perceptor. I&#39;m not going to abandon you.  It&#39;s my=\r\n promise from the bottom of my spark and I will not break my promise my new=\r\n friend.  Take heart, Rat Trap is now able to bypass the computers manually=\r\n, which will allow you to enter the Ark safely until we can alter those sig=\r\nnatures of yours.&quot;\n\nHe stays by him no matter the price his body may pay in=\r\n the mean time.\n\nIn the Ark, Quickstride and Night Shift have the CR chambe=\r\nrs ready for use as they do last minute evaluations on the system.  With a =\r\nthumbs up from Night Shift, the CR Chambers are made ready to accept new pa=\r\ntients.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re good ta go in here, Lord Elder.&quot;\n\nRat Trap watches as Tucso=\r\nn remains with Perceptor.\n\n&quot; Good he&#39;s still in one piece.  Now that&#39;s what=\r\n I call one tough Autobot.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime now communicates to the Ark.\n\n&quot;Th=\r\nis is Tucson Prime to Lord Elder.  According to my signature readings, Rodi=\r\nmus Prime is in need of help, and a help maybe I can supply him.  From one =\r\nPrime to another, perhaps I can lend him my spark to give him the power he =\r\nneeds to recover quickly.&quot;\n\nRat Trap&#39;s jaw drops.\n\n&quot;If he does that there&#39;s=\r\n no telln&#39; if he&#39;ll survive such a proceedure.  Lord Elder, tell him he can=\r\n&#39;t do that!  That&#39;s like the ultimate saccrifice and there&#39;s a great chance=\r\n he&#39;ll die from it!&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor/Kup:\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup watched sadly the medic room and said to silve=\r\nrbolt &quot;I guess that i&#39;ll \n&gt; remain here to help&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ******************=\r\n***********\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor dryly said &quot;It seems that I have to leave you, T=\r\nucson.
