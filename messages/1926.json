He looks over at the \nscanner showing the three predacons and back at the visual. If it came to a \nfight, Nemesis and DeathStorm would be outnumbered two to three.\n\n&quot;Dark One,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;After you are repaired, please go to \nNemesis&#39; position in case he needs backup.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl smiles. &quot;I&#39;m glad you aproove, my lady,&quot; he says mockingly and then \nlooks down at the unconcious predacon at his feet.\n\n&quot;Lat&#39;s get him back to base,&quot; he says and picks Zenyak up over his shoulder, \ntaking the pred&#39;s gun in the proccess.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker looks at Zyber. &quot;Me and the predacon seem to ... disagree on several \ntopics. I think my presence is getting him quite mad. I&#39;ll make it back to my \nbase, don&#39;t worry. Thank you for saving my life.&quot; With that, he walks off \ntoward where his scanners have last identified the maximal base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDeathStorm nods. &quot;Assassinate is what I do.&quot;\n\nHe transforms into beast mode and flies off after Nemesis.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMosquitor runs out into the charred are of the forest where Set and Ra are. \nOpening fire, he is hit in the back by a bolt from Zeus.\n\nHe trips over Set&#39;s fallen form and flies into a tree. He gets up and flies \noff trying to find Hell Beast.\n\nZeus stops in the middle of the clearing and looks at Ra. &quot;You two all \nright?&quot; He asked, not noticing Ares.\n\n"}}
