But ther=\r\ne is more to these paintings.. A strange mysterious figure, with an aura ar=\r\nound it.. To me it seems evil. Another idol, someone else to worship. .. Pe=\r\nople portrayed in black and white.. White, meaning those who look to the Si=\r\nlver Dragon and black to those who worship the intimidating idol..

The creatures draw closer to him and sit beside him and Ta=\r\nlon. It was clear that the Silver Dragon was a source of comfort to these c=\r\nreatures, but that was about to change once he and Talon left for Cybertron=\r\n. It was a massive guilt slammed upon his heart. Yet how could he get the a=\r\nnimals to understand that he had to leave them in such a short time? He was=\r\n now their guardian and they were looking up to him for protection. &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Talon, these creatures remember the=\r\n old dragon that sought to their protection and realize that I have taken h=\r\nis place.

He watches attentively and at that moment, the c=\r\nreature lifts its head. It was another dragon. Yet this one was a bit small=\r\ner than he was, but the same coloration. He takes note of its slender shape=\r\n. It was female. She looks to him as he looks to her. She slowly approaches=\r\n him and they look gently to each other like brother and sister. In draconi=\r\nc vocalization, Tucson explains who he is and his dilemma. She intern rumbl=\r\nes back and bows her head. She nods as he does.

You ma=\r\ny not believe this, but you helped me to find my path, and you saw me on th=\r\ne right road and guided me to my true fate. Soon afterwards, I became a Pri=\r\nme, acquired seventeen more wheels, and almost looked like Optimus Prime, y=\r\net different. But one thing didn&#39;t change, I was still battling blindness o=\r\nff and on. Then, a third change, due to extensive damage to my previous for=\r\nm, which could not be repaired, I was guided to\n my final evolution, this o=\r\nne. All of these things wouldn&#39;t have come about if I had never met you. An=\r\nd I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Talon, I will miss this planet as much =\r\nas you are, and hopefully we can tell our offspring all about this planet a=\r\nnd it&#39;s wondrous varieties of life that live here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The rodent climbs down and drops a=\r\n nut into his hand, and chatters to him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; This is for us to keep?
