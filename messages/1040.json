Nobot messed with an \nassassin without some kind of reaction in store for them, and 9 out of 10 \nchances it wasn&#39;t going to be a pleasant one!*\n\n****************************************************************\n\n* Dinobot growled at Tavatron as she had walked away and towards the Ark, \nwhen she had looked at him the second time he knew that she had found \nsomething in him. Something...more.\nHe reached down and collected his rifle, at least it was undamaged...unlike \nhimself!\nDinobot sighed and soon caught up to Tavatron, he slapped her in the back \nwith his tail for her remark.\nHe growled deeply...*\n\n&quot; Indeed, that IS a promise...smart alec!&quot;\n\n* He then looked back towards the Maximals ship, it almost seemed to grow \nquiet now. The reason...he knew not.\nDinobot looked down at the rifle in his hands but then wrenched as a sharp \npain suddenly caught him by surprise, it seemed to be coming from the exact \nplace in which Scourge had kicked him!\nHe placed a clawed hand on his stomach, it was more tender then he had first \nthought. It almost seemed to start as a dull pain but then worked it&#39;s way \ninto a feeling of utter excitation, as much as he was damaged he never would \nhave guessed that it was this much!\nBut Dinobot wasn&#39;t one to cry out in pain at a mere glance, he could take \nit...for as long as he needed to!\nHe breathed in deeply but even that brought discomfort, he then began to \nslow his breathing to a shallow intake...his chest barely expanding as he \ntook in a little air at a time.\nDinobot flexed his free hand and shrugged that shoulder, he was stiff and \nsore...not to mention the lack of food and rest.\nHe snarled as the pain in his stomach first came to a tearful climax but \nthen sighed as it almost seemed to fade away into nothing but what it was \nbefore...a dull pain. He would have started repairs...if he hadn&#39;t spent \nmost of that energy repairing Tavatron...a small price to pay for the life \nof a fellow warrior.\nDinobot glanced over at her, she had seemed to made a full recovery. That \nwas good and it made this battle a little bit less hectic, just what an \nunder-powered warrior needed after a battle and a secondary repair.\nHe looked then at the Ark, but the battle was only a small thing...it was \nthe war itself that mattered.\nDinobot snarled and clenched his fist, the pain was back and with a \nvengeance...but that was not what mattered now. It was the survival of the \nMaximals and the survival of this planet that truly mattered!\nThis was just a small battle...one that only made up a piece of the great \nwar!*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
