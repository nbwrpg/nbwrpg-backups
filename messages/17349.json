Nothing very important had \nhappened while she had been gone, so there was no need to ask anyone what \nshe had to catch up on.\n\nDesmonus took in a deep breath and brushed herself off, stopping in the \nshadows of the hall and looking down at her sleek armor.\nShe twisted her torso a bit to get a look at the back of her thigh, \nwondering if it held any smudges or dirt that she had missed.\nThere was nothing, everything was clean.\n\nShe then ruffled her wings at her side for a moment, finally settling them \nagainst her shoulders to form a rather long cloak, the front claws acting as \na clasp.\nDesmonus then began to humm a rather complex tune, one which resembled the \nflowing melodise one would hear in a gothic quier.\nSmooth and ever flowing.\nShe walked slowly down the hall, yet her head was bowed and her amber eyes \nclosed, her body ever so slightly swaying to the ancient tune as she passed \ndoor after door.\n\nIt was a trick which she had learned many steller-cycles ago, a time that \nshe could no longer remember but knew existed.\nHer soft music was like a sonar, the sound waves bouncing off objects and \nthen back to her, relaying the shape, size, scent and even color of whatever \nit had hit.\nIt was rather clever, but second nature to a half bat fuzor like herself.\nWhile others might find it odd or even spectacular, she simply brushed it \noff as normal.\n\nDesmonus turned a corner silently and slipped into the shadows of an unlit \nhall passage, the darkness closing around her true feminin form and covering \nher like a warm blanket.\nAs she passed a high air vent opening she suddenly stopped, the tips of her \nwinge furrling around her ankles almost as if a wing had come up.\nHe had been here.\nThat was her first thought.\nDesmonus raised her head towards the opening, finally opening her eyes and \nlooking at the silver covering.\nHer past intended prey had been herehe could still smell him.\n\nThe sleek and supple fembot hissed ever so quietly, her amber eyes shining \nas they glared at the vent opening.\nIf only she had been here earlier, when this male bot had come inside the \nbase.\nIt would have been THEN that she would have caught him and feasted upon his \nappatizing mech-fluid.\nAnd it just so happened, the stronger the bot she fed upon, the more energy \nher body would have recieved.\nAnd by the scent of this male bot, she would have recieved an extreme amount \nof energy.\n\nDesmonus then lowered her gaze from the opening and her eyes she did close \nand then were lost in the shadows, breathing in deep the scent so she would \nnever forget it. Never forget just what power her prey held, and how she \ncould tap into it...and share it.\nHer lips curled in a smile that would have made the devel look twice, \nrunning her tongue over her teeth and feeling the poisonus tips of her two \nmain kaynines slightly pierce it.\nA prey with such energy was worth waiting for.*\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
