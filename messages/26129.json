Besides, I would rather have your \nreal thoughts and personality behind her then my own.)\n\n** Carnage gave a final heave and threw dirt back before she leaned back \nagainst her hind legs and looked at the work she had done, judging with \nnothing but bare eye that it was deep enough to keep the meat dry and fresh \nfor another 48 hours.\nShe looked up towards Teltoli as she heard the woman claim that she did want \nwhat she had asked for, moving stiffly and heaving one of the dead pigs into \nthe hole while she listened.\nSo, Teltoli wanted to become a soldier just to prove to people that she \nwasn&#39;t a child anymore? Well...that was the wrong reason.\nWhen you ask for something like she was there has to be more of a reason \nthen to prove something. The pain wasn&#39;t worth something so small.\nCarnage leaned over and heaved the second dead beast into the hole, then \nturning to the pile of dirt just behind her, judging the distance between \nthe hole and pile and then positioning herself so that the pile was behind \nher. So with her hind claws she began to throw the dirt between her legs and \ntowards the  hole. It wasn&#39;t long before the pigs were both covered and \nCarnage was over by the trunk where the hole had been, patting the soil so \nthat it became compact and no water would be able to get as far as her meals \nwere lying.\nShe sighed and sat back a bit, resting her weight on her hind legs. She had \nbeen thinking about what Teltoli had said the whole time she had been \nworking, and had finally decided on what she knew was the right answer.** &quot; \nNo. I won&#39;t teach you if all you want is a title for yourself.&quot; ** Carnage \nglanced up through the leaves of the tree and towards the sky, the rain \ncontinuing to fall. It really bothered her but if the ground werenï¿½t covered \nwith something where her meals were then they would be soaked. So she did \nthe best thing that she knew, she walked over to the fresh dirt and settled \nherself upon it like a hen on her nest. Shifting here and there until she \nwas comfortable.\nCarnage glanced at Teltoli and then motioned with her snout to a spot beside \nher, since she knew it was going to be a cold night...even for a fur covered \ncat with wings.\nAnything Teltoli wanted to know as why she wouldn&#39;t teach her was welcome to \nbe questioned, besides, Carnage had always liked determination.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
