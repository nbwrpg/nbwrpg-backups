Taking several of them could cause lots of \nproblems for the Trainers.\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; he agrees after a moment of hesitation, &quot;Let me go review \nwhatever recent comms the base has picked up from that area first, \nthough.&quot;\n\nHe turns and walks to a console, tapping a few buttons to bring up \nany intercepted comms.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ignatius looked Slayer square in the eye, &quot;There seems to be some \nbad mech\n&gt; fluid between you and the Maximals, it shouldn&#39;t be to hard to get \nthier\n&gt; attention.&quot; Ignatius activates his Recon map of the mountains \nshoeing a\n&gt; particular dropoff near a sharp turn. &quot;I can position myself here.&quot; \npoints\n&gt; to top of the dropoff. &quot;You lead one or two Maxi pads through \nhere.&quot;  points\n&gt; to lower portion of dropoff leading around corner. &quot;Our prey will \nbe trapped\n&gt; between us while we retain all the cover.&quot; The plan seemed simple \nenough\n&gt; with one exception, there was no way of knowing which Maximal would \nfollow\n&gt; them, or how many. If successful they could scavenge the parts from \nthe\n&gt; bots, or trade bodies for parts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignatius brought up the menu from the cargo hold. &quot;We can use these \nto\n&gt; confuse the scanners.&quot; He points out an item labled Mirror sensors. \nItems\n&gt; designed to reflect a bots image and energy signature making it \ndifficult to\n&gt; determine how many bots there were.\n\n\n"}}
