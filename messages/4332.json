Zardus blinks. That was strange.\n\n&quot;Umm, Zardus,&quot; his comm-link comes alive with DevilDuer&#39;s voice, &quot;I&#39;d just \nlike to say that Scattershot cracked. I&#39;m perfectly fine.&quot;\n\nZardus nods. &quot;Uh uh...&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;Both of you return to \nbase.&quot;\n\nWith that he reaches the bridge, seeing a stasis pod (Oinker) on the \nscanners. Zardus grins. How nice of the new bot to arrive, right when troops \nwere usefull.\n\nZardus flies out of the base, heading for Oinker&#39;s position.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer looks at Scattershot.\n\n&quot;You heard &#39;im. Let&#39;s get back to base and have your head checked.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAnnihilator spins around in his chair, the scanners reporting something. \n&quot;Shuko, the scanners are reporting that alot of the predacons have left their \nbase. I suggest we crush them now!&quot;\n\nKiller also turns in his chair. &quot;Yeah! We could crush those fools when they \nare out on buisness. Let&#39;s move now.&quot;\n\nAres and Zeus, who were passing through, turn to Shuko. &quot;Those two are \nright,&quot; Zeus says, &quot;Let&#39;s go kick their inferior skid plates.&quot;\n\n"}}
