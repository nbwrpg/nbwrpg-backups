He had managed to destroy the diplomatic \nescort the Maximals Refugees had sent to the Predacons. Now, he \nwould rule unhindered.\n\nVykos: Tell me, Warghoul, did we miss anyone?\n\nThe question was really: do I have to torture you once more?\n\nWarghoul shuddered. He was deeply afraid of Lord Vykos, yet he hated \nhim at the same time.\n\nWarghoul: Barely, my Lord. I have picked up only one escape pod. \nHere is its flight path.\n\nLord Vykos studied the chart for a moment. He suspected the planet \nto bear a Transformer population because it went there at all. Pods \nnever go where they cannot be picked up.\n\nVykos: You have done well this time. Power up the engines. We will \npursue him. Scan the planet as soon as you are in range.\n\nThe small but well armed ship took some speed and got closer when...\n\nWarghoul: My Lord! I have picked up Megatron&#39;s Energy signature!\n\nVykos: What?! Megatron?!? He is on that planet?\n\nWarghoul: He seems to have fused with someone else, but I am \npositive on the results. He is there.\n\nLord Vykos thought for a moment then chuckled cruelly. He flicked a \ncommunication channel open.\n\nVykos: This is Lord Vykos of the Predacons. Megatron, or whoever you \nmight be, contact me now.\n\nHe signaled Warghoul to cut the chase off and to wait.\n\n\n"}}
