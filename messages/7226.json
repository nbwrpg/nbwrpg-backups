He didn&#39;t like loosing\n&gt; &gt;his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temper at base, and the only ones there to yell at were the females.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He saw a rather large rock formation in the distance.

He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; zoomed in on it with his optics and found out that it was a cave. It\nhad\n&gt; &gt;a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pointed top and a rather open area around the front.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He nodded his head to Stingtra. &quot;Wanna go check that out?
