She \nran over to the nearest console and began pulling up blueprints of the Ark. \nIt would take a few minutes in order to establish a satellite link with the \nArk in order to view recent damage, but it was doable.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
