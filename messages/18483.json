We will all turn our cloaks off, and\n&gt; &gt; distract the Maximals by drawing them outside for a battle.\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, you will still have your cloak on, and will enter the\n&gt; base\n&gt; &gt; through a large panel that is missing on the other side of the ship\n&gt; &gt; because of previous battles. When you find Spears, slap this cloak\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; her and run back to base. We&#39;ll keep the battle up until you are at\n&gt; &gt; the base. Put Spears in a holding cell until I get there, and if\n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; wakes tell her the Maximals did something evil to her and we must\n&gt; fix\n&gt; &gt; it. Everyone understand? Good.
