His body relaxes, laying still.\n\nKluster instantly kneels next to him, rolling him over on his back. \nHe sighs, seeing the damage to the bot&#39;s chest.\n\n&quot;Why didn&#39;t you get some help, Proto?&quot; He mutters to the dead bot, \nlifting him on his shoulder. He looks at Firearm, who had turned to \nlook at Proto.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s gone,&quot; Kluster says, Firearm nodding sadly and both of them \nwalking off toward the CF again, obvioustly saddened by the loss of \ntheir teammate.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;FIRE FOX&quot; &lt;firefox_y2k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hysteria:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria clambered through the long vent. Her face was covered with \nsoot and \n&gt; grease. She had slowly been making her way through the CF for the \npast ten \n&gt; minutes, doing her best to reconnect what was left of certain \nwires. She \n&gt; stopped crawling for a few moments while she answered IR&#39;s comm. \nHer \n&gt; breathing was slightly labored:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ve been trying for the past ten minutes commander. Give me a few \nmore \n&gt; minutes, and I should have the problem fixed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria then opened a comm to Kluster:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;First I have to disengage the lockdown, then I&#39;ll do my best to \nreroute \n&gt; power, but no promises. Hysteria out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She clambered through the remaining stretch of vent and dropped \ninto the \n&gt; damaged bridge:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Just one more...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria slid under the smaller, still active console and \nreconnected two \n&gt; frayed wire ends:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;OUCH!&quot; Hysteria pulled back and smacked her head against the \nunderside of \n&gt; the console. The wires had sparked her, and it hurt. She opened a \ncomm to IR \n&gt; and Kluster:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to attempt to disengage the lockdown, wish me luck.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria tapped out a few codes and passwords on the small console. \nOutside \n&gt; the extra layers of steel slide back, exposing the regular doors. \nThe \n&gt; lockdown had been disengaged. A few seconds later Hysteria tapped \nout \n&gt; several more commands, and succesfully rerouted some power to the \nCRs. She \n&gt; opened a comm to Kluster:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Reroute complete. There&#39;s some power, not much, but it should be \nenough.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria closed the comm and watched as the lights in the CF&#39;s \nbridge \n&gt; blinked on and off several times:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I hope.&quot;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
