Now, any information?&quot;\n&gt; Iris:&quot; Well, as you already know, the Predacon&#39;s have split up into two\n&gt; gropes, right? There are a few energy signatures at the Predacon base but\n&gt; two have just began to leave it. And there are a few more to the north,\nthey\n&gt; were travailing at 80 mph but now have slowed down considerably. Anything\n&gt; else you would like to know?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Iron Raptor smiled, the system that she had been given by her creators\nwas\n&gt; working like a charm! She then noticed Plintissa looking over her shoulder\n&gt; but turned back to the star.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No, that was all I needed to know. Thanx.&quot;\n&gt; Iris: &quot; Now, about that upgrade?&quot;\n&gt; *Iron Raptor sighed and shook her head.*\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;ll see what I can scrounge up, Iris. I can&#39;t make any promises, you\n&gt; know that.&quot;\n&gt; Iris: *sigh*&quot; Yeah! I know. Well, I guess that you&#39;ll be deactivating me\n&gt; now, huh?&quot;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor nodded*\n&gt; &quot; Afraid so. See you later then.&quot;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor disconnected her hand from the impute, took the cord from\nthe\n&gt; computer screen and placed back in her wrist, the shades then slid back\ninto\n&gt; her brow and she turned to Plintissa.The star on the screen now gone.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I was checking on the details of what Tigerhawk had told me about the\n&gt; Predacons, now I know more about their locations.
