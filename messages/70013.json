The same kind of courage embraced by Tucson Prime, sticks firmly=\r\n to Night Shift who continues to dodge the fire thrown at him.  This was it=\r\n, he wasn&#39;t going to run scared anymore.  Instead, he was going to use his =\r\nquick thinking, agility and skill to the best of his abilities and he was g=\r\noing to fight back.  Several compartments on his right gauntlett now reveal=\r\n a string of tazer like shirukens which when come in contact with metal, de=\r\nliver a nasty sting.  He says not one word, dodging, ducking, crouching and=\r\n finally tossing a couple of shirukens which sail quickly toward his assail=\r\nents with dead accuracy!  They weren&#39;t enough to immobilize but they were e=\r\nnough to cause some pain.\n\n&quot; Well, I&#39;m stuck here so I might as well make y=\r\nour lives more miserable while I&#39;m down here.  Trust me, I&#39;m really good at=\r\n it too!&quot;\n\nOne thing that DID separate him from Tucson, was his ability to =\r\nbe a wize aft.  He transforms back into SUV mode, and dumps a good amount o=\r\nf oil on the floor, just to make things a bit slick for his enemies.\n\n&quot; HAV=\r\nE A NICE TRIP PUNKS!&quot;\n\nOutside, Tucson Prime grows more annoyed at Cyclonus=\r\n&#39;s voice.  He wasn&#39;t there to give up, he was there to take back something =\r\nthat was stolen from the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.  A power he had no r=\r\night to command, a power he had no right to steal.  But yelling back wouldn=\r\n&#39;t do him any favors.  Rat Trap and Quickstride look to him.\n\n&quot;What now Whe=\r\nels?&quot;\n\nTucson Prime looks to his comrades.\n\n&quot; I - have a feeling it&#39;s somet=\r\nhing a little more spiritual than just yelling his name..&quot;\n\nHe then replies=\r\n to Kup.\n\n&quot;Kup, I need you here at the Black Fortress.  Bring plenty of sta=\r\nsis cuffs with you, you&#39;ll need them.  Shell program or no shell program, w=\r\ne&#39;re taking Rodimus, Nightlight and Windlord back with us.  As soon as we c=\r\napture them, I&#39;ll need you and Lord Elder to get them to Kenzo at the old M=\r\naximal base.  Something tells me that the answers we seek, lies within our =\r\nown confines.  I don&#39;t know why, but it&#39;s just a feeling I have.&quot;\n\nHe then =\r\ncloses his eyes, to delve deeper into the power of the Matrix which he hold=\r\ns within him.\n\n&quot; Primus, give me the strength to take back what has been wr=\r\nongfully taken from us.  A power which Cyclonus had no right to steal. A po=\r\nwer that is earned and not taken.  He has betrayed you Primus, he has betra=\r\nyed the one commandment that all Autobot kind has abided by for centuries. =\r\n I am here to redeem what has been wrongfully stolen from Rodimus Prime.  P=\r\nlease, grant me the power to accomplish my plight.&quot;\n\nRat Trap and Quick Str=\r\nide watch with slight confusion.\n\n&quot; Huh? I thought he was gonna really ratt=\r\nle the parameter.  What&#39;s he waitn&#39; for?&quot;\n\nQuickstride also looks on with c=\r\nonfusion.\n\n&quot;Ummm, you&#39;re askn&#39; the wrong Maximal. But I bet Lord Elder woul=\r\nd know why.&quot;\n\nTucson remains in a trance like state, attempting to connect =\r\nwith the power within his body.\n\nRat Trap quickly transmits the events to L=\r\nord Elder via video link.\n\n&quot;Lord Elder, we&#39;re here, but we dunno what&#39;s go&#39;=\r\nn down with Tucson Prime.  Cyclonus asked &#39;em a question and I thought for =\r\nsure he was gonna go after him with a vengeance.  But he didn&#39;t.  He&#39;s righ=\r\nt here, in some sorta trance like state.  Hope those creepoids didn&#39;t get i=\r\nnside his directory. Quickstride, how is he?&quot;\n\nQuickstride shrugs.\n\n&quot; Nothn=\r\n&#39; yet Rat Trap, he&#39;s in deep thought.  Sir, we dunno what ta make of this, =\r\nwe never saw anything like this before.  Got any idea what&#39;s going on?&quot;\n\nTh=\r\ney look to the video com link device on Rat Trap&#39;s arm as they wait for an =\r\nanswer.\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: CYCLONUS, DARK RODIMUS\n&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Securit=\r\ny\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus looked over at Cyclonus, his crimson optics glittering coldl=\r\ny\n&gt; as he observed the ex-minion, his gaze difficult to read.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus&#39;=\r\n frame was tall and straight, and although he had once been\n&gt; redesigned as=\r\n a Prime, there was still something about his build that\n&gt; was still lean, =\r\nas if built for endurance and speed. His armor, even\n&gt; in the bright lights=\r\n of the security chamber, still somehow maintained\n&gt; it&#39;s stark black on gr=\r\nay motif, stylized flames dancing across his\n&gt; chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; He glanced over =\r\nat one of the screens, the one that was displaying the\n&gt; activity outside w=\r\nith Tuscon and the other Autobot rabble standing\n&gt; there as if expecting th=\r\nem to open the base up and let them in.\n&gt; Rodimus chuckled softly for a mom=\r\nent, earning him a brief glance from\n&gt; Cyclonus. Rodimus was about to say s=\r\nomething when Hydras&#39; voice cut in\n&gt; . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;We are under attack!!!!!=\r\n We must to capture Nightshift, pronto!!!! Scourge and Cyclonus active the =\r\ninner and exterior defenses... If the Autobot leaves the base we will be fo=\r\nrced to go to a fight&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus tilted his head curiously as he, and R=\r\nodimus for that matter,\n&gt; looked at the screen that displayed the screen in=\r\n the throne room and\n&gt; the mayhem that was going on.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sir!?&quot; Cyclonus =\r\nsent to Hydras, &quot;The base has been submerged\n&gt; underneath the magma and I a=\r\nm activating the interior defenses.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as Cyclonus talked, a privat=\r\ne message came to Rodimus from Hydras . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;cover the reseach lab, =\r\nif the autobot ran towards it, intercept him&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus acknowledged Hyd=\r\nras&#39; message as he glanced up at Cyclonus. He\n&gt; hadn&#39;t appeared to notice t=\r\nhe message that Hydras sent. &quot;I have some\n&gt; things to attend to.&quot; Rodimus s=\r\naid, his voice calm and yet still that\n&gt; undercurrent of aggression was sti=\r\nll in it. &quot;I&#39;ll be back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Without another word Rodimus left the room, =\r\non his way to the research\n&gt; lab . . . and Nightlight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus nodded=\r\n as Rodimus left and then turned back to his consoles\n&gt; and screens, anothe=\r\nr lit up beside him as he activated it, this one\n&gt; watching Rodimus. Cyclon=\r\nus had indeed been aware of the communication\n&gt; Rodimus had received, and h=\r\ne watched his progress with keen interest,\n&gt; even as he kept an optic on th=\r\ne other events.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
