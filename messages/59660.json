No, I want to fight. I can \nfight. \n&gt; &gt; Sure I may not have nearly enough hours on the field in combat, \n&gt; but I \n&gt; &gt; have the programs to fight and defend myself. Besides, I am a \nfull \n&gt; &gt; dragon. We are a rare type of transformer. I know the original \n&gt; &gt; builders didn&#39;t want dragons because they were an anomily.  We \nare \n&gt; &gt; capable of flying, have fire breathing capabilities, can out \n&gt; manouver \n&gt; &gt; most plains and similar types, and we can also endure more damage \n&gt; &gt; because of our special metal skins.  I can fight. I just need \n&gt; &gt; training.&quot;  Her skin was still shimmering from the drink she had \n&gt; &gt; finished. &quot;Besides, most dragons are made of not only transmetal, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; trimetal.
