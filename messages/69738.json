Ah, doesn&#39;t have to happen that way of course.. \n\nBI=\r\nC: \n\nHearing Kup&#39;s voice was comforting to Tucson It had been a long time s=\r\nince he heard the old Autobot speak.  He smiles while replying to him.\n\n&quot;Ac=\r\ntually Kup, I think I like your idea better.  By the way, it&#39;s great to hea=\r\nr from you again.  I&#39;ll be there as soon as I can manage it.&quot;\n\nRat Trap and=\r\n Quickstride prepare to exit the shuttle, as they get into beast modes.  Ra=\r\nt Trap leaps up onto Quickstride&#39;s back and grabs his mane.  The stallion s=\r\nnorts a few times as dust gets into his nostrills.\n\n&quot;Gazoontite.  Anyway, y=\r\nou can count on us Lord Elder.  We promise, we&#39;ll watch our backs every ste=\r\np of the way.&quot;\n\nQuickstride shakes his head after sneezing.\n\n&quot; We won&#39;t do =\r\nanything you wouldn&#39;t do, Sir.  We&#39;ll have to move fast though, Lord Perseu=\r\ns probably needs us ASAP.&quot;\n\nRat Trap opens the hatch door while on Quickstr=\r\nide&#39;s back.\n\n&quot;Wish us luck guys.  We&#39;re gonna need it.&quot;\n\nQuickstride canter=\r\ns off the ramp and onto open land.  His hooves kick up clouds of dust behin=\r\nd him.  His canter soon evolves into a full blown gallop.  The sound of hoo=\r\nf beats carries through the air as it fades into the distance the farther h=\r\ne gallops.\n\nTucson turns to Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; I think we should leave the shut=\r\ntle where it is and head toward the Ark on wheels.  We can cover more groun=\r\nd that way.  Plus, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve done any form of off road d=\r\nriving and if we keep off the main roadways, no one will ever suspect that =\r\nwe&#39;ve gone back to the Ark instead of taking the bait.&quot;  \n\nHe transforms in=\r\nto his SUV mode and opens his door to Lord Elder.\n\n&quot;So who wants shotgun?&quot;\n=\r\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; With a steady hand and the help of Tuscon, Lord Elder brought the\n&gt; s=\r\nhuttle down to a relatively safe landing. There was only the\n&gt; slightest ja=\r\nrring bump as they touched ground. Shutting down power to\n&gt; the engines Lor=\r\nd Elder turned to look at the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Quickstride and Rat Trap.&quot; he s=\r\naid gravely, &quot;Report to Lord Perseus\n&gt; at the old base, either he or Legacy=\r\n should be able to fill you in on\n&gt; the situation there.&quot; Elder glanced at =\r\nthe computer screen which still\n&gt; showed a minion flying above the old base=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Be very careful. Minions are not Autobots and are more than\n&gt; Decep=\r\nticons or Predacons, and are not to be underestimated.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder looked a=\r\nt Tuscon although he was still talking to Quickstride\n&gt; and Rat Trap, &quot;Reme=\r\nmber the war we just fought a short while ago to\n&gt; protect the Ark from fro=\r\nm the Minion&#39;s attack? At that time Cyclonus\n&gt; was a hearld of Unicron hims=\r\nelf. With the power Unicron was giving him\n&gt; he was able to defeat Rodimus =\r\nPrime.&quot; Elder frowned, &quot;We think it was\n&gt; that defeat that allowed Hydras t=\r\no capture Rodimus and turn him into\n&gt; what he is now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning to look=\r\n at the screen and then at Rat Trap and Quickstride\n&gt; Elder continued, &quot;If =\r\nthis Minion is willing to take on the entire base\n&gt; by himself, he may be t=\r\nhat powerful as well, or even more so.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder turned to look at Tuscon=\r\n once again, &quot;As for mucking around with\n&gt; Predacon shell programs, hmmmm.&quot;=\r\n he said thoughtfully. &quot;We have not\n&gt; had that much success with reversing =\r\nthem.&quot; Elder tapped his finger\n&gt; idly on the console, &quot;Remember when Optimu=\r\ns Primal first crashed here\n&gt; on old Earth? Megatron had been able to beat =\r\nus to some of the Maximal\n&gt; pods, and use his shell program to turn them in=\r\nto Predacons.&quot; Elder\n&gt; sighed, &quot;Some of them are still on his side today.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible, I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;s going to be=\r\n\n&gt; difficult.&quot; Elder said as he looked around at everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n(OOC: I am not sure what Tuscon and Rat Trap were trying to do, when\n&gt; they=\r\n were attempting to &#39;tap into Rodimus via Predacon code&#39;??)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; =\r\n(Lord Elder)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
