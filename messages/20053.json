Anyone in the \nbase \n&gt; brace yourselves, anyone not at base, contact the base for new \n&gt; coordinates.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He taps a few buttons, issuing a seperation command. Blast doors \nshut \n&gt; in various places of the Alliance base as panels split up, the base \n&gt; beginning to seperate. A few seconds later, the base was laying in \n&gt; five pieces in the clearing. The left one was the residential area, \n&gt; the right one the labs and CR room, back one was the cargo holds \nand \n&gt; weapon rooms, and the front one was the bridge, training room, and \n&gt; other such facilities. In the middle sections were the power \nsupply, \n&gt; shields generators, and the anti-gravity devices which had \nmobolized \n&gt; the Alliance base in the past (before the anti moble base rule). \n&gt; Since the base was disconnected from the power supply, it had no \n&gt; power, an all the facilities were shut off, except for the ones in \n&gt; the power supply section.\n&gt; \n&gt; The four IF shuttles fly toward the sections of the base, the one \non \n&gt; the clearing also flying up to help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus smiles, taching each shuttle hatch on to a section of the \n&gt; Alliance base. His comm-link was flshing with Kluster&#39;s message, \nbut \n&gt; he was too busy to notice.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer swears as the base shakes, watching the CR chambers and \n&gt; other devices shut down.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re movin&#39;,&quot; he says to Diamond after he recieves Zardus&#39; \n&gt; transmission, &quot;Better brace yerself.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He could feel the base lifting into the air, causing him to stumble \n&gt; sideways to regain his balance.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Bloodystrike and Reptilica jump back as the door of the Alliance \nbase \n&gt; shuts, both of them falling as the base shakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Bloodystrike swears, sliding down the hallway as the section they \n&gt; were in was lifted into the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;RYO D&quot; &lt;striderzero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I sent it twice because if the first one just now arrived \nand \n&gt; I sent it \n&gt; &gt; friday. Also something has come up I have to take care of in \nperson \n&gt; so this \n&gt; &gt; battle is put in 5 place in my to do list sorry. I&#39;ll explain \nwhen \n&gt; I have \n&gt; &gt; more time. If I don&#39;t counter attack or post in 3 days call it a \n&gt; draw and \n&gt; &gt; continue without me. Even though I still will come for Zardus \nfate \n&gt; in the \n&gt; &gt; real world opposes me right now. Also if that is the limits of \nthe \n&gt; Alliances \n&gt; &gt; Power we are not impressed people have rated them as higher that \n&gt; what they \n&gt; &gt; are or I was led to expect to much.\n\n\n"}}
