Thinking of how a scream could alert any bot�s within the base he then look it out and looked it over, making sure that it was at full functioning order.\nSure that there was no way that that it could malfunction he then turned his attention towards Prowl, sure that he would then have to move just after he took out Nemesis Enforcer.\nWhile looking towards Prowl he couldn�t help but look towards Tavatron, still thinking that it was a crime for such a bot like her to be restrained like some captive creature? It wasn�t�honorable for a warrior to be in such a position.\nHe even wondered if she knew that he was there, right beside her and seconds away from freeing her from her captivity.\nBut then he looked back towards Prowl as he then silenced Nemesis and quickly took him down, freeing the Third in Command.\nWith no second thoughts it was then his turn to act, knowing that if he failed they would all be in deep slag.\nDinobot wasted no time as he then moved and swung his arm around Dark One�s neck, the silencer in the arms hand, aiming to plant the silencer to cover his mouth just as his arm tightened around his neck and began to cut off his breath.\nHis other hand striking towards his spinal circuitry in the middle of his back, his out-stretched claw ready to stab into that circuitry and then jerk upwards. It would not only knock Dark One out completely but also ensure that he was paralyzed if he woke up as they were escaping. It would easily be cured with a few mega-cycles in a CR chamber�but they would be long gone by then.\n While he was pulling off this very action, with his tail he then flicked off the switch that operated the restraints in which held Tavatron captive. Thus deactivating them to ensure her escape.\nDinobot had put enough force into his blow towards Dark One�s back that his claw would go right through him, causing the pain he knew that the Alliance bot deserved but then knocking him out before he had any chance of feeling more.\nBut he was satisfied that he had the chance to slag a bot before they had to leave, but knowing that attacking from behind wasn�t much to be proud of.\nHowever, pride was not the situation, the main goal was to get Tavatron out of there and back to the new Maximal ship.\nRepairs and rest was what was in store for her if this all went smoothly, something that she probably looked forward to after all the things she must have went through. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
