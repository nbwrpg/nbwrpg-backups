He coul=\r\nd now see that perhaps his plan was not working, yet he knew that his leade=\r\nr was not upset in fact more concerned for his saftey more than anything el=\r\nse.  It wasn&#39;t going according to plan and he knew it as well as Tucson did=\r\n.  He had underestimated his enemies and it was begining to bleed through. =\r\n The best thing now was to tell the truth, and put up a good fight.  He nar=\r\nrows his eyes.\n\n&quot; Ya want the truth huh?  Okay, I&#39;ll give ya the truth.&quot;\n\nH=\r\ne puts up his shoulder which has the Decepticon emblem and changes it immed=\r\niately to the Autobot symbol in front of Hydras.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s your truth!  You=\r\n&#39;re right, I ain&#39;t a baddy after all, that&#39;s just a little trick I like ta =\r\nplay on creeps like you!  I can&#39;t fly because like Tucson Prime, I&#39;M AN AUT=\r\nOBOT and will always be AN AUTOBOT!  That little game was ta trick ya but I=\r\n can see you&#39;re too smart for that.  Well, now that ya know the truth, go a=\r\nhead, try&#39;n blow me up lizard lips, because as soon as you do that, Tucson =\r\nPrime&#39;s gonna be pretty slagged off and with a pair of missile launchers on=\r\n his cab I doubt you&#39;ll wanna mess with &#39;em now.&quot;  \n\nAs like Tucson Prime, =\r\nNight Shift puts his bravest foot and tire forward.  He wasn&#39;t scared, he k=\r\nnew what would happen after mouthing off to Hydras, but he was proud of it.=\r\n  Proud to stick up for himself and his fellow Autobots no matter the cost.=\r\n\n\n&quot; This time, I ain&#39;t lyn&#39;!
