She nodded to Starstorm.\n &quot;Hello. I am KitKat. Newly joined to the ranks.&quot;\nShe noticed the femme bot look at her with a touch of distaste. She \ndidn&#39;t care. She wasn&#39;t here to find a mate. She was out to fight \nfor the faction she was now apart of.  She didn&#39;t care if this femme \ndidn&#39;t like her.  She only cared that this bot would show her the \nrespect she deserved.  She had killed many bots in her time. And \nhaving one less bot on the planet didn&#39;t bother her.  Even if it was \none of her own.  For now, she would watch and learn about this new \ngroup. Besides, she didn&#39;t think this bot mattered much in the \nleading ranks. She was only concerned with how Hydrus saw her. She \nwanted to lead. Not play games with bots who had soft sparks. She \nturned and noticed another bot looking at her with google optics.  \nShe shook her head. What has happened to the predacon empire since \nher last battle?  She felt her spark fall slightly. then her spark \nlifted. It occured to her that it would not be hard to gain power in \nthe ranks if the others were all that softed sparked. \nShe put her hand on her hip and swished her wolf tail. She looked up \nat Perceptor,\n&quot;Perhaps if it&#39;s not to much trouble, I would like to see the prints \nfor this base. If I am to be effective here, I must first now my own \nground. A wolf knows thier own backyard better than anyone. If ths \nis to be my new base of operations, I would like to be familiar with \nthe layout of my new home.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt;&quot; \n&lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perceptor/Starstorm:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What is he watcing of that femme?, I&#39;m most beauty&quot;thought \n&gt; Starstorm, and said &quot;Who&#39;s that femme, Preceptor?
