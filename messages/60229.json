He heard a commotion near his \n&gt; apartment he, Megatronics, and their adoptive sister, Organics \n&gt; shared.  Several bots were gathered around the door, watching \n&gt; Megatronics stand over Organics.  Not menacing her, protecting \nher.  \n&gt; His brother was struggling with an appearently drunk, tenticuled, \n&gt; robot of unknown origin.  Neutronics pushed the gatering at the \ndoor \n&gt; aside and rushed the attacker.  He was knocked to the ground, but \n&gt; megatronics was able to knock the attacker away.  The mystery bot \n&gt; escaped through the window and into the night.  Megatronics helped \n&gt; his brother to his feet.  They pull Organics up and Neutronics shut \n&gt; the door and rushed to his sister&#39;s side.  As he held her hand to \n&gt; reassure, his hand passed through her&#39;s, and the room grew black, \n&gt; Neutronics looked around, and instead of his protective older \n&gt; brother, the mighty Megatron stood rusting and laughing.  \nNeutronics \n&gt; covered his audio\n&gt; &gt;  recepters, until Megatron opened fire on them both.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Malice jolted awake, dropping the alarm clock in his hand.  \n&gt; Instantly, a monofiliment wire shot from his wrist.  it bounced off \n&gt; his index finger, pierced the clock housing, bounced off the \n&gt; insides, and exited to stick in the wall.  The clock slide down the \n&gt; wire, till it rested on the floor.  He retracted the wire and \nlooked \n&gt; around.  He saw Wolfblade was awake.  He picked Camoflage up \ngently, \n&gt; rested her in his lap, and swung his legs over the edge of the \ncargo \n&gt; net to face Wolfblade.\n&gt; &gt; :Good afternoon, I think.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She purred slightly as Malice stroked her head and nuzzled even \n&gt; &gt; closer to him.  Her mind was dreaming of past times. In her \nsleep, \n&gt; &gt; she muttered, &quot; No, I don&#39;t want to go mommy. I can fight. I \nwon&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; get rust sickness. Honest, I can stay, please let me stay \nmommy.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; She whimpered a bit and calmed down. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; &gt; She moved and rolled onto her back to see what had scratched her. \n&gt; It \n&gt; &gt; was Elita. She gently put her arm around the little sleeping bot \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; sighed. SHe very gently stroked Elita&#39;s head and shoulders and \n&gt; &gt; wondered how long the little bot had been there.  She thought to \n&gt; &gt; herself, Why do kids come around bots who have little to no \n&gt; &gt; experience with kids? I wonder if they do it on purpose just to \n&gt; raise \n&gt; &gt; a bot&#39;s oil pressure.\n&gt; &gt; She turned her head to see that Malice had a little one sleeping \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; his side as well.  She wondered why the kids came to his room to \n&gt; &gt; sleep. THen something else occured to her. If kids could sneek in \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; this place, how easy would it be for an enemiy to sneek in and \n&gt; kill \n&gt; &gt; them. Especially when they were sleeping. This thought disturbed \n&gt; her \n&gt; &gt; enough to not let her fall back to sleep. She would wait for the \n&gt; kids \n&gt; &gt; to wake up, then address the matter with Malice. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;In the name of God, I banish these souls of the evil undead into \n&gt; damnation.  May God have mercy, for I have none.  In Jesus&#39; Holy \n&gt; Name, Amen.&quot; -Rawl, Hellsing-RPG\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
