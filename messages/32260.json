This time it had enough fuel to probably last\n&gt; the battle. On his way here, he had discovered that flying rather\n&gt; agreed with him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You know who to kill,&quot; he says to his troops behind him, quickly\n&gt; picking out a target. His EMP rifle fires four shots at Shockwave. Two\n&gt; optic blasts and two signature seeking missiles follow afterward, at\n&gt; the same target.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; EndBringer roars, running forward. His shoulder mounted missile\n&gt; launchers aim at Vehement, each one firing two missiles.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Demise charges past EndBringer, seeing Flesh Ripper. He also roars,\n&gt; charging the bot with amazing speed.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Incarcinator looks down at the battle below. He was very high in the\n&gt; air. Taking out his large gun, he aims down at Unitron. He pulls the\n&gt; trigger twice, sending two explosive shells down at Unitron.\n&gt; \n&gt; The speed of the shells caused them to burn slightly while going down\n&gt; toward Unitron. The gun was designed to fire extrodinary fast bullets.\n&gt; The last time Incarcinator had shot this gun, the shell had gone\n&gt; through a Maximal shuttle and destroyed it.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scyther approaches the battle, cloaked. He activates his scanners,\n&gt; wanting to detect any cloaked bots, if there were any here.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Greven watches his teammates rush into battle and follows, taking out\n&gt; both his missile launcher. He fires three missiles at Rampage, all of\n&gt; them heat seeking.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
