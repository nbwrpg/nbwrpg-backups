She laid it on the \ncounter and put Akura in front of the fruit.\n&quot;OK Twister, you slowly pull the string and we&#39;ll see if Akura \nfollows it through the tube.  He&#39;ll fit though the tube alright.  \nHope this works.&quot;  She crossed her fingers.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@p...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Twister: Hmm....Maybe first to pull ropes and wires through \ntunnles.
