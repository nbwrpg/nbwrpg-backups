His bright eyes went wide. He bolted to the side, trying to get\naway\n&gt; from it, but it blew up before he could get his distance. He was thrown to\na\n&gt; tree, slamming his head and shoulder into the body of it. He went\n&gt; unconcious, slipping to the ground.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Life&#39;s too short to send boring email.
