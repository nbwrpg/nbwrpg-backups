The bot he \nliked \n&gt; had pledged to another. He had come to late. He shouted out loud to \n&gt; himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Even if KitKat won&#39;t love me, We can still be friends. And those \n&gt; Maximals hurt her. And they will pay. They will pay!!!!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Just than Starscream noticed that Goldeneye was close to him. A \nlook \n&gt; of shock and panic came over his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Uh...sorry about that. You&#39;ll forget what you heard, right?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (I start school tomorrow. I may put one last post up tonight, I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; know. I have a 12:19 Eastern Time lunch, so I may post than. If I \n&gt; don&#39;t, than I will definitly post around 3, 3:30 ET. If I don&#39;t \npost \n&gt; again, G&#39;night all!)\n\n\n"}}
