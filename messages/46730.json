And as for the acid \nit is \n&gt; covering his entire body. If he ejected his armor he&#39;d be screwed \nanyway \n&gt; because the acid in the cloud would just cling to his now exposed \nsuper \n&gt; structure which noone can eject because it is the body itself. And \nas for the \n&gt; flames sticking to void, even if they did it would have been put \nout \n&gt; immediately by his body. Thank you dewboy for screwing your \ncharachter over.\n&gt; \n&gt; IC:\n&gt; \n&gt; As the four not so point blank range plasma blasts fly out at Void, \nhe \n&gt; quickly ducks to avoid them. At the same time the acidic cloud once \nagain \n&gt; expels a red acidic ooze all over thirst now eating away at his \nvery \n&gt; structure.\n\n\n"}}
