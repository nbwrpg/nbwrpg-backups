She chased him, then he chased her. \nIt went on like this for hours. They played their aggressive game of \nbeast tag. Wildfire was a pure pshyic, but Rowdy Wolf had \nconnections. She kicked her hooves out when he got too close.\n\nShe made the forest look darker with her flash of images and made him \nloose his direction a few times. She made her warnings to stay away \nfrom the Predacons. She showed that they were her race and they could \nbe just as deadly as her. \n\nThey went on with their mind war.\n\n\n"}}
