Move, or get \n&gt;moved.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron moved and Hell Beast, Jackle, and a healdess Inferno entered.\n&gt;They searced there room, and Inferno placed his head back on to his neck. \n&gt;:::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron ::: Satisfied?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast ::: we both know that I dont like you, and you dont like me. \n&gt;I\n&gt;want you gone, dead, away from here.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron ::: What are you gonna do about it?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast ::: For now, nothing.
