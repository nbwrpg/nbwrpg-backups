Let me repost that last one there. *blushes* Eh heh.\n&gt; \n&gt; DarkMouse:: She saw Galvatron attack the dragon with the cat in \nit&#39;s \n&gt; clutches.  She turned and fired again on the dragon trying to turn \n&gt; her into mouse-crispies. She dodged one fireball,well, almost.  She \n&gt; stopped and sniffed the air. &quot;Something Burning?&quot;  She turned and \nsaw \n&gt; the tip of her tail on fire. &quot;YEEEEEEOOOOOOWWWWW!&quot; She started \n&gt; patting her tail trying to smother the fire.  When the fire was \nout, \n&gt; she looked at her tail and a look of pain, remorse and great sorrow \n&gt; crossed her face.  She cried,&quot;Look at my tail. My pretty tail,&quot; she \n&gt; cried. She then turned and looked at the dragon with a rage that \n&gt; would have sent it to the pit if her optics had the power. &quot;YOU \nBURNT \n&gt; MY TAIL! PREPARE TO BE DELETED!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She transformed into mouse mode and springed up towards the dragon \n&gt; and tried to bite at it. Trying to latch on with her long, sharp \n&gt; incisers and sinking them into it&#39;s leg. &quot;DIE!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Panzer::\n&gt; She was still off line. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  Galvatron watched as the lizard grabbed her. &quot;Oh hell no.&quot; He \nflew \n&gt; off after \n&gt; &gt; the lizard bot. He was much quicker with his advanced tecehnology \n&gt; and flew \n&gt; &gt; over him and stopped infront about 5 feet. He sent a power surge \n&gt; from his \n&gt; &gt; chest and a fire from both his hands. Trying hard not to hit the \n&gt; bot. God \n&gt; &gt; neptune crept behind the lizard attacking Dark Mouse and send  a  \n&gt; Grenade \n&gt; &gt; behind his back and it was set to explode about 5 inches from his \n&gt; back.\n\n\n"}}
