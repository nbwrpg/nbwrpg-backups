Only a chicken would threaten someone else instead of their real=\r\n\n&gt; opponent.  Nightlights not your challenger, I AM!  And I challenge you t=\r\no a\n&gt; one on one, RIGHT HERE AND NOW!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; While fighting the Skarkticons, =\r\nStraightshots words are heard by Quickstride\n&gt; and Rattrap, who look back i=\r\nn alarm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; IS SHE OUTA HER MIND!?    PRICKLES! DON&#39;T !  HE&#39;LL SEND YA S=\r\nTRAIGHT\n&gt; TA THE JUNKYARD! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straightshot keeps her optics on Saberback=\r\n.  She ignores the cries of\n&gt; warning and wrinkles her snout in combative w=\r\narning, chattering her teeth in\n&gt; porcupine fashion.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; C&#39;mon what are y=\r\na waiting for!?  Bring it!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSABERBACK smiled as he looked at STRAIG=\r\nHTSHOT, =93You Maximals, always\nlooking for the fair fight, looking for the=\r\n honor in all things.=94 He\nchuckled, &quot;And yet you have no idea what you up=\r\n against do you?=94 His\nlaughter becomes far more menacing\n\nLooking back at=\r\n NIGHTLIGHT he winked at her, =93Wait here will you?=94 His\nwords were at o=\r\nnce both kind and yet in their kindness there was a\ncold malice and an evil=\r\n confidence and arrogance.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nghtlight watched around unable to =\r\ndo something, she felt so exausted to\n&gt; move\n\nTurning to look at STRAIGHTSH=\r\nOT there was a dark humor in SABERBACK,\n=93It has been said once that scien=\r\nce would one day become sufficiently\nadvanced to seem like magic.=94 He cur=\r\nled his taloned fingers into fists\nas a reddish purple hued force shield sn=\r\napped into place around him.\n\n=93Now come you foolish Maximal, face my, mag=\r\nic, if you dare!=94 SABERBACK\nleaped at STRAIGHTSHOT seeming to float in th=\r\ne air as he did so.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride faces his own issues with the =\r\nSharkticons and rears up on his\n&gt; hind legs, using his hooves to try and wa=\r\nrd them off.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; These goons are worse than horseflies!  GET OUTA HERE IF=\r\n YA KNOW THAT&#39;S\n&gt; GOOD FOR YA!  &quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nQUICKSTRIDE=92s hooves are used t=\r\no good affect as two of the hordes of\nSHARKTICONS are taken out, the hard s=\r\nurface of his hooves penetrating\ntheir armor and into their internal struct=\r\nures. Both of them fall to\nthe ground, their systems failing as they did so=\r\n.\n\nHowever there are more right behind, ever ready to take the place of\nthe=\r\nir fallen comrades. Horseflies may indeed be an applicable\nillustration of =\r\ntheir attack method, if Horseflies were as large as\nyou were and had large =\r\nteeth that could easily penetrate your armor as\nwell. However just like the=\r\n proverbial horsefly they were easy to\nkill, but unfortunately there are al=\r\nways more!\n\nAt the same RAT TRAP is also facing his share of these creaturs=\r\n as\nthey were able to fly and swoop and maneuver in ways that they never\nse=\r\nemed to be able to do before.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT paused.  The SHARKTICONS=\r\n seemed to be barely sentient, but reliant\n&gt; upon a general to give them or=\r\nders ni battle and direct them.  However, the\n&gt; GENERAL seemed to be conten=\r\nt to hold back, and fighting him directly would\n&gt; require simultaneously en=\r\ngaging him AND his forces.  The DINOBOT of old\n&gt; would have relished such a=\r\n challenge, but for this new incarnation, &#39;honor&#39;\n&gt; was the last thing on h=\r\nis processor.\n&gt;\n&gt; Going to try and engage the SHARKTICONS group by gruop, a=\r\nttempting to thin\n&gt; down thier numbers with hit and run tactics, counting t=\r\nhat the groups would\n&gt; be trying to pursue them to just overwhelm with numb=\r\ners, and thus running\n&gt; into one another and messing up their formations wi=\r\nth each hit and run\n&gt; attack of his own, trying to thin the herd.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nD=\r\nINOBOT is reasonably astute in his assessment of the situation, at\nleast as=\r\n far as he could see it. SKYBYTE did seem to be giving them\ngeneral directi=\r\non and impetus. While he was not controlling them by\nremote control or on a=\r\nn individual basis, he was acting as a guiding\nforce in matters, directing =\r\nthem to where the MAXIMAL and PREDACON\nforces were the weakest and exploiti=\r\nng what he could.\n\nUsing his superior speed and armor DINOBOT is able to be=\r\ngin the act of\nthinning their number as his hit and run tactics are beginni=\r\nng to have\nan impact on the SHARKTICONS!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, VICE GRIP =\r\nwas of a different mindset, just going to charge in\n&gt; directly over towards=\r\n SKYBYTE!  Of course, this would lead his charge right\n&gt; through the main c=\r\nluster of SHARKTICONS, and give them a golden opportunity\n&gt; to dogpile (or =\r\nsharkpile) on him..\n\nSKYBYTE blinked as he noted VICE GRIP moving straight =\r\nthrough the\nSHARKTICONS coming straight at him. In a quick move he has the\n=\r\nSHARKTICONS converge on his position in an effort to pile up on the\napproac=\r\nhing VICE GRIP!\n\nHowever that maneuver also has the affect of further thinn=\r\ning out the\nranks as they focused on the center. It is at that point that t=\r\nhe\nMAXIMAL FUZORS begin to act, their teeth and claws ripping through the\nS=\r\nHARKTICONS, spreading out and attacking left and right creating an\nexplosio=\r\nn of confusion that SKYBYTE was having trouble directing.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mean=\r\nwhile, Tucson continues to step forth to face Magmatron.  With no fear,\n&gt; j=\r\nust the courage he was programmed with, he takes a brave step forward.  He\n=\r\n&gt; holds his hand back to Leo and Big Convoy.  It was clear that he wanted t=\r\no\n&gt; fight him on his own, knowing that it was his idea to come this far and=\r\n he\n&gt; alone had to complete the journey.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Leo, Convoy, help Optimus, I=\r\n will deal with Magmatron.  I started this\n&gt; journey, now I must complete i=\r\nt.    Very well Magmatron you have your\n&gt; battle. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes his Martia=\r\nl Arts stance, and prepares to go one on one with\n&gt; Magmatron.  And hopeful=\r\nly win back what the Silver Dragon had fought for so\n&gt; many years .\n\n\nLEO P=\r\nRIME and BIG CONVOY nod, =93Be careful. . . he is probrably the\nmost danger=\r\nous foe here and I would guess the most dangerous one you\nhave ever met.=94=\r\n They quickly take off towards OPTIMUS!\n\nMeanwhile MAGMATRON smiled, =93So =\r\nyou sent off your backup? How unwise\nof you.=94 He chuckled as he looked do=\r\nwn at TUSCON as MAGMATRON stood at\nnearly twice TUSCON&#39;s height. =93I have =\r\nbeen fighting since long before\nyou were a pulse in you your creation matri=\r\nx&#39;s thought process.=94\n\nHe looked at TUSCON, =93You believe that you have =\r\nskills.=94 MAGMATRON=92s\nchuckle was becoming open derisive laughter, =93Yo=\r\nu don=92t realize just\nhow little you have.=94\n\nWith a forward sweep he sla=\r\nshed forward with a sword that was about\nthe same size as TUSCON himself!\n\n=\r\nIn the background DARK RODIMUS and RODIMUS were still in battle\npushing the=\r\nmselves to the limit as each kick and punch was met with an\nequally skilled=\r\n counter attack.\n\nGuard, Perry, Thrust!\n\nTheir steps taking them ever close=\r\nr to the form of OPTIMUS who hung\nover the pit!\n\nHowever at the same time S=\r\nKYSHADOW and his FUZORS had fought their way\nthrough the crowd of SHARKTICO=\r\nNS and were also making their own way to\nOPTIMUS, their optics looking at h=\r\nim greedily.\n\nMeanwhile in the far corner, against the wall, away from the =\r\nbattle at\nlarge, the dark form of CRYOTEK was beginning to stir and his col=\r\nd\ncrimson optics snapped back as he head rose and looked around. He\nlooked =\r\nat OPTIMUS PRIME as he started to rise.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
