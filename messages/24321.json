LOL)\n\n(OOC 2: Jeez, this has to be the .. 6th long post I&#39;ve done today.. \nall my RPG&#39;s counted together, that is *_*)\n\n(** ** are dream sequences..)\n\n\n\nTeltoli, in her beast mode, rolled over in her sleep, now coming to \nrest on her stomach. Her eyelids flickered as she dreamed.\n\n\n**Her father, BladeStryke, was standing in front of her, looking her \nstraight in the optics. His body was tall and muscular, making her \nfeel intimidated even though she knew her father would do nothing to \nhurt her...\n\n&quot;Daughter, why have you run away like a coward? I trained you in the \nways of a warrior and you abondoned them! Abandoned me!&quot; His voice \nrose to a shout as he lifted a hand, as if to hit her.\n\n&quot;No!! I didn&#39;t run away! The battle was .. was .. I don&#39;t know! I \ncouldn&#39;t handle it!&quot; She cried, holding her arms in front of her, so \nif the blows came she might be able to block them.\n\nSuddenly her mother, Pasque, appeared next to her father, with a \ndissaproving look on her face, which was aimed towards BladeStryke. \n&quot;Blade, she is customed to the Way of the Leaf, leave her alone&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not customed to the Way of the Leaf!&quot; teltoli shouted, feeling \nhelpless. \n\nBladeStryke turned to Pasque, and brought his huge battle axe and \nbrought it back, for a hard blow. His eyes glittered red, and \nsuddenly her mother was on the floor, on her knees, pleading with \nBladeStryke.\n\n&quot;NO!! FATHER! Stop!&quot; Teltoli tried to run towards her father, but it \nseemed like her feet were stuck in cement**\n\n\nThe sounds of screaming animals and ripping flesh was heard \nthroughout the forest, and Teltoli moaned quietly in her sleep, her \nwings rustling.\n\n\n**The battle axe turned into a raptor, much to her surprise, and \nleapt upon her mother, teeth gleaming in the light and claws out, \nready to tear her armour**\n\n\n&quot;Woah!&quot; Teltoli leapt upright, and her eagle squawked with fright by \nher sudden movement. Her eyes darted wildly, taking in her position. \nShe was in a forest, but the sounds of ripping flesh and screeches \nwere still there, just a little faded. The Fuzor shuddered, and sat \ndown, wondering what on Earth could be making that horrible sound.\n\n&quot;Just a nightmare&quot; She muttered to herself. &quot;A very vivid \nnightmare..&quot;. Nothing like that had ever happened to her, or her \nparents, but it was frightening just the same. She hadn&#39;t heard from \nPasque or BladeStryke in about two years now.\n\nForcing herself up on her legs, she started walking slowly to the \nsource of the noise. Looking up towards the tree, Teltoli noted the \neagle was still sitting there, unsure whether to follow or not.\n\n&quot;Come on.. Sabre?&quot; She winced at the name. It had been the name of \nher old friend back in battle training, but the eagle seemed to \napprove. Rustling his feathers, the eagle now dubbed &#39;Sabre&#39; perched \non her shoulder as they walked.\n\n\n"}}
