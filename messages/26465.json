They were dead, all dead?!\nHis ears pressed against his head and he whined, long and mournful. He bowed \nhis head and sat there.\nEven the woman who was so nice to him...dead.\nHe knew what death was and he didn&#39;t like it.\nD heaved a sigh and looked out towards the edge of the island, wondering \njust where that ship was where the deaths of friends lingered.\nBut he knew better then to linger over death too much, wondering if he would \nmake any friends here that might replace the ones he lost.\nOne never knew.\nD looked at Fenox, slightly whining again. But he soon got to his feet and \nshook himself, still slightly saddened but thinking that dwelling on it \nwouldn&#39;t help. They were gone and there was nothing he could do about it.\nHe gestured towards the Iron Fist.*\n\n&quot; Show?&quot;\n\n* He wanted to see the inside, maybe meet some more of these beings of \nsteel.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
