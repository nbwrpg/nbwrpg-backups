Medic? Yeah right. This bot was back-up to \nRamulus, just a precaution. But now Prebon was in a jam. Slayer had \nno clear shot at Ramulus, and he needed to make up something about \nthe where-abouts of Striker. But he still had an ace up his sleeve: \nSpears. Last time to get away from the Maximals he threatened to \norder Spears to terminate herself. He could always rely on the soft \nhearts of the Maximals to twirl around his finger. But that was last \nresort. He was hoping to get Ramulus&#39; body intact so he could use it \nto host the spark of Lightrade, but that can&#39;t happen. Maybe he could \npiece something together from the remnants of both these bots. And \nperhaps any others that were waiting, cloaked, to attack. But he had \na great plan ready.\n\n&quot;Striker is a fool. When we were getting ready to release him, he was \nirritable and attacked us. My men had to do extreme repair and are on \ntheir way, bringing him. Now, here&#39;s the deal. Spears walks over \ncarefully to you. You hand her the map. She walks half of the way \nback. She throws the map to me. She does not go back to you! She \nstays right there, between us. If you try anything than to pull her \ncloser or escape, I will send a signal to my men to end Striker&#39;s \nlife before he arrives. I&#39;ll decide how to do the exchange when he \ngets here.&quot;\n\nPrebon than sent a message directly into Spears&#39;s head, communication \nusing the chip.\n\n*Forget the map. When you get close enough to Ramulus, or the other \nit doesn&#39;t matter, pull a spear with your quickest speed and stab him \nrepeadidly.*\n\n&quot;Go on! Get my map!&quot;\n\nPrebon walked away for a bit, making it look like he was frustrated \nthat he wasn&#39;t getting a lot in the deal. But he was really sending a \nmessage. than he mumbled under his breath.\n\n&quot;Ignatius, take Savage with you into the air and circle around. As \nsoon as Spears&#39; stabs a bot with a Spear, open fire on the ground.&quot;\n\nHe than sent one to Slayer.\n\n&quot;As soon as Spears&#39; stabs a bot with a Spear, you hit your jetpack \nand come down, dodging fire from above, and kill Ramulus.&quot;\n\nPrebon returned to the exchange, thinking that all was in place.\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream/Gotron\n\nStarscream walked out of the caves to here The Lavacons transmission.\n\n&quot;Oh, I will give you a target. We will have a target very soon.&quot;\n\nHe walked over to teh body of Megatron, and began figuring out a way \nto remove the spark.\n\nMeanwhile Gotron acknowledged KitKat.\n\n&quot;All right, I will wait for word.&quot;\n\nHe saw Bloodystriker, and instantly recognized him. He walked over.\n\n&quot;I remember you. You were the bot who opened the doors the first time \nto the Alliance base. Listen, I really hope you aren&#39;t doing what I&#39;m \nthinking you&#39;re doing. We were just given an order not to tell Zardus \nanything. As long as we are with this group, we have to follow it&#39;s \norders. We don&#39;t want to make this group an enemey, and acting like \nspies is going to make them one. We will tell Zardus whe it&#39;s all \nright.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
