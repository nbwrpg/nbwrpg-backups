But when Ro=\r\ndimus was taken, like you my heart spark felt like it had shattered into a =\r\nthousand pieces.  But I can tell you this. I feel it deep down inside my sp=\r\nark, that your mother will return to you and she will be very happy to see =\r\nyou once again.&quot;\n\nHe listens to voices comming from the other&#39;s direction. =\r\n He then turns his head back to Elita.\n\n&quot; About Perceptor, he really is try=\r\ning hard to redeem himself, yet, I don&#39;t think the others quite understand =\r\nhow hard it is to do such a thing.  Like you, I see it too.  He&#39;s trying ve=\r\nry hard to become one of us, but there are a few of our comrades who do not=\r\n have as much faith as we do.  Faith is important if we&#39;re going to combat =\r\nHydras.  We&#39;ll need it, and if you have that faith, so do I.  Come, I think=\r\n it&#39;s time we had a talk with the other Autobots and Maximals.&quot;\n\nHe gently =\r\ncarries Elita in his arm, and walks back into the room where Kup and the ot=\r\nhers are.  His expression was quite serious at this point, yet not one that=\r\n would indicate anger so to speak.  Rat Trap now sees his expression and lo=\r\noks to the others.\n\n&quot; I - do believe this is a good time for me ta go out&#39;n=\r\n try ta find somethn&#39; ta eat.&quot;\n\nHe gets into rat mode.  Quickstride transfo=\r\nrms into his equine mode, and follows him.\n\n&quot;Yep, right on, my stomach&#39;s gr=\r\nowling too..  Wonder if there&#39;s any more of those bean pods out there..&quot;\n\nN=\r\night Shift and Straight Shot also read the expression on their leader&#39;s fac=\r\ne.\n\n&quot;Yeah, this would be a good time ta look for Energon deposits that we c=\r\nan convert inta useable energy.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds and joins Night Shift=\r\n.\n\n&quot;Good idea, never know when we&#39;ll need more fuel.&quot;\n\nTucson was now alone=\r\n with everyone in the room. \n\n&quot; If we&#39;re going to gain the upper hand on Hy=\r\ndras, we have mostly everything we need, except for one thing, which is mos=\r\nt imperative to our cause.  Faith.  We have that with each other, but when =\r\nit comes to those who are trying to turn over a new leaf, I see a lack of i=\r\nt.  I can not stress enough on the importance of all around faith in each o=\r\nther.  If we do not have that, we are not ready to confront our worst enemy=\r\n.  Rodimus would surely agree with me, that faith is of the essence, becaus=\r\ne at first, I too was distrustful of Rodimus once he had been freed of the =\r\nshell program.  But now I see where that distrust would have gotten me, and=\r\n I too had to come around and give faith a chance.  I know we can do that, =\r\nwe&#39;re Autobots and Maximals.  We believe in each other, and now, among us, =\r\nis a Predacon who has shown great courage by helping us here now.  Please, =\r\ndo not let distrust weaken your faith.  It&#39;s what Hydras would want, to see=\r\n us fall and I&#39;m not about to let that happen, and neither should any of yo=\r\nu.&quot;\n\nHe stands tall, holding Elita in his arm.

Before I was rendered blind, we&#39;d do many \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; missions side by side.  Of course, him being Hot Rod, a sports vehcile =\r\nand \n&gt; &gt; me, an average compact SUV, off roading vehicle, with no interest =\r\nin \n&gt; &gt; speed, we&#39;d often kid each other about speed versus rugged durabili=\r\nty over \n&gt; &gt; off road terrain.  One day, we were driving toward a mission t=\r\no stop \n&gt; &gt; Galvatron&#39;s path of destruction, when our path got blasted by u=\r\nnknown \n&gt; &gt; enemy fire.  We knew we couldn&#39;t let a rock slide stop us, and =\r\nwe didn&#39;t. \n&gt; &gt; I knew I could&#39;ve just drove over it, and gotten to the oth=\r\ner side with no \n&gt; &gt; problem. But Rodimus wasn&#39;t built for that in his alt =\r\nform.  We never left \n&gt; &gt; each other&#39;s side that day.  We found a way to ge=\r\nt around that obsticle \n&gt; &gt; together, even though we had conflicting ideas =\r\non how to do it, but, \n&gt; &gt; eventually we did compromise and we thwarted Gal=\r\nvatron with the aid of the \n&gt; &gt; other Autobots.  Sometimes opposites work w=\r\nell together, and Rodimus \n&gt; &gt; proved it that day.  I guess that&#39;s what dro=\r\nve me to rescue him. I \n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t think of how I would manage, if I had =\r\nnot had him by my side.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He gently rubs Elita&#39;s shoulders.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;I wish I could remember what happened to Bumblebee and Spike, and \n&gt; &gt; Kre=\r\nmzeem, but after I was rendered off line for several vorns, I lost a \n&gt; &gt; g=\r\nood portion of my memory. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Like Rodimus, Tucson&#39;s gentile embrace =\r\ntakes on a paternal aspect. He \n&gt; &gt; holds Elita as if she were his own.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot; And don&#39;t you worry about your mother, Stanton will find a way to br=\r\ning \n&gt; &gt; her back, I&#39;m sure of it.  But you also have to keep that hope ali=\r\nve in \n&gt; &gt; your heart.  The more hope, the more chances of her healing.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson was now swapping his status to a more parental role.  It felt =\r\ngood \n&gt; &gt; to be with Elita, and right at this moment, he wasn&#39;t about to tr=\r\nade that \n&gt; &gt; joy with anything else.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Elita:ow\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Elit=\r\na took Tucson&#39;s Hand as a lost child seeking  a friend, she was in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; he=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt;&gt; robot mode that had a strong look of Nightlight with the golden-red =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; colors\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Mom told me that story... and othe=\r\nr ones...
