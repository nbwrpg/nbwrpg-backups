For example, you were telling Airly \nthat Blacknightmare couldn&#39;t escape, and since she chose the \nwrong choice, which I will remind you was nearly impossible to get \nright (she doesn&#39;t follow your line of thinking), her character was (as \nAzure correctly put:) condemmed to death. Airly&#39;s character should \nhave the ability to escape, unless she has agreed to have that \ncharacter killed. The RPG is designed for people to have fun RPing \ntheir characters, not to have them killed. You don&#39;t seem to \nunderstand this though... and that is part of why there have been \ncomplaints. You also have to note that the complaints were not \nstaged behind your back, Azure made it clear he didn&#39;t like what \nyou were doing to Blacknightmare, Gunthers has voiced his \nopinions, frequently, as have Yanshosh and myself. Imho, it takes \nmore guts to post opinions over the messageboard, than it does to \nemail the privately. About your second Infecticon base: So what if \nyour second base is important. That doesn&#39;t make it anymore \nimportant than any other RPers base, and it shouldn&#39;t, so why \nshould it be so impregnable, and heavily defended? When you say \n&quot;a great many players&quot; you must realize that there are like 19 \nactive members and &#39;great&#39; probably refers to several people at \nmost, and I can&#39;t think of who those people might be. Gunthers \nwas correct when he said that you don&#39;t seem to notice you \nproblems, and that you can&#39;t give up a &quot;talk fight&quot;. The text below \nremoves proves that quite efficiently...\n\n&lt;&lt;After checking I found out sunlight only reaches 100 meters into \nthe ocean, which is roughly 300 feet. So if we go by what you said \nGunthers and the decepts were &quot;20,000 leagues under the sea&quot; \nthat means they were really fucking far down under the ocean. \nWoot, now dont you feel like the dumbass that you are gunthers? I \nthought so.&gt;&gt; (yah, is used your style KSL, it works well =P)\n\nWhat you just said makes you sound more like a dumbass than \nGunthers... \n\nRegardless, this RPG is sort of different than your RPG, so role \nplay your charactesr accordingly. (btw, you still have to edit your \nprofiles as decreed by council discussion) Also, last thing for this \nmessage, is your base setup like the G1 Decepticon Base?\n\nThis will be the last OOC post relating to this topic. Any further \npost will bring about moderation or some form of punishment to the \nposter. It IS quite possible to keep this private, and not take up \nanyone who is not involved&#39;s time. Also, if anyone replies to this \nwith a BIC included the will suffer the same punishment. The \nOOC/BIC thingy was intended to keep people from posting solely \nOOC posts, not to post a one line BIC and then have a two page \nOOC. Email PRIVATELY. It is really quite simple. =)\n\n"}}
