It took alot more than a tackle to take down a bot \nas large as Killfest. A shot nearly hits Killfest&#39;s head, but misses \nby an inch.\n\nKillfest grabbs Aerostreak with one large hand, slamming the bot down \nonto his knee and the pointed spike on it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven laughs as shots pummell his armor, denting it. He aims his \nmissile launchers, sending out two from each launcher at Nighteyes.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Please remember the shot limits, JP)\n\nEndBringer fires two missiles at the incoming missiles, managing to \ntake five of them out. The remaining three hit him in the chest, \nsending him flying backwards. He roars and jumps up, firing two \nmissiles from each launcher at Tarantulus.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther rolls in the air, avoiding several shots. One of them hits \nhim in the side, but does little damage.\n\nFlipping out his charge launcher, he fires off three charges down at \nAkron, some hitting the trees and setting them on fire, others \npassing through the canopy toward Akron.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDrillBit swears as he&#39;s sent flying backwards by an energon bolt. He \nreturns fire with his gatling gun.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA shot hits right in front of Dollen, charring the bushes. He fires \nback with a charge.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA shadow passes over the fighting bots as a five-headed dragon flies \nover the battlefield.\n\n&quot;I have arrived,&quot; Darkfate says to Killfest over the comm as he \nbreathes fire over the enemies.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Tarantulas, in his vhicle mode, flew off his tires as al lthe \nshots aimed \n&gt; at him impacted. He gathered his thought, and sent a batch of eight \ncluster \n&gt; missles at EndBringer.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Tankkor growled as he was pelted with blasts. He turned and \nsent his mian \n&gt; laser turret blast at Killfest.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Nighteyes covered her head, and with a bleeding hand, began to \nunload on \n&gt; Greven.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aerostreak dove into Killfest, sending them both skidding \nacross the \n&gt; forest floor. (Hope you dont take that as a mode, sorry if you do.)\n&gt; \n&gt;     Akron pickes her target. She see&#39;s Darkmouse and Scather, \n(Well, dosent \n&gt; actually see Scather) and sends several Energon bolt blasts at them.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Putnam spots Golden eyes, and takes off into the air. He \nextends his \n&gt; hands and manages to grab hold of her leg, and begins to drain some \nenergy \n&gt; out of her.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Odiphious takes his riffle out and fires at Drillbit, and then \nsends an \n&gt; energon bolt at him.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Venus, armed with an energon pistol, fires at Dollen. She is \nstil lsore \n&gt; from a hit she took in the shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron turns to Megaton. &quot;Come on, Megaton, Marine, Pheniox, \nJackle, \n&gt; and Gremlin. Youre all coming with me to help out in the forest. \nLets go.&quot;\n&gt;     Megatron was finally going to strech his legs after beening \ncooped up in \n&gt; the ice cave for so long.\n\n\n"}}
