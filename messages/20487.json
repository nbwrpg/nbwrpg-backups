It had seen an exchanged between two polar bears, but it was \nnot about to attack two of those huge things.\n\nThe wolf stopped, looking at a white form laying on the snow. It was \none of the polarbears the wolf had seen earlier.\n\nCreeping closer, the wolf sniffed the air, the smell of blood very \nprominent. Food....\n\nTHe wolf creeps closer, trying not to make a sound.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; (Well, it&#39;s not like that one was that hard there Cyber.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She noticed the bear appeared nervous. She stepped back from the \nbear \n&gt; and kept walking on. She stopped and looked back at the bear. She \n&gt; msiled, &quot;Yeah,your a noble animal. And thank you for your \n&gt; generosity.&quot;  SHe smiled at the bear then continued on.\n&gt; Leaving the bear behind. \n&gt; \n&gt; She felt her shoulder throbbing and hurting even more. She was \n&gt; starting to have trouble walking.  She kept going and went over the \n&gt; hill.  She stumbled and rolled down the hill. She landed on her \nchin \n&gt; and cut her lip on one of her teeth. She stood up and cursed under \n&gt; her breath. Her shoulder was still dripping red liquid and now her \n&gt; lip had a small cut.  She tasted the fluid and grimiced. &quot;Ick, Oh \n&gt; that stuff tasted horrible.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She walked a little further until she shoulder hurt so badly she \n&gt; didn&#39;t want to take another step. She layed down in the snow and \n&gt; breathed heavily.  The pain was getting worse, and she was starting \n&gt; to get hungry, very hungry.\n\n\n"}}
