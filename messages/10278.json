She kept her hand covered and flung the dagger back. It missed=\r\n Plintissa and hit Artist in the leg. Dracona smiled in satisfaction. Plint=\r\nissa tackled Dacona and took her down. Dracona once again turned to her saw=\r\n blade to saw into Plintissa. Dracona fired an ice beam, but Plintissa dodg=\r\ned. Dracona started to burn everything with fire beams.

Plintissa grabbed her arm from earlier =\r\nand threw it. It hit Dracona&#39;s blade. Dracona slammed it into Plintissa, bu=\r\nt as she did, the blade came loose before it hit Plintissa. The blade flew =\r\nup. Dracona blinked her eye, the one Dinobot had scarred when she first ari=\r\nved on the planet. The blade sawed through Dracona and left her in pieces e=\r\nverywhere. Her spark extinguished. Her last words were:\n\n    &quot;*Cough, Cough=\r\n* Zardus I am sorry. Plintissa, do not forget your promise.&quot; And Dracona di=\r\ned smiling. Plintissa remembered that she promised Dracona that she would n=\r\never leave her sitting. Plintissa cried. Her mech fluid ran everywhere and =\r\nshe got weaker and weaker.

Artist looked at Team =\r\nUltima&#39;s base. It was destroyed, the funny thing was, that it was destroyed=\r\n by Dracona, the very one, along with Plintissa, that originally built it. =\r\nAnd there it was, sticking above ground now and burning away. Sinesis looks=\r\n at the base and sighs.\n\n    &quot;Twister, Dracona is dead, I guess we have to =\r\nleave.&quot; Sinesis says. Sinister stands next to Blizzard and sighs.\n\n    &quot;Bli=\r\nzzard, we need to find another home, now.&quot; Sinister said sadly.\n\n    Artist=\r\n came closer to Plintissa. Her spark suddenly burst from her and floated in=\r\nto Artist&#39;s hands. She said to him what he needed to do. He opened his ches=\r\nt compartment and his spark was revealed. Artist combined Plintissa&#39;s spark=\r\n with his own, they became one.\n\n    &quot;Till all are one.&quot; Artist whispered r=\r\neally low. Plintissa told him she still loved him.
