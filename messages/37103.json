He transforms again, and drives over to \nthe wall. He begins drilling and has soon underminded the foundations \nof the building and it begins to topple, onto him.\n\nScattershot nods, &quot;I&#39;m there.&quot; He runs over to a section of the ruble \non the ground, and begins to clean it up. He understands the need for \nquickness and completion.\n\nAfterburner salutes Hoist as he follows him, &quot;So where are we going?\n\nPacifix finds the CR chamber with the almost dead Switchblade in \nit. &quot;I see.&quot; He opens the chamber up, and pulls out the disabled \nbot. &quot;We can&#39;t have you causing any terrorist activities, so I&#39;ll \ngive you to Ironhide and Sunstreaker to deal with.&quot; He carries the \nbot outside to Ironhide, &quot;Ironhide, here is the bot that JetV put \ninto the CR chamber, you should keep him in a containment cell when \nhis wounds repair. He may still be dangerous when you have him \ncompletely repaired, since he attacked us.&quot;\n\nCrossroads watches Pacifix and nods his agreement as the other bot \ncarries the enemy out of the ship. &quot;Good job, we need to leave soon, \nor we may be discovered.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
