However, he had no real intention of understanding this bot at all.\nHe had introduced himself in the worst way: Firing upon two bots in which he seemed to have no real intention to harm. Something that had spiked aggression from both Tavatron and himself, a factor that was not easily disposed of once activated.\nThough, Dinobot had shaped his entire life out of aggression, so it was not as if it was something new to him.\nWatching Hakibuscon intently he noticed that this enemy wore no insignia of any sort. No Predacon or Maximal symbol covered any inch of his armor.\nWas this a rouge bot? One in which belonged to no faction yet believed in their own justice and rights? A Neutral being?\nHe had to be, there was no other explanation.\nSuddenly the air became alive with the words of this strange bot, some of their meanings lost to the reptile warrior.\nFirst this bot attacked and now he was leaving, with no challenge?!! What was this?!\nDinobot growled as Hakibuscon�s words ended in a downhearted tone, disappointed that there had need now battle at all. Something in which he had been looking forward to, yet, also wished to avoid.\nA battle could cause harm towards Tavatron and the small clearing, destroying or permanently scarring either was no acceptable.\nDinobot watched Hakibuscon begin to walk away, again thinking of his spoken words.\nThis bots memory crossing his mind again: not likely, tell anybot of him: probably not, pretend he had never met him: easier done then said.\nHe knew that it was cold, however, there were very few bots in which he had ever bothered to remember, speak of or think about. And those he did were long time friends in which he had worked with in the past and had come to know. Those he did not bother to concern himself with were those in which he could not understand: in which Hakibuscon classified under.\nHe then suddenly saw the new bot turn back towards him and enter towards his position again, his movements suggesting that he was not tense with an oncoming battle�but in ease.\nHowever, a warrior never underestimated anybot. Whether they seemed small, mentally challenged or anything.\nAny being which did not seem all that threatening on the outside could be holding the most cunning mind within.\nA factor in which he had learned the hard way in his childhood.\nDinobot watched Hakibuscon very carefully as he approached him, turning in his direction as he simply walked past.\nThere was one very important rule in life: Only expose you back to a corps!\nThere was no chance in which he was about to get attacked on his blind side, still not knowing if this bot was going to attack but taking every precaution just in case.\nHe watched as Hakibuscon approached the water in which ran from the flowing waterfall, surprised as any bot as he saw him throw a perfectly good weapon into the water. Yet, his expression still reflected calculated aggression.\nNext was a ray gun and then a laser sword, all tossed into the water as if this bot just gave up on life and didn�t care any longer.\nDinobot narrowed his optics, glancing quickly towards Tavatron to see what he reaction would be.\nSuch bots as this never lasted long in a war such as this, no more then a few weeks or a month at most.\nEither not willing to fight or so deeply rooted in self putty that they just pulled themselves into their own little world and never recovered.\nHe had seen it all before, nothing new to him.\nDinobot simply watched as Hakibuscon then turned back towards him and spoke his peace, nothing much more then what he had said earlier.\nOnly that he was a bit wrong.\nNo bot was worthless and everybot had a purpose, though sometimes it seemed as if there was no hope. But there always was.\nGood things and easy times just didn�t appear at one�s feet, they had to make them happen!\nSure, bad things happened but they had to be accepted with the good.\nWithout bad events nobot would appreciate that good.\nIt was a way of life�some just didn�t have what it took to accept that.\nDinobot simply watched as Hakibuscon screamed his anger and pain, transformed and sped away. Not even bothering to look towards him as he disappeared into the distance.\nWhat that bot had not realized was that he did have a place in this war, he just had not found it yet.\nHis optics fell upon the shining and reflective surfaces of the running stream, watching the reflective light of the dying run dance and shimmer.\nWith a shake of his head he looked towards Tavatron and began to move towards the stream again, stopping on its bank and lifting the weapons from its cool waters.\nIf left for too long the weapons would rust and cause the water to become undrinkable, if removed now there would be no chance of that happening.\nDinobot lifted two of the soaked weapons out of the shining brook and simply casted them aside, totally useless now that they had been flooded with water and their components damp.\nThen lowering himself down to one knee and fishing out the last of the weapons, the missile launcher. Looking over the dripping piece of equipment as he pulled it from the shallow depths.\nHis voice clear.*\n\n� Any idea of what that was about?�\n\n* His question was that in which he knew that Tavatron would be most likely not to answer, having no more clue of the situation then himself.\nWith a clear sigh he then cast the launcher to the side as well, it falling useless and dripping beside the other two weapons. This had turned out to be quite a day�that was far from over.\nThere would be an overnight trek back to the Cybertronien Fire, where rest and relaxation was waiting there for both of them. Something that he was looking forward to.\nThere wasn�t a warrior alive that didn�t like a warm and dry place to sleep, to eat and relax battle strained muscles.\n\tThe great orb hung in the sky as it began to move lower towards the horizon of the Earth, painting the orange and pink clouds into that of gray and purple. The warm canvas of soft colors that made up the sky began to slowly darken, leaving the small clearing in the vast shadows of the gathering night.\nThe weight of the day weighed heavily upon the reptilian warriors� shoulder-plates, the stiffness of wounded and sore muscles paining as joints moved.\nDinobot slowly got to his feet, almost forgetting just how badly wounded he had been until his side seemed to spasm again.\nThere would be a short time for him to nurse his wounds while the rested here, waiting for the darkness of night to cover their travels from the preying optics of possible enemies.\nBesides, with all that had gone on that day, both Tavatron and himself deserved a rest to ease tension.\nDinobot looked again at the reflective surface of the water before transforming into beast mode, looking towards Tavatron as he slowly made his way towards a rise in the clearing�limping a bit heavier then before.*\n\n� There is a long night ahead of us, I suggest you use this time wisely.�\n\n* With that he simply continued towards the rise until he reached its crest and eased himself down onto the soft grass, snarling sharply as he felt the fresh pain of his open chest.\nThe air was cooling as he set to work on his wounds, first beginning with the one located upon his side.\nIf he wounds were not properly kept then they might become infected and cause him to become lame, no use to Tavatron or any other bot if that happened.\nAs he ran his steel fangs through his wound to pick up any shrapnel of his own armor he realized he was losing more fluid the he had first thought.\nWith a growl of frustration he found a piece of armor which was dug deeply into his side, locking his jaws onto it and pulling.\nThe shred of armor slid out slowly as the servos around it twitched in pain and reaction, mech-fluid gushing from either side of the shred until it finally was removed and he cast it aside.\nAs Dinobot looked back to his wounded side he snarled as he saw mech-fluid gush from the freshly opened wound and found himself a bit envious of Tavatron, with her animal abilities of simply licking her wounds clean and also having the clotting abilities.\nNot him. The only think he could do now was let it bleed itself out and hope that he didn�t bleed to death in the process.\nA bit concerned of the amount of fluid he was losing in his side as he went to work on his wounded chest, the grass around his back, front and side turning red with a wet glint to it.\nIt was times like this that he missed his organic beast mode greatly.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
