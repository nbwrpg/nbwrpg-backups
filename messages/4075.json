The others nodded and folowed him. Artist suddenly started laughing\nmadly at the fat that the People&#39;s Group was just composed of himself,\nDracona, 3 Radicons, and himself, and with Stranato&#39;s needs, he didn&#39;t know\nhow long that would last. Dracona stepped back outside and surveyed\neveryones damage. Plintissa searched for Iron Raptor, calling out Iron\nRaptor&#39;s name...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Iron Raptor&quot; &lt;ironraptor13@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, June 21, 2000 7:10 AM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars RPG\n\n\n\n* Iron Raptor sighed as she felt Prowl tightens his hold on her, it was\nhopeless to try and speak any sense into the rest of the Maximals but she\nstill wanted to try. But then her attention was averted back towards Prowl\nas she felt a little excitement in his body as he held her, and she knew\nthat when 100 feet up in the air that could be very dangerous!\nShe could feel that he was enjoying holding her but this was hardly the time\nor place, she just hoped that this little fact wouldn&#39;t distract him to the\npoint of taking his mind off of the battle where it should be.not the feel\nof her curves under his hand&#39;s touch.\nBut then she suddenly heard something coming towards them and she dearly\nhoped that it wasn&#39;t a tree like last time, when turning her head and looked\nshe then wished that it WAS a tree!\nShe saw the laser hit and cut through Prowl&#39;s wing and grimaced when they\nwent into a spiral, now she knew why she hated flying!\nHer stomach felt like it was in her throat as she then realized that they\nwere in a glide, her hands and legs clinging to Prowl as she pressed her\nbody to him. She slowly opened her optics but still clung, fearing that they\nmight have been scrap by now or have hit hard.but then hadn&#39;t.\nIron Raptor then looked up at Prowl as they lost altitude; she was damaged\nenough without having to crash!\nThanx to the fact that he couldn&#39;t keep his mind on the battle when she was\nnear him. She was flattered but also a bit pissed off; this wasn&#39;t the first\ntime that his wondering mind had caused trouble.\nShe sighed with a bit of annoyance but also a bit of expectance, she knew\nthat he loved her but this was just ridicules. *\n\n&quot; Keep your mind on the battle and not on me for a change, Feather Head!&quot;\n\n* Her tone was that of a bit of amusement and annoyance mixed, there was no\nharsh tinge to her voice at all as she then looked back into the optics of\nProwl. But then shook her head, she knew that their landing wouldn&#39;t be the\nbest in the world but she hoped that it wouldn&#39;t be too rough that he fell\nover, she was damaged and so was he.they didn&#39;t need further damage.\nIron Raptor then looked past Prowl&#39;s optics and at the hole in his wing in\nwhich was the cause of them slowly losing altitude, if only there was a way\nto patch it fast enough that they could regain their height and get to\nsafety. She growled, but there wasn&#39;t a way to patch it! Not here so high\nbut when she looked over her shoulder she then gasped.they weren&#39;t so high\nanymore!\nIron Raptor looked around for the position of Oblitertron as she then heard\nthe ground rush up, her own legs ready to absorb the impact for Prowl&#39;s\ndamaged leg. The Alliance mightmare wasn&#39;t too far off but just far enough\naway for them to be out of it&#39;s firing range.\nThe landing wasn&#39;t too bad but it was bad enough that it caused Iron Raptor\nto land on her back and then flip onto her damaged side, a yip of pain heard\nas a sharp rock dug into her side.\nWith a rather pained groan she then rose to her feet but then walked over to\nProwl, wondering if he was all right and not knowing how the fall had\ndamaged him. With a gentle hand she then reached out to him, concern in her\noptics but also the panicked need to get him to a CR chamber but a bit\nrelaxed that the Alliance enemy had now split up and was less of a threat. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\naddress on the Net!\nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
