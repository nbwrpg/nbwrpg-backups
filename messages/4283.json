First off, she sort of liked \nQuickstrike, but he hated her so she gave up on that idea.  She didn&#39;t know \nwhat to make of Scorponok.  He was a hard one to figure out.  One minute \nScorponok would be nice and the next yell at her.  He even took the credit \nfor finding the cave from her. She thought that all male bots must be the \nsame, selfish, unfeeling and tempermental.  Well, at least mental.  She \nshrugged her shoulders and just plain gave up on any male bot liking her.  \nIt wan&#39;t the fact that she wasnb&#39;t good looking, she was very good looking.  \nShe guessed that she just didn&#39;t fit in well enough for the guys to even \nnotice her.  She saw Stringtra flirt with Quickstrike.  And she remembered \nthat Quickstrike had been flirting with Black Arachnia.\n&quot;Nah, he&#39;s taken by the others.&quot; she whispered to herself. She just didn&#39;t \ncare anymore.  No bot would like her so why bother with trying.\n\nShe got up from the computer console and walked to the back of the cavern.  \nShe started to take measurements for an escape tunnel or two.\nShe sighed deeply and just told herself that her job is to obey Megatron. \nShe remined herself that this was war and not a social party.\nShe went back to making the calculations for escape tunnels.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
