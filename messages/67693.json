I have\nNightrazor much further in, but NOT IN THE BASE. I have stopped here\nand have him looking around because I need some sort of description of\nwhat is going on. I have not quite specified where he is because if the\nplayer who runs this city talks about armed guards I can flow with the\nchange. At the moment I imagine him either inside the mine area or\natleast near the entrance, but that is open depending on what the\nplayer shows. It looks as if Kratos (Airly) controls it all, and I was\nwaiting for a description or response from them.\n\n As far as I can tell the base is somewhere in the city ... and wasn&#39;t\nthe Bushido base the last place our runaway Minion was seen? Since\nUnicron hasn&#39;t mentioned any updated knowledge then these guys have to\nstart here. \n\nIf I am wrong in this, please let me know.\n\nThanks\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
