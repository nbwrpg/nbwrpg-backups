Him GRIMLOCK not mad, but what I see\n&gt; makes Me Wheelie SAD.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He went on, &quot;GRIMLOCK knwos that in him something is wrong, that he is\n&gt; playing to someone else&#39;s SONG.  But what WHEELIE has to say, that GRIMLOCK\n&gt; was not made this way.  He is not for someone else to play.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE trying to protect his friends, both SWOOP and GRIMLOCK then.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hoping to prevent a brawl from occurring, &quot;What me WHEELIE wants to say..\n&gt; Who else have you met, and from what way?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBACKSTOP stepped out to where he could be clearly seen by all. &quot;He&#39;s\ntalking about me.&quot; He said as he looked at WHEELIE, SWOOP and\nGRIMLOCK.\n\nBACKSTOP was an old MAXIMAL. Known by some as a wise elder who had\nbeen on CYBERTRON for quite some time, acting within the council and\nthen eventually going into seclusion. He had not been heard from in\nquite some time.\n\nAs he turned to regard different ones his MAXIMAL insignia was clearly\nvisable to all.\n\n&quot;Yes, him your leader now!&quot; GRIMLOCK said to SWOOP as hethen turned\nand growled dangerously at BACKSTOP. &quot;I will destroy him.&quot;\n\nSWOOP shook his head, &quot;No Gimlock, you always leader!&quot;\n\nBACKSTOP held up his hands, fingers opened wide in a gesture of peace.\n&quot;No Grimlock, I command no one, your troops are your own.&quot; BACKSTOP&#39;s\nvoice was the voice of a wise elder, a sage.\n\n&quot;Me Slag say let&#39;s smash!&quot; SLAG said, SLUDGE and SNARL grumbled in agreement.\n\nGRIMLOCK stomped the ground sending shockwaves through it. &quot;No!&quot; He\nsaid as he looked over at WHEELIE, &quot;What do you mean? Me Grimlock no\nsing.&quot; He seemed confused, but somehow focused on WHEELIE. &quot;Explain\nwhat you mean?&quot;\n\nHowever even as GRIMLOCK spoke his words were once again going from a\nfight for control to all an out anger and rage. &quot;Explain now, me\nGrimlock demand it!&quot;\n\nBACKSTOP glanced at WHEELIE, &quot;He will need help to overcome this.\nSomehting has affected his programing.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
