Why? Because I&#39;m the only \n&gt;one willing to do it and I have no command over the shields. I can&#39;t wait \n&gt;to see who attacks us next. Maybe we&#39;ll be attacked by a battle cruiser \n&gt;(not really) all because I have a bounty on my head.\n&gt;\n&gt;There was a crash sound outside, and a computer voice said &quot;special \n&gt;Delivery.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Arrow: Who&#39;s going to get that?...\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: airly2000@...\n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, August 06, 2001 1:41 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Trinity\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Trinity::\n&gt;\n&gt;   Trinity left the base and looked around and shouted &quot;Hello ? where\n&gt;   are all?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
