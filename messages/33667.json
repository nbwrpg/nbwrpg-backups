It has different names \nfrom different cultures.  The term used by the German Earth culture was \nBlitzkrieg, literally translated it means lightning war.  The principle is to \navoid trading blows with the enemy.  Hit them hard and fast so that they \ncan&#39;t recover to hurt you.  Not only does this stop the immediate threat it \nalso shocks others into avoiding conflict with you.&quot;\n\n"}}
