But on \n&gt; the other hand, that Cerberus guy basically denounced the fact that \nwe are \n&gt; Destrons.  I will only continue if Magmatron insures us that our \nlives are \n&gt; not in danger and that we will be considered as much Destrons as \nhis other \n&gt; troops are.\n&gt; ::The others agree and wait for Shredders responce::\n\n\n"}}
