He walked \nback =\r\nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ship to look. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was in bad shape, his face had be=\r\nen ripped apart, and \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; visor over his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ocular systems. =\r\nNow everyone could see the protoform \n&gt; &gt; underneath, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the red eye \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that turned and looked. His faceplate was smashed and \ndented, \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; and his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;windshield&quot; chest was broken, so one could see the =\r\n\nshoulder \n&gt; &gt; &gt; joints on the &gt; inside. All in all he looked like some sor=\r\nt of \n&gt; &gt; robot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sent back from the future, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to change the =\r\nfuture. His arm was a bit ripped up too, but \nhe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could live with \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             Luckily for him, the communi=\r\ncations boxes on \nthese \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pods were nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible. =\r\nHe would need it to talk to the other \nbots. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; First though was \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Rodimus and Hydra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             &quot;Rodimus Prime,&quot; h=\r\ne started, with \ndisgust, &quot;and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one known as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydra.
