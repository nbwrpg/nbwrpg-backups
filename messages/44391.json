Well, actually the purpose of the sub is\n&gt; just because we don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll need in the\n&gt; future, Altough it will be an edge in minig uderwter\n&gt; Energon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rhesus: Not interly true. I think my readouts did\n&gt; suggest there was a base somewhere out at sea. It\n&gt; would be nice to either make allies or scout out the\n&gt; compition.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: The point was you&#39;d be sharing the same seat as\n&gt; your girlfriend (and without her pants she&#39;d take up a\n&gt; little less space). And what Mustex doesn&#39;t know is\n&gt; that I&#39;m considering using this as a major part in an\n&gt; attack strategy that would annialate the Iron Fist\n&gt; (considering mind you I still have to work some major\n&gt; bugs out).\n&gt; \n&gt; --- wingedwarrior41@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Thunderstorm: Uuhh...
