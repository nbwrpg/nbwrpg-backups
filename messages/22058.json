But that was the way she had always \nthought.\n\nBut then her eyes turned to Prowl just as some idea poped into his head, \nreading or more like FEELING the words with which to speak before they \nemerged out of his mouth.\nForgetting about the heavy wings at her back.\nThough, watching and feeling in wonder as she watched the results of that \none word.\nIt was a battle mode!!\nOnly with a new command and new results!!\nIron Raptor watched as armor split to be replaced by another coat of it, \nonly silver and by the sense of it...far more stronger.\nIt even went beyond the limits of Transmetal 2s!\nWow!\n\nBut once the transformation was through and the newly armored Prowl stood \nbetween her and the new visitor her mind had only one thing to think of at \nthat moment, and her thoughts were directed right towards Prowl.**\n\n&lt; Oh no you don&#39;t! I can protect myself! What sort of weakling do you think \nI am?!&gt;\n\n* And with that she stepped towards the new bot, thanking tha Matrix above \nthat her hair covered her, still, naked form. But not for long.\nBasically the same thing had happened to Prowl as had happened to her, they \nhad both fused and her scanners indicated that she was now...part snow owl. \nThat was where the wings had come from.\nSo, not that Prowl and herself were fused physically and mentally, sharing \neverything, then the only conclusion was that she would have something \ntowards a similar battle mode...and perhaps the same baqttle activation \ncode.\n\nIron Raptor stood ready, her crystal blue eyes fixed on the new bot, knowing \nfor a fact that he had no chance against just one of them.\nBut there was also something in the back of her mind, something that was \ntrying to get out. A thought suddenly entering her mind.\nWhat had really happened about that nightmarish beast mode? Had it been \nwiped out completely? Or simply deactivated?\nIron Raptor focused on that tingling in the back of her mind, suddenly \nseeing something that almost made her jump back.\nIt was there! It was still there! She could see it in her mind.\nOn all fours, acidic saliva dripping from it&#39;s bared fangs as it hunched its \nsoulder. Black exo-armor covering it&#39;s body, shining in some inner light. \nEyes trained forward...almost as it just like...hers....\nIron Raptors eyes grew big; it was...under controle? No! Waiting...waiting \nto break free? No...ready to pounce? Yes! Ready for action! \nJust...like...HER! It was listening! Actually listening!\nThe image in her mind then pawed the black ground...suddenly \nfeeling...seeing it&#39;s toughts!\nBlood, carnage...death! Mutilation!!\nThat&#39;s all she could feel from it!\nNo...it wasn&#39;t really under controle...just not wanting to fight right now.\nBut Iron Raptor then shook her head a bit, suddenly knowing that it wanted. \nFor her to transform and at least release a bit of it, to fight.\nWell, the first request she could do!\n\nIron Raptor then stepped in front of Prowl, the wind picking up and \nfluttering her hair a little, but not enough to show anything.\nShe took in a deep breath, closing her optics for a moment and finding her \nstill point, all going dark around her other then the wind and the sound of \nher own sparkbeat. Concintrating on that beat she opened her eyes, gaze \nstraight.*\n\n&quot; Iron Raptor, ULATRMETAL!!&quot;\n\n* With that she moved to her toes and whirled in a full circle, her mine and \nthus her eyes seeing nothing but blackness at first but then a light \nsurrounding her.\nHer hair seeming to sparkle as it flowed around her as she moved, her wings \nstretching wide before suddenly seeming to bust out as small sparkling \nsnow-flakes.\nFrom the center of her back then seemed to sprout out of her flesh two \npieces of fluid black armor, so dark that even the light seemed to be drawn \ninto them.\nThose two pieces appeared just under her arms and stretched to her waist as \nIron Raptor lifted her arms over her head, snapping her head towards her \nupraised hands as the pieces then wrapped and molded themselves around her \nchest, slamming together at the center of her torso.\nThen, just as suddenly as before, two pieces of armor sprouted from the \nsmall of her back this time, coming around to mold themselves to her pelvice \nand thighs. Slamming together with a metallic ring at her groin and front \nthighs.\nSame with her lower legs, another metallic ring sent clear through the \ndarkness as, they too, came together.\nIron Raptor finally lowered her arms, her eyes closed as her head became \nstraight, armor also covering her arms up to her wrists, ending in a point \nabove her hand.\nSuddenly two large shoulder-plates appeared begind her, slamming down on her \nsoulders, the tips reaching even toller then her head. Two large diamond \nshaped rubies in the center of each.\nFrom there a line of spiked armor as thin as a belt wrapped around her \nwaist, a large piece of armor suddenlu developing and closing the betl as it \nfell over her groin area.\nIron Raptor then opened her eyes as, in a flash of red, a large and long \ncape fell down towards her heals from the back of each shoulder-plate. Armor \nthen coming from the back of her heals and extending down, covering her feet \nand ending in long sharp, silver raptor claws. The armor so long what it \nlooked as if she stood on her tip-toes, yet only raising her height a few \ninches. Only looking like a pair of TMed raptor feet.\n\nIron Raptors mind then suddenly cleared in a flash, the blue morning sky \ncoming into view, a flock of large crows liting into the air as her eyes \nthen turned on the new bot, Shadow.\nGazing towards him in her new armor, her body looking as if more like a \nknight then Prowl. ( for anyone who&#39;s seen the anime Escaflowne, her armor \nis a bit like that. hehehe. If you don&#39;t know what Escaflowne is then just \nfo to Ask Jeeves and type in Where can I find pictures of Escaflowne, and \njust look around on the sides that come up. The pica are really cool!)\nBut she stood squarly, her body looking muck more bulkyier then before, but \nher head remained the same. Silver hair still falling loose from her head \nbut now behind her back.\nHer face calm as she stood beside Prowl, now the same size as him.\n\nIron Raptor  looked at Shadow, stepping towards him, the sound of gears \nmoving and hydrolics working sounding out.*\n\n&quot; Pay no attention to him.... As commander of the Maximals, I ask who you \nare any why you threaten us so?&quot;\n\n\n\nI will post IRs weapons as I use her more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
