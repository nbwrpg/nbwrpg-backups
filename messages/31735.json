He follows up by sending three \n&gt; more \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   lightning blasts at Mantle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Divebomb transforms, using his heightened agility to dodge \n&gt; straight \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   up many of the shots heading at him. Two of the shots smash \n&gt; into \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   his metallic wings, leaving charred marks, and almost knocking \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   him from the sky. His rocket boosters send him straight up at \n&gt; an \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   increasing speed, away from the near battle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Rampage is so angry; consequently, he has lost &quot;it&quot;. As one of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   laser blasts hits him, he dives to the ground, dodging the \n&gt; missiles \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   and the rest of the shots. He transforms into tiger mode as he \n&gt; hits \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   the ground. Immediately, he begins firing as much as he can, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   pumping out continues rounds from his four leg mounted machine \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   guns at Astral, and the bots around him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   On 2 Apr 2001, at 19:44, Jen D. wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; (ooc: I&#39;m not good at battles, so sorry if this is \n&gt; confusing :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Cyndro&#39;s scanners detected weaponfire outside the Element, \n&gt; and quickly made \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; a scan to find out who the attackers were. Soon he knew the \n&gt; location and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; weaponry of every Decepticon in the area.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &quot;You might wanna go out there and fight them, Rubble, we&#39;re \n&gt; under attack.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; he says through a speaker to Rubble, who thanks him and runs \n&gt; out of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; base. Cyndro reroutes more power to the shields, and then \n&gt; activates the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; defences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; The round plate on top of the Element flashed several times, \n&gt; and then a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; deafening screech was emmited over all comm frequencees other \n&gt; than the ones \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; that the Maximals were using. After a few seconds, the \n&gt; screech shut off, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; a jamming signal was sent out to disable any communications \n&gt; that the enemies \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; might have. During the screech, most of the weapons on the \n&gt; Element fired at \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; the hopefully distracted bots, sending four EMP blasts, one \n&gt; missile, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; five plasma shots at each one, other than the ones that were \n&gt; shielded by the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Cybertronian Fire (I think FireBlade is the only one \n&gt; shielded :).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Mantle spun around when all the enemies arrived, and was \n&gt; immediately ready \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; for battle. He flew into the air and stretched out both arms. \n&gt; A missile flew \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; out of each arm, both of them mentally guided by Mantle to \n&gt; hit \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Rippersnapper. Out of the corner of his eyes, Mantle could \n&gt; see Aqua firing \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; his spear gun at Flesh Ripper, the same bot that he had tried \n&gt; to get during \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; the last battle. Near him, Cinder was already firing at \n&gt; Rippersnapper. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Mantle knew that Cinder wanted to impress Prowl, but he hoped \n&gt; that she \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; wouldn&#39;t do stupid things to show off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &quot;Allright, guys, we&#39;ll fight like this for a while, and then \n&gt; we&#39;ll form \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Element and chase these guys out of here!&quot; he said to his \n&gt; team over the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; commlink, watching Rubble emerge from the Element with his \n&gt; missile launcher \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; and fire two missiles at Rampage. Mist flew by above him, \n&gt; firing three \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; charges down at Autofire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at \n&gt; http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
