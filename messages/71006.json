The sweeps above continue to fly around, their\nprobing =\r\nbeams watching the Maximals and Autobots as they move around.\n\nAnd then Hyd=\r\nras spoke on the radio . . .\n\n&gt; opening his comlink to all Predacons and De=\r\ncepticons&#39;s channels\n&gt; =93EXECUTE THEM ALLL!!!!!=94\n\nAs Hydras and Tuscon o=\r\nnce again clashed, the Predacons eagerly reopen\nthe violence of the battle,=\r\n unleashing the full force of their\nfirepower on the Maximals! Explosions r=\r\nocked the ground as sadly each\nof the Maximals were out numbered, several t=\r\no one!\n\nOne of Kup=92s blasts clips Phobia=92s wing, =93BLAST YOU!=94 she s=\r\ncreams out\nin pain as her wing tip smoked from the attack. She slowly circl=\r\ned in\nthe air, her flight not quite as graceful as it once was.\n\n=93You=92r=\r\ne going to pay for that!=94 The crimson queen of fear said as an\nominous cl=\r\nick marked the sound of her autoguns engaging. With a thrust\nof force she b=\r\negan to open fire on Kup sending a rattling train of\nbullets in his directi=\r\non!\n\nAt the same time Talon attempted to race towards Tuscon, however\nSkysh=\r\nadow, the leader of the Fuzors stepped in the way, his weapon\ncocked and re=\r\nady to fire, =93Where do you think you=92re going?=94 he said\nas he sneered=\r\n at Talon, trying to kick and send the Maximal stumbling\nback!\n\nStraight Sh=\r\not and Nightshift had both shuffled their way over to\nTuscon, but now in ad=\r\ndition to facing Hydras, they also faced those\nwith him: Insecticon, Brutic=\r\nus-X, Iguanus, and also Inferno. In reply\nto Hydras order to execute the Ma=\r\nximals, their optics had brightened\nas they brought their weapons to bear a=\r\nnd powered them up.\n\n=93This is going to be fun!=94 Insecticon said as he c=\r\nackled.\n\n=93Quit your yackin=92 till the job=92s done.=94 Iguanus said as h=\r\ne aimed his\nweapon, and like the rest opened fire!\n\nMeanwhile at the Black =\r\ntower!\n\nInside the walls the spider like Predacons continued their chase, t=\r\nhe\nominous sounds of their metal legs hitting the walls creating a rapid\nfi=\r\nre clicking sound as they pursued Rat Trap and Windlord. Four of\nthem came =\r\nout of the shadows their bright multifaceted optics seemed\nalmost hungry as=\r\n they moved.\n\nThe chase took them over pipes and under a bit of duct work, =\r\npast a\nbulk head and down a long passage way deeper and farther inside the\n=\r\nwall. As they ran they could see the grillwork of small vents that\ngazed ou=\r\nt into other rooms. Interestingly, one of them, as they\napproached it appea=\r\nred to be lit!\n\nOutside the Ark!\n\nRodimus nodded as they all moved out of s=\r\night of the Ark and moved\nover under the cover of several large rocks and t=\r\nrees. As he walked he\ngot a call from Perceptor . . .\n\n&gt; &quot;I have an idea to=\r\n let our friends escape BlackFortress area... and\n&gt; PErhaps reboot Nightlig=\r\nht, alltough i dont know how much of her\n&gt; former self is retained&quot; said Pe=\r\nrceptor to Rodimus in a heavely\n&gt; encripted message&quot;But we have to let Tucs=\r\non know, what Legacy&#39;s\n&gt; sittuation really is and this has been an unfortun=\r\nate\n&gt; misunderstanding... He&#39;s loyal to us... so far I watched... &quot;\n\nRodimu=\r\ns nodded as he looked up at Uproar and Quickstride. =93It would\nseem that P=\r\nerceptor has vouched for Legacy. He said he has been loyal\nall this time.=\r\n=94\n\nHe took a moment to glance around, putting Percpeptor on hold for a\nfe=\r\nw moments prepared his plan.\n\n=93This mission is going to be dangerous.=94 =\r\nHe said to Leo, Wing Caliber,\nRamulus, Uproar and Quickstride. As Rodimus s=\r\npoke, he kept his voice\nvery low, almost as if even here he was not sure if=\r\n they could be seen\nor over heard. He carefully held up a small device. =93=\r\nBut this is what\nI think will get us in.=94\n\n=93A Spark scrambler?=94 Ramul=\r\nus said. =93Where did you get that?=94\n\nRodimus smiled grimly, =93This was =\r\nthe one that Perceptor had given me a\nwhile back. I had almost forgotten th=\r\nat I had it.=94 He glanced around\nfor a second, and then continued. =93I be=\r\nlieve I can modify this thing\nto allow us to get past the shield.=94\n\nLeo I=\r\nI just looked at Rodimus, not sure what to make of what he was\nsaying, but =\r\nhe was willing to listen.\n\n=93What do you mean we can get in with that?=94 =\r\nWing Caliber said,\nobviously mistrustful. =93It scrambles spark signatures =\r\nnot force\nfields.=94\n\nRodimus nodded grimly, =93Yes, but I believe that the=\r\n shield is still\nset to recognize certain spark signatures, it is just bein=\r\ng held in\nover ride mode right now.=94 Rodimus pulled out one more device, =\r\na small\npower converter. =93I believe I can disrupt the shield in a small\nl=\r\nocalized area, to create a doorway that would allow us to enter.=94\n\nLeo II=\r\n=92s optics brightened in recognition, =93I see. You can play with\nthe shie=\r\nld=92s spark recognition parameters.=94 He smiled ruefully, =93It\nwouldn=92=\r\nt bring down the whole shield, but it would allow us to run\nthrough before =\r\nit closed on us again.=94\n\nWing Caliber nodded as well, =93You do know the =\r\nshield will adjust to it\nafter that.=94\n\nRodimus nodded, =93Yes, but if thi=\r\ns works as I plan, it will only have\nto work once.=94\n\nWing Caliber and Leo=\r\n II nodded in agreement.\n\nMeanwhile inside the Ark itself\n\nPerceptor spoke =\r\ninto his radio . . .\n\n&gt; I need confirmation for my next step, I know how to=\r\n create enough\n&gt; havoc to Let Tucson and to others Scape but I need your pe=\r\nrmission.&quot;\n\nThere was a short pause, and then Rodimus&#39; voice answered, =93O=\r\nf course\nPerceptor. What=92s your plan?=94\n\nMeanwhile little Elita, as she =\r\nwondered through the base picked up a\nbit of noise and the sound of a voice=\r\n . . . a voice that was definitly\nnot Rodimus, or even anyone that she reco=\r\ngnized.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n(TAG)\n\n"}}
