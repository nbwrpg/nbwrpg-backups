She then looked at Megatron.  Her nose \nstill twitched and gave her that edgy feeling.  She tunred to \nPanzertron.  &quot;An allience would be mutually beneficail.  We would \nboth profit from it. When we win the beast wars, the rewards will be \ngreat for both teams. I say let&#39;s join forces and unite to create the \nmost power force on this planet.  We would be unstoppable.&quot;\nShe turned to Megatron.
