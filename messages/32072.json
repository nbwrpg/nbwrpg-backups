NO!&gt; She was trying to reach him with her mind, starting off \ntowards him to try and get between his teeth and Iris.\n&lt; Stop! Stop!&gt;\nWhy couldn&#39;t he listen?!\nShe was at a full run, but even that couldn&#39;t save her friend from the \nmonster that was moving towards her. IR already knew too late that she \nwouldn&#39;t reach her in time.\nBut maybe she could stop Prowl another way, with the time.\nLinking with his she imagined a very high pitched sound, so high that it \nmade her internal systems rattle, hoping that it was enough to destract him \nenough to slow him down.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
