I need him for two of my stories.\n&gt; Soulstice, are Atma Pseudo and Technosis going to fight too? And it\n&gt; mght have been Jericho, but not Gangrel. And I don&#39;t think they would\n&gt; have Jericho do it, because he&#39;s too popular as a face. Test is kinda\n&gt; blond, so it was probably him. He did it cause he thought he would\n&gt; take Austin&#39;s place in the title match, not Big Show.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois could not believe this. Some of the bots had gone down in\n&gt; pain, but the more powerful ones were destroying it with evil. It was\n&gt; amazing. He noticed the main one. The one whom the others tried to\n&gt; protect(Deemos). He needed to make a direct link with him, and that\n&gt; would mean physical contact. Than he saw Child come, and go into\n&gt; stasis lock almost immediatly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Child! Not again!&quot; He commed to the base: &quot;Windrazor, Eagel Eye,\n&gt; Afterburner! We need back up! At the end of the main tunnel we&#39;re in\n&gt; a battle! Child is down!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; This distraction made the odds low to Vulois. The main boss was\n&gt; powering up an ultimate weapon. But he had to try. If he died in the\n&gt; process, Child would lead. He had heard me speak of Battera and\n&gt; Cybershark, and he would contact them and inform them. But it looked\n&gt; like peace is finally shattered. Only one last ditch attempt.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois tried as best he could to dodge most of the firepower in an\n&gt; attempt to get at Deemos.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt;\n&gt; Prebon looked sternly at Spears.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m not angry with you. You and I both know who he is, or who he\n&gt; was. I&#39;m afraid that in your anger you could let something slip and\n&gt; he will get curious. I want to make it clear that I made every\n&gt; attempt to keep the promise I made to you. He forced me to do this\n&gt; when he attacked me. I&#39;ll talk with Slayer about toning things with\n&gt; you, but just be careful around him, okay? I don&#39;t want anything\n&gt; happening to you.&quot; He kissed Spears. &quot;You may go now. I need to speak\n&gt; with Slayer.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Prebon walked back into the room and watched Slayer put it on.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Excellent. I hope you like it, because you&#39;ll be putting it to use\n&gt; right away. Your first mission is to kill Ramulus!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
