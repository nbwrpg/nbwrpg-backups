She had been there all this\n&gt; time and no one had threadened her like the wolverine had.  he was\n&gt; about to kill her.  She now felt threatened by him being in the same\n&gt; base as she.  She felt she had to leave the base and very soon, or it\n&gt; could cost her her life. She looked down and didn&#39;t want to make eye\n&gt; contact with this maximal. She had no friends on the base save\n&gt; Firearm.  She couldn&#39;t expect him to neglect his duties to just watch\n&gt; over her.  She knew her time here was about to end, one way or\n&gt; another.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
