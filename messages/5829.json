She wanted to be reprogrammed.  She hated \nbeing this emotional owl bot.  She hated her feelings and wasted emotions.  \nThis was her greatest weakness and she knew it.  She hated Lunarpine for \nshowing her this weakness inside of her.  She couldn&#39;t hate him really.  \nWhat she really hated was herself.  Lunarpine showed her just how weak she \nreally was.    She knew better than to think a wolf and an owl could have \never had a chance.  She knew that he would never give her a chance again.  \nShe had her one chance and blew it.  She realized that because of her \nweakness, she could jeopardize the others.\n\nShe thought that if her emotions were her weakness, that she was the \nweakness to the whole group.  SHe knew what she had to do.  She resolved \nthat even if she gets herself killed, she won&#39;t endanger her friends. She \nstood up and looked in the mirror over the sink in her room.  She thought of \nLunarpine.  She didn&#39;t want to jeopardize him either.  She would sneak out \nin the middle of the night, when she would go hunting, and simply not \nreturn. She had survived in the wilderness in her beast mode.  She could do \nit again.  Better to die in the wood alone than to cost her friend thier \nlives.  She made up her mind and waited in her room untill night fall.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
