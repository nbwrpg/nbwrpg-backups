Listening to one transmission, his eyes narrow. So, HotRod\n&gt; wanted Feline reprogrammed...\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Repressor,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;Go to Feline&#39;s position and have\n&gt; her report to the lab. If HotRod objects, open fire.

If\n&gt; she were\n&gt; &gt; to open her mouth and shriek right now the Alliance would be\n&gt; looking for a\n&gt; &gt; new leader. Unfortunately that also meant that Veratis would be\n&gt; looking for\n&gt; &gt; a new daughter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What exactly is it you&#39;d like to know?&quot; she asked knowing he heald\n&gt; all the\n&gt; &gt; cards.
