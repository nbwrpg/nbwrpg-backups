Oh I thank you for \nthe flattery But Megatron would have my hide tacked on the wall or \nuse it as a throw rug.  Oh no. too many here who follow Megatron. I \nadmit,I&#39;m upset over this last campain that we lost. But who expects \na leader to win every battle all the time.&quot; She did crack a smile,\n&quot;But you realy do think I could lead a successful group huh?&quot;\nThe idea made her laugh. &quot;No, no bot in there right mind would folow \nme.  For one, I don&#39;t instill fear. I draw respect, not fear.  \nSecond, I have neither the experience or skill that megatron has for \nbattle stratagy.  I&#39;m an excelent soldier, but a commander.&quot; She \nsmiled again, &quot;Well, not yet.&quot;\nShe felt a little giddy at the thought of her being a leader. She had \nnever really thought about it, but it was a fun day dream.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; PHobia peeked around the corner checking up on KitKat, she seemed \nto \n&gt; have the most leadership qualities, but didn&#39;t seem to be very \neasily \n&gt; manipulated.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree completely, &quot;no bot deserves severe punishment for a \nmistake&quot;-\n&gt;  he didn&#39;t hear the whole conversation but he&#39;d heard enough to \nlead \n&gt; into a salespitch. &quot;Even if the mistake was following the wrong \n&gt; leader.&quot; he&#39;d hoped the two bots would understand his words without \n&gt; him accually saying them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If say Oh I don&#39;t know Kit Kat here for example led a successful \n&gt; mission against a powerful enemy then The leader in question would \n&gt; lose merit.&quot; he paused looking back and forth between the \ntwo. &quot;Then \n&gt; she or whomever the case was would get the prestige, the publicity, \n&gt; it may even reach the other Predacons and unite them against a \ncommon \n&gt; foe.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; If his words didn&#39;t convince her he&#39;d have to result to the facts \nhe \n&gt; had, all he had to do was twist the facts the right way.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
