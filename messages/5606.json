Phobia knew of the great war , not being programmed as a \nhistorian, he never bothered to download all the datatracks.\n\nPhobia almost admired Pantron.

He could tell a survivor \nwhen he saw one, and right now Pantron was despeate enough to side \nwith Phobia to stay that way.\n\n&quot;Computer, set all controls to my voice, lock on to my vitals.
