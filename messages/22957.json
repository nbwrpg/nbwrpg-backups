Quickstrike&#39;s body worked over time to keep him \nalive, even for a few more minutes. He was a survivor, even if he \ndidn&#39;t know it himself. His systems took over, shutting down, \nstopping the flow of mech fluid to save energy. His systems forced \nthe fluid around his spark to stop cirulating. Portions of his brain \nshut down to reduce the risk in permant damage. And his spark slowed, \nslowing the pulse enough so it cannot be hear or detected. \n\nHis body was set on beyond stasis lock, but on the border of death. \nHis body kept him alive, just on what it could manage. On the \noutside, he was dead.\n\n\n"}}
