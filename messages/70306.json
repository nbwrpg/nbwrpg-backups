They were corrupted twisted looking things, resembling\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsomething like earth insects, but oddly alien at the same time. They\n&gt; &gt; we=\r\nre all a brownish black, although with glints of a strange metallic\n&gt; &gt; sil=\r\nver here and there. They were each about as large as full grown\n&gt; &gt; lion, e=\r\nach creature had ten legs, six insect like &#39;walking&#39; legs, with\n&gt; &gt; barbed =\r\n&#39;knees&#39; that ended with short claws extending from a large and\n&gt; &gt; powerful=\r\nly built thorax. And like  a praying mantis they had an\n&gt; &gt; extended thorax=\r\n, a chest like construct from which four others legs\n&gt; &gt; were attached that=\r\n looked larger and more powerful. Each of these legs\n&gt; &gt; was barbed with ho=\r\noks along the sides, and with forelegs that ended in\n&gt; &gt; long sharp blades!=\r\n The abdomen of each creature had a long flexible\n&gt; &gt; stinger, which like a=\r\n scorpion was poised for striking. They head was\n&gt; &gt; small with two large e=\r\nyes and several smaller ones. However what may\n&gt; &gt; be of more interest is t=\r\nhat instead of the chitinous shell of your\n&gt; &gt; typical creature, their &#39;she=\r\nlls&#39; were composed of a strange metallic\n&gt; &gt; substance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Intruders=\r\n.&quot; they hissed in unison, a strange buzzing noise\n&gt; &gt; accompanying their mo=\r\nvements as they quickly moved forward. &quot;They must\n&gt; &gt; be brought to the mis=\r\ntress!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Here is a question before we go too fa=\r\nr in:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the past there have been instances where folks have been =\r\nignoring\n&gt; &gt; attacks from others.
