So, Megatron, you think \nyou&#39;ve won? Ramhorn thinks to himself as he hears the transmission.\n\nRamhorn walks calmy to the bomb, picking it up and throwing it through one of \nthe crackes in the wall, throwing a charge at it. In a second, there is a \ngiant boom as both bombs harmlessley explode in the forest.\n\nRamhorn taps his comm-link, setting it on all Maximal and Predacon \nfrequencees as he heads to the Ark&#39;s bridge.\n\n&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; he says into his comm, remembering something he had \nheard somewhere before, &quot;The bomb has left the building. Thank Smokescreen \nfor making me patrol the Ark,&quot; he continues walking, taking out his \nheavy-fire rifle, &quot;And may I remind you, Megatron, that without the Ark, \nCybertron wouldn&#39;t be here right now. I have all the confidence in Autobot \nvictory once the Decepticon headquarters at the time is destroyed. Either \nway, Megatron, you LOSE!&quot; he puts the emphasis on his last word, reaching the \nbridge as he says it and immediately opening fire on Megatron with his rifle.\n\n"}}
