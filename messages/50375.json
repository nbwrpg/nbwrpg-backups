Besides they&#39;re not asking us to\n&gt; &gt; totally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; give up being a Maximal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hawk:  Very well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Back in the real world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Owlhawk:  Very well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar turned to Katya and nodded.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar: I will go and warn Rodimus of the\n&gt; &gt; outcome of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this trial.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He walks away, making the ground tremble\n&gt; &gt; slightly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with every step.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: He sees true in your potential. You are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strong. However, being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a Clansman... err... Clansbot in your case, that\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more than \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; techniques. It is a lot of training, and\n&gt; &gt; probably a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; major change of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minds. We Clans value zellbringen, single\n&gt; &gt; combat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even in a melee, we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tend to engage no more than one enemy at the\n&gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, honor is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above everything else in every aspect of our\n&gt; &gt; life...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except maybe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; politics, but that is easily answered through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combat.
