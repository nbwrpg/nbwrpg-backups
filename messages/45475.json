One, I&#39;m going to keep \nall of the trippa, bropo, and tropo factions together, because you \nnever post, and I haven&#39;t heard anything about them, ever. (before \nnow, though i admit, i might have missed a post concerning them, if \nthere was one) Two, Cyber city just suddenly appears? I know you \nposted about it being started or something, but i haven&#39;t seen any \nposts of them working, or of it being completed IC (not OOC, that \ndoesn&#39;t count). Three, there was no attack. (as Azure suggested in \nhis reply to this post).\n\nzzZzZZZZzzz It&#39;s much too late to be posting, oh well. =&#92;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Tankor &lt;lordofdarkness11001@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; hi . rauq for the bases the trippa are at  minsk, belarus. tropo -  \nolso, norway. bropo- copperhagen, sweeden.  the trippa,bropo, and \ntropo are on the char page as one faction fix it please. oh yeah \ncyber city is completed finally!!!! they had a few problems like the \nbropo/tropo attack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cybers Will Rule.
