So please bare with me if there are any crazy symbols :)\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n--------------\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; VICE GRIP listened over to the communic=\r\nation, pausing, &quot;What do we know\n&gt; &gt; about this..  Leo Prime, I believe he =\r\nidentiifed himself as?  What are his\n&gt; &gt; capabilities?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the very=\r\n least, they already had more to go on than they had previously -\n&gt; &gt; they =\r\nknew the name of the Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHADOW paused for a moment, =\r\nhis optics thoughtful. &quot;We know something of him.&quot; He said carefully. &quot;Not =\r\nnot as much as I would like. He is the spark &#39;child&#39; of Lio Convoy, who you=\r\n may know LIO CONVOY as one of the Maximals generals before the great peace=\r\n accord set in?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He shook his head slightly, &quot;No one knows who the mo=\r\nther is, some think This Leo . . . um. . . Jr  for want of a better term,  =\r\nis a clone of his &#39;father&#39;.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHADOW&#39;s optics brightened as another =\r\nmemory came to him. &quot;If he is he, then that means that Wing Caliber and San=\r\nton are not far away either. There is a rumor they they can become Magnabos=\r\ns, although I have not actually seen that.&quot; \n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n\nDINOBOT g=\r\nrunted, &quot;A battle with a combiner of the old style would be a worthy advers=\r\nary.  But it would not be one to be taken lightly.  I would rather not do s=\r\no, better to separate the components and take them apart at our leisuire to=\r\n take the technology for our own, since TRIPREDACUS adn the council have be=\r\nen so loathe to expand it.&quot;\n\nFocusing on what SKY SHADOW was saying, noddin=\r\ng further, &quot;A lineage of a PRIME itself and one of the most powerful MAXIMA=\r\nL field generals ever.  Direct conflict would be..  Challenging, and many o=\r\nf our normal techniques and tactics he would be aware of.  WHile I would en=\r\njoy little more than testing our prowess agaisnt him, success would be risk=\r\ny even under optimal conditions, for even the MAXIMALS do not name their Pr=\r\nimes lightly.  We would be better continuing with our plans when he has dep=\r\narted from this planet.&quot;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHADOW turned to DINOBOT, &quot;I w=\r\nould not want to encroach upon Hydras&#39; perrogative.&quot; He said in that same c=\r\nareful manner of his, sounding like the ever so loyal servant of HYDRAS. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;But this is as big as this sounds.&quot; SKYSHGADOW said, talking about the=\r\n conversation HYDRAS and LEO were having, &quot;Then it is likely most of us wil=\r\nl need to go, with a skeleton crew left here, perhaps I and my fuzors.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nVICE GRIP nodded, &quot;A battel with a PRIME would be dangerous, especi=\r\nally as one that could have backup from the ARK and any other forces he mig=\r\nht have with him.  We would be wide to avoid direct conflict unless we coul=\r\nd isolate and ambush him from superior forces.  Avoiding conflict for now i=\r\ns to our benefit until we better understand the situation.&quot;\n\n&lt;OLD - CRYOTEK=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a playful smile and a raised optic ridge, &quot;And tell me, wh=\r\nich assets are you more comfortable in sharing?&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n=\r\n\nShe grinned, &quot;Why, if you can&#39;t guess, then I&#39;d have to say your optics ar=\r\ne focusing on the wrong point of plating.&quot;\n\n&lt;OLD - TARANTALUS&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;BAH!&quot; =\r\nTARANTULUS said over their encrypted transmission. &quot;Hydras is so predictabl=\r\ne.&quot; He words dimsive of Hydras&#39; ability. &quot;Since Megatron and Galvatron *ahe=\r\nm* shall we say, joined forces, what has resulted has been lack luster to s=\r\nay the least.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a pause, &quot;No.&quot; He said finally. &quot;Keep a watch=\r\n on Cryotek. He has an agenda, and I want to know what it is. It may have s=\r\nomething to do with what we are facing, or could be something different ent=\r\nirely.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nA quiet thought from BLACKARACHNIA was sent back along t=\r\nhe mental link, &lt;Have you considered merely offering to join with him?  You=\r\n have established facilities here separate from Hydras and a reputation in =\r\nthe underground.  I am sure he would be willing to..  Listen if you made an=\r\n offer and made it believable.&gt;\n\n\n"}}
