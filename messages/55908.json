As for your presence at this strategy\nmeeting, you&#39;re here to help me prepare the assault. However, I&#39;ll\nhave a special assignment... A newcomer, is it? Where is he now?\n\nHe turned to Synergy.\n\nTyrael: Excuse him. He&#39;s grumpy but he&#39;s a top notch fighter and a\nvaluable officer too.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kaiser/*******::\n&gt;        He slowly turns around in his seat at the tactical station\nand looks \n&gt; at Major Tyrael very carefully.  &quot;Major, I have two questions:\nFirst, who \n&gt; exactly says &#39;Beat them while they&#39;re hot&#39;?  I&#39;ve heard of &#39;striking\nwhile \n&gt; the iron is hot&#39; or &#39;beat them while they&#39;re down&#39; but never &#39;beat\nthem while \n&gt; they&#39;re hot&#39;.  Because frankly that just doesn&#39;t make any sense.&quot; \nHe takes a \n&gt; deep breath before beginning again.  &quot;Secondly, why exactly are you\nplanning \n&gt; the strategy.  HELLO, military strategist.  That is what they\nbrought me out \n&gt; of retirement for.  If you&#39;d like me to be doing something else then\nby all \n&gt; means reassign me, but right now I&#39;ve got nothing to do except sit\nhere and \n&gt; stare at the tactical console.  Oh yeah, that reminds me we have\ncompany \n&gt; incoming at a high rate of speed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        The unknown bot finally stopped circling the mountain and\nflew in a \n&gt; straight line toward the nearest base, in this case the Tripred&#39;s. \nHe stops \n&gt; just outside the defensive perimeter and lands.\n\n\n"}}
