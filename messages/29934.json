And I didn&#39;t mean to \nsend that note out publicly. It was supposed to be just for him only. I \ndidn&#39;t know that the address was for the NBW O.K., so lay off, NOW!\nIf you don&#39;t like my posts, too bad. I&#39;m playing by your rules, so there is \nno reason the complain about what i wrote. If i wanted, i could have done \nsomething worse, but i didn&#39;t beacue you all asked me not to do those sorts \nof things when i first came in.\nSo, if you don&#39;t like mine and Meg&#39;s ideas, i don&#39;t care. DON&#39;T read them if \nyou don&#39;t like them. I did nothing wrong to anyone, i didn&#39;t use bad \nlanguage and i didn&#39;t do anything that would be considered wrong. These are \nrobots for one, they have NO breasts or anything. how could this be real \nanyway? I&#39;ve seen some of the stuff you guys write and it&#39;s pretty gross \ntoo, so what the @#$$ are you guys complaining about? I didn&#39;t raise \ncomplaints about any of that!\nTwo, it&#39;s called comic relief. Have you ever heard of humour?\nSo, i&#39;ve had enough of your pointless whining. If you want to take this up, \ndo it in private e-mail. My addy is:                        \nbeastwarsaddress@...\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;     As much as I enjoy watching pointless arguments, this could drive \n&gt;another\n&gt;wedge between people in the group.  We don&#39;t need that.  Alten, as amusing \n&gt;as\n&gt;the post was, it went beyond the bounds of good taste.  From an objective\n&gt;perspective, Yan probably could have been less harsh but his point was \n&gt;valid.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
