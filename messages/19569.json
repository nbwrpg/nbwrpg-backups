It was a lie, of course. He wasn&#39;t thankful \nat all. As soon as he got the neccessary information, he&#39;d kill \nher, &quot;But I think I have been out a long time. Do you have any \ninformation about this planet? Anything at all?&quot;\n\nHe hated acting like a friendly bot, but he was good at acting. As \nlong as he got to kill Zyber in the end, it was allright with him.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; * Zyber shifted but she wasn&#39;t asleep, her eyes pricked as she \nsuddenly \n&gt; heard footsteps.\n&gt; She opened one eye and found herseld looking at Blaster(DeathScyth) \nfrom \n&gt; across the fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zyber raised her head and shook herself a bit, her coat dry and \nrather \n&gt; fluffy from the snow.\n&gt; She yawned a bit and then turned her attention towards Blaster, \nsurprised \n&gt; that he was well enough to walk now.\n&gt; She smiled*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Better now are we?
