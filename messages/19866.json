But it was all so sudden and almost scared the slag out \nof her.\n&gt; Here she was now, standing upright in this new mode but what was \nshe...this \n&gt; was some sort of creature which she had never seen before.\n&gt; But as she CR room doors opened she looked at her reflection in the \nshiny \n&gt; surface, and jumped back in surprise. What she had seen was the \nface of a \n&gt; nightmare, something out of a horror film thought up in a sick \nbot&#39;s \n&gt; imagination!\n&gt; She stepped back from the doors, her voice barely a whisper.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m a monster....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And she was, something that could rip apart a bot in seconds and \nstill \n&gt; feel no wavering about the action.\n&gt; She didn&#39;t even know if she could ever accept her name again, hear \nit from \n&gt; others mouths...knowing that she was this.\n&gt; She looked down at her claws again, finding them so alien she \nthought that \n&gt; she could be looking through something elses eyes, something bent \non \n&gt; killing.\n&gt; But even if she accepted this form, she couldn&#39;t go back into the \nCR \n&gt; room...where her hightened senses relayed that Tavatron was in \nthere...and \n&gt; Dinobot had regained a bit of conciousness.\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t let them see her like this, like a monster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her breathing was iragular and she forgot about the throbing pain \nin her \n&gt; shoulder, wondering just if her activation mode would work.\n&gt; Her voice again quiet.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Iron Raptor Maximize!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Nothing happened, her muscles tensed.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Maximize!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Still nothing.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; MAXIMIZE GODDAM YOU!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * There was a faint clicking sound within her circuits this \ntime...but \n&gt; nothing other then that occured.\n&gt; Could her activation sequence have been damaged...or was this mode \n&gt; permanent?\n&gt; She remembered she had transformed the last time this had happen, \nwhen she \n&gt; had been pained.\n&gt; But this time it wasn&#39;t working in the slightest.\n&gt; Though, all she knew was that she wasn&#39;t going into that CR room \nunless she \n&gt; was physically dragged in there, and that was all she knew for \nsure.*\n\n\n"}}
