The \nlegendary Autobot, who had descided to work on a Maximal ship, made \nhis way to the bridge. {Talos}Bridge The maximal commander listened \nas the reports came in, the armory he imagined must have looked like \na battle hit it. Sighing he righted himself in his chair more fully \nturning towards the two bots that had walked onto his bridge giving a \nnod of respect to Hot Rod, it had been a relative honor to serve \nalongside one of the more key figures in their peoples histories. The \nother seemed to imply he was a criminal of some sort, he didn&#39;t \nreally care in any case. &quot;Armory is only shook up, but reports seem \nto say the thrusters are off line and quite frankly scrap. We need to \nget external sensors up and see just what kind of planet we&#39;ve \ncrashed ourselves on, once we can see where the slag we are we can go \nfrom there...&quot; Turning he regarded the &#39;criminal&#39;, &quot;I don&#39;t know what \nin the Matrix you&#39;re talking about. You appear to believe you&#39;re in \ntrouble with the law but at this point I don&#39;t give a slag what \nyou&#39;ve done. This ship is in bad shape, we have a mission to complete \nand I don&#39;t have time to assign personnel to guard you in a \nbrig.&quot;     Turning he looked the bot in the eye, &quot;Help Hot Rod get \nour sensors up and running or report yourself to the CR chambers on \ndeck two if you&#39;re too injured to help. But if you plan on sticking \naround you&#39;re gonna help us, now get to it.&quot;     Swiveling in the \nchair he regarded the com, &quot;Icedemon and Archangel get started on \nrepairs on either the computers or Comm systems. BlackKnight check \nthe ship for any more bots whose comms might be down, injuries to the \nCR chambers those not functioning, as much as I hate to say it, we&#39;ll \nworry about later, priority on the operational first.&quot; Turning back \nto look out the shattered window he silently hoped Megatron was as \nbad off as they were, if the predicons launched a pre-emptive strike \nhe doubted the ship could take a beating after the crash. Moving to \nthe computers he began investigating the status of the frigates \nweapons and defense systems, they weren&#39;t priority one at the moment \nbut he wanted at least something to re-assure the crew they weren&#39;t \nsitting blind and utterly defenseless.\n&gt; Yahoo!
