It wont be because im ignoring it, its just that there are so\nmany\n&gt; to remember.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tantrum whilred around seing Streetwis shoot at him. He got his arm up\njust\n&gt; in time for it to be blasted. A thin strip of his metal was ripped away,\n&gt; like peeling dead skin of a cut. He snarled in pain. He looked down, and\n&gt; his eyes were glowing red now. &quot;Grrrrrrr, I dont know how you managed to\n&gt; live this long Autobot, but today is your last day,&quot; he threatened,\nsoaring\n&gt; upwards, and firring from his horns, to continues streams of electricity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sinnertwin had too many targets to pick. He looked around like, and\n&gt; confused. He then noticed the Autobot First Aid, staying away from the\n&gt; fight. &quot;We hunt&quot; one head yelled, then the other snapped at it, &quot;No I\nhunt&quot;\n&gt; he shrieked. Sinnertwin leapt forward, and broke out into a run towards\n&gt; First Aid, firing three blasts of continues fire, on from his cannon, and\n&gt; the others from each mouth.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Headstrong stopped when he notice the robot he was charging leave. He\n&gt; jumped, and dug his feet into the ground, stoping himself, while tearing\nup\n&gt; fresh dirt. He spun around, 180 degrees, and saw Streetwise firing on\n&gt; Tantrum. &quot;*Snort* Didnt know there would be AUtobots here&quot; he said, as he\n&gt; fired two laser blasts at the former Autobot.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
