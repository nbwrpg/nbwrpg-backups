But as we know, appearanc=\r\nes can be\n&gt; &gt; decieving as his watchful optics carefully examining HYDRAS&#39; =\r\ntalking\n&gt; &gt; heads, a calculating glint in his other wise subservient appear=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; optics, as his right &#39;hand&#39; which was more lioke some large claw\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &#39;clacked&#39; against each other.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; DINOBOT merely nodded over =\r\nat the orders then.

After all, a girl&#39;s allowed her own fun.&quot;  NOt a direct li=\r\ne, she wouldn&#39;t have to tell Tarantalus personally - he was already listeni=\r\nng in, after all!\n&gt; \n&gt; Pouting softly, &quot;And I&#39;d want to hear the sort of.. =\r\n Propositions you might make.
