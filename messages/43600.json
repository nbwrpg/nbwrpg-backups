Or at least where it \nwas. He gets a sad look on his face.\n\nTransmutate: No friend.\n\nThen he begins to think that maybe they made friend with the Preds and \ngoes to see their base (I can&#39;t remember if he ever went to the Pred \nbase but I can asume that Ravage told him about it).\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; He shouldn&#39;t be functional, but he is. Still, he looked like a pile \nof \n&gt; junk.  When Transmutate started to go offline he saw a light.  In \nthis \n&gt; light stood many transformers.  Unicron, Optimus Prime, many others \n&gt; whose names have long been forgotten, others who have not yet gone \n&gt; online.  They were all heros from 1 generation or another.  They all \n&gt; spoke the same simultanius sentence.\n&gt; Spirits: Transmutate. Your destiny has not been fulfilled.\n&gt; He lacked the intellegence to know who they were or understand what \n&gt; they meant, but still he did.  Suddenly, he was back in his body, \nbut \n&gt; spead throughout the segmeants that had been blown apart.  He waited \n&gt; for this destiny to come, but it failed.  His spark no longer had \nthe \n&gt; power it once did, he had no power at all.  His body was useless to \n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is stormy (you wanted to incorparate the weather didn&#39;t you).  \nAll \n&gt; of a sudden a lightening bolt hits his hand.  It comes to life and \n&gt; attaches to his arm.  It continues to assemble Transmutate. He \nstarts \n&gt; talking when it&#39;s finished.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transmutate: Friend....Sil-ver-bolt.....Ra-vage.\n&gt; \n&gt; He gets a sad look.  Then he smiles stupidly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transmutate:  Find.....Flllllllly.\n&gt; \n&gt; He flys up in the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Don&#39;t start complaining.  Transmutate was in one episonde of \nthe \n&gt; series.  He befriended Ravage and Silverbolt, but he hated fighting \n&gt; so much that when they started firing at each other he jumped in the \n&gt; way of the blast and cancelled it out.  He had enormous power, but \nno \n&gt; way to control it.  When ever he attacked someone his energy just \nflew \n&gt; out in all directions. He was so badly damaged his intellegence was \n&gt; barley that of a drone (Rhinox confirmed this), and I have big plans \n&gt; for him o.k. and a way to bring up his intellegence.\n\n\n"}}
