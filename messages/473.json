She thought to herself on how she was going to pull her little plan off with Primal. Since Dinobot was dead, she could try a way, but it was almost winging it. He had discovered her before, posing as the ex-predacon. They didn&#39;t take kindly to her, and neither did Dinobot. That much. He hated clones, that she knew. But now, as Carnage said, he was dead, which meant that he wasn&#39;t there to bite her head off. Rat Trap and Optimus Primal&nbsp;was there to do that now. \n&lt;P&gt;She flew closer to the grasslands, a little skittish around the Maximal trailing behind her. She felt out of place without her forest to cover her.&nbsp;As she flew closer and closer, she looked out&nbsp;to see the ship of the Axalon. But it wasn&#39;t there. She squinted, slowing down her flight, and xoomed into the landscape with her sharp optics. She focused in to where&nbsp;the metal mass would be.\n&lt;P&gt;She haulted in mid-air. The Axalon was gone.\n&lt;P&gt;&quot;What the slagging?&quot; she uttered. She lowered down to the ground, landing on the top of a hill. She studied the area. &quot;Where...&quot;\n&lt;P&gt;She looked up, to the Fuzor, then looked behind her for Carnage. She wasn&#39;t there, either.\n&lt;P&gt;&quot;Maximal,&quot; she called to Telitoli. &quot;Go get Carnage!&quot;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
