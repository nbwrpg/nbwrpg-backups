The perfect atmosphere to start fires.\nHer attention was on Teltoli as she waited for her words to sink in, her \narms crossed as she watched Teltoli swollow hard. But it wasn&#39;t hard to see \nthat Teltoli was saddened.\nEven though this did bother her, and even though she was hurt that Teltoli \nhad left her, she had no real intention to lose her as a friend.\nAfter all, she was all she had.\nCarnage nodded at her, her expression blank.**\n&quot; Yes. But you&#39;re not dishonest, otherwise you would have lied to me. And \nyou didn&#39;t.&quot;\n** Carnage sighed.**\n&quot; No, I can&#39;t forgive you for leaving, Teltoli. That was just plain greedy \nand selfishness.&quot;\n** So she had gotten her point across, and she knew it wasn&#39;t quite right, \nbut she was glad that Teltoli was near or already crying. Finally knowing \nthat that was how she felt when Teltoli had left, only she had not cried, \ninstead it had grown into hate. But a slight one which had lifted in the \nreliefe that Teltoli had returned. However, anger had still dominated.\nHowever, now it had melted away to a slight stubberness and plain blank \nfeeling.\nCarnage looked down at Teltoli like some mother would to their child which \nhad just done something wrong.**\n&quot; You feel terrable now, don&#39;t you? Like you&#39;re at a dead end, like no one \ncares? I hope you do, I really do. Because then you know how I felt the day \nyou left me, abandoned me.&quot;\n** Carnage&#39;s blank glare softened alightly.**\n&quot; And as long as you know just how I felt then there&#39;s no need to grovle, \nthe feeling is punishment enough. But what you feel isn&#39;t even half of what \nI felt when you left, because you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be abandoned \nand left alone. Especially for long periods of time.&quot;\n** Carnage lowered her voice but it was loud enough for Teloli to hear.**\n&quot; Like your entire life.&quot;\n** She eased her weight onto the other leg, uncrossing her arms.**\n&quot; But as long as you know, then I see no reason to keep up this arguing. We \nhave to get home.&quot;\n** Carnage&#39;s expression was no longer hard, but there was no tone of \nkindness in it as she turned her snout tiwards the darkening sky, lightning \nflashing in the distance and lighting up the two carcases on her back.\nShe glanced towards Teltoli for a moment before turning around slowly \ntowards the swamps, only a few days walk from there or a two day run.\nCarnage suddenly stopped as her eyes spotted Instrat step away from the \nforest edge, narrowing her eyes at her.\nWhat did she want now?\nShe growled.**\n&quot; What do you want now?&quot;\n** Carnage stood her ground and tilted her back so that the dead weight of \nthe pigs fell to the ground, leaving her more limber and able to fight.\nShe took a step towards Instrat but made no movements that would indicate \nshe was ready for battle. She just wanted her to know that she would be a \nreal challenge this time if she decided to pull something funny.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
