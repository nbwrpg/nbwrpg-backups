He was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; poised with his only weapon, a reflective staff. The 2 small \n&gt; cannons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fired and he deflected both shots. Then his incredible senses\n&gt; &gt; &gt; detected a slight soundless shift in the metal beneath his \nfeet. \n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly turned,hurled the staff at the source,and jumped away \n&gt; from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; next 2 beams. He then stared astonished as Mustex caught the \n&gt; staff in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mid flight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:Computer,deactivate firing pattern. You&#39;ve improved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Shutup. I&#39;m here to ask for your help. I need to find the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mutants. I need Veratis to pinpoint how Stallex started as a \nbaby \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worked his way up to this age. With Veratis&#39; access to \nprotoforms\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe I can force him to create dozens of new Maximal babies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:No.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Come on. You weren&#39;t always a piece of slime. Do you \n&gt; remember\n&gt; &gt; &gt; why you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; carry that staff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:No.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Well I do, because you have to much honor to carry a \n&gt; blaster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:Go away.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Fine then! Maybe my best friend died with the other \n&gt; Carnitrons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:I always told you times change.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Finish your own quote, but warriors never do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I have no intentions of vastly using Rhesus. He&#39;s just another \n&gt; Trump\n&gt; &gt; &gt; card\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for Mustex(the first being Stallex). He&#39;ll probably just jump \nout \n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; behind a boulder and save Mustex or Stallex&#39;s circuits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
