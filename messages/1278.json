She grunts in pain and looks up at the bodies of Ramhorn and Stinkbomb, lying out cold on the ground. Teltoli pulls herself up and walks over to Stinkbomb, deciding he is the lightest, and starts to drag him across the battleground. She certainly couldn&#39;t drag a rhino!\n\nShe couldn&#39;t resist taking a parting shot at Injector with her gun, but by then she was too far away to hit and she knew it..\n\n(Attn to the creater of Stinkbomb and Ramhorn: I hope I&#39;m not moding, just trying to help! Tell me if you want to leave them there or anything...)\n\n----\n\nKit dodges the kick from Sinesis and tackles him low in the stomach, driving him to the ground. She pulls out a blade and tries to pull it up to his neck..\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
