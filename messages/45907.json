Look.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; McGowan points to White&#39;s corpse.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; McGowan: I killed her. It is working.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Virgo stared at Alba, feeling trigger happy at the moment.

Birdbot lights the \n&gt;   fuse of a bundle of dynamite and tosses it near the Chivtron base \nand \n&gt;   watches the fuse while growling. Barrymore fires at the Chivtron \nbase \n&gt;   twice.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; McGowan: Shitrons! See it with your own eyes!\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; McGowan points at Depp. Depp holds Pink in front of himself by \nher \n&gt;   arm.

McGowan grabs ahold of Alba&#39;s gun \nand \n&gt;   jerks it from her grip. Alba coughs and struggles to no avail. \n&gt;   McGowan tightens her grip. Depp spears Pink through the stomach \non \n&gt;   his kitana and holds her high in the air. McGowan snaps Alba&#39;s \nneck, \n&gt;   dropping her. Virgo looks at the Insecticons.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Virgo: Kill them....\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Virgo spoke in a faint whisper while pointing to the Chivtron \nbase\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
