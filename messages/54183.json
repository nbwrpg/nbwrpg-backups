She \ndidn&#39;t feel quite right now doing this for some strange reason.  She \njust didn&#39;t feel herself.  She didn&#39;t want to be under anybot. But \nfor some reason she felt very obligated to serve this bot whom she \nhad not even seen, Hydrus.  She looked to Perceptor, &quot;So, by the \nsounds of him, he&#39;s quite a warrior. I hope to prove myself worthy \nin battle.&quot;  She let her wolf tail swiswh behind her as she walked \nin bot mode down the hall.  She passed a door where the metal was \nquite shiney.  She glimsed her reflection and smiled. She still \nlooked good after all these eons.  Her shiney black skin, her red \noptics still looked great.  She smiled to herself.  It takes a good \nlooking bot to make a good first impression. She wasn&#39;t out to \nseduce him, she wanted him to think highly enough of her to make her \na commander under him. \n\n\n"}}
