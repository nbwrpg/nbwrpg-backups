Instead of curli=\r\nng his front legs into his chest, he stretches them out and begins his exer=\r\ncises.   A look of serenity comes over his face as his front legs work as a=\r\nrms and hands, in a graceful dance of poise and tranquility.  Slowly, his h=\r\nind legs and feet begin to move gracefully in unison with his upper body.  =\r\nAs his tail moves with his body, a gentile breeze is kicked up in it&#39;s wake=\r\n. He minds his feet and moves carefully around his new friends.  It was his=\r\n way of training for battle.  The more he moves the faster his arms and leg=\r\ns move as swift taloned hands perform the same functions as they were if he=\r\n were in robot mode.  And then the dance blossoms into an impressive displa=\r\ny of martial arts as the Silver Dragon performs a stellar spin/ revolving k=\r\nick maneuver.  He lands on his feet without a wobble in his legs or ankles.=\r\n  He turns his head to see if Mach Kick was still on his back.\n\n&quot; The reaso=\r\nn why I chose to warm up this way is because typically, no one expects a tr=\r\nansformer to fight that way in alt form.  When I first met Master Yokitron,=\r\n he asked me to do something completely out of the normal routine of combat=\r\n training.  I was an Autobot back then and he asked me to remain in vehicle=\r\n form during the first lesson.  I thought he was kidding but he wasn&#39;t. So =\r\nthen he asked me to drive a little down a road that he sanctioned for Autob=\r\not training.  I went down that road and suddenly, I found myself on two whe=\r\nels instead of four.  I was an SUV at the time and I was shocked clear out =\r\nof my suspension cables when I went up on my left front and rear tires.   T=\r\nhere was a ramp under me and I did not expect it.  But then he said that ev=\r\nen a bulky vehicle can find balance.  And if a bulky vehicle can find balan=\r\nce, so can a dragon.  This is what I&#39;m going to try and convey in the battl=\r\ne field.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Oct 6, 2011, a=\r\nt 12:27 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Tucson swings around and stares at the trio with a wise gaze.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\n It&#39;s about building strength and endurance.

He minds his =\r\nfeet and moves carefully around his new friends. &nbsp;It was his way of tr=\r\naining for battle. &nbsp;The more he moves the faster his arms and legs mov=\r\ne as swift taloned hands perform the same functions as they were if he were=\r\n in robot mode. &nbsp;And then the dance blossoms into an impressive displa=\r\ny of martial arts as the Silver Dragon performs a stellar spin/ revolving k=\r\nick maneuver. &nbsp;He lands on his feet without a wobble in his legs or an=\r\nkles. &nbsp;He turns his head to see if Mach Kick was still on his back.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; The reason why I chose to warm up this way is beca=\r\nuse typically, no one expects a transformer to fight that way in alt form. =\r\n&nbsp;When I first met Master Yokitron, he asked me to do something complet=\r\nely out of the normal routine of combat training. &nbsp;I was an Autobot ba=\r\nck then and he asked me to remain in vehicle form during the first lesson. =\r\n&nbsp;I thought he was kidding but he wasn&#39;t. So then he asked me to drive =\r\na little down a road that he sanctioned for Autobot training. &nbsp;I went =\r\ndown that road and suddenly, I found myself on two wheels instead of four. =\r\n&nbsp;I was an SUV at the time and I was shocked clear out of my suspension=\r\n cables when I went up on my left front and rear tires. &nbsp; There was a =\r\nramp under me and I did not expect it. &nbsp;But then he said that even a b=\r\nulky vehicle can find balance. &nbsp;And if a bulky vehicle can find balanc=\r\ne, so can a dragon. &nbsp;This is what I&#39;m going to try and convey in the b=\r\nattle field.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Oct 6, 2011, at 12:27 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\ndisplay:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n   =\r\n   &lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson swings around and stares at=\r\n the trio with a wise gaze.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s about building strengt=\r\nh and endurance.
