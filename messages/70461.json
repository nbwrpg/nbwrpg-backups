C&#39;mon computer, if I say s=\r\nomethn&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay! It ain&#39;t like I&#39;m gonna bug ya with a virus! Perc=\r\neptor&#39;s a pred but he&#39;s changn&#39; sides! Stupid piece of outdated hardware! W=\r\nell, at least Lord Elder said somethn&#39; ta Wheels, I don&#39;t wanna ever hear h=\r\nim try&#39;n ta put his spark on the line ever again.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\nThe computer read=\r\nily responds to Rat Trap&#39;s wishes and shuts down its\nattack sequence. The s=\r\nhield&#39;s drop and the weapons go back to stand-by\ncondition. However on Rat =\r\nTrap&#39;s console the computer continues to\nregister the fact that there is a =\r\nPredacon signature in the area\nalthough all other alarms shut down.\n\nLord e=\r\nlder looked around the command center, his stance calm and\nrelaxed. &quot;Don&#39;t =\r\nworry.&quot; he said consolingly to Rat Trap, &quot;We have lost\ntoo many already, I =\r\nam not looking to loose Tuscon so quickly.&quot;\n\nCheetor came up and stood next=\r\n to Rat Trap smacking him on the back in\na friendly gesture, &quot;You think you=\r\n got the computer under control\nnow?&quot; he said teasing the smaller Maximal a=\r\ns he smiled, &quot;You look like\nyou couldn&#39;t handle it.&quot;\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride a=\r\nnd Night Shift try to deal with Noctorro, but his prodding was getting on t=\r\nhe Autobot&#39;s nerves more than anything else.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Look, we&#39;re don&#39; the best=\r\n we can, and we really don&#39;t know what we&#39;re dealn&#39; with here, this is comp=\r\nletely alien ta all of us and you&#39;re gonna have ta show some patience.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Quickstride snorts and looks over to Noctorro.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;C&#39;mon, give us some br=\r\neathing room will ya?! Geeze!.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nNoctorro looked like he was about t=\r\no go off for a moment, his optics\nlooking a definite crimson as he locked g=\r\nazes with Quickstride.\nHowever Airhammer stepped in the middle of them and =\r\nlooked back at\nNoctorro, &quot;Maybe we can go find out. It&#39;s obvious they have =\r\nmuch work\nto do.&quot;\n\nNoctorro nodded and laughed as he rubbed the back of his=\r\n head with a\nnervous almost embarrased gesture, &quot;Sure.&quot; he said looking def=\r\ninitly\nsheepish. &quot;You&#39;re right, let&#39;s go.&quot;\n\n&quot;Airhammer looked at Quickstrid=\r\ne and Nightshift, &quot;He get&#39;s that way\nsometimes, but he means well.&quot; he said=\r\n quietly as they turned to leave\nthe room.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; Outside, Tucson Prime a=\r\ncknolwedges the readiness to come aboard.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is Tucson Prime to Lord=\r\n Elder, I&#39;m comming back to the Ark as you requested. And let&#39;s see what th=\r\ne medics can do, if they need my help I&#39;m here to give to them. Perceptor, =\r\nTalon, don&#39;t worry, you will not be losing me any time soon, I assure you. =\r\nI wonder if I can get a link up with Rodimus remotely. As an Autobot we sho=\r\nuld be able to com link with each other.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He attempts to connect with R=\r\nodimus&#39;s com link, hoping to get through to him.\n\nElder responds from the c=\r\nommand center, &quot;I will pass that on to them.\nI am sure they are working as =\r\nhard as they can.&quot; Elder said, trying\nkeep the peace, and yet trying to kee=\r\np Tuscon from jumping headlong\ninto sacrificing himself again.\n\nTuscon atte=\r\nmpts to connect with Rodimus but get&#39;s no response. It is\nas if his radio i=\r\ns offline or not responding. Perhaps it has something\nto do with the fact t=\r\nhat Rodimus is completely wrapped in the strange\nalien metal tendrils.\n\n(TA=\r\nG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
