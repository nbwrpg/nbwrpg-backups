She wasn&#39;t sure what to think.  Here was a bot \nthat she cared for deeply, in utter torment.  And what hurt her more, \nwas the fact that there was nothing she could do.  She could only \nwatch as he suffered with the pictures of some bot in his head. She \nflew downa nd transformed into bot mode and put her hand on his \nshoulder. &quot;I don&#39;t know why or how this bot is in your head or why \nyou see the images, but I shall help you. I shall be here for you.&quot; \nShe walked with him and fought off the tears welling up in her eyes.  \nIt hurt her knowing that she wouldnt be any help to him. Destiny was \nsomething that one delt with by themselves. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;           Dollen stopped, and fell down on his knees, and put his \nhead in\n&gt; his hands.\n&gt; \n&gt;            &quot;I....Don&#39;t........Know.....What&#39;s..Wrong!!!  I..I can&#39;t \nexplain\n&gt; it!!  These visions!!!!  Who is she????  WHO IS SHE?????&quot; Then, \nsuddenly,\n&gt; images went through Dollen&#39;s head.  Images.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Now, Dollen was inside his own mind.\n&gt; \n&gt;          The Silver Fox.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;The Silver Fox,&quot; He said, strangely.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;I have to find the silver fox.........I must find \nher.......It&#39;s my\n&gt; destiny.......&quot; Then, Dollen had more images.\n&gt; \n&gt;           A spider............A wolf...............A \ntyrant..........A\n&gt; fool.........A bond.....A destiny..........Faith and Trust.....\n&gt; \n&gt;           Then, Dollen said with a firm look on his face, &quot;We have \nto go\n&gt; join KitKat and the others.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
