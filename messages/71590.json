I would imagine that Tuscon is ab=\r\nout the same size as\n&gt;&gt; Optimus Primal, who is approximately 10 feet tall. =\r\nSince Maximals\n&gt;&gt; don;t size change all that much, the dragon mode should a=\r\nlso be about\n&gt;&gt; 10 feet long, with the tail maybe giving him another 3 - 5 =\r\nfeet or\n&gt;&gt; length and the wings perhaps almost the same width. he would not=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; feasibly be able to surround the Preds, especailly as far out as they\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; are spaced. He can try to circle around, but that is a big circle.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Look, below us. THAT has no right happening.

The\n&gt;&gt; Fuzors SKYSHADOW, INJECTOR and BUZZCLAW seemed to be k=\r\neeping watch\n&gt;&gt; with CYCLONUS flhing lead along with SCOURGE and several sw=\r\neeps.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; DEEPSTRYKE floats high in the air as PHOBIA and BLACK RAZOR ci=\r\nrcle\n&gt;&gt; about. as well as WASPINATOR who buzzes about angrilly as he watche=\r\nd.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; They are all flying above miles and miles and miles of burning\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n dinosaurs. Beast and reptiles of all sorts! What sorts they were it is\n&gt;&gt; =\r\ndifficult to tell, being as they are on fire as the Maximals approach.\n&gt;&gt; T=\r\nhe stench is hideous, and most of the trees and surrounding scrub is\n&gt;&gt; bur=\r\nning along with the reptiles, the preds are darting all around the\n&gt;&gt; super=\r\n large burning pyre.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; That is until TUSCON starts firing.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;O=\r\nLD Straight Shot & Talon&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As Straight Shot rides with Talon, she =\r\npicks up on Tucson&#39;s location and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from a far, realizes what is now tra=\r\nnspiring between him and Hydras! Still\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in cross bow mode, she calibrat=\r\nes her systems and weight distribution to fit\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Talon&#39;s configurations, =\r\nfor optimal results.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Hydras! Ohhh I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s gonna fa=\r\nce off with him again! He\n&gt;&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t realize that he needs help! Wait, Oh=\r\nh good, he&#39;s not alone, Rodimus\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is with him. But still, it doesn&#39;t hur=\r\nt ta lend him a hand. I better let\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Leo Prime in on this, he&#39;s probably=\r\n wondering why Tucson isn&#39;t contacting\n&gt;&gt; &gt; him, which is something he&#39;s no=\r\ntorious for doing. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; She opens her link to Leo Prime.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\n Leo Prime, it&#39;s me, Straight Shot. Talon and I are reaching Tucson&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nlocation shortly and I&#39;m sure he hasn&#39;t contacted you yet. He&#39;s with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; R=\r\nodimus and now he&#39;s facing off with Hydras. A lotta fire just got deployed\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and I&#39;m definitely sure it wasn&#39;t from Hydras. Tucson&#39;s in a really ba=\r\nd\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mood, and I think it&#39;s about ta get worse.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Thi=\r\ns is Leo. Judging from your location we are at least several hours\n&gt;&gt; from =\r\nyou, and that that is for those of us who can fly. You had better\n&gt;&gt; get Tu=\r\nscon reigned in until we can get there. Leo Prime. Out.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD - St=\r\nraight Shot, Talon & Hydras&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Much to Straight Shot&#39;s suspicion, T=\r\nucson does indeed have the look of an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; enraged predator on his draconic=\r\n face. What he wouldn&#39;t do to be able to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sink his sharp claws into Hyd=\r\nras, tearing at his armor until there was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; nothing left. Yet he holds e=\r\nnough restraint to hold back from doing so, for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the time being.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Many innocent creatures who were native to this planet have lost thei=\r\nr\n&gt;&gt; &gt; lives needlessly, no thanks to you and your reign of greed and destr=\r\nuction.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This is NOT our planet and we have NO right taking away what b=\r\nelongs here!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; That is what brings me here, Hydras! This planet deserves=\r\n freedom and I am\n&gt;&gt; &gt; here to make sure it gets it!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He exclaims=\r\n with a loud draconic roar, as smoke seeps out of his flaring\n&gt;&gt; &gt; nostrils=\r\n as do a couple of white hot flames.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; With Rodimus still on his ba=\r\nck, Tucson circles Hydras as the never ending\n&gt;&gt; &gt; coils of his long tail c=\r\nreates a ring around the enemy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus, this is also your chanc=\r\ne to take back something that was taken\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from you. No holds barred, do =\r\nwhat you feel is the right thing, and what\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you feel in your spark is r=\r\nightful to your cause. I will follow suit. We\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will fight as one, and a=\r\ns one we will serve judgement to those who deserve\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He =\r\nremains in his circling pattern, waiting for Rodimus to direct him, in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n hopes to help build his confidence as an Autobot Commander. At the same\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; time, Tucson had to learn to control his greatest weakness, his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; unc=\r\nontrollable temper which left unchecked, had the potential to turn him\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n into an extremely dangerous individual. Now that he takes on the role of a=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; powerful creature, it would prove hard to quell the fire that burns d=\r\neep\n&gt;&gt; &gt; within his spark. He hoped that this partnership would help keep t=\r\nhe\n&gt;&gt; &gt; balance between the both of them. They would need that more than ev=\r\ner if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; they have hopes of stopping Hydras for good.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Tuscon!&quot; RODIMUS imperiously said from TUSCON&#39;s back. &quot;That&#39;s alot o=\r\nf\n&gt;&gt; Predacons out there. Unless you have some back up out here that I\n&gt;&gt; d=\r\non&#39;t know about we are a long way from home.&quot; RODIMUS looked around,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;I =\r\nsee Cyclonus, have you seen Hydras yet?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; It was not fear that moved =\r\nRODIMUS in all this, but a warrior&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; caution. Even the most fearless of =\r\nwarriors had to know when the odds\n&gt;&gt; were stacked against them, and when t=\r\nhey had even a snowball&#39;s chance\n&gt;&gt; of winning a fight. As RODIMUS pulled o=\r\nut his rifle and targeted the\n&gt;&gt; Predacons, he could not help wondering if =\r\nhe fires will it get them\n&gt;&gt; all killed, and if TUSCON wanted to them to go=\r\n down in some blaze of\n&gt;&gt; glory. Even two primes cannot stand up to the ent=\r\nire Predacon forces!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; CYCLONUS and HYDRAS were by themsevles their eq=\r\nuals and at the moment\n&gt;&gt; HYDRAS was not visible, which made the situation =\r\neven more dangerous.\n&gt;&gt; And that was not counting all the other Predacons j=\r\nust waiting to blow\n&gt;&gt; them out of the air.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;What are you doing here=\r\n.&quot; CYCLONUS&#39; voice came over the comlink over\n&gt;&gt; a general frequency. &quot;We h=\r\nave no quarel with you this night.

I would imagine that Tuscon is about the same size as&lt;br&gt;Opti=\r\nmus \n  Primal, who is approximately 10 feet tall. Since Maximals&lt;br&gt;don;t s=\r\nize change \n  all that much, the dragon mode should also be about&lt;br&gt;10 fee=\r\nt long, with the \n  tail maybe giving him another 3 - 5 feet or&lt;br&gt;length a=\r\nnd the wings perhaps \n  almost the same width. he would not&lt;br&gt;feasibly be =\r\nable to surround the Preds, \n  especailly as far out as they&lt;br&gt;are spaced.=\r\n He can try to circle around, but \n  that is a big circle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nOLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot; Look, below \n  us. THAT has no right happening. H=\r\nydras has gone too far,&lt;br&gt;&gt; and it&#39;s \n  time he was put in his place!&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; With a roar of sheer rage, he \n  turns on the surrounding P=\r\nredacons releasing a&lt;br&gt;&gt; powerful stream of \n  fire, flames a bright hu=\r\ne of red, yellow and blue.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot; Now let&#39;s \n  show Hydras what =\r\nhappens when he preys on innocent \n  creatures!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nWhat stands before TUSCON is nearly ALL \n  the Predacon forces. The&lt;br&gt;Fuzo=\r\nrs SKYSHADOW, INJECTOR and BUZZCLAW seemed to \n  be keeping watch&lt;br&gt;with C=\r\nYCLONUS flhing lead along with SCOURGE and several \n  sweeps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DEEPST=\r\nRYKE floats high in the air as PHOBIA and BLACK RAZOR \n  circle&lt;br&gt;about. a=\r\ns well as WASPINATOR who buzzes about angrilly as he \n  watched.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The=\r\ny are all flying above miles and miles and miles of \n  burning&lt;br&gt;dinosaurs=\r\n. Beast and reptiles of all sorts! What sorts they were it \n  is&lt;br&gt;difficu=\r\nlt to tell, being as they are on fire as the Maximals \n  approach.&lt;br&gt;The s=\r\ntench is hideous, and most of the trees and surrounding \n  scrub is&lt;br&gt;burn=\r\ning along with the reptiles, the preds are darting all around \n  the&lt;br&gt;sup=\r\ner large burning pyre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is until TUSCON starts \n  firing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD Straight Shot &amp; Talon&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; As \n  Straight =\r\nShot rides with Talon, she picks up on Tucson&#39;s location and&lt;br&gt;&gt; \n  fro=\r\nm a far, realizes what is now transpiring between him and Hydras! \n  Still&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; in cross bow mode, she calibrates her systems and weight \n  distrib=\r\nution to fit&lt;br&gt;&gt; Talon&#39;s configurations, for optimal \n  results.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot; Hydras! Ohhh I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s gonna face off \n  with him ag=\r\nain! He&lt;br&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t realize that he needs help! Wait, Ohh good, \n  he&#39;s=\r\n not alone, Rodimus&lt;br&gt;&gt; is with him. But still, it doesn&#39;t hurt ta \n  l=\r\nend him a hand. I better let&lt;br&gt;&gt; Leo Prime in on this, he&#39;s probably \n =\r\n wondering why Tucson isn&#39;t contacting&lt;br&gt;&gt; him, which is something he&#39;s=\r\n \n  notorious for doing. &quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; She opens her link to Leo \n  Pri=\r\nme.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot; Leo Prime, it&#39;s me, Straight Shot. Talon and I are \n =\r\n reaching Tucson&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; location shortly and I&#39;m sure he hasn&#39;t contacte=\r\nd \n  you yet. He&#39;s with&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus and now he&#39;s facing off with Hydras=\r\n. A \n  lotta fire just got deployed&lt;br&gt;&gt; and I&#39;m definitely sure it wasn=\r\n&#39;t from \n  Hydras. Tucson&#39;s in a really bad&lt;br&gt;&gt; mood, and I think it&#39;s =\r\nabout ta get \n  worse.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This is Leo. Judging fro=\r\nm your location we \n  are at least several hours&lt;br&gt;from you, and that that=\r\n is for those of us who \n  can fly. You had better&lt;br&gt;get Tuscon reigned in=\r\n until we can get there. Leo \n  Prime. Out.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Straight=\r\n Shot, Talon &amp; \n  Hydras&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Much to Straight Shot&#39;s su=\r\nspicion, Tucson does \n  indeed have the look of an&lt;br&gt;&gt; enraged predator=\r\n on his draconic face. What \n  he wouldn&#39;t do to be able to&lt;br&gt;&gt; sink hi=\r\ns sharp claws into Hydras, tearing \n  at his armor until there was&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nnothing left. Yet he holds enough \n  restraint to hold back from doing so, =\r\nfor&lt;br&gt;&gt; the time \n  being.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot; Many innocent creatures wh=\r\no were native to this \n  planet have lost their&lt;br&gt;&gt; lives needlessly, n=\r\no thanks to you and your \n  reign of greed and destruction.&lt;br&gt;&gt; This is=\r\n NOT our planet and we have NO \n  right taking away what belongs here!&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; That is what brings me here, \n  Hydras! This planet deserves freedom an=\r\nd I am&lt;br&gt;&gt; here to make sure it \n  gets it!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; He exclaim=\r\ns with a loud draconic roar, as smoke \n  seeps out of his flaring&lt;br&gt;&gt; n=\r\nostrils as do a couple of white hot \n  flames.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; With Rodimus=\r\n still on his back, Tucson circles Hydras \n  as the never ending&lt;br&gt;&gt; co=\r\nils of his long tail creates a ring around the \n  enemy.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;R=\r\nodimus, this is also your chance to take back \n  something that was taken&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; from you. No holds barred, do what you feel \n  is the right thing, a=\r\nnd what&lt;br&gt;&gt; you feel in your spark is rightful to \n  your cause. I will=\r\n follow suit. We&lt;br&gt;&gt; will fight as one, and as one we \n  will serve jud=\r\ngement to those who deserve&lt;br&gt;&gt; it. &quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; He \n  remains in =\r\nhis circling pattern, waiting for Rodimus to direct him, in&lt;br&gt;&gt; \n  hope=\r\ns to help build his confidence as an Autobot Commander. At the \n  same&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; time, Tucson had to learn to control his greatest weakness, \n  his&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; uncontrollable temper which left unchecked, had the potential to \n  tur=\r\nn him&lt;br&gt;&gt; into an extremely dangerous individual. Now that he takes on =\r\n\n  the role of a&lt;br&gt;&gt; powerful creature, it would prove hard to quell th=\r\ne fire \n  that burns deep&lt;br&gt;&gt; within his spark. He hoped that this part=\r\nnership would \n  help keep the&lt;br&gt;&gt; balance between the both of them. Th=\r\ney would need that \n  more than ever if&lt;br&gt;&gt; they have hopes of stopping=\r\n Hydras for \n  good.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Tuscon!&quot; RODIMUS im=\r\nperiously said \n  from TUSCON&#39;s back. &quot;That&#39;s alot of&lt;br&gt;Predacons out ther=\r\ne. Unless you have \n  some back up out here that I&lt;br&gt;don&#39;t know about we a=\r\nre a long way from home.&quot; \n  RODIMUS looked around,&lt;br&gt;&quot;I see Cyclonus, hav=\r\ne you seen Hydras \n  yet?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was not fear that moved RODIMUS in all=\r\n this, but a \n  warrior&#39;s&lt;br&gt;caution. Even the most fearless of warriors ha=\r\nd to know when the \n  odds&lt;br&gt;were stacked against them, and when they had =\r\neven a snowball&#39;s \n  chance&lt;br&gt;of winning a fight. As RODIMUS pulled out hi=\r\ns rifle and targeted \n  the&lt;br&gt;Predacons, he could not help wondering if he=\r\n fires will it get \n  them&lt;br&gt;all killed, and if TUSCON wanted to them to g=\r\no down in some blaze \n  of&lt;br&gt;glory. Even two primes cannot stand up to the=\r\n entire Predacon \n  forces!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CYCLONUS and HYDRAS were by themsevles t=\r\nheir equals and at the \n  moment&lt;br&gt;HYDRAS was not visible, which made the =\r\nsituation even more \n  dangerous.&lt;br&gt;And that was not counting all the othe=\r\nr Predacons just waiting \n  to blow&lt;br&gt;them out of the air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;What ar=\r\ne you doing here.&quot; CYCLONUS&#39; \n  voice came over the comlink over&lt;br&gt;a gener=\r\nal frequency. &quot;We have no quarel \n  with you this night. Continue&lt;br&gt;firing=\r\n on us and we will wipe you from the \n  skies.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a wicked c=\r\nhuckle from SKYSHADOW, &quot;I don&#39;t think these \n  two&lt;br&gt;would try to take on =\r\nthe entire Predacon army.
