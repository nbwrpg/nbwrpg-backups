This was all too easy. Tavatron&#39;s ears swiveled in Dinobot&#39;s \ndirection as he appraoched her. She listened as he spoke. Could it \nbe? Was there actually concern in his voice? He really was worried \nabout her. That was kinda... nice. It felt good to have someone \nlike him watching her back. \n\nTavatron almost tripped over her own feet when when he told her what \nexactly he wanted to do. Carry her?! That was a little extreme. She \ncould run, perhaps not as fast as she usually does, but fast enough. \nShe was about to tell him that she would do fine on her own when \nsuddenly Prowl tossed the &#39;detonator&#39; to the six &#39;bot&#39;s behind them. \nAfter a few moments of confusion the device was caught, and the ruse \nwas over. Tavatron turned back to Dinobot as the Alliance moved \nforward, intent on destroying them:\n\n&quot;Alright, you can carry me! Let&#39;s just get out of here!&quot;\n\nTavatron then aknowledged the com from Iron Raptor:\n\n&quot;We&#39;re coming!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
