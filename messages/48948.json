Rage won&#39;t likely be to welcomed. Besides, the Predacons rather \nunder manned right now.\n\n-- Megatron --\n\nMegatron curses at Warhead&#39;s predicament, hoping backwards away from \nthe Maximals. As the number of Maximals converging on his location \nincreases, his frown deepens. \n\nSpotting the insolent Maximal who had hit him with a laser, Kup, he \nfires two missiles at the bot.\n\nSunhawk&#39;s laser shots scream past Megatron, one hitting him in the \nchest, another charring his arm and almost causing him to drop \nWarhead. Distracted by Sunhawks shots, Kup&#39;s laser blast hits him in \nthe side of the head, disabling his left optic, and damaging his \nright one fairly severly. Megatron spots Hot Rod aiming and firing, \nand he quickly moves Warhead&#39;s unmoving form infront of him to \nintercept the weaponfire, &quot;Grr, at least he proved useful,&quot; mutters \nMegatron.\n\nSeeing an opertunity, he leaps into the air, throwing Warhead above \nhim, then transforms into Dragon mode, catching Warhead with his \nclawed legs.\n\n\n"}}
