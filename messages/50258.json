(He turns to look at Rodimus) But\n&gt; this Owlhawk... \n&gt; he is strong. He does lack a bit of self-control,\n&gt; but stepped in the \n&gt; ways of the Clans, he would be a deadly one. Katya\n&gt; knows she is likely \n&gt; to lose, but this is more a formality.

Working \n&gt; as allies would be fine. However if you must do\n&gt; this, verywell. Go on \n&gt; Owlhawk.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Owlhawk steps out a bit with Katya. He puts his\n&gt; fists up and starts \n&gt; to move around a bit. A normal Maximal would\n&gt; probably wait for Katya \n&gt; to throw the first punch, but Owlhawk is a little\n&gt; bit different.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Owlhawk sends two jabs at Katya&#39;s face.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
