He frowns. He didn&#39;t want\nthe Maximals destroyed, though he doubted that they would be. Either\nway, though, a small token of help would improve his dealings with\nthem greatly.\n\n&quot;Alliance members,&quot; he says over the comm, &quot;The battle is at the\nMaximal base. We&#39;re going to help the Maximals out this time, so fire\non anyone firing at you unless the Maximals open fire on us. In that\ncase, we&#39;ll blow them to scrap.&quot;\n\nHe motions for the Galactors to follow him and then looks at Havoc.\n&quot;Wait here in case Wolfgang wakes up. I should be back soon.&quot;\n\nMotioning for the Galactors to follow, he walks out of the CR room,\nheading for the exit. Him and the Galactors exit the base and take\noff, the shields flickering off for them as they pass through and fly\ntoward the CF. Zardus looks behind him, checking to see if anyone was\nfollowing, as they should be.\n\n\n"}}
