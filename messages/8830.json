It&#39;d take eons to pick up the pieces. You&#39;ll need to \nfind \n&gt; one of the techbots for that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He figured that she&#39;d be disapointed for whatever reason she needed \n&gt; the hookup. he transformed back to his wolf form for the scans. \n&gt; \n&gt; (Just a thought, if the scanners could replicate transformed DNA \nthen \n&gt; in the show Air Razor wouldn&#39;t have had to wait for a compatible \n&gt; lifeform, it would have used Rhinox or Cheetor so ask someone else \nif \n&gt; this moves legal first.)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I know will sound strange, but I need to scna you while in beast \n&gt; &gt; mode.
