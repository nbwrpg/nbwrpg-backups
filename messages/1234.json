She\nhadn&#39;t managed to hide the pain in her optics as she had glared back at him,\nit was there...hidden among the shadows of her most secret of thoughts and\nmemories.\n&gt; He looked back at the sword that now lay in the dirt at her heels,\nthoughts merged and shaped in his mind as he stared at the blades of\nActivator&#39;s weapons.\n&gt; She had been right about him not lasting long in battle, but he had had no\nidea that she had suffered such a lose in the past. But even if her knew\nwould he still have done what he did? Would he still just ignore her and\ncontinue on to the battle?\n&gt; The answer was simple...no.\n&gt; Suddenly his system wavered but then faded into nothing, he dismissed it.\n&gt; Dinobot realized that he would have hung back and rested just as Tavatron\nhad said that he should, just to keep her armor from going white before her\ntime.\n&gt; He looked up at Activator&#39;s back and snarled, with one quick and smooth\nmove he picked up her sword and walked up behind her.\n&gt; Dinobot placed a gentle yet firm hand on Activator&#39;s shoulder-plate and\nheld her sword out in front of her to take, he growled but it was not at\nher...it was at himself.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I did not mean to cause you such discomfort. I am a...fool.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * That was as close to an apology as he was going to get at the moment,\nnot to mention that that wasn&#39;t the easiest thing that he had done in the\nworld.\n&gt; He then set the sword in her hand, with a sigh he was about to walk back\ntowards the Ark when his systems wavered extremely!\n&gt; Dinobot stepped back and removed his hand from Activator&#39;s shoulder, his\nsystems weren&#39;t just wavering...they were going offline!!\n&gt; His internal computer announced the systems as each blipped out and no\nlonger functioned as suddenly the pain became even to much for him...*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I COMP: &quot; The following systems have ceased to function: Mech fluid pump\n6-20 through 2-55 and thermal temperature system. All other systems will\ncease to function unless subject allows stasis lock to activate in 2 cycles.\nPower-cells are no longer able to sustain weaponry system 3-4, laser optic\ndefence system now offline. Respirator system had now begun to fail.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Dinobot growled but he could feel the lose mech fluid begin to seep into\nhis lungs, obviously he didn&#39;t need battle to do him in. He went down to one\nknee and began to breath shallowly and short, he knew that even with his\nintake of air he wouldn&#39;t be able to bring in enough to survive for long.\n&gt; Dinobot bowed his head, his repair system was still not powerful enough to\nsave him now.\n&gt; He needed to get into base, and quick!\n&gt; His computer voiced again but it was failing...*\n&gt;\n&gt; I COMP: &quot; 12 nano-clicks until stasis lock activates.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Dinobot now knew the full extent of why Tavatron had worried about him,\nhis lust for battle and ignorance had caused this! He cursed himself until\nhe felt his systems begin to fade, his legs collapsed from underneath him\nand ground rushed up towards his back.\n&gt; His wounds had finally gotten the better of him, the cause for this\nevent...bull-headed and stubbornness!\n&gt; Dinobot landed hard on his back.\n&gt; A rifle fell to the ground with a clatter not far from a scene where\nstasis lock was now dominant.\n&gt; The sound as it struck the earth was the only sound heard but then faded\naway to silence.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
