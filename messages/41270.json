I havn&#39;t been able to get online for the past two days (hence not posting). My hard\n&gt; drive finally died all the way, and I turned it in and got it replaced. I just now got\n&gt; everything installed (takes a while to set up a dual-boot Windows/Linux comp). I have caught up,\n&gt; but its 4:11am and I still havn&#39;t got to bed, so I&#39;ll post tomorrow as soon as I&#39;m concious.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW! The council election has been over for a few days now (if anyone who could still vote tried\n&gt; to vote, they should get an error), but the new council is:\n&gt; \n&gt; rAuq@...\n&gt; Rdahl@...\n&gt; BeastWars@...\n&gt; \n&gt; And me, but that&#39;s normal. Anyways, I havn&#39;t changed settings on the site cause my server isn&#39;t\n&gt; cooperating with me, but I&#39;ll do that tomorrow too. Alloran and Megan, its been great having you\n&gt; guys on the council. We wouldn&#39;t have accomplished as much as we did if you guys hadn&#39;t been on\n&gt; the team. I hope to see y&#39;all in future councils. Congratulations to everyone else that ran for\n&gt; council. It was a really close race.\n&gt; \n&gt; But congratulations to the new council members! BeastWars is gone for two weeks, so I guess its\n&gt; just me, rAuq, and Rdahl for now. I&#39;ll get Rdahl councilized tomorrow (I have a feeling I&#39;ll\n&gt; regret that).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, the previous council has gone on for three months (partly because of incompetence on my\n&gt; part and partly because of the election being so close to August that it was just left up there\n&gt; to make things easier). Do you guys (all RPGers) want to extend the terms to three months, or do\n&gt; you wanna keep them at two months and make the first council an exception?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One of my jobs ends next week, and I&#39;ll have a bunch of extra time to RP and work on the site.\n&gt; I&#39;ll get it fully updated and complete the new login system as soon as I can. Should be pretty\n&gt; cool.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; G&#39;night everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\nREPLY SOON          HARLEY PARRY FROM ST.THOMAS\n\n_______________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet your free @... address at http://mail.yahoo.ca\n\n"}}
