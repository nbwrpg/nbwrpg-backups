He pulled up and changed his course, \n&gt; heading for Asia and his velocity increasing.\n&gt; \n&gt; He sent out a comm. to everyone who had fought along with the Neo Cons and \n&gt; the Neo Decepticons as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This is Shockwave, we have done sufficient damage here, to continue would be \n&gt; a meaningless waste of resources.  Change your courses to the Ramora and \n&gt; increase your velocities.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Several shots dug into Unitron&#39;s frame, damaging it even worse.  This woke \n&gt; him up in time to hear Shockwave&#39;s retreat.  He painfully transformed into \n&gt; his space fighter mode, launching off towards the Ramora, not even stopping \n&gt; to take a few pot shots since he was eager to flee.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Firestarter executed the perfect barrel roll, the fusion blast flying under \n&gt; him, the shock wave of the blast lightly shaking Firestarter.  He launched \n&gt; off twenty rapid laser blasts at Forrior, changing his heading for Asia.  \n&gt; &quot;Next time you Autobot wanna bes!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Two laser blasts and weapons fire form a proton cannon flew past the STAG as \n&gt; he performed a few aerial maneuvers, but it left himself open to catch a \n&gt; dozen bullets in the underbelly of his mode.  He transformed to his biped \n&gt; mode to keep from leaking to much mech-fluid.  He fired off a few optic \n&gt; blasts down at Starstomp, heading for Asia as he was ordered.\n\n\n"}}
