No visible emblems or symbols of\nalliance, but as his s=\r\nensors penetrated the cracked hull plating, he\npicked up a faint signature.=\r\n  He didn&#39;t recognize it, and yet...\nsomething was still familiar about it,=\r\n almost disturbingly so.\n\nAfter a few seconds, his optics returned to Myrmi=\r\ndon.  They too held a\nmeasure of intelligence that surpassed that of the av=\r\nerage Predacon\nbent solely on mindless destruction and trivialities. \n\n&quot;I d=\r\non&#39;t detect anything,&quot; he said, &quot;They&#39;re dead and probably don&#39;t\neven have =\r\nenough energy to read anymore.  Now when the slag are you\ngoing to answer m=\r\ny questions?  Are you with the Maximals or aren&#39;t you?&quot;\n\n&gt; Hydras opened co=\r\nm link to all his troops and said &quot;Let&#39;s go home...\n&gt; We have done here... =\r\nMyrmidone, I&#39;m geting a streange signature\n&gt; around you...

W=\r\nhoever Myrmidon was talking to was obviously in\ncharge, or at least higher =\r\nin rank.  He was probably the bot Shard\nshould be talking to, but he decide=\r\nd to wait and listen to what else\nwas said.  Sometimes listening to other p=\r\neople talk gave more info\nthan asking questions. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
