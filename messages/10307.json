Also, to make sure that she would be able to pass through the wall \nof energy that made up the Maximal shield.\nAttaching the second cloaking device right beside the first she activated it \nand began to move towards the ship again.\nAs she approached one of the massive walls of the Cybertronien Fire she \nhappened to glance to the right and notice two Maximals heading towards the \nbase, simply shrugging and going back to locating a vent opening in the \nwall.\nBrightBlade smiled as she spotted a vent, only a foot or so from her \nposition on the ground.\nWith a sigh she looked up at the opening before reaching up and simply \npushing the grating in a bit.\nWith a quick eye she noticed that there were no Maximals about, the two she \nhad spotted before out of view from her.\nBrightBlade then heaved herself up into the shaft, the cover of the vent \nsimply sliding back into it&#39;s last position.\nShe then looked down the vent, her eyes seeming easily into the dark.\nNow it was time to find a computer console that would be able to give her \nthe information she needed.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
