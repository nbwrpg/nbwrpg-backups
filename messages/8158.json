He bared her teeth at the images. \nSomeone was near-by, and it felt like a bot, a male bot.\n\nShe reared up on her hind legs, tossing her thick mane. She shot a blanket \nof darkness through the air. Darkness and quiet. She put it loud through the \nmind ambient.

He found a\n&gt;valley. He looked down and saw an human figure. He fired an optic\n&gt;blast at the humanfigure. He walked over to it. It was a protohuman.\n&gt;&quot;Hmm, there must be more of these around. I will kill all of them.&quot;\n&gt;Lobstruck went down in to the valley and found a village with about\n&gt;30\n&gt;protohumans. He walked into the village.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Some of the Proto-human noticed him and started yelling. Some\n&gt;started throwing rocks at him, as others were runnig in terror and\n&gt;other were looking at him currioustly.\n&gt;\n&gt;   A rock hit Lobstruck, scracting his armor, &quot;Hey, you scratched my\n&gt;armor, I have to go to a cr chamber to get it back to normal and I\n&gt;hate CR CHAMBERS.&quot; Lobstruck fired a optic at a human that was about\n&gt;to throw a rock at him, as he walked over to the one that nailed him\n&gt;with a rock.\n&gt;\n&gt;   The protohuman saw the bot coming as he started to throw more rocks\n&gt;at him. Some of the Protohumans who were watching, started to run in\n&gt;terror.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Lobstruck punched the human multiple time, killing him. He then\n&gt;pulled out his double barrel pulse shotgun as he fired at the\n&gt;retraeting humans.\n&gt;\n&gt;   The Reatreating protohumans were mowed down to their death. There\n&gt;were only 5 protohumans alive now. Each of the human started to throw\n&gt;more rockets at the bot.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Lobstuck pulled out  his sword as he went and sliced up 4 of the\n&gt;humans. He watched as they fell over dead. He went up and grabbed the\n&gt;last human and brought the protohumans face to his. He took out a\n&gt;small pocket knife and cut off the human chest. Lobstruck then\n&gt;grabbed\n&gt;the beating heart and put it into a stroage bag he was carring. He\n&gt;then left the village, laughing as he counted 32 dead protohumans. He\n&gt;climb up the valley and started to look for some bots again. He had\n&gt;to\n&gt;find a bot, it didn&#39;t matter if it was maximal or predacon, he wanted\n&gt;to know if there was life on this planet.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;   Proto all of a sudden grabbed his head as he had a visoin of the\n&gt;village of Protohumans that were killed. He didn&#39;t know what was\n&gt;going\n&gt;on. &quot;I&#39;m going to take a nap.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;(Can someone find lobstruck.)\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
