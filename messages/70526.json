IF YOUR EYES HAVE \n&gt; FAILED YOU, REMEMBER, YOU STILL HAVE YOUR OTHER SENSES!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson somewhat could make a connection. Was Vestige a part of Rodimus? \n&gt; Every time Rodimus sounded in dispair, Vestige went off line.  And each \n&gt; time the insects got closser, his power would diminish to the point where \n&gt; he falls lifeless.  He makes connections. Vestige had the same colors as \n&gt; Rodimus.  Was this perhaps his inner soul helpless in his arms?\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t worry my friend. Even in darkness there is light.  And what if I \n&gt; were to physically brighten things up a bit?  These arachnids don&#39;t seem \n&gt; to like the light do they?  I wonder...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He now turns on his high beams to luminate the area, attempting to see if \n&gt; light was one of the insects weak spots.  He keeps it on as he walks \n&gt; forward, hoping to find Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Time to play the Exterminator.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson had no time to be alarmed. He is quick to kneel down to Vestige, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and picks him up gently. He was not about to leave him behind.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;They&#39;re comming, Vestige, hold on, we may not be able to escape the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; horde, but we can lose them long enough to get our bearings.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson takes his chances and prepares to get off the rail car, hoping \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to at least get Vestige to a safe place, even if it were just for a few \n&gt;&gt; &gt; moments, to assemble a reasonable strategy to get rid of the horde, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; perhaps even vanquish them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;There has to be some way to stop them. Everything has a weakness, it&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; just a matter of finding it. No radar, no sonar, looks like my eyes \n&gt;&gt; &gt; will have to do.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Vesige stirred again as Tuscon talked, his voice was weak as he spoke,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;They are trying to corrupt this world.&quot; He paused as if trying to\n&gt;&gt; dredge up enough energy to continue speaking, &quot;When they arrived\n&gt;&gt; everything . . . . changed.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as Vestige talked the car slid into a dark tunnel the buzzing\n&gt;&gt; outside could be heard still getting louder as the insects tried to\n&gt;&gt; follow the car inside, although the width of the tunnel was slowing\n&gt;&gt; them down a little.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The car pulled into a dimly lit station and the magnacar door slid\n&gt;&gt; open to display an empty platform. The platform was pretty standard as\n&gt;&gt; platforms go, gun metal grey walls, steel beams acting as pillars were\n&gt;&gt; positioned evenly at different parts of the room.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;TUSCON!&quot; came Rodimus&#39; voice. &quot;WHERE ARE YOU TUSCON, I CAN&#39;T SEE YOU!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It echoed throught the station. A look at Vestige showed him to be\n&gt;&gt; unconscious again.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
