I might be able to supplement this afterwards, but that&#39;s \niffy. I&#39;ll post twice tomorrow to make up, yes? And what a \ncoincidence, I have a character INCREDIBLY similar to Crotale \nstarring in my fanfiction that I am currently working on. &#39;Cept he&#39;s \nan Apache helicopter (or soon will be). By the way, dun take this \npersonally, it&#39;s just Skull&#39;s way of looking at things.\n\n(IC)\nWatching the Autobot whose inferiority complex rivals many massive \nquadrupeds of prehistoric earth in size, an aloof and confident \nSkullhammer lets it slide. The big bot is older and more experienced \nthan the smug young transformer, and has found that when dealing with \nthe meager few Autobots who find suspicion goes father than trust, to \nsimply ignore any of the comments they might make.\n\n&quot;Yeah, yeah. And Optimus Prime&#39;s predecessor was a toaster oven. If I \nwas one of the Preds or Decepticons, would I bother showing up \nwithout my guns blazing? I know full well our procedures for landing \nparties that come unannounced.&quot; The muttered words, loud enough to be \nheard but quiet enough to not be taken as a threat, were stronger \nthan Skullhammer meant to bring on all at once. With a distant \nshaking of his head, Skullhammer looks towards the form of Pacifix \nand waits for further orders.\n\n\n\n"}}
