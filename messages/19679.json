For instance the \ncells of translife can be combined and added to a protoform without \nthe risk of the cells rejecting each other.&quot; Lady Hawk paused \nwondering if it was her imagination or was Squizzy asking all these \nquestions to steal her experiment.\n\n&quot;I know a place where I can give you a better example.&quot; she thought \nabout Zardus&#39; expression if he learned that they&#39;d walked out on \nhim.&quot;If you&#39;d like to go with me.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; \n&gt; She nodded. &quot;I can try to gather that information for you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She walked up to the CR chamber and pressed a few buttons.  Then \nshe \n&gt; walked over to a computer console and began printing up the DNA on \n&gt; all the bots that been in that inparticular CR chamber.  She handed \n&gt; the information to LadyHawk. &quot;Here you are. Will there be anything \n&gt; else?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She turned around, stopped and turned back to face LadyHawk.&quot;I am \n&gt; curious, why are you needing all the DNA from the bots here on the \n&gt; ship? Would you not find better specimens in the wild?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk got an idea, maybe having an assistant wasn&#39;t such a \nbad \n&gt; idea.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Say, you wouldn&#39;t know how to find CR information for a repaired \n&gt; bot would\n&gt; &gt; you? These systems just aren&#39;t up to the standards meant for a \nbot \n&gt; of my\n&gt; &gt; status.&quot; She was hoping that Squizzy could gain the information \nshe \n&gt; couldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; find.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I could make it worth your effort to help me gain the \ninformation \n&gt; I need.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk knew that a bot with the information she&#39;d given would \n&gt; have to\n&gt; &gt; fully understand the technology involved. Squizzy did which left \ntwo\n&gt; &gt; options, either take her back to Veratis when she went, or have a \n&gt; late\n&gt; &gt; supper before she went.\n\n\n"}}
