As he got to the edge of the \nclearing he looked straight at Pacifix.  &quot;They must all train you the \nsame, Autobot, you are as stupid for letting us go as that idiot \nleader Prime was.  &quot;  he said with a sly smile.  Then turning and \njumping into the air flying west.  \n\n----------------------------\n\nJetV followed behind, in the undergroath of the forest.\n\n"}}
