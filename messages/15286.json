He was obviously still in favor of \nMeagtron. He&#39;d send Dollen away, Starscream&#39;s most vigilant \nsupporter, and than rat Starscream out to Megatron. Than whe he&#39;s \ncatchin some snooze, somebody pulls the plug on Starscream&#39;s spark. \nWell, that isn&#39;t going to happen.\n\n&quot;Captain Phobia, please let me go in Dollen&#39;s face. I could not stand \na meeting with Megatron yet. Please, I can stay loyal if I go with \nthe Alliance. But if I smell Megatron, my anger might overcloud my \njudgement. Please, for the safety of the group.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix\n\nBrix looked at Ramulus.\n\n&quot;Alright.....I&#39;m putting you in stasis lock now.&quot;\n\nBrix opened Ramulus&#39; back side and pressed a button, putting him into \nstasis lock. He closed the backside and fliped him over. He opened \nthe chest plate and began to remove his spark.....\n______________________________________________________________________\nThe Trainers\n\nThe Trainers walked out of their base, all ready for their mission.\n\n&quot;Ah, what a great day for a hunt!&quot; shouted Prebon, &quot;Ignatius, take to \nthe skies and use your eyes to search for them. Blaze, go a bit ahead \nand sniff him out. Hammer and Bullet, you&#39;re with me.&quot;\n\nThe 5 hunters set out to find the beast Savage.\n\n\n"}}
