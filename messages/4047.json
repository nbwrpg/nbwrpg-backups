A million thoughts raced \nthrough her mind, consuming her, overwhelming her.  She tried to fight them \noff, to return to the battle, but she couldn�t, something was holding her \nback. Her mind began to drift, to wander about her own lost memories, when \nsuddenly her optics snapped open. The force of awakening so suddenly sent \nher mind spinning. She shut her optics for a few moments, waiting for the \nspinning sensation to subside.\n\nTavatron had no idea why she had awakened so suddenly, all she knew was that \nshe was awake now, back among the living so to speak. Only moments ago she \nhad felt Dinobot�s arms about her, protecting her from some unseen danger. \nTavatron turned her head in his direction, blinking a few times in order to \nclear her blurred vision:\n\n&quot;Computer, status report.&quot;\n\nInternal comp: &quot;Damage to outer armor minimal. Optic lasers at 10% and \nfailing. Suggest returning to beast mode for internal repairs.&quot;\n\nTavatron growled to herself, she was in no immediate danger, internal \nrepairs could wait. She brought her hand to her face and roughly wiped \naway... mech-fluid? Her internal computer had said there was no major damage \nto her outer armor, so why was her face dotted with mech-fluid?\nShe could sense no facial wounds, so why so much fluid? Sh finally looked up \nat Dinobot, as if seeing him for the first time. His armor was scrapped, if \nnot for his TM2 design he would�ve been dead long ago. Tavatron quickly \nclimbed to her feet, kneeling at his side. She did a quick scan of his \nsystems, trying to assess the damage. One thing was certain, he needed a CR \nchamber, now. She knew she couldn�t touch him, her touch, no matter how \ngentle, would hurt like hell on his obviously slagged body:\n\n&quot;C�mon Dinobot, you have to stand up.&quot; A certain amount of panic and concern \nwas evident in her voice:\n\n&quot;You can�t die! I won�t let you!&quot;\n\nThe defiance in her voice was not directed at him, but rather at the fates \nthat she dared to challenge. She wasn�t going to just stand by and let him \ndie, by Primus she had to do something!\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
