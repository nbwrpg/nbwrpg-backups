A gestalt like him could \n&gt; easily stand up to shots from small bots like Divebomb. He launched two more \n&gt; missiles from his missile launchers, but this time he guided them to take \n&gt; different paths. His mind stayed with them, ready to make them dodge if \n&gt; Divebomb shot agian.\n\n"}}
