There is a possibility that\n&gt; &gt; we might soften his personality, but I&#39;m not convinced that we can get\n&gt; &gt; to the original Prime. From what intelligence has told me, the\n&gt; &gt; Tripreds seemed to have built him nearly from scratch.

The Maximals and Predacons were arguing yet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again when the Tripreds arrived. They had been lurking in the\nranks of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Preds and had waited the right moment to strike. Even with both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Maximal and Predacon armies, we were not able to resist them\nlong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We were cornered in Katatronia City. We decided to retreat so\nthat we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could better resist them. We embarked on a ship, Maximals and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons, and departed for Earth. There, we established the\nSurvivor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Council.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He paused, letting the implications sink in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; AzureBlade: However, just a few weeks ago, we learned of Prime&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reconstruction and of the the Tripredacus plan. The Council sent me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after him because of my neutrality. I am as much a Predacon as I\nam a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximal. My role here is to contain or destroy Prime. He has\nbecome a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; threat no one can afford to ignore, not even the Tripreds.
