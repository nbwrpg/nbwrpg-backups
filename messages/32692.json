To remain close after striking was asking for damage. But her \nattacks were quick before she moved off to decide where to attack next, \nalways moving in for the kill and then out to save on damage. The taste of \nhis mech fluid was fresh in her mouth and pieces of Marine&#39;s armor were \nstuck between her teeth, though the piece she had torn from him had been \nquickly swollowed.\nHer SBM thrived off of the energy of other robotics, which was a stable \ndiet. Meat wasn&#39;t a favorite, but curcuits were.\nIR was about to sweep in behind Marine and go at his back when she suddenly \nsmelled something different, though the smell of mech fluid almost swamped \nher senses. Her head swept up and over Mariens, turning to look behind her \njust in time to see Ominous Prime and Quasar.\nA loud roar/hiss erupted from her throat as she brought her head back and \nthen snapped it forward, sending a large spray of yellow acid at them. But \nshe hadn&#39;t moved while attacking so 12 of the energy shots sent by those two \nhit dead on, though 4 only skidded along her sides and back before \ncontinuing on to explode in the ground, but left deep gashes in their wake.\nIron screamed and hissed, turning around again to glare at Marine, \nexplosings erupting from behind, armor/skin peeling back to expose curcuits \ninside. Damage had been given. Since the damage was to her back quarters, \nher hips were the first things to be effected and her legs collapsed but not \nbefore she spat a thick layer of acit at Marine.\nBut then something caught her eye, only proped up by her front limbs, she \nswung her head around and looked at Jackle. His shots leveled her, chin \nslamming against the ground with a grunt but not before she slashed her tail \nat Ominous and Quasar.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
