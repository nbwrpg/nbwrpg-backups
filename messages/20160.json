She stood up on her hind legs, \nthe head on the bear moves and the metal face of a female bot was \nexposed as the jaw of the bear moved down.  Her left wing suddenly \ndropped to the floor with a loud clang. She looked at Veratis. Fear, \ncurousity, anger, all flooded her thoughts.  She unknowingly \nprojected them to Veratis. She looked at him as her new eyes focused \non him. &quot;What...am...I?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Your body rejected the transfer.&quot; Veratis said looking up at the \n&gt; large bear. &quot;You&#39;ll probably lose those wings in time&quot; he didn&#39;t \nwant \n&gt; to tell her but knew it was best to be honest with a bot with \n&gt; telepathic abilities. &quot;I had to use the virus to stop the \nrejection. \n&gt; You might lose your ability to transform completely.&quot; he kept his \n&gt; distance, he didn&#39;t know how she&#39;d react to the bad news.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
