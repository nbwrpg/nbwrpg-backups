St. Hilary, original home of the Ark but was now \nhome to their relatively small craft.\n\nRaising both arms high up in the air, a golden sphere shape rose out of the \nlava and floated next to the Vok, an entryway sliding open and the three \ncreations closing in.  The entryway closed and the ship went back into the \nlava that would mask its signatures and wouldn&#39;t harm it because of superior \nshields that fed off the lava like it was energy.\n\nWith the energy the Vok would conserve and come back when the ship told them \nit was a more beneficial time to arise.\n\n"}}
