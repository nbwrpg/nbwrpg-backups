There were bots staring and some ducked for cover. It was \nall from Berserk&#39;s presence. He had to aggressive posture or mood \nabout him. He kept quiet and walked by the two scientists.\n\n&quot;Primus, they&#39;re so rude down here,&quot; Techy commented. Berserk turned \nhis head down to look at her. She was closest to him. \n\nThey made it to the weapons shop without incident. Bersek paused when \nSky Knight led the way in. Techy gave him a reasuring tug, and he \nfollowed. There were racks of rifles, many styles of guns behind a \nglass case, swords stacked up on more racks, and boxed dentionators.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; Techy said. &quot;Try looking for a rifle first.&quot; \n\n&quot;A big one,&quot; Sky Knight put in.\n\nWith Berserk at her side, Techy reached up and took a large rifle \nwith a yellow tassle below the nozzle. It was a plasma rifle. She \nhanded it to Berserk. He took it, wrapping the shoulder strap around \nhis shoulder and held it accordingly. He jerked it, testing the \nweight.\n\nHe removed it and nodded in it&#39;s approval.\n\n&quot;Hey, a Wire Catcher,&quot; Sky Knight said by the front desk. &quot;Didn&#39;t he \nhave one of these?&quot;\n\nBerserk and Techy looked over. &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t know.&quot; she said. Berserk \nwalked to him.\n\n&quot;I did. I made my escapes that way.&quot; Berserk said. \n\n&quot;You need one?&quot; Sky Knight asked.\n\n&quot;I could.&quot;\n\nThere were three styles of the Wire Catchers, which was a devise that \nwent around the forearm, containing a wire with a arrow-like head on \nthe end. He picked up and largest one and fitted it on his right \nforearm. He checked the bottons on it. It had a shorter wire length \nthan his old one. \n\n&quot;Not the same model,&quot; he said. &quot;It would have to do.&quot; He removed it \nand handed it to Sky Knight.\n\n&quot;Two hand-held guns,&quot; Sky Knight said.\n\n&quot;Then a clash sword would complete it,&quot; Techy added.\n\nBerserk nodded.\n\nSky Knight bent down to the display case, looking at the many \ncollection of hand gun sized energy weapons.\n\n&quot;Plasma blaster, model 5-E7,&quot; Berserk said, and Sky Knight \nimmediately pointed to it. &quot;And Stunner.&quot;\n\n&quot;Stunner, stunner.&quot; Sky Knight repeated, trying to find it. &quot;Ah-ha!&quot; \nHe pointed to a white and blue gun with a smooth rounded off handle. \nIt was a gun with a electric shock it to when he made contract to an \nopponet. &quot;Hey, I know my weapons better than I thought.&quot; He stood up \nand looked around. &quot;Now all we need is that clash sword.&quot; He left \nBerserk&#39;s side, walking to the rack of swords.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to ask,&quot; Techy said, walking to the front desk. &quot;Hello?&quot; \nShe looked around. &quot;Anybody here?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m comming,&quot; a male voice called out and appeared from a room. A \nsmall bot walked to the desk, looking at Techy. &quot;Yes?&quot; He suddenly \nscreamed, looking at Berserk. He ducked down behind the desk.\n\nTechy scream from surprise and jumped back. Berserk jumped as well, \nand went into a defensive posure, setting his black hands in a curve.\n\n&quot;The heck?&quot; Techy leaned over the desk, looking down at the bot \nhunched on the ground. &quot;What is your problem?&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t let him kill me!&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;Huh?&quot;\n\n&quot;That clone.&quot;\n\n&quot;Berserk?&quot; She sneered. &quot;He&#39;s got going to hurt you. Now get up. \nWe&#39;re here only to do business.&quot;\n\nHe slowly stood up.\n\n&quot;We need a clash sword.&quot;\n\n&quot;Model C-7.&quot; Berserk said.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think we have anymore.&quot; the bot said nervously.\n\n&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Techy asked.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; He turned his head. &quot;Hey, uh, Nova, we have anymore \nof those Clash swords? The E-7?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yep, hey, we got one last one.&quot; a female&#39;s voice soon replied. &quot;We \ngot someone who wants it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; \n\nWithin moments a female Predacon came out with a curving sword with \nseveral short chained blades in her hand. She placed it on the \ncounter.\n\nTechy nodded. &quot;That it?&quot; she asked.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied. \n\nTechy put the rifle on the counter, then turned to Sky Knight. She \nwaved to him. &quot;We got it.&quot; He came to her side and placed to two gun \nwith the other weapons. \n\nThe small male rang up the credits, Sky Knight paying them. Both Sky \nKnight and Techy took their share of the weapons and walked to the \ndoorway of the store.\n\nJust as he stepped to the side, Berserk growled at the small bot. He \nscreamed and ducked down.\n\nHis female partner pondered at the leaving giant, saying: &quot;At least \nhe has a sense of humor.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
