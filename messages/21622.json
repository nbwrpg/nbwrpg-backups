Then he had a idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Arcangel open his chest plate and pulled out the maximal matrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Arcangel:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;you all know what this lets see what would happen if I used this. \nIf I can. \n&gt; Hot Rod time to put your spark back into place.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As he opened weird fellings started to go over him. He could not \ntell what \n&gt; was happening life,truth,Justice,love,peace,darkness,evil, and pain \nall came \n&gt; to his mined at once. He was changing again this time. he could \nfeel more \n&gt; power then ever he was Angel Prime. Then a huge blue blast came at \nHot Rod \n&gt; to change him back to a maximal. Arcangel was bigger and older \nlooking his \n&gt; blue and silver armor shined better then ever. his eyes burned like \nfire. He \n&gt; was truely the next Prime to rise.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fury fired a net at Feline then transformed and fell backwards at \nthe sight \n&gt; of Angel Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [yanshosh when you put the new chars list make it Angel Prime \ninstead of \n&gt; Arcangel. RoboRick plz do not make Hot Rod into Rodimus Prime \nanytime soon \n&gt; plz.]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
