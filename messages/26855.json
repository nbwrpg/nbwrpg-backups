They planned to assasinate Hell Beast and take \nover, if im not mistaken. When they failed at that, Vulois was thought to \nhave been killed.  When he resurfaced, Vulois decided to turn over a new leaf \nand be peaceful. Soundwave at first was relectant, but he was loyal to \nVulois, and soon understood his motivations.  So as you can see, he became \ngood because of his best friend.  And another thing, when he was murdered he \ntransformed into a totally mechanical tank!  And i ALSO think Bob Skir is a \nmoron!
