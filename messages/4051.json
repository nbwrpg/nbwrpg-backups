He opens his mouth to reply, a second before they hit the ground.\n\nThere are several snapping sounds as Prowl is thrown a few feet, rolling into \na boulder as several shots from Nemesis barely miss him. He groans. He was \nused to crashing, as any flying warrior probably is, but he had never before \ncrashed with his girlfriend in his arms and a hole from a 45 foot tall \ngestalt&#39;s optic blast in his wing. This wasn&#39;t a bad crash, only a snapped \nwing and several broken ribs resulting from it.\n\nHe opens his eyes and looks at Iron Raptor, wondering why she was looking at \nhim in a concerned way. Prowl stands up, using the boulder he had rolled into \nfor support and wincing as he moved his broken ribs.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; he say in responce to Iron Raptor&#39;s hand reaching out for him, &quot;A \nfew broken bones is all. You allright?&quot;\n\nHe looks over to Octociz, who had just run up to them. &quot;Is the battle over?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus grins as he sees Prowl and Iron Raptor crash, and the Oblitercon \nsituation resolve itself. He flies over to Nemesis.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s get out of here. The maximals will have a good time repairing, I&#39;m \nsure.&quot;\n\n&quot;Arcangle,&quot; he says into his comm-link, sending the message to the maximal, \n&quot;I will return to base and scan for whatever you have detected.&quot;\n\nZardus turns, flying off toward the alliance base. &quot;All Alliance units, \nreturn to base,&quot; he says to the Alliance over his comm-link.\n\n"}}
