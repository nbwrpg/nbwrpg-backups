He leaps off \nthe beast, and most of the shots hit his thick hide. He yells in \npain. Prebon calls to everyone.\n\n&quot;Alright, order time! Ignatius, you take bot one(Bluestreak, see \nAlloran this time I remembered). Bullet, bot two!(Andromena) Hammer, \nbot three!(Ratchet) Blaze, take the other cat.(Logo&#39;s ice cat, forget \nname) I&#39;ll take the porcupine.(Spears)&quot; Prebon looked around for bots \nthat Savage could take. Than he spotted him. The bot that Savage hated\n(Striker).\n\n&quot;Savage! There he is! Attack him!&quot;\n\nSavage stampeded towards Striker, firing two fireballs.\n\nIgnatius landed infront of Bluestreak\n\n&quot;See ya....Ignatius transform!&quot; The eagle went to bot mode and fired \noff two plasma shots at Bluestreak.\n\nBullet, already transformed, landed infront of Andromena. Never one \nfor words, Bullet simply drew his gaitling gun and fired 150 shots.\n\nHammer, Prebon&#39;s second-in-command, ran up to Ratchet.\n\n&quot;You know...there&#39;s a reason they call me Hammer....(No, not because \nhe has a hammer)&quot; Hammer leaped into the air and came down with a \nkick to Ratchet&#39;s chest.\n\nBlaze transformed to meet the snow cat.\n\n&quot;Cat fight....&quot; She pulled out the flame thrower and started to burn \nthe leopard.\n\nPrebon gazed into Spears&#39; eyes.\n\n&quot;You should feel honoured. You and your friends will be the very \nfirst bots on this planet defeated by the Trainers!&quot; He opened his \npalm blasters and fired 3 shots at Spears.\n\n\n"}}
