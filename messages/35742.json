Still weak he sat and thought. \nThe hit from Deemos had awoken his purpose for coming to Earth in the \nfirst place.  His purpose was clear to him now, and he hoped that the \nChivtrons would help him.  He remembered the story well.  Of how the \nmatrix tried to make the superiour bot.  Organic and robotic all at \nonce.  But the internal battles between the two completely different \nforms forced it to seperate.  Creating a mechanical bot bent on \ndestroying all organic life on Cybertron.  OF course, this was hundred \nof millions of years ago.  The other half, the organic was trying to \nprotect the organic things. Great Wars raged on between the two.\nBut what did this have to do with Grounded?\n\n\n"}}
