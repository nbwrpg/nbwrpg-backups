His sword was created\nwell to not bending at all...blue flames jumping off the blade....\nHe flipped around IR&#39;s face going right into his then the teeth...the\nteeth are what scared him...With quick thinking he pulled his arm back\nleaving the blue flame coverd sword in the path of the alien teeth. At\nthe same time a small device on his shoulder launched to firegrenades\nat the head of this beast.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor hissed as she ducked under the first shots sent by\nFireBlade.\n&gt; This foe might be tougher then she&#39;d hoped for. But he was still\npray none\n&gt; the less.\n&gt; She was about to resume wrapping around him when two grenades sent him\n&gt; flying towards her...sword tip first.\n&gt; &lt; Ak!&gt;\n&gt; Her mind quickly calculated exactly what sort of damage that sword\nwould\n&gt; cause before it even reached her.\n&gt; Would it pierce her armor plated exo-structure?\n&gt; Better believe it!\n&gt; Would it damage any vital circuits?\n&gt; No.\n&gt; How deep would it go in?\n&gt; Not far, but enough to cause a good sized scar after the fight.\n&gt; So the sword wasn&#39;t a concern, but to minimize the damage IR moved\nthe best\n&gt; she could so that the blade would hit her shoulder...leaving\nFireBlade&#39;s\n&gt; body vulnerable to attack.\n&gt; And so it struck, the blade going in only a quarter of the way to\ncontact\n&gt; the thick plating of her shoulder that kept her circuits safe. It\nwas hard\n&gt; enough that if the blade struck too hard it would either bend or\ncrack the\n&gt; blade.\n&gt; She had been built well by her creators, and twice as well by the\nMatrix.\n&gt; Iron Raptor then looked over her shoulder at FireBlade, swinging her\nhead\n&gt; around so that it would be less then an inch from his.\n&gt; Her large, clawed hand came to try and grab at his arm that held the\nsword,\n&gt; intended on ripping it free from it&#39;s socket or at least making him\nlet go\n&gt; of the sword.\n&gt; She bared her silver 7 inch long teeth.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Big mistake!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Her voice boomed as she spat acid at FireBlade&#39;s face.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
