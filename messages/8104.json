He had been wandering the ship and had found \nnothing unordinary so far. He was bored.\n\nReptilica sits down at a chair, looking down at the internal scanners with \nbored optics. He frowns as his eyes go over the readings from the Tortrue \nchambers. Two Maximals....... One of them was one of the hostages, the other \none was clearly a different bot.\n\n&quot;Computer, activate visual of torture chambers.&quot;\n\nA security camera activates in the torture chambers, displaying what it \nrecords on the screen. Reptilica&#39;s eyes widen. On the floor, laying beside a \nmean looking Maximal was Dark One, in a puddle of his own mech fluid, with \nNemesis laying not too far away, mechfluid dripping from his head. He frowns. \nThat one bot could not have taken out both Dark One and Nemesis, and where \nwas the other hostage?\n\n&quot;Computer, scan for cloaking,&quot; he orders, the computer obeying. He frowns at \nthe results. Two more bots were cloaked.....\n\n&quot;Red alert! Four Maximal intruders in the torture chambers!&quot; Reptilica yells \ninto his comm-link, running out of the bridge with his gun ready as the \nklaxxon lights as sirens activate.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl&#39;s head jerks up from Iron Raptor&#39;s face as he hears the alarms. He \nswears silently, wondering how the Alliance could have detected them. Looking \nover at Dinobot and Tavatron he groans. They wern&#39;t cloaked, that&#39;s how.\n\n&quot;Donobot, Tavatron, cloak and lets get out of here!&quot; he yells in Dinobot&#39;s \ndirection. Looking back up at the vent. They didn&#39;t have enough time to go \nthrough that way...\n\nReluctantly, he takes his arms off of Iron Raptor, walking over to Nemesis \nEnforcer. He lifts the unconscious bot, dragging him over to the doors. As \nProwl puts Nemesis&#39; hand up to a screen on the side of the door, both the \nblast doors and the door open.\n\nProwl turns around to look at the rest of the group. &quot;Let&#39;s go before they \nall file in here!&quot;\n\n"}}
