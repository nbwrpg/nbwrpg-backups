(I know he&#39;s not there but there \nisn&#39;t a better name for it.)  His beast mode was that of a crane.  (You know, \nthe bird that stands on one leg.)  He stepped out and found that in the crash \nhis logic circuits were scrambled, but he was in perfect condition other than \nthat.  Unfortunately all he could do was give pearls of wisdom.  Now all he \ncould do is make things unclear with those &quot;pearls of wisdom.&quot;\n\n"}}
