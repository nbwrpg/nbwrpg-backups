Answering Artemis he said &quot;We \n&gt; have to follow Tremor to thier base, they no where are&#39;s is, so we \n&gt; must find thiers.&quot;  he said but just then as he flew out of the \ntrees \n&gt; and off the edge of a cliff that hurled him towards the watery \ndepths \n&gt; below.  Showing fright for a second he yelled &quot;Stoppppp \n&gt; AAARRTEMIS&quot; then, almost gracefully, he flipped over, his wheels \n&gt; folding in and his front coning.  As he hit the waer he went under \n&gt; then flew back out skipping along the water in his JetSki mode.  \n&gt; His colors blended him into the water he was riding on.  He could \n&gt; clearly see Tremor flying above him.\n\n\n"}}
