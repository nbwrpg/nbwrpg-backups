It is not in Oregon, but\nin\n&gt; where Tibet is today.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, on the location of the Autobots and Decepticons: The Decepticons are\n&gt; currently in Hell Beast&#39;s ship, while the Autobots are somewhere where\nBlue\n&gt; Stinger put them.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/Striker/Ramulus::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus lands in the alliance base, setting the autoguns on alert just in\ncase\n&gt; and walking off to a CR chamber.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Striker walks into the Ark, heading for the CR chambers.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; The CR chamber door opens and Ramulus steps out, fully repaired. He walks\nto\n&gt; the bridge and looks around, noting that everything was nearly scrap. He\n&gt; growls, looking at a scanner panel that survived the blast. His eyes\nnarrow,\n&gt; seeing a blip on the scanner.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Computer, identify blip.&quot; On his orders, the computer reports that the\n&gt; detected object is a stasis pod.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus nods, activating his comm-link. &quot;I am going out for a pod. I will\nbe\n&gt; back shortly.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Without waiting for a reply, Ramulus walks out, heading for the pod.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; STEALS AND DEALS!
