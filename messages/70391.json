Oh, um=\r\n, just ta let ya\n&gt; &gt; know, we have a comrade down here who is visually impa=\r\nired, he might need\n&gt; &gt; some extra help getting out.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson walks =\r\nforward, now able to use his sonar system.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; He&#39;s right, I&#39;m visual=\r\nly impaired, but just tell me where I can get a\n&gt; &gt; foot and a hand hold, a=\r\nnd I might just be able to get myself out of here.\n&gt; &gt; I attempted somethin=\r\ng I call the inverted spider maneuver. If I can do\n&gt; &gt; that, I might just b=\r\ne able to get out of here myself. A little bit of\n&gt; &gt; ninjabot training. An=\r\nyway, great to have you here comrades.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; From his position at the top o=\r\nf the pit it was very difficult for\n&gt; Cheetor to see Tuscon as well as anyo=\r\nne down in the pit as they were\n&gt; nearly a hundred meters or more away or m=\r\nore. &quot;I hear ya!&quot; Cheetor\n&gt; says as he squinted to look down. &quot;But why are =\r\nyou going to work so\n&gt; hard when we have ol&#39; Ramulus here?&quot; Cheetor asked, =\r\nhis voice booming\n&gt; down into the pit, echoing along the sides. &quot;He&#39;s an ex=\r\npert at this\n&gt; kinda stuff.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Time to go to my new home&quot;sighed the f=\r\normer predacon\n&gt; \n&gt; As Perceptor grumbled about the prospects of his new ho=\r\nme amongst the\n&gt; Maximals a metal cable with a hook began to extend its way=\r\n down from\n&gt; the top side of the pit. It took a minute or two to finally re=\r\nach the\n&gt; over 100 meter drop to the bottom. It stopped perhaps a foot or s=\r\no\n&gt; from the tunnel at Tuscon&#39;s position, dangling over the chasm that was\n=\r\n&gt; below Tuscon and the rest of his crew. A hot wind blew up from below,\n&gt; c=\r\nausing the cable to sway slightly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Grab on!&quot; Ramulus&#39; gruff voice fro=\r\nm the topside of the pit.
