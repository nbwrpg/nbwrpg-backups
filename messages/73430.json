For some it meant repairs, for others it\nmeant a change of form and even some substance. Energy fed through\npower cable as computer code and data streamed as well. There was new\nlives starting and old ones connecting and reconnecting. Things were\nchanging and realigning.\n\nWhat would the future hold, would new features were to be added to\nthis landscape that they wee creating?\n\nOnly time would tell.\n\nThe CR chambers blinked one last time as they indicated that their\noccupants had passed through and had been converted.\n\nAfter a moment the doors hissed and then slid open.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
