Powerlinking will give you guys the umph\n&gt; it&#39;s gonna take ta take ta not only exterminate those overgrown pests, but\n&gt; it&#39;ll really put Hydras in his place.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns to Rat Trap.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; A power play huh? I&#39;m willing to try it, but Rodimus has to also agree to\n&gt; something like this. It&#39;s not something I can do without his permission.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Atta boy Wheels. And I can&#39;t think of anyone else who&#39;d make a powerful\n&gt; statement other than you guys.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns his head to Rodimus and waits for his reply.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus looked at Tuscon, his eyes confused and yet curious, &quot;Umm, how\nwould we do that?&quot; Rodimus looked down at himself as if expecting to\nfind something about himself to have changed - it hadn&#39;t. &quot;I was not\nbuilt like that.&quot; He looked over at Tuscon carefully and critically.\n&quot;I didn&#39;t realize you could do that?&quot;\n\nRodimus shrugged as he continued to speak, &quot;I can transform, but\nwouldn&#39;t we have to be rebuilt to be able to do something like that?&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I bet that Perceptor could tell us more about Hydras than he had told\n&gt; us&quot;said Talon&quot;He had behaved... quite trustful so far, If i remember he was\n&gt; telling something about Nightlight, just before we leave.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLord Elder, who was standing off to one side, nodded as he folded his\narms over his chest, &quot;Yes, I bet Perceptor could tell us much about\nHydras. He strengths, his weaknesses, how to by pass the security\nprotocols.&quot;\n\nCheetor nodded stepped up, &quot;YEAH! I bet he even knows a back way in\nthat even ol Hydras doesn&#39;t know about.&quot; He looked to Rodimus and\nTuscon, &quot;Just give me the word and tell me which way to go, and I&#39;m on\nit!&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
