If he is still functional he is definitly out of range of her=\r\n\n&gt; ability to connect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also she had any kind of signal on DRILL BIT, V=\r\nICE GRIP and/or DINOBOT\n&gt; then as they went deeper into the caves they quic=\r\nkly fell off of her\n&gt; radar as well. Whatever interferance there was it was=\r\ny cutting off her\n&gt; range even faster in the caves.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFOr the mome=\r\nnt, BLACKARACHNIA was losing contact even at the bare ranges as the PREDACO=\r\nNS spread out.  Within what ordinarily would be visual range, here they see=\r\nmed to be losing awareness of one another&#39;s existence.  Her scanners gather=\r\ning increasingly less data and increasing interference even within (by Cybe=\r\nrtronian standards) point blank range otherwise.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; For the momen=\r\nt BLACKARACHNIA was truely alone, or so it seemed. At\n&gt; least there no was =\r\nanswering call from TARANTULUS. The only thing she\n&gt; could hear was the con=\r\nversations going on around her. But was that\n&gt; because she was truely cut o=\r\nff from TARANTULUS or because he was just\n&gt; letting her believe that she wa=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; The old spider was a wiley old creature. One that has only gotten m=\r\nore\n&gt; crafty with age.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWherever BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s loyalties were, =\r\ncoerced or otherwise, there was enough of her left alone to parade with gle=\r\ne.  Assuming this realm stayed this way, cut off from everywhere else, she =\r\nintended to in time work at establishing her own base here, cut away from a=\r\nll others.  Rubbing her mandibles together with glee at the contemplation, =\r\nfree for her own schemes.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As VICE GRIP and DRILL BIT prepared =\r\nto go further in and DINOBOT\n&gt; prepared to go back to the surface there was=\r\n an odd tapping that could\n&gt; be heard even above the hum. One that echoed t=\r\nhrough out the cave\n&gt; coming from further in and further down.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ech=\r\no made it difficult to discern any patturns to it, but one\n&gt; thing was for =\r\nsure, it definitly did not sound like anything natural.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nHOpefull=\r\ny DINOBOT would be able to get close enough to the surface for a quick comm=\r\n burst to CRYOTEK which would explain waht they had encountered and what VI=\r\nCE GRIP was doing without going up aboveground, if CRYOTEK had not gone too=\r\n far ahead.\n\nAnd underground, VICE GRIP had the pillbug DRILL BIT digging t=\r\nhrough, going to breka through first to be the decoy while he would be the =\r\nmuscle just up behind!\n\n\n"}}
