His answer came \nas he saw her body glow through one of her wounds he saw the bright \nglow of her spark forming. He pulled the wound open a little and the \nspark exited and floated before him.\n\nLunarpine extended his hand, the spark seemed to read his thoughts \nand landed in it. The wolfbot removed the wire attached to her \nlifeless body and touched it to the spark. It glowed more brightly, \nHe could feel it&#39;s power circulating through him. He looked down at \nthe hole he&#39;d ripped in himself. the spark again seemed to read his \nthoughts and hovered down to the wound. Gently he nudged it inside. \n\nHe thought back to thier sparring sessions, his words were clear as \nif he&#39;d only said them moments ago. &quot;If you can&#39;t protect your spark \nthen I&#39;ll do it for you.&quot; He&#39;d made her a promise and he&#39;d keep it or \nface the pit for his failure.\n\n\n"}}
