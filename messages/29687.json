He looks at Strafe as he tests out his\n&gt; various modes, truly \n&gt; impressed. The CR chamber had recorded the bot&#39;s\n&gt; superstructure, but \n&gt; Fliq hadn&#39;t gone through it yet. Seeing a live show\n&gt; was always better \n&gt; anyways.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re welcome on the repairs, and yeah, defectors\n&gt; are welcome,&quot; he \n&gt; says, turning around and walking toward Iron\n&gt; Raptor&#39;s location. In \n&gt; extreme cases, Fliq knew he couldn&#39;t stand a chance\n&gt; against this bot, \n&gt; but Iron Raptor probably would, and so would Prowl\n&gt; if he was with her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Follow me, I&#39;ll take you to the commander,&quot; he says\n&gt; over his \n&gt; shoulder, motioning for Strafe to follow.\n\nStrafe followed, silently, looking down at Fliq. \n\n&quot;And who exactly is the Commander?&quot; he asked.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
