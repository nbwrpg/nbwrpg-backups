I was not really \ncontrolling Soundwave. If I had to wait for him to do every little \nthing it would not get very far. I know better than to say what \nSoundwave looked like, or to control him in a fight. As for the Super-\nPowerful thing, I will trim him down a bit. But if TM2 did all that \nawesome stuff to Cheetor, TM3 has to go past that. I hope this cleans \neverything up.&quot;)\n\nAs Vulois is talking to the Bat Predacon, another insect predacon \ncomes flying and starts shooting at Vulois. He moves to the back of \nthe wall and says something to the Bat Pred.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be back. Think about what I said.&quot;\n\nVulois started down the vent with the machine, hoping no Preds \nfollowed him.\n\n\n"}}
