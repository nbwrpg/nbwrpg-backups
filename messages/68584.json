Before the smoke cleared, he swung\n&gt; his chain sword at Myrmidon and fired at perceptor with his rifle. \n&gt; When the smoke thinned enough, one could see the damage visibly\n&gt; repairing itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Heh, that felt kinda good.  Do it again, it might tickle.&quot;\n\nAs soon as the motar blast knocked Malice back Myrmidon sprang into\naction! He knew Malice to be a more formidable fighter than he had let\non . . . but then again so was Myrmidon. Myrmidon had only hit him with\nenough force to set him back, testing the durability of this opponant.\nThe fact that Malice had been able to absorb the energy from the\nshielding was not lost on him as he moved to the side, the swooshing\nnoise from inside the smoke told him that swinging. Switching to\ntracking sensors allowed him to pierce the smoke as if it wasn&#39;t there,\nand see the comming attack . . . \n\n**CLANG!!**\n\n. . . With graceful movements Myrmidon dodged underneath the rather\nclumsy swing of the chain sword, the last of it bouncing of his sword. \n\nThe sword he used bore a rather disturbing resemblance to a klingon\nbatleth as he swung it through the air, (not that TF&#39;s would know a\nbatleth from a hand grenade but hey!) As Myrmidon brought it around\npinned to his arm he deflected that last of Malice&#39;s attack, swinging\nit back around and up!\n \nAs Myrmidon came back to a ready stance he could clearly see Malice&#39;s\nhealing and was not in the slightest bit impressed. Malice was not the\nonly one with that ability, Myrmidon was designed to . . . to . . . it\nstill eluded him.\n\nWithout a pause he continued to swing, so that as Malice stepped foward\nto say something foolish sounding, but it was not Myrmidon&#39;s face he\nmet, but the jutting edge of his blade!\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
