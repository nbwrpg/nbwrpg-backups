If \nyou give \n&gt; them what they want then they know what to expect. It isn&#39;t fun that \nway. If \n&gt; you use what we know from G1 and BW and make changes and stuff then \nthats \n&gt; okay becuase you still leave room for unpredicted stuff. But I agree \nwith KSL \n&gt; in saying the RPGs demise is coming close if the Monotomoy isnt \nbroken soon. \n&gt; You can only fight in the same place with the same people for so \nlong before \n&gt; its not fun anymore.\n\n\n"}}
