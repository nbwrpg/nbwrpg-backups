Inside are five rogue bots who \nhave come here for an important purpose. The ship begins to descend \ninto the atmosphere. They try to come in for a peaceful landing in \nwhat would later become Bejing China, but the pilot miscalculated the \nland and their engines scraped along a huge boulder, leaving them \ninoperable. The ship lands with a small thud, now stuck. After a bit \nof yelling and blame, they activate the DNA Sample&#39;s they had \npreviuosly collected. They emerge out of the ship and greet the day.\n\n&quot;What a great day for the trainers!!!&quot;\n\nThe 5 bots, Prebon, Hammer, Blaze, Bullet and Ingnatius, or \ncollectivly called The Trainers, have arrived on Past Earth. Prebon \nleads, with the form of a Tick. Hammer is second, with the form of a \nbuffalo. Tracking Officer Blaze has the form of a Bengal. Bullet, the \nsecurity officer, has the form of a Grizzly Bear. And finaly, \nIgnatius, the surveilance officer, has the form of an Eagle.\n\n&quot;Yes!&quot; shouted Prebon, &quot;Now we can harness the monsters energy and \nuse it to cause moe pain than ever before. Come all! Inside! We start \nthe search for the monster Savage in the morning!&quot;\n\nThe Trainers have come to tame Savage, and use his force for their \nwill. But the Trainers have another ability. To join together into \nthe great robot Tamron. With his use Gaitling Guns and missle \nlaunchers, combined with Savage, nothing will stand in their way.\n\n\n"}}
