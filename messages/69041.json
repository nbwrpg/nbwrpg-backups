After a short moment lights begin to flicker as power is applied. Inside the door closes, and there is a hissing noise as atmoshere is voided. Inside the chamber the figure fades from view as the previously transparent plexiglass on parts of the door turn a distinctivly darker shade. \n\n&quot;Now . . . &quot; Vorpal says to his Darkfate &quot;I am transfering the technological essence of Cyclonus, Scourge and Rodimus into this new creation. Each one of them has abilities and specialities that make him unique. We will use these to make a new leader for the minions on the earth, one that is under MY absolute control. He will lead you to victory, and lead me to my ultimate glory under Unicron.&quot;\n\nThe regeneration chambers that house Cyclonus, Scourge and Rodimus began to glow . . . \n\n(TAG: Darkfate, Perceptor)\n\n(OOC: Is the hole Perceptor dug to get here, big enough for the Maximals to climb through as well???)\n\nPreston\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
