He didnt want to be against them.  Bigfish also liked \nthe idea \n&gt; of fighting other bots, this excited Bigfish.  He swam up to the \nbot known \n&gt; as DevilDuer.  a stream of bubbles flowed behind him.  DevilDuer \nlooked calm \n&gt; and very pord of himself.  Bigfish new this was the clan to be \nin.  &quot;I \n&gt; except your offer DevilDuer. I want to join you and be apart of The \n&gt; Alliance. I will be loyal to your leader and obay all orders.&quot; \nBigfish bowed \n&gt; his head very slitly to show his respect.\n\n\n"}}
