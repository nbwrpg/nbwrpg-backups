Diskus, nice attack, Doom Ice, you were amazing,\n&gt; Artist, you sucked! You got blown around, making stupid phone calls, and\n&gt; generally been letting your ego get to you!&quot; Deemos yelled.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Deemos! I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t mean anything!&quot; Artist complained.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Too bad, you screwed up, come with me! Oh, yeah, Infectra, throw\nAirbomber\n&gt; out, he&#39;s of no use to me anymore!&quot; Deemos said. Airbomber hled his head\nin\n&gt; pain and fell onto the ground. He showed all of the signs of death.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Looks like you don&#39;t have to worry about him.&quot; Deemos said. Deemos and\n&gt; Artist walked to a secluded area, around the base where nobody was\nlooking.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Okay, what do I have to do?&quot; Artist asked.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;v ebeen thinking, what you have to do is...die.&quot; Deemos said. Artist\n&gt; looked at Deemos to try and get out of this, but Deemos raised a claw and\n&gt; smashed it into Artist. It went right through. Artist was brought to his\n&gt; knees.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You failed, and I am not as forgiving as that idiot Megatron.&quot; Deemos\nsaid.\n&gt; He pulled out rifle and shot Artist with it, in the head. Artist didn&#39;t\nhave\n&gt; time to react before Deemos pulled a hand full of wires from his back and\n&gt; jerked out, ripping his spark out and leaving gore all over. He pushed a\n&gt; button on the claw and the spark exploded. Artist&#39;s hand reached out and\n&gt; grabbed a sparkle, then stopped moving.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Too compassionate.&quot; Deemos said. He dropped the wires, let the mech fluid\n&gt; run off of his fingers and slicing Artist up. He stored the piecesin a\n&gt; freezer and made note that it was a package that needed to be kept cold.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I hope all of you are hungry.&quot; Deemos said before walking inside of the\n&gt; base with mech fluid dripping off of his fingers. Doom Ice and Rizopas\n&gt; looked at each other. Stronghold and Blender both shrugged.

Iron Raptor is actually standing up by the window now. But\nyou\n&gt; might have not gotten the post that states that so maybe we can just say\n&gt; that Prowl stood up and went to her? Just a small bit that fixes it all\nup,\n&gt; huh?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor nodded but didn&#39;t turn and watch Arcangle and Silver Sting\n&gt; leave, listening but also watching her finger trace small designs on the\n&gt; glass of the window.\n&gt; Her mind was still reeling about Arcangles plan, thinking of just what she\n&gt; needed to do to pull it off smoothly. She already knew that they needed to\n&gt; repair the Ark and get those engines set up and online before they even\n&gt; thought of placing the Autobots in it. Not to mention they needed Iris to\n&gt; make up the proper auto-pilot system for the flight into the Earth&#39;s\norbit,\n&gt; something that was going to be the toughest part of this mission yet.\n&gt; Iron Raptor shook her head slightly, there was so much to do and so much\nto\n&gt; worry about. In all her life she had never been so busy.\n&gt; But then Felines voice broke through her concentration, tilting her head\n&gt; slightly in the fembots direction as she listened to her speak.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I don&#39;t need to forgive you for anything, Feline. You have problems and\n&gt; we&#39;ll just have to work around them until you bring them to an\n&gt; understanding.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then watched Feline exit the room in the corner of her eye, then\n&gt; turning her head and looking out of the window again with a sigh. Her mind\n&gt; going back to the mission at hand as well as the one they had to get down\nto\n&gt; as soon as they got back.\n&gt; Either mission couldn&#39;t be too difficult, she had to admit that there were\na\n&gt; fair amount of events that could go wrong but they would work around them.\n&gt; But then she heard Felines dainty foot-steps again, wondering just why the\n&gt; fembot was returning for. But once she heard Feline speak she knew.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Room 6-20 and just up from the hallway where the armory is located. You\n&gt; can&#39;t miss it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor had actually paid attention to where Prowl had taken her\nafter\n&gt; her Alliance ordeal, looking at the details of the rooms she passed and\n&gt; making note of their locations.\n&gt; But now there were more important things to worry about, like thinking\nabout\n&gt; the condition of Tavatron and Dinobot when they found them. Thinking about\n&gt; how close they would be to the Alliance base and how attack was more\nlikely\n&gt; then anything else, lucky as hell if they weren&#39;t.\n&gt; Though, as her finger traced another pattern in the glass she felt a hand\n&gt; slip around her but knew whom it was. She would always know Prowl&#39;s touch,\n&gt; and the feel of it nearly made her forget that he had gotten her back with\n&gt; an insult that had gone just a little bit too far.\n&gt; Iron Raptor&#39;s optics narrowed at the thought of that insult, knowing that\n&gt; she really wasn&#39;t angry about it but a woman&#39;s weight was a touchy thing\nand\n&gt; she didn&#39;t like it made fun of. Though, her revenge for that insult wasn&#39;t\n&gt; through yet.\n&gt; But when she heard Prowl speak and looked up seeing her own reflection in\n&gt; the glass but actually looking at Prowls. *\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Yes. I&#39;m going with Arangles plan. It&#39;s fairly clever if you think about\n&gt; it long enough, and has a very high possibility of actually working.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Her mind was wondering again from the thoughts about their missions,\n&gt; actually dwelling on the feel of his touch instead of them. But then she\n&gt; shook her head slightly to clear it, reminding herself that she was still\nin\n&gt; the process of making him pay for that insult.\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked down at his hand on her waist and then up at him, her\n&gt; expression being that of a look that reflected her words. *\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; And just what do you think YOU&#39;RE doing?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She put a hand on her hip and the other on his that was on her waist,\nher\n&gt; fingers working to pry each one of his from the grasp her had on her. *\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; &#39;Heavy as a TRUCK,&#39; huh? Well, you think you can just come over here and\n&gt; touch me like this? I think not.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * At the last word she finally pried his hand free and let it fall, then\n&gt; taking a few steps away from him and walked over to the projector and\nturned\n&gt; it off. Making sure that she swung her hips a bit while she had walked to\n&gt; tease him. *\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re going to pay for the insult, Mister. And this is your\n&gt; punishment.until you learn you lesson.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * And it was, that he wasn&#39;t allowed to touch her for a little bit. Of\n&gt; course she would stop once he learned his lesson, slag knew that she\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to keep this up forever. *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
