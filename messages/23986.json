Who is \nhe, and \n&gt; what side is he on?\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tankkor, with the bot on him, sending bolts of electricity \nthrough \n&gt; him, suddenly transforms into his bot mode, sending Endbringer \nrolling away \n&gt; from him. As smoke rises out of his armor, Tankkor begins a slow \nmarch towrds \n&gt; endbringer, with a slight limp. He raises his right arm and shoots \nout a \n&gt; series of pulses at Endbringer, while his internal computer \ncalculates its \n&gt; next move.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Paralysis now inhales this bots very spark. He is so close \nhe can \n&gt; taste the exhaust overload from his mech pump. There, suddenly, he \nsee&#39;s a \n&gt; whif of the exhaust in midair. In the cold of the artic it appeared \nto be \n&gt; steam. At least it gave him a chance at this invisable foe.\n&gt;        &quot;Scather, I should have known.&quot; He said, with intense \nreptilian eyes \n&gt; locked on the small exhaust that came and dissloved every few \nmoment. He \n&gt; would have to be quick, He didnt know what the invisable bot was \nholding.\n&gt;        With as much quickness as he could produce, Paralysis ripped \nhis \n&gt; pistol from his holster and fired three shots at the exhaust, and \nthen \n&gt; bracing himself for wahtever Scather was going to throw back at him.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Rampage yelled in pain as the claws sunk in, his arms \nreleased the \n&gt; legs and now he used his crab legs mounted on his back to stab the \nlarger \n&gt; bots claw. Wriggling hard, Rampage looked at his missle launcher \nonly a few \n&gt; feet away.\n&gt;        Inferno dove down, and kicked it over to the crab, still in \nthe bizzar \n&gt; dance with the enemy. He gave his hoarse laugh and sent several \nfire balls at \n&gt; the bot as Ramapge fianally grasped his weapon.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        Megatron watched the icons from the 3 demensional map. He \nwas going to \n&gt; send reinforcements, Aerostreak and Quasar prehaps...\n&gt;        &quot;Quasar, do you think you could help with our current \nsituation?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        Hell Beast and Gremlin made the returning trip from the \nlarge lake. \n&gt; They had recived Megatrons message of the ambush, and as they \ntrudged trhough \n&gt; the snow, stumbling on it wouldnt be hard. In the distance they saw \nthe \n&gt; lights of the crossfire, and looking at Gremlin Hell Beast nodded.\n&gt;        &quot;Load your pistol. We might as well help out, seeing as if \nwe dont \n&gt; they mountian base is the next target.&quot;\n&gt;        Guns ready they moved forward to engage.\n\n\n"}}
