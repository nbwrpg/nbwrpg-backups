He leveled his rifle and fired a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; careful shot in the beast&#39;s path only fet in front of him, then a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; follow up shot behind it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s far\n enough, Predacon. If you put your paws up I won&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; immediatly kill you.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@gmail. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, March 10, 2008 1:13:46 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Black Fortress/Mesagge to Lord Perseus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As soon as Trelos was outside, he immediately returned to beast &lt;BR&gt;mode&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and started running as fast as he could around the perimeter of &lt;BR&gt;the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; base looking for enemies, looking for anything alive that he could&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sink his teeth into.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; On Sun, Mar 9, 2008 at 11:10 PM, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@gmail. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;........&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Only static on the comlink.
