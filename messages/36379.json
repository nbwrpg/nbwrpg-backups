He looked around the room, A\ndim light from the emergency flashers filled the room. The base was now on\nreserve power and he was trapped inside until the system reset. He opened a\ncomm again, &quot;I&#39;d love to come out, but unfortunately the doors are stuck,\nI&#39;d apreciate it if you&#39;d send a rescue party.&quot; The bot hated being so\npolite but he knew he had no choice, if he was rude there wouldn&#39;t be enough\nleft of the base, or him, to capture.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Legendarynemasis@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, June 04, 2001 11:44 AM\nSubject: Re: ATTACK!\n\n\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I just added the ship info. as part of the Trainer origin, it could\n&gt; be a prototype of the same ship, or it could have been an early model\n&gt; that was later advanced and eventually got the technology from\n&gt; somewhere.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Vile Cannon struck the shields shorting out the generator\n&gt; powering it. Three more anchors snapped and the base rocked into the\n&gt; air and crashed down causing a gust of sand to rise through the air.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Inside the base Ignatius fell from his seat and struck the console\n&gt; with a loud clang. his head was dented but other than that he was\n&gt; fine. He regained his composure trying to think of a way out of the\n&gt; predicament. The only solution was surender.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This is the Trainer Base, I offer you my unconditional surrender.&quot;\n&gt; He turned down the automatic defenses and released the blast doors\n&gt; making no obstacle to stop the attackers from entering.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shots from everywhere struck the Trainer Base causing stress\n&gt; fractures in the frame. Ignatius didn&#39;t know that there were two\n&gt; forces outside he just knew that if his choices were death or\n&gt; surrender he chose to live.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vile laughed evily as he heard Ignatius surrender, but to who? Vile\n&gt; did not know and was not going to take the chance of losinga new base\n&gt; so early. He decided then and there that he was going to win this\n&gt; battle. Finally he pressed a green button that caused his voice to\n&gt; boom outside the ship from loud speakers, the message going to all\n&gt; the Predacons and Destrons outside and the trianers base.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vile: &quot;This is Commander Vile of the Vile Force, the most eltire task\n&gt; force of the X-Predacons. All people here who are not affiliated with\n&gt; this base are to leave immediately, it is now under our control. All\n&gt; people within the base come out when I say so. As for the attackers\n&gt; of this base other than us... your battle for this base is over, you\n&gt; have lost. Leave here now... or else we will destroy you and this\n&gt; base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; And with that Vile closed the message to everyone, a few seconds\n&gt; later all the missiles that had been fired relaoded into their\n&gt; missile pods and the Vile Cannon began to charge once more.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
