He watches attentively a=\r\nnd at that moment, the creature lifts its head. It was another dragon. Yet =\r\nthis one was a bit smaller than he was, but the same coloration. He takes n=\r\note of its slender shape. It was female. She looks to him as he looks to he=\r\nr. She slowly approaches him and they look gently to each other like brothe=\r\nr and sister.

I know exactly how you feel. I feel the same way. At one time, =\r\nI was blind, rolled on four wheels and I always seemed to be an Autobot reb=\r\nel. I fought along side with my comrades but I wasn&#39;t good at following ord=\r\ners. I was well grounded but lost at the same time. Then, I met you and thi=\r\nngs began to change on a more positive note. You may not believe this, but =\r\nyou helped me to find my path, and you saw me on the right road and guided =\r\nme to my true fate. Soon afterwards, I became a Prime, acquired seventeen m=\r\nore wheels, and almost looked like Optimus Prime, yet different. But one th=\r\ning didn&#39;t change, I was still battling blindness off and on. Then, a third=\r\n change, due to extensive damage to my previous form, which could not be re=\r\npaired, I was guided to my final evolution, this one. All of\n&gt;  these thing=\r\ns wouldn&#39;t have come about if I had never met you. And I wouldn&#39;t have it a=\r\nny other way.
