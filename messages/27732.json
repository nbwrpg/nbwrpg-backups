He \nactivates his comm.\n\n&quot;Supernova, new orders,&quot; he says into it, &quot;Go to the following \ncoordinates and attack. Its a base, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to \nhandle it.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSupernova recieves the orders from Zardus, along with the coordinates \nof Hell Beast&#39;s new base. He sends an order to his team, and the \nScrap/Flare jet swoops down, Supernova jumping up and combining with \nthem. THe jet, now consisting of Scrap, Flare, and Supernova, turns \naround, heading for Hell Beast&#39;s base. The Vicir/Slasys jet turns \nalso, following the rest of the Galactors.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Black Aracnia looked to the other Predacons after they had \nlanded the \n&gt; transports containing the Ice Caves computer systems in the new HQ. \nTHe \n&gt; Predacons were gathered under the largest of the transports.\n&gt;        &quot;Alright, were heading out to the CF to help Hell Beast. On \nthey way \n&gt; we picked up an Allience transmission. Looks like theyre sending in \na calvary \n&gt; of there own.&quot; She said, armed.\n&gt;        Tarantulas gave a brief chuckle. &quot;And who made you leader?&quot; \nHis \n&gt; crimsom eyes were narrowed down to menacing slits.\n&gt;        Aracnia ignored him. &quot;Arm yourselfs. This is going to get \nvery, very \n&gt; messy.&quot;\n&gt;        Adrax, Aerostreak, Aquarious, Black Aracnia, Gremlin, \nJackle, \n&gt; Paddletail, Pheniox, Tankkor, and Tarantulas headed out, there \ndestination \n&gt; was the Cybertronian Fire and Maximal defeat was thier goal.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        Ominous Prime paced the table. He had failed miserable \nagianst the \n&gt; Maximals....and he had made enemies. He didnt care that the \nPredacons had \n&gt; vowed for revenge, it was the fact that of all the factions he \ncould be \n&gt; defeated by, it had to be the Maximals. Revenge was definet.\n&gt;        &quot;I can see the CF is under heavy fire. It seems like a ripe \n&gt; oppertunity to not only seek revenge on the Maximals, but the \nPredacons are \n&gt; heading there as well.&quot; Putnam said, looking at the scans.\n&gt;        Ominous nodded.  WIthin minutes the 6 Energonians were \nairborne and \n&gt; directed towrds the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n\n"}}
