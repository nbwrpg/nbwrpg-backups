With a deft movement he activated the console that up to a\nfew moments ago Legacy had been using. Data began to once again scroll\nacross his screen.\n\nTurning back to his console Bump also got back to work, his fingers\nmoving smoothly over the buttons. He was adding some code while\nchanging others. It would be a tricky undertaking. The screen began to\nchange as the coding was swiftly modified.\n\nLooking over at Perceptor Legacy watched the ex Predacon for a long\nmoment before speaking, &quot;If what you are saying is correct then what\nwe are attempting stands an 89.117% chance of success.&quot; His single\noptic pulse once, &quot;However if you are wrong, then what we are\nattempting may meet with initial success, but there is a signifigant\nchance that the original corrupted Predacon subroutines will\nregenerate.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
