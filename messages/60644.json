She turned \nto Necross and splattercannon and told them to pull him to his feet \nas she lessened the gravity holding him down.  The males obeyed and \npulled Malice up roughly.  The bounty hunter leaned against \nSplattercannon as the sudden climbing to his feet made him a little \nlight headed.  He stood up straight and tried to look behind him, \nbecause he couldn&#39;t see that mischevious Hellplague and that was \ncause for worry.  The Sweep commander shoo-ed away Necross and \nSplattercannon as she wrapped her arms around Malice&#39;s waist.   The \nmales obeyed with hesitation, while Necross left the room entirely, \nSplattercannon took position by the door.  Malice looked at the arms \naround his waist and looked back at the femme biehind him.  It was \nat this time he actually noticed, she was kinda pretty.  She looked\n&gt;  like a Generation One Decepticon, only with no insignia.  But the \nthough passed out of his mind as quickly as it entered.\n&gt; &quot;&#39;Scuse me, but I fel I must tell you something.  I&#39;m taken.  A \nlittle Maxi down there is waiting on me.&quot;\n&gt; The Minion did not speak, but walked around in front of Malice, \nher arms still around his waist.  \n&gt; &quot;Well she&#39;s down there, and I&#39;m right here in front of you.  \nBesides, I can offer you more than that Maximal-&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Maxitron actually,&quot; the hunter corrected,&quot;it seems she was dumped \nhere on accident while dealing with her universe&#39;s Unicron.&quot; he \nadded with a grin.\n&gt; &quot;Whatever.  It doesn&#39;t matter, my pet WILL come around and accept \nme.  Blacknightmare-&quot; Hellplague said as she let go of Malice and \nshoved him back to the bed,&quot;Make him &#39;comfortable&#39;.&quot; she said with a \nseductive grin.\n&gt; &quot;I need to ready some equipment then we can begin.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNightmare:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;YEa it&#39;s true&quot;said the femme &quot;But I didn&#39;t decided to have that \n&gt; dangerous pet&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Splattercannon:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You just worry about yourself.
