Already he was making a good impression upon \nher by his kind words and hospitality.\nShe gave him a kind look.*\n\n� Of course I approve. And I can�t thank you enough for letting the Maximal \nforce and I take up shelter here. We�re very grateful. And if you need \nanything, anything at all, simply come to me and I�ll make sure that it�s \ndone.�\n\n* A warm smile creased her lips as she looked at him a moment longer, then \nturning her gaze towards Battera as she waited in the door way. She took a \nstep towards her but then the fembot came to her with what she had been sent \nthere to tell her, it being more important then she had realized it could \never be.\nPeace talks!\nJust then Iron Raptor saw Prowl move in the corner of her eye but then \nslightly side stepped to assure that his arm didn�t slip around her, knowing \nthat he was going to learn his lesson about teasing.\nA low growl flowed from her throat as she had moved from Prowls advance, \nbasically saying that he still wasn�t allowed to touch her�yet.\nBut her expression didn�t change, still calm and slightly cheerful as she \ncontinued to focus her attention on Battera.\n\nBut when Battera began to explain what she had come for, Iron Raptor�s \nexpression turned from kind to blank.\nShe thought that she was busy before�now she was required to accompany this \nbot and another to Peace Talks?\nIt was just one thing after another around here, wasn�t it?\nSlag! What she would do for one of Prowls relaxing embraces right about now.\nShe simply collected herself and stood up straight, her head then tilting to \nthe side for a moment in thought.*\n\n� Believe me, your offer to attend this Peace Embassy is very�tempting. But \nbefore I agree to go anywhere I need to know the place, time, who�s going to \nbe there, what I can expect to hear and how long will it take?�\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
