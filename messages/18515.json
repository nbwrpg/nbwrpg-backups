He aims at Grenade,\n&gt; firing 20 rapid shots at him.\n\nGrenade, who was still hovering, was hit by the twenty shots, and decends to\nthe ground with a growl, landing and slowly moving his blaster. Grenade\nslowed down under damage, unlike his comrades. He fired at Zardus, 3 slow\nmoving and powerful blasts.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Repressor jumps into the air, the shots passing under him, a few\n&gt; hitting his legs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Transforming into a helecopter and flying forward, rear boosters\n&gt; speeding him along as he fires two missiles, one heading for Gigas,\n&gt; the other for Horn Drill.\n\nHorn Drill dodges the missile, the explosion damaging his side. He fires up\nat Repressor with agression, 4 shots. Gigas was struck on the arm with the\nmissile, his arm becoming immobile. The slow moving bot fires a missile up\nat Repressor with his other arm.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Havoc gains altitude again, diving yet another time and dropping a\n&gt; bomb, this one heading at Beholder, mini-boosters proppeling it at\n&gt; him.\n\nBeholder throws a charge at the bomb, but it sticks to the bomb and the bomb\nrolls down to Beholder&#39;s feet with the charge on it. It explodes as Beholder\ntries to shield himself, blasting Beholder to the ground and the propulsion\nknocking him into a tree as he rolled.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
