To make it\nfair the system also prevents Veratis from using energy weapons.\n\nGrizzltron was faster than Veratis had anticipated, the bot had avoided his\ngrab and countered just as fast. The old scientist wasn&#39;t a slouch though\nand quickly recovered. Grizzltrons sword nearly connected but Veratis&#39; agile\nhalf bat form glided backward avoiding the slash. &quot;I give you one last\nchance to act in a civilized manner before I stop you.&quot; The scientist\nappalled violence in his home and wanted nothing more than common courtesy.\n&quot;So what&#39;ll it be? will you calm down or do I take you down?&quot; the old bot\nhovered inches from the ground prepared to fight if necessary, his beady bat\neyes watched for movement while his snout constantly sent out sonar waves\ntelling him where Grizzletron was at all times. his claws were held in front\nof him in a judo like stance, his wings beat softly keeping him aloft, his\nlong half robotic legs hung below him slightly bent ready to push him\nwhichever way he needed to go. He&#39;d been in to many fights in his long life\nto not know what he was doing and he intended to show the opponent that he\nmeant business.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Proto [ &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, July 09, 2001 8:37 AM\nSubject: Re: old but still strong.\n\n\n�Grizzltron�\n\n\n   Grizzltron was amazed by the strength of this older bot.
