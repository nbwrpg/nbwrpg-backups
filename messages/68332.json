Even the l=\r\narge crater\n&gt; that housed the main complex of buildings the once small grou=\r\np has\n&gt; grown and connected, and they fairly glow with suppressed power. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Large engines moved drilling down to the lunar core to extract the\n&gt; en=\r\nergy located there, as panes of reflective material are directed \nat\n&gt; the =\r\nsun to collect the solar power that shines through the openness \nof\n&gt; space=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; Within one of the buildings Cyclonus stood at the forefront of a \nv=\r\nast\n&gt; chamber, its doors were standing open to the current darkness of \nspa=\r\nce,\n&gt; stars winked and flickered in the distance. The walls of this \nchambe=\r\nr\n&gt; are constructed from metal and stone. Large lights lit the area\n&gt; brigh=\r\ntly from above and along the walls, the faintly crimson hue of \nthe\n&gt; walls=\r\n giving this room a slightly eerie feel as the light spills out\n&gt; into the =\r\nopen air.\n&gt; \n&gt; But rather than looking at the chamber itself he was standin=\r\ng with \nhis\n&gt; arms clasped behind his back looking out of the skies as he\n&gt;=\r\n contemplated the up coming event, a satisfied look on his face. \n&gt; \n&gt; Scou=\r\nrge walked up to stand next to him, &quot;All things are in readiness\n&gt; Cyclonus=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The minion herald nodded, &quot;I have all the information that we need.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What of the new ones that you created, will they be there as well?&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; Scourge asked as he stood next to his commander and friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonu=\r\ns shook his head slightly, &quot;Let us just say they have their \nown\n&gt; mission =\r\nto fulfill.&quot; Cyclonus glanced at Scourge, &quot;If we need them, \nwe\n&gt; will have=\r\n them in reserve.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Scourge nodded as he smiled eagerly. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus=\r\n turned to look at the chamber and the large numbers of \nsweeps\n&gt; that were=\r\n entering it and for the first time in quite sometime he\n&gt; smiled. Without =\r\nturning he spoke to Scourge, &quot;Give the order.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Scourge nodded and then=\r\n stepped forward, &quot;MINIONS OF UNICRON!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The entire legion that paraded=\r\n itself before them came to a stop, a\n&gt; vast company of sweeps turned to th=\r\ne front in anticipation. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;IT IS TIME TO TAKE TO THE AIR, TO ESTABLISH=\r\n OURSELVES ON THIS \nPLANET\n&gt; BELOW, TO MAKE THEM FEEL OUR WEIGHT, OUR MIGHT=\r\n, TO MAKE THEM FEEL\n&gt; FEAR!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As one the sweeps came to a ready positio=\r\nn as the stowed their \nweapons.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;MINIONS . . . TRANSFORM!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wi=\r\nth a deafening sound all the sweeps shifted form as Scourge did \nthe\n&gt; same=\r\n, hovering in mid air. &quot;MINIONS . . .  TO THE AIR . . .  AND \nON ...\n&gt; TO .=\r\n.. VICTORYYYY!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that Scourge moved higher into the skies as th=\r\ne large numbers \nof\n&gt; sweeps headed into the blackness of space. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cycl=\r\nonus, stood on the floor as he watched them take to the air, his\n&gt; face bea=\r\nming as he looked on. As the last one left the hanger and it\n&gt; all became q=\r\nuiet he too took to the air, transformed with a flare of\n&gt; tremendous power=\r\n flew up and took his place at the head of the \ngroup. \n&gt; \n&gt; With a massive=\r\n burst of power the host took flight, left the moon, \nand\n&gt; like some black=\r\n arrow of death moved toward the earth!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n___________=\r\n___________________________________________________________\n______________\n=\r\n&gt; Never miss a thing.
