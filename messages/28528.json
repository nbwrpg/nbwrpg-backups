Ice had an idea though. her\nability to ability to weaken machinery could come in handy. She began to\nconcentrate when she picked up strong emotions of fear, confusion, and\nloneliness coming from the forrest in the distance. &quot;I&#39;m getting something,&quot;\nshe said trying to make sense of it. she&#39;d held her telepathy in check for\nthe most part until now. She couldn&#39;t communicate at that distance so she&#39;d\nhave to try something else. She went back to concentrating on the shields.\n&quot;I don&#39;t know if this will work. It&#39;ll either damage the shields worse or do\nnothing at all.&quot;\n\nLunarpine contemplated the odds. &quot;It&#39;ll be a long shot but at least we&#39;ll be\ndoing something.&quot;\n\nIce focused her strength on the shields in front of her. &quot;When I say go we\nmove.&quot; her paws started to glow, she raised her left and pointed, then her\nright. A jolt of power launched forward striking the shield. &quot;GO&quot; she yelled\nto her partner.\n\nLunarpine dashed forward hitting the shield hard, he could tell it was weak\nand a sudden push forced him through. Ice had used her telekinetics to give\nhim the push he needed. The wolfbot was free but Ice was still inside.\n\n&quot;Get going, head for the forrest and find it.&quot; Ice instructed rather sure of\nherself, She didn&#39;t know what she fealt she was just sure it was alone and\nfrightened.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Moon Mist &lt;shadowwarrior_ax@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 26, 2001 6:11 PM\nSubject: Baby\n\n\n\nBB: Sorry I haven&#39;t been online. My cabin burnt and my computer went with\nit.\n\n3 days ago BrightBlade had died of a disease  in the forests surrounding the\nCybertronean Fire, her body left to rot with the surrounding leafs.\nBut even her death wasn&#39;t for nothing. She&#39;d died after days and nights of\nhard labor, trying to keep her little treasure alive.\nSomehow, someway, her systems had created a child that had grown inside of\nher until, at the weakest point, it was born.\nA blind, tiny kit that could fit in the palm of a human hand, a baby girl\nwith a mother already diseased and ready to die.\nAnd so she had, leaving the baby to suckle whatever milk was left in her\nbody before she stopped producing and it dried up.\nBut now the milk was gone, BrightBlade&#39;s body already beginning to rot, and\nthe little baby slightly weak from malnutrition.\nTiny as she was, still so young and blind, she&#39;d managed to hang on this\nlong with a hungry tummy. Every sound causing her to whine and cry, little\nyipps filling the forest whenever the wind picked up.  Too young to be\nfrightened, all she ever did was crawl around her mother&#39;s body, urged close\nby her familiar scent even when hunger gnawed.\nBut today the rank smell of BrightBlade&#39;s body masked her scent and the\nlittle kit was confused, bleating for her mother as she slowly crawled on\nher tummy away from the body, trying to find the smell of Mom.\nShe moved out towards the forest and the clearing beyond.\nBeing only 3 days old, her muscles worked in tiny spasms and she couldn&#39;t\ncontrol them beyond crawling, but always she was yipping and crying out,\nhoping for mother to hear her and come and get her. Remembering the furry\nside where life giving milk came from.\nBut her mother never came and she was getting cold, her tummy making little\nhungry sounds.\nEven though her eyes weren&#39;t open yet she could hear, and she shots coming\nfrom the clearing reminded her of the soft rumbles her mother made. So,\nthinking of her mother, she cried louder as she tried to hurry her crawling,\nlittle red coat spotted here and there with ash as she moved along the\nforest floor. Moving towards the battle at the maximal base. Covering no\nmore then 1-ï¿½ feet in 2 min.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
