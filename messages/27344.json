And had obviously failed in doing so.      Dinobot clenched his jaw and growled deeply within his chest before moving to slam his tail down towards the ground and then whip it straight out behind him, hoping that the velocity alone would rip it from it�s hold. This creature was strange and once it was destroyed he might take time to study it, since he need no longer to follow Maximal command and would not be in space.\r\nIt wasn�t that he felt no need to battle, but only felt that the Maximals were too incompetent to take up any of his time. They were nothing close to the Maximals of the past, the ones he remembered. They were now in so large a number that they thought of themselves at times which would not be recommended, however, still had the courage and stamina which depicted the Maximal force.     Though he still saw them as nothing to be desired to serve aside and no longer wished to participate in their failure. That decision was final.\r\nDinobot looked Tavatron over and wondered just what she would think about it once he had decided to tell her, yet coming to the conclusion that now would be the worst possible time to do so for the simple reason that something else was on her mind.  Something which seemed to be troubling her.       He sighed inwardly, wondering just when he had started caring about people and how their problems effected them. If any friend of the past saw him now they would think he had gone soft. And maybe he had, but he was still the sparkless slag he had always been 95% of the time.  But the thought was only a shadow in the back of his mind while his main systems were working to discover the source of Tavatron�s discomfort, since she had been talking to herself in the most puzzling way for the past twenty cycles. Which puzzled him to no end.\r\nDinobot snarled at Tavatron�s answer to his question, not accepting it at all. It was obvious to his senses and his eyes that she was anything but fine and she seemed to become more stressed every time he heard her speak to herself. Perhaps it was time Tavatron went in for repairs; maybe also repairing whatever problem that was causing her to seem almost insane. However, if it had been something to do with the mind, which it seemed to, it could go far deeper then damage.\r\nDinobot was also getting the impression that Tavatron was, thus, keeping something from him, something important that she thought he had no need to know of. But it was causing her to become disoriented as she was; it might be a wiser choice to talk. But now Tavatron had risen to her feet but was leaning rather heavily upon her staff; only enforcing the fact that she should tell him what was troubling her.  It was enough to keep his attention on her to make damn sure she didn�t fall, and since was enough to do that the time of secrets was over.\r\nDinobot moved so that he came up beside Tavatron, looking off in the direction of the desert and remembered a land past the sand, which held quiet places. A more likely direction in which to take then his intended one, over the sea of sand to a place which was no stranger to him. However, he stood completely still so that Tavatron could reach out and use him to steady herself if she wished.** � We can leave this place if you want.� * He wanted to know what was wrong with her but felt that a more easy environment, with nothing to overhear but sand and trees, might make Tavatron more comfortable and willing to speak.  It was rather a thoughtful gesture but you�d never hear that from him.\r\nDinobot had planned to leave all along, but with Tavatron in this condition he wasn�t willing to go without her. Besides, there wasn�t a bot in any faction which knew her nearly as good as he and he had more of a chance to figure out just what Tavatron was going through if they were alone and there were no orders or other people to distract him.**\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
