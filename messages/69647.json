Whoops, I just posted for Rat Trap.  Tucson is still unconscio=\r\nus.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Hydras should be informed about the current situation in Maximal B=\r\nase&quot;replied the male while he was dragging Tucson &quot; and the female shouldl =\r\nbe moved to another place&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Perceptor replied &quot;She wont move to an=\r\ny place and whoever tries to free her for her cell, would be the indirect c=\r\nause of her death... But you are right, We have to move=A0 her to another s=\r\necure place&quot;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; &quot;Fine. Fine.&quot; Zarak said dismissively as he continued =\r\nto watch Tuscon&#39;s still form. &quot;Move the female maximal wherever you like, b=\r\nut Tuscon here will serve a purpose.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus stepped over to look at=\r\n Tuscon and then at Zarak, &quot;What are you planning?&quot; His tone suspicious.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Zarak chuckled, &quot;If we could use this one&#39;s likeness to Optimus Prime, w=\r\ne can use him to=A0give us the power of the matrix, and then WE can destroy=\r\n Unicron.&quot; Zarak rubbed his hands together eagerly, &quot;and then with the rema=\r\nining power take over this mud ball of a planet.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus nodded, &quot;Sc=\r\nourge, you&#39;re with us, Rodimus report to Hydras, no doubt you will be neede=\r\nd here to secure the base.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What?!?!&quot; Rodimus said, outraged at the =\r\nprospect of staying at the base, &quot;Who are YOU to tell ME what to do!&quot; as he=\r\n stepped up to Cyclonus, his optics blazing, his fists clenched.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scour=\r\nge stepped up behind Cyclonus, obviously backing up his commander, and read=\r\ny to take on Rodimus should he attack. \n&gt; \n&gt; Zarak for his part just smiled=\r\n, scenes like these just distracted others from him, and the question of wh=\r\nat his agenda was.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Sandy, I don&#39;t think Airly would mi=\r\nnd if you had Tuscon become conscious but mostly paralyzed, that way he cou=\r\nld maybe talk and listen, and interact if he liked? It=A0would give you RP =\r\npossibilities?? =A0In addition to the other things you had in mind :)\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nPreston\n&gt; (Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus/Zarak)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
