Why?&quot;\n\nSANTON scratched his head for a moment as he thought, &quot;It looks like\nit is the same thing that happened to human strains of flu and other\nviruses. As they interact with the enviornment around them they change\nand modify.&quot;\n\nThere was a pause from BUMP, &quot;Does that mean that this strain is more\nresistant to the cure?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; SANTON said. He glanced up at LEGACY who had just\nfinished entering his codes. &quot;What do you think?&quot;\n\nLEGACY stepped away from his panel as the program executed. &quot;Unknown,\nthis strain appears to be essentially the same.&quot; He said quietly. &quot;I\nhave replicated the antiviral injection just as prescribed and have\nadded other additional medicines.&quot; He said coldly. &quot;I would surmise\nthat it would be at least partially effective. However to what degree\nis difficult to quantify.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from BUMP, &quot;So it may cure them . . . &quot;\n\n&quot;. . . or it may do nothing at all.&quot; SANTON said as he realized the\nimport of their words.\n\nThere was a hissing sound as injection guns rose from the beds of\nTUSCON and UPROAR. Efficiently they fed both of them the &#39;cure&#39;.\n\nLEGACY, BUMP and SANTON looked at the vital signs readout and waited\nto see what the response would be.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
