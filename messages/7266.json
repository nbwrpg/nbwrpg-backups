This was going to be very suicidal, both of them \nprobably knew that. His eyes narrow as he sees Reptilica aproach the entrance.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll go in after him,&quot; Prowl says into his silencer, silently edging toward \nthe left side of the door.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica stops. Something was not right, he could feel it. He looks around, \nnot seeing anything.\n\nHe shruggs. Must be just stress. Or that punch from Perndabot. Reptilica \nturns back to the door, walking forward, the door opening for him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl carefully enters behind Reptilica, pressing himself against the left \nwall.\n\n&quot;Once we&#39;re in, we take the hallway to the brig. After the last few attempts \nto rescue them, they&#39;d be expecting us to waltz in and ask for Iron Raptor \nand Tav back,&quot; he says into his silencer, now completely inside the base, \n&quot;When we reach the brig, we need to knock out the guards before they sound \nthe alarm. Any weapon fire will instanly alert the scanners, and we&#39;d have a \nmess on our hands.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDark One laughs harshly as Iron Raptor tells Tavatron not to scream.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry, femm,&quot; he says, pushing her into the wall, energon beams coming \nup to restrain her, &quot;She&#39;ll scream.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPyro finishes strapping Tavatron to the table, looking at Dark One as he \nhears him laugh.\n\n&quot;Where&#39;s Nemesis?&quot; he asks, &quot;We need him for the torture.&quot;\n\n&quot;Out the door, slaggin&#39; a Maximal,&quot; Dark One replies, &quot;Go relieve him.&quot;\n\n&quot;But I&#39;ll miss this!&quot;\n\nDark One growls, &quot;You want to be on there instead of her,&quot; he asks, pointing \nto Tavatron.\n\nPyro steps back, &quot;On second thought, I think I&#39;ll slag some Maxi&#39;s.&quot;\n\nWith that, he walks out of the door. Several seconds later Nemesis Enforcer \nenters. He laughs evilly as he looks at Tavatron.\n\n&quot;I think I&#39;ll try an invention of mine here.....&quot; he pauses for impact, &quot;The \nPain Bug!&quot;\n\nNemesis walks over to a storage bin, looking inside it. He frowns.\n\n&quot;Its here somewhere,&quot; he says, rummaging through the devices in the bin.\n\n"}}
