Two, just because you don&#39;t like me and are jealous of Megan and I&#39;s friendship, you have no right to take it out on me in public form and if you were such a good person, you wouldn&#39;t let your personal emotions over-ride your brain and do something stupid like this. I&#39;ve read some of the stuff you&#39;ve said and they&#39;re just as&nbsp; &quot;sick and twisted&quot; as mine, hell, they&#39;ve been worse. If you have a problem with my spending time with megan or with the way I write my posts, then take it up with me and private and not in public. Do you understand? I am VERY angry with the way you handled this situation and I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if Megan was too! We work on my posts together as to not offend you, you have no right doing this to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
