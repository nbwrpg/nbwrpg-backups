The Maximals have defended \nthemselves. Unicron&#39;s minions have been destroyed. Rodimus has agreed \nto the alliance. They are preparing. Also, I dound a crashed bot on \nthe way back.

Now, \n&gt; Bloodblade, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is your turn to go, but I have learned from this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the pain stopped, he had forgotten who he was or who he \n&gt; &gt; served. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He only remembered his name.
