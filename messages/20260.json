Her left wing had fallen off.\n&gt; At joint, you could see the metal portion that would be bone, but\n&gt; that wasn&#39;t mech fluid that was leaking out onto the floor.  It was\n&gt; red, deep red, blood red. Instead of wired and metal joints, it was\n&gt; muscle and small, extremely tiny fiber wires.\n&gt;\n&gt; She lowered her front paw down and picked it up.  She looked at the\n&gt; wing in her paw.  She then turned her head to look at her shoulder.\n&gt; It was red, and the red fluid ran down her back and side. She looked\n&gt; at the wing again and then to Veratis, &quot;How...is this..possable?\n&gt; And...what does it mean?&quot; her voice was soft and inquisitive. She was\n&gt; confused and wanted answers.  She wasn&#39;t mad, or had fear, but wanted\n&gt; to know how and why?\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked at the wing in her paw,&quot;With out the wing, I am no longer\n&gt; Shadow Wing.
