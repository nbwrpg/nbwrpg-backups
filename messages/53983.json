She intensifies her panic grip on both her\nassailants, which diminishes her influence on Jayde and Noir. However,\nFury and Riekan would barely be able to move. It was fear she\ninstilled, and that was the only universal unstoppable weapon.\n\nShe raised her sword and the close range allowed her to strike\ndirectly at his throat.
