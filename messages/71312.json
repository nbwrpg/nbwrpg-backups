Friends find, look behind=\r\n!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; PROFILE:  An Autobot by the name of Wheelie grew up on a crashe=\r\nd ship,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; surviving for an unkonwn period of time on Quintessa.  Found b=\r\ny Autobots\n&gt; &gt;&gt; during the first Unicron crisis, he soon joined them and wa=\r\ns a stalwart\n&gt; &gt;&gt; part\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of their forces going alon gwith the first Maxi=\r\nmal Imperium after the war.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A loner often forming strong bonds adn fre=\r\nindships and with a unique sort\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; personality from his time spen=\r\nt in isolation and having to fight to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; survive,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie is often a=\r\nccompanied by his scrounger friend Gnaw, operating with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; local groups t=\r\nhat cna tolerate his infmay as he moves on.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ABILITIES:  A permane=\r\nnt glitch in his vocal processor developed by his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; long\n&gt; &gt;&gt; period in =\r\nisolation upon Quintessa, Wheelie&#39;s vocalizer tends to vocalize\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; ways in whatever linguistic dialect that are often translated as &#39;rhymes&#39;=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; These tend to be high pitched, grating, and annoying, and prolonged\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; exposure\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is held to be extremely damaging to one&#39;s circuits, much=\r\n like Cosmic Rust\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and Fire Suppressant Foam.  As such, the sight (or s=\r\nound) of Wheelie on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; battlefield is often enough to drive many=\r\n Predacons or Decepticons to flee\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and abandon the area.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whee=\r\nlie is armed with a small energon slingshot with a close range high\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ca=\r\npacity load that is capable of inflicting significant damage on larger\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Cybertronians.  His small alt mode of a Cybertronian racer has a top speed=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of 180 kilometers per hour and a range of over three thousand kilomet=\r\ners.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie himself is heavily energon efficient, even by Maximal sta=\r\nndard,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; his bodyframe is capable of extended independent funct=\r\nioning without\n&gt; &gt;&gt; refueling or repairs (which is the way many Maximals wo=\r\nuld profess to like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it), and is quite simplistic to maintain that even=\r\n Wheelie can keep\n&gt; &gt;&gt; himself\n&gt; &gt;&gt; basically functional without medical su=\r\npervision.  His small bodyframe is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; also quite agile and difficult to h=\r\nit, combined with his long vorns spent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; surviving have made him=\r\n quite surprisingly adept at escape and evasion,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; guerilla operations, =\r\nand reconaissance in urban or organic areas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Weaknesses:  Wh=\r\neelie has much of a reputation, deserved or not, among\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Autobots and De=\r\ncepticons.  While he can count some as staunch friends, his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ability to=\r\n seemingly inflict insanity to those in constant presence of his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; chatt=\r\nering has made many Autobots and Maximals wish to avoid prolonged\n&gt; &gt;&gt; inte=\r\nractions with him, and can lead to his constant solo operations in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n field without backup.  This has also lead to a constant but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unsubstan=\r\ntiated\n&gt; &gt;&gt; threats of violence to be inflicted upon him by his own faction=\r\n, depending\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on how casual the company is.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie&#39;s form, wh=\r\nile agile, is very small and very vulnerable, and lacks\n&gt; &gt;&gt; power.  He is =\r\nweak physically, and his primary weapon (an energon\n&gt; &gt;&gt; slingshot)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ha=\r\ns a very limited range, and even low powered energy weapons can inflict\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; significant damage upon him.  In a hand to hand fight he is seriously\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; vulnerable to damage and can take few hits.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; History:  Whee=\r\nlie spent unknown thousands of vorns as the only survivor of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; crashed ship upon Quintessa, where upon his rescue he became a stalwart\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; part\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the AUtobot forces, most often operating on long range re=\r\nconaissance\n&gt; &gt;&gt; missions or as backup to his friends.  After the Autobot/D=\r\necepticon War\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ended, and many of his friends went into retirement, Whe=\r\nelie was not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upgraded along with teh initial wave of Maximal upgrading=\r\n, preferring to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; keep his original body as a memory to those whom had b=\r\neen lost in the war.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Pending the end of the war, Wheelie&#39;s wherea=\r\nbouts became much fo a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mystery,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with various stories at any point=\r\n theorizing he had been killed in a back\n&gt; &gt;&gt; alley by Autobot/Decepticons =\r\n(most often accompanied by &#39;I&#39;LL DRINK TO\n&gt; &gt;&gt; THAT!&#39; in Maccadam&#39;s) to tha=\r\nt he was working with th Maximal Security\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Administration.  One theroy =\r\neven stated that he had been part of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Maximal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Experimentation =\r\nProgram that had produced Protoform X, simply stating that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; he was what=\r\n had driven the unit that would eventually call itself Rampage\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n total sociopathy and nihilism simply from being locked in a cell for the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; experiments!  Many would explain their decline to believe in Primus by\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; saying &#39;He made that guy, didn&#39;t he?&#39; and gesture to the MiniBot.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (Un)fortunately, Wheelie has been still functioning over the era, liv=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cybertron, often going on trips to search the galaxy and f=\r\nind more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; information.  While there, he would spend much of his time in=\r\n Little Iacon\n&gt; &gt;&gt; remiscing of the old days.  Upon attemptimg to join a cr=\r\naft, according to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; scuttleaft a Maximal hit upon the idea of sending hi=\r\nm along with Leo&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reinforcement crew to Earth.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Further scut=\r\ntleaft was hoping that by sending him several tens of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thousands\n&gt; &gt;&gt; o=\r\nf vorns back in time and to active military conflict would &#39;get the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; li=\r\nttle\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cans to be recycled&#39;, but were never actively confirmed as transf=\r\ner orders\n&gt; &gt;&gt; were sent.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
