He saw the three dinobots and it brought \nback flashes of bots. He saw Grimlock and a few other dinobots, he could only \nplace the name on Grimlock. He then awoke from the dream. \n    He looked down at the Cheetah, the cat reminded Primal of someone. He \njust couldn&#39;t place the name.\n    &quot;I am Primal, I&#39;m a new Maximal here, I take it you are also?&quot; He asked \nCheetor.
