It \njust\n&gt; twisted everything up. But, they weren&#39;t his troops and he had no\n&gt; standing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: THAT is definitely no rookie work. The way they land,\n&gt; they&#39;re experienced. It does remind me of Pred style, but it&#39;s\n&gt; different too.

Our ship is a distinctive one \nand \n&gt; &gt; has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connected officially with dozens of terrorist acts, \nincluding \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction of some important Tripredacus outposts.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Devilcat considers for a moment.  Activating his comlink, \nhe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; command to the Rogues: &quot;Everyone meet me in the command \n&gt; &gt; center - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stat!

Seems like a \nwarship \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since it&#39;s new, they might well have lots more where \nthey \n&gt; &gt; come \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That means they&#39;re not alone. As for personel, I can&#39;t \nsay \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fought Tripreds. But they might be elite, or they might \nbe \n&gt; &gt; green\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rookies that have been placed there to man the ship. \n&gt; &gt; However, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rookies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could not have landed the ship as successfully as they \njust \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is something else. The survivors of the first group \n&gt; &gt; probably \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to observe things here and I am convinced that they \nhave \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence on most people here. The newcomers now \nhave \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edge. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frontal assault is totally out of question.\n\n\n"}}
