She transformed into bot \nand walked on.  She went along until she could see a bot standing up \nin front of a cave.\nShe slowly walked forward.  Not wanting to alarm him, she spoke out \nto him,&quot;Hello, My name is KitKat.  My Companion is Terrorsaur. We \ncame under orders of Quickstrike to see you. May we approach?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Terrorsaur/Rowdy Wolf:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;From what I was told, bring him back to base.&quot; Terrorsaur replied \nto \n&gt; KitKat. &quot;I don&#39;t like the idea that he could blow our heads off \nthough. But \n&gt; I don&#39;t have an argument over a conflict.&quot; He laughed breifly.\n&gt; \n&gt; He put his scanners on, now passing the last marker. Ahead was a \nformation \n&gt; of a cave. Or what looked like one. This may be the wolf&#39;s shelter. \nHe \n&gt; transformed to robot mode and withdrew his gun. &quot;Stand-by.&quot; he said \nto \n&gt; KitKat through his comm-link. &quot;I think we&#39;re here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf turned his head and sniffed the air. &quot;I smell \nsomething,&quot; he said \n&gt; to Zyber. He lifted his lips from his upper row of teeth. &quot;More \nlike \n&gt; someone.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Rowdy Wolf, terrorize.&quot; he commanded his activation code. It was \nthe first \n&gt; time he transformed using the phase. He withdrew his rifle from \nunder his \n&gt; heavy furs, and stepped out of his cave.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
