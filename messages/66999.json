Or&lt;br&gt; worse, a Powermaster!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; BIC: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; As soon as Scorponok resurfaced, Deadfur received a report about it&lt;br&gt; from one of the Ground crew.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Deadfur: Alright, Remus. You want\n your chance, there it is! Go! [To&lt;br&gt; the command center] Can anybody get me Lord Razorwing?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But at the same time, the Airtankers arrived in visibility range of&lt;br&gt; the city. The fliers, seeing the newcomers, moved in to intercept, but&lt;br&gt; the attackers knew their stuff. Gunrain quickly dodged between the&lt;br&gt; fliers and took out a lot of the defenders with his multiple guns,&lt;br&gt; while Skysword did not even bother with dodging, rather preferring to&lt;br&gt; ram and slice his opponents with his sharp wings. Bombtube took to the&lt;br&gt; air, immediately attracting attention, but Lock-on gave him some cover&lt;br&gt; with her saturation missiles. Because of that, he managed to bombard&lt;br&gt; the shields, weakening them dangerously.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Motherload, however, was still behind, not fast enough to engage in&lt;br&gt; any kind of dogfight, but still armed enough to be left alone for the&lt;br&gt; moment.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Motherload: Is this it, My Lord? Are these all the city&#39;s defenses?&lt;br&gt; Why did you\n even bother us? I was going to trick them all and win the&lt;br&gt; jackpot this time!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Jotunn: Silence, Motherload. This is only the prelude. You will see&lt;br&gt; the reason I brought you here soon if Razorwing doesn&#39;t do what&#39;s&lt;br&gt; right for everyone.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; He pressed a button and opened a channel to Relay&#39;s command center.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Jotunn: Lord Razorwing, this is your last opportunity. You still have&lt;br&gt; a chance to spare millions of civilians and to keep your valiant&lt;br&gt; soldiers online. Surrender and we will not harm them.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; --- In &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.&lt;wbr&gt;com&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@&lt;wbr&gt;...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt; &gt; OOC: No. Once the Predacons arrived Scorponok jumped out to the&lt;br&gt; surface and transformed to robot mode with Zarak becoming the head.&lt;br&gt; Woot for me being the first to bring a Headmaster into NBW...
