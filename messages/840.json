Taking the opportunity, Zardus crouches, pulls out his own \ngun, and fires off several shots at the traitor&#39;s chest. FZ stumbles \nback, right into Nemesis&#39; and Zergling&#39;s swords. He slides off the \nswords and falls to the ground, his eyes going blank.\n\nZardus looks down at the still form of FZ. &quot;Thank you, Nemesis, \nZergling.&quot; He says.\n\n&quot;Take his weapons and put him in a CR chamber. Inform me when he \nwakes up. The fool will be very sorry before he dies......&quot; Zardus \ntells Nemesis.\n\nHe looks over at Wolfgang. &quot;Zergling, inform me if Wolfgang ever \ndecides to speak. I&#39;ll go see the new bot.&quot;\n\nZardus walks off down a hallway, heading for the entrance of the \nalliance base. He raises his comm-link to his mouth, &quot;I&#39;m on my way, \nDracona.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
