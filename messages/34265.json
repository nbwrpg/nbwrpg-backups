Her\n&gt;   breath puffs a swirling frosty mist into the crisp icy air. She\n&gt;   stretches and looks around for signs of other robots. &quot;Termitron,\n&gt;   you see anything?&quot; Without really waiting for an answer, she\n&gt;   continues looking without much success. Her head tilts to look up at\n&gt;   the ridges surrounding the Valley, her nose twitches as she picks up\n&gt;   the scent of a deer, but she shurgs and continues. &quot;Termitron, we&#39;ll\n&gt;   go to that peak over there and take a look around,&quot; she points to a\n&gt;   large mountain that protrudes nearly to the cloud line. &quot;We might be\n&gt;   able to see something from there. I think I&#39;ll try a commlink\n&gt;   broadcast but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get much in this valley, we&#39;re too\n&gt;   surrounded with obstructions... on the top maybe..&quot; She finishes,\n&gt;   the last part to herself. She starts plodding on to the peak, her\n&gt;   fur tuffted ears perked and listening to see if Termitron follows.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
