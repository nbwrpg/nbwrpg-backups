Humans were still manning it and it was fully\nmaintained. The city that HYDRAS was looking at was rusted and old, it\nlooked as if humans had left it several decades ago and the plant\nitself had been long been shut down and closed off.\n\nSomething was wrong, very wrong. Things were different then they\nshould have been.\n\nHowever from what he could tell, based on a quick dating method of the\nmetals and such, they were approximately in the present day for\nTransformers and no longer in the past.
