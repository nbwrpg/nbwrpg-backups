The \nCybertronian Fire&#39;s your ship? such a shame that your ship had to \ncrash, the scans I took showed it to be a rather formidable ship, I \nwas impressed. Is there any chance it will fly again?&quot;\n\nPhobia didn&#39;t expect much of an answer to his question. He was after \nall a Predicon, the natural enemy of the Maximals. A good leader \ndidn&#39;t devulge any tactical information to the enemy. If he did tell \nthe details then Phobia knew he wasn&#39;t leaving while he was \nfunctional.\n\n(Sorry about the control thing, I was in a hurry and didn&#39;t have time \nto wait for details over a small thing.)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Please do not controll other charaters in the future, Cyberwolf. \nI&#39;ll let \n&gt; this pass, but be more careful.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster looks from Phobia to Savanah. &quot;I am Kluster, commander of \nthe Maximal \n&gt; battle cruiser The Cybertronian Fire.
