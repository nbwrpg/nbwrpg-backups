He began transmitting pictures into his \nmind.  He showed them standing on a platform, then a drip of acid \nfalling from halucigen and melting away the floor which was holding \nthem. Then a thumb up or a thumb down.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Cygnar::\n&gt;     He stood inside the Trainer ship.  Well it wasn&#39;t exacty \nstanding.  He \n&gt; just happened to be upright on the floor.  He had no way of \nmoving.  He was \n&gt; acctually quite bored.  He needed someone to talk to or fight with \nor \n&gt; something.  He could still breath and his mouth was open but he \ncouldn&#39;t \n&gt; properly form words.  As a young bot he had practiced the lost art \nof \n&gt; ventriloquy.  He decided to try his hand at it again.  &quot;Is hare any \nway to \n&gt; hurn his off?&quot;  (I figured it out, this can be said easily without \nmoving the \n&gt; mouth or tounge.)\n\n\n"}}
