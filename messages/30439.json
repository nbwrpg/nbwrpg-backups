She roared out as the teeth peirced the flesh and almost tore \nthe wing from her shoulder.  She still swiped at him.  Then she tried \nanother idea.  She closed her eyes, ignoring the pain, and sent the \nmental image of the dragon&#39;s scales starting to fall off.  Then the \ndragon&#39;s skin started to peel away. MEch fluid running fast down his \nbody.  It was a grusome thought, but she tried hard to make the \ndragon think it was really happening. With luck, he&#39;d gasp in fear \nand let her go. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megaton stood tall taking the shot, his thick scales prevented any \nmajor\n&gt; damage. Another shot, then another. The blows fealt like a few \npunches\n&gt; instead of claws. The dragon was beginning to feal annoyed by the \nwinged\n&gt; polar bear swatting at him. Without warning the great beast snapped \nhis head\n&gt; forward, biting at Ice&#39;s puny body.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Prowl::\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl nods, weapons still ready. &quot;Why did you come to the Maximal\n&gt; base then?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Dragon watches his playthings attacking as he spoke, &quot;I came to \nmake you\n&gt; an offer you can&#39;t refuse.&quot; (Sorry couldn&#39;t resist) the mutant was \nalmost\n&gt; enjoying himself watching the other mutants futile attempts to hurt \nhim.\n&gt; &quot;And as soon as anyone important shows up I&#39;ll make that offer \nyessssss&quot; His\n&gt; Megatron side was working it&#39;s way into his logic, this was one \nthing he&#39;d\n&gt; tried to avoid. The former Pred leader would have destroyed these \nbots\n&gt; before the fight began but that would leave the faction weak.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine saw the futal attempts that Ice was using and transformed \nto his\n&gt; half wolf mode. again he hit Megaton with his howl in the back.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megaton was caught off gaurd and forced forward, He remained on his \nfeet and\n&gt; swung backward at the wolf with his spiked tail. Lunarpine easily \navoided it\n&gt; by leaping straight up and over the tail.\n\n\n\n"}}
