He said to Sinesis: &quot;Well, if he starts\nanythin&#39; wit&#39; &#39;er, then someone&#39;s gonna have t&#39; use th&#39; muzzle on th&#39;\ntin-horn.&quot; He walked away from the two brothers and sat back down on the\nchair in front of th console. He leaned against it, when KitKat came to him.\nHe was almost surprised to see her. He rarely saw her around the base.\n\nShe sounded bored, and so was she. &quot;Well, honestly wolfie, ah&#39;s ain&#39;t got no\norders. Ah&#39;m waitin&#39; fer Boss-bot and Dark Mouse t&#39; get back. Ah had uh job\nfer Dark Mouse, but she ran off.&quot; He looked at the screen. &quot;There&#39;s uh bot\nah know who can help.
