He put her on the lab table and \nbolted off into the hallway. He ran down the corridors, searching for \nthe dock. He wasn&#39;t used to this base. He hadn&#39;t spent time on \nexploring the many corridors and doorways.\n\nBut Thank Primus, he did find the dock Black Arachnia told him. He \nlooked around, and at an corner of the room was the pod. He walked \nover to it and tore the web from it. He shoved it towards the door \nand managed to get it out the hallway. He frowned to himself a \nlittle. Getting this to back to the lab room wasn&#39;t going to be easy, \nbut Black Arachnia&#39;s life was at danger. \n\nHe was strong so, he thought he could manage it to it. He transformed \nto beast mode and used his large claws to push it to the lab room \nwhere Black Arachnia was. \n\nHe grumbled a little getting into the room.  He shoved it near the \ntable where she was and transformed back to robot. \n\nWhat was next?\n\nThe spark transfer. He looked around. \n\n&quot;Okay, okay.&quot; he said to himself, searching for what he could use. He \nfound a few wires, and even a compartment that would be perfect for \nholding the spark. \n\nHe gathered the supplies up and walked back to Black Arachnia.\n\n&quot;Ah think yer gonna have t&#39; help. Ah don&#39;t know what t&#39; do.&quot; He \nplaced the compartment on the table beside her. &quot;How am ah gonna get \nt&#39; th&#39; spark?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
