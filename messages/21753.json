The Arks been destroyed. I lost contact \nwith it when I was chaseing down an infiltrator.&quot; he loosened his \ngrip, looked her in the eye &quot;And Strikers dead. He was killed by a \ncreature calling himself Slayer.&quot; He wasn&#39;t telling the whole truth \nbut it was enough of the truth for her to know. &quot;I was sporting the \nmarks of a battle with him when I returned.&quot; He kept his mind focused \non her eyes so she wouldn&#39;t be able to read past that.\n\nFoxfingers heard her in his mind again. &quot;HMMPH&quot; He muttered as he \nleft. He couldn&#39;t tell if she was in his head or not. He just wanted \nher out.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; She chuckled to herself. &quot;Your secret is safe, I won&#39;t tell.&quot; she \n&gt; thought to FoxFingers. &quot;And I&#39;ll try to stay out of your mind from \n&gt; now on. Your thoughts are your&#39;s and I won&#39;t intrude.&quot; She cut off \n&gt; the link to FoxFingers, and stopped reading his mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; She smiled and easied up on her hug with Lunarpine &quot;And I won&#39;t \n&gt; forget. But I&#39;ll be able to back you up in fights a lot better now \n&gt; that I am what I am.&quot; She kissed his cheek. &quot;I was worried about \nyou \n&gt; while you were gone. I prayed that the matrix would let us be \n&gt; together again. And my prayers were answered. I&#39;ll not leave you \n&gt; again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine flinched as Ice got him in a &quot;Bear&quot; hug She was at \nleast \n&gt; &gt; five times the strength she was as Shadow Wing. &quot;Take it easy on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; metal, I don&#39;t want to end up in the CR chamber over a hug.&quot; He \n&gt; &gt; laughed and put his arms around her. &quot;And don&#39;t think you&#39;re \n&gt; getting \n&gt; &gt; out of my promise to protect you just because you&#39;re stronger \nthan \n&gt; &gt; me.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers froze in his tracks for a moment when Ice entered his \n&gt; &gt; head. The robotic equivelincy to Homer Simpsons &quot;DOH&quot; came out as \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; slapped himself in the forehead. &quot;I&#39;ll remember that trick .&quot; He \n&gt; &gt; thought back as he began down the hall again. He still wasn&#39;t \nsure \n&gt; &gt; about the extent of her powers but he still wanted his thoughts \nto \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; kept secret. If Veratis knew that he&#39;d broken into the maximal \n&gt; &gt; weapons locker then into a Predacon base he wouldn&#39;t be a happy \n&gt; &gt; scientist.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the lab Veratis tried duplicating the steps that he&#39;d taken \nbut \n&gt; &gt; for some reason the bot who&#39;d just recieved Dinobots DNA seemed \n&gt; more \n&gt; &gt; agressive towards accepting it. Veratis figured it was just the \n&gt; &gt; difference betwee Ice and this bot until he realized that he&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; forgotten to check the chip. Sure enough He was dealing with a \n&gt; &gt; Predacon Protoform this time. He tried to delay so he could \nprogram \n&gt; &gt; it but it was to late. The chip had taken effect and the Predacon \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; on his way to being born.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
