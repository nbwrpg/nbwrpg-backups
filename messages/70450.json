Lord Elder, I can do this, I&#39;ve done it before! Just say the word =\r\nand it&#39;s done. This is Rat Trap ta Wheels and Perceptor, Over, better stay =\r\nwhere you are for now, I know I can convert Perceptor&#39;s signature but I&#39;m g=\r\nonna need some time ta do that, and of course, permission ta access his sig=\r\nnature files. Once that&#39;s done, it&#39;ll only take a few minutes ta change it.=\r\n&quot;\n\nThe Ark weapons are trained on Perceptor, although they seem to be\nunabl=\r\ne to establish a true lock as Tuscon is standing between them and\ntheir int=\r\nended target.

Are\nwe under attack?&quot; Elder =\r\nwas in the inner recesses of the Ark talking\nwith Cheetor when the alarms w=\r\nent off.\n\nThe computer responds to Rat Trap&#39;s clearance codes allowing him\n=\r\naccess to the systems.
