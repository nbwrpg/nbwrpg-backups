Wolfblade and\nMalice are working on a repulsion beam mod for the\ngun, with Malice as the power source. Bloodblade is a\nMinion, and the others are all working on the Uber\nGun. Not sure what the Preds are upto.  Oh Yeah, and\nif the Maximals have alarms rigged on the Ark, they\nall went off, cause Shadowcaster just entered the Ark\nand Assimilated the matrix in an attempt to commune\nwith Primus (read the posts Matrix Gambit and Matrix\nQuest, for more info on that).  Oh yeah, and there&#39;s a\nsurprise in the works that noone will be expecting ;)\nhehehe.\n\n --- Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@...&gt; wrote: &gt;\nOOC: I have a functioning monitor again, woo hoo!\n&gt; Looks like I&#39;m going to need a massive update on\n&gt; whats going on though.
