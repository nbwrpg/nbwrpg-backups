He dumped them all around the hunter and went to \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Repair bay to nurse his own injuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice finally came back online.  His vision was blurred \n&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more \n&gt; alert.  \n&gt; &gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; settled \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for wiggling over to the closest cube.  He touched his foot \nto \n&gt; &gt; it, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and began absorbing the energy from it.  His shoulder \n&gt; immediatly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; began to heal itself.  He set up and tried to break his \nbonds, \n&gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were nearly unbreakable.  He scooted forward and \ntouched \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; several cubes.

She walked over and pushed him back \n&gt; onto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bed.  She put what looked like gravitity weights on his \nankles \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then unbound his feet.  She repeated the same proceedure on \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrists.  She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice was pinned to the bed.  He tried to get up, but his \n&gt; arms \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; legs were not going anywhere.  Hellplague smiled and \nstraddled \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  hunter&#39;s mid section, leaning forward and supporting \n&gt; herself \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her arms resting on his chest.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Now, I think you had better just be an obediant little \n&gt; lizard \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stay here where I can watch you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She leaned down until her face was inches from his.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Or else I may have to &#39;disipline&#39; you.&quot;she added with a \n&gt; &gt; devious \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smirk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Tag minions&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
