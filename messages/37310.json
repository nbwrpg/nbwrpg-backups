We intercepted a suspicious Decepticon signal, decrypted it. \nWe then discovered that the Decepticons had been landed on Earth and \nwere gainging power. They were dominating the planet, and we cannot \nlet any Decepticons get away with any sort of cruelty. We also \ndiscovered that they weren&#39;t the only ones there. There are a few \nfactions who the Pred Council figured would be able to stand for a \nwhile before falling to the supposed Decepticon might. The Autobot \nCouncil has since started this project to send a ship secretly to the \nplanet to balance the power and, if possible, grab the Decepticon \nfoot before it stretches too far around the globe. I am Sub-Commander \nPacifix, and in charge of this mission (In the presence of Ironhide, \nPacifix is Sub-Commander). I ask you again, will you join our cause?&quot; \nHe watches the two bots reactions impassivly. (I know Pacifix is \nbeing kinda trusting, but I wanna get off planet soon! =P)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; ::Repugnus::\n&gt; &quot;Yea, you guys absolutely sucked&quot;\n\n\n"}}
