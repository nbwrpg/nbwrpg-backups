T=\r\nucson has always resented Megatron and the Decepticons, as much as any Auto=\r\nbot would but, he&#39;s highly dedicated to his comrades and to protecting the =\r\ninnocent.

Well, part=\r\n of that is starting to surface.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He&#39;s lost his temper and Straight S=\r\nhot picked up on it. But to cover\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; himself, he told her it was a pure=\r\n bluff. So it looks like he&#39;s bluffing to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; try to fool the enemy, or =\r\nis it really a bluff? Did he mean everything he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; said, and did he als=\r\no intend to ram his foot into Megatron&#39;s fallen body?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This is a grea=\r\nt chance for Rodimus to over come his self doubt as his own\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; comrade&#39;=\r\ns emotional stability seems to be wearing thin. And now, he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; threaten=\r\ns to put an arrow straight through the chest of the fallen\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Deceptico=\r\nn leader, if the enemy does not stand down. You could call this a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fi=\r\nt of bottled up rage that he&#39;s had for a long time, since his own\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; un=\r\nfortunate incident when he was shot down and taken off line, only to fail\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; in his mission to protect his comrades. He doesn&#39;t take failure very =\r\nwell\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; since that, and he&#39;ll do everything in his power to make sure i=\r\nt doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happen again.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot doesn&#39;t know the=\r\n full scope of Tucson&#39;s issues, it may be up\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to Rodimus to fill in t=\r\nhe gaps for her.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As far as what happened, it was the day that=\r\n Rodimus had been taken by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hydras, as Tucson desperately tried to fe=\r\nnd off the enemy, by providing a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; decoy to get the enemy to focus on =\r\nhim rather than Rodimus. He was taken\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; off line by Cyclonus long befo=\r\nre he could actually accomplish what he was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; trying to do, and the on=\r\nly one who saw that shot, was Straight Shot, who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just shortly after =\r\nthat, was taken off line herself. Tucson was in vehicle\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mode when it=\r\n happened, and can not remember anything of that battle due to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the c=\r\nranial shot he endured. This is what makes him so angry. The fact\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat he feels that he failed Rodimus and the others the first time, and now\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; he&#39;s in danger of failing them again. You could say that even though =\r\nhe may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; think he doesn&#39;t need help, he could really use Rodimus&#39;s sup=\r\nport right\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about now.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, S=\r\nuper Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I hope to be p=\r\nosting tommorrow or so, so many things to catch up\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in so many plac=\r\nes. But I had a question :)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; How is Talon inside Tuscon? W=\r\nhen Tuscon transforms back into robot\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mode he is roughly human hie=\r\nght or slightly larger, the same height as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; nearly all the Maximals=\r\n and Predacons are more or less. Talon would be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; approximately the =\r\nsame size as Tuscon in this form - perhaps a few\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; inches shorter or=\r\n so - seeing as Tuscon is a Prime an all that. But\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; having said tha=\r\nt, having Tuscon holding holding Talon inside, that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; would be a bit=\r\n . . . um . . . messy?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And I want to apologize about Tusc=\r\non&#39;s arrow. It was not that it was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ineffective, but it was just th=\r\nat Nightrazor was not visable any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; longer. When I am crafting a pos=\r\nt, I try to take into account just how\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; much conversation or other =\r\nactions have gone on between each move. If\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Tuscon was tapping out =\r\nhis communication to Rodimus and Straight Shot,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; then that gave Nig=\r\nhtrazor time to hide or make other choices. I was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; giving you a hin=\r\nt to that when I had Rodimus speak in short sentences\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and remind T=\r\nuscon that the intruder would not wait for lengthy\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; communications.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not trying to be mean. As a suggestion, imagine you=\r\nrself saying\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the things Tuscon is saying in the middle of a battle=\r\n or an intense\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; scene and you will see what I mean. Imagine how man=\r\ny things you could\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have done in the time that it would have taken =\r\nfor Tuscon to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; communicate the information he did in morris code to=\r\n straightshot and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, not trying to =\r\nbe mean, just accurate and realistic as I can be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in a made up worl=\r\nd where robots can transform and we break laws of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; physics with eve=\r\nry stroke of the pen :)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; On Mon,=\r\n Apr 11, 2011 at 10:54 AM, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Replying to Airly&#39;s post first, going in that =\r\nsequence.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inside the Ark, =\r\nTucson puts his hand over his chest, and gently does as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Talon ha=\r\nd asked.

He then looks around the paramet=\r\ners and then\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remembers a body of goop, that resembled a tar pit,=\r\n not far from the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ark&#39;s parameters.

You okay&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstride pat=\r\ns him on the shoulder.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Just fine.

It&#39;s worth a try.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar=\r\n and Quickstride now approach Deep Stryke and the others with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\neir hands up in submission.

Yet they keep quiet so is not to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alarm them. Yet, contact could not be helped as a young Stegasaurous\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noses up to Night Shift, who is not in the least bit frightened =\r\nby it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Woah, check this out.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nRat Trap gasps.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ohh geeze, let&#39;s hope it&#39;s parents a=\r\nin&#39;t around here somewhere.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The baby dinosaur groans=\r\n, and looks back into the brush. Night Shift\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curiously follows i=\r\nt, and notices a larger stegasaurous standing there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a foot =\r\nraised, with a large piece of wood lodged in it&#39;s left front\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foo=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, don&#39;t go too close ta that thing!

He looks back to Rat Trap\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; casually.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s okay, if it was gonna do somethn&#39; it would&#39;ve done it by now.

The dino\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; roars slightly but is quickly relieved of his pain. He&#39;s soon joined b=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his mate, and it&#39;s clear to see, that this was a family of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stegasaurouses. He looks down to Night Shift, and nudges his hand w=\r\nith\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his nose gently.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s okay big guy, n=\r\no sweat, you go back with your family.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The stegasaur=\r\nouses now retreat back into the forest, yet the little one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks=\r\n back once more thankfully and then retreats. Rat trap smiles as he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; watches them retreat.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Talk about meetn&#39; some pr=\r\netty large friends.

Quockstride&#39;s large blast cannon=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fires repeatedly into the air keeping the vicious Predacon at=\r\n bay. One\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of his attacks catches him in the fuselage sending W=\r\naspinator spinning\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the air once more, smoke trailing b=\r\nehind him.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Waspinator hate all this!&quot; he said as=\r\n he sailed away!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord and Kup continue firing against Scourge and Deepstrike.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Windlord and Kup c=\r\nontinue their firefight, Scourge swung out around\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them, forcin=\r\ng them to change their attacks and swing with him.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile D=\r\neepstryke moved higher up and the other way, swinging his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mult=\r\niple cannon mounts around at the same time. However instead of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n firing at Kup or Windlord he targets the door to the Ark!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MEANWHILE INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He thinks for a moment. This was a great way to co=\r\nmmunicate because\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nightrazor may not have any idea that Tucs=\r\non was still able to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communicate in this mode. He raises an =\r\noptic and continues to tap\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his shoulder.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Don&#39;t take this the wrong way Rodimus, but it&#39;s the only way w=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can communicate in a way that Nightrazor has no notion of =\r\nus doing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so. Feel free to do the same, use the morse coding,=\r\n it will help us\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand each other to apprehend him suff=\r\niciantly.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Tus=\r\ncon had his hands on Rodimus to pass the message he could feel\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Rodimus move in the darkness, presumably nodding his head in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nunderstanding. &quot;Gotcha!&quot; Rodimus tapped back, knowing the code Tuscon\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was using.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Need move quick&quot; Rodimus tapp=\r\ned back quickly, &quot;Intruder not wait us\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talk.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus motioned for them to spread out, &quot;Your senses better, fin=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; switch&quot; he tapped again.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He stops to feel the vibrations of the floor. =\r\nThen he puts out his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand to sense vibrations in the air. Th=\r\nrough that, he could get a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; faint idea as to how the air circ=\r\nulates around various objects. A\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cross breeze as stale as it=\r\n was, would navigate him toward an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emergency generator switc=\r\nh. He follows that breeze, and extends his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand out to touch=\r\n it, slowly comming to the device. With another\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raise of the=\r\n brow he carefully throws the switch and waits to see\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what h=\r\nappens.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually =\r\nas Tuscon was just about to the generator control, but before\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhe could pull it he found that he did not need to!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; In moving he had stepped out of the field of darkness and with a blink\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he could hear and his radar/sonar snapped back on, all sensors w=\r\nere a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However any scan back to w=\r\nhere he came from would show that where he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was standing there =\r\nwas a large ball of darkness several meters across\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he cou=\r\nld not scan, it was a globe of darkness and silence.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus stepped out of the other side of the globe blinking also\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; obviously his sensors were coming back online too.

Fortunately th=\r\ne fallen bodies of the Autobots\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Decepticons were too far a=\r\nway to receive more than a little\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rumbling and smoke, nothing =\r\nthat would significantly impact their\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slumber and their eventu=\r\nal awakening.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile . . .\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We must be carefull&quot;said Talo=\r\nn with a moan, the pain was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unbearable.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Can you set me in stasis???&quot;sais Talon with pain&quot;I donat know ho=\r\nw\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much longer i could bear this pain...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Evidently whomever had placed Talon =\r\ndown had left Talon is a well\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shielded place, there was no dam=\r\nage to this Maximal as well. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; console that was between Talo=\r\nn and the door snapped off and was flung\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across the room, but =\r\nTalon continued to lay there, his systems\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merciful shutting hi=\r\nm down, sending him into stasis lock.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor tried to seal all the corritors that l=\r\nead to the sleep\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decepticons and autobots.

When they got there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the door was loc=\r\nked, sealed with a medical privacy code.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;FRAG!&quot; =\r\nhe said as he tried the door. &quot;With the power down it won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; re=\r\ncognize me.&quot; Then with a hum the lights began to come on in the hall\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; and the door began to buzz as it scanned Ramulus. &quot;Identity Ramulus\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; detected and confirmed.&quot; The door slid open\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus leaped inside and looked around, and in one corner, there w=\r\nas\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight laying on her bed, unconscious, but other wise o=\r\nkay. &quot;O\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Primus!&quot; Ramulus said in relief as he looked over the =\r\nreadings. &quot;He\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was no doctor, but to him everything looked okay=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile through the rest of the Ark lights be=\r\ngan to flicker and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blink as main power began to reassert itsel=\r\nf. The computer&#39;s voice\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be heard echoing off several pan=\r\nels as it worked through an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; internal diagnostics check, &quot;Preda=\r\ncon signatures detected.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the room with Percep=\r\ntor the computer began quickly pin pointing the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; various signat=\r\nures both inside and within a mile of the Ark outside.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BACK OUTSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the same time Torc=\r\na, Noctorro, AirHammer, Quicksilver and Bantor,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Maximal Fu=\r\nzors took this moment of distraction to rush the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons can=\r\nnons blazing!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several sweeps fell from the skies =\r\nand Scourge as well took another\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hit, this one sending a sizzl=\r\ning burn up the side of his flank.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cyclonus was a=\r\nlso hit, although he was able to twist in the air,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turning wha=\r\nt would have normally been a devastating blow into one that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gl=\r\nanced off his armor.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deepstryke was hit several t=\r\nimes, forcing him to back off, his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boosters flaring as he bega=\r\nn to retreat.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inferno also was damaged as he took=\r\n a hit that was designed for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras, the hit sent Inferno spir=\r\naling towards the ground as well.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As powerful as =\r\nthe Predacons were, they did not have all their forces\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there, =\r\nand the Maximals were finally getting their own forces\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; togethe=\r\nr. The only thing that was holding the Predacons together was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthe sheer power that Cyclonus and Hydras and to a lesser extent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Scourge and Deepstyke were bringing to bear on the Maximals!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That might change with the Ark beginning to power up!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
