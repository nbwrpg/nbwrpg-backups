But Phobia made \nsence.  She didn&#39;t want anything to comprimise her situation. She \nnodded,&quot;I will do as you suggest reluctantly. But you are right. My \nlove for him could be used against me and my position comprimised.  \nyes, I will give you command over Drillbit. But be aware that I will \noverride any command that will needlessly put his or anyone&#39;s lives \nin danger.  War and taking nessassary risks is one thing, but just to \nthrow them into a metal cruncher is another.&quot; She looked at Phobia \nwith a solom look. &quot;I want to fight this war and win with minimal \nlosses. We&#39;ve had too many already.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;We can&#39;t rely on the other predacon groups, they won&#39;t act unless \nwe \n&gt; provide proof that he can be hurt&quot; Phobia glanced around at thier \n&gt; surroundings. &quot;Shall we go?&quot; he said, extending his arm in a mock \n&gt; galant gesture.&quot;One more thing, before we get into battle I request \n&gt; you give command over DrillBit directly to me, your realationship \ncan \n&gt; be looked on as a disadvantage that we can&#39;t afford.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; with that he started walking toward the forner Predacon cave.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
