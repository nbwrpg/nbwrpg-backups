He had ruined treads, and just before he could \nreally beat on Unitron, he re-treated. Coward! This isn&#39;t over. \nVulois walks over to the CR Chamber, when Battera comes in.\n\n&quot;Hey, Battera. You just missed a great battle. I&#39;ve set up some \nquarters for you, so you can go rest their.(Than in a whisper he \nadds) I&#39;ll tell you, Soundwave and our newcomer Terminess the details \nwhen I come out of the chamber.&quot;\n\nVulois enters the CR Chamber\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTerminess smiles. Unitron barely missed those missles. Next time, \nafter a few more calibrations, he won&#39;t be able to. But this project \nwill have to be put on hold for a few days. She has to go get her pod \nso she can start working on the ship out of here.\n\nTerminess quietly leaves the Predacon base.\n\n\n"}}
