As his computer ran a diagnostic on the ship&#39;s computers he decided to examine the engines and hull.\n\nAs Celeron entered the engine room, he saw numerous lifeless bodies.   The engine was in terrible shape; but he began an estimate on what parts he would need to replace.  There was 4 reactors, all of which seemed to be in perfect condition; only one of them was on.  The engineering console was in a easily decipherable language and apparently all of the primary energy conduits were online.  The rear section of the ship had no power running to it, probably to save power.\n\nCeleron got a  message from his computer that the results of the reprogramming were in; Celeron returned to the bridge.\n\n&quot;Username: Celeron now recognized as sole owner.  You have access to 80% of all information on all servers.  20% remains as encrypted information.  All ship functions are under your control.&quot;\n\n&quot;Bring all servers online.&quot;\n\nSome lights came on and the servers began to humm.  The door to the server room closed and locked.  The holotable lit up, and the same face appeared over it.\n\n&quot;Welcome, I am Templar 1288.  Civilian defence and navigational AI.  All security systems are active.  I will now announce the damage report.  Shields: 100%  Hull Integrity: 48%  Engines 0%  Reactors 100%  Power Systems 90%  Internal Communications: Online External Communications: Offline Emergency Systems: offline....&quot;\n\n&quot;End report.&quot;\n&quot;Acknnowledged&quot;\n&quot;Where are the remote controls for crewmembers.&quot;\n&quot;All remote systems are accessed via com link or external audio receivers.&quot;\n&quot;Deactivate external audio receivers.&quot;\n&quot;Affirmative&quot;\n&quot;Activate sound shielding&quot;\n&quot;Done.&quot;\n&quot;Is there an AR chamber aboard?&quot;\n&quot;There are 23 AR chambers in the rear sections.&quot;\n&quot;Reactivate power in those sections.&quot;\n&quot;Afirmative....Power grid damaged in the rear.  2 AR chambers near the bridge are working.&quot;\n&quot;Begin AR prep. move control from bridge to the room with the chamber, put security on high alert.&quot;\n&quot;Aside from AR and Secrurity, enter power saving mode and begin charging all batteries.&quot;\n&quot;Done.  Enjoy your nap Sir.&quot;\n&quot;Humor...BAH!&quot;\n\nAs Celeron walked down the hallway, he could hear the doors closing and locking behind him.  As he entered the room.  He  noticed that these were the captain&#39;s quarters.  He looked into the chamber.  The captain was inside.  Celeron looked at the console.  The captain would awake in 4 solar cycles, no override.\n\n&quot;Computer, activate and prep other chamber.  Seal this room. Transfer control to the other room.&quot;\n&quot;Afirmative...&quot;\nAs Celeron walked to the other room, he remembered the computers he left in the server room.\n&quot;Computer, Seal bridge, and server room.&quot;\n&quot;This has already been done with the high security.&quot;\n&quot;I&#39;ll remember that.&quot;\n&quot;All orders carried out.&quot;\n\nCeleron entered the other room.  Apparently this was the 1st officer&#39;s quarters.  There was no one in this chamber.  Celeron opened the door on the chamber.\n\n&quot;Computer, seal door, deactivate all controls other then this room.&quot;\n&quot;Affirmative&quot;\n&quot;Activate AR chamber for 1/2 of a cycle.&quot;\n&quot;Confirmed&quot;\n&quot;Maintain a separate log of everything that happens while I&#39;m recharging.&quot;\n&quot;Done&quot;\n&quot;Good...&quot;\n\nThe door closed and Celeron powered down.\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________\nGet 25MB, POP3, Spam Filtering with LYCOS MAIL PLUS for $19.95/year.\nhttp://login.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus&ref=lmtplus\n\n--------- End Forwarded Message ---------\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________\nGet 25MB, POP3, Spam Filtering with LYCOS MAIL PLUS for $19.95/year.\nhttp://login.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus&ref=lmtplus\n\n"}}
