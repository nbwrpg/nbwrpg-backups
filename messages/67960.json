Are there\nplayers from other places who may want to come as well? The larger the\nplayer base, the more interesting and varied things become. \n\nPreston\n\n--- khamkain &lt;kham31@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; This sound nice. i like the idea of a more intese conflict between\n&gt; the\n&gt; factions and of course Cybetron.

Sometime ago I started the story arc of \n&gt; &gt; having a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; third Great War break out on Cybertron between the Maximals\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons as well as any remaining Autobots and Decepticons. \n&gt; &gt; Plus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is the G2 Decepticons attacking future Earth. I figure\n&gt; we \n&gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do a RPG set in either of these battles. This would allow for\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; characters to be created and bring the NBW universe to a\n&gt; wider \n&gt; &gt; scale.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like the idea of having it mostly based on Cybertron with \n&gt; &gt; maybe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little threads branching off to the G2 conflict on Earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would put the RPG on Yahoo groups and have it run the exact\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way as NBW.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So get back to me.
