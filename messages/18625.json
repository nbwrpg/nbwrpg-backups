Megatron has tried to kill a lot of people. But how \n&gt; do I believe you? You were talking with Inferno. Inferno works for \n&gt; Megatron. If Megatron really wnated you dead, Inferno would have \n&gt; killed you. You know something and this is your last chance to come \n&gt; clean!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
