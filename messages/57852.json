Oh well, \nadd anything if you feel you have to!)\n\nHi guys! \n\nI&#39;m Nic, or Azure as they call me, and I&#39;m one of the council members \nfor this rpg. Welcome around! \n\nPlaying in the rpg is quite simple; since it&#39;s a play by e-mail \n(pbem), you simply state what your characters do and say. Since you \nsay you&#39;ve been on the website, you might have read the rules. Simply \nsummarized: Have fun, but don&#39;t play the characters of others and \ndon&#39;t be a god. Seems easy, but the step can be subtle! But don&#39;t \nworry, it&#39;s not that hard. \n\nThe story for now is that the Beast Wars have begun anew after the \nBeast Wars series (Beast machine never occured, although there are \ntechno-organics). First there were only Maximals and Predacons, but \nsoon the Tripredacus came to get Megatron (who later became Hydras \nwhen he fused with Galvatron), a task that they yet have to \naccomplish. There are many storylines currently going on, but since \nthere have been elections lately, the game format could change to \nsomething we hope will be even better! \n\nAs for character creation, just follow the rules on the website. \nSince you can&#39;t really submit anything right now on the website, you \ncan upload it on the Yahoogroups page (files link). State your \nfaction (Maxies, Preds or Tripreds), your gender (if any) and a brief \ndescription of your character along with its armament. No more than 5 \nweapons though! \n\nBe careful though; since you are two players, you should make two \nseparate yahoo ID&#39;s, unless you want to play as a single player. It&#39;s \nup to you! \n\nLast thing (I&#39;ve said a lot for someone just joining, haven&#39;t I?), if \nyou need any more information, the other players are your best \nsources for advices. Not sure with a rule? Ask someone! What&#39;s this \nfaction doing? Ask someone (preferably in that faction)! You don&#39;t \nknow what time it is? Down to the right of your screen! (Sorry, it IS \na bad joke...). \n\nI hope this helps you guys to get started! \n\nHave a good time around! \n\nNic \n\n\n\n"}}
