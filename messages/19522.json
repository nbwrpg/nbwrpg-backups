Thank you \nfor your help in this matter Aracnia.&quot; She stood and left the room. \nShe went to the bridge and contacted Megatron on the visual \nlink. &quot;Megatron, this is KitKat. After due consideration, I have \ndecided to meet with you.  I shall meet you at the forest opening, \ntwo miles from my base. In two days.  As you said yourself, You and \nI, alone, no tricks or weapons. Just us and we talk, let me know what \nyour answer is. KitKat out,&quot;\n\nShe turned off the link and left the message for him. She opened her \nlink. &quot;Destructor, I need to talk to you. I am meeting him in two \ndays. I wanted you to know. Contact me when you can.&quot;\n\nShe went back to her lab and finished working on her clone. It was \nnow 90% complete. She sighed. She hadn&#39;t heard from Drillbit for a \nfew days and she was getting worried. She also had Destructor on her \nmind. &quot;Starscream, when you get a chance, contact me.&quot;\n\nShe needed to get things in order before they got out of hand.\nShe turned and walked into the other CR room and saw the two  bots \nand DarkMouse. She looked at then and nodded to DarkMouse.&quot;It&#39;s ok \nDarkMouse. What is it that you two need?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Aracnia nodded at Kitkat, &quot;Its a good idea. Let him get \nscrapped for our \n&gt; cause. Its the Predacon way.&quot; She laughed. &quot;So, should we bring him \nin and \n&gt; talk to him about it?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron paced. The females hadnt called him back yet. What \ncould take \n&gt; them so long? They were playing mind games with him, he knew they \nwere. This \n&gt; psycological tourture had better be worth it....\n&gt;     &quot;Argh! How long will they take!&quot; Megatron roared in anger. Hell \nBeast \n&gt; just shook his head with his diplomatic knowledge of how these \ntypes of \n&gt; meetings went.\n&gt;     He sished, &quot;Megatron, these things take time. I wouldnt be \nsurprized if \n&gt; we didnt hear from them for another week.&quot; And then trotted off.\n\n\n"}}
