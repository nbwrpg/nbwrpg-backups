She was telling the truth.\nDinobot may be the same species as her, but she had no feeling for him.\nShe gives Prowl another little push with her snout, just to try and make him \nbelieve her.*\n\n&quot; Push what you&#39;re thinking out of your mind, Prowl. I know what it is, and \nit&#39;s not true. I don&#39;t like him.&quot;\n\n* But she feels him lean towards him, supporting his weight and sighing \nagainst his neck.\nIf only he believed her. But he would, hopefully.\nIron Raptor watched as Prowls chest plate split, her eyes glued to his spark \nas it&#39;s revealed.\n\nShe looked back up at Prowl as he looked into her eyes she nodded, not a \nsound coming from her mouth.\nThis was all happening very fast, and it almost seemed like yeaterday when \nshe was pleading for Prowl to live.\nAnd now, standing here, they were both putting their sparks on the \nline...just for her.\nShe still didn&#39;t feel like she was worth it, but it was way too late to do \nanything now.\n\nIron Raptor braced herself as Prowl slid his hands up to her shoulders, \nrising up to her hind legs for a more comfortable position.\nIf she was going to die here today, then she was going to be comfortable and \nwith the man she loved.\nBut she actually had faith in him, believing that he wouldn&#39;t let her down.\nThey would both make it out of this alive, in one piece, and with her in \nrobot mode.\nThen this nightmare would be over.\nBut she looked at Prowl just before she felt a squeezing sensation in her \nchest, everything suddenly going black as her spark seemed to slide out fo \nher black chest and just hover in front of it.\nAll of her systems had gone off line, so how she was surviving now was \ncompletely beyond her, but she was...and she was blind now.\n\nIron Raptor blinked, trying to see out of blind eyes, swinging her head to \nthe left and right for a few moments, wondering just what the hell was going \non.\nBut soon she began to feel a little sleepy, and her actions slowed until her \neyes were half closed and her chin was almosy on her chest.\nHer arms just hanging out in front of her.*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
