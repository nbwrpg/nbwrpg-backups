He looks to Leo at the same ti=\r\nme.\n\n&quot; Yes, that&#39;s right, there was definitely high concentrations of Unicr=\r\nonian energy being used at that point of time.   Every being casts their ow=\r\nn energy frequency whether it be low, medium or high, depending on that Ind=\r\nividuals strength profile.  Now, if those signatures are the same coming fr=\r\nom those various locations, it would indicate that the same individual is r=\r\nesponsible for those abductions.  Leo, can you bring that data up for me by=\r\n chance?&quot;\n\nThe strategist part of Tucson comes back to life as he begins to=\r\n piece things together as he did on Cybertron, years ago.\n\n&quot; This definitel=\r\ny takes me back In time when I was going over this with the senior officers=\r\n vorns ago.  I actually enjoyed this aspect of military duty, it was a good=\r\n challenge for a rookie in training.  And the strange aspect of that was th=\r\ne fact I just simply had a knack for solving complex strategies.&quot;\n\nHe then =\r\nthinks of Optimus Primal, and how they could determine his last location.\n\n=\r\n&quot; Mathematics, it has everything to do with numbers.  The geographic coordi=\r\nnates, they lead to areas of latitude and longitude.  Now, to find Primal, =\r\nhe must have informed someone as to where he was going.  We chart the dista=\r\nnce between here and the intended destination, and map out various routes l=\r\neading to that location.  You will come up with several different scenarios=\r\n but, they will all point to one area of bilocation.  We then factor in his=\r\n rate of speed he was traveling at, including the time he left here, and th=\r\ne time it takes to reach the final destination.  Then, determine the time o=\r\nf his last transmission and that will indicate how far he got and where he =\r\ncould possibly be now.  I know it sounds complicated, but it worked on Cybe=\r\nrtron, so let&#39;s see if that will work here.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and c=\r\nonstantly busy. \n\nOn Aug 24, 2011, at 12:05 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclon=\r\nus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson had seen complex strategies =\r\nbefore and this one was definitely trying\n&gt; &gt; everyone&#39;s logic circuits. Mi=\r\nlitary strategy was one of his areas of\n&gt; &gt; expertise and it was a good opp=\r\nortunity to exercise his skills as a\n&gt; &gt; strategist.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; before I evo=\r\nlved into a Prime, I spent quite a few vorns assisting the\n&gt; &gt; Autobots in =\r\nthe military strategy department. And this one here, is very\n&gt; &gt; much like =\r\nsomething I&#39;ve seen before. Not by Unicronians but by the\n&gt; &gt; Decepticons b=\r\nack in the days of the wars on Iacon. I was only a rookie at\n&gt; &gt; the time b=\r\nut I&#39;ve always had a knack in this field of study so the officers\n&gt; &gt; gave =\r\nme a chance to attempt to crack a very complex case. It had to do with\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhow they were causing Autobots to vanish on the battlefield. As everything\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; is now it was back then. They vanished in various quadrants and when I =\r\nused\n&gt; &gt; a holographic map and drew lines that connected those locations, i=\r\nt came up\n&gt; &gt; with an epicenter of activity around the drawn lines. I told =\r\nthe officers I\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t a hundred percent sure but it was possible that t=\r\nhe location was the\n&gt; &gt; area we were looking for. They investigated and the=\r\ny found the missing\n&gt; &gt; Autobots housed in an abandoned complex on Cybertro=\r\nn. It was one of\n&gt; &gt; Shockwave&#39;s master plans that were intended to remain =\r\na mystery but he did\n&gt; &gt; not count on a not so average Autobot to figure it=\r\n out. I was always\n&gt; &gt; considered to be a bit strange, and off the beaten p=\r\nath. But the council\n&gt; &gt; kept me on their team all the same. They said due =\r\nto my rebel like nature,\n&gt; &gt; that I would not be chosen as a commander but =\r\nmy skills were a great asset\n&gt; &gt; to them. I was content with their decision=\r\n all the same. I was comfortable\n&gt; &gt; just being who I was.

Military strategy was one of his area=\r\ns of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; expertise and it was a good opportunity to exercise his skill=\r\ns as a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; strategist.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; before I evolved into a Pri=\r\nme, I spent quite a few vorns assisting the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Autobots in the milita=\r\nry strategy department.  And this one here, is very&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; much like some=\r\nthing I&#39;ve seen before.  Not by Unicronians but by the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Decepticons=\r\n back in the days of the wars on Iacon.  I was only a rookie at&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; th=\r\ne time but I&#39;ve always had a knack in this field of study so the officers&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; gave me a chance to attempt to crack a very complex case.  It had t=\r\no do with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; how they were causing Autobots to vanish on the battlefi=\r\neld.  As everything&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is now it was back then.  They vanished in var=\r\nious quadrants and when I used&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a holographic map and drew lines th=\r\nat connected those locations, it came up&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with an epicenter of acti=\r\nvity around the drawn lines.  I told the officers I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; wasn&#39;t a hundr=\r\ned percent sure but it was possible that the location was the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; area=\r\n we were looking for.  They investigated and they found the missing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Autobots housed in an abandoned complex on Cybertron.   It was one of&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Shockwave&#39;s master plans that were intended to remain a mystery but h=\r\ne did&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not count on a not so average Autobot to figure it out.  I w=\r\nas always&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; considered to be a bit strange, and off the beaten path.=\r\n  But the council&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; kept me on their team all the same.  They said d=\r\nue to my rebel like nature,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that I would not be chosen as a comman=\r\nder but my skills were a great asset&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to them.
