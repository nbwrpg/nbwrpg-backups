The\n&gt; suit was useless because of its damage anyways, and would just make\n&gt; him slower.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Allright, lets get going.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He flies out of the entrance, heading for the Maximal base.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ignatius snapped a new energizer to his talons. He knew that it\n&gt; would take\n&gt; &gt; as much power as he had to take on the Maximal army. Afterwards he\n&gt; pulled\n&gt; &gt; the mirror sensers and checked each one thoroughly. In a short time\n&gt; Ignatius\n&gt; &gt; stood poised for battle. At his side was a pack containing extra\n&gt; energy\n&gt; &gt; units, the mirror sensers, and the explosives needed to blow up the\n&gt; ridge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m set, let&#39;s move.&quot; Ignatius prided himself on his thorough\n&gt; attitude, he\n&gt; &gt; had the land memorized, the mirror sensers adjusted, and a full\n&gt; power unit\n&gt; &gt; in his weapons, he was ready for anything.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
