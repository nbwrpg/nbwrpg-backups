But then again, it really didn&#39;t matter.\nShe listened as he gave his name, it actually turning out to be one that was \njust as much a common name as the rest she heard of.\nBut she managed to put up a small yet friendly smile.*\n\n&quot; Zyber.&quot;\n\n* She simply clasped her hands on her knees, waiting to see the beasts \nreaction. And hoping that simply giving her name like he asked wouldn&#39;t \nanger him to the point of her jumping back.\nBesides, it was about time that he rested.\nZyber got to her feet and looked around the room, seeing nothing that needed \nto be tended to she simply turned back towards the damaged bot.\nShe still had one thing to do though, before she went about her normal days \nwork.\nZyber picked up the rock jar of salve and faced the creature.\nShe kneeled down beside the bed and took a bit of the salve onto her \nfingers, and without a moment&#39;s hesitation she began to apply a fair coat of \nit onto the beasts chest.\nThis would make sure that he didn&#39;t stop breathing or anything while she was \nbusy with other things.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
