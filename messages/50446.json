But Rauq, even you have\n&gt; to\n&gt;   &gt; admit that HNC&#39;s \n&gt;   &gt; inaugural rp post wasn&#39;t worth the time it took\n&gt; to\n&gt;   &gt; read the first \n&gt;   &gt; line, let alone the whole thing.  And Lurker&#39;s\n&gt;   &gt; start-up is the most \n&gt;   &gt; over-dramatized entrance I&#39;ve ever seen - all\n&gt; you\n&gt;   &gt; need is a shot of \n&gt;   &gt; Dr. Frankenstein throwing a switch and it&#39;s a\n&gt; ripoff\n&gt;   &gt; of every single \n&gt;   &gt; horror movie out there.  \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; It&#39;s improved somewhat since then.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; As far as characters are concerned, Terminion\n&gt; and \n&gt;   &gt; Skullertron/Slaughter actually display both\n&gt;   &gt; personality and \n&gt;   &gt; potential.  The remaining four have been\n&gt;   &gt; cannon-fodder thus far.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; That&#39;s my opinion and it&#39;s up to you guys to\n&gt; prove\n&gt;   &gt; me right or wrong \n&gt;   &gt; by roleplaying, not bitching.  And this is a\n&gt; serious\n&gt;   &gt; RPG, not a \n&gt;   &gt; slapstick movie, so if I see another\n&gt; post/exchange\n&gt;   &gt; like HNC&#39;s first \n&gt;   &gt; one, where everyone involved is an absolute\n&gt; idiot, I\n&gt;   &gt; will ingore \n&gt;   &gt; every post thereafter made by the perpetrator(s)\n&gt;   &gt; regardless of who \n&gt;   &gt; they are or think they are.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been lurking around for those wondering.\n&gt;   &gt; Megatron is waiting \n&gt;   &gt; in \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; the control room for the Predacons, most of\n&gt; which\n&gt;   &gt; are &#39;busy&#39; or \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; something. I really don&#39;t have much to post\n&gt; about\n&gt;   &gt; right now, but I \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; still have to read the posts up till when i\n&gt; last\n&gt;   &gt; checked em.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; I guess i have to stick my nose in, cause this\n&gt;   &gt; obviously aint \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; getting better, it&#39;s getting worse. *raises\n&gt; verbal\n&gt;   &gt; shields*\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; First think that needs to happen is a cease\n&gt; fire\n&gt;   &gt; in this flame war \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; between cardhead, lurker, and narrator. it\n&gt; started\n&gt;   &gt; wrong right from \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; the start. certain things which shouldn&#39;t have\n&gt;   &gt; been said, were \n&gt;   &gt; said, \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; and the replies were less than sucessful at\n&gt;   &gt; defusing the situation \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; and it blew up. \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; cardhead, if you don&#39;t like Narrator&#39;s posting\n&gt;   &gt; style, that&#39;s your \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; problem. Telling him that you don&#39;t like it,\n&gt; with\n&gt;   &gt; a bunch of \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; senseless slander isn&#39;t going to make him post\n&gt; the\n&gt;   &gt; way you&#39;d like \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; him to post.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Narrator, keep ooc comments out of your\n&gt; posting,\n&gt;   &gt; if you want to say \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; something, say it and no pot shots. And I find\n&gt; it\n&gt;   &gt; really hard to \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; believe that you managed to put &#39;piece of dog\n&gt;   &gt; shit&#39; and &#39;grow up&#39; \n&gt;   &gt; in \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; the same context.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; If anyone wants to grow up, then they should\n&gt; shut\n&gt;   &gt; up about this \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; stupid arguement, and get back to role\n&gt; playing.\n&gt;   &gt; Nothing anyone can \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; say now short of an appologies and &#39;I&#39;m being\n&gt;   &gt; quiet&#39;, can show me \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; that anyone is growing up.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; *preps for backlash*\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;  \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
