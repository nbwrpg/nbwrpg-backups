She heard him order her to go \nwith Astroblast, but she wasn&#39;t sure who that was.\n\n&quot;Um, exuse me,&quot; she said, gathering courage and walking toward Megatron but \nlooking nerviously around, &quot;Who did you want me to go with .. sir?&quot;\n\n\n\n\nElement smiled to himself in satisfaction when a good number of the \nattackers retreated. He looked around to find a new target and then spotted \nAbominus. Element growled. He had attacked that robot earlier, but Galaxor \nwas already fighting him by then. From what he saw in front of him, he \nwasn&#39;t sure if Galaxor was winning.\n\n&quot;Need any help?&quot; Element asked Galaxor in a deep voice while coming up \nbehind Abominus and stopping a few dozen yards from him. He fired two \nmissiles at Abominus, and mentally aimed them toward Abominus&#39;s head.\n\n\n\n\nCyndro&#39;s scanners reported alot of the enemies retreating, and that let him \nconcentrate on the enemies that were still here. He fired several missiles \nat Abominus, and then continued to shoot at Hell Beast&#39;s group with EMP \nblasts, lasers, and more missiles. Cyndro was a deadly aimer, and since most \nof Hell Beast&#39;s troops were distracted with battle, his shots should hit \nvery well.\n\nThe jammer was still blocking all enemy transmissions, and he knew that \nwould make it harder for the enemy to make an organized retreat. He decided \nto make it even more disorganized, and assaulted the retreating robots with \na few EMP blasts and missiles. Ever missile that he fired was a seeking one.\n\n\n\n\n\nAntagony smiled at Vlad when he complimented her name. He seemed a bit out \nof place in this base. Antagony glanced back at Perndabot to compare Vlad to \nhim, and decided that they were pretty different robots. She then looked \nback at Vlad and smiled.\n\n&quot;Why thank you. I hope we&#39;ll be friends, but I still have to officially join \nthis team.&quot; She looked back at Perndabot. &quot;Do I have to speak to your \ncommander about joining or can I just join up?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe five Maximal robots that had crashed earlier on the planet activated and \nexited their pods. Using their scanners, they found each other and began to \nasses their situation. (sorry that&#39;s so short, I have to go! :)\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
