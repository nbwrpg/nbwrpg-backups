She was pleased with this whole set up. She \nknew that here in this ship, there were maps to all the bases, info \non most of the groups, and perhaps, they might even know the fianly \nresting place of Megatron. She still had a score to settle with him.\nShe looked up at Galvatron and nodded, her face was blank. &quot;Yes, \nthanks. I&#39;ll take you up on that offer.&quot; She studied the locations of \nthe bases. Then yawned,&quot;Yeah, I need a nap. Gee, for sleeping for so \nlong I feel awefully tired. Mind if I go rest and recharge for a bit \nthere Boss Bot?&quot;  She was always giving her superiors nick names, and \nthis one was no exception. &quot;Where are those quarters again?&quot; She \nsaid, yawning again.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Galvatron looked at her. He didnt say anythign but i think she \ntook what he \n&gt; said the wrong way. he was very impressed by her. he hoped she \nwould stay. \n&gt; &quot;Yes that would be it. They may still be there. If your planning to \nstay \n&gt; those quarters can be your for as long as you want.&quot; He typed in \nsome numbers \n&gt; and the feactions names came up over all the bases. His was not on \nthere for \n&gt; while cloaked it wasnt detectable on any scanner. he pointed on the \nmap. \n&gt; &quot;This is where we are. CLose to the decepticon base here.&quot; he \npointed slighty \n&gt; to the right. &quot;they may be a problem.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
