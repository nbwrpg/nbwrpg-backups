She flew back tot \nhe detron base.  She flew to a tree outside the entrance and hid in the \nbranches.  She covered her face with her wings and stayed there. Out of the \nway.\n\n\n-----Original Message----\n&gt;::CyberShark::\n&gt;\n&gt;     He got the message from Pantron. He really didn&#39;t want to leave \n&gt;Battera,\n&gt;but knowing where Pantron was he didn&#39;t want to bring her either.\n&gt;     &quot;Battera, if you wish you can return to my base and hang out untill I\n&gt;return. I have to go to Hell Beast&#39;s layer to retrive a fallen comrade. I\n&gt;will be back.&quot; CyberShark called out ot Battera.\n&gt;     He zommed away toward Hell Beast&#39;s base. As soon as he was in radar \n&gt;range\n&gt;he cloaked. He went in and fired everything he had at Sniper. He knew it\n&gt;proboly wouldn&#39;t kill him, but it would make him think about attacking the\n&gt;Destrons again. He landed and picked up Pantron. He then lifted off and \n&gt;flew\n&gt;off to the Destron base.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
