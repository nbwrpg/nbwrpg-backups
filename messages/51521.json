Slowly, he made it back to his feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then he realized how damaged he was. There were some missing armor \n&gt; over most of his torso, and there was a gash from where a plasma \nshot \n&gt; had hit him. It took him a lot of will to overcome his damages and \n&gt; walk to Wolfenstein&#39;s side.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vlad: You... You are a good warrior... You have proven yourself with \n&gt; the wolf&#39;s soul... Here is what I suggest: either you become a \n&gt; bondsman to me, or we continue this fight. We both know we are weak. \n&gt; What say you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Farther, Tyrael sent a volley of needles that would be more accurate \n&gt; on Proto.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then it started. He felt at first Skulletron&#39; input. Images of the \ntwo \n&gt; predacon brothers, thier grief and hurt. That did not bother him. \nThey \n&gt; were mere predacons. They were soldiers that had chosen their paths. \n&gt; They were not his troops. Then, there was the Tripredacus and Preds \n&gt; living together. That was something else. He knew it was a lost \ncause \n&gt; to destroy every single predacon, as good as the average Tripredacus \n&gt; warrior was. But Megatron, he was the one, he was to be destroyed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then the Orb... It shown images... Incoherent... but promises of \npower \n&gt; above all. The fusion of two in one... Tyarius, whoever that was.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then Tyrael understood. He transformed to phoenix mode and flew \n&gt; downward and into the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was the Soul Orb. But before, he took something from the DNA \n&gt; container. He had been a strong warrior, just not skilled enough to \n&gt; prevent his death. Now, Tyrael thought, he would have a second \n&gt; chance...\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Chris Daniels&quot; &lt;dfinnamore@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; : : Skulletron : :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Skulletron suddenly shudders, and is distracted from what he is \n&gt; doing.  The Soul Orb&#39;s call strongly enters Skulletron&#39;s mind.  \nAfter \n&gt; struggling to make sense of it, it finally quits taking its toll on \n&gt; him.  However, in recieving the call, he also had visions.  Visions \nof \n&gt; the Orbs, visions of Empath, and unexplainable visions.  He looks \nover \n&gt; at Wolfenstein and Tyrael, and then prepares.  He connects his mind \n&gt; with Tyrael&#39;s mind.  After exploring his mind a little bit, \nSkulletron \n&gt; gets down to the dirty work.  He starts to send strong images to \n&gt; Tyrael&#39;s mind.  Pictures of transformers battling mindlessly flow \ninto \n&gt; Tyrael&#39;s mind.  And then, Skulletron starts to send visions of \n&gt; Tyrael&#39;s past into Tyrael&#39;s mind.  And then, pictures of Wolfenstein \n&gt; come in.  Wolfenstein and DrillBit, as young bots, playing like \n&gt; brothers do.  Them having good times together as they get older.  \nAnd \n&gt; then, DrillBit&#39;s death is shown.  And images of Wolfenstein grieving \n&gt; extremely, so much sadness.  Skulletron then begins to bring out the \n&gt; voices and images combined.  Multiple voices in Tyrael&#39;s mind, \ntelling \n&gt; him that this battle is pointless, telling him that its murder, \n&gt; telling him about peace, about sadness, and to make an alliance.  \nThe \n&gt; voices and images show happiness among the Tripreds and Predacons \n&gt; together.  All in attempts to sway Tyrael&#39;s emotions and convince \nhim \n&gt; to call this battle off and join for peace and happiness...\n\n\n"}}
