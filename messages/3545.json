And ah think she was \ntrailin&#39; boss-bot&#39;s group out in th&#39; forest.&quot; He broke one strap with the \ncobra jaw, ripping it with it&#39;s sharp, few teeth far in the back. Just then, \nhe saw the Maximal symbol on her. Quickstrike&#39;s hopes dropped. He slipped \nhis arms from the table and slumped his shoulder.\n\nOh, slag. She was a Maximal.\n\nBut it couldn&#39;t be. He swore he heard her and smelt her before. Quickstrike \nwas disgraced.\n\nHe went on fighting mentally with himself, trying to think back in the \nforest when he leg back damaged, trying to find out if it was really her in \nthat same forest.\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Trans formers&quot; &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Fri, 16 Jun 2000 15:56:49 MDT\n&gt;\n&gt;::DarkMouse::\n&gt;\n&gt;*she heard a soft voice near her and two others futher away.*\n&gt;&quot;Who are you?

He\n&gt; &gt;watched as she struggled with her wounds under the straps. He could tell\n&gt; &gt;clearly that she was in great pain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;He almost felt sorry for her. He stepped forward, with a curious, hurtful\n&gt; &gt;look in his eyes. He was going to do something. He was, after all, a\n&gt; &gt;gentlebot when he wanted to be. He knew there was one enemy near-by, and\n&gt; &gt;another that could knock his head off just for interfering. But slag \n&gt;those\n&gt; &gt;two, he was curious, and had to find out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;He quickly approached the table where she layed straped, listening\n&gt; &gt;carefully\n&gt; &gt;to the two spiders behind him.
