His hand goes up to hers, holding it \nto his cheek.\n\n&quot;I am thinking with my head,&quot; he says softly, the fact that Tavatron had \njogged up to them not regestering in his mind, &quot;I have a way to get out, but \nif they somehow do capture you, it won&#39;t work.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Allright, Maximals, playtime&#39;s over!&quot; Reptilica&#39;s voice sounds as he enters \nthe torture chambers, followed by Bloodystrike, Breakdown, Pyro, Punch, and \nScattershot. Autoguns emerge from the cealing, aiming at Dinobot, the \nremaining uncloaked Maximal.\n\n&quot;Allright, everyone, you&#39;re going to uncloak! If you don&#39;t, we&#39;ll simply kill \nyou all,&quot; Reptilica says, smiling evilly as the five bots behind him hold \ntheir weapons ready, the autoguns reinforcing his words even more.\n\nProwl growls silently. This was it.... His plan would need to prove itself...\n\n&quot;Ok, everyone, uncloak,&quot; he says quetly to Iron Raptor and Tavatron, \ndeactivating his own cloaking device as he reaches into a storage compartment.\n\nReptilica jumps back as Prowl appears right in front of him, the Maximal \nholding something in his hand. The Alliance member aims his gun at Prowl&#39;s \nhead.\n\n&quot;I knew you would cooperate, Maximal. It was smart of you, though, now your \ndeath might actually be kind,&quot; Reptilica says, his evil smile still on his \nface.\n\n&quot;Not so fast, Reptilica,&quot; Prowl says calmly, holding up the black device in \nhis hand. It was a small tube, with a button on top and a hand grip for easy \nholding. Prowl&#39;s thumb was over the button, &quot;Your troops fire and we all go \nup in flames.&quot;\n\nThe grin whipes itself off of Reptilica&#39;s face, the Alliance member growling \nat Prowl.\n\n&quot;And what makes you think that tube will blow us up, Maximal?&quot; Reptilica \nsays, keeping his gun aimed at Prowl&#39;s head.\n\n&quot;Simple,&quot; Prowl calmly responds, relaxing his stance into a casual position, \n&quot;Me and Dinobot paid a little visit to the engine room on our way here,&quot; he \nlies, &quot;Its filled with explosives. This is the detonator.&quot; Prowl moves his \nthumb slowly over the button, looking as he might press it at any time.\n\n&quot;Allright, Maximal,&quot; Reptilica growls, &quot;You&#39;re free to go. Just give me the \ndevice.&quot;\n\nProwl laughs. He wasn&#39;t about to fall for that. &quot;I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ll give \nit to you when me and my friends are safely outside your base. At the edge of \nthe clearing. If one shot hits any of us untill then, I&#39;m sure Zardus won&#39;t \nbe happy.&quot;\n\nReptilica snarls at the Maximal in front of him, ready to yell out in rage. \n&quot;You&#39;d kill us all, you fool! Including your &#39;friends&#39;.&quot;\n\nA nervious feeling runs through Prowl. &quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all be willing to give \nour lives to defeat you. Isn&#39;t that right, Dinobot?&quot;\n\nProwl waits for Dinobot&#39;s responce, hoping the fellow Maximal would answer \nyes. Reptilica turns his head at Dinobot, his eyes narrowing.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHiss and Scavanger yell in pain as shots hit them. They were facing three \nbots, and that wasn&#39;t the funnest thing in the world.\n\n&quot;Retreat, Maximals, just like your friends!&quot; Scavanger yell as he and Hiss \ncontinue to fire at Arcangel and Icedragon, the defences focusing their fire \non the other attacker.\n\n"}}
