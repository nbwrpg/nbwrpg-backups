Come and do your\nworst.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He fired a wide beam of concentrated light at her face, trying to\n&gt; &gt; blind her and overwhelm her optics.\n&gt; \n&gt; The light blinded her for a moment, &quot;Aaahhhhhh!!&quot; as she cringed back a \n&gt; moment, then regained herself as she barely caught sight of him &\nstarted towards \n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael: So, you really think Alpha Trion has waken you for you to live\n&gt; &gt; free? He might be Autobot, but the old geezer is no fool. You are\n&gt; &gt; there for a purpose. Even the Tripredacus Council knew that!\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, she growled at him. Alpha Trion was one of those she loathed.\nHe was \n&gt; one of those responsible or so she tagged, for the demise of her\nmentor... & \n&gt; one of Megatron&#39;s creators... Gamma Quadran. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I belong to no one,&quot; she growled at Tyrael. &quot;Least of all Alpha Trion!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As to a plan that was in store for her.. she didn&#39;t care. She made\nher own \n&gt; destiny. & as long as the Decepticons were a major part of it. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turned to Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael: By the way, Hydras, did you know that we were the ones\n&gt; &gt; manipulating the Predacons all along?\n&gt; \n&gt; She didn&#39;t wait for Hydras&#39; response to him. She wanted this Tripred so \n&gt; terribly, to feel his life fluids dripping through her claws after\nshe ripped him \n&gt; apart.\n&gt; \n&gt; She charged at him with her saber ready to strike. &quot;Best beg to\nPrimus, you \n&gt; will NEED it!&quot; she growled in hate & loathing. Pure evil dripping\nfrom her \n&gt; voice as her crimson optics glowed. Despite her damage, she went on.\nShe had to, \n&gt; she must. \n&gt; \n&gt; Swinging her saber hard at his neck, the other ready to jab at his\nmidsection \n&gt; or block if needed.\n\n\n"}}
