All the races Yerks, Andalites, \nHork-Bajir, and Taxxons (and dozens of others in the Ellimist \nChronicles) would be fairly primitive at this point. Let&#39;s go to their \nhomeworlds.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; there&#39;s a whole universe to explore, and we&#39;re dealing with a race \nof robots that can blend in anywhere. We have intelligent, imaginitive \npeople in this RPG, the possabilities are endless. I think we should \nhave one on the final frontier and see what happens. Transformers took \ntrips to Junkion, Nebulos, Char, and at least a dozen unnamed planets \nin the cartoon. Go into the comic and you&#39;ll find Hydrus 4 and other \nplanets that were never mentioned in the cartoon. If this group can&#39;t \nfind a way to explore a universe of possabilities then we&#39;re pathetic.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Legendarynemasis@a... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 12:41 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Debate (important everyone read)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;          You may have kept the people from going off Cybertron code, \nwhich would be unrealistic for Cybertrons. If we could expand the RPG \npast one singular world then that would create excitement and people \nwould post more often as there would be more to do. Storys could bloom \nand develop as charachter can interact with new things. Rather then \neveryone just fighting each other all the time and being fenced in. \n&gt;         Yahoo!
