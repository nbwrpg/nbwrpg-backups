His inner circuitry, though it had\nstayed in passive mode for long, still counted the nanocycles passing\naway. Then there was a small release signal, and activity slowly came\nback. First the spark containment system started emitting data, then\nthe spark itself soon began to take control of its body, gradually,\nuntil sensory input and kinetic response were up and running.\n\nHe realized that he was on a planetoid. The dusty ground beneath his\nmassive feet revealed that much. Seeing the blue and white planet far\naway and analyzing the immediate data he could gather about it, he\nrealized he was on a Moon. The Moon. He was at Searing Eye, the base\nwhere he, Unicron&#39;s Field General, would command the Great One&#39;s\narmies and claim the shining jewel he saw.\n\nHe rose to a stand. Dozens of smaller machine crawled about and some\neven climbed down from his enormous body. There was one who came and\nstood, advancing on five spidery legs, and bowed deferently in front\nof him.\n\n- Greetings General Vorpal. The Great Lord has requested your\nawakening. The time of war is approaching.\n\n- I know. How is the construction of the base progressing?\n\n- Very well, General. The trenches have been dug and we are currently\narrying the metallic crystals in them. It will all be ready before we\nstrike.\n\n- That is well. Go now. I must be alone.\n\nSilently, the drone walked away, and the General was alone with\nhimself. He looked intently at Earth&#39;s orb and called out...\n\n- My brothers and sisters, hear me for I am the First Awakened of\nUnicron&#39;s mighty armies! Join me! Come back to me and heed your\nMaster&#39;s unwavering call! Awaken, all of you!\n\nOOC: This is Vorpal, the only Minion NPC who isn&#39;t a drone, and, at\nthe same time, the Minion Leader.\n\n\n\n"}}
