It is twice the size of most shuttles, but most of it&#39;s \nmass is filled with cargo, from energon cubes (probably not needed) \nto shield generators, to ammo (happy now).  Only one bot is on \nboard.  He sits at the control, his demeanor quiet, and contemplating \nas he heads towards Earth.\n\nHe scans the planet and sees the Predicon frequency.\n\nBot:  I knew I&#39;d find Megatron here when the portal opened.  This was \nthe only logical place for him to go.  Too bad he seems to have \nstarted the party without me, but maybe I can still help him with \nthose Autobot hero wanna bes.\n\nHe turns his shuttle to land close to a hundred miles from the \nPredicon base.\n\nBot:  Soon the Maximals will feel the wrath of Flicker.\n\n\n"}}
