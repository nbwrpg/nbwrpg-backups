He looks down at Nue&#39;e as she comes up to him and peeks \naround him at the IF. There wern&#39;t too many femms in the Alliance, \nand Perndabot wasn&#39;t too used to having femms near him, but he forced \nhis attention to remain on Biomass, watching the bot for any \nsuspicious activity.\n\n&quot;You can join, yeah,&quot; he says, keeping one eye on Nue&#39;e, &quot;Why don&#39;t \nall three of you follow me to Zardus? He&#39;s our commander.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Biomass almost has a sparkattack when Perndabot raised the \nmissile \n&gt; launcher to his chest, snaking his tenticles back to cover it so \nthat it at \n&gt; least had a little protection if they decided to shot.\n&gt; Nue&#39;e looked, eyes wide at Perndabot, her own spark in her throat \nand \n&gt; standing stark still.  There beings were hostile, and they were \nsupposed to \n&gt; mingle with them? This was going to harder then they thought.\n&gt; But both Biomass and Nue&#39;e relax as Perndabot removes the launched \nfrom it&#39;s \n&gt; location at Biomass&#39;s chest, sighing in relief.\n&gt; Biomass blinked as he listened to Perndabot introduce himself. His \ngaze \n&gt; shifted to the Iron Fist when he gestured to it.\n&gt; This was the place they were going to stay? How.....wonderful.\n&gt; Nue&#39;e took a few steps forward and looked even closer at the Iron \nFist, her \n&gt; view blocked by Perndabot so she moved up and peeked around his \nbody to see \n&gt; the base.\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t as nice looking as their ship but she was sure that they \nhad a \n&gt; perfect lab.\n&gt; Biomass kept his eyes on Perndabot until he noticed Swift, looking \ndown at \n&gt; her and waving a tenticle at her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hello.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But then Biomass looked back towards Perndabot.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Our ship just crashed here and you were the closest faction to \nus. I \n&gt; decided to join you, if I can.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Me too.&quot; *came the voice from Nue&#39;e as she looked straight up at \nPerndabot \n&gt; before stepping around him and looking at the Iron Fist.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
