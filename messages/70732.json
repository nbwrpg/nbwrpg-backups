He smiles.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I can see how you got your name. Highly perceptive =\r\nof you. Thank you Legacy, you&#39;ve shed a lot of light on many of my question=\r\ns. Now that I know my lineage, it&#39;s time I lived up to it. First things fir=\r\nst, Perceptor and I could do with getting our sight back, and if you could =\r\ndo that I&#39;d greatly appreciate it, Stanton. Next, we have insectoids hiding=\r\n beneath the Black Fortress tunnels, which have to be shown a lesson about =\r\ntampering with what is not theirs. And Hydras last of all, could use a less=\r\non in that as well. Nobody tampers with any Autobot and gets away with it. =\r\nEspecially when they tamper with a Prime.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy merely nodded, hi=\r\ns single optic pulsing slightly as he accepted\nTuscon&#39;s words.\n\n&quot;We can wor=\r\nk on getting your sight back Tuscon.&quot; Santon said, his tone\ngrave and serio=\r\nus, &quot;However I would need to run complete scans of\nPerceptor to know if it =\r\nis possible to do so. For some the damage can\nbe so extensive that it would=\r\n require a complete cranial\nreconstruction to fix the problem.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; He turns his head toward Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; They caused great harm to you Rod=\r\nimus, and I&#39;ll see to it, with your help, that they get it back in return. =\r\nIf Optimus Prime could fend off Megatron, I&#39;m sure I can follow in his foot=\r\nsteps, and fend off the enemy at hand. Both Hydras and Cylconus need to be =\r\ndealt with accordingly. Rodimus voiced an interest in dealing with Hydras a=\r\nnd so do I. Two Primes against an evil leader is sure to topple even the mo=\r\nst evil of warlords. But our war does not end with just us. If we&#39;re going =\r\nto send those Decepticons and Predicons packing, we&#39;ll need every Autobot a=\r\nnd Maximal we have in our ranks to pull this off. Lord Elder, I&#39;d like you =\r\nto contact Lord Perseus, and assemble a Maximal/ Autobot assembly. The more=\r\n we get together, the stronger we&#39;ll be.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus was begining to l=\r\nook decidedly better as an intervenous tube\nof energon continued to feed hi=\r\nm energon in small but steady amounts.\nHe clutched his hand and then flexed=\r\n it, smiling as he did so. &quot;Yes,\nwe need to do some serious pest control.&quot; =\r\nhe said as he looked up at\nTuscon.\n\nRodimus rubbed his chest with his hand,=\r\n &quot;Don&#39;t forget Cyclonus, like\nyou has been rebuilt by the forces of the Mat=\r\nrix, do not underestimate\nhis power.&quot; Rodimus frowned, &quot;I did, and it cost =\r\nus so very much.&quot;\n\nRodimus clenched his fist again, &quot;But I am ready.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;O=\r\nLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon smiled and said &quot;Then I will need the help of LEgacy and Sant=\r\non.\n&gt; Rodimus&quot;said the female &quot;I think that would bee good idea that you be=\r\n there,\n&gt; if your health allows you&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor did a malicious grin &quot;An=\r\n excursion to BlackFortress wont be\n&gt; necesary... cause the only copy of al=\r\nl my reseachs and reprogramation files\n&gt; are with me. Any rival scientist w=\r\nill use the fruits of my reseachs... With\n&gt; out my consent&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs the =\r\nothers talked Bump came in with Nightlight on the suspensor\nbed, she was st=\r\nill unconscious. A small deep beeping told anyone\nlistening that she was in=\r\n deep stassis.\n\nLegacy stepped over to the rear section of the room, away f=\r\nrom the\nothers and gestured for Bump to bring her over as he began to exami=\r\nne\nher. &quot;From our initial scans, it would appear she is nearly blank, no\nse=\r\ncondary modes or weapons, even her memory banks appear to be only\nslightly =\r\nformed.&quot; Legacy continued to scan, &quot;However I am detecting\nresidual memory =\r\nentries that have not been completely deleted. I do\nnot believe she cannot =\r\naccess them.&quot; He looked up at Tuscon, &quot;I can\nattempt to restore them.&quot;\n\n(TA=\r\nG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
