The DINOBOTS had never been openly\n&gt; hostile to other Autobots, and thsi would have transferred over to MAXIMALS\n&gt; as well in theory.  But he had not heard from his friends mostly since the\n&gt; end of the GREAT WAR.  What had changed in that period of time that had\n&gt; shifted?  From the mere snippets of stories he had heard, it did not sound\n&gt; as if the DINOBOTS had been reprogramed in any such way.\n&gt;\n&gt; Much less literally a full scale assault over upon a shuttle, an act which\n&gt; he could not fathom them doing.  Either they were not control of their own\n&gt; shells, they were merely lookalikes in some way..  Or something horrible had\n&gt; happened the likes of which he could not iamgine.\n&gt;\n&gt; Getting static over from his communicator and not able to pick up anything\n&gt; beyond visual range on his scanners, he could not leave here to search for\n&gt; anyone without the possibility of going through thousands of kilometers of\n&gt; rainforest in random directions with no guarantee of finding anyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE paused quietly, and as he lsitened to the two, he took out a small\n&gt; datapadd, and on it he began taking notes.  Of MAGMATRON, of SABREBACK.  Of\n&gt; this small outpost out in the middle of nowhere.  Of the incapacitated\n&gt; RODIMUS.  Of the escapees who were hiding.  Writing it to try and make it\n&gt; make sense.  Using an old Quintesson binary sequencing which was obvious\n&gt; enough to anyone who knew the language, but he didn&#39;t expect many Maximals\n&gt; of this era who were not historians to have had any encounters with it,\n&gt; which made it safe enough to record his thoughts in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing over at the group as they came out, he said simply, &quot;We wait.\n&gt; Eventually, things will abate.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from UNUS, &quot;A very prudent course.&quot; he said in a\nsagely manner. &quot;There are more things in this jungle, good Wheelie,\nThan can be dreamt of in most poeple&#39;s philsophy.&quot;\n\nASTRA smiled as she stood next to UNUS while looking at WHEELIE,\n&quot;Perhaps he would like something to eat, to recharge himself while he\nawaits what ever he is awaiting?&quot;\n\nUNUS nodded, &quot;Of course my dear of course.&quot; He patted ASTRA on the\nshoulder as he smiled, &quot;Why don&#39;t you take him and go get some energon\nfor him.&quot;\n\nFIREHORN just shook his head. &quot;There she goes again. She takes in all\nthe strays.&quot;\n\nUNUS glanced at FIREHORN, &quot;There is something that can be learned from\nher giving nature. Something that even you can learn.&quot;\n\nFIREHORN grunted but said nothing else.\n\n&quot;Darkhoof, go see whatelse you can find out about the others that have\ncome in tothe jungle.&quot;\n\nDARKHOOF nodded and then as if like a lightswitched being turned off\nhe vanished from sight.\n\nMeanwhile ASTRA turned to WHEELIE with her bright and cheeye smile,\n&quot;Shall we then?&quot; she holds an arm out for WHEELIE to take if he liked.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
