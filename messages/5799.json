I need to get away for a bit. All this\n&gt; inactivity&#39;s dulling my senses. I can see it in the other Maximals,\n&gt; they&#39;ve lost thier edge on this planet. We were given these senses \nto\n&gt; adapt to this planet, not to colinize it.&quot; The thought of technology\n&gt; winning out over nature sickened him. Maybe being one of this \nplanets\n&gt; natural creatures for a time distorted the yechnological side of \nhim,\n&gt; maybe not. Either way the Maximals were inadvertently doing what \nthey\n&gt; set out to prevent.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We need to stay sharp Wing, back at the Ark I smelled something,\n&gt; even the sensors didn&#39;t notice. Nobody noticed it except me. If our\n&gt; leaders rely on technology that much then we&#39;ll all end up looking\n&gt; like the Ark. I for one wouldn&#39;t want that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
