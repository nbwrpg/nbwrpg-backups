She replaced her weapon in her back compartment and then looked at Teltoli, she didn&#39;t care what anybot said...she didn&#39;t like the Alliance!\nShe crossed her arms and kept a close optic on Icedemon, she just had a bad feeling every time she was around them.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
