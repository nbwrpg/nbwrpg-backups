Yet, he spins=\r\n somewhat due to the impact but is quickly righted by Rat Trap who is now i=\r\nnside him, as he floors the pedal to the metal, getting Tucson into the shu=\r\nttle, via a ramp that Quickstride releases for a short moment of time.  He =\r\ncomes to a screeching halt inside, as he jumps out quickly.\n\n&quot; Just in time=\r\n Lord Elder, I thought we were done for!&quot;  \n\nQuickstride rushes right over =\r\nto Tucson and assesses his condition.  He frantically tries to find an emer=\r\ngency energy line that will fit into his gas port.\n\n&quot;Holy slag..  Just an h=\r\nour more and he would&#39;ve been ready for the Autobot graveyard.  Hang in the=\r\nre big guy, you&#39;re safe now.&quot;\n\nRat Trap notices a fuel door poping open.  \n=\r\n\n&quot;There, that&#39;s his fuel port.  Did ya bring any energon?&quot;\n\nQuickstride nod=\r\nds, as he lets down a canister of energon.\n\n&quot;Hmm, just about ten gallon&#39;s w=\r\north of fuel, which should last &#39;em till we get back to the Ark. The backup=\r\n battery is gonna need at least forty eight hours to recharge...  I think.&quot;=\r\n\n\nQuickstride hooks Tucson to the emergency Energon tank, and slowly introd=\r\nuces it to his system.  Tucson remains in SUV form to conserve the remainde=\r\nr of what he had left in his emergency tank.\n\nRat Trap sits beside Tucson a=\r\nnd doesn&#39;t move.\n\n&quot; If ya don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like ta stay with Wheels.  I wann=\r\na make sure he comes outa this okay.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds, and leaves Rat Tr=\r\nap with Tucson while returning to Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; It&#39;s kinda nice ta see Rat=\r\n Trap bonding with someone, especially an Autobot.  He&#39;s got a hard time ma=\r\nkn&#39; friends, so any friend he makes, is a good thing. The big guy will be o=\r\nkay, but I think it&#39;ll take &#39;em a while before he&#39;s a hundred percent.&quot;\n\nRa=\r\nt Trap turns to Quickstride and Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; And I&#39;ll be right there when=\r\n he recovers.  After all, once he gets to the Ark, he&#39;ll feel a whole lot b=\r\netter.&quot;\n\nThe word &quot;Ark somewhat brings Tucson around.  Yet he remains in SU=\r\nV form.\n\n&quot;Ark..  Optimus Prime...&quot;\n\nRat Trap puts his hand on Tucson&#39;s hood=\r\n.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right Wheels, that&#39;s right.  Lord Elder has been guardn&#39; the Ark=\r\n for ya so that if by chance, an Autobot was still functioning, it would be=\r\n kept safe for them until they could get back in action. &quot;\n\nTucson backs up=\r\n and tries to face Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; I owe Lord Elder my utmost gratitude.  If=\r\n - you had not guarded the - Ark, all would - have been lost.  I - thank yo=\r\nu deeply for your\nloyalty, and - constant vigil over the Autobot vessel.  O=\r\nnce I - figure out how to revive my comrades, I - will be sure they know of=\r\n your valliant efforts to - protect what is most precious to us. R - Rat Ta=\r\np.  You too, have - shown bravery in your actions.  I owe you as much, if n=\r\not more of my loyalty to you.  without - your help, I would not have gotten=\r\n out of that fortress.&quot;\n\nRat Trap tries to hold back what appears to be tea=\r\nrs.\n\n&quot;Aw gee Wheels, ain&#39;t nothn&#39;.  What&#39;re friends for?&quot;\n\nQuickstride secu=\r\nres Tucson so he does not damage his frame any further.\n\n&quot;Easy big guy, you=\r\n&#39;ve gotten enough dents for one day.&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n\n&quot; Sorry, I - didn&#39;t k=\r\nnow there was a third comrade aboard.  Thank you for  your help.  I will be=\r\n sure to remember to reward you when all is said - and done.&quot;\n\nRat Trap tra=\r\nnsforms into his rat form, and sits up onto Tucson&#39;s hood.\n\n&quot;Hope this does=\r\nn&#39;t hurt Wheels, but I can talk to ya a lot better on your hood.&quot;\n\nTucson r=\r\nemains perfectly still.\n\n&quot;Not - at all.  Lord Elder, I - have one favor to =\r\nask you.  I&#39;d - like to pay my respects to Optimus - Prime once we arrive a=\r\nt the Ark. Do - I have permission to enter the Ark to do so?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrp=\r\ng@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I int=\r\nend to finish what I started, I will finish my mission,\n&gt; &gt; but after that,=\r\n do not expect me to have the same amount\n&gt; &gt; of respect for you when this =\r\nis all over Rodimus. But now,\n&gt; &gt; is not the time for that. I see that what=\r\n I accomplished was\n&gt; &gt; just the first phase. I&#39;ve accomplished that thus f=\r\nar. I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; learned for myself what needs to be done, and what needs\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\no be done can&#39;t be completed today. That will have to wait.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; =\r\nI believe this is where you step asside Rodimus, and let us pass.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rod=\r\nimus stood before Tuscon, weapon drawn and ready as the Autobot\n&gt; went thro=\r\nugh his soliloquy, the look on his face hard and resolute.\n&gt; The Rodimus th=\r\nat stands there, is not exactly the Rodimus Tuscon had\n&gt; once known, the Pr=\r\nedacon programing had twisted him, inverted his\n&gt; thoughts, changed him in =\r\nways that even he found surprising in some\n&gt; ways.\n&gt; \n&gt; However even now as=\r\n this lone Autobot spoke about dedication and\n&gt; courage, there was a part o=\r\nf him that was opened for a moment, as if\n&gt; for the briefest of seconds a p=\r\nart of the old Rodimus briefly made an\n&gt; appearance . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;NO Autobot,=\r\n this is where you face termination!&quot; Cyclonus spoke as he\n&gt; and Scourge ca=\r\nught up, breaking into Rodimus&#39; revelry  &quot;It is time to\n&gt; finish this!&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Yes&quot; Said Skorponok as he stepped out of the room, weapons already\n&gt; ori=\r\nenting on the Autobot. &quot;He thinks he&#39;s Optimus Prime&quot; Scorponok\n&gt; said, his=\r\n voice sarcastic and mocking, &quot;But he is only a pale copy.&quot;\n&gt; He chuckled, =\r\n&quot;But I do so look forward to his dissection.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Scourge just chuckled da=\r\nrkly as he approached, his rifle pointed at\n&gt; Tuscon and Rat Trap!\n&gt; \n&gt; (Me=\r\nanwhile in the Autobot shuttle)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Quickstride gets the shuttle airbour=\r\nne and sets the course\n&gt; &gt; for the tower. He tries to lock in on an Autobot=\r\n signature,\n&gt; &gt; and gets Rat Trap&#39;s readilly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord elder nodded as he =\r\nbrought the shuttle as close as he dared to\n&gt; the Black Fortress! He knew h=\r\now powerful this demesne of the Predacons\n&gt; could be. Designed to hold off =\r\nan assault, Lord Elder knew his plan\n&gt; was risky. He could only hope that R=\r\nat Trap had been able to do\n&gt; something on his side.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sir, I&#39;ve lock=\r\ned in on Rat Trap&#39;s signature.... And yes, I do\n&gt; &gt; see a faint but very fa=\r\nint Autobot signature... It&#39;s a bit weaker\n&gt; &gt; than normal... Which Oh wow,=\r\n sir, that Autobot seems to be\n&gt; &gt; using a backup battery... Not good... Be=\r\ncause when he loses\n&gt; &gt; that he&#39;s done for.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Confirmed.&quot; he said as h=\r\ne also saw the same things on his scanner.\n&gt; &quot;The sensors also show several=\r\n Decepticon and Predacon signatures\n&gt; around them, if we don&#39;t do something=\r\n Tuscon and Rat trap would be\n&gt; destroyed anyway.&quot; With deft fingers he bro=\r\nught the weapons energy\n&gt; cannons online and quickly brought them to bear o=\r\nn the fortress.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hold onto your seat, this is going to get rough!&quot; Eld=\r\ner said as he\n&gt; transferred power from the engines to the gunnery platform,=\r\n in other\n&gt; words throwing everything the shuttle had at the Fortress!\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The shuttle shook for a moment as its fore cannons glowed and then\n&gt; spewe=\r\nd out a massive burst of energy that bathed the fortress in pure\n&gt; destruct=\r\nive power!\n&gt; \n&gt; Back inside the Fortress the very base shook as it absorbed=\r\n the\n&gt; massive onslaught from the Autobot shuttle! The lights flickered as\n=\r\n&gt; energy fields went down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus, Scourge and Rodimus were knocked =\r\noff their feet and\n&gt; Scorponok was sent sailing back into the torture chamb=\r\ner as the world\n&gt; inside the Fortress went completely dark for a moment and=\r\n then winked\n&gt; back on dimly as emergency lights came online.\n&gt; \n&gt; An alert=\r\n sounded, it would be only be less than 30 seconds before the\n&gt; Fortress&#39; c=\r\nomputer reset the system and brought itself and all the\n&gt; bases&#39; systems ba=\r\nck on line!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile outside Lord Elder struggle frantically to redir=\r\nect the\n&gt; shuttle&#39;s energy from the weapons and back to the engines, as the=\r\n\n&gt; shuttle at the moment was falling from the skies, looking less like\n&gt; th=\r\ne elegant flying machine it was and more like a brick!\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: I wrote i=\r\nn the affected to the Fortress with Airly&#39;s permission)\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Pre=\r\nston\n&gt; (Cyclonus & Scourge/Scorponok/Rodimus/Lord Elder)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
