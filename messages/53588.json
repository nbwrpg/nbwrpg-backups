If I \n&gt; &gt; installed a flight mode and associated components on your current \n&gt; &gt; body, it would take a few hours.  On the other hand, building a \n&gt; &gt; transformer shell from scratch could take days - but it&#39;s a lot \nmore \n&gt; &gt; authentic.  Or we could combine the two, giving you a temporary \n&gt; &gt; upgrade to tide you over until your new body is ready.  Either \nway, \n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re putting a lot of trust in me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s do it. I&#39;m tired of this pathetic form.&quot; She didn&#39;t say that \nit was \n&gt; Alpha Trion within Vector Sigma that gave her the form & revived \nher. As to \n&gt; WHY he revived her, she did not know. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Just construct my original form & do what upgrades you can on this \none. IF \n&gt; that is possible.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She smirked. &quot;Besides, if you are anything like the Autobot \nWheeljack I \n&gt; &#39;knew&#39; of, then such a task is nothing.&quot;\n\n&quot;Eh, it&#39;s no problem.&quot;  Wheeljack-X pops out a scanning tool and \nbegins measuring her body to see what he has to work with.  &quot;I like \ndoing this sort of thing.&quot;  After a few moments of examination and \nplanning, he projects a scaled-down wireframe image of her body in \nthe air, and next to it a similar image of the vehicle mode that \nwould best match such a body type.  Superimposing the two, he gets a \nrough blueprint to work from.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna have to take you offline \nfor a while, while I install the upgrade.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
