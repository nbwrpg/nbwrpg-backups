He too was worried and continues to keep his e=\r\nars and eyes peeled in\n&gt; &gt; all directions. He paws his left front hoof.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Just what I was thinkn&#39; Rodimus. I wonder if they got tipped off=\r\n about\n&gt; &gt; our plan of action.. Slippery stuff when there&#39;s a mole involved=\r\n that we\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know about..&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From where Night Shift was, he=\r\n could not see the seekers, yet, just by\n&gt; &gt; his radar systems, he could de=\r\nfinitely tell that there was a flying brigade\n&gt; &gt; around the fortress. He s=\r\nlowly comes to a stop.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Be careful out there.&quot; Rodimu=\r\ns said as something came to mind with the\n&gt; &gt; talk about a mole, &quot;I remembe=\r\nr that one of the new guys could turn\n&gt; &gt; invisible.&quot; Rodimus paused trying=\r\n to remember who it was, but finally\n&gt; &gt; continued, &quot;I am not sure which on=\r\ne, they had just arrived. One of them\n&gt; &gt; could easily be watching us and w=\r\ne would never know it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Keep in mind, unless you are at or nea=\r\nr the Pred base scanning it\n&gt; &gt; would be difficult. The same can be said fo=\r\nr the Maximal base. If you&#39;re at\n&gt; &gt; the pred base, scanning the Max base w=\r\nould be next to impossible without\n&gt; &gt; some sort of satellite or specialize=\r\nd gear.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I got an idea. It&#39;s a long shot, no p=\r\nun intended but it might work. I am\n&gt; &gt; equipped with long range equipment.=\r\n What if Kup used me as a cross bow, to\n&gt; &gt; take out some of those seekers,=\r\n create a diversion so that way Windlord and\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap could make it ins=\r\nide?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Night Shift spins a tire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I dunno, sounds ri=\r\nsky... What if they barrel after us? I ain&#39;t a\n&gt; &gt; speedster.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nStraight Shot looks at him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; It&#39;s worth a shot. Let&#39;s run it b=\r\ny Tucson.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson now recieves a message from Straight Shot. He=\r\n ponders the daring\n&gt; &gt; move.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hmm, that would work as a divers=\r\nion but it&#39;s extremely risky... But\n&gt; &gt; nothing we&#39;ve never dealth with bef=\r\nore.. All right, perhaps it is necesary\n&gt; &gt; to make a move. Straight Shot, =\r\nKup, I want you to position yourselves as\n&gt; &gt; best you can. Kup, take robot=\r\n mode, Straight Shot, cross bow mode, and\n&gt; &gt; program your trajectory setti=\r\nngs to long range. Be sure to conceal\n&gt; &gt; yourselves amply. Night Shift, I&#39;=\r\nll need you to remain in vehicle mode, for\n&gt; &gt; a quick getaway. Rodimus, Qu=\r\nickstride, it has now come to my attention that\n&gt; &gt; unless a diversion is e=\r\nxecuted, Rat Trap and Windlord may not make it into\n&gt; &gt; the fortress safely=\r\n. Straight Shot is going to provide the diversion along\n&gt; &gt; with Kup&#39;s help=\r\n. Be prepared, once this diversion is in place, we may need\n&gt; &gt; you two to =\r\nget into battle mode to fend off any seeker that tries to attempt\n&gt; &gt; an at=\r\ntack on the Ark. I know these changes are sudden, but unfortunately,\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nere is a lot of uncertainty in this mission. All right, battle stations\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n everyone, things are about to get rocky.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Out =\r\nahead of the group the sweeps continue to fly through the air,\n&gt; &gt; seemingl=\r\ny unaware of the Maximals and Autobots that are preparing for their\n&gt; &gt; att=\r\nack. They swoop around, obviously in some sort of patrol pattern, flying\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; first over one section and then over another. Their movements are\n&gt; &gt; sur=\r\nprisingly well orchestrated, they are either seasoned hunters or they\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nave been trained by one who is. The air beneath their flight path rippled\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; with heat, the magma beneath them was incredibly hot.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I gotcha.=\r\n&quot; Rodimus said over the radio comlink to Tuscon. &quot;We are ready\n&gt; &gt; here bac=\r\nk at the base should anyone of the Predacons get foolish and attack\n&gt; &gt; us.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus paused and then continued, &quot;Also, I think I remember that=\r\n one of\n&gt; &gt; the new guys that came with Cyclonus when he returned could tur=\r\nn invisible,\n&gt; &gt; and I think even teleport. I can&#39;t remember which one, but=\r\n be very careful\n&gt; &gt; out there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
