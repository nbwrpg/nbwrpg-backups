A large \nform \n&gt; then made its way through and flew towards the planet. It \nressembled some \n&gt; kind of winged whale, but it was obviously not an organic being. \nHowever, \n&gt; the very way it moved told of organic origins...\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the ship, three transformers operated the Shadow Destiny. \nThey were \n&gt; the Prophets, the elite Tripredacus Strike Force.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gesper:\n&gt; We are on final approach of Earth. Geostationnary orbit in 3,2, \n1... stable \n&gt; orbit achieved.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ship&#39;s wings flailed in the void of space to keep it over a \nprecise \n&gt; continent of the planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Melchana:\n&gt; Target in sight. I can fire whenever you wish.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; Prepare the key to vector Sigma. Fire when you have a lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; Melchana:\n&gt; What? We have the key with us? This is utter madness! You \njeopardize this \n&gt; mission by bringing it with us!\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; Shut up, sister! The key shall be terminated as soon as we have no \nmore use \n&gt; for it, and that time will be right after you have fired it! Now \nstop \n&gt; discussing and do your job!\n&gt; \n&gt; Melchana reluctantly agreed with her elder brother, but she would \nnever say \n&gt; it to anyone else. She knew it was necessary to the operation...\n&gt; She fired and she looked through the monitors. The whole continent \nwas being \n&gt; technologicized...\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; Now, Melchana, fire the reformatting cannon...\n&gt; \n&gt; She fired the gun once again. This time, the continent started to \nreflorish \n&gt; and it became techno-organic. Australia had become a fusion of \norganisms and \n&gt; technology.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; Prepare for atmospherical entry. Gesper, land the Shadow Destiny at \nthe \n&gt; Southeast point of Australia and prepare it for deployment. \nMelchana, track \n&gt; the Hellgate and send a message to lieutenant Daemos concerning our \narrival. \n&gt; Finally, jettisson the key to vector sigma and fire the \nreformatting cannon \n&gt; on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The key, hit by the ray, started glowing brightly and exploded. Its \nlight \n&gt; could be seen from many places on the earth.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
