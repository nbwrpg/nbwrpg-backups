He follows up by sending three more \nlightning blasts at Mantle.\n\nDivebomb transforms, using his heightened agility to dodge straight \nup many of the shots heading at him. Two of the shots smash into \nhis metallic wings, leaving charred marks, and almost knocking \nhim from the sky. His rocket boosters send him straight up at an \nincreasing speed, away from the near battle.\n\nRampage is so angry; consequently, he has lost &quot;it&quot;. As one of the \nlaser blasts hits him, he dives to the ground, dodging the missiles \nand the rest of the shots. He transforms into tiger mode as he hits \nthe ground. Immediately, he begins firing as much as he can, \npumping out continues rounds from his four leg mounted machine \nguns at Astral, and the bots around him.\n\n\n\nOn 2 Apr 2001, at 19:44, Jen D. wrote:\n\n&gt; (ooc: I&#39;m not good at battles, so sorry if this is confusing :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyndro&#39;s scanners detected weaponfire outside the Element, and quickly made \n&gt; a scan to find out who the attackers were. Soon he knew the location and \n&gt; weaponry of every Decepticon in the area.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You might wanna go out there and fight them, Rubble, we&#39;re under attack.&quot; \n&gt; he says through a speaker to Rubble, who thanks him and runs out of the \n&gt; base. Cyndro reroutes more power to the shields, and then activates the \n&gt; defences.\n&gt; \n&gt; The round plate on top of the Element flashed several times, and then a \n&gt; deafening screech was emmited over all comm frequencees other than the ones \n&gt; that the Maximals were using. After a few seconds, the screech shut off, and \n&gt; a jamming signal was sent out to disable any communications that the enemies \n&gt; might have. During the screech, most of the weapons on the Element fired at \n&gt; the hopefully distracted bots, sending four EMP blasts, one missile, and \n&gt; five plasma shots at each one, other than the ones that were shielded by the \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire (I think FireBlade is the only one shielded :).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Mantle spun around when all the enemies arrived, and was immediately ready \n&gt; for battle. He flew into the air and stretched out both arms. A missile flew \n&gt; out of each arm, both of them mentally guided by Mantle to hit \n&gt; Rippersnapper. Out of the corner of his eyes, Mantle could see Aqua firing \n&gt; his spear gun at Flesh Ripper, the same bot that he had tried to get during \n&gt; the last battle. Near him, Cinder was already firing at Rippersnapper. \n&gt; Mantle knew that Cinder wanted to impress Prowl, but he hoped that she \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t do stupid things to show off.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Allright, guys, we&#39;ll fight like this for a while, and then we&#39;ll form \n&gt; Element and chase these guys out of here!&quot; he said to his team over the \n&gt; commlink, watching Rubble emerge from the Element with his missile launcher \n&gt; and fire two missiles at Rampage. Mist flew by above him, firing three \n&gt; charges down at Autofire.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
