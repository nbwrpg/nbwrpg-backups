And I&#39;m glad to know someone likes Tazz, \nSoulstice. Who do you think hit Stone Cold? It thinks it&#39;s either \nBilly Gunn, Tazz or Test.)\n\nVulois\n\nVulois&#39; temper was getting to hot. Convix tried to calm him down.\n\nControl! You must control!\n\nBut they are destroying peace!\n\nYou can&#39;t kill them. Not yet atleast. But make the pain surge in \nthem. Remember, when a bot tried to attack the Embassy. You fed the \npain into his circuts of a death on Cybertron. Do it to all of them.\n\nAll of them?\n\nYes. I can help you.\n\nAll right.\n\nVulois focused, using his energy to make a psycic link between him \nand the minds of his enemies. He tapped into the part of their body \nthat registered pain. He messed with it, putting on the max right \nbefore death. He gave them an image with it. Everyone on Cybertron \nliving peacefuly, as techno-organic creatures. Except for them. They \nwould burn in the Pitt forever, always experiencing torture.\n\n&quot;Feel the pain that stands in th way of peace!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nAs he walked ot the cargo room, Prebon answered Slayer&#39;s question.\n\n&quot;Who is she? Wouldn&#39;t you like to know. But no more speaking of the \npast. It&#39;s an order.&quot;\n\nBut than, at the cargo room, he saw the hatred that was building \nbetween them. And then he realized it: Slayer isn&#39;t only different \nthan Striker, he is the exact opposite. He loves what Striker hates, \nsuch as death and hatred. He hates what Striker loves: Spears. He ad \nto stop this.\n\n&quot;Spears! Slayer! Enough! We are on this team together, and I will not \nhave this! If you have a problem with one another, you will deal with \nit on your own time, and not through a way that would damage my top \ntwo recruits. Now, Slayer, try the suit on. It&#39;s made from a dead \nMaximal. Spears, come with me. We must talk.&quot;\n\nSpears went just outside the cargo room.\n\n\n"}}
