I am KitKat, Once great leader of the Predacons. i \nkilled more bots than he&#39;s had hot meals.&quot; she muttered to herself \ninside the chamber. She realized that it was her in the chamber and \nnot him. She sighed and wondered if she was getting slow in her old \nage. After all, she was one of the few from ages back. Not many bots \ncould have survived that war. If they did, they would be extremely \nfew in number. But then again, she reflected on how it was her in the \nchamber and not that pompus, egotistical, shovanistic, waste of metal \nmale who put her in the chamber. He may have won this round. But \nshe&#39;d get him and finish him off when she saw her chance.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor moved towards the Brigde of Predacon&#39;s base\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; : : SharpClaw : :\n&gt; &gt; SharpClaw: The dart effect will wear off, but we&#39;ll speed it up \nin \n&gt; the CR.\n&gt; &gt; SharpClaw takes KitKat to an CR chamber, placing her within it, \n&gt; and starting a heal cycle.\n&gt; &gt;  aerosmith4e@a... wrote:Carnatron felt her frequency fading.

He took a small piece of his black organism covering his \n&gt; body and \n&gt; &gt; placed it on Kit Kat. He gave it one instruction to keep her \nalive \n&gt; until the \n&gt; &gt; CR chamber fixed her. The suit to his knowledge would only \n&gt; willingly seperate \n&gt; &gt; from him when he willed it to. When the organism was placed on \nKit \n&gt; Kat it \n&gt; &gt; would listen to her as well. If it changed her at all it would be \n&gt; diffrent \n&gt; &gt; then his change since he was a pure energon body when it attached \n&gt; to him. (If \n&gt; &gt; you want you can just have it die when she gets fixed or have it \n&gt; change her a \n&gt; &gt; little bit whatever floats your boat.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She was unconsious from the dart.

Her optics flickered as her program tried to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; restart despite the dart&#39;s sedative effects. Even out cold her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; programs wouldn&#39;t give up. Yet, she remained unconsious. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
