As Rodimus taunts him=\r\n, he simply ignores him, not uttering one word about it for a moment or so,=\r\n and he also had Hydras breathing down his neck configuratively. Still he k=\r\neeps calm throughout, and first directs his attention to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Failure=\r\n? Hmm, Rodimus I don&#39;t know. To you it may seem like failure, to me, yes, i=\r\nt was a mistake but also a learning experience. Learn not to go too fast, y=\r\net make decisions carefully. So, yes, I configuratively got a flat tire alo=\r\nng the way. But tires can be changed and after that, it&#39;s back on the road =\r\nlike nothing happened. Of course to you, it&#39;s like a perpetual road block. =\r\nThere, you have my answer. Nothing more.&quot;\n\nHe quietly follows orders by dis=\r\ncarding his weaponry. Having left his cross bow behind, he merely gives up =\r\nan old sword and spear, as his weapons. He somehow felt that if he came wit=\r\nh the bare minimal he wouldn&#39;t lose much.\n\nNight Shift also discards his ri=\r\nffle without revolt. Yet he looks at Scorponok after hearing what Tucson Pr=\r\nime said and how he was viewing the situation.\n\n&quot; Okay, yeah, things went S=\r\nouth. Big deal, happens all the time.&quot;\n\nTucson then looks to Cyclonus, yes,=\r\n he had looked as he had before he had lost his sight. It didn&#39;t surprise h=\r\nim though. He had see and been through worse.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sorry Cyclonus, there =\r\nare no secrets to share with you. I have not the answers for the power that=\r\n has been given to me, because I myself don&#39;t know them.&quot;\n\nHe lastly turns =\r\nto Hydras. \n\n&quot; Rat Trap and Quickstride pose no threat to you Hydras. They =\r\nhave not entered your base, and done nothing to get you angry. So to that q=\r\nuestion, I have to say... LEAVE THEM OUT OF THIS. I am the one who made the=\r\n mistake, and it&#39;s me you want, not them. So, I&#39;m here aren&#39;t I? You have m=\r\ne and now you have nothing to fear from the outside world, because your mai=\r\nn threat is now in your possession. Think about it, what can they do? They&#39;=\r\nre no threat to you at all.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds in agreement to his command=\r\ner&#39;s statement. Tucson looks to all his comrades before having to be separa=\r\nted from them.\n\n&quot;Kup, I did not intend to put your spark in danger, and for=\r\n that I am deeply sorry. Stay strong my friend, this isn&#39;t forever. And wha=\r\ntever happens, happens. My heart goes out to Elita and one day, hopefully, =\r\nshe will never have to worry about anything ever again.&quot;\n\nHe puts a hand on=\r\n Night Shift&#39;s shoulder.\n\n&quot; Night Shift, we&#39;re going to be separated from e=\r\nach other. Again, this wouldn&#39;t be happening if I hadn&#39;t ran that red light=\r\n. I promise you I will make it up to you but not sure as of how I will do i=\r\nt just yet.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;Heey, it&#39;s cool, it&#39;s cool, we all mess =\r\nup sometimes, like ya said. No worries boss bot, we&#39;ll get through this, li=\r\nke we always do. I&#39;ll be okay, I promise.&quot; \n\nThey shake hands as they wait =\r\nto be separated from each other.\n\nOutside the fortress, Rat Trap senses som=\r\nething is a miss when it takes far too long for anyone to come out. Quickst=\r\nride looks down to him.\n\n&quot; Quickstride, it&#39;s been a really long time and no=\r\n word from Wheels or the others. Somethn&#39;s wrong.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds.\n\n&quot;Ye=\r\nah, something really stinks around here doesn&#39;t it, and it&#39;s not me this ti=\r\nme, because I haven&#39;t had any bean pods lately.&quot;\n\nRat Trap swallows hard.\n\n=\r\n&quot; He told us ta wait out here. But he also told us that if he didn&#39;t come o=\r\nut right away, ta call for backup. Lord Elder, it&#39;s me, Rat Trap. Wheels ha=\r\nsn&#39;t come out with the other guys yet, and it&#39;s been a very long time. Some=\r\nthing&#39;s wrong. I think we need backup sir.&quot;\n\nHis voice falters a bit, as he=\r\n wipes off a tear with his rodent paw.\n\n&quot;Aww Wheels, why&#39;dya have ta go&#39;n d=\r\no that for? You&#39;re the only real friend I&#39;ll ever have.&quot;\n\nQuickstride could=\r\n see what was happening. He puts his nose down to his rodent comrade.\n\n&quot; He=\r\ny, he&#39;ll be okay, he probably ran inta a snag. He&#39;ll be fine, he&#39;s pretty b=\r\nuff now Rat Trap. Don&#39;t worry, I bet he&#39;s got somethn&#39; up his manifold. It&#39;=\r\ns just gonna take a while, that&#39;s all.&quot;\n\nRat Trap composes himself and scra=\r\nmbles up onto Quickstride&#39;s back.\n\n&quot;We better find someplace ta hide.&quot;\n\nQui=\r\nckstride looks around and finds a bit of thick greenery near the black fort=\r\nress. He trots toward it, vanishing into the vegitation.\n\n&quot;This should be o=\r\nkay for now. Well, until Hydras sends his goons out ta find us which is pro=\r\nbably what&#39;ll happen.... Ooohh, bean pods...&quot;\n\nAgain he thinks of nothing b=\r\nut food and begins to munch on the bean pods. Rat Trap looks onto the fortr=\r\ness hoping that Tucson Prime had a plan in place to get everyone out of the=\r\nre in one piece.\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nKup/Perceprtor/Darkhawk/Nightlight/hydras\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup looked with sandess At R=\r\nodimus and nightlight, he had failed... miserly \n&gt; failed to his friend and=\r\n Elita.

He looked at Nightshift, &quot;Is this what=\r\n you\n&gt; &gt; meant by get it?&quot; he said, the sarcasm thick in his voice. &quot;I thin=\r\nk we\n&gt; &gt; got it then, yes we did.&quot; he chuckled at his own joke.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As =\r\nall this was going on the doors slid open and Cyclonus stood there,\n&gt; &gt; wea=\r\npon drawns and optics darting around the room. The cyclonus that\n&gt; &gt; stood =\r\nthere, while familiar to most, was very different from the last\n&gt; &gt; time Tu=\r\nscon had seen him before he lost his sight. This Cyclonus was a\n&gt; &gt; little =\r\ntaller and sleeker, even in his robot mode his lined and form\n&gt; &gt; bespoke s=\r\npeed and aerodynamics. He seemd larger and more imposing than\n&gt; &gt; when he l=\r\nast stood before him, his armor thicker and more resilliant\n&gt; &gt; than when h=\r\ne was a simple lacky for Galvatron. It is as if he had\n&gt; &gt; grown into somet=\r\nhing more than what he was, even his spark no longer\n&gt; &gt; registered as pure=\r\n Decepticon, there was that aspect that was always\n&gt; &gt; Unicronian, however =\r\non his chest was emblazed the purple symbol of the\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon forces.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Upon seeing the turn of events Cyclonus nodded satisfactorilly as he=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; turned to Hydras, &quot;What ever wave that was from Tuscon awakened\n&gt; &gt; Jh=\r\niaxus from stassis. He has the security section secured.&quot; He turned\n&gt; &gt; his=\r\n gaze on Tuscon, &quot;We will have to have it analyzed to see what ever\n&gt; &gt; def=\r\nence to it can be mounted.

Hydras is already aware of this,\n&gt; &gt; as are the rest=\r\n of the preds.

As Rodimus taunts him, he \nsimply ignores him, not utteri=\r\nng one word about it for a moment or so, and he \nalso had Hydras breathing =\r\ndown his neck configuratively. Still he keeps calm \nthroughout, and first d=\r\nirects his attention to Rodimus.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Failure? Hmm, \nRodimus I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw. To you it may seem like failure, to me, yes, it was a \nmistake but also =\r\na learning experience. Learn not to go too fast, yet make \ndecisions carefu=\r\nlly. So, yes, I configuratively got a flat tire along the way. \nBut tires c=\r\nan be changed and after that, it&#39;s back on the road like nothing \nhappened.=\r\n Of course to you, it&#39;s like a perpetual road block. There, you have my \nan=\r\nswer. Nothing more.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He quietly follows orders by discarding his \nwe=\r\naponry. Having left his cross bow behind, he merely gives up an old sword a=\r\nnd \nspear, as his weapons. He somehow felt that if he came with the bare mi=\r\nnimal he \nwouldn&#39;t lose much.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Night Shift also discards his riffle w=\r\nithout revolt. \nYet he looks at Scorponok after hearing what Tucson Prime s=\r\naid and how he was \nviewing the situation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; Okay, yeah, things went=\r\n South. Big deal, happens \nall the time.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tucson then looks to Cyclo=\r\nnus, yes, he had looked as he \nhad before he had lost his sight. It didn&#39;t =\r\nsurprise him though. He had see and \nbeen through worse.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; I&#39;m sorry=\r\n Cyclonus, there are no secrets to share \nwith you. I have not the answers =\r\nfor the power that has been given to me, \nbecause I myself don&#39;t know them.=\r\n&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He lastly turns to Hydras. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; \nRat Trap and Quickstride pos=\r\ne no threat to you Hydras. They have not entered \nyour base, and done nothi=\r\nng to get you angry. So to that question, I have to \nsay... LEAVE THEM OUT =\r\nOF THIS. I am the one who made the mistake, and it&#39;s me \nyou want, not them=\r\n. So, I&#39;m here aren&#39;t I? You have me and now you have nothing \nto fear from=\r\n the outside world, because your main threat is now in your \npossession. Th=\r\nink about it, what can they do? They&#39;re no threat to you at \nall.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;N=\r\night Shift nodds in agreement to his commander&#39;s statement. Tucson \nlooks t=\r\no all his comrades before having to be separated from them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Kup, \nI=\r\n did not intend to put your spark in danger, and for that I am deeply sorry=\r\n. \nStay strong my friend, this isn&#39;t forever. And whatever happens, happens=\r\n. My \nheart goes out to Elita and one day, hopefully, she will never have t=\r\no worry \nabout anything ever again.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He puts a hand on Night Shift&#39;s=\r\n \nshoulder.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; Night Shift, we&#39;re going to be separated from each oth=\r\ner. \nAgain, this wouldn&#39;t be happening if I hadn&#39;t ran that red light. I pr=\r\nomise you \nI will make it up to you but not sure as of how I will do it jus=\r\nt \nyet.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Night Shift nodds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Heey, it&#39;s cool, it&#39;s cool, we a=\r\nll mess \nup sometimes, like ya said. No worries boss bot, we&#39;ll get through=\r\n this, like we \nalways do. I&#39;ll be okay, I promise.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They shake han=\r\nds as they wait to be \nseparated from each other.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Outside the fortre=\r\nss, Rat Trap senses \nsomething is a miss when it takes far too long for any=\r\none to come out. \nQuickstride looks down to him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; Quickstride, it&#39;s=\r\n been a really long \ntime and no word from Wheels or the others. Somethn&#39;s =\r\nwrong.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quickstride \nnodds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Yeah, something really stinks ar=\r\nound here doesn&#39;t it, and it&#39;s \nnot me this time, because I haven&#39;t had any=\r\n bean pods lately.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rat Trap \nswallows hard.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; He told us ta =\r\nwait out here. But he also told us that if \nhe didn&#39;t come out right away, =\r\nta call for backup. Lord Elder, it&#39;s me, Rat \nTrap. Wheels hasn&#39;t come out =\r\nwith the other guys yet, and it&#39;s been a very long \ntime. Something&#39;s wrong=\r\n. I think we need backup sir.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;His voice falters a \nbit, as he wipes=\r\n off a tear with his rodent paw.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Aww Wheels, why&#39;dya \nhave ta go&#39;n =\r\ndo that for? You&#39;re the only real friend I&#39;ll ever \nhave.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quickstri=\r\nde could see what was happening. He puts his nose down to \nhis rodent comra=\r\nde.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; Hey, he&#39;ll be okay, he probably ran inta a snag. \nHe&#39;ll be fin=\r\ne, he&#39;s pretty buff now Rat Trap. Don&#39;t worry, I bet he&#39;s got \nsomethn&#39; up =\r\nhis manifold. It&#39;s just gonna take a while, that&#39;s all.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rat \nTrap c=\r\nomposes himself and scrambles up onto Quickstride&#39;&lt;WBR&gt;s back.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;We \n=\r\nbetter find someplace ta hide.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quickstride looks around and finds a=\r\n bit \nof thick greenery near the black fortress. He trots toward it, vanish=\r\ning into \nthe vegitation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;This should be okay for now. Well, until =\r\nHydras sends \nhis goons out ta find us which is probably what&#39;ll happen....=\r\n Ooohh, bean \npods...&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Again he thinks of nothing but food and begin=\r\ns to munch on the \nbean pods. Rat Trap looks onto the fortress hoping that =\r\nTucson Prime had a plan \nin place to get everyone out of there in one piece=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups=\r\n.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, \n&lt;airly2002@.&lt;WBR&gt;..&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nKup/Perc=\r\neprtor/&lt;WBR&gt;Darkhawk/&lt;WBR&gt;Nightlight/&lt;WBR&gt;hydras&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kup \nlook=\r\ned with sandess At Rodimus and nightlight, he had failed... miserly &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; \nfailed to his friend and Elita.
