A ting if guilt in her spark.\n&gt; She faught her beast modes to attach him again, wanting to rip him \napart. \n&gt; But this time she resisted, using as much will power as she could \nhandle.\n&gt; \n&gt; As she heard Prowl ask a question she understood she began to shift \nher \n&gt; weight uneasily, her systems far to ferel to communicate to him, \nbut \n&gt; systematic and logical enough to know what he was talking about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course she wasn&#39;t all right! And she wanted to scream that at \nhim, but \n&gt; she didn&#39;t know how to form the sounds into the peoper words.\n&gt; Her systems were overloading from too much power, her adrnalin was \nthrough \n&gt; the roof, she was trapped in this mode and didn&#39;t know how to get \nout.\n&gt; She wanted...no...NEEDED help, but she didn&#39;t know how to ask for \nit.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the mode shifted she began to look towards Prowl nervously, \nalmost like a \n&gt; dog that knew it did something bad and was now facing its owner.\n&gt; But she began to slightly mew as well, pathetic little sounds that \n&gt; communicated her uneasyness.\n&gt; \n&gt; She wanted help, and this was the best way she knew how to ask for \nit.\n&gt; But at any moment she could become vilent again, and she wanted \nhelp to keep \n&gt; those mood swings under control. But also to keep her beast modes \nunder \n&gt; controle as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The mode soon began to pace the room, almost seeming to want a way \nout like \n&gt; she wanted a way out of this terror which was true.\n&gt; But the pacing was also doing something else as well, it was \nkeeping her \n&gt; beast modes under control...for now.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
