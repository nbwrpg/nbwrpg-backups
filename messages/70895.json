I can&#39;t figure it out but something is making th=\r\ne mane on my neck stand on end..  Sorta like a horsefly ya can&#39;t shake off.=\r\n..&quot;\n\nTucson acknowledges Rodimus quickly.\n\n&quot; Thank you for the intel Rodimu=\r\ns.  Now I will be able to keep my sensors open for any wave disturbances.  =\r\nUsusally my sonar systems only pick up on solid objects, but there is a cha=\r\nnce that fluxuations in energy waves, can be detected via echolocation.  My=\r\n systems are up and running now..  But there&#39;s one flaw, that kind of detec=\r\ntion system is short range.  If there&#39;s any disturbances long range, I will=\r\n not be able to detect them.  I will do the best I can to keep alert.&quot;\n\nHe =\r\nrolls on with caution, trying not to kick up any dirt, or disturb anything =\r\naround him.  As tires roll over uneven ground his trailer rocks slightly as=\r\n he tries hard to avoid too much movement from it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From =\r\nhis observation post, Quickstride could sense the worry in Rodimus&#39;s\n&gt; voic=\r\ne. He too was worried and continues to keep his ears and eyes peeled in\n&gt; a=\r\nll directions. He paws his left front hoof.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Just what I was think=\r\nn&#39; Rodimus. I wonder if they got tipped off about\n&gt; our plan of action.. Sl=\r\nippery stuff when there&#39;s a mole involved that we\n&gt; don&#39;t know about..&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; From where Night Shift was, he could not see the seekers, yet, just by=\r\n his\n&gt; radar systems, he could definitely tell that there was a flying brig=\r\nade\n&gt; around the fortress. He slowly comes to a stop.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Be c=\r\nareful out there.&quot; Rodimus said as something came to mind with the talk\n&gt; a=\r\nbout a mole, &quot;I remember that one of the new guys could turn invisible.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\nRodimus paused trying to remember who it was, but finally continued, &quot;I am\n=\r\n&gt; not sure which one, they had just arrived. One of them could easily be\n&gt; =\r\nwatching us and we would never know it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Keep in mind, unless you=\r\n are at or near the Pred base scanning it would\n&gt; be difficult. The same ca=\r\nn be said for the Maximal base. If you&#39;re at the\n&gt; pred base, scanning the =\r\nMax base would be next to impossible without some\n&gt; sort of satellite or sp=\r\necialized gear.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I got an idea. It&#39;s a long shot, no p=\r\nun intended but it might work. I am\n&gt; equipped with long range equipment. W=\r\nhat if Kup used me as a cross bow, to\n&gt; take out some of those seekers, cre=\r\nate a diversion so that way Windlord and\n&gt; Rat Trap could make it inside?&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift spins a tire.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I dunno, sounds risky... What if=\r\n they barrel after us? I ain&#39;t a\n&gt; speedster.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks =\r\nat him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; It&#39;s worth a shot. Let&#39;s run it by Tucson.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucso=\r\nn now recieves a message from Straight Shot. He ponders the daring\n&gt; move.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hmm, that would work as a diversion but it&#39;s extremely risky... Bu=\r\nt\n&gt; nothing we&#39;ve never dealth with before.. All right, perhaps it is neces=\r\nary\n&gt; to make a move. Straight Shot, Kup, I want you to position yourselves=\r\n as\n&gt; best you can. Kup, take robot mode, Straight Shot, cross bow mode, an=\r\nd\n&gt; program your trajectory settings to long range. Be sure to conceal\n&gt; yo=\r\nurselves amply. Night Shift, I&#39;ll need you to remain in vehicle mode, for\n&gt;=\r\n a quick getaway. Rodimus, Quickstride, it has now come to my attention tha=\r\nt\n&gt; unless a diversion is executed, Rat Trap and Windlord may not make it i=\r\nnto\n&gt; the fortress safely. Straight Shot is going to provide the diversion =\r\nalong\n&gt; with Kup&#39;s help. Be prepared, once this diversion is in place, we m=\r\nay need\n&gt; you two to get into battle mode to fend off any seeker that tries=\r\n to attempt\n&gt; an attack on the Ark. I know these changes are sudden, but un=\r\nfortunately,\n&gt; there is a lot of uncertainty in this mission. All right, ba=\r\nttle stations\n&gt; everyone, things are about to get rocky.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Out ahead of the group the sweeps continue to fly through the air, seemi=\r\nngly\n&gt; unaware of the Maximals and Autobots that are preparing for their at=\r\ntack.\n&gt; They swoop around, obviously in some sort of patrol pattern, flying=\r\n first\n&gt; over one section and then over another. Their movements are surpri=\r\nsingly\n&gt; well orchestrated, they are either seasoned hunters or they have b=\r\neen\n&gt; trained by one who is. The air beneath their flight path rippled with=\r\n heat,\n&gt; the magma beneath them was incredibly hot.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I gotcha.&quot; Rodimu=\r\ns said over the radio comlink to Tuscon. &quot;We are ready\n&gt; here back at the b=\r\nase should anyone of the Predacons get foolish and attack\n&gt; us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodim=\r\nus paused and then continued, &quot;Also, I think I remember that one of the\n&gt; n=\r\new guys that came with Cyclonus when he returned could turn invisible, and\n=\r\n&gt; I think even teleport. I can&#39;t remember which one, but be very careful ou=\r\nt\n&gt; there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
