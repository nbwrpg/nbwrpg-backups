She sat on the bed and tried \nto awake Malice.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Malice slowly stirred, his systems slowy coming back online.  His \noptics slowly lit, returning to the red they were usually.  His \nsight wasn&#39;t one hundred percent though, things were still blurry.  \nHe set up, took a deep breath, let it out, then turned to Hellplague.\n&gt; &quot;I know you... don&#39;t I?&quot; he asked.\n&gt; Hellplague scooted close to Malice and put her arms around his \nshoulders.  She embraced him, then let go to get an energon cube.  \nSHe handed him th cube before speaking:\n&gt; &quot;Feed and be well, our pet.  Welcome home, Hunter Killer, the \nnewest of the Minions.&quot;\n&gt; For a moment, Malice simply stared at her, then grinned, the \nchuckled, then drank of the energon cube. \n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blacknightmare:\n&gt; \n&gt; The feme didn&#39;t say anything and she remain togehter Malice\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;ll there in a half hour, cause Splattercannon will have to \n&gt; take it easy with all the energon he&#39;s carrying.
