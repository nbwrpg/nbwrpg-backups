HE stands silently and looks outside a nearby window\n&gt; &gt; and sighs thinking of Cybertron and what was happening on the\n&gt; planet.\n&gt; &gt; He goes into a daze as he remembers the events that transpired a\n&gt; &gt; short time before his arrival... He was running... running from a\n&gt; &gt; menace unlike anything the cybertronians had faced, they were small\n&gt; &gt; robotic arachnids that were given the name replicators by their\n&gt; &gt; original creators who the Infecticons had destroyed. They\n&gt; transported\n&gt; &gt; the things to Cybertron during a great battle between the Maximal\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; Predacon fleets. There they used the very metal the planet was made\n&gt; &gt; of to Replicate. Before anyone could notice there was over a\n&gt; billion\n&gt; &gt; lurking in the depths of Cybertron. Zero recalls the sky of\n&gt; cybertron\n&gt; &gt; when the Infecticons broke through the combined Maximal and\n&gt; Predacon\n&gt; &gt; fleet... they were red with fire, all over ships of energy and\n&gt; metal\n&gt; &gt; we slamming into buildings, and if that wasnt enough the\n&gt; Replicators\n&gt; &gt; made their presence known on the southern half of the planet and\n&gt; &gt; quickly overtook it. Zero himself was on the planets equator. Above\n&gt; &gt; him an Infecticon Marauder with several Deathgliders and Abyss&#39;\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; chasing down a squadron of Maximal Blurr fighters. Before he knew\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; he was surrounded by Infecticon Infantry each firing plasma blasts\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; him and his Partner. Both bots began a mad dash for a bunker that\n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; been established in the city as a last defense against the\n&gt; &gt; replicators and ground troops. However before they could get there\n&gt; &gt; they were blocked off by Replicators. They both ducked into another\n&gt; &gt; alley but were faced with dead end. Zero watched helpessly as his\n&gt; &gt; friend panicked beside him and ran out of the alley only to be cut\n&gt; &gt; down by an uncountable number of blasts, the only part of him left\n&gt; &gt; was a hand. Zero Turned and activated his boosters which were\n&gt; blasted\n&gt; &gt; a sometime before hand and were severely damaged. He slowly rose\n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; the air when a bright flash erupted from beneath him. A portal.\n&gt; &gt; Before he knew what was happenening he was blasted from behind and\n&gt; &gt; sent barreling down into the portal. That was where his day dream\n&gt; &gt; ended.. and upon its conclusion Zero fell to his knees and clnched\n&gt; &gt; his fists in anger as he placed his ehad against the wall trying to\n&gt; &gt; supress the memory...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arrow: I killed them.
