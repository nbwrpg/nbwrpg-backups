She got up muttering under \n&gt; her breath. She nodded to Galvatron and started scurrying over \n&gt; towards the maximal signal.  She stayed close to the ground and \nstuck \n&gt; to the rocks.  Finally, she made her way on a ledge, just a few \n&gt; meters away from the scene.  She saw a maximal with one gun and \n&gt; holding back two preds. Or what ever they were. She hadn&#39;d seend \nbots \n&gt; like that before and wondered what they were. She transformed into \n&gt; bot mode, then drew her pistol with the stun charges and took \n&gt; aime. &quot;Don&#39;t move&quot; she whispered.  Then pulled the trigger.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  God Neptune didnt appreciate the sarcasim. As the stopped about \n20 \n&gt; feet from \n&gt; &gt; the signal he lowered himself 5 feet from the ground and dropped \n&gt; her on her \n&gt; &gt; but. He landed and turned to Galvatron. &quot; I have a net we can \nuse. \n&gt; We just \n&gt; &gt; have to get her still in one place. I sense many bot signatures \non \n&gt; the other \n&gt; &gt; side of her. That may give us time.&quot; Galvatron thought about \n&gt; this. &quot;That is \n&gt; &gt; not enough insurance. Dark Mouse could you put her down or at \nleast \n&gt; slow her \n&gt; &gt; down enough for us to grab her?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
