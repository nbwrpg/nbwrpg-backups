Alright thn, lets start with trying to restart it \nwithout it&#39;s log in command.&quot;  starts trying commands on the \nkeyboard to the side.\nBlackNightmare: the femme remained in silence watching at computer\nMalice:  &quot;hmmmm, I can access the core programming, let&#39;s see if I \ncan access ship&#39;s logs or something...&quot;  continues typing and \nwatching the screens.\n BlackNightmare: &quot;It&#39;s weird....&quot;wispered the femme&quot;I have the \nfeeling that you will know how acces this computer better than my \nsis&quot;\nMalice:  The male stops for a moment, making the same \nrealization.  &quot;Hmmm, but how can that be?  I know only you, \nHellplague and the others.  The first time I came down to this \nplanet was to attack the cannon.  You know that.&quot;\nBlacknightmare: the femme fell in silence, she didn&#39;t know what to \nanswer\nMalice:  &quot;Oh well.  I can&#39;t get any detailed logs or the AI, but I \nthink I can access the navagational sensor logs.&quot;  He started \npulling up sensor records, trying to see where this ship was \nprevious to to coming here.\nBlackNightmare: the femme didn&#39;t comment anything and thought if \nwouldn&#39;t be better told him all true, right now or wait to \nHellplague said the right moment.\nMalice:  &quot;A bunch of places I&#39;ve never heard of.  The engines have \nmore pasects on them than any other ship I bet.  Man, this guy was \ninto running ships into the ground, literally.&quot;\nBlackNightmare: &quot;Yea it seems that whoever used this ship had \ntravaled a lot&quot; said the femme but she deeply had the feeling that \nMalice was the owner of the ship\nMalice:  Pauses for a moment, looks at the chair he is sitting in, \nscooting around in it a little.  He then looks up to \nBlacknightmare.  &quot;This is a very comfortable chair.  I like this \nchair.&quot;\nBlackNightmare: &quot;Then as owner isn&#39;t here and seemed that he left \nthe ship... we cant ake this ship and take all that we need for our \nbase&quot;\nMalice:  The male grins then stands up.  &quot;Let it be known, that \nthois is my chair.&quot;  He then sits back down, pulling Blacknightmare \nin his lap and covering up in the blanket.\nBlackNightmare: the femme smiled and huged him saying &quot;Ok... I don&#39;t \ndicuss that &quot;\nMalice:  He laughs a litle, and continues checking the logs, \noccasionally pointing something interesting out.\nBlackNightmare: the femme looked at Malice and said &quot;It&#39;s \nsomething... Interesting there?&quot;\nMalice:  &quot;Just some very interesting places this ship has been.  \nNegative suns, trinary star systems, nebulae, the edge of the galaxy \nand beyond.  I wish I saw half th things this ship has.\nBlackNightmare: The femme didn&#39;t said anything and looking to Malice \nshe asked herself if could be possible to give back his memories \nagain\nMalice:  Looks up to the femme.  &quot;What&#39;s the mater?  I&#39;m not being \ntoo boring, am I?&quot;\nBlackNightmare: &quot;Oh noo.... I just... I just... &quot;The femme started \nto cry\nMalice:  The male was caught off guard by this.  &quot;Hon, what&#39;s the \nmatter?  Why are you crying?  I hate it when you cry.&quot;\nBlackNightmare:  the femme gave Malice a quick kiss and suddenly she \nstood up and and left the room.\nMalice:  He watches her leave.  &quot;Suddenly checking the computer \ndoesn&#39;t seem that interesting.&quot;  He gets up and follows after her.\nBlackNightmare:  The femme run quickly under the cold rain without \ncare the direction, she just like be far of all living beings of \nthat planet \nMalice:  Tears off the hatch and runs off after the \nfemme.  &quot;Blacknightmare!  Come back!&quot;\nBlacknightmare: The femme slow her steps  until she finally stopped. \nShe tembled, cold? a broken heart? fear? she didn&#39;t know\nMalice:  He catches up with her, a little out of breath because he \nis slower than her.  &quot;What... what&#39;s wrong?  You scare me when you \ndo stuff like that!&quot;\nBlackNightmare: &quot;I just can&#39;t hide it any longer.... I can&#39;t stand \nwatch you feel pain &#39;cause you don&#39;t know your past...but I don&#39;t  \nlike lost you... My heart it&#39;s broke in two due that&quot;\nThe hunter drops his to his knees, and looks up to her.  &quot;You and I \nwill never part.  I swear it, no matter what.&quot;\nBlacknightmare: the femme huged him crying.\n Malice:  &quot;If it hurts you, I don&#39;t want to know about it, but if \nneed be, tell me, back in the ship.  Come on.&quot;\nBlacknightmare:The femme nodded and while she was waitting for \nMalice, she was temblin due cold  \n\n\n\n\n"}}
