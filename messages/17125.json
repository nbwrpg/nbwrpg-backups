Battera, working for the \nAlliance? And Cybershark too! This must have been what Convix said \nabout a new mission. But he couldn&#39;t take it. He needed to go to \nCybertron. He would try once more to reach Battera, and if their was \nno reaction, he would leave her to do what she wanted with her life.\n\n&quot;Battera, listent to yourself! They&#39;ve done something to you! You are \nnot an Alliance soldier! You are an emissairy of peace, an ex-\nPredacon and my friend! Please remember Battera! You shouldn&#39;t be \nlike this.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s when he noticed the chip on her arm. He reached for it, but it \nshocked him with high voltage. It had frazzled some of his wires. He \nlooked at her.\n\n&quot;What...what have they done to you?&quot;\n\nVulois fell to the ground at her feet, in stasis lock because of the \ndamage the pulse sent to his head.\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron stared at the probe intensly.\n\n&quot;So how do we get it back to base?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq counted the numbers.\n\n&quot;Alright! We out number The Trainers now. Come on, what are we \nwaiting for! It&#39;s time for battle!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream arrived at the ruins of the Predacon cave, watching the \nLavacons come after him.\n\n&quot;Alright Phobia, where are you?&quot;\n\nHe still didn&#39;t completly trust Phobia. He did a little more than \nbefore, but he still couldn&#39;t rule out the possibility of a double-\nagent. He had to be on his toes as this plan began.\n______________________________________________________________________\nPrebon\n\nPrebon saw the look of worry on Spears&#39; face.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry. If he ever did anything to you, he would be a hunted \nbot for the rest of his life. Even if it would spawn millions of \nyears, I would hunt hin down for what he did. Just stay close and \nnothing will happen.&quot;\n\nHe contined walking.\n\n(Plese excuse this, but I have a question. I didn&#39;t watch G1 very \nmuch, and so if this is a really dumb question please don&#39;t laugh. \nBut, the way I know it, The Ark crashed, and than a few million years \nlater were awaken. But than wouldn&#39;t they have greatly out-dated \ntechnology? In the movie when they were with other bots from \nCybertron they looked no different. I would expect at least some \nsubtle changes. What&#39;s with that?)\n\n\n"}}
