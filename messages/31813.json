He\ntook to the air, the five images mimicking him exactly, and he shot two\nballs of energy at Hotspot.\n\nSinnertwin absorbed the dammage from First Aid, and continued his decent,\nuntil the last moment when an unknown figuere tackled him out of the way.\nSinnertwin fell on his back, and then leapt away to regroup with his\ncomerades, transforming into Abominus&#39;s leg. The lone robot stood up, and\ngave a hand to First Aid to help him up. &quot;Are you gonna be okay?&quot; The robot\nasked kindly. He wore the markings of the Autobots. The missiles continued\nand hit the Leg Sinnertwin had formed, but did little dammage due to the\nprotection of his heavy armor.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
