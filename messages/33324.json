He gave the order to seperate and Element split \ninto the five seperate bots.\n\n&quot;Ok, guys,&quot; Mantle said, &quot;Focus shots on the gestalts. I have to talk to \nProwl.&quot; With that he hovered off and over to Prowl.\n\n&quot;Hello, Prowl,&quot; he said as he approached, &quot;we were talking about a city \nbefore the battle started, but we never got to finish that.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
