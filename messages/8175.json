After the argument about his eyes he didn&#39;t \nknow if she&#39;d show. Unless she came out with guns blazing trying to \ncripple him so Stegotron could work his voodoo (That he do so \nwell.)  &quot;Well time to get started&quot;\n\n&quot;Lunarpine to whoever, I&#39;m going scouting to the north. I&#39;ll be back \nlater.&quot;\n\nHe knew that whoever was working the scanners would report his \ndeparture in the log book. If she was smart, he knew she was, she&#39;d \ncheck the scanners and logbook to see where he was going, and try to \nhead him off.\n\n&quot;Give Shadow Wing a message for me, tell her she&#39;s IT.&quot; He figured \nshe&#39;d know what IT meant\n\n\n\n"}}
