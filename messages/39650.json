In the RPG rules charter it \nblatantly states that there will be no offensive drones(group \nCharachters) except for those used for Construction and repairs. the \nTwo drones used in Kyles post violate that rule, thus another reason \nwhy I believe we should have a temp council for the RPG. One that \nwould exist until one(Im not sure if Megan is alive. heh)or two come \nback. Of course once one member is back they&#39;ll have all say so it \nwould be up to them if the temp council stayed and helped until all \nfour members have returned. But thats just my two cents.\n\n\n"}}
