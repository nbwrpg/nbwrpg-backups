Then he realizes that \nthis is a perfect opportunity. New Pred, not much loyalty. This might \nbe a good chance to recruit. Or it could just reveal his hiding \nplace. But he has to take that chance or his eveolved group won&#39;t \nhave a chance. Besides, his new body can probably take Battera. He \nyells down.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m the one who can give you new purpose in life. How about joining \nme?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
