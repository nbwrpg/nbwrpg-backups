They can&#39;t really be shut down so \nwear this. That way no more damage comes to you.&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n::Magmatron::\n\n    He saw CyberShark and a new bot walk up to the base. He was still \nmonitering CyberShark&#39;s mind.  The thought transmitter had been disabled, he \ncould only catch a glimse of what CyberShark was thinking. Magmatron was not \nhappy, CyberShark was remembering an old life. He was starting to fall in \nlove with the new bot. This was not good for Magmatron&#39;s plans. He&#39;d have to \nmake room around this news in oreder to complete his goal.\n\n"}}
