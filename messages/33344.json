The gravity of the \nmoment is broken by Wildrider&#39;s insane cackle. &quot;Shut up&quot; Speedbreaker \nyells. Motormaster then drops Symphony, and dives towards the ground. \nHe shifts putting his feet first, then transforms into truck mode, \nlanding with a thunderous boom, and peels towards the CF, driving out \nof the crater he left. &quot;Saddly for the Maximals, I&#39;m in a bad mode&quot; \nhe mumbles.\n\nWildrider positions himself under Symphony, and transforms as \nwell, &quot;Hhha ha ha, grab on punk&quot; he laughs out. Speedbreaker hits the \nground, hands first, transforming into his lotus, and follows his \nlarge and grumpy leader.\n\n\n"}}
