No one had ever cared how he felt before, well, other then his own mother and she was deceased now. Had been for almost a full year, but that was expected.   \r\nBut he just could NOT figure it out. He had come here explicitly to kill Von and take the right to their mother�s property, now however, realizing the Von had died long before he had ever expected, Vlad wasn�t so sure that it was what he wanted anymore. Knowing now that he was the last of his entire family was lonely, to put not to fine a point on it.  But why did he feel this? He should have been overjoyed that he was the soul keeper of the property now, didn�t have to wait in line while Von took it instead.  But the only way that Vlad could decide that he felt this way was that he would have felt that he had earned the right to those lands if he could have killed Von, proving that he was the smarter of the two. But not only that, but he had looked forward to see his older half brother, even though he was planning to kill him in the end. But even then he hadn�t planned to kill him himself he was going to hire somebot to do it for him and even then he was going to make sure that it was quick and painless. Vlad would have had no other choice but to have killed Von anyway, it was the only way. The way of a Predacon.\r\nIf a Predacon wanted something he killed to get it, instead of just taking when the person had the chance to take revenge and then only cause the Predacon troubles that could have been prevented.\r\nSo Vlad cleared his throat and took in a deep breath, blocking out the thoughts that he was alone as far as family went. But not as far as people, company.\r\nBut Vlad never let any of this drip from his solid expression, finally deciding that this was simply a set back and finding a way to get home to claim his rights before they were void. So, to replace what empty feeling might dwell in a spark which he meant to be solid and unyielding, he looked back at Fenox and smiled.**  � Yeah, I�m ok. Just had to check something.�\r\n** He lifted a brow.** � Hay. Would you mind if I stayed here for a bit. I�m afraid I don�t know this world very well.�\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
