He\n&gt; strains to get up, and through wheezing breath he salute Megatron.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wildrider, strugles to get up, and transforms, the side of the car\n&gt; that turns into his shoulder is damaged. &quot;Come with me if you want to\n&gt; live your destiny Shockwave&quot; he says, as he roars off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron receives the information from the Avian, but he was busy\n&gt; right now. He stepped over to Astroblasts controls, and turned on the\n&gt; speakers (this isnt a radio wave, it&#39;s a normal speaker, so it just\n&gt; intensifies the noise). &quot;SURGITAL&quot; it boomed over the battle field.\n&gt; &quot;GET OVER HERE, MEGATRON COMMANDS IT&quot;. He then looked down at the\n&gt; Stunticons. &quot;MERGE&quot; he ordered. \n&gt; \n&gt; Motormaster hearing this stepped forward. &quot;Stunticons, transform, and\n&gt; start your engines&quot; he ordered, as he Speedbreaker and Wildrider\n&gt; transformed into car mode, and began to rev their engines.\n\n\n"}}
