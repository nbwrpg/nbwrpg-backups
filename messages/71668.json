I&#39;ve watched all the G1 series\n&gt; episodes so I do know that.  The Seekers are far more sentient than the\n&gt; Sweeps and to me far more intelligent.\n\nOkay. You confused me when Noctorro told Tuscon that Seekers had\nattacked and Tuscon said,\n\n&gt; &quot;Seekers?  But how? They&#39;re out scouting the parameters, I saw them myself.\n&gt; Something is very wrong here.&quot;\n\nSince it was the sweeps who were actually out there I wasn&#39;t sure if\nyou knew the difference. But it&#39;s all clear now :)\n\n\n&gt; So one question does remain, is Dark Rodimus a living extension of Rodimus\n&gt; that somehow remained after he got rescued?  And is there a possibility that\n&gt; Tucson will have to face off with the real Rodimus to get him to realize that he has\n&gt; a serious demon to get rid of?  And could there be a demon to slay on Tucson&#39;s\n&gt; end too?  After all he isn&#39;t without his weaknesses too.  I guess what I&#39;m asking is,\n&gt; could this be a sort of test for both Rodimus and Tucson Prime, who seem to\n&gt; suffer from lack of self confidence and anger management?  And can they actually\n&gt; help each other overcome these weaknesses and win a victory in the name of their\n&gt; factions?  Just curious about the storyline in general.\n\nWell hmmm,\n\nI don&#39;t want to reveal things that Hydras and Tuscon don&#39;t know yet.\nBut I will say that I don&#39;t have demons running around as everything\nis sci-fi and technology based, but there is something is strange\nabout all of this. Yes there is a test coming for Tuscon as he\nembraces this new form of his. And yes there is a test for Rodimus\nhimself as well. And the results of this can indeed have a profound\nand permenant affect on his as well as his role amongst the Maximals.\n\nAnd don&#39;t forget there was an important question that Leo had asked\nRodimus right before he left. Tuscon didn&#39;t hear the question, but\nRodimus said he would answer it when he got back.\n\nThere are many things going on - and I am using this thread to make a\nfew adjustments as well - some of which will be seen shortly :)\n\nBuckle your seat belts and be prepared for a bumpy but hopefully a fun\nride! If you have questions, please feel free to ask. i won&#39;t be able\nto answer much about what your characters can&#39;t know yet, but I can\nhelp you to see what you should already be seeing . . . if that makes\nsense?\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
