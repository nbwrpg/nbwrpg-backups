He smiles to her, gently running a hand \n&gt; over her face, and gives her a kiss on the cheek, letting her know that no \n&gt; matter what happened, his love for her would never die.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There will be a lot more where that came from after I help Rodimus. I \n&gt; promise you, I will not leave you, that is my promise to you Talon.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gently rubs her hands and then turns to the door, and turns an ear over \n&gt; to the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m the only one who can enter the room.  Take heart, this \n&gt; is for the best, and I know it will help Rodimus immensely.  Something \n&gt; inside me is telling me so.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He enters the room and gets his bearings so is not to knock anything over \n&gt; or trip over anyone.  His sensors quickly leading him to Rodimus as he \n&gt; finds his way over to where he lies.  He then nods to Stanton and the \n&gt; others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;All right, tell me what I have to do and I will do it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns his head toward Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hang in there Rodimus, I&#39;m comming.  I promised to save you and I will \n&gt; save you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson raises a brow after hearing Silverbolt&#39;s encouraging words.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I can&#39;t hide anything can I? A good friend always knows what his \n&gt;&gt; &gt; comrade is thinking, and no matter how saddened one is, he can always \n&gt;&gt; &gt; feel good that he has friends standing beside him. It&#39;s very good to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; know I have you and the others for support. I should consider myself \n&gt;&gt; &gt; very lucky to be a part of a powerful merger of factions. Now, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39;s health is declining, and I have more than enough spark to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; share. I think it is time that you allow me to attempt a form of energy \n&gt;&gt; &gt; transfusion. It may be his only hope of recovery.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Silverbolt turned to face Tuscon a look of surprise crossing across\n&gt;&gt; his expressive features as he nodded at Tuscon, &quot;Those of valor must\n&gt;&gt; act as one.&quot; he said. &quot;I heard the cracking of your knuckes and I know\n&gt;&gt; why we are here, and I know whoes black energon pump is behind this.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; Silverbolt&#39;s optics darkened as he turned back to look at Rodimus\n&gt;&gt; through the glass as the alarm went off.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He establishes a com link to Stanton and Legacy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Stanton, Legacy, I am more than honored to have you working so \n&gt;&gt; &gt; diligantly on saving Rodimus Prime, and now it is my turn to give \n&gt;&gt; &gt; something back in exchange for the undaunting dedication you are \n&gt;&gt; &gt; showing our factions. My spark has more than enough power to transfuse \n&gt;&gt; &gt; energy from my body into his. Not to worry, I will not go off line. It \n&gt;&gt; &gt; may be our only hope of saving Rodimus Prime. It is not a request, it \n&gt;&gt; &gt; is my order.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Santon looked up at Tuscon through the window, his optics at first\n&gt;&gt; annoyed to have been pulled away from these delicate proceedures by\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon. Everyone knew well the folly of trying to order a medical\n&gt;&gt; officer in his own bay. But then Santon smiled slightly and nodded,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You&#39;re right. We need you . . . but only you. Step inside.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy and Bump continued to work on Rodimus, even as Rodimus&#39; life\n&gt;&gt; signs edged a little lower.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
