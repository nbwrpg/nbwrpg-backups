It totally snuck up on her, even though she had to \nadmit that it was pretty easy since she was dwelling on the fight and not \ntoo much on things going on around her.  By now the big bot had lifted Prowl \nhigh in the air and Iron Raptor suddenly realized that if it let go of him \nnow and with his broken wing, Prowl would fall to earth and would probably \nmake a sickening sound when he landed. She made a sick face at the thought.\n&lt; Great job, dumb ass.&gt; her mind teased.\nBut she suddenly hissed through her teeth when she saw the other hand whoosh \ndown towards her now, scrambling to try and get out of the way on all fours. \nBut she made a slight gaging sound when the hand caught her tail instead and \nshe was suddenly hauled up through the air up-side down!*\n\n� Hay!�\n\n* This was un-needed! And what did this bot think it was doing anyway?*\n\n� Put me down!�\n\n* She was rightfully pissed off now!*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
