It was about five degrees \nlower than the temperature needed to set the energon off into an explosion.  \nHe spit his energon up on his lap, though he ignored that, and looked at a \nmonitor.\n\nHe saw Koj and Inu shoot open storage chamber and continued to watch them \nleave the Cybertronian Fire.  He activated his comm. unit to Kluster and Iron \nRaptor.\n\n&quot;Kluster, Iron Raptor, this is Chordate.  Those two new Maximals, Koj and \nInu, have just stolen quite a bit of supplies from the Cybertronian Fire, and \nin the direction they&#39;re heading, I can only see one real important thing, \nthe Ark.  I&#39;m going to place them on enemy.&quot; he ended the transmission.\n\nHe finished putting them on enemy only a cycle later, when a thought popped \ninto his head.  Ever since that Predacon inflitrated the Cybertronian Fire, \nthe codes had never been changed.  The comm. frequencies and shield \nfrequencies had, but nothing else.\n\nHe began working on that, knowing it would only take a couple cycles to set \nup the programs to randomly change the codes that would then send all the new \ncodes to those with the authority.\n\n(Such as, people, I can&#39;t tell who gets which codes because I don&#39;t know all \nthe Maximals, but for something like emergency shut off of all systems in the \nCF, new recruits wouldn&#39;t have that.  That would be just Iron Raptor, \nKluster, and Chordate.  Please be logical like that when Chordate finishes \nthe codes and I have him send &#39;em out.  Thank you)\n\n"}}
