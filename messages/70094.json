A green cloud wafts upward.\n\nAs the gassy pod of smell began to ascend into the air, it was carried\nby the wind, slightly disipating as it moved higher and higher into\nthe air. However it eventually reached to the hieght of the three\nfliers, catching them full on as they moved through it.\n\n&quot;What is that vile odor?&quot; said one of them said, the voice quiet and\nlow, almost a whisper. The black jet veered off to one side as it made\nto circle around, its engines strangely quiet, even at the speeds they\nwere flying.\n\n&quot;No Nightrazor.&quot; came the command of the middle one, the one that\nlooked more like a weapons platform. &quot;We have a mission to perform,\nfall back in line.&quot;\n\n&quot;But Deepstryke, I believe it smells divine.&quot; said the red and white\njet, the voice definitely female, as it was voice dark and sultry. &quot;It\ncould be useful under some circumstances.&quot;\n\n&quot;Later Phobia.&quot; The middle one said, obviously their leader. &quot;Once\nwe&#39;ve caught up with Cyclonus.&quot;\n\n&quot;You spoil all the fun.&quot; Phobia said playfully as she continued her flight.\n\nBy this time the black jet, Nightrazor had fallen back into position\nand the three of them banked slightly, reorienting themselves on their\nintended goal: the Black Fortress, and picked up speed.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
