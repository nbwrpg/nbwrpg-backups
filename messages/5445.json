He looks around. It was open fields for miles around, \nalmost nothing other than grass growing there.\n\nStriker smiles. A siege on a ship in this terrain would be suicidal for the \nattackers. There were no obstacles to hide behind, nothing to use to their \nadvantage.\n\nHe looks forward, seeing the Maximal battle cruser ahead of him. Nearing it, \nhe transforms into robot mode, aproaching the ship.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster looks at the scanners as the beep, announcing a bot aproaching. He \nhesitates before checking its faction, but is relieved to find that it is \nMaximal. He smiles. Finally they have made contact with the bots that they \nwere sent to help. He stands up.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll go check it out,&quot; he says to the remainder of his crew and walks out of \nthe door.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker looks at the bot coming out of the opening hatch of the ship. \nGlancing down at his scanners, he is relieved to find that the bot is Maximal.\n\n&quot;I must say you chose a great spot to crash in,&quot; he says to the bot \naproaching him, &quot;Attacks on this place would be suicidal.&quot;\n\nKluster grins. &quot;Thanks. My name&#39;s Kluster. I&#39;m the commander on this ship.&quot; \nHe stretches out a hand.\n\nStriker nods. &quot;I&#39;m Striker. One of the Maximals here.&quot; He stretches out his \nown hand, the two Maximals shaking hands.\n\nThey both turn their heads at the sound of hooves, seeing Ramulus running up.\n\n&quot;Ramulus, this is Kluster,&quot; Striker says, &quot;Kluster, this is Ramulus.&quot;\n\nRamulus and Kluster nod. Kluster looks at the two Maximals in front of him.\n\n&quot;So, how&#39;s the war going?&quot;\n\nStriker sighs. &quot;Not too well, actually,&quot; he admits, &quot;A predacon attack has \nrecently nearly destroyed our base.&quot;\n\nThe smile disapears from Kluster&#39;s face. &quot;Any casualties?&quot;\n\nStriker nods. &quot;Two.&quot;\n\nKluster nods. &quot;Well, down to buisness.&quot; he says, &quot;The Maximal elders sent me \nhere to help you guys out. They gave me equipment, this ship, and a crew. The \nship can support up to 140 Maximals, and can fight back quite a few preds, \ntoo! If your base is crap, you can move in here.&quot;\n\nStriker blinks in surprise. &quot;M-m-m-m,&quot; he stampers out in surprise, &quot;Wow. \nThat&#39;s a lifesaver.&quot;\n\nKluster grins. &quot;I&#39;ll tell the rest of the crew we&#39;ll be having guests.&quot; His \nface darkens, &quot;What&#39;s left of them at least.&quot;\n\nStriker nods, &quot;I&#39;ll come with you. Ramulus, go get the others ready. We&#39;re \nmoving in.&quot;\n\nRamulus nods, rather reluctantly turning around and heading back toward the \nArk. He stops, blinking. He had forgotten all about Longhunter! Ramulus looks \naround, looking to see if she was anywhere around.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker follows Kluster into his ship, looking around at the impressive \ndefences. When they reach the bridge, Kluster looks at his crew. &quot;Everyone, \nthis is Striker, here&#39;s a Maximal on this planet,&quot; he says, &quot;The Maximals \nhave been having some tough times lately, and are in need of a base. The ship \ncan support up to 140 bots, so we&#39;ll be having company soon.&quot;\n\n"}}
