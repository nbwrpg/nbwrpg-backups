There was no login, no message board, no scripts to automate stuff, nothing like that. Then I made the current login script, which is much better than nothing, but, in my opinion, not good enough. Despite there being a message board, there are still pages of OOC discussion on the RPG board. The char editor doesn&#39;t work perfectly, and the whole thing lacks some features. Its ok, but it can be alot better.\n\nAfter thinking over just how much I can do with Perl, I have put together some specifications for a possible upgrade to the site. The main thing in this plan is to move all RPGing there. Other improvements include more automated site functions, more advanced message boards, etc...\n\nSome advantages I can see are:\n\n- You would no longer require an email account to RP. The thing will still accept posts by email (to post@... or something like that), but you can get by with just a site account.\n- The OOC board will conveniently be right next to the IC board.\n- Contacting each other will be easy. I can make a system that allows members to leave each other messages that the recieving person will see when they sign on. That can also go for contacting (and recieving replies from) the council.\n- The RPG board and everything can be optimized (not appearance-wise, but feature-wise, something that can&#39;t be done with eGroups).\n- The council will have a special system to keep order, update the site, etc...\n\nDisadvantages would be:\n\n- This will all run off of my server, meaning that it will go at the same speed as the site goes now (possibly slower due to higher traffic, etc).\n- It might experience some down-time, although I&#39;m recabling my house soon so that I don&#39;t have to unhook the server to do things, which will let me keep the server online much more often.\n- People who are part of lots of groups on eGroups won&#39;t be able to go from a different group to NBW as easilly. They&#39;ll actually have to go to a different site and log in (*gasp*).\n\nRegardless of whether you guys wanna move the actual RPGing to the NBW site, the site will still have to be remade. The current system requires too much updating from me and I really don&#39;t have time. The actual remake won&#39;t make the user interface much different, but it&#39;ll add features and make the thing much more automatic.\n\nSo tell me what you guys think. Please send me private email, as to avoid cluttering the board.\n\n\n"}}
