The room is\n&gt; dominated by a large cylinder in the middle o=\r\nf the room that is about\n&gt; fifteen feet in diameter and stretched from the =\r\nfloor all the way to a\n&gt; ceiling that was perhaps 30 feet in the air. Energ=\r\ny was flowing\n&gt; through the cylinder, a black sort of energy with yellow mo=\r\ntes of\n&gt; light floating about within it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Around the room itself there =\r\nare control panels and computer screens\n&gt; along nearly the entire space of =\r\nthe wall. And it was light from the\n&gt; cylinders plus light from the panels =\r\nthe provided the only\n&gt; illumination in the chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; However in the ti=\r\nme it took for everyone to examine the room everyone\n&gt; began to feel a smal=\r\nl stabbing pain in their processors.
