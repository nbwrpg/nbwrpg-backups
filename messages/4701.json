If\nyou\ncan, I would like to Set these machines up so that I can run a few\nthings if megatron wants me too. Also later I&#39;m going to need a few\nTable&#39;s set up so that if I have to reprogram any other bots I can do\nso. But, I have one question for you, Will you be my Partner? I could\nuse somebody to watch my back and from the work I seen you do, You\ncould use someone to watch yours.&quot; But of corse that wasn&#39;t the only\nreason why Scorponok wanted to be parterns, He wanted to be partners\nso he could be close to her\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
