To do so in less than \none post (since you never even posted his walking up and entering) is pretty \nbad moding.\n\n::Prowl/Striker/Ramulus::\n\nProwl looks at Falcore, slightly confused.

Where&#39;d you pick them up?&quot; Prowl asks, taking out his scanner.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker walks toward his quarters, picking up random important stuff to take \nto the new base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus blinks as Primal walks up to him, talks to him, and leaves. He nods, \ngalloping off after Primal to see where he was heading to.\n\n"}}
