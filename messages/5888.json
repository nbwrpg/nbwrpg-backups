She wondered what made her wake up so fast. She \nlooked around i the cavern. She was high up on the cavern wall, perched on \nher ledge.  The air was warm and moist from the spring.  She thought that \nmaybe she was just hot and needed to cool down.  She spread her wings and \nwas about to take to flight.  Then she caught a moving shadow. She sensed \nPredacon.  How did he find me, she thought.  She knew that he blocked the \nmain entrance to the cave.  She looked and saw  only a 30 foot clearance \nabove the bot standing in the shadows.  it would be tight, but she could fly \nvery fast.  She took a deep breath and flew off the ledge.  She flew over \nthe head of the bot without making a sound.  Her head was only an inch from \nthe cave ceiling.  She hoped that with her dark feathers, the bot would not \nnotice her flying overhead and trying to leave the cave.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
