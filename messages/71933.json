For I fear what we will see when all away.  There may be\n&gt; another power at play, here to come while we are out today.  I nkow that if\n&gt; we spread ourselves to thin, someone could come here and the war they couyld\n&gt; win.  There is more than we know going on, I do not like it, we do not\n&gt; belong.  I fear we may find something we do not know, and we shall not like\n&gt; to go.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, nodding up over and readyign to go out in the portion of the\n&gt; grid wher ehte trio had been dispatched to patrol.  Not so much a sense of\n&gt; fear in him..  But hesitation.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;You present a good point Wheelie.&quot; LEO said, looking at him with an\nappraising optic. &quot;You speak with a greater wisdom then you let on.&quot;\nThere was a small smile as LEO spoke. &quot;All of us will not be going,\nonly some of us, you are right the Ark will need to be protected.\n\nLEO PRIME looked over at TUSCON but continued to speak for the benefit\nof all. &quot;I do not know how many Tuscon plans to bring, but I would\n*suggest* leaving Legacy, Lord Elder as well as Bump. Santon can act\nas a field doctor with the group going out.&quot;\n\nThere was a slight shrug, &quot;I will warn you though, Santon, like many\nmedics, will not take a life or even have any desire to enter combat.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
