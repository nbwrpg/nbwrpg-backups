As they walk Tumult has \n&gt; been \n&gt;&gt; speaking into his radio, his voice much too low to be understood. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Before long they came out into a clearing, and before them stands a \n&gt;&gt; female minion looking at some device and a much larger mech that \n&gt; could \n&gt;&gt; only be Deepstryke. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The female is predominantly crimson red with ebony black at her \n&gt;&gt; shoulders and hips. She is obviously a jet in her alt mode, as her \n&gt;&gt; slender midriff bore the distinctive outline of a nosecone. Her face \n&gt;&gt; and forearms are alabaster white, with fin like protrusions of the \n&gt; same \n&gt;&gt; hue flowing off of her helm. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; She looked up at the duo as they entered, locking gazes with \n&gt;&gt; Nightstrike and Darkfate. Her demeanor was curious and yet strangely \n&gt;&gt; aggressive, her humorless smile she displayed only accentuated this. \n&gt;&gt; Her optics were deep and penetrating as she stared at them, her head \n&gt;&gt; tilting slightly. For a moment it was as if she saw not just them, \n&gt; but \n&gt;&gt; something more, something only she could see about them. But then \n&gt; the \n&gt;&gt; moment passed as her smile faded and she returned to looking at the \n&gt;&gt; device she had been studying before they came up. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The other figure that stood here was truly massive. He stood nearly \n&gt;&gt; head and shoulders taller then most mechs, with huge shoulders, and \n&gt;&gt; powerful limbs. He was colored primarily in gunmetal grey armor, \n&gt; with \n&gt;&gt; red at his large shoulders, and splashes of it at his faceplate. He \n&gt;&gt; looked something like a seeker on steroids! He had what appeared to \n&gt; be \n&gt;&gt; a nosecone at his chest, but his frame was far more thickly armored \n&gt;&gt; then any seeker. Cannons were mounted on his back, as well extending \n&gt;&gt; from his shoulders extending along each bicep, while on his chest \n&gt;&gt; appeared to be rocket or missile launchers. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He turned to look at the female next to him, his face dour and hard, \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Phobia, you have the information yet?&quot; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The red and black femme next to him snapped alert and looked \n&gt; over, &quot;Yes \n&gt;&gt; sir, I have something.&quot; She glanced back at her device and then \n&gt; back at \n&gt;&gt; Deepstryke, &quot;It has taken some time to make sense of the neural \n&gt; upload \n&gt;&gt; Nightrazor sent us of Hot Rod, but I do believe we have a location \n&gt; of \n&gt;&gt; what they&#39;re looking for.&quot; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Deepstryke nodded, &quot;Does it match the original location Cyclonus \n&gt; sent \n&gt;&gt; us?&quot; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Phobia nodded as Deepstryke&#39;s head snapped around to look at \n&gt;&gt; Nightstrike and darkfate, his look long and penatrating, &quot;What do \n&gt; you \n&gt;&gt; know of the original Ark the fell to earth, and of the Optimus Prime \n&gt;&gt; that held the matrix?&quot; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Preston \n&gt;&gt; (Da&#39;minion) \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; ____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _ \n&gt; ____________ __ \n&gt;&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and \n&gt;&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
