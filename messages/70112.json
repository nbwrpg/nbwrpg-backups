Of the three he was the\n&gt; most physically massive, and seemingly riddled with weaponry. Four\n&gt; cannons sat on his broad shoulders as well as a rather large rifle\n&gt; that he held easily in his hand. He was armor was thick and well\n&gt; articulated, hued in gray and red.\n&gt;\n&gt; The second one was colored almost completely in black, with only deep\n&gt; purples and blues to break the rhythm. He was obviously a jet of some\n&gt; type, looking almost like a remodeled seeker of some sort, he had\n&gt; patches of red on his wings that looked something like radar dishes.\n&gt; Also his build was also much slimmer, his movements were also more\n&gt; graceful and smooth, almost catlike as he walked and looked about.\n&gt;\n&gt; The last one was a female, the only one of the trio. She was\n&gt; predominantly red and white, although there were traces of black along\n&gt; her shoulders and hips and legs. From the cockpit that helped form her\n&gt; chest, she was most likely a jet of some type, although the lack of\n&gt; obvious wings made the specific type not easy to determine. As she\n&gt; walked into the room, her movements were crafty, observant, and in\n&gt; their own unique way seductive.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ahh Cyclonus.&quot; said the female, &quot;It has been so long since we have\n&gt; seen you.&quot; she said as she smiled at him as she looked him up and\n&gt; down. She turned to look at Nightlight, &quot;And who is this?&quot; she said as\n&gt; she crossed her arms over her chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus only smiled coldly as he turned slightly to Nightlight, &quot;Lady\n&gt; Nightlight&quot; he said gallantly, &quot;I would like you to meet Deepstryke.&quot;\n&gt; he said pointing the larges of the three, the one with all the\n&gt; weaponry. &quot;And there is Nightrazor.&quot; Cyclonus said as he gestured to\n&gt; the dark of the three. &quot;And the last here in all her glory is Phobia&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At that point Phobia smiled sweetly as she continued to look\n&gt; Nightlight up and down.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And where is this Hydras?&quot; Nightrazer said, his voice hardly a\n&gt; whisper as he talked.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus gestured for them to step further into the throne room, &quot;He\n&gt; will be here momentarily Cyclonus said, &quot;For the moment make your\n&gt; selves comfortable.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Even as Cyclonus spoke he keyed a message to Hydras that the allies\n&gt; had arrived in the throne room.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
