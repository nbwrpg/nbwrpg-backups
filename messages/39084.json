He storms up to Darkfate and looks into the bots eyes as his \nbody pulses brighter sending intense heat out that would make \nDarkfates circuits sizzle.\n\nBlight: &quot;Where the hell are your men!? If they aren&#39;t here in five \nminutes I will turn you into a crater! And when your men do arrive \nafter that I will have them blasted into oblivion!&quot;\n\nElsewhere at the Main Infecticon base, Frostbite sits and ponders of \nthe faction on the island a short distance from her own. She laughs \nevily as a plan formulates in her head before she opens a channel to \nboth Alliance bases.\n\nFrostbite: &quot;This is commander Frostbite of the Infecticons. I would \nlike to suggest an alliance between our two factions, my people can \noffer much in advanced technology to your own.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
