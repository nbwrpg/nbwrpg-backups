He didn&#39;t know why he acted like that, but he figured it was this \nnew body&#39;s willingness to fight. He&#39;d have to learn to control it.\n\n-I&#39;ll go back with you,- he thinks to her, firing two missiles at \nShadow and then jogging to catch up with Iron Raptor. He was now \nfeeling sorry, hoping that she wouldn&#39;t be mad at him.\n\n-Do you still need that lift, love?- he asks.

But something raw like that...she would doubt he would like it \n&gt; either.\n&gt; Maybe that was a lesson...no...it WAS one. They would have to learn to \n&gt; controle their thoughts, so that they weren&#39;t so loud and powerful.\n&gt; Prowls anger along had nearly brought her to her knees.\n&gt; &lt; I&#39;m glad he&#39;s not the enemy and on our side.&gt; was her thought as she \n&gt; regained her mind and looked up from the ground.\n&gt; She would also have to learn not to take those feelings the wrong way \n&gt; again...this was new...and she didn&#39;t know how to react properly.\n&gt; She even found herself wishing that she could just speak with er mouth \n&gt; instead of mer mind. It was much easier.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Iron Raptor just watched as Prowl stood tall in front of Shadow, looking \n&gt; at him and then the enemy. Not moving from where she stood, crossing her \n&gt; arms as the cloth on her mack fluttered in the wind.\n&gt; Looking out from her helm.\n&gt; She had only tried to help, but if Prowl wanted to go this alone then let \n&gt; him.\n&gt; Shadow had challenged HIM after all.\n&gt; &lt; I guess...being cooped up in that base made me eager to fight again.&gt;\n&gt; Still not knowing just how her body could have acted like it had, without \n&gt; her mind to guide it...or so it seemed.\n&gt; But then her eyes turned to Prowl.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; You can battle if you want.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She finally decided, moving back to that her shoulders were facing towards \n&gt; the direction of the CF.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; But I&#39;m going back.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that she turned her back to the battle, walking off towards their \n&gt; destination.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
