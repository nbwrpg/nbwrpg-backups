Let&#39;s =\r\ndo a subtle pass.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brody (whispering back): Right! I&#39;m swit=\r\nching to thermal scan.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The hot air fuming upwards effectiv=\r\nely broke under a cooler\ncushion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that didn&#39;t move. Chop rose in the=\r\n air, targeting the anomally and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; armed a magazine of tracking bulle=\r\nts. As he flew over it, he fired\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the whole magazine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; N=\r\nightrazor simply watched the duo from his vantage point. As\nthey rose\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n and searched he looked at them closely. He could tell that the\nship had\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; no clue as to his where abouts, but these two were a different\nmatter. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is only as they got closer he realized what they were doin=\r\ng. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; buffeting heat from the surface would be stalled or redirected=\r\n\nby his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presence. Here in this location he could be discovered by ind=\r\nirect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; means. Then his attention was caught by the click of a magazine=\r\n\nbeing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; loaded into position. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; With a burst of power he s=\r\nhot foward and up, putting as much\ndistance\n&gt; &gt; &gt; between him and the warmt=\r\nh comming from the surface below, even\nas the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; full clip of trackeing =\r\nbullets were unleashed by Chop. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Strafing shots ripped into hi=\r\ns aft armor causing pain to flood his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; systems and his cloaking field =\r\nflickered. For the briefest of\nmoments\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightrazor&#39;s aerodynamic ebony=\r\n form was revealed as he moved\naway . . .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and then was gone as he pas=\r\nsed out from beneath them. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For another moment ionized particl=\r\nes from his engines attracted the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attention of the bullets from Chop =\r\nas Nightrazor pushed his engiens\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temporarilly beyond what his cloakin=\r\ng shields could handle. But the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bullets were quickly left behind as t=\r\nhe ship rose further into\nthe air\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the cloaking field restablished=\r\n its presence. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightrazor considered firing back as he fled, =\r\nbut he knew as\nsoon as he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; completely dropped his shields the other sh=\r\nip would no doubt\nopen fire,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and he was not here for conflict. With a=\r\n boost of power, now well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within his cloaking field&#39;s ability to mask=\r\n he rose higher and\nhigher\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into the air. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He would eithe=\r\nr have to watch from a distance or move on, he was\nreally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in no posit=\r\nion to take on two defenders plus a well armed ship.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; (Nightrazor)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;      \n&gt; &gt;\n______=\r\n___________________________________________________________________________=\r\n___\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You rock.
