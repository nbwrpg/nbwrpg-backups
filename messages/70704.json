The gates were flanked by several more drones, these\nlooking like that had some sort of helicoptor altmode, who barely even\nglanced at them as they passed by. Overhead twin predacon jets, the\nsame two that had been circling over the city, took off to make a\nwider circle around the city. Meanwhile a dark colored shuttle of some\nsort passed over head heading into the city, although what it was was\ndifficult to make out with the dull haze of smog that blanketed the\ncity.\n\n&quot;This way.&quot; Tankor said with only the slightest glanced upward at the\nsudden spate of airtraffic.\n\nInside the city it seemed like there were many drones of all different\nsorts. most of them looked like drones made from the constructicons:\nDumptrucks, cranes, bulldozers and all sorts made thier way through\nthe city. The buildings did not seem to be in the best of shape, most\nof them covered in dark soot and some sort of brown dust, and while\nstable look like they have been barely maintained, some of them had\nobviously been abandoned and then pressed into some other service.\n\nTankor He began leading them towards what was obviously the security\nbuilding, and even it seemed like it had once been somethng else, but\nnow had been pressed into this new service. As they moved several\nfigures peered out at them from dark alleyways, only thier optics\nbeing dimly seen, but at a glance from Tankor or one of his drones\nthey fled back into hiding.\n\n&quot;Empties.&quot; Injector said as he walked, his face turned into distaste.\n&quot;They were on Cybertron before too.
