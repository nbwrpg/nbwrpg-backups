After a \nsecond of staying put, his treads kicked in, launching him out of the crater. \n Firing off two sonic blasts from the barrel of his tank cannon, he let his \nautomatic &quot;laser rifle&quot; mounted on the top of his tank mode fire rapid blasts \nat the autoguns as they shot him, bouncing off of his armor.\n\n------\n\nUnitrn laughed, the autogun shots knocking him back slightly.  Raising his \nrifle, he fired a single shot, optic blasts launched out, and a burst of \nflames, each blast at an individual autogun.\n\n"}}
