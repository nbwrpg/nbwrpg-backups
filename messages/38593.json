This is all because I let him go the first time he attacked.  As \nfor you Sarge, I have just as much reason to kill him.  In our last fight I \nlost an arm and a leg defending others.  I nearly died because there were \nbots in the battle that shouldn&#39;t have been there.  I couldn&#39;t care less \nabout his lackeys.  Now then, let&#39;s get to the meeting so we can finish it \nand start planning our attack.&quot;  He stands tall glaring at Sarge.\n\n"}}
