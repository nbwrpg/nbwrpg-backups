From my experience, when I \ndied, Liono put my body in a CR chamber, and it was forgotten for nearly a \nmonth. Then a powersurge at the Ark must have somehow brought my spark back. \nI&#39;ve checked the computer logs, that power surge was the only think that \nhappened since I was put in the CR, so it must have caused it.&quot;\n\nDeep in thought, Ramulus was now forgetting about his space sickness, his \nmind on the matter at hand.\n\n"}}
