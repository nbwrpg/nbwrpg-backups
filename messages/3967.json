That&#39;s funny.  I was one of the first members\nwhen\n&gt; this RPG originall started.  I remember when you were a little no buddy\nwho\n&gt; couldn&#39;t RP in the AOL chatrooms.  I remember you begging to fight me when\nI\n&gt; ripped out Keyura Max&#39;s spark from her chest and kept it in my lair.  I\n&gt; remember you continously harrassing me saying: &quot;This is the end of the\nroad,\n&gt; Unitron.&quot; and it ticked me off seeing some loser like you quoting someone\n&gt; like Rodimus Prime, even if he was a loser.  Hell!  I got AOL back and\npeople\n&gt; still got worried around me!  My base was still around!  Now I don&#39;t have\nAOL\n&gt; again, but I remember you being nothing but a little moder.  You know\nwhat?\n&gt; Nothing has really changed.  I really don&#39;t want to be rude, but your\n&gt; ignorance is just bugging me.  Are you saying you installed the cannon in\nthe\n&gt; Ark?  If that IS what you&#39;re saying, that is better.  Still BS, but\nbetter.\n&gt; But Tigerhawk was outside.  Now he&#39;s inside?  Your posts are unclear.\nYou&#39;re\n&gt; a terrible leader.  I&#39;m tired of sitting back and watching the Maximals\nlose\n&gt; time and time again!  The Alliance was made just to save the Maximals from\n&gt; the Predacons!  UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP!  A new leader is needed.  I hope\n&gt; everyone realizes you&#39;re unfit.  You&#39;d need a whole crew just to get the\n&gt; fusion cannon out of the dang water.  And from what I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s off in\n&gt; space.  And putting into the Ark as a weapon?  That just shows how totally\n&gt; stupid and retarded (maybe a little redundant) you really are.\n&gt;\n&gt; Terribly sorry if that offends anyone or if they think I&#39;m a jerk.  But\nI&#39;m\n&gt; just sick and tired of this crap.  How this idiot became leader of the\n&gt; Maximals is beyond me other than &quot;first come first served&quot;.  I mean, dang,\n&gt; even when BioBuu AKA BioStinger came around a month ago, he would even\nmake a\n&gt; better leader for the Maxis!  All the Maximals do is get attacked!  The\nonly\n&gt; time I&#39;ve seen them attack is the Newcomer&#39;s craft, and that was a\nscouting\n&gt; mission and they were...ATTACKED.  You&#39;ll never win with that fool in\ncharge.\n&gt;  The Alliance and Predacons have to ally with them just to keep them alive\n&gt; from fourteen people!  The Newcomers!  The Maximals have over 25!  I think\n&gt; the leader reflects on the people he leads.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once more, sorry if this offensive.  &quot;Flame&quot; me as they call it all you\nwant,\n&gt; but I can&#39;t sit back and watch this.  The constant moding.  The constant\n&gt; non-understandable e-mails.  The leader of a powerful faction that plays a\n&gt; part in the very future of the Universe, shouldn&#39;t be a fool who modes.\n&gt; Sorry, RgDaN, but that, is just how it is.  And I just have to make that\n&gt; clear to EVERYONE.  I say, kick RgDaN out of leadership, put Iron Raptor\nin.\n&gt; She is actually brave.  She took responsibility for all Maximals who\nattacked\n&gt; the Oblitercons (nonetheless the circumstances at the time of them\nshooting\n&gt; first and the others were firing in self defense for a moment of the\nfight)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Unitron AKA ShawnFett\n&gt; KSLawDogg@...\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Conference Calling with Firetalk!\n&gt; Click Here!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5480/10/_/_/_/961534672/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
