Far enough to be out of sight, close enough to hear the conversation.  She fought the urge o run up behind him and pummel him, but she also just wanted to be around him.  A strange thought indeed for a Minion.  She pushed hat aside and began linking the sensors on Malice&#39;s body to a computer panel.  She intialized the connection and something bizarre happened.  Malice went rigid, emitted a pained groan, then completely shut down.  Hellplague ran in after she was recieving no info on Malice&#39;s body.\n&quot;What happened?  What did you do to him?&quot; she demanded as she tried to awake Malice to no avail.\n \nOOC: Did you get the email applying my new character yet? \n\nairly2000 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\nBlackNightmare::\n\n&quot;It&#39;s your life Hellplague not mine&quot;said sacastically the femme\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hellplague/ Splattercannon/ Malice:\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Well no one asked you, now did they?&quot; Hellplague said as she \nstepped in front of Malice and placed some small sensors on Malice&#39;s \nface, head and on various locations all over his body.  She turned \nto Necross and splattercannon and told them to pull him to his feet \nas she lessened the gravity holding him down.  The males obeyed and \npulled Malice up roughly.  The bounty hunter leaned against \nSplattercannon as the sudden climbing to his feet made him a little \nlight headed.  He stood up straight and tried to look behind him, \nbecause he couldn&#39;t see that mischevious Hellplague and that was \ncause for worry.  The Sweep commander shoo-ed away Necross and \nSplattercannon as she wrapped her arms around Malice&#39;s waist.   The \nmales obeyed with hesitation, while Necross left the room entirely, \nSplattercannon took position by the door.  Malice looked at the arms \naround his waist and looked back at the femme biehind him.  It was \nat this time he actually noticed, she was kinda pretty.  She looked\n&gt;  like a Generation One Decepticon, only with no insignia.  But the \nthough passed out of his mind as quickly as it entered.\n&gt; &quot;&#39;Scuse me, but I fel I must tell you something.  I&#39;m taken.  A \nlittle Maxi down there is waiting on me.&quot;\n&gt; The Minion did not speak, but walked around in front of Malice, \nher arms still around his waist.  \n&gt; &quot;Well she&#39;s down there, and I&#39;m right here in front of you.  \nBesides, I can offer you more than that Maximal-&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Maxitron actually,&quot; the hunter corrected,&quot;it seems she was dumped \nhere on accident while dealing with her universe&#39;s Unicron.&quot; he \nadded with a grin.\n&gt; &quot;Whatever.
