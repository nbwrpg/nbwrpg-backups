Being \nspooked a bit, she transformed into fox pup mode and back to bot \nmode. &quot;Uh, I&#39;m not in trouble am I?&quot; she said sniffling a bit. She \nlooked up at the reptile and grinned a bit. &quot;Hi, what kind of bot are \nyou?&quot;  She looked at Malice, &quot;Whoah, I never met you before.&quot;  She \nlooked at the other two bots and smiled. &quot;Hi. I&#39;m Camoflage. At least \nthat&#39;s what Blackfang called me a long time ago. What&#39;s all your \nnames?&#39; she said trying to cheer up a bit.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bustercross365&quot; &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice patted her on the back and stood up, the child in his arms. \n&gt; &quot;Lets go inside.&quot;\n&gt; He turns and goes inside, his tail off the ground.  He enters the \n&gt; mess hall once again and set the young bot in a chair.  He pulls up \na \n&gt; chair and sits in front of her.\n&gt; &quot;No one is going to be angy with you.  Your friend is getting th \nbest \n&gt; help here, and will be alright.&quot;\n&gt; Malice got up and got the child a cup of energon and hande it to \n&gt; her.  He felt sorry for her, he felt the same way on a few \noccasions. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&gt; &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She tried to stop sobbing, and sniffled a bit. &quot;Your not going to \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; mad at me are you?
