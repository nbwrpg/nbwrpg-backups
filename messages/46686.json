I&#39;ll agree wi=\r\nth you on \nthat one. Preds and Decepticons are cowardly at best.&quot; He transf=\r\norms \ninto his vehicle mode for Skullhammer, a red, black and blue sleek \nm=\r\notorcycle with a red seat, black side armour, and blue fenders. His \nblue A=\r\nutobot symbols gleam on both sides of his side armour. He \nstays in motorcy=\r\ncle mode for a few seconds, then his frame folds \nback into his robot mode,=\r\n and he lands on his feet.\n\n&quot;I also transform into a sword and a shield, bu=\r\nt there&#39;s no point in \nshowing off even more.&quot; He says as he continues to f=\r\nollow Pacifix.\n\nPacifix enters the control room, and motions for the group =\r\nto take a \nseat. He himself sits down in the control chair in the south sid=\r\ne of \nthe room. &quot;Welcome, Skullhammer, to the Autobot base. The question \no=\r\nf the day is whether you intend to join us, or perhaps there was \nanother p=\r\nurpose for your arrival. We would be honoured to have you \njoin us, but we =\r\nwould also do all in our power to help you if you \nchoose not to stay.&quot; He =\r\nlooks at Crossroads who has taken a seat at \nthe scanners on the far left s=\r\nide, and then back to Skullhammer, his \neyes crossing the oval shaped grey =\r\nand blue room, taking in the \nnewer technology that went into the ship; the=\r\n weapons systems, then \nlight shielding (invisibility), long range to short=\r\n range high \ndetail scanners, and the engine controls, which were destroyed=\r\n \nbeyond hopes of repair from their crash.\n\nooC: Just trying to give you an=\r\n idea of the base. =3D)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;polar_claw_ca&quot; &lt;dfinnamore@h=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (OOC) I sure make a habit of the OOC beginnings, yes? Anyhoo,=\r\n I \nwas \n&gt; curious if the board usually gets even MORE active on weekends o=\r\nf \nnot=85\n&gt; Just so I know if I should check in more than twice daily. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; (IC) Flashing a bright steel grin, Skullhammer nods in agreement. \nThe \n&gt;=\r\n smaller transformer, indeed less aggressive for the moment than \n&gt; Crotale=\r\n, seems to be a relatively welcoming sort of bot. His \nvoice, \n&gt; resonant a=\r\nnd full, intones his answer. &quot;Thank you. Yes, big I am. \n&gt; With this new fo=\r\nrm, I don&#39;t expect many of the Preds or \nDecepticons \n&gt; on this planet to h=\r\nave much to say when I come into the fray. \n&gt; Skullhammer&#39;s my name, by the=\r\n way.&quot; With a curious gesture, \n&gt; Skullhammer asks in kind what Crossroads&#39;=\r\n alternate form is, \n&gt; considering the transformer is so much smaller than =\r\nthe massive \n&gt; elephant. \n&gt; \n&gt; The elephantine transformer, still in beast =\r\nmode, takes up stride \n&gt; with the pair of Pacifix and Crossroads. Consideri=\r\nng the \nadvantages \n&gt; of shifting, the large creature attempts to bring a t=\r\nransformation \n&gt; about. With a powerful flexing of his metallic muscles, \nS=\r\nkullhammer \n&gt; realigns a myriad of parts to quickly stand before them in ro=\r\nbot \n&gt; mode. In truth, the cannons on his arm must appear menacing to \n&gt; so=\r\nmeone not expecting the simple silvery-grey elephant to appear \n&gt; armed wit=\r\nh twin cannons built on the sides of his arms. He quickly \n&gt; disarms them s=\r\no as not to cause any unrest, and the cannons swivel \n&gt; back off the top of=\r\n his forearm to the side, and then backwards by \n&gt; his elbow. \n&gt; \n&gt; Skullha=\r\nmmer again flashes the same smile, a sort of uncaring and \n&gt; honest smile t=\r\nhat can easily show his lack of desire to cause any \n&gt; trouble. His bright =\r\nblue eyes light up as he sees the familiar \nstyle \n&gt; of base and equipment,=\r\n having been stuck in a Maximal beast \ntraining \n&gt; facility for the last th=\r\nree earth months. His chest features the \n&gt; Autobot insignia prominently (m=\r\nuch like Lioconvoy features the \n&gt; Maximal/Cybertron logo) in a brilliant r=\r\ned. Most of his accenting \n&gt; parts are a red of some shade. \n&gt; \n&gt; His strid=\r\nes soon take the same rhythm of Pacifix&#39;s footfalls, and \nhe \n&gt; treads alon=\r\ng the Autobot compound with quieter steps. As an \nelephant, \n&gt; his four fee=\r\nt make a thunderous racket. As a robot, his regular \nlegs \n&gt; make a less vi=\r\nolent din, even on metal or concrete. He follows \n&gt; Pacifix and Crossroads =\r\nand waits to see what happens.\n\n\n"}}
