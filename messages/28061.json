As the shots were fired he dove \nforward under \n&gt; the shots.  He landed near Lambda&#39;s gun and tossed it up into the \nshots.  One \n&gt; hit it and disintegrated it.  That was one less problem.  He picked \nhimself \n&gt; up and dashed at Luzbel.  &quot;I have no intention of dying today.&quot;  He \ndraws his \n&gt; staff and slashes at the large gun.\n\n\n"}}
