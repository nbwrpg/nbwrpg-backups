She waved him to \nfollow.\n\nKatya: Now about the Kerenskys... They are the founders of all Clans, \nthe makers of our society and one of the most, if not the most revered \nBloodline among all Clans. Some of us maintain that our duty as \nWarriors is to protect the Inner Sphere. We oppose the Crusaders \nsaying it is a desecrated place and that it deserves only to be \nconquered and brought back up into a stronger Clan society. It is all \ninterpretation of the words of Nicholas Kerensky, the first Ilkhan, \nand it has led many to die, both among and outside the Clans.\n\nShe closed her eyes remembered all too well the two days she had spent \nevading the massive ComGuard battlemechs at the Great battle of \nTukkayid. She had seen friends die there, and she felt that it was \nfoolish for such a waste as the invasion.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Owlhawk:  I assume it means to challenge him in\n&gt; combat, but I don&#39;t know who Kerensky is.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Katya glared at the bot straight in his eyes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katya: Noble intention about the animals, but\n&gt; &gt; following orders is not \n&gt; &gt; the only thing that makes a warrior. Remember, I\n&gt; &gt; told you that we \n&gt; &gt; abhor waste. Destroying a forest is the kind of\n&gt; &gt; thing that debalances \n&gt; &gt; a world&#39;s environment needlessly. A military\n&gt; &gt; compound can be built on \n&gt; &gt; rock farther away. In that situation, when you feel\n&gt; &gt; your officer&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; orders betray the spirits of Kerensky, you can and\n&gt; &gt; youmust challenge \n&gt; &gt; him to a Trial.

She was not\n&gt; &gt; instinctively\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harsh or cruel, but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her tone showed that she was to be listened to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Owlhawk may be a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior, but she was more. She was a Wolf\n&gt; &gt; Warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and she had to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; break him from the tactics and habits he was\n&gt; &gt; used to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make him into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Neg. A Clan warrior that is not prepared,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentally or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically is as good as the freebirth scum\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; populating the bandit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste. You must learn to be ready at all times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She eased her tone. She had rebuked him, and now\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instruct him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: The Clan rituals have two goals; the\n&gt; &gt; first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one is honor. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forces meeting in a Trial meet in a circle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equals. This way, we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight zellbringen, single combat. I admit that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessity may prevent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us from always achieving single combat, but\n&gt; &gt; honor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does not diminish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this way. The second reason for Trials is that\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevents waste. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Clans have survived their birthing because they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reduced wastes of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all kind to a minimum. Remember that. Now...\n&gt; &gt; What do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you do if a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superior gives an order to raze a forest to make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more place for a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; military compound?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart\n&gt; &gt; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC:  Sorry I thought they were going to wait\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they talked to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BIC:  Owlhawk moved over and stood at\n&gt; &gt; attention in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front of her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Owlhawk:  I assume to prepare your warrior\n&gt; &gt; both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentally and physically for combat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: What are you doing, you freebirth\n&gt; &gt; slag?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Move\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your circuits over \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here!
