He returned fire with a large blast from his fusion cannon \nat Chaostaur&#39;s left shoulder.  \n\nScavenger raised his chaingun, smiling, firing off twenty-five rounds of \nexplosive ammunition at Chaostaur&#39;s form.\n\nThe general movement of the Oblitercons was moving backwards, more autoguns \ncoming online to target the traitor.\n\n&lt;&lt;    He shakes his head.  &quot;You just can&#39;t find a decent target these days.&quot; \n  He curled up and took the shots to his heavily armored back.  &quot;If he \ndoesn&#39;t \n want me to shoot him he should have just pointed me at something else.  Was \n that so much to ask?&quot;  The two explosions knock him forward a few steps and \n he stands up again.  The fusion blast knocks him forward into a bulkhead.  \nHe \n turns around and snarls.  &quot;Do you see the missiles attached to my shoulders? \n \n Do you know how much damage those could cause in a contained area like \nthis?&quot; \n  He fires four shots out of his heavy blasters.  Two are aimed at Pyro and \n two at Hiss. &gt;&gt;\n\n"}}
