He walks up to an e=\r\nmpty one and \nopens up the side panel.  He takes the vial and place it in s=\r\nome \njoints and wires.  He then goes to the control panal and types a few \n=\r\nthings.  He walks in and closes the door.  All of a sudden the CR \nChamber =\r\nfills up with a green liquid and bubbles up.  All of a sudden \nUltraByte le=\r\nts out a scream.  The liquid drains and UltraByte steps \nout, he has green =\r\nbubbly metal for skin and he has giant eyes bulging \nout from his chest.  H=\r\ne then reopens the side panal and takes out the \nvial.  He throes it in a n=\r\near by trashcan when he walks back to his \nbridge, he says to the predacons=\r\n in his group, &quot;Are we ready?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;hugar_twriker&quot; &lt;hug=\r\nar_twriker@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =AAUltraByte=AA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;Wow, I am so honored =\r\nto be considered to lead a scouting \nteam.&quot;  \n&gt; UltraByte said out loud as =\r\nhe thought to himself &#39;You best reconize \n&gt; that I am the greatest.&#39;  Ultra=\r\nByte then looked towards the people \n&gt; that were going with him.  &quot;Okay I w=\r\nant all of you to make sure you \n&gt; have some powerful guns, atleast one per=\r\nson needs an explosive \n&gt; wepon.  I will be back in a nano, I just need to =\r\nget a beast form.  \n&gt; If you are planing to live, I suggest you get a beast=\r\n form too.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;    UltraByte then left for the CR Chambers.
