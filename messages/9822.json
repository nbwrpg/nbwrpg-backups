He had to act \nquickly. He shot at the missile heading for him first, then used his jumpjet \nto jump over kitkat and terrorsaur, and took both the ion disks, one in his \nshoulder, the other next to it, and accidentally dropped his gun.. He landed \non the ground several meters away form KitKat and terrorsaur, holding his \nshoulder.\n\n&quot;AAAAAHHHH!!! I&#39;LL KILL THEM!!!!&quot; he screamed, and sat up. He quickly \ngrabbed Injector&#39;s gun, and fired up at Manterror.\n\n\n&gt;From: KSLawdogg@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Fighting Is hell\n&gt;Date: Wed, 2 Aug 2000 19:45:03 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;(TK, does &quot;reappeared from hiding&quot; mean TK came out of his cloak?)\n&gt;\n&gt;Double Punch/Manterror/Injector/Bumblebee:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Double Punch saw Injector fall, tripping over KitKat and Terrorsaur.  &quot;A\n&gt;cloaking system, eh?  How nice.&quot; he said, knowing how to find it, having \n&gt;seen\n&gt;where the shots had come from and having a cloaking system himself, he \n&gt;acted\n&gt;in almost the blink of an eye.\n&gt;\n&gt;Raising a pincher he fired a missile six inches to the left of where the\n&gt;shots had hit, hopefully hitting the middle of the cloaked assailant.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Manterror looked over, hearing gunfire, seeing Injector down.  &quot;OH!  So\n&gt;they&#39;re picking on us now, after we just defend ourselves!  You&#39;ll pay for\n&gt;that!&quot; he yelled, raising both of his arms, firing one ion disk at KitKat,\n&gt;one at Terrorsaur.\n&gt;&quot;That&#39;ll teach you, ya misfits!&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
