He had understodd Primus&#39; rationale\n&gt; for reviving him and totally agreed, not out of\n&gt; conceit, but out of a deep understanding that unless\n&gt; the finest warriors of all time stand together united\n&gt; as one race, they were doomed. There seemd to be a\n&gt; number of sparks who would make a worthy front line,\n&gt; but how to get in touch with Primus. Shadowcaster knew\n&gt; he could commune with other sparks only by locking\n&gt; onto strong emotions. How he&#39;d be able to commune with\n&gt; Primusc when his current level of telepathy wwas so\n&gt; limited was beyond him, at least for a split second.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deciding that his current form was the most compact\n&gt; way to navigate the Maximal base, he entered, then\n&gt; opened a channel to Rodimus. His tone grave and filled\n&gt; with grim determination.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Rodimus, there is something of the utmost importance\n&gt; I must discuss with you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://greetings.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
