He thought of his options. He could start firing, but he \nhad \n&gt; not decided which group was the best to go with. Those Rogues were \n&gt; greater in number, but that did not prove anything. Ice Hellion \n&gt; Warriors were many, and their prowess in combat did not reflect \nthis. \n&gt; The Tripredacus, on the other hand, seemed less organized, even \nthough \n&gt; they seemed better armed.\n&gt; \n&gt; His declaration of being the object of the trial of possession \nmight \n&gt; motivate them, but he harbored no illusions. He was a human, \nunknown \n&gt; to these machines. He had not proven himself, but was confident he \n&gt; could be of some use.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, there was this female robot. He did not know who she was or \n&gt; which team she was in, but it seemed as though she had a clear \n&gt; mission, maybe even unknown to her. There had to be a way he could \n&gt; bring her with him.\n&gt; \n&gt; In all these options, running was not present. It was the cowards \nway \n&gt; out, and Wolf Warriors were not cowards.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or... yes...\n&gt; \n&gt; He fired his two missile racks in the air and forty tiny explosions \n&gt; peppered the sky. He intended to make a show.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vlad: I AM KHAN VLADIMIR WARD OF CLAN WOLF. I DO NOT KNOW WHO YOU \nARE, \n&gt; BUT I RECOGNIZE YOUR VALUE AS WARRIORS. I SUGGEST A TEMPORARY \n&gt; CEASE-FIRE SO WE MAY DISCUSS BETTER AMONG EQUALS.\n&gt; \n&gt; He knew the chances that the enemies see themselves as equals were \n&gt; slim, but it was worth trying.\n\n\n"}}
