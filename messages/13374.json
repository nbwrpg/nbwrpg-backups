She closed \nthe door behind her but didn&#39;t lock it.  She layed down on her bed \nand put her arm up over her eyes.  She was slowly starting to fall \nasleep.  She opened her eyes and sat up.  She thought about what had \nhappened.  She was mad at herself for letting her anger and her honor \ntake control when she shouldhave been thinking.  She sighed and knew \nwhat she had to do.  She got up and walked to the main room and knelt \ndown on one knee infront of Megatron.  She lowered her head and \nwaited for the blow to come. \n\n\n"}}
