I did reply to this post already but Hotmail&#39;s a bit on the slow \nside this week. So here it is again.\n\nDesmonus:\n\n* Desmonus felt her head hit something hard, which little did she know that \nit was BloodyStrikes knee-plate.\nShe heard him, or somebot, yell behind her as she crashed into him, both of \nthem flying down the hall way and right into another bot, reptilica.\nShe saw a faint glimps of both of them just before everything stopped with a \nbang, right into the wall leading off into the next hall passage.\n\nThe ship continued to rock as the base was being hauled to the Pit knew \nwhere, and as far as she was concerned she didn&#39;t really care.\nDesmonus had hit her head pretty hard and it was almost as if small lights \nwere dancing infront of her optics, making her want to bat them away.\nBut with a growing pain in her head she simply closed her optics and let the \ndarkness take her, the pain fading out just as her conciousness did.*\n\n\nIR:\n\n* She simply sighed as she watched Prowl stumble towards her a but, seeing \nhis broken wing like that and what pain he was in.\nHe was rather a pitiful sight at the moment, looking a bit pathetic as if he \nhad just come out of a dryer.\nIron Raptor just stood there and shook her head, knowing that Prowl wouldn&#39;t \ngive up until he was either going to the Ark with her of going back to base \nwith her proping him up all the way back. Eather way, he was going with her.\nBut with him like this now, it was risky to take him with her. But she \nwasn&#39;t going back and he wasn&#39;t about to stop following her either.\nSo, there was only one salution.\n\nIron Raptor walked up to Prowl and bumped her shoulder against his waist, \nenough to get the point but not enough to knock him over.\nShe looked towards the forest as she waited  for him to climb onto her back. \nAnd if he refused then she would have to insist. And at the moment he didn&#39;t \nstand a chance against her in an arguement.\n\nThe forst was the fastest way to the Ark, or what was left of it. But with \nProwl she would have to take the long way, mainly so that he wouldn&#39;t ge \nsmacked in the face with brnaches.\nShe sighed and looked back at him.*\n\n&quot; On the way you should activate your repair system, have you as good as new \nby the time we get to the Ark. I&#39;ll need able hands to help me dig Iris out \nof the wreckage.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
