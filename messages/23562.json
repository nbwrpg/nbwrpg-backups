He frowns, activating his comm.\n\n&quot;Starlight, Fenox, Griplash, Recklessa, Demolition, forget about \nwhatever you were looking for.&quot; Zardus orders them over the \ncomm, &quot;Report to Dark Angel&#39;s position, he needs backup against \nMaximal troops.&quot;\n\nHe then opens his comm to Deemos. &quot;Deemos, some Alliance troops need \nbackup at the newly arrived pod. Can you send some of your troops?&quot;\n\nZardus looks at his wrist comp, noting that Repressor and Najah were \nin the training rooms. Gotron was talking to Lady Hawk, but thatw as \nok. He could keep an eye on her. But there was always a later time \nfor training, battle was urgent.\n\n&quot;Repressor, Najah, report to Dark Angel&#39;s position. Attack any \nMaximal troops there,&quot; he says into his comm.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFenox and groop recieve Zardus&#39; transmission, turning to head toward \nthe battle. They wern&#39;t very far away as it is, they could even see \nthe battle on their scopes.\n\nRecklessa arrives first, yelling a battle cry as she swoops down \ntoward the battle, firing two missiles at Windlord and a few optic \nshots at Aerotaur. Fenox and Starlight arrive behind her. Fenox opens \nfire with an automatic rifle at Angel Prime and Starlight fires \nstinger missiles along with a tranqualizer gun at Teltoli. Griplash \ngets there last, throwing down a charge (set to detonate on impact) \nat Teltoli&#39;s pod.\n\n&quot;That femm is Alliance property!&quot; Fenox yells while firing. A shot \nbarely misses Fenox&#39;s head as Rex flies in, firing.\n\n&quot;No, she&#39;s a Maximal,&quot; he replies, dodging a shot from Recklessa.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot looks ahead, seeing a battle and recognizing some of the \nenergy signatures as Alliance. Finally!\n\n&quot;There&#39;s a battle up ahead, let&#39;s go!&quot; He says to BrightBlade (Moon \nMist, I know you&#39;re reading this, so you better reply). He takes off \nat a run toward the battle, a missile launcher flipping into his hand.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRepressor sighs as he recieves Zardus&#39; message, his hand jerking away \nwhen Najah bites him. &quot;We&#39;re needed at battle,&quot; he says to the bot he \nhad been training with as he wriggles out of Najah&#39;s grasp, &quot;Let&#39;s \ngo!&quot;\n\nHe runs out of the training room, heading for the exit of the Iron \nFist.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster looks at Whistler and nods. &quot;Go ahead and help them out.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, steph_teltoli@m... wrote:\n&gt; (OOC: Eek, sorry bout the mode, I&#39;m in the middle of another RPG \nand \n&gt; we&#39;re allowed to do that, just not fully.. sorry again! Oh, you \nwere \n&gt; in the air? Didn&#39;t know that..)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Mreeooww!&quot; Teltoli yelps in pain when the blade stops, hitting a \n&gt; rib, and leaps off him. It was only a shallow cut. She flaps the \n&gt; wings on her back, preparing to fly up, but Aerotaur succeeds in \nhis \n&gt; flying leap, and knocks her to the side.\n&gt; \n&gt; She hisses when they both land in the dust, opposite of Windlord, \nand \n&gt; Aerotaur is lying on top of her chest. He quickly rolls off and she \n&gt; jumps up, ready to attack again when she feels two hands grip her \n&gt; shoulders and keep her back. Aerotaur again.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Bot sighs and slumps her shoulders, but obeys the unspoken \norder \n&gt; to keep back, she knows she should stay back anyway. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Come on Windlord, kick his tush!&quot; She grins.\n\n\n"}}
