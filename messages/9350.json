My bots&#39; names are Hakibuscon and Skulletron. \nSkulletron serves the Alliance.  His beast mode is a Hyena.  Hakibuscon&#39;s\nbeast mode is a very sneaky/stealthy Chameleon.  Remember one thing about\nHakibuscon, HE DOES NOT SERVE ANY OF YOU PUNKS!!!  (I&#39;m just kidding!  You\nguys aren&#39;t punks!)  Just wanted to let you know that Hakibuscon is a\nlonerbot right now.  Can someone please tell me LOTS MORE about the\nAlliance?  I am not going to use Skulletron until I&#39;m caught up with what\nthe factions are doing ok.\n\n\n\tHakibuscon was walking through the jungle, and was getting very mad, as he\nhad to keep slicing vines.  When Hakibuscon was past all the vines he sat\non the ground for a while.  Suddenly, a huge panther was coming at him.  He\ntried to defend, but the panther was too fast.  He had to do something. \nAnd then it dawned on him.\n\n\t&quot;Vehicle Mode!&quot;\n\n\tHakibuscon was in vehicle mode, so now he was speedy as well.  He wheeled\nout of the way and went behind the panther.  Then he shot 4 darts into the\npanther.  Each dart jolts 500 volts into a target, so all 4 darts put\ntogether makes 2000 volts.  The panther looked dead, just laying on the\nground.\n\n\t&quot;Transform!&quot;\n\n\tHakibuscon went back into robot mode.  Hakibuscon lifted up the panther\nand twisted its neck.\n\n\t&quot;That&#39;s what you get when you screw around with me @SS#ole!&quot;\n\n\nHow was that for my first post?  Sorry it was a bit long.  I crammed a\nlittle too much in there.  Also, please let me know if cursing like that is\nagainst the rules.  Next time, I promise I will make a shorter post. \nPosting long posts is bad RP&#39;ing.  I was just getting carried away because\nit&#39;s my first post and this RPG seems SOOOOO exciting!!\n\n\n"}}
