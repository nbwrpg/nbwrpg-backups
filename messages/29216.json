She didn&#39;t know any \nlullaby so she continued talking with the baby with a sweet tone \nwhile she cradled her, it seemed calm her down. As soon as baby ended \nto drink the milk she would retired the baby&#39;s bottle and would find \na place to let baby sleep... &quot;humm&quot; thought the femme &quot;maybe she will \nneed an apropiate bed... well -a baby&#39;s bed...&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Moon Mist&quot; &lt;shadowwarrior_ax@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; She ate soundly, her tiny paws working against the sides of the \nbottle like \n&gt; they would against mommy&#39;s side to get the milk out. Her itty claws \nclicked \n&gt; at the sides, feeling warmer when Starice spread her wings and \ncradled her \n&gt; in them.\n&gt; The soft wings reminded her of mommy&#39;s fur and with the warm milk \nit was \n&gt; almost the exact same, the only things different is that the milk \ntasted \n&gt; different and she couldn&#39;t smell mommy&#39;s scent.\n&gt; But she kept on eating, making little sucking sounds as she lowered \nthe \n&gt; level of milk in the bottle.\n&gt; The sounds of Starice&#39;s voice was comforting to her, soothing her \nwith its \n&gt; sweet tone.\n&gt; She was almost ready for sleep, and her paws left the bottle, \nmoving slowly \n&gt; in tiny movements as she suckled.\n&gt; So tiny, so soft and innocent. A round, rolly-polly puppy.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
