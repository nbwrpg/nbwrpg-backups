I think I can manage...&quot;\n\n* And with that she left Prowls grasp and headed towards the door towards \nthe bathroom, slightly looking over the room as she traveled there.\nShe quickly entered the room and turned on the lights, thinking to herself \nthat it was a fairly nice bathroom for a battleship.\nIron Raptor spotted the closed in shower and sighed, trying to remember the \nlast time she bothered to do such a thing, coming to the grose conclusion \nthat she never had.\nShe shrugged, there was a first time for everything.\nThe door to the bathroom closed with a thud behind her, startling her \nslightly and making her snapp her head towards the sound. Making her vision \nblur a bit, clutching the wall to keep her balance.\nIron Raptor slightly staggered towards the shower, finally falling to her \nknees and hanging off the wall.\nIt was happening again, the pain...\nBut something else was happening at the same time too, something that she \ndidn&#39;t remember happening before...but it had.\n\nWhen she had been at the Alliance base, her rising rage had caused her beast \nmodes to merge, and become uncontrolable.\nWell, it was happening again.\nOnly now there was no need for the rage, only one simple fact:\n\nBoth beast modes were in battle with each other, each wanting to be the \ndominent of the two.\nAnd at the current moment, the velociraptor was dominent, as it had been for \na while. When Iron Raptor transfored into her second beast mode, the \ncreature was dominent.\nNow, now they were fighting. The creature against the raptor, each \nfighting...and that was what had been causing her great pains.\nThey had been merging, and now they were ready to be released onto the \nworld.\n\nIron Raptor could almost feel it, her armor shifting and her own mech-fluids \nDNA code changing...and it hurt like hell!!!\nShe suddenly stood with a scream, the pain more then she could ever handle, \nstill not knowing what was happening until it was too late!!\n\nWith a roar the fembot was transformed, shifting into a mode which held the \nform of the merged beast modes. Except...it was different then before.\nInstead of a large raptor, there stood something else, covered in the \nmech-fluid of the fembot it had been just moments before.\nIt stood on all fours, it&#39;s clawed limbs digging into the metal of the \nbathroom floor.\nAbout the side of a large horse, silver stripes covering it&#39;s body, a light \nshade of gray covering it&#39;s belly, bottom jaw and all the way to the tip of \nit&#39;s whiplike tail. The claw of a raptor emerged from the first toe on each \not it&#39;s hind feet, the head with it&#39;s flat skull swining in every direction, \ntaking everything in.\n\nHere stood a creature, hald raptor, but more of the second beast mode.\n\nBut as it stood there in the flurecent light of Prowls washroom, it turned \nit&#39;s head towards the door, letting lose the growl of a hungry nightmare. \nIt&#39;s systems craving cybertronien flesh.*\n\n\n( I&#39;m adding a pic of an Alien from the movie series, as well as a VERY \nrough sketch of the posture of IRs third BM.\nOK. The colored pic is basically what she is, but she doesn&#39;t stand upright \nlike that.\nIt&#39;s the sketch which she stands like.\nSo, just imagin the alien in the colored pic in the posture of the sketch, \nas well as with the details I described in the post...and there you have it. \nIR&#39;s third BM.\nThank you for your time.\nIf the sketch did not come, I am posting it again.)\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_55f5_532c_5ed8\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; name=&quot;Pre-typr#3.doc&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Pre-typr#3.doc&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_55f5_532c_5ed8--\r\n\n"}}
