Because the lock down was in place, it would be near \nimpossible to get into any of the rooms. The corridor doors could be forced \nopen, but it took time. As for the shields, Megatron made sure that he was \nclosing a path behinde him, and opening a path before him. In case they did \nstumble across the rebels, all he had to do was raise a shield. Of course, \nbeing an internal shield it would last only 10 minutes of crossfire before it \ngave way. Plenty of time in Megatrons mind to either stand ground or retreat.\n    &quot;Were almost thier. Nothing to worry about.&quot; Rampage said, his large \ntriple missle launcher cast over his shoulder.\n    \n\n"}}
