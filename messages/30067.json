Perndabot didn&#39;t.\n\n&quot;Allright.&quot; he says, turning to Nue&#39;e and Biomass, &quot;I suppose you&#39;re \nhere to join, and not to fight, right?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Biomass watched Perndabot very carefully, seeing his muscles \nstrain to get \n&gt; ready for the strike. His own muscles bunched under strain as he \nreadied \n&gt; himself for impact and a strike if his own when, just then, another \nmale bot \n&gt; made the sceen.\n&gt; He looked over towards FZ as he entered the area, not even noticing \n&gt; Perndabot stand down and Nue&#39;e nearly jump out of her armor. In \nfact, the \n&gt; startled femm stumbled back and tripped over the large gustalt&#39;s \nfoot, \n&gt; lanting on it with a thud.\n&gt; Biomass lifted a brow and watched FZ, who was this man anyway. He \nmust be \n&gt; some sort of higher authority to command Perndabot like that.\n&gt; Was he the commander?\n&gt; But Nue&#39;e was the first to answer FZs question before any others.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; A bunch of showing off.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She got to her feet, though still standing on the foot. She moved \nher \n&gt; glasses back up her face and looked at FZ. But then it was her turn \nto lift \n&gt; a brow when amother femal came, some cat-bot (feline). She rolled \nher optics \n&gt; at the way that she stood and talked, shaking her head and \nwondering if all \n&gt; the women on this planet acted like this and how it would be a \nshame if they \n&gt; did.\n&gt; Biomass, on the other hand, hoped that ALL women were like this one \nwhen he \n&gt; saw her. His eyes couldn&#39;t help but move down her body but what \ninterest he \n&gt; had he hid and then turned to look back at FZ.\n&gt; But soon the woman had gone to do FZs bidding and that left them as \nthey \n&gt; were before, waiting for FZ to speak or something to happen.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
