No predacon every just gave away something for \nnothing.  But then again, she found that she could use Aracnia and \npossably benefit more from this deal than she originally thought. but \none doesn&#39;t rush into a deal, not without checking out al the \nangles. &quot;I thank you Aracnia for your gracious offer. Yes, I shall \nneed time to think about it.  I shall give my answer in a day or two.&quot;\nKitKat may not be a natural born leader, but she knew that in \nbusiness, one attracted more flies with honey than vinigar. And \nAracnia&#39;s words were dripping with honey.  \n&quot;Aracnia, I was thinking. And please feel free to give your opinion, \nbut if we are to unite all the pred groups, would it not be a good \nidea to create our own Predacon council here on earth, modelled after \nthe Cybtronian council. This way all the leaders would have a say, as \ncaptians of thier own groups.  You would direct your group, as I \nwould with mine, but the council as a whole would make the \ndicisions.  This would also increase our trust with one another.  We \nwould sit equally at the table, leader to leader. And this would also \nstrengthen us against the maximals.&quot;\n\nShe looked and saw the intruder light blinking on her wrist monitor.  \nShe contacted Starscream on her link. &quot;Starscream, there appears to \nbe a bot at our entrance. Would you be so kind as to find out what \nthe bot needs and take care of things untill I finished here. Thank \nyou.&quot;\n\n\nShe turned back to Aracnia,&quot;What do you think, rule together?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Aracnia looked to Cyber Claw with caution in her optics, &quot;Calm \ndown, the \n&gt; bots who let you in were kitkat and Drillbit. Dont be concerned \nwith them, \n&gt; not yet.&quot; Turning, she could hear Dark Mouses cries from the other \nroom.\n&gt;     If Aracnia could do one thing good, it was to hold a grudge. \nThat little \n&gt; vermine was a deserter, she left Aracnia without so much as telling \nanyone \n&gt; else. Bots like those had one fate in the Predacons......death. \nSlow and \n&gt; painful. Of course she didnt intend to kill her little mouse, not \nat all, \n&gt; actually she was going to let her dangle on her hook until she came \nrunning \n&gt; back to Aracnia. Then Aracnia would inform her of what ahppens to \ntreachorus \n&gt; Predacons....and tell her that she was no better than Megatron. \nThat would \n&gt; send anybot into a downward spiral of self hate and depression. \nAracnia \n&gt; frowned......what a waste of liquid energone too.\n&gt;     &quot;So, Kitkat, as I was saying......Our groups should unite. \nUnder your \n&gt; direction of course. Im willing to comply with you so that the \nPredacons can \n&gt; once agian be united. If you want to come to my base and check that \nout it \n&gt; can be arranged, anything you need I shall provide you with.&quot; Black \nAracnia \n&gt; said, tring to ignore that idiot Starscreams rants and raves about \nher true \n&gt; intentions......bots like those got an even worse death than \ndeserters....\n&gt;     Aracnia smiled, a rare event, &quot;Will you require time to think \nabout this, \n&gt; Commander?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Nighteyes limped through the forest, turning at Aracnia \ncruiser. Mech \n&gt; fluid was pouring out of her like a fountian. Megatron had shot her \nin the \n&gt; thigh.....and she needed a CR chamber. Hell Beast cast her out for \nbeing a \n&gt; female, and said it would lead to internal conflict. The closest \nbase was \n&gt; Kitkats.....and she knew she would be recived very well, but death \nwas apon \n&gt; her like the sunset was apon the land.\n&gt;     She got to the door, and fell, scratching her claws agianst the \ndoor. \n&gt; &quot;Help, please! S.O.S.! Help me, someone!&quot; She cried in vain....time \nwas \n&gt; short, and she began to feel light headed.\n\n\n"}}
