There are not guardian angels in this RPG, and, if \nholograms can do damage and stuff, they count as group chars and are \nillegal. Besides, you need somewhere to broadcast a hologram from.\n\nIf this keeps on, I&#39;ll just edit the rules and put holograms in there \nso that a potentially useful (if used fairly, without turning it into \na group character) aspect would be outlawd, as happens when things \nare abused. I&#39;m sure the others don&#39;t want to lose this possibility, \nso lets play fair.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Benny Hillo&quot; &lt;teletran13@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; You got teh wrong guy kevin ramsey, that was his guardian angel and \nan army \n&gt; of holograms, you can&#39;t have drones or humans do you dirty work, \nthe rules \n&gt; never said ANYTHING about holograms, I checked myself and holograms \nare not \n&gt; mentioned in there.\n\n\n"}}
