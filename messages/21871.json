She had kept her mind closed off so she wouldn&#39;t \nhear what the other bots were thinking. She looked at \nLunarpine. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; She ran out of the room and headed for the \nlab. She was a little faster at running than Lunarpine, but it wasn&#39;t \nby much. She got there opened the lab door. She saw this big green bot\nattacking FoxFingers. She transformed into polar bear and roared at \nit. She was almost the same size as this bot. She felt her wings grow \nout of her shoulders as she changed into griffen mode. She thought to \nherself,&quot;I got to get that undercontrol.&quot; She looked at raptor \nbot. &quot;But now it is not the time,&quot; se thought to herself. She \nsquawked and flapped her wings. &quot;FOXFINGERA, GET EHIND ME!&quot; She \nsquawked and tried to get the bot&#39;s atttention so that FoxFingers and \nVeratis could get out of the way. She glared at this bot. &quot;It&#39;s just \nyou and me pal.&quot; She was ready to see what her new form could do in \nbattle.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Ice or Shadow Wing, she was still the trusting soul she always \n&gt; was. &quot;Regaurdless of what he seems to be, he still hasn&#39;t earned my \n&gt; trust.&quot; Lunarpine didn&#39;t know whether it was paranoia or instinct \nbut \n&gt; Veratis still hadn&#39;t shown what his true motives were. &quot;What kind \nof \n&gt; being would preach peace and carry a virus that could wipe out an \n&gt; entire planet?&quot; There was still to much to learn to fully \nunderstand \n&gt; thier host, but he was at least willing to give the old bot a \nchance.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In the lab The chamber opened to reveal a large green raptor, claws \n&gt; and teeth shining like stars at night. It made no movement to \nattack, \n&gt; the only movement it made was a loud roar and then stare at the two \n&gt; bots before it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Greetings&quot; Veratis began, &quot;I am Veratis, and this is Foxfingers.&quot; \nHe \n&gt; tried to stay back in case of trouble. A sudden movement from \n&gt; Foxfingers set the raptor on immediate alert. Spotting the scarred \n&gt; maximal symbol set his functions spinning. With a quick jump it \nleapt \n&gt; forward, Foxfingers ducked in time to avoid the blow.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Full alert, Lunarpine and Ice to the lab.&quot; Veratis shouted \n&gt; transforming to his half bat mode ready to defend himself. The \nraptor \n&gt; lashed out with it&#39;s tail connecting with Foxfingers chest. \n&gt; Foxfingers fought to maintain control but lost his balance. The \n&gt; raptor turned to attack again, &quot;Razor Claw Terrorize.&quot; He \ntransformed \n&gt; exactly like the origional dinobot but his head looked more \n&gt; insectoid. Antenna type ears rose above his head. He drew his sword \n&gt; for the deathblow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine hears Veratis&#39; transmission, &quot;We&#39;re needed,&quot; he exclaims \n&gt; unneededly, He knew that Ice probably heard the cry telepathically \n&gt; before the comm relayed it.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
