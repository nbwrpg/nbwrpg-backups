Ok...anyway, about the Oblitercons, they are a very close\n&gt; team.  They take an attack on one of their team members as on attack on\n&gt; themselves)\n\nOOC: Ha! I thought grenades would be more powerful than missiles, you know,\nand it&#39;s my base, shouldn&#39;t I decide what does most damage? Oh, and the name\nis not THECODE! I didn&#39;t get to pick my own e-mail, you know!\n\n&gt; Dark One activated his comm. unit.  &quot;Oblitercons, I&#39;m running low on\n&gt; missiles.  Try to not use energy weapons.  I wish to attempt to form\n&gt; Oblitertron again later.&quot;  Dark One fired of a pair of missiles as he\n&gt; received acknowledgements from the rest of his team.\n\nBase damage: Base takes more damage than usual, the missiles were well\nplaced.\n\n&gt; Breakdown let out a loud grunt as the missile exploded against his left\n&gt; pectoral, the explosion tearing apart much of his armor, his face cut from\n&gt; the exploding metal.  &quot;Hey, you too!&quot; he  yelled as he fired a grenade off\nat\n&gt; Shokaract.\n\nShokaract kicked the grenade, it flew towards Pyro.\n\nShokaract: think twice before throwing one of those stupid things.\n\n&gt; Pyro fired off three fire balls at Serge.\n\nSerge&#39;s back is set on fire, the fire does a decent amount of damage before\nSerge managed to put it out. Serge looks at Pyro then. He fires 4 times at\nhim.\n\n&gt; Hiss fired off three fusion blasts from his cannon at Shokaract.\n\nShokaract yells &quot;Ow!&quot; When the fusion blasts strike him, but he doesn&#39;t fire\nback, he ignores Hiss entirely.\n\n&gt; Scavenger fired off another 25 explosive rounds at the Mafia Base.  He\nlifted\n&gt; up his left arm, firing off another rocket from his bazooka at the Mafia\nBase.\n\nBase damage: Explosive rounds leave a dent in the base, they happened to\npierce the shields. The rocket strike the base, but the shields keep it from\ndoing much damage.\n\n&gt; Demon Wulf lifted his sword, another blade missile launching out at the\n&gt; shields.\n\nShields: Get hit, but that&#39;s about it. (Err, is this going to go on forever?\nJust asking.)\n\n&gt; Flesh Ripper fired another blast of flames from his mouth at the base.\n\nBase damage: Base fires at Flesh Ripper when the falmes hit the base, fire\ndoesn&#39;t do much damage to the base or it&#39;s shields.\n\n&gt; Dark Claw brought his hands together, slowly pulling them apart until they\n&gt; were three feet apart.  He threw the blue sizzling orb at the Mafia Base\n&gt; (same strength as two of the smaller orbs)\n\n(I&#39;d say this would do good damage, my perogative) Orb strike base, base&#39;s\nshields take damage because it happened to penetrate the shields, because\nthe shields were indeed weakened at some points.\n\n&gt; Unitron dived, firing two more missiles at the Mafia Base, pulling up\n&gt; quickly, a few autogun blasts scraping against the underbelly of his jet\n&gt; fighter mode.\n\n(Missiles...) Missiles strike base, do damage to shields.\n\n\n"}}
