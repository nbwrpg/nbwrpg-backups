Scanning for trip alarm beams now.\n&gt; Noth&#39;n is too easy when it looks it.  Learned that in special ops training.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIt is easy to note that had not POLAR CLAW not pointed out where the\ndoor was located it would have been exceedingly difficult to find. It\nwas thick made of some sort of strong and desnse metal, but it was\nshapped to look just like the stone that it was built into.\n\nPOLAR CLAW nodded, &quot;Good training.&quot; He said as NIGHTSHIFT&#39;s scanners\nbrought a sophisticated network on and around the door. A silent\nalarm, one that would electricfy the door.\n\n&quot;Just a moment.&quot; PROWL said as he heard the small pings from\nNIGHTSHIFT&#39;s scanners. He reached down and tapped in a small\nidentification code, and then after a moment NIGHTSHIFT&#39;s scanner read\nall clear.\n\nRAMULUS shrugged as WOLFGANG, &quot;You can be to careful as far as back doors go.&quot;\n\nThere was a grunt from POLAR CLAW as part of one of his shoulder\ncannos ejected and transformed into what looked somehting like a bat.\n\n&quot;This is Batscout.&quot; POLAR CLAW said by way of introducing it to\nNIGHTSHIFT as BATSCOUT kind of looped around for a moment.\n\n&quot;He is my drone unit and he will accompany you. He is well trained in\ntracking and surveillance operations.&quot; As he spoke POLAR CLAW laid his\nhand on the door then it flashed as it read his hand print. &quot;He will\nhave all the passcodes you need and he can let us know if you run into\nany problems.&quot;\n\nThe door clicked once and then hissed and then began to slowly open\nrevealing a long dark tunnel, cold air wooshed out.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
