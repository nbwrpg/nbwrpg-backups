And even the thought of that caused him to realize that if the tree fell towards him�Tavatron would be the one to be hit first!\nHowever, much to his relief, the tree did not strike near him as it�s trunk groaned and snapped as it fell�also taking a few other trees with it.\nHowever, throughout this entire experience he kept that wicked and cunning glint in his eye, nothing phasing him as he continued deeper into the forest.\nThe scream from Pyro echoed through the trees, a small and wicked smile developing at the cornered of his toothed mouth. The more the Alliance became angered and frustrated the better he felt!\nThe wicked smile soon evened out into a blank expression as his scanners caught the energy signatures of a few more bots, one�s in which dared to enter into the dark wood to give chase. Whether they exited alive was totally up to them!\nSensing Punch, Breakdown and Hiss perusing him he sped up a bit, actually relieved that Tavatron had taken her heel out of his side and made it easier to move.\nDinobot turned his head slightly and looked at Tavatron, the red glow of the burning fires situated in the background behind her. He looked her over to make sure that she was still in one piece, the twigs and small sticks protruding him her fur causing an amused look to cross his face. It wasn�t every day he saw a wolfling so perplexed and strained, it was slightly amusing!\nIt was then that the grenade in which Breakdown had sent exploded a little to close for comfort, dirt and forest scraps exploding into the air right behind him.\nIt was a bit obvious that the enemy was just a tad bit too close!\nPicking up his pace again he scanned ahead, the swamp he was heading for not all that far. Only a few more clicks and he�d be there!\nBut as he entered into the shadows he knew that it wasn�t going to be easy to get THERE, the forest would close around him soon, making movement a little more stressed it one didn�t watch. Every third step would be spent jumping over an exposed root, extreme moves that would slow him greatly and give the enemy time to close in.\nBut Dinobot wasn�t about to let that happen.\nWith a casual eye he glanced at the gathering branches above, and judged that the denseness of the forest would soon be closing in around them any moment.\nThen turning his eyes forward again he found himself correct, the first of the great roots exposed less then ten feet away and closing.\nDespite the fire and distant explosions he maintained his smart ass mood as well as they hyperactive energy bottled up within his muscles, the keen and cunning glint in his eyes still there if one cared to look.\nHe was actually enjoying himself, teasing the enemy to fall right into his own clawed hands.\nNot to mention he found it a bit funny that they were stupid enough to fall for it too!\nDinobot looked at the trees with a wicked snarl, the muscles in his legs pumping a little harder as he neared the first root.\nBut then he suddenly felt something on the top of his head and slightly tilted it to the side, glancing towards Tavatron and satisfied that it was just she.\nHe listened to her words with a grunt of amusement.*\n\n� No? Really?�\n\n*It was then that he gathered his weight and strength beneath himself and quickly leaped onto the first of the great roots, wood chips and splinters spraying out from the sheer force of his landing.\nQuickly gathering his barring he pinpointed the swamp to be no more then half a mile from his position, easily reached within the next five clicks�providing that he could keep from engaging the enemy.\nBut as he�d promised earlier, they were going to have fun with this�and he was looking forward to it!\nDinobot narrowed his eyes at the surrounding trees, noting that this would be a very good spot to begin a little test.\nHe looked back towards Tavatron with a wicked grin and just as wicked a glint in his eyes. *\n\n� I would say that it was time we put our pursuers tracking abilities to the test, wouldn�t you agree?�\n\n* With that he then turned back towards the forest and gathered his strength again, simply leaping onto the next large root. But doing this would be easily traceable, a good thing that he wasn�t going to do this all the way to the swamp.\nDinobot took in a deep breath, and flexed his back claws. From this stage forward he was going to be in constant and quick motion, at least until he reached the halfway point towards the swamp. There another ploy would be set.\nHe crouched down a bit, shifting his weight from one foot to the other for a moment. *\n\n� I suggest you hold tightly. This is where the REAL fun begins.�\n\n* Having given his warning he then leaped onto the next of the great root, yet, instead of leaping onto the next he leapt onto the side of one tree and propelled himself towards the next trunk.\nIn steady and smooth motion he simply leapt from one tree trunk to the next, propelling himself from their sides to reach the next in a criss-cross action.\nHowever, in order to leave no marks he refrained from digging his hind claws into the bark, making it vital that he stayed in constant motion or fall to the forest floor�taking Tavatron with him.\nHis breath was beginning to speed up as he continued this action; just hoping that Tavatron would be able to hold on tight enough.\nThis was all new to him, never pulling a stunt like this before�and hoping that Tavatron wouldn�t beat him for it when it was all over.\nBut he had the hyperactive power in his very muscles and this was a great way to put it to good use, plenty of time to rest when they had reached the half waypoint.\nAnd if Tavatron did not find hopping from the side of one tree and having the greatest chance of falling if he so much as slowed a notch thrilling, then she might be able to make up for the loss of excitement when they reached the next point in their journey. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
