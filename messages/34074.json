He&#39;s the mind of the Element, so when \nJen says that he&#39;s firing, its the base defences firing at you, so \nshe&#39;s allright there. As for not taking damage, we&#39;ll get her if she \nkeeps doing it.\n\nNow, secondly, my fellow council members already took care of this, \nbut KSL and Soulstice, quit it. If there&#39;s another argument like that \ninvolving you guys over the RPG, teeeerrrriiibllle things will happen.\n\nThirdly, about the shockwaves: no, shockwaves from missiles are ok. \nThat rule outlaws shockwaves like the ones Vehement fires, \nShockwave&#39;s x-ray blast, and the Element&#39;s shockwaves.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt;  &lt;&lt;Cyndro focused his firepower on the attackers. Three missiles \n&gt; launched out at Sixshot, and three at Ares, followed by alot of \nplasma shots \n&gt; at both. He also fired four missiles at Imprisoner.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; An aiming ten missiles shot from one of Jen&#39;s characters...utterly \namazing.  \n&gt; Also, the fact that only a few of my shots that I fired upon her \nhit only a \n&gt; single character :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Resisting urge to fight fire with fire.\n\n\n"}}
