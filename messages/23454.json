The protoform continued to grow and gain the shape of a dragon. \nSuddenly it became solid and a flash of energy surged through the \nlab. The labs computer systems flashed like the start of a \nthunderstorm as an increbably large object took shape in the middle \nof the room.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve done it, he&#39;s alive, Alive&quot; (Sorry I couldn&#39;t help myself) The \nscientist had done it. The dragon was the biggest thing he&#39;d seen \nsince the old Autobots and Decepticons roamed cybertron. &quot;Shut down \nthe system before it explodes.&quot; He shouted to be heard over the \ncrackling energy around them.\n\nThe computer was shut down and the room came to a sudden calm. &quot;It&#39;s \nhuge were the only words to escape the lips of Veratis&#39; young \nassistant.\n\nThe dragon growled and lowered it&#39;s head. &quot;Who are you to stand \nbefore my greatness?&quot; it&#39;s booming voice echoed through the dark lab \nending the previous lull of silence.\n\n&quot;I am Veratis, your creator, and this is Foxfingers. Welcome to this \nworld.&quot; The scientists idea was that the Maximal attitudes would give \nthe creature a sense of purpose, he could now tell that he was wrong.\n\n&quot;You say you created me?&quot; the Dragon looked back and fourth at the \ntwo mouthfulls in front of it, it wasn&#39;t impressed. The dragon \ntransformed and now a large T rex stood looking down on them. &quot;In \nthat case You both can live.&quot; his eyes rolled down at the seemingly \ntiny scientist, &quot;I suppose I owe you that much.&quot;\n\nHe turned and started toward the door pausing to duck a little before \nopening his mouth and launching a beam of concentrated energy at it. \nThe energy struck the door freezing it into a brittle state. &quot;I owed \nyou my life, as long as you don&#39;t interfere in it I&#39;ll consider \nmyself in your debt, I&#39;m letting you live, consider it payed.&quot; The \nmighty beast spun around, smashing the door to tiny splinters. He \nwalked out giving his word. &quot;You have the word of Megaton.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
