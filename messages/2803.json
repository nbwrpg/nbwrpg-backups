He grins. The earthquake should interfere with the autogun&#39;s aiming \nsystems, allowing him to escape.\n\nHe turns around to see the damage he had done, and instead sees a giant \ncreature stampeding at him.\n\n&quot;Holy SLAG!!!&quot; he yells, spinning around to try and run, the shaking ground \nmaking it dificult. He runs away from the creature, firing blindly behind him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker and Prowl jump out of the exit of the Ark, Striker instantly aiming \nhis gun at Zenyak. His eyes narrow as he carefully takes aim, trying not to \nhis Iron Raptor.\n\nStriker&#39;s eyes widen as Prowl&#39;s hand covers the end of his rifle right before \nhe shoots.\n\n&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Striker yells as pieces of Prowl&#39;s land in an area \nseveral feet in front of them.\n\n&quot;You could have hit her,&quot; Prowl says trough clenched teeth, one hand holding \nthe stump left of the other.\n\nStriker growls. &quot;I should have taken Sniper along. How did Zenyak even get \nhere in the first place?&quot;\n\n&quot;Me and Iron Raptor picked him up a while back,&quot; Prowl answers, taking his \ngun in his good hand and heading out toward Zenyak and Iron Raptor.\n\nStriker&#39;s hand on his shoulder stops him. &quot;You could have hit her,&quot; Striker \nsays, mimicing Prowl&#39;s worried tone, &quot;She can take care of it, Prowl. Right \nnow I want to know how Zenyak ended up in front of the Ark instead of in a \nholding cell.&quot;\n\nProwl blushes. &quot;I was ... distracted,&quot; he says, looking at Striker to see his \nreaction.\n\nStriker&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;You are the last person I&#39;d expect to do that. Ok, go \nget that hand healed,&quot; Striker says in a disapointed tone.\n\nProwl shakes his head. &quot;I&#39;m fine. I can get repaired later,&quot; he says and sets \noff once again toward Iron Raptor, but stops when he feels Striker&#39;s rifle \npress against the back of his head.\n\n&quot;Go to a CR chamber, or I&#39;ll end up having to drag you to one,&quot; Striker says \nthrough clenched teeth in a very mad voice.\n\nProwl&#39;s shoulders slump in defeat. &quot;All right, I&#39;m going,&quot; he says, setting \noff towards the CR chamber.\n\nStriker nods. &quot;Good.&quot; He says and runs off toward Iron Raptor. If she didn&#39;t \ndevour Zenyak by the time he got there, maybe he could salvage some of the \npredacon for questioning.\n\n"}}
