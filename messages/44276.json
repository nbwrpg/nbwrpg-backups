Then, he w=\r\nent forward, and a bunch of saws and stuff came down!  They started cutting=\r\n at Decapitron.  All he could do was scream in sheer pain.  Each saw blade =\r\nhad the Autobot symbol engraved on it.  Decapitron, still tied onto the con=\r\nveyer belt, was now heading into a large box thing.  On the way, a heavy th=\r\ning with an Autobot symbol came down and sort of crushed Decapitron&#39;s head.=\r\n  Then, Decapitron went into the box thing, which also had an Autobot symbo=\r\nl, and then the doors of the box shut, and then Decapitron was stuck, and h=\r\ne was getting beaten and battered.  After the 10 minute torture process was=\r\n done in the box, Decapitron kept going.  Mechfluid and oil and stuff were =\r\npouring like mad, and he was mangled and dislocated and stuff.  Finally, he=\r\n was at the end, and was dumped off of the conveyer belt and onto the groun=\r\nd.  The last thing he had seen back then when that happened, was Autobots a=\r\nround him, laughing sinisterly with evil eyes and faces.  \n        *Flashba=\r\nck Ends*\n\n        Surgital was still...\n\n\n        Your use of Yahoo!
