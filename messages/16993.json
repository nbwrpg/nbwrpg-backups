The new breed of Predacons will not forget your\n&gt; generosity, and will pay you back once the Maximals and Megatron are\n&gt; out of the way.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turned to the Lavacons.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I am Starscream, former ruler of the Decepticons and member of the\n&gt; newest faction of Predacons, commanded under KitKat. Please hold on\n&gt; one minute while I contact my group and than we will go.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He sent a comm:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. Zardus isn&#39;t letting us take the\n&gt; Oblitercons, but he&#39;s letting us use the Lavacons, a group that by\n&gt; the looks of things is stronger than the Oblitercons. We are about to\n&gt; leave now, but we need your co-ordinates.&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois noticed that the firing had stopped. It was either they gave\n&gt; up on firing or are entering the mountain. It would be foolish to do\n&gt; so, but better think the foolish thing when dealing with fools.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;One of you three, stay in the back and wipe away our tracks. When we\n&gt; get to the main base their are 4 more warriors waiting. We&#39;ll get\n&gt; them and than attack this enemy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He kept walking.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt;\n&gt; Prebon frowned.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Too bad....I was hoping for you to tell me everything you knew about\n&gt; your past life. It might help us know the secrets of our enemy\n&gt; better.&quot; He saw Spears emerge from the CR Chamber.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Spears! Great! Looks like we can take everyone to battle after all.\n&gt; I&#39;d like you to meet Slayer, our new Trainer. He is the protoform of\n&gt; your friend....&quot; Than Prebon eralized something. He needed to stop\n&gt; talking about the past. Slayer did not have a chip, meaning that even\n&gt; though he was loyal now, the future could change. If Slayer got\n&gt; curious, he might sneak away to the Maximals. They would reveal his\n&gt; old personality and when tell all Trainer secrets.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Never mind who he is. No one will ever talk of the past again.\n&gt; Understand? Good. Spears, I really have no mission right now. Soon we\n&gt; will go into battle. We will gang up on Ramulus and kill him. Right\n&gt; now though, Slayer, come with me. I want you try on a War Suit that\n&gt; will help you fight.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Prebon started walking down to the cargo area.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
