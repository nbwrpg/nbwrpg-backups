He nods at Lunarpine as a \nway of greeting, looking down at the device Spears had given him. He presses \na button, a hologram of the Ark appearing.\n\nStriker looks at Tranquility. &quot;I think I&#39;m in charge at the moment,&quot; he says, \nturning to the others.\n\n&quot;Allright, we need to build a complete replica of the Ark,&quot; he pauses as \nanother panel falls from the cealing, &quot;This one is dying. Blue Stinger hid \nthe Autobots somewhere a long time ago, so a planetary scan will be needed to \nfind them. We can use the pieces from the Keepers&#39; ships, and spare parts \nfrom other wrecks to build it.&quot;\n\n"}}
