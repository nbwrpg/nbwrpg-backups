Explobody also covered his eyes.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;That coward!  He&#39;s getting away!&quot; Gutclaw hissed.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Explobody transformed into his mechanical bird mode, and flew \nup, blinded by the light.  From the launchers under his wings, he \nfired two missiles at Angel Prime, barely able to aim them good.  \nGutclaw continued to cover his eyes in pain.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;      Decapitron went to where Motormaster was, and Legtrap and \nHeadshot followed.  However, they heard the emergency alarm, and were \ninformed of an escaping prisoner.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;We&#39;ll get &#39;im!!&quot; Decapitron, Legtrap and Headshot all said at \nthe same time.\n&gt; \n&gt;      The three ran out instantly, and saw in the distance \nSwitchblade(I think) chasing Condor.  The prisoner, Condor, was about \nto leave the area.  \n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Quick, let&#39;s follow him!&quot; Decapitron said, transforming into \ncar mode, a sleek, black viper, and speeding off towards Condor.  \n&gt; \n&gt;       Legtrap quickly jumped inside of Decapitron.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Let&#39;s catch up, then I can trap the prisoner with one of my \ntraps!&quot; He said.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Headshot jumped into Decapitron as well, sitting in the \npassenger seat.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Ya, and I can also attempt to snipe him down, with a well-\naimed shot, very well aimed, to the head,&quot; He said.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Decapitron speeded off in car mode, to try and catch up to \nCondor.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;        Skullgrin was blinded by the light.  He transformed into \ntank mode, and fired two shrapnel blasts up in the air, hoping to hit \nAngel Prime.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;       Triggerhappy was blinded, but he transformed into jet mode, \nand flew up, then fired 2 photon cannon blasts at Angel Prime, \nalthough he couldn&#39;t see well.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;       Symphony went back inside the CF.  He walked around, then \nwent into the control room.  He looked around.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Hmm,&quot; He said.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Symphony sat down, then he fell asleep, his head mashing a \nscreen(or two) and some buttons.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;        Orchestra couldn&#39;t fight.  He wasn&#39;t motivated enough.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;I&#39;m outta here,&quot; He muttered to himself, flying off full \nspeed to the BlackFortress.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Once he arrived, he landed and went inside.  The first thing \nhe wanted to know, was if Blacknightmare was still here.  He walked \naround, then he decided to send a message to Blacknightmare&#39;s comlink.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;Blacknightmare, this is Orchestra, I&#39;m back from battle, I \nthink Darkfate went somewhere,&quot; He said.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;       Composer was bored.  He wanted to do something.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Hey, Wheeljack, anything on those weapons?  Hows about we \nspeak to Zardus?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
