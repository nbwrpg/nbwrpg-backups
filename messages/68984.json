Again, sorry for the wait.  I work ALL day \n&gt;&gt; on Friday and Saturdays.  \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Shard will continue firing on the ship unless someone attacks him, in \n&gt;&gt; which case, he&#39;ll turn his rockets on them. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m really itching for this battle to be over and for us to be able to \n&gt;&gt; get some character interaction in, so feel free to just have Shard do \n&gt;&gt; as I mentioned and wrap things up. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; As for what my characters know, I&#39;m thinking that them not knowing \n&gt;&gt; anything or anyone might be easiest, but I&#39;ll see how it goes.  What \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve indicated that they know has to do with their recent history \n&gt;&gt; before they ended up in stasis ect. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;      \n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
