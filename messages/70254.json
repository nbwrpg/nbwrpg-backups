You and Nightlight were the only friends that I had...&quot;he sighed&quot;The\n&gt; kid was right, I&#39;m aging&quot;\n\nRodimus nodded, sadness mixed with resigned resolution crossing his\nface. He orients his weapon again, trying to find a shot that wouldn&#39;t\nkill him but would look good when the sound of falling earth could be\nheard echoing from down the tunnel, and the distinct sound of drilling\nerupted into the hall for a moment and then grinds to a stop.\n\nRodimus turned his weapon to face this new threat as Cyclonus and\nJhiaxus step from the hole in the wall, one obviously made by\nSkorponok who was still in Scorpion mode. Scourge stepped out as well,\nand like the others his weapons drawn.\n\n&quot;Well Well&quot; Jhiaxus said as he stepped clearly into the tunnel, &quot;It\nwould seem we have found Perceptor after all Cyclonus.&quot; Jhiaxus said,\nhis face was cold as he spoke, yet with a hint of some dark humor,\n&quot;Consorting with the enemy are we?&quot; his voice was confident, almost\nsmug. &quot;That is most unfortunate.&quot;\n\nUnknown to most, while Jhiaxus was talking, Cyclonus was transmitting\nthis to Hydras, making sure he heard it all.\n\n&quot;GO!&quot; Rodimus said fiercly to Tuscon and Perceptor, &quot;Its too late for\nanything else now. &quot;I will hold them so you can get away! Get\nNightlight and Windlord out of here! This is my mess, and I will\nfinish it! GO!&quot;\n\nRodimus turned to face the slowly advancing Decepticons.\n\n(TAG)\n\n(OOC: I have a few plans for Rodimus, but feel free to stay or go as\nyou folks see fit)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
