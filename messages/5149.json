Opening the \ndoor the Magmatron&#39;s officehe wasn&#39;t there.\n    &quot;Magmatron, this is CyberShark, what is your location.&quot;\n    &quot;I&#39;m on my way in, but first I need to go back and yell at the fool \nBobertron for what he did.&quot;\n    &quot;Have you found any trace of the bots yet?&quot;\n    &quot;You can go and look, because I&#39;ve been busy.&quot;\n    He went into the Communications room and looked at the screen. He saw the \nreadouts.\n    &quot;It seems that Terminess has been destroyed, but it seems that Vulois is \nstill alive. He is no where near the Predacon base either. Would you like me \nto take you there?&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n::Magmatron::\n\n    Flying back to Cheetor he found Bobertron.\n    &quot;Bobertron!! What are you doing?&quot; Magmatron asked, he was not very \npleased. &quot;The Maximals will find him I am assured of it, but don&#39;t you think \nit would be a little suspisious if a Predacon gave them Cheetor? You didn&#39;t \neven finish the Destron Process, you are still Predacon. Return to base and \nlet the Maximals find their &#39;comrade&#39;.&quot;\n\n"}}
