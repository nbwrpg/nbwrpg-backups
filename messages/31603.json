He feels a few rapid-fire shots hit\nhim, but his focus right now was Fireblade, although he wasn&#39;t going\nto swoop down again.\n\nTaking out his old acid pellet gun, he fires four pellets down at the\nDecepticon. He hoped that Fireblade would try to deflect them with his\nsword, as they would release the acid on contact, and would eat\nthrough alot of metal if neccessary.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; ::FireBlade::\n&gt; \n&gt; FireBlade smiles as the missiles fall to the ground....And an even\n&gt; larger grin comes over him as Prowl flies towards him. He deflects\n&gt; three of the laser blasts with his Blade but on knicks his other\narm.\n&gt; He growls and fires 10 more PowerSurge shots from his rifle at the\n&gt; incoming Prowl still continuing to run for the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; He was now within 100 m of it.\n\n\n"}}
