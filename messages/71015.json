He didn&#39;t know what he would meet at the other end,=\r\n yet, right now, getting out was the only thing on his mind.\n\n&quot;Gotta get ou=\r\nta here, gotta get outa here!  I am sooooo outa here!&quot;\n\nHe rambles on as he=\r\n scampers quickly to saftey.\n\nOutside the Ark, Night Shift and Straight Sho=\r\nt quickly help Noctorro, by assisting in moving Tucson, who was quite large=\r\nr than they were. Yet, despite their help, Tucson, being as determined as h=\r\ne was, despite his bad condition, slowly resists their help, and manages to=\r\n get on one knee, with one foot on the ground.  Night Shift looks at him as=\r\n does Straight Shot.\n\n&quot; Woah, easy Tucson, easy.  Haven&#39;t ya noticed?  You&#39;=\r\nre losn&#39; a lotta battery fluid real fast. That aint just a scratch on your =\r\narm buddy.&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n\n&quot;I - do not wish to burden anyone.  I - started=\r\n this, and I feel that I should help finish what I began.  I - can not expe=\r\nct anyone to risk their lives on - my account.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot eyes him.\n\n&quot;=\r\n Tucson, we&#39;re helping you because we want to.  And right now you can use a=\r\nll the help you can get.  Look, what would Talon do without ya?  Ya can&#39;t l=\r\net her down, ya gotta preserve what life ya got, because when this is all o=\r\nver, you two are going to have something wonderful ta share in the future. =\r\n Ya wanna live ta see that right?&quot;\n\nHe nodds.\n\n&quot;And indeed, I - will.&quot;\n\nStr=\r\naight Shot eyes him deeper.\n\n&quot;And now, you are gonna let Noctorro and us he=\r\nlp ya, by getting you ta saftey so you can get that arm repaired and replac=\r\ne the battery fluid you lost on the battle field.  Plus, we gotta move outa=\r\n here real fast, because something big is gonna happen real soon.&quot;\n\nTucson =\r\nnodds.\n\n&quot; All right.  Let&#39;s - regroup, as Noctorro has advised.&quot;\n\nAs he tri=\r\nes to stand up, he finds his condition too far advanced, as he falls to his=\r\n knees once more, unable to get up on his own.  He finds just enough energy=\r\n to get into vehicle mode, seeing that this way, at least he could be towwe=\r\nd to saftey, rolling on wheels rather than being dragged, which would be di=\r\nfficult to do otherwise.\n\n&quot; Here- in - this mode, it will - be easier for m=\r\ne - to ambulate.&quot;\n\nAt the Ark, Uproar and Quickstride nodd in compliance.  =\r\nThey were ready for the challenge.  They transform into their robot modes a=\r\ns Uproar begins to sharpen his claws, while Quickstride cracks his knuckles=\r\n.  The young cat now bares an enthusiastic look on his face.\n\n&quot; All right, =\r\nI&#39;m ready ta do this sir.  No matter what happens, there&#39;s no turning tail.=\r\n&quot;\n\nQuickstride also nodds.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right, no turning tail.

At the same time Injector, transforming in=\r\nto something\n&gt; that looked to be a cross between a lionfish and a hornet. H=\r\nis wings buzzing\n&gt; menecingly as they held him in the air. With a strange i=\r\nnsectil grin he his\n&gt; back end directed itself at Talon, an end that ended =\r\nwith barbed tip stinger\n&gt; missile.

I =\r\ncan see his\n&gt; programming all over this.&quot; Cyclonus paused again and then co=\r\nntinued, &quot;I am\n&gt; trying to stop it, but it looks like that is something Per=\r\nceptor had had\n&gt; time to plant carefully.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile as Cyclonus is ta=\r\nlking to Hydras . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;THOOM!!&lt;&lt;    &gt;&gt;THOOM!!&lt;&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The sounds of ca=\r\nnnon fire can be heard as the large forms of Silverbolt,\n&gt; Airhammer, Torca=\r\n, Bantor, and Noctorro the Maximal Fuzors leap up and begin\n&gt; firing at the=\r\n Predacons, Noctorro actually firing at Hydras hoping to\n&gt; distract him so =\r\nthat Tuscon can be pulled to safety!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Get Tuscon out of there!&quot; Noctor=\r\nro said, his deep voice booming across the\n&gt; battlefield. &quot;We are going to =\r\nhave to back up and regroup, there are too\n&gt; many of them to stand out here=\r\n in the open!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; AT THE ARK\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside the Ark, Uproar=\r\n and Quickstride continue to stick close to Rodimus\n&gt; and the others and no=\r\ndd as they look to each other.

Maybe it&#39;s bet=\r\nter if we wait it out a little bit.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride grins too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Yeah, true, if we wait it out, then we got a better chance at getting in\n=\r\n&gt; safely, and effectively..
