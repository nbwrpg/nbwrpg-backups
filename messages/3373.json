The hatch opens and he crawls out into the world. He has the memories of the DNA he scaned, an Anklosaurus. He knows he must get to a base, because he is in unfimaliar territory. \n   &quot;No command codes yet. I can&#39;t Transform.&quot; He mutters to himself. &quot;No matter, i will have them soon enough.&quot; \n   Nothing stops him in his seemingly mad persuit. Even the land slide didn&#39;t slow him down, just hurt his skin.\n   Eventually he reached a base. He marched in. It was the Predacon base.\n\n"}}
