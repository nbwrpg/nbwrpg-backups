He looks at Megatron, raising an eyebrow.\n\n&quot;Why would I want revenge from you?&quot; he asks, his wrist beam-emmiters \nlaunching four beams which raced toward Megatron. On impact, each \nbeam would create an energy explosion slightly larger than a grenade.\n\n&quot;There is only one bot who I want revenge against, and I don&#39;t think \nhe&#39;s even on this planet.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer raises his arms, blasts from Tankorr hitting the armor. \nHis shoulder missile launcbers fire more missiles at Tankorr.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther rolls out of the way of the shots aimed at his face. \nDarkmouse squeels as one of the shots hits her instead.\n\nScyther fires more charges down at Akron.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven keeps firing at Tarantulus.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGoldeneye is hit by Putam&#39;s fist, sending her flying down toward the \nground.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemiss enters the CR chambers, the healing proccess beginning.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Megatron cruises to the scene, behinde him are Marine, \nPheniox, \n&gt; Jackle, Gremlin, and Megaton. He see&#39;s the attack...and the \nEnergonians.\n&gt;        &quot;Ominous Prime? He&#39;s returned? This is a rather interesting \nturn of \n&gt; events, yes.&quot; Megatron says, as he picks up speed to get a shot at \nKillfest.\n&gt;        He see&#39;s him throw Aerostreak as if he were a toy...and then \nblast him \n&gt; with two missles. Megatron brought his dino-arm shoulder blasters \nonline, and \n&gt; fired at Killfest. &quot;If you want revenge, Killfest, I suggest you \nget it while \n&gt; you can! Yes!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tankkor drives as the two missle burst behinde him, sending \nhim \n&gt; stumbling forward a bit. He turns to see the reinforcements have \narrived. At \n&gt; least it brings a little relief. He raises his arm back at \nEndbringer, and \n&gt; begins to shoot off plasma blast after plasma blast at him.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Akron is sent flying backward from the shot, but quickly \ngets up as \n&gt; the energy from the shot rushes through her body like a jolt of \nenergy. &quot;Come \n&gt; on, big boy. Lets get tough!&quot; She says, and, taking out her energon \nriffle, \n&gt; begins to fire off shots at his face.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Putnam is hit by Goldeneye, but flies up above her and kicks \nhard. \n&gt; &quot;Give me the vermine! I swear youre going to regreat this....&quot; He \nsays, and \n&gt; brandishes a glowing blue fist at the bird.\n\n\n"}}
