Your the only friend I have!\n&gt;\n&gt; Dracona: Correction, I was the only friend you had!\n&gt;\n&gt; Artist was dragged around and beaten. Plintissa ran to him. Dracona\nlaughed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dracona: Finish him, rip his spark out a bring it to me!\n&gt;\n&gt; Stranato: What? You crazy or something?\n&gt;\n&gt; Dracona: No! Bring his spark to me!\n&gt;\n&gt; Stranato: I tried to kill before, I failed, I don&#39;t want to actually kill\n&gt; someone!\n&gt;\n&gt; Dracona: Fool! Sinesis, Sinister, reprogram them!\n&gt;\n&gt; OCC: Stranato&#39;s good guy turn came from what I heard in wrestling, they\nsay\n&gt; they are going to turn Kurt Angle, American Hero, into a babyface\nwrestler!\n&gt; Shocking, but it&#39;s true! It&#39;s true!\n&gt;\n&gt; Sinesis and Sinister walk up to Stranato with the reprogram device.\nSomeone\n&gt; taps Sinister on the shoulder. He turns around. BAM! Stronghold&#39;s fist\n&gt; connects with Sinister&#39;s face! Sinesis pulls out his blaster, but Blender\n&gt; grabs it and rips it from his hand, taking his hand with it! Sinister is\n&gt; grabbed by Train Wreck. Train Wreck lifts him up and Powerbomb&#39;s him\nthrough\n&gt; a tree. Airbomber jumps from the top of a tree and lands on Dracona,\n&gt; knocking her over. Dracona and Airbomber exchange punches. Sinesis is\n&gt; whipped into a tree by Stronghold. Stronghold grabs Siensis by the legs\nand\n&gt; lifts him up. Blender jumps up and grabs Sinesis&#39; neck, 3D!!! Blender\nraised\n&gt; his hands up in a sign for the Diamond Cutter. Stronghold smashed Sinister\n&gt; through another tree with a Diving shoulder block. Blender hits a Diamond\n&gt; Cutter on Sinesis. Arrow slices off a tree limb and Sinesis is pinned\nunder\n&gt; it. Stranato charges Sinister and grabs him, hitting a ferocious Olympic\n&gt; Slam on Sinister. Dracona shoves Airbomber away finally and looks at\nSinesis\n&gt; and Sinister, just laying there...\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Iron Raptor&quot; &lt;ironraptor13@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 24, 2000 10:41 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: The Rescue\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * Iron Raptor sighed and rolled her optics in frustration, but she knew\nto\n&gt; that Prowl loved her and was thinking of her safety.\n&gt; &gt; Some how knowing that she was thinking of running off in a completely\n&gt; different direction that they did, fixing it so that her own signature\nwould\n&gt; seem like all four of them while she made sure that the other three\n&gt; signatures weren&#39;t able to be detected. The sensor ghosts disappearing so\n&gt; that they would only detect her.\n&gt; &gt; Though, since she wasn&#39;t going to exit with the others, she was going to\n&gt; exit through the front door.\n&gt; &gt; With a second sigh she then fixes him with a determined and stern stare,\n&gt; hoping that he would listen to her then despite what doubts he had in his\n&gt; spark.*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; PROWL!
