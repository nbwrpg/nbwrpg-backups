Yet knowing that the Alliance bot knew that if he acted he would be down and out before he knew what hit him, a factor in which he was not looking forward to.\nHe continued to glare at him while Prowl proceeded in convincing him of his plan, in which Dinobot was beginning to realize was not all that bad�especially if it was convincing the Alliance. Listening carefully he waited to see the reactions of the enemy bots before him, their every move, every breath.\nHe was not surprised when Reptilica finally succumb to common sense, telling his own bots to stand down and let them pass. In which they did not yield, causing the tension in the room to rise and his senses tingle with it.\nStill keeping his optics on the enemy Dinobot watched the two fembots uncloak, Tavatron uncloaking a little closer to him then he remembered her last position. But her presence did not draw his attention away from the task at hand, getting them all out of there alive.\nThen watching the Alliance begin to back out of the room a sudden wave of disappointment passed over him, he had looked forward to the slaging of another enemy bot�but it looked as if it was not to be. His claws would not be dripping with the mech fluid of another this day, not this day.\nDinobot watched as Prowl begin to move out of the room with his finger over the decoy detonator, the enemy moving out of the way as he passed. Then their Third in Command followed.\nWith a snarl he simply stood there and watched the two Maximals enter the hall, waiting for Tavatron to pick herself up and moved after them. He knew that this was all too easy and expected an attack at any moment, knowing for a fact that the only bot he trusted was right beside him. Others had to earn his trust; it was not given freely. Tavatron had earned it well enough.\nHe listened to Tavatron�s soft growl as she stood a foot or so away from him, wondering if she was this as a bit too convenient as well. Then sheathed her sword and began to move towards the exit, looking back towards him and motioning for him to follow.\nHis optics glared at the Alliance bots beyond the door but there was no hope in the Pit he was going to let Tavatron walk among them without somebot to watch her back. It did not seem right in the first place that they were just let go like that, an attack could be clearly anticipated from this point on.\nWith no spoken words Dinobot followed up after Tavatron, falling into place a foot behind her.\nThere was no telling what the Alliance could do from here, charging his optic laser guide as a precaution.\nThe urge to simply reach out and slag an Alliance bot was beginning to come over him as he moved into the hall and passed them, just thinking of how he would have the satisfactory sound of a screaming bot in his clutches as he ran him through with his claws. However, he knew that in order to exit this structure unharmed he would be required to restrain from slaging anything. But if a battle arose he would be the first to get his claws bloody.\nDinobot kept his optics from the enemy as he passed, simply looking down at Tavatron from time to time to assure that she was not damaged in any way that could render an easy target for an attack.\nYet, she appeared fine, no more then a few bruises and scratches. Nothing that would prevent a warrior from enjoying the thrill of battle.\nThe looking over her head he fixed his optics on the areas ahead, keeping just a step behind Tavatron. His tail swinging behind to ensure that there would be no sudden surprises from his blind side, one could never know what to expect in the ship on an enemy. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
