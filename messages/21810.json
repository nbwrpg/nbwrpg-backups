He never seen so much affection from her. But be might as well \ngo along with it. He missed her when she left the Predacons those \nlong days ago. Was he ever so sore about it. They were back together \nnow and it looked like it was for keeps.\n\nHe grabbed Black Arachnia around her shoulders firmly, but not hard. \nRespect was needed. \n\n&quot;Sugar-bot, ya gotta tell me what&#39;s goin&#39; on. Ya got uh plan wit&#39; \nMegatron an&#39; Hell Beast? Ah mean, ya really can&#39;t be on their side, \nright? Ah can&#39;t stand both of &#39;em. Megatron maybe uh little, but Hell \nBeast? No way. What&#39;s yer plan? Ah&#39;m bein&#39; left out in th&#39; dark here, \nan&#39; ah&#39;m second in command.&quot; He raised his brows at her to let her \nknow about his seriousness of it. His main expressions were in his \noptics. &quot;An&#39; why&#39;s KitKat actin&#39; all high an&#39; mighty?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
