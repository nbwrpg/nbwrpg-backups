He half-smiled for a moment, then came back to\nreality. This =\r\nhad to go smoothly. He started to speak.\n\nJotunn: My loyal Iron Skull fello=\r\nws, I thank you for being so many to\nhear me out today. While the reason of=\r\n my speech to you may be a\nthundering shock to some of you, I expect noneth=\r\neless strict adherence\nto my orders and the uttermost compliance from your =\r\npart.\n\nHe let a few nanoclicks pass before going on.\n\nJotunn: You all know =\r\nthat the Minion have done us terrible wrongs in\nthe past. They have wrecked=\r\n our power stations, our training\nfacilities, and sometimes even our homes.=\r\n They have killed our peers\nand our families. And the worst thing is that w=\r\ne have not been able to\nthwart their efforts effectively. They could attack=\r\n anytime now, and\nwould not meet with more resistance than before. What I s=\r\nay to you, my\nfollowers, is that we Predacons have been held back from bein=\r\ng useful.\n\nAnother Pause. This part would be tricky.\n\nJotunn: Yes, the gove=\r\nrnmental Army has failed defending us properly\nbecause it has not acknowled=\r\nged what we know is true, that we must\nmeet the Unicronians with all the mi=\r\nght we have in our hands, and all\nthe weapons we can carry. We must destroy=\r\n them. The way it turns out,\nhowever, is that we were not alone in taking t=\r\nhe decisions. The\nBushidos avoid to side themselves with us from fear of ec=\r\nonomic\nreprisals. The Silver Wings, in their oh-so-great pride, think we wa=\r\nnt\nto slay them to the last the way our ancestors did. The Pacificus\nshake =\r\nat the idea of holding a gun. And the Watchers, well, they are\nas they alwa=\r\nys have been. I say that this must change.\n\nGood, almost done.\n\nJotunn: Her=\r\ne are my orders. As of now, the Iron Skulls become the\nruling members of Go=\r\nvernment with me as their leader. The other\nfactions are not to be harmed u=\r\nnless they attack first. Avoid all\ngunfight, brawl, or battle that are avoi=\r\ndable. Now I know that some of\nthem will not understand and still fight us.=\r\n You have all the rights\nto defends yourselves. I want as few casualities o=\r\nn their side as\npossible. Take prisoners instead. To the soldiers in the ar=\r\nmy, I want\nyou to lock up any unit not loyal to me. While Bushidos and Watc=\r\nhers\nare to be negotiated with to take on our side, Maximals are not to be\n=\r\ngiven that opportunity. Once that is done, secure the Parliament in\nRelay a=\r\nnd defend it from any opposition. To anyone else, offer the\nLoyalist Army a=\r\nll the support you can. Remember, though: this is not a\ncivil war, it is a =\r\nway for us to defend everyone better from the\nMinions, especially if that i=\r\ns done against their will. Iron Skulls,\nyou have your orders. Execute them =\r\nfast and well. Predacons Forever!\n\nHe cut the line, and slooped. He wondere=\r\nd, once again, if that was how\nthe war between the Autobots and the Decepti=\r\ncons had started. He\nwished he had learned his history better, but slavery =\r\nhad not allowed\nhim to. Right now though, he hoped the Minions wouldn&#39;t att=\r\nack until\nhe was finished.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;warrioraz=\r\nure@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: I&#39;ll wait for any other players to reply to Jotun=\r\nn, if there are\n&gt; any.
