Wepons are drawn and tempers are short. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast yells above the comotion ::: Stop! All of you! We are allies \nand we must work together agianst the Newcomer-\n\n::: Ominous Prime took his only chance and nailed Hell Beast in the back of \nthe head with an energy bolt. Hell Beast fell to the ground limp. :::\n\n::: Marine, Gremlin, and Jackle spun around and began to unload rounds on \nSet, Ra, and Ominous who had taken cover behinde several boulders. With the \nway Marine was leveling off the rocks with a few placed missles, they wouldnt \nhave cover for long. :::\n\n::: Marine ::: You scum, you shoot men in the back because you are cowards!\n\n::: Gremlin, holding a large pulse laser assult riffle makes the rocks and \nnearby trees look like swiss cheese because he is shooting so much. Soon, \nsmoke fills the arena. :::\n\n::: Set ::: Damn it! We cant take on those three, there huge!\n\n::: Ra ::: I think its time to form Dark Messhia!\n\n::: Set ::: Yes! Do it! NOW!\n\n::: Ra, with a bright light glowing from his body leaps into the air and \nfloats there waiting for his commrads to combine together. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~`\n\n::: Transanulas screams in pain as Darkmouse bites into his leg. He points, \npulls the trigger, and a single shot digs itself into her shoulder. :::\n\n::: Transanulas ::: Damn you vermine! You will pay, and so wil lthe Ram!\n\n::: He begins to fire off random shots at Ramulus. :::\n\n"}}
