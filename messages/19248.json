She \nwondered if Megatron wold be willing to join as well.  She knew that \nhe had enough hatred to fule 10 wars against the maximals.\nShe got up and walked back to the entrance.  She stood in the door \nway of the base and opened her link, putting on a direct link so \nother may not over hear. &quot;Megatron. It&#39;s no secret that you don&#39;t \nlike me or that you&#39;d rather have my metal hide tacked up on the wall \nin your base.  But I have a proposal for you to think about before we \nmeet. I am putting together a predacon council.  A predacon council \nhere on earth.  I would like to ask you to concider the idea of being \nthe commander of your own group, but host a seat on this council.  If \nall the predacons unite, we can crush the maximals with one fearce \nblow instead of all these little battle.  You would lead along side \nwith me and other predacon leaders.  We would create a glorios HIGH \nPREDACON COUNCIL here on earth. Think about that untill I contact you \nlater on to notify you where we shall meet. KitKat out.&quot;\n\nShe closed her link and walked back into the base.  She thought about \nwhat she had just done. Megatron would make a better ally, than an \nenemy. She just hoped she could sway him over to her side.\n\n\n"}}
