She noticed that \nMagnus was still in the CR chamber(Correct me on this if I&#39;m wrong)\n\nShe decided to get her clone ready. She hooked up the wires to the \nhead of the clone and started to program the clone as she did with \nthe Megatron clone. Soon, it would be finished and she would have it \nwait in her quarters, next to the Megatron clone. She had the \nprograms set to the same headset that controled the Megatron clone. \n\nShe finished the clone and ordered the clone to her room. She sighed \nand sat down in the chair next to the Chamber that held Magnus. She \nwas scared.  She didn&#39;t know all of what the future would hold. But \nonething was really bothering her.  Gabriel said he had never heard \nof Drillbit. She was torn and her spark was crumbling. She sat in the \nchair, covered her face with her hands, and softly cried.\n\n\n\n"}}
