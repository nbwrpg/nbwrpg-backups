No one is around him \nChild and Windrazor are still a few minutes behind, so he calls back \nto them.\n\n&quot;Hey, hurry up! Come see this.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s strange a glittery. Vulois walks right up to it, and wants to \ntough it, but pulls himself back. Than an old voice talks to him.\n\nDo it Vulois. I didn&#39;t die to let this dream die.\n\nVulois recognized the voice:Soundwave. But he knew it wasn&#39;t really \nSoundwave. It was Convix, giving him extra encentive. But Convix \nknows best. Vulois took a few more steps, and stepped through the \nportal.\n\nWhen he came through, he couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. A familiar place, \nwith no sign of organic life.\n\n&quot;cybertron....&quot;he said to himself in a low voice,&quot;This is it....This \nis it!CYBERTRON!!!!!!&quot;\n\nVulois turned back and went through the portal, back to Past Earth. H \neyelled to Child and Windrazor.\n\n&quot;Come quick! You&#39;ll never believe what&#39;s over here!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
