When I reprogramed for firstime\n&gt; Nightlight it was very hard to do it but this second time, was relative\n&gt; easy. I think that the captivity was a factor to break her mind and her\n&gt; spirit... tell me when the program is done&quot;\n\nBump nodded, his red armored head bobbing up and down as he worked. &quot;I\nam almost finished.&quot; he said, as he and Legacy&#39;s code scrolled across\nthe screen.\n\nFor those who knew how to read code, it was the most elegant that had\never been written, but it is obvious that the two that were writing it\nhad great technical expertise. It looked as if the program were\ndesigned to give the victim a total memory wipe down to the core.\n\nThe tall bulky form of Santon stood behind Perceptor, his arms behind\nhis back. &quot;Tell me Perceptor.&quot; The Maximal doctor said as he watched\nboth the code and Perceptor, &quot;We are busy writing a program that would\ntotally erase the memories of anyone if implanted properly and deeply\nenough.&quot; Santon loked squarely at perceptor, &quot;What could you do with a\nprogram like that?&quot; It would seem that Santon was testing Perceptor in\nsome way, to see what his thoughts were about the casual use of such a\npotentially destrcutive program.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
