However the success is short lived as the group seems to seperate and swing out, like a school of fish, agile and swift to avoid the remainder of the attack. \nDividing almost in half they swing to the sides of the base, attempting to catch the base and the bots with it in some pincer movement. As they get closer myriads of red dots bath the ground and individual people, as they search for victims. Then with a disturbing singularity of purpose they open fire on the inhabitants below, Decepticon or Predicon, Maximal or Autobot, all seem to be fair game for these slayers as they rain death and destruction down on the base and the enviorns!\n(Tag everyone around the Black Fortress)\nPreston \n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
