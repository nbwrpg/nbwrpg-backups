Scorponok\nwas not the most agile of soldiers and so for a moment his optic\nsensors were full of a spectacular array of scintillating colors. The\nlarge Decepticon stepped back a pace as he braced his arms on the door\nframe, his massive bulk now fully in the middle of it rather than just\nin front of it.\n\n&quot;Cursed Autobot!&quot; he raged, his autocannons moving back and forth.\nThey appeared ready to fire, but without his optics to guide them they\nmoved aimlessly.\n\nScourge, who had up to this point had his own weapons lock on\nNightshift, stepped away from the wall and towards the center of the\nroom, although still out of immediate melee range. &quot;feisty&quot; he said as\na cold smile curled itself across his lips, &quot;that won&#39;t last long.&quot;\n\nScourge fired his stunner beams at Nightshift!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
