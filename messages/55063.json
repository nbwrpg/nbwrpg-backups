He \n&gt; &gt; recognized the voice from the past. Rodimus Prime: Can&#39;t say I&#39;m \nhappy to \n&gt; &gt; see you functioning. Now out of my way you Decepticon b*tch! \nMaxima&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; attack had a very big flaw. Although she managed to slice a bit \nof Rodimus&#39; \n&gt; &gt; hood, she failed to realize what a sports care going at speeds \nover 200mph \n&gt; &gt; would do. He simply plowed into her without careing in the least \nfor the \n&gt; &gt; Decepticon femme. This would surely cause some heavy damage to \nMaxima. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Knocked away from Windlord, as the hulking form of Rodimus throw \nher back \n&gt; quite a ways. Letting out a feline yelp/growl as her form slid & \nrolled away \n&gt; from the collision she sustained from Rodimus. \n&gt; \n&gt; Wincing, she growled. Yeah... it did cause damage ... that & it \nwas quite \n&gt; painful. Struggling to get up, she collapsed. Then attempted to \nget up \n&gt; again... her clear blue optics glared at Rodimus, through her \nteeth, she bit \n&gt; out, &quot;I&#39;m not that easy to put down... Auto-FOOL!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Despite something that Hydras told her some time ago, she \ndismissed it \n&gt; quickly. She was a Decepticon. She had continued to function this \nlong... \n&gt; there was NO way that this Autobot will take her down now. \n&gt; \n&gt; She stood partly up, & pulled out her tail, as it seperated into 2 \ncomponents \n&gt; - 2  energy swords. She threw them both at Rodimus. &quot;Ashes to \nashes.. \n&gt; Rodimus! Just like PRIME!&quot; One destroyed Leader for vengence for \nanother. It \n&gt; was still a very sour & sore spot to her... Megatron&#39;s demise.... \nbecoming \n&gt; Galvatron... the isolation... the torture... nothingness.... Yes, \nRodimus was \n&gt; a part of it, & she would make sure he would pay for it all.\n\n\n"}}
