He was \ngoing fast \n&gt; just from the plasma wounds. He was never going to catch this in \ntime. But he \n&gt; got an idea. he transformed and grabbed proto. Heemptied his plasma \ngun and \n&gt; poured Proto into it. he fired it and it flew into the shot. Proto \nglowed and \n&gt; formed a square metal object. His form of stasis lock. Destructor \npicked him \n&gt; up sending a comm to Megatron. &quot;I wish to request some energon to \nsave this \n&gt; bots life. he after all saved yours!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
