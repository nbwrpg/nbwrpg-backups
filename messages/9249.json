Outside \nhe can see he&#39;s passing over Ramulus, drudging along trying to meet \nthem. They smile as they reach the destination. The pod clands with a \nthud about 100 yards away from the stasis pod. They clinb out trying \nto get to his feet, and walks over to the pod. Octociz come up and \nchecks the circutry.\n\n&quot;Well, this thing will never fly again, but the DNA Scanners still \nwork. It will be awhile before Ramulus gets here. You don&#39;t know how \nto use this, so we have to wait for him to remove my spark.\n\nWhy don&#39;t we put my spark inside the machine. Then you could do it by \nyourself.\n\n&quot;No Brix. I enetred your body to cure you, not to steal it from you. \nBesides, when you&#39;re spark is vulnorable like that, we don&#39;t know \nwhat the DNA Scanner will do since you have a split personality. We \nwill wait.&quot;\n\nThey sit beside the pod, waiting for Ramulus.\n\nVulois\n\nVulois slaps hus hand against the conference table, muttering to \nhimself.\n\n&quot;Too many battles...too many deaths...I must act quickly.&quot;\n\nVulois sets up a transmission that will be sent directly into the \nhead of each leader.\n\n&quot;LISTEN UP! YOU KEEP FIGHTING, AND WHAT WILL IT DO FOR YOU? ONLY \nDEATH!!! THERE ARE EMISSARIES AT YOUR BASES. IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE \nTHE ONCOMING ARMAGEDDEN, YOU MUST TALK TO THEM NOW!!!!&quot;\n\nVulois sits back, wondering if he will ever be listened too.\n\n\n"}}
