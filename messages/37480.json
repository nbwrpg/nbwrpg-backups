Well, as long as everybody is okay with me taking my\n&gt; &gt; chars back, then my little &quot;meanwhile...&quot; story should be okay.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; IC:  Hell Drak and Necromancer entered the CF, after Quatro went\n&gt; &gt; in.  Necromancer wondered if Iron Raptor was still the leader, and\n&gt; &gt; what changes had gone by.  It seemed like much time had passed, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; if he knew how much time had really passed, he wouldn&#39;t be in so \nmuch\n&gt; &gt; wonder.  He decided to send a message to Iron Raptor through his \ncomm-\n&gt; &gt; link.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;Iron Raptor, this is Necromancer, I&#39;ve returned, and Hell\n&gt; &gt; Drak is with me,&quot; Necromancer said.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
