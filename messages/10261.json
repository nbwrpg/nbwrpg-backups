If the programming \nwas successfull (which is up to you to say, Logo), she would follow his every \ncommand, and serve the Alliance without fail. He had also programmed her to \nbe a bit promiscuous, but not a slut like DevilDuer had asked.\n\nHe taps his wrist comp, making sure the connection to the device he had \nimplanted, which would clear Feline&#39;s programming at his command, was secure.\n\nZardus picks up the antidote to Reptilica&#39;s venom, injecting it into Feline. \nHe sits back, waiting for her to wake up.\n\n"}}
