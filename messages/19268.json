She hooked up to the connection.  The\n&gt; &gt; protoform started shaking on the table.  The optics flickered and\n&gt; &gt; changed color.  Shadow Wing had finally found the connection that\n&gt; &gt; made her apart of the form.  Her spark was taking control of the\n&gt; &gt; form.  She started to feel the body of the form and felt away of it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; surroundings.  The form stopped moving and lay still.  The form went\n&gt; &gt; into a suspended animation mode.  Shadow Wing awoke, but the form was\n&gt; &gt; alseep.  She thought that she had to do something to communicate with\n&gt; &gt; Veratis.  Then she felt him, is thoughts.  She could hear his\n&gt; &gt; thoughts. She was scared but at the same time facinated by this.  She\n&gt; &gt; thought to him,&quot;Hey, can you hear me? I can hear you, kind of. What&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; going on? What happened?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
