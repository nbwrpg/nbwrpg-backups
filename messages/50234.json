I&#39;m a \nfree \n&gt; agent. Although I must say, I am glad that a maximal came to pick \nme \n&gt; up. I do truely dislike the Predacons. Now as for my ship, I think \n&gt; it&#39;s in good order, I doubt that she&#39;d fly again, but may be good \nfor \n&gt; spare parts. I have no need for it, so you may have it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;      He walked over to the ship to give it a once over, &quot;Although \nI \n&gt; don&#39;t think that we&#39;re going to be able to carry it. Perhaps you \n&gt; would get some help. My destress call was broadcast on a common \n&gt; channel. The Predacons might come to get me too. I don&#39;t want to \n&gt; fight right now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;   airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote: Nightlight::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m Nightlight, I&#39;m a maximal&quot;replied the femme while she shook \n&gt; her \n&gt; &gt; hands &quot;What&#39;s your group?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Lestat Lioncourt &lt;thevmprlestat2000@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: How does he look?
