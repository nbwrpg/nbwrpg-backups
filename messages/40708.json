I&#39;ll welcome you aboard when you meet the\nothers.\n\nOn the island of Spain the mutants searched frantically for a sigh pf thier\nlost collegues. Foxfingers stayed in beast mode sniffing around when he\nfound a scent that he hadn&#39;t smelled since he snuck into the pack base. He\nopened his comm setting it to switch frequencies every 5 seconds so he\ncouldn&#39;t be traced. &quot;Hey guys, I think it&#39;s time to leave.&quot; He knew that the\npreds scent meant that she was here. Since Lunarpine had caught a scent and\nlost it heading in the same direction then there was only one option. That\nSilver Scout had found her donor.\n\nLunarpine and Razor Claw heard the message and moved towards tyhe rendevous\npoint. Lunarpine knew her comm was inactive so he opened his thoughts. &quot;Time\nto go Wing.&quot; he called knowing that her old name would catch her attention.\n\nIce had her comm off so she didn&#39;t get the message right away. &quot;She caught\nLunarpines thoughts and knew he was right. &quot;Follow me. &quot; she told mustex\nstill hoping her trust in other bots wasn&#39;t getting her in more trouble.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Tankor &lt;lordofdarkness11001@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, July 21, 2001 11:22 AM\nSubject: Re: Alliance\n\n\n&gt; hey fix up the chars part of the site. cheetah is in the mutants even\nthough i have him with the\n&gt; x-preds\n&gt; --- dewboy30816@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  WELL HOW&#39;D THE MUTANTS GET THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE!

However, there was a faction a long time ago in\n&gt; &gt; this RPG called the Energonians. They were energy beings much like\n&gt; &gt; yours, just they used energon energy instead of chaotican, and Zardus\n&gt; &gt; had a long rivalry with their leader (who happened to be one of the\n&gt; &gt; bots that helped Zardus and Wolfgang make the Alliance), so he knows\n&gt; &gt; how to handle energy beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And the guy who controls Mustex: how&#39;d Mustex get onto Alliance\n&gt; &gt; Island? The shields were up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Zardus/FZ/DevilDuer/Mosquitor::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Zardus frowns, thinking Frostbite&#39;s transmission over for a second\n&gt; &gt; and then replying. &quot;I would preffer meeting in neutral territory.\n&gt; &gt; Would the peninsula near my base be convenient for you?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He closes that link, and recieves Orchestra&#39;s transmission. &quot;This\n&gt; &gt; is Zardus, Alliance commander. I&#39;ll lower the shields so that you can\n&gt; &gt; get through. I&#39;ll be outside, we can meet there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He walks toward the exit, looking at his wrist comp and tapping a\n&gt; &gt; few buttons, making a search for &quot;Infecticons&quot;. The search yields no\n&gt; &gt; matches. Zardus traces the Infecticon transmissions back to their\n&gt; &gt; origin, then makes a search for any bots that the Iron Fist&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; scanners detected traveling in that direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Interesting...&quot; he says to himself, watching video footage of\n&gt; &gt; Vampiza flying over Alliance Island, surrounded by Chaotican energy.\n&gt; &gt; He zooms in, looking the bot over.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uncanny resembalance to Energonians, he thinks to himself,\n&gt; &gt; activating his comm to Daemos: &quot;Daemos, can you report to my position\n&gt; &gt; as soon as possible? I need you to accompany me somewhere.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Zardus ends that transmission as well, exiting the base and seeing\n&gt; &gt; a bot firing. He frowns, tapping a few buttons to turn the autoguns\n&gt; &gt; off, and begin lowering the shields.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You&#39;re either very brave or very stupid,&quot; he says, approaching the\n&gt; &gt; shields on the other side of which was Chaostaur (whatever his name\n&gt; &gt; is). &quot;Attacking a military installation single-handedly is a very\n&gt; &gt; suicidal task.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; FZ nods, looking over the beasts once more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yes. I must admit I wasn&#39;t expecting you to accomplish this.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He turns and walks toward the exit, the door opening. &quot;Would you\n&gt; &gt; like a shuttle to get back to wherever you are from, or would you\n&gt; &gt; rather fly by yourself?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; DevilDuer waits for Coput to get into the pilot seat, so that they\n&gt; &gt; can get going and he can get away from these weirdos. :-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mosquitor is hit by Hurricane&#39;s shots (post 38120.
