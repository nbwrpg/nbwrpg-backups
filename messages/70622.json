We will cover our signatures as\n&gt; well&quot;said hydras as he masked his signatures with the device and headed\n&gt; towards the exit\n\nThe other soldiers also follow suit, each taking a masking device.\nEach mask was designed to mask the spark signature of each individual\nit was attached to, making it difficult to scan for them.\n\nThe area around the shuttle was barren, very few trees and foliage,\nand the ground was predominantly flat, it sloping up and down as one\nwalked or flew. Although the land was flat that did not mean it was\nsmooth, it was obvious to anyone looking that this area had been mined\nlong ago, and parts of it were still broken and choppy, the very dirt\nstill black and brown with mixtures of rust colored sediment.\n\nEven the air itself was brown foggy haze, remenants of the smog that\nseemed to live over the mining city roughly a mile away from here.\n\nThe soldiers each stood outside the shuttle, Inferno and Terrorsaur\nstanding near to Hydras like bodyguards, with Taratulus nearby like\nsome skulking meance. Injector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, and Quickstrike\nalso came out of the shuttle, each of them ready looking around an\neagerness to each step. Last came Waspinator, his optics quick and\nfurtive. Despite that he usually came back from battle in peices, he\nseemed ready to back up his comrades, his weapon held firmly in hand.\n\n&quot;This is all of us sir.&quot; Injector said, it seemed that for the moment\nhe had taken charge of the Fuzors in Skyshadow&#39;s absence, and he was\nlarge and incharge. He smiled as he looked at Hydras, &quot;When ever you\nare ready we will follow you.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
