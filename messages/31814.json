Though, she was saying that for her own sake, \nsince she almost felt her own mind slipping into the same illusion.\nAnger...helplessness, that was the strongest feels that he felt, so she felt \nit as well. Trapped, not knowing what to do. Everything was lost!*\n\n&quot; NO!&quot;\n\n* Was what she shouted before dropping to her knees and clenched her fists, \nthe gun falling to the ground, but in her mind everything was in slow \nmotion.\nOpening her eyes, everything slowed, the booms of explosions went on for \nminuelts instead of seconds, angry voices were muffled, the slow and steady \nbeat of her spark ringing in her ears.\n&lt; Isn&#39;t real, isn&#39;t real. NO!&gt;\nIn the back of her mind, something awoke.\nSCM: &lt; Mwahahahahahahahahhhhhhhhhhh!!! Welcome to MY world!&gt;\nShe could feel Prowl&#39;s transformation, slow like the world around her, and \npainful to her. Though, pain as in a numb throb, like her body was heating \nup inside of the armor and seering the skin.\n&lt; Prowl!&gt; weak as a whimper as that was, it echoed in her mind as Prowl \ncontinued to transform.\nBut it wasn&#39;t only happening to him, but the SBM in her own systems was \nstruggling to join in on that transformation. But, she had a better grip on \nhers and fought will with will.\n&lt; No! I might be able to controle you but you sap too much power, leave me \nweak.&gt;\nSBM: &lt; Come on! Let me out!...you know you want to.&gt;\n&lt; No I don&#39;t! You&#39;re horrid!&gt;\nSBM: &lt; Only blood thirsty. Nothing wrong with that, come on.&gt; it pushed.\n&lt; No!&gt;*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
