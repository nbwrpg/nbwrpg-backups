I have this vision\n&gt; where Mustex pictures Foxfingers as a deadbeat,to stupid to carry a\n&gt; weapon, who has no place in this war(no offence) so if you let Mustex\n&gt; slag him you could clone and upgrade him. Zardus Mustex still wants\n&gt; to test his power against you.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
