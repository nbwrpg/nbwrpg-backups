For five \nhours or so)\n\n\n\n\nVehement/The Oblitercons:\n\n\n\n\n Vehement pressed a button, stopping the transmissions that were going to \nKitKat&#39;s base non-stop.  He activated his personal comm. unit on his computer \nforearm. \n\n&quot;KitKat, leader of the Predacons?  Hmmm...I would like to know which base or \nbases you hold, your coordinates to be exact.  There are several on scanners, \nand I don&#39;t exactly want to be the person that helps a Predacon trying to \ngain leadership.&quot; he said without a tone of disrespect.  A female Predacon \nleader? he thought.  Interesting.\n\n&quot;My coordinates are 87-1-28 Sector Eminent.  How many troops will you be \nsending?  I don&#39;t want to open my doors to the wrong group and be \nslaughtered.&quot;\n\nHe awaited a reply, hoping his message wouldn&#39;t be filled with static.\n\n========\n\nDark One looked to Zardus and nodded, looking to his forces.  Dark One \ntransformed into his jet fighter mode, his cockpit opening and Hiss climbing \ninside.\n\nDark One took off for the base, the three other Oblitercons climbing into a \nshuttle that took off after Dark One.\n\n\n"}}
