Not one thing - will be touched in the ark. In =\r\nhonor of those I serve, I will - not upset any balance that still remains i=\r\nn place.&quot;\n\n&quot;That is good Tuscon.&quot; Lord Elder said as he struggled to keep t=\r\nhe\nshuttle in flight. It was getting a little easier as he got used to\nthe =\r\nimbalance of one of the engines.\n\n&gt; &quot;Actually, there is a name that fits ya=\r\n better. What&#39;dya think about TUCSON PRIME?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride gives Rat Trap=\r\n a thumbs up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Works for me, what&#39;dya think Lord Elder?&quot;\n\nLord Elder i=\r\ns silent for a moment, &quot;The Primes are a special breed.&quot;\nhe said finally, t=\r\nhe look on his face grave. &quot;They are chosen by the\nmatrix, the name shouldn=\r\n&#39;t be just given.&quot;\n\n&gt; &quot; I sure know that one Wheels. Primus knows we&#39;ve all=\r\n been there in some point in our lives. But I got a feeln&#39; that I don&#39;t nor=\r\nmally get.. I ain&#39;t usually too optimistic but there&#39;s a tiny little feelin=\r\ng of optimism startn&#39; ta build in me. Don&#39;t usually get this warm&#39;n fuzzy b=\r\nut it&#39;s there. And it started when I first saw ya in that fortress. I think=\r\n you got lucky for a reason Wheels, you got lucky because it was fate. Yep =\r\nthat&#39;s what it was, fate. And from what I kinda know about Roddimus... &quot;Gri=\r\nme&quot;... He wasn&#39;t too ready ta take on the responsibility of ben&#39; a Prime of=\r\nficer, it just somehow happened. But you, on the other hand, you got what i=\r\nt takes. I think you might just be a lost Prime, if ya ask me.&quot;\n\n&gt; &quot;Hmph, l=\r\net&#39;s see what Lord Elder thinks. Sir, what&#39;dya think? Could Wheels be the n=\r\next Autobot leader?&quot;\n\nLord Elder frowned as they spoke of Rodimus in deroga=\r\ntory terms,\nlistening to the name they called him. &quot;A leader, a Prime is sp=\r\necial.\nHe must prove himself, not only in battle but also in wisdom, and be=\r\n\nable to rally the Maximals and Autobots.&quot; Elder glanced pointedly at\nTusco=\r\nn, &quot;and he must learn to see past what he thinks is the obvious\nanswer.&quot;\n\nE=\r\nlder turned back to his controls as he linked up with the ark&#39;s\nsystems, &quot;N=\r\no!&quot; he said as he watched one of his smaller screens in\nfront him, &quot;There i=\r\ns a Minion hovering over the old Maximal base&quot;\nElder glanced at Rat Trap, &quot;=\r\nThe one you used when you first arrived.&quot;\n\nElder replayed the last set of t=\r\nransmissions:\n\n&gt; &quot;Marauder.&quot; Legacy began, his voice carrying the\n&gt; slighte=\r\nst hint of curiousness. &quot;We are holding no\n&gt; minion prisoner. Whom do you m=\r\nean?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Marauder&#39;s voice quickly replied over the same\n&gt; channel, his voi=\r\nce calm and confident, &quot;The minion\n&gt; known as Lamia, she has called out to =\r\nme, you will\n&gt; release her immediately&quot;\n\nHe looked back to his controls, &quot;W=\r\ne may need to change course to assist.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Lord Elder)\n\n"}}
