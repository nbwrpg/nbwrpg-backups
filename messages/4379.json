It you wish, please \ntell Megatron that I followed your instructions to the letter. Oh, I hope I \ndidn&#39;t cause you any trouble earlier commander.  I&#39;m sorry that I imposed on \nyour servisec to help with the tunnel.  You must have been very busy.  I \nwill try in the future not to trouble you.&quot;\nShe still looked at him.  He was good looking.  But she knew that she had no \nchance with him.  Not with the other female bots around.\n\n----------Original Message-----------\nFrom: Talon Harvilicz\nDate: Fri Jun 23, 2000 5:15pm\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nQuickstrike:\n\n\nQuickstrike walked to the Predacon&#39;s cave, meanwhile he hear the\ntransmission from Bobertron. All he could do in reply to it was let out a\nhealthy laugh. He gave no reply to it, just kept his path to the cave. 3rd\nin command? He was second in command.\n\nHe slowled his pace and looked behind himself to see if Lightmare was still\nfollowing. He turned his head back around and kept moving. The\nscorpion/cobra made it back to base soon enough, just before the nightfall.\nHe entered and transformed to robot mode. He stretched his arms out over his\nhead and tilted his trunk back slightly.\n\nNoticing Dark Mouse, he said, &quot;Nice night ain&#39;t it?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
