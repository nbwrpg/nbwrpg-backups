Eventually, it would need to be \nre-arranged...\n\nBelthassan:\nThrust, are you still looking over Commander Daemos?\n\nThrust:\nAffirmative, sir. His status has not changed.\n\nBelthassan:\nSlag!! This is not normal!...\nAnd Melchana is still teaching Tankor to use his Crusher Shield...\nThrust, I am going to the Matrix Chamber. I will be meditating. Inform \nme of any change.\n\nThrust:\nOkay. You are going to reach Daemos&#39; spark, right?\n\nBelthassan:\nYes... it is unusual...\n\nMeanwhile, in the training room...\n\nMelchana:\nDEPLOY YOUR SLAGGING SHIELDS!!!!!\n\nShe fired continously on Tankor. He deployed a forcefield around him \nand gathered all the dustfire fired at him.\n\nTankor: I&#39;ll get you... focus, Tankor, focus...\n\nThe energy gathered was then molded as a larger shield. He then \nsuddenly rushed at Melchana and threw the crushing energy at her. She \nwas forced and held down to the ground.\n\nMelchana:\nGood! You progress well!\n\nTankor:\nI take it your praises are either sincere, in which case I should \ndoubt your sanity, or sarcastic, and that I must be ready for more...\n\nMelchana:\nMake that option number 2!!\n\nShe broke free and attacke the massive rhino-bot with her arm-blades.\n\n\n"}}
