I never had the rules explained to me \nwhen I\n&gt;   &gt;   first\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   joined a year ago. I was new to the Internet and didn&#39;t \nknow how\n&gt;   &gt;   to\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   act, and besides that I started off as just a bad RPGer. \nKyle\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Stewart, you start off as a good one, but with the same \nflaw as I\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   originally had. Not knowing the rules. Of course, back \nthen the\n&gt;   &gt;   rules\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   page sucked, and it is nowhere near the grand spectacle \nit is\n&gt;   &gt;   today.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   It&#39;s not very descriptive and informative. But back to my \npoint,\n&gt;   &gt;   I\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   moded alot without even noticing it, and did things very \nsimilar\n&gt;   &gt;   to\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   you, Kyle Stewart (if that&#39;s what you like to be called). \nI once\n&gt;   &gt;   even\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   busted into a base and played around inside in one post \nbecause I\n&gt;   &gt;   was\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   bored, and didn&#39;t know what I did wrong until months \nlater!...\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   From: robertdahl\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 1:45 PM\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Subject: Re: Kyle Stewart\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   OOC: Cool of Legendarynemasis.
