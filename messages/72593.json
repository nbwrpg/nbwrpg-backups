Now if I had a draft horse\n&gt; frame then I&#39;d be in the clear but I don&#39;t .  &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then glances over at the tracks on the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wow, if ya look at the tracks, you can see how Tucson was attempting to\n&gt; use  some fancy footwork ta try and ward off his attacker.  There&#39;s some big\n&gt; gaps in his prints which indicates a bit of acrobatics were at play here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap studies the tracks further.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Yep he was off the ground a few times, I can tell.  But fancy flight work\n&gt; didn&#39;t help the big guy all that much.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No, it didn&#39;t .  But let&#39;s hope he&#39;s still in one piece.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Rat Trap studied the tracks he is able to discern another trail of\nlubricant, this one much lighter and perhaps a little new, it trails\noff in another direction, in fact in the same direction as the\nsecondary trail that BANTOR is indicating leading off to one side.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
