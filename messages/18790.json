He waited \npatiently for Black Arachnia to return with a report of a conference. \nHe wasn&#39;t informed of what it was, but he knew she could handle it. \n\nHe looked around the room for a moment. He remembered he was \nrestricted to this place because of his mischief he usually caused. \nHe was shot at twice for being in here. It dealt with reprograming \nthe computer. The shot on the leg was the worst on him. \n\nHe twitched a few long didgits on his left so-called hand. He paused \nfor a moment, then reached behind his armor and brought out a disk. \nIt was the disk with the information of the Dark Side on it. He \nchuckled. He still had it. \n\nHe put it back and waited further.\n\n\n"}}
