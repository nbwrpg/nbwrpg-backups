He feels his mind being\noverwhelmed by all the stuff that IR was experiencing, and flies\nbackwards, resisting the urge to grip his head. Through half-closed\noptics, Prowl sees the emergy go at Megatron, and his systems begin to\ndeal with the rush from IR.\n\nHe looks down at his mate to see her as Arkness Prime, feeling pride\nbut also a bit sorry that she was now so much stronger than him. But\nit didn&#39;t matter. She was the maximal commander, and she deserved to\nbe good. He just hoped that this would take care of Megatron.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor breathed hard, holding her sword as steadily as she\ncould.\n&gt; That fight with FireBlade had taken alot out of her, but as long as\nit was \n&gt; one less enemy the Maximals had to be threatened with, who cared?\n&gt; Suddenly her muscles tensed and she turned on her heel, the claws of\nher \n&gt; foot armor grinding into the ground.  Her scanners homed in on a\nstreak of \n&gt; pink heading towards her, her mind numb at what was going on.\n&gt; But nothing was controling her body this time, instead she felt a\npower \n&gt; pulsating from the very core of her spark.\n&gt; The Matrix had come to life!\n&gt; Power serged inside of her super structure, so much that it almost\nhurt.  \n&gt; Her hands shook, then the rest of her body followed and she nearly\ndropped \n&gt; her sword.\n&gt; And in one burst, silver flashed wings erupted from her back and\nstratched \n&gt; out behind her.\n&gt; The last of the dieing sun caught a glint off of them as a red light\nbegan \n&gt; to pulse at the flat of her chest. The light began to get brighter,\nalways \n&gt; pulsating with the beating of a single spark.\n&gt; Though there was no helm, a face-plate detatched from neck armor and\ncovered \n&gt; her mouth and nose.\n&gt; And in one swipe of a swords blade, the turrent sent from Megatron\nbounced \n&gt; away and exploded behind her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; MEGATRON!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * With ice blue eyes she glared at him. And with a voice directed by\nthe \n&gt; Matrix itself, she spoke.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I AM ARKNESS PRIME!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Gripping the sword with both hands she raised it above her her,\nthe tip \n&gt; pulsating with a bright red light.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; AND YOU WILL YEALD!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Flipping the blade so that it pointed down, with a will of\ncommanders \n&gt; before her it was stabbed into the ground. Streaks of light erupted\nfrom \n&gt; theblade and slithered along the ground like bolts of lightening\nfrom a \n&gt; thindercloud, cascading towards Magatron. But just before reaching\nhim they \n&gt; shot into the air in straight bars of pure energy by the Matrix&#39;s\nwill. \n&gt; Around Megatron them sprouted, growing and reaching for the\nsky...the gap at \n&gt; the brink...beginning to shrink and close.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
