And don&#39;t ever call\nme Meggy.&quot; he said, adding a dagger like hiss into his voice for the\nlast line. As he walked out he thought to himself. Shockwave would be\ngreat to see, but he had to watch Switchblade, and he knew that. His\nstory was a pathetic cover up. What kind of hold did he have over the\nStrikers? he thought to himself. He exited the Dark Avian, and saw both\nSpeedbreaker and Unitron. He looked straight into the depths of Unitron.\nWithout lifting his eyes, he began to speak, &quot;You may leave us\nSpeedbreaker.&quot; He said, and Speedbreaker gladly turned around,\ntransformed, and headed back for the Maximal city.\n\n"}}
