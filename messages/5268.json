It allows us to talk to one another \nwhile being great distances away from each other.  Like, I can talk to you \nfrom 18 parsecs away with a link like this.  Or even contact someone 5 other \nquatrants away.  I&#39;m so used to it, I hardly notice it.  It&#39;s built into my \narm. It actives when someone uses the maximal frequency.  Or someone can use \nmy frequency and talkt to just me. Why? Don&#39;t you  have a link?&quot;\n\n-----original message---\nFrom: CYBERWOLF4  &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\nDate: Fri Jun 30, 2000 4:02pm\nSubject: Re: (unknown)(The great north.)\n\nLunarpin smelled the air, his systems were not yet fully online so the\nwolf/bot could not hear the incoming transmission Shadow Wing was recieving.\n&quot;Who are you talking too?&quot;Lunarpine asked with a puzzled tone to his voice.\n&quot;I don&#39;t smell anyone nearby.
