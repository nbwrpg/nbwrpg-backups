How dare he? He knew Megatron and knew how\n&gt; to surive here? To him, Striker might as well be a rookie, with Sinesis.\nThe\n&gt; greedy fool. As far as he was concerned, he was leader.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked up at him, with his crimson eyes burning brightly. &quot;You? No\n&gt; way,tin-horn! Ah&#39;m in charge! And if Megatron is alive, let me hear it\nfrom\n&gt; &#39;im! Ya don&#39;t know nothin&#39;! Ah&#39;s been here longa than ya. Ah&#39;s seen\nweirder\n&gt; slag than ya, so ah&#39;m in charge. Who ya think ya are? Ah&#39;m one of\nMegatron&#39;s\n&gt; original troops! Ah knew that Rattrap wasn&#39;t nothin&#39; but trouble.

He jerked his head towards him, with his eyes wild. &quot;Who&#39;s friend?&quot;\n&gt; he asked Hiss. Transulas, he was thinking. Oh, Primus, he hooped so.
