She stood outside the \nhatch catching her breath. She was having fun for the first time \nsince she had arrived to this base.  She found herself laughing and \nhaving fun.

It felt great to just let her wings down for a \nwhile. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Terry Barlow &lt;twb176@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::WindRider::\n&gt; &quot;Oh no, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; he says to Battera, &quot;You&#39;re\n&gt; not gonna get away from me that easy!&quot;He took off\n&gt; after her.
