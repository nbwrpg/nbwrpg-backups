A lot of it if not a=\r\nll of it, is actually my fault. The day we fought off Hydras&#39;s lackies two =\r\nyears ago, I had managed to deal with the ones I was fighting against and s=\r\naw that you, Nightlight and Windlord were in desperate need of help. So I w=\r\nent as fast as I could, to try and divert enemy fire away from you, but I f=\r\nailed to check a blind spot in my rear view mirror, and I was shot from beh=\r\nind, rendering me inoperable and blind. If I had just taken more careful su=\r\nrvey of what was around me, none of this, including what happened to you, w=\r\nould never have happened. Now, now is the time to make it up to you. We&#39;ll =\r\nfight them together. Scorponok doesn&#39;t scare me, none of them do. All right=\r\n Jhiaxus, don&#39;t expect me to make this easy for you because I&#39;m not! As I&#39;v=\r\ne said to Scorponok before, I will not fold to any of you, no matter what d=\r\namages you instill on me!\n\nRodimus almost smiled as Tuscon tried so hard to=\r\n take the blame, or at\nleast some of it. He shook his head slightly, &quot;Becau=\r\nse you didn&#39;t\ncheck a blind spot all of this happened?&quot; Rodimus turned to l=\r\nook back\nat the oncoming Decepticons, &quot;No, no one can say that. I have my o=\r\nwn\nblame to bear, but this time I will bear it rather than trying to . .\n. =\r\n&quot; Rodimus&#39; voice stopped mid sentence as he struggled with something\ninside=\r\n his head!\n\nJhaxius smiled as he, Cyclonus and Scourge walked foward, Cyclo=\r\nnus&#39;\nstrides quickly bring him to the fore. &quot;Did you think we did not have\n=\r\nthis in mind?&quot; Cyclonus said. &quot;Rodimus, as long as he lives will still\nbelo=\r\nng to Hydras!&quot;\n\nBehind Cyclonus, Jhiaxus was holding a device, a miniature =\r\nversion of\nwhat was used originally to change Windlord and Rodimus into the=\r\n evil\nversions of themselves.\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; Jhiaxus said, &quot;The original program h=\r\nad gone dormant but still\nremained. It was only a matter of bringing the so=\r\nftware back online.&quot;\n\nRodimus shook his head as he mouthed the word, &#39;NO&#39;. =\r\nHe held his head\nand fell to his knees, his palms against his ears as if he=\r\n were trying\nto block out voices that he was hearing.\n\nScorponok chuckled a=\r\ns he resumed his robot mode and he and Scourge\nbrought up the rear, &quot;Yes Br=\r\nother.&quot; Scorponok said to Rodimus, &quot;Come\nback to us, we need you.&quot; his voic=\r\ne sarcastic and condescending.\n\nRodimus&#39; armor slowly began to blacken agai=\r\nn and then shift red as if\non fire. He glanced over at Tuscon, his optics s=\r\ntill the amber of his\nAutobot upbringing, &quot;Get Nightlight . . . all of them=\r\n out of here!&quot; he\nsaid, his voice hoarse and intense, &quot;This must stop here,=\r\n now!&quot;\n\nRodimus glanced at a message that he received from Perceptor . .  .=\r\n\n\n&gt; &quot;6 cycles - P.&quot;\n\nRodimus smiled as his armor shifted black again, &quot;Yes =\r\nbrother I hear\nyou.&quot; Rodimus said as he began to walk forward. Behind his b=\r\nack he\nmotion to Tuscon to go, &quot;GO!&quot; he said fiercely.\n\nRodimus stopped nea=\r\nr the device that Perceptor had planted, shielding\nit from the view of the =\r\nDecepticons, &quot;Come &#39;brothers&#39;&quot; he said, &quot;We\ncan end all this here and now.&quot;=\r\n\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
