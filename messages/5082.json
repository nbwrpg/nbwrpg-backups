The poision had run its\ncourse.\n&gt; &gt;That made things a lot easier. A well heated battle he wouldn&#39;t mind, but\n&gt; &gt;he\n&gt; &gt;needed to get back to base, and tell Megatron what he had. Also, he\ndidn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;have a lot of space to move around in. The trees would just get in his\nway.\n&gt; &gt;But either way, he won. He told Cheetor he could beat him. Sure, he\nbusted\n&gt; &gt;his foot, but he won.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;He kicked the Maximal on the side, watched him just in case he moved. He\n&gt; &gt;then crouched and waved two the Predacon females over.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/13/_/_/_/962198596/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
