How dare he? He knew Megatron and knew\n&gt; &gt;how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to surive here? To him, Striker might as well be a rookie, with\nSinesis.\n&gt; &gt;The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; greedy fool. As far as he was concerned, he was leader.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He looked up at him, with his crimson eyes burning brightly. &quot;You? No\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way,tin-horn! Ah&#39;m in charge!

He jerked his head towards him, with his eyes wild. &quot;Who&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;friend?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he asked Hiss. Transulas, he was thinking.
