His optic displaying a bit of\nmirth as he watched them he nodded to Perceptor.  &quot;You say that our\nactions are predictable, and even boring, but in the end people of all\ntypes flourish where there is freedom. What would you gain under the\nrule of the Predcons or the Decepticons?&quot;\n\nRodimus shrugged as he continued, &quot;What will you do if you succeed in\nconquering everything?&quot; Rodimus frowned, &quot;One thing I have learned\nspending these past months among you is that Predacons, much like the\nDecepticons, care only about power even at the expense of each other.\nThat is why they cannot win, because in the end they only work against\neach other.&quot;\n\nRodimus looked speculatively at Perceptor, &quot;Is there anything more\nthat you would want for yourself?&quot;\n\nEven as they walked the sounds of rumbling could be heard coming from\nbehind them, the sounds of someone digging could be clearly heard,\nlike a drill, or several of them moving in their direction through the\nvery walls.\n\n&quot;That sounds like Scorponok&#39;s digging!&quot; Rodimus said, his voice and\nface resolute. &quot;We had better hurry, we do not want to be stuck down\nhere with him.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nWho: LEGACY, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA, BLACKRAZOR, Rat Trap, Quickstride\nLocation: Black Fortress - hallway\n\nLegacy, noting the direction that the others have left in started up\nhis own motors. &quot;Come he said to Rat Trap and Quickstride, &quot;We also\nneed to leave. No doubt the Predacons and Decepticons are rallying for\nsome sort of defensive maneuver.&quot;\n\n&quot;You would be right.&quot; A voice from the shadows ahead said as the bulky\nform of Deepstyke could be seen in his gun unit mode.\n\nEven as Deepstryke spoke from behind chuckling could be heard as\nPhobia and Nightrazor come out as if from side hall or doorway, they\nchuckle as Phobia&#39;s voice could be heard chiming in, &quot;Although it is\ntoo late to do anything about it.&quot;\n\nAs one the three units open fire, Deepstryke&#39;s cannons opened up on\nLegacy, who&#39;s shielding was beginning to fail under the onslaught\nwhile Phobia and Nightrazor aimed for Rat Trap and Quickstride.\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: Airly, I am not sure what you want to do with Hydras. If you want\nto send me a note offline you can and we can work something out, or\nyou can post him in action if you like. Cyclonus and Scourge will be\nwith him, if that&#39;s okay with you.\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
