There was somebot approaching! She looked back at Gangon \nand growled as she motioned towards the south/west.*\n\n&quot; Hay! There&#39;s somebot coming! Transform.&quot;\n\n* BrightBlade looked off towards the south/west and saw a shape walking \ntowards them, she transformed into robot mode and took out her weapon.\nAs her and Gangon stood on a rise she aimed her gun at the approaching bot, \nit&#39;s signature telling her that it was a Maximal.*\n\n&quot; Hay! You! Stop where you are or you&#39;ll be blown to scrap! Don&#39;t you have \nany clue that you&#39;re trespassing on Lord Hell Beast&#39;s land?! He wants none \nof your kind around here and frankly neither do I!&quot;\n\n* She began to make her way down towards the new bot and glared at her when \nshe came close enough to shot at point blank range. BrightBlade looked at \nthe Maximal (Plintissa) and growled, she scanned to see if Gangon was \nfollowing her.*\n\n&quot; Drop what ever weapons you have and state why you&#39;re here before I get \nimpatient and blow your slagin head of. Not one known for patients...or \nMaximals for that matter.&quot;\n\n* BrightBlade brought her gun up to a height that if Plintissa decided to \nact funny she would be able to just as she claimed she would. She called \nover her shoulder to Gangon.*\n\n&quot; Get your butt down here, we got ourselves a Maximals straggler!&quot;\n\n* With that said she turned her attention back to Plintissa.*\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
