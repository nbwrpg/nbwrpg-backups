But out of the \ndust walked, or limped a smoking FireStrike, staring into the evil \ndepths of Megatrons eyes. &quot;I have seen enough.  You and your evil to \nyour own team will prove to be your death, and I am the reaper.&quot;\nFireStrike stated. The reprogramation that SwitchBlade had done had \nall been deleted by the fusion power zapping him.  He was now once \nagain FireBlade, but with his FireStrike body. &quot;You treat us like \nyour junkyard dogs. Well Megatron, prepare to become nothing but a \npart of the Pit.&quot; he stated loudly firing a rocket from his sword \nback at Megatron.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; ::FireStrike::\n&gt; FireStrike brought the flat side of his sword against his body \n&gt; blocking the shots.  He then pointed the blade straight at Unitron. \n&gt; The blade opened and a rocket came flying out. On impact the rocket \n&gt; would explode in heat enough to melt some body parts.  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Unitron:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Brave words,&quot; Unitron said as he leapt back from Nightstrike&#39;s \n&gt; slashes, \n&gt; &gt; firing off ten two blasts from his rifle at him.  He ducked down \nto \n&gt; narrowly \n&gt; &gt; avoid Megatron&#39;s blast, and fired ten rapid optic blasts at the \n&gt; incoming \n&gt; &gt; Decepticon leader, digging his feet into the ground in case of \n&gt; impact.\n\n\n"}}
