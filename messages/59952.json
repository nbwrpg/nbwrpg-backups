He looks towards &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Cooley &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and says &quot;Well I can pickup Dragos and Argos weapons fired &lt;BR&gt;&gt; here. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is confuzing. It is almost as if the other set of &lt;BR&gt;weapons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is Identical yet seperate from the Dragos, As if there was a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; clone.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cooley looked towards SureStrike as if in confusion. &quot;How &lt;BR&gt;was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weapons cloned. I mean they are designed to use no traceable &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; signal.&quot; Cooley said. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Well there is a way, But that is if we are cloned.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; SureStrike &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; replied to Cooley with a\n concerned look to him. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;If that is the case then what are we doing we need to &lt;BR&gt;find &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dragos &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ans Argos before they die. That is if they aren&#39;t already &lt;BR&gt;dead &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.&quot; replyed Cooley. At that they take off again to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; check &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the area for scraps and other parts but they find none. They &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Soon &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide to setup a signal to to Report back to the maximal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; base. &quot;Maximals this is SureStrike, we are done searching &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; section &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 43 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; degrees south by 18 degrees east. We are now moving into the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Badlands. Please do not worry bout us. I am setting up this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; relay &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; station so we could still keep in communication.&quot; SureStrike &lt;BR&gt;&gt; set &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; the base on a repeat loop. to make sure that any maximal &lt;BR&gt;will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
