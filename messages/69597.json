He wasn&#39;t abou=\r\nt to let a little pot hole get in the way of him reaching his leader who he=\r\n now believed was POW and held under demonic control. Reaching speeds of we=\r\nll over one twenty MPH he kicks up dust beneath his tires and handles the r=\r\noughness of the terrain as if it were as smooth as newly laid down asphault=\r\n. His sonar systems now pick up the density and size of the dark tower whic=\r\nh drives him forward, not to mention the fact that he could pick up heat si=\r\ngnatures which resembled his own. He knew. Rodimus was there, and no doubt =\r\nhe&#39;d be there with some familliar enemies. The thought of Decepticons being=\r\n involved in this enrages him even more.\n\n  He thinks things through while =\r\ndriving toward the tower, where he could sense Rodimus&#39;s heat signatures.\n\n=\r\n  &quot; How could I have let this happen? If I hadn&#39;t let my guard down the fir=\r\nst time, and gotten myself shot, you wouldn&#39;t be in this mess Rodimus. I pr=\r\nomise you this though, this time, I will bring you back, and I will not aba=\r\nndon you. No matter how hateful you are of me, no matter how badly you want=\r\n to destroy me. My spark is dedicated to those I care deeply for. That part=\r\n of me will never die. I will also make those who are responsible for what =\r\nthey have done to you, pay for what they did. They had no right taking your=\r\n spark and your soul. I swear by the name of Primus that I will risk my own=\r\n spark to see yours safely out of harm&#39;s way.&quot;\n\n  He was now nearing the to=\r\nwer. Another familliar signature pings loudly in his sonar system. He could=\r\n tell by the frequency that it was from a Decepticon. He could also identif=\r\ny the carrier.\n\n  &quot;Cyclonus... Ohh yeah, this definitely has your name writ=\r\nen all over it. Right, well, enjoy the party while it lasts because I&#39;m abo=\r\nut to crash it... Literally.&quot;\n\n  He senses he&#39;s only a few feet from the to=\r\nwer, and transforms. Yet, he keeps hidden. He knew that an all out attack w=\r\nasn&#39;t the best way to go. If he was going to succeed in this mission, he&#39;d =\r\nhave to do it without being seen and right underneath Cyclonus&#39;s nose. He w=\r\nas good at staying out of the sight of the enemy. Not only had he trained w=\r\nith Kup, but also trained with Prowl. Silence was his middle name. He sends=\r\n a low powered sonar wave to see if it picks up anything. In the general ar=\r\nea he was clear of incombants. He knew that if he touched the tower there c=\r\nould be an alarm system. He scans for that.\n\n  &quot;Hmm... Just in case, I shou=\r\nld activate a scrambling wave. That should quiet any security system that c=\r\nould be active here.. I hope.&quot;\n\n  He waits a good five minuts or so until h=\r\ne&#39;s sure that the system is disabled. Once he runs a scan of his sonar syst=\r\nems, he concludes that it did indeed have a mild effect on the system, whic=\r\nh made it safe for him to approach the tower. He again hides behind a mass =\r\nof debris, and finds that breeze catches his face, from the opposite side o=\r\nf the tower. There was a door that was partially opened. He feels for it wi=\r\nth his fingers, and quietly slides it open just enough to sqeeze in, which =\r\nwas a little bit of a squeeze for him. This was it, he was inside. Again, n=\r\not wanting to make it obvious, he quietly slides the door just a bit ajar, =\r\nto make sure he isn&#39;t discovered. Then, quietly he hides again, and stops t=\r\no try to pick up Rodimus&#39;s heat signature once more. It was difficult, beca=\r\nuse his temperature continued to drop with every ounce of energy that was b=\r\neing stolen from him. \n\n  &quot; All right, low heat signature, this is going to=\r\n make it a little difficult to track. Time to boost up my receptors a bit..=\r\n. And it wouldn&#39;t hurt to scramble my signals either...&quot; \n\n  Tucson had nev=\r\ner known fear and apprehension. With every slow step, he becomes more and m=\r\nore familliar with both emotions. He couldn&#39;t let them stop him. He was doi=\r\nng this to save Rodimus, a gesture from the spark who&#39;s power is relentless=\r\n. His affections for his leader keeps him focused on the task at hand. And =\r\nit isn&#39;t long until his persistance pays off. The ping was loud and clear, =\r\nand yes, it was Rodimus. The signature read Decepticon though. But knowing =\r\nwhat Kenzo had told him, he keeps reserved. Now, he wanted to be seen and h=\r\neard. With his cross bow subspaced he stands idol, but ready for anything. =\r\nAnd quietly with a soft tone of voice..\n\n  &quot;Rodimus.&quot;\n\n  --- In nbwrpg@yaho=\r\nogroups. com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@ ...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Just to cl=\r\narify.

To him Restoration was more than just restoring arti=\r\nfacts, making them appear and work like new, it was also about restoring ol=\r\nd programming and recovery of important data. He did not know the extent of=\r\n the corruption upon which was placed on Rodimus but he knew he couldn&#39;t ju=\r\nst throw in the towel on his leader. Autobots stuck together, and through t=\r\nhick and thin, he&#39;d keep his pledge to never abandon his fellow Autobots.

This puts the Matrix of Leadership at a grave R=\r\nisk, but most of all, his spark, which I believe is too precious to waste f=\r\nor evil purposes. I can not abandon my leader, not even in his corruptive s=\r\ntate. I hereby announce that I am on route to locating my leader, and I DO =\r\nintend to BRING HIM BACK. Hopefully, the damage can be reversed. If not, th=\r\nere is question of the well being of the Matrix. I must recover it, perhaps=\r\n not for my own personal gain, but for the benefit of Autobot kind. It&#39;s to=\r\no precious to lose to the hands of those who thirst for power and greed.

He again hides behind a mass of debris, and finds \n  that breeze=\r\n catches his face, from the opposite side of the tower. There was a \n  door=\r\n that was partially opened. He feels for it with his fingers, and quietly \n=\r\n  slides it open just enough to sqeeze in, which was a little bit of a sque=\r\neze \n  for him. This was it, he was inside. Again, not wanting to make it o=\r\nbvious, he \n  quietly slides the door just a bit ajar, to make sure he isn&#39;=\r\nt discovered. \n  Then, quietly he hides again, and stops to try to pick up =\r\nRodimus&#39;s heat \n  signature once more. It was difficult, because his temper=\r\nature continued to \n  drop with every ounce of energy that was being stolen=\r\n from him. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; All \n  right, low heat signature, this is going to mak=\r\ne it a little difficult to \n  track. Time to boost up my receptors a bit...=\r\n And it wouldn&#39;t hurt to scramble \n  my signals either...&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tucson h=\r\nad never known fear and apprehension. \n  With every slow step, he becomes m=\r\nore and more familliar with both emotions. \n  He couldn&#39;t let them stop him=\r\n. He was doing this to save Rodimus, a gesture \n  from the spark who&#39;s powe=\r\nr is relentless. His affections for his leader keeps \n  him focused on the =\r\ntask at hand. And it isn&#39;t long until his persistance pays \n  off. The ping=\r\n was loud and clear, and yes, it was Rodimus. The signature read \n  Decepti=\r\ncon though. But knowing what Kenzo had told him, he keeps reserved. \n  Now,=\r\n he wanted to be seen and heard. With his cross bow subspaced he stands \n  =\r\nidol, but ready for anything. And quietly with a soft tone of \n  voice..&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Rodimus.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com=\r\n&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank \n  ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Super \n  Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@ ...&=\r\ngt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Just to clarify. \n  The physical structure that =\r\nholds the energy of the matrix is still inside of \n  Rodimus, but the energ=\r\ny itself was siphoned out by Cyclonus during one of \n  their climatic encou=\r\nnters.

This puts the=\r\n Matrix of Leadership at a grave Risk, but most of all, \n  his spark, which=\r\n I believe is too precious to waste for evil purposes. I can \n  not abandon=\r\n my leader, not even in his corruptive state. I hereby announce \n  that I a=\r\nm on route to locating my leader, and I DO intend to BRING HIM BACK. \n  Hop=\r\nefully, the damage can be reversed. If not, there is question of the well \n=\r\n  being of the Matrix. I must recover it, perhaps not for my own personal g=\r\nain, \n  but for the benefit of Autobot kind. It&#39;s too precious to lose to t=\r\nhe hands of \n  those who thirst for power and greed. I swear by Primus&#39;s na=\r\nme, I will return, \n  but my return may not be a fast one.
