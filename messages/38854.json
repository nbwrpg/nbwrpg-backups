He was terrified and the only way he could \nexpress his fear was to lay at the back wall, hanging onto the nearest \nprojection so hard his grip left dents. His jaws chattered, sounding \nmuch like the ratt-atat-tat of a talegraph machine. He was oblivious \nto all but the pilot and silently prayed (if you could call it that) \nto himself. \n    He did not want to die. Not yet. Not without a good battle.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n***************************\n\n\n"}}
