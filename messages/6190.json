Lunarpine sensed her feelings toward him, those would have \nto be tossed aside before she could take him seriously.&quot;You can&#39;t be \ntaught, you already have everything you need, you just need to \ndownload it from inside yourself.&quot; The wolf in him knew he couldn&#39;t \nteach her to fly, but he&#39;d be slaged before he saw her quit on \nherself.\n\n&quot;The great leaders didn&#39;t get taught to be great, the great fighters \nweren&#39;t taught to fight, either it&#39;s there or it&#39;s not. I can&#39;t see \nyour spark, so tell me, what are you, a lover, a fighter, a leader, a \nfollwer? WHAT ARE YOU?&quot;\n\nThat was the one question she had to overcome before she could reach \nher full potential.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She followed Lunarpine to the base.  She was very confused.  She \n&gt; didn&#39;t know what was wrong with her.  She knew that she was n \normally \n&gt; driven by her instincts.  Normally her logic circuits were helpful \nin \n&gt; getting things accoumplished.  But since she met Lunarpine, her \nlogic \n&gt; circuits were going bonkers.  She decided to go to her quarters and \n&gt; run diognostics.  She hoped a small wire waqs just loose and that \n&gt; this confusion in her would easily be solved.  She ran her \n&gt; diognostics.  She found no such wire.\n&gt; &quot;Blast! Well, so much for an easy cure to this problem.&quot;\n&gt; She went out of her quarters.  She looked for Lunarpine.  When she \n&gt; found him in the base, she walked up to him,&quot;Uh, look.  I&#39;m \nterrably \n&gt; sorry for my behavoir earlier.  I was wrong.  I should have faced \nmy \n&gt; problems instead of running from them.  But I was wondering, since \n&gt; you are a greater fighter than I,I was wondering if you could teach \n&gt; me how to fight. I mean, you showed me that I could use a lot of \n&gt; improvement on my technequ.  I was wondering if you could help me \n&gt; help me to improve?&quot; She looked into his eyes and took one step \n&gt; closer to him, &quot;Please?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
