With such heavy damages to \nessential circuits, he started wondering how he managed not to hurt \nanyone.\n\nAt the same moment, he saw Ragnar&#39;s towering form enter the lounge he \nwas in.\n\nRagnar: So, guys, this is the lounge, from what I make of the map. \nYour personnal quarters are on the right.\n\nBlackfang: There is also an energon distributor at the end of the left \nhallway.\n\nRagnar turned at Blackfang and studied him. He was an ugly looking \nbot, but he also had a sense of nobility emanating from him. He \nreminded him a bit of Trent, the Smoke Jaguar Mechwarrior who betrayed \nhis Clan because of his convictions.\n\nRagnar: You are Blackfang, quiaff?\n\nBlackfang: Yeah, that&#39;s me. Ragnar, right? And who are your friends?\n\nRagnar: This is Windlord and Aerotaur. They are new warriors here. (He \nstopped a moment) Perhaps you can help me. I have been here only for a \nshort time, and since I am not of Robotic origins, I know not what we \nfight for. Maybe you can brief me, quiaff?\n\nBlackfang grinned: Why not? Alright, we are maximals. Our main enemies \nhere are the Predacons, who&#39;re some kind of criminals here. Their boss \nhas a notoriety for dangerous scheming. However, there are some other \ngroups that just popped up since we came here. We may have to deal \nwith&#39;em too.\n\nRagnar: I thank you, Blackfang.\n\n\n"}}
