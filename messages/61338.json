Remember he created the original Sweeps, along with Scourge, Cyclonus and Galvatron by reformatting Decepticons. Unicron must have learned of the connon project. The Minions he sent must have told him. Now he has ordered a massive strike on it to pave the way for his arrival.\n\nRodimus thinks over this dire situation for another few moments.\n\nRodimus Prime: This could be both bad a good for us. The good thing is that if Unicron feels that he must strike like this then the cannon must be capable of stopping him and hes scared.

Unicron has sent a massive force to strike at the cannon that is being constructed to defend against Unicron. All Maximals as well as other fections will be needed to defend it. Orders are here by issued to all Maximals and allies to report immedietly to the cannon construction site for battle. Good luck and may Primus watch over all of you. Kup out.\n\nKup closes the link.\n\nRodimus has set up repeating subspace visual/audio signal to be sent to the other faction commanders.\n\nRodimus Prime: This is Maximal Commander Rodimus Prime calling the Predacon and Tripredacus Commanders. We have detected a assault force arriving on the planet. This force is headed for the cannon. The force seems to consist of Sweeps, similar to the old Decepticon class. This leads us to believe that this force is a pre-emptive strike by Unicron. I&#39;m sending every bot that the Maximals have to defend the cannon. I suggest that the Predacons and Tripredacus do the same. I hope to see you on the battle field.

As the last of them flew out, sh signalled the strike force to \nbegin re entry, which lasted  many long cycles.  After they entered \nEarth&#39;s atmosphe, they corrected thir course and made a bee line for \nthe cannon, whose purpose was to destroy their master, and they \ncouldn&#39;t have that.\n\n\nOOC:\nMaximals- You can detect the large force of Sweeps and send help to \nthe cannon.\n\nPredacons- The cannon may be taken by suprise, depending if you \ndetect the minions as well.\n\n\n\nYahoo!
