Gatara fires first, \nher \n&gt; fingers squeezing down on both her rifle&#39;s triggers, launching a \n&gt; barrage of magnum rounds and a grenade.  This acts as a signal for \n&gt; the other two: Riekan launches an explosive harpoon, and Jayde \nfires \n&gt; several bursts from her ionic blaster.  (Much like the weapon that \n&gt; G1&#39;s Blast Off uses in robot mode, it doesn&#39;t physically damage its \n&gt; target, instead disrupting the electrical impulses that control \nboth \n&gt; organic and mechanoid nervous systems, causing spasms or possibly \n&gt; shorting a bot out altogether.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Firing their weapons makes the Rogues temporarily visible, but they \n&gt; quicky scatter and recloak, seeking to assess the damage they \ncaused.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Tyrael had not spotted Talon yet, and he started to not care \nabout \n&gt; &gt; him.
