She swooped \ndown to him.  She called out, &quot;Hello there. I just wanted to say \nthanks again.&quot;  She droped the crow in front of him and landed.\nShe could see that his optics were not healed.  They looked blank. \nShe felt sorry for him.  She also felt partailly responcable for his \ninjury. She knew he was a proud wolf and wouldn&#39;t want her to feel \nsorry for him, but she did.  She just had to hide her feelings for \nnow and just try to help him without offending him.\nI got a call over the link.  The base is in trouble.  If you want to \nscarf the dinner I brought, I&#39;ll wait and we can go back together.  \nI&#39;ll keep a birds eye view out for trouble along the way.&quot;\nShe tried to sound reasuring, but regretted the words &#39;birds eye \nview&#39;. Bad joice of words, she thought.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Prowl::\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl spins around as Shadow Wing lands near him.

Me and \n&gt; Dinobot will be back to finish off the preds later, WITH Iron \nRaptor and \n&gt; Tavatron. Untill then, I&#39;m shutting off my comm.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He switches off that frequency, leaving his comm only open to \nDinobot.\n\n\n"}}
