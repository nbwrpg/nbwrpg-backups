It skimmed across the \natmosphere and then entered the atmosphere.  It was going to come \ndown somewhee between all the bases.  After re-entry, the booster \nsection jetisoned and the fighter spread its wings and touched off \nthe engines.  It was then it detected the signal it was looking \nfor.
