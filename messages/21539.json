She wondered \nif he was going to do the same to her. She lowered her hand on her \ngun as he turned to her.  She noticed how he addressed her as master \nand relaxed slightly. But she wasn&#39;t sure just how this bot would \nreact or how he would fight. But what she had just witnessed, he was \ngood. She nodded to him and smiled slightly, trying to hide her \nemotion over Destructor&#39;s death. \n&quot;Yes, it appears we do have things to discuss. Please, let us go to \nanother room where we can talk without interuption.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Death landed at the base. It was not familiar but he knew \ndestructor and it \n&gt; could only mean an advantage. All the horsmen created eachother. \nOnce again \n&gt; reunited. Destructor also said hello. Suddenly the origanal 5 \nlooked up in \n&gt; pure terror. They all looked at the tm2 dragon landing at thier \nfeet. \n&gt; &quot;Apocalypse!&quot; those would be the last words of the once great \n&gt; destructor....Apocalypse grabbed him by the throat and proceeded to \nrip off \n&gt; his head. Apocalypse wiped the mech fluid of his hands. He turned \nto Kit Kat. \n&gt; &quot;My name is apocalypse. We have much to discuss. Destructor was a \nweak being. \n&gt; Now the real war can begin.&quot; all the horsmen bowed on all fours to \nthier new \n&gt; master. War looked up with a tear in his eye and one thought in his \n&gt; head..&quot;Destructor will be reseracted. When the day is right.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
