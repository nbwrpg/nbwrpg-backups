In robot mode th=\r\ne\n&gt; sensors tended to be active, sending out beams of varying energies to\n&gt;=\r\n be bounced back and read for analysis. In beast mode these tended to\n&gt; be =\r\nmore passive, absorbing what was already there.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the most part it h=\r\nas been radio and sonar waves that had been cut\n&gt; off in the beginning but =\r\nas they approached the cave other sensor\n&gt; types were being muffled more, e=\r\nscpecially the active ones until they\n&gt; were nearly gone.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFor the m=\r\noment, BLACKARACHNIA continued with her pulses then, attempting to see wher=\r\ne the sensor blockages became heavier, and as her active sensors were becom=\r\ning more and more useless, she began to switch over to passive ones.  Runni=\r\nng her optics to an ultraviolet mode if it was availabile, and seeing fi sh=\r\ne could begin to run energy blockage traces, to hopefully track where teh j=\r\namming was heavier.\n\nAnd as the MAXIMALS and PREDACONS seemed to be readyin=\r\ng to travel underground, she went over to try and scan the area to see wher=\r\ne further signatures might be coming from.  Still not breaking her cloak, i=\r\nntent on staying aboveground.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME frowned for a moment a=\r\ns he thought about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That sounds like an excellent plan.&quot; CRYOTEK s=\r\naid as he looked at LEO.\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHADOW nodded as he smiled mischievously, =\r\n&quot;Of course.&quot; He gestured\n&gt; to t LEO, &quot;After you Maximal Prime.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No pr=\r\noblem, we&#39;ve got this.&quot; BANTOR said as he glanced at LEO and\n&gt; TORCA the FU=\r\nSZOR commander.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME nodded, &quot;Let&#39;s go, it&#39;s time to end this. St=\r\naying out here\n&gt; talking is not helping.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a resolute step LEO PRI=\r\nME began to lead the others down. He could\n&gt; also feel the change in his se=\r\nnsors, their loss of effectiveness as he\n&gt; turned in different directions.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; As the group ventured inside TORCA spoke softly, &quot;Why would someone\n&gt; =\r\nallow their base of operations to be so readily located like this if\n&gt; it i=\r\ns suppose to be hidden in a cave?&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDINOBOT sat to the back as th=\r\ne MAXIMALS went to go down teh tunnel.  IF there was an ambush ahead, then =\r\nthey would take the brunt of it, and any hidden defenses would target and a=\r\nttrite them first.  While also giving the PREDACONS effective control of th=\r\ne tunnel up to the surface in case a quick escape was needed or other uses =\r\ncould be maintained for it.\n\nSpeaking over to TORCA, &quot;I would assume a ques=\r\ntion of geology.  Their facility, if it is such, is probably underground qu=\r\nite simply as that is where the most stable ground is.  Aboveground things =\r\nare too muddy for a solid base iwthout using heavy technology to establish =\r\nit.  Which wold be more noticable to outside analysis.  So they have a stab=\r\nle base in the caverns.  It also may have to do something with their jammin=\r\ng technology as well.&quot;\n\nNot saying the obvious &#39;it was a trap&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
