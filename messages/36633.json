So quit yer whinin&#39;, everyone! (Kidding. But we are considering new rules).\n\n::Incarcinator/Scyther/Demise/EndBringer/Killfest::\n\nIncarcinator swears, flying out of the way of the bean and firing three fast explosive shells up at the ship. He didn&#39;t want to be incarcinated today. He flies away from the origin of the beam that had nearly captured him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther arrives at the scene (I don&#39;t think he arrived yet. I might have forgotten), fully cloaked. He looks around and fires two charges down at the Trainer base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise looks up to see the Trainer base a bit aways in front of him. He continues running for it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer arrives at the Trainer base, roaring and firing a missile from each missile launcher, one at the Violator and another at the Trainer base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKillfest, quite surprisingly, remains still.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; The violators heavy armor is pelted by all ten shots by the autoguns, \n&gt; the shields not having been active at the time. Ten large dents \n&gt; appear along its hull as the weapons on the ship begin to power up \n&gt; once again. Vile presses a button making the four multi phase alser \n&gt; cannons begin to charge to overload. As this happens the Infecticon \n&gt; ship begins to spin slowly as it moves past the Violator as it fires \n&gt; eight massive blasts at the ship cuasing it to shake violently and \n&gt; lose more altitude. suddenly eight explosions erupt from each of the \n&gt; spots that the blasts hit causing the ship to shudder even more and \n&gt; expel large amounts of smoke. The shields of the Violator come online \n&gt; quickly just as eight more blasts are fired at it although not as \n&gt; massive as the past eight. The Infecticon ship, now over \n&gt; starscream,Incarcinator, Neody, and scyther?(not suire if he arrived \n&gt; yet or not.)  Immediately the same white column that engulf Cyanide \n&gt; shoots down and surrounds Incarcinator, the bulge of light housing 8 \n&gt; rings flying down to surround him.(Yanshosh, your char so have him \n&gt; move if you dont want him imprisoned for the time being.) \n\n\n"}}
