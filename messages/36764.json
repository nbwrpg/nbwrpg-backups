Due to all the complaints that we&#39;ve gotten from the \nmembers on this battle, the council has thus far come up with the \nfollowing:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. No teleportation whatsoever. This includes all the beaming.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. No deathglyders/tanks\n&gt; for the time being. This is still being discussed.\n&gt; 3. Absolutely no anti-shield weapons. No exuses.\n&gt; 4. All large ships must crash upon entering the atmosphere. Please \nget those two ships out of the air and into their permanent positions.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re still talking about it, so things might change. These rules \ntake effect immediately.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Slayer/Incarcinator/EndBringer/Demise::\n&gt; \n&gt; Slayer dodges most of the beam, his arm being blown off. He curses, \nfiring two blasts from his remaining shoulder cannon back at the ship \nthat had shot him.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Incarcinator is hit by the two shots from the Trainer base, being \nblown backwards. The beam almost hits him, but he doesn&#39;t notice as \nhe tries to regain balance.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Roaring, EndBringer fires two more missiles at the Trainer base.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Demise looks around, growling. He didn&#39;t have any good long-range \nweapons, so he couldn&#39;t really help much.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
