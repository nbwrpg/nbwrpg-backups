Looking around, he saw a somewhat small \nmissile heading for the Ark.  He watched as it hit the Ark and explopded \nagainst the orangish craft&#39;s hull.  Activating his com as he saw two more \nmissile explosions up on a cliff somewhat surrounding the Ark, he took out \nhis electro-distruptor rifle.  &lt;Maximals!  We are under attack!  Perimeter \nguards, converge on my energy signature!&gt; Smokescreen yelled into the com, \nrunning as fast as he could for the cliff where the Predacons and Cyber Claw \nwere.\n\n---\n\nBeachcomber felt the explosion of Injector&#39;s missile, not very much though.  \nBut his suspicious were confirmed by Smokescreen&#39;s transmission.  Raising his \nrifle, he charged out of the armory, heading for Smokescreen&#39;s signature.\n\n"}}
