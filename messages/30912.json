He transforms and pulls out his grenade launcher,\n&gt; but before he can start a fire fight, a blast of powerful energy hits him\n&gt; in the side, sending him flying. Another large blast can be heard, and the\n&gt; same type of fusion energy rockets towards Rippersnapper.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sinnertwin falls into a few trees a bit of a way off, and hits hard. His\n&gt; body still smoking from the blast, but no real damage done to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
