They had thought, well all \nof them but Cinder, that Striker and his team were gone, yet at least Prowl \nhad survived. They had worried the most about him, for the same reason as \nthe one that caused Cinder&#39;s face to be redder than her natural coloring \nright now, though Prowl didn&#39;t seem to notice.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re all ok. Someone told us that you&#39;re the only one of Striker&#39;s team \nleft on the planet?&quot; Mantle&#39;s statement was a question, because he wasn&#39;t \nsure. He had other friends on Striker&#39;s team, and he hoped that they wern&#39;t \nall gone.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
