Nemesis Enforcer, your current \nleader, orders a strike against the Ark!  All forces assemble outside of the \nbase, I repeat, all forces, assemble outside of the base!&quot;\n\n---\n\nOinker got up from his recharge bed.  &quot;Alright, time fer sum action!&quot; he \nyelled, running out of his room for the outside like he had been ordered.\n\n---\n\nZergling got up.  &quot;My loyalty, is at the current leaders service.&quot; he said, \nextending his claws out by 5 inches, running for where he was ordered to go.\n\n---\n\nPunch raised his rifle, walking out of the Alliance base, waiting.\n\n\n===\n\nUnitron was closing in on the Alliance base.

Requesting permission to fire!&quot; he yelled as his \ninternal targeting systems got a lock.\n\n&quot;FIRE!&quot; Dark One yelled with an evil smile.\n\nA large shell erupted from the cannon, the explosive shell heading for the \ncannon that Rodimus Prime and Spears were attempting to repair.\n\n---\n\nHiss took out his missile launcher, taking aim.  He fired off a rocket at the \nnewly applied plating of the Ark.\n\n---\n\nPyro transformed to his tank mode, firing off three fire balls that would \n&quot;explode&quot; on impact at the Ark.\n\n---\n\nScavenger transformed to his HUMVEE mode, opening fire on the Ark with three \nlaser blasts from his cannon, and a total of 50 explosive shells (25 from \neach machine gun mounted on his side, which is two in total).\n\n---\n\nDark One transformed into his jet fighter mode, activating his engines, \nrolling on the ground.
