He had almost drained the field of its operational power.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You&#39;d believe any lie I could tell you.  Explains why you&#39;re just a\n&gt; follower!&quot;\n\nMyrmidon said nothing, the level of respect he had for Malice had\ndrained away. He had thought originally that perhaps they had brought a\nnew change, perhaps a road to honor and glory, a more aggressive stance\nfor Predacons and Decepticons, but instead he could see from Malice\nthat they were only frenzied fighters with nothing else to add. \n\n&gt; He modified and discharged the energy he had drained back into the\n&gt; barrier to overload it and force it down.  He stepped through the\n&gt; doorway and looked Myrmidon straight in the optic.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Get out of my way, follower. I have to go do the job you fools\n&gt; refuse to do.&quot;\n\nMyrmidon didn&#39;t move, his response was simple and direct! His motar\ncannons were already primed and ready, so as soon as the shielding\ndropped he opened fire, any words Malice had to say fell on deaf audio\nreceptors as the doorway where Malice stood was filled with Myrmidon&#39;s\nexplosive fury!\n\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
