There was a part of him that wanted to =\r\nblast the little Predacon for daring to tell him anything. But the ugly thi=\r\nng was that Zarak still needed the extra forces that Hydras and his Predaco=\r\nns brought to the table.\n\nSo rather than commanding his Scorponok unit to o=\r\npen fire on the base he just nodded and said, &quot;I apologize, I have overstep=\r\nped my place.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile Cyclonus and Scourge continued to face down Dark =\r\nRodimus, the air was tense as Dark Rodimus&#39; optics stared into Cyclonus, ni=\r\nether of them ready to back down, both of them remembering the last battle =\r\nthey fought!\n\nHowever it was Perceptor that broke the deadlock as he contin=\r\nued giving orders . . . \n\n(PASTE)\n\n&gt; The rest, we have to Keep an eye in ma=\r\nximal base things are becoming\n&gt; interesting lately there, Rodimus... I nee=\r\nd you for task&quot;\n\nThe affect of the command was almost instant as Rodimus st=\r\nepped back from Cyclonus and Scourge and looked over at Perceptor. &quot;What&#39;ch=\r\na need Percy?&quot; Rodimus said to Perceptor, happy for the moment that it was =\r\nPerceptor and Hydras giving orders and not Cyclonus and his lap dog.\n\nCyclo=\r\nnus, seeing the break in the tension also stepped back, pulling Scourge bac=\r\nk with him. &quot;There will be another time Scourge.&quot; he said quietly, &quot;No need=\r\n to fight this out here.&quot;\n\nScourge nodded, &quot;Yes, there will be.&quot; he said da=\r\nrkly. His optics still watched Rodimus, his look almost hungry as he smiled=\r\n evilly.\n\nAs the tensions between Cyclonus, Scourge and Rodimus cooled Zara=\r\nk turned to look at Tuscon, wondering what information this bot could hold.=\r\n &quot;Come&quot; Zarak said to Darkhawk, &quot;Let&#39;s see what this Auto . . . &quot;\n\n*BEEP*\n\n=\r\nZarak was caught in mid sentence by his scanner going off, the hand held on=\r\ne that he had been keeping trained on Tuscon. He glanced down at it, a curi=\r\nous look on his face. For some reason it was registering a life sign where =\r\nthere had been none before. It was located somewhere near Tuscon&#39;s head.\n\nZ=\r\narak stepped forward to take a more careful scan . . .\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: Yup, th=\r\ne same scanner he had been scanning him with a few posts ago. It is still o=\r\nut and processing :) \n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus/Zarak)\n\n\n"}}
