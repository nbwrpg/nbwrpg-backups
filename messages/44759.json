I know I&#39;m not on the \nCouncil, but I think the rules should be:\n1. Anyone NOT running for Council (that includes those already \nelected) can ask a cantidate any question NOT concerning his life off \nthe computer or in other rpgs.\n2. No cantidate may question ANYTHING of another cantidate, although \nhe may use replies of others to attack them in his campaign.\n3. Anyone elected who then goes back on his word will be removed from \nthe council.\n\nLet me start:\n\nNemasis, I don&#39;t mean to sound like I&#39;m attacking you, but at an \nearlier date you said that Shadow Star doesn&#39;t exist because he goes \nagainst your idea of Transformer physics although no one agreed with \nyou and he has been accepted into the game. Would you be out for \nrevenge looking for any reason to ban me for this? (I thought and I \nthought but I couldn&#39;t come up with a less rude way to put it, I just \nthink I&#39;ve learned my lesson and don&#39;t want a guy on the council \nbanning me for breathing)\n\n\n"}}
