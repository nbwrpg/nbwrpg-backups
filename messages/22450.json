He knelt down to her bunk \nside to stay with her.\n\nHe instantly forgot about the offspring, leaving her in the hallway \nfor her own devises. He rested his head by Black Arachnia&#39;s putting \nhis arm under his head to support it. He wanted to stay by her to \nmake sure she came round. He was very protective of her. \n\nHe closed his optics a few times and fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\nQuasar looked over, and saw the arachnid pair resting. What was she \nsupposed to do now? The male just told her to follow him, and he \ndidn&#39;t say much afterwards. He never explained to her where she was, \nwho she was, or what she was. Maybe that was suppose to be up to her. \nOr maybe she was supposed to wait.\n\nThere was something about the two that told her to wait for them. \nSlowly and quietly she walked into the room and sat down by the end \nof the bunk and leaned against it. \n\n\n"}}
