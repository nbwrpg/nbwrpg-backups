She thought about how Quickstrike made her \nfeel earlier.  She wondered if she could have her programmming changed so \nshe would not feel this way.  Something about him made her feel \nuncomfortable.  Like she owed him something.  Like she was supposed to pay \nhim back for something.  And yet she could not think of what it was.  She \nkind of liked him. And at the same time, she feared him. She started to \nsmile at the thought of him standing there talking to the other bot. She \nshook her head.  She knew that getting close ment getting hurt. But \nsomething about him drove her logic circuits crazy. He also put butterflies \nin her stomach.  Why the hech should she even care.  He was the second in \ncommand.  He could have any female bot he wanted.  Yet, she had this \noverwhelming urge just to want to talk to him. What was wrong with her, she \nthought.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
