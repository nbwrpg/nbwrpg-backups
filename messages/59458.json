He \nreturned to his quarters and reclined on his slightly small bed.\n&lt;A group of mercenaries, huh?  Part of one of the mercenary guilds \nmaybe?  Some mercenaries.  Probly a bunch youngsters.  Mercenaries \ndoing charity work like this is nice and all, but dragging a bunch \nhere isn&#39;t going to work very well.&gt;\nHe opened the storage locker and pulled out one of the energon shards \nand began to noisily crunch on it.\n&lt;Its going to be more difficult than I thought.  Overboard mercenary, \nAWOL Maximal turned Predacon, what the hell is going on here?&gt;\nHis thouights drifted further back to when he had his first encounter \nwith Wolfblade.  He cracked a small smile, a rare thing for him, be \ncause she reminded him of Organics.  They acted the same way, same \nattitude.  Maybe Primus reincarnated he as Wolfblade. He dismissed \nthe notion and continued to crunch the energon shard.  he shortly \nfinished and remained in his quarters.     \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Well I think that you should wait that Azure post that his \nchar \n&gt; left the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Nighlight started to feel uneasy, she had the feeling that things \n&gt; was leading to a danger for all\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;When I want a child&#39;s lip, I&#39;ll be sure and ask for it kid.  \n&gt; Right now I don&#39;t think Rodimus should take a chance like this.  \n&gt; Your stranded, low on supplies; you can&#39;t afford to take a risk, \n&gt; even in the name of honour.&quot; Malice said to Dragos.  &quot;I would have \n&gt; detained him and cure his illness while he was offline.
