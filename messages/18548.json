Gets on Complink: Maximals attack at Vector 001A. Koj \ngets a Target Lock and Fires 7 Freezing Ninja stars at Prebon. &quot;Did you \nthink you could be a member of the Dragon Clan at stealth.&quot; Koj spins the \nFang in defensive stance.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
