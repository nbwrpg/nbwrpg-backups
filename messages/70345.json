If you do not comply, you will leave me no choice=\r\n but to force an attack on your kind, which is the last thing I want to do.=\r\n  So, it&#39;s either you let Rodimus go, or you face a war against us and lose=\r\n many more lives needlessly. &quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot;Yeah, C&#39;mon, we&#39;re a=\r\nll sick of fighting and maybe just maybe you&#39;ll get something in return for=\r\n being a good sport.&quot;\n\nThey wait for the queen&#39;s reply.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor/Talon:\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor and=\r\n talon aimed and where ready for everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Listen&quot;said teh Femme&quot;We=\r\n only want Rodimus, give him to us and we will \n&gt; depart&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n&gt; From: &quot;Preston Carroll&quot; &lt;supercycl=\r\nonus@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 27, 2010 5:35 AM\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Into the Darkness\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Perceptor said &quot;He should bet=\r\nter be alright, I havent risked my sking for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; naught&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; After T=\r\nhat he continued opening fire against the insectiods Alliens, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Talon\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; did the same\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Perceptor, Talon and Legacy continued firin=\r\ng on the insectoid\n&gt; &gt; creatures, and as Tuscon continued to pick up the pa=\r\nce they are\n&gt; &gt; quickly left behind as the group quickly covers the last of=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; distance between them and where Rodimus has been kept.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The=\r\ny come to a vast chamber, one that makes all the others the group\n&gt; &gt; has b=\r\neen through seem small. Nearly 250 feet across and high it was a\n&gt; &gt; near p=\r\nerfect semi circular room all the way around. All around the\n&gt; &gt; room, star=\r\nting from 30 feet off the floor the walls were lined with\n&gt; &gt; cave entrance=\r\ns, each of them perhaps five feet wide, hundreds of them\n&gt; &gt; all around the=\r\n room and stretching high towards the domed ceiling. At\n&gt; &gt; floor level of =\r\nthe chamber there are several larger cave openings\n&gt; &gt; which lead off in di=\r\nfferent directions much like the one that the\n&gt; &gt; group was entering from.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the center of the room a large column, stretching from floor to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; ceiling and nearly 30 feet thick at the base. About 100 feet up there\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; appears to be some sort of small metal chamber that has been\n&gt; &gt; haphaza=\r\nrdly affixed to the column with some sort of adhesive. the\n&gt; &gt; chamber is a=\r\nbout 10 feet tall and perhaps 4 feet wide or so. Upon\n&gt; &gt; closer inspection=\r\n one could see that it is a recharging chamber, and\n&gt; &gt; it is from inside t=\r\nhis that Rodimus&#39; signal can be detected.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However high up, near the=\r\n top of that column near the ceiling is a\n&gt; &gt; much larger version of the in=\r\nsectile creatures that you have seen. It\n&gt; &gt; looks about identical to the o=\r\nthers with four forelegs, each ending in\n&gt; &gt; sharply barbed blades, eight l=\r\negs that went along the side of the\n&gt; &gt; body, and a scorpion like tail, alt=\r\nhough the abdomen is larger, and\n&gt; &gt; overall it appeared to be 30 tall.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Maximals, Autobots and Predacon&quot; the creature said as it&#39;s wings\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbuzzed, the voice definitely sounded female. &quot;Your companion has had\n&gt; &gt; mu=\r\nch to teach and is about to become a most delicious snack. But it is\n&gt; &gt; go=\r\nod that you have come, you can become the main course!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The creatur=\r\ne spread her wings, dropped from her high perch and took\n&gt; &gt; off to the air=\r\n as she chuckled evilly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
