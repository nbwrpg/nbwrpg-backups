She knew now why Iron Raptor ws the leader.  &quot;As =\r\nfar as \nwhere it is, it is being held in Voluis&#39;s embassy.  I will give you=\r\n \nthe co-ordinants later on.  As fas as who will be there, the other \nmaixi=\r\nmal leader and the Predacon leaders.  All the group leaders are \nbeing invi=\r\nted to attend.  You may bring one or two bots that you \ntrust with you if y=\r\nou wish.  We will be giving each leader thier own \nquarters and so on.  And=\r\n complete privacy before and after each talk \nsession.  How long with will =\r\ntake, that I am not sure of.  Allt he \ngroups have been warring for some ti=\r\nme.  So it may take a while.&quot;   \nShe stopped and smiled at Iron Raptor.  &quot;B=\r\nut wouldn&#39;t it be worth the \ntime?  Please consider it.  I have tried hard =\r\nto help these talks \nbecome successful.  Please, help us to bring peace to =\r\nthe groups.  It \nwould mean an end to the war.&quot;\n\nShe was honest and sincere=\r\n.  She ws truely worried that she wouldn&#39;t \nattend the talks.  She wanted, =\r\nmore than anything, to bring about the \nend of the war and have peace among=\r\n the groups.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor doesn&#39;t notice Kluster&#39;s wondering eyes,\nsimpl=\r\ny \nsmiling back \n&gt; at him as he had done to her.

She \ntook a \n&gt; step towards her but then =\r\nthe fembot came to her with what she had \nbeen sent \n&gt; there to tell her, i=\r\nt being more important then she had realized it \ncould \n&gt; ever be.\n&gt; Peace =\r\ntalks!\n&gt; Just then Iron Raptor saw Prowl move in the corner of her eye but =\r\n\nthen \n&gt; slightly side stepped to assure that his arm didn&#39;t slip around \nh=\r\ner, knowing \n&gt; that he was going to learn his lesson about teasing.\n&gt; A low=\r\n growl flowed from her throat as she had moved from Prowls \nadvance, \n&gt; bas=\r\nically saying that he still wasn&#39;t allowed to touch\nher=85yet.\n&gt; But her ex=\r\npression didn&#39;t change, still calm and slightly\ncheerful \nas she \n&gt; continu=\r\ned to focus her attention on Battera.\n&gt; \n&gt; But when Battera began to explai=\r\nn what she had come for, Iron \nRaptor&#39;s \n&gt; expression turned from kind to b=\r\nlank.\n&gt; She thought that she was busy before=85now she was required to \nacc=\r\nompany this \n&gt; bot and another to Peace Talks?\n&gt; It was just one thing afte=\r\nr another around here, wasn&#39;t it?\n&gt; Slag!
