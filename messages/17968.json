By the way it swung its tail it \nseemed as i=\r\nf \n&gt; no, but there was always a way.\n&gt; However, even as she watched this cr=\r\neature something moving caught \nher \n&gt; attention, besides the moving tail o=\r\nf the scorpion.\n&gt; It was another of those 2 legged things, only slimmer and=\r\n faster.( \nFeline)\n&gt; Rage snapped her head and twisted her body in it&#39;s dir=\r\nection as\nit \n&gt; approached quickly, her neck sweeping forward and her jaws =\r\nopening \n&gt; wide=85coming inches towards the creatures middle.\n&gt; This wasn&#39;t=\r\n a simple voyage of curiosity anymore, it was life\nand \ndeath=85and \n&gt; she =\r\nhad no intent of dying!\n&gt; These things that swarmed out of the metal struct=\r\nure were like \nants, savage \n&gt; and quick to defend.\n&gt; But she was surrounde=\r\nd by these things and couldn&#39;t get away,\nso \nshe had no \n&gt; choice but to fi=\r\nght and protect herself.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n________________________________________=\r\n______________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN=\r\n Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself,=\r\n create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
