Literally!&quot; she yelled.\n\nHell Drak moved up, and fired a lazer disc at the right wing.  Triggerhappy\nwas spiraling and moving all around, but Hell Drak held on tight.\nTriggerhappy&#39;s wing was farely damaged, and now Triggerhappy had lost\nbalance, and was now losing altitude because of lack of balance.  Hell Drak\nwas beginning to get annoyed because Lurker is failing to use pronouns, so I\nwill use them now.  Hell Drak held onto the end, and she was trying to bring\nthe Decepticon downwards.  If Blowpipe tried to interfere, he would be\ntoast.  Hell Drak brought Triggerhappy down, but then, he transformed to\nrobot mode, and so it looked like Hell Drak was humping him or something.\nTriggerhappy shoved her onto the ground, then he grabbed her throat, and put\nhis gun to her head, ready to shoot......\n\n&lt;AzureBlade, this is your queue!&gt;\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, October 08, 2001 10:39 PM\nSubject: Re: Attack!\n\n\n&gt; AzureBlade:\n&gt; Let&#39;s make a bet, lady (to Hell drak).

So did\n&gt; &gt; Blowpipe, and Blowpipe rolled to the side and fired two lazer shots\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; Orion.  Triggerhappy was met by Orion and Sideswipe&#39;s shots.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, slag it, I&#39;m gonna ki-&quot; Triggerhappy stopped, &quot;AAIIEEE!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Triggerhappy gets a not-so-warm welcome from AzureBlade&#39;s plasma\n&gt; shots, and\n&gt; &gt; Triggerhappy stumbled forward.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Cheeeaaappppp shhhooottttt!!!!  RAAAHH!&quot; Triggerhappy yelled.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Triggerhappy&#39;s bad day got worse.  Necromancer appeared beside\n&gt; Orion, and\n&gt; &gt; Hell Drak appeared by AzureBlade.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, let&#39;s f*** up this creep!&quot; Hell Drak said to AzureBlade.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Decepticon enemy, this is your last chance to surr-&quot; Before\n&gt; Necromancer\n&gt; &gt; could finish, Triggerhappy had transformed into jet mode, and flew\n&gt; up and\n&gt; &gt; fired a photon shot from his right cannon at Necromancer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Attack,&quot; Necromancer yelled, &quot;For the Maximals!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Necromancer fired 3 lazer discs at Triggerhappy.  Hell Drak fired\n&gt; two shots\n&gt; &gt; at Blowpipe, but Necromancer&#39;s shots missed, and so did Hell Drak&#39;s,\n&gt; because\n&gt; &gt; Triggerhappy swooped down, cockpit open, and Blowpipe jumped in, and\n&gt; &gt; Triggerhappy went back up and closed the cockpit.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Surgital ignored Alpha Dolphy, he fired a saw blade at Ice.  Then,\n&gt; he turned\n&gt; &gt; around, and fired a big energon net down at Orion and Sideswipe.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Cutthroat saw them attacking, and transformed to creature mode, then\n&gt; flew\n&gt; &gt; over and began trying to keep violently lash out with beak, wings\n&gt; and talons\n&gt; &gt; at Orion, trying to rip him to pieces.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
