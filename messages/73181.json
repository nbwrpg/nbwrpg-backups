Then, something that Magm=\r\natron said sparks an idea in Tucsons directory.  What if he could actually =\r\ngive Magmatron the grand illusion and make it appear that he would turn on =\r\nhis comrades while in reality pulling off the most strategic illusion of be=\r\ntrayal and winning his faction a very strategic victory?  Instead of growli=\r\nng at Magmatron he stops fighting and nods in submission.  \n\n&quot; You win Magm=\r\natron, I can see that your skills far outweigh my own.  But I can also see =\r\nthat in some strange way, we complement each other.  We are both powerful i=\r\nn our own right and if WE wanted to, we could have this planet all to ourse=\r\nlves. &quot;\n\nStraightshots jaw drops as do those of Rattrap and Quickstride.\n\n&quot;=\r\nWHAT?!

TUCSON ARE YOU CRAZY!?&quot;\n\nRattrap squeaks in shock.\n\n&quot; YOU CAN=\r\n&#39;T DO THAT WINGS,  YOU&#39;RE BETTER THAN THAT SLAG BALL! &quot;\n\nQuickstride snorts=\r\n.\n\n&quot; IF YOU TURN TAIL ON US NOW WE&#39;RE SLAGGED!  IS HE OUT OF HIS PROCESSOR!=\r\n?&quot;\n\nTucson turns to face them.   He then says something to Straightshot in =\r\nsign language which she nods to.\n\n&quot; Shhh.... Guys...  It&#39;s okay.  He&#39;s tryi=\r\nng something out of the box, way out of the box.   I hope it works.  &quot;\n\nTuc=\r\nson gives her a wink and then turns back to Magmatron, waiting for his resp=\r\nonse.\n\nLocal artist who specializes in illustration, using traditional and =\r\ndigital media.  \n\nI also specialize in hand made crafts.

Each one moderately damaged, VICE GRIP moreso.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; DINOBOT paused=\r\n, then went to charge in over towards SKYBYTE.

And reduce you to as much scrap of the rest\n&gt;&gt; of =\r\nthem!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Menawhile, VICE GRIP transformed to try and let his autorepai=\r\nr systems\n&gt;&gt; work..\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Slowly VICE GRIP=E2=80=99s autorepair s=\r\nystems began to engage. They were\n&gt; sluggish and hesitant as they scanned o=\r\nver his systems and he began to\n&gt; take full stock of the damage that had be=\r\nen done, and then a\n&gt; combination of repair nanites and what might pass for=\r\n biological\n&gt; repairs started to be put to work.\n&gt; \n&gt; On his internal syste=\r\nms many fault and errors were flashing across his\n&gt; systems, ones that coul=\r\nd more easily be repair in a CR chamber, but\n&gt; could if necessary be done b=\r\ny the self repair process.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile as DINOBOT reached melee range wi=\r\nth SKYBYTE, the first thing\n&gt; that registered on SKYBYTE=E2=80=99s face was=\r\n shock and then a sense of\n&gt; determination, and lastly was a look of a pain=\r\n as DINOBOT=E2=80=99s slash hit\n&gt; him, while hot in the face, squarely acro=\r\nss the chest, and sent him\n&gt; reeling backwards!\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=9CNo! It should=\r\nn&#39;t be like this!&quot; SKYBYTE said, a bit of panic rising\n&gt; in his voice. &quot;I w=\r\nill kill you, I will kill you all!&quot; He pulled out\n&gt; his blade and stabbed v=\r\nisciously at DINOBOT!\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tucson was in pain but he knew he =\r\nhad to keep on his toes if he was to get\n&gt;&gt; out of this battle in one piece=\r\n.  He had to figure out a way to get\n&gt;&gt; Magmatron to literally take a few h=\r\nits but through indirect means.  He\n&gt;&gt; thinks to himself as to how to go ab=\r\nout doing so.  But then, it comes to\n&gt;&gt; him.  The old dragon must have had =\r\nmany friends among the Natural world,\n&gt;&gt; including the cavern where they we=\r\nre now.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; When all else fails, turn to those who are your most trust=\r\ned followers.\n&gt;&gt; No matter their size, what lives among you in Nature, can =\r\nprove to be your\n&gt;&gt; greatest  comrades.  I get it now.   I know what I must=\r\n do.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Straightshot stops the music, as she watches her brother lift =\r\nhis head and\n&gt;&gt; begin to emit a soft rumble from his throat.  Yet the pitch=\r\n of the sound is\n&gt;&gt; too high for normal ears, it is well received by throng=\r\ns of cave dwelling\n&gt;&gt; bats that swarm out in clouds of activity.  He hoped =\r\nthat they would be\n&gt;&gt; enough to throw Magmatron for a loop.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Quickstr=\r\nide tries desperately to fend off the remaining Sharkitcons while\n&gt;&gt; Rattra=\r\np lends him a hand in doing so.  It&#39;s at this time when bats cover the\n&gt;&gt; a=\r\nir around them.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Whoah!  Where&#39;d these things come from?!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; T=\r\nhey learn to sidestep the bats yet the tiny creatures continue to swarm!\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; MAGMATRON laughed, =E2=80=9CBats!?

The BLACK PRIME who had been holding DARK RODIMUS=\r\n by the\n&gt; throat merely dropped to the ground at his feet as he smiled\n&gt; ex=\r\nultantly.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; That had a series of furious BACKPEDALS over f=\r\nrom the shocked PREDACONS then\n&gt;&gt; as the melee seemed to sweep around, DINO=\r\nBOT nearly pausing from his brutal\n&gt;&gt; exchange of blows with SKYBYTE with a=\r\n &#39;WHAT THE SLAG&#39; sort of expression on\n&gt;&gt; his face..\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Along wtih VICE=\r\n GRIP, who was trying to dig himself a small dugout to hide\n&gt;&gt; in.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; T=\r\nhen, as the explosions carried through..\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Shooting thorugh the tunnel=\r\n entrance up above, to HIT NEMESIS PRIME on the\n&gt;&gt; head came WASPINATOR&#39;S S=\r\nCALP.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Assuming he impacted and styaed there, WASPINATOR moaned, &quot;Oww=\r\niez..
