This new body was \namazing! He looks forward, swirling just in time to avoid a mountain \npeak. They were now flying over a mountain range, 350 mph and \nspeeding up.\n\nProwl&#39;s excitement finally clears enough for him to hear Iron \nRaptor&#39;s thoughts. His eyes widen. He didn&#39;t realize that this would \nscare her so much!\n\nThe Maximal could feel Iron Raptor hanging on to him, her body \npressed against his. He could feel how fast her sparkbeat was, along \nwith the fear she was feeling. Even thought the feel of her body \npressing into his excited him, he didn&#39;t like freaking her out. Prowl \nslows down as he recieves her thought. She didn&#39;t sound very happy.\n\nThe two clear the mountain range, now going only about 150 mph. He \nhears her tell him to land.\n\nBefore he realizes that it might scare her, Prowl cuts off his \nboosters. The momentuum carries the two bots forward for a few \nseconds before sending them tumbling down toward the earth. The world \nspun around Prowl as the ground neared...\n\nHe reactivates his boosters at the last second, stabalizing and \nlanding on his feet. Prowl loosens his arms around Iron Raptor, \nhoping she wouldn&#39;t kill him for that flight.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm chuckles, smiling as he watches Prowl and Iron Raptor \ndissapear in the distance.\n\n&quot;Maybe. I&#39;d hate to be the bot racing him, though!&quot;\n\nFirearm transforms into tank mode and drives up to Iris. &quot;Hop on and \nhang on tight, this might be a bumpy ride.&quot;\n\nHe laughs. &quot;I don&#39;t think I can make it as good as he did, but I&#39;ll \ntry my best!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor glanced towards Iris for a moment before looking back \ntowards \n&gt; Prowl.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Well, I was never a fast learner anyway.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * A last glance was exchanged between Iris mand Iron Raptor before \nProwl \n&gt; responded and slid his arm around her and took a strong hold.\n&gt; She didn&#39;t really like flying, but she guessed that since she had \nbeen given \n&gt; wings she might as well get use to it.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Remember, Iris, right to the meeting.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris simply nodded and stood back a bit.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &lt; Yeah, yeah, I know. But YOU remember, don&#39;t let the \nfeatherhead get \n&gt; all the glory from now on. And if you aren&#39;t back by morning I&#39;m \ncoming to \n&gt; look for you.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor was just about to begin arguing once again when she \nheard \n&gt; Prowls&#39; bosters power up, sliding her arms around his neck.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Fine.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Was all she was able to get out before Prowl took off, closing \nher eyes \n&gt; tightly, the air feeling as if she was constantly being hit by a \nwall. Her \n&gt; sensors detecting their speed, 100 mph!\n&gt; Iron Raptor was almost basically plastered to Prowl, and it wasn&#39;t \njust the \n&gt; pressure of the air either. They were high and going very fast, \nwhich was \n&gt; sending her speak thumping in her chest at nearly the same speed as \nthey \n&gt; were flying.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Prowl! Slow down!&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * There was no use in speaking because, with their speed, her voice \nwould \n&gt; have been lost.\n&gt; Iron Raptor tightens her hold on Prowl a bit, opening her eyes \nslightly to \n&gt; look into his face.\n&gt; But then she heard his thought, and tightened her hold on him just \nas he had \n&gt; instructed. But why?\n&gt; Seconds later she found out.\n&gt; The ground was rushing up towards them, and she knew that Prowl was \nexcited \n&gt; and all, but her spark nearly stopped from fright alone as he \nsuddenly \n&gt; bankes up from the ground. Her mind seemingly consumed by the white \nhot \n&gt; light which obviously resembled her fear.\n&gt; This wasn&#39;t fun at all! It wasn&#39;t funny either!\n&gt; She whimpered a little and shook visably, obviously it was clear \nthat she \n&gt; had been scared out of her mind.\n&gt; Battles she could take, beasts she could handle, even pain she had \nno \n&gt; problem with, but heights....\n&gt; There wasn&#39;t anything else in the world she hated more then hights.\n&gt; Iron Raptor breathed hard and tried to calm her spark, finding it \nrather \n&gt; difficult.\n&gt; Her eyes became a little wet but the air dried them before she had \na chance \n&gt; to shed a tear, obviously desturbed.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Prowl...slow down.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * That was the only thought she could get out, the remainder of her \nmind \n&gt; still recovering from the extreme shock she felt moments before.\n&gt; She hated heights, and Prowl had only made it worse.\n&gt; How could she ever learn to fly if Prowl scared her witless like \nthis?\n&gt; But she regained her composure, even though her mind was still \nreeling. But \n&gt; finally she decided that she didn&#39;t want her friends to see her \nshaken up \n&gt; like this, her own body still physically shaking.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Land a ways from the site.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; ____________________________________IRIS\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris only watched as Prowl took off, knowing for a fact that Iron \nRaptor \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t like it one bit.\n&gt; Then seeing, in the distance, Prowl take a dive towards the land \nand then \n&gt; continue on his way towards the new ship.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Fool! &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But then she looked towards Firearm as he spoke, narrowing her \noptics at \n&gt; him from under her helm.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Knows how to fly, my tin plated ass! All he knows how to do is \nscare that \n&gt; woman slagless!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
