She opened her wings and flapped them to maintain balance.  \nShe felt a strong breeze pick up and she took to the wind.  She \nhovered above Lunarpine and the tree fell down.  She stayed at the \nsame height as the tree branch was before the tree fell.  She pulled \nout a rock from ehr sachel, took it into her beak and dropped it \nagain aiming for his tail this time.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Luckily Lunarpine stepped forward so the stone hit him in the back \n&gt; instead of the head.He didn&#39;t smell any nuts or seeds so he only \nhad \n&gt; one conclusion &quot;Maximize&quot;, he shouted as he transformed, turned and \n&gt; slashed the base of the tree causeing it to tumble forward. as it \n&gt; fell he jumped up the side toward Shadow Wings scent. he knew he \nhad \n&gt; to move fast so she couldn&#39;t fly off.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
