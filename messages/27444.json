He activates his comm.\n\n&quot;DevilDuer, a new bot&#39;s just nearby. Can you go investigate it?&quot; he \nsays into his comm.

Cinders still \nhung in the\n&gt; air as the flam on a nearby branch crackled like the hands of a \nthousand\n&gt; clocks whose voices were stolen by the winds of time. The world \nstood still\n&gt; as a mound of ash quivered and opened on all sides to admit a \nsolitary\n&gt; figure entrance into the world of air and land that was Earth. As \nthe figure\n&gt; stood, its visibility became less and less opaque until it was \ncompletely\n&gt; invisible, but the last image had it moving just south of the \nsetting sun,\n&gt; as the golden disk set over the mountains of the land which would \none day be\n&gt; known as Spain.\n\n\n"}}
