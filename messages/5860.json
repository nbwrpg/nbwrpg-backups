Sinister nodded to him.\n\n&quot;We have been asigned as the assassins, and you will be on our hitlist\nbefore long, now, what we&#39;re you saying again?&quot; Sinister said. Sinesis and\nSinister gave each other thumbs up and smiled, and then they walked back a\nfew feet and dropped into their chairs again.\n\n&quot;Our performance is spectacular!&quot; Sinesis commented.\n\n&quot;None better than us!&quot; Sinister said.\n\n&quot;Wanna join us?&quot; Sinesis asked KitKat, holding up some dead animal and\ntaking a bite of it. Sinister laughs.\n\n&quot;You are awesome!&quot; Sinister said.\n\n&quot;Yeah, I know!&quot; Sinesis said. They smiled and poured themselves some wine.\n\n&quot;This stuff is supposed to have alchohol in it.&quot; Sinesis said.\n\n&quot;Yeah, it could impair your driving.&quot; Sinister said. They paused for a\nwhile.\n\n&quot;Lets drink it!&quot; Sinister said. They both drunk their glasses down and\nstared a bit dumbfounded.\n\n&quot;That was weird!&quot; Sinesis said. They both stared and started to drink the\nentire bottle. Before long they were both asleep smiling...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, July 05, 2000 7:13 PM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt;\n&gt; She watching Sinesis ans Sinister acting like complete twits.

She wondered that if Megatron let\n&gt; them join into the group, then how good were they really.   But something\n&gt; told her not to find out.
