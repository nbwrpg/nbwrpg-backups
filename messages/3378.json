Hitting the ground, he cried out in pain, rolling to take away some of \nthe pain, facing down so it didn&#39;t continue to burn inwardly of him.\n\n----\n\nCounter Punch laughed as the Maximal (Triceradon) had fallen from his attack. \n Beginning to turn, numerous shots sent him flying back 5 feet due to his \nunstable standing (from having one foot up, and one foot down while walking).\n\n----\n\nInjector had seen Counter Punch fall from Stegotron&#39;s attacks.  Raising his \noptics so Stegotron was in perfect view, he fired a single green optic blast \nat Stegotron&#39;s chest, simultaneously firing three stinger missiles from his \nhand-held launcher.\n\n----\n\nManterror was laughing, but stumbled back, falling on his butt when Striker \nopened fire.  &lt;Double Punch, get your skid plate over here!  To many Maximals \nare arriving&gt;\n\n~Acknowledged~ Double Punch replied, getting out the bridge of the Pred ship \nand charging off towards Manterror&#39;s location, cloaking into his stealth mode.\n\nManterror saw Striker turn to open fire at Mosquitor.  &quot;Perfect.&quot; his \ncracking into a smile.  Raising his arms, he fired two ion disks at Striker&#39;s \nside.  Simultaneously firing a single ion disk at Dark Mouse&#39;s torso (the \ntorso counts as the head, chest, and abdomen, abdomen is the region of the \nbody that the stomach is in).\n\n"}}
