She looked at the soil,\n&gt; tears stringing at her eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Damn those automatic tear ducts. She couldn&#39;t cry now! Not in front\n&gt; of someone! Her father had always given her hell for even -looking-\n&gt; sad.\n&gt;\n&gt; She blinked them away angrily, and looked back up. &quot;Okay fine, I&#39;m\n&gt; selfish. I can&#39;t be trusted. I am totally dishonost&quot; Her voice\n&gt; carried undercurrents of hopelessness. &quot;Is that what you want to\n&gt; hear?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Her voice cracked at the last sentence. She couldn&#39;t believe she was\n&gt; argueing with Carnage! This couldn&#39;t be happening.\n&gt;\n&gt; But in the back of her mind, something nagged at her. This anger\n&gt; hadn&#39;t all come from her just leaving. Well, yes, quite a lot of it\n&gt; was aimed at her, but there had to be something else. Maybe she\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t ask..\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to leave someone behind. Okay,\n&gt; fine, so you won&#39;t forgive me. I&#39;ve said I&#39;m sorry, and that&#39;s all I\n&gt; can do, short of making it up to you. Tell me what I can do to make\n&gt; it up, and I&#39;ll do it. Anything, I don&#39;t care. Grovel, Go up against\n&gt; the Pred army, anything. Please Carnage, I want to be friends again\n&gt; but we can&#39;t be friends again like this&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Depressed. That was the only word that sprang to mind when she tried\n&gt; to think about herself. Wow, she hadn&#39;t felt that emotion in.. ages.\n&gt; Teltoli found herself wishing that a huge big hole would come up and\n&gt; pull her into it, but she had to face this.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
