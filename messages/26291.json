How would he know that \nthough? Even if he had scanned, he would have only come up with a \nbunch of metal. But she had introduced this place as Alliance, so he \nmight have deduced it from that. She follows D, having no idea that \nshe had misunderstood him.\n\n&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s the Iron Fist,&quot; she says, walking alongside him. She \nwasn&#39;t used to such big beast modes. She notices his careful way of \nmovement. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, its not dangerous unless its told to be.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., tmrattrap@h... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hotmail is whacked, I&#39;ll post from egroups until things straighten \n&gt; out.\n&gt; \n&gt; * D, still with a puzzled expression, glanced towards Fenox with \n&gt; complete question as she reached out and touched his fur.\n&gt; In his life he had had the occasional pet from a passer by, so this \n&gt; was nothing new to him.\n&gt; His ears lifted from his head and moved towards her, flicking here \n&gt; and there to take in any other sounds. But there was something \nabout \n&gt; her that drew his attention, that just made him want to know more \n&gt; about this strange place and her included. But all in good time.\n&gt; D shifted his weight from paw to paw, looking towards the Iron Fist \n&gt; as Fenox pointed towards it.\n&gt; So that was called the Alliance Base? Interesting name.\n&gt; He focused back on the woman ahead of him, shifting again and \nfeeling \n&gt; his muscles move under his skin.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Alliance here...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * He gestured towards ground.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Iron Fist there...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Then gestured towards the ship. In his mind, the Alliance was the \n&gt; ground which the Iron Fist stood on. But he could be mistaken.\n&gt; D move out away from Fenox a bit, his head slightly lowered towards \n&gt; the ground, his shoulders moving and expressing just what sort of \n&gt; Prowl his creators had leashed inside of thos being.\n&gt; D may seem like he knew nothing but it turned out that he knew more \n&gt; then anyone could know, but not of this world.\n&gt; He began to move off towards the Iron Fist, wanting a closer look \nat \n&gt; it but not quite sure if it was safe.*\n\n\n"}}
