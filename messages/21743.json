He \nlooked her in the eyes, &quot;With our reputation in combat I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll \nbe saving each others hides more often.\n\nFoxfingers shook her hand. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure.&quot; he said, still in a bit \nof a shock from being moved. His thoughts were as quick as his escape \nrouts as one thought told him &quot;Leave me alone wench&quot; and then &quot;I love \na dominant creature.&quot; \n\nFoxfingers quickly sidestepped her making an excuse as he \ndid. &quot;Excuse me Ice, I must go um, help Veratis with the DNA.&quot; He \nscampered off toward the lab thinking &quot;Who&#39;s that mutant beast think \nshe is picking me up like that. Although I&#39;ll be sure she&#39;s around \nnext time I need a lockpick.&quot;\n\nLunarpine transformed to bot mode and stepped forward. &quot;Good to have \nyou back.&quot; His thoughts told his true feelings &quot;I&#39;ve missed you, I \nwas afraid for what I&#39;d gotten you into.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She smiled at him. She could tell he wasn&#39;t in a good mood. But she \n&gt; couldn&#39;t help but chuckle alittle. &quot;You need to wake up on the \nright \n&gt; side of the CR tank a little more often.&quot; She walked out of the lab \n&gt; and went wandering around the ship. She transformed into her knew \nbot \n&gt; mode and went looking for Lunarpine. She sensed his thoughts and \nwent \n&gt; through the ship looking for him. She found him and FoxFingers \n&gt; together. She smiled,&quot;Hello all. I finally got things worked out.&quot; \n&gt; She picked up FoxFingers with her Telekenesis and floated him over \nto \n&gt; her. She smiled and shook his hand. &quot;Hello there. I&#39;m Ice. Pleased \nto \n&gt; meet you.&quot; She set him down and looked over at Lunarpine. &quot;How are \n&gt; you feeling. I wanted to thank you for saving my life, again.&quot; she \n&gt; smiled and chuckled slightly. &quot;You know, you have this habit of \n&gt; saving my hide. I hope that oneday, I can return the favor.&quot; She \n&gt; projected this thought into his head,&quot;My love.&quot; so FoxFingers \n&gt; couldn&#39;t hear it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Veratis awoke in a start.&quot;Ice, please don&#39;t do that to me while \nI&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; sleeping.&quot; He lay back again but couldn&#39;t fall back to \n&gt; sleep. &quot;Alright you\n&gt; &gt; win, I&#39;m on my way.&quot; His chamber opened up and he stepped out. He \n&gt; wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; fully functional yet. he was beginning to wonder if giving her \nthis \n&gt; body was\n&gt; &gt; a mistake. She was the bear but it was him that was fealing \ngrumpy \n&gt; at the\n&gt; &gt; moment. He stepped to the replicator and created a reboost \ncompound \n&gt; (Roboyic\n&gt; &gt; coffee) he sucked it down and proceeded to the lab. He stepped in \n&gt; and saw\n&gt; &gt; the mess that the drones had created. &quot;Should I even bother to \nask \n&gt; what went\n&gt; &gt; on in here?&quot; He saw the two drones on the floor. &quot;Never mind, I \n&gt; don&#39;t want\n&gt; &gt; to know.&quot; He proceeded to the computer to see what the scans for \n&gt; the night\n&gt; &gt; had read. &quot;It seems you had a strong ECG reading for the night.&quot; \n&gt; Again the\n&gt; &gt; old science bot checked the mess in the room. &quot;Which would \nexplain \n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; mess.&quot; He checked all the readings multiple times to be sure of \nthe \n&gt; results.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It seems the virus is out of your system, you&#39;re free to go \noutside\n&gt; &gt; whenever you like. &quot;Preferably ASAP.&quot; his thoughts weren&#39;t easy \nto \n&gt; hide as\n&gt; &gt; he started programming the other drones to clean up the mess.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After his job was complete he decided that since he was already \n&gt; awake he&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; check the DNA that foxfingers hsd brought back. he had a grizzly \n&gt; bear, a\n&gt; &gt; wolf, and an extremely powerful raptor. those deffinitely had\n&gt; &gt; possabilities.The Dragon cells were an odd addition and (Whatever \n&gt; Tavatron\n&gt; &gt; turned into) could be set aside for now. He decided to start with \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; raptor. he programmed another protoform and began the procedure. \nHe \n&gt; tried to\n&gt; &gt; deprogram the parts of the DNA that were Transmetal2 technology. \nAs \n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; experiment he injected the virus once again. If Primes prophecy \nwas \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; become a reality he&#39;d need to make creatures to fit the \n&gt; description. &quot;All\n&gt; &gt; would become one&quot; and Translife and organics would join.\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 21, 2000 6:44 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: IceBird\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As she woke up, the drones stopped moving and fell to the \nfloor.  \n&gt; She\n&gt; &gt; &gt; got up and stretched and yawned.
