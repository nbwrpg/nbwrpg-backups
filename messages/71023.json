But \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do know that if we don&#39;t get back in, e=\r\nveryone&#39;s life is in danger, not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our lives and the Maximal=\r\ns, but also Optimus Prime, and the other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Autobots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that are sup=\r\npose to wake up a couple of million years from now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Be ready.=\r\n&quot; He said in serious tones. &quot;When Perceptor gives me the go\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ahead,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I will activate this device and we enter the Ark.&quot; He took a moment to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at each one of them, &quot;It is almost time.&quot; he said with a t=\r\none of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; finality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *At the battle*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OL=\r\nD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; All right. Let&#39;s - regro=\r\nup, as Noctorro has advised.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As he tries to stand up, he f=\r\ninds his condition too far advanced, as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; falls to his knee=\r\ns once more, unable to get up on his own. He finds just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough energy=\r\n to get into vehicle mode, seeing that this way, at least \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nould be towwed to saftey, rolling on wheels rather than being dragged,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; which would be difficult to do otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Here- in - th=\r\nis mode, it will - be easier for me - to ambulate.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Tuscon attempted to transform and move away with the help of the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; others,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Noctorro stands up, rising to his full and imposing hei=\r\nght! Not having\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the larger weapons, Noctorro does what =\r\nhe does best, he leapt into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fray, using his large horns an=\r\nd immense size to batter down as many of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons as he c=\r\nan.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the same time Torca, stands as well, his size actually a=\r\n few inches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taller and more massive than Noctorro! &quot;Silverbolt! Airha=\r\nmmer!&quot; Torca\n&gt; &gt; &gt; calls,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his voice booming across the battlefield. &quot;=\r\nAttack pattern theta 4!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With that Silverbot, who looked to be =\r\na cross between a wolf and an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; eagle,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Airhammer who looked =\r\nlike both shark and hawk move quickly through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; air, brining=\r\n their firepower out in an attempt to disorient the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For a moment it seems to have that sort of affect as the sweeps pull=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Phobia is forced to abort her next attack run as the=\r\n Fuzors make \n&gt; &gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presence known.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Waspinator a=\r\nnd Terrorsaur attempt to swing around to help, Bantor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fired\n&gt; &gt; &gt; se=\r\nveral shots from his weapon stepping out from the trees, surprise and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; firepower for the moment holding them at bay.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Torca =\r\nlooked over at Tuscon and the others and then turned back to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; batt=\r\nle, bringing his own Dorsal guns into play!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; In the battle field Talon continued moving and shooting, she didnt \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long could keep her enemis away, Kup watched h=\r\ner desperate situation \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open fire against the predacons=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras was really mad and said By comlink &quot;Perceptor alwa=\r\ny has more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trick in his sleeve...

FOLLoW ME!!!!&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predacon leader t=\r\nook off and with a devil smile he did a single shot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agains\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ta=\r\nlon, hitting her in one of her wings; Talon Scream in pain and start\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; falling to the ground while she struggling to keep her in air.=\r\n Then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Predacon leader started to leave the area.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras gets a message from Cyclonus, &quot;I cannot sto=\r\np the destruction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor has planned this too well.

And that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was enough to energize him just enough to get hi=\r\nm to roll quickly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; toward\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Talon, as he opens his cab doors =\r\nright beside her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Night Shift, get - Talon into my cab, no=\r\nw!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Skyshadow laughed as he watched Talon fal=\r\nl, &quot;Stay down!&quot; he said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; menacingly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as he oriented his weapon on=\r\n her downed form. &quot;This will only take a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mome\n&gt; &gt; &gt; .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; . .&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *&gt;&gt;BOOM!!&lt;&lt;*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Skyshadow is hit by a blast from Torca wh=\r\nich sends him spinning into the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; air\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and sliding back several me=\r\nters.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;YOU!&quot; he said, hatred written clearly on Skyshadow&#39;s fac=\r\ne. &quot;You and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accursed Fuzors!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Torca just smil=\r\ned as he held his weapon on him, &quot;You heard what your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; boss\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sai=\r\nd, FLEE or face my wrath!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile Noctorro leaped inbetween =\r\nthe Predacons and Talon, catching\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Injector and Buzzclaw and sent them=\r\n flying through the air as well! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Go!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said, his vcoi=\r\ne deep and dangerous.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Without a backwards glance they took off =\r\ninto the air, fleeing after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; master, Hydras! The other Pr=\r\nedacons, seeing his flight began pulling out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Night Shift is quick to follow orders, as he car=\r\nefully places Talon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Tucson&#39;s front seat. Tucson shuts his doors =\r\nand secures her gently\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so she doesn&#39;t fall when he moves. It was ju=\r\nst enough energy to secure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her, as his engine slows and once again,=\r\n is idol.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Talon - I want you to - know that it will take m=\r\nore than just a shot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to my arm to stop me=\r\n completely. Hydras will pay for what - he has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to you=\r\n. I promise you that.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Inside the tower*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OL=\r\nD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord Quicly followed Rattrap when he reached the exi=\r\nt he took off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grabs Rattrap by his tail and quickly sta=\r\nrted to move away. Meanwhile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BlackFortress count to zer=\r\no continues... 2 mins to Explotion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The way o=\r\nut of the tower is apparently unguarded, Scourge is no where to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; seen, probably having much better things to do like plan his own escape=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; strategy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In any event the hole that Rat Trap and Windlo=\r\nrd had used to enter was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; available, and when they looked =\r\nout they could see that the Magma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; beneath\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the tower was beginn=\r\ning to froth and churn as if it was somehow \n&gt; &gt; &gt; beginning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n boil deep beneath.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile the female voice was continuing i=\r\nts count down. &quot;1 minute to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destruction!
