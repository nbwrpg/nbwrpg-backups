Yet remaining with his back against the wall and his arms crossed in front of his chest, still seeming as if nothing was wrong at all. And masking his relieved concern with admirable efficiency.\nHe followed her with his optics as she jumped from the table, still watching her as she landed beside him. She didn�t seem all that bad off, a few open wounds here and a bit of singed fur there. Nothing major to worry about. It had seemed that Prowl and himself had come onto the scene just in time, noting that both of them had dropped something when they had been struck. Further inspection reveled that they were a sort of device that attached to the pain cortex in the neck. Something that was fairly common for the Alliance, painful and straight to the point.\nIn his earlier years of his past life he had seen many devices similar to such as Nemesis Enforcer�s Pain Bug. \nDinobot watched as Tavatron looked at him, the relief in her face clearly seen by him. Though he had expected her to be. Saviors whom had come to take her from this Hell hole. Away from the horrid devices of pain, away from the constant threat of being shot in the head. To take her to a safe and welcome place, one in which he could not quite call Home but was safe none the less.\nThough the look on her face was that of relief�the sound of her voice was anything but. It was concern�for him?\nDinobot sighed and twitched his tail as he heard Tavatron�s concerns for his safety, knowing that it slightly worried her that he had dangered himself by coming here�but only if she knew.\nIf only she knew that as long as she was safe, as long as she was within welcoming walls�it was well worth the price he would pay with his life�to have her safe.\nThe factor that he actually cared for the fembot before him slowly rose a little more to the surface, yet still remained hidden in the shadows of the depth of his mind.\nDinobot sighed again once Tavatron had finished saying her peace, how she thought that it was suicide to try and rescue her like this and how he was going to get himself killed one day. Yet, the thought of how Tavatron didn�t know that he HAD DIED before almost brought a half-hearted smile to his face, seeming almost as if ironic.\nHe simply looked at her as if to clarify that he knew all that she was saying, none of it was new to him. None.\nIf he had 1/4th of a brick of energon for every time her had heard the exact same thing Tavatron had told him�he would have been a rich bot!\nDinobot looked off towards the bared door with an amused grunt�*\n\n� It is not as if the concept of DEATH is new to m��\n\n* His sentence was cut short by something in which he thought he would never had experienced in his entire life, a woman�s arms about HIS neck! An embrace.\nDinobot�s optics widened for a moment before he turned his head back to look at Tavatron, his arms uncrossing and held on either side of her but not touching. Almost as if she was something in which would break if he so much as breathed. In which he wasn�t at the moment.\nHe simply looked down at her, optics no longer wide but searching for some sort of proper reaction in which was appropriate. However, he had no idea what to do! He hadn�t been hugged in the longest time that he had forgotten HOW to return one. Yet, he had also never wanted one nor wanted to return it. However, this felt�different for some reason. This felt, not quite pleasant but�acceptable. \nHis expression was neither surprise nor annoyance. Yet more like�understanding.\nHe couldn�t blame Tavatron for expressing her relief like this, it was�natural. \nSo, in simple terms he let her embrace him. And as much as he did not admit it out loud, he didn�t mind it�from HER. Yet, if this would be some other bot in which had their arms about his neck�he would flatten them right then and there!!\nDinobot felt Tavatron untwine her arms from around his neck and move away slightly, then realizing that he had began to breath again�but then suddenly realized that he had had his own hands firmly clamped on either side of her waist until she had moved away. Noting that he had even been a little reluctant to let go.\n It was a strange concept, what one can do when they did not realize it.\nBut yet�he wondered if she had noticed? Surely she must have.\nHe watched as she looked up to him with the same relief but then suddenly look off in the direction of Prowl�s last location, then looking over there himself with a low growl. Noting that he could not see either Prowl or Iron Raptor. Which meant that they were both safely cloaked.\nDinobot remained looking in Prowl�s direction even as Tavatron looked back to him and asked where their Third in Command happened to be. Then slowly looked back to her, still slightly wondering if she had noticed his clawed hands on her own waist but also thinking how it might be wise to become cloaked themselves.\nIt was then that he noticed that the very device in which had been in his hand was now securely fastened to Tavatron�s hip, knowing for a fact that it hadn�t gotten there by itself.\nDinobot looked at the device for a moment before clearing his throat calmly, still thinking how odd it was when one does something they did not realize they had.\n He simply gestured towards her hip with his hand before crossing his arms across his chest again, his expression reading nothing more then it usually did.*\n\n� Perhaps activating THAT shall answer your question?�\n\n* He wasn�t in the least shamed by what he had done, it was far better then simply pushing her away and growling at her. However, he made a mental note not to do it again, or at least not without her permission. There were times in which he slipped and showed unneeded emotion, this just happened to be one of those times. It just so happened this time he didn�t seem to mind it all that much.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
