She \nkept her head level with Dinobot�s so as not to throw him off balance, but \nmade sure she wasn�t holding on as tightly as before.  At first she had been \nquite uncomfortable with the notion of riding a dinosaur, much less a fellow \nwarrior, but after a while she had grown quite used to this mode of \n�transportation�.  Tavatron continued to gaze forward, her optics eagerly \nsearching out their destination. They couldn�t be far now, though she had \nabsolutely no idea where they were going. She noticed that Dinobot had \nincreased his pace, turning the surrounding flora into nothing but a brown \nand green blur. She chanced a glance to the side, only get  smacked upside \nthe head by a rogue tree branch. It was a small one, not enough to make her \nfall but enough to cause a considerable amount of stinging. Tavatron shook \nher head in annoyance. Still, despite what had just happened all in all this \nreally wasn�t that bad.\n\nTavatron�s optics darted to the side, she made sure not to turn her head \nthis time, less she get hit again. She thought she saw something splatter \nagainst the tree as Dinobot continued to leap in a criss-cross fashion. \nBefore she could say anything about it Dinobot seemed to almost spasm, but \nTavatron dismissed it as overworked muscles. Unless he was injured. Tavatron \nsuddenly found herself quite concerned for the safety of her traveling \ncompanion, and anxiously awaited the chance to look him over and assure \nherself he was alright. She would have scanned him, but her scanners seemed \nto be inoperable. Oh well, if it was anything serious he would have told \nher. Then again, he was Dinobot, even when injury was evident he still had \nassured her he was fine.\n\nTavatron almost gasped in shock as they came to a rather hard landing atop \nan old, weathered stump at the edge of a breathtaking clearing. It was \nbeautiful! If she had known this world held such beauty she would never have \nset foot inside a base again. Tavatron continued to gaze in amazement at her \nwonderful surroundings. The grass smelled soft with a hint of sweetness to \nit. Her beast mode told her it was sweetgrass, though she had absolutely no \nidea what sweetgrass was. The water smelled fresh and cold, the clear mist \ngently caressing her face. She had completely forgotten about the Alliance \nand their potential recapture. Tavatron�s eyes remained glued to the small \nwaterfall as she deeply breathed in all the scents around her. She let out \nher breath in one long, contented sigh as she gazed above at a thick canopy \nof leaves. The small sun spots on the ground seemed to dance and sparkle as \nDinobot made his way down the stump and toward the water. His walked seemed \nto have a slight limp to it, causing Tavatron to once again wonder whether \nor not he had sustained any damage earlier:\n\n&quot;This place, it�s amazing. I�ve never seen anything like it..&quot;\n\nOut of the corner of her eye something seemed to flash slightly, causing her \nshift so as to get a better view. It was Dinobot�s armor. It was reflecting \nthe light quite beautifully. Her armor never did that, and she found herself \nbecoming slightly jealous of the fact that his armor seemed to bebetter \nlooking than hers, not to mention in better condition. Tavatron sighed \ncontentedly as she began to pick small branches and leaves from her fur, \ncarelessly tossing them aside. As they reached the water Tavatron couldn�t \nhelp but stare at her reflection in the babbling brook. The clover growing \nalong the edge was exceptionally beautiful. Though something seemed a little \nodd about it.\n\nSuddenly a rush of color and fluttering wings greeted her inquisitive stare \nas multiple butterflies took flight. When Dinobot had lowered his snout to \ndrink he must have disturbed them. Tavatron playfully batted at the small \ncreatures, careful not to injure any of them. Suddenly the sound of \nscreeching tires and the rustling of nearby brush broke her concentration. \nSome �bot had followed them! So much for peace and relaxation! Tavatron dove \nto the side as Hakibuscon fired his missileat them, letting it harmlessly \npass overhead as she rolled through the grass, coming into a crouched stance \na few feet away:\n\n&quot;What the slag do you want?&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
