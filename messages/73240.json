The trees that were on the side of the\nmountain were already begining to wilt and crumble as their roots,\nwhich were buried in the mountain were being fed a concoction of\npoisonous fluids and superheated magma. Birds over head screeched as\ntheir very homes were falling away beneath them.\n\nAll around was an ocean of trees, this mountain volcano was going off\nand was about the change the landscape for years to come!\n\nHowever up into the skies, from out of the top of the volcano itself\nthere came a screeching cry as a large bird seemingly made almost\ncompletly of fire came rising up out of the coronoa of heat.\n\nThe fiery bird flapped its wings throwing flame and plasma as it\nclimebed higher into the air and began to circle the mountain.\n\nIncredulously the IFF signature from the bird was a lot like RODIMUS\nPRIME, and in his claws, held unscathed was the dark sewmiconscious\nform of NIGHTLIGHT!\n\nMeanwhile TUSCON got a static filled call from LORD ELDER, &quot;Tusco . .\nzztt . . can .. . . .  me?&quot;\n\nOff in one corner, on the far side of the mountain WASPINATOR&#39;S head\ncame rolling down the side of the mountain, bouncing a few times and\nthen sailing through the air to continue rolling.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
