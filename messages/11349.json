I figure if we can come up with a \n&gt; &gt; good plan, take over the ship, then we can hand it over to \n&gt; Magatron.  \n&gt; &gt; He&#39;d be pleased and we can all go back to Cybertron.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Time Bomb and Land Mine go with KitKat wherever she goes. \n&gt; Etchingar \n&gt; &gt; follows them, he has nothing better to do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hi.&quot; Is all Etchingar says...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
