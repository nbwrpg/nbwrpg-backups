Hydras ne=\r\neds to be stopped, but I can not expect any of you to become vulnerable to =\r\nhis attack, when it is I who should be doing something about him personally=\r\n. Rodimus, I owe it to you to avenge what he has done to you, Nightlight an=\r\nd Windlord, soley due to the fact that when you needed me years ago, I did =\r\nnot come through for you. Now, I have to redeem myself for that costly mist=\r\nake, and amend the wrongs which have been set upon you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Uproar lo=\r\noks to Tucson.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; But, that wasn&#39;t your fault. I read up on it, you=\r\n didn&#39;t do anything wrong, you were out there going above and beyond the ca=\r\nll of duty and you were unexpectedly hit from behind. There was no way you =\r\ncould have avoided what happened to you. Although, we don&#39;t know who did it=\r\n do we? That wasn&#39;t in the intel I read. Guys, We can&#39;t let Tucson face Hyd=\r\nras all alone, it&#39;s way too dangerous.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to Leo=\r\n Prime and everyone else.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Leo Prime,everyone, I believe I know ho=\r\nw ta fill in the gaps as to what happened vorns ago. I was with him during =\r\nthat battle. He had finished dealing with some of the heavy hitting battlec=\r\nhargers, when he noticed that Rodimus and the others were getting seriously=\r\n pegged out in battle. He couldn&#39;t just sit there and watch it happen, and =\r\nhe knew that decoy detail wasn&#39;t best suited for his alt form which at the =\r\ntime, was more designed for utility and off road driving. But he couldn&#39;t b=\r\nare to see anyone suffer or be oppressed so he did the unthinkable, and bey=\r\nond his ability specifications, he sped out there to catch the attentions o=\r\nf the Seekers, who were concentrating on striking at the Autobot speedsters=\r\n. Well, Tucson got their attention and began to draw them away from Rodimus=\r\n and the others, but then, un be known to him, way out in the distance, Cyc=\r\nlonus hid himself nicely among cloud cover, and decided to take a pop shot =\r\nat Tucson. Well, I saw out of the rear view, Cyclonus in the distance, and =\r\nthen I saw the shot coming toward us. After that, Tucson and I were struck,=\r\n but I was the only one who saw the shot and the perpetrator. Then, anythin=\r\ng after the strike, I really don&#39;t remember.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Night Shift now hobb=\r\nles into the room slowly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; I do. I - was there too. I could see C=\r\nyclonus headn&#39; toward &#39;em, but I was so far off fightn&#39; some of the combati=\r\ncons, I couldn&#39;t get there fast enough ta swing Tucson or Straight Shot out=\r\na the way. I was miles behind them and no matter how loud I beeped my horn =\r\nta warn &#39;em, they couldn&#39;t hear me. Then, yeah, I saw that slag ball hit my=\r\n buddy, and there was an explosion that went miles up in the sky.. I though=\r\nt for sure he was a gonner.. I did my best ta get back up, and then got Tuc=\r\nson back ta base.. He was off line for a long time, and when he woke up, he=\r\n thought the power went out.. Little did he know he was struck blind by Cyc=\r\nlonus, never ta see the light of day again, or at least until he got a seco=\r\nnd opinion from a medic.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot knew that Talon would also=\r\n like to see Tucson get his sight back. She smiles to Talon and puts a hand=\r\n on hers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; I think Talon said it best, when she said it was time =\r\nwe gave Tucson back his eyes. Leo Prime, before anything else, I think it&#39;s=\r\n time you guys fought as a whole, and you really can&#39;t do that unless all o=\r\nf you can see the road ahead of you. So, if I may do so, I want to request =\r\nthat Tucson Prime undergoes a detailed examination and full repair of his v=\r\nisual impairment.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson looks to Straight Shot and Talon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;They&#39;re right. It&#39;s time I stopped procrastinating. Stanton, Bump, I wo=\r\nuld like to give you two the honor of undergoing this proceedure. I&#39;ve seen=\r\n your work, and I would be honored if you would perform the repairs.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; He looks to everyone confidently.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; We will do this, we will o=\r\nvercome every obsticle they&#39;ve put in front of us.

Guys, We can&#39;t let Tucson face Hydras al=\r\nl alone, it&#39;s way too dangerous.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to=\r\n Leo Prime and everyone else.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Leo Prime,everyone, I bel=\r\nieve I know how ta fill in the gaps as to what happened vorns ago.  I was w=\r\nith him during that battle.  He had finished dealing with some of the heavy=\r\n hitting battlechargers, when he noticed that Rodimus and the others were g=\r\netting seriously pegged out in battle.  He couldn&#39;t just sit there and watc=\r\nh it happen, and he knew that decoy detail wasn&#39;t best suited for his alt f=\r\norm which at the time, was more designed for utility and off road driving. =\r\n But he couldn&#39;t bare to see anyone suffer or be oppressed so he did the un=\r\nthinkable, and beyond his ability specifications, he sped out there to catc=\r\nh the attentions of the Seekers, who were concentrating on striking at the =\r\nAutobot speedsters.  Well, Tucson got their attention and began to draw the=\r\nm away from Rodimus and the others, but then, un be known to him, way out i=\r\nn the distance, Cyclonus hid himself nicely among cloud cover, and decided =\r\nto take a pop shot at Tucson.  Well, I saw out of the rear view, Cyclonus i=\r\nn the distance, and then I saw the shot coming toward us.  After that, Tucs=\r\non and I were struck, but I was the only one who saw the shot and the perpe=\r\ntrator.  Then, anything after the strike, I really don&#39;t remember.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift now hobbles into the room slowly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &quot; I do.  I - was there too.  I could see Cyclonus headn&#39; toward &#39;em, but =\r\nI was so far off fightn&#39; some of the combaticons, I couldn&#39;t get there fast=\r\n enough ta swing Tucson or Straight Shot outa the way.  I was miles behind =\r\nthem  and no matter how loud I beeped my horn ta warn &#39;em, they couldn&#39;t he=\r\nar me.  Then, yeah, I saw that slag ball hit my buddy, and there was an exp=\r\nlosion that went miles up in the sky.. I thought for sure he was a gonner..=\r\n  I did my best ta get back up, and then got Tucson back ta base..  He was =\r\noff line for a long time, and when he woke up, he thought the power went ou=\r\nt..  Little did he know he was struck blind by Cyclonus, never ta see the l=\r\night of day again, or at least until he got a second opinion from a medic.&quot;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot knew that Talon would also like to see Tu=\r\ncson get his sight back.  She smiles to Talon and puts a hand on hers.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I think Talon said it best, when she said it was time we g=\r\nave Tucson back his eyes.  Leo Prime, before anything else, I think it&#39;s ti=\r\nme you guys fought as a whole, and you really can&#39;t do that unless all of y=\r\nou can see the road ahead of you.  So, if I may do so, I want to request th=\r\nat Tucson Prime undergoes a detailed examination and full repair of his vis=\r\nual impairment.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson looks to Straight Shot and Talon=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They&#39;re right.  It&#39;s time I stopped procrastinating. =\r\n Stanton, Bump, I would like to give you two the honor of undergoing this p=\r\nroceedure.  I&#39;ve seen your work, and I would be honored if you would perfor=\r\nm the repairs.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He looks to everyone confidently.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We will do this, we will overcome every obsticle they&#39;ve put=\r\n in front of us.  But we must work as a team if we&#39;re to achieve success.&quot; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Airsh=\r\nadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kup&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kup looked in sadness how Windlord Stormed out t=\r\nhe room and then he looked at Tucson said  =E2=80=9CIt seems that Nighlight=\r\n is in her old self...
