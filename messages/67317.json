You only have=\r\n \n      termination to look&lt;BR&gt;forward to!&quot; Scourge opened up with his acid=\r\n \n      cannons!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On the shoreline the sweeps lost interest in search=\r\ning for \n      Trelos,&lt;BR&gt;perhaps they lost his scent, so turned their atte=\r\nntion to Doc. \n      &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As Doc&#39;s blast lanced out, catching one sweep =\r\nin the wing casing \n      it to&lt;BR&gt;smoke a little. Meanwhile the unmistakab=\r\nle smell of acid began \n      filling&lt;BR&gt;the air as red targeting beams dan=\r\nced around Doc&#39;s position and \n      two&lt;BR&gt;other sweeps began to open fire=\r\n on Doc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On the railing above \n      Doc&#39;s position, Kup managed to =\r\nhit one of the&lt;BR&gt;sweeps but the other - \n      either it was more agile or=\r\n more lucky - but it&lt;BR&gt;managed to avoid him. \n      Even as that happened =\r\nseveral other sweeps swung&lt;BR&gt;into position ready to \n      open fire as ta=\r\nrgeting beams lanced out again,&lt;BR&gt;but just suddenly they \n      broke posi=\r\ntion! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The reason for this became more evident as the now \n      ope=\r\nn air rippled and&lt;BR&gt;twin missiles approached Kup and Rodimus&#39; \n      posit=\r\nions, fire and wind&lt;BR&gt;trailing behind them like a vortex. As the \n      mi=\r\nssiles approached it was&lt;BR&gt;obvious that they were the same type of \n      =\r\nmissiles fired from Cyclonus&lt;BR&gt;earlier and that these missiles were going =\r\n\n      to do quite a bit of damage!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the Maximal base, sweeps cont=\r\ninued \n      to pound on it in an attempt to&lt;BR&gt;break its shield defenses!&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;OOC: \n      Don&#39;t forget Nightstrike and Darkfate were commanded by =\r\nCyclonus&lt;BR&gt;to \n      either take the Maximal base or Destroy it with the h=\r\nelp of the&lt;BR&gt;sweeps \n      left \n      behind.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;____________&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;__&lt;BR&gt;Do \n      =\r\nYou Yahoo!?&lt;BR&gt;Tired of spam?
