So it&#39;s true about the Quints..  Sheesh.\n&gt; Anyway, Leo, could it be true about Wings?  And could it be that he has no\n&gt; idea about his destiny?  Could he be next in line for the Matrix?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to Leo.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I know it&#39;s hard ta say right now but, We all know how different he is\n&gt; from all of us.  He&#39;s out there right now, taking on a battle bigger than\n&gt; anything imaginable.  Yet he&#39;s still going at it.  And he&#39;s doing it all for\n&gt; us.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME, who had been walking towards the cave opening glanced at\nRAT TRAP and STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;You two seemed to have everything figured\nout.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;I cannot know who or what choices the Matrix\nwill make in Tuscon&#39;s case.&quot;\n\n&quot;But here is a question&quot; WING CALIBER said as he walked along with LEO\nand now SANTON, &quot;What has happened to the one that Rodimus carries . .\n. or carried.&quot; He paused thoughtfully. &quot;If what you think is true and\nRodimus is as wicked as you imagine as you say, then where is it? I\ndon&#39;t think it would have allowed itself to be corrupted so easily.&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME nodded as the appraoched the mouth of the cave, &quot;I don&#39;t\nknow what is happening and I can&#39;t pretend to predict the future or\nknow who the Matrix will pick.&quot; LEO said, &quot;But let&#39;s let everything\nfinish first. Perhaps there is room redemtion for Rodimus, even one we\ncannot see.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; KEeping a track over of LEO PRIME over and the discussion amongst the\n&gt; MAXIMALS, BLACKARACHNIA was amused.  Ahh, yes, always of the foibles of\n&gt; the MAXIMALS to think that only they were right on any occasion, and especially\n&gt; that infuriating rodent.  Still fully concealed from view, still in total\n&gt; stealth mode now and her cloak powered up, she kept on working to try and\n&gt; see if she could obost the homing signals any better, to probably no luck.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSo far there was no contact from BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s attempt to locate\nHYDRAS. If he is still functional he is definitly out of range of her\nability to connect.\n\nAlso she had any kind of signal on DRILL BIT, VICE GRIP and/or DINOBOT\nthen as they went deeper into the caves they quickly fell off of her\nradar as well. Whatever interferance there was it wasy cutting off her\nrange even faster in the caves.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; WASPINATOR was flying up and over into the air, going in a long circle for\n&gt; the moment as he was attempting to try and find a clear path through the\n&gt; underbrush.  OF all the ironies, WASPINATOR was a surprisingly dextrous\n&gt; flier, and with nothing shooting at him immediately, he was seemingly able\n&gt; to clear his way through it surprisingly deftly.  Avoiding the branches,\n&gt; hovering in the air and going thorugh them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, BLACKARACHNIA mused more over on TARANTALUS, testing\n&gt; again the  mental link with her &#39;Lord&#39; to see if there was any response over it,\n&gt; or she was truly on her own for now.  If not..  Then it would be her happy time.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFor the moment BLACKARACHNIA was truely alone, or so it seemed. At\nleast there no was answering call from TARANTULUS. The only thing she\ncould hear was the conversations going on around her. But was that\nbecause she was truely cut off from TARANTULUS or because he was just\nletting her believe that she was.\n\nThe old spider was a wiley old creature. One that has only gotten more\ncrafty with age.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Fortunately, VICE GRIP could do both.  Gesturing over to DRILL BIT, &quot;Come\n&gt; with me, we&#39;re going down.&quot;  Giving instructions to DINOBOT, &quot;Go up to the\n&gt; surface and inform CRYOTEK of what we&#39;ve found and what we&#39;re doing.  We&#39;re\n&gt; going to keep on digging and trying to track the souce.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With that, the two would head towards it while DINOBOT went up towards the\n&gt; surface to covertly report to CRYOTEK.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs VICE GRIP and DRILL BIT prepared to go further in and DINOBOT\nprepared to go back to the surface there was an odd tapping that could\nbe heard even above the hum. One that echoed through out the cave\ncoming from further in and further down.\n\nThe echo made it difficult to discern any patturns to it, but one\nthing was for sure, it definitly did not sound like anything natural.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
