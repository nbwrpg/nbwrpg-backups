We&#39;ve yet to find out what that is don&#39;t we?  I agree \n&gt; with Rat Trap, a weakness has got to be researched and considered if we&#39;re \n&gt; going to immobilize those insectoids.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then turns his head in the direction of Talon.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I agree with you about Nightlight, please, see what you can do to help \n&gt; her, the sooner she&#39;s back with us, the better.

Could we actually reverse the effects of that simply \n&gt; by reading the data on that file?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap looks to him curiously.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Heeeey, that could work.  But that&#39;s up ta Wheels if he wants you ta try \n&gt; that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns his head in Night Shift&#39;s direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;As interesting as that sounds, I don&#39;t think it would be wise for you to \n&gt; do something this complicated by yourself. Too many Autobots fell to the \n&gt; wrath of the Decepticons and I&#39;d hate to lose another to Hydras.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes sir, Tucson Prime.  I won&#39;t try it alone, I promise.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns his head to everyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Night Shift, your course of action is well coordinated and I believe \n&gt; that route should be tried.  But as I&#39;ve said before, you aren&#39;t doing \n&gt; this alone.

Highly perceptive of you.  Thank \n&gt;&gt; &gt; you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Legacy, you&#39;ve shed a lot of light on many of my questions.  Now that I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; know my lineage, it&#39;s time I lived up to it.  First things first,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor and I could do with getting our sight back, and if you could \n&gt;&gt; &gt; do\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that I&#39;d greatly appreciate it, Stanton.  Next, we have insectoids \n&gt;&gt; &gt; hiding\n&gt;&gt; &gt; beneath the Black Fortress tunnels, which have to be shown a lesson \n&gt;&gt; &gt; about\n&gt;&gt; &gt; tampering with what is not theirs.  And Hydras last of all, could use a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; lesson in that as well.  Nobody tampers with any Autobot and gets away\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with it.  Especially when they tamper with a Prime.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He turns his head toward Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; They caused great harm to you Rodimus, and I&#39;ll see to it, with your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; help, that they get it back in return.  If Optimus Prime could fend off\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Megatron, I&#39;m sure I can follow in his footsteps, and fend off the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; enemy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; at hand.  Both Hydras and Cylconus need to be dealt with accordingly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus voiced an interest in dealing with Hydras and so do I.  Two \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Primes\n&gt;&gt; &gt; against an evil leader is sure to topple even the most evil of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; warlords.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But our war does not end with just us.  If we&#39;re going to send those\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Decepticons and Predicons packing, we&#39;ll need every Autobot and Maximal \n&gt;&gt; &gt; we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have in our ranks to pull this off.  Lord Elder, I&#39;d like you to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; contact\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Lord Perseus, and assemble a Maximal/ Autobot assembly.  The more we \n&gt;&gt; &gt; get\n&gt;&gt; &gt; together, the stronger we&#39;ll be.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I know who it sounds like.

And by chance, could he actually be related to \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; him?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Legacy turned and looked at Tuscon, his single optic pulsing for a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; moment, &quot;You come from the same construction line as the Autobot\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leader known as Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Legacy paused for a moment as if accessing some internal memories,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;You spark matrix according to the last scan record bears a striking\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; similarity to Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Convoy as well as Big\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Convoy.
