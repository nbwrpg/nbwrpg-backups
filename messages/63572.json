Part of her spark was over joyed. Part of\nher spark knew that inside the base was the worst kind of hell that\nany bot could endure.  She start to feel sick to her ingestion\ncompartments. She felt like she was saving one to betray another.  but\nshe couldn&#39;t figure out whom she was saving and whom she was\nbetraying.  She let the weight of her body go and dropped to her\nknees. Never had she wished for him to do this. Though she felt\noverwhelming happiness that she was the one he had choosen. She also\nfelt sick for the one who was about to be hurt.  She felt like she was\na traiter to a fellow warrior bot in arms. She wondered how in the pit\nshe would live with herself after all this.  Part of her spark hoped\nhe ment when he said they would go away from here. After this day,\nliving here would not be an option to her. And she knew it.   \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll be alright.  Don&#39;t worry about me.
