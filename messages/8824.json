Now what to do \nwith \n&gt; it, she thought.  She wondered if hooking it up to a CR chamber \nwould \n&gt; do the trick.  She knew the CR restored the body and the DNA of a \n&gt; bot&#39;s aminal side.  She wondered if it could change a bot&#39;s form as \n&gt; well if the scanner was hooked up to it correctly.  She took the \n&gt; scanner and was about to walk out of the bay when the idea struck \n&gt; her. &quot;Where am I going to find a wolf to scan?&quot; She looked at the \n&gt; scanner and sighed.  The only wolf around that she knew of was \n&gt; Lunarpine.  &quot;Well, so much for suprizing him.  I will need his help \n&gt; anyway in order to get this to work anyway.&quot;  She carried the \nscanner \n&gt; with her and walked back into the engine room.  She walked around \nthe \n&gt; bend and still saw Lunarpine laying there.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Um, I hate to bother you like this, but I need your help on a big \n&gt; project.  Would you be willing to help me?&quot; She smiled. If this \n&gt; worked, she would be a wolf and he would be happier with life.  At \n&gt; least, that was her plan.\n\n\n"}}
