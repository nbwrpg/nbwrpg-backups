I can fight well and the last two bots to \nharass me \n&gt; ended up dead.  I don&#39;t like to fight but I fight to win.  I&#39;m very \ngood at \n&gt; getting bots to tell me things and concealing things from bots.  \nI&#39;m not a \n&gt; Predacon.  I have no faction as of yet, but I will fight for the \nPredacons \n&gt; for the sake of doing something.\n\n\n"}}
