It was obvious from all the singed feathers that\nhe wasn&#39;t going to out run these bots. Quickly he turned and dove downward\ntowards Drillbit. The only way he could think to avoid the artillery was to\nget close enough to one of them that they wouldn&#39;t risk harming thier ally.\nHe sweapt low, his talons just missing the first attempt. Drillbit swung his\ndrill at Ignatius like King Kong going after a plane. The swing missed but\nIgnatius&#39; problem was still there. more missles slammed into him followed by\nweapons fire from Kali and company. Ignatius&#39; wings were badly damaged but\nwith alot of effort he could still fly. The enraged Eagle sweapt again at\nDrillbit trying to grab him in his talons. The Trainers only hope was to\ngrab and go.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, June 24, 2001 7:13 AM\nSubject: Re: Kill the Trainers\n\n\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt;\n&gt; He jumped up as the missile hit below him. The shockwave from the\n&gt; explosion sent him over the dune and to where Ignatius was. As he came\n&gt; down he switched his gattaling gun to drill mode. He landed less then a\n&gt; foot from Ignatius, and out stretched his arm, with force. He was going\n&gt; to drill a hole right through Ignatius. The Trainer eagle bot would die.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
