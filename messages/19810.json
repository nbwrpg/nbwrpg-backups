He\n&gt; knew his howl couldn&#39;t cause any lasting damage but it could disrupt his\n&gt; senses long enough for Lunarpine to get close enough to use his claws.\n&gt;\n&gt; In his half wolf state his internal repairs would begin and hopefully his\n&gt; tactics would give him the advantage he needed to destroy the traitor\nbefore\n&gt; any more secrets fell into Prebons hands. He knew Striker well enough to\n&gt; hold his own in a fight, there was a good chance that Slayer fought with\nthe\n&gt; same style. Slayer still didn&#39;t know that the wolf he was fighting was the\n&gt; once lesser wolf named Lunarpine, and now Slayer was going to learn that\n&gt; Lunarpine was more than more than meets the eye.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 31, 2000 5:37 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Yanosh don&#39;t leave me hangin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Slayer laughs, watching Lunarping fall to the ground. Slayer gliding\n&gt; &gt; in closer, his shoulder blasters take aim again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He hesitates before firing again, unable to give the command to\n&gt; &gt; destroy this bot. What was wrong with him? Why couldn&#39;t he kill a\n&gt; &gt; normal Maximal?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Roaring in frustration, Slayer aims a laser rifle at Lunarpine,\n&gt; &gt; clenching his fists as hard as he could to pull the trigger, bolts\n&gt; &gt; streaming out toward Lunarpine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Fool, I do compare to the pit!&quot; Slayer growls\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine laughed. that was the first thing the two wolves agreed\n&gt; &gt; on since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Slayer was Striker. Lunarpine crossed his claws again blocking the\n&gt; &gt; lasers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Slayer fired at him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I agree, you are like the Pit, you keep going on without end. but\n&gt; &gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about your talking I&#39;m still waiting for you to atack. Or is this\n&gt; &gt; the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you got?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine soon ate his words as a missle struck his crossed claws\n&gt; &gt; knocking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him off balance. A second missle struck him in the shoulder causing\n&gt; &gt; a gaping\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rip in his frame. The bot stumbled to the ground holding his wound.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine knew that beast mode would heal him but would leave him\n&gt; &gt; vulnerable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for another attack. he had to stay in bot mode to fight. Slayer was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hesitating, Lunarpine didn&#39;t know for sure why but decided to act\n&gt; &gt; instead of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dwell on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The wolfbot curled up trying to protect the wound. &quot;Come on\n&gt; &gt; toughbot live up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to your name.
