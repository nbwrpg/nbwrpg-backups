There\n&gt; &gt; was a small section for rechargi=\r\nng chamber and a small modified\n&gt; &gt; computer panel; something that was need=\r\ned since these rooms were\n&gt; &gt; designed for Autobots who were several times =\r\nlarger than any of them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy was standing at one of the computer=\r\n panel as information\n&gt; &gt; scrolled across the screen.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turned as =\r\nStraight Shot entered.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Legacy, if it&#39;s okay, c=\r\nould - we talk for a little while?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy looked at =\r\nStraight Shot, his cold cyclopean gaze fastening onto\n&gt; &gt; her. &quot;That would =\r\nbe acceptable.&quot; Legacy said emotionlessly. He turned\n&gt; &gt; to face her comple=\r\ntely, folding his arms behind his back he waited\n&gt; &gt; patiently for her to s=\r\nay what she had to say.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He types in a code to c=\r\nlose the doors, to allow them a little privacy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once hearing them shu=\r\nt, he smiles to Talon, and gently takes her hands.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; By=\r\n the time Lord Elder caught up with Tuscon he was inside his\n&gt; &gt; chamber, h=\r\ne could smell the metallic oils that Talon customarily wore\n&gt; &gt; as well.

There would be time =\r\nenough for talk.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As he turned he noticed Torca as he walked up to h=\r\nim, a grim look on\n&gt; &gt; his face. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Lord Elder said, concern w=\r\nritten on his\n&gt; &gt; face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Torca nodded, &quot;We need to talk.&quot; Is all he =\r\nsaid, his reverberous tone\n&gt; &gt; echoing in the halls.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Talon widely smiled and said while she jumped to Tucson&#39;s arms and sa=\r\nid\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;YES!!
