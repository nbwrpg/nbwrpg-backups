Makes me wanna put in a rule about being curteous to members, \nAlten. You obviously need practice in manners.\n\nRudra, I admit that I was a bit too strict, but as Alten pointed out \nover the message board while yelling at me for reprimanding him \npublicly, me and him don&#39;t get along. However, that wasn&#39;t the main \nreason I reprimanded, the post&#39;s subject matter was.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Whatever, I personally don&#39;t care about your opinions. And I didn&#39;t \nmean to \n&gt; send that note out publicly. It was supposed to be just for him \nonly. I \n&gt; didn&#39;t know that the address was for the NBW O.K., so lay off, NOW!\n&gt; If you don&#39;t like my posts, too bad. I&#39;m playing by your rules, so \nthere is \n&gt; no reason the complain about what i wrote. If i wanted, i could \nhave done \n&gt; something worse, but i didn&#39;t beacue you all asked me not to do \nthose sorts \n&gt; of things when i first came in.\n&gt; So, if you don&#39;t like mine and Meg&#39;s ideas, i don&#39;t care. DON&#39;T \nread them if \n&gt; you don&#39;t like them. I did nothing wrong to anyone, i didn&#39;t use \nbad \n&gt; language and i didn&#39;t do anything that would be considered wrong. \nThese are \n&gt; robots for one, they have NO breasts or anything. how could this be \nreal \n&gt; anyway? I&#39;ve seen some of the stuff you guys write and it&#39;s pretty \ngross \n&gt; too, so what the @#$$ are you guys complaining about? I didn&#39;t \nraise \n&gt; complaints about any of that!\n&gt; Two, it&#39;s called comic relief. Have you ever heard of humour?\n&gt; So, i&#39;ve had enough of your pointless whining. If you want to take \nthis up, \n&gt; do it in private e-mail. My addy is:                        \n&gt; beastwarsaddress@h...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;     As much as I enjoy watching pointless arguments, this could \ndrive \n&gt; &gt;another\n&gt; &gt;wedge between people in the group.  We don&#39;t need that.  Alten, as \namusing \n&gt; &gt;as\n&gt; &gt;the post was, it went beyond the bounds of good taste.  From an \nobjective\n&gt; &gt;perspective, Yan probably could have been less harsh but his point \nwas \n&gt; &gt;valid.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
