As it rounds the corner into the atmosphere it blinks as if \nsmiling and a laugh ecos thorughout the corerdors as a pod is \nlaunched into the atmosphere, as the pure evil being known as Auorn \nrushes toward the unsuspecting population he smiles at the brillance \nof his plan as the great ship Chaoz turns off and heads in the \ndirection it has come. AS the pod crashes into a rejion of Earth with \na menacing crash and a explosion that can be sensed for miles \naround, &quot;Yes I am here fianlly to reak my havok on this planet&quot; as he \nsends out his sensors to find him a worthy mode of transporatation \nthat the bots refer to as a beast mode. AS it comes over the two \nenemies locked in combat it senses then and fin&#92;ds there bodies as \none sutible for his purpese. As the statis field finally goes off and \nthe form of Auron steps out with a long black claw into the \nground, &quot;Yes this will do nicely&quot; he said when he turned into the \nhalf Dragon half lion mode which would suit him. As Auron laughs \nwithin his new bodie he launches into the air waiting for his first \nchallenge.\n\n\n"}}
