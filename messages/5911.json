He didn&#39;t know if the \nMaximal was Shadow Wing or not under the circumstanaes he assumed it \nwas.\n\n&quot;Lunarpine to base, we have a Maximal in destress, I&#39;m sending the \nlocation now. Awaiting further orders.&quot;\n\nTo the Pit with orders, he thought as he sprinted across the \nlandscape in the direction of the Predicons message. A fellow Maximal \nwas in trouble, and there&#39;d be Unicron to pay if it was harmed.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ll be out camping with family untill sunday, so I wouldn&#39;t be \nable to post.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/DevilDuer/Perndabot/Reptilica/Bloodystrike::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus flies through the forest, looking around. He frowns. \nSomething was \n&gt; wrong, he could feel it. He looks down at his hand, seeing that it \nwas half \n&gt; transparent. No! It was happening again.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll be gone for a few days,&quot; he says over his comm-link to the \nAlliance, \n&gt; &quot;Nemesis is in charge untill I get back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns to Nemesis. &quot;Finish the meeting with Panzertron. Try to \nrecruit him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that, Zardus phases out, ready to phase back in in several \ndays.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; In his quarters, DevilDuer turns around in his chair. He was not \nfeeling \n&gt; well. Stumbling across the room, he falls on his bed.

He could swear \nsomething had just \n&gt; flown over him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Night vision,&quot; he tells his internal computer, his optics changing \ncolor. He \n&gt; looks around, seeing a bird. That was it. Perndabot lifts his gun, \nhis optics \n&gt; widening when he looks at his arm, seeing through it. He growls. \nNot again!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There is a Maximal at my coordinates,&quot; he says over his comm-link, \nthe \n&gt; device accidently transmitting that message over all frequences, \nthen sending \n&gt; the coordinates.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica and Bloodystrike drop off the energon they had mined in \nthe cargo \n&gt; hold.
