From as far back as he could remember he\nhad always had a fascination with anything new, the stars, new\nplanets, new places, he was a machine designed to explore.\n\nOn the screens were different views of space, a few of them were\ncentered on the moon, as he silently wondered exactly what was going\non there, what were the minions planning? Unfortunately he had no\nability to peer into their very base, although he could at times make\nout the dim reddish reflections from the moon, the base of Unicron&#39;s\nminions.\n\nWith a sigh he looked at another monitor, this one trained in a\ndifferent direction. He couldn&#39;t necessarily see the Predacon base\nfrom his position, but he knew where it was and he always kept a\nsensor beam in their direction. Even with the ongoing skirmishes from\nthe minions, you can never put it past the Predacons to make an attack\nas well.\n\nHe pursed his lips slightly as he looked at the screen. He had seen\nRat Trap going off in that direction. He hadn&#39;t said anything to the\nMaximal, as Rat Trap was usually more than able to take care of\nhimself, but it had been a while since he had checked in.\n\nWith a casual movement Lord Elder reached down to the console in front\nof him and opened an encrypted maximal channel, &quot;Rat Trap! This is\nLord Elder, come it. What is your Status?&quot;\n\n(Tag)\n\nPreston\n(Lord Elder)\n\n"}}
