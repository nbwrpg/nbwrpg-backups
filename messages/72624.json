Each one depicting a different scen=\r\ne =96 one looked at a patch of jungle, another at a river. Some were lookin=\r\ng at prison cells and other at halls and corridors. \n\nIn the center of all =\r\nof this DARK RODIMUS, watching one that showed LEO PRIME and HYDRAS plus th=\r\ne PREDACONS and MAXIMALS that were coming with them. \n\n&quot;A most interesting =\r\nexercise isn&#39;t it?&quot; MAGMATRON said from behind DARK RODIMUS. He hadn&#39;t been=\r\n there a minute ago and it caused DARK RODIMUS to jump. \n\nMAGMATRON smiled,=\r\n he knew DARK RODIMUS hated when he did that, but he also knew that the bot=\r\n was too stubborn to admit it. \n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot; DARK RODIMUS said afte=\r\nr a moment of recovering his composure. \n\nGesturing at the screen MAGMATRON=\r\n stepped forward the light of the view screen casting evil shadows across h=\r\nis frame, &quot;All this power coming right to us - Leo Prime bringing us his sh=\r\nard of the shard of his Matrix.&quot; There was a pause and a smile, &quot;They belie=\r\nve they are coming to do battle with me, and yet they are all coming bringi=\r\nng me a gift.&quot; \n\nMAGMATRON chuckled again. &quot;The dinosaurs opened a path for=\r\n them and then their death&#39;s led them back to us.&quot; He looked at DARK RODIMU=\r\nS, &quot;Even you have played your role in drawing them all here.&quot;\n\nDARK RODIMUS=\r\n&#39; optics flared brightly, &quot;So all I am is just a pawn in your games?&quot; He ba=\r\nlled his fists as if ready to fight, which of course made MAGMATRON chuckle=\r\n all the more. \n\n&quot;Did I not say you are my knight?&quot; MAGMATRON laid a calmin=\r\ng hand on DARK RODIMUS&#39; tense shoulder. &quot;You are the piece that moves in su=\r\nrprising ways.&quot;\n\nThere was a pause and then a nod from DARK RODIMUS. &quot;What =\r\nof Tuscon?&quot; He said as he looked back up at MAGMATRON, &quot;Does he not bare so=\r\nme of the power of the Matrix as well?&quot;\n\nMAGMATRON nodded, &quot;Yes, but he doe=\r\ns not have it himself.&quot; He stroked his chin, &quot;But he may prove useful after=\r\n all.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then let me recapture him.&quot; DARK RODIMUS said, his optics bright a=\r\nnd clear. &quot;I shall bring him before you groveling.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from M=\r\nAGMATRON, &quot;Yes of course, bring him to me and we shall complete our set.&quot;\n\n=\r\nDARK RODIMUS straightened and then snapped a salute before turning on a hee=\r\nl and walking out the door. \n\nAs the door slid closed behind him another vo=\r\nice came out from the darkness. &quot;He is an interesting one isn&#39;t he.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes =\r\nSaberback he is.&quot; MAGMATRON said without turning. Instead he looked at one =\r\nof the screens, the one that showed TUSCON transforming into his dragon mod=\r\ne and attempting to attack the guards. \n\n&quot;Too bad they will all have to die=\r\n.&quot; SABERBACK said humorlessly. \n\nMAGMATRON just watched the screen as he fo=\r\nlded his arms over his chest. He said nothing. \n\n&quot;Perhaps we should have so=\r\nmeone collect the female that your Dark Knight seems to have a fondness for=\r\n.&quot; SABERBACK said in a crafty voice. &quot;He may need some . . . incentive to s=\r\ntay in his role later on.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from MAGMATRON, &quot;Make it so.&quot;\n\n=\r\nThere was a chuckle as SABERBACK faded back into the darkness. \n\n. . . . . =\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
