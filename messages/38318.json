On the\ninside the lights begin to dim. In the repair bay as Nightmare lays Hook\ndown, the lights go out, his red shimmering smoke lighting up a small\narea. Scrapper begins to panik, &quot;Lord Unitron, we are being drawn into a\ndangerous predicament, I suggest we pull out, and call it quits.&quot;\nScrapper sputtered.\n\nHavotron&#39;s eyes flared. It must be an Autobot trick. &quot;NO, we follow\nthem. I want to know what they&#39;re after.&quot; Just then though, the ship\nbegan to sputter, as it was gaining speed being sucked in. Slugslinger\nand Apeface&#39;s eyes were begining to cloud over, as they were losing\nbalance. Havotron looked around at the other Decepticons. &quot;Wimps, stand\nup.&quot; He shouted.\n\nScrapper got out of his seat. &quot;My lord, we could be ripped to shreds if\nwe continue.&quot; \n\nAt those words Havotron leveled his cannon at Scrapper. &quot;Get back to\nyour seat.&quot; he said quietly to dot the exclamation on his point.\n\nSpinister could only look on through the window. He had never seen\nanything like it.\n\n\nHidden One::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nHe had never seen anything like it. It was so beautiful, Lightspeed\ncould not take his eyes away from it. Strafe began to feel light headed,\nand leaned on Afterburner.\n\nHoist looked at Pacifix, &quot;Are you all right commander?&quot; He asked\nworriedly.\n\nGrimlock looked over and noticed Pacifix. Something was going wrong, he\ncould see some of the other Autobots get clumsy. Why wasn&#39;t Pacifix\ntelling them anything. He stood up, and headed towards the back.\n\n"}}
