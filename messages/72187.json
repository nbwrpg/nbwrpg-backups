He\n&gt; &gt; helped=\r\n with its repairs, but there is no telling how long he was here\n&gt; &gt; before =\r\nwe got here.&quot; He looked at DINOBOT, &quot;He might even have a few\n&gt; &gt; other thi=\r\nngs we haven&#39;t found yet.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a pause=\r\n from DINOBOT.  What would the Megatron of old do in such a circumstance?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Memory File Delta Three Seven Beta Four Gamma:\n&gt; \n&gt; Assault upon the Ar=\r\nk, Quickstrike is sent in at point, and detonates a Maximal explosives cach=\r\ne and has a giant rock fall on him, crushing him to stasis lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megat=\r\nron crowing, &quot;When looking for booby traps, always send the boob in first.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The suggested action came to DINOBOT&#39;s processor instantly.  &quot;We shou=\r\nld take Waspinator.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And BLACKARACHNIA was =\r\nright, CRYOTEK was as sneaky and as wicked as\n&gt; &gt; they came. It was he that=\r\n fostered the great MEGATRON and taught him\n&gt; &gt; much of what he knew,  the =\r\nMEGATRON that had stolen the golden disk\n&gt; &gt; and fled to old Earth with it,=\r\n the old MEGATRON who now existed, at\n&gt; &gt; least in part, inside the form of=\r\n HYDRAS.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; And so BLACKARACHNIA knew that CRY=\r\nOTEK wasn&#39;t here out of the goodness of his fuel pump as far as evil crimin=\r\nal overlords went.  He was here for either of two things, or both.\n&gt; \n&gt; HE =\r\nwas either here for revenge, or to turn events on Earth to his own favor.  =\r\nProbably both, despite what they said abuot mixing business and pleasure.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The third possibility disspelled itself as rapidly as her processor off=\r\nered it up, that whatever he had seen in the future with HYDRAS chagning th=\r\nings was so terrifying he had come to undo it was removed as fast as her pr=\r\nocessor offered it as she deleted that analytical subroutine for wasting da=\r\nta time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; TARANTULUS stepped foward looking =\r\nat HYDRAS a smile on his face.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;There are no traps.&quot; He said hoping to =\r\nreassure, but as everyone\n&gt; &gt; know, TARANTULUS was not the most trustworthy=\r\n of soldiers, usually\n&gt; &gt; having his own agenda on things.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;DINOBOT&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; DINOBOT merely sneered over at Tarantalus, &quot;Of course.  And next you wi=\r\nll have prime real estate right under Iacon for which you can sell me at a =\r\nsteal.  Do not try my time wtih idiocy, Spider.  I might decide to torture =\r\nyou just for old time&#39;s sake regardless of whether you tell the truth.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; SKY SHADOW looked at DINOBOT a small smile on his =\r\nface. &quot;Different\n&gt; &gt; ship, Megatron has become Hydras, but the same forces =\r\nseems to be at\n&gt; &gt; play.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; DINOBOT merely nodded, =\r\n&quot;I know.  But still, spark bindings, especially of those of such power and =\r\nmagesty, never go so smoothly.  I am sure he will surprise us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD -=\r\n CRYOTEK&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; CRYOTEK nodded to HYDRAS, &quot;Perhaps we should adjourn bac=\r\nk to your\n&gt; &gt; meeting room?&quot; He said as he held out a genteel hand to BLACH=\r\nARACHNIA,\n&gt; &gt; his clawed hand looking clean and manicured as he opened his =\r\nfingers\n&gt; &gt; much like a gentlemech might before an esteemed lady. &quot;Will you=\r\n do me\n&gt; &gt; the honor of walking with me?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ther was =\r\na sultry smile from BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;WHy of course, my Leige.&quot;  Giving a low=\r\n saunter and a blatant &#39;wink&#39; to him, while opening a back channel quadrupl=\r\ne encrypted communications channel to Tarantalus, turning her form to a liv=\r\ning microphone for him to hear what HYDRAS and CRYOTEK were about to discus=\r\ns.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
