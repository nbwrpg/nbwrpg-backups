They must not know who they are dealing with here,\njust wait and see...\n\nSinesis and Sinister were suddenly fighting side by side again, and not\ndoing a very good job, neither! Assassins versus Ninja warriors, who could\nwin? Deemos threw Sinesis through the air with the greatest of ease. Sinesis\njumped back up, but Deemos shoulder blocked him and down he went again.\nSinister fires at Inzola, but she spins around and suddenly pulls out a\nshield, blocking the attacks. The minor wounds Deemos and Inzola had started\nto heal.\n\n&quot;Aim at their sparks...&quot; Sinesis whispered to Sinister. Sinister palyed\ndead. Sinesis roared in rage and tried to fight them both. Deemos and Inzola\nsimply stcuk their cannon to his head and fired. He flew back and also\nplayed dead, even though those shots hurt like the pit. Deemos and Inzola\nlooked at each other and laughed, they expected them to fall for this? Then\nthere was a ticking sound. Like a grenade. Inzola and Deemos looked behind\nthem, but the grenade was a dud. Inzola turned around and both Sinesis and\nSinister fired into her chest. Bang! Inzola flew backwards, a hole in her\nchest and her spark showing. Deemos spun a staff around in circles and\nchopped Sinister to pieces! Sinesis knocked Deemos down and scrambled to\nInzola. He noticed the machine and ripped it out.\n\n&quot;Healing device, eh?&quot; Sinesis said. He jabbed his claw into it, destroying\nit. A spark flew around and glowed before him. Lightmare&#39;s spark. It\ncrackled a few times and fell to the ground, fading away to go wherever it&#39;s\nfinal destination was. Sinesis looked at it in puzzlement when it\ndiappeared.\n\n&quot;Never turn your back on your opponent!&quot; Deemos said, he swung his staff and\nSinesis went down. Sinesis pulled out a grenade, a small one. Deemos grabbed\nit from him and it shot a laser beam into Deemos&#39; chest and blew him in\nhalf. Sinesis stumbled over, his sneaky trick winning him the battle. He cut\na hole in Deemos&#39; chest and extracted another healing device. He ripped this\none open and another spark was flying around. Sinesis tried to catch it, but\nthis one wasn&#39;t ready for the Matrix. Sinesis sighed and pulled out his\nblaster to shoot it. Sinesis felt a burning pain in his back, and Deemos was\nstanding behind him, self reattached with a bit of bonding. He simply cut\ndown Sinesis, picked up Inzola, and started walking away. Sineesis and\nSinister&#39;s parts lay in the battlefield, the spark of Gangon floating in\nfront of BrightBlade...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, July 12, 2000 9:38 AM\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; ::Perndabot/Reptilica/Bloodystrike/DevilDuer::\n&gt;\n&gt; Perndabot, Reptilica, and Bloodystrike look slightly confused as Sinister\nand\n&gt; Sinesis start figting Deemoz and Inzola.
