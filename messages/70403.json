He could clearly see Cheetor and Ramulus working to pull\neveryone out of the deep pit, with Airhammer pulling guard duty. He\nhad almost forgotten about that hole that Megatron had dug. They need\nto fill that thing in, not telling what else could come out of it.\n\nHe glanced back at Kup, &quot;They&#39;re about out.&quot; Elder said, his voice\nexcited by what was going on, but he still managed to keep his cool.\n&quot;Legacy is about to bring Rodimus in, we have Santon and Bump both\nthere ready to assist Legacy in the repairs.&quot;\n\nA viewscreen showed Legacy approaching the Ark, the shield parting\nslightly to allow him to enter.\n\nThe screen also showed Santon and Bump standing on the dock. Santon\nwas the larger, bulkier form. He was Grey with red on his thighs and\narms. Large tusk like protrusions comming from the side of his head\nand heavy plating displaying clearly what his beast mode would be,\nthat of an elephant.\n\nStanding just behind Santon was Bump, a smaller more compact Maximal,\ncolored almost in reverse of Santon, red armored frame with grey along\nthe thighs and bicepts. His beast mode was more difficult to discern,\nperhaps some sort of reptile.\n\nThe camera view showed them both looking up at the approaching Legacy\nas he was carrying Rodimus&#39; form in his arms.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
