It gives me\n&gt; a chance to collect my thoughts.  And as I said earlier, I will not favor\n&gt; anyone, they all get treated the same way.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then turns his attentions to the disappearances of Cheetor, Cyclonus,\n&gt; Rodimus, and now Optimus Primal.  He then thinks for a moment about Rodimus,\n&gt; lightly tapping a claw in deep thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I remember the last location Cheetor was in, and I logged it in the system\n&gt; computer.   I also logged the last location Rodimus and Cyclonus were last\n&gt; known to be.  Now I need to know where Optimus Primal was last seen and his\n&gt; last coordinates.  I want to see if these events have a geological pattern\n&gt; that somehow leads to the center of activity.  We trace lines over the other\n&gt; locations and in the middle of that, is the exact location of our adversary.\n&gt;  Now we Also throw in the direction of the dinosaurs last path and that too\n&gt; will play a part as to giving us visual clues as how to solve this mystery\n&gt; and deal with it appropriately.  Slag I wish there was a holographic map in\n&gt; here, I could show you what I mean instead of just telling you about it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then thinks a bit more.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmmm, going back to Rodimus... Before we had our disagreement, I never did\n&gt; notice a shift in his IFF that would warrant a reversion back to Predacon\n&gt; status..  Come to think of it, I never got a positive ID on it.  That means\n&gt; either some other alien force has taken him or.... Perhaps constructed an\n&gt; evil clone and programmed him to act just like Rodimus himself.   Why didn&#39;t\n&gt; I notice this before?  Leo, the real Rodimus might be out there along with\n&gt; everyone else, inluding Optimus Primal.   That&#39;s it!  That&#39;s why they want\n&gt; Elita!  She&#39;s the daughter of a Prime!  DNA EXTRACTION!  THE ABILITY TO MAKE\n&gt; COPIES OF OURSELVES EQUAL IN STRENGTH AND INTELLIGENCE!  &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks to Leo Prime in grave concern.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Leo, I don&#39;t think we have much time, things could now go from bad to\n&gt; worse  and it could happen sooner than later.   Hydras should also be\n&gt; informed, this could effect all of us.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from LEO as he paused thoughtfully. &quot;I do not know\nwhere Primal was lost. We have not heard anything from him in quite\nsome time. I have been searching the communication&#39;s database but can\nfind nothing.&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME stepped over to the console as he continued to run through\nit. &quot;From what LEGACY tells me of his alternate future, they never\nfound Primal either, so I do not know if it will be any different for\nus here, but we need to search for him.&quot;\n\nHe looked back up at TUSCON, &quot;As for Rodimus, that is a possibility I\nhave considered as well and have been taking steps to find out. So far\nI have nothing conclusive. No one has any real scans of it to check\nagainst our computer database, but what we have to Legacy to examine.&quot;\n\nAs if hearing his name spoken LEGACY stepped out of the chamber where\nrepairs weere being attempted on SILVERBOLT.\n\n&quot;We have completed preliminary repairs on Silverbolt.&quot; he said without\nmuch in the way of preamble. &quot;It would seem that someone attempted to\nextract his spark directly from from his spark chamber.&quot; LEGACY paused\nmeaningfully, &quot;The method used was almost very similar to the one used\nduring the last large scale minion attack on the attack when I\narrived, although more advanced. And I am getting slight Unicronian\nenergy traces from Silverbolt&#39;s wound.&quot;\n\nSANTON stepped out, &quot;But I believe we have have him stable. It will\ntake time for him to recover.&quot; There was a small smile from the\nMaximal docotr, &quot;It is fortunate that Bantor did what he did to save\nhim. Had the extractor remained on SILVERBOLT another fraction of a\nmicr-second it would have breached extracted his spark.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
