Megatron was mad with Kitkat. It was her fault this\nwas\n&gt; going on. But, the bot must be an important bot if they want it so bad.\n&gt;     &quot;Kitkat! What the hell do you think your doing?&quot; He demanded, ready to\n&gt; pummle her with his closed fist. His eyes were closed into little angry\n&gt; crimsome slits.\n&gt;     Waspinator ran to the control boad and began to initiate more autoguns\n&gt; and re-routed power to the shields. He then turned to see if Megatron was\n&gt; going to beat Kitkat.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Aracnia oversaw the construction and was pleased. The shield generator\n&gt; was up and functional, and already they had twelve double barrle\nauto-guns.\n&gt; And with the forest around them, they had a great advantage.\n&gt;     &quot;Alright, Im going inside. Tarantulas you come too. I want to find out\n&gt; who these aliens are and why they made this bunker.&quot; She said, opening the\n&gt; hatch and getting ready to climb down.\n&gt;     Tarantulas walked over, &quot;Very well. I would like to investigate this\nnew\n&gt; technology myself.&quot;\n&gt;     Thw two arachnids entered the bunker and climbed into the darkness.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
