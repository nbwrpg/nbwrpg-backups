It will cover us \n&gt; from all \n&gt; &gt; thier sensors. We can leave ommiters in the base sending sensor \n&gt; ghosts of our \n&gt; &gt; numbers. As if preparing for the attack. They wont know weve \nleft. \n&gt; At that \n&gt; &gt; point we&#39;ll be hiding in the forest and swamps to the south of \nthe \n&gt; base. We \n&gt; &gt; can attack them from behind. It may give us a chance! We will \nstill \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; outnumbers.&quot; He sent out a comm to the Rouges. &quot;This is Hydras \nwe \n&gt; are in need \n&gt; &gt; of your assistance immediatly, and we will be in debt to you. \n&gt; Please come to \n&gt; &gt; my base immediatly.&quot; Quilldart grabbed all the magnet bombs and \nhe \n&gt; motiont \n&gt; &gt; for proto and starstorm to grab all the disguisers and headed to \n&gt; the base.\n\n\n"}}
