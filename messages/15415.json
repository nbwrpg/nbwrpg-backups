Dinobot had always stressed the fact that he despised \nemotions and closeness of any kind, especially when he was injured and \nfeeling vulnerable, as did any warrior. However, she soon found herself \nrelaxing in his strong grip, and hoping that this moment would never end. \nHer hands came to rest on his arms as she continued to gaze over at him, her \neyes half-glazed in contentment. She had never felt like this before, so... \nso... peaceful.\n\nThen the moment ended as quickly as it had begun, Dinobot once again \nretreating behind his barriers. With much reluctance Tavatron let her hands \ndrop to her sides, a momentary look of dissapointment crossed her face but \nvanished a second later as she regained her composure.\n\nTavatron&#39;s ears swivled forward at the sound of an all to familiar voice. It \nwas faint, but definitely there. The voice was quickly followed by the sound \nof gunfire as Tavatron rolled to the right, instinctively drawing her sword \nas she stood several feet from Dinobot, the shots barely passing overhead. \nShe was all business now, the past moment lingering on the edges of her \nmind, as if it were a dream. She growled menecingly at Dark One, though her \nwords were directed at Dinobot.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re in no condition to fight! I can handle myself! Take cover!&quot;\n\nTavatron&#39;s scanners were still too weak to be of much use, but her eyesight \nand fighting abilities were capable of defending and holding her ground if \nnecessary. Tavatron returned Dark One&#39;s fire, her optics glowing as she \ncharged them, finally releasing two powerful blasts at Dark One, the first \ndirected at his head, the second at his chest plate. Tavatron crouched \nbeside a rather large bush, chancing a glance in Dinobot&#39;s direction.\n\n&quot;My scanners are down! How many are there besides this one?&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
