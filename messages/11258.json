She stopped just \noutside the door and listened.  She overheard parts of the \nconversation. She transformed into wolf mode and walked out the front \ndoor to the base.  She walked around the rock walls and over to a \ntrees where she layed down under it.  She was doubting everything she \nthought she knew.  She wasn&#39;t sure what was going on.  Why was she \nthinking all of a sudden that Megatron wasn&#39;t a good leader? Why or \nwhere was she getting the idea that she could lead? She had never led \nanyone into anything. Nor had she ever had the chance to do so.  She \nwanted to lead and bring glory to the Predacons, not this confusion.  \nShe started to wonder if all the things that had gone wrong were her \nfault or not.\n\n\n"}}
