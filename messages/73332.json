The problem wasn&#39;t just isolated to the Earth,=\r\n it had also escalated outside the planet&#39;s atmosphere. At one time he thou=\r\nght he could vanquish evil all by himself, but things have made him all the=\r\n wiser and he realized that this problem was going to need the help of many=\r\n hands, not just his own. He looks thoughtfully to everyone, not knowing ho=\r\nw to convey his thoughts at first, but then he turns to the monitor and loo=\r\nks up to that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Thank you Legacy, it does make some sense of =\r\nhow large this problem has become. I admit, there are more of them, then th=\r\nere are of us. But that doesn&#39;t mean we give up our plight to protect this =\r\nplanet from future harm. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightshift hobbles over to Tucson.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I wish there was some way ta find out if there were more Aut=\r\nobots out there. We got a great team here but, we need more help.

I used ta be a communic=\r\nations operator on Iacon before we came to Earth. I could start putting a c=\r\nall out on Autobot frequency and see if anyone picks up.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucs=\r\non smiles and nods.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; It&#39;s a long shot but, a very good idea. =\r\nYes, please do that. Lord Elder if you could, allow Straightshot access to =\r\nTeletran One, and see if she can acquire an Autobot frequency. Legacy, I wo=\r\nuld like you to monitor that rip in the time space continuum and see if you=\r\n can get an idea as to who may have caused it. Remember, the more intel we =\r\nhave the better off we are.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He turns to Optimal Rodimus Prime=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are able to fly, we should scope the parameters acc=\r\nording to what Legacy comes up with. When we do the fly over, we have to ma=\r\nke it look like a casual flight rather than a probing mission. The humans w=\r\nho are here now , may not know what we are exactly, and we should keep it a=\r\ns such. They know Nightshift is a Maximal but they have not met us yet. Leo=\r\n, Big Convoy, we will need you to survey the ground areas where we can not =\r\nsee them from the air.
