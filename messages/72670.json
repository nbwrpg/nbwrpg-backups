The path\nagain was winding and in some places treacherous and narrow, but it\neventually dropped them off at the base of the mountain. At the same\ntime the snow, although light, was continuing to fall.\n\n&quot;There.&quot; POLAR CLAW said as he pointed with his paw. &quot;There is the\nauxiliary hatch. You can get in over there.&quot; What POLAR CLAW was\npointing at looked to be just another patch of the ever deepening\nsnow. If there was an opening, it was well hidden.\n\n(TAG)\n\n-Preston\n\n"}}
