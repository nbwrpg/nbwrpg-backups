If he had the design, he would gape his mouth. His long \nmultible digits he had on his right hand were spread out. He stared \nfor several moments, speechless. It was a day before when he \nremembered trying to get her to the CR room when she died on him, and \nnow she was alive, talking to Black Arachnia. \n\nHe slowly walked towards her, his face frozen in a stunned \nexpression. It was almost like seeing a ghost. He stepped to Black \nArachnia&#39;s side and swiftly turned his head towards her face.\n\n&quot;Ya did this?&quot; he stammered.\n\nJust then, he heard Dark Mouse say in a whispering tone that she was \ncold. He immediately snapped into action. &quot;Ah got uh pelt!&quot; he \nquickly said.\n\nHe bolted out of the room and ran down the corridors to his quarters. \nHe nearly slammed into the frame if he hadn&#39;t caught himself with his \nmulti-digited hand. He bent two long fingers against the side of the \nframe as he caught himself, but he ignored the pain. He dashed over \nto his bunk, where beneath the foot of it, was the fur pelt Rowdy \nWolf gave to him for his trip back to base. He snatched it up and ran \nback to the lab room. He nearly bent his fingers again catching \nhimself at the frame of the doorway. He ran back to the table side, \nhis face still a little wild.\n\nHe threw the fur pelt across Dark Mouse&#39;s body.\n\n&quot;Here,&quot; he quickly said. &quot;This better?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
