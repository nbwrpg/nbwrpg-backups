After Megatron stole the golder disks, along with the plans for \nthe transwarp, it really wasnt in use much and eventualy it was shut down. \nAlthough, one person did inhabit the station. His name was Xavier Minor, but \nhis nick name became Syco. The Maximal had a ruff life. His childhood was \nfilled with sexual molestation and abuse. I nhis teen years he became violent \nand was in and out of jail. as an adult, he turned into one of Cybertrons \nmost villianous criminals, a serial killer and rapist.\nSyco couldnt help his urges. Once he saw a female that seemed meek and \nhelpless, he struck. After the rape he would beat them until death. That was \nhis life, until he escaped onto the space station. For months he hid there, \ntrying to figure put what was wrong with him.\nWeeks came and went, and finally he decided he wasnt worthy to live in \nsocioty. He opened the transwarp tunnle, and went through in a stasis pod...\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Syco landed on prehistoric earth quickly. He landed in the middle of a \nprotohuman village and the DNA scanners selected his beast mode as, well, a \nhuman. He stepped out to the simple protohumans who looked at him and awe. \nSyco, with his stronger body, went after the human females of the village. \nWithin hours the females were violated, dead, and there children were \nmurdered. The men tried to fight Syco, but he killed most of them, the other \nfled into the jungles. :::\n\n::: Days later, he left the holocaust he had caused, once agian filled with \nguilt and remorse. He stumbled onto the Valley that was host to the Neo Beast \nwars...:::\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Syco ::: This place is filled with....hatred, Malice, concite...I can \nfeel it. This is where i must be stopped. THis is where I am to die.\n\n::: He made his way for hours until he came to the ship that the Allience \nused. He looked it over, and in his protohuman beast mode, went up to the \nship, and opened fire. :::\n\n"}}
