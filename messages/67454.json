Rodimus watched for another\n&gt; attack and was ready when Cyclonus released energy blasts from his\n&gt; hands, however he was now near the water and the sand was wet and\n&gt; weak. As Rodimus tried to push his legs to jump away one foot slipped\n&gt; and sunk deeper into the wet sand slowing him. The blasts strike\n&gt; Rodimus full force and send him back into the water. The fame designs\n&gt; on his chest were mostly scortched off and fracture points and tears\n&gt; were seen all over his armor. His yellow fenders on his back we badly\n&gt; dented. Luckily his joints and servos were all still in working\n&gt; order. Rodimus layed in the water. Was he hurt or playing possum?\n\nCyclonus&#39; optics brightened as he watched Rodimus fall and an internal\nwar fought itself within him, caution versus victory! \n\nFinally as if comming to some inner conclusion he leaped into the air,\neasily traversing the distance between himself and Rodimus Prime.
