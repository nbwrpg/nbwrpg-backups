He had given the order to attack, and that is what was going \nto happen.\n\nStill flying forward at full speed, the sixteen foot high robot raised both \nhands, palms outstretched.  Firing from the palms were invisible blasts of \ndestructive sonic energy at the CF.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher raised a left arm, the top of his wrist extening upward to reveal \na large barrel.  A grenade launched from his wrist, heading for the CF and \nset to explode on impact.\n\n---\n\n&quot;DIE HEATHEN SCUM!&quot; Reflector screamed into his comm. unit, the transmission \ngoing to all Maximal frequencies.\n\nFrom subspace a missile launcher appeared in the smallest of the Brotherhood \nmembers&#39; arms, two missiles erupting from its large barrel.  Reflector patted \nthe side of his rapid-firing missile launcher, but knew he couldn&#39;t keep it \nup or he&#39;d use all his missiles.  He simply watched with a giddy feeling as \nhis two missiles headed for the CF.\n\n"}}
