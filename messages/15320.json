But now things looked even worse. 5 of them had left,\n&gt; the numbers were dwindling. Maybe it wasn&#39;t such a good idea to elect\n&gt; Phobia to lead. There were only seven left, and two of them were near\n&gt; death! Starscream pleaded again with Phobia.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I guess will go with The Alliance now. If that&#39;s all right with you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Than Starscream whispered something in Drillbit&#39;s ear.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Becareful. I don&#39;t know if we can trust Phobia. I don&#39;t know if I\n&gt; can trust you, but most probably yes. I don&#39;t know if KitKat&#39;s safety\n&gt; is the important thing on his agenda. Remember, if you need me, i&#39;m\n&gt; just a comm message away. And watch Megatron carefully if you see\n&gt; him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream turned to the Alliance member.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I guess I&#39;ll be going with you now.&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix lifted up Ramulus&#39; spark, and carefully placed it in one hand.\n&gt; Of course it was floating, but you get the idea.
