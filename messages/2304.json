I&#39;ll be \nsending you a private to e-mail somethings I&#39;m having a little trouble \ngrasping with your guys and base, like you not posting that much for a \nmissile towards the chin of Radistor, which if you did sorry, its just having \nhim grunt and fall over isn&#39;t that descriptive of his position))\n\nOblitertron/Koga Shuko/Hades/Anubis/Nemesis Enforcer/Unitron/Double \nPunch/Manterror/Injector:\n\nThe massive Oblitertron&#39;s knees almost buckled, yelling in pain from shots to \nhis upper body, his buttocks lightly charred and hurting like Hell.  Raising \nhis plasma rifle, he fired off three bolts at Radistor&#39;s already damaged \nsternum, simultaneously firing off a continous blast of yellowish red flames \nat Radistor&#39;s face, firing a single optic blast at his knee, his optics&#39; \ncolor brightening as he fired, slowly dimming back to its regular light as \nthe build up of energy left.\n------------------\nScattershot sighed, kind of running out of bombs.  -Slag it all to the Pit!  \nIf I would&#39;ve known I&#39;d be dealing with this guy I would&#39;ve built a nuclear \nfriggin&#39; warhead- taking out two of some of his last charges, he threw them \ndown at Radistor&#39;s chest from the side.\n------------------\nNemesis Enforcer sighed, getting a little bored, firing off an optic blast at \nthe People&#39;s base, a rocket escaping his missile launcher, heading straight \nfor Radistor&#39;s middle abdomen area.\n------------------\nKoga Shuko raised his missile launcher, firing off a rocket at Radistor&#39;s \nright knee, firing two optic blasts at the base at the same time.\n------------------\nAnubis was getting really bored, he&#39;d seen the gestalts, then got bored.  The \nonly fun thing was the slight kick he got about shooting someone while \nthey&#39;re down.  Raising his missile launcher, he fired a rocket off at \nRadistor&#39;s left chest.\n&quot;Shuko,&quot; he whispered, &quot;do we have to keep this up?&quot; he whined, still hurting.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll jump the Alliance guy in front of us when rockets are gone.&quot; he \nwhispered back.\n\n-----------------\nHades was getting really mad now.  He felt as if death wasn&#39;t bending to his \nwill like it was supposed to.  Raising his missile launcher, he fired a \nrocket off at Radistor&#39;s chin.\n-----------------\n&quot;The slag with this!&quot; Unitron yelled, firing off his last rocket at the \nPeople&#39;s base tossing the launcher into the air, the launcher disappeared \ninto subspace, taking out his two laser rifles, waiting for an oppertunity.\n-----------------\n\n===============================\n\nInjector, Manterror, and Double Punch all got out of their repairing units at \nthe same time coincidently, looking around after doing some stretches.\n\n&quot;Dang, I hate this slag.&quot; Injector said, leaning against a CR chamber, \nlooking through the window.  &quot;Holy slag, the pride of the Predacons has \nspotted something!&quot;\n-----------\n&quot;What do you see, Injector?&quot; Double Punch asked, looking in through the \nwindow smiling.  &quot;Everyone step back!&quot; he yelled, everyone doing so, he \nstepped back eight feet, raising his pincher.  &quot;FIRE!&quot; he yelled, firing off \ntwo missiles at the CR chamber.\n-----------\nInjector sighed, firing off a stinger missile at the chamber\n-----------\nManterror laughed evily, firing off two ion disks at the middle of the \nchamber.  &quot;Who&#39;s CR chamber was that?&quot;\n-----------\n&quot;That fat dragon guy&#39;s that we shot at outisde.&quot; he said, howles laughter \nechoing through the large room as they left to go find Hell Beast and get \norders,  leaving Drozom in his CR chamber, with whatever damage he/the \nchamber had taken.\n\n"}}
