It would have been better if we had had a council discussion with regards to the situation though. Analysis is best.\n\nLN:\n\nAlright, calm down and listen. You seem to be missing what I was trying to say. I think you&#39;d better reread my last post, and rethink your &#39;speech&#39;.\n\nI&#39;ll admit, my last post was somewhat one sided, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from believing that mistakes can&#39;t be fixed. You say that I appease whiners? (Appease is not quite the right word for what you were trying to say, look it up in the dictionary.) How can you possibly consider them whiners when I spend more of my time trying figure out how to deal with you?! \n\nWhen you say the popular people get their ways, why do you say that those people are popular?\n\n||... If you really want to be a good council member rauq and let the RPG develop then let charachters live through the choice they make. ...||\n\nCharacters develope in the rpg without our help all the time. Choices only decide certain outcomes. What do you have to lose by letting BN return to Airly&#39;s control? (look at my examples in the below paragraph) Only some stuff gets erased, and that stuff is simply incorrect in the rpg.\n\nWell. I never (this is a damning word, so i&#39;ll prolly get slapped later for it) said you have to erase your posts; I wanted you to talk to Airly and figure out how you can somehow allow BN to return to Airly&#39;s control. I don&#39;t want you to &quot;kill&quot; your story line, and I don&#39;t want you to erase the past. What I do want you to do, is to work out a side story line where BN somehow escapes, or the Infecticons bug her and use her as a spy, or (as Orchestra was trying to do) have a bot remove her spark and give her a new body, or something else. I seem to be able to think of many ideas, can you think of any?\n\nJust because a choice was made in the past, doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s results can&#39;t change in the futur. True, Airly might be regretting her decision now, but instead of simply whining about it, she is doing something. NOW, before I say anything more, I&#39;d like to know, Airly, if you have said anything to LN, with respect to getting BN out of her predicament.\n\nFocus your misguided anger in a productive direction; don&#39;t prove your instability to the rpg, nobody needs/wants to hear it.\n\n\n"}}
