I did delete that post and I rewrote it.  Tucson hasn&#39;t mo=\r\nved, he&#39;s signalled Noctorro to move in slowly, and in phases.  He&#39;s going =\r\nto now stand back and let the fuzors begin their work.  But he&#39;s also going=\r\n to give the impression of complete surrender at the same time.  \n\nMeanwhil=\r\ne, Uproar and Quickstride are completely at a loss as to how to fix things =\r\nat the Ark.  And now, they&#39;re going to look up to Rodimus to do the right t=\r\nhing.  Both of them are rookie Maximals, so do expect some comic relief fro=\r\nm those two.  Uproars biggest weakness is his perpetual curiosity which is =\r\nharmless enough but often gets him into sticky situations.  Quickstride&#39;s w=\r\neakness is often his scatterbrained nature, which also provides a little co=\r\nmic relief.  If Rodimus can put these two guys on the right track, then he =\r\nshouldn&#39;t have any reasons to doubt himself as a leader.\n\nHope this helps. =\r\nBTW, Tucson is willing to meet with Legacy, on neutral grounds, but feels i=\r\nt&#39;s best that Legacy does leave the Ark for saftey purposes.  Remember, he =\r\ndoes have that weakness for losing his temper, and he may have made it soun=\r\nd rather harsh, when he informed Legacy that he was to vacate the Ark.  But=\r\n in doing so, he could privately meet with the bot to try and get an idea a=\r\ns to what page he&#39;s actually on, and why he&#39;s doing what he&#39;s doing.  And i=\r\nf he has indeed turned evil.  Tucson is extremely confused as to why Legacy=\r\n would intentionally harm his comrades, and he&#39;s hiding confusion behind hi=\r\ns anger.  But he will not make any violent actions against him, he just wan=\r\nts honest answers.  \n\nOkay, that&#39;s definitely it for now.    Haven&#39;t gone t=\r\nhis far yet, just something to run by you before we go with it.\n\n--- In nbw=\r\nrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Oka=\r\ny, I am confused.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Sandy I am not trying to be critical, so please don=\r\n&#39;t take it that way, but\n&gt; your post is sort of unfair. You start your post=\r\n with Tuscon in the middle\n&gt; of a very tense stand off with him being defen=\r\nsless and you end it with him\n&gt; being on the way to the Ark.  Basically you=\r\n made no allowance for someone,\n&gt; presumably Hydras, to stop Tuscon from le=\r\naving - which is what most evil bad\n&gt; guys would do.\n&gt; \n&gt; In message #70973=\r\n the demand was that the Maximals and Autobots lay down\n&gt; thier weapons if =\r\nthey wanted Nightlight to live.\n&gt; \n&gt; In message #70975 Tuscon gives the ord=\r\ner for all the Maximals and such to\n&gt; comply. And in that post you write th=\r\nat Night Shift subspaces his weapon, as\n&gt; Straight Shot transforms into her=\r\n robot mode, disarming her own weaponry as\n&gt; well.\n&gt; \n&gt; In message #70978 T=\r\nuscon lays down his weapon and in Message #70987 Kup and\n&gt; Talon do the sam=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; This would mean that all of the Maximals and Autobots in that area =\r\nare now\n&gt; weaponless, and so pretty much defenceless. At the same time much=\r\n of the\n&gt; Predacon army is standing there, either in front of them, or flyi=\r\nng over\n&gt; head. I had posted that the preds were picking up those discarded=\r\n weapons\n&gt; while other were watching.\n&gt; \n&gt; However in message #70988 Tuscon=\r\n is able to pick up a weapon, aim it at\n&gt; someone, then with the help of th=\r\ne other Maximals choose not to fire, they\n&gt; are able to talk back and forth=\r\n a few times, salute each other and then\n&gt; Tuscon drives off with no one st=\r\nopping him.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do we reconcile all of that? Since you already had Tus=\r\ncon sending\n&gt; messages out and your characters already responding, if we ha=\r\nd someone stop\n&gt; you in the middle of all of that, it would make it confusi=\r\nng as to what\n&gt; happened and what didn&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tuscon should not have been =\r\nable to point a weapon, talk, transform and\n&gt; drive away with no response. =\r\nDoes that make sense? Anything we post in the\n&gt; middle of that would only c=\r\nonfuse things worse.\n&gt; \n&gt; We might need some editing. Like Tuscon just does=\r\n the first part of that,\n&gt; but not leave yet. Allow the rest of us to post =\r\na response first, then if it\n&gt; is reasonable based on the responses he leav=\r\nes?\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, not trying to to be critical, but keeping it fair.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pre=\r\nston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Jan 22, 2011 at 7:58 AM, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I did an edit but I guess I&#39;ll add Uproar back =\r\nin.

Then a\n&gt; &gt; his=\r\ns of his hydraulics and he rolls away toward the Ark.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus, the=\r\n situation at the Ark has escalated.

He looked to turn into a lion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The th=\r\nird was Ramulus (http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ramulus) who had like the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oth=\r\ners been on patrol for a while, surveying the area and trying to keep\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; free from Predacon invasion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They also come up beside R=\r\nodimus, Leo II, obviously the leader of the\n&gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; two, &quot;What now =\r\nsir?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus looked at Quickstride and Uproar, &quot;Well let&#39;s get=\r\n out of sight,\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then we can discuss it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Meanwhil=\r\ne Inside the Ark:*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor had received Tuscon&#39;s message and =\r\nsent attempted to send a\n&gt; &gt; message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Lord elder, however at the mo=\r\nment there was no answer from the elder\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the s=\r\name time Legacy was still standing in the med lab along with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; othe=\r\nrs, his single optic glowing in the darkness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It would seem th=\r\nat Nightlight&#39;s vital systems are being held at minimal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; levels.&quot; Lega=\r\ncy said as he directed his gaze to the wall panel nearest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight.=\r\n A small light blinked, indicating her spark was still online,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but th=\r\nat there was not enough power to reboot her systems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He turned =\r\nto look at the others, his face glowing in the darkness, lit by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his o=\r\nwn optic, and the glowing bar on his chest plate. He raised his\n&gt; &gt; right\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; hand in the air, the one with the arm cannon on it and begin to emit\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; light\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from it, much like a flash light or a beacon so that the roo=\r\nm was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; illuminated. He casually looked around, &quot;Perhaps we could locat=\r\ne a back\n&gt; &gt; out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or reserve power system . . . &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy p=\r\naused as Tuscon&#39;s message came in. He turned to look at Santon,\n&gt; &gt; Bump\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; and Perceptor, a look of disbelief momentarily flashing across his face=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy straightened as his cold voice comes across the channe=\r\nl, &quot;I will\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comply with your command. I have been tasked with =\r\n. . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt; . .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; . the protection of the Ark as well as that o=\r\nf the Matrix. I will not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowingly leave the Ark undefended or the Ma=\r\ntrix in the hands of\n&gt; &gt; another.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy turned to look at his=\r\n console as he understoodf what happened.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Communications had been cut=\r\n part way through his message. He turned to\n&gt; &gt; look\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at the others, h=\r\nis single optic cold, &quot;It is illogical to believe that I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would attemp=\r\nt to harm the Ark or allow anyone to take it from the\n&gt; &gt; Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
