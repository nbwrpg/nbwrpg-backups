It\n&gt; wasn&#39;t going to be easy but she would make sure that it was done, and\nright\n&gt; as well.\n&gt; But as she thought about that ship she couldn&#39;t help but wonder what prowl\n&gt; was up to and what he was doing at the moment, hoping that he was alright.\n&gt; The last she had seen of him was running out to defend the ship with\n&gt; Kluster, and she hadn&#39;t seen him since.\n&gt; She just hoped he was OK.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________:)\n&gt;\n&gt; Zyber:\n&gt;\n&gt; * The opening to her den was just to her right, hidden under the snow\n&gt; covered branches of a pine that grew just outside the enterance.\n&gt; It had taken her nearly three mega-cycles just to get this far, and if she\n&gt; hadn&#39;t had this stasis locked bot on her back she would have only been 1\n&gt; hour instead.\n&gt; She staggered into the confines of her den and looked around, noting that\nit\n&gt; was more dusty then she had left it and needed to be cleaned.\n&gt; But, first she had to get this bot off her back and she wasn&#39;t about to\njust\n&gt; leave him on the floor.\n&gt; Zyber begin to slowly move towards the back of her cave where there was a\n&gt; smaller one, one that she liked to call her bed chamber.\n&gt; It took her a good 5 mins to get to the opening of the second cave,\nlooking\n&gt; around and finding just the place she had planned to set him.\n&gt; It was a raised platform of rock with a bit of a dip in the middle, even\n&gt; furs placed along and over it to make quite a place to sleep on cold\nwinter\n&gt; nights.\n&gt; She finally made it over to her furs and then tilted her back, the great\n&gt; bulk of DeathSkyth ( don&#39;t mind if I spelled it wrong, please) sliding\nfrom\n&gt; her back and her sighing in relief.\n&gt; Zyber hopped off the furs and quickly transformed into robot mode, moving\n&gt; the great beast so that he would be more comfortable when he awoke.\n&gt; Then she quickly created a small fire in the center of the room so that it\n&gt; would no longer be cold, and a stasis locked bot could always benifit from\n&gt; heat while damamged.\n&gt; Once the fire was alight and moved from the room and began to tidy up her\n&gt; den a bit while she got a few things ready for DeathSkyth.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
