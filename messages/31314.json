Razor Claw dased forward in Wolverine mode\nunknowingly about the problems with mutant signatures and the shields.\nLunarpine reached out to stop him but he was already gone.\n\nThe wolverine shot through the shields as if they didn&#39;t exist. Ice and\nLunarpine exchanged confused looks and decided to follow. The shields\nrecognized thier signatures and allowed safe passage. The three turned\ntoward the mountains in the distance where the mutants had parked thier\ntransport pod.\n\nLunarpine stopped in his tracks as if he&#39;d run into a wall. He turned toward\nthe sceen nearby. The wind wasn&#39;t very strong but he could catch the faint\nscent of a certain wolf. &quot;Slayer&quot; he growled remembering thier last meeting.\nIce sensed his emotion change. &quot;It&#39;s time to go my love.&quot; she said adding\nthe end to try to change his mood.\n\nOn the plains in thier path stood Megaton wings outstretched like the eagle\non the American coat of arms.  And somewhere beyond the mutant dragon was\nSlayer. Razor Claw walked slightly ahead before turning back. &quot;I thought we\nwere leaving.&quot; the Wolverine said, &quot;newly confused by the situation.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Megan Solmonson &lt;tmrattrap@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, March 29, 2001 5:33 PM\nSubject: Situations.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m behind on posts so if any of this is wrong could someone please tell\nme?\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor lifted a brow when she suddenly heard a voice over the\n&gt; comm-link, on an emergency frequency too.\n&gt; Who was in trouble?\n&gt; She though for a sec, wondering if she should reply right away...but she\n&gt; decided not to until she checked something.\n&gt; Iron Raptor opened a link to Epyon.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Epyon, are you getting this?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She relayed the code that basically read out the transmission recieved.\n&gt; Iron wondered if they were already working on it, though, her question was\n&gt; answered when the console infront of her lit up with a 3D scan of Hudson\n&gt; Bay, showing just the location where the tranmission was coming from.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmm.......how?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iris peeked around the corner but then went back to her place, moving\n&gt; towards the doors leading outside, then exiting the base.\n&gt; Iron Raptor couldn&#39;t believe how blind she was lately, missing such\n&gt; important things like this...though the battle outside she already knew\n&gt; about.\n&gt; &lt; If they&#39;re firing at the base they&#39;re enemies and you should fire back,\n&gt; the last thing we need now is another battle.&gt;\n&gt; With a flick of a switch Iron activated the base shields, but relayed in a\n&gt; code that would allow any bot with a Maximal signature or one the base\n&gt; recognized as an occupent of this ship pass through unharmed, while\nenemies\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t get past it.\n&gt; Though, now to deal with that message.\n&gt; Tapping a few keys on the console Iron incripted a code before opening a\n&gt; channel to that frequency, one that would only relay her voice and not her\n&gt; signature or location.\n&gt; She spoke.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; This is Iron Raptor, Maximal Commander.
