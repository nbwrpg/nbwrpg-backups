They continued training untill they were done with the\n&gt; session, and then Supernova opened his comm to Zardus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Commander,&quot; he transmitted to Zardus, &quot;this is Supernova. Requesting\n&gt; permission to join the Gestalt League for the IGL.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Antagony had been looking for Zardus, and then she saw him walking\n&gt; through one of the hallways of the Iron Fist. She jogged to catch up\n&gt; with him, and finally reached him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hello, sir,&quot; she said when she approached, &quot;I&#39;m Antagony, the new\n&gt; Alliance member. Perndabot said that I should talk to you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cepta saw Squacktalk get killed, turning around and running out of\n&gt; the room, trying to get as far away from that place as she could. She\n&gt; was very scared, and wasn&#39;t used at all to such violence.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
