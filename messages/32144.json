The shots hit him but do little damage. He kisses\nher.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll see you after the battle, love. Be careful,&quot; he says and jumps\nup, flying at Choran and firing two signature seeking missiles from\neach one of his two missile launchers at the bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus flies up, most of the shots missing him. He turns around,\nfiring two more energy draining at Unitron. The two he had previously\nfired adjust their course, heading for Unitron again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIncarcinator fires once, destroying the missile heading for him. He\naims at Unitron, firing two more shells.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKillfest jumps back, two missiles hitting the ground in front of him.\nHe lands the explosion failing to take him off his feet, though\nshrapnel scratches his armor. He fires his optics at Vehement&#39;s\nmissile, destroying it.\n\nKillfest aims, firing two missiles and an EMP shot at Vehement.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer roars, slamming his fist into the two missiles. They\nexplode, making him step back to keep his balance, his arm charred but\nfuntional. He looks around for a target and sees Sun Crusher, firing\ntwo missiles from each launcher at him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther watches Double Punch fire at EndBringer, and then his scanner\nlocks on to Double Punch&#39;s signature. He smiles.\n\n&quot;Gotcha!&quot; he mumbles to himself, firing four charges down at Double\nPunch. Scyther was still cloaked.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe two fireballs hit Demise, but he didn&#39;t care. He jumps up, easily\nreaching Flesh Ripper and grabbing at him.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (I have quite a bit of enemy fire to post for, so please correct me\nif I miss \n&gt; any attacks)\n&gt; \n&gt; The Protectobots/The Oblitercons/Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark\nClaw/Nemesis\n&gt;\nEnforcer/Scattershot/Imprisoner/Predator/Choran/Shockwave/Unitron/Firestarter/\n&gt; Double Punch/Manterror/Injector/Vehement/Sun\nCrusher/Reflector/Smokescreen:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf&#39;s boosters in his feet activated, sending him blasting\noff into \n&gt; the air, a dozen rapid shots tearing at his armored legs.\n&gt; \n&gt; He let out a howl of pain, raising his sword and firing a blade\nmissile at \n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire.  A blue orb of EMP energy formed in his free\nhand and \n&gt; he threw it downward, and when it hit the ground, if everyone stayed\nin their \n&gt; place it would go off and an EMP field would hit Alecto and Kali.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper pushed himself up, looking at Scavenger for only a\nmicro-second \n&gt; and looking back to Demise, who was chargin him.  He fired three\nfire balls \n&gt; from his mouth at the charging Predacon&#39;s torso, boosters in his\nfeet lifting \n&gt; him up off the dead ground.  He looked to Demon Wulf, knowing it was\ntime to \n&gt; use a large amount of energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw felt two missiles strike his frame and he cursed.  His\narmor was \n&gt; nearly penetrated.  His sensors detected a large amount of enemy\nrobots, and \n&gt; his brothers that were gaining altitude.  He armed his launchers,\nfiring two \n&gt; missiles at the Cybertronian Fire.  The other launcher fired two \n&gt; energy-signature seeking missiles.  One at Luzbel and the other at\nWrath.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark One surveyed his team.  Or what was left of it.  Sensors told\nhim Hiss \n&gt; was critical and Scavenger was almost there.  Of course, Dark One\ndidn&#39;t need \n&gt; scanners to tell him this.  He searched around for his plasma rifle, \n&gt; eventually finding it.  He raised the rifle, firing off a couple pot\nshots \n&gt; off at Demon Wulf and started walking backwards towards Hiss.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Breakdown jumpd, two stinger missiles exploding where he had been. \nHe went \n&gt; flying through the air, landing on his feet painfully.  He let out a\nyell, \n&gt; raising his rifle and firing off two grenades upwards, only these\nwere set to \n&gt; explode after five seconds, not on impact.  The greandes themselves\nwould not \n&gt; hit Injector, but the explosions should.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Pyro raised his flame cannon, firing off a long burst of flames at\ntwo \n&gt; incoming missiles, the missiles detonating prematurely.  Pyro raised\nan arm \n&gt; in defense, the explosion not doing that much damage.  The flames\ndidn&#39;t hurt \n&gt; him, and the shrapnel only caused a few cuts.\n&gt; \n&gt; His weapons were useless against Vehement, so he decided to pick a\nnew \n&gt; target.  He raised his cannon, firing off two fire balls at\nAbominous, hoping \n&gt; his weapons would hurt the behemoth.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hiss and Scavenger slipped into stasis lock due to extensive damage,\nunaware \n&gt; of anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Spot dodged enemy fire, firing off a fire ball at one of the\nHeadstrong \n&gt; holograms.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Groove fired off two more photon blasts at Abominous, not sure if he\ncould \n&gt; even hurt it with the puny weapon he had.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Blades&#39; armor was torn apart as rapid laser energy dug into him.  He\nlet out \n&gt; a yell, firing off twenty highly-explosive shells at Unitron.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; First Aid didn&#39;t get a response from the robot that had saved him,\nso he \n&gt; turned away and activated his scanners, attempting to find any\nMaximals who \n&gt; needed medical attention.  He saw the incoming missiles and ducked\ndown.  But \n&gt; the missiles changed course and found him, exploding and sending him\ninto the \n&gt; air a few feet, crashing down, his frame a charred mess.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Streetwise looked to the damaged First Aid and let out a yell and\ncharged \n&gt; Reflector&#39;s general direction, firing off three photon blasts at\nhim.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer raised his weapon, some kind of explosive energy\nstriking \n&gt; him in the back.  He let outa yell.  But it was more of a yell of\nsurprise \n&gt; then pain since the blast had hit his powerful wings instead any\nexposed \n&gt; parts.  He turned around and cursed.  &quot;Traitor!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot raised his rifle, firng off twenty-five armor piercing\nrounds at \n&gt; Abominous&#39; left shoulder.  &quot;Take that Maximal!&quot; he screamed,\nfollowed by \n&gt; laughter.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Imprisoner felt Element weapons fire strike him, but he ignored the\npain.  \n&gt; Instead, he armed more missiles and fired four missiles off at the \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire.  The laser cannon swiveled and firing off three\nblasts at \n&gt; Darkfate.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Predator jumped over an EMP blast, the shock wave of the blast\ncausing him to \n&gt; crash to his knee painfully.  &quot;Sons of...&quot; he mumbled, firing off\ntwo rockets \n&gt; from his launcher at the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Choran raised an arm to block Element autogun fire and cursed, the\nannoying \n&gt; shots digging into his armor.  He fired off twenty-five rapid laser\nblasts at \n&gt; Iron Raptor.\n&gt; &quot;Take that vile witch.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave pulled up, gaining altitude quickly and pulling hard\nleft.  That \n&gt; would take care of regular weapons fire.  But he detected two\nES-seeking \n&gt; missiles.  He fired down ten rapid laser blasts vertically at the\nmissiles \n&gt; straight at their path.  He armed his launchers, firing down two\nmissiles at \n&gt; Killfest.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron&#39;s scanners detected the draining field and he pulled up to\navoid it, \n&gt; going diagonally up, two plasma blasts from Steel striking his\nunderbelly as \n&gt; well as five highly explosive shells from Blades.  The rest of the\nshots \n&gt; passed by him harmlessly.  He cursed, something about &quot;irritating\ntraitors&quot;, \n&gt; and pulled down again, smoke coming out of the bottom of his space\nfighter \n&gt; form.  He armed his weapons, firing twenty-five rapid laser blasts\nat Zardus \n&gt; and launched two missiles.  Both ES-seeking missiles.  One at Steel\nand the \n&gt; other at Incarcinator.\n&gt; \n&gt; His sensors detected the shell of Incarcinator&#39;s that had barely\nmissed him.  \n&gt; He thought for an astro-second and formulated a plan on how to deal\nwith them.\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; The flame-red space fighter did a basic rolling maneuver, only two\nof six \n&gt; shots striking his armored wing, causing dents and affecting his\nvelocity.  A \n&gt; missile from the Element passed by during his maneuver, causing no\ndamage as \n&gt; it eventually exploded far away from Firestarter. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You call yourselves Predacons and conquerers?  Yet you align\nyourself with \n&gt; the Autobots!  Oh, you&#39;ll die!  Don&#39;t think you won&#39;t be executed\nfor your \n&gt; crimes!&quot; he screamed in anger.  There were to many people and not\nenough \n&gt; things going well for the Empire.  He fired off four missiles, two \n&gt; energy-signature seeking missiles that spread out, one heading for\nTwister \n&gt; and the other for Venomous.\n&gt; \n&gt; The two other missiles screamed through the air towards the\nCybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; The cloaked ex-Predacon assassin raised his pincher, watching\nBeeline destroy \n&gt; two missiles inbound for Vehement and one heading for Manterror with\nits \n&gt; optic weapons.\n&gt; \n&gt; His left pincher launched two energy-signature seeking missiles off\nat \n&gt; EndBringer&#39;s left arm.  The other pinche raised, firing two missiles\nat the \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire.  He began to jog away from where he was so when\npeople \n&gt; fired he would be somewhat safe.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror saw the incoming missile and laughed, but then yelled when\nit \n&gt; exploded against his exo-skeleton, the heavy armor dented from the\nexplosion. \n&gt;  &quot;You Maximals are getting irritating...&quot; he sighed, raising his\npinchers and \n&gt; firing off a total of four ion disks at Luzbel.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector saw rapid fire from Shivah and he flew to the side, five\nshots \n&gt; digging into his armor.  He clenched his mouth shut in pain,\nmomentarily \n&gt; putting pressure on the wound.  He raised his right arm, firing off\ntwo \n&gt; stinger missiles at Shivah from the launcher he held.  He didn&#39;t\nnotice \n&gt; Breakdown&#39;s shots and when they went off as planned the explosion\nhit \n&gt; Injector.\n&gt; \n&gt; The insect went flying backwards through the air, multiple cuts\nleaking \n&gt; mech-fluid.  His charred form began screaming and ranting, firing\noff ten \n&gt; rapid laser blasts from his optic sensors at Breakdown after he\nstabalized \n&gt; himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Smokescreen got set up and took aim, firing off a blast from his\nheavy-laser \n&gt; rifle at Vehement&#39;s head.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement was struck dead on with Darkfate&#39;s megablaster, and\nunknowingly \n&gt; knocked him out of the way of enemy weapons fire.  He cursed and\nsputtered \n&gt; angrily.  He raised his rigth arm, the cannon where a hand should be\nlaunched \n&gt; off two missiles.  One at Darkfate, the other at Killfest.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher raised his arm to block incoming Element autogun fire,\nlaughing.  \n&gt; He was struck from a missile and he turned around cursing as a\nsearing pain \n&gt; filled his body from the explosion.  He raised his arm, firing two\nmissiles \n&gt; off at Reptilica.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector flew down, avoiding most weapons fire accept for two\nphoton bolts \n&gt; that impacted with his chest plate.  He looked down momentarily to\nsee a \n&gt; molten dent in his chest and he looked up with rage in his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised both arms, firing off a total of four energy-signature\nseeking \n&gt; missiles at Streetwise.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Serpentor laughed at his shot against Nemesis Enforcer.  So well\nplanned.  \n&gt; Join the Alliance, kill that bastard Nemesis Enforcer and end the\nvendetta.  \n&gt; But an unexpected thing happned. The plasma blast he had fired\ndidn&#39;t hit \n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer&#39;s head, but struck his wings, which Serpentor knew\nfrom \n&gt; experience were near indestructable.\n&gt; \n&gt; He yelped as rapid laser fire from his long time foe headed down\ntowards him, \n&gt; knocking him to his back with a few dents in his abdomen.\n\n\n"}}
