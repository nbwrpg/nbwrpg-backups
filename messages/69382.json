Knowing that their only hope o=\r\nf survival was to\n&gt;&gt; safely crash land, the pilot picked an open area of oc=\r\nean and tried to\n&gt;&gt; approach at a safe angle to slow itself enough to keep =\r\nthe ship intact.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus and his crew walked along the bridge th=\r\nat crossed the gap\n&gt;&gt; between the part of the island where the hangers were=\r\n located and the\n&gt;&gt; peninsula area where the base sat. Suddenly the sky bec=\r\name dark and a\n&gt;&gt; rumbling noise could be heard, growing louder and louder.=\r\n He looked up to\n&gt;&gt; see almost the whole sky occupied by a massive starship=\r\n seemly heading\n&gt;&gt; straight for the island. The Atlantis emergency alarm st=\r\narted to sound and\n&gt;&gt; civilians rushed to their shelters.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Everyone! =\r\nTo the base! Hurry!&quot; ordered Perseus breaking out into a run.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The rum=\r\nbling sound continued to get louder. As Perseus and his crew\n&gt;&gt; reached\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nthe base door, it was quickly opened for them then shut behind them. He\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nordered everyone to move the lower level of the base. As the ship passed\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n over the island, the sound grew so loud that the ground shook and weaker\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; parts of buildings started to crumble, as in an earthquake. The ship\n&gt;&gt; t=\r\nraveled for another three miles before it touched down in the deep ocean\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n waters. The force of the impact sent the ship hundreds of feet below the\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; surface and it continued to sink until coming to rest on the top of an\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n underwater mountain. The mass of water displaced by the ship started a\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nmassive tsunami-like wave, going out in all directions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The ground be=\r\ngan to shake again and the lights flickered inside the\n&gt;&gt; Maximal\n&gt;&gt; base.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Sir, what&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing the last heavy door =\r\nto\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; underground section of the base.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The lights continued to=\r\n flicker, then went out.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At that moment the ten-story-high wall of wa=\r\nter struck Atlantis from the\n&gt;&gt; east, picking up all the boats in the harbo=\r\nr and tossing them onto the\n&gt;&gt; land.\n&gt;&gt; The parts of the docks that were no=\r\nt made of concrete were pushed up and\n&gt;&gt; destroyed. A moment later the wate=\r\nr hit the buildings in the lower wharf\n&gt;&gt; area and they immediately collaps=\r\ned under the intense weight of water.\n&gt;&gt; Likewise the metal dome that made =\r\nup the upper story of the Maximal base\n&gt;&gt; was\n&gt;&gt; immediately ripped from it=\r\ns foundations and carried away, along with\n&gt;&gt; everything in the command cen=\r\nter, the armory, mess hall, and the main bank\n&gt;&gt; of CR chambers were also p=\r\nicked up and carried away.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The lower floor of the base had a large me=\r\ntal slab to protect it from\n&gt;&gt; bombing, and as the water continued to pour =\r\nover it, everything on the\n&gt;&gt; upper\n&gt;&gt; floors was ripped away, leaving a cl=\r\nean plate of metal sitting at the\n&gt;&gt; bottom\n&gt;&gt; of the crater that was the b=\r\nase. The buildings along the center of the\n&gt;&gt; town\n&gt;&gt; were a little sturdie=\r\nr and remained standing, though heavily damaged. The\n&gt;&gt; hanger and all the =\r\ncraft in it were picked up and thrown into the ocean.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As the water ca=\r\nme to tower it filled up the deep trench around the\n&gt;&gt; structure\n&gt;&gt; then th=\r\ne wall hit it, wrapping it entirely except for the top five\n&gt;&gt; stories,\n&gt;&gt; =\r\ndamaging supports, breaking out all the windows and destroying the bridges\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; that allowed access to the tower. The wave then continued across the res=\r\nt\n&gt;&gt; of the island, destroying buildings and carrying away the mass of debr=\r\nis,\n&gt;&gt; and then all was eerily quiet.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0083_01C9E119.5D1F1580\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Dutf-8&gt;\n&lt;META=\r\n content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6001.18226&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=3DMai=\r\nlContainerBody \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 10px; PADDING-LEFT: 10px; PADDING-T=\r\nOP: 15px; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; \nbgColor=3D#ffffff leftMargin=3D0 topM=\r\nargin=3D0 CanvasTabStop=3D&quot;true&quot; \nname=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Talon&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&quot;So are we moving To L=\r\nord Elder&quot;said soflty \nTalon&quot;What about that decepticon named Megatron, and=\r\n what about Rodimus and \nNightlight&quot;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt Tahoma&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #f5f5f5&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;font-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;=\r\n/B&gt; &lt;A title=3Dkraftlos@... \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:kraftlos@...&quot;&gt;Kraft=\r\nlos&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Sunday, May 10, 2009 10:36 PM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nB&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \ntitle=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&#10;CTRL + clic para s=\r\neguir el v=C3=ADnculo&quot; \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; Re: The Crash Landing and Afterm=\r\nath&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT \nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial si=\r\nze=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Salveo landed their last r=\r\nemaining shuttle atop the metal slab that&lt;BR&gt;once \nwas the Maximal Base.

What=\r\n they want is to \ndestroy&lt;BR&gt;us, and they will follow us wherever we decide=\r\n to have our base. \nAs&lt;BR&gt;for that crashed ship, I dont think its wise to m=\r\nount a \nexpedition&lt;BR&gt;while the city lies in ruin and we remain \nbaseless.&quot;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Right, so priority one, help the city and recover what we can \nfro=\r\nm&lt;BR&gt;our base.&quot; replied Salveo.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Correct.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On 4/30/09, &lt;A \nhr=\r\nef=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002%40hotmail.com&quot;&gt;airly2002@hotmail.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;&lt;A=\r\n \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002%40hotmail.com&quot;&gt;airly2002@hotmail.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;&gt=\r\n; \nwrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Talon:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Talon nodded and Followed =\r\nLord \nElder.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kup.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kup followed salv=\r\neo but he \nstill regrets to leave Roddy, windlord and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nightlight \nb=\r\nehind&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Kraftlos&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; \nSent: Monday, April 27, 2009 8:25 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwr=\r\npg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nSubject: Re:=\r\n The Crash Landing and \nAftermath&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus opened \nthe door to the lower level of the base, and wa=\r\nter&lt;BR&gt;&gt; poured into the room. \nHe motioned for everyone to follow.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;It looks like that ship we \nsaw crash landed in the ocean...&quot; =\r\nhe said&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mater of factly. &quot;Look at this \nplace.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Wha=\r\nt had once been their base was now a slab of concrete \nand metal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wi=\r\nth the ocasional structural support poking up from the \nfoundation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n The city, in just as bad of shape, was errily flat with a \nlarge number&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; of buildings simply washed away.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Looks \nlike we need=\r\n a new base.&quot; said Guardia steping quietly behind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lord \nPerseus, sl=\r\noshing water with each step.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;This base was build \nfrom an =\r\nold hanger, it wasnt intended to take&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that kind of punishment. \nWe =\r\ncould rebuild here, or we could find a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; better location.

Knowing that their only \nhope of survi=\r\nval was to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; safely crash land, the pilot picked an open \narea of=\r\n ocean and tried to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; approach at a safe angle to slow itself \nen=\r\nough to keep the ship intact.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus and his =\r\n\ncrew walked along the bridge that crossed the gap&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; between the =\r\npart \nof the island where the hangers were located and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; peni=\r\nnsula area \nwhere the base sat. Suddenly the sky became dark and a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; rumbling \nnoise could be heard, growing louder and louder. He looked up=\r\n to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; see \nalmost the whole sky occupied by a massive starship se=\r\nemly heading&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nstraight for the island. The Atlantis emergency a=\r\nlarm started to sound \nand&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; civilians rushed to their shelters.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&quot;Everyone! To the base! Hurry!&quot; ordered Perseus br=\r\neaking out into a \nrun.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The rumbling sound continue=\r\nd to get louder. As \nPerseus and his crew&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; reached&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe base door, it was \nquickly opened for them then shut behind them. He&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; ordered everyone \nto move the lower level of the base. As the ship=\r\n passed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; over the \nisland, the sound grew so loud that the groun=\r\nd shook and weaker&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nparts of buildings started to crumble, as i=\r\nn an earthquake. The ship&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \ntraveled for another three miles bef=\r\nore it touched down in the deep \nocean&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; waters. The force of the=\r\n impact sent the ship hundreds of feet \nbelow the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; surface and i=\r\nt continued to sink until coming to rest on \nthe top of an&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; unde=\r\nrwater mountain. The mass of water displaced by \nthe ship started a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; massive tsunami-like wave, going out in all \ndirections.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&gt; The ground began to shake again and the \nlights flickered inside=\r\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Maximal&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nbase.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Sir, w=\r\nhat&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing \nthe last heavy door to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; underground section of the \nbase.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; The lights continued to flicker, then went \nout.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nAt that moment the ten-story-high wall of water \nstruck Atlantis from the&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&gt; east, picking up all the boats in the \nharbor and tossing them o=\r\nnto the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; land.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The parts of the \ndocks that were not=\r\n made of concrete were pushed up and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; destroyed. A \nmoment later=\r\n the water hit the buildings in the lower wharf&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; area and \nthey =\r\nimmediately collapsed under the intense weight of water.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nLikew=\r\nise the metal dome that made up the upper story of the Maximal \nbase&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; was&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately ripped from its foundations and \ncarried =\r\naway, along with&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; everything in the command center, the \narmory,=\r\n mess hall, and the main bank&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; of CR chambers were also picked \n=\r\nup and carried away.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The lower floor of the base ha=\r\nd a \nlarge metal slab to protect it from&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; bombing, and as the wa=\r\nter \ncontinued to pour over it, everything on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; upper&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; \nfloors was ripped away, leaving a clean plate of metal sitting at \nth=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; bottom&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; of the crater that was the base. The \nbuil=\r\ndings along the center of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; town&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; were a little \ns=\r\nturdier and remained standing, though heavily damaged. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; hang=\r\ner \nand all the craft in it were picked up and thrown into the \nocean.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; As the water came to tower it filled up the deep \ntrenc=\r\nh around the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; structure&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; then the wall hit it, \nwrapp=\r\ning it entirely except for the top five&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; stories,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nd=\r\namaging supports, breaking out all the windows and destroying the \nbridges&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; that allowed access to the tower. The wave then continued \nacro=\r\nss the rest&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; of the island, destroying buildings and carrying \na=\r\nway the mass of debris,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and then all was eerily \nquiet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End g=\r\nroup email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0083_01C9E119.5D1F1580--\r\n\n"}}
