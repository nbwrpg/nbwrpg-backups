Anyway, here&#39;s my \n&gt; first new char. He could cause major problems for this RPG. And as \n&gt; for Alloran taking Vulois and Starscream, it&#39;s fine. But since \nVulois \n&gt; was my first char, I would like to stay close to his story line. \n&gt; Alloran, check your e-mail. And Dachande, thank you very much for \n&gt; giving me control of your RPG. Soulstice told me. Now, everyone \nwho&#39;s \n&gt; apart of it, go read the message board. In a few minutes there&#39;s \n&gt; gonna be a message because we&#39;ll be changing the head story a bit. \nAd \n&gt; in the process we&#39;ll be ending all controversy about the link \nbetween \n&gt; the RPG&#39;s. But I won&#39;t tell you how. That&#39;s members only. Well, \nhere \n&gt; I go. I may be rusty, so bare with me. This is the first two of my \n&gt; chars. I&#39;ll be introducing a new one every day.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Lincox/ S.B 92Delta\n&gt; \n&gt; Lincox sat on his ship, about to leave Cybertron. He couldn&#39;t \nbelieve \n&gt; the orders he was given when the Maximal council talked to him. He \n&gt; thought he was dead!\n&gt; \n&gt; *Begin Flashback*\n&gt; \n&gt; Lincox, who has just been conviceted of stealing weapons, is \nbrought \n&gt; before the Maximal council.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lincox, normally we would put you away for life for what you did. \n&gt; But...we think you can redeem yourself. We have a special mission \nfor \n&gt; you. Of course, you&#39;ve heard of the Neo Beast Wars. We&#39;ll, we&#39;ve \ngot \n&gt; a problem. Here on Cybertron, all the fanctions have an eerie but \n&gt; unstable peace. On Past Earth though, it&#39;s a full out massacre. \nThey \n&gt; have forgotten their mission to collect Energon. The Preds and us \n&gt; wish to send down a peaceful mining team, with no weapons of any \n&gt; kind. But if we sent it while the war is going, everyone would be \n&gt; attacking it for the peace it represents. And you can&#39;t just stop a \n&gt; war. So we&#39;ve made a ship, with the most powerful teleporter ever, \nso \n&gt; powerful that it can teleport across time. We want you to take this \n&gt; ship, and go to Earth, and teleport everyone on the planet, to \n&gt; present day Mars. Of course, the humans have tereformed it so that \n&gt; animals can and are living on it, but no humans have volunteered to \n&gt; go live there yet. In 90 of their days they will be forcing people \n&gt; on. We want all the bots on it in 60. Also, don&#39;t just sit around \nfor \n&gt; the 60. You have a lot to do. The Ark is in the wrong place. The \n&gt; Autobots and Decepticons are missiong. Bases that have never been \n&gt; discovered on Earth are there. Destroy them. Move the Ark. Find our \n&gt; ancestors. The mining team could do it, but that would delay the \n&gt; mining for two months. We will be sending Surveillance Bot 92Delta \n&gt; with you, so you don;t get up to any illegal things. In 60 from \nwhen \n&gt; you hit Earth, the teleporter will automatically send all bots \n&gt; outside of the ship to Present Mars. Make sure you are in the ship \n&gt; when it happens. That is all. You must leave immediatly. You have 5 \n&gt; mega-cycles. Get to it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *End Flashback*\n&gt; \n&gt; Lincox reved the engines and looked at S.B 92Delta\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ready to go?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Affirmitive. All Systems are ready for take off.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Than let&#39;s hit the skies!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lincox hits Maximum speed, and takes off for Past Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I know awhile back we had a disscusion about the use of \n&gt; transporters, so If I&#39;m breaking a rule here tell me, cause I can \n&gt; change it.)\n\n\n"}}
