She had never known any\n&gt; bot to enjoy pain like these two did. She sighed and thought about\n&gt; how to curb their appitite for pain.  She looked towards the\n&gt; lab. &quot;Stay there and don&#39;t go anywhere,&quot; she said to Land Mine and\n&gt; Time Bomb.  She went to the lab and looked around.  She found an old\n&gt; torture box. She smiled, &quot;This aught to do it. The old Pain Box.&quot;  It\n&gt; was a box big enough to put a bot in.  It had electrodes that\n&gt; protruded inward n the box. When turned on it would shock the heck\n&gt; out of who ever was inside the box.  wouldn&#39;t kill them but it might\n&gt; satisfiy them so thy wouldn&#39;t go out and get into trouble.  She\n&gt; carried it out and gave it to Time Bomb. &quot;Here, go plug this in in\n&gt; your room and have fun.&quot;  Fun wasn&#39;t what she would call it, but it\n&gt; might keep them happy for a while.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Time Bomb ran off and told Land Mine. Soon they were both scrubbing\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; walls...and the floors...and the ceilings...and the whole base!\n&gt; Lets just\n&gt; &gt; say, that probably days later, they came back bleeding all over\n&gt; again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Brushed too much.&quot; Time Bomb said...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
