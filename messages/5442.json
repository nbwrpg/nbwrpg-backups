His body systems were screaming at him,\nfighting\n&gt; his wanting to join her or keep watch, what he should be doing. She was a\n&gt; pretty sight, but he hid his face. He put his chin on the ground and\nwrapped\n&gt; his arms around his head. He laid on his belly, his legs straight out,\n&gt; finding that the grass was cool, a nice place to relax when you where\n&gt; feeling bad. He had ways of testing things out to get things just right\nfor\n&gt; his own desires.\n&gt;\n&gt; He tried to dim his optics to ease his head.
