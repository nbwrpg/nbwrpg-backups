We in Quebec might start to get\nfed up with those, but it is a necessary thing...\n\nHere&#39;s how I&#39;ll proceed.\n\nThere&#39;s one spot open unless Roborick wants to step down, in which\ncase there will be two. Starting on saturday, I will take the names of\nall who are suggested. Do not suggest someone on an in-game post, but\nrather in a specific post, such as Suggested Candidate or Election.\nThe suggestion period will last one week, from july 5th to july 12th.\n\nThe election itself will begin on july 13th (assuming my schedule\nallows me to) and will last one week too.\n\nThe next council will be formed of three members. The rpg is small\nenough for three persons to handle correctly. However, I&#39;m open to any\nother suggestion, provided there&#39;s a suitable argument for it.\n\nNow sorry for taking your time and create new chars so the Tripreds\ncan wipe the Preds out! =P\n\n\n"}}
