After a few minutes, Feline \nshowed Squizzy just which new beast mode she wanted.  Squizzy then \nput Feline into a CR tank and started to download the programs and \ninserted the correct DNA into the regeneration fluid.  It would take \na few hours, but when she was finished, Feline would be a new bot. In \nthe mean time, Squizzy to the DNA samples and started to anylize, \ncatagorize and sort them all out.  \n\n\n"}}
