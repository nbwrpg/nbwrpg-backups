Her arm trembled as she listened to \nscreams of pain, missile blasts and fireball hisses. She would cry if \nshe could, but bots didn&#39;t have tear ducts.\n\nHow could she live with this war? She couldn&#39;t! She wasn&#39;t designed \nfor war, and she hated it! Bots did this to each other all the time? \nNo..\n\nShe gasped in horror, and dropped her weapon, taking a step back. She \nwas doomed to live with this all her life?\n\nNot if she could help it, she wasn&#39;t going to live like this. Teltoli \nput on her cloaking, and flew up into the air, undetected and unseen. \nShe gave WindLord one last look, closed her eyes briefly, and flew \naway. Flew away from the battle, the pain, and the Maximals.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry..&quot; She whispered, her back turned from the slaughter.\n\n\n"}}
