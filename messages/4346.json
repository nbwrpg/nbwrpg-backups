It wasn&#39;t too far away from the cave. He \nlooked around, taking a careful watch of the ambient, making sure there were \nno Maximals around.

He coughed, thinking the dust had got into \nhis respritory systems. He was a mess, dusty, and just had to get some fresh \nair.\n\nTo the Inferno with it; he dived in.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
