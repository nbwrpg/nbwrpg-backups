The see there pursuers, but dont \nreally give \n&gt; a fuck anymore. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast, slumping Mosquitor down in a corridor, goes into \nhis private \n&gt; CR tank, while the others go in crew tanks. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia smiled as she waded deeper into the muck of the \nswamp. She \n&gt; could easily see that there was a stasis pod sticking clear up \nthrough it. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: Thanks to you....fembots will rule Cybertron!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: She floats the pod to the sore and drags it behinde her. \nThankfully, this \n&gt; neck of the swamp was just a mile away from the Predacon base, \nwhich was in \n&gt; full view. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia, activating the ramp to one of the cargo holds, \ndrags the \n&gt; stasis pod into the dark room, and closes the ramp. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Demona, her hand resting on her baster approaches. ::: About \ntime.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: Shut up! It was hard enough to get this thing \nhere. \n&gt; Now, get ready to transfer the phetus data.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Demona inserts a wire from her temple into the main computer to \nthe pod. \n&gt; Black Aracnia pours over the data and then the transfer begins. A \nblue bar \n&gt; appears on the monitor, and it slowly fills with the transfer. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Demona ::: This hurts.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: Your memory banks are being stressed, its \nsupposed to \n&gt; hurt.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: After a slow hour, the bar fills, the wire is detached, and \nthey both \n&gt; stand to see what comes out. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: Scince your a T-rex, and hell Beast is a \nreptile...I \n&gt; wonder what its form will be...\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Demona ::: Is it to late to program it to be a Raptor?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: No....is that what you want?\n&gt; \n&gt; :: Demona ::: Yes. Yes it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia makes the changes and the lid pops open. Stryfe \nclimbs out. \n&gt; His jade eyes search the room and lock on Demona. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Stryfe ::: Excellent. The data transfer was a success.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Demona ::: Now all you have to do is kill Hell Beast and take \nthe title!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Strye was tall, strong, warrior like. His visable wepons \nincluded a sub \n&gt; machine, optic lasers, and seeker missles. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Stryfe ::: Lets go meet dad.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Marine lay streached on the table of Ominous Prime. Rescued \nfrom the tar \n&gt; pits, he was vastly damaged and almost unrepairable. Now, he \nimplated the \n&gt; final data chip in his banks. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Marine&#39;s eyes lit up just as a flash of lighting broke the cold \nwinters \n&gt; night. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Marine ::: The fembot, she shot me!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Ominous ::: Fembot? Dosent matter now. Your repaired.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Marine ::: Your an enemy to the Commander!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Ominous ::: Oh yes. This war has brought out the worst in us. I \nsaw you \n&gt; in distress and chose to help you. Is there anything wrong with \nthat?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Marine shook it off, got up, and looked around the freakish \nlair of the \n&gt; scientist. What caught his eye was the vat of liquid energon that \nthe bot \n&gt; thrived on. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Ominous ::: Now, your to weak to leave here now. Its the dead \nof winter \n&gt; and this is the Artic. Its 85&#39; below zero outside. Your mech would \nfreeze. \n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Marine ::: Then...your helping me?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Ominous ::: Yes. Im sick of this pathetic war. When your \nrecovered I will \n&gt; take you to Hell Beast and we will leave the planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Marine ::: Leave?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Ominous ::: He has enough enegon, and his mission is complete. \nWe would \n&gt; benefit from it. \n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Marine nodded. He longed for Cybertron, and the wa was getting \nout of \n&gt; hand. Departure seemed the only way. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Megatron returned and climbed into a CR Tank. When he emerged \nhe turned \n&gt; to Kitkat for a full report. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Megatron ::: Kitkat, Report!\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; That whole ark being saved is the biggest Bullshit I have ever seen \nin this \n&gt; RPG.\n\n\n"}}
