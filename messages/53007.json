Our ship is a distinctive one and has been \nconnected officially with dozens of terrorist acts, including the \ndestruction of some important Tripredacus outposts.&quot;\n\nDevilcat considers for a moment.  Activating his comlink, he issues a \ncommand to the Rogues: &quot;Everyone meet me in the command center - \nstat!  We&#39;ve got business to discuss.&quot;  He heads out of the room, \nbeckoning Yggdrasil and Jayde to follow him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yggdrasil came up near Devilcat and looked at the data displayed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: That is a new ship design. Seems like a warship to me, \nand\n&gt; since it&#39;s new, they might well have lots more where they come from.\n&gt; That means they&#39;re not alone. As for personel, I can&#39;t say much. \nNever\n&gt; fought Tripreds. But they might be elite, or they might be green\n&gt; rookies that have been placed there to man the ship. However, \nrookies\n&gt; could not have landed the ship as successfully as they just did. \nThere\n&gt; is something else. The survivors of the first group probably had \ntime\n&gt; to observe things here and I am convinced that they have gathered \nsome\n&gt; intelligence on most people here. The newcomers now have that edge. \nA\n&gt; frontal assault is totally out of question.\n\n\n"}}
