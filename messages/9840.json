He attempted to jump up into the vent, but he was too \nshort to reach it. He tried two more times, but with no avail.\n\n&quot;Beast mode.&quot; Quickstrike transformed to beast mode and climbed up the wall, \ninto the air shaft. He crawled around inside it, and called, &quot;Dark Mouse. \nDark Mouse? Where are ya rodent?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nMegatron:\n\n&quot;Ah, a good logical bot.&quot; he said. He stood up. &quot;I belive it&#39;s time for us \nto return their glory. It doesn&#39;t make sense for fellow Predacons to fight \namoung themselves while we can put out energies into fighting the Maximals \nand even the Alliance. A Predacon uses team work. What you need is an \nexperienced leader like myself.&quot;\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
