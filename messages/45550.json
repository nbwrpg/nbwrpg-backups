From the sounds of it, it was likely an accident. I would \nlike to speak to .. Anachronox before deciding whether or not we can \nbring him back.&quot; Pacifix says in a resigned voice. &quot;I&#39;ll be heading \nover soon.&quot;\n\n----------------------------\n\nCrossroads nods, &quot;Sure.&quot; He exits the room, &quot;Follow me.&quot; He heads to \nthe control room.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Belthassan is surprised that Anachronox actually knows this is a \nship \n&gt; and that he knows the location of the storage bay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan: Yes the storage bays are that way. The Shadow Destiny \nhas \n&gt; been built by Gesper, my younger brother. It is a techno-organic, \nwith \n&gt; a format similar to yours and mine. All of us, Tripredacus, are \n&gt; techno-organics. We have been sent on Earth for a harvesting \nmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; He heads to the storage bay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan: I will introduce you first to the other members of the \n&gt; team before I present Daemos. He is our commander.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Daemos: Oh, we did find Firedrill. However, he is not the same \nperson \n&gt; anymore. Something we did not anticipate happened in the Renewal \n&gt; Chamber. Usually, it heals techno-organics. What I believe happened \nis \n&gt; that the Chamber reformatted him to fit the healing process. He now \n&gt; calls himself Anachronox and has pledged alligence to my group. I \ndid \n&gt; not wish this to happen. I am sorry about what happened, and I hope \n&gt; you can find some forgiveness in you. If we find any solutions, we \n&gt; will talk with you about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Gesper: Sure thing Crotale. I&#39;d like to talk with Pacifix now.\n\n\n"}}
