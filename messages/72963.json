There were tons of earth and stone between\nthe group and anyway back to the surface from their vantage point.\n\nNow the only way to go was foward. Foward towards the flickering light\nthat lay ahead and what ever lay beyond it.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson steps aside to allow the escaping parties a clear passage to safety .\n&gt;  He remains firm in his stance.  Evil was coming toward him and this time he\n&gt; was dead set on facing it head on himself.  It was what the old dragon would\n&gt; have done to protect those under his powerful wings, and so the need to\n&gt; protect his comrades and the predicons who had agreed to put their\n&gt; differences aside to join his faction against a greater evil than\n&gt; themselves, had grown stronger to the point where he felt it was all or\n&gt; nothing to save everyone&#39;s lives.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; EVERYONE, GET OUT OF HERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN!  I&#39;LL TAKE CARE\n&gt; OF THIS FROM HERE ON! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He narrows his eyes in stern vigil.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Your lives are too valuable to lose, and I for one will not stand for such\n&gt; a loss.  It&#39;s time, time to reclaim what has been unlawfully stolen!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His eyes glow a bright blue, lining the cave slightly with a hint of blue\n&gt; light.  Intern what little light is cast from his eyes bounces off of his\n&gt; silver armor shimmering like small flashes of lightning that peer through\n&gt; thick storm clouds .  Intern he gives a warning roar as loud as a clap of\n&gt; thunder, hoping that he&#39;s heard and perceived as a suggestion of surrender.\n&gt;\n&gt; There would be no more bowing down to Magmatron, or his minions.  No more\n&gt; kidnapping or corrupting anyone against their will.  And if they still defy\n&gt; him, which he senses they will, the Silver Dragon was ready to remind them\n&gt; that in order to get to the innocent, they would have to get past him first.\n&gt;  Even if this would cost him his own spark, Tucson was ready to embrace his\n&gt; inner spirit.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The time for introspetion and meta-awareness and contemplation had ended now\n&gt; as the tunnel collapse raced after the PREDAONS and MAXIMALS in full force\n&gt; as they tried to trample and run over one naother!\n&gt;\n&gt; The PREDACONS, at least some of them, seemed to not care WHERE Tehy were\n&gt; going, or that they were being HERDED, moreso that they just avoided going\n&gt; down over like WASPINATOR!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Which way do you &#39;pect us to be goin?&quot; QUICKSTRIKE, one of the\nPREDACON FUZORS said. &quot;There&#39;s only one way to go, and it&#39;s that a\nway.&quot;\n\nCRYOTEK held up a silencing finger, his quick glance hopefully\nquieting the other PREDACONS down.\n\nTurning back to TUSCON as he finished speaking CRYOTEK nodded. &quot;Of\ncourse Mighty Maximal.&quot; He said in a deeply respectful voice. &quot;I will\nlet you stand and face them in any way you wish.&quot;\n\nWith a small gesture he silently commanded the PREDACONS to comply,\nafter all, why should they waste their fire power and energon and risk\ntheir sparks when TUSCON was so clearly so ready to waste his?\n\n&quot;No!&quot; LEO PRIME said as he came to stand next to TUSCON, along with\nSANTON, WINGCALIBER as well as TORCA and his FUZORS.\n\nLEO PRIME gestured dismissively to CRYOTEK and then turned back to\nTUSCON, &quot;We will not let you stand alone. We stand or we fall, but we\ngo foward together.&quot;\n\nThen there is a voice, one deep and powerful echoed through the cave,\n&quot;Ahh, it is good to see that you have found your backbones after all\nMaximals!&quot;\n\n&quot;That is Saberback!&quot; SKYSHADOW said. The other PREDACON FUZORS nodded.\nThey had been there when HYDRAS had challeneged him.\n\nThe voice chuckled, &quot;You remembered me? I feel honored. I remeber you\ncowering before my power once before, and you shall do so again. Come\nfoward and come to your doom!&quot;\n\nThe laughter echoes down the through the cave, although there is no\nsign of SABERBACK himself. Only the flickering light comming from the\nend of the tunnel.\n\nThen there was a scream, one that nearly anyone and everyone could\nrecognize, a voice giving vent to rage and pure agony!!!!\n\nIt was OPTIMUS PRIME!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
