It was intel he\n&gt; needed to know.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; All right, that means there has to be a main control panel somewhere in\n&gt; the area that controls the energy fields on the bars, and a sub unit that\n&gt; supplies the power to each individual cell.  Hmm, I don&#39;t know that for sure\n&gt; about these cells but, it could be the way this area is set up. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gets back into beast mode and raises his body, standing on his hind legs.\n&gt;  With the use of his long neck, he tries to get a better look around.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Unfortunately, this is as high as I can reach, and I can&#39;t see anything\n&gt; that resembles energy pipelines. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gets back on all fours.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll need someone to stand on my head to see if any of you might be able\n&gt; to spot anything.   Mach Kick, Break, with the two of you on my head we can\n&gt; definitely get a better look at what the ceiling is like and see if any\n&gt; pipes run across the cells.  It&#39;s all right, I&#39;m strong enough to support\n&gt; you both.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He lowers his head down to them and waits for them to get on.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a slight chortle from MACH KICK as he leaped on board. While\nTUSCON is larger than MACH KICK, the disparity was not so large that\nhe could literally ride on his head, but he could get on his back\nwithout too much trouble.\n\n(OOC: Don&#39;t forget Tuscon is only about 10&#39; tall/long or so, not\ncounting tail, Mach Kick is about 6 or 7. Beastmodes do not size\nchange)\n\nBIG CONVOY just stares at the ceiling. Anyone who follows his stare\ncan see some reinforced buttressing that goes along the top. &quot;If you\nwere the jailers, where would you hide your electrical conduit?&quot; He\nsaid quietly, as he directed his chin towards the cieling which was\napproximately 20 feet in the air. &quot;Behind as much armor as you could\nput in place.&quot;\n\nThere was a low whisper from BREAK, &quot;Yeah, it won&#39;t be easy to get at\nit, especially with the guards looking.&quot;\n\nBREAK was of course talking about the trio of sharkticon looking\ngaurds still standing there watching with keen interest MACH KICK\nriding on TUSCON&#39;s back from the other side of the energized bars. So\nfar they made no effort to do anything about it their antics yet.\n\n&quot;That is some strange training you have!&quot; They said as one of them\nfolded his arms over his chest. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to help in\nthe games. &quot;\n\nOne of the other guards chuckled, &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t remember a jousting\ntournement.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
