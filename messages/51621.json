As has been stated several times \n&gt; already, there are TWO groups of artifacts.  The cubes found aboard \n&gt; the Pred ship - and subsequently scattered to several places, \n&gt; including Tripred HQ - were parts of a drive core belonging to a \nrace \n&gt; at war with the Vok.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Soul Orbs were here since Primus-knows-when, and belong to the \nVok \n&gt; themselves.  (Attention, Meteara!)  Empath&#39;s discovery of one has \n&gt; activated the other two on-planet, and potentially attracted more \nfrom \n&gt; the depths of space.  Each Orb contains the souls of up to a \nthousand \n&gt; Vok, hence the name.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it&#39;s still not clicking, maybe we need a new mod.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Huh...
