Not the \nlate\nmind you,but still a 300 year technological quantum leap ahead of us.\n They walk inside and examine it.\nMustex:The good news is this ship could fly the 3 of us to Cybertron \nfor\nMaximal reinforcements. The bad news is the powercells are shot. The \nbonus\ngood news is that with this technology we can tap tousands of energy \nsources\non this planet. The bonus bad news is that the only one that will \nsuffice in\nless than 500 years is to drain it from animals,proto-humans,and \nother bots\nand that&#39;s just cruel.\nStallex:If we want to be the best we have to make sacrifices.\nMustex:True.\n Mustex begins partially charging the ship woth some of his own \nenergy.\nStallex:Just be careful not to drain to much.\nMustex:Just enough to pick up our wrecked hover-cycles(OHHH!),and \nmaybe get a\nlttle more power out of them.\n\n\n"}}
