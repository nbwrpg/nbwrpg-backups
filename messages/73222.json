Yet, he makes no moves to attack them.  The =\r\naverage panther would have lunged and swiped at the Humans, yet he does not=\r\nhing of the sort.  He senses something different about these Humans.  They =\r\ndid not seem to belong in the time period they were in.  They weren&#39;t Proto=\r\nhuman. Therefore, he didn&#39;t need to keep his cover. He converts to robot mo=\r\nde, looks to the dart and back at the Humans.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll hit you guys on t=\r\nak&#39;n this  out later, but seriously, I know you aren&#39;t from around here so =\r\nyou got some big time explaining ta do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He stands put, arms folded in=\r\nto his chest, and a sharp eye on the Human who shot him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And don&#39;t e=\r\nven think about nail&#39;n me with that thing again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Local artist w=\r\nho specializes in illustration, using traditional and digital media.  \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I also specialize in hand made crafts.

He does not let onto his true identity and continues\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to act like =\r\na true panther. He roars and crouches, and takes a few swipes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at his =\r\noncoming restraints.
