I&#39;m happy to see that all of you are showing the initiative \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; have faith in the unknown. This will only strengthen our bonds and our\n&gt; &gt; forces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He then turns his head toward the direction of Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I notice you&#39;re a tad quiet Rodimus, I understand if something is\n&gt; &gt; bothering\n&gt; &gt; you and I&#39;m here to listen if you need to get a few things off your \n&gt; &gt; mind.\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; realize that you have been through a lot, and most of it unpleasent. I\n&gt; &gt; assure you Hydras will not get away with what he did to you and neither\n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; the rest of his lackies.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A stone solid look of determination comes over Tucson&#39;s face. Like \n&gt; &gt; Optimus\n&gt; &gt; he was not one to shy away from working toward a resolve.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; And if I must, if given the challenge, I will face him if he so \n&gt; &gt; choses,\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; a one to one basis. He took something very valuable away from me, my\n&gt; &gt; comrades, and my friends. And now, it&#39;s time I took something away from\n&gt; &gt; him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus shook his head slighly as he turned to leave the room, his\n&gt; strides long and purposeful. &quot;There are so many things to deal with at\n&gt; once.&quot; He said as he walked, his face firm and resolute. &quot;At them\n&gt; moment we have our two objectives, locating and defeating Hydras as\n&gt; well as learning more information about the Insect creatures that we\n&gt; have just encountered.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus turned and looked at the others that had followed him out of\n&gt; the room. He gestured expansively with his his left hand as he\n&gt; continued to hold Elita in his right arm. They had all come to a stop\n&gt; in a large chamber, the bridge was just a litle ahead of them. Cheetor\n&gt; and Lord Elder also made thier way over to joim the group.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tuscon, since you are a Prime now and I am sure you are eager to\n&gt; revisit yourself on Hydras, whoch will leave me to focus on the\n&gt; insectoids.&quot; Rodimus smiled grimly as he tapped his head meaningfully.\n&gt; &quot;I believe that even though they have been able to learn much of us\n&gt; Maximals and Autobots from what was stored in my head, I believe that\n&gt; they left a few tid bits in my head as well.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
