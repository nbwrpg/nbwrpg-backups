He prepares for return fire, \nas his red optics finally find a lone Tripred, who could only be \ntheir leader.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nSwitchblade frowns, as he starts hacking the lock combo on a \nslightly larger storage container. His green optics flicker, giving \naway his irritation. \n\nSwitchblade redoubles his efforts, nearing a succesful unlock, &quot;Damn \nlocks are made better these days... but still not good enough for \nme.&quot; He makes short work of the last part of the protection, and \nwith a victorious evil grin opens the lid.\n\nHis grin is short lived, as a violent explosion is triggered by his \nopening the case. Switchblade is thrown backwards, and he smashes \ninto another containder, scratching it&#39;s hard covering slightly.\n\n&quot;Th...&quot; *bzzt* &quot;That...&quot; He struggles to get to his feet grumbling \nto himself, &quot;was unexpected. I never would have thought that a \nmaximal container would have such an archaeic trap... sometimes I \nthink too much. One mistake I won&#39;t make again...&quot;\n\nHe drags himself across the floor, his left arm hanging in tatters \nfrom his side, and significant damage to his upper and lower torso. \nHis head escaped relatively unscathed, likely due to left arm, which \ntook the brunt of the explosion. Being such a feather weight bot, he \nwas easily tossed by the explosion.\n\nHe looks into the mysterious box.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nooC:\n\nAs for the artifacts storyline idea, I&#39;m guessing that people don&#39;t \nmind that much. Therefore, I&#39;ll go ahead with it, but I&#39;m not sure \nwhat the effect of the of the artifacts will be, so i&#39;m going to \nencourage that people email me with ideas. =) I&#39;ll choose the best \none, or a combination of effects. Since this is a storyline thing, \nIt does sorta affect everyone. =)\n\nKyle, in reply to this post which is copy/pasted at the bottom of \nthis email:\n\nOk, that&#39;s fine with me. =)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Since we&#39;re finally getting into the artifacts,\n&gt; and rAuq has yet to answer my e-mail concerning them\n&gt; I&#39;ll bring this up right here.  I say the documents\n&gt; stolen from Snowowl the day of her murder were all the\n&gt; Maximal research concerning the artifacts, and\n&gt; Megatron ordered the assasination.  So rAuq do you\n&gt; have a problem with that? \n\n\n"}}
