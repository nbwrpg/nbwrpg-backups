Pain! Lights! Pain! Darkness!

The heat was barely tolerable and almost \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; unbearable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He looked down at his hands and shuddered as he saw=\r\n only the blackness of \n&gt; &gt; Dark Rodimus, it took him a full moment that hi=\r\ns armor was black, not \n&gt; &gt; because of evil, but because it was so badly sc=\r\norched and burnt that all \n&gt; &gt; the other colors had been lost.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He s=\r\nmiled for a moment, feeling a curious sense of freedom. He felt free \n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nf the darkness that had overwhelmed him, the fear and guilt he had lived \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; with for so many months. He felt new and alive! He felt a sense of \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ngiddiness as he flexed his fingers and he began to laugh  . . .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Two=\r\n luminous eyes appeared out of the darkness and blinked, &quot;Yesss, you \n&gt; &gt; l=\r\nie still now.&quot; a voice hissed from nearby. &quot;We will get you back to the \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; machine, yess we will.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; laughter was cut short as he rea=\r\nlized that he was being carried \n&gt; &gt; by something, something large and miss=\r\nhapen, yet it moved amazingly quick!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was then that Rodimus heard=\r\n a strange piercing scream from somewhere in \n&gt; &gt; the darkness. It took him=\r\n a moment to realize that it was he that was the \n&gt; &gt; one screaming as he s=\r\naw and felt large all around him!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He felt a sting on his shoulder, =\r\nand for a second he was surprised that he \n&gt; &gt; could feel such a tiny sensa=\r\ntion and then his world went dark.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG or TBC)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
