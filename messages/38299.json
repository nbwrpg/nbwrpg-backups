Perhaps these two Maximals(Hugar \n&gt;and\n&gt;AzureBlade) would be good to have on HIS team.......But he had to get to\n&gt;know all of the Maximals first before actually enslaving one.....\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &quot;Beast Wars AKA Proto&quot; &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Monday, June 25, 2001 6:14 PM\n&gt;Subject: Hugar\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; �Hugar�\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Hugar waited for some maximals to allow him in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
