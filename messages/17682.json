He spins around, firing back at Bullet, not sure \nwhere to aim.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen runs toward Prebon, the forest sizzling around him. He was \nholding his rifle in one end, firing at Prebon, and the anti-chip weapon in \nthe other, firing on Spears.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSlayer growls as he looks up at the weaponfire above him. It was not his \nconcern, his concern was Ramulus..\n\nThe bot&#39;s jetpack activates, sending him flying toward Ramulus&#39; location, \nfiring a shot toward the forest as he flew.\n\n"}}
