One very large Autobot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had already smashed his desk, and was standing at his full height,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very upset. Ironhide knew he was in for trouble, &quot;Is there a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem Grimlock?&quot; He asked, knowing there is. &quot;YES THERE PROBLEM&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Grimlock yelled, his voice echoing very clearly throughout all of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iocon. &quot;THIS BULLSHIT. YOU SEND ROOKIES TO FIGHT IN WAR THAT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; AFFECT WHOLE GALAXY, EVEN WHOLE TIME. YOU SEND A PACIFIST!!&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; declared in rage, as he pointed a finger at Pacifix. He pulled out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his energon sword, and in one swipe, cleaved his whole rows podium\n&gt; &gt; &gt; straight in half. Grimlock stopped and looked up at the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; council, his sword at his side, energy shimmering off it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ironhide sighed, how did he get a weapon in this room. This wasnt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the first time this happened. &quot;Grimlock, you know that if one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; us goes the Predacons will be on to us,&quot; He said calmly. &quot;None of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; us can go&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Grimlock looked back up, then crossed his arms, his sword just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; above his head, still shimmering, the energy intesifing the look\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of rage in his crimson eyes. &quot;Then I go to earth to&quot; he said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quietly, and he was almost not heard with the large amount of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gasps that escaped around the room.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
