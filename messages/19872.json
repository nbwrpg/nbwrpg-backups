No wonder there was a war going on, \nwith being like this one terrorizing the planet.\n\nBut even as DeathScythe advenced on her she backed further into the cave, \nmomenterraly tripping on a small rock but regaining her balence and \ncontinuing on into the shadows.\nHer mind kept wreeling. Why was he like this, even after she had saved his \nlife? Didn&#39;t that count for anything?!\nBut she kept calm, other then backing up and hearing her spark pound in her \nears.*\n\n&quot; It has kept me alive so far, has it not?&quot;\n\n* But she knew that talking to this bot was useless, just like it was to \nthink that he could have at least let her go as thanx for saving his \nmiserable life.\nHowever, as her form bacxked even further into the cave her foot slipped in \na small puddle, DeathScythe shoting 2 charges at her at the same time.\nSo, she not only fell back, but flew a few feet further into the cave as \nwell. Hitting the far wall hard and with a sickening crack.\n\nZyber whimpered silently as she slowly rise from a sprawl to a sit, looking \ndown at her chest and shoulder to see mech-fluid leaking from them.\nBut she slowly stood, her optics fixed on DeathScythe but also inching along \nthe wall to get towards the passage which led deeper into the caverns.*\n\n&quot; It is not skills which make beings strong, it is their willingness and \npure of spark which gives them their strength.\nThe weak are only those which chose to hide their purity until a certain \ntime in their life where they can release it and rise above the reast. As it \nalways has been and still is.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
