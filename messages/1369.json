For several moments, he just stood there, holding his \nrifle at Striker, not even firing.\n\nAfter, he sighed. He slumped his broad shoulders and crouched down beside \nStriker. &quot;I could use information from you, first. He put his rifle over his \nshoulder and leaned into Striker.\n\n&quot;computer,&quot; he commanded. &quot;Prepare for Spark energy transfere.&quot; His internal \ncomputer replied with a soft beep. He hovered his furry chest over \nStriker&#39;s. His chest slowly opened up, and his spark pulsed calmly inside \nit, with the light blue glow.
