He shuddered, shaking his head\n&gt; &gt; lightly and flickering his red eyes after she called him cutey. It felt\n&gt; &gt; weird, but he didn&#39;t respond to it strongly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He transformed to his robot mode and walked to the outside of the cave. \n&gt;He\n&gt; &gt; leaned against the side of the rock formation. He crossed his arms, and\n&gt; &gt; stared out. So this was their base? He really didn&#39;t like this \n&gt;situation.\n&gt;He\n&gt; &gt; was going to be on edge too much, maybe that was why he was being so \n&gt;surly\n&gt; &gt; to the females. He really didn&#39;t like yelling at them. They were nice\n&gt;bots.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He looked back. Their gang needed a flier.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He had a strike of an idea.

It was morning\n&gt; &gt; &gt;now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looked back at Stingtra. &quot;Ah want e&#39;veryone t&#39; say inside.
