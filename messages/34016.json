He knew the basic layout of the ship, so he had no trouble\ngetting to the CR chambers and getting Groove and Streetwise into two\nof them. He turns around and exits the Element, flying toward another\ngroup of Maximals.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler lands near the group of injured Maximals, but a stray laser\nblast sends him down to the ground. He jumps back up, looking around\nand spotting Headstrong fighting Firedrill. Assiming that Headstrong\nhad fired at him, he runs toward the Decepticon, discarding his\nmissile launcher (out of missiles), and taking out a pistol, firing\nfour shots at Headstrong&#39;s head.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster reaches the group of stasis-locked Maximals, taking Ratchet\nand Orion and jogging toward the Element.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther smiles, watching EndBringer attacking Double Punch. He then\ntakes aim and fires two charges at Injector, and puts away his charge\nlauncher, with was out of ammo.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm watches another tank begin to help him out (Forrior). He fires\ntwo missiles, both of them heading for Predator (not seeking, of\ncourse).\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica recieves Zardus&#39;s orders, and fires two missiles down at\nVehement, flying down toward the big bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise stands up, rubbing his head but then running at Injector\nwithout wasting any time.\n\n\n"}}
