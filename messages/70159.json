It wasn&#39;t Scourge that was scaring him, it was his overdosing of the gassy bean pods which was doing him in. He remains in robot mode as he seems to bloat a bit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap gasps.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Uhhhh, ohhh... This doesn&#39;t look too good and it ain&#39;t gonna smell too good in a fraction of a few nanoseconds!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Without further a do, Quickstride erupts with a cloud of unbearable stench, which wafts upward into the air.\n\n&quot;Is that all you got?!?&quot; Scourge sneered derisively. He easily flew\naround the ball of gas, it floating so very slowly in the air, being\ngently pushed by prevailing wind currents. However a bird that\nhappened to be flying through was not quite so fortunate. Due perhaps\nto a lack of agility, or more likely just a lack of awareness of true\ndanger it was in flew into the cloud of odor and it began to fall from\nskies.\n\nScourge in the meantime had taken the time to back around and was\ncomming for another run at the maximals when the alarms from the\nfortress began to go off.\n\n&quot;SLAG!&quot; Scourge grunted as he turned on his radio, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;\nhe said as he flew back toward the fortress.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
