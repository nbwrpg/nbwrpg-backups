Our (the council&#39;s) goal is to guard against moding, and that\n&gt; &gt;mostly happens with new weapons (that&#39;s why certain people are being\nbugged\n&gt; &gt;by us more than others). Mostly-storyline things (like reformatting\n&gt; &gt;Australia, which doesn&#39;t create a superweapon or anything, but creates an\n&gt; &gt;interesting area to RP in) are generally good.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., Airshadow Nightlight &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That Mean that I can do that?!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   rAuq &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote: Stop playing council member, LN...

Which I just looked at, and if it suddenly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;appeared&quot; there I would be very suspicious of it. Also note that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy from sparks doesnt act like normal energy. Since\nBlacknightmare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isnt a creation of the Bamphomet and the energy is specifically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created to be used solely by those he creates it would have a very\nbad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; negative effect on blacknightmare if she absorbed it and/or tried to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use it to improve anything.
