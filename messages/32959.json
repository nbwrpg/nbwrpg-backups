He used to be the old Unicron, but then he\n&gt;died and was rebuilt as a twelfe (I think) foot tall robot with\n&gt;psychic abilities. He&#39;s not superpowerful.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Johnny Brennan&quot; &lt;thejerkyboysare@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; [Now just one minute you. How can you have Unicron as a transformer,\n&gt;he is\n&gt; &gt; suppose to be enormous, and the nbwrpg group only allows\n&gt;transformers to be\n&gt; &gt; sixteen feet high at the maximum. Plus isn&#39;t Unicron a little close\n&gt;to super\n&gt; &gt; powerful, I&#39;m getting grilled for that, so why aren&#39;t you?]\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
