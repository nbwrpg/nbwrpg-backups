When we worked together=\r\n, I saw a part of him that I never thought I would see in a Predacon .  I c=\r\nan&#39;t explain what it is because even I&#39;m not so sure about it but it&#39;s defi=\r\nnitely not something bad.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She looks to Leo thoughtfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I kno=\r\nw that the Predacons are our natural enemies but, maybe some of them are ju=\r\nst misunderstood.  I think Waspinator is one of those who are even misunder=\r\nstood by their own comrades.  I never thought I would actually be speaking =\r\nup for a Predacon but, this time it&#39;s different.  Anyway, I better get goin=\r\ng and see if I can contact Waspinator.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She salutes as she saunters of=\r\nf to contact what could be her newest friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Waspinator, it&#39;s me, S=\r\ntraight Shot.  I need your help and I was wondering if you could meet me ha=\r\nlf way between the Ark and where you&#39;re stationed.  Also, I was wondering i=\r\nf you had time ta talk.  There&#39;s a few things I&#39;d like ta tell ya and I don=\r\n&#39;t want anyone ta hear me except for you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She sighs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t wor=\r\nry, it&#39;s nothing bad.  It&#39;s something I forgot ta tell ya before we went ou=\r\nr separate ways.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAt this point, as she went to click on the com=\r\nmunicator, there was a beep.\n\n&quot;Wazzzpinator here..  Wait..&quot;\n\nThe entire mes=\r\nsage being heard, and over at the other end Straight Shot would hear, &quot;What=\r\n is this, consorting with the enemy?  Tsk, Tsk, Tsk.  I thought you would k=\r\nnow better then.&quot;\n\nThen a pleading, &quot;Noo, Wazzpinator not, stupid little bo=\r\nw-girl..&quot;\n\nThen there was a loud SCREAM and a series of small explosions as=\r\n her communicator chirped off.\n\n&lt;Subject: Waspinator located inside auxilia=\r\nry Predacon Facilities, now in Stasis Lock.  Do you want to leave a message=\r\n?&gt;\n\nThe voice at the other end familiar, in a sense.  Not to her, but proba=\r\nbly more so to Rattrap.\n\n\n"}}
