Yesterday I \ngot Transformers the movie and after watching it 3 times I came to \nthe conclusion IT&#39;S AN INSULT TO EVERYTHING BM AND BW!  The Autos and \nDecepts were suppose to be smarter than there descendants, but \nMegatron had to use the Trgan Horse tactic that&#39;s been outdated for \n2,000 years on Earth and the Decepts should have radioed a need for \nrepairs and NOT stood close to the hole.  How dumb can they be.  Also \nthe Autos tried to get the Dinobots in the shuttle first even though \nthey were the strongest fighters and should have been last.  In fact \nI think they were the only ones doing in damage in the later fight \nagainst Unicron.  And why were they so happy at the end when they had \nused up the Matrix&#39;s energy and basically destroyed their own version \nof heaven?  I prefer BM standards where the Matrix is everywhere and \neternal.  And just to be annoying can I have Spike?\n\n\n"}}
