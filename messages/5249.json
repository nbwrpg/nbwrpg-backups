She wasn&#39;t sure if he hated her \njust because she was female, a mouse, or both.  She knew that per Megatron&#39;s \norders, she had to get a long with him, like it or not.\nShe went to a small energon dispenser.  Put two cubes on a tray and walked \nover to Terrorsaur.\n\n&quot;Here you are.&quot;  She didn&#39;t smile at all.  She really didn&#39;t like being that \nclose to a bot who could swallow her whole in one gulp.  It made her \nnervous, but she did her best to hide it.\n&quot;If there is anything else that you require, let me know.&quot;\nShe turned and walked back to her console.\n\n----------Original Message---\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Terrorsaur:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Terrorsaur descended to the ground, spreading his wings, he caught an air\n&gt;current, leading him into the Predacon cave. He landed, flexing his wings \n&gt;on\n&gt;his spectacular maneuvers. He looked around the interior. Not any were\n&gt;inside. The only one that he saw was the mouse. He gurgled a growl to her.\n&gt;He didn&#39;t like her exactly. He didn&#39;t like the sight of Scorponok and her \n&gt;together.\n&gt;\n&gt;He took two hops towards her.\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
