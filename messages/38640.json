He recieves the Daemos&#39;s message as he exits the ship, seeing Daemos emerge and introduce himself. He approaches, looking the bot over.\n\n&quot;Very impressive,&quot; he says, walking past Supernova and his team. &quot;I am Zardus. Welcome to my base.&quot;\n\nHe stops a few feet from Daemos, waiting for the reply, his mind already calculating what he could use this mercenary for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nicolas Marion&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Daemos received the welcome message from Zardus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Daemos:\n&gt; Thank you, Zardus. And thank you too, Supernova. I must tell you, though, \n&gt; that I will show myself in my beast mode.\n&gt; Hellgate, open lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Hellgate&#39;s doorlock opened and Daemos walked out. His body was that of a \n&gt; middle-sized red demon, but there was something else...\n&gt; His spikes, running all over his back to his cranium, were metallic, and his \n&gt; legs were covered with circuitry. The claws of his hands were \n&gt; disproportionned, seeming to be a lot larger than his body could support.\n&gt; \n&gt; Daemos:\n&gt; I am Daemos, first Tripredacus to be reformatted as a techno-organic \n&gt; transformer.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
