He frowns at the two and directs a \ncomment at them, while speaking to the rest of the Autobots, &quot;The \nkey to our succes lies in our ability to follow orders, and our \ncompassion for all. So, if we follow orders, and arrive at meetings \nwithout delay, then we have begun with a good start. Now for \norders. Artemis and JetV, I want you two to scout out our current \nlocation and report back to me. Hoist, I need you to get the ship&#39;s \ncomputers functioning fully. We need to know the status of the \nship as soon as possible. Technobots, I want you to start planning \na defensive perimetre to deter any enemy bots, or scouts. \nDinobots, your task is to guard the Technobots, and the ship. I \ndon&#39;t want any intruders to get in and cause any further damage to \nour already damaged ship. Everyone else, asses the damages and \nreport back to me when you&#39;ve made a detailed report. Oh, Crotale \nyou&#39;re with me, and you are the second in command. Also, \nGrimlock, you are in charge of battle planning and our militia \nforces. Crossroads will be accompanying you around, and he will \nbe your strategic advisor.&quot;\n\nCrossroads gulps at this and glances at the frightning dinosaur \ntowering above him, but he trusts in Pacifix&#39;s judgement.\n\nPacifix notices Grimlock&#39;s visage but ignores it, then he catches \nthe eye of Strafe and speaks to him, &quot;Strafe, you look like you&#39;ve \ngot something to say?&quot; He waits attentively.\n\n\nOn 17 Jul 2001, at 21:29, robertdahl wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Excellent Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Grimlock snarled and folded his arms, turning himself away.
