After saying they should go home, Teltoli let a \nsincere smile break loose, and she watched Carnage walk a few steps. \nThe Fuzor turned back to Instrat.\n\n&quot;I realize that last attack was for my sake, but you needn&#39;t think I \nneed protection from Carnage. We just had a few misunderstandings, \nbut we both sorted it out. Although I&#39;m.. thankful for your help \ntowards me, just.. you don&#39;t need to go around killing everything \nthat you think you should&quot; She softly, trying to be friendly. \n\nMaybe fighting wasn&#39;t the best tactic after all. Even though she did \nso hate the sounds of battle. &quot;I&#39;m sure you could make friends, in \nwhatever faction you are, if you decided to not be so.. savage&quot; She \nsmiled, hoping to be reassuring. \n\n&#39;Oh God, what am I doing? I&#39;m trying to be friendly with someone that \ntried to kill us not an hour ago?&#39; Teltoli thought. She took a few \nsteps back, waved goodbye to Instrat and hoped she heeded her words.\n\nWhen she reached Carnage, she stayed in her bot mode. Sometimes some \nheight was nice. She had a look of shock on her face.\n\n&quot;Did I really do that?&quot; She grimaced, and thought that maybe her \nmother&#39;s traits were coming through in her more strongly than ever \nnow.\n\n\n"}}
