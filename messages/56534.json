Flash, memory, fla=\r\nsh, memory...the process continued.  He couldn&#39;t see any of his physical su=\r\nrroundings, only the memories and flashbacks.  For all he knew, the flashba=\r\ncks might actually be where he was.  He could see two faces looming above h=\r\nim, staring down at him, but he couldn&#39;t make out any details, the faces we=\r\nre blurry.  He thought he could hear them talking, but to his hearing it wa=\r\ns unclear gabbing which he couldn&#39;t make out the meaning of.  And then that=\r\n&#39;s when it struck him that he was on his back.  He could sense that he wasn=\r\n&#39;t on the lowest ground, but was laid out on a bed-like object.  A sharp pa=\r\nin struck through his back and spread throughout his body like a disease.  =\r\nThe pain was a piercing chill, and it was clear to him that his &quot;bed&quot; was m=\r\nade from some sort of metal.  Where am I?  What&#39;s happening?  Is this real?=\r\n  These were only a few of the questions circulating in his mind like a rag=\r\ning tornado.  Vision was still blurry, and he didn&#39;t have much energy in hi=\r\nm.  However, he mustered the strength to extend his arm out in front of him=\r\n.  He held it there for a moment, staring at it, trying to focus on the cur=\r\nrent scene before him.  But it was all to no avail.  The vision was still f=\r\nogged, but he could make out one thing.  And it was the last he&#39;d ever see =\r\nof this place, for a while.  A second arm, not belonging to him, had grabbe=\r\nd his own arm.  A third arm came in, and it appeared to him that the hand o=\r\nn this arm was holding a long, thin object.  At that moment, that unidentif=\r\nied long, thin object was thrust into his arm, and he felt nothing.....unti=\r\nl he started to feel a large wave of vertigo overcome him, and the optical =\r\nfocus he had left was diminishing quickly.  Suddenly, everything he saw bec=\r\name red, as if he had infra-red vision.  His eyes were rapidly getting heav=\r\nier.  He could make out that the two faces above him were talking, and then=\r\n they were waving something in front of his face and saying something that =\r\nsounded to him like, &quot;THIS IS NOT A GAME.....THIS IS NOT GAME.....&quot;.  Howev=\r\ner, he couldn&#39;t be sure, because his hearing was not any better at this poi=\r\nnt, it was only getting worse as he lost awareness, and vision faded.  And =\r\nthe same statement was repeated, over and over again.  &quot;THIS IS NOT A GAME.=\r\n....THIS IS NOT A GAME.....THIS IS NOT A GAME.....&quot;.  Each time it was said=\r\n, the phrase seemed to get slower and slower, and then finally...he closed =\r\nhis eyes.  The redness, the object being waved, the faces....they were all =\r\ngone...and his mind became a blank, empty void.\r\n------=_NextPart_000_001C_01C31D93.35A35340\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2800.1126&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;It only took one flash for the next \nmemory to be there.&nbsp; Flash,=\r\n&nbsp;memory, flash, memory...the process \ncontinued.&nbsp; He couldn&#39;t see=\r\n any of his physical surroundings, only the \nmemories and flashbacks.&nbsp;=\r\n For all&nbsp;he knew, the flashbacks might \nactually be where he was.&nbsp=\r\n; He could see two faces looming above him, \nstaring down at him, but he co=\r\nuldn&#39;t make out any details, the faces were \nblurry.&nbsp; He thought he co=\r\nuld hear them talking, but to his hearing it was \nunclear gabbing which he =\r\ncouldn&#39;t make out the meaning of.&nbsp; And then that&#39;s \nwhen it struck him=\r\n that he was on his back.&nbsp; He could sense that he wasn&#39;t \non the lowes=\r\nt ground, but was laid&nbsp;out on a bed-like object.&nbsp; A sharp \npain s=\r\ntruck through his back and spread throughout his body like a \ndisease.&nbsp=\r\n; The pain was a piercing chill, and it was clear to him that his \n&quot;bed&quot; wa=\r\ns made from some sort of metal.&nbsp; Where am I?&nbsp; What&#39;s \nhappening?&=\r\nnbsp; Is this real?&nbsp; These were only a few of the questions \ncirculati=\r\nng in his mind&nbsp;like a raging tornado.&nbsp; Vision was still \nblurry, =\r\nand he didn&#39;t have much energy in him.&nbsp; However, he mustered the \nstre=\r\nngth to extend his arm out in front of him.&nbsp; He held it there for a \nm=\r\noment, staring at it, trying to focus on the current scene before him.&nbsp=\r\n; \nBut it was all to no avail.&nbsp; The vision was still fogged, but he co=\r\nuld make \nout one thing.&nbsp; And it was the last he&#39;d ever see of this pl=\r\nace, for a \nwhile.&nbsp; A second arm, not belonging to him, had grabbed hi=\r\ns own arm.&nbsp; \nA third arm came in, and it appeared&nbsp;to him that the=\r\n hand on this arm was \nholding a long, thin object.&nbsp; At that moment, t=\r\nhat unidentified long, thin \nobject was thrust into his&nbsp;arm, and he fe=\r\nlt nothing.....until he started to \nfeel a large wave of vertigo overcome h=\r\nim, and the optical focus he had left was \ndiminishing quickly.&nbsp; Sudde=\r\nnly, everything he saw became red, as if he had \ninfra-red vision.&nbsp; Hi=\r\ns eyes were rapidly getting heavier.&nbsp; He could \nmake out that the two =\r\nfaces above him were talking, and then they were waving \nsomething in front=\r\n of his face and saying something that sounded to him like, \n&quot;THIS IS NOT A=\r\n GAME.....THIS&nbsp;IS NOT GAME.....&quot;.&nbsp; However, he couldn&#39;t \nbe sure,=\r\n because his hearing was not any better at this point, it was only \ngetting=\r\n worse as he lost awareness, and vision faded.&nbsp; And the same \nstatemen=\r\nt was repeated, over and over again.&nbsp; &quot;THIS IS NOT A GAME.....THIS \nIS=\r\n NOT A GAME.....THIS IS NOT A GAME.....&quot;.&nbsp; Each time it was said, the =\r\n\nphrase seemed to get slower and slower, and then finally...he closed his \n=\r\neyes.&nbsp; The redness, the object being waved, the faces....they were all=\r\n \ngone...and&nbsp;his mind&nbsp;became a blank, empty \nvoid.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nBODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_001C_01C31D93.35A35340--\r\n\n"}}
