Nightshift&#39;s right. I shouldn&#39;t try to do this alone. And I know you wish to redeem yourself faithfully. Well, this is where we begin. I trust you&#39;ll be able to handle this with ease.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He alligns his missile launchers in anticipation of a shoot out.\n\nRodimus nodded as he checked his rifle, his photon eliminator, the\nweapon was still full of power and ready to go, as was the rest of his\nweaponry. He looked back up at Tuscon and nodded, &quot;Ready!&quot; he said\nwith a grim intensity.\n\n&gt; Kup attached himself the device and coneccted his traking devices to keep an\n&gt; eye in predacon signatures and looking to Nightlight and then to Rodimus, he\n&gt; said &quot;I&#39;ll care her with my life...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The old Autobot waited to Rodimus response, perhaps he would like to tell\n&gt; something else before take her with him.\n\nRodimus looked at Kup, &quot;Take her, protect her. I have trusted you with\nmy life in the past, and now I trust you with hers.&quot; Rodimus&#39;\nattention was ripped away from Kup by Darkhawk . . .\n\n&gt; &quot;YOU WONT GO TO ANY WHERE!!!!&quot;Said Darkhwak aiming his gun\n\n&quot;Yes they will!&quot; Rodimus said as he stepped slightly from his postion,\nhopefully drawing attention away from Kup and Nightlight to him.\nFlicking his weapon to full stunning power he fired at Darkhawk,\ntrying to stun him and take him out of action.\n\nEven as Rodimus acted, Cyclonus, Deepstryke, and Phobia stepped around\nthe corner weapons already drawn, backing up Scourge, Scorponok and\nDarkhawk. Thier presence making the count atleast six Predacon,\nDecepticons and Minions against four beleagered Maximals and Autobots\n- well only three if Kup actually leaves!\n\n&quot;No.&quot; Cyclonus intoned dangerously, his voice deep and commanding, &quot;they won&#39;t.&quot;\n\nWithout a thought Rodimus clicked his weapon over to combat mode and\nsent beams of searing electricity at Cyclonus and the others with him,\nforcing them to step back. &quot;GO!&quot; Rodimus barked at Kup, &quot;We will\nfollow when we can!&quot; He said without thinking.\n\nCyclonus and the others forces of Hydras began returning fire lighting\nup the hallway!\n\nRodimus spoke to Tuscon without turning away from the firefight, &quot;We\nmay want fall back, Hydras himself will be here soon!&quot; It was not fear\nin Rodimus voice, only the grim reality of battle and the stating of\noptions. It was clear by Rodimus&#39; actions that he was ready to lay\ndown his life in protection of the others.\n\n(TAG)\n\n\nMeanwhile . . .\n\nWho: LEGACY, Quickstride, Rat Trap\nLocation: Outside the Black fortress\n\nIn the distance, should either Rat Trap or Quickstride be looking in\nthe proper direction the large form of Legacy could be made out in the\ndistance. A small but growing black spec appearing on the horizon. He\nwas still in his military satalite mode, and that was becoming more\nand more evident as time passed as his shape slowly became more clear.\n\n&quot;Maximals and Autobots&quot; Legacy&#39;s familiar yet cold voice reached\nthrough the encrypted Autobot channels hopefully to catch Tuscon&#39;s\nattention, but at the very least Rat Trap and Quickstride, &quot;What is\nyour status? I shall be arriving in 187.55 astro seconds.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: Airly, if you want Talon and the shuttle to accompany that is\nfine. It is up to Kraftlos if he want&#39;s his characters aboard as well.\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
