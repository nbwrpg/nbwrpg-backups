The force of the blow knocks him backwards a step, and\n&gt; almost sets him off balance, and denting his heavy barricade mode\n&gt; armour. He steps back again, and levels his freeze cannons at\n&gt; Arty&#39;s shoulders in an attempt to stop the bot from moving his arms\n&gt; at the shoulder.

(I think grabbing range would be considered point blank the\n&gt; &gt; effects of the blow is entirely up to you.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Artemis was ready to fight and fired 25 times against Arty\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Arty suddenly fealt a series of shots striking him, his thick hide\n&gt; &gt; protected him from the light artillery making it feel like nothing\n&gt; &gt; more than a nuisance.(Since Pacifix is so close he&#39;d be in the line of\n&gt; &gt; fire too.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Slags flames heated up the battlefield again causing the tunnel to\n&gt; &gt; feel like a blast furnace. He tried to grab Pacifix and use him as a\n&gt; &gt; shield knowing that the Triceratops would have to stop his attack if\n&gt; &gt; one of his side was between them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Branding used her good barrel to launch a wave of flames toward Swoop\n&gt; &gt; detonating the missles.
