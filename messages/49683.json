In a few weeks\nyou will experience a spasm of momentary pain, then a\nfew days later it will happen again, then it will\ncontinue as your spark breaks down constantly getting\nmore and more frequent until it occurs every few\nminutes, you won&#39;t be able to sleep for the pain, you\nwon&#39;t be able to eat for risk of choking during an\nattack.  Then when the spasms join together in a never\nending barrage of pain you will experience the most\npainful, and last few hours of you life.  Depending on\nhow strong you are this may take from 8 months to 2\nyears.  One last thing, I&#39;m the only one in the\nuniverse who can cure you.\n\n--- aerosmith60@... wrote:\n&gt;  Proto jumped infront of the vok destroyer not going\n&gt; near the rest of the \n&gt; shots.  This would give time for megatron to get\n&gt; away.  He sent a spikes \n&gt; towards rodimus and owlhawk.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
