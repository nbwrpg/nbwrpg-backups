The bot was no fun.\n&gt;\n&gt; Teltoli looked up in surprise as he shot the deer and the tree. She\n&gt; raised her right eyebrow, and let out a small giggle, disbelieving.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Okay, you come in here, demanding that Carnage must be killed\n&gt; because she is killing wildlife. That I partially understand. But\n&gt; now, you go and kill the thing you are trying to save. Or do you a\n&gt; fancy towards fat, hair, ugly pigs? So no, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to\n&gt; take you seriously, especially if you act like that!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She let out another tiny giggle, and put a hand over her mouth,\n&gt; keeping her gun still aimed at Instrat.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
