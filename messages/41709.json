She would \nahve to find a way to improve things around here. That is if she was \ngoing to stay a while. She saw the globe and looked at the hologram. \nThe image was more refined than what she was used to. She would have \nto learn the upgrades since her slumber. She looked up at \nGalvatron. &quot;Uh, pardon my ignorance, but why are you doing this? I&#39;m \nnot part of your troops? Why help me rejoin my comrads?&quot; She took a \nstep back.

Mine alone. Then my hand print is put here.&quot; He pointed to \na blank \n&gt; pad&quot; which brings us in. A holographic view of the globe popped \nup. &quot;What are \n&gt; the names of your colleagues? And you knew magnus when he began his \ngroup of \n&gt; joined factions from maximal to preds.
