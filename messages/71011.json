With a gripped fist, and one good missile carrier working, he na=\r\nrrows his optics further, and aims toward Hydras, attempting a very complex=\r\n but close range shot to his chest. And now, since lack of energy envelopes=\r\n him, he again loses his vision.  \n\n&quot; If you think what you&#39;ve done to me, =\r\nis going to stop me from winning back the freedom of innocent beings and my=\r\n comrades, you&#39;re sadly mistaken Hydras!  IT&#39;S TIME TO PAY OFF YOUR DEBT!&quot;\n=\r\n\nHe fires, not knowing where that shot will go.  It was clear his temper wa=\r\ns at a breaking point and he was not about to take scrap from anyone.   As =\r\nthe shot rings out, the recoil of that weapon causes him to stumble, yet no=\r\nw, weakness has eveloped him further, as he loses his footing, and crashes =\r\nto the ground, on his left side.\n\nNight Shift and Straight Shot scramble as=\r\n they dodge firepower and quickly try to reach Tucson Prime.  Straight Shot=\r\n&#39;s eyes, wide with fear, and shock.\n\n&quot;NOOO!  Tucson!  OHH PRIMUS NOOO!&quot;\n\nSh=\r\ne&#39;s quick to get to his side as is Night Shift.\n\n&quot;TUCSON, TALK TA ME! C&#39;MON=\r\n, YOU&#39;RE SO NOT DO&#39;N THIS TA US! YA CAN&#39;T!  C&#39;MON, SNAP OUT OF IT MAN!&quot;\n\nNi=\r\nght Shift opens a com link to Noctorro.\n\n&quot;NIGHT SHIFT TA NOCTORRO!  OVER, W=\r\nE GOT AN EMERGENCY!  TUCSON&#39;S DOWN, I REPEAT TUCSON&#39;S DOWN!&quot;\n\nStraight Shot=\r\n looks over to Kup.\n\n&quot;KUP, HELP US!  WE GOTTA MOVE TUCSON TA COVER!&quot;\n\nThen,=\r\n a groan from Tucson as he somewhat gains concsciousness.\n\n&quot; It&#39;s - It&#39;s al=\r\nl right, I - I can do this.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot stops him from trying to get up=\r\n.\n\n&quot;No, Tucson, you can&#39;t!  You&#39;re losing battery fluid and you hardly have=\r\n enough energy to keep awake!  Night Shift is trying to get a hold of Nocto=\r\nrro, and we&#39;re gonna get ya somewhere safe from harm.  We can&#39;t risk it, Tu=\r\ncson, we need you alive! Ughh, why the scrap do ya have ta be so stubborn?!=\r\n  You&#39;ve always been like this!  When you put your mind ta something you do=\r\nn&#39;t stop until you get it done!  Well, this time, I&#39;m NOT letting you!&quot;\n\nTu=\r\ncson couldn&#39;t help but listen to her.\n\n&quot;All right, you - wouldn&#39;t have yell=\r\ned at me if you didn&#39;t care.  I understand.&quot;\n\nShe sighs.\n\n&quot;Finally, some se=\r\nnse actually gets through that directory of yours. Now, hold still, you&#39;ll =\r\nlose more battery fluid if ya try ta move.&quot;\n\nInside the Black Tower, Rat Tr=\r\nap gets the message, as he gets up, and scrambles for his life, as he quick=\r\nly backtracks the way he got in. \n\n&quot;I hear ya Rodimus!  Ohhhh, time ta haul=\r\n tail!  Hey, by the way, I can&#39;t get through ta Wheels!  I think somethn&#39;s =\r\nreally wrong with &#39;em, because he usually responds right away ta me!&quot;\n\nOuts=\r\nide the Ark, Uproar and Quickstride continue to stick close to Rodimus and =\r\nthe others and nodd as they look to each other.  Uproar grins.\n\n&quot;Cool, so i=\r\nf the fortress goes bye bye, then we regain the control of the Ark... Maybe=\r\n it&#39;s better if we wait it out a little bit.&quot;\n\nQuickstride grins too.\n\n&quot;Yea=\r\nh, true, if we wait it out, then we got a better chance at getting in safel=\r\ny, and effectively.. I like that idea. I&#39;d rather not have ta damage anythi=\r\nng in the Ark... &quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;superc=\r\nyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Okay, as agreed, I am not going to dictate thi=\r\ns battle&#39;s results, I am\n&gt; just describing it to keep everything together. =\r\nI wanted to see how this one\n&gt; would run. HOWEVER please keep in mind that =\r\nit is difficult if not\n&gt; impossible to talk on the radio, especially to giv=\r\ne long speeches while in\n&gt; the middle of a hand to hand battle without rece=\r\niving some sort of damage.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; *AT THE BATTLE!!!*\n&gt; \n&gt; The battl=\r\ne near the black tower continues to rage on! Tuscon attempting to\n&gt; bring t=\r\nhe full brunt of his Ninjabot training to the fore! He is in the\n&gt; battle o=\r\nf his life, trying to fend off Hydras, the leader of the Predacon\n&gt; forces,=\r\n with only one good working arm, even as precious battery fluid\n&gt; continues=\r\n to leak from the wound in his shoulder. Hydras on the other hand\n&gt; looks t=\r\no be fairly undamaged, his laughter echoing across the battlefield as\n&gt; he =\r\nuses his many heads bite at Tuscon and spit fire!\n&gt; \n&gt; As Tuscon attempts t=\r\no communicate with the rest of his comrades, all he gets\n&gt; is for his troub=\r\nle is the sound of feedback and noise. Above the battlefield\n&gt; Deepstryke i=\r\nn his massive gun mode is still watching over the battle and\n&gt; emitting his=\r\n RF jamming beams, blocking all Maximal and Autobot radio\n&gt; signals in this=\r\n battle!\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as Tuscon is beginning to realize how dire his situation=\r\n is, Iguanus,\n&gt; the Predacon Demolitions and artillery expert locks his own=\r\n incendiary\n&gt; launcher on Tuscon, and with a smile pulls the trigger bringi=\r\nng his own\n&gt; formidable firepower down on the Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inferno and Ins=\r\necticon do much the same thing!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup continue moving and firing again=\r\nst Phobia.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Straightshot] She quickly saw that Kup needed\n&gt; &gt; some h=\r\nelp, and quickly darts in, with a leap\n&gt; &gt; attack to attempt a rapid fire a=\r\nrrow assault on Phobia\n&gt; \n&gt; Straightshot and Kup fire into the air, filling=\r\n it with arrows! But Phobia\n&gt; who had been clipped in the wing last time di=\r\ndn&#39;t try to swing in as close\n&gt; on this run, giving her a few more seconds =\r\nto out maneuver the slower ground\n&gt; based Maximals.\n&gt; \n&gt; She laughed, her s=\r\nhrill voice cutting through the air, &quot;Is that all you have\n&gt; Maximals?!?&quot; S=\r\nhe swung around, her own guns steaming in the cool air from\n&gt; the workout s=\r\nhe had been giving them. With an agile wing-flip she brings\n&gt; herself aroun=\r\nd for another run, however this time it is not just machine\n&gt; guns she brin=\r\ngs to bear. With a click and a heavy clunking sound, rockets\n&gt; that had bee=\r\nn positioned beneath her wings detached and ignite as they began\n&gt; travelli=\r\nng towards Kup&#39;s and Straight Shot&#39;s position!\n&gt; \n&gt; Overhead several sweeps=\r\n continue to fly, lending their firepower to the\n&gt; general cacophony of the=\r\n battle as Waspinator and Terrorsaur fly in through\n&gt; the smoke that is beg=\r\ninning to rise from the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Talon jumped to aside and roll, it w=\r\nas a calculated move.\n&gt; &gt; Then she stood up and aimed at Skyshadow&#39;s head a=\r\nnd said\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Bye, bye&quot; and open fire\n&gt; \n&gt; Skyshadow, who had been watching =\r\nTalon up to this point, managed to use his\n&gt; left hand to bat Talon&#39;s weapo=\r\nn aside, turning what may have been a death\n&gt; dealing blast into one that j=\r\nust lanced into his shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You Fool!&quot; He screamed, his optics turn=\r\ning crimson in anger as smoke rose\n&gt; from his left shoulder. &quot;You can&#39;t win=\r\n! We will just have to do this the\n&gt; HARD WAY!&quot; With his right hand, which =\r\nwas in actuality a large pincer like\n&gt; claw, he attempted to throttle Talon=\r\n by the neck! &quot;Die Maximal!&quot; he said,\n&gt; his voice deep and venomous.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe other Fuzors move up behind Talon. &quot;You would look like a tasty morsel.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; Quickstrike said in his strange wild-west accent, Buzzclaw, Terragator a=\r\nnd\n&gt; Injector just laughed evilly as they all surrounded him.\n&gt; \n&gt; *OUTSIDE=\r\n THE ARK*\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, I think I have another idea ta help that one along\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Rodimus. The shield around the ark, does that only work\n&gt; &gt; above ground=\r\n or underground too? Because if it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; work underground, I could bu=\r\nrrow a tunnel beneath the ark,\n&gt; &gt; and come above ground near an alternativ=\r\ne entrance, if it\n&gt; &gt; has one. With your scrambling devices, and my ability=\r\n ta\n&gt; &gt; dig under ground, we could get in without much of a fuss.\n&gt; &gt; Whoev=\r\ner&#39;s out there wouldn&#39;t even know we&#39;re on the move.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; I know how ta dig=\r\n without making noise.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, and while =\r\nhe does that, I could show myself, and\n&gt; &gt; create a distraction long enough=\r\n for you guys ta get in.\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;re not the most brilliant of the maximals, =\r\nbut we know\n&gt; &gt; the basics.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus glanced at Uproar and then down a=\r\nt his frame as if suspicious as to\n&gt; how a bot designed to be a cat could a=\r\nctually be a good digger too. With a\n&gt; slight shrug he turned to look at Ro=\r\ndimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Quickstride.&quot; Rodimus said, his voice intense but low &quot;If try =\r\nthis, you\n&gt; will not be able to join us.&quot; Rodimus looked down at the device=\r\n in his hand\n&gt; as he spoke, &quot;The window of opportunity to get in will be a =\r\nfew seconds at\n&gt; most. You would have to be some distance from us in order =\r\nfor your ruse to\n&gt; be effective.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Leo II nodded, he was about to say s=\r\nomething more when Rodimus held up his\n&gt; hand for silence as he got a messa=\r\nge from Perceptor . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;All my inventions has self-destruction prog=\r\nram can\n&gt; &gt; destroy the BlackFortress&quot;. Claims to be able to free\n&gt; &gt; up ch=\r\nannels. And about Nightlight can download my\n&gt; &gt; weapons energy to reboot h=\r\ner\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus nodded, &quot;Good. Then I will alert the others so that they ca=\r\nn prepare\n&gt; to evacuate. Give us about thirty seconds!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked over=\r\n at Quickstride and Uproar. &quot;We may not need your distraction.\n&gt; Perceptor =\r\nsays he can blow the Black Tower. I am sure that when that\n&gt; happens, whate=\r\nver Predacon inside will be distracted as he learns that his\n&gt; base is gone=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *INSIDE THE ARK*\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Elita lower her body and hide behind the pi=\r\npers,\n&gt; &gt; she waited and watched\n&gt; \n&gt; Footsteps could be heard approaching =\r\nElita, a light shuffling sound, almost\n&gt; a stumbling sound, and then a grun=\r\nt. The hall is dark, but dimly the shape\n&gt; of something moving in the room =\r\nwith Elita can be dimly seen.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *INSIDE THE BLACK TOWER!!!*\n&gt; \n&gt; As R=\r\nat Trap fell over seemingly poisoned, the spider-like bots moved up to\n&gt; hi=\r\nm as if to examine him, small antenna like scanners extend from their\n&gt; fra=\r\nme.\n&gt; \n&gt; However they are quickly distracted by Windlord and his continued =\r\nmovement\n&gt; so they run on, leaving Rat Trap entirely alone for the moment.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Rat Trap!&quot; Rodimus&#39; voice came over the Maximal thief&#39;s radio. Rodimu=\r\ns&#39;\n&gt; voice was somewhat fuzzy, having to cut through the interference from =\r\nthe\n&gt; battlefield, but fortunately Rat Trap was far enough away that he cou=\r\nld\n&gt; still hear him. &quot;I believe Tuscon said he was sending you inside the t=\r\nower?\n&gt; We have a plan to destroy it. Get out now! You have thirty seconds!=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
