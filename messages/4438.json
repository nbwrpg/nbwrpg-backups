For one, Black Arachnia, \nInferno, and Rampage are in the Ark running from internal defenses.  You&#39;d \nhave to magically get in their and speak to them.\n\nScorponok is in a hidden base.  You&#39;d have to magically find him.\n\n---\n\nAs for Icedemon, how are you finding everything?  Magically finding \nMegatron&#39;s unfinished base that is hidden deep in a mountain.  This is NOT \nthe first, second, or even fifth time you&#39;ve done that Icedemon.  Just being \nin that mountain (depending on the rock, it&#39;s up to whoever made up the \nmountain may block conventional scanners.  It&#39;s good that you&#39;ve stopped with \nthe portals, that&#39;s a start.  But you really shouldn&#39;t find everything out so \neasily.  It doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense most of the time and it ruins other \npeople&#39;s fun.  (Not that ruining other people&#39;s fun is bad , but you do it \nconstantly by somewhat moding).\n\n"}}
