Communications will be cut off and we will\n&gt; be on our own with=\r\n no other back up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME&#39;s powerful gaze continued to scan throug=\r\nh those who were\n&gt; present. &quot;Be ready for anything and keep your weapons on=\r\n full and . .\n&gt; . &quot; His gaze fell once again on DINOBOT and then RAT TRAP a=\r\nnd\n&gt; QUICKSTRIDE, &quot; . . . and remember who the enemy is. For the moment we\n=\r\n&gt; are allies. If we canot work together as a group, then I can assure\n&gt; you=\r\n we will certainly die as one.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO turned to look at the jungle, &quot;Max=\r\nimals . . .&quot; He paused and then\n&gt; added, &quot; and Predacons . . . TRANSFORM an=\r\nd ROLL OUT!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO Shifted to his beast mode, as did SANTON who became a=\r\nn African\n&gt; elephant, WINGCALIBER who turned into a bald eagle and the FUZO=\r\nRS who\n&gt; turned into various incarnations of partial animals.\n&gt; \n&gt; With an =\r\neasy run LEO began to move towards the jungle, obviously\n&gt; keeping his sens=\r\nes on high alert.\n&gt; \n&gt; WINGCALIBER, NOCTORRO, and AIRHAMMER did the same, b=\r\nut taking ot the air.\n&gt; \n\n\nAt this point, VICE GRIP and DRILL BIT continued=\r\n to drill over through the ground in stealth mode, going a bit slower than =\r\nthe fliers and ground units, but able to keep up by sound.\n\nWhat they had t=\r\nhe benefit of was hopefully going completely concealed to be an &#39;ace in the=\r\n hole&#39; should the Predacons come under attack, to make a quick escape if th=\r\ney were overwhelmed to retreat through the ground, or to pick off enemy uni=\r\nts individually via tunnel warfare.\n\nUp in the air, WASPINATOR flew along w=\r\nith the equipment he was carrying, flanking somewhere behind CRYOTEK to hop=\r\nefully let the larger Predacon serve as a shield.  Of course, this being WA=\r\nSPINATOR in the event of attack any near misses would probably disintegrate=\r\n him, he woudl be grabbed by CRYOTEK to block a hit, a missed attack or swi=\r\nng would send him crashing to the ground, etc.\n\nDINOBOT meanwhile ran along=\r\n on the ground in his TRANSMETAL DINOSAUR mode, not using his rocket booste=\r\nrs for the moment.\n\nAnd BLACKARACHNIA followed along a ways behind, virtual=\r\nly invisible in the jungle canopy.\n\n\n\n"}}
