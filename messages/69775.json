If they were still in the area, a =\r\ngood sonic blast from his sonar system would surely mess up their telemetry=\r\n and do a number on their own gyroscopic systems.  He comes to a short halt=\r\n, tired of being stalked, he kicks up dust around short pivoting tires with=\r\n a loud screech, and configures his sonar attack to be harmless to Autobt a=\r\nnd Maximal kind but NOT harmless to Predacons or Decepticons!  \n\n&quot; That&#39;s i=\r\nt, I am not going to play by the rules ANY MORE! THEY WANT TROUBLE THEY GOT=\r\n IT!&quot;\n\nHe blasts the sonar attack at full pitch.\n\n&quot; Kup, if you pick up a s=\r\nonar disturbance, don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s me.  It may effect your computer system=\r\ns and I do appologize for that.  But whatever or whoever is out there isn&#39;t=\r\n about to get away that easy!&quot;  \n\nHe puts himself into drive and continues =\r\nhis drive toward the Ark, blasting the attack continuously.\n\n&quot;They think I&#39;=\r\nm a pushover on wheels, they&#39;ll think twice after this, I assure you Lord E=\r\nlder... They&#39;ll think twice.&quot;\n\nHe tries really hard to hold back a short te=\r\nmper. Tucson knew when to play games and when it was time to get serious.  =\r\nThis was the time to get serious.\n\n&quot;Oh yeah, Kup, in my quarters you&#39;ll fin=\r\nd a cross bow in my weapon chamber.  Please, have that ready for me when I =\r\nget back and make sure to put a good amount of plasma arrows in the energiz=\r\ner for me.  You&#39;ll find all of that near an old sun dial I was working on b=\r\nefore I left the Ark ages ago.&quot;\n\nHe turns his attentions back to Lord Elder=\r\n.\n\n&quot; Before all this happened to me, my spare time was spent restorring old=\r\n artifacts and weapons.  I&#39;m hoping to go back to doing some resteration, i=\r\nt&#39;s the only thing that quells my temper which I do admit, gets rather shor=\r\nt in times like these.  Remind me to show you what I&#39;ve done when we get ba=\r\nck to the Ark.  I have a small work area in my quarters where I&#39;ve managed =\r\nto restore a few small artifacts... Well including one fairly large sun dia=\r\nl..  But most of all, I&#39;ve saved and restorred ancient Autobot weaponry whi=\r\nch may still prove useful to us now.  I have a feeling we might just need i=\r\nt.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; The trip back is mildly uneventful. The day moved forward as the su=\r\nn\n&gt; slid from its mid point position to a one significantly lower in the\n&gt; =\r\nskies. Occasionally in the distance a large dinosaur could be seen,\n&gt; from =\r\na predator who glanced in the direction of Lord Elder and Tuscon,\n&gt; but who=\r\n realized quickly that this metal machine was definitely not\n&gt; prey; to a s=\r\nauropod, who&#39;s small head on a long neck  turned to look\n&gt; at the vehicle p=\r\nassed by, and even the smaller variety of creatures,\n&gt; from scavengers to p=\r\nredator, ones who typically scattered as the\n&gt; vehicle that was Tuscon boun=\r\nced and yet moved easily across the broken\n&gt; terrain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Up ahead the tre=\r\nes, which had been near constant companions during\n&gt; most of their trip beg=\r\nan to break away as they came into more open\n&gt; country. Up ahead the beginn=\r\nings of a mountain range could be seen.\n&gt; Above them a flock of what could =\r\nalmost look like birds flew, although\n&gt; instead of possessing feathers, the=\r\ny had large leathery and larger\n&gt; bodies.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re almost back&quot; Lord Eld=\r\ner said. He had been silent through most\n&gt; of the trip, his face wearing a =\r\nthoughtful look. &quot;There, that mountain\n&gt; over there, at the base of it.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll activate the door in the shield for us.&quot; Elder said as he was\n&gt; ab=\r\nout to open a communication signal to the Ark. However Elder paused\n&gt; and l=\r\nook around, as if looking for something. &quot;Something&#39;s wrong here\n&gt; . . . &quot; =\r\nhe said as he continued to look.\n&gt; \n&gt; Above them the prehistoric avians tur=\r\nned almost as one, their calls\n&gt; almost defiant as they moved swiftly in th=\r\ne direction that Tuscon and\n&gt; Elder had come from. &quot;It&#39;s like we&#39;re being w=\r\natched.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Lord Elder)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
