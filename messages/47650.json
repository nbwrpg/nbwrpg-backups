The ships bulky form crashed at the edge of a \n&gt; swampy jungle like area, losing several of the lower decks, and \nmany \n&gt; sensory capabilities. The rear thrusters had also been damaged, and \n&gt; one of the three had come off in the initial stages of the crash.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the sliding speed of the craft decreases, Megatron holds on \nwhile \n&gt; glancing at the rest of his crew. &quot;Stop damnit...&quot; he growls and \nhis \n&gt; words are punctuated by a bang as he is thrown forward, almost \n&gt; losing his grips. The visual display of the remainging computer \n&gt; showed that the ship had crashed into a thickly rooted tree, and \nhad \n&gt; been slowed down enough to stop the sliding. Their trail was rather \n&gt; obvious unfortunately, a long groove in the rocks and soil followed \n&gt; a path that lead right to the ship. He hoped that the Maximals had \n&gt; encountered the same situation provided they had followed him-- no, \n&gt; he knew that they were coming, and would likely be close behind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Glancing around at his crew again. He starts giving out orders. \nThey \n&gt; needed to move, and to move quickly. &quot;Drillbit, get on that \ncomputer \n&gt; screen, and give me a status report, it looks bad.&quot; He steps down \n&gt; from the command chair, and turns to Waspinator. Waspinator, get \n&gt; outside and do some scouting. We need to know what the terrain is \n&gt; like. Don&#39;t go too far, try to maintaina perimeter. Come back \nwithin \n&gt; two hours.&quot; (ooC: email me for info about terrain)\n&gt; \n&gt; Leaving those two to their tasks, he turns the the rest of \ncrew. &quot;We \n&gt; have arrived, and we are by no means prepared to do anything but \n&gt; make repairs at the moment. Nemesis Enforcer, go to the storage \nbay, \n&gt; grab the repair kits, and some extra computer parts.&quot; Megatron \n&gt; growls, &lt;DELAYS... accursed delays...&gt; &quot;Perceptor, take \nQuickstrike. \n&gt; You two go look for a suitable place to start mining Energon.&quot; Last \n&gt; for the moment, &quot;Inferno, make yourself useful, and bring back all \n&gt; the salvagable scraps of metal that you can find that came off of \n&gt; the ship during the crash.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He sits back in his command chair, &quot;Yess... Everyone else, report \n&gt; here for orders.&quot; The mighy transformer known as Megatron frowns \n&gt; angrily at the unexpected results of going through the time-space \n&gt; wormhole...\n&gt; \n&gt; ooC: I was wondering what people think about having our world that \n&gt; we are going to RPing on is going to resemble a developing form of \n&gt; Pangea at about the late Triassic/early Jurrasic period, when it \nwas \n&gt; starting to divide into the continents. I could creat a map, unless \n&gt; someone can find me a good one in black and white, for the \nworldmap, \n&gt; and we could work off of of that. \n&gt; \n&gt; As for factions, we were going to have 5, the Maximals, the \n&gt; Predacons, the Autobots, the Decepticons, and a neutral faction to \n&gt; be determined by a vote. A question was brought up about groups of \n&gt; bots that weren&#39;t in factions that, for example, wanted to hang out \n&gt; together for survival etc. Since I&#39;m not entirely sure how to deal \n&gt; with that thought at the moment, the council will have a discussion \n&gt; again soon regarding it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Updates for the website will be done on thursday since that&#39;s my \nday \n&gt; off (other than the weekends). I&#39;ve got to email Yan and hopefully \n&gt; get him to make some changes to the website. (not text related \nones, \n&gt; cause those are the only ones i can do)\n\nWaspinator shifted into beast mode and flew out side &quot;Waspinator \nnever get important job, nothing here but trees&quot; he mumbled as he \nflew looking at the rain forest as well as some mountains at the west.\n\n&quot;Maybe well get lucky and well find someone to thrash on the way&quot; \nQuickstrike said to Perceptor.\n\n&quot;Yes my queen&quot; Inferno said said flew out side and begun to drag the \nthruster that had broken off back.\n\n\n"}}
