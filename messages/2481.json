The last time \nshe had been hunting all they had done was run through the woods screaming \nat the top of their lungs. No wonder they had come home empty handed.* \nTavatron chuckled softly to herself as she remembered the constant bickering \nover who&#39;s fault the bad hunt had been.\n\nHowever, this was neither the time nor the place to reminice about one&#39;s \npast. Tavatron sighed as she gazed into the forest, the light filtering \nthrough the upper leaves. Her fur was a perfect match, dark like the earth \nand brown like the trees.\n\nTavatron took a deep breath, she could do this. It was just a little hunt, \nno big deal. It was no different than the practice battle she and Dinobot \nhad had a few days ago. Except this time they weren&#39;t hunting each other:\n\n&quot;I am ready.&quot; Tavatron begins to slowly move off deeper into the forest, \nevery sensor at full as she gazed about the forest floor in search of prey.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
