And could you give me a name to call \nyou that isn&#39;t insulting?&quot;\n\n* Carnage snarled as she jumped over a log and landed in a deep puddle that \nled out into a swamp, she looked at it. Moss covered, blanketed in mist and \ngreen water, it reminded her of the swamp that she had landed in. Her home.\nShe sighed again and continued to travel along, it was strange to have a \nclone as one of their traveling party now. But, right now she could care \nless, the thought of hearing Megatron&#39;s screams was all that she thought \nabout. How thrilling it would be to have the killer of her best friend dead, \nhow satisfying it would feel!\nCarnage growled but then smiled...*\n\n&quot; Do you think that it&#39;s possible to leave a little of that tin tyrant for \nme, or at least let me get in a few good hits before you kill him?&quot;\n\n* Just then her leg seized and she dropped to the ground like a bag of \nrocks, an old wound that just wouldn&#39;t leave her alone!\nCarnage fell waist deep into the swamp sludge and snarled, if it wasn&#39;t \nmemories of her own torture then it was a permanent side effect of it!\nShe tried to stand but then fell back into the sludge, it only took one \nwound of torture to drop her...the only one that never healed properly!!\nCarnage sighed and tryed relaxed her leg, the sludge was cold but it was \nslowly easing it. She stayed there and tried to relax, as long as Teltoli \ngot to the Maximal base she didn&#39;t care if she was left behind...as long as \nshe reached the base.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
