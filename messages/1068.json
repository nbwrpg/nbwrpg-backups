We are damaged as well as our\nbase\n&gt; and require repairs, this would be a nice time to do that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She looked over at the damaged island controls and sighed...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; But you all fought well and deserve a few mega-cycles in the CR\nchambers,\n&gt; despite the outcome of this battle. Believe it or not...I&#39;m rather proud\nof\n&gt; you all.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor then looked back to Prowl, a tired smile on her face...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; But after you repair please return here and pick up a weapon for\nyourself,\n&gt; I will be speaking to the remainder of the Maximals as well after their\n&gt; repairs.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then turned to Teltoli, she looked the fuzor over but then\nnodded...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; As I can see, you have found the weapons hold. Good, you have done well.\n&gt; And it&#39;s obviousy that I haven&#39;t told you my name yet...it&#39;s  Iron Raptor.\n&gt; And I&#39;m glad to have you as a member of the Maximal force.\n&gt; If you have any questions or something like that feel free to ask me and\nif\n&gt; I&#39;m not available then you can ask another.\n&gt; But for now, if you&#39;re damaged then simply follow Prowl to the CR\nchambers.\n&gt; After your repair is complete please return here, there will be a short\n&gt; meeting.*\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor then turned towards the controls again and set the missile\n&gt; launched on the pile of weapons on the floor, it could be used in better\n&gt; hands then her own. She looked forward to working with the new bots about\n&gt; but it was still going to be difficult at times.\n&gt; She opened her com-link to an all Maximal frequency, it was time to bring\n&gt; every bot in for a well deserved rest and repair...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Attention, all Maximal forces. If you are not already on your way in I\n&gt; suggest that you begin making your way towards that goal, you&#39;ve all\nfought\n&gt; well and deserve a good repair and rest. After you have recovered may you\n&gt; please make your way to the bridge for a short meeting. Thank you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Now it was up to them and her now, the base and it&#39;s bots needed a good\n&gt; repair and so did she. But her own repairs weren&#39;t that important right\nnow,\n&gt; besides, all she would be doing is taking up a chamber that a more wounded\n&gt; soldier would need.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed as she began to slowly fork on the damage, she wasn&#39;t a\n&gt; bot that was ever trained to do heavy repairs but she knew a little.\n&gt; She continued to work carefully and slowly as to make no mistakes, she was\n&gt; waiting until the remainder of the Maximals recovered and reloaded.\n&gt; Then she would have a little...chat with them.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Porsche Boxter.
