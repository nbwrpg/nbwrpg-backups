There was only the\nslightest jarring bump as they touched ground. Shutting down power to\nthe engines Lord Elder turned to look at the others.\n\n&quot;Quickstride and Rat Trap.&quot; he said gravely, &quot;Report to Lord Perseus\nat the old base, either he or Legacy should be able to fill you in on\nthe situation there.&quot; Elder glanced at the computer screen which still\nshowed a minion flying above the old base.\n\n&quot;Be very careful. Minions are not Autobots and are more than\nDecepticons or Predacons, and are not to be underestimated.&quot;\n\nElder looked at Tuscon although he was still talking to Quickstride\nand Rat Trap, &quot;Remember the war we just fought a short while ago to\nprotect the Ark from from the Minion&#39;s attack? At that time Cyclonus\nwas a hearld of Unicron himself. With the power Unicron was giving him\nhe was able to defeat Rodimus Prime.&quot; Elder frowned, &quot;We think it was\nthat defeat that allowed Hydras to capture Rodimus and turn him into\nwhat he is now.&quot;\n\nTurning to look at the screen and then at Rat Trap and Quickstride\nElder continued, &quot;If this Minion is willing to take on the entire base\nby himself, he may be that powerful as well, or even more so.&quot;\n\nElder turned to look at Tuscon once again, &quot;As for mucking around with\nPredacon shell programs, hmmmm.&quot; he said thoughtfully. &quot;We have not\nhad that much success with reversing them.&quot; Elder tapped his finger\nidly on the console, &quot;Remember when Optimus Primal first crashed here\non old Earth? Megatron had been able to beat us to some of the Maximal\npods, and use his shell program to turn them into Predacons.&quot; Elder\nsighed, &quot;Some of them are still on his side today.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible, I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;s going to be\ndifficult.&quot; Elder said as he looked around at everyone.\n\n(TAG)\n\n(OOC: I am not sure what Tuscon and Rat Trap were trying to do, when\nthey were attempting to &#39;tap into Rodimus via Predacon code&#39;??)\n\nPreston\n(Lord Elder)\n\n"}}
