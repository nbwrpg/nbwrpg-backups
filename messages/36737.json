Each used on the other has devestating effects. However \nvey few robots have the ability to draw dimension from any of the \ndimensions. Iron Raptor and Liono Prime are the only two I know of \nthat can draw Matrix Energy other then Zero. And the Infecticon \nEnforcers are the only chars that can draw energy from the \nChaochitan. There are no Pit energy drawing preds in this RPG thus \nfar...\n\n\n"}}
