She knew that\nthe healing process was not yet complete.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed and gasped, she said through clenched teeth.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Computer, how did I get here?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With a slightly muffled tome the computer responded.*\n&gt;\n&gt; COMP: &quot;Subject Prowl has brought primary subject to CR chambers.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor closed her optics as a tired and warn sleep began to\novertake her, another favor that she owed her Maximal friend. But as she was\ninjured she made a personal note to check on everybot when she had\nrecovered, even though she was no longer in command she still cared about\nthe wellbeing of the Maximal troops.\n&gt; Besides, if it wasn&#39;t for them the Alliance would have total control over\nthe Ark as well as the Preds. Even though they had lost the base was still\ntheirs! So in truth, did they truly loose?\n&gt; Iron Raptor quickly slipped into a dreamless sleep but was thankful that\nProwl had saved her life.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ( OK, Someone wanted me to say the damage that the Ark got...well here it\nis:\n&gt; Structural damage to the roof and main side, a few more gashes and holes\nto the left side of the ship. A few systems such as...uh...secondary\nscanners and autoguns 1 through 3 have been knocked off line. I think that\nthat&#39;s about fair. Besides, the Maximals will have their hands full with\njust the first two.\n&gt; Well, there it is.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
