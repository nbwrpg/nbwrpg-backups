Its a bit hard to type and\n&gt; concentrate while your brother is attacking you.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Prowl/Reptilica/Other Bots::\n&gt;\n&gt; Reptilica doesn&#39;t move as Dinobot tenses up, knowing that any move for the\n&gt; reptile would be suicide. He growls as the other decloak, the rest of the\n&gt; Alliance members in the room shifting their weapons. He growls at Tavatron\nas\n&gt; he hears her words.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Silence, femm!&quot; he yells, pointing his gun at her. He sighs as Prowl&#39;s\nthumb\n&gt; twitches dangeroustly over the button, lowering the gun.\n&gt;\n&gt; Reptilica looks back at Prowl.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Allright, Maximal,&quot; he says, &quot;Give it to me and you have my word that no\n&gt; harm will come to you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Prowl shakes his head, now confident that he had the support of the other\n&gt; Maximals there. &quot;As I said before, I&#39;ll give it to you at the edge of the\n&gt; clearing.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Reptilica growls, turning around to look at the other Alliance members.\n&quot;Move\n&gt; aside. They&#39;re coming through.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The others look at him blankly, surprised that he was actually letting the\n&gt; Maximals out.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You heard me! MOVE IT!&quot; Reptilica bellows, losing his temper and aiming\nhis\n&gt; gun at Pyro. Pyro growls, aiming his own gun at Reptilica along with the\n&gt; other Oblitercons. Reptilica growls, lowering his gun. &quot;Just move it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pyro growls again, he and the other Alliance bots backing off into the\n&gt; hallway.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You guys come within ten feet of any of us, and the place blows,&quot; Prowl\nsays\n&gt; arragontly, walking forward. It wasn&#39;t like him to talk like that, but he\nhad\n&gt; to act it to look serious about blowing them all to scrap. Reptilica and\nthe\n&gt; others back up as Prowl aproaches, careful not to get near him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Prowl says to the other Maximals as he continues to walk\nforward,\n&gt; dangeroustly holding his thumb over the button.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
