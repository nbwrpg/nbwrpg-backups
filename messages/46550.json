He had no optics \n&gt; available, and didn&#39;t want to spend the time to make them, so he \nhad \n&gt; implanted a infrared sensor to do for the moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; He places the head onto Perceptor&#39;s upper torso, and brushes off \nhis \n&gt; hands. &quot;Hmmm...&quot; His precise hands open Perceptor&#39;s chest \n&gt; compartment, and he attaches several cords to specific locations. \nHe \n&gt; then connects those cords to a machine that resembles an electric \n&gt; chair. Switchblade sits in the chair, and draws a few more cords to \n&gt; him and attaches them to the back of his neck, and to his chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few of Nightstrike&#39;s strong thoughts of escape nudge at his \n&gt; concentration, but he shrugs them off, &lt;Later Nightstrike, I&#39;ve got \n&gt; more important things to attend to...&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few key memories need to be deleted from Perceptor&#39;s mind. \n&gt; Switchblade was about to dive in, and make the necessary \n&gt; corrections. The green glow leaves his optics, and the battle of \nthe \n&gt; mind begins between Perceptor and Switchblade.\n\n\n"}}
