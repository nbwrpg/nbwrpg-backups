With\na blast of firepower he held off =\r\nthe approaching insectoids as he\ncartwheeled to one side landing in a crouc=\r\nhed position, his weapon hot\nand smoking as it continued to lay down the ne=\r\neded cover fire. A quick\nglance at it showed him that it was begining to ru=\r\nn low, this battle\nwould need to end soon, or else . . .\n\nAs Tuscon mounted=\r\n the metal and positioned it properly, Vestige leaped\nfrom his position, sp=\r\nrang through the air, and with grim determination\nlanded squarly on the oth=\r\nerside sending Tuscon sailing through the air\nin the direction of the figur=\r\ne on the bed, who had up to this time had\nsome how remained clear of all th=\r\ne weapon&#39;s fire! No doubt that that\nwould soon change with Tuscon moving qu=\r\nickly in his direction.\n\nAs Tuscon moved through the air the insectoids att=\r\nempted to follow\nhim, a spray of metal and energy following him in a focuse=\r\nd swath of\ndestuctive power. Then with deadly precision the flying insectio=\r\nds\nbuzzed and then shot through the air quickly attemopting to close in\non =\r\nthe temporarily flying Autobot.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
