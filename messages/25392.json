He was going to be the only one who was going to get them all killed. \nBut obviously that didn�t matter to him, so she would leave him to his own \nthoughts and concentrate on those who had come at her call.\nShe looked towards Prowl at his comments. &lt; That�s just it, I don�t know if \nI�m making the right decisions. &gt;\nIron Raptor�s attention was suddenly grabbed by a familiar voice and she \nturned to see the battered Kluster and some of his crew come up to her from \nthe battlefield. He was a commander as well and it confused her slightly \nwhen he saluted to her, but it was just as well anyway.\nPlans to rally the Maximals together so that they were under a single \ncommand would happen after the battle was over and everything was fixed up.  \nThere could be too much confusion from having more then one commander.\nBut with her plans, and the Maximals help, the CF would be repaired in no \ntime and then they could get down to business: finding out a way to become \nstronger so that the battles they fought would be theirs even if it wasn�t \non their own ground like now.\nIron Raptor lifted a brow and showed concern as Proto stumbled towards her. \nThey really were beat. And she had a few wounds to show off too!\nA few moments later she also noticed Firearm, wondering faintly just where \nIris was. But she would hear from her soon enough. Besides, she could look \nafter herself, even when she was only a view-screen and a voice.\nIron Raptor almost jumped in surprise at FZ�s voice, opening her own comm to \nhim. *\n\n� I know, I know. Just give me a sec.�\n\n* This was getting really old really fast.\nShe looked towards Prowl. &lt; None of them will listen and now the CF might \nget blown up because of it. I think it�s time that what crew we have here \nand myself took the captives and led them out. &gt;\nIron Raptor opened her comm to FZ again. *\n\n� I know I�m in no position to make terms but all I can do now is meet you \nin neutral territory in an hour. Exchange there, then we can both go \ndifferent ways. There�s no way anything can happen here.\nBut as I said before, leave and the Maximals won�t follow. It�s not their \nnature to when there�s so much to repair. You�ll be left alone then and can \ntend to your own wounded.�\n\n* That was the best she could do right on that moment. It was wise and all \nshe could think of.\nFighting would kill them, she already knew that.\nCrippled crew and crippled ship wasn�t the way to victory. But she made a \nmental note to step up the CFs defenses when she had the repairs done, even \nif she had to do it on her own.\nIron Raptor stood there and waited, sure that the Maximals behind her \nwouldn�t attack unless she ever had to give the order. But, even though the \nAlliance was threatening, she knew that they were as sick of this fight as \nshe was. Or at least hoped.\nThey had the upper hand here, and fighting only made it worse.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
