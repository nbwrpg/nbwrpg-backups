If his last fluid pump\nexpired \nthen he \n&gt; would die, slow and painf=\r\nul.\n&gt; That was the very thing that worried him, more then anything at the \n=\r\nmoment.\n&gt; But then, something out of nowhere came into view on his right \ns=\r\nide, \n&gt; something that hadn&#39;t come into focus yet=85and touched him!\n&gt; Dino=\r\nbot quickly stood up and snapped his entire body around, the \nforce of \n&gt; t=\r\nhe action sending droplets of his own mech-fluid to splatter \nagainst \n&gt; Ne=\r\ncromancers side.\n&gt; It took his optic a moment to adjust; however, once it d=\r\nid he found \nno \n&gt; reason to be alarmed.\n&gt; It was that smaller bot whom he =\r\nhad told to help Tavatron, one in \nwhich he \n&gt; knew not the name of.\n&gt; He s=\r\ntraightened himself up the best he could, taking in \nconsideration about \n&gt;=\r\n just how damaged he was and the only thing he could manage was a \nshoulder=\r\n \n&gt; slumped stance.\n&gt; This was all getting far too much for him, the surpri=\r\nse from this \nbot only \n&gt; feeding his rage and speeding up his damaged syst=\r\nems.\n&gt; Dinobot glared at the small bot for a moment before relaxing his \nst=\r\nance a \n&gt; bit=85mainly for need of relaxing the muscles in his back and \npr=\r\neventing them \n&gt; from getting a charley horse.\n&gt; He listened to his words=\r\n=85and for once in his life had to agree\nwith \nhim.\n&gt; Dinobot needed help a=\r\nnd he knew it=85and would be a fool to swipe\nit \naside \n&gt; now.\n&gt; But then a=\r\ns he was about to accept Foxfingers&#39; assistance he\nheard \na \n&gt; familiar voi=\r\nce, one in which was belonging to a particular femm in \nwhich was \n&gt; pissin=\r\ng him right off at the moment.\n&gt; The tone of her defying voice causing his =\r\nhead to snap in her \ndirection, \n&gt; teeth bared and muscles strained.\n&gt; He w=\r\nouldn&#39;t care to say so, but at this very moment he hated\nher=85\nabsolutely =\r\n\n&gt; hated her. The sound of her voice, the feel of her aggression in \nthe ai=\r\nr, \n&gt; even the sight of her completely pushed his aggression further and \nf=\r\nurther \n&gt; to complete and utter rage!\n&gt; To this point he had controlled him=\r\nself the best he could, and \ntried his \n&gt; damnedest to keep his temper to a=\r\nt least a rate where he could \ncontrol \n&gt; it=85even barely.\n&gt; Dinobot&#39;s tai=\r\nl thrashed as he listened to her words, his\ncontrol \nnearly \n&gt; breaking and=\r\n unleashing the side of him in which he hadn&#39;t used\nin \nall his \n&gt; years in=\r\n fear of never gaining sanity back.\n&gt; He was known for berserk fighting=85w=\r\nhich bordered at\ninsanity=85and if \nhe had \n&gt; to use that style of combat n=\r\now=85so help the poor souls in his\nway.\n&gt; But instead of expressing the rag=\r\ne in which racked at his very \nbeing, a \n&gt; sudden hush came over him as he =\r\nstraightened himself completely \nout. His \n&gt; shoulder-plates no longer slum=\r\nped and his tail swaying calmly \nbehind him.\n&gt; He had indeed collected hims=\r\nelf, so to the point that he was \nutterly beyond \n&gt; anger now=85and that wa=\r\ns death to anyone who, so much, as looked\nat \nhim wrong.\n&gt; Dinobot glared a=\r\nt Tavatron, but now his aggression was beyond \nexpression=85and \n&gt; he simpl=\r\ny looked at her coldly. The rage completely disappearing \nfrom his \n&gt; featu=\r\nres, though his muscles remained tense.\n&gt; This was it, completely IT!!!\n&gt; H=\r\ne had had enough of her and her back talk, and was utterly sick of \nher and=\r\n \n&gt; her jabbering tone.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Of COURSE it would make a difference! I, fo=\r\nr one, would NEVER \nhave let you \n&gt; engage in battle in the first place! No=\r\nt after what it took me to \nget you \n&gt; back!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * His mind was just as =\r\nred hot as his temper, and if he didn&#39;t \nwatch himself \n&gt; he would end up s=\r\naying something=85or even doing something that\nwould \n&gt; eventually tip one =\r\nof them off the edge.\n&gt; But, he wasn&#39;t really thinking at the moment either=\r\n, rather\nmore \nacting then \n&gt; anything else.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And existing as a Tran=\r\nsmetal 2 has NOTHING to do with whether\nor \nnot you \n&gt; would have been capt=\r\nured. It was complete STUPIDITY, which had the \nresult of \n&gt; your fate.\n&gt; Y=\r\nou KNEW better then to simply go alone, yet you ignored your logic \nand lef=\r\nt \n&gt; alone anyway!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * His clawed hands were in fists, but not a single=\r\n vision of his \nrage had \n&gt; escaped=85other then the occasional raising of =\r\nhis voice.\n&gt; But it was also then that Dinobot saw Tavatrons temper slightl=\r\ny \nbecome more \n&gt; controllable, watching her every move as she approached h=\r\nim.\n&gt; He say the collected anger in her optics, but even as she was now \nin=\r\n control \n&gt; of HER anger, he knew that it was about time that he became the=\r\n \nmaster of \n&gt; his own.\n&gt; But, that would not be easy.\n&gt; He watched as Tava=\r\ntron walked up to Necromancer, agreeing that it \nwould be \n&gt; far better to =\r\nride back then walk, despite his anger it was also a \nslight \n&gt; relief to h=\r\nave her within sight and without such a high degree of \nrisk if \n&gt; being at=\r\ntacked if she would have walked.\n&gt; Dinobot turned his head towards the smal=\r\nler bot by his side, \nFoxfinger. \n&gt; Wondering vaguely if he was coming alon=\r\ng with them.\n&gt; His anger, strangely enough, was beginning to die down. Basi=\r\ncally \nto the \n&gt; point where he simply didn&#39;t feel=85anything.\n&gt; And the re=\r\nason for that, though not apparent to him now, was that \nhis \n&gt; systems wer=\r\ne shutting down and effecting his mental, neural \ncapacity \n&gt; circuits. Whi=\r\nsh meant, soon he wouldn&#39;t feel anything, be able\nto \ntouch \n&gt; anything, be=\r\n able to do anything.\n&gt; For, his fourth fluid pump had already began to dea=\r\nctivated, there \nwas just \n&gt; no extreme pain to announce it.\n&gt; The mech-flu=\r\nid flow which went to his brain to supply it with \noxygen was \n&gt; beginning =\r\nto slow down, and if he wasn&#39;t careful and wastes his \ntime to get \n&gt; back =\r\nto base, he would basically be brain dead.\n&gt; Dinobot growled, the anger spi=\r\nking up once again, but nothing as \nserious as \n&gt; before, more dampened and=\r\n calm.\n&gt; However, his expression didn&#39;t change, emotionless, cold, and \nagg=\r\nressive.\n&gt; He looked up at the large dragon now, seeing Tavatron comfortabl=\r\ny \nresting on \n&gt; his back, then looked back down at Foxfinger, gesturing to=\r\nwards \n&gt; Necromancer.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; If you are coming with us, then get on.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n * His voice was harsh and wet, mech-fluid already coating the \ninside of h=\r\nis \n&gt; mouth and lips.\n&gt; Dinobot didn&#39;t wait for an answer though, there was=\r\nn&#39;t\nenough time, \nfor, he \n&gt; had to get back to base and into a CR chamber =\r\nquickly.\n&gt; His own repair system was offline, and it had been since he had =\r\n\nfirst been \n&gt; hit in the side by one of the Alliance missiles.\n&gt; He quickl=\r\ny, or as quickly as he could, climbed up and onto the back \nof \n&gt; Necromanc=\r\ner, careful to make sure that he sat a good 10 feet down \nhis back \n&gt; and a=\r\nway from Tavatron. He didn&#39;t need any of her back talk now.\n&gt; Around this t=\r\nime his breaths were coming short, and Dinobot had to \nforce \n&gt; himself to =\r\nlet go of what anger he had in order to concentrate on \nbreathing.\n&gt; He qui=\r\nckly transformed into beast mode once he was on the back of \nthe \n&gt; dragon,=\r\n thinking that maybe there was a chance to slow down the \nlose of \n&gt; mech-f=\r\nluid with only that once chest wound.\n&gt; Dinobot looked at the perimeter of =\r\nNecromancer&#39;s back and then\ngot \ninto a \n&gt; comfortable position, laying on =\r\nhis stomach with his head resting \non his \n&gt; front limbs=85staring at Tavat=\r\nron&#39;s back.\n&gt; If anything, he was about ready to depart. *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n_______=\r\n_______________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Y=\r\nour Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http=\r\n://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
