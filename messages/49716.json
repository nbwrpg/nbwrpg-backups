Gatara reloads her double weapon and holds it pointed at \nthe \n&gt; Pred, forgoing the cloak to emphasize her point: &quot;Rogues don&#39;t play \n&gt; around, Predacon.  And if you&#39;re dealing with us alone, you do it \non \n&gt; our terms; time is not a factor.  Why would you be so interested in \n&gt; someone who surrendered herself after you nearly died protecting \n&gt; her?  What makes her worth anything to YOU?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The other two flank the monstrous bot, as if she needs it to \nheighten \n&gt; her already imposing appearance.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Gatara was the only Rogue of these three personally involved \nin \n&gt; that encounter, so she&#39;s the only one Flicker will recognize.  \n&gt; However, he&#39;ll probably realize that Jayde and Riekan are nothing \nto \n&gt; sneeze at either.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Back at the base:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Flicker:  LOOK I DON&#39;T HAVE TIME TO PLAY AROUND!
