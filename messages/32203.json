He tried to fly away but his head was still\nsore from the laser shot that nialed it. He kinda flew in a drunken\nstate. He landed and looked at Hot Rod. He tried to make eye contact\nwith him so he could convince him that he was thier friend and there\nwas no need to fight. He had his tail pointed at him with an Explosive\nrocket ready to go. Also he ha his lasor pistol in his arm ready to be\narmed to his hand and his wings were pointed at Hot Rod ready to fire\nanother four missiles.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt;\n&gt; The tail wrapped his legs, and he triped. He fired 4 mini-rockets to\n&gt; intercept the feather rockets. Three were destroyed but one hit him in\n&gt; the side of the head.\n&gt; &quot;Ohh, head ach.&quot;\n&gt; He right hand retracted, in its place a saw. He tryed to slice the tail.\n\n\n"}}
