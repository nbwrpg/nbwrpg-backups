She is\n&gt; quick to wisper in his ear what Tucson is up to.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sorry, forgot ya didn&#39;t know sign language.  Here&#39;s the deal, Tucson is not\n&gt; turning on us purposely, he&#39;s doing it so he can fool Magmatron into falsely\n&gt; trusting him.  It&#39;s the only way he can get around Magmatron without\n&gt; suspicion.  Pass it  along in a silent com to the others.  And play along\n&gt; with him.  It&#39;s the only way we&#39;re gonna get outa this in one piece and if\n&gt; you don&#39;t then, it won&#39;t work.  So pleeeease, try and make this work.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns to Leo Prime.  And then turns to Magmatron.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;  Hmmm, certainly a proposal worth taking you up on.  All right, Rodimus\n&gt; and Leo Prime!  There can be only ONE leader among us!  And that leader is\n&gt; ME!    You cringe like cowards!  You&#39;re afraid to face me in a fight because\n&gt; you know you do not measure up to my caliber!  None of you were trained by\n&gt; Master Yoketron, nor did you take his training as seriously as I have!  Now,\n&gt; let that mistake be your downfall!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In the mean time, he sends an internal message to the others, one that\n&gt; Magmatron can not hear.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If we are to get out of this without suspicion or death, I need you all to\n&gt; play along with me.  I am not really turning on you, it&#39;s an act that has to\n&gt; be played just right or else it will fail miserably.  I need your FULL\n&gt; cooperation on this and trust what I am about to do, even though, it looks\n&gt; difficult to trust.  Rodimus, Leo, I need you to fight me with everything\n&gt; you got, and take heart, if I fall, I understand why, and anything that\n&gt; happens to you, I apologize in advance.   We can do this, Maximals, we can\n&gt; be far better than Magmatron.  Now, time to put our plan into action.\n&gt; Remember... FULL COOPERATION FROM ALL OF YOU OR ELSE THIS DOES NOT WORK.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson roars, as he turns to Leo and the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well, it&#39;s not polite to keep your opponent waiting!&quot;\n\nAs TUSCON attempted to transmit his message all he could back was\nstatic and internal feedback. It would seem that radios and comlinks\nwere still down here in the tunnels.\n\nHowever LEO PRIME tunred to look at TUSCON, he nodded ever so slightly\nto try ant let TUSCON know that he understood what was going on.\nEvidently STRAIGHTSHOT&#39;s words were enough to give him a few clues as\nto what to do.\n\n&quot;Tuscon, you are under arrest. If you are not willing to come quietly,\nthen you will have to come the hard way!&quot; LEO frowned in looked only\nsemi-believably. He was obviously not the best of actors.\n\nHowever none of that mattered as the whole rooom continued to shake as\nfire and energy spewed itself up out of the pit, destrying the remains\nof the bridge that was over it as well destroying all of the equipment\nthat SABERBACK and MAGMATROn had placed around it. Even the stone that\nhad fell over SABERBACK himself was blown away.\n\nAll around the room vibrated dangerously as the fire and energy\nscorched the roof of the cave.\n\nMAGMATRON looked at the fire and energy and then back at TUSCON and\nthen his remaing soldiers, &quot;Retreat!&quot; he called out. &quot;We have lost\nwhat we came for, retreat.&quot;\n\nMAGMATRON began to back out twards the caves that were coming out of\nthe middle of center of the room, protected from the fire and energy\nonly because they faced outward instead of inward.\n\nSKYBYTE wasted no time in bolting, followed by the remining SHARKTICONS.\n\nEven the PREDACONS were looking at the tunnel. &quot;Skyshadow!&quot; CRYOTEK\nsaid, &quot;Leave the Maximals to fend for them selves, we have everything\nwe need.&quot; He glanced around the room. &quot;Pick up our wounded and\nretreat!&quot;\n\nThe room was beginning to heat up!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
