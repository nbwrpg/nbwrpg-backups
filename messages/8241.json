They could see the look of dispair on his face. The odds they \nwould find another body were almost none. \n\nIf only that damned Bronco didn&#39;t toss my body into the sea!, Octociz \nthought.\n\nDeep within, Brix replied.\n\nWatch it! That might have been a different me, but it&#39;s still me!\n\nI can&#39;t wait until my thoughts are my own, thought Octociz\n\nI heard that!, came the reply.\n\nOctociz muttered to himself as he continued into the Cybertronian \nFire.\n\nVulois\n\nVulois looked down at Battera, who was shivering with nerves. Vulois \nlaughed.\n\n&quot;Stand up, noble beast! Don&#39;t you see? You can&#39;t blame yourself for \nit. You had a chance to escape. If you had died, than the plan of The \nMatrix would have been surely destroyed. It was destiny that you \nsurvived Hell Beast&#39;s rath. Now come, Cybershark has already gone \ninside, so shall we join him? You too, Soundwave.&quot;\n\nVulois went to catch up with Cybershark.\n\n\n"}}
