However Trelos was now focused on his new prey.  Depthcharge ran for cov=\r\ner as the volley of shots whizzed past him, several striking him in the rig=\r\nht arm.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suddenly amid the pandemonium, Ravenchief heard some not-so-fri=\r\nendly sounds.  Even from several stories up in the air he couldn&#39;t see anyt=\r\nhing.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Depthcharge!&quot; he shouted into his radio. &quot;I have a really bad fe=\r\neling about this.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Depthcharge emerged from his hiding spot fired a few=\r\n covering shots at Trelos as he tried to slowly retreat.  Before he could m=\r\nake it to cover, he was struck several times in the back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s like he=\r\n&#39;s toying with us...&quot; said Depthcharge.  &quot;Cover me!  I need to put some dis=\r\ntance between us.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n=93GRRRRRRUUOORRR=94 Something akin to a growl and a =\r\nlow grumble\nreverberated through the buildings, echoing strangely, seeming =\r\nto come\nfrom almost everywhere. It was as if the conflict between Ravenchie=\r\nf,\nDepthcharge and Trelos had awoken something primal within the creature\nt=\r\nhat stalked the shadows.\n\nIt continued to move near silently around the bat=\r\ntle, dark optics\nwatched one of them rise into the air. For a moment it sou=\r\nght to\nfollow, but then chose to stay on the ground, =91there was more comf=\r\nort\non the ground.=92\n\n&lt;Crackle!! . . . BZZT!!&gt;\n\nThe creature=92s shielding=\r\n failed again, revealing a powerfully built\nmechanized lion. Its face, shou=\r\nlders and part of the back legs were a\npurple reminiscent of the Decepticon=\r\n of old, while the rest of its\nbody was a deeper darker purple flowing into=\r\n ebony black. It was\nlarge, fully four feet or more at the shoulders, dark =\r\nfangs protruded\nslightly from its mouth while powerful shoulders sported wh=\r\nat appeared\nto be grenade launchers!\n\nWith a shake its head it leaped up on=\r\nto fallen debris and . . .\n\n&lt;ROOAARR!!!&gt;\n\nThe very air seemed to vibrate wi=\r\nth the resonance of the decibels.\nWide optics looked around as his tailed s=\r\nwished. It was as if it was\ndeclaring itself king of all that it surveyed a=\r\ns it looked down and\naround.\n\nFrom its chest still emitting a deep rumbling=\r\n growl.\n\nOOC: Again there is no clear IFF signal. The creature registers as=\r\n\nCybertronian, but not as Predacon/Decepticon or Maximal/Autobot.\nHowever t=\r\no Trelos the creature may/might (up to you) smell/detect\nsomething like Myr=\r\nmidon, although he looks changed. There are no\nmarkings or sigils anywhere =\r\ndepicting any factional affiliation. Oh,\nand Myrmidon was thought to have b=\r\neen killed during that last push\nwhen Cyclonus was acting as a herald of Un=\r\nicron and attacking the Ark.\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
