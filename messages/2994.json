As you wish.&quot;\n\n* With that she had then looked off towards Gangon but then had not found \nhim there, she looked around and then finally spotted him entering some \nstrange ship. Was he leaving? Why?\nShe looked at him with a bit of concern in her optics but then heard him say \ngood bye before the ship suddenly took off. Then...he was gone.\nBrightBlade looked towards the sky in which she had seen him disappear into \nand then sighed, her almost missing him already.\nNow she was partnerless and alone, as she had been always before now. It was \na feeling that suddenly made her feel a little sad, not being able to hear \nGangon&#39;s comment&#39;s on her looks any more and his wacky ways.\nShe then turned towards the Maximal ship and look at it, the evening glow \nbehind her. It felt different now being alone like this, but a feeling in \nwhich she would have to get used to now that her partner was gone. Just \nhoping that Gangon would keep his word and return to see her again, \nsomething that she looked forward too.\nBrightBlade then looked over at Hell Beast.*\n\n&quot; I await your next commend, My Lord.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
