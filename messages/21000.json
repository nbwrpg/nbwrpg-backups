She&#39;s looked up Dinobots file, just to see what she could find out \nabout him.\nBelieve it or not, she was facinated about him. She never had any intended \nfeeling or anything. But it&#39;s kinda hard not to notice the only other \nvelociraptor in the same groupe as you are.\nIt also just facinated her about how he could seem so emotionless and such.\nIt made her edgy around him, but she really didn&#39;t know him the more she \nthought about it.\nBut she didn&#39;t like Dinobot, not in the way Prowl obviously thought. But she \nreally didn&#39;t know if she liked him really either, it&#39;s hard to when all you \nknow about them is what you read in files.\n\nIron Raptor bumped up against Prowls shoulder for a moment, hearing in his \nvoice that he hadn&#39;t liked the subject.*\n\n&quot; I don&#39;t like him, Prowl. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking? I just wanted to \nknow a bit about him.&quot;\n\nIRIS: &quot; Yeah, I guess I can back up that comment. But I never said that you \nliked him to begin with.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor growled towards Iris*\n\n&quot; Well, you seemed to be leaning towards that direction a little bluntly&quot;\n\nIRIS: &quot; Slag! I couldn&#39;t even imagin you two together! To the pit! Just \nimagin the kids out of that coupling!! No. I gotta abmit, even feather head \nhere is better for you then that Pred with a bad &#39;tude!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor rolled her optics but couldn&#39;t argue. Dinobot was way too mean \nfor her to begin with, and she just wondered how Tavatron could manage to be \nround him almost 27 7.\nBut that wasn&#39;t what mattered now, it was the merging which was the main \nsubject.\nShe leaned towards Prowl a bit more before laying her head on his \nshoulder-plate.*\n\n&quot; You should know that you&#39;re the only one I could ever want.&quot;\n\n* And with that she snuggled her head a bit into his neck, but they had work \nto be done, and eventually get her into her robot mode again.\nBut she was ready when he was.\n\nIris never was one for sentiment, almost making a sickening wound as she saw \nthe couple.\nShe sighed*\n\nIRIS: &quot; Anyway...as soon as the code is disabled just let your spark exit \nyour chest, then the energy from that should make her spark exit as well, \nand then they should begin to merge. Simple as that.\nBut you have to be relaxed, Prowl. And you mind has to be concintrated on \nthis task. Otherwise you&#39;re asking for disaster.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
