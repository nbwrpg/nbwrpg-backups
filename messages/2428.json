passage way\n&gt; &gt; underground to the real base..(then why did the build a fke\n&gt; base and why didn&#39;t you say they built a underground base until\n&gt; now)..the real base, looking nowhere near\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; glamorous as the fake one, not even half complete..... &quot;well, the\n&gt; real base\n&gt; &gt; can stay underground, they can&#39;t find it now...&quot; Dracona\n&gt; said..(there were bots everywhere on the ground i think\n&gt; someone would see you)..Plintissa\n&gt; &gt; climbed through a secret chute where no one could see and grabbed\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Radicons in her tentacles,(so she can shoot with her hands filled\n&gt; and still there are 5 radicons there is a small chance that plintissa\n&gt; could carry them all) firing at BH, she ran around in a\n&gt; confusing\n&gt; &gt; pattern and disappeared..(i didn&#39;t have a chance to shoot at\n&gt; plintissa)..one Radicon was missing..... &quot;great, that\n&gt; idiot\n&gt; &gt; Fighter is still up there!.....&quot; Dracona said...plintissa sighed,\n&gt; her and\n&gt; &gt; dracona went back up (where no one could see)(bots everywhere so i\n&gt; think they could see) and searched for\n&gt; Scamrock, who\n&gt; &gt; was still battling some of the attackers.......\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt;\n&gt;

You had\n&gt; Scamrock\n&gt; grab\n&gt; &gt; them,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which would cause them to explode because of impact.  That was\n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt; mistake\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by doing that.  Also, I read in a few posts that the People&#39;s Base\n&gt; &gt; exploded,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t see the actual post where it exploded, and I never saw\n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &#39;sister&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; , but evidently since I didn&#39;t get the e-mail, you can&#39;t blame me)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Oblitercons (Oblitertron)/Nemesis\n&gt; Enforcer/Anubis/Hades/Unitron/Koga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shuko/Scattershot:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oblitertron raised both of his arms in triumph, splitting into\n&gt; five\n&gt; &gt; seperate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pieces, each transforming into a robot, the Oblitercons landing\n&gt; in\n&gt; a line.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dark One: &quot;Alright, the base is crushed, this...Dracona&#39;s base is\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ruins...her forces are destroyed.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Breakdown: &quot;I think Nemesis called for reinforcements.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pyro: &quot;Then let&#39;s fire a few shots off and pull back to\n&gt; re-energize.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hiss: &quot;Yes, let&#39;s.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Scavenger raised his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at\n&gt; Scamrock,\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other Oblitercons charging off towards the Alliance base, not\n&gt; really\n&gt; &gt; caring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about finishing them off, leaving Nemesis and Scattershot alone\n&gt; with the f\n&gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Newcomers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nemesis Enforcer fired two optic blasts at the People&#39;s base&#39;s\n&gt; rubble,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; turning, a clawed fist sending him slamming into a trunk.  Anubis\n&gt; grabbed\n&gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by the neck, kneeing him in the face twice, backhanded him with\n&gt; claws.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Scattershot fired off twenty explosive bullets down randomly at\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Radicons,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deciding he really didn&#39;t enjoy them without a bomb, he&#39;d have to\n&gt; go bumb\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some off other people.  Raising an &#39;eyebrow&#39;, he fired off ten\n&gt; shots,\n&gt; &gt; Anubis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slamming into a tree, the tree hitting the ground.  Landing to\n&gt; the\n&gt; ground,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his side aching from previous wounds, he didn&#39;t spot Unitron from\n&gt; behind,\n&gt; &gt; six\n&gt; &gt; &gt; laser bolts tearing into the Alliance member&#39;s back, sending him\n&gt; crashing\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ground.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Excellent, Unitron.  Let&#39;s move out!  Hades, grab Anubis.  It&#39;s\n&gt; time to\n&gt; &gt; get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rejuvinated.  The people here shouldn&#39;t hinder our plans, their\n&gt; base is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed.&quot;  Unitron ordered, Hades picking Anubis up, the\n&gt; Newcomers\n&gt; &gt; heading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back towards their downed ship to recieve repairs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/10/_/_/_/959480510/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/10/_/_/_/959541014/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
