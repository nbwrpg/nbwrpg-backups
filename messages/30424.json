She looked like the pit, but she felt a lot \n&gt; better.  She walked down the halls, leaving a small trail of \nfluid.  \n&gt; She made it to her quarters and got cleaned up.  She smiled, &quot;I \nthink \n&gt; thingsss will work out jussst fine.&quot;  She called up FZ,&quot; Oh great \n&gt; leader, what do you have for Diamond to accomplisssh today?&quot;\n&gt; She knew that you caught more flies with honey than with vinagar, \nso \n&gt; she used a sweet tongue to get FZ to give her a job to do.
