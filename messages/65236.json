He began to look for place=\r\ns to hide his traps.\n&gt; \n&gt; This traps were based on a laser trip-wire.  When=\r\n the laser beam \nwas\n&gt; crossed, several launchers would shoot darts attache=\r\nd to wires.  \nThese darts\n&gt; would then shock the victim until they were unc=\r\nonscious.  He would \nplace on\n&gt; beam about 14 cm above the ground, and anot=\r\nher beam about chest-\nhigh.  The\n&gt; emitters would be hidden on on each side=\r\n of the room, and of \ncourse the\n&gt; beams were invisible.\n&gt; \n&gt; The launchers=\r\n would be anchored to the ceiling in a manner that \nall angles\n&gt; around the=\r\n trip laser would be covered.  He had enough launchers \nthat\n&gt; whether she =\r\nwalked through the beam or ran through the beam, she \nwouldn&#39;t be\n&gt; able to=\r\n avoid the trap due to the sheer number of darts being \nlaunched from\n&gt; eve=\r\nry angle.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Kratos please step inside the room so that no one will =\r\nsee \nthem while\n&gt; they are setting up the trap.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 2/16/06, airly20=\r\n00 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kratos:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Let&#39;s do it, she will ar=\r\nrive soon&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, rm2kmidi &lt;kraftlos@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Celeron arived at Spire&#39;s quarters.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Well, I t=\r\nhink it&#39;s time to set our plan in motion.
