As for getting rid of it, that I have no idea.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &quot;But how would we get rid of it after we don&#39;t need it anymore?  \nAfter creating this blackhole, we will have to dispose of it.  May be \ncreate it near a spatial instability, trigger a transwarp jump, and \nwhisk it away to parts unknown.  We have to preserve the timeline as \nmuch as possible.&quot;\n&gt; He refilled his mug, and returned to his seat.\n&gt; &quot;Where are we going to procure a high density sphere of metal?&quot;   \n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She grinned. &quot;A virus isn&#39;t a bad idea.&quot;  She drank from her \n&gt; cup. &quot;However, we have to come up with a virus that his programs \n&gt; can&#39;t counteract. Which is near impossible. Second, get someone to \n&gt; carry the virus to him, then download it to his mainframe \nprocessors. \n&gt; Good luck.&quot;  She sipped from her cup, and went to get a \nrefill. &quot;Hmm, \n&gt; here&#39;s a thought. Perhaps since there aren&#39;t any black holes in \nthis \n&gt; sector, we could make one. All we have to do is to make a small \n&gt; sphere of metal and launch it out into space. Then, we give it a \n&gt; large electromagnit and throw it into full power. With a large \n&gt; explosion from some powerful raw energon, it will give it enough \n&gt; force to collapse in on itself and poof, a blackhole will emerge. \nThe \n&gt; catch is to create it so far out that this planet won&#39;t be \neffected.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
