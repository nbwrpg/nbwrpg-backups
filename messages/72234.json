Upon running them over and updating his\n&gt; personnel records, he paused quietly.  &quot;I assume that if LORD HYDRAS is\n&gt; going to make a deal with the MAXIMALS, we should take this opportunity to\n&gt; attempt to achieve some of our secondary objectives.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pausing, &quot;We should send a team to our old base for a salvage operation, and\n&gt; keep some of our new personnel in reserve, given I assume the MAXIMALS are\n&gt; not fluent wtih..  Myself, DINOBOT, or BLACKARACHNIA.  While the main unit\n&gt; of known personnel goes to the parlay, we can have our other teams achieving\n&gt; secondary objectives and ating as a strategic reserve should it become\n&gt; necessary.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; And also to keep an optic upon TARANTALUS and CRYOTEK.  Glancing over to\n&gt; HYDRAS and SKY SHADOW for confirmatino of his suggestions then or secondary\n&gt; orders.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a slight nod from SKY SHADOW as he listened to VICE GRIP,\nthere was an assesing look from the Fuzor commander as he talked, much\nlike a chess player might do when sizing up a new opponant that was\nabout to seat itself accorss the board.\n\n&quot;That might be a bit premature.&quot; SKY SHADOW said after a moment, he\nvoice calm and reasoning. &quot;The base the old base was detonated by a\nbomb that was kept inside for just a purpose.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hydras believes that his chambers have survived the destruction.&quot;\nSKYSHADOW glanced at HYDRAS and then back at VICE GRIP, &quot;And that may\nvery well be true, but I seriously doubt that much else of the base\nhad surived the explosion.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - HYDRAS - In the meeting room&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Another Prime&quot; hissed anoyed the predacon commander when he\n&gt;  watched Leo Prime and added &quot;Can you tell me why one of yours...\n&gt; maximals was attemping to contact one of my predacons? &quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was an awkward pause from LEO at first before he spoke, &quot;My\nsoldiers may have been a bit . . . overzealous in their desire to\ncontact the Predacons.&quot; He said, kind of sidestepping the issue and\nhoping that HYDRAS wouldn&#39;t ask further.\n\n&quot;The reason for this communication is that we have to meet and discuss\na few matters.&quot; LEO said in a blatant effort to move the conversation\naway from the first topic.. &quot;It relates to the temporary accord that\nTuscon had been trying to set up between the Predaons and the Maximals\nto find out what is going on with the Dinosaurs.&quot;\n\nIn the background CRYOTEK was watching the conversation although not\nin direct view of the camera, there was an interested sparkle in his\noptic as the conversation opened.\n\nMeanwhile down in the cargo bay several decks below the meeting room\nTARANTULUS was also listening through the link from BLACKARACHNIA.\nThere was a slight cackle as he opened a heavily encrypted comlink to\nsomeone off ship, he began speaking in low tones with a slight cackle.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
