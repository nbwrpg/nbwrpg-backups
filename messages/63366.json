However, she could\n&gt;   understand security concerns. She nodded, &quot;Very well.&quot;\n&gt;   She was getting a little annoyed about how things had been since she\n&gt;   was imprisoned in her cocoon. She was rather hoping the Maximals would\n&gt;   be only a small resistance and the Predacons be ruling the galaxy by\n&gt;   now. Her face plates showed a minor irritation as she felt her\n&gt;   disappointment in the Predacon process so far. However, she seemed to\n&gt;   give a small smile as she knew that since she was now here, things\n&gt;   would truely change for the better.  After all, her programs made her\n&gt;   a very accomplished killer and skilled planner.  She felt that she\n&gt;   would be a great asset to the Predacons.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
