Or it might even scan Dinobots DNA in Razor\nClaw. there would be quite a bit of explaining to do if anyonev started\nasking questions.\n\nRazor Claw sat up straight when adressed by Ice, &quot;Chief of Security is a\nfine cover mam.&quot; he was there to follow her orders as Veratis had\ninstructed. He wasn&#39;t comfortable using her name yet, at least not in this\ntype of situation.\n\nLunarpine recieves the clearance to land so they land.(Logo posted the\nlanding already.)\n\nThe pods door opens and the three bots emerge. Lunarpine first, Then Ice,\nand Razor Claw comes last. &quot;Lunarpine, Reporting for the meeting as\nrequested, this is Ice and Razor Claw. May we be directed to the meeting?&quot;\nhe was more nervous now then when he landed. &quot;Watch yourself Wing, we&#39;re not\nout of trouble yet.&quot; he thought to her reaffirming her suspicions that\nthings wouldn&#39;t be as easy as it seemed.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m looking out for us all Dearheart&quot; Ice returned the thoughts and\nconfirmed that she wasn&#39;t taking this lightly.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, December 01, 2000 9:47 AM\nSubject: Re: Sorry logo I gotta go.\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She smiled nervousely.
