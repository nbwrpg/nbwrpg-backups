It \nwarned the Tripredacus present at the base.\n\nComputer: Weapon fire reported. Weapon is not cybertronian in nature. \nTwo locations match the weapon. First one is to the south of this \ncontinent. The second one is in the bay on the first continent.\n\nTyrael: Mmm... Vok, maybe? We shall see later... But we need some \nnames for geographic positionning. Computer, label first continent as \nTrionia, the second as Betarsia and the bay on the first as Visitor&#39;s \nBay.\n\nComputer: Aknowledged.\n\nTyrael: Good. (He turned to the warrior he hadn&#39;t met for long) Spike \nis it? Go to CR. I will need you to go and investigate these alien \nlife-forms.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tyrael turned a dark stare to his second. He had heard some things \n&gt; while battling the Predacons that did not fit quite right in the \n&gt; picture, but he would let it pass... for the time being.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: There you are, Shadow Star. You shall help Talon preparing \n&gt; base defenses. Now that we are known, we are a prey. We wouldn&#39;t \nwant \n&gt; to be eaten without biting back would we? Go to CR after you are \nboth \n&gt; done.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; SS landed and went to meet Tyreal and the others.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; SS:  Reporting for duty SIR!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tyrael looked at Spike and Talon. He hadn&#39;t yet met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spike, formally at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; least. He pushed down his anger and took a deep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breath. Even though he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; did not truly breathe, the techno-organic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; arrangement of his body made \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this motion relaxing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tyrael: You must be one of our new warriors. I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Major Tyrael. Please \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tell me about you. Talon, can you install\n&gt; &gt; &gt; auto-defenses on the base? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You are free to go to CR right after that. I want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this to get done \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with as soon as possible.
