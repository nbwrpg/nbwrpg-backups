Just when I sit down to get into the battle Yan has to pull out. \nThis isnt over!\n\n    Megatron watched the Predacons pull out, or retreat, or do whatever they \nwere going to do. As he recived the information on thier base status, he was \ntempted to follow them, and crush them durring there brief confusion. But, \nlooking at the smoldering woods and his hurt predacons he put that thought on \nhold.\n    &quot;Return to base. Victory is ours once agian. Next time we meet with \nKillfests bunch, they will not live to see another battle. It will end next \ntime.&quot; He said, looking off into the distance, some what entranced.\n\n    As for the Energonians, they watched them go. The foursome landed and \nregrouped briefly. Putnam spoke first: &quot;we will follow them! They will not \nget away with such a dishonorable escape.&quot;\n    Akron nodded. Odiphious, with a solem face reminded them of Ominous with \nthe girl, but Putnam put to rest his worries. The four of them turned towrd \nthe fleeing Predacons and pressed after them, taking to the air for a hasty \npursuit. All the while they would send blast after blast at them.\n\n"}}
