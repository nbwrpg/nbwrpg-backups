Strangely, \neach called to Double Punch via comlink asking where the attackers were.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch yelled, kicing at the ground.  Looking wildly through the \nscanners, he found the People&#39;s Group all around.  Bringing more autoguns \nonline to open fire on them, the shields starting to weaken and a few \nautoguns not in the protection of the shield being destroyed, he replied to \nthe three Predacons who had contacted him, telling them the coordinates.\n\n---\n\nInjector opened his hatch, seeing some of the People&#39;s group.  Firing a \ndouble blast of optic lasers randomly at the People&#39;s group, he fired off \nthree stinger missiles off at more random targets. \n\n---\n\nManterror opened his hatch slightly, firing off two ion disks at the People&#39;s \ngroup randomly.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee opened a hatch, firing three stinger missiles from both of his \nstinger missile launchers at Scamrock, two optic blasts firing randomly.\n\n---\n\n&quot;Idiots!&quot; Double Punch yelled, activating internal defenses, not aware that \nthe counter assaulting Predacons would be protected by shields.\n\n============\n\nBreakdown awoke slowly, cursing.  Kicking Hiss, who began to wake up.\n\n---\n\n&quot;What?!&quot; Hiss yelled, standing slowly.\n\n---\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s get to the Predacon base.  The Maxis betrayed us!&quot;  Activating his com \nas they both ran, Breakdown spoke with Zardus.  &lt;Zardus, this is Breakdown, \nwe were jumped by the Maximals!  They must&#39;ve took us for dead.  We&#39;ve been \ndouble crossed, and those stinking Maximals are doing the crossing!  We&#39;re \nheading to the Pred base!&gt;\n\n"}}
