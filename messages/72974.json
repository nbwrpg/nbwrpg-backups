With a quick raise of his\n&gt; head he points his snout at the direction of the voice.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;OPTIMUS!  IT&#39;S ME, TUCSON!  TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE AND I WILL COME FOR YOU!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns to Leo.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I appreciate your efforts, Leo but rescuing Optimus is something I must do\n&gt; alone.  I sense his pain and anguish, and I can not allow it to continue.  I\n&gt; MUST SAVE HIM NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.  The old dragon lived up to his\n&gt; promises and to honor his gift of spirit he has given to me I must do the\n&gt; same if I&#39;m to honor him justly.   I owe him the same as he has given me.  A\n&gt; chance at life, and a chance of freedom.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns around and at a steady lope, he follows Prime&#39;s voice.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Leo, NEVER RUN FROM WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN!  AND DON&#39;T LET ANYONE TELL YOU\n&gt; THAT YOU CANNOT DO WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THIS PLANET AND EVERYONE\n&gt; WHO LIVES HERE!  SHOW MAGMATRON WHAT YOU&#39;RE MADE OF!  AND SHOW HIM THAT NO\n&gt; MATTER HOW MISERABLE HE TRIES TO MAKE IT, NO WAY IN THE NAME OF PRIMUS WILL\n&gt; HE GET WHAT HE WANTS!  YOU CAN DO IT LEO PRIME!  YOU CAN DO IT!&quot;. I KNOW YOU\n&gt; CAN!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With his strong words of encouragement, Tucson goes from a lope to a full\n&gt; draconic sprint .\n\nLEO PRIME looked at TUSCON as he moved swiftly down the hall. He\nturned to BIG CONVOY as he walked up.\n\n&quot;Was I ever that full of myself?&quot; LEO said.\n\nBIG CONVOY chuckled, &quot;That and then some. I can remember the story\nthat Lio convoy told me, and I was around for some of it myself.&quot;\n\nLEO nodded, &quot;Let&#39;s go before he get&#39;s his aft blown off.&quot;\n\nBIG CONVOY nodded as he, LEO, WINGCALIBER, and SANTON all assumed\nbeastmode and began running down the tunnel as well.\n\nMeanwhile CRYOTEK just shook his head, &quot;Let&#39;s see what they&#39;re up to.&quot;\n\nSKYSHADOW glanced back at CRYOTEK, &quot;Of what value is this to us this\nis a Maximal fight now?&quot; His face was calm yet there was a crafty\nlight in it.\n\n&quot;If that is truly Optimus Prime, then I want him dead.&quot; CRYOTEK said,\n&quot;And if it&#39;s not, then I want to be down there to take advantage of\nwhatever the situation is.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
