He figured \nthat she couldn&#39;t swim because anybody who has swam has loved the water and \nwants to again (CyberShark only knew swimming bots, and I am a swimmer on a \nteam). He neared the ocean and transformed to Beast Mode. He let himself fall \ntoward the ocean. When he hit it felt wonderful to be back. He swam around \nfor a few minutes and then headed toward shore.\n    Nearing the shore he transformed back to robot mode so he wouldn&#39;t get \nbeached. He walked out of the water and sat on the beach. He looked at his \ntail/hand, it was useless for swimming in robot mode. But he could manage to \nteach someone.\n\n(In reality I haven&#39;t taught anyone how to swim, I&#39;ve just helped, so bear \nwith me.)\n\n"}}
