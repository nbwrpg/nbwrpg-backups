I&#39;m not really sure what Dark Scream&#39;s position and\n&gt;stuff is right now.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; He&#39;s off behind a hill, some distance from the CF. Nobody at the\n&gt; &gt; CF can see him right now. He&#39;s with most of the Stunticons,\n&gt; &gt; Megatron, some wannabe Megatron ( =P ), Switchblade,\n&gt; &gt; Beastbox, Cyclonus. Nightstrike, Scourge(?), and Razorclaw (who\n&gt; &gt; is arriving soon). Oh, and Fireblade will get there soon too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Icedemon and Yan, I think that Autofire and Divebomb would have\n&gt; &gt; found Dark Scream &#39;bout now. Yan, do you want to post with\n&gt; &gt; Autofire? =)\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
