She frowned as he told her to go take a nap. &quot;But I&#39;m not \ntired.&quot; She watched him leave the room. She sighed and transformed \ninto polar bear mode and walked over to the corner. She layed downa \nnd rested her head on her front paws. She was bored and restless.  \nShe closed her eyes and thought about maike the chair lift up off the \nfloor. She opened her eyes and saw it floating. She smiled. She \nconcentrated and help the chair up, then she picked up a pen and \nstarted to write something while on paper while it was at the \ncomputer console. She had the pen going, writing her thoguht, the \nchair in the air. She wanted to see that else she could do. She \npicked up a small flash light and had it turning on and off. She \nsmiled. &quot;Yes,  I think I shall have this ability mastered in no time \nat all.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis felt himself tremble as he was lifted off the ground. &quot;Put \nme down,\n&gt; I&#39;m busy here.&quot; He reached back to give her a tap and noticed she \nwasn&#39;t\n&gt; there. He looked back and saw her concentration. &quot;What are you \ndoing?&quot; he\n&gt; transformed to bat mode and started to flap his wings. he flew \nhigher then\n&gt; behind her to land. &quot;You&#39;ll never gain control if you keep \nplaying.&quot; He&#39;d\n&gt; suspected this possability since she started moving her \nprotoform. &quot;Now go\n&gt; take a nap and I&#39;ll get back to you in the morning.&quot; Hetransformed \nback to\n&gt; robot mode stepped back to his computer and went back to work.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Such disrespect for her creator humph.&quot; he thought, &quot;Lady Hawk \nwould&#39;ve\n&gt; never shown such disrespect to me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; In the makeshift training room Lunarpine and Foxfingers traded \nbarbs and\n&gt; tags as they worked. A call came through over the link. &quot;Time for a \nlittle\n&gt; Rejuvination.&quot; Veratis&#39; voice chimed in a commanding way to the two \nbots.\n&gt; Lunarpine stopped running as he listened. Foxfingers lunged forward \ntrying\n&gt; to take advantage of the wolfs vulnerable state. Lunarpine spun and \ncaught\n&gt; the fox in mid leap. &quot;Nice try Fox, to bad I&#39;m just a little to \nsmart for\n&gt; that. Foxfingers transformed back to robot mode, &quot;Look down.&quot; \nLunarpine did\n&gt; as the fox requested and saw a detonator attached to his \nwaist. &quot;Tag Wolfy&quot;\n&gt; the fox taunted &quot;I win.&quot; Lunarpine dropped the fox pestered by the\n&gt; detonator. He pulled it off and tossed it back to the fox. &quot;Not to \nbad, I&#39;ll\n&gt; know better next time.&quot; he left the room and proceeded to the \nquarters that\n&gt; Veratis had assigned to him. Foxfingers returned to his and retired \nfor the\n&gt; night.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis stretched his wings again as he stepped in his chamber. \nHe&#39;d been\n&gt; working far to much for an old bot, he needed rest badly, He&#39;d have \nplenty\n&gt; of time to work in the morning. He looked back toward the lab \nremembering\n&gt; the samples Foxfingers had brought from the maximals. He still \ndidn&#39;t know\n&gt; about the fox&#39;s adventure in the Predacon base. He thought about \nLady Hawk,\n&gt; wherever she was she was in trouble or she&#39;d have returned by now.\n\n\n"}}
