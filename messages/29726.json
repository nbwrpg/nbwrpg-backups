Autofire \nhad been first created as a bounty hunter in the days of the great \nwar, and served as a mercenary for both Autobots and Decepticons, as \nwell as later hunting down bots and bringing them in for a reward. He \nhad gotten to earth on a mission to follow Adrax, and had been buried \nunder an avalanche while fighting him. Autofire was later restored by \nthe Vok, his body adapted to this planet&#39;s conditions. However, after \nbeing buried under the ice, he could no longer feel the Vok presence \nin his head.\n\nAutofire&#39;s eyes look over the cannon. This bot looked like a smaller \nversion of the Decepticon commander, though Autofire had never \nactually met him in person, untill now.\n\n&quot;Megatron, hmm..&quot; he says, the chain gun flipping back into his \nwrists. He doubted Megatron could muster the power to even punch at \nhim right now. &quot;I&#39;m Autofire. What are you doing here?&quot;\n\nHe wondered if Megatron had been informed of those times when Autofire \nhad been hired by the Decepticons. If he had been, then he might \nremember him.\n\n(We didn&#39;t talk about them knowing each other, Jer, but its up to you)\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megatron looks up , very suprised to find a robot, and not a \ngenerator. He\n&gt; was aiming his rifle at my head, thought Megatron, but with his \nenergy\n&gt; levels so low, it didnt matter if he died at the hands of an enemy \nrobot,\n&gt; or enegron exaustion. This was his last chance, to survive. He \nforced\n&gt; himself to his feet, every gear in him straining to support his \nweight,\n&gt; when his energon was so low. Ignoring his screaming computer warning\n&gt; systems, he addressed the robot. &quot;I, huhhhhhhh, am Megatron, hhhh \n*cough\n&gt; cough*&quot;. He finished weakly, he then with all of his might raised \nhis\n&gt; fusion cannon, to let the uknown robot get a good look at it, but he \ndid\n&gt; not aim it at Autofir, and even if he could aim it, he probably \ncouldnt\n&gt; even fire a lo\n\n\n"}}
