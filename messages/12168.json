The grappling gun pokes out from \nhis mouth as he sees the little bots scurrying about on the surface. This \nplases him, because he could swoop down and possbile eat one of them.\n    Something in the distance shines in his eyes. Its one of the Ark&#39;s \nsupport beams. It stands there mocking him. A challenge. If he were to knock \nthe support down, the entire front of the Ark would collapse.\n    &quot;AH, I have foreseen your demise Maximals! The Ark shall be destroyed!&quot; \nHe said, his body coiling and curving like a serphant.\n    Finally he swooped from the sky, his body ridged like a missle that would \ndestroy the Ark. His grappling gun sent a spitfire of bullets hailing down on \nthe warriors below as he got closer to the Ark. \n    Now, be neath the body of the vessle, he saw the support beam. It \nstrained under the weight of the ship. Most of the others had already fallen \nor been destroyed. This was the conerstone to the Ark. And now it was Adrax&#39;s.\n    He coiled his long spiked body around the support, and then began to \nsqueeze like a snake would squeeze its prey. Harder and harder he could heat \nthe iron graon under the pressure. Adrax began to jerk his body, pulling the \npole in a different direction. He jerked agian, and agian. The pole began to \nbecome crooked. Seeing at what he had done, he slipped off the beam and took \na look at it. Now it was bent severly. Just a little more work and it would \ncollapse.\n\n    Black Aracnia shighed as she took the Comm unit to talk into once agian. \nShe picked up on Atma. &quot;Listen, Atma. We need good warriors like yourself. \nWithout you we could have never repelled the attack from the Maximals \nearlier. In fact, thats why were attacking the Ark now. To punish them. We \nare better than them, you are far superior to them Atma. Please dont leave. \nCome home, to where you belong.&quot;\n\n"}}
