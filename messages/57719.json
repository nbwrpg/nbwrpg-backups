Although it wasn&#39;t anti-grav or self propelled he decided he could manage.  He pulled the unconscious pilot off the floor an dropped him onto the cart, (Celeron is half his size or less).  He squeezed the cart out of the door and into the hallway which was still pitch black.  He ran back into the room to find a flashlight he had see earlier.  He duct-taped it to his head and turned it on.  Then he wheeled the cart slowly up the corridor.\n\nHe reached the Captain&#39;s quarters after about a twelve minute hike.  He wrung the doorbell.\n\nBZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz.\n\n&quot;Captain?&quot;\n\nBZzZZzZzZZZZZZZZZZZ!\n\n&quot;Captain open up....&quot;\n\nBZZZzzzz...\n\n&quot;WHAT&quot;\n\nThe had door slid open while Celeron wasn&#39;t looking.  He returned his gaze to the Captian.\n\nHe motioned with his head to the injured crewmen.\n\n&quot;Ok, he needs to get in my CR chamber ASAP.&quot;\n\nCeleron wheeled the cart inside the room and the door sealed behind them.  They were still a little paranoid since several prisoners were still unaccounted for.\n\nThe captain picked his officer up and lay him against the back wall of the chamber, then pressed a button.  The chamber seal shut.  The captain was still not comfortable with the Celeron&#39;s presence so he decided to make a descrete exit.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nGet advanced SPAM filtering on Webmail or POP Mail ...
