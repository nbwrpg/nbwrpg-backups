The lesser outposts ha=\r\nd been\n&gt; &gt; easily snatched and a lot of Bushidos had even jumped ship to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; cooperate. Good. The bigger one still had to be secured more\n&gt; &gt; complete=\r\nly, but progress was showing at a lot of places. Wherever the\n&gt; &gt; Iron Skul=\r\nls were underrepresented, though, they had been easily\n&gt; &gt; thwarted. But on=\r\ne battle was still running.
