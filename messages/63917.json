If they had not, he could still use his title to get out. If \nthey had...\n\nHe skidded to a halt, his claws scratching imperceptibly at the metal \nfloor. As he stopped, he adjusted his cape-like wingsand put on a \ndignified look on his face. He then went out, going for the small ship.\n\nThe two guards did not see alarmed. Good, he thought, or not.\n\n- Ah, Councillor Azure, the first said, how are you?\n\n- Fine, fine, Azure said. I&#39;ve come to take a look at my ship. There \nwas something amiss with the communication systems when I arrived, and \nI think the shield generator got knocked a bit.\n\n- Well, it sure was a pretty rough flight, eh? That comet came closer \nthan we&#39;d have thought.\n\n- Indeed. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me...\n\n- Go ahead, sir.\n\nAzure laughed at them mentally. They hadn&#39;t been warned, and he was \ngoing to escape. He got in the small shuttle and started the engine.\n\n- CommSys operational, he told the control. I&#39;d like to take her for a \nsmall ride outside, see if there&#39;s anything else wrong with this bird.\n\n- Roger that, Council 2, you&#39;re clear to go.\n\nHe thrusted the ship casually, not letting any of the emergency he \nfelt transpire and make people notice. As he passed the doors, he let \na sigh out.\n\n- Now, turn back and get into the hangar again, Azure.\n\nAzure turned, and saw her, pretty but unfortunatly his enemy.\n\n- You know I won&#39;t do that, Balistica. You know I&#39;ve finished what I \ncame here for.\n\nShe held a blaster to the back of his head, ready to shoot.\n\n- Don&#39;t make me do this, Councillor. The Maximals still need a \npowerful ally such as you. Don&#39;t make things worse, please...\n\n- I am sorry...\n\nHe swiftly dropped a cryogrenade he had produced. The explosion was \ndevastating, as it froze not only Balistica, but also the shuttle \ncontrols. The ship started going wild and it entered a wormhole. When \nit came out, it was freefalling in an atmosphere.\n\n- What the...? Azure said. He started the mayday signal and braced \nhimself for impact. The shuttle touched down in sea, but it did not \nsink. It skimmed over the waves like a car tumbling on a road at high \nspeed, until it finally met a beach where it stopped.\n\nAzure, stunned, made his way out of his seat. He saw what had happened \nto Balistica, and felt pity. She was demolished, but still alive. She \nwas in stasis however, and he did not have anything to help her out\n\n- I truly am sorry, my dear. They had been hiding this from me and I \ncould not let it go as such. I will get you back, though. I swear it \non my Predacon spark.\n\nHe left the battered ship and tried to look for anything out there.\n\n\n\n"}}
