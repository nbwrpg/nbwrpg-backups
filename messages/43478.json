REmember \nyou two I am a council member and I am getting tired of all your \narguing.  If you two want to argue make it private emails.  If either \nof you reply to this email in Nbwrpg I will give you a punishment.  \nIf you two argue agin in nbwrpg I will punish you.  Dewboy, you say \nyou have all these major ideas, Send them to me and Rdahl.  Also \ndewboy, you can&#39;t just have your characters arrive in maximal city \nwithout posting them entering maximal city.  That means you have to \nwait for someone to let you in if you are not on the visiter list and \nI didn&#39;t see the post having your characters let in Maximal city.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Although asking fox to make a cartoon of the RPG would prove to be \n&gt; itneresting it would be rather difficult as I have noticed that the \nbeggining \n&gt; posts are no longer there and you would have to contact players \nlong since \n&gt; gone on being able to use charachters they created. Plus we really \ndont have \n&gt; an episode type format so scripting the show would be even harder.\n\n\n"}}
