Can anyone (anyone at all)\n&gt; tell me just one instance when the Alliance broke a treaty violently.\n&gt; People claim that the Alliance is treacherous all the time, but just\n&gt; for fun, I&#39;d like to see if anyone can think of a time when the\n&gt; Alliance broke a treaty by backstabbing or something.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Necromancer sneers at Shockaract aiming the tip of his gun at the\n&gt; tip\n&gt; &gt; of the tanks gattling gun, &quot;Iron Raptor trusts to easily.&quot; They\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; close enough now for either one to hit the other. &quot;I&#39;ve seen to\n&gt; much\n&gt; &gt; treachery from your kind to believe that a cease fire will ever be\n&gt; &gt; honored.
