Oh, and Alloran, if \nyou really want Eagle Eye to die, I&#39;ve got a really cool death scene \nplanned but I need to have control of him. Is it okay?)\n\nVulois\n\nVulois felt the schorching heat of the ring. What an evil this being \nis! For centuries he must have been studying the Black Arts, and I \nthought I could beat him with a few months?!? Who am I joking. It \nwill all die here now. I&#39;ll die. Child will die. Eagle Eye just \narrived; he&#39;ll die. Nemesis will assume there are more in the main \ncave and will kill Windrazor Terradive and Afterburner. That will \nonly leave Battera and Cybershark. Battera is faithful, but a tad \nnieve and scared about responsibility. I felt that Cybershark had \nbeen doing some fighting, some strange enemy that would have had to \ndo with something in the future for me. No one left. All over.....\n\nSuddenly Vulois felt the burst of energy. He turned around to see \nChild mumble something, and collapse. Than Vulois realized it: Child \nhad given him his power. One shot to defeat the greatest evil in the \nworld. Vulois stod up, and brushed the flame away with a wiff of his \nhand and gazed at Nemesis. No more evil. Nothing left to lose. All \nout power.\n\n&quot;Time for you to burn...&quot;\n\n(Shomin, don&#39;t respond yet. I need Allorans okay and than I need to \nfinish my post.)\n\n\n"}}
