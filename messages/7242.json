He jumps back up, inoring the pain as a laser catches \nhim across the chest.\n\nStriker turns toward Hell Beast. Seeing Hot Rod clear of the Predacon tyrant, \nStriker takes out his missile launcher, firing off a missile at Hell Beast.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus growls as shots hit him, finally ducking behind a boulder to avoid \nmore. He jumps from behind the boulder, firing at Jackle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster ducks under a shot, several shots hitting him, noticing the battle \nbetween Hell Beast and Hot Rod. That was one brave Maximal there.\n\n&quot;Get to a CR chamber!&quot; he yells to Hot Rod, also taking out a missile \nlauncher, firing a missile at Gremlin.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRex spins around as Serpentor&#39;s shots hit the massive Maximal in the back. He \ngrowls, bringing up his heavy-fire rifle and firing a few shots at Serpentor.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen dodges Serpentor&#39;s shot. Jumping away from the newcomer and \npulling out a charge, he throws it at Hell Beast.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Cybertronian Fire&#39;s missile launchers both swirl to aim at Hell Beast, \nfiring off two energy-seeking missiles at him.\n\nThe laser bateries fire at their previous targets (Gremlin and Jackle).\n\nThe EMP cannons, once again recharged, take aim, firing at Hell Beast.\n\nThe shots fired by Unitron hit the shields, barely regestering on the energy \nreadings.\n\n"}}
