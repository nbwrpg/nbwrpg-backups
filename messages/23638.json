There was indeed a possible attack on the Cybertronian \nFire. He opens his comm to Sharpedge, since the bot was in charge of \nDeemos&#39; group at the moment.\n\n&quot;Sharpedge,&quot; he says into the device, &quot;Redirect your troops to the \nCybertronian Fire. There&#39;s going to be an attack on it. Other Alliance \nmembers are on their way.&quot;\n\nZardus contacts the Lavacons, telling them to engage the Cybertronian \nFire.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAstral arrives at the scene after the chase takes off, looking around \nat his team. Fenox was getting to her feet.\n\n&quot;Allright, what&#39;s the situation?&quot; He asks her. Fenox explains about \nthe battle.\n\nAstral nods, recieves Zardus&#39; message. &quot;We&#39;re gonna follow them then,&quot; \nhe says to his group and powers up his boosters, &quot;We&#39;re attacking the \nCybertronian Fire.&quot;\n\nThe Lavacons fly off toward the Cybertronian Fire, except for \nRecklessa, who was fighting Rex.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot frowns, watching the short battle and then the chase. He \npowers up his jetpack and flies after them. His missile launcher was \nready to kill.\n\nPerndabot smiles. He loved battle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRex dodges under a shot from Recklessa, firing back. Recklessa dives \nunder the shot, seeing her team flying off toward the Cybertronian \nFire.\n\n&quot;Gotta run, see ya!&quot; Recklessa says to Rex as she takes off after \nthem. The Maximal growls and follows after, firing and mostly missing.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ takes off after Dark One and SixShot, his jetpack on full burn. He \nactivates his comm.\n\n&quot;Be careful when we reach the Cybertronian Fire. Feline gave us the \ninformation on the defences, and they&#39;re fairly strong,&quot; he tells the \nrest of the Alliance members there, sending them a summary of what \nFeline had collected (Weapons: EMP batteries, laser batteries, missile \nlaunchers).\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProto runs out of the Cybertronian Fire and flies up. The shields \nblink for a second to let him through, and he takes off toward the \nchase.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler spinns around as he recieves the transmission.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go, battle time!&quot; He says to SlashStrike, exiting the \nCybertronian Fire and arming his rifle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster runs to the bridge, sitting down at one of the comps.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s the situation?&quot; He asks Chordate.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Punch/Nemesis Enforcer/Unitron/Scattershot:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Punch looked at the scanners, seeing the chase after Windlord made \nby his \n&gt; comrades.  He also noticed they were heading for the Cybertronian \nFire.\n&gt; He opened up a comm. link to three people.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This is Punch, possible attack on the Cybertronian Fire.  Nemesis, \nUnitron, \n&gt; and Scattershot, you can fly, so you can get there fastest.  Head \nthere \n&gt; immediately.&quot; Punch ended the link as the three robots responded by \ntaki\n\n\n"}}
