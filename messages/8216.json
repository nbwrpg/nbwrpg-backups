After all, most of the bounties ARE \non Predeacons.&quot;\n\nChoran, his body scaly, yellow and orange and green, his teeth long, very \nsharp looking (not to mention deadly looking), and many.\n&quot;I agree with Predator, Imprisoner.  We should go to the Maximals and get the \nlocations, then turn around and shoot them if necessary.&quot; his voice sounding \nlike he was talking in water.\n\n&quot;Fine!  If you&#39;re going to twist my hand so hard.  Scans showed four crashed \nships.  One with a Maximal transwarp signature, the other Autobot.  That&#39;s \nobviously the Ark.  And there are two Predacon, one is Hell Beast&#39;s ship.  \nThe other, I have no idea.&quot;\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s head to the Ark.&quot; Choran said in his gurgly voice.\n\n&quot;Alright.&quot; Imrpisoner said followed by a nod, the bounty hunters heading for \nthe Ark.\n\n"}}
