I don&#39;t\nknow about Owlhawk, but based on the number of posts\nI&#39;ve seen baring Flickers name he&#39;s been developed\nalot.  I&#39;d be perfectly happy giving them up, in fact\nI have another idea for a char that will either be the\nundisputed coolest char I have ever made, or be\ninstantly banned in a unamimous vote by the council. \nWhich brings me to question two.\n\n2.
