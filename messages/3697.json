Wepons are drawn and tempers are short. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast yells above the comotion ::: Stop! All of you! We are allies\n&gt;and we must work together agianst the Newcomer-\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Ominous Prime took his only chance and nailed Hell Beast in the back of\n&gt;the head with an energy bolt. Hell Beast fell to the ground limp. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine, Gremlin, and Jackle spun around and began to unload rounds on\n&gt;Set, Ra, and Ominous who had taken cover behinde several boulders. With the\n&gt;way Marine was leveling off the rocks with a few placed missles, they \n&gt;wouldnt\n&gt;have cover for long. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine ::: You scum, you shoot men in the back because you are cowards!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Gremlin, holding a large pulse laser assult riffle makes the rocks and\n&gt;nearby trees look like swiss cheese because he is shooting so much. Soon,\n&gt;smoke fills the arena. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Set ::: Damn it! We cant take on those three, there huge!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Ra ::: I think its time to form Dark Messhia!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Set ::: Yes! Do it! NOW!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Ra, with a bright light glowing from his body leaps into the air and\n&gt;floats there waiting for his commrads to combine together. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~`\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Transanulas screams in pain as Darkmouse bites into his leg. He points,\n&gt;pulls the trigger, and a single shot digs itself into her shoulder. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Transanulas ::: Damn you vermine! You will pay, and so wil lthe Ram!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: He begins to fire off random shots at Ramulus. :::\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
