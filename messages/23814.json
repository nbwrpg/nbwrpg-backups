Looking down at the little fuzz ball as he \nstretched out to the contours of her hand. He was cute, she had to admit.\nBut now wasn;t the time to get a gushy. There were serious things to be done \nnow, and number 1 was get back to base with her fiends in tow.\nBut then Iron Raptor heardProwls thoughts on what she had said, her eyes \nnarrowing as she heard his commant on the idea.*\n&lt; And how am I supposed to take it? Like Snadow Cat and Snow Tech handled \nthe new of the advancing threat? I KNOW what the Alliance can do,Prowl. I&#39;m \nnot stupid! I just said that they could handle it until we got there, and \nthat&#39;s not long. So quit getting worked up. Being over anxious can only lead \nto defeat.&gt;\n\n* Iron Raptor looked towards Prowl for a moment with a look that basically \nbacked up her thoughts.\nShe was suck of being second guessed, and she wasn&#39;t stupid enough to not \nknow that theCybertronian Fire and the Maximals under her command were under \nattack.\nBut Iron Raptors hands closed around the small bundle of life in her hands \nas he began to wriggle.*\n\n&quot; They probably aren&#39;t. I detected a ship less then 100 clicks from \nhere,new. Just landed. Probably where they&#39;re from.&quot;\n\n*Motioning with her head towards the crashing which had grown closer.\nBut then Iron Raptor watches as both of her friends disappear into flight \nand the sky...cocking an eye-brow.\nWasn&#39;t it less then 2 min ago that they were the ones who were telling both \nProwl and herself to leave...and now they were leaving them behind?\nIron Raptor sighed. Those two could be so weird sometimes.\nBut then a sound reached Iron Raptors ears as her friends disappeared, a \nsmall hissing noise that was there and went away.\nShe looked down at her hand where the small cat was laying, looking up at \nher with big eyes and licking her hand.\nSeeing the embarrasmant in his expression.*\n\n&quot; You little bugger....&quot;\n\n* She knew what he had done, and it wasn&#39;t very pleasent.\nMust be the food Snow Tech and Shadow Cat fed him.\nIron Raptor doesn&#39;t move as Prowl comes up to her and slides an arm around \nhim, still slightly peeved at him for his last commant.*\n\n&lt; I know....&gt;\n\n* She adds, simply standing sill and clutching the small fuzz ball to in her \narms, ready to leave.\nBut she was sick of all these attacks, and as soon as she got the Maximals \ninto order after this, they would turn out to be a force that the Alliance \nwould think twice about attacking next time.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
