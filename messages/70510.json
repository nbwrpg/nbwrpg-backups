Obvi=\r\nously the mech had seen some hard times and was alarmed by his pressense.\n\n=\r\n&quot; My name is Tucson Prime, I&#39;m an Autobot commander, well just became a com=\r\nmander.  I&#39;m very good friends of Optimus Prime, and comrade to Rodimus Pri=\r\nme.  Here, see?  I have the Autobot insignia.  I won&#39;t hurt you, I promise.=\r\n  I&#39;m actually willing to help you, if you&#39;ll let me.&quot;\n\nHis voice definitel=\r\ny matching that of Optimus Prime, yet just a slight different than the lege=\r\nndary commander of the Autobots.  His body language matches that of Optimus=\r\n, as does his gentile demeanor.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Car=\r\nroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson makes his way ov=\r\ner to the unconcious figure. Being an Autobot, he couldn&#39;t resist the urge =\r\nto help someone in need. He kneels down, yet cautiously looks around before=\r\n doing anything, and also remembering that it was not wise to move an injur=\r\ned person, especially if they had any unknown fractures. His Sonar equipmen=\r\nt scans the figure for fractures and injuries.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hmmm... Strange.. I=\r\n better stay with this person to see if I get any signs of life.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; H=\r\ne rides the rail car, never leaving the figure&#39;s side.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Tuscon get&#39;s=\r\n close to the figure it began to stir. Tuscon&#39;s scans\n&gt; show light damage t=\r\no the figure&#39;s systems, but that its repair systems\n&gt; have been taxed hard,=\r\n evidently it had been much more heavily damaged\n&gt; but self repair circuits=\r\n had brought it back to a more balanced state.\n&gt; \n&gt; The figure began to sti=\r\nr, perhaps its proximate sensors were reacting\n&gt; to Tuscon&#39;s presence. The =\r\nfigure looked to be an older male, perhaps\n&gt; with some sort of ground based=\r\n vehicular form based on its shape and\n&gt; configuarion.\n&gt; \n&gt; The figure sudd=\r\nenly sat up and slid into a corner, &quot;Who are you?&quot; he\n&gt; said in a raspy but=\r\n definitly male voice. The hum of a laser gun could\n&gt; be heard as he pulled=\r\n a weapon out and aimed it at Tuscon, &quot;Get back,\n&gt; or I will fire!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ou=\r\ntside the sounds of metal on metal could be heard as the creatures\n&gt; still =\r\nseemed to be active somewhere outside the Magna-railcar as the\n&gt; car itself=\r\n still made its way along its track.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
