You are \nfast too, so we will chew them up just enough make it eaier for our \nbig guns. \n\nBlackfang was startled to receive orders from her. She clearly knew \nwhat she was doing. He took his energy shotgun out.\n\nBlackfang: Roger, Ma&#39;am.\n\nRagnar came out of the base with a bristling of both his large lasers \nand a salvo of mini-missiles. He aimed no one in particular, but he \nknew his long-range firepower would at least make them think twice.\n\nRagnar: Kup! Let us regroup! Katya seems to have thrown honor out of \nthis fight. She will hit them while they are far so we can finish \nthem.\n\nBlackfang and Katya went running around, covering in the trees near \nthe base. They would wait a moment to see who was the best target.\n\n\n"}}
