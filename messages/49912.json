An expression\n&gt; of childlike \n&gt; wonder crosses her face as she sees the outdoors for\n&gt; what she thinks \n&gt; is the first time.  But she&#39;s a little confused,\n&gt; because it all \n&gt; vaugely reminds her of something ... something that\n&gt; occasionally \n&gt; flashes through her dreams ...\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Flicker wants to rush over to her, but realizes it\n&gt; would not be for \n&gt; &gt; the best, so he begins unloading quickly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot;\n&gt; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gatara activates a remote control as she lands,\n&gt; decloaking the \n&gt; ship \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and allowing Flicker his first good look.  It&#39;s\n&gt; not nearly as big \n&gt; &gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a battleship, but the latter would have a rough\n&gt; time fighting the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; former - Rogue Star bristles with assorted\n&gt; weaponry, not all of \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cybertronian in origin.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Personally, I don&#39;t care about the rubber duck.\n&gt;  You&#39;ll see her, \n&gt; &gt; all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; right,&quot; she tells him, &quot;but she&#39;s staying right\n&gt; here until \n&gt; exactly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; half your ship&#39;s cargo is aboard Rogue Star. \n&gt; Riekan!  Jayde!  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Torin!  Let&#39;s go, already!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The two males tramp out of the ship, with\n&gt; Phoenix between them, \n&gt; &gt; head \n&gt; &gt; &gt; down.  She&#39;s a mess - she hasn&#39;t seen the inside\n&gt; of a CR chamber \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; long time.  There&#39;s no sign of the other Rogue.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Well, where&#39;s Jayde?&quot; Gatara asks, irritated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Last I saw, she was in her sister&#39;s room,&quot;\n&gt; Torin explained.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gatara rolls her eyes.  &quot;That explains it. \n&gt; Alright, let&#39;s get \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff unloaded.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
