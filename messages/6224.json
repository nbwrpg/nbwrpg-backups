LIVE!!!!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m back from my camping trip, everyone. I&#39;ve just read 300 emails\n&gt; &gt; while talking to alot of people, so I might be confused on some\n&gt; &gt; things. Please forgive me if I am, I&#39;m still burned from camping.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, KSLawdogg has given me controll of all his Maximal and Alliance\n&gt; &gt; characters until he returns (if anyone wants, I can forward his\n&gt; &gt; email).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Zardus/Nemesis Enforcer/Hiss/Breakdown/Scattershot/Punch::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With a flash, Zardus apears in the forest, falling to his knees,\n&gt; &gt; panting. He gets up, looking around.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nemesis,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;What&#39;s the situation?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Hiss grins, taking a step forward.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I think I will!&quot; he snarls at Iron Raptor, walking up to the bars,\n&gt; &gt; his gun aimed at her, &quot;You foolish raptor you will never escape and\n&gt; &gt; we will destroy your maximal,&quot; he says, not realizing the danger he&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hiss, back away. She might get dumb and start biting,&quot; Breakdown\n&gt; &gt; orders, the rest of the Oblitercons holding their guns ready.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Nemesis Enforcer looks up as he recieves Zardus&#39; transmission.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The Maximals threatened to attack, Zardus,&quot; he replies, &quot;But we told\n&gt; &gt; them that we&#39;ll kill the Maximals if they d-&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The scanner beeps, reporting an object hitting the shields, and\n&gt; &gt; interrupting Nemesis.

Tell Dark One and his gang to get out there and kill\n&gt; &gt; someone. You two stay and guard the prisoners.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Punch and Scattershot nod, setting off toward the brig.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Zardus turns around, continuing toward Panzertron&#39;s ship.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Delta, could you meet me at my location,&quot; he says into his comm-\n&gt; &gt; link, &quot;And bring the cloaking device with you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5533/13/_/_/_/963188363/\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free, Unlimited Calls Anywhere!\n&gt; Conference in the whole family on the same call.\n&gt; Let the fights begin!
