Instantly images of \npeace, happiness and The Matrix came into his mind. The powers of one \nblessed touching another was an incredible surge of energy. Tears \nstarted streaming off Vulois&#39; face. He pushed the Spark ack into \nChild&#39;s body. He than wiped the tears off his face and looked at \nChild.\n\n&quot;You have proven yourself. You are truly what you say you are. I \nnever really doubted what you had in mind for your powers. It&#39;s your \nfather that I am most worried about. I don&#39;t know if he truly wants \npeace. He might be using you. I shouldn&#39;t make accusations like this, \nbut you need to be warned Child. Herald could very well be the man of \npeace he says he is, or he could be something more sinister. I rushed \nfooly ahead into an alliance without knowing who I was dealing with. \nYou have been given into my custody Child for training, and until I \nknow the truth about your father, I must keep you from him. If you \nare to be trained, than he must not have you. If he is what I&#39;m \nsensing, than he could use you to your own advantage. Now you can \nhave a choice. You may leave the embassy now and return to your \nfather, or stay with me and learn all you can do, but may not see him \nagain until I know the truth about him.&quot;\n\nHe than turned to Windrazor.\n\n&quot;Windrazor, I believe that you believed in honour, and than you loved \nSoundwave. But peace and honour are two different things. When we go \nth the alliance base, than you will prove youself. We will see if you \ncan keep your anger in check. Now Child, I need a decision.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
