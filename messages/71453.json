Tell me when the repairs are done&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from CYCLONUS, his optics glittering thoughtfully. &quot;Of\ncourse sir. However with the exception of your quarters and a few\nother small sections of the ship we are largely done. We cannot get\nthe ship to fly without a new fuel flow regulator, but everything ese\nis in readiness.&quot;\n\nThere is a beep as CYCLONUS and HYDRAS get a message from SCOURGE who\nis manning the sensors and security station on the bridge. &quot;We are\npicking up something strange, and I am not sure of what to make of it.\nIt looks like a large herd of reptiles of all sorts moving across the\nopen plains.&quot;\n\nThere was a pause from SCOURGE for a moment and then he continued, &quot;I\nhave a sweep watching it now from a distance and it is massive.\nHerbavores, carnivores, omnivores all running together.&quot; There was\nanother pause from SCOURGE, as if this next part confused him. &quot;Above\nthem is floating a strange . . . I don&#39;t know . . . From what the\nsweep reports it looks like a dinobot but it registers as a both\nPredacon and Decepticon. We can&#39;t explain it.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
