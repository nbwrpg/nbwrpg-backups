She figured she \ncould \n&gt; dig with her sword, as her fireballs were simply inappropriate for \n&gt; the rock, but then an idea hit her.\n&gt; \n&gt; She concentrated and slowly, the slope she was on became darker \nand \n&gt; darker, filled at first with shadow, but then with deep ink-like \n&gt; darkness. She could see nothing, but thought she knew what was \ngoing \n&gt; on. Even the sound could not escape.\n&gt; \n&gt; When she let go, exhausted, she marvelled at what she had done.\n&gt; \n&gt; A small opening in the rocky soil, one that tunnelled some feet \ndeep \n&gt; in the ground, was now before her. All she had to do was to blow \nit \n&gt; up to get more space.\n&gt; \n&gt; She sent the fireball and was soon propelled backward as the \n&gt; explosion blew the rocks and dust up in the air. She smiled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dreadplague: Good! (She turned to her pred colleagues) Hey, Preds, \n&gt; how are you doing?\n\n\n"}}
