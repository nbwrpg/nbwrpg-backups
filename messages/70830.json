We got enough power here to take down Hydras if we put our spa=\r\nrks to it.&quot;\n\nRat Trap grins.\n\n&quot; Oooooh A big brain storm is hitting my tiny=\r\n processor... When in doubt, send the little guys in ta do the dirty work. =\r\n I could go with Cheetor, and like I did before, sneak into the small space=\r\ns and have myself a little fun... Ya know, cross a few wires....  Technical=\r\n difficulties...&quot;\n\nNight Shift steps forward.\n\n&quot;Or try ta connect with thei=\r\nr central computer system from here&#39;n ya know, infiltrate without physciall=\r\ny infiltrating....&quot;\n\nRat Trap bounces with excitement.\n\n&quot;Ooooh, I like that=\r\n.  No one gets hurt, and we might just possibly lower the enemy&#39;s resistanc=\r\ne...&quot;\n\nTucson narrows a brow.\n\n&quot;That might just work..

And according to =\r\nCybertronian lore, only the Autobots are capable of doing the powerlink. No=\r\nt the Decepticons or the predacons. I wonder if this holds true for the Max=\r\nimals as well.. Imagine, if you guys could merge into one formidable warrio=\r\nr.. Anyway, right now, it&#39;s more important that we fight fire with fire. Bu=\r\nt it&#39;s like Tucson says.
