It is time to find our brothers.&quot;\n\nDirge glanced at Chopshop and then back at Dirge, &quot;That is good.&quot; he\nsaid, &quot;However Lamia will accompany you.&quot;\n\nVenom looked as if he was about to object when Dirge cut in, &quot;This is\nat Marauder&#39;s orders. Unless you want to explain to him why you cannot\nfollow his orders.&quot;\n\nVenom glanced back at Dirge and then at Lamia. He grunted and then\nturned around and began walking toward the back of the room, where\nalready a large door was beginning to iris open.\n\nChopshop chuckled and then jogging to keep up with Venom, &quot;Your\ncomming right?&quot; he said to Lamia.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
