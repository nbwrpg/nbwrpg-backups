Quickly they d=\r\nescend to the surface of the \n  moon like some dark plague upon an unsuspec=\r\nting victim. Many seem to \n  disappear beneath the surface, while others sc=\r\nour the surface, moving \n  to and fro over the apparently dead surface of e=\r\narth&#39;s moon. \n\n  Two of the shadows break away from the rest, shift into a =\r\nhumanoid \n  form and land. &quot;Is this the correct place? If he was here we wo=\r\nuld \n  have found him by now!&quot;\n\n  &quot;Yes.&quot; Said the other figure, his figure =\r\nis sleek and agile, purple \n  framed with silver highlights. &quot;Have patience=\r\n. No doubt he has just \n  hidden his signature. We know where to look thoug=\r\nh.&quot;\n\n  The first figure nodded as the two continued on, his form looking \n =\r\n winged as the shadows played over his blue and white form. \n\n  Before long=\r\n they came to a large set of doors, set into a \n  mountainside. Doors const=\r\nructed in such a way that they would be \n  hidden if they were not standing=\r\n open as if beckoning the duo inside. \n\n  Without a glance the larger purpl=\r\ne figure stepped inside, even as the \n  winged one hesitated. &quot;Come.&quot; Said =\r\nthe first in calm confident \n  tones. &quot;He is here. I can feel him.&quot; The oth=\r\ner followed, looks of \n  both fear and confidence fighting a war on his met=\r\nallically bearded \n  face. \n\n  Great vaulting caverns greeted the two as th=\r\ney walked; ancient stone, \n  unworked and yet beautiful in its own way. &quot;He=\r\n is here, Vorpal is \n  here.&quot; The winged figure&#39;s voice is confidence and a=\r\nlmost aggression \n  as he spoke.\n\n  &quot;Yes.&quot; Said the other figure, his steps=\r\n measured and confident. &quot;As \n  Unicron had already told us.&quot; Quickly they =\r\nemerged into a large \n  chamber filled with dim lights and probing shadows.=\r\n Moving to the \n  center of the chamber, to the front of what could only be=\r\n a throne \n  they stood finally before the presence of Vorpal, Leader of th=\r\ne \n  minions in this area. \n\n  &quot;My lord.&quot; Said the larger purple armored fi=\r\ngure as he knelt. &quot;I am \n  Cyclonus.&quot; He gestured behind him as the other a=\r\nlso followed \n  suit, &quot;and this is Scourge. We have been sent by Mighty Uni=\r\ncron to \n  aid you in the eradication of all his enemies.&quot; Cyclonus bowed h=\r\nis \n  head. &quot;What are your orders?&quot;\n\n  OOC: Please note that this is NOT th=\r\ne Cyclonus and Scourge that \n  previously appeared on this website. I note =\r\nthat they have been \n  absent since about 2001. So you can think of these a=\r\ns clones or total \n  reformats of them from Unicron. But since they have be=\r\nen gone for so \n  long, and they are characters that belong to Hasbro or wh=\r\no ever, I \n  hope no one objects to their use. They will not have the memor=\r\nies of \n  those that already appeared. I can rename them if it makes it eas=\r\nier \n  for the group as a whole.\n\n\n\n   \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0010_01C81086.A1952F70\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- Network=\r\n content --&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3199&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEA=\r\nD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;OOC: Great entrace :)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;IC:&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;In a corder Nightstrike looked the new comers with \na =\r\nmix of distrust and&nbsp;surprice.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 0p=\r\nx; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid; MAR=\r\nGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV \n  style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; FONT: 10pt arial; =\r\nfont-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; \n  &lt;A title=3Dsupercyclonus@... \n  hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3Dnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n  href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV=\r\n style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Tuesday, October 16, 2007 3:44 \n  =\r\nPM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; The Minions stir=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;OOC: Please keep in mi=\r\nnd I am using the minion description as is &lt;BR&gt;posted \n  on Wiki. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I=\r\nn the depths of space, on the far side of earth&#39;s moon, \n  hidden from &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nsensors and prying optics a small but powerful warp distortion \n  &lt;BR&gt;appea=\r\nrs for a moment and then vanishes without a trace, leaving \n  &lt;BR&gt;something=\r\n behind =85. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Swift and agile, shadows appear around the \n  dark and=\r\n silent moon; &lt;BR&gt;sensor ghosts, appearing for a moment, but then gone \n  a=\r\ngain before &lt;BR&gt;they can be locked on to.
