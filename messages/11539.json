He was about to take a step forward, but shook \nhis head.  He kneeled down, splashing some water in his face, the feelings \ngoing away for a cycle.  But he could tell they were already coming back, and \nthey were even stronger.\n\n---\n\nFirearm looked to Skulletron.  &quot;Get out of beast mode you idiot!&quot; he yelled.  \n&quot;And apprehend the Pred.&quot; he ordered, taking a pair of energy cuffs out, \ntossing it in Skulletron&#39;s direction.  Rookie.\n\nRex frowned at Bright Blade.  He was skeptical, as usual.  Keeping his weapon \nraised, he heard Firearm yell, and looked to Skulletron.  &quot;GET IN ROBOT \nMODE!&quot; he ordered, still aiming at Bright Blade.\n\nSmokescreen sighed.  Walking over to Bright Blade, weapon raised, he reached \na hand out to her.  &quot;Take my hand.  Get up.  Please.  If you do what we say, \nyou won&#39;t be hurt.&quot; he smiled.\n\n"}}
