I have to be the guy to send mails for the spiders, I suppose.\n&gt; They&#39;re just another creature living on this world, and are way too\n&gt; beneficial. I mean, if it&#39;s not neccasary, then why kill them? I&#39;ve always\n&gt; tried to be kind towards animals in my posts, and not to harm them somehow,\n&gt; because I&#39;m nothing but soft at heart. I&#39;m a vegetarian, you know. Anyway,\n&gt; sorry for even bringing it up, but I knew nobody else was going to say\n&gt; anything about all of the spider violence in this RPG, so I knew that I\n&gt; would be the first.

She felt like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; herold\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self again.  She came to a small pod which appeared to have been there\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long time. She looked around, but didn&#39;t smell any other bots near by.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tranformed into bot mode and checked out the pod.
