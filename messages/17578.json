You have to rewrite the \npost.)\n\nStarscream\n\nStarscream fell to the ground as the clones converged on him. With \nInferno&#39;s blasts, the mech fluid started pouring out of his shoulder. \nHe saw KitKat coming in the distance. Some back up. But then he saw \nthe worst thing possible: Megatron had come to fight us himself. He \nwas firing at the oncomers! He needed to be stopped. He screamed at \nthe Lavacons.\n\n&quot;Get that one over there!  That&#39;s Megatron!&quot; He struggled to his \nfeet, bleedgin mech fluid, and gazed at Inferno and the clones. He \norganized a plan in his head. This plan should take out all the \nclones, and hopefully take out Inferno himself. He thought for a \nsecond about telling him to come to their side, but he remembered \nfrom his studies Inferno&#39;s uncontrollable loyalty to the &quot;royalty&quot;. \nSo he had to go with his plan. He pulled out his grenade launcher, \nand fired one at the farthest drone on the left and one at the \nfarthest drone on the right. He was hoping it would kill them, and \ningure the other two, so they would be right for the plicking. He \nneeded to distract Inferno though, so he turned to Jet mode and went \nto ram him head on.\n\n\n"}}
