Train Wreck and Arrow were drug outside. Train=\r\n Wreck suddenly lurched out and hit Blender. Stronghold was hit by Arrow, w=\r\nho had escaped. Stronghold and Blender chased Arrow and Train Wreck into th=\r\ne jungle. Stronghold struggles with Train Wreck. Arrow is hit so hard by Bl=\r\nender he is put into stasis lock. Train Wreck is beat senseless by both of =\r\nS.A.B. Inc. (Stronghold and Blender Incompany.) Train Wreck tries all of hi=\r\ns submissions but Stronghold and Blender always save each other. Train Wrec=\r\nk is held in the air by Stronghold. Blender laughs. Train Wreck is almost d=\r\nead, his mech fluid is flooding the jungle and is almost drowning Arrow. Bl=\r\nender pops a spinning saw blade from his forearm and slams it through Train=\r\n Wreck. Stronghold drops Train Wreck and laughs. Blender reaches down and s=\r\nnaps Train Wreck&#39;s neck.
