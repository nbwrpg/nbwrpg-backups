Getting up, he fired off \na blast from his sonic blaster at Firearm&#39;s left side tank treads, rolling \nout of the way of Brix, watching him fire like a mad man, his back now \ntowards Firearm.  \n\nPredator went to beast mode, firing off a single grenade at the area where \nFirearm&#39;s cannon begins to extend from the top half of his tank mode.\n\nChoran pulled out a missile launcher from subspace, a blast from Brix sending \nchunks of tree hitting against his left arm.  Raising his launcher, he fired \noff a rocket at Brix&#39;s back.\n\n=======\n\nKoga Shuko yelled, a few bullets hitting his scaly side.  Running into the \nArk, he picked up Ramhorn, using his as a shield, putting a knife to his \nback, where his spark would be if he stabbed forward all the way, and put his \nlaser rifle to the back of his head.\n&quot;Back off!  Or we execute him like the Maximal pig he is!&quot;\n\nHades raised his missile launcher, a photon charge slamming him into the \nbattered hull of the Ark, a metal plate snapping off and falling to the \nground.  The Newcomer raised his missile launcher, firing a single rocket off \nat Hot Rod&#39;s pelvis.\n\nAnubis ducks, several bullets striking his left arm, leaving cracks in his \narmor.  The Predacon fired off a rocket at Rhinox&#39;s chest.\n\n---\n\nUnitron entered the run-down bridge of the Ark.  He took out two grenades set \ntoo explode on impact, throwing them into the bridge, jumping out, the \ngrenades going off.  Unitron then ran for the engine room, laughing.\n\n===\n\nSerpentor yelled, shoulder blasts knocking him back a few feet, digging into \nhis left chest.  Raising his plasma rifle, he fired off three shots at \nStriker&#39;s abdomen.\n\n"}}
