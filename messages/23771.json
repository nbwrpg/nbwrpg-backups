He didn&#39;t think it was wise to assume \nthat, but she was the commander here. However, last time the Maximals \nfought the Alliance, there were a few casualties on the Maximal side. \nProwl also knew that Kluster wouldn&#39;t have sounded like that if this \nwasn&#39;t an emergency.\n\n-You&#39;re taking the Alliance attack way too lightly, love,- he thinks \nto Iron Raptor, -There are three confirmed Gestalt groups in the \nbattle already, all fighting for the Alliance. Oblitertron nearly \nkilled me with just one attack. If all the gestalts have that power, \nthan this battle is going to be barely won at best.-\n\nHe didn&#39;t add his thoughts on the worst-case scenario, but Iron \nRaptor could easily pick them up.\n\n&quot;If they track you to the base, then there is a chance that they \nengage the Alliance,&quot; Prowl says and the frowns, &quot;Unless they&#39;re with \nthe Alliance or something.&quot;\n\nProwl watches the two cats fly off. He walks up to Iron Raptor and \ntries to slide an arm around her. -I just recieved a transmission \nfrom Arcangel. Sounds like they need us back there.-\n\nProwl frowns, looking around the forest. What did these new things \nthat had scared the slag out of Snow Tech and Shadow Cat want? Why \ndid the Alliance have to choose now to attack? Why was the sky blue? \n\n(Ok, he didn&#39;t think that last one, it was just something that looked \ncool to put in)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
