With a touch of a button the top slid closed over her,\nand quickly enough lights began to change colors.\n\nEnergy was infused into the pod as spark energies themselves were fed\ninto lamia, suffusing her body with power and energy. Information also\nwas passed to her, tactics, history, data streams of all sorts.\n\nDirge looked at the read outs with satisfaction, all was going well.\n\nAll too quickly the sequence began to come to a close, as the energy\nfeeds completed their cycle. The information being fed to Lamia\nfinishes as her body has been rebuilt with far more sophisticated\nweaponry and skills.\n\nWith a click the cover of Lamia&#39;s pod click, hisses and then began to\nslide backward.\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: I will write you within the next day or so Airly with some of my\nthoughts for the upgrades.
