It was a good thing he made some time to explore the\n&gt; ship, or otherwise he would have some trouble finding it, which would\n&gt; make this sub-commander look bad.\n&gt;\n&gt; He opened the room. The lights came on automaticly, which he thought\n&gt; was a neat trick. He walked over to a seat with multible monitors,\n&gt; varing in sizes in front of it. It had a device below the last row of\n&gt; monitors that looked like a keyboard. He rested an arm on the chair\n&gt; and looked at the monitors. He noticed someone on the external\n&gt; monitors.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Uh-oh.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It was Scorponok.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike jerked up. &quot;Auto-guns, target unit Scorponok an&#39; fire!&quot;\n&gt; he commanded. The external auto-guns turned onto Scorponok&#39;s position\n&gt; and fired multible times on  him.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
