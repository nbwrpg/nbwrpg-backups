Slowly both heads lean down to \nlevel with him about 15 feet from him. And then without warning the \nright head launches a big blast of flame at him before the left head \nshoots a large ice beam at him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Hot Rod/Cleder/Rixer/Forrior/Blyer/Firearm::\n&gt; \n&gt; As Shockwave&#39;s shots ranged down, all the bots scattered.
