Now that he was safely=\r\n on his feet, he could transform into his vehicle mode and does so readilly=\r\n, gently opening his driver&#39;s side door for Vestige, and lowering his left =\r\nwheels down to where the old Autobot could get into him easier.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If yo=\r\nu ask me, I think we&#39;ll get there a lot sooner of I take to the wheels inst=\r\nead of my feet. You can drive me to where we need to go, I don&#39;t mind. And =\r\nsometimes, trust just comes from the heart. And a heart that trusts, is a h=\r\neart that&#39;s compassionate, and a heart that feels compassion is one that ha=\r\ns true power. Nothing can overpower that, nothing. That&#39;s what I keep telli=\r\nng everyone back at Autobot Headquarters. It doesn&#39;t matter if you have pow=\r\nerful weapons, if you don&#39;t have what truely matters, then you have hardly =\r\nanything at all. You have more than that to go around old friend, I can fee=\r\nl it. Now, let&#39;s get you to your repair chamber. Oh, if you feel weak, just=\r\n let me know and I&#39;ll take over.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He waits for Vestige to get in.\n\n&lt;NEW=\r\n&gt;\n\nVestige spryly lept into the seat inside Tuscon&#39;s cab. He closed the\ndoo=\r\nr and took a moment to look around, glancing at the different\ncontrols that=\r\n Tuscon had. &quot;You look like something I have seen before,\nbut I can&#39;t place=\r\n where.&quot; Vestige look confused for a moment, as his\nvoice trailed off thoug=\r\nhtfully.\n\nAfter a moment he shook it off. &quot;We have to go that way.&quot; he said=\r\n\npointing down the hall. The hall had gotten a little darker, as if the\nlig=\r\nhts had been turned down a notch or two, but the way ahead was\nstill clearl=\r\ny visable.\n\nVestige lay a hand on Tuscon&#39;s steering wheel as he placed a fo=\r\not on\nhis accelerator, &quot;I don&#39;t know how much more time we have . . . I . .=\r\n\nI . . have, so we have to go.&quot; Vestige&#39;s voice was already getting a\nlittl=\r\ne shaky, but he swallowed it as he tried to engage Tuscon&#39;s\nengines to star=\r\nt them moving.\n\nOutside the vehicle the lights continued to slowly dim and =\r\nthe\nscraping noises were getting louder and more insistant. It began to\nsou=\r\nnd like metal blades sliding along steel shelled amor and in the\nbackground=\r\n, almost imperceptable at first a slight hum could be just\nbearly heard - w=\r\nhere it was coming from was difficult to tell.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
