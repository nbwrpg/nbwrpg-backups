Even though Prowl had changed \nsince \n&gt; Mantle last saw him, Mantle could still recognize him through \ntelepathy. He \n&gt; stretched out a hand for a handshake.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hello Prowl.&quot; He said. &quot;Its been a while since we lost \ncommunication with \n&gt; you and Striker.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Mantle knew that Cinder was standing behind him, and he could feel \nin his \n&gt; mind that her spark was beating like mad. But he could understand. \nAfter \n&gt; months of worrying, Cinder finally found the bot she&#39;d been \nworrying about. \n&gt; To her, the fact that the rest of the team was gone wasn&#39;t as bad \nas it \n&gt; would have been if Prowl had died too. Aqua was holding Cinder by \nthe \n&gt; shoulders, something that Mantle was thankful for since it \nprevented her \n&gt; from running up to Prowl.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rubble arrived at the CR room of the Element and sat down, waiting \nfor \n&gt; Firearm to get repaired.
