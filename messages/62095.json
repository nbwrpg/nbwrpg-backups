One of the spare parts was a broken power supply. \nCeleron  would have to repair that before it could be useful.  There\nwere a few interface cards, but only one was of any use.  Being\nunlikely to find any other spare computer parts, he would probably\nhave to build the rest of the parts from scratch.  He returned to the\nroom with the computer to do his work.\n\n\nOn Fri, 15 Oct 2004 15:17:26 -0700 (PDT), robert riley\n&lt;bustercross365@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hellplague/ Malice:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hellplague followed Celeron, figuring he was looking for parts.

He entered the hallway a\n&gt; quietly as possible and sneaked to another nearby room.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, 15 Oct 2004 04:30:35 -0000, airly2000 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BlackNightmare:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The femme noodded and left the room towards the place where Malice\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
