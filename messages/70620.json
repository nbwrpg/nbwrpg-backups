He quickly turns back to the insects and positions himse=\r\nlf to prepare for flight.  He wastes no time in giving the signal to implem=\r\nent his attempt to go airbourne.\n\n&quot; NOW!&quot;  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nod=\r\nds to Vestige, and suddenly comes up with an idea. He still could move swif=\r\ntly and dexterously, thanks to his ninjabot training. If ever a time where =\r\nit was needed it was now. He looks around quickly and notices that a format=\r\nion of old metal debris lying on rubble resembles a teeter toter lever. whi=\r\nch he knew he could use as a vaulting platform. It would just take a second=\r\n individual to step on the other end to send him upward for his maneuver. H=\r\ne points to it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; See that? It resembles a catapoult lever. One ind=\r\nividual stands on one end, while the other jumps on the other end to send t=\r\nhe first individual airbourne. From there, I&#39;m sure I can make it to the be=\r\nd. It&#39;s an old Ninjabot trick I learned during training. And if I play my c=\r\nards right, it&#39;ll be a maneuver they don&#39;t see comming.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With that =\r\nhe draws his sword, keeping an eye on the insects.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vestige =\r\nnodded as he glanced at the piece of metal that lay on the\n&gt; floor and then=\r\n back at Tuscon. The piece of metal was actually armor\n&gt; plating that had b=\r\neen part of the wall before the fire fight had\n&gt; started. Now it lay discar=\r\nded on the floor, laying haphazardly on top\n&gt; of debris, ready for Tuscon a=\r\nnd Vestige&#39;s use.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I see.&quot; Vestige said said, his optics clear and foc=\r\nused. Turning he\n&gt; launched a few more shots on the approaching insectoids,=\r\n thier armor\n&gt; absorbing the brunt of his attacks, but even now begining to=\r\n burn and\n&gt; scorch. However Vestige took the moment to get into position.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The insects approach Tuscon warily, thier multifaceted optics looking\n&gt;=\r\n at his sword, thier tail mounted cannons oriented on it and him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You=\r\n cannot succeed Autobot!&quot; Says the voice of the insecoids, &quot;We are\n&gt; the ho=\r\nard, surrender now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The insectoids quickly begin to close on Tuscon&#39;s=\r\n position, thier\n&gt; cannons peppering the area around him with firepower and=\r\n explosive\n&gt; ordanaces!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
