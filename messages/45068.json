I&#39;ve deceided to \n&gt; keep rping with Pacifix, Lynxiz, Switchblade, and Astrotrain. \n(maybe \n&gt; Crossroads as well).\n&gt; \n&gt;    Azure, were you the last one to have characters who interacted \n&gt; with Pacifix? I&#39;d like to know where Jer left him. Also, if \nanything \n&gt; happened to the decepticons that i didn&#39;t hear about i&#39;d like to \n&gt; know about that as well. Last I can remember, everything was at a \n&gt; standstill. I&#39;ve got a solution to the problem, and i was \nwondering \n&gt; if any decepitcons would mind. \n&gt; \n&gt;    Solution: As Switchblade will, while &quot;fixing&quot; megatron, \n&gt; disconnect his vocal abilities, and remove has ability to do \n&gt; anything except stay in pistol mode, and thus can only be used by \n&gt; another (Switchblade or, maybe Switchblade&#39;ll add Megs pistol onto \n&gt; Firestrike... hmmm). Soundwave will then have finished fixing \n&gt; Firestrike, and have both him and Nightstrike (and anyone else who \n&gt; is willing to follow Switchblade) dispatch any loyal followers of \n&gt; Megatron (ie. Soundwave, Laserbeak, Spasstik, Rumble, Frenzy, \n&gt; Stunticons, and anybody else that i might have missed, unless they \n&gt; agree to join Switchblade). \n&gt; \n&gt;    Then the decepticons will either need a leader, or join the NDE \n&gt; with the Dark Avian. If anyone wants any of the characters that \nwill \n&gt; probably end up dying/coldstorage, speak up now.\n&gt; \n&gt;    I&#39;m also going to have to lighten the weight of the Autobots. \n&gt; That means i&#39;ll have to drop Swoop, The Technobots (i like em, \njust \n&gt; found i didn&#39;t like rping them), and maybe Crossroads. Haven&#39;t \n&gt; figured out how i&#39;m going to do that, but it&#39;ll come to me \n&gt; eventually. \n&gt; \n&gt;    Anyone have any suggestions for stowing away my excess \nChivitrons?\n\n\n"}}
