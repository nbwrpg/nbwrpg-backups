Gobots was a rival\n&gt;   &gt; show, about the same, but it didnt have no where\n&gt;   &gt; near the impact with\n&gt;   &gt; storyline, or creating a whole universe. Their toys\n&gt;   &gt; were quite inferior,\n&gt;   &gt; and eventually Hasbro put them out of buisness, then\n&gt;   &gt; bought the rights\n&gt;   &gt; to it. That&#39;s why for a while in Generation 2 they\n&gt;   &gt; had characters named\n&gt;   &gt; Gobot, it was a shot in the face.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; I would have liked to see the Beast Wars that the\n&gt;   &gt; writers would have\n&gt;   &gt; made if they had total control and an unlimited\n&gt;   &gt; budget. In my opinion\n&gt;   &gt; the guys who wrote that show were geniuses.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; I like RID, but I am not to fond of how Anime it is.\n&gt;   &gt; I&#39;m not a big fan\n&gt;   &gt; of Japanese cartoons, and this one is no exeption,\n&gt;   &gt; it dosent take itself\n&gt;   &gt; seriously. The animation is beautiful however, but\n&gt;   &gt; the stories are not\n&gt;   &gt; very compeling. However I have read rumors that\n&gt;   &gt; Takara or Hasbro (i&#39;m\n&gt;   &gt; not sure which one is the owner) will make a brand\n&gt;   &gt; new series soon\n&gt;   &gt; revolving around Generation 1, but this is just a\n&gt;   &gt; rumor.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   __________________________________________________\n&gt;   Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;   Make a great connection at Yahoo!
