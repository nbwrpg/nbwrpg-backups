Could she fly again?\n\nHe was worried about Vlad now, and that was the first time in his\nlife. Vlad had been the nemesis of his friend and former Khan, Phelan\nKell, since Phelan was taken as a bondsman by the Wolves. When Ragnar\nand Phelan went in exile with the warden half of Clan Wolf, Vladimir\nstayed behind and became the Khan of the Crusader Wolves.\n\nNow, he just hoped he was still alive. Maybe he was an enemy, but he\nwas also a fellow Clan Warrior.\n\nOnce again, he opened a frequency.\n\nRagnar: Galaxy Commander, I am waiting for an update on the salvage\noperations. How is the planning going?\n\nKatya rubbed the back of her head.\n\nKatya: Hang on, Ragnar. (To Kup) Do you think we could mount that\nassault now? From what we know, some Predacons are out in the East...\n\n\n"}}
