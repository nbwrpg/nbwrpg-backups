She is now the Predacon Commander \n&gt;and\n&gt;orders had to be given. She looked to her group in the back.\n&gt;     &quot;Thunder Hammer, and Quickstrike, go outside and help take care of the\n&gt;Dinobots. Darkmouse and Paralysis start the manual weponry and try to scare\n&gt;off the Maximals, if not killing them. As for Rampage and the Terricons, \n&gt;you\n&gt;can go outside and help or get off my bridge!&quot; She yelled, taking the \n&gt;command\n&gt;chair.\n&gt;     Now in control, Black Aracnia took the floating keyboard and began to\n&gt;start up the old rusty missle turrets. Paralysis climed into a small \n&gt;cockpit\n&gt;shape chaber with two large canon that he could use to blast away anyone\n&gt;outside the ship. He targeted the Dinobots and fired.\n&gt;     Aracnia typed in the sccess codes and off whissed three heat seeking\n&gt;missles, intent on making that body heat dead cold.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
