She stopped and landed next to him. &quot;Not home, staying with \nfriends, \n&gt; but not a home.  Home is here in the trees, hunting, finding a \ncompanion, \n&gt; flying in and out of the trees, playing in the rivers and running \non the \n&gt; hillsides.  Wakingup to the sounds of the forest.  Here is home.  \nThere is \n&gt; being with friends who need your help.&quot; She looked at him for a \nmoment \n&gt; realized how she sounded.

Is this all his race was,? based on his limited\n&gt; knowledge of war and survival Lunarpine knew that one thing is true.\n&gt; In war there are no friends, only interests. If this is true then \nwhy\n&gt; was she being so nice?\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine took a quick glance behind him, will his new home be this\n&gt; way or is there more to his type of beings than he realized.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I guess you should call for a ride, Your friends wouldn&#39;t know my\n&gt; voice.&quot;Lets go.....&quot;Lunarpine trembled at the thought of leaving \nthis\n&gt; place for a new life in a strange land,....&quot;Home&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
