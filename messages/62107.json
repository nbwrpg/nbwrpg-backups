You just rest, I&#39;ll be alright.&quot;\nWindlord: the male smiled and said&quot;Do you know what happen before \nMalice ran away????...  who may help him?&quot;\nOrganics:  &quot;Hmmm, it may be the two Lady Minions, they seemed to be \nmore concerned about him more than the others.&quot;\nWindlord: &quot;That may  complicate things...&quot; said weakly the male&quot;Any \nidea where can they be?&quot;\n Organics:  &quot;They could be anywhere by now.  On Venus, Mars, \nGanymede, there&#39;s no telling where they are, but I think they ought \nto be on Earth, Malice can&#39;t survive in space like we can.

We need Big Bro to help us out of this one.&quot;\nWindlord: Windlord nodded and looked very tired.\nOrganics:  &quot;If only we could contact Megatron, this would all be \nover.&quot;  She then slowly drifted to sleep, hoping something would \ncome to her in her sleep.\nWindlord: &quot;But if they caught us... we&#39;re lost...&quot;\nOrganics:  she did not answer, sleep had a good hold on her, and \nwould not awaken for a while.\nWindlord: the male smiled and squeezed her hadn, she needed \nrest .... He couldnt sleep, he had to find a way tou help her and \nhis worries didn&#39;t let him rest at all\nInjustice:  The clone came to check on the bird boy, and opened the \ndoor without knocking.  &quot;Hello everyone!  How is everybody!&quot; he said \nin his sarcastic voice.\nWindlord: The male looked annoyed to the clone and he didn&#39;t say \nanything.\nInjustice:  &quot;Why so glum, parrot?  Not having fun?

No really &quot;reply camled the male&quot;it isn&#39;t fun when  \nyou can&#39;t freely walk and in my case, enjoy the nature of the planet \nwhere I born&quot;\nInjustice:  &quot;Well, I guess you&#39;ll just have to get used to it then.  \nYou&#39;re going to be here for quite a whilw.&quot;\nWindlord: &quot;It seems that I have a choice&quot;reply the male with the \nsame camly tone&quot;I should be pacient&quot;\nInjustice:  &quot;For what?
