First we&lt;BR&gt;&gt;would have to remove her from herself so that the parasite could be&lt;BR&gt;&gt;removed. However, we would need a protoform, anther spark chamber, a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;cr chamber, and it possible, a spare brain per say to duplicate or&lt;BR&gt;&gt;download all her programs onto a back up just in case. Hmmm, but it&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt;possible. Very possible. I wonder if we could comminucate with this,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;ah, Sedna by itself? Wonder where it came from and what it needs? If&lt;BR&gt;&gt;it needs a \nform, then we might give it a protoform of it&#39;s own if it&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt;on our side. Perhaps the only way it could communicate with us at all&lt;BR&gt;&gt;was to possess another bot to do so.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered, &quot;Interesting,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;very interesting. So many questions, and I wonder what the answers&lt;BR&gt;&gt;are.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHe turned and looked at Rodimus. &quot;Sir, where is she now?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the male sighed &quot;I don&#39;t know more about this creature... excpet&lt;BR&gt;&gt;that it&#39;s a femme and call hersel Sedna&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; ----- Original Message -----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; From: Dark Mouse&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sent: Monday, May 23, 2005 6:10 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject: Re: \nWindlord/Rodimus/Malice&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence::&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned to Rodimus. &quot;Uh, well, it may or may not be what you wanted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to hear. But first, I must ask to be able to see the object itself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; before I do anything. One cannot damage the host of a parasite to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove the parasite. The host is the victim and must survive. But, if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is discovered that it is a symbiotic relationship, both may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually be benefitting. However, if from what you have told me, be as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; little as possible as it may have been, I will endevour to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; successfully remove this, erhm, thing from your beloved.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to as a little flair to her \nperformance, hoping to the Matrix that it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; might instill a little confidence in Rodimus that she might actually&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; know more than she did. It wasn&#39;t that she wasn&#39;t really smart, she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; was. But this would be her first mission, so to speak. And she wasn&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; going to let anything come between her and success. SHe gave him a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; hopeful smile, &quot;Is there anything else about this Vok instrument that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ll need to know?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Rodimus:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Rodimus smiled back, it seems that the little one was camly, that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; was good.
