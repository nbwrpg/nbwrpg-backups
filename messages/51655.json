Also through experiences with an alien\nrace called the Vok, some bots like myself have become\ntransmetal.  Transmetals can be damaged by energon\nradiation, but have a much higher tolerance for it. \nHere however the energon radiation seems to fluctuate\nfrom nearly zero, to off the scale.  So much even a\ntransmetal can be damaged by it outside of Beast Mode.\n\n--- Azure The Warrior &lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Katya refrained to protest about the fact that her\n&gt; mech was by far better \n&gt; then those made on Terra. It was irrelevant and she\n&gt; knew it.

It&#39;s the reason we aquired Beast\n&gt; &gt;Modes.  We use it for power, but to much of it can\n&gt; &gt;cause damage in robot mode.  Earth is rich in it,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;has enormous amounts of radiation.  My guess is\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;you&#39;re not affected by it because you&#39;re an\n&gt; organic,\n&gt; &gt;and your suit is not affected by it, because it was\n&gt; &gt;first developed here on Earth.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: They were at the ruins of the sphere,\n&gt; right?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bic:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Then why am I not affected?
