He drop=\r\nped his stasis pod \noff on the ground and started to search the hills for a=\r\n cave or \ncavern that he could call home as he tried desperately to rescue =\r\n\nhimself.  He only had enough food to last for a few weeks and he \nwasn&#39;t s=\r\nure if he could eat the organic life.\n\nAfter about an hour of searching the=\r\n hills he found a cave that was \nbig enough for him to occupy.  He entered =\r\nthe cave cautiously \nworrying if one of the organic creators of the planet =\r\ncalled it home \nmuch like he was prepared to do.  After entering the cave a=\r\n couple \nhundred feet, he decided it was unoccupied and he was prepared to =\r\n\ncall it home.  \n\nHe left the cave and climbed back to his stasis pod and b=\r\negan to drag \nit to his new home.  He was still worried that he would die o=\r\nn this \nplanet and that no one would know that he was on the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n-=\r\n-- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;hugar_twriker&quot; &lt;hugar_twriker@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; The door to the stasis pod is flung open as the occupant looks out \n&gt; in=\r\nto the world for the first time.  The occupant grabs the side of \n&gt; the sta=\r\nsis pod with his left hand and pulls himself up.  He quickly \n&gt; jumps out o=\r\nf the pod and looks around him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Blasted Sparks, where am I?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He =\r\nquickly went back to his ship and checked the scanners.  The \nlong \n&gt; range=\r\n scanners were damaged in the crash, but the short ranged \nstill \n&gt; worked =\r\nand they revealed nothing.  No intelligent life was within \n&gt; fifty miles w=\r\nhich obviously meant one thing to the occupant that no \n&gt; longer occupied t=\r\nhe ship.  He was all alone on this world!\n&gt; \n&gt; He started to panic while he=\r\n looked around.  What could he do?  \nMaybe \n&gt; he could get back in the stas=\r\nis pod and blast out of here and \nsearch \n&gt; for a new planet?  No that woul=\r\ndn&#39;t work; the stasis pod didn&#39;t \nhave \n&gt; enough energy to get out of the a=\r\ntmosphere.  He quickly checked the \n&gt; onboard communication unit.  Broken! =\r\n Obviously he couldn&#39;t call \nfar \n&gt; enough for help.  He finally realized t=\r\nhat his only hope was to \n&gt; survive.  The first thing you need to survive i=\r\ns shelter.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bot looked around and noticed some hills off in the dis=\r\ntance.  \nIf \n&gt; there were some hills, maybe there would be some caves or ca=\r\nverns \nor \n&gt; something that he could survive in.   So it was decided he \nth=\r\nought.  \n&gt; He would walk to the hills and hope to find shelter.  \n&gt; \n&gt; He g=\r\nrabbed the side of his stasis pod and started to drag it along \n&gt; with him.=\r\n  It was heavy, but inside there was short range scanners \n&gt; and even a few=\r\n weeks worth of food.  The journey to the hills would \n&gt; be long, but at le=\r\nast it was a way for him to survive.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;hugar_twriker&quot; &lt;hugar_twriker@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In space, sound c=\r\nan not be heard, but if it could a bystander \nwould \n&gt; &gt; hear the loud crac=\r\nk hiss of an asteroid slamming into the cold \nand \n&gt; &gt; white metallic shell=\r\n of a nearby stasis pod.  This rough nudge \nwas \n&gt; &gt; all that was needed to=\r\n change the stasis pod&#39;s planned orbit and \n&gt; &gt; thrust it towards the inner=\r\ns of the solar system.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; An object in motion stays in motion unles=\r\ns acted on and this was \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; case for the stasis pod as it drifted t=\r\nowards the inners of the \n&gt; Solar \n&gt; &gt; System on a constant course until it=\r\ns path was caught by the \n&gt; third&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; planet&#39;s gravitational pull.  The =\r\npull was enough to cause the \n&gt; stasis \n&gt; &gt; pod to forgo its journey to the=\r\n sun and instead to enter the \n&gt; precious \n&gt; &gt; atmosphere of the third plan=\r\net.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the pod came screaming down through the atmosphere the meta=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt; started to heat up.  The once white metal started to burn red as \n&gt; =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; stasis pod was quickly coming to the climax of its journey.  A \n&gt; =\r\ntrail \n&gt; &gt; of smoke could be seen by anyone that bothered to look up into \n=\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; day sky.  The stasis pod finally came to rest in what was known \na=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; Maine.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The occupant of the stasis pod, who was in a stasi=\r\ns, woke with \nthe \n&gt; &gt; landing of the pod.  The occupant took a quick breat=\r\nh as the \n&gt; internal \n&gt; &gt; speakers of the stasis pod declared,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ac=\r\nquiring Beast Mode.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The occupant let out a blood curling scream a=\r\ns its body started \nto \n&gt; &gt; change as it download the new mode.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
