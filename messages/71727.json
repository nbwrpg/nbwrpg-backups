He extends his wings to their fullest to catch a strong pocket o=\r\nf wind beneath them.  It seems to work nicely as he makes a last minute eff=\r\nort to glide quickly toward the shuttle.  \n\n&quot; I - am coming - in - now. &quot; \n=\r\n\nWith extremely low energy supplies Tucson&#39;s transformation program forces =\r\nhim back into beast mode to preserve what is left of his fuel.   He manages=\r\n to hold onto Silverbolt during the conversion, with his front claws.  He b=\r\narely makes it into the shuttle, as he folds in his wings in a clumsy manne=\r\nr, dragging his underbelly on the floor of the shuttle.  \n\nHe sets his frie=\r\nnd down gently onto a platform and then collapses himself.  His breath is l=\r\nabored yet he is still able to keep himself online.  And even in his compro=\r\nmised state, he still carries an air of his famous temperament, as he narro=\r\nws his eyes with a low growl in his voice.\n\n&quot; About Rodimus...  If he chose=\r\n to turn on our faction, then so be it.  Instead of taking the initiative t=\r\no fend off the temptation, he has opted for an easy way out instead.  I did=\r\n what I could to save him!  I can not do any more than that! &quot;\n\nHe snaps hi=\r\ns tail in annoyance.  \n\n&quot; He has no sense of responsibility, self confidenc=\r\ne, or the ineptitude to overcome a major adversity!  Of course he is vulner=\r\nable to possession!  HE WANTS IT THAT WAY, IT&#39;S THE EASIEST WAY AROUND A DI=\r\nFFICULT SITUATION!&quot;\n\nHe slaps a heavy front paw down on the shuttle floor. =\r\n Now exhausted, he tries to catch his breath. Yet he looks to Leo Prime as =\r\nhe fights to keep his head and long neck up off the shuttle floor.\n\n&quot; Leo P=\r\nrime, the best thing to do is to relinquish his Prime status and revert him=\r\n back to Hot Rod, where he can do no harm.  From now on, until I am restore=\r\nd, I ask that you assume all leadership duties while I recover.  Promise me=\r\n you will - do as I request?&quot;\n\nHe can no longer hold up his head and lays i=\r\nt back on the floor.  Yet he looks to Stanton while conversing with Leo Pri=\r\nme.  It was clear to him that Rodimus was quite comfortable where he was an=\r\nd that now it was time to do something about him.  The silver dragon harden=\r\ns to the idea of having to fight against a friend who now proves to be his =\r\ngreatest foe.  A look of sheer determination covers his face as he remains =\r\ngrounded for the time being. \n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy.=\r\n \n\nOn Aug 17, 2011, at 12:30 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson looks down to Silverbolt.
