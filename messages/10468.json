She turned and went down the hallway. \nShe stopped in at she work bench area to get a mapper and 3-D \nholoscanner.  She went into the engine room and started to get the \nfigures.  \n\nShe finished with the engine room in a few hours.  She set the \nscanner to project the engines in functioning order and with all \nparts visible on the display.  She looked at the engines with her own \neyes and saw the gapping holes and bent pipes and ruined plugs and \ngastkets.  She gave a deep sigh knowing it would never be fixed or \nmeant to fly again.\n\nShe went through most of the ship getting specs and figures.  She \nwent outside and scanned the outside of the ship.  She entered data \nto the specs so the holes and other damage wouldn&#39;t show in the \nprojection.  She made the ship gold colored so it would look nice \nwhen she presented the specs to the others. \n\nShe smiled when she had the figures all entered into the hand held \nprojector.  She walked back inside the ship and went to the room \nwhere Striker was.  She handed him the projector. &quot;Here, this might \ncome in handy.&quot;  She smiled, rather pleased with her work. &quot;It&#39;s the \nplans and prints for the ship.  I updated them.  I hope it helps with \nthe building of the replica.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
