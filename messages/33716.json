The first part is sort of an introduction, the part after \nthe line is the first time of me actually using him.  And a big \nappology for violence against rabbits!\n&gt; \n&gt;     A dim, ex-Alliance spark is buried in a dark, Maximal storage \nplace.  The spark was that of the one and only Skulletron.  It \nstarted to light up a bit.  Then, it started to float.  It flew \naround a little bit, then saw a hole, big enough for it to get \noutside.  It flew out, and flew all over.  Then, it disappeared in a \nsmall explosion of light.  It was heading towards the Matrix.  \nSkulletron&#39;s spark got closer, and closer.  Then, the Matrix spoke.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Hideous spark!  I can not take you, Skulletron, and I won&#39;t.  \nNow, I must ban you from here, and I shall send you away to the Vok,&quot; \nthe Matrix&#39;s voice said.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Skulletron&#39;s spark was sent to a Vok colony way out in space.  \nThey took his spark, and began making an organic creature out of \nhim.  They made him a gruesome killing machine.  And they named him \nSlaughter.  Slaughter still had the mind and memories of Skulletron.  \nRevenge.  Slaughter had to eat everything he killed, to live.  If he \ndidn&#39;t eat within 2 days, he would die.  He even ate energon and \nsparks.  The Vok were satisfied with their creation, and sent him to \nEarth.  Slaughter appeared in Canada.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;          Slaughter was in a dense forest.  He looked around.  A \nrabbit!  Slaughter ran over, then did a somersault and landed in \nfront of the rabbit.  The rabbit stared up at him, and vice-versa.  A \ndrop of slime dropped from Slaughter&#39;s chin and landed on the \nrabbit&#39;s head, and the rabbit blinked, then tried rubbing the slime \noff.  Slaughter picked up the rabbit by its neck with his pinsir, \nthen crammed the rabbit into his mouth, and chewed vigorously.  The \ncrunching of bones and guts could be heard.  Then, Slaughter was \nfinished his meal.  Some blood still dripped from the sides of his \nmouth, but he didn&#39;t bother to wipe it, and let it drip.  Slaughter \nflapped his wings and flew up over the trees.  Then, he began flying \noff, looking for a bigger meal.\n\n\n"}}
