I =\r\nwould imagine that our Lord Hydras has plans in mind that\n&gt; would cover all=\r\n of this.&quot; He said slyly, trying to keep from assuming\n&gt; too much command l=\r\nest HYDRAS lash out at him.\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHADOW folded his hands together before=\r\n him in a gesture of\n&gt; humility. &quot;And I would think that the Maximals would=\r\n never send out a\n&gt; Prime without soldiers to go with him. The question is =\r\nwhy? They have\n&gt; not sent out a Prime in years.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; You see, the Predacon=\r\ns were not properly aware of the crash of the\n&gt; prison ship and the release=\r\n of so many prisoners onto old Earth. Nor\n&gt; had anyone yet figured out how =\r\nmuch the cumulitive affect of all these\n&gt; constant battles could be having =\r\non the timeline. SOmehting the\n&gt; Maximals had only recently realized themse=\r\nlves.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT/VICE GRIP&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from VICE GRIP, &quot;Yes, =\r\nwhy send a Prime out now?  And they would likely to have at least an escort=\r\n, or an honor guard.  Probably elite soldiers and veterans, perhaps those w=\r\nho fought in the GREAT WAR.&quot;\n\nAs much as he enjoyed combat against MAXIMAL =\r\nOPPRESSORS, the thought of taking a PRIME on in combat along with their per=\r\nsonal escort would be suicide, even by his standards.\n\nIf such a powerful s=\r\noldier was here, then why would he also be attempting to engage in a truce =\r\nwtih the PREDACONS?\n\nDINOBOT offered as a &#39;suggestion&#39; to HYDRAS, &quot;Garner a=\r\ns much intelligence as you can from this newcomer as to waht the circumstan=\r\nces are, and attempt to negotiate for as full a price as you can for our di=\r\nrect..  Assistance.  So that we might have a full picture of circumstances.=\r\n&quot;\n\n&lt;OLD - CRYOTEK&gt;\n\n&gt; There was a humorous smile, &quot;Now if I give you everyt=\r\nhing, there would\n&gt; be nothing to keep you here by my side, now would there=\r\n dear lady.&quot; He\n&gt; glanced down at BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;Plus I must admit, I am a=\r\n little shy\n&gt; in front of an audience.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Was CRYOTEK talking about HYDR=\r\nAS and the others around them or had he\n&gt; guessed or maybe even detected he=\r\nr open link to TARANTULUS. His\n&gt; enagmatic smile revealed little to nothing=\r\n about the dark and devious\n&gt; intelligence that hid behind his faceplate.\n&gt;=\r\n \n\n&lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nAt this point, BLACKARACHNIA gave a mental sigh. =\r\n WHy did the interesting ones always be the ones that enjoyed playing too m=\r\nuch?  Smiling back up at CRYOTEK.  &quot;Ohh, I guess you&#39;ll have to learn thign=\r\ns on your own time.&quot;  Giving a wink, &quot;And I&#39;ll enjoy going along with you f=\r\nor every moment of it.&quot;\n\nWaiting for HYDRAS and TARANTALUS to give out the =\r\nmission roders to see what she would be made to do as far as retrieval went=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Fractil is in charge to study it...&quot; Hissed H=\r\nydras while their little heads\n&gt; &gt; watched at Tarantulus trying to found ou=\r\nt what is he doing&quot;I had...
