My life is getting busier, it isn&#39;t fun \nfor me \n&gt; anymore, and i have lost my creative drive.  Any of you may email me \n&gt; privately, whenever you want.  I would love to keep in touch.  I \nwill now \n&gt; tell my history here, for those who don&#39;t know me as well as others. \n One \n&gt; day, a year and a half ago, i was on Ben Yee&#39;s message board.  I \ncame across \n&gt; a post talking about Neo beast Wars RPG.  I had been looking to join \nan RPG, \n&gt; but none of them interested me, until NBW.  When i joined, it was \njust a \n&gt; mailing list.  Every day, people sent posts of the current list of \nmembers.  \n&gt; Eventually, we became part of egroups (now Yahoogroups), and were \nable to \n&gt; gain a much larger amount of members.  When i joined, the council \nwas \n&gt; Yanshosh, Kslawdogg, JP3884, and Inferno371.  Soulstice was there \ntoo, then \n&gt; being called &quot;code,&quot; much to his disliking.  The Maximals were led \nby Liono \n&gt; Prime, the Predacons by Hellbeast.  The Alliance was there, but it \nwas far \n&gt; smaller.  And so i began my long involvement.  I saw the tide turn \nboth ways \n&gt; in the war, and small custom factions spring up and then disapear.  \nI saw my \n&gt; fair share of idiots (ahh Icedemon), but there were also some great \nposters.  \n&gt; There was Dachande who started the Destrons, Logo, who had the \nhottest female \n&gt; characters ever, my good friend shomin, with his psycho \nreligiousness, \n&gt; carnagedarkness, with (his/her? not sure) long, thinky posts with \nDinobot, \n&gt; and many others.  And let&#39;s not forget Minime_316, this RPG&#39;s only \ntragedy.  \n&gt; For those of you who don&#39;t know, Minime overdosed himself with \npills.  To \n&gt; make matters worse, that bastard JP beleived that the tragic email \nby his \n&gt; brother was fake.  Oh, and KSL, im not angry that your characters \nmurdered \n&gt; Soundwave, don&#39;t worry about it.  For those that didn&#39;t like me, \nwell then \n&gt; good for you, but for my friends here, feel free to talk to me \nwhenever you \n&gt; want.  I&#39;ll always remember Neo Beast Wars RPG.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another turning point\n&gt; A fork stuck in the road\n&gt; Time grabs you by the wrist\n&gt;  Directs you where to go\n&gt; So make the best of this test and don&#39;t ask why\n&gt; It&#39;s not a question but a lesson learned in time\n&gt; It&#39;s something unpredictable\n&gt; But in the end is right\n&gt; I hope you had the time of your life\n&gt; \n&gt; So take the photographs and stillframes in your mind\n&gt; Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time\n&gt; Tattoos of memories and deadskin on trial\n&gt; For what it&#39;s worth it was worth all the while\n&gt; It&#39;s something unpredictable\n&gt; But in the end is right\n&gt; I hope you had the time of your life\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s something unpredictable\n&gt; But in the end is right\n&gt; I hope you had the time of your life\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Alloran\n\n\n"}}
