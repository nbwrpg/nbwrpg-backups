But he had not had time to formally as=\r\nsemble a plan of attack.  This was it, he had to literally do things as if =\r\ntravelling on an off road path, not sure of where it would lead him, as lon=\r\ng as his wheels could still carry him through the distance.  First he repli=\r\nes to Legacy.\n\n&quot; An old artifact I had found on Atlantis, strange that you =\r\nmention Human history because when I found it, I was not sure as to what I =\r\nhad found and how it came to rest there.  It was the only fragment of stone=\r\n pictograph I found.  But there it was, the legend of the Hydra.  I swear I=\r\n&#39;m not making this up...  But I don&#39;t know of its true origin. Anyway, Lega=\r\ncy, I&#39;m getting pretty sick of the Predacons and Decepticons bullying my co=\r\nmrades around like mindless pawns.  Rodimus is right, it&#39;s about time I did=\r\n something, and even though no formal strategy is in place, I don&#39;t intend =\r\nto fall to anyone.  This is Tucson Prime, signing off, will reconnect with =\r\nyou shortly.&quot;\n\nHe was furious at this point.  He wanted the fighting to end=\r\n.  And he was willing to go one on one to win back his comrade&#39;s freedom.  =\r\nCyclonus had been a very large thorn in his side.  And now, he was going to=\r\n prove a thorn in his!\n\n&quot; Rodimus, I want you to make a run for the door, t=\r\nake the others with you, including Darkhawk, and form a protective barrier =\r\naround him. Legacy is going to open an escape path for us.  But first, it&#39;s=\r\n about time I won our side some pay back.&quot;\n\nHe cracks his knuckles and star=\r\nes coldly at Cyclonus.\n\n&quot; You want to take the Autobots down, you&#39;ll have t=\r\no get past me first, Cyclonus!  And this time, I&#39;m not holding anything bac=\r\nk!&quot;\n\nNight Shift knew what Tucson Prime was up to.  Although he had never r=\r\neally done things typically, Tucson Prime had never disappointed anyone as =\r\nof yet.  \n\n&quot;Woahh, we&#39;re gonna have ourselves a one on one.  Tucson Prime a=\r\ngainst Cyclonus...  Ohhh I remember these times when Optimus would go again=\r\nst Megatron in the old days.&quot; \n\nOutside, Rat Trap and Quickstride decide to=\r\n follow Legacy, as Rat Trap sits atop his comrade&#39;s back, waiting to gallop=\r\n in at a moment&#39;s notice.\n\n&quot; Ooooh I gotta be nuts but I&#39;ll do anythn&#39; ta h=\r\nelp Wheels win this fight.&quot;\n\nQuickstride snorts.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve been itchn&#39; for a =\r\nbrawl all afternoon!  SO WHO CAN SAY DECEPTICSCRAP?!&quot;\n\nRat Trap chimes in.\n=\r\n\n&quot;And Prediscrap!&quot; \n\nNight Shift reports to Legacy, Lord Elder,Rat Trap, Lo=\r\nrd Perseus, and Quickstride.\n\n&quot;Yo, Night Shift here, I&#39;m broadcastn&#39; from N=\r\ninjabot Radio Network, you&#39;re missn&#39; some real hot tension buildn&#39; up in he=\r\nre.  I think Tucson Prime&#39;s sick of Cyclonus&#39;s scrap and he&#39;s lookn&#39; ta go =\r\none on one ta show &#39;em what he&#39;s really made of.  I ain&#39;t never seen &#39;em th=\r\nis steamed off but slag, he&#39;s got a look in his face like he&#39;s itchn&#39; ta do=\r\n some major damage.  Maybe you&#39;ll get in here just in time ta take advantag=\r\ne of some newly fallen spare parts..  Maybe, that&#39;s if there are any.&quot;\n\nRat=\r\n Trap&#39;s face beams with joy.\n\n&quot; I wouldn&#39;t miss that for the world!  Boooya=\r\nhhh, that&#39;s a fight I gotta see!&quot;\n\nQuickstride snorts.\n\n&quot; Count me in, I do=\r\nn&#39;t wanna miss a single part of the action!&quot;\n\nInside, Tucson turns quickly =\r\nto Rodimus.\n\n&quot; This is it Rodimus, this is where our tables are going to tu=\r\nrn, and then, we will make these Predacons and Decepticons eat their words.=\r\n  We aren&#39;t going to run, we&#39;re going to fight and we&#39;re going to give it o=\r\nur all!  AUTOBOTS, MAXIMALS, ASSUME YOUR BATTLE MODES AT THIS TIME AND EREC=\r\nT ALL SHIELDS SURROUNDING THE OLD MAXIMAL BASE AND THE ARK!  WE WILL PROTEC=\r\nT OUR OWN AND VANQUISH OUR ENEMIES!  WE&#39;RE GOING TO TAKE BACK THIS PLANET A=\r\nND TURN THINGS AROUND FOR THE INNOCENT!  THIS FIGHT IS FOR FREEDOM, NOT POW=\r\nER, AND WE WILL TAKE IT BACK!&quot;\n\nRat Trap had been slightly incorrect.  Tucs=\r\non Prime was now making it clear.  Fall back, give room to assemble for bat=\r\ntle.  It wasn&#39;t just his fight, this fight was for everyone&#39;s freedom, and =\r\nnow he looks straight ahead.\n\n&quot;Huh, is he sayn&#39; what I think he&#39;s sayn&#39;?&quot;\n\n=\r\nHe waits with anticipation.  Inside Tucson Prime pauses for just one moment=\r\n, and then with almost a roar in his voice..\n\n&quot;AUTOBOTS, MAXIMALS, ATTACK!&quot;=\r\n  \n\nRat Trap holds on for dear life.\n\n&quot;CHAAAARGE!&quot;\n\nQuickstride rears and b=\r\nolts behind Legacy.\n\n&quot;About time we did somethn&#39;! I was gettn&#39; bored!&quot;\n\nIns=\r\nide, Tucson Prime throws a powerful punch and launches one of his large mis=\r\nsiles from his missile carrier, attempting to open fire on the enemy to sha=\r\nke them up a bit.  Night Shift attempts to do the same with his photon blas=\r\nt riffle.\n\n&quot; That&#39;s right, you be messn&#39; with the wrong bots slag balls!&quot;\n\n=\r\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: LEGACY, Quickstride, Rat Trap\n&gt; Location: Outside the Black fortr=\r\ness\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup ducked when the shot hit the blackfortress and shielded Nigh=\r\ntlight with\n&gt; &gt; his body in order to avoid her any damage. Then he left on =\r\nthe floor\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight and opened his com link to Rattrap, and the others=\r\n outside &quot;I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; heading towards the exit... Cover me, Nightlight is with =\r\nme but she&#39;s... she\n&gt; &gt; is sedated...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then the old autobot took Nig=\r\nhlight and continue his trip towards the exit\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Acknowledged.&quot; Legacy&#39;s=\r\n voice transmitted to Kup.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as Legacy spoke, the door of the Black=\r\n Fortress, the frame and\n&gt; the wall surrounding it began to smoke under the=\r\n assault that massive\n&gt; tank that was Legacy was bringing to bear against i=\r\nt!\n&gt; \n&gt; Then with a loud crash the door and it&#39;s frame, rather than\n&gt; vapor=\r\nizing, fell to the ground in a long arc. Interestingly, the\n&gt; specialized h=\r\neat resistant armor that normally protected the walls and\n&gt; doors of the fo=\r\nrtress against the searing heat from the lava, now\n&gt; allowed these same dev=\r\nices, much like a drawbridge over a moat, to\n&gt; become a pathway over the la=\r\nva and into the Black Fortress itself!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Autobots.&quot; Legacy transmitted =\r\nto the Autobots and Maximals, &quot;I am\n&gt; resuming my entry into the Black Fort=\r\nress to assist Rodimus and\n&gt; Tuscon. Kup, I would suggest you rendevous wit=\r\nh me as soon as you&#39;re\n&gt; able, the path behind me should be a safe egress.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Rat Trap, Quickstride.&quot; Legacy&#39;s cold voice intoned, &quot;You have the\n&gt;=\r\n option to accompany me if you desire.&quot; With that Legacy&#39;s lights came\n&gt; on=\r\n, illuminating the entrance he had just made as he began to go\n&gt; inside.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Legacy&#39;s force shield sparked as it began to absorb blows from the\n&gt; int=\r\nernal defences that the fortress tried to bring against him. So far\n&gt; it wa=\r\ns holding.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I got the okay from Airly to knock down the=\r\n door and such woohoo!!. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
