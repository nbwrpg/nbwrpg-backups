I have a character in mind\n&gt; for Hydras&#39; new sec=\r\nond in command, or security officer - or however he\n&gt; wants to use him. I c=\r\nould play it myself, but I would much rather have\n&gt; a player use the charac=\r\nter rather than myself. Plus I would think it\n&gt; would help Airly to have ot=\r\nher players on his team. I have his team in\n&gt; place but he is woefully shor=\r\nt on other players.\n&gt; \n&gt; He should be coming available very soon and I want=\r\ned to see if anyone\n&gt; out there wanted to take him on.\n&gt; \n&gt; To give you a l=\r\nittle in game history: he is a transmetal and a Mega\n&gt; sized character, one=\r\n who was loyal to BW&#39;s Megatron and now Hydras,\n&gt; since Hydras was once par=\r\ntly Megatron.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you think you are interested please let me know on or=\r\n off list.\n&gt; This is open to anyone who feels they can keep up with posting=\r\n at\n&gt; least a few times a week and can handle being Hydras&#39; subordinate.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; From what I can see Hydras is a good commander and he doesn&#39;t bite . .\n&gt;=\r\n . MUCH! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Come one come all! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
