I&#39;=\r\nll have to transform if we&#39;re going to get up there.  Straight Shot, you&#39;re=\r\n small enough, you can get up there easilly.

In fact Rodimus&#39; form cannot be truly seen, as he&#39;s covered\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhead to foot in them, however every scan confirms that he is indeed in\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthere somewhere. Scans also reveal that although he is healthy, he is\n&gt; &gt; u=\r\nndergoiong his own ordeal, something left over from the insects. Time\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\ns of the essence to get him back and repaired.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the party makes =\r\nit way back to the Ark they can hear several\n&gt; &gt; explosions behind them, th=\r\ne walls rumbling around them but so far\n&gt; &gt; nothing seems to inhibit their =\r\ntravel.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile back at the Ark Lord Elder was there at the head=\r\nquarters,\n&gt; &gt; apparently he had not taken any time for rest or even to eat,=\r\n instead\n&gt; &gt; he manned the communicatyion station waiting for any word.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &quot;We read you Tuscon!&quot; Elder said as the call came in. &quot;We will have\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; medical staff standing by when you get here.&quot; Elder manipulated a few\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; controls as he spoke, &quot;and the shield is up and waiting for your\n&gt; &gt; entr=\r\nance.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Elder turned back to Kup and just smiled broadly, &quot;They&#39;re =\r\nalive!&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; said, nearly leaping out his chair with happniness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n It takes Tuscon hours of driving, but finally Tuscon arrives at an\n&gt; &gt; ope=\r\nning, a final break in the long monotony of near featureless\n&gt; &gt; smoothly t=\r\nunneled walls. They at long last arrive at an opening to a\n&gt; &gt; rather deep =\r\npit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The pit is very deep and very dark and it seems to go on for =\r\na very\n&gt; &gt; long time. It is roughly 8-10 feet and looking down it runs near=\r\nly\n&gt; &gt; straight down into the depths of the earth; even with artificial\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n light, its end point cannot be seen as it continued into the darkness\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbelow. However looking up, several hundred feet up a tiny pinprick of\n&gt; &gt; l=\r\night can be seen, it is the surface! However to reach the top one\n&gt; &gt; would=\r\n need to be able to fly or have extremely good climbing\n&gt; &gt; abilities, as t=\r\nhere are no hand holds and not even a single plant\n&gt; &gt; breaks the surface o=\r\nf the walls lining this area, the sides are\n&gt; &gt; extremely smooth and sheer,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; almost as if someone had cut it with some sort of high energy beam. .\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From beneath Tuscon&#39;s position heat and noxious fumes rise from be=\r\nlow,\n&gt; &gt; clearly show the danger of failing to climb or fly properly and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; plunging into the super heated depths. It would be a grizzly end\n&gt; &gt; inde=\r\ned.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
