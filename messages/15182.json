Being left \nhere with an idiot like Inferno was torture....he needed to call someone...\n    &quot;Inferno! Get Aracnia on the Comm.&quot; He yelled in his gravely voice as he \ntook the command chair.\n    Inferno shot up from a little nap. &quot;The Royalty! Oh how I have missed \nher!&quot; He said, enthusiastically.\n    Rampage grimmaced. He didnt like Aracnia. She knew it and he knew she \nknew it. It didnt matter. At least he would have some intelligent \nconversation.\n\n    Aracnia turned in surprise to the comm station. Aerostreak and Paralysis \nwere there, and somewhere Quickstrike and Darkmouse were around. She walked \nup to the comm and found that Rampage wanted her..\n    &quot;What dose he want?&quot; She questioned rather coldly. HE claws were on her \nhips in a feminine way.\n    Paralysis looked at her, &quot;He wants to rejoin. The ship is ours agian.&quot; He \nthen turned back to his work.\n    Aracnia thought for a moment. &quot;Call Tarantulas and tell him that Kitkat \nand her group can move in here, were going back to the ship!&quot;\n\n    Tarantulas recives the message and turnes to Kitkat. &quot;I have rather good \nnews. You can still join us, and have your own base. Ramapge has turned over \nthe ship so you can have control of the bunker. It would be wise, this way we \ncan control more area.&quot;\n\n"}}
