But that didn&#39;t matter.  She was\n&gt; enjoying the moment.  She knew that they were supposed to be having a\n&gt; more physical fighting match between them.  But she knew that she was\n&gt; no match for him physically.  He was stronger than her pure and\n&gt; simple.  She wasn&#39;t build for fighting and she knew it.  So she had\n&gt; to out think him as opposed to trying to out mucsle him.\n&gt;\n&gt; She saw him run into the cave.  She swooped down and transformed into\n&gt; bot mode.  She kept her sachel on her shoulder and looked around.  He\n&gt; was inside the cave, but that didn&#39;t mean that she would follow him.\n&gt;\n&gt; She climbed up to the roof of the cave and stood on top of the\n&gt; opening.  She layed down and hung her head down to\n&gt; yell. &quot;HHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n&gt; IIIIINNNNNN THEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRREEEEEEEEE!&quot;\n&gt; She got up and jumpd back a few feet just incase he tried to grab her\n&gt; and pull her down.  She hoped he heard her well enough.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free, Unlimited Calls Anywhere!\n&gt; Conference in the whole family on the same call.\n&gt; Let the fights begin!
