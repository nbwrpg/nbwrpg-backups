Tried as she could to fight, her power levels were \n&gt; not high enough to have her fail safe programs put up the \nfirewalls \n&gt; and protect her main programs.  She was being reprogrammed to have \n&gt; her loyalties for this new bot whom she had never met yet.  She \n&gt; could feel the program download into her mainframe.
