She fell just before \nthe ramp.  The hit to her leg was worse than she originally thought \nan made it painful to walk on it at all.  She got up and leaned \nagainst the ramp.  She waited to see if anyone would see her standing \nnext to the ship on the visual scanners. If no one came, she would \nhave to use her link.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Jason Vorhees&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Skulletron::\n&gt; \n&gt;             Skulletron took note that they might trace it.\n&gt; \n&gt;            &quot;Never mind Zardus!&quot; He said and shut off his comm-\nlink.  \n&gt; Skulletron continued waiting, getting a little impatient.\n\n\n"}}
