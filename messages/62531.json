I found myself burried upside-down in the sand, with no\n&gt; recollection of how I got there.  Before that I had been assisting a\n&gt; few bots on another crashed ship with repairs, but I have no idea\n&gt; where that was, how far away or whether they are still there or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s not that I had any special attachment to that group either, I\n&gt; just sumbled upon that ship the same way I found this one.  I am not\n&gt; certain, but these memory losses may be happening more often than I\n&gt; care to admit....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron felt more at ease with sharing this now there was only one\n&gt; other bot onboard.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do you have any diagnostic equipment onboard?  I have not had a full\n&gt; repair and diagnosis for a very long time...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HA!  Is that all you got?  You boasted such power, such skill!
