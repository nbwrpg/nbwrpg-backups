You can remain here, we have no use of you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He motions for the Alliance to stop firing. &quot;Dark One,&quot; he says over\n&gt; his comm, &quot;As soon as Unitron and the rest leave the Cybertronian\n&gt; Fire, return the Maximal and we&#39;ll get out of here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks back at Angel Prime, his eyes glancing over at the other\n&gt; Maximals, who were advancing with their guns ready, uncertain whether\n&gt; to fire or not now that the Alliance had stopped firing.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The Alliance will depart as soon as all our bots are out of your\n&gt; base. Untill then, neither side will fire on the other.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; FZ looks back at Angel Prime, a small smile playing over his\n&gt; lips. &quot;Now tell me, Maximal, what did you gain by defying your\n&gt; commander and opening fire? If you hadn&#39;t, we&#39;d be long gone from\n&gt; here, and you&#39;d had your Maximal back and would be able to repair the\n&gt; others. You simply delayed our departure, as well as endangered the\n&gt; Maximals. Next time, I suggest you listen to your commander.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl looks over at Hot Rod. &quot;I have no idea. The Alliance is no\n&gt; longer firing.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks at Iron Raptor. &quot;Do we still fight? And I think we should go\n&gt; up there to keep an eye on Zardus&#39; clone at least.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster, Firearm, Grimmler, and Proto stop a little ways from the\n&gt; Alliance, looking at them suspicioustly and ready for battle.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
