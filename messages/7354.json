His internal repairs have been completed, \nand the assassin transforms into his hideous robot mode. He walks into the \ncave, his scanners picking up bots within.\n\nHe looks around at all the bots and the equipment, making sure to stay close \nto the exit so he can run out if they take this the wrong way.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m joining.
