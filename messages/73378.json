Check out Tucson&#39;s body language, his tail tapp&#39;n the g=\r\nround, his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stiff gait, and that little snarl on the snout. He does =\r\nthat when he smells someth&#39;n that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem right.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Tucson turns to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I think it&#39;s best to keep an=\r\n eye on Legacy. Tell me if you see any suspicious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behavior on his p=\r\nart. If you do, don&#39;t let him suspect that you know anything. Just play\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; along, observe and relay back to me what you observe. Then together wi=\r\nth Leo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Prime, we can decide what action may need to be done. I thin=\r\nk this is long overdue. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He salutes Rodimus and heads to t=\r\nhe med bay.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Agreed.&quot; RODIMUS said as he gl=\r\nanced at LEGACY and then back at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; TUCSON, &quot;We need to keep an optic on=\r\n him. I have not had a chance to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know him well, perhaps Lord Elder ca=\r\nn help you with details about him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he has been around him the longest=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile SANTON, BUMP and LEGACY have all made their way t=\r\no the medical bay.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If LEGACY is the least bit uncomfortable wi=\r\nth all the optics watching\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him and all the suspicious looks being dir=\r\nected his way there is not a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shred of it visable on his cold faceplat=\r\ne. Instead he is his typical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; efficient self as he walked over to a co=\r\nnsole and began to feed in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; information.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;If you two will=\r\n get up on the medical beds.&quot; SANTON said, &quot;We can see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if we can get =\r\nthis over with as fast as possible.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the same time BUMP was=\r\n looking at LEGACY in a speculative manner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rattrap nods and gets into beast mode.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I wonder what Cybertron&#39;s gonna be like when we get home.. Probabl=\r\ny not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same as we remember it. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson looks to=\r\n Talon and gently rubs his head against hers, minding his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; snout . D=\r\nragons had ways of expressing their love for their mates and what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\ne was doing was no different. His feelings were definitely real, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; nothing would ever change that. But as he closes his eyes for a moment, a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vision comes into play. The single optic, staring down at him, as =\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flashbacks to earlier days when he was just an Autobot. A red op=\r\ntic, and a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gun pointed right at him! And a familiar face. SHOCKWAVE=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It shocks him with a bit of a gasp. He looks at Legacy an=\r\nd then back to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Talon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Shockwave. I was almost des=\r\ntroyed by him vorns ago, back on Cybertron. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knew it, that&#39;s where=\r\n I&#39;ve seen bots of Legacy&#39;s kind. It&#39;s part of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; memory I thought I=\r\n lost when I was taken off line and blinded.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; LEO PRIME had walked up as well, &quot;Yes he does bear a resemblance to\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Shockwave doesn&#39;t he, the same single optic, the same cold way about\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; him.&quot; LEO didn&#39;t look all that trusting either.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There was a =\r\nnod from LORD ELDER, &quot;Yes, but he has done more to protect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this Ark t=\r\nhen most of us put together.&quot; ELDER was talking about when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he defnded=\r\n the ARK against the UNICRONIANS all by himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ELDER glanced=\r\n at LEGACY and then back at LEO and TUCSON, &quot;But perhaps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this is not =\r\nthe best place to discuss this.

I&#39;d be the same way. =\r\n  So we&#39;re gonna go back ta Cybertron huh?  I can&#39;t even remember what it l=\r\nooks like, and what it&#39;s gonna look like when we get back....   AAACHOO!  S=\r\norry.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson sighs.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I don&#39;t rememb=\r\ner much of it myself.  My memories were stolen from me, by Cyclonus, accord=\r\ning to Straightshot, who actually saw him take the shot. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; He then turns to Lord Elder and Leo Prime.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; if I cou=\r\nld have anything returned to me, I would much rather have had my memories r=\r\neturned, rather than my sight.  I can still love Talon even without my eyes=\r\n and see her inner beauty through my spark, but I can never remember those =\r\nbefore me as I wish to remember them. It&#39;s rather surprising that one of my=\r\n memories did come back.. But those I have lost, what happened to them?  Pe=\r\nrhaps returning home may help me to regain a portion of what I lost.  But I=\r\n will be sure to hold onto these new memories and guard them with my own sp=\r\nark.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift growls as he tries to lick at the stran=\r\nge growth on his leg.  Quickstride turns his head away from his leg.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hey stop that!  No, bad kitty!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nightshif=\r\nt grunts.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I know, but it itches. I sure hope the guys =\r\ncan get this off me, it&#39;s worse than having fleas.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Loca=\r\nl artist who specializes in illustration, using traditional and digital med=\r\nia.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I also specialize in hand made crafts.  Great for =\r\nany occasion!  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Need a great gift idea that is original?=\r\n  No problem!  Email me at this address and we will talk.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; On May 9, 2012, at 9:38 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Tucson nods but still appears a tad stiff in his posture while loo=\r\nking over to Legacy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He could sense something but was no=\r\nt sure as to what he was sensing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; H=\r\nmm.. Strange, with all your knowledge, you seemed to have overlooked the&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presence of a fellow Maximal. Normally as part of our team=\r\n, you should have had&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some means of capturing a fellow c=\r\nomrade&#39;s signature and made the determination&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that he or=\r\n she is still within close proximity. But what you&#39;re saying contradicts th=\r\nat.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I will talk to you later, first, all of us n=\r\need treatment, if we&#39;re to rejoin the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forces.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He turns to follow Bump to med bay as does Nig=\r\nhtshift and Uproar who also looks&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back at Legacy with ca=\r\nt like suspicion.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Ever since he got=\r\n here, I haven&#39;t trusted that bot at all. What if he&#39;s one of them? A&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; mole? What if everything that&#39;s happened so far, is because a=\r\n shred of intel has been&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; leaked out from this base? &quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson pauses.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Stanton, I need you to run an activity report on all intel =\r\nthat has come in and out&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the Ark, during the durati=\r\non of the chain of events which have happened so far.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nere may be good reason to be suspicious.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Straightshot looks over to the group and returns to her work at the co=\r\nmputer.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Lemme see what I can come u=\r\np with, this might take a while. I just hope Cheetor,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rh=\r\ninox and Optimus Primal are still in one piece.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Nightshift limps along side Bump and looks up to him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Thanks for the encouragement, we can use eve=\r\nrything we got now. Slaag, if it&#39;s true&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that we got a mo=\r\nle on board, we&#39;re done for. But it looks like the big boss kinda knows&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who it could be. Check out Tucson&#39;s body language, his tail=\r\n tapp&#39;n the ground, his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stiff gait, and that little snar=\r\nl on the snout. He does that when he smells someth&#39;n that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; doesn&#39;t seem right.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson turns t=\r\no Rodimus.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I think it&#39;s best to kee=\r\np an eye on Legacy. Tell me if you see any suspicious&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be=\r\nhavior on his part. If you do, don&#39;t let him suspect that you know anything=\r\n. Just play&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; along, observe and relay back to me what you=\r\n observe. Then together with Leo&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prime, we can decide wh=\r\nat action may need to be done. I think this is long overdue. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He salutes Rodimus and heads to the med bay.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Agreed.&quot;=\r\n RODIMUS said as he glanced at LEGACY and then back at&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; TUCSON=\r\n, &quot;We need to keep an optic on him. I have not had a chance to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; know him well, perhaps Lord Elder can help you with details about him,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; he has been around him the longest.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; Meanwhile SANTON, BUMP and LEGACY have all made their way to the medical=\r\n bay.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If LEGACY is the least bit uncomfortable=\r\n with all the optics watching&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; him and all the suspicious look=\r\ns being directed his way there is not a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; shred of it visable o=\r\nn his cold faceplate. Instead he is his typical&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; efficient sel=\r\nf as he walked over to a console and began to feed in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; informa=\r\ntion.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If you two will get up on the medical b=\r\neds.&quot; SANTON said, &quot;We can see&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; if we can get this over with a=\r\ns fast as possible.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the same time BUMP was=\r\n looking at LEGACY in a speculative manner&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; saying nothing.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Rattrap nods and gets into beast mode.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &quot; I wonder what Cybertron&#39;s gonna be like when we get home.. Proba=\r\nbly not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same as we remember it. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson looks to Talon and gently rubs his head against =\r\nhers, minding his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; snout . Dragons had ways of expressing=\r\n their love for their mates and what&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he was doing was no=\r\n different. His feelings were definitely real, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nothi=\r\nng would ever change that. But as he closes his eyes for a moment, a&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; vision comes into play. The single optic, staring down at him,=\r\n as he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flashbacks to earlier days when he was just an Au=\r\ntobot. A red optic, and a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gun pointed right at him! And =\r\na familiar face. SHOCKWAVE.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It shocks=\r\n him with a bit of a gasp. He looks at Legacy and then back to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Talon.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Shockwave. I was almo=\r\nst destroyed by him vorns ago, back on Cybertron. I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knew=\r\n it, that&#39;s where I&#39;ve seen bots of Legacy&#39;s kind. It&#39;s part of a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; memory I thought I lost when I was taken off line and blinded.&quot;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEO PR=\r\nIME had walked up as well, &quot;Yes he does bear a resemblance to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Shockwave doesn&#39;t he, the same single optic, the same cold way about&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; him.&quot; LEO didn&#39;t look all that trusting either.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; There was a nod from LORD ELDER, &quot;Yes, but he has done more to p=\r\nrotect&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; this Ark then most of us put together.&quot; ELDER was talk=\r\ning about when&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; he defnded the ARK against the UNICRONIANS all=\r\n by himself.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ELDER glanced at LEGACY and then =\r\nback at LEO and TUCSON, &quot;But perhaps&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; this is not the best pla=\r\nce to discuss this. Perhaps when we have a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; little more privac=\r\ny.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meawnhile LEGACY continued to enter in cod=\r\nes to the medical computer.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; windlord looked at the Maximal command=\r\ners and said &quot;then we are leaving to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; track Tarantulus an=\r\nd the humans&quot; then looking at Rattrap and Percetpor said&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Let&#39;s go&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; RODIMUS PRIMAL on the other hand walked back away from the ARK and&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; gestured to RAT TRAP, WINDLORD and PERCEPTOR, &quot;Okay, Windlord =\r\nand&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor, you two direct us to where you saw the humans =\r\nand let&#39;s see&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; what we can find.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n (TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/bloc=\r\nkquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-7DDE64DB-B4BF-4C6D-B160-DCD2A8F6B37A--\r\n\n"}}
