He still wanted to know more.Lunarpine \nunderstood himself, even though he wasn&#39;t complete, &quot;I&#39;m a survivor, \na hunter, a killer.&quot; Searching through his datatracks he \nrealized, &quot;Add arogance and I&#39;d be a Predicon.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; This was  one question that she hadn&#39;t even asked herself yet.  She \n&gt; took a moment to comtemplate this question.  She searched her spark \n&gt; and found the answer.  &quot;I am a Recon bot. I follow my spark as well \n&gt; as orders. No, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a leader. At least I have had no \n&gt; cchance to lead yet.&quot; She looked at him for a moment.  She knew \nthat \n&gt; in order to accomplish any type of training or gain in skills, she \n&gt; would have to put her feeling for him aside. She thought that being \na \n&gt; ffighter was out of the question right now.  She knew that he was \n&gt; right about one thing, she would have to find herself before \nanything \n&gt; else could happen for her.  &quot;I will return after a few hours.&quot;  \n&gt; She started to walk to the entrance of the base.  She stopped and \n&gt; turned around. She looked at Lunarpine. &quot;And I will return this \n&gt; time.&quot; She smiled and walked out.  She transformed into her\n&gt;  owl mode and flew off.\n&gt; \n&gt; She went to a small grove near the base.  She sat and meditated on \n&gt; the words that Lunarpine had used. &quot;Fighter? No, that I am not. \n&gt; Lover? That one will have to wait. Follower? Yes, that I am. I do \n&gt; follow my commanders. Leader? No, that I am not.&quot;  She went through \n&gt; her systems and programming.  She downloaded a Scout program that \nshe \n&gt; didn&#39;t realize that she had.  She gained a little more confidence \nin \n&gt; herself.  She realized that all bots must work within the means \nthat \n&gt; they have.  She stayed perched in the tree and wathced the sun \nset.  \n&gt; She was feeling better, about everthing.  Even though Lunarpine had \n&gt; not taught her to fight, he taught her something about herself.  \nShe \n&gt; smiled at the thought.  She watched the sunset with a new attitude \n&gt; and better train of thought. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine knew the question would be asked sooner or later, he \njust \n&gt; &gt; wanted to hear her ask. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can, you seem \ndistracted \n&gt; &gt; with me around.&quot; He wasn&#39;t entirely serious but she needed to be \n&gt; kept \n&gt; &gt; in place. Lunarpine sensed her feelings toward him, those would \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; to be tossed aside before she could take him seriously.&quot;You can&#39;t \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; taught, you already have everything you need, you just need to \n&gt; &gt; download it from inside yourself.&quot; The wolf in him knew he \ncouldn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; teach her to fly, but he&#39;d be slaged before he saw her quit on \n&gt; &gt; herself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;The great leaders didn&#39;t get taught to be great, the great \n&gt; fighters \n&gt; &gt; weren&#39;t taught to fight, either it&#39;s there or it&#39;s not. I can&#39;t \nsee \n&gt; &gt; your spark, so tell me, what are you, a lover, a fighter, a \nleader, \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; follwer? WHAT ARE YOU?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That was the one question she had to overcome before she could \n&gt; reach \n&gt; &gt; her full potential.\n\n\n"}}
