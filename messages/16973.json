It was stupidity, but courage as \nwell. But this was his mission. And he was done with it. It was time \nto give it to another. He held back Child.\n\n&quot;No Child. This is what I must do. The cycle has come full circle. \nYou haven&#39;t been realizing it, but you&#39;ve been training yourself. I \nthought my purpose was too free Cybertron, but I was wrong. That is \nyour job, Child. My job was to guide and look after. And now it&#39;s \ndone. Go to your father Child. Tell him I apologize for keepig him \nfrom you. Tell him of everything that has happened here. If the \nSkyschorchers and the new three want to go with you, they can, but \nthey are not obligated to. Tell Battera and Cybershark the same. They \nare finally free. I just wish I could have said goodbye properly.&quot; He \nput a bubble of energy around all the others on his side.\n\n&quot;This will take you out of the mountain safely. I am taking the evil \nones away with me. Most of them will rot in the pitt forever. If they \nsurvive, than they will no that Peace conquers evil. Good-bye my \nfriends. I hope to see you all in The Matrix some day.&quot;\n\nHe made the bubble disapear, and it reapeared just outside the \nmountain. He sent a quick thought into all of their minds.\n\n&quot;Go quickly now. There isn&#39;t much time. I love you all .good-bye&quot;\n\nHe turned his attention to the evil ones.\n\n&quot;Now you will all pay for the things that you have commited.&quot; Vulois \nchanneled every last piece of energy he had into one system. When he \nset it off, the explosion would be hideous, &quot;There is no time for \nescape now. Computer, 5 second count down to self-destruct. \nBegin....now!&quot;\n\nAs the seconds ticked away, so did Vulois&#39; life. \n\n                          \n\n\n                          5....4...\n\n\n"}}
