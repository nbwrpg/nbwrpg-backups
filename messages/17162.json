The defences were watching them carefully, but Unitron was \nright, it would not be a good idea to trust them with anything important. \nZardus silently chuckles to himself. He didn&#39;t trust anyone too much. That \nwas why all the Alliance base&#39;s functions had a direct link to his wrist \ncomputer, so he could keep watch and regulate any trouble back at the base.\n\nHe stops by a set of doors. &quot;This one is yours, Hot Rod,&quot; he says to Hot Rod, \npushing a button to make a door slide aside, revealing the typical Alliance \nquarters. He turns to the door across the hall, opening it as well, \n&quot;Cybershark, this one is yours.&quot;\n\nThe rooms were about the same size, and had furnishings from Reptilica&#39;s and \nBloodystrike&#39;s old base (Hot Rod and Cybershark, you guys can design them as \nyou wish).\n\n&quot;You can make yourself at home or explore the base. But be carefull, the \ndefences are watching you. Any weaponfire or sudden cloaking will result in \nlockdown in the area, and injury or death. If you have any questions, contact \nme.&quot;\n\nZardus turns to Feline. &quot;I believe you have information for me... Come.&quot;\n\nHe turns around, walking off toward the CR chambers.\n\n"}}
