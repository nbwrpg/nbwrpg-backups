She could see that he \ndisapproved of her choice in pets.  She smiled, &quot;I know it&#39;s a little \nodd for a mouse like me to have a pet rat.  But Akura is a nice pet.  \nhe may even come in handy if I can train him right.&quot;  She left with \nthe rat on her shoulder and went into the lab to fix up a cage for \nthe rat.  She found the materials and started making the cage.\n\nAfter a bit, she had a nice 2 foot, by 3 foot, by 3 foot cage \ncomplete with wheel and tunnels for Akura to run through.  She put \nhim in the cage and took the cage to her console and set it next to \nthe main screen.  She smiled and watched him run in his new home.  \nThen she went about scanning again. Only this time, no rats were \nchewing on her wiring to mess it up.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike glared at Dark Mouse with one bright crimson optic \nsquinted. He \n&gt; thought it was rather odd to keep a pet rat, but everyone had their \nhobbies. \n&gt; He frowned a little. Rats were more food to him than pets.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well, alright,&quot; he said lowly. &quot;Jus&#39; make sure t&#39; keep &#39;im in that \ncage.&quot; \n&gt; He looked at Stingtra. &quot;We still goin&#39;?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
