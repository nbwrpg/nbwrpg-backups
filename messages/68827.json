They are silent and deadly, \ntrained hunt=\r\ner terminators their optic sensors have no trouble \npenetrating the darknes=\r\ns emptiness of the ship. Their audio sensors \ncapturing the smallest sound =\r\nand whisper that echoed through. \n\nScourge fretted about the fact that as c=\r\nlose as he was to his quarry, \nhe still could not break through the interfe=\r\nrence that hid his prey \nfrom him. \n\n&gt; ::Dark Rodimus::\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rodimus unplu=\r\ngs from the pod.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rodimus: I&#39;ll try.

He is in\n&gt; route to the office.\n\nScourge froze as he thought he heard =\r\na slight noise coming from ahead \nof him in the corridor, on the way toward=\r\ns the bridge. With a motion \nhe commanded the single sweep with him to halt=\r\n. ((OOC: the other \nsweeps are around the ship)). \n\nSlyly peering around th=\r\ne corner Scourge could see the form of Rodimus \nwalking ahead of them, furt=\r\nher along, also on his way towards the \nbridge. \n\nWith a slight smile Scour=\r\nge lifted his weapon and targeted Rodimus as \na single red targeting laser =\r\n`painted&#39; Rodimus&#39; back . . . \n\nPreston\n(Scourge & Sweeps)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
