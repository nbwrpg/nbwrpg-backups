She stared at the ship that was unlike the \nship that belonged to Megatron. It was Predacon base, so Injector told her. \nShe thought to herself that the ship may have failed---but where did this \none come from? She cocked her head, looking at it. She even wondered if it \nreconized her as the enemy. There was one way to find out.\n\nShe slowly flew forward, her feet a short distance from the ground. The \nauto-guns didn&#39;t target her. It may have reconized her signature. She went \nforward until she was inside. The looked around the interior. She couldn&#39;t \nremember the last time she was inside a Predacon vessel. She felt like a \nwild animal in a feral place. A part of her wanted out. Fast.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
