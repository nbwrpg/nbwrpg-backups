However, if from what you have told me, be as\nlittle as possible as it may have been, I will endevour to\nsuccessfully remove this, erhm, thing from your beloved.&quot;  She tried\nto as a little flair to her performance, hoping to the Matrix that it\nmight instill a little confidence in Rodimus that she might actually\nknow more than she did. It wasn&#39;t that she wasn&#39;t really smart, she\nwas. But this would be her first mission, so to speak. And she wasn&#39;t\ngoing to let anything come between her and success.

She let her optics look closer at Rodimus.\n&gt;   Something in him reminded her of someone. Someone from her past.\n&gt;   Someone she respected and honored. She smiled back at him with a smile\n&gt;   that reflected the relief she felt just by knowing he thought all was\n&gt;   alright.\n\n\n\n"}}
