That&#39;s how we \n&gt; &gt; know about the energon remember.  I also know about the \nunderground \n&gt; &gt; river with an opening about 200 ft. long and 50 ft. wide.  And I \n&gt; also \n&gt; &gt; have the status of the engine.  Not so bad.  2 of the 3 thrusters \n&gt; will \n&gt; &gt; never run again, but I can turn them into automated cannons to \n&gt; defend \n&gt; &gt; this cave and the other one can be used to turn this shuttle into \na \n&gt; &gt; submarine.

From now on you guys can call me \n&gt; Mustex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Grey Horse:  Just call me Stallex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:  Hey what do you want to be called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Monkey:  We&#39;re more animal now than Machine.  And like animals \n&gt; we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abandoned our friends at the outpost.  Why fancy up what we \nare. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just call me Rhesus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: The question of what happened to Stallex still applies \neven \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though I changed the back story.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:  I developed a little something I called hover-cycles. \n \n&gt; &gt; They \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can go at speeds of up to 200 mph.  Thought you might like to \n&gt; &gt; know.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus presses a button and 3 come out of the storage room.  \nHe \n&gt; &gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks at the readouts of the satalite.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:  The biggest energon deposite is occupied and far \naway. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; But \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is a fair sized one about 25 miles south of here. I \nthink \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still get enough thrust to get the shuttle there, but not to \n&gt; land \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.  Believe me when this is over salvage will be the only use \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this shuttle.So we better take the hover-cycles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus launches it toward the deposit (no one touch it it&#39;s \n&gt; mine) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they take off on the cycles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A shuttle plumets towards earth.
