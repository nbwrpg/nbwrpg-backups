You never accept \ndamage.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Inside  the Chivtron base, one of the CR chambers begins to make a \nbeeping \n&gt; sound. The doors then open and with a whoosh of steam a Blue and \nwhite Robot \n&gt; steps from it. The figures wings curl around him as a white metal \nfeather \n&gt; falls to the ground. He hears the sounds of battle coming from \noutside and \n&gt; his optics begin to glow a bright green. He quickly runs through the \nhalls of \n&gt; the base as he heads to the exit which he reaches in a few short \nminutes. he \n&gt; then presses a button causing the door open just enough for him to \nslide out \n&gt; through which he does before it closes again. Once out in the \nsunlight the \n&gt; bot is revealed to be... Zero, the Maximal who had helped the \nChivtrons in \n&gt; the last battle they were in against the Decepticons only to be \nplaced into \n&gt; Stasis lock by his brother. He looks around and catches a glipse of \n&gt; Shadowstar and Luzbel.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zero: &quot;I&#39;ve been in the CR chamber too long. This base is under \nattack \n&gt; again... now I must help.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zero quickly flys up to Prowl and Shadowstar and draws his beam \nsabre which \n&gt; he uses to slash at Shadowstar as he charges at prowl.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zero: &quot;Need some help?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
