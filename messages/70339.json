With his warning shot made, he rolls forward on h=\r\nis wheels with the light damage not effecting his engine nor his wheels. He=\r\n wasn&#39;t ready to quit, not by any means. Small damage were like moon pebble=\r\ns under his tires, simply roll with them and roll over them.\n&gt;\n&gt; The truck =\r\ncontinues his relentless push forward.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hit me all you want, I&#39;m not g=\r\noing anywhere except forward. We came here to retrieve our comrade, no matt=\r\ner what slag you throw at us. That is all we want, nothing more nothing les=\r\ns. We are not here to take over anything or anyone. Let us find Rodimus, an=\r\nd bring him home, and we will leave you undesturbed.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; talon hold back a=\r\n moan and she continue to firing gainst the insect like aliens.\n\nThe move f=\r\noward by Tuscon is successful. Although Talon&#39;s shot misses\nits intended ta=\r\nrget, it instead hitting high and wide, Legacy&#39;s shot\nfinds its mark hittin=\r\ng the insect square in the chest and sending it\nflying back into the wall. =\r\nIt lands with a crunching sound and slides\nto the ground, its optics comple=\r\ntely dull.\n\nMeanwhile the rest of the troopers surge foward! however due to=\r\n the\nextensive armor plating of Tuscon and his grim determination, they\npus=\r\nh through with only a modicum of trouble. The insects leap after\nTuscon, bu=\r\nt thier blades slide inaffectually along his armor, cutting\nonly into his p=\r\naint job, but little else. They are quickly left behind\nif Tuscon picks up =\r\nany speed.\n\nThe road ahead looks clear. all the way to the main chamber abo=\r\nut a\nhalf a mile away where Rodimus and presumably where what the insectoid=\r\n\naliens called the misstress resides.\n\nThe ground rumbled for a moment, and=\r\n then a blast of cool air rolled\ndown the tunnel, but all else was quiet.\n\n=\r\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: Sorry, I had to type this one out fast :)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
