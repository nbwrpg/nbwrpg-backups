He paced back and \nforth, glaring at Techy and Sky Knight coldy. Even through the thick \nplexi-glass window, they could hear him snarling. He bared his white \nteeth at them while he was at it.\n\nTechy stared in concern. She tried to give him a confident look. The \nonly time he stayed in his cell was when he slept. He didn&#39;t like it \nwhen the scientists put him in it for tests.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s all right Beserk,&quot; Techy said to him. &quot;Power down.&quot;\n\nBeserk groaned, his teeth still bared. He began to calm down. Techy \nstepped closer to the plex-glass. &quot;We want you to do something,&quot; she \nsaid to him. &quot;We want you to show us how well you fight. Can you do \nthat?&quot; Beserk squinted at her.\n\nSky Knight looked to his far side. &quot;Blazer! Wanna do something with \nthose drones?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
