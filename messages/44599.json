I\n&gt; dont really care what \n&gt; you think of me. As far as im concerned your opinion\n&gt; of me does not matter. \n&gt; Although I do find that your comment about\n&gt; &quot;denominating&quot; me offensive as \n&gt; Hugar did not even bring up my name nor has anyolne\n&gt; else. It is actions like \n&gt; that that make me dislike you, when you go outright\n&gt; slandering someone \n&gt; without any provocation.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nFind a job, post your resume.\nhttp://careers.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
