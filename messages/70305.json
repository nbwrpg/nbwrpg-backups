They were corrupted twisted looking things, resembling\n&gt; something like earth insects, but oddly alien at the same time. They\n&gt; were all a brownish black, although with glints of a strange metallic\n&gt; silver here and there. They were each about as large as full grown\n&gt; lion, each creature had ten legs, six insect like &#39;walking&#39; legs, with\n&gt; barbed &#39;knees&#39; that ended with short claws extending from a large and\n&gt; powerfully built thorax. And like  a praying mantis they had an\n&gt; extended thorax, a chest like construct from which four others legs\n&gt; were attached that looked larger and more powerful. Each of these legs\n&gt; was barbed with hooks along the sides, and with forelegs that ended in\n&gt; long sharp blades! The abdomen of each creature had a long flexible\n&gt; stinger, which like a scorpion was poised for striking. They head was\n&gt; small with two large eyes and several smaller ones. However what may\n&gt; be of more interest is that instead of the chitinous shell of your\n&gt; typical creature, their &#39;shells&#39; were composed of a strange metallic\n&gt; substance.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Intruders.&quot; they hissed in unison, a strange buzzing noise\n&gt; accompanying their movements as they quickly moved forward. &quot;They must\n&gt; be brought to the mistress!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Here is a question before we go too far in:\n&gt; \n&gt; In the past there have been instances where folks have been ignoring\n&gt; attacks from others. IE: Person A attacks person B, but person B just\n&gt; poses talking with someone else and then attacks back without posing\n&gt; the results of the attack from Person A, and they go through the\n&gt; battle with seemingly no hits or battle damage.\n&gt; \n&gt; So do you want me to GM the hits/misses/results or do you want to keep\n&gt; track of that yourselves? I am open either way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
