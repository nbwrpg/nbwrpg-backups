I don&#39;t \nthink they went through any transwarp portal or anything, but they wern&#39;t too \noutdated when they emerged 4 mil years later because the war was taking too \nmuch of Cybertron&#39;s and the Cybertronians&#39; resources and time for them to \nmake any technological progress. I think at one point there were only about \n100 bots total on Cybertron, and 100 bots whose time is taken up killing each \nother, wouldn&#39;t have too much time to invent new things. The war did, after \nall, sap all of Cybertron&#39;s resources and ended its golden age, so why \ncouldn&#39;t it stop technological advances as well?\n\nAlthough I believe that when the Autobots and Decepticons were awakened \ntranswarp technology was being developed. I guess that&#39;s a step forward.\n\n\nGlad to see you&#39;re alive, Firefox!\n\n\nGood night everyone.\n\n"}}
