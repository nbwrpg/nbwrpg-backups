The weapons were only\n&gt; as good as the skills behind them.  Nightshift gives a casual nod and smile.\n&gt;  He was actually content with his comrade&#39;s answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Very well put, Wolfgang.  Exactly what Master Yokitron would&#39;ve said.\n&gt; Anyway looks like it&#39;s Show time and half the cast hasn&#39;t made it ta the\n&gt; stage just yet.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Nightshift looks out, a shimmer of something a very shinny silver,\n&gt; catches his optic from out the corner of his right lense.  He turns quickly\n&gt; and points in the direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Whoa, anyone catch that?  It was a silver flash, about eight hundred\n&gt; breams in that direction.   The only bot I know who shines like that is\n&gt; Tucson.&quot;\n\nOOC: The trees climb to a hundred feet into the air with a fairly\ndense canopy, it would not be possible to see Tuscon from where they\nwere unless he were to fly quite high. And then once the group enters\nthe jungle even that wont be possible unless they are in a clearing\nand Tuscon is almost right over them.\n\n&lt;Back In Character&gt;\n\nPOLAR CLAW nodded as he stepped out of the shuttle and looked at\nNIGHTSHIFT strangely, &quot;I saw something before we landed. That is the\ndirection that we are headed.\n\nAfter a moment PROWL came out of the shuttle as well as RAMULUS and\nWOLFGANG each of them being handed a small pack by PROWL.\n\nPOLAR CLAW threw a small pack at NIGHTSHIFT, expecting him to catch\nit. &quot;Its energon rations.&quot; He said by way of explaination. &quot;I don&#39;t\nrecall seeing any refueling stations in there.&quot;\n\nAround them the trees were rising up to nearly one hundred feet into\nthe air with a dense canopy of leaves and limbs. The sounds of animals\nand birds could be heard coming from within the jungle.\n\nLooking at the uneven and even treacherous terrain once they got\nfurther into the jungle POLAR CLAW looked back at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;You\ndon&#39;t look like you will do well in here, you sure you want to come\nwith us?&quot;\n\nSure enough there was a path leading in, and at the moment it was flat\nenough, but all too soon in the distance one could easily see the path\ngetting more and more dangerous with tree roots and other natural\nobstacles getting in the way.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
