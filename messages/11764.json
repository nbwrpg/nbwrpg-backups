Would it ever \ncome to an end?  Would the Keepers and Vulois be its downfall?  Or would \nCybertrons be doomed to wage war forever.  A transformer can could live for \nmillions of years, but they hardly achieve that great age.  Many die far too \nyoung or far too soon.  His thoughts then turned the two new bots, Feline and \nSkulletron.  He still didnt understand why they seemed so suspicious, but \nthey did. He decides to take a rest, so he lies down and sleeps::\n\n"}}
