The \nhum of the scanner causing soothing vibrations through his body.\n\nHe tranformed back to bot and started to follow her back to the CR \nroom. He heard what she said about being a wolf. &quot;You&#39;re what?&quot; \nLunarpine didn&#39;t know exactly what to think, &quot;Just what are you \nthinking?&quot; He was beginning to get upset &quot;Why the Pit would you want \nto do something like that for?&quot; \n\nHe decided to let her explain herself before he jumped to conclusions.\n\n(These two should be a couple, they&#39;re either loving each other or \narguing about something.)\n(One of these days Shadow Wing POW To the Moon:)\nI gotta go do laundry, we&#39;ll pick up this argument later.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She turns on the scanner and scans Lunarpine.\n&gt; &quot;Great!

She just couldn&#39;t hold it in any longer.\n&gt; &quot;IF all works well, I&#39;ll be a wolf in no time flat!&quot; She turned and \n&gt; started to head to the CR chamber room.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:( If this is not a legal move, then Shadow Wing will have to go \n&gt; out and find a real wolf to scan.

It&#39;d take eons to pick up the pieces. You&#39;ll need to \n&gt; find \n&gt; &gt; one of the techbots for that.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He figured that she&#39;d be disapointed for whatever reason she \nneeded \n&gt; &gt; the hookup. he transformed back to his wolf form for the scans. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Just a thought, if the scanners could replicate transformed DNA \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; in the show Air Razor wouldn&#39;t have had to wait for a compatible \n&gt; &gt; lifeform, it would have used Rhinox or Cheetor so ask someone \nelse \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; this moves legal first.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I know will sound strange, but I need to scna you while in \nbeast \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mode.
