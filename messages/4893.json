Once Iron Raptor was far enough ahead Tavatron broke into a wild sprint, her paws pounding on the soft dirt. She found herself wishing Dinobot was running beside her, she didn&#39;t know why, but she felt... safer when he was around. Tavatron shook her head mid-sprint. No time to worry about that now. Not when a &#39;bots life was hanging in the balance.\n\nTavatron slowed to a jog once the cliff came into view, looming against the darkening horizon. She blinked several times, trying to slow her racing spark:\n\n&quot;Maximize.&quot; \n\nTavatron whispered the command, hoping Bronco would not become aware of her presence. She crouched behind a low boulder, her drill sword drawn, just in case. She was far enough away so that she shouldn&#39;t even register on her commander&#39;s scanners, but close enough so that she could keep a sharp eye on both Iron Raptor and Bronco.\n\nTavatron sniffed the air, something about this didn&#39;t seem right. It ahd been too easy to get here. The Alliance, the Preds, no one had interfered with them. Perhaps the uneasy truce had held, for now. \n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
