Let me try to answer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, we need to know where our storylines are going. Also, we \n&gt; need to see what we can do to actually have more posts.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that we could use a different forum, but we don&#39;t have \naccess \n&gt; to a board of our own. If anyone could help us for that, it would \nbe \n&gt; great. So, since in game posting slows down a lot during the \n&gt; holidays, we thought that it might be a good thing to organize a \nRPG \n&gt; discussion period at that time.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this clears any uncertainties. If you have suggestions, feel \n&gt; free to share them!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&gt; &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Uh, I just got here. But if I have a vote, what are the issues to \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; discussed?  Personally, I&#39;d either post the issues and then go a \n&gt; chat \n&gt; &gt; room or message board and discuss them, or something else.  \nPosting \n&gt; &gt; seems slow as it is. But, that is just my opinion.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shadowess_Azogoth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Enter your vote today!
