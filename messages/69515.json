He was feeling the effects even in vehicle=\r\n mode.  Once transformed he could feel that it would be extremely difficult=\r\n to transform back into robot mode.  He decided that going back to robot mo=\r\nde would be better, because there was a great chance that Lamia&#39;s venom had=\r\n effected his transformation card.\n\nWith an even greater effort, he slowly =\r\ngets back into robot mode, barely able to make the last phase of the transf=\r\normation.\n\n&quot;Slag.  That - wasn&#39;t a good idea.  If - I remained in my alt fo=\r\nrm there - wouldn&#39;t have been any way to - access the correct circuitry for=\r\n the - repairs.&quot;\n\nThere was no doubt about it, Lamia&#39;s venom was affecting =\r\nhim. Yet, he didn&#39;t want to seem too helpless either.  He finds the strengt=\r\nh to get on his knees and pauses there for a moment.  At this time his proc=\r\nessor was spinning a million miles per second, as a wave of dizziness hits =\r\nhim with enough of a punch to knock him back down on his left side.  He cat=\r\nches his fall.  \n\n&quot;Better - stand back Talon.  I - don&#39;t want to fall on to=\r\np of you.&quot;  \n\nHe gets back on his knees and this time, plants his left foot=\r\n firmly on the ground, and manages to hoist himself back up on two feet, ye=\r\nt using the wall to lean on to keep himself upright.  By hell and high wate=\r\nr he was going to walk on that ramp on his own two feet.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Dont do an excessive =\r\neffort&quot; said Talon &quot;We dont know what that worm can do with her vemon&quot; she =\r\nopened a com link and said&quot;Lord Persus, i need to speak with you... in priv=\r\nate&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Sandy \n&gt; Sent: Friday, January 15, 2010 8:52 AM\n&gt; To: nb=\r\nwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: The Old Maximal Base/Unicron&#39;s come ba=\r\nck\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Tucson could not help but smile at Talon&#39;s complement.
