They&#39;re going to\n  church!\n  They&#39;re leading the world, and their empire is\n  thriving,\n  I MUST keep the S&#39;s and U&#39;s from surviving!&quot;\n\n  Tomorrow, he knew, all the U&#39;s and the S&#39;s,\n  Would put on their pants and their shirts and their\n  dresses,\n  They&#39;d go to their offices, playgrounds and schools,\n  And abide by their U and S values and rules,\n\n  And then they&#39;d do something he liked least of all,\n  Every U down in U-ville, the tall and the small,\n  Would stand all united, each U and each S,\n  And they&#39;d sing Uville&#39;s anthem, &quot;God bless us! God\n  bless!&quot;\n  All around their Twin Towers of Uville, they&#39;d stand,\n  and their voices would drown every sound in the land.\n\n  &quot;I must stop that singing,&quot; Binch said with a smirk,\n  And he had an idea--an idea that might work!\n  The Binch stole some U airplanes in U morning hours,\n  And crashed them right into the Uville Twin Towers.\n  &quot;They&#39;ll wake to disaster!&quot; he snickered, so sour,\n  &quot;And how can they sing when they can&#39;t find a tower?&quot;\n\n   The Binch cocked his ear as they woke from their\n  sleeping,\n  All set to enjoy their U-wailing and weeping,\n  Instead he heard something that started quite low,\n  And it built up quite slow, but it started to grow--\n  And the Binch heard the most unpredictable thing...\n  And he couldn&#39;t believe it--they started to sing!\n\n   He stared down at U-ville, not trusting his eyes,\n  What he saw was a shocking, disgusting surprise!\n  Every U down in U-ville, the tall and the small,\n  Was singing! Without any towers at all!\n\n   He HADN&#39;T stopped U-Ville from singing! It sung!\n  For down deep in the hearts of the old and the young,\n  Those Twin Towers were standing, called Hope and\n  called Pride, And you can&#39;t smash the towers we hold deep inside.\n\n   So we circle the sites where our heroes did fall,\n  With a hand in each hand of the tall and the small,\n  And we mourn for our losses while knowing we&#39;ll cope,\n  For we still have inside that U-Pride and U-Hope.\n\n   For America means a bit more than tall towers,\n  It means more than wealth or political powers,\n  It&#39;s more than our enemies ever could guess,\n  So may God bless America! Bless us! God bless!\n\n   Rob Suggs, is a children&#39;s author and illustrator in Atlanta.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n"}}
