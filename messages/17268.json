I\ndon&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; think they went through any transwarp portal or anything, but they\nwern&#39;t\n&gt; too\n&gt; &gt; outdated when they emerged 4 mil years later because the war was taking\n&gt; too\n&gt; &gt; much of Cybertron&#39;s and the Cybertronians&#39; resources and time for them\nto\n&gt; &gt; make any technological progress. I think at one point there were only\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; 100 bots total on Cybertron, and 100 bots whose time is taken up killing\n&gt; each\n&gt; &gt; other, wouldn&#39;t have too much time to invent new things. The war did,\n&gt; after\n&gt; &gt; all, sap all of Cybertron&#39;s resources and ended its golden age, so why\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t it stop technological advances as well?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although I believe that when the Autobots and Decepticons were awakened\n&gt; &gt; transwarp technology was being developed. I guess that&#39;s a step forward.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Glad to see you&#39;re alive, Firefox!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Good night everyone.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
