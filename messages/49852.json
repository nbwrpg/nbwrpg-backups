I think its best you keep your \nmemory, I need \n&gt; you to remmeber always where your loyalty is. Do not dissapoint me \nyou have \n&gt; so much potential. Now go and get in ur pod. We&#39;ll launch you far \nout of \n&gt; thier sensors so they cant tell u didnt fall from space.   You&#39;ll \nthen land \n&gt; safely infront of the tripred base and get rescuded. Just make the \nblack \n&gt; light go around to make it look like ur scanning for a beast mode. \nQuilldart \n&gt; over there is installing a cover signal so all theyd be able to \ntrace is a \n&gt; protoform until ur ready to get out. Whenever ur ready my little \ntemptress.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
