But this is the only way.\n&gt; If I put the bomb anywhere else, it will only destroy a section of\n&gt; the ship, and some could live. On the engine, it would set off a\n&gt; chain reaction making the entire ship go up. And if I leave, they&#39;ll\n&gt; know about it and look for it. Believe me sir, if there was anyway I\n&gt; could get out of this I would. But it&#39;s the only way to ensure entire\n&gt; Predacon destruction.
