They weren&#39;t \ninterested in the repair chambers, their wounds were nearly healed thanks to \ninternal repairs with a boost from Vok technology.\n\n---\n\nSixshot and Ares walked into the Alliance base, heading for the CR chambers.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch and Manterror headed for the Iron Fist, while Injector and \nBumblebee headed for the Alliance base&#39;s CR chambers.\n\n---\n\nMinion and Chaos, rather battered, walked over to Demolition, their fellow \nWar Machine member.  &quot;Should we go see our leader?&quot; Chaos asked.\n\n---\n\nScattershot helped Nemesis keep up from his wounds, heading for the Iron Fist \nat a slow pace.\n\n---\n\nUnitron directed the bounty hunters towards the Alliance base, a sharp pain \npiercing into his head, but the cool metallic experssion that was normally on \nUnitron&#39;s face remained.  He ignored the pain, heading for the Alliance base \nhimself.  Though internal repairs could take care of the light damage he had, \nhe prefered to get it out of the way quickly.\n\n======\n\nHot Spot looked to the two downed Protectobots and decided to skip the \npleasantries and motioned for Streetwise, who was carrying First Aid&#39;s legs \nwhile he himself had his arms, to follow him.  They walked into the \nCybertronian Fire, heading for the CR chambers.\n\nHot Spot had memorized the plans for the ship before setting out on the \nmission...in case drastic things had to be done.  Seeing Groove holding \nBlades and follow him, Hot Spot was slightly relieved.\n\n---\n\nChordate looked around, transforming to his beaver mode and heading for the \nCF.  He was much to embarrassed at screwing things up royally to deal with \nany of his comrades.\n\n"}}
