The distant sound of someone or something playing hard on an \nelectric guitar or two.\n\nThe Predacon turned another corner, a dead end.  He looked around, the once \nfaint sound getting louder and louder.  Full of fear, he began pounding on \nthe wall that blocked his path.  A stronger robot might&#39;ve been able to smash \nhis way through and continue on.  Or a robot with a jetpack or boosters \nwould&#39;ve been able to fly to safety.  But this Predacon had none of those.\n\nHe reached into subspace, taking out his laser rifle and turning around, \nactivating his comm. unit.  &quot;This is Alabastor!  All Defcons get over here!  \nThey&#39;re after me!  Hurry the slag up!&quot; he screamed into his shoulder comm. \nunit to his other gang members but got no reply.  He raised his pistol as he \nsaw something move and fired off a single bolt, the superheated laser digging \ninto the wall and leaving a small burned dent.\n\nHe focused, on realized it was nothing.  Just his imagination, but he was \nstill frantic.  &quot;I&#39;m dead...I&#39;m dead...&quot; he said looking around, formulating \na quick scheme.  He put away his rifle and took out his energon knife, \nclimbing up on a couple stacked boxes and leaping, stabbing his blade into \nthe wall.  It worked, as he was hanging on by the blade a few feet off the \nground.  \n\nHe reached his free arm up as far as it would go, pulling himself slowly when \nsuddenly a sound that reminded him of laser rang out and a burning sensation \nsuddenly started in his back.  Alabastor lost his grip and fell in pain, \nslamming to the ground.\n\nHe shook his head, slowly getting to his feet, as painful as it was with the \nwound in his back, the electric guitar riffs over.  He looked around, \nspotting three robots.  \n\n&quot;You bastards...&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up, Alabastor.  We wouldn&#39;t suggest trying to call your friends.  \nThey&#39;re all dead.&quot;\n\n&quot;Wh--&quot;\n\n&quot;No, shut up.  I wasn&#39;t finished quite yet.  You see,&quot; the robot said, \nbeginning a small little tune on his electric guitar, which obviously wasn&#39;t \nplugged into anything so Alabastor was a little confused how he was playing \nit, but that was his least cocnern.\n\n&quot;You see,&quot; the robot continued, &quot;you tried to muscle in on our turf.  But you \ndidn&#39;t count on us, so we whiped you out.&quot;\n\n&quot;Most definately.  It was cake, man.&quot; one of the other robots said.\n\n&quot;Hey, shut up, man.&quot; the original robot said.  &quot;Anyway, long story short, we \ndon&#39;t like it, you betrayed us, and now you can die.&quot;\n\n&quot;But I didn&#39;t do it!  It was one of my Lieutenants!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; the robot said, starting with a complete riff on his guitar, \nturning a few dials, &quot;we don&#39;t really care.&quot; he snickered, playing a quick \nhard riff, sonic waves tearing through the air towards Alabastor, Alabastor \nscreaming in pain as he scratched at his insides, suddenly blowing up.\n\n&quot;That dude was lame.&quot;\n\n&quot;Most definately.&quot;\n\n"}}
