Her eyes brightened at the thought of her friend still \nbeing alive.  But she didn&#39;t want to face him yet.  She was afraid that he \nmight not forgive her.  He had every reason to not forgive her for her \ncowardly actions.\n&quot;No.&quot;\n\n\n--------Original Message-------\n&gt;From: Dachande85@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n&gt;::CyberShark::\n&gt;\n&gt;     He walked down a hall, he could see the hope in her eyes. Opening the\n&gt;door the Magmatron&#39;s officehe wasn&#39;t there.\n&gt;     &quot;Magmatron, this is CyberShark, what is your location.&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;I&#39;m on my way in, but first I need to go back and yell at the fool\n&gt;Bobertron for what he did.&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;Have you found any trace of the bots yet?&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;You can go and look, because I&#39;ve been busy.&quot;\n&gt;     He went into the Communications room and looked at the screen. He saw \n&gt;the\n&gt;readouts.\n&gt;     &quot;It seems that Terminess has been destroyed, but it seems that Vulois \n&gt;is\n&gt;still alive. He is no where near the Predacon base either. Would you like \n&gt;me\n&gt;to take you there?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________\n&gt;::Magmatron::\n&gt;\n&gt;     Flying back to Cheetor he found Bobertron.\n&gt;     &quot;Bobertron!! What are you doing?&quot; Magmatron asked, he was not very\n&gt;pleased. &quot;The Maximals will find him I am assured of it, but don&#39;t you \n&gt;think\n&gt;it would be a little suspisious if a Predacon gave them Cheetor? You didn&#39;t\n&gt;even finish the Destron Process, you are still Predacon. Return to base and\n&gt;let the Maximals find their &#39;comrade&#39;.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
