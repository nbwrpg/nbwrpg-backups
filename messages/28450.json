Bleating louder \nbecause she couldm&#39;t move forward anymore and the ash made a small hill \nbehind her when she tried to back up.\nShe was stuck there and ash was starting to fall from the tree and to her \nnose and she was too young to know how to sneeze it off.\nBeing a little tiny fox pup, it was hard to tell that she was a red now \nbecause of all the soot in her fur.\nAnd she kept whining while she struggled to move her body to try and get \naway from the trunk but she just didn&#39;t have enough controle over the \nmuscles to do anything.\nSo she kept trying and failing until her feet suddeny left the ground after \nsome weird sound. (when Starice talked picked her up)Her tiny paws moving in \nuncontroled spasms to try and get something solid under them.\nBut it was only seconds before she could feel warmth (Starice&#39;s arms) and \nher yipping gota bit softer before she snuggled into them, trying to find a \nplace to suckle like she would with her mother.\nHer nose was covered in ash so she couldn&#39;t tell if this warm thing was \nmommy, so her brain just remembered the warmth and the thought of milk and \nto suckle went right along with it.\nSo she opened her tiny mouth and tried to suckle but there wasn&#39;t anything \nto suckle from. It was just flat, so she moved in jerky little spasms to try \nand see if there was a teet somewhere else that she missed.\nBut there was nothing and she whined, her tummy feeling hunger pains.\nIn Starice&#39;s arms she lifted her head up a bit and yupped, making the \nfaintest barks and then moving her head down against to bump her nose \nagainst her arm but only because she couldn&#39;t see and was confused because \nthere was warmth and no milk to go with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
