Suddenly it was\nhit by a shot of lighting. It went down. The protoform\nwas surley doomed. But the clouds darkened as the\nspark refused to be extinquished.  Suddenly a miracle\nhappened or a nightmare. The protoform stabalized in\nits protoform. It was stuck. It slithered across the\nground. It went past a dead bot. (destructor.) It\ntransformed and took his shape. It had no weapons. Its\nonly power was to make sharp or heavy mettalic objects\nwith all it&#39;s limbs. (If anyone has seen terminator 2.\nIts the same idea) He could not speak. But he would\nlearn how to adapt thier voice soon enough. He walked\namilesly. His past gone. His future uncertain. (Anyone\nwho wants to recruit him....hurry up. Hopefuly megs.)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Shopping - Thousands of Stores.
