Santon c=\r\nan act\n&gt; &gt; as a field doctor with the group going out.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was =\r\na slight shrug, &quot;I will warn you though, Santon, like many\n&gt; &gt; medics, will=\r\n not take a life or even have any desire to enter combat.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW =96 WHEELI=\r\nE&gt;\n\nWheelie shook his head, &quot;There is something out there, something wrong.=\r\n  Something we do not know is going on.  This is bigger going about, I fear=\r\n what we may find out.  We shall have to take care, as we go into the jungl=\r\ne and seek out there.&quot;\n\nNodding at LEO, &quot;Then we will have to get up and ou=\r\nt we go.  We cannot leave Rodimus alone, who knows when we shall find his h=\r\nome.&quot;\n\n&lt;OLD =96 TUSCON AN DCOMMAND&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Tucson narrows an optic with a cle=\r\naring of his throat, to get the attention of everyone in the room.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot; Thank you Leo, I can explain things from here.  Of course I will not b=\r\ne sending everyone into the fray, I only intend to send those who wish to f=\r\night, onto the physical field.  Those who wish to monitor the Ark, are free=\r\n to do so.  We will use a method of command both here and at the projected =\r\nsite.  I for one am willing to go and look for Rodimus and Cyclonus.  I wil=\r\nl back you three   up from the sky, just in case an ambush does indeed foll=\r\now you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nods.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Sounds fair ta me.  Rattra=\r\np has a better nose for trouble than I do and Wheelie has the best field sk=\r\nills out of all of us.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rattrap nods.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; That&#39;s right, and=\r\n Prickles has some pretty fancy aim.  We can swing the recon part no proble=\r\nmo .  But like Leo said, only use it if we gotta defend ourselves and not t=\r\na throw the first punch.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson could already see that the three =\r\nof them would be a good fit, just by how they expressed their views.  It ma=\r\nde him smile.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; See?  It&#39;s not so bad is it?  Here you are putting=\r\n your heads together instead  of against each other.  Remember, look out fo=\r\nr yourselves and if something is way over your head, please call for help. =\r\n It isn&#39;t worth risking your lives just to try and do something on your own=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turns to Leo Prime.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; That goes for you as well.  D=\r\non&#39;t take on more than you can handle.  Now, let&#39;s meet with everyone and s=\r\nee who wants to stay and who wishes to venture out.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&lt;NEW =96 WHEELIE=\r\n&gt;\n\nWheelie glanced timidly over at Straight Shot and Rattrap.  He didn&#39;t li=\r\nke them one bit, and he felt that given RODIMUS was missing that now was no=\r\nt the time for the `learn the meaning of friendship&#39;, as someone in the pas=\r\nt he knew would have put it so belligerently.  But he knew that they could =\r\nnto put their issues aside until later, and he would have to deal with it n=\r\now to the best of his abilities, and now was not the time for being offensi=\r\nve.\n\nFor now, like it or not (probably not) the little orange racer was in =\r\nthe army, and htat meang going along with orders.  Nodding up at TUSCON, &quot;T=\r\nhen we should go and out, and find thigns before they get worse about.  Rod=\r\nimus is powerful yes, and we might lose him if we waste time abreast.&quot;\n\nNod=\r\nding at Straight Shot and Rattrap, &quot;Then we had better go, we have to get o=\r\nut fast before we lose what we know.  We have to start searching about, bef=\r\nore we lose what we&#39;re sent to find out!&quot;\n\n&lt;OLD =96 WINDLORD&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Wi=\r\nndlord arrived at the place and said at Tucson&quot;Sir, Talon has arrived at th=\r\ne base; Also I would like to know what measures woulb be taken in order to =\r\navoid dark Rodimus to lure out the basee at Nighlight and Elita&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n\n&lt;OL=\r\nD =96 TUSCON&gt;\n\n&gt; Tucson looks to Windlord with a sigh of relief.  He was ha=\r\nppy to have Talon back safe at the Ark.  He then takes a moment to collect =\r\nhis thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Let Talon know that she is more than welcome to join u=\r\ns here in the ready room.  And as far as what to expect, I&#39;m not sure but w=\r\ne should keep a bodyguard with Nightlight and Elita.  They must not leave t=\r\nhe Ark until I deem it safe to do so. &quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He leans up against the wall,=\r\n watching the computer models carefully.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; There is no easy way around=\r\n this situation, we&#39;re all in for a tough road ahead.  Now, I am not going =\r\nto force anyone into anything, I will allow everyone to make a choice that =\r\nbest suits them and the mission at hand.  And whatever they wish to do is a=\r\nlright with me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Something nudged at his logic system what would make =\r\nsomeone vanish off the ends of the Earth without a trace?  Then the answer =\r\nhis him and it hits hard.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Space bridge.....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns his hea=\r\nd sharply to Leo Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Leo, I think I know what could have happened =\r\nto Optimus Primal.\n&gt; Only a space bridge would be capable of causing a stra=\r\nnge disappearances as what happened to Primal.  Perhaps a bridge with a tim=\r\ne rift component. I wonder... Scan for rift activity, I don&#39;t know for sure=\r\n but that&#39;s what it looks like.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW =96 WHEELIE&gt;\n\nNow this had Wheelie l=\r\nooking up, whether shocked, against, or something different, &quot;NO, you don&#39;t=\r\n get it.  A Space Bridge is not small, it is not hidden.  It is huge and it=\r\n will do as bidden.  It would not make someone go bye bye without a cry, it=\r\n would be as if half the planet had bene here to die.  Believe me, if there=\r\n was one up, we would know right away.  From a column of light into space t=\r\nhat would be visible far far away.  It cannot be hidden, it is so enormous =\r\nit would do what it is bidden.&quot;\n\nGlancing up at Tuscon, &quot;There are plenty o=\r\nf things that canmadke someone go invisible and hdie.  That is far from the=\r\n top of the list, and far thigns wide.  One cannot hide a portal in space, =\r\neven from scanners, optics know their place.  We would see it, we would tel=\r\nl, we would tell the shunt shooting up to Primus knows well.  So that it is=\r\n not, that it is ridiculous, utterly and absolutely totally it gives me fit=\r\ns.  Far easier to do something like a cloak, a sensor jammer, someone steal=\r\nth whom can poke.  They could have simply blasted him offline, and carried =\r\nhim off in Beast mode this time.  So, what you suggest is the least likely =\r\nthing, likely to bring Unicron himself over to wing.  So think first before=\r\n you run an idea, and file it away in ridiculous or so I hear!&quot;  \n\nWheelie =\r\nhad been trying to be respectful and listen to orders, but at the point Tus=\r\ncon had come up with something the small Mini Vehicle thought was utterly a=\r\nbsurd, totally nonsense and the most remote thing that could have happened =\r\nthat if did they would instantly know to him was just wasting time.  His th=\r\noughts were that Tuscon wanted them to not find Rodimus, his friend, by was=\r\nting their time on such trivialities!  Standing up and ready to storm, &quot;If =\r\nyou want to waste your time, then you won&#39;t waste mine.  Withuot you then I=\r\n will go, in search of my friend and out I know.  This is stupid, this is a=\r\nbsurd, your vocalizer just wants to be heard.&quot;\n\nReady to storm out towards =\r\nthe jungle, with or without orders, with or without Straight Shot and Rattr=\r\nap.  This was Wheelie being belligerent and baiting, whether he was given o=\r\nrders or not.\n\nOOC =96 Yes, he is definitely acting out here if you want ot=\r\n put on consequences.  But also, I would figure  aspace bridge, which resul=\r\nts in a huge column of light going out into space, or a rift in reality for=\r\n a time portal would be fairly obvious, and I think Preston would have made=\r\n a point of us noticing them otherwise.  It&#39;s sort of like a nuclear bomb g=\r\noing off a few miles away =96 you don&#39;t just not be aware it exists! &#6151=\r\n4;  And fun posts Sandy and Preston, And Airlys!\n\n\n\n"}}
