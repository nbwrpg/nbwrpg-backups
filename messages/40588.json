Just\n&gt; then though, he had an idea. He turned around, and activated the \nmain\n&gt; laser cannon on the front of the ship. He looked throught the camera\n&gt; with a smile, as they hummed to life.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Sea Gulls flew calmly over the ocean, but in seconds they scattered \nfrom\n&gt; a nois, like hundreds of thunder bolts. A ray of intense heat \nemerged\n&gt; from the Hudson bay, as the Dark Avian blasted it&#39;s finest weapon. \nDue\n&gt; to not being ancored, the recoil caused the dark ship to fall back \non\n&gt; the cliff, and it began to teeter, then the weight of the ship, \nhelped\n&gt; with gravity began to plummet into the Hudson Bay. It landed with a \nhuge\n&gt; splash, sending a tital wave up, and towards the group of fighting\n&gt; Decepticons who were on the beach.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron stabalized himself. He turned to his troops. &quot;I have \nbuisness\n&gt; to attend to, Switchblade, steer the ship to the location I talked \nto\n&gt; you about earlier.&quot; with that, Megatron soared out of the floating \nship,\n&gt; and towards the Obylisk.\n\n\n::BLINDCHAOS AND DOMNIJOE::\n\n    Domnijoe&#39;s face twisted into a mask of alarm when the ship \nlurched. As soon as the ship settled, she smiled slyly. \n    &quot;I&#39;m off, Lord Megatron.&quot; she said before her leader flew off. She \nwaited a momment before she, too, left the ship the same way her \nleader departed.\n    Blindchaos was thrilled to have a job and followed Megatron like \nan eager puppy. He said nothing. He simply followed and kept his eyes \npeeled for any confrontations that would disturb his new commander.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n*****************\n\n\n"}}
