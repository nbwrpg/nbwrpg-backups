She had nothing against him, just as long as he \nstayed out of her way. At the moment, however, she was glad for his help. He \nobviously knew more about transformer physiology than she. Basic first aid \nknowledge was required in the forces, but it would take more than her \nlimited training to repair Dinobot�s extensive damage. She wasn�t going to \nlie to herself, she was worried about him. She had no way of accurately \ngauging just how badly he was injured, but she did know that a non TM2 would \nhave died from fluid loss a long time ago.\n\nThe relief she felt upon seeing the doors of the CF was enough to make her \nwant to collapse where she stood. She was tired, dead tired. All she wanted \nto do was curl up in a nice �R chamber and sleep the past few days away. It \nhad been rough, but nothing she wasn�t trained to handle. Dinobot, however, \ndeserved a rest more than any of them. One thing was bothering her, however, \nwhy hadn�t Dinobot used his own repair system? She had seen him use it \nbefore, though the mechanics of it escaped her at the moment, she did know \nit was very effective.\n\nShe never really had the chance to look at this ship. Now, as she neared it, \nshe realized just how powerful a weapon it was. This ship was exactly what \nthe Maximal forces needed right now. The automated guns mounted on various \nsections of its outer hull looked rather impressive, and quite powerful. The \nprimary cannon mounted atop the massive ship was like nothing she had ever \nseen before, then again she still fought with a sword and staff, practically \nanything could be classified as more advanced. However, a weapon in the \nproper hands could be just as deadly as any plasma rifle.\n\nTavatron followed closely beside Dinobot as they entered the massive ship. \nThe sudden onslaught of artificial light caused her to instinctively raise \nher arm and blink reflexively. Almost immediately the feeling passed, her \nsystems automatically adjusting to her current surroundings. The mechanical \niris in her optics tightened to a mere pinhole, and was invisible to the \nnaked eye unless it was active. Tavatron�s gaze wandered about the ship, it \nproved to be just as formidable as she had originally thought.\n\nShe turned to Dinobot, up until now he had been rather quiet, perhaps it was \nfor the best, he needed to conseve his energy. She opened her mouth, as if \nshe were about to say something, but was suddenly cut-off by the low-level \nchirp of her comm system:\n\n&quot;Acknowledged, we�re on our way. Tavatron out.&quot;\n\nTavatron turned, and sure enough there were the arrows. Tavatron began to \nfollow them, it seemed everything would turn out alright after all.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
