She had met him at one time, but did not\n&gt; get the chance to really know him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, Right? It&#39;s been a long time, and I think we were\n&gt; introduced a while ago, but, maybe ya don&#39;t remember who I am. If not,\n&gt; I&#39;m Straight Shot, Tucson&#39;s half sister and his all time favorite weapon of choice.\n&gt; But we&#39;re not cheating, he does all the aiming and firing when he uses me.\n&gt; Oh, yeah, ya might not know that part. My alt modes are Cross Bow and\n&gt; regular bow. So, um, speakn&#39; of my half brother.. He is okay right?&quot;\n\nLord Elder turned around to take in Straight Shot, his optics widened\nslightly, &quot;Um, y . . yes&quot; Elder stammered slightly trying to get his\nwords out, clearly at a loss. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; He said as he stood to face\nher. &quot;I had quite forgotten you were back there. I think I&#39;m going to\nhave to make an inventory of who&#39;s back there.&quot; He said as he\nchuckled.\n\nHe glanced back at the board which was intermittently giving radio\nresponses from the various Autobots and Maximal&#39;s as the ark\ncommunication was able to receive it.\n\nFrom what I can gather Tuscon is on his way out with Rodimus Prime,\nWindlord and Nightlight as well.&quot; He paused and mumbled, &quot;I can&#39;t\ngaurantee what shape they&#39;ll be in though.&quot;\n\nA radio transmission came through from Lord Persues at the old Maximal\nBase . . .\n\n&gt; &quot;Tuscon, I&#39;m reading your location, please let us know if you need asistance,&quot; Perseus replied.  &quot;Lord Elder, do you read?&quot;\n\nElder turned as he got the transmission, &quot;Yes, I am reading you loud\nand clear.&quot; Elder slid back into his seat as he attenuated the\ntransmission, &quot;We are standing by to receive any wounded from the\nrescue mission, and we have Straight Shot here for any back up.&quot;\n\nElder glanced back at her grinning somewhat sheepishly, hoping that\nhis assumption was right.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
