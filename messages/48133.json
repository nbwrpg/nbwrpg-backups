Shadow Star, try to find\n&gt; details on a war \n&gt; cruiser. Naga, search for a patrol frigate. We have\n&gt; choice of either \n&gt; heavy weaponry, armor, speed or electronic\n&gt; equipment. I have no idea \n&gt; of what happened to the Predacon captured ship, so\n&gt; we have to expect \n&gt; the worse. It may have rejoined a base and\n&gt; re-equipped with heavy \n&gt; weaponry, which can mean a nasty fight. Our first\n&gt; task is to decide \n&gt; what is our best choice.
