It was \njust waste of his time. He didn&#39;t know how that mouse was and he didn&#39;t know \nif she could help him or not.\n\nHe made his way to a lake where he transformed to beast mode and drank from \nit. He wasn&#39;t sure where he was going or what he should do. He laid down by \nthe shore and napped there for a short while. But he didn&#39;t sleep long. He \nwas too edgy and hungry. There were to many things that went roaming around \nin the night. He got up and walked to the edge of the forest in the distance \nwhere in found a gather of berries. His ears went up and the corners of his \nmouth turned into a smile. He remembered this species where edible. Optimus \nhad them as specimens. He stood on his hind legs and bit off the berries \nthat were ripe enough to eat.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
