Improvising, he strikes at Ragnar&#39;s \nalready-wounded leg with his lashknife, trying to gimp it.  Riekan \ndrops from the sky shoulder-first like a meteor at the mechwarrior.\n\nPumpskin waits until the last possible second before he brings his \nfoot up to intercept Katya&#39;s charge, kicking her hard in the head.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I did miss an S somewhere... oh well... they&#39;re both dug in \nhis \n&gt; flank.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bic:\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar didn&#39;t see the attacks until he was hit. The knife slashed \nhis \n&gt; hand&#39;s back and drops of blood fell to the ground. The cyberwenom \nshot \n&gt; hit hard though. He countered with his two lasers which were now at \n&gt; point blank. Then he started feeling dizzy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar: Ragnar to any friendly, I have been hit bad. Need backup \nfast!\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya&#39;s attack being useless, she started running at about 100 mph \nat \n&gt; Pumpskin. She planned on tackling him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang felt the pain of the blade slashing his abdomen. Then the \n&gt; lasers hit him. He flew backward a dozen meters and took a moment \n&gt; before standing up.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Riekan&#39;s got TWO blades.  Can&#39;t you read?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Gauss slug tags Riekan in the hip, and he takes to the air to \n&gt; &gt; compensate for the loss of mobility on the ground.  Then Fury \n&gt; &gt; attacks, slinging his lashknife in one hand and firing his \n&gt; cybervenom \n&gt; &gt; gun in the other.  The reasoning being, Ragnar couldn&#39;t very well \n&gt; &gt; dodge two simultaneous attacks if he couldn&#39;t see them coming \nuntil \n&gt; &gt; the last second.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pumpskin shortens his tentacles, using two of them to fend off \n&gt; &gt; Katya&#39;s weapons fire - as if another shot to the head could have \n&gt; made \n&gt; &gt; him any loopier.  He uses one scimitar to parry and tie up the \n&gt; &gt; halberd and swings his other around to hopefully dig into \n&gt; Blackfang&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; side.  His eyes glow and unleash a blast at his new attacker from \n&gt; &gt; point-blank range.\n\n\n"}}
