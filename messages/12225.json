The screw \nups.  Or mess ups.  Icdemon, &quot;Brooder and Steel open fire on the \nAlliance&quot; will not work.  You have to be more specific.  Next, \nSilverbolt and Stomper never went inside the Ark, so they can&#39;t fire \non Punch nor Zergling.  And, another argument on that, in your post \nArchangel sealed the Ark BEFORE they got in.  Oops?\n\nAlloran, is Ratchet able to fire weapons while in his elephant beast \nmode?)\n\n(Also, RFA, do to a confusion in posts involving Serpentor and Shadow \nWing&#39;s death, he may or may not have actually been able to go into \nthe Ark (late posting may have interfered with that), so I won&#39;t post \ndamage yet.  I suggest attacking another bot, and if Serpentor is in \nthe battle, I&#39;ll post his damage and you may continue your \nillustrious battle for honor, ok?)\n\nThe Oblitercons/Unitron/BH/Blastrage/Zergling/Serpentor/Punch/Oinker:\n\n\n\n\nDark One side stepped, blasts scratching his left leg.\n\nHiss ducked, the shots missing him by inches.\n\n&quot;Form Oblitertron!&quot; Dark One yelled, all the Oblitercons leaping into \nthe air, a powerful magnetic pull slamming each of them together in \nodd shapes, a 45 foot high robot crashing to the ground, raising its \narms int he air, yelling madly.\n\n&quot;OBLITERTRON SHALL OBLITERATE&quot;\n\n---\n\nUnitron ignored Oblitertron, having seen plenty of gestalts in his \ndays.  He barrel rolled, firing off a missile at the Ark.\n\n---\n\nOinker fired off three laser blasts at Stomper.\n\n---\n\nBH brought the skimmer about at full speed, Blastrage swinging the \ngrenade launcher, firing off three grenades, two heading at \nSilverbolt, the other at the Ark.\n\n-------\n\nZergling got up after picking up his rapid-firing laser rifle, firing \noff 10 rapid laser bolts at Xiane&#39;s back.  \n\n---\n\nPunch yelped, raising his hands as his plasma cannon crashed to the \nground, in two pieces.\n\n\n"}}
