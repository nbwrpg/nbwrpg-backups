Not to mention the fact that they were close enough to the base that an explosion that big would rip half of it apart!\nIt was then decided for her that the lives of her Maximals was greater then her own and if it meant letting an enemy live to save them then...so be it.\nIron Raptor then mover her clawed hands away from Zenyak but not before she then threw her head into the air (hopefully with him attached to the teeth) and flung her head back and then snapped it forward, hoping to send the Predacon flying away from the base and out of her life!\nShe was sick of the threats and she was sick of the damage, but just as an extra precaution she activated the auto guns so that if Zenyak managed to go flying they would be shooting at him as he sailed through the air.\nBut the real fact was that if she could save the lives of even a few Maximals then she would be satisfied, their lives begin much more important then her own.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
