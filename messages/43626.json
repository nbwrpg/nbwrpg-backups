It was an old capsule, about from \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Great \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; War. It entered the atmosphere, fire surrounding it. It went \n&gt; &gt; down \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about in central africa. The robot inside was still alive, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy would be out in just a few cycle.
