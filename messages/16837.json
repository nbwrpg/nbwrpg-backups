It was enough to frive a vampire bot insane!\nDesmonus looked around for a few more moments before taking to the skies, \nher wings stretched wide as she gained altetude.\nHer destination was the Alliance base, where her master had told her to go \nin the first place.\nIt wouldn&#39;t take long to get there, but once she reached it she might fe \nforced to take one of the Alliance members as her victome.\nOf course, she wouldn&#39;t kill it, simply feed.\nAnd all it would feel after that was tired, and sleep would be the best \nthing for it.\nBut she would never feed on Zardus, that was one thing she knew. Death was \nfar better then what HE would do if she fed upon him and he remembered.\nThat was also a benifit.\nWhile feeding upon her victom she injected a venom into them, one that would \ndelete any memory of her feeding, but everything else they would remember.\nIt was a gift.\nDesmonus continued to head towards the Alliance base, her stomach grumbling \nall the way at the thought of a warm meal.*\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
