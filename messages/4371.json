And you be careful out there to.  I got a bad feeling \nsomething is about to happen.  It&#39;s been quiet all day and that makes me \nnervous. Just take care out there commander.  I&#39;ll see you when you get \nback. Oh and before I forget, I finished the tunnel and everything.  OK, \nDarkMouse out.&quot;\nShe closed the link and returned to solving the problem of the other tunnel. \n  The walls showed that the integrety of the cave sould not handle another \ntunnel.  So she would have to explain to Quickstrike and Scorponok that the \ncave could only handle one tunnel and not two like originaly thought.\n&quot;Oh brother, Megatron, Quickstrike and Scorponok will have my tail tacked to \nthe wall.&quot;\n\n--------Original Message----------\nFrom: Talon Harvilicz\nDate: Fri Jun 23, 2000 4:18pm\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nQuickstrike:\n\n\nQuickstrike watched Lightmare, slowly stepping out of the lake. It was\ncooling off now, the way he liked it. He stepped to the side, eyeing her. It\nwas about time he&#39;d go back to the cave.\n\n&quot;Yeah, ah&#39;ll be an optic out. But ah&#39;m sure he can handle himself.&quot; he said\ninto his comm-link to Dark Mouse.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
