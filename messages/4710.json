What was he going to do? There \nwas no one here, but the bots that were off-line. Poor Depth Charge and \nTigerHawk. He just wished one of them were still alive. Quickstrike, Inferno \nand Waspinator were left for dead, what he heard. They were put off-line on \nthe solid earth. He thought of going to find them, and just try to mess \naround. Just for the fun of it. There may be a possible way to put them back \non-line. Just their heads maybe. It was funny to him if he could start a \ntrantriliqist (spelling&#39;s wrong) act. Quickstrike he&#39;d just kick around, \nbecause he hated that scum of a Predacon. He was all noise and huff, while \nthe litle thing wound up getting slagged. Waspinator he would rig up and \ntalk to.\n\nHe laughed, just thinking about it. He turned into a trot, going further \ninto the forest, to where he wasn&#39;t sure where it lead to. He was the last \nMaximal, so he went anywhere he wanted to.\n\nSuddenly, the youth saw some bright colors. He halted and crouched low. He \nwas curious---and there was a familiar smell. A bad one. He crept up closer, \nthen saw the colors blend into a familiar, odd frame. Quickstrike&#39;s frame! \nHoly lasers of Cybertron, the Fuzor was alive! He snaked his head around \ntrying to get a better look. He was talking to another bot, but he couldn&#39;t \nsee who it was.\n\nHe stayed low and kept himself close to the brush.\n\n&quot;Ultra bad,&quot; he whispered.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
