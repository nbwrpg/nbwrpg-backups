From now on, my name will be Blackfang! \nBlackfang, \n&gt; maximize!\n&gt; \n&gt; He transformed to bot mode. His halberd, made from his wolf tail, \nand \n&gt; his energy shotgun stood on his back, his pulse laser was in its \n&gt; holster and his bone knife was in a compartment on his left \nshoulder. \n&gt; Furry patches covered his body and a wolf head stood on his right \n&gt; shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Great! I can&#39;t wait to fight a predacon like this! (He \n&gt; touched his temple, thus opening a general maximal line) Maximals, \n&gt; from now on, my name will be Blackfang.
