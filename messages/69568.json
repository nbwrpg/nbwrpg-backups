As the black fortress opened for the duo, for a moment it was as if some large black beast opened its mouth and swallowed Cyclonus and Scourge whole and then closed its mouth. \n\nInside the the landing bay Cyclonus and Scourge quickly shifted form, gears grinding smoothly as they assumed their robotic modes. \n\n&quot;You know they probably have defenses in place. I don&#39;t think Hydras liked out last visit.&quot; Scourge said as he glanced around suspiciously, his voice low, his movements predatorilly graceful as he moved.\n\nCyclonus nodded, his own keen optics taking in the room. &quot;Yes, but he is unlikely to attack us, at least not yet. But he is cautious, and that is good. Perhaps there is something of the elder spark still in him.&quot;\n\nScourge glanced back at cyclonus, &quot;Yeah, maybe.&quot;\n\n&quot;Come.&quot; Cyclonus said as he walked towards the door that would take him to the elevator that would carry them towards Hydras&#39; command center. &quot;We have much to discuss with Hydras.&quot;\n\nScourge walked after Cyclonus, his head craning from one side to the other, his senses watchful. \n\nAs the duo stepped into the door, the doors slid shut and after a command from cyclonus the elevator began to move. Cyclonus glanced at Scourge, &quot;Be ready for anything.&quot;\n\nScourge nodded, a grim smile appearing momentarilly on his faceplate, &quot;Maybe its them who should be ready for us!&quot;\n\nThe elevator continued its trip, and finally opened to reveal Hydras&#39; throne room. . . \n\n&lt;TAG&gt;\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus/Scourge)\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
