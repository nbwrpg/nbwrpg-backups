He =\r\nhad even leaned back a little to allow the two to hug and\n&gt; show affection.=\r\n That is until ELITA&#39;s last statement and he could see\n&gt; the look on NIGHTL=\r\nIGHT&#39;s face.\n&gt; \n&gt; Smiling warmly and nodding RODIMUS took NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s hand=\r\n. &quot;Yes,\n&gt; Perceptor has been instrumental in your recovery.&quot; Leaning back i=\r\nn he\n&gt; continued to smile at her, hoping to wipe away her fears if he could=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;From what we can tell, Perceptor has joined the Maximals.&quot; RODIMUS\n=\r\n&gt; rubbed ELITA&#39;s head giving her reassurance and affection as well.\n&gt; &quot;Just=\r\n like our daughter here has said.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ***********************************=\r\n*******\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor walked close to  Lord Elder and shoo=\r\nk his head  and said &quot;It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; highly unlikely that that happens &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside, Uproar catches up to Lord Elder, as he observes t=\r\nhe private code\n&gt; &gt; on  Tuscons door.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Wow, so, I guess Tucson and=\r\n Talon are kinda gonna be like Rodimus and\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight.  I wonder if Tuc=\r\nson will ya know..  Have a family of his own\n&gt; &gt; some day?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n ELDER looked away from the door, his optics reddening slightly. If he\n&gt; we=\r\nre human it might even seem like a blush. &quot;Who can say Uproar, who\n&gt; can sa=\r\ny? I would imagine that that is something that we may all want\n&gt; to do at s=\r\nome point.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; TORCA and NOCTORRO walked with ELDER as well, their large =\r\nforms\n&gt; swaying as they walked, the sound of their footsteps large and heav=\r\ny\n&gt; as their metal booted feet hit the deck plating.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We still must ta=\r\nlk.&quot; TORCA said looking at ELDER, his tone somber and\n&gt; resigned. NOCTORRO =\r\nwas tapping out a small message as they talked, but\n&gt; he looked up and nodd=\r\ned in agreement as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; ELDER nodded as he glanced at TORCA and then =\r\nat the others. &quot;Uproar,\n&gt; why don&#39;t you show Perceptor around the base and =\r\nhelp him get settled\n&gt; in, I would imagine he will need to find some quarte=\r\nrs and perhaps a\n&gt; recharging chamber coded to his requirements.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ****=\r\n**************************************\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Moving to Legac=\r\ny&#39;s quarters, Straight Shot thinks for a moment before\n&gt; &gt; saying anything,=\r\n which was her best of traits.  Once she had an idea of\n&gt; &gt; what she wanted=\r\n to say, she looks up to Legacy, with an air of sincerity \n&gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; alwa=\r\nys had for everyone, including her brother.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Thanks, for letting m=\r\ne talk to you, I appreciate it.  I just wanted ta \n&gt; &gt; let\n&gt; &gt; ya know that=\r\n I think my brother doesn&#39;t quite understand where you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; coming from a=\r\nnd maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s so critical of your actions.  He&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; always been=\r\n like that, not just around you, but with me too, and yeah,\n&gt; &gt; sometimes i=\r\nt gets on my nerves.  But with things as they are, and what\n&gt; &gt; happened ta=\r\n him in the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s put up such a \n&gt; &gt; defense\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n and why he&#39;s so determined ta think off the pavement.  And maybe that&#39;s \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; why\n&gt; &gt; his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed with mine too,=\r\n at times.\n&gt; &gt; Honestly though, how do you feel about his thinking outside =\r\nthe box?  Is \n&gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; a reason why you&#39;d rather not go that way?&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; For a moment LEGACY looked confused, his single crimson optic =\r\nboring\n&gt; into STRAIGHT SHOT as his mind ran over what she said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I do =\r\nnot understand all of the colloquialisms than you have\n&gt; utilized.&quot; He said=\r\n at last, &quot;But I ascertain that you are attempting\n&gt; to explain your siblin=\r\ng&#39;s actions to me and inquiring as to why I will\n&gt; not allow Tuscon to dist=\r\nurb Optimus Prime&#39;s chassis.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEGACY&#39;s optic flickered for a moment. &quot;=\r\nI appreciate your intent.&quot; He\n&gt; said his words clear and well articulated. =\r\n&quot;But I do not require an\n&gt; explanation, since I have taken no offense to hi=\r\ns actions; to do so\n&gt; would be an inefficient use of my time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Howeve=\r\nr to answer your question I will replay something for you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning to=\r\n the screen that was standing behind LEGACY he fired a beam\n&gt; of energy at =\r\nit. But instead of it exploding into shards of glass and\n&gt; debris it simply=\r\n changed to show a mountainous scene, a volcano, and\n&gt; then the volcano exp=\r\nloding to reveal the Ark. It was obvious from the\n&gt; motion that the events =\r\nwere being speeded up for ease of viewing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Soon after it happened a sm=\r\nall satellite like device rose up from the\n&gt; Ark and began to travel away f=\r\nrom it and after a while return. After\n&gt; another short moment, short becaus=\r\ne of the speeded up play back,\n&gt; MEGATRON flew out along with STARSCREAM, S=\r\nOUNDWAVE and a few other\n&gt; Decepticon seekers, obviously having been repair=\r\ned by the device. They\n&gt; all land on a cliff and look back at the Ark, and =\r\nSTARSCREAM fires a\n&gt; blast at the Ark and they all fly off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the=\r\n Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMUS PRIME is\n&gt; also is knoc=\r\nked into the beam and his repair process begins.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: This is the sce=\r\nne from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the bots and\n&gt; cons fell to earth and 4 =\r\nmillion years had passed.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The scene fades to black.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;These seque=\r\nnce of cannot be disrupted.&quot; LEGACY intoned coldly.\n&gt; &quot;Without the Autobots=\r\n none of you would be here.&quot; LEGACY turned back\n&gt; to face STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;A=\r\nnd without the Decepticon&#39;s attack on the Ark\n&gt; the Autobots will not survi=\r\nve.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEGACY folded his arms behind his back, &quot;There can be no disrupti=\r\non of\n&gt; the time flow.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a small beep on LEGACY&#39;s panel causi=\r\nng him to look over at\n&gt; it. &quot;Interesting.&quot; He said curiously. &quot;It would se=\r\nem that I am\n&gt; required on the bridge.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
