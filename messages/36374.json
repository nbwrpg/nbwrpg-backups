Three more anchors snapped and the base rocked into the \nair and crashed down causing a gust of sand to rise through the air. \n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the base Ignatius fell from his seat and struck the console \nwith a loud clang. his head was dented but other than that he was \nfine. He regained his composure trying to think of a way out of the \npredicament. The only solution was surender.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This is the Trainer Base, I offer you my unconditional surrender.&quot; \nHe turned down the automatic defenses and released the blast doors \nmaking no obstacle to stop the attackers from entering.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shots from everywhere struck the Trainer Base causing stress \nfractures in the frame. Ignatius didn&#39;t know that there were two \nforces outside he just knew that if his choices were death or \nsurrender he chose to live.\n\nVile laughed evily as he heard Ignatius surrender, but to who? Vile \ndid not know and was not going to take the chance of losinga new base \nso early. He decided then and there that he was going to win this \nbattle. Finally he pressed a green button that caused his voice to \nboom outside the ship from loud speakers, the message going to all \nthe Predacons and Destrons outside and the trianers base.\n\nVile: &quot;This is Commander Vile of the Vile Force, the most eltire task \nforce of the X-Predacons. All people here who are not affiliated with \nthis base are to leave immediately, it is now under our control. All \npeople within the base come out when I say so. As for the attackers \nof this base other than us... your battle for this base is over, you \nhave lost. Leave here now... or else we will destroy you and this \nbase.&quot;\n\nAnd with that Vile closed the message to everyone, a few seconds \nlater all the missiles that had been fired relaoded into their \nmissile pods and the Vile Cannon began to charge once more.\n\n\n"}}
