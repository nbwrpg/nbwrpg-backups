Moments\nturned into a full minute then another yet still the pod did not open. With\na hiss the cover slowly opened allowing a rather slender fem bot to step\nfrom its confines. Her robot mode was sleek and colored like the sand dunes\naround her, other than the dark purple optics she&#39;d blend right into the\ndesert around her.\n\n    Bits of her alternate form could be seen, as the cuffs at her wrists\nwere thick claws, and multiple legs jutted from her back (akin to how Black\narachnia&#39;s and terrantulas&#39; legs go). Turning she scanned the the dunes not\nnoticing the bot that stood watch over the pod. &quot;Hmmm sand....wonder where\nthis is...?&quot;\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, October 05, 2000 5:19 PM\nSubject: Re: A new transformer...\n\n\n&gt; About this whole debate, guys, its exactly the type of thing that can\n&gt; go on the message board at the site and not clog up RPG mail!
