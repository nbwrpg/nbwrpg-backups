Pecking her back and hind legs.\nDiana tried to get at them, but every time she tried to turn around to get \nthem they stepped back and squawked at her.\nBut finally, nearly 20 min of fighting off the huge birds, Diana collapsed \nwith a plaintive mew, unable to get her legs to keep her up anymore.\n\nThe huge vultures finally moved in now, causally and slowly. Circling the \nlump of wheezing fur and occasionally pecking at it with their sharp beaks, \na mew replying every strike.*\n(Diana�s mews sound like Mew from Poke�mon, for those who have seen it.)\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
