Because when he loses that he&#39;s done for.&quot;\n\nBack at the fortress, Rat =\r\nTrap scrambles to try to evade the fire, and now realizes that things are f=\r\nar out of hand.  He finds himself flushed out of his hiding place, and corn=\r\nered at the entrance of the vent cover.\n\n&quot;Gahhh!  So much for evasive maneu=\r\nvers!  RAT TRAP MAXIMIZE!&quot;\n\nHe gets into robot mode and slides down, landin=\r\ng behind Tucson.  Tucson turns his head after hearing him land on his tiny =\r\nfeet.\n\n&quot;Rat Trap?&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks up.\n\n&quot;Sorry Wheels, cover got blown.  Th=\r\ne pipes are crawln&#39; with spider bots and the base&#39;s defenses are on high al=\r\nert.  I managed ta kinda do some damage to the electrical system but not mu=\r\nch. Oh slag...  I - see why you&#39;re not movn&#39;.&quot;\n\nHe looks up to Rodimus.\n\nTu=\r\ncson stands idol and then realizes that his backup battery is being drained=\r\n rather quickly. He could also hear Darkhawk behind him.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m down to eigh=\r\nty percent in my backup battery, not enough to fight, just enough for an es=\r\ncape, Rodimus is blocking my way and that pest of a predicon is beginning t=\r\no really annoy me.&quot;\n\nRat Trap desperately open fires on the auto guns and d=\r\nroids.\n\n&quot;So what&#39;s the plan wheels?!&quot;\n\nTucson sighs he would have to abando=\r\nn his plight for the time being.  Something inside him was telling him that=\r\n his escape now was more important than trying to do everything at one time=\r\n.  \n\n&quot;Sometimes Rat Trap, we don&#39;t always have the answers to everything.  =\r\nAnd right now, I have no answer for you.  I want you to get yourself out of=\r\n here.. Now.&quot;\n\nRat Trap gasps.  He gives Tucson back the transmitter.\n\n&quot;But=\r\n, but what about you wheels?  I can&#39;t leave ya here, he&#39;ll pulverize ya.  Y=\r\nou&#39;re just about the only pal I got left and I can&#39;t afford ta lose ya!&quot;\n\nT=\r\nucson stays put.\n\n&quot; Please, go! NOW!  FOR YOUR SAFTEY RAT TRAP, GET OUT OF =\r\nHERE!&quot;\n\nRat Trap doesn&#39;t budge.\n\n&quot;NO, IF YOU GO DOWN I GO WITH YA!  I AIN&#39;T=\r\n GONNA ABANDON YA WHEELS, YOU DIDN&#39;T ABANDON ME SO IT&#39;S HIGH TIME I RETURN =\r\nTHE FAVOR!&quot;\n\nHe didn&#39;t know how to react.  Rat Trap may be small but his he=\r\nart was definitely in the right place.  If anything was going to help the b=\r\noth of them, it was this newly found friendship that they developed in just=\r\n a short amount of time.  He gently puts a hand on Rat Trap&#39;s head, and giv=\r\nes it a gentile rub.\n\n&quot; Guess there&#39;s no changing your mind is there?&quot;\n\nRat=\r\n Trap smiles up to him.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re in this tagether Wheels.&quot;  \n\nTucson&#39;s expre=\r\nssion changes as he now turns his attention to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; You mock us beca=\r\nuse you think we&#39;re inferior.  I beg to differ with you Rodimus.  Because i=\r\nf you were as strong as you claim to be, you would not have fallen into suc=\r\nh treachery.  There&#39;s something about this room you remember, it will alway=\r\ns haunt you and not because of the pain it may have caused, but the guilt y=\r\nou will always feel, knowing that you did not have the will to fend off you=\r\nr enemy when they overtook you.  I did look up to you at one time, I though=\r\nt you were strong, resistant, and noble.  My views have all been altered no=\r\nw.  I do not know what happened, perhaps one day I will understand, but now=\r\n, I see the truth.  Truth is, you don&#39;t want to be helped, and you have tur=\r\nned your back on your faction.  Truth is, the only true leader of the Autob=\r\nots was Optimus Prime.  I&#39;d do anything to see him back online once again. =\r\n You are not my leader anymore and you do not intimidate me.  If I fall I f=\r\nall, but at least I know I did my best to honor Optimus Prime as he would h=\r\nave wanted me to.  No scrappling would ever have pledged his loyalty as Rat=\r\n Trap has today.  His heart is there, and it&#39;s more than I can say for you.=\r\n&quot;\n\nRat Trap freezes for a moment.  He had not expected Tucson to say what h=\r\ne said.\n\n&quot;Wow, wheels ya really mean that?&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;I do.&quot;\n\nHis ex=\r\npression turns stone cold.\n\n&quot; I intend to finish what I started, I will fin=\r\nish my mission, but after that, do not expect me to have the same amount of=\r\n respect for you when this is all over Rodimus.  But now, is not the time f=\r\nor that.  I see that what I accomplished was just the first phase.  I&#39;ve ac=\r\ncomplished that thus far.  I&#39;ve learned for myself what needs to be done, a=\r\nnd what needs to be done can&#39;t be completed today.  That will have to wait.=\r\n&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks up.\n\n&quot;Wheels  we gotta move.&quot;\n\nTucson listens to Rat Trap=\r\n and transforms in front of Rodimus.  He opens his driver&#39;s side door and l=\r\nets him in.\n\n&quot; I believe this is where you step asside Rodimus, and let us =\r\npass.&quot;\n\nHe exclaims while shotting at a few more droids.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n--- In=\r\n nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor/DarkHawk/swar=\r\nm bots:\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor Started to track furios the maximals and Autobot&#39;s s=\r\nignature while the inner defences started to pop out and opening fire again=\r\nst Tucson.

He uses his =\r\ncurrent state to his advantage, and screches his rubber on his tires, pivot=\r\ning them quickly to maneuver away from the blasts. He had no sonar senses t=\r\no guide him but he had his audo sensors and his sense of feel and touch, gu=\r\niding him. The system that Rat Trap was now holding merely augments his aud=\r\nio sensors and even though he could have used the device, he was now quickl=\r\ny getting used to not having it on him. And now, he could feel Rodimus&#39;s en=\r\nergy signature. But first he had to get rid of Scorponok and Dark Hawk. He =\r\nknew he did not have enough energon in his main power core, but he did have=\r\n a reserve stash in his backup battery. He calculated that since he had har=\r\ndly touched this backup, it had close to ninety five percent capacity, yet =\r\nit had to be used sparingly. This meant deciding between vehicle and robot =\r\nmode. He makes a quick anaylasis of his systems.. Which would be able to co=\r\nncerve more? Vehicle or robot mode? \n&gt; \n&gt; The truth was, they were equal in=\r\n ussage. But he knew he had to stick to vehicle mode, to make for a fast ge=\r\ntaway if he did indeed find a way out of there.. Meanwhile, hidden not too =\r\nfar now, from the torture chamber, Rat Trap who has made his way into a ven=\r\nt hole, right over the chamber, spots Tucson. He then finds another bundle =\r\nof wires and finds readable tags on them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s wheels, he&#39;s up&#39;n runn=\r\n&#39;n.. Must be on a backup battery... That might last a few hours but that&#39;s =\r\nabout it. Okay, time for this rat ta be his rattiest!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He finds a tag=\r\n that leads to the chamber, and begins to knaw at the wires that are connec=\r\nted to it. He snaps them readilly with his strong, buck teeth. The doors su=\r\nddenly open in the torture chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;WHEELS, BURN RUBBER!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson=\r\n could hear Rat Trap&#39;s voice and without questioning him, he spins his rear=\r\n tires, creates a smoke screen and senses the wind coming in from the open =\r\ndoors. He takes this opportunity to get past Scorponok, via creating a low =\r\nlying smoke cloud, cloaking his chassse, and manges to get outside the cham=\r\nber, stopping in front of Rodimus. Rat Trap continues to knaw at wires, hop=\r\ning that one of them was another wire that would disable the security and w=\r\neaponry systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside, Tucson transforms into robot mode and in fro=\r\nnt of Rodimus. This was it,he was face to face with his former leader. Rat =\r\nTrap positions himself inside, at a peek hole, to watch what&#39;s happening.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, you wont&#39; believe this, but, Tucson got outa there, and he=\r\n&#39;s face ta face with Rodimus.

Yet, the body of Optimus Prime holds his att=\r\nention for a moment as he looks up to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wow, you must&#39;ve been one =\r\nheck of a leader in your days. Rat Trap says he&#39;s with someone who&#39;s relate=\r\nd to you. I wish I could do something ta help you guys get back on your whe=\r\nels, but I&#39;m just a Maximal and I really don&#39;t know how to bring your men b=\r\nack ta life... That Autobot out there could sure use your help, looks like =\r\nthat Rodimus guy really let you down and gave into those Predacons. I reall=\r\ny can&#39;t judge the guy because I wasn&#39;t there when it happened, but from wha=\r\nt Rat Trap says, I - dunno if I could ever respect a leader who weakens und=\r\ner pressure. Okay, I gotta go, Lord Elder needs my help. Rest in peace.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; He salutes the still form of Optimus Prime and gets to the shuttle. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &quot;Lord Elder, I&#39;ve reached the shuttle and I&#39;m now performing preliminary t=\r\nake off proceedures.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;=\r\nsupercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus had been standing just outside the t=\r\norture chamber not sure if\n&gt; &gt; he wanted to actually enter it. there was so=\r\nmething about this room\n&gt; &gt; that gave him the chills, especially when he di=\r\ndn&#39;t need to go in\n&gt; &gt; there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Instead he just stood in the shadows=\r\n, listening the words of the\n&gt; &gt; others like Darkhawk, Scorponok and that A=\r\nutobot Tuscon. there was\n&gt; &gt; something about that Autobot that seemed to gr=\r\nate on his nerves.
