It was good to have more \nheavy hitters on the team.\nBut what they wanted to know...the answer probably wasn&#39;t what they wanted \nto hear.\nIron Raptor bent down to take Prowl&#39;s head in her arms, hoping that he \ndidn&#39;t wake up and suddenly bite her arm off.*\n\n&quot; Um...I hate to tell you this but Striker and his group don&#39;t exist \nanymore.&quot;\n\n* She heaved, trying to lift Prowls head.*\n\n&quot; This...&quot; she gestured to Prowl. &quot; This is the last of his crew and he was \nattacking me but nothing I couldn&#39;t have stopped.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
