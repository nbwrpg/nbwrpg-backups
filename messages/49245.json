Switchblade just finished making the auto \nguns and other base defenses. Otherwise it&#39;s a sitting duck. The \narmour however is heavy, and can take quite a bit of punishment \nbefore hurtin too much. =p (read the ooC at the end as well)\n\n-- Megatron --\n\nMegatron grumbles as the Predacon base is splayed with weaponfire \nfrom two sides. &quot;Note to self, repair sensors, and set up base \ndefenses.&quot; \n\nHe starts into a brisk walk as he heads to the base exit. He opens a \ncommlink to Switchblade, &quot;Switchblade, look around in the storage \nbay, there might be something we can use down there. We&#39;re in a bit \nof a pinch right now.&quot; He reaches the exit, and stops short.\n\nMegatron frowns as he opens a basewide commlink, &quot;Preceptor, \nWaspinator, Inferno if you&#39;re active, Quickstrike, Warhead, and all \nother Preds prepare for battle, this could get messy.&quot;\n\nThe outer sensors pick up Tyreal&#39;s ultimatum. &quot;Hah!&quot; Megatron laughs \nsarcasticly, &quot;Turn myself in... of course I&#39;m not going to agree to \nthat slag...&quot; He switches to external speakers, &quot;I don&#39;t care who \nyou are. Who would agree to such terms... Bewarned, if you stay here \nand bother me, your lives are forfeit. You get one warning before \ndeath, so I hope you choose wisely.&quot;\n\nHe closes the external comm, and opens another comm to \nSwitchblade. &quot;Switchblade, found anything yet?&quot;\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSwitchblade grumbles when he gets Megatron&#39;s first comm, &quot;Ya ya, i&#39;m \nlooking.&quot; He fiddles around with the nearest sealed container, \nhacking the passlock, and disableing the protections. Inside he \nfinds a bunch of energon pulse weapons, a newer Tripred design, \nalthough he&#39;s unsure how effective they are. \n\nHe moves onto the next sealed crate, and is about to open it when he \ngets Megatron&#39;s second message. &quot;Alright, I&#39;m looking, so lemme \nalone for a bit. You&#39;ll know if i find anything.&quot; He starts working \non another sealed crate, wondering why his hacking process is taking \na little longer than before...\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nooC: One more thing, the Preds are few right now, so without \nintervention, they may get a sever ass kicking. =p I&#39;d like to \npropose starting a base storyline which starts with the artifacts \nwhich are located in the Predacon storage bay right now. The ones \nwhich none of the bots know about, or what they are. Something that \nwould involve triggering an effect of the artifact, which would \ncause the Predacons to win the battle, but maybe the artifact could \nswitch hands, and then a sort of power struggle would ensue.\n\n\n"}}
