Once there, she \n&gt; transfroms to tank mode, then makes the quasi-transformation from \n&gt; mobile tank to stationary artillery piece.  Her rangefinder draws a \n&gt; bead on the predacon shields - she can hit them from here, albeit \n&gt; inaccurately, but that&#39;s not the point.  What concerns her is that \n&gt; the shields are still up to be hit.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tyreal,&quot; she says through the comm, &quot;are you sure this Deathsteel \n&gt; character can be trusted?  Those shields aren&#39;t going anywhere.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; : : Darkangel : :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Following the orders, Darkangel flies low into the swamp area, \n&gt; conceling himself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The large fiendish flyer silently landed on top of a wet pile of \n&gt; wood\n&gt; &gt; in the marshes to the south of the Predacon base.
