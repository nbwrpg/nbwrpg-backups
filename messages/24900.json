By far, she is the most damaged \n&gt; Predacon in this \n&gt; &gt; whole mess.\n&gt; &gt;        Looking back at her attacker, she jumps and manuvers \nherself \n&gt; up into a \n&gt; &gt; large tree. There, she waits only a moment before leaping from \nthe \n&gt; green \n&gt; &gt; brush of leaves and asending on Starscream with two pistols \nraining \n&gt; down \n&gt; &gt; blasts on him. As the shots fall, so do the drops of mech off of \n&gt; her body.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Megatron watches as Killfest come back with four more \n&gt; explosion \n&gt; &gt; blasts. He braced himself, and was sent rolling violently. He got \n&gt; up 50 yards \n&gt; &gt; further from him. With one eye gone, and now a middle finger \n&gt; snapped off \n&gt; &gt; somewhere, and a portion of his hip to accompany it, he was \nleaking \n&gt; mech.\n&gt; &gt;        He held out his Tailgun, and fired 15 shots after \nKillfest. \n&gt; Some aimed \n&gt; &gt; for him legs, others at his chest, and three for his face. \nMegatron \n&gt; was going \n&gt; &gt; to damage this bot, there was no escaping it. He wanted to put \n&gt; Killfest \n&gt; &gt; through misery.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Tankkor began to rip the tenticles off of his large Vhicon \n&gt; body, but \n&gt; &gt; they began to overwheal the titan. He yelled, thrashed, and sent \n&gt; off shots \n&gt; &gt; into mid air. Turning, he aimed for a tree and fired.\n&gt; &gt;        The tree burst into a spectacular fire freenzy and soon, \nthe \n&gt; &gt; neighboring trees around it became engulfed. The battle scene \nsoon \n&gt; became an \n&gt; &gt; inferno, complete with falling brush, smoke, ash, and an \nincredible \n&gt; heat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Marine winced as a branch covered in flames fell near him. \n&gt; He looked \n&gt; &gt; at Endbringer, and bent down on one knee, coughing from the \nsmoke. \n&gt; He aimed \n&gt; &gt; his missle launcher for Endbringers back, where he assumed the \n&gt; tenticles \n&gt; &gt; sprouted from. He fired five deafining bursts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Tarantulas slowly backed away, his face cover, &quot;Oh no...&quot; \nHe \n&gt; rasped \n&gt; &gt; silently, waiting to get hit by Greven. He held out his gun in \n&gt; front of his \n&gt; &gt; and fired a round of 25 blasts at him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Aerostreak dives to Grevens back, two of his claws \nextended \n&gt; and aimed \n&gt; &gt; to dig into the bots backside.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Akron sees Scather disappear, but she continues forward. \nThe \n&gt; shound of \n&gt; &gt; the struggling kept her on his trail. She sent out 4 energon \nblasts \n&gt; in a \n&gt; &gt; line, one of them bound to hit him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Putnam was sent slamming itno a tree, one engulfed in \nfire. \n&gt; He jetted \n&gt; &gt; back into the sky, now with a light singe covering his silver \n&gt; armor. He \n&gt; &gt; watched as Akron fired on Scyther and Darkmouse, with a slight \nclue \n&gt; to what \n&gt; &gt; direction they were in. He joined her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Odiphious and Venus rise to join Putnam and Akron. Now \nwith \n&gt; Darkmouse \n&gt; &gt; invisable, it would be difficult to hit her from the ground. \nVenus, \n&gt; with her \n&gt; &gt; lasso, tossed it out in the direction of the shots.\n\n\n"}}
