She didn&#39;t want to hear another word from the annoying snake.\nEven though he did claim to have royal blood and did seem to have some need\nfor them to act like a married couple.\n\nThe shuttle shook as it landed. &quot;Thank the Avatars of the wind.&quot; (Her form\nof religion) She was glad to have finally landed. Now maybe she could\nfinally be rid of this annoying creature. &quot;Now can He let go?&quot; she asked ouy\nof annoyance. A snake that large was cramping her wrapped arm and wings. She\nwanted to return to robot mode and a more dignified form.(She&#39;s been stuck\nin half hawk mode since the battle at the old base.) She used her middle eye\nto scan the surroundings. She was sure precautions would be taken so she&#39;d\nwait for a more opportune moment to escape. Or maybe Zardus would accept her\nmistake and let her continue her work. It benefitted the alliance to much to\nbe left alone and Squizzy didn&#39;t know enough to continue.\n\nNajah opened his big mouth once more questioning her intelligence.\n\nLady Hawk looked straight at Zardus, he was getting cocky. He didn&#39;t think\nshe could do any damage while she was wrapped up. He was wrong. If she were\nto open her mouth and shriek right now the Alliance would be looking for a\nnew leader. Unfortunately that also meant that Veratis would be looking for\na new daughter.\n\n&quot;What exactly is it you&#39;d like to know?&quot; she asked knowing he heald all the\ncards. She had to run a bluff and hope to cut her losses. &quot;Have the\ninvertabrate release me and I&#39;ll tell you everything.&quot;\n\nOOC (The word Lawer was an insult, not a compliment.)
