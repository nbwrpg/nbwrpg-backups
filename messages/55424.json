She played \nand dodged shadows.  She was fine tuning her camoflage skills and \nmaking herself appear and disappear through out the flora and fauna \nin the forest. She started to skip down the hillside and chased a few \nsmall birds through the forest. She laughed and giggled. Played and \nsmiled. Not a care in the world. At least, not untill she fell into \nan energon cage. She was housted into th tree tops and bounded around \nin the cage as it shook around untill it settled. She lay on the \nbars, swinging high above the ground. SHe shook from fright. \n\nMeanwhile, back in Hydras&#39;s base, the perimeter alarms were going \noff. \n\n\n"}}
