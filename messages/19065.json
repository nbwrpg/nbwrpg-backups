I shall treasure this honour.&quot; He liked the ring \nof his new title: War General Starscream. It wasn&#39;t as good as \nEmperor, but it was good. He was about to leave, when KitKat asked \nhim a question.\n\n&quot;Temporal Rift? I&#39;ve never heard of it here, but it could be \npossible. Do you mean Phobia is alive? But why would you want to \nbring him back? Wasn&#39;t he a trator?&quot;\n\nStarscream also pondered a messages she got from Destructor.\n\n&quot;Why would we want the Maximals as allies? It wasn&#39;t all Maximals who \nput us in this predicament. It was the Maximals fault too. I thought \nwe were going to destroy them when we defeated Megatron?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois again looked puzzled.\n\n&quot;Mind what? What arew you talking about? I am Vulois, Alliance \nWarrior. Always have been, always will be. Again, why have you \nbrought me here?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nTamron and Savage went ut of range of the Maximals. They seperated \nand watched the battle in cloak.\n\n&quot;Sir, what about Slayer?&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s a warrior. He loves to fight. He will come eventually. Leave \nhim for now. He&#39;s winning. But our job is to wait until they contact \nthe other Maximal base, and we can track it down. That is where \nSpears will be.&quot;\n\nThey waited for the transmission. All except for Ignatius, who was \nworking on a quicker way.........\n\n\n"}}
