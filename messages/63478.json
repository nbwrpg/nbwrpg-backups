She could smell his scent, feel his\ntouch, see his smile, know he was there. For a moment longer, she\ncould love him and show it. It wasn&#39;t long until they reached the\nbase. She kept a smile on her face, though her spark was breaking. \nShe knew what she had to do. Letting him go would be the greatest test\nof her existance.  She knew she would have to be strong. &quot;Hey, well,\nlooks like we about made it.&quot;  She glanced up and saw Silence slying\nup above.  She motioned for the bot to come down.\n\n********\n\nSilence::\nShe spotted the motion and swooped down.

I&#39;m starved. How about you?&quot; She wasn&#39;t really\nhungry, but it would give her an excuse to slip away and fulfill her\nplan to ease her pain.  \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice::\n&gt;  \n&gt; He nodded to her comment.  One less thing to worry about.  He had\nenough to worry about already, but this was a welcome relief.  They\nmade good time back to base, and Malice had pulled Wolfblade close and\nput his arm around her.  he knew she hurt over their relationship, he\nknew Blacknightmare felt the same way.  But there was no good way to\nsolve it without everyone being hurt, not that he could see.  So for\nnow, things would have to remain as they were, and hope nothing turned\nsour between the three of them.  \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
