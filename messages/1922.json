She poured the remaining water back into the stream and then set it down beside of her, it was then that she heard foot steps coming towards the cave opening from Rowdy&#39;s cave.\nZyber turned and say Striker walking out of the darkness of the cave, she widened her optics in surprise...he shouldn&#39;t be up!\nShe rose to her feet after placing the bowl on the ground and walked up beside of Striker, concern written on her face.*\n\n&quot; Please do not leave, you are not healed completely yet.&quot;\n\n* If anything she didn&#39;t want him to go wounded but if he insisted then she could at least give him some of those herbs to take with him, she didn&#39;t want him to die just as she wanted no bot to die.\nShe kept an optic on him as she walked beside of him.*\n\n&quot; Or at least let me get you some of those herbs to take with you, please?&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
