I must&#39;ve ended up there so ma=\r\nny times that I lost count.  But it wasn&#39;t for stupid reasons, usually beca=\r\nuse of freak ambush attempts by Decepticon speedsters.  I sure hated those =\r\nguys, I wasn&#39;t as fast as they were and they knew it.  So of course they&#39;d =\r\nalways chose me as their target.  Ratchet was aware of that, and he never g=\r\not agitated when I came in.  But what was worse, I&#39;d never hear the end of =\r\nit from Sunstreaker and Sideswipe.  Slag, those two were always rank&#39;n on m=\r\ne.  But I tried ta ignore &#39;em.  Then one day, Ohh this is sweet, one day it=\r\n happened again and I wound back up in Ratchet&#39;s office. Tucson was mak&#39;n a=\r\n delivery of supplies before he got shot blind, and those two were pull&#39;n t=\r\nheir scrap on me.  Well, not only did he hear them, he saw them do&#39;n it and=\r\n slag, you didn&#39;t wanna be around Tucson that time, because he had the look=\r\n of destruction in his eyes.  Now mind ya, they knew better not ta scrap ar=\r\nound with him because he&#39;d slag &#39;em real good if they did.  All they had ta=\r\n do was look into his optics and they turned around and apologized ta me wi=\r\nthout a single word outa Tucson&#39;s mouth.  After that, it never happened aga=\r\nin.&quot;\n\nHe sighs gently.\n\n&quot; Happy ta say that there was never any ridicule ev=\r\ner said about anyone after that.  Optimus was glad about that, so he let Tu=\r\ncson&#39;s temper slide somewhat.  It kept the speedsters in line and guys like=\r\n us, Hound, Trail Breaker, and Beach Comber were happy not ta get ranked on=\r\n because of our lack of speed.  And definitely no one ever messed with Ratc=\r\nhet.  Ohh no, that was considered taboo.
