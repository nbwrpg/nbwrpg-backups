The ground was once again scorched and stained with the\nmech\n&gt; fluid from the various wounded bots. Answering an earlier distress call\nfrom\n&gt; an unknown bot he raced in for the rescue. He found the source of the\n&gt; communication holding himself up facing off against Mobster.(The call was\n&gt; Razor Claws request for reinforcements) Necromancer yelled, trying to be\n&gt; heard above the battle, &quot;Leave the microbot be and try someone a little\n&gt; bigger.&quot; With his brave words he  launched five fireballs at Mobster\nhoping\n&gt; to force him away from the injured bot.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
