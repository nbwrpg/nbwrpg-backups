Rodimus, the former leader of the Maximals \non this planet had left Earth with his family, to hunt down Unicron. \nIt turned out to be futile. They then returned to Cybertron and \nhelped overthrow the controlling Tripredacus government. The \nMaximals had regained control of the Transformers homeworld.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the meantime the transwarp rift through time has allowed a full \nCybertronian civilization to inhabit Past-Earth with multiple cities \nand cultures. All of this before the human race develops and while \ntheir Cybertronian past lays dorment in a volcano where the Autobot \nStarship Ark had crashed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is the new age of the Neo Beast Wars!\n&gt;  \n&gt; A small Cybertronian craft comes through the rift. Sometrhing is \nwrong, the ship is out of control. The pilot... A father, a Maximal \nleader, an Autobot legend, is unable to stabalize the ship. The \nship, that carries his wife and daughter, crashes on the planet \nsurface. It is beyond repair and the Transformers onboard are in \nstasis lock.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It begins...\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;  Read only the mail you want - Yahoo!
