He stops and looks around the room. Most of the walls were covered with vines, this room as dark as the others. Broken glass covered the floor, reflecting the light off of Zardus&#39;s gun. His scanners reported that whatever was alive was in this room, but there was nothing moving.\n\nOne of the vines suddenly moves, Zardus aiming his gun at it. His eyes narrow.\n\n&quot;Wheeljack, can you get a clear scan on that?&quot; he asks. His scanners could only say that whatever it was used energon, but couldn&#39;t identify it further.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Wheeljack/Hurricane:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::They continue to follow Zardus::\n\n\n"}}
