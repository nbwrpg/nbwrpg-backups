Therefore 8 singular blasts \nare legal.\n\n#2 Ill change that\n\n#3 both ships are going down soon.\n\n#4 Its a beam of light it goes through the shield like sunlight does\n\n#5 Its not teleportation its an advanced transport system. Yan has the \nbio for the ship in which it is explained\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll reply to the post when I get a response.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Legendarynemasis@a... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, June 05, 2001 12:27 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The violators shields quickly went down as the scorpion tank with \nSkywarp was \n&gt;   launched off the trainer base. A door opened below the ship and \nthe scorpion \n&gt;   tank quickly entered as did Gemini 1 and two. Vile turns to Gemini \n1 and 2 \n&gt;   and growls. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Vile: &quot;Cyanide may be caught but now these fools will all be \ndestroyed! \n&gt;   Goodbye Cyanide you haved risked yourself for us all.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;   And with that Vile opened a small compartment at his control \nconsole and \n&gt;   pressed it. Immeidately two Mega photon torpedoes, six photon \ntorpedoes, four \n&gt;   laser cannons, the four multi phase laser cannons, and both mega \ncannons, \n&gt;   shooting 3 shots each opened fire on the triaer base followed by a \nmassive \n&gt;   blast fired at the base from the Vile cannon. As this happened \nVile shook his \n&gt;   head and began to walk away when the Violator was hammered by 8 \nmassive \n&gt;   blasts causing the ship to shake violently and throw Vile and \nMethos from \n&gt;   where they were standing. Vile then got up and growls as Gemini 2 \nrushed to \n&gt;   his console and brought up a visual of a massive portal, with an \ninfecticon \n&gt;   ship exiting it and hovering over the trainer base. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Vile: &quot;Infecticons... prepare to open fire on that ship with \neverything we \n&gt;   have.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;   On the Infecticon ship two black beings seemingly made of energy \nlook at two \n&gt;   orbs in front of them, one displaying Predacon and X-Predacon \nenergy \n&gt;   signatures as well as some unknown types. One orb begins to glow \nas in the \n&gt;   center of the large dark control room a bright circle of light \nappears. As \n&gt;   this happens, a column of light shines striaght down and into the \ntrainer \n&gt;   base(dont worry this isnt an attack) and engulfs cyanide,  who \nimmediately \n&gt;   goes into a panick. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Cyanide: &quot;No they&#39;re here! Help! Help!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;   As cyanide screams 8 rings appear around him before he himself \nturns into a \n&gt;   being of light. Soon he dissapears with the rings forming a sort \nof bulge in \n&gt;   the column which quickly speeds up the beam of light and into the \nInfecticon \n&gt;   ship... \n&gt;         Yahoo!
