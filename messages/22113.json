And no I don&#39;t think \nyou&#39;re demonic.  There were many times when I wanted to kill my family.  I \nnever did exactly.  Although they are all dead.  The first to go was my \nbrother who died in a horrible accident.  I was very angry at my family by \nthen and I convinced my mother it was her fault.  She eventually committed \nsuicide.  My father followed shortly there after.  Did I mention I was only \nan adolescent by that time?&quot;  She smiles at him and says &quot;But hey let&#39;s not \ntalk about our pasts, considering the fact that we are in our own pasts.&quot;\n\n"}}
