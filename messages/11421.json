She fired \nthree more missles at him, and with her &#39;spider leg machine guns&#39; began to \nsweep  the battle field.\n    Paralysis continued to fire at Rush. He tried to take a few shots at his \nhead, but settled for his stomach.\n\n    Aerostreak emerged behinde Black Aracnia and Paralysis. Following him \nwere Adrax, Grappler, Guantix, Nighteyes, Paddletail, and Aquarious. Aracnia \nturned to see them with surprize.\n    &quot;What the hell?&quot; She snapped, aiming her gun at them.\n    &quot;I am Adrax. Im sure you know me. I met these Predacons who wish to join \nyou agianst the Maximals. Also, they have tree Maximals prisoners.&quot; He said, \ngruffly.\n    Black Aracnia tossed he idea in her head around, but then a pulse flair \nshot just over her head and she had to make a snap decision. &quot;Alright, we&#39;ll \ntake them! Adrax take them into the ship and we will talk alter. Secure the \nMaximals first and foremost.&quot;\n\n"}}
