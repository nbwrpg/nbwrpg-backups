Nice to\nmeet.....&quot;\n\n * But Prowl had gone to help Inny and he was left\nalone, a blast hit him in the leg and he almost\ncollapsed. He growled and renued his fire at the bots.\nA signal came through via his com-link. It was from\nhis sister. He listened carefully, and then nodded.\nShe was right, and no matter what he wanted to do to\nthese, these, BOTS, he didn&#39;t want to ruin an\nalliance, that could be nasty. He put away his\nelectric blaster and dogged the blasts that still\ncame. He then limped off into the bushes, and began to\nhobble to the ark, or what was left of it anyway.*\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n * Shadow Cat had really not paid attention to the Ark\nwhen she had come, but now saw that it was partially\nblown-up. She growled. Imature or what! I mean,\nblowing up the Ark for some misunderstanding! She\nsighed again. When will she learn to keep out of\nothers business!*\n&gt; Prowl looks at Snow Tech as he runs up to him.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages with Yahoo!
