He would\nhave to\n&gt; chat with him later about this annoying agenda of his. But more\n&gt; interesting was the Damaged Iron Raptor. He had so wanted to deal\nwith\n&gt; her personally, but, he knew to take and opportunity when the chance\n&gt; came. He aimed his fusion cannon downwards, and took aim on Iron\nRaptor,\n&gt; and let loose the torrent of pink energy, the blast&#39;s power pushing\nhim\n&gt; higher upwards, as the stream headed straight for Iron Raptor.\n\n\n"}}
