The first thing he saw=\r\n was pitch black, until he realized he had yet to hvae his optics open.  In=\r\n the beginning, he wasn&#39;t quite sure if he wanted to open them, for fear th=\r\nat he might go back to that infra-red vision.....for fear that he might sti=\r\nll hear that same droning phrase.....for fear he might see that same object=\r\n being waved in front of his face.  However, he decided to take the chance =\r\nbecause one thing was different, and that was the fact that there was no ch=\r\nill on his back.  In fact, he wasn&#39;t even on his back, but rather, laying w=\r\nith his back up.  When he took a look to see where he was, he couldn&#39;t make=\r\n out anything because his face was buried into a soft sediment of sorts.  H=\r\ne opened his mouth, just a little tad, in hopes of letting out even a small=\r\n gasp, to reassure himself that he was alive.  Bad timing...a swift wind dr=\r\nifted low across the ground, and he found himself getting on his knees and =\r\nspitting out sand that just went into his mouth.  Once that little episode =\r\nwas sorted out, he looked around.  The land wasn&#39;t too barren, but it was a=\r\n bit scorched by the sun that loomed above him.  And it wasn&#39;t until after =\r\nhe took in his surroundings that he was hit by the fact that he was no long=\r\ner inside a building, and there was nobody in his immediate vicinity, not t=\r\no mention that his vision and hearing were restored.  He tried to stand up,=\r\n but he failed and fell back to his knees.  He made a second attempt, and t=\r\nhis time got on both feet.  However, he was quite shaky, and it was almost =\r\nas if he hadn&#39;t stood on two legs in eons.  Although slow and a bit wobbly,=\r\n he made his way across the land, and paused.  In the distance, he saw a tu=\r\nndra, and in it two creatures of which he&#39;d never seen before were leaping =\r\nwith grace and speed.  This fascinated him, and then his spirit became brig=\r\nhter as it occurred to him that there was indeed some life on this rock, an=\r\nd that the chances of other creatures like him being here were a bit higher=\r\n.\n\n&quot;Is there anybody out there!?&quot; he managed to yell out in a dry voice thr=\r\nough a mouth that hadn&#39;t spoken in ages.\n\nHis voice trailed through the air=\r\n as he fell forward onto his knees, and had his head in his hands...\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0029_01C31FA9.CB553940\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2800.1126&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3D&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;His mind instantly came \nback to, after being unconscio=\r\nus for God knows how many \ndays...weeks...............solar cycles, even.&n=\r\nbsp; The first thing he saw was \npitch black, until he realized he had yet =\r\nto hvae his optics open.&nbsp; In the \nbeginning, he wasn&#39;t quite sure if h=\r\ne wanted to open them, for fear that he \nmight go back to that infra-red vi=\r\nsion.....for fear that&nbsp;he&nbsp;might \nstill hear that same droning phr=\r\nase.....for fear he might see that same object \nbeing waved in front of his=\r\n face.&nbsp; However, he&nbsp;decided to take the \nchance because one thing=\r\n was different, and that was the fact that&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT \nface=3D&quot;Courier Ne=\r\nw&quot;&gt;there was no chill on his back.&nbsp; In fact, he wasn&#39;t even \non his ba=\r\nck, but rather, laying with his back up.&nbsp; When he took a look to \nsee =\r\nwhere he was, he couldn&#39;t make out anything because his face was buried int=\r\no \na soft sediment&nbsp;of sorts.&nbsp; He opened his mouth, just a little =\r\ntad, in \nhopes of letting out even a small gasp, to reassure himself that h=\r\ne was \nalive.&nbsp; Bad timing...a swift wind drifted low across the ground=\r\n, and he \nfound himself getting on his knees and spitting out sand that jus=\r\nt went into his \nmouth.&nbsp; Once that little episode was sorted out, he l=\r\nooked around.&nbsp; \nThe land wasn&#39;t too barren, but it was a bit scorched =\r\nby the sun that loomed \nabove him.&nbsp; And it wasn&#39;t until after he took =\r\nin his surroundings that he \nwas hit by the fact that he was no longer insi=\r\nde a building, and there was \nnobody in his immediate vicinity, not to ment=\r\nion that his vision and hearing \nwere restored.&nbsp; He tried to stand up,=\r\n but he failed and fell back to his \nknees.&nbsp; He made a second attempt,=\r\n and this time got on both feet.&nbsp; \nHowever, he was quite shaky, and it=\r\n was&nbsp;almost as if he hadn&#39;t stood on two \nlegs in eons.&nbsp; Although=\r\n slow and a bit wobbly, he made his way across the \nland, and paused.&nbsp;=\r\n In the distance, he saw a tundra, and in it two \ncreatures of which he&#39;d&n=\r\nbsp;never&nbsp;seen before were leaping with grace and \nspeed.&nbsp; This f=\r\nascinated him, and then his spirit became brighter as it \noccurred to him t=\r\nhat&nbsp;there was indeed some life on this rock, and that the \nchances of =\r\nother creatures like him being here were a bit \nhigher.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Courier New&quot; size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Courier New&quot; size=3D2&gt;&quot;Is there anybody out there!?&quot; he managed \nto y=\r\nell out in a dry voice through a mouth that hadn&#39;t spoken in \nages.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Courier New&quot; size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3D&quot;Courier New&quot; size=3D2&gt;His voice trailed through the air as he \nf=\r\nell&nbsp;forward onto his knees, and had his head in his \nhands...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0029_01C31FA9.CB553940--\r\n\n"}}
