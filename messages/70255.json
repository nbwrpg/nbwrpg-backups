He thinks=\r\n back to the time when he did his best to cause a diversion that would have=\r\n allowed Rodimus to escape free of harm.  But instead of that happening, he=\r\n had been shot and taken off line before he had the chance to save him.  Fo=\r\nr that he felt guilty.  He looks to Night Shift, who quickly gets the idea =\r\nof what he&#39;s trying to tell him.\n\n&quot; Right, change of plans again. Here, gim=\r\nme Windlord&#39;n I&#39;ll make sure he gets outa here safely with Perceptor&#39;n Nigh=\r\ntlight.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime hands him Windlord as Night Shift takes the same gen=\r\ntile approach as did he.  He looks to Perceptor.\n\n&quot; Okay, change of plans, =\r\nwe&#39;re outa here and they&#39;re stayn&#39; behind.  C&#39;mon, we gotta burn rubber!&quot;\n\n=\r\nTucson Prime then looks to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; No Rodimus, this isn&#39;t all your faul=\r\nt.  A lot of it if not all of it, is actually my fault.  The day we fought =\r\noff Hydras&#39;s lackies two years ago, I had managed to deal with the ones I w=\r\nas fighting against and saw that you, Nightlight and Windlord were in despe=\r\nrate need of help.  So I went as fast as I could, to try and divert enemy f=\r\nire away from you, but I failed to check a blind spot in my rear view mirro=\r\nr, and I was shot from behind, rendering me inoperable and blind.  If I had=\r\n just taken more careful survey of what was around me, none of this, includ=\r\ning what happened to you, would never have happened.  Now, now is the time =\r\nto make it up to you.  We&#39;ll fight them together.  Scorponok doesn&#39;t scare =\r\nme, none of them do.  All right Jhiaxus, don&#39;t expect me to make this easy =\r\nfor you because I&#39;m not!  As I&#39;ve said to Scorponok before, I will not fold=\r\n to any of you, no matter what damages you instill on me!  \n\nOutside the fo=\r\nrtress, Rat Trap transforms into rat form and scrambles for thick brush, tr=\r\nying to virtually vanish into the vegitation in an alluding maneuver.  Mean=\r\nwhile, Quickstride remains in equine form, and continues to kick, buck, sto=\r\nmp, and even motion to bite the enemies if they get too close.  With his ea=\r\nrs aback, smoke billows from his flairing nostrills.  As his hooves slam on=\r\n the ground the ground around them vibrates, due to the sheer force of his =\r\nquick but strong movements.\n\n&quot;looks like these chumps are just itching ta b=\r\ne turned inta scrap yard material!&quot;\n\nRat Trap tries an evasive maneuver whi=\r\nle scampering in a figure eight pattern beneath his enemies, hoping that th=\r\ney&#39;d accidentally crash into each other, due to the dizzing motions he&#39;s ma=\r\nking.\n\n&quot; Then allow me ta help.  I may not have the umph you got, but I cer=\r\ntainly got the brains for the job.. &quot;\n\n \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Pr=\r\neston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt;\n&gt; Who: RODIMUS PRIME, CYCLONUS,=\r\n SCOURGE, JHIAXUS, SCORPONOK, Tuscon,\n&gt; Nightshift, Darkhawk, Perceptor\n&gt; L=\r\nocation: Black Fortress - Tunnels beneath the Black Fortress\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Dont c=\r\nross in my way, Rodimus&quot;while he tried to hold his emotions that for\n&gt; &gt; fi=\r\nrst time in centuries overhelmed him &quot;I dont want to have to destroy\n&gt; &gt; yo=\r\nu...

He orients his weapon again, trying to f=\r\nind a shot that wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; kill him but would look good when the sound of f=\r\nalling earth could be\n&gt; heard echoing from down the tunnel, and the distinc=\r\nt sound of drilling\n&gt; erupted into the hall for a moment and then grinds to=\r\n a stop.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus turned his weapon to face this new threat as Cyclonus=\r\n and\n&gt; Jhiaxus step from the hole in the wall, one obviously made by\n&gt; Skor=\r\nponok who was still in Scorpion mode.

Get\n&gt; Nightlight and Windlord out of here! This is my mess, and I=\r\n will\n&gt; finish it! GO!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus turned to face the slowly advancing De=\r\ncepticons.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: I have a few plans for Rodimus, but feel f=\r\nree to stay or go as\n&gt; you folks see fit)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
