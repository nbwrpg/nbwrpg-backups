Name&#39;s \n&gt; KitKat, Predacon Warrior.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but notice his well \n&gt; built physical attributes. She couldn&#39;t show it, but she was smiling \n&gt; like  young wolf pup inside. &quot;I wish to thank you for fixing me. I \n&gt; don&#39;t know what happened. One minute I&#39;m training battle techniques, \n&gt; the next, I&#39;m walking through the woods with a belly ache and from \n&gt; there, it gets kind of fuzzy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cam::\n&gt; She walked up to KitKat and tapped at her other hand. &quot;Hey, I was the \n&gt; one that found you. I&#39;m Cam. He just brought you here. I found you \n&gt; and wanted to keep you, but Blackfang said I had to ask.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t help but smile at the little bot. &quot;Oh really? You found \n&gt; me huh? Then I owe you a thank you.&quot;  She knelt down and patted the \n&gt; litle bot on the shoulder, looking into the little one&#39;s \n&gt; optics. &quot;That was a very brave thing you did. A maximal wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; normally approach a predacon like me. You are very brave and a very \n&gt; bold warrior little one. Keep it up.&quot;\n&gt; Then she stood up and looked at Blackfang. She couldn&#39;t figure out \n&gt; why they didn&#39;t just leave her to die. After all, that&#39;s what a \n&gt; predacon or decepticon would have done. She smiled at him, letting \n&gt; her optics show the gratitude as well as her face plates. &quot;So, I \n&gt; guess I owe you a thanks as well huh? Oh Maximal Knight?&quot; her voice \n&gt; soft and light.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Blackfang stood up.
