The lizard crawled from his cavern \nand watched as the bots retrned. Drill bit, apocalypse, hell beast, cerberus, \nkillfest,  zardus.... all supplied dna to begin his perfect body. The bots \nentered him. The lizard glowed. It grew into a cacoon. It hovered in the air. \nThe glow was so bright it could be seen from miles around. All it needed was \nthat burst of energy it needed to finish the transformation. Clouds covered \nthe area. The glow of the egg grew brighter drawing the storm. A bolt of \nlighting shot the egg. It craked. Out came a bot long since forgotten. His \nrobot mode finished. He had the hard shelled armor of zardus. The eyes of \nKillfest. He had cerberus&#39;s tatical ability&#39;s in his head. He had \napocalypse&#39;s dragon mode. And he had Drill bit&#39;s drill mode. He had hell \nbeast&#39;s evil desire for death and destruction. (like he needs more.)  He had \nno expression on his face. His desire to become his perfect form was drawing \nhim on now. He had his list that he needed to finish. He locked on his first \ntarget. He wanted his ultimate beast mode form. And his assasin skills to be \nfully restored and to do so his first two victims where perfect for it. He \nmust absorb them. he took off. His speed made a deep gash it the ground as he \nflew.\n\n"}}
