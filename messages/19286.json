It nullified thier ability to communicate. The virus \neventually spread until they were wiped out.&quot; he wasn&#39;t afraid for \nher at the moment, he was afraid of the effects that would occur if \nit spread through her telepathy.\n\n&quot;If I give you a small dose it should weaken your telepathy, I just \ndon&#39;t know what other effects it may have.&quot;\n He didn&#39;t have to say it but the biggest thought going through his \nmind was that he&#39;d never used the virus on a protoform.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She tried to calm herself.  She heard what Veratis said and could \n&gt; tell that he ws uncertain about this virus of his.  &quot;Veratis, what \n&gt; would this, virus of yours do? You said it slowly down the \ntranslife \n&gt; abillities. But what exactly does that mean?&quot;  She could feel the \n&gt; form changing and developing into something, but what that was she \n&gt; didn&#39;t know. She cold feel the outside of the protoform, her new \n&gt; body, start to grow skin and fur.  She was very scared.  She didn&#39;t \n&gt; know what was happening or why. Her thoughts ran in a million \n&gt; directiosns at once, with fearful questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Veratis, you said you didn&#39;t know what would happen if you give \nthis \n&gt; virus to me.  What do you think would happen? I don&#39;t know what is \n&gt; ging on, but, if you htink it will help...&quot;  she stopped and sayed \na \n&gt; prayer to the matrix, which Veratis may have heard in his mind.&quot;Do \n&gt; it.&quot;\n&gt; She just hoped that this was the right thing to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Shadow Wings Scream echoed through Veratis&#39; mind causing him to \n&gt; clench his\n&gt; &gt; forhead. &quot;My dear, please don&#39;t panic&quot; he said out loud still \n&gt; trying to\n&gt; &gt; figure out what had happened. He studied the insturments \ncarefully \n&gt; trying to\n&gt; &gt; find the logic to the situation. The sensors showed nothing more \n&gt; than a\n&gt; &gt; normal protoform with the basic abilities of such. He could see \nthe \n&gt; fur\n&gt; &gt; beginning to form. It had to be slowed until Lunarpine \n&gt; returned. &quot;I&#39;m afraid\n&gt; &gt; that theres only one alternative.&quot; He thought about the virus \n&gt; again, he\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t want to use it not knowing what side effects it might have \n&gt; but he\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t want her suffering any longer than she had to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to be honest with you&quot; he said using a slow bedside \n&gt; manner voice\n&gt; &gt; He saw no reason to lie to her when she could read his mind. &quot;I \n&gt; developed a\n&gt; &gt; type of virus that slows down translife abilities, I&#39;d prefer not \n&gt; to use it\n&gt; &gt; but it could help you adapt, the choice is yours.&quot; he was up \n&gt; against a wall\n&gt; &gt; in this situation. Shadow Wing was confused and it seemed she was\n&gt; &gt; frightened. In a way he was frightened too. But such choices were \n&gt; best left\n&gt; &gt; to the patient, not the (Mad) scientist.\n\n\n"}}
