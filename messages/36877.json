Grizzltron gets \ndown lower and waits with his grenade launcher for the new guest.  \nGrizzltron barely hears something about friends, but he thinks it just the \ntwo bots talking outside.  Grizzltron then yells out in a Low and Harse \nvoice, &quot;Ahhh, I can&#39;t come out, I broke my leg, you have to come in here.&quot;  \nGrizzltron just waited with his Grenade Launcher waiting too.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
