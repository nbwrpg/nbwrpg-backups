When ever you need energy, you can tape the NetWork and take \nenergy from the vok creations. But because you disconnected your self  they \ncannot draw energy form you. you tape energy by focusing on a web of energy \nin your mind and the energy just comes in till you stop! Do this for me and \nthen you may go. but beware, the powers can cause evil. And someone close to \nyou will die I know this.\n\n"}}
