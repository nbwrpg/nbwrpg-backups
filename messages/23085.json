Ice opened her mind to\nLunarpine &quot;Be careful my love, I don&#39;t want anything to happen to your\nbeautiful pelt.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll take that as an order&quot; Replied Lunarpine mentally back to Ice.\n\nIce looked around, &quot;Any idea where the conference rooms are?&quot; she asked out\nloud, hoping open communication wouldn&#39;t arouse any suspicion.\n\n&quot;Sorry Ice, I&#39;ve only been here once.&quot; Lunarpine sniffed the air, &quot;I&#39;m\ngetting a bunch of scents this way, if we follow them it should lead us to\nthe meeting.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then let&#39;s go, we haven&#39;t flown all this way to stand here talking.&quot; Ice\ncould sound more confident now that she was on friendly ground.

He acted ready to snap, she\nhoped that he&#39;d be able to hold his temper until they were far away.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
