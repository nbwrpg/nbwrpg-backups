Her logic circiuts and her vocal \nwiring were not working straight all of a sudden. She went over to the table \nand started working on the equipment that Scorponok had told her to work on. \n  In the middle of fixing one of his tables, she walked over to him and \nwhispered into his ear, &quot;I like you a lot too commander. Sorry for being \nsuch an idiot earlier.  By vocal circuits got tied up.  But your not so bad \nlooking yourself commander.&quot;\nShe smiled at him the reflected the warmth in her spark for him.  Then she \nturned back to the table and finished working on the hydrolics on it.\n\n\n---------Original Message--------------\nFrom:   &lt;crow_lord@h...&gt;\nDate: Mon Jun 26, 2000 3:44am\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nScorponok\n\n&quot;Well, I mainly asked you in here for thoese questions but if your\nnot\nto busy, can you hook up these gizmos to that thingy over there.&quot;\nScorponok pointed to the &#39;gizmos&#39; and &#39;thingy&#39;.
