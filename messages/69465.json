H=\r\nis tires roll over the ground slowly as bits of debris and gravel crumble b=\r\neneath their treads.  Lucky for everyone and himself, his engine was silent=\r\n enough to go un detected and at his present speed, not much noise was foll=\r\nowing the roll of his tires.  The ping was bouncing off more and more and g=\r\netting louder to him.  He keeps on his present course, then stops a moment,=\r\n as the ping veers slightly to the right.  He pivots his tires and rolls sl=\r\nowly in that direction, following the reverberations to the letter.  All th=\r\ne while, keeping his speed down to five miles per hour.  He knew about movi=\r\nng cautiously.  It was what saved him in battle up to the point where he tr=\r\nied to do something beyond his physical capabilities, while acting as a dec=\r\noy to the Decepticons to try and lure them away from his comrades.  He was =\r\nthinking of that moment now.  What if it were to be a repeat of that day?  =\r\n\n\nAgain he comes to a careful stop.  He keeps reminding himself to remain c=\r\nautious because what was out there now, was completely unknown.\n\n&quot; I copy y=\r\nour transmission Lord Perseus.

We will keep you=\r\n posted if we discover anything new.&quot;\n\nThe ping comes on strong.  And enoug=\r\nh to startle Tucson again.  He jumps out of SUV mode and back into robot mo=\r\nde, with his cross bow in hand.\n\n&quot; That was a little too close for comfort.=\r\n  Ravenchief, Guardia, do you see anything I may be missing?
