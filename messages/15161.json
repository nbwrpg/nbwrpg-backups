The weather was \nsimilar to where his beast form had assimilated itself so that wasn&#39;t \nthe reason. His scanners showed that he was in the right place but \nthere was no sign that anything had landed there recently. Over the \nnext hill he heard the roar of an animal, one native to the planet. \nHe approached with caution and saw a large Polar bear stuck by what \nappeared to be an electronic net generator. the more the bear \nstruggled the more it was shocked. Lunarpine raised his rifle and \nblasted the generator. The bear still didn&#39;t seem very happy about \nbeing trapped. It charged the first thing it saw move. unfortunately \nfor Lunarpine that thing was him. He didn&#39;t want to kill the beast \nafter freeing it from its trap but he wasn&#39;t on the menu either. The \nbear swiped at Lunarpine knocking him off his robotic feat. The polar \nbear pounced on top of him biting and clawing for all it was worth. \nLunarpine drew his claws and took a mighty swipe slashing the bear \nacross the shoulder. the bear rolled off. The beast rose to it&#39;s feat \nand scampered off without more of a fight.\n\nLunarpine stood confused, he didn&#39;t hit it very hard. at least not \nhard enough to scare it off like that. He heard a voice from behind \nhim.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re welcome&quot; the voice said. \n\nLunarpine turned to see the face of another bot, an older model than \nhimself. &quot;What did you do to it?&quot; the wolfbot asked\n\n&quot;I hit it with a nutritional supplement with just a touch of stun \njuice.&quot; The bot lowered it&#39;s weapon, &quot;Now will you tell me why you \nlet it go before I could examine it?&quot;\n\n&quot;You had it in a net, I thought you meant to harm it.&quot; Lunarpine \nresponded with a suspicious glare in his eye\n\n&quot;Why don&#39;t we discuss this further inside? My name&#39;s Veratis, I&#39;m a \nscientist from a settlement called Paradrose.&quot; The old bot had an odd \nface almost like it wasn&#39;t formed to match his beastmode. But so far \nVeratis showed no reason not to be trusted so Lunarpine followed him \ninto what appeared to be a cave when in accuality it was a ship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
