At least he wasn&#39;t in a hurry \nto get rid of her, yet.  \n&quot;I&#39;m here to try to help initiate peace talks.  My friends and I are \nasking all the leaders to our embassy so that they might meet face to \nface and talk about creating peace between the Predacons and the \nMaximals.&quot; She looked down for a moment. &quot;It&#39;s not easy. But that is \nthe goal, to create a lasting peace.&quot;\nShe just stood there looking at Firearm.  She hoped that he would \nbelieve her. Right now, she was looking for all the allies she could \nget.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Firearm::\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm smiles, seeing that this bot had her head on straight (not \nwanting to \n&gt; be killed).\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m Firearm, nice to meet you,&quot; he says in a cheery tone, noticing \nthat she \n&gt; was looking at his arm cannon, &quot;That&#39;s kinda unremovable.
