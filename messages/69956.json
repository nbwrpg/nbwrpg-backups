Inside he could feel his heart thumping =\r\na mile a minute.  There was no denying it, this feeling was genuine, and of=\r\n all bots he never thought he too would feel this way about a femme. But th=\r\nere it was, the utmost of sincerity, compassion and love.  He couldn&#39;t quit=\r\ne tell Lord Elder, Kup or Elita that love was his first objective, because =\r\nhe didn&#39;t know if they&#39;d understand. Even a Prime has to fib a little at so=\r\nme point, just as long as it was harmless.  In this case, it truely was.  H=\r\ne couldn&#39;t deny it, Like Rodimus, who had fallen in love with Nightlight, h=\r\ne was definitely in love with Talon.\n\n&quot; I&#39;d never forget about you Talon.  =\r\nAs a matter of fact, you were the main reason why I came here.  I - had to =\r\ntell Lord Elder a slight fib because if he ever knew the real reason why I =\r\nleft, I - don&#39;t know if he&#39;d really understand it..

He looks to Depthcharge and=\r\n the others.\n\n&quot; I hope, I hope, I hope...  It&#39;s a match made on Cybertron y=\r\na know. I think Wheels is a little bit of a shy guy, and ya know if this wo=\r\nrks, I think he&#39;ll come outa that tiny shell of his.&quot;\n\nTucson gently takes =\r\nTalon&#39;s other hand and gently gives her a kiss on her cheek.  After realizi=\r\nng his actions, that slight shade of red returns around his faceplate.\n\n&quot; O=\r\nh, wow, where did - that come from? I - hope I didn&#39;t offend you in any way=\r\n.&quot;\n\nRat Trap catches his kiss out of the corner of his eye and soon a grin =\r\ngrows from one corner of his face to the other.\n\n&quot; Way ta go Wheels.&quot;  \n\nTu=\r\ncson couldn&#39;t help but rest an arm over Talon&#39;s shoulder.  He wanted very m=\r\nuch to seal a relationship yet he didn&#39;t want to appear too forward at the =\r\nsame time.  Yet, at this moment, even through the darkest of times, a sheer=\r\n happiness floods his emotions for the first time in ages. A happiness that=\r\n can&#39;t just be bought with power and strength alone.  \n\n&quot; I suppose I bette=\r\nr tell Lord Elder the Truth shouldn&#39;t I?  But I&#39;d like very much for you to=\r\n come with me Talon. After all, My promise to you is never leave your side,=\r\n unless of course the spark in my body is extinguished through extreme mean=\r\ns.  Other than that, nothing and no one will tear us apart.&quot;\n\nHe looks into=\r\n her eyes with the utmost of sincerity.\n\n&quot;If anything were to happen to me,=\r\n the power that the Matrix has given me, I hope to pass it to you, it&#39;s my =\r\nwish, and my promise.
