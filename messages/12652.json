She touched the \npanel and it crumbled away into ash and small metal bits.  She sighed \ndeeply. &quot;This isn&#39;t my idea of an easy job.  I&#39;d like to repay the \nPreds for all this. One way or another.&quot;  \nShe opened her link. &quot;Hey, Striker could you come to the computer \nroom for a moment.  I may need you  AHHH!.&quot;  Part of the panel \nhousing collapsed and covered her with ash, soot, and bits of \ncomputer parts, wires and metal bits. She was covered and had black \nash and soot all over her face and upper body.  She frowned and \nslowly crawled out from the console.  She stood up and tried wiping \nthe soot off.  But it only smeared around, and make her look dirtier \nand messier.  Her eyes stood out in all the black on her face.  She \nlooked at herself and sighed. This wasn&#39;t her day, she thought.\n\n\n"}}
