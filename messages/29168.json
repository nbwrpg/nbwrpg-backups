If I had one like that on my crew I wouldn&#39;t just\n&gt; leave.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He pauses, his mind working on what she had said about DNA. On his\n&gt; group... From what he had understood before, Lady Hawk was trying to\n&gt; make a new type of bot with DNA from animals. He hadn&#39;t been aware\n&gt; that she was also to experiment on the DNA from the Alliance.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This group of scientists, are they after DNA like you? This planet\n&gt; is the only planet in the solar system with such lifeforms. If they\n&gt; were after DNA, they would certainly stay here instead of simply\n&gt; leaving.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk reluctantly answered the question but avoided as many of\n&gt; the facts\n&gt; &gt; as she could. &quot;I arrived with a group of scientists. I was sent\n&gt; here to\n&gt; &gt; study and experiment on the DNA of your group. you were pretty much\n&gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; center of the commotion so this seemed the proper spot to begin.&quot;\n&gt; she knew\n&gt; &gt; he wanted more than she could give without revealing information\n&gt; about her\n&gt; &gt; father and Foxfingers. &quot;I was dropped off while the others searched\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; other planets in this galaxy. I was due back weeks ago, They&#39;ve\n&gt; probably\n&gt; &gt; abandoned me by now.&quot; she hoped that Zardus wouldn&#39;t think about the\n&gt; &gt; heritage she&#39;d already revealed, She was a princess, royalty\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be\n&gt; &gt; abandoned without proof of trouble.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
