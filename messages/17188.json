She wasn&#39;t sure if she \nbelieved him or not, but he was a maximal and there for worthy for a \nchance.  She motioned him into the room where Ramulus was. &quot;Ramulus, \nThis bot wishes to speak to you for a moment.  Let me know when you \nare ready to engage your plan and I&#39;ll be there.&quot;  She walked out of \nthe room and went down the hall tot he burned out computer room.  She \nlooked around for a minute at the burned and charred remains of hte \ncomputers. &quot;Hey, Iris? Do any of the autoguns still work? We may need \nthem later on.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine wasn&#39;t threatened by this new aquaintance, he knew his \nnew form\n&gt; could easily overpower her but he&#39;d leave the fighting for the \npredacons.\n&gt; &quot;No I&#39;m not from the Cybertronian Fire, I was protecting this \nscrapheap for\n&gt; a while until I found a purpose. I went on long range recon and now \nI&#39;m\n&gt; back. Now either walk with me to Ramulus or step aside and let me \nby.&quot;\n&gt; Lunarpine didn&#39;t intend to sound cocky but he had business to \nattend to and\n&gt; wasn&#39;t in the mood for the witty game of 20 questions.\n\n\n"}}
