Hopefuylly this would be enough to protect\n&gt; the shuttle from would be thieves.\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras set out with his band of Predacons in search of Skyshadow,\n&gt; it is easy for him to see by the direction of the scanners that his\n&gt; captured Predacons had been taken almost directly to the city. Every\n&gt; scan showed the path leading in that direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; As the band continued to move forward the ground continued to get more\n&gt; and more barren. The few trees and scrub brush that had been present\n&gt; near the shuttle&#39;s landing area wee totally gone as they travelled in\n&gt; towards the city. The air itself became progressively darker and\n&gt; gloomier as the ever present smog appeared to be almost blocking out\n&gt; the sun.\n&gt;\n&gt; Approximately halfway to the city Hydras could see the city itself\n&gt; more clearly. He could see the gate that granted entry to it, as well\n&gt; as the guards that protected it. However what was more troubling was\n&gt; what appeared to be several tanks that came through the gate and began\n&gt; travelling in the direction that Hydras was travelling, thier powerful\n&gt; treads leaving small plumes of ground up dust behind them as they\n&gt; travelled. They appeared to be on an intercept course with Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
