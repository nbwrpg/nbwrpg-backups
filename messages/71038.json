Quickstride running quite a bi=\r\nt faster at his full gallop, than Uproar, who manages to keep up but by a s=\r\nlight distance.  With thundering hooves, the swift moving thoroughbread mak=\r\nes it into the field of the Ark.  Uproar trails right behind him.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re i=\r\nn Rodimus!&quot;\n\nExclaims Quickstride as Uproar sniffs around, padding about th=\r\ne Ark, as if smelling something strange.  He paces back and forth.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;=\r\nt like this, I&#39;m smelling something strange, something unidentified..&quot;\n\nHe =\r\npoints with his paw, to let Rodimus know where the scent is coming from.\n\n&quot;=\r\nIn there, that direction.&quot;\n\nQuickstride sniffs as well.\n\n&quot;Ohh boy, ohh yeah=\r\n, I smell it too.  Doesn&#39;t smell good at all..&quot;\n\nOutside the Ark, Tucson co=\r\nuld feel the explosion, as it rocks him somewhat, almost losing stability o=\r\nn his wheels.  He quickly rights himself with a bit of a struggle.\n\nInside,=\r\n Straight Shot and Rat Trap help to hold Talon steady.\n\n&quot;Woahh, wheels, are=\r\n ya okay?&quot;\n\nTucson replies.\n\n&quot;Sorry about that - Rat Trap.  The explosion c=\r\naught me - off guard a bit.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot frowns.\n\n&quot;If I were you, I&#39;d le=\r\nt Bantor and the others continue to towe ya back.. You still don&#39;t sound to=\r\no good Tucson. And don&#39;t try ta agrue with me.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;Yeah,=\r\n I&#39;m with her, you still need help, big guy.&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n\n&quot;Well, I can =\r\n not argue with any of you. I - just don&#39;t feel it is right for you to go s=\r\no much out of your way for me. All of you, have worked very hard on my beha=\r\nlf, I - do promise I will reciprocate when I am able to.&quot;\n\nRat Trap smiles.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Awwwwww, it&#39;s okay Wheels, we&#39;re your friends, and that&#39;s what friends a=\r\nre for.  You taught us how ta follow our hearts, and how ta work with the m=\r\nost simplest of means.  And it worked.  Everything that&#39;s happened, even th=\r\ne explosion, was done outa pure heart.  I dunno if I would&#39;ve ever thought =\r\nof lookn&#39; that deep down ta find resolve.  You taught me that Wheels, and y=\r\na taught everyone that it&#39;s not impossible ta fight back.  But most of all,=\r\n ya taught ALL of us how ta believe in making things better.&quot;\n\nStraight Sho=\r\nt nodds.\n\n&quot; You&#39;ve done so much for everyone all ready Tucson.  You rescued=\r\n Windlord, Nightlight, and Rodimus, and you won the loyalty of Perceptor.  =\r\nAnd all you used was your heart.&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n\n&quot; I - can not ask for a b=\r\netter group of comrades.  What I ever wanted is right here, with - all of y=\r\nou.  And - if we don&#39;t always win the battle, - it - wasn&#39;t meant to be.  A=\r\nbsolute - power can never replace what I have which I - consider most valua=\r\nble.  There is no price that can overshadow what we share.  And - there nev=\r\ner will be.&quot;\n\nHe thinks for a moment.\n\n&quot;Something, that - Hydras nor Megatr=\r\non, could ever appreciate.  I - suppose that is why Hydras is never satisfi=\r\ned with what he has.  He - always has to have more power, more dominence, m=\r\nore destructive oppression.  I  will - not feed into his hunger for such th=\r\nings.  Tables will turn, it - will just take time, my friends... It - will =\r\njust take time.&quot;\n\nHis engine cuts out once again.

A qu=\r\nick calculation gave him a true \n&gt; estimation of the size.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;NOW!&quot; Rodi=\r\nmus said as he leaped up from their place of waiting and began to \n&gt; run to=\r\nwards the shield, he holding the device in his hand. Behind him Leo \n&gt; II, =\r\nWing Caliber and Ramulus were quickly behind him.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a quick toss Ro=\r\ndimus sent his device hurtling towards the shield as he \n&gt; ran up to it. &quot;H=\r\nurry, we have only a few seconds before the shielding \n&gt; adapts!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Insi=\r\nde the Ark\n&gt; \n&gt; All of the medics, Legacy, Bump, Santon and Perceptor kept =\r\na vigil on \n&gt; Nightlight, and for the moment her vitals continued to remain=\r\n steady and \n&gt; strong even in their sedated state =E2=80&quot; her systems were =\r\nstable and running \n&gt; under their own power now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy looked up, his=\r\n optic sensor glowing strangely. &quot;Facinating&quot; he said \n&gt; as he stood up.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;What is it?&quot; Bump said as he looked over at Legacy, alarm creeping onto=\r\n his \n&gt; face and into his voice.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am detecting a distant seismic dis=\r\nturbance.&quot; Legacy said after a moment \n&gt; of contemplation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon look=\r\ned at Nightlight as if half expecting this to be affecting her. \n&gt; &quot;Where i=\r\ns it coming from?&quot; he said as he now turned to Legacy, for the \n&gt; moment co=\r\nnfident that this seemed to have no affect on their patient.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy pa=\r\nused for a moment as if examining his internal records. &quot;Unknown&quot; \n&gt; he sai=\r\nd finally. &quot;I would need full access to the Ark&#39;s sensors.&quot; Legacy \n&gt; looke=\r\nd back at Santon and Bump, &quot;However if this is indeed a result of \n&gt; Percep=\r\ntor&#39;s destruction of his former base then the exlosion was truly \n&gt; massive=\r\n on a large scale.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * * * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; As Legacy and the others talked, th=\r\ne voice that was speaking to Elita \n&gt; continued talking, &quot;Elita. I am hurt,=\r\n badly hurt.&quot; It sounded like Lord \n&gt; Elder still, but the voice was steadi=\r\nly getting weaker.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was the sound of crawling and shuffling. &quot;I w=\r\nas ambushed and knocked \n&gt; unconscious.&quot; The voice paused, &quot;Elita, where ar=\r\ne you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; With the Maximals on the way back to the Ark!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nocto=\r\nrro, Torca, I&#39;ve regained sixty percent of my energy reserve.\n&gt; &gt; It should=\r\n be enough for me to drive on my own now. I thank you\n&gt; &gt; deeply for your a=\r\nssistance, and wish not to burden you any further.\n&gt; &gt; After all, towing a =\r\nvehicle my size and weight, must put quite a strain\n&gt; &gt; on your systems. I&#39;=\r\nd rather not see that happen.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Of course.&quot; Torca said in deep tones. =\r\n&quot;We are always here for the Maximals \n&gt; and you Autobots.&quot; His tone was gra=\r\nve.\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca and Bantor who had been the actual ones to help pull began t=\r\no come to \n&gt; a slow halt. They were not fast as most vehicles go, but they =\r\nwere large \n&gt; enough. Bantor was perhaps fully the size of a large jungle c=\r\nat, but Torca \n&gt; was as large as a woolly mammoth and looked strong enough =\r\nto pull Tuscon by \n&gt; himself if necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking up Torca spoke to N=\r\noctorro, &quot;You and Quicksilver get back to the \n&gt; Ark. I think we have this =\r\nunder control, the Ark is the most important thing \n&gt; now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sir!&quot; The=\r\ny both said in unison as they both began flying off in the \n&gt; direction of =\r\nthe Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: The Maximals might notice now that communications are n=\r\no longer being \n&gt; blocked. They can communicate with each other as well as =\r\nthe Ark.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo! Gr=\r\noups Links\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
