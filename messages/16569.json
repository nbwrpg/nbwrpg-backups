If his last fluid pump expired then he \nwould die, slow and painful.\nThat was the very thing that worried him, more then anything at the moment.\nBut then, something out of nowhere came into view on his right side, \nsomething that hadn�t come into focus yet�and touched him!\nDinobot quickly stood up and snapped his entire body around, the force of \nthe action sending droplets of his own mech-fluid to splatter against \nNecromancers side.\nIt took his optic a moment to adjust; however, once it did he found no \nreason to be alarmed.\nIt was that smaller bot whom he had told to help Tavatron, one in which he \nknew not the name of.\nHe straightened himself up the best he could, taking in consideration about \njust how damaged he was and the only thing he could manage was a shoulder \nslumped stance.\nThis was all getting far too much for him, the surprise from this bot only \nfeeding his rage and speeding up his damaged systems.\nDinobot glared at the small bot for a moment before relaxing his stance a \nbit�mainly for need of relaxing the muscles in his back and preventing them \nfrom getting a charley horse.\nHe listened to his words�and for once in his life had to agree with him.\nDinobot needed help and he knew it�and would be a fool to swipe it aside \nnow.\nBut then as he was about to accept Foxfingers� assistance he heard a \nfamiliar voice, one in which was belonging to a particular femm in which was \npissing him right off at the moment.\nThe tone of her defying voice causing his head to snap in her direction, \nteeth bared and muscles strained.\nHe wouldn�t care to say so, but at this very moment he hated her�absolutely \nhated her. The sound of her voice, the feel of her aggression in the air, \neven the sight of her completely pushed his aggression further and further \nto complete and utter rage!\nTo this point he had controlled himself the best he could, and tried his \ndamnedest to keep his temper to at least a rate where he could control \nit�even barely.\nDinobot�s tail thrashed as he listened to her words, his control nearly \nbreaking and unleashing the side of him in which he hadn�t used in all his \nyears in fear of never gaining sanity back.\nHe was known for berserk fighting�which bordered at insanity�and if he had \nto use that style of combat now�so help the poor souls in his way.\nBut instead of expressing the rage in which racked at his very being, a \nsudden hush came over him as he straightened himself completely out. His \nshoulder-plates no longer slumped and his tail swaying calmly behind him.\nHe had indeed collected himself, so to the point that he was utterly beyond \nanger now�and that was death to anyone who, so much, as looked at him wrong.\nDinobot glared at Tavatron, but now his aggression was beyond expression�and \nhe simply looked at her coldly. The rage completely disappearing from his \nfeatures, though his muscles remained tense.\nThis was it, completely IT!!!\nHe had had enough of her and her back talk, and was utterly sick of her and \nher jabbering tone.*\n\n� Of COURSE it would make a difference! I, for one, would NEVER have let you \nengage in battle in the first place! Not after what it took me to get you \nback!!�\n\n* His mind was just as red hot as his temper, and if he didn�t watch himself \nhe would end up saying something�or even doing something that would \neventually tip one of them off the edge.\nBut, he wasn�t really thinking at the moment either, rather more acting then \nanything else.*\n\n� And existing as a Transmetal 2 has NOTHING to do with whether or not you \nwould have been captured. It was complete STUPIDITY, which had the result of \nyour fate.\nYou KNEW better then to simply go alone, yet you ignored your logic and left \nalone anyway!�\n\n* His clawed hands were in fists, but not a single vision of his rage had \nescaped�other then the occasional raising of his voice.\nBut it was also then that Dinobot saw Tavatrons temper slightly become more \ncontrollable, watching her every move as she approached him.\nHe say the collected anger in her optics, but even as she was now in control \nof HER anger, he knew that it was about time that he became the master of \nhis own.\nBut, that would not be easy.\nHe watched as Tavatron walked up to Necromancer, agreeing that it would be \nfar better to ride back then walk, despite his anger it was also a slight \nrelief to have her within sight and without such a high degree of risk if \nbeing attacked if she would have walked.\nDinobot turned his head towards the smaller bot by his side, Foxfinger. \nWondering vaguely if he was coming along with them.\nHis anger, strangely enough, was beginning to die down. Basically to the \npoint where he simply didn�t feel�anything.\nAnd the reason for that, though not apparent to him now, was that his \nsystems were shutting down and effecting his mental, neural capacity \ncircuits. Whish meant, soon he wouldn�t feel anything, be able to touch \nanything, be able to do anything.\nFor, his fourth fluid pump had already began to deactivated, there was just \nno extreme pain to announce it.\nThe mech-fluid flow which went to his brain to supply it with oxygen was \nbeginning to slow down, and if he wasn�t careful and wastes his time to get \nback to base, he would basically be brain dead.\nDinobot growled, the anger spiking up once again, but nothing as serious as \nbefore, more dampened and calm.\nHowever, his expression didn�t change, emotionless, cold, and aggressive.\nHe looked up at the large dragon now, seeing Tavatron comfortably resting on \nhis back, then looked back down at Foxfinger, gesturing towards \nNecromancer.*\n\n� If you are coming with us, then get on.�\n\n* His voice was harsh and wet, mech-fluid already coating the inside of his \nmouth and lips.\nDinobot didn�t wait for an answer though, there wasn�t enough time, for, he \nhad to get back to base and into a CR chamber quickly.\nHis own repair system was offline, and it had been since he had first been \nhit in the side by one of the Alliance missiles.\nHe quickly, or as quickly as he could, climbed up and onto the back of \nNecromancer, careful to make sure that he sat a good 10 feet down his back \nand away from Tavatron. He didn�t need any of her back talk now.\nAround this time his breaths were coming short, and Dinobot had to force \nhimself to let go of what anger he had in order to concentrate on breathing.\nHe quickly transformed into beast mode once he was on the back of the \ndragon, thinking that maybe there was a chance to slow down the lose of \nmech-fluid with only that once chest wound.\nDinobot looked at the perimeter of Necromancer�s back and then got into a \ncomfortable position, laying on his stomach with his head resting on his \nfront limbs�staring at Tavatron�s back.\nIf anything, he was about ready to depart. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
