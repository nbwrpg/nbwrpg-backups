He pulled up and changed his course, \nheading for Asia and his velocity increasing.\n\nHe sent out a comm. to everyone who had fought along with the Neo Cons and \nthe Neo Decepticons as well.\n\n&quot;This is Shockwave, we have done sufficient damage here, to continue would be \na meaningless waste of resources.  Change your courses to the Ramora and \nincrease your velocities.&quot;\n\n\n\nSeveral shots dug into Unitron&#39;s frame, damaging it even worse.  This woke \nhim up in time to hear Shockwave&#39;s retreat.  He painfully transformed into \nhis space fighter mode, launching off towards the Ramora, not even stopping \nto take a few pot shots since he was eager to flee.\n\n\n\nFirestarter executed the perfect barrel roll, the fusion blast flying under \nhim, the shock wave of the blast lightly shaking Firestarter.  He launched \noff twenty rapid laser blasts at Forrior, changing his heading for Asia.  \n&quot;Next time you Autobot wanna bes!&quot;\n\n\nTwo laser blasts and weapons fire form a proton cannon flew past the STAG as \nhe performed a few aerial maneuvers, but it left himself open to catch a \ndozen bullets in the underbelly of his mode.  He transformed to his biped \nmode to keep from leaking to much mech-fluid.  He fired off a few optic \nblasts down at Starstomp, heading for Asia as he was ordered.\n\n"}}
