In his robot mode his height was about 9 ft tall. He \nturned into his beast mode. Again useing the power of proto1000 turning \nliquid for a second and turning into the large dragon. About 11 feet high. He \nstood on his hind legs and crouched. Waiting for an answer to his question.He \nthought of something. &quot;Was that shape shifting bot yours? If so I apolagize I \nneeded his power to be able to transform into my diffrent modes. They are \nquite complicated and my systems could not seem to grasp it.&quot; His head turned \nto thr right sharply. &quot;Prime...but something is diffrent. He is no a autobot \nor maximal. Oh now this I gotta see. He bowed his head in pardons and left \nscreeching out the door with tremendous speed. He was on his way. He had \npicked up a little skill wich allowed him to sence when a  bot was getting \nready or was attacking in a certain range. It was knew but very useful. He \nsteered straight ahead.\n\n"}}
