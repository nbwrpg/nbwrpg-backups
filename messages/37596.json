Finally, after three \nhundred\n&gt; years, he has come back to a planet with such organic beauty. He \nmakes\n&gt; sure to record a birds chirping as he passes by a tree, quite \npleased in\n&gt; its pleasant sound, and resolved to study it later. He heads to the \ntop\n&gt; of a hill, and stops, transforming. He points downward. &quot;There, \nthere&#39;s\n&gt; Cliffjumper.&quot; he says extatically, pointing at a convoy of four \nrobots\n&gt; at the bottom.\n\n\n   ::REDHOT::\n\n    The Red Seeker simply gives the Autobot a strange look as he \nabsorbs himself in nature. it brings a sly smile to Redhot&#39;s face. \n(He&#39;s certainly preoccupied) he thinks.\n    Redhot snorts when his companion stops and points at the convoy\nof \nfour robots. He sounds almost exactly like Starscream. He turns to \nBeachcomber, eyes bright with amusement.\n    &quot;I suppose we should meet them.&quot; he says. &quot;You know them, you \nintroduce me. If I approach them first I&#39;ll probably spook them and I \nain&#39;t in the mood to be cannon fodder today.&quot; The red seeker&#39;s\nhumored \ngrin becomes even more so and he looks down the at the convoy. \nPrivately he hopes that the reflection from his wings didn&#39;t give him \naway.\n\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n********************\n\n\n"}}
