But even the resesive genes will come in\n&gt; handy.  See if you put these genes with these ones over here, you can\n&gt; basically enginer the best trates for the bot and animal modes that\n&gt; you want. But as this shows, it&#39;s only one bot&#39;s genes. But if you\n&gt; got other samples from other bots, with a little time, you can\n&gt; enegineer the perfect bot, brains, strength, stamina, looks, all of\n&gt; what ever you want can be made and spliced.  But I have to ask, what\n&gt; is it speficially that your looking for, genentically I mean?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She saw that the genes she was looking at where her own, but gave no\n&gt; hint that she knew that.  She wanted to know why this femme bot\n&gt; wanted her genetics.  Even thought she was an engineer, she always\n&gt; thought that unless the bot was dead, one didn&#39;t go stealing the\n&gt; genetics of that bot without the bot&#39;s permission.  It was not\n&gt; something that one with honor did.  Despite her reprogramming, honor\n&gt; was one program that could never be taken or erased.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hours passed, Lady Hawk arised from her corner. she walked over to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; samples and observed the results. she didn&#39;t know alot about what\n&gt; she was\n&gt; &gt; looking at but she could see the breakdown of chromosomes and all\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; scientific junk. The dominant ones showed atributes that could\n&gt; possibly be\n&gt; &gt; spliced, the others would reject each other and probably cause a\n&gt; breakdown\n&gt; &gt; in the systems. she catalogued the results for future purposes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you haven&#39;t botched my experiment, you&#39;re more\n&gt; useful than\n&gt; &gt; I thought.&quot; She said to her forced observer. She was never one to\n&gt; admit her\n&gt; &gt; mistakes, and putting down Squizzy was one mistake easily made.\n&gt; There was a\n&gt; &gt; good chance that this bot could be just the tool she needed to be\n&gt; &gt; convincing. &quot;Look at the results and tell me what you can\n&gt; understand, I&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; help you with anything you can&#39;t follow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, October 13, 2000 6:33 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: To make a long story short (To late) Part 2\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She nodded to LadyHawk. She turned her back to her and worked on\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; computer, gathering the info.  She wasn&#39;t really happy with this\n&gt; bot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Something about her felt fake. But she couldn&#39;t put her finger on\n&gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her mongoose insticts told her that there was a snake near by. She\n&gt; &gt; &gt; glanced back at LadyHawk and smiled. Then turned back to the\n&gt; computer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; console. She watched as the printer printed up the sheets and she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; folded them up and placed them on the counter for later on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her sweet, innocent, friendly nature would give her the advantage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She only played at being this little helpless bot that was just so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; helpful.  She was still new enough to this group that she\n&gt; couldn&#39;t do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything.  She wondered seince she was no fighter, if she could\n&gt; work\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her way up through the ranks and see just how far she could go.\n&gt; She\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t sure if she wanted to stay with these bots yet or not.  Sh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also wasn&#39;t sure if they were the strongest group around. IF they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were the best, she would stay with them. If not, she would learn\n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she could and then turn over the info to the strongest group. Her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; survival insticts were on full swing.
