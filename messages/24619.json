But when he felt the sand slip from beneath him he knew he didn&#39;t \nstand a chance. Well, his instructors had always told him he relied too much \non his feet:\n\n&quot;Woah!&quot;\n\nRion sprawled out on the ground, He had sand in his feathers and a piece of \nwhat seemed to be a cactus lodged under his right wing. And, as always,Diana \nhad ended up on top, and he was pinned underneath:\n\n&quot;Lemme up!&quot;\n\nHe tried to sound tough, but only succeeded in a kind of pleading whine with \nattitude.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
