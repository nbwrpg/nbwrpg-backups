Cya all tomorrow.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Seeing that no one had any questions, Zardus continues, opening his \n&gt; mouth before recieving Astral&#39;s transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ah, excellent,&quot; he replies, &quot;If you could report to my position, \n&gt; right outside the Iron Fist, there is an attack going on soon, and \n&gt; lots of chance at destruction.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns back to the bots, continuing with his plan.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The platform needs to be destroyed, and there are more than enough \n&gt; bots available here to do that. The Maximals might attack the \n&gt; Predacon base itself, and if they do, and we&#39;re successful at the \n&gt; platform, we will attack after the Maximals retreat.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The hologram zooms out again, showing a view of the eastern \n&gt; hemisphere. &quot;Both the Predacon base and the platform are closer to \n&gt; the Iron Fist. In case the Predacons are allied with the other groups \n&gt; of Preds, and they decide to attack here, there will be more than \n&gt; enough time to get back to base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks around at the bots, &quot;I think its best to attack at the \n&gt; platform, destroy it, and then go on to the Predacon base, if the \n&gt; Maximals arn&#39;t done with it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He pauses, recieving the transmission from Koj&#39;s beacon. He frowns, \n&gt; listening to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It seems that the other Predacons are against us as well, so if they \n&gt; start marching at the Iron Fist, the Alliance attacking forces will \n&gt; have to either intercept them or return to base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks at the bots around him, realizing Deemos&#39; group wasn&#39;t there \n&gt; yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Deemos,&quot; he says, opening a channel to the bot, &quot;Can you and your \n&gt; group report to my position?
