I know that one  of the bots who&#39;re \nwith you is Predacon Prime Minister Hell Beast... &quot;\n\nshe fell in silence, she let at Megatron time to answer and tried to \nget more time\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC-Im not moding, Ive lived on the ship for over a month, and if \nyou will \n&gt; read several back posts you will see I had Tarantulas get the codes \nbefore \n&gt; killfest declared his dominace.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Megatron stared at his chronokeeper. 5 minutes remained. If \nhe failed \n&gt; to contact him, Killfest was going to regret ever staging this \npathetic \n&gt; uprising. In the mean time, he watched his men pacing, guns in \nhand, waiting.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Aracnia turned to see a fimiliar face. Gremlin entered the \nsmall room \n&gt; that Quasar just left. Wiping the tears from her eyes, &quot;What are \nyou doing?&quot;\n&gt;        Gremlin, in response, &quot;Megatron sent me to get you....and to \ntel lyou \n&gt; that Quickstrike is dead. They have him on the bridge. It would be \nsuicide to \n&gt; go in after him now.&quot;\n&gt;        A sudden shock went through her body. Quickstrike couldnt be \n&gt; dead....he just couldnt. If Killfest wanted to play games with her, \nhe was \n&gt; going to lose, big time. &quot;Were going to get him, and I dont care if \ni have to \n&gt; blow half of this ship up to get him!&quot;\n&gt;        &quot;And how do you plan on doing that?&quot; He asked, stupidly.\n&gt;        looking up, she said, &quot;Just leave that to me.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
