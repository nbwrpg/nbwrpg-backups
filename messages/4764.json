I was sent on a scientific mission \nof exploration. To find resourced and other sources of energy. But the ship \nran into an astoroid field and fell apart.  I landed here.  No one else on \nthe ship made it that I know of.  I think I was the only one to escape in \ntime before the ship exploded in space.  It was the rough landing that \njarred my circiuts.&quot;\nShe sighed, &quot;That&#39;s why I changed sides for a little while. My circiuts got \nmessed up.  But I&#39;m glad you fixed my programming.&quot;\nShe smiled and hugged him. She liked being so close to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------Original Message----------\nFrom:   &lt;crow_lord@h...&gt;\nDate: Mon Jun 26, 2000 3:54pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nScorponok looked at Darkmouse.
