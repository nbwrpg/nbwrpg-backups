He&#39;d thought Nemesis was insane for making him \nand his team their bodyguards.\n\nMortar raised his grenade launcher, firing off two grenades that would \nexplode on impact at Choastaur, taking a position near Pyro and Nemesis.\n\nHiss raised his fusion cannon, a single enormous blast of destructive energy \nlaunching itself at Chaostaur&#39;s left shoulder joint.\n\nScavenger stood to the side, opening a commlink to the bridge with Punch.  \n&quot;This is Scavenger, --&quot;\n\n---\n\n&quot;Yes, yes I know.  That bot took potshots at Nemesis.  I AM in the bridge.&quot; \nPunch sighed, activating internal defenses and getting a lock on Chaostaur.  \nHe activated the speakers throughout the ship.  &quot;This is Punch, unit \nChaostaur has attempted to kill our leader Nemesis Enforcer.  No doubt \nwhoever brings him down first will receive something great from our leader.&quot;\n\nPunch sat back in his chair, watching the battle in the hall continue from \nthe comforts of the bridge.  He pressed a button, the entire Iron Fist \nlocking down, all exits sealing shut magnetically and locking.\n\n"}}
