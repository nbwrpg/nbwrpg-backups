This whole Seconed in Command thing is very unacceptable.\n&gt; Quickstrike is my 2nd because Brightblade posts wonderfully, but not very\n&gt; often. Atma can do something else for me though. As for the battle right\nnow,\n&gt; I have some major work to do first and then i will post.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
