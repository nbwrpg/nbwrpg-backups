He then disingaged,\nin a complex transformation, and flash of light, his legs turned into\nSpeedbreaker and Wildrider, who started to float again, and Wildrider had\nan ugly smile, with half of his face missing, yet he was grinning with\nglee. The middle section becomes Motormaster, and he grabs Firearm, on\nhovers to land on top of Astroblast, and puts his cyclone gun to the robots\nhead. Meanwhile Dead-End and Drag Strip transform, Drag Strip starts to\nsoar, but the charred out body of Dead-End starts to plummet, motionless,\nstraight into Speedbreakers grip, who holds him firmly in mid air. (Okay\nrAuq, theyre yours again). &quot;Seriously Maximal, we have enough equipment in\nAstroblast to patch him up to survive the trip. And I am not bluffing, if\nwe cant take him back to base, then he dies, as well as the other, do you\nreally want to be held responsible for two Maximals deaths, hah, that&#39;s not\nvery Maximal of you. And I dont bluff&quot; screamed Motormaster with fury in\nhis eyes, he had had enough, and except for minor damage to his back and\nneck, and a hole in his front, he was fine, and more than capable of firing\nquickly.\n\n\n\n"}}
