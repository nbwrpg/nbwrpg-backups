She figured she \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt; dig with her sword, as her fireballs were simply inappropriate \nfor \n&gt; &gt; the rock, but then an idea hit her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She concentrated and slowly, the slope she was on became darker \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; darker, filled at first with shadow, but then with deep ink-like \n&gt; &gt; darkness. She could see nothing, but thought she knew what was \n&gt; going \n&gt; &gt; on. Even the sound could not escape.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When she let go, exhausted, she marvelled at what she had done.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A small opening in the rocky soil, one that tunnelled some feet \n&gt; deep \n&gt; &gt; in the ground, was now before her. All she had to do was to blow \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; up to get more space.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She sent the fireball and was soon propelled backward as the \n&gt; &gt; explosion blew the rocks and dust up in the air. She smiled.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dreadplague: Good! (She turned to her pred colleagues) Hey, \nPreds, \n&gt; &gt; how are you doing?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
