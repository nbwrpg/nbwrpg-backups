I&#39;m betting the only thing can heal him now is his \nown repair system, and it hasn&#39;t activated so there&#39;s probably something \nwrong with it. And we now have...maybe 6 min to see just what&#39;s wrong and \nact on it.&quot;\n\n* They reached the CR room doors and the doors slid open, IR spotting the \nrepair station and heading off in that direction. She looked back to see if \nTavatron was following, because she knew that they could really use her help \nwith helping Dinobot.\nBut then she turned her head back towards the station as she came up to it, \nlooking over at Prowl, wondering if he was ready to strain his muscles...as \nwell as hers, to get this bot up on the table and laying on his back.\nThere was a lot to do to get Dinobot as right as ever again, but it would be \na lot in a short amount of time. And there was no room for error.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
