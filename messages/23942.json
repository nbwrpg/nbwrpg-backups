Every loyal \nPredacon would be anticipating it. \n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to help the others,&quot; she said to who ever was left in the \ncave and turned to the door. She pulled it open with effort and \nclosed it behind. He looked out and charged off after Tankor&#39;s \ntracks. \n\nShe was a fast bot with her slim frame, long legs, and light-weight. \nShe kept herself in motion until she got to the battle zone. Battle. \nWhat Predacons were made for.\n\nShe stopped, shin high in the snow, the awful stuff. Many bots were \ncaught in battle. \n\nInstincts turned on. She withdrew a large plasma rifle from behind \nher armor. She had examined her weapons earlier. She looked over, \nspotting a bot that wasn&#39;t from her team. She raised it, aiming at \nDollen.\n\nShe fired. The blast was so strong, it knocked her off her feet with \na short squeal, on her back.\n\n\n"}}
