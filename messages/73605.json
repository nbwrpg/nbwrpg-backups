He keeps his word as pa=\r\nrental instincts kick in.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Local artist who speciali=\r\nzes in illustration, using traditional and digital media. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; I also specialize in hand made crafts.
