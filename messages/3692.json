It opens \nand a large bird emerges from it and takes flight.  She flies around \nsurveing the landscape.  The sunlight shown throught her light gray wings.  \nShe loved to fly and forget the pain of her voyage.  She looked around for \nanother pod that may have dropped to the planet.\n  But she found none. She was worried.  Her brother&#39;s stasis pod had not \nfallen to the ground.  He was either still in orbit or the pod was \nobliterated.  She shook her head to clear her mind of these thoughts.  He&#39;s \nalive, she thought, he has to be.\n  She then turned her thoughts to her surroundings.  The skies were blue and \nthe air had the slight smell of lazar blast and burnt metal.  She heard some \nnoices coming from a clearing just over a mountain ridge.  She flew over to \nsee three groups of bots fighting over a ship.  She swooped down for a \ncloser look.  She perched on a branch over the battle field.  She watched \nthe fighting.  She focused her optics and used her high-power telescopic \nvision to see which bots were which.\n   She saw that some bots had on the Maximal symbol and some had the \nPredacon symbol.  She watched and studied the battle.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
