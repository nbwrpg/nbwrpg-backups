Getting ready to \nfire and hopefully finish her off, several blasts sent him slamming into a \ntree.  Quickly assessing the situation, he fired an ion disk at Triceradon, \nthough a few of the Maximal&#39;s shots sent him to the ground.\n\n---\n\nCounter Punch got behind a boulder, Triceradon&#39;s shots chipping at it.  \nGetting up, he had his missile launcher in one arm, a photon rifle in the \nother.  Firing two shots off at Triceradon from the rifle, and a rocket at \nStegotron, he let out an almost silent cry as the combined kick backs hurdled \nhim to the ground backwards.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch leapt over a log, slamming to the ground feet first.  Raising a \npincher, he launched Beeline, his cyber-bee to take up the fight as he slowly \nadvanced.  Taking flight, the cyber-bee scanned the area of Manterror&#39;s \ncoordinates.  Activating its laser weapons in its optic sensors, it acquired \na target.  It dived, firing a single optic blast at Striker.\n\n"}}
