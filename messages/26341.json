It was time to collect a little peace of her own.\nShe simply smiled down at him and continued on her way, hearing Prowl ask \nher opinion on whatever idea Eypon and himself were having. She had cought \nsmall snatches of it but there were other things to do right now then start \nsomething else that would complicate matters at the moment.\nShe would hear what they had to say, just not right now.*\n\n&quot; Tell me later.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor looked over her shoulder towards the remainder of the Maximals \nwhich were behind her, motioning with her chin for them to follow. It was \ntime for repairs.\nShe opened a comm to Hysteria.*\n\n&quot; How&#39;s the lockdown going?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
