Unless it is said otherwise by the Council itself.  \n\n\nYou have to earn to get on the Council.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you were \noriginally in the RPG when BioStinger started it, or how long you&#39;ve been in \nthe RPG.  None of that matters.  The Council kind of has to want you in.  I&#39;m \njust going on what happened with me.  If you ARE interested in the Council, \ntalk to a Council member.  Zardus, JP3884, Inferno731, or myself, KSLawDogg.  \nWe all have AOL or CS (I&#39;m the only one with CS), so you can IM us if you \nneed too.  Or e-mail.  Saying you would like on.  But asking just isn&#39;t gonna \nget you on, you have to earn it. \n\nFor example, roleplaying good helps.  You can&#39;t be a really bad moder and \nwant on the Council.  It will never happen.  Being...nice...and courteous to \nother roleplayers.  Not calling them &quot;bad names&quot; if they shoot your guy and \nit ruins your plans of attacking someone else, or if your stasis pod lands \nand a Predacon reprograms you when you didn&#39;t want to be a Predacon.\n\nBut, unless it is said otherwise, please, stop sending seperate e-mails or \nincluding in your posts stuff saying you want Crow Lord on the Council.  \nYou&#39;re not on the Council, and for now at least the Council is voting.\n\nAlso, not official votes have been called for Iron Raptor to become leader \ninstead of Liono Prime yet.  So please, stop with that.  Sorry if I confused \nyou with my Anti-Liono Propaganda.  But we aren&#39;t voting.  Not yet at least \nthat I know of)\n\n\n\nLord Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...     \n\n"}}
