Necromancer wondered if Iron Raptor was still the leader, and \nwhat changes had gone by.  It seemed like much time had passed, but \nif he knew how much time had really passed, he wouldn&#39;t be in so much \nwonder.  He decided to send a message to Iron Raptor through his comm-\nlink.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Iron Raptor, this is Necromancer, I&#39;ve returned, and Hell \nDrak is with me,&quot; Necromancer said.\n\n\n"}}
