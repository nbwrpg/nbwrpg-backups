Veratis&#39; anti-weapons policy made it impossible to get \nweapons.\n&gt; He was a warrior not a diplomat.

He \nthought\n&gt; back to the incedent at the CF involving Megaton. The dragon had \nsaid\n&gt; something about representing these Predacons. If he were working \nhere then\n&gt; the Preds would already have all the information they needed so \nobviously he\n&gt; wasn&#39;t here at the moment. &quot;I understand you have had contact with \na mutant\n&gt; named Megaton, I could offer you information about him you probably \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; have on record.&quot;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;airly2000@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 5:06 PM\n&gt; Subject: Shivah has a lot work/Panzer\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: How and when Foxfingers left came in the base?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shivah/Luzbel/Attilla:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shivah typed some buttons and Panzer&#39;s reprogramation processs \nbegun.\n&gt; &gt; After that he opened his com link and said to Lunarpine &quot;That \nsort of\n&gt; &gt; mistakes are mortal, Lunarpine, and your friend should learn to \nlet\n&gt; &gt; the dragon alone in his shire; this is the trade to give you back\n&gt; &gt; your friends and Silverscout.
