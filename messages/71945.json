He could see it wasn&#39;=\r\nt going to pan out with him after all.  Instead of getting angry although a=\r\ngitation is in his voice, Tucson turns to Leo Prime and to Wheelie.\n&quot; This =\r\ndoesn&#39;t seem to be working well is it?  Sorry Wheelie but if you can not wo=\r\nrk properly with command, I have no choice but to transfer you out of my sa=\r\nnction.  I&#39;ve tried hard to avoid that but your insolence only goes so far =\r\nwith me.  I&#39;m sure another sanction will take you in willingly, you have at=\r\ntributes they can use.  Leo, I trust you know someone who can use Wheelie, =\r\nplease see to the transfer if you could.&quot;\nHe turns to Talon.\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry you=\r\n had to see this Talon.  I did try to keep my patience with him.&quot;\nStraight =\r\nShot speaks up.  She looks at Wheelie completely upset.\n&quot; Thanks a lot Whee=\r\nlie!  My brother was trying really hard to reach out to you and you go biti=\r\nng his hand off like a complete slag ball!  Thanks to you he&#39;s on thin ice =\r\nwith the Autobot Council!  Now this!?  HOW COULD YOU?!  I HAVE A GOOD MIND =\r\nTA CARPET YOUR CHASSE WITH EVERY QUILL ON MY BODY!&quot; \nShe darts out with tea=\r\nrs in her eyes.  Rattrap tries to follow.

Slag I knew that =\r\nlittle bugger was trouble the moment he got here.&quot;\nStraight Shot tries to c=\r\nompose herself.\n&quot; Yeah you called that one right.  And because of him, Tucs=\r\non could lose his status.  He&#39;s making my brother look like a fool and wors=\r\nt off is,  Leo isn&#39;t doing anything about it.  Oh sure, ten ta one he&#39;s fav=\r\noring Wheelie, I see it, I&#39;m not stupid.  Ooohhh!  This whole thing makes m=\r\ne so mad I wanna jab every quill on my body into that little orange pest!&quot;\n=\r\nNightshift shifts into robot mode and sits down with Straight Shot as does =\r\nRattrap , who puts a consoling arm around her.\n&quot; Hey, I know things don&#39;t l=\r\nook so cool right now but I didn&#39;t hear your bro lose his temper, and I kno=\r\nw when he does because the whole base would&#39;ve heard him.  That&#39;s why he&#39;s =\r\nbe&#39;n watched and so far so good.  He may have handled himself nicely in the=\r\nre, from what I can tell.  And that&#39;s what the council looks for in a leade=\r\nr. &quot;\nRattrap grins.\n&quot; Good point, never thought of it that way.  Oh Wings a=\r\nctually told Leo ta transfer him outa the Ark and assign him to another tro=\r\nop.&quot;\nNightshift nods.\n&quot; That&#39;s cool, at least he&#39;s still in the faction but=\r\n different sanction.  Not bad.  Not bad at all.  I would&#39;ve done the same t=\r\nhing if I was in his shoes.  Now, Straight Shot, don&#39;t worry, your bro ain&#39;=\r\nt go&#39;n anywhere but where he is now.  Trust me, as long as he keeps his tem=\r\nper in check and makes decisions for the benefit of our troops he&#39;ll be fin=\r\ne.&quot;\nHe carefully puts an arm around his prickly comrade.\nPerpetually on the=\r\n move and constantly busy. \nOn Aug 27, 2011, at 10:50 PM, &quot;adamsafran&quot; &lt;ada=\r\nmsafran@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n\n&gt; An insult=\r\n to his logic was definitely a test to Tucson&#39;s already short temper.

Yep Wheelie is in big trou=\r\nble.&quot;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Tucson eyes Wheelie with arms folded in his chest.  His stare =\r\nindicative of Ratchet when he was ready to lose his temper.\n\n&gt; \n\n\n\nAt this =\r\npoint, Wheelie stood up, &quot;Yes, I say you are wrong.  There&#39;s no such thing =\r\nas a space bridge that strong.  You would simply see it from afar, with our=\r\n own optics the sensors abar.  You cannot remotely hide such a hting, in th=\r\ne technology of our time or even that thing.  To do such a thing, to rip ap=\r\nart time, is stupidly absurd, I call it this time.  So if you are going to =\r\nsay we should waste our time going after what does not exist, I say thee na=\r\ny.&quot;\n\n\n\nWheelie went on, &quot;So, stop wasting oru time for such a stupid thing,=\r\n or I will go out on my own and bring.  Rodimus is my friend, I won&#39;t leave=\r\n him alone to face his end.

So I say, I think y=\r\nou want my friend dead today.&quot;\n\n\n\nAt the Laurel and Hardy back and forth of=\r\n Rattrap and Straight SHot, Wheelie just laughed, &quot;And you bring up Ratchet=\r\n?  Well he&#39;s dead.  MEgatron blew off his head.  And you seem to want Rodim=\r\nus to end the same way.  So I shall now not leave my friend astray.&quot;\n\n\n\nAnd=\r\n without a further word, Wheelie transformed to his vehicle mode, and raced=\r\n off!\n\n\n\nOOC - This is how I see the character - at this point, he thinks i=\r\nt&#39;s utter nonsense to waste time looking for a Space Bridge that there&#39;s no=\r\n evidence of or anything remotely suggesting, based upon Tuscon having a &#39;h=\r\nunch&#39; so he&#39;s going insubordinate and off on his own.  TO him, a Space Brid=\r\nge would e impossible to hdie (a la the third Transformers movie Dark of th=\r\ne Moon), and so wasting time scanning for it is a fool&#39;s errand.  So he&#39;s g=\r\noing off to &#39;look&#39; for Rodimus on his own, unless stopped or otherwis einte=\r\nrfered with as he&#39;s afraid that Tuscon is purposefully stalling to prevent =\r\nthem from going after Rodimus.  He respects Leo Prime, but he&#39;s friends wit=\r\nh Rorimus, and he has a very low regard for Tuscon, and at this point in hi=\r\ns processor Tuscon deciding to check for something to him that has infinite=\r\nsimal chances of having been done and stall a gridwide search is abaondment=\r\n of his friend.

You seem to be quite intelli=\r\ngent, go on, tell me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap and Straight Shot look to=\r\n Wheelie in shock.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Looks like a certain little go cart=\r\n&#39;s in for some serious discipline. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot swall=\r\nows hard.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; His voice, it sounds just like Ratchet&#39;s voi=\r\nce when he was ready ta lose it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap watches with a=\r\nmusement.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ooohhh so that&#39;s where Tucson&#39;s temper comes=\r\n from.  Yep Wheelie is in big trouble.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson eyes Whee=\r\nlie with arms folded in his chest.  His stare indicative of Ratchet when he=\r\n was ready to lose his temper.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt this point, Wheelie st=\r\nood up, &quot;Yes, I say you are wrong.  There&#39;s no such thing as a space bridge=\r\n that strong.  You would simply see it from afar, with our own optics the s=\r\nensors abar.  You cannot remotely hide such a hting, in the technology of o=\r\nur time or even that thing.  To do such a thing, to rip apart time, is stup=\r\nidly absurd, I call it this time.  So if you are going to say we should was=\r\nte our time going after what does not exist, I say thee nay.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhee=\r\nlie went on, &quot;So, stop wasting oru time for such a stupid thing, or I will =\r\ngo out on my own and bring.  Rodimus is my friend, I won&#39;t leave him alone =\r\nto face his end.  If you are goin to be a boron, then I shall call you a ni=\r\nmrod and boron.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHissing, &quot;Now, I would say you are wasting our ti=\r\nme, on pointless things that we needn&#39;t to whine.  So I say, I think you wa=\r\nnt my friend dead today.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt the Laurel and Hardy back and forth o=\r\nf Rattrap and Straight SHot, Wheelie just laughed, &quot;And you bring up Ratche=\r\nt?  Well he&#39;s dead.  MEgatron blew off his head.  And you seem to want Rodi=\r\nmus to end the same way.  So I shall now not leave my friend astray.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nAnd without a further word, Wheelie transformed to his vehicle mode, an=\r\nd raced off!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOOC - This is how I see the character - at this point=\r\n, he thinks it&#39;s utter nonsense to waste time looking for a Space Bridge th=\r\nat there&#39;s no evidence of or anything remotely suggesting, based upon Tusco=\r\nn having a &#39;hunch&#39; so he&#39;s going insubordinate and off on his own.  TO him,=\r\n a Space Bridge would e impossible to hdie (a la the third Transformers mov=\r\nie Dark of the Moon), and so wasting time scanning for it is a fool&#39;s erran=\r\nd.  So he&#39;s going off to &#39;look&#39; for Rodimus on his own, unless stopped or o=\r\ntherwis einterfered with as he&#39;s afraid that Tuscon is purposefully stallin=\r\ng to prevent them from going after Rodimus.  He respects Leo Prime, but he&#39;=\r\ns friends with Rorimus, and he has a very low regard for Tuscon, and at thi=\r\ns point in his processor Tuscon deciding to check for something to him that=\r\n has infinitesimal chances of having been done and stall a gridwide search =\r\nis abaondment of his friend.  Anyways, wondrful posting and good luck!&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n   =\r\n \n    \n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: white; clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \t\t \t=\r\n   \t\t  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--_bfed81f5-c77b-4734-89ce-0ffbe0ce826c_--\r\n\n"}}
