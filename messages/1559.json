Im a Senator...they wont hurt me.\n\n::: Jackle ::: And what about me?!\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Consider yourself a myrter for the Predacon cause. Now get \ngoing!\n\n::: Reluctantly they both head for this ship and wait outside the main \nentryway. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~`\n\n::: Set nods to Shuko&#39;s orders. Obviously he had been in these kind of \nsituations before, where as Set had always been leading attacks from behinde \na desk from across the galaxy. That didnt make him a coward, not in his eyes. \nThere were many forms of courage. :::\n\n::: He opened the ramp, and Hell Beast entered, followed by his minion :::\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: At a small table, in the conference room, Set sat with Hell Beast and his \nlittle minion who seemed to be nervous. The light was dim because power was \nbeing re-routed to more important systems. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast began, his large hands folded over his chain gun that rested \non the table ::: Explain to me why you are here, now.\n\n::: Set swallowed his pride..and fear. He knew Senator Hell Beast was an \nimportant figure, so important that his place was still reserved in the \nSenate. Set remembered that Hell Beast was mixed into organized crime and \nreciving bribes too. ::: We have come here to open a mining operation. We \nsaid we were arresting you to throw off the Maximals. I can assure you, you \nhave nothing to worry about.\n\n\n"}}
