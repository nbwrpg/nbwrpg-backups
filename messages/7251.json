There was nothing that she could do nothing at all but look away and pretend not to hear the screams that came. Her optics closed and her jaw clenched as she then looked up to see Pyro lift Tavatron to a table, her spark jumping in fear. *\n\n� Tavatron! Don�t scream, don�t let then have the satisfaction of hearing you scream.�\n\n* Her voice was normal and sounded calm, but she was anything but calm. She wanted to yell and struggle, wanted to break free and run with Tavatron with her. But she couldn�t. There was no place to run.\nIn this time she wished more then ever that Prowl would come, come and take her away from all this terror.\nBut now she knew why Maximals never had torture chambers, they would never put a bot through what they were about to put Tavatron through. No bot deserved to be tortured like this, not like this! *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
