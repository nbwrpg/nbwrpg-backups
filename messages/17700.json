He turned to \nWaspinator, &quot;You, go to Kitkats position and beg for he to spare a body part \nof mine to you, as a momento. Tell her that I am truly dead, but under any \ncircumstances do not tell them that we are residing in the ice cavern.&quot;\nHe said.\n    Waspinator nodded. &quot;Yes Megatron. But what if they hurt me?&quot; He said a \nlittle uneasy.\n    &quot;Thats your problem. Just throw them off my trail!&quot; He roared and sent \nthe little bot buzzing away frantically into the air.\n    Adrax began to clap and got the tyrants attention. &quot;What a perfect prison \nyou have selected. If you leave, you&#39;ll die. And now your confined insdie. \nYou are pathetic Megatron.&quot;\n    Without a word, Megatron dropped his cage into the pit, but stopped it. \nIt dangled in blackness. Megatron then sealed the top of it. He could stay \ndown there awhile.\n\n    Hell Beast and Gremlin emerged from the woods. Word had it that Megatron \nwas dead, and if he was then he could go home. Gremlin pointed as they \nentered the clearing to the old cave, &quot;There they are. Kitkat is in charge.&quot;\n    The old Commander looked at the leader. She was small, another female. \nFemales seemed to be weak leaders, but mabey this one was different. \n&quot;Commander Kitkat, I am Senator Hell Beast. I belive my reputation proceeds \nme, but in any case I have come to investigate the death of the criminal \nMegatron. I mean no trouble and will help you if nessecery.&quot;\n\n    Black Aracnia looked to Quickstrike, &quot;So what do you think about the \nbaby....I mean...are you alright with it? Scared?&quot;\n\n"}}
