The robotic equivelincy to Homer Simpsons &quot;DOH&quot; came out as he \nslapped himself in the forehead. &quot;I&#39;ll remember that trick .&quot; He \nthought back as he began down the hall again. He still wasn&#39;t sure \nabout the extent of her powers but he still wanted his thoughts to be \nkept secret. If Veratis knew that he&#39;d broken into the maximal \nweapons locker then into a Predacon base he wouldn&#39;t be a happy \nscientist.\n\nIn the lab Veratis tried duplicating the steps that he&#39;d taken but \nfor some reason the bot who&#39;d just recieved Dinobots DNA seemed more \nagressive towards accepting it. Veratis figured it was just the \ndifference betwee Ice and this bot until he realized that he&#39;d \nforgotten to check the chip. Sure enough He was dealing with a \nPredacon Protoform this time. He tried to delay so he could program \nit but it was to late. The chip had taken effect and the Predacon was \non his way to being born.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She smiled at FoxFinger. &quot;Pleased to meet you.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help \nbut \n&gt; chuckle quietly at his thoughts.

Besides, I wasn&#39;t going to leave \nyou. \n&gt; Not after all that you had done for me.&quot; She smiled at him and \nwalked \n&gt; over.
