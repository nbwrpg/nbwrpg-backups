As the door opens, a haggard, \ntired, and old \n&gt; warrior steps out of the craft. It was Thrust, legendary Vehicon, \nand really \n&gt; cranky biker. Megatron had made a backup data file of the spark of \n&gt; Waspinator, and made Thrust in the battle for the sparks. Now, the \ndata had \n&gt; attached itself to a spark void of life, and had recreated the \nbiker we all \n&gt; know and hate. &quot;Hello? Is anyone alive on this planet? Anyone? Come \nin! I am \n&gt; Thrust,  vehicon general.&quot; He spoke into a comlink, and prayed for \nan answer. \n&gt; You see, the Maximals had kicked him off Cybertron when they \ndiscovered his \n&gt; precence in &quot;THE BIG GIANT MEGATRON HEAD&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On a totally different plain, another pod crashes. A reinforcement, \ntrained \n&gt; in the martial arts on earth in the great war steps out. He is a \nMaximal. He \n&gt; breathes in the air, and sighs. He pulls up a data file, and can \nfind no \n&gt; surviving crew members from team DINOBOT (his old guerilla force) \non the \n&gt; planet. He called into a comlink, on a Maximal \nfrequency. &quot;SlashStrike here. \n&gt; Looking for Maximal base. My cohorts on Kaytry moon have alerted me \nof the \n&gt; war, and I think I am here to kick some tail. Reply with \ncoordinates to your \n&gt; base, if any.
