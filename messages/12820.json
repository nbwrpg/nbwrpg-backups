When he opened his eyes, he saw \nthat Fliq had gotten out of the chamber.\n\n&quot;Hey, you made it!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah. Don&#39;t worry about what you did. It&#39;s okay.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thanks. I was really worried. But today we have a mission. We have \nto go to the Cybertronian Fire and get a space shuttle. That&#39;s what \nwere going to use to go get the parts of the ship. If you could start \nworking on this CR Chamber, I have to go find Spears.&quot;\n\nBrix walks around the Ark for a few minutes until he found Spears.\n\n&quot;Spears, hey. Fliq and I are going to get the shuttle now. If you \ncould do an appraisal on the Ark and make a list of what you need, we \nmight be able to leave tomorrow. And better tell Striker to get \ntroops. We don&#39;t know if their will be another attack.&quot;\n\nBrix heads back to Fliq.\n\n&quot;So how you doin?&quot;\n\n&quot;Got it up 3% power. I&#39;ll work more when we come back.&quot;\n\nFliq and Brix exit the Ark, turn on their jet packs and head for the \nCF.\n\n\n"}}
