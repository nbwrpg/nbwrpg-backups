BrightBlade was\n&gt; still in the CR chamber, and was cloaked. She did, however, make one\n&gt; fatal mistake... I&#39;ll rewrite your post since I have permission to\n&gt; use\n&gt; your chars.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Chordate/Rex/Perndabot::\n&gt;\n&gt; A beep shook Chordate from his sleep, the Maximal jerking his head\n&gt; over to the screen he had been sitting in front of. Something was\n&gt; wrong, the security systems of the ship had picked up a transmission,\n&gt; coming from the brig.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Maximal officer taps a few keys, bringing up the contents and\n&gt; further data on the transmission. It was NOT Maximal, that was for\n&gt; sure. He swears, tracking the transmission to the brig CR chamber.\n&gt; The\n&gt; other reports, however, didn&#39;t report a bot in it...\n&gt;\n&gt; Chordate swears, pressing a few more keys, a cybernetic gas is\n&gt; released into the chamber, meant to put the occupant into stasis.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rex,&quot; he says into his comm-link to the Maximal on brig duty,\n&gt; &quot;There&#39;s a bot sending transmissions from Brig CR 2. There is no\n&gt; signature from it so it must be cloaked. Check it out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;On my way,&quot; Rex&#39;s voice replies, Chordate seeing from the scanners\n&gt; that Rex was moving in the direction of the CR.\n&gt;\n&gt; Chordate nods, begining to talk to himself. &quot;Now... To just find the\n&gt; bot that the transmission was meant for...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He goes to work, tapping more keys.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Perndabot smiles, walking after Feline and Skulletron. From what he\n&gt; could hear of their conversations, they were obvioustly Alliance\n&gt; bots.\n&gt; He opens his mouth to speak, being stopped by BrightBlade&#39;s\n&gt; transmission. Perndabot sighs. He had been looking for the brig, but\n&gt; had now gotten lost.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hey,&quot; he says quietly from behind the two bots, &quot;You Alliance\n&gt; members?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (Yanshosh has the authorization to use Chordate and Smokescreen\n&gt; whenever he\n&gt; &gt; wants due to me having no time to participate with them)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chordate/Smokescreen:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chordate awoke from his post, looking around.  He heard a loud\n&gt; beeping,\n&gt; &gt; pressing a button, it ceased.  Looking over screens of each camera,\n&gt; he saw\n&gt; &gt; one that was flashing a light blue.  That meant to tell him where\n&gt; the trouble\n&gt; &gt; was.  Looking at the screen, he saw the bot that had been captured,\n&gt; or so he\n&gt; &gt; thought, who was now free.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;These idiots.  All you have to do is, is watch them?  Is that to\n&gt; much to\n&gt; &gt; ask?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chordate pressed several commands.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Two autoguns pop down from the cieling, one pointing at\n&gt; BrightBlade&#39;s head,\n&gt; &gt; one at the back of her knees.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chordate activated the intercom for that room.  &quot;Attention\n&gt; Predacon,\n&gt; stay put\n&gt; &gt; and don&#39;t try anything, or I will stop you with deadly repeat.  I\n&gt; repeat\n&gt; &gt; DEADLY force.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He activated the comm. on a secured Maximal frequency.  &quot;This is\n&gt; Chordate,\n&gt; &gt; attention all available Maximals, a once captured intruder is FREE\n&gt; near CR\n&gt; &gt; chamber (instert # here), in sector (insert here).
