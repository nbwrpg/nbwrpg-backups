The only \n&gt; &gt; posts I made that had anything to do with the battle\n&gt; &gt; in the last \n&gt; &gt; couple of days were to clarify the weapon&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; function.  It&#39;s not like \n&gt; &gt; I kept shooting!  Jeez, just because you&#39;re a mod\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t mean you \n&gt; &gt; automatically know everything about a weapon someone\n&gt; &gt; else designed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not here to stand around and look pretty either.\n&gt; &gt;  If anyone needs \n&gt; &gt; an attitude change, it&#39;s the people who expect the\n&gt; &gt; new guy to not \n&gt; &gt; know shit about how RPGs work.  I&#39;ve had a ton of\n&gt; &gt; writing and \n&gt; &gt; roleplaying experience, thank you very much, and I\n&gt; &gt; know what I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; doing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You ought to be a little more prepared for those who\n&gt; &gt; show up with a \n&gt; &gt; slew of ideas ready beforehand.  I&#39;m not saying all\n&gt; &gt; my ideas should \n&gt; &gt; go through, I&#39;m saying I have them ready for when\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s an opening.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Sign up for SBC Yahoo!
