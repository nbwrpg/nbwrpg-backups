I&#39;m glad your feeling better Yan^_^\n&gt; Oh, and Ks, just to make sure you know, the bridge is still under\nlockdown.\n&gt; Absolutely no computers or access panels are visible or accessible[sp].\n&gt; Sorry this is so long, but it&#39;s either type this or do homework...)\n&gt;\n&gt; Hysteria/Tavatron\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron sent a sickle shaped wave of energy at Manterror. Iron Raptor\ncould\n&gt; take care of herself, as she had already proven. Kluster, however, seemed\nin\n&gt; need of assistance.\n&gt;\n&gt; *****\n&gt;\n&gt; Hysteria:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hysteria cringed slightly as she slowly pulled herself into a sitting\n&gt; position. Her armor was charred, and her gears groaned and sparked\neverytime\n&gt; she moved. Right now, however, her condition was of little importance. The\n&gt; Alliance &#39;bots were slowly nearing the bridge. It was under lockdown, but\n&gt; she had no knowledge of their weaponry or technical abilities. The\n&gt; flamethrowers that had been firing at Unitron and Firestarter had\nexploded.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hysteria&#39;s laptop was in small pieces scattered throughout the ventilation\n&gt; shaft. Her interface cord, however, was still operational. She plugged it\nin\n&gt; to the nearest access panel and checked the status of the CF. The shields\n&gt; were at 45% and something was happening to the doors. Further inspection\n&gt; revealed a weakening of their molecular level. She didn&#39;t know whether to\n&gt; blast it or just leave them alone for the time being.\n&gt;\n&gt; She chose to ignore them and worry about more pressing matters, such as\n&gt; Firestarter and Unitron. Firestarter&#39;s missiles dented the thick door\n&gt; barring his entrence, and left a large black mark where they struck.\n&gt; Hysteria&#39;s scanners indicated that in the Brig four &#39;bots were attempting\n&gt; escape. She charged the undamaged autoguns on the far wall and fired\n&gt; multiple rounds at Demolition and anyone else who happened to be out of\n&gt; their cell:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This isn&#39;t going to work!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The shields were already fluctuating and more weapon&#39;s fire was heading\n&gt; their way. After the final missile struck the shield read 20% and failing.\n&gt; One more blast like the last one and the shields would be nonexistant,\n&gt; again.\n&gt;\n&gt; CF Comp: *Alert! Weapon&#39;s fire detected within proximity of unit Hysteria*\n&gt;\n&gt; Hysteria quickly fired a blast from her left wrist cannon at the oncoming\n&gt; missile. The resounding blast shook the vent and sent Hysteria tumbling\ndown\n&gt; an access shaft. She landed hard in another part of the ship after falling\n&gt; about 100 nearly vertical feet, taking a few involuntary turns, and nearly\n&gt; crashing in to the vent walls:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;*groan* Where the slag am I?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; A pulsating sound to her right was all she needed to hear to know she was\nin\n&gt; the CF&#39;s engine room. Hysteria looked up at the massive propulsion system\nof\n&gt; the mighty ship. Maybe, just maybe...\n&gt;\n&gt; Hysteria jumped to her feet, ignoring the pain that shot through her body.\n&gt; She limped/ran to the large console beside the engine. Since it was\nlocated\n&gt; in the heart of the ship the engine room was virtually undamaged. If she\n&gt; could reroute the power from the propulsion system it would be enough to\n&gt; power the shields and the EMP cannon! But it would also destroy any chance\n&gt; they had of getting off the planet. She couldn&#39;t contact Kluster because\nof\n&gt; damage sustained by her comm. She had no choice. Hysteria typed in several\n&gt; passwords, her fingers flying across the console as she feverishly worked\nto\n&gt; save what little remained of the CF.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
