Sorry to have \nbothered you with all this Stegotron.&quot;\n\nShe turned and looked at Lunarpine. &quot;OK, I&#39;ll take your word for it. You can \nsee, your fine then. But just answer me this then, How many fingers am I \nholding up?&quot;  She held up four fingers and held her hand in front of \nLunarpine.\n\n\n---Original Message---\n&gt;From: &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@...&gt;\n\n\n&gt;&quot;Maybe you should have your hearing circuits checked, four words Wing, MY\n&gt;EYES ARE FINE. End of subject.&quot; He wasn&#39;t furious at her for trying to \n&gt;help,\n&gt;he was upset that she did it behind his back.. He could do the job, if \n&gt;she&#39;d\n&gt;let him. Instead she&#39;s trying to get him fixxed (OOPS I Meant Repaired)\n&gt;without him wanting to be.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
