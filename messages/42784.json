He ran and hovered as fast as he could towards the \ndeparting ship and joined Grimlock. He still fired his warning shots, \nhoping they would at least heed his warnings. He eagerly anticipated \nthe help of his technobot companions.\n    &quot;I hope they cna do something to help: he thought as he weakly \nhovered along.\n\n*****************************************\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Dominjoe landed near the Constructicons and Soundwave, as they all\n&gt; looked around. The cockpit opened, and Megatron flew out of it,\n&gt; transforming into his large robot mode. He looked to his old troops, \nand\n&gt; began to speak informally.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Greetings Decepticons, It is time to rejoin the cause you gave your\n&gt; life to Millions of years ago, that, or be oblitorated.&quot; he said, \nfiring\n&gt; his fusion cannon into the air to add an exclamation point to his\n&gt; phrase.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bonecrusher looked in awe. &quot;It can&#39;t be, Megatron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rumble and Frenzy walked forward away from Proto 1000. &quot;Yeah, we saw \nyou\n&gt; die.&quot; They said in unison.\n&gt; \n&gt; Soundwave looked at both of them, no emotion showing on his face. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Megatron obviously exists.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n::Domnijoe and Blindchaos and Long Haul::\n\n    Domnijoe&#39;s landing wasn&#39;t that graceful concidering the extra \nweight she was carrying, but she let out her occupents and stood back \nto watch Megatron his head. As Blindchaos has said to her via private \nradio signal, he had a mighty fine head.\n    &#39;I don&#39;t know what he finds so facination about Megatron&quot; she \nmumbled to herself. &quot;Besides him being a fine commander.&quot; She stuck \nher tongue out and stared at the constructicons, Soundwave and his \ncassettes. \n    Blindchaos wagged his dinosaur tail eagerly, his ever present grin \nstill characteristic in his dinosaur form.\n    &quot;Yep. Meggy&#39;s here.&quot; he said boldly. &quot;He&#39;s alive and ticking and \nsquashing people who pester him.&quot; The ankylosaur giggled. &quot;I like his \nstyle!!&quot;\n    Long Haul rolled his eyes at this display. Although he was pleased \nto see his former leader still functioned, his followers were a bit \nof...an annoyance. He turned to Soundwave.\n    &quot;How can he stand that moron?&quot; he said, grimmacing.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n*******************************************************\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n::\n&gt; Decepticon Ship\n&gt; \n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Come on, hurry up Abominus.&quot; Astrotrains voice complained, showing \nthe\n&gt; weariness in him. Then out of nowhere the island began to shake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile deep under the water, Abominus plunged his second hand \ndeep\n&gt; within the core of the Islands anchor to the earth, as he placed his \nbig\n&gt; hands around the ship, then he began to pull, his eyes showing no \nsign\n&gt; of intelligence, as he placed his foot on the island core for \nleverage.\n&gt; \n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n::\n&gt; Grimlock&#39;s rescue attempt\n&gt; \n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n::\n&gt; \n&gt; Grimlock arced towards the giant threatening robot. &quot;Wrong, you \nrelease\n&gt; Autobots, and Grimlock not smash you.&quot; he yelled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind the ship, Firedrill finally arrived, and transformed, and \nbegan\n&gt; banging his fists agains it&#39;s armored sides. &quot;Let Clif\n\n\n"}}
