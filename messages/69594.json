I would join myself with the spark of Galvatron so that he may live again, so that the empire of the decepticons may live again, grow and thrive as it once did.&quot;\n\nCyclonus looked fully again at Hydras, &quot;I have come to see if that is still possible from within you, I have come looking for hope.&quot;\n\nOOC: airly, please look at messages #69260 - #69273 under the thread &quot;A spark of hope&quot; to see at least some of the older conversation between Cyclonus and Hydras \n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
