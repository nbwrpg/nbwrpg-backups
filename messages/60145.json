She was impressed by his sheer \nstrength, but kept working. She put the finishing touches on the \nmachine and sighed. &quot;It&#39;s done. Now, once we get this inside the your \nbig ball there, how are we going to get it outside the planet&#39;s \natmosphere without the whole thing melting, buring up, or just \nreturning to earth?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; While Wolfblade made the final adjustments to the generator, Malice \nwas about to &#39;adjust&#39; the sphere.  They needed the generator inside \nthe basalt sphere, so the easiest way would be to cut it open and \ninstall.  Malice drew his sword.  It looked like a hammered out \nbackbone.  It was more of a saw than a sword.  It also had cables \nrunning the length from the tip to the hilt.  When the bottom half of \nthe handle was unscrewed and slid inside the other half, it created a \nwhip like saw weapon.  Malice could also channel energy into it, \nmaking it more or less leathal.  In this application, Malice poured \nso of his stored energy into it, making it like a torch.  He plunged \nthe blade into the sphere and in a circular motioin, cut a cross \nsection wide enough to slide the generator inside.  He pulled the \nsection out and drew out the heat so he could set it down.  All that \nwas left was installing the generator and figure out where they were \ngoing to launch it.\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:WOlfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She was glad to be back in the lab. Malice was obviously \n&gt; uncomfortable around her as his body language showed very well. Her \n&gt; systems were re-setting themselves, but it seemed to taking an \n&gt; eternity for her.  She glanced up at Malice and felt her belly turn \n&gt; upside down.  She picked up a small set of tools and started to \n&gt; finish the small touches on thier project. &quot;Uh, by the way, erhm, \n&gt; well, thanks for your help. Back there....I mean.&quot;  She tried to \nhide \n&gt; her face behind the large sphere on the work bench. She wasn&#39;t sure \n&gt; why some of her circuits were acting as funny as they were. Or wny \n&gt; some of her lanugage skills went haywire a little while ago. She \ntold \n&gt; herself she would put herself in a CR chamber when this was done \nand \n&gt; run a complete diognostic on herself. However, she had to admit, \neven \n&gt; to herself, she thought she was feeling something when she thought, \n&gt; saw or looked at Malice. She looked and found herself staring at \nthe \n&gt; sphere as she had gotten lost in thought, She shook her head and \n&gt; returned to work. &quot;Hope this works.
