Punch out.&quot; the double agent said as \nhe deactivated the comlink with Zardus.  He walked out of the bridge, \npondering if it would be safe to continue being a double agent.  No doubt his \nlong absence would start up suspicions in the Predacons.  Slag, he didn&#39;t \neven know who was in control of the Predacons anymore!\n\n===\n\nManterror, Injector, and Bumblebee walked up to the shuttles.\n\nInjector cupped his mouth and yelled, &quot;HEY!  WE WANNA JOIN THE ALLIANCE!&quot;\n\n---\n\nA few seconds later, the four Oblitercons in one of the shuttles ran out of \ntheir shuttle, weapons trained on the three visible Predacons, none of the \nOblitercons seeing Double Punch.\n\n&quot;You think we just accept everyone who comes along to join the Alliance?&quot; \nBreakdown asked.\n\n&quot;No.&quot; Manterror replied.  &quot;But I think you&#39;ll want to let us join.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why?&quot;\n\n&quot;Or else you&#39;ll die.&quot;\n\n&quot;You can&#39;t kill us!&quot; Pyro yelled, raising his flame cannon to point at \nManterror&#39;s face.\n\n&quot;No, not all of you.  Just him.&quot; he replied as he pointed at Breakdown.\n\nBreakdown heard a voice from behind and turned.\n\nDouble Punch suddenly appeared, a pincher open, two missiles pointed at \nBreakdown&#39;s face.\n\n&quot;Welcome to the Alliance!&quot; Breakdown yelled with a fake smile.\n\n&quot;Glad to be a part of it.&quot; Double Punch said, the other three ex-Predacons \nbursting out with laughter, the eight bots boarding the shuttle.\n\n"}}
