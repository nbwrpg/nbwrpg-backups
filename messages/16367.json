Destructor offered us \nhelp, the alliance offered us help, I think we should move one step \nat a time. We have a five bot group right now, Destructor makes six, \nDollen and GoldenEye will be back soon theres eight add the alliance \nforces and we&#39;ll have a small army working with us, and then, then \nfollowers will join us or fall before us, and Megatron will be our \nfirst victim.&quot; Phobias eyes lit up at the prospect of being the bot \nbehind the bot who joined the forces of Predacon and Alliance, being \nthe unknown shadow that the great leaders throughout history have \ncast. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She thought about the situation.  She didn&#39;t know the bots who were \n&gt; so far, helping htem out.  Usually when one helped, they expected \nthe \n&gt; favor returned, and with more in return than what was offered.  She \n&gt; looked at Phobia,&quot;Tell me, who is this Destrustor?  And why did he \n&gt; help us? No Pred would just help and expect nothing in return. \nAlso, \n&gt; if Megatron is without followers, who does that leave us with? I \n&gt; heard that most of our groups is gone.&quot;  She looked down and \n&gt; sighed. &quot;I know that I can only trust you and Drillbit right now.&quot;\n&gt; She looked up at Phobia.  &quot;I think it would be best if we takled to \n&gt; this Desctuctor. Then we need to get our group together.  I  know \nI&quot;m \n&gt; not the only one who wants to get Megatron for deserting us.  And \n&gt; once Megatron is done with, we can then start looking for a base of \n&gt; our own.  BUt Megatron has to be delt with. As long as he is \naround, \n&gt; we will never have a moment&#39;s rest.  After that,&quot; she suddenly had \nan \n&gt; angry look on her face,&quot;After that, I want to pay back those \nslagging \n&gt; maximals.&quot; She relaxed, &quot;What do you think Phobia?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;re currently at the base of a Predacon named Destrucror, \n&gt; &gt; Starscreem went ahead to the alliance base, Goldeneye and Dollen \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; considering returning to us and Megatron is currently without \n&gt; &gt; followers I suggest we meet the alliance, track him down and take \n&gt; &gt; care of our problems one at a time.&quot; Phobia knew to leave out the \n&gt; &gt; part about Destructors offer so he&#39;d have an ace in the hole if \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; fell through. He didn&#39;t fully trust Destructor yet and KitKats \n&gt; &gt; trusting ways may get in the way of earning that trust.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
