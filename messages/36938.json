He is getting impatient. \nHe directs this thought to Ironhide, the Autobot commander. &lt;&lt;Pacifx \nis right, if we leave the bot in the ship it might do something, and \npossibly ruin the mission. I cannot let that happen. I think I&#39;ll \norder Pacifix to bring out the bot, and I&#39;ll have Sunstreaker place \nthe bot in containment till we can deal with him.&gt;&gt; Azafroth stops \nshimmering, and simply glows. He is getting VERY impatient.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
