If I am supposed to remember you, you&#39;ll have to schedule a \ntime for us to, sit down and chat.  But right now I fear my family \nis in dire straits.  To the point-&quot;\n&gt; The massive and powerful transformer showed a little of his speed \nwhen he closed the gap between them in a mere two seconds.\n&gt; &quot;Tell me were the bounty hunters Malice and Organics are.&quot; he said \nsimply, no longer enjoying this very entertaining conversation.\n&gt; \n&gt; MaximaSR74@a... wrote:\n&gt; Hissing at Perceptor, she tired of him. \n&gt; \n&gt; Taking a step back, but in a swift motion, slashed at him... \nacross his neck down his chest. &quot;I DON&#39;T take too kindly to \ndisrespect, Perceptor,&quot; she growled. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jumping back to avoid any attack he may attempt.. but her optics \nturned to glare up at the Clone. &quot;Just because you have the \nDecepticon Matrix does NOT make you Megatron! Leader.. yes... albeit \na fleeting one,&quot; she purred with malice. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Though... Perceptor speaks the truth in one way,&quot; as her arm \nwaved to the side in a graceful manner. &quot;Hydras is leader here. And \nhe is far better a leader than Starscream.&quot; Grinning up at the \nclone. How she hated Starscream... to the point she would often \ntorture & tease him. Though, she at first was teased.. but that \ndidn&#39;t remain the case ... as she was one of Megatron&#39;s top Autobot \nassasins. \n&gt; \n&gt; Clasping her clawed hands behind her, standing tall... &quot;You are \nalso very bold to presume I am not all that knowledgable about \nDecepticons.. Leige Maximo.. both Matrixes... or even Megatron & \nGalvatron... & many others.&quot; her crimson optics flashed briefly. \nThis was indeed an interesting challenge. \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Friends.
