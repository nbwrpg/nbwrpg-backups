Thanx for letting me \nknow^_^)\n\nTavatron/Hysteria/CF\n\nTavatron narrowly dodged the shots to her knee, and got a mouthful of ash in \nthe process. She picked herself up from the ground and brushed the majority \nof the black soot from her face and out of her optics. Slag! It was too \nthick! She could barely breath through the thick layer of ash that seemed to \nsettle around the CF. Her scanners picked up various signatures, the three \nmain ones belonging to the Brotherhood. The other signatures were the \noccasional allies or static ghosts.\n\nIn the back of Tavatron&#39;s mind Tav began to stir. She growled in her weary \nsleep. Soon she would be strong enough to try again. In the meantime, \nhowever, she would sleep. The three &#39;bots who were attacking the base, \nhowever, were of great interest to her. If only she could gain control of \nthis pathetic form!! The blasted slag sucking Tavatron was too damn strong! \nShe had never been like this before. It had always been easy to take \ncontrol. Well, Tav sighed in her sleep, she&#39;d just have to try harder next \ntime.\n\nTavatron fired an energy blast from her staff at the energy signature that \nwas Sun Crusher.\n\n*****\n\nHysteria rolled across the top of the CF, barely able to keep from tumbling \noff and crashing into the shields. Eventually she made her way to the center \nof the large covering. She knelt beside a small panel and began to drill and \nweld using various tools from the case she brought with her. The various \nmissiles and shots hit the CF and sent ripples through the shields. All the \nwhile the CF&#39;s comp chimed over her comm:\n\nCF comp: Shields at 47% and falling... 44%...\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
