As a result, they were hit by all \nthe shots that came at them. This broke their reverie.\n\nTyrael stood up and looked around. He took flight and tried to grasp \nthe situation. The predacon goons seemed to be falling back, but he \ncould only see Burrock and Shadow Star, whereas Talon was nowhere to \nbe seen.\n\nTyrael: TRIPREDACUS! REGROUP! WE WILL PUSH THEM BACK FURTHER IF WE \nCONCENTRATE FIRE!\n\nBurrock went to where Shadow Star was and smiled. He didn&#39;t know who \nhe was shooting at, but he shot acidic spikes.\n\nBurrock: Hehe... I like this new order...\n\n\n"}}
