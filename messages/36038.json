He held up his cannon,\nand let its awesome energy roar upwards, ripping through the cieling of\nthe building, the area collapsing around him. \n\n&quot;I am Megatron. New leader of the Decepticons.&quot; He said proudly. The\nstudents looked around at themselves in disbelief.\n\n&quot;But the Decepticons are beaten.&quot; A student said, walking forward.\nMegatron pointed his cannon at the robot, and let a blast of energy rip\ninto him, tearing the robot in two. His painfilled screams filled the\nacademy, as the other trainees covered their heads in fear. \n\n&quot;Bah, Weaklings!&quot; Bludgeon announced. \n\n&quot;I am entitled to agree with you. They serve no role in the future of\nthe Decepticons.&quot; He transformed, into a futuristic hover tank. \n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nHe remembered back. It was his Cybertron mode, before he was outfited\nfor earth. He smiled, in front of Ragnus and Perceptor.\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nBludgeon and Megatron drove away from the academy in their seperate tank\nmodes. Fire was burning the academy in the backround, the flaming heat\nlicking at them as they left. Then a word, and name he could be forced\nto remember yelled out to him. &quot;HALT. In the name of Prime, you are to\nbe destroyed.&quot; Megatron rememberd turning around. Standing there in\nfront of him, the Autobots cut-out hero. Gauntlet Prime. There, standing\nin front of a trailor filled with deactivated Decepticon bodies, was the\nAutobot leader, and carrier of the Matrix. He held up his laser claw,\nhis weapon of choice, and fired it twice, the bolts of energy smashing\ninto the front of Bludgeon, sending the creator of Mettallo, sinking\ninto the destroyed road. &quot;Now its just you and me, Slagmaker.&quot; he said\nthe words with contempt, and Megatron felt the exact same way back.\n\n"}}
