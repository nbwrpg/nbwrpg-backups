His other hand pulls up a rifle, launching several bolts at her.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMosquitor&#39;s insect legs clamp around Celeno as he lands on her, shots hitting him but being mostly ignored. With a wild buzz, he lifts his head back and slams his mouthpieced (the thing that mosquitos suck people&#39;s blood with) into her back (I&#39;m assuming. Its up to you to post damage for that, Airly). As soon as the mouthpiece would be in, spikes would deploy to hold it in place. Two of Mosquitor&#39;s legs push against the ground, launching him and Celeno up, his wings vibrating wildly to lift them off the ground.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Aelo/Celeno/Ocipite::\n&gt; \n&gt; Aelo saw Wheeljack and Hurriacane, dificulty she could avoided their \n&gt; shots and attacks.

She avoided Hurricane&#39;s attack most of Wheeljack&#39;s \n&gt; shots, just 2 shots hit her in one of her wings but she was decided \n&gt; to win she fired 10 energy balls against  Wheeljack, 10 against \n&gt; Hurricane and 5 against Mosquitor\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; :::Wheeljack/Hurricane:::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; :::Wheeljack and Hurricane jumped out of their hiding spots at the \n&gt; sight of \n&gt; &gt; the femms::\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; ::Wheeljack fired 8 shots at Aelo, 8 shots at Celeno, and 8 at \n&gt; Ocipite::\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; ::Hurricane fired 1 lightning bolt at each femm::\n\n\n"}}
