He \nnods.\n\n&quot;Nice look,&quot; he says, tossing Lunarpine a chip and a gun from the \npile.\n\n&quot;A new faction, The Trainers have a mind controll device. That chip \nwill save you from it if its implanted on you,&quot; he explains, &quot;The gun \nwill disable their chip, and also launch a protecting one.&quot;\n\nHe turns his head as he hears bots land outside, Firearm, Proto, and \nSmokescreen walking in.\n\n&quot;Kluster told us to help you out,&quot; Firearm says, &quot;What&#39;s goin&#39; on?&quot;\n\nRamulus pucks up three chips and three guns. &quot;There might be a battle \nsoon,&quot; he says as he gives the devices to them, &quot;Involving a mind \ncontrol device. Those chips will protect your mind, and the gun will \ndisable the control chip.&quot;\n\nThe three Maximals nod, taking a chip and a gun each and proceeding\nto \ninsert the chips into themselves.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(OOC: Is this a nerve gas as in it&#39;ll drive Rex insane?)\n\nRex swears as he sees a can fall near him, coughing when the gas \nstarts to spread around the room.\n\n&quot;I need backup here!&quot; he yells into his comm before falling down. \nEverything goes black as he loses conciousness. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nChordate swears as he hears Rex&#39;s message, tapping a few keys to\nbring \nup a scan of the room Rex was in.

No one is to enter or exit the ship untill situation is \nresolved. Red alert.&quot; he says to the computer, sirens sounding and \nlight flashing all around the Cybertronian Fire as every exit hatch \ncloses and locks, the defences on full alert. Chordate runs out of\nthe \nbridge, his gun ready.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot stops at a door. He was pretty sure this is where \nBrightBlade was.\n\nHe swears as sirens sound all around him, looking around to make sure \nno Maximals were here yet. Raising a fist, he smashes it down on the \ndoor, making a dent. Perndabot continues to try to take the door out, \nhurrying in case any Maxim\n\n\n"}}
