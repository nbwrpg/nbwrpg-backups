He waited until\n&gt; Stingtra went into the water, then he laid down. He went on his side,\n&gt; drawing his knees up and squinted. He didn&#39;t clearly understand. Why did\nhe\n&gt; feel this way? His stomach hurt. He covered his head with a scaly arm. He\n&gt; groaned and closed his eyes. There was something going on that he wasn&#39;t\n&gt; paying attention to.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Visit Ancestry.com for a FREE 14-Day Trial and find your ancestors now.\n&gt; Search over 550 million names and trace your family tree today.
