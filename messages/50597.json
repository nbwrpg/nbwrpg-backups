It was a \ntechno-organic upgrade board that would allow the bot to become one \nmade of millions of electronic cells. Tripredacus scientists had \nworked hard to perfect the new transforming mode, but the results \ngiven were well worth it. Of course, in this case, there was no \nguarantee the pod would even accept the upgrade, but it would \nundoubtedly make the transformer a Tripredacus.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Tankor &lt;lordofdarkness11001@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; the pod scans for lifeforms and finds a cheetah\n&gt;  warriorazure wrote:In the Tripredacus base, the computer rings out \nan alarm. the \n&gt; proximity of the falling pod was dangerously close.\n&gt; \n&gt; Computer: Alert, Alert.
