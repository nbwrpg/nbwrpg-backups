If she had learned anything from h=\r\ner brother, it was how to put up a brave face, and do the things that you w=\r\nere afraid to do no matter if you knew the outcome or not. \n\n&quot;Lord Elder, s=\r\nir, you&#39;re right too, I know what I gotta do, for my brother&#39;s sake.  I - r=\r\neally should try ta talk ta Legacy about all this, and get his side of the =\r\nstory.  Ohh boy, here it goes, Courage 101 in session.&quot;\n\nShe now walks off =\r\nto find Legacy and by intuition, finds him readilly. Being as small as she =\r\nwas, what she was about to do, would take every ounce of bravory in her tin=\r\ny spark. To be sure that she was at eye level with Legacy, so she didn&#39;t ne=\r\ned to crane her neck, she finds the highest point in the room, climbs on it=\r\n, and looks to him as if she were about to talk to Tucson personally.\n\n&quot;Leg=\r\nacy, if it&#39;s okay, could - we talk for a little while?&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, now tha=\r\nt he was alone with Talon, Tucson had now loosened up quite a bit, with his=\r\n usually playful smile upon his face, as Talon envites him to take a walk. =\r\n\n\n&quot;How can I refuse your invitation?  Of course, I&#39;d like that very much, T=\r\nalon.  In fact, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you something for the longest time=\r\n, and this seems like the perfect opportunity to ask you. But first..  Just=\r\n so we&#39;re not interrupted...&quot;\n\nHe types in a code to close the doors, to al=\r\nlow them a little privacy.\nOnce hearing them shut, he smiles to Talon, and =\r\ngently takes her hands.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve seen how happy it has made Rodimus to have N=\r\nightlight in his life and now, I see how happy it is to have you in mine.&quot;\n=\r\n\nHe kneels on one knee.\n\n&quot; Talon, will you do me the honor of being my comp=\r\nanion for all eternity?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nights=\r\ntar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor/nightlight/Elita/Windlord/Kup/Talo=\r\nn\n&gt; \n&gt; Nighlight Smiled and squeezed Rodimus&#39;s hand while she lay down, she=\r\n was \n&gt; getting better and with more energy with every second that passed &quot;=\r\nELita?, \n&gt; where is she? how is she?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elita waved her little tail when=\r\n she hear her mom calling her, she was \n&gt; impatient to go and give her a bi=\r\ng hug, but she knew that she had to wait \n&gt; till her dad and Perceptor deci=\r\nded that it was time\n&gt; \n&gt; *******************************\n&gt; Kup watched the=\r\n scene, letting the couple have time together.

Oka=\r\ny, okay, so yeah, I&#39;m rankn&#39; on \n&gt; &gt; &#39;em\n&gt; &gt; my bad. But seriously, okay, L=\r\negacy works well in battles but his social\n&gt; &gt; skills, leave lots ta be des=\r\nired.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot shrugs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m staying out of this. I&#39;m =\r\nnot the one who brought up the counting\n&gt; &gt; thing.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride nud=\r\nges Uproar.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nice going, open mouth insert paw.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar shr=\r\nugs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Well, it&#39;s kinda true. Every time we try ta ask &#39;em a questi=\r\non we get\n&gt; &gt; blown off.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Yeah, that=\r\n part is kind of right. He&#39;s not exactly the most sociable\n&gt; &gt; part, and no=\r\nthing against him but, he is treading on thin ice with Tucson\n&gt; &gt; sir, and =\r\nI really think someone should talk to Tucson before he blows his\n&gt; &gt; own st=\r\nack. I can see it in my brother&#39;s face, there&#39;s an air about him \n&gt; &gt; that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; seems troubling. One of these days a real fight between them will break=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; out\n&gt; &gt; and there may be no way ta stop it. I tried talking to Tucson=\r\n but he&#39;s as\n&gt; &gt; stubborn as Ratchet in that respect. So, how do we hold th=\r\ne peace with \n&gt; &gt; both\n&gt; &gt; of them, because I&#39;d really like ta know that.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Straightshot, Uproar, Quickstride and Perceptor talked L=\r\nord Elder\n&gt; stopped but kept his back to them a smile blooming across his f=\r\nace. As\n&gt; they talked about what they truly thought of Legacy and his\n&gt; rel=\r\nationship with Tuscon Elder nodded and turned his face now more\n&gt; somber an=\r\nd sober.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You are right.&quot; He said as he walked back towards them. &quot;I h=\r\nad\n&gt; trouble getting to know Legacy, even though it was just me and him\n&gt; g=\r\nuarding the Ark together for a while.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder shrugged, &quot;Heck, sometime=\r\ns I STILL feel like I don&#39;t know him\n&gt; well.&quot; He glanced at each of them. &quot;=\r\nBut maybe we can all try a little\n&gt; harder.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Glancing back in the dire=\r\nction of where Tuscon was Elder nodded\n&gt; solemnly. &quot;I will see if I can tal=\r\nk with Tuscon.&quot; He looked back at\n&gt; the others. &quot;If they got into it I don&#39;=\r\nt know who would win the\n&gt; battle, but I also feel they it would not be goo=\r\nd . . . for any of\n&gt; us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The would be a Prime proble=\r\nm&quot;commended dryly the Predacon\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder looked back at the oth=\r\ners, a smile coming back on his face.\n&gt; &quot;Perhaps you guys should take the t=\r\nime to get to know Perceptor a\n&gt; little better. After all, up until now we =\r\nhave only known him an\n&gt; adversary.&quot; Lord Elder gestured at Perceptor with =\r\na friendly shooing\n&gt; motion.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I will, in the mean time go and have a t=\r\nalk with Tuscon.&quot; Elder\n&gt; turned to walk away.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
