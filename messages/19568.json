His disabled arm and bleeding chest \ndidn&#39;t help his speed at all.\n\nHe swears under his breath as he runs after his love, hoping she \ndidn&#39;t go through any more doors. He didn&#39;t know what it took to set \nthe autoguns off, and he hoped he wouldn&#39;t have to find out anytime \nsoon.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster nods. &quot;That would be Iron Raptor, one second,&quot; he replies to \nChild, walking over to the closest console.\n\n&quot;Computer, locate unit Iron Raptor,&quot; he says, the computer scanning \nthe CF and as far as the scanners reached, which was very far.\n\n&quot;Unit Iron Raptor not in scanner range,&quot; it replied. Iron Raptor&#39;s \nbizzarre third beast mode didn&#39;t register on the Cybertronian Fire&#39;s \nscanners as Iron Raptor.\n\nKluster frowns, turning back to Child. &quot;Guess it&#39;s me then,&quot; he \nsays, &quot;What do you need?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm frowns as Spears&#39; body begins to shake, about to put another \none of the stasis lock devices on her when he pauses, looking down at \nher. He was thinking of a moment many years back, a moment that had \nmarked the beginning of his service in the Maximal military.\n\n(Flashback)\n\nHe was strapped to a table, energon beams holding his arms, legs, and \nhead in place. He could remember himself yelling for them to let him \ngo and fight like real bots, but they had only laughed. They were \nterrorists, going from planet to planet and massacuring colonies. \nFirearm, one of the defenders of a neutral colony that they had \nattacked, was the only one left, and they were about to torture him.\n\nSuddenly, the door blew in, Kluster, Rex, Proto, and a group of other \nMaximals rushing in, weapons leveled at the chests of the terrorists.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re under arrest,&quot; Kluster said, looking in disgust at the \nleader, &quot;Charged with murder. You can give us your weapons and go \npeacefully, or we can blast you to little pieces and take you back to \nCybertron that way.&quot;\n\nThe terrorist laughed, &quot;Maximals are putting me under arrest? How \nabout we use your pieces for scrap!&quot;\n\nThe terrorist brought up his rifle, firing a shot at Kluster&#39;s chest. \nThe Maximal ducked, firing back at the terrorist.\n\nA second later, the room was filled with gunfire and the sound of  \nfighting. A stay shot hit Firearm&#39;s table, the energon beams shorting \nout. The bot jumped up, looking around for the terrorist leader.\n\nA second later, all the gunfire and fighting stopped as a loud \nexplosion filled the room, the bots in it looking at the center to \nsee a black spot occupying the space where the terrorist leader had \nonce stood, his body now laying motionlessly against a wall. An angry \nlooking Firearm stood on the table that he had been strapped to, his \ncannon smoking.\n\nThe terrorists dropped their weapons.\n\n(End Flashback)\n\nFirearm shakes his head, returning to reality. He looks down at \nSpears, frowning. Kluster had let him choose what side he wanted to \nbe on, teaching him the good and bad points of both. He was sure that \neven if he had chosen Predacon, Kluster would have remained his \nfriend and would have helped him in any way he could.\n\nFirearm puts the stasis lock device on Spears. Every bot deserved a \nchoice, but their minds would have to be clear. Firearm would remove \nthe trainer chip, and then he&#39;d let Spears choose, Trainer or Maximal.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
