He&#39;ll talk about the lab later. \nRight now it&#39;s time to test out the TM3 body. He runs outside to see \nPredacons battling Newcomers. Vulois transforms to Tank Mode and \nloads his cannon. He starts randomly firing missles. He&#39;ll focus on a \ncertain member soon, but first he wants his presence to be felt. He \ncontinues to fire missles.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTerminess was still walking around the Pred base when the alarm \nsounded: Someone was attacking!. She doesn&#39;t know much about \nfighting, so she decided her talents could be used best by \ncontrolling the ships guns from the main area. She transforms to \nRobot Mode and heads to the control room.\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nOctociz has reached the downed ship. No one appears to be inside. \nMaybe it was just a lost alien fighter in a battle. Just then Octociz \nwas baraged by blaster fire. He was hit a few times in the head. He \nfell down, unconcious.\n\nWhen he awoke, he was healed. He was, though, strappen to a wall in a \nstrange cave. All sorts of scrap medal was around, as if someone was \ntrying to build something. Octociz turned his head, and their was a \ngiant bot, trying to use the scrap medal to his advantage.\n\n&quot;I see you woke up.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who are you?&quot; demanded Octociz\n\n&quot;The name&#39;s Brocno. I&#39;m a renegade bounty hunter. I capture and \ntorture bots so that I may get something from their side. You&#39;re \ngoing to be my first victim.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you want from me?&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re about to find out.&quot; Brocno said as he activated his \ncomlink. &quot;Maximal base! This Bronco, a new bot in the Neo Beast Wars. \nI&#39;m needing technology to help build my base. I have captured one of \nyour kind, named Octociz. If you want him back alive than you will \ngive me on tracking computer. And no attacks, or he gets it. And to \nprove I&#39;m not bluffing....&quot;\n\nBronco takes out his gun and fires right at Octociz&#39; shoulder. Mech \nfluid was leaking out, and Octociz screamed.\n\n&quot;Ahhhhh!!!!!! Maximals, please....help me....&quot;\n\nOctociz went unconcious again. Bronco continued.\n\n&quot;Meet me by the cliff where the Axalon went down in 5 mega-cycles, or \nOctociz gets it.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
