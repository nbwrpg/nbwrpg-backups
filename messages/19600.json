She looked at the other screen and saw a \nbot trying to sneek in. She grinned,&quot;Oh it looks like I&#39;ll have a \nlittle fun today after all.&quot; She got up and looked at Drillbit. &quot;YOu \nstay here and tell me what I miss on the conversation. I&#39;ll be right \nback.&quot; \n\nShe drew her pistol and walked out. She went down the hallway and \ntowards the entrance. She stopped just around the corner from the \nother bot. She heard his foot falls get sloser. She raised her gun \nand jumped out from behind the corner, aiming at the intruder.\n&quot;FREEZE OR YOUR DEAD! AUTOGUNS! TAKE AIM!&quot;\nThe autoguns aimed at FoxFingers, but waited for the command to fire.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Foxfingers reached the side of Destructors ship. he found an \nairvent leading\n&gt; inside. (Since bots are coming and going the shields must be down.) \nhe\n&gt; scanned the vent to see if it went all the way through. it did and \nwas large\n&gt; enough for him to squeeze through in beast mode. The bot \ntransformed to fox\n&gt; and slid into the ship.\n\n\n\n"}}
