He shuddered, shaking his head \nlightly and flickering his red eyes after she called him cutey. It felt \nweird, but he didn&#39;t respond to it strongly.\n\nHe transformed to his robot mode and walked to the outside of the cave. He \nleaned against the side of the rock formation. He crossed his arms, and \nstared out. So this was their base? He really didn&#39;t like this situation. He \nwas going to be on edge too much, maybe that was why he was being so surly \nto the females. He really didn&#39;t like yelling at them. They were nice bots.\n\nHe looked back. Their gang needed a flier.\n\nHe had a strike of an idea. He knew Rowdy Wolf would know how to help them. \nHe had rather good protection of his own cave in the high mountains.\n\n&quot;Hey Scorponok, where&#39;s boss-bot?&quot;\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Sun, 25 Jun 2000 18:48:15 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;*Stingtra smiled at Quickstrike* Stingtra: I don&#39;t need to go out if you\n&gt;have something for me to help you with, cutey. *Stingtra walks over and\n&gt;grabs an apple* Stingtra: Want anything to eat?\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Sunday, June 25, 2000 6:48 PM\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike felt stupid.

It was morning \n&gt;now.\n&gt;He\n&gt; &gt; looked back at Stingtra. &quot;Ah want e&#39;veryone t&#39; say inside. Well, ya can \n&gt;go\n&gt; &gt; outside, but...don&#39;t go past th&#39; aut-guns&#39; scanners. Hear?&quot; He addressed\n&gt;it\n&gt; &gt; to everyone in the cave. He knew there were too few to go out risking\n&gt;their\n&gt; &gt; lives because someone wanted to go out exploring.\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!\n&gt; &gt; 1.
