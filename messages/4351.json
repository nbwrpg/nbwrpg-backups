Besides, what about me is there to like? I&#39;m small, I&#39;m a rodent, \nI&#39;m not much of a fighter.  I mean I can fight, but I&#39;m not as strong as say \nyou are.&quot;\n\nShe sighed deeply.\n\n&quot;And no one in thier right mental circiuts would even think of liking me \nlike that.  No, Quickstrike isn&#39;t my boyfriend.  Right now, I don&#39;t think he \neven thinks of me as a friend.  No, I&#39;m under his command and all he wil \never do is give me orders and expect me to follow instructions.  If \nQuickstrike is what you seek, then go and seek him.  I will not interfer.&quot;\n\nShe lowered her head and walked back to the mail part of the cave and sat at \nthe computer console.  She whispered to herself, &quot;yup, no bot in his right \nmental circuits would ever like me.&quot;\nShe faced the computer screen and made plans for the hatch cover for the new \nescape tunnel.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
