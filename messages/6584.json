He blinks. \nThey had \n&gt; won! The Maximals had just fought back an almost full-scale assault \nfrom the \n&gt; Newcomers singlehandedly, something that no other faction had done \nso far (to \n&gt; his knowledge).\n&gt; \n&gt; He smiles, looking over the battlefield, but seeing no dead \nbot. &quot;Everyone, \n&gt; grab a CR chamber, and get repaired!&quot; he says into his comm-\nlink, &quot;We have \n&gt; won the day!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that, Striker heads to the Ark, keeping a lookout for any bots \nthat \n&gt; might need help.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl looks at the newcomers as they retreat. The Maximals have \nsuccsessfully \n&gt; defended themselves! He looks over the battlefield, noting no \ncasualties.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ok, see you then,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;The battle&#39;s over. \nWe won!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that, Prowl heads to the equipment room on the Ark. His \nrepairs could \n&gt; wait, he still needed to come up with a plan to get Iron Raptor and \nTavatron \n&gt; out of the Alliance base, the least known base of the three main \nfactions.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus smiles as Striker gives the command to get repaired. \nRepairs were \n&gt; something that the ram could use. He headed toward the CR chambers.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Smokescreen and Ramhorn run up to Shadow Wing and Lunarpine.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We won!&#39; Smokescreen yells. He knew it was childish and silly to \ngo crazy \n&gt; over one victory, but it had been so many battles since the \nMaximals had last \n&gt; won one, that this was almost signifying a new age for them.\n\n\n"}}
