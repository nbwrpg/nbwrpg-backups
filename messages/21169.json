She was almost in robot mode.\nThis was the fifth form she&#39;d transformed into since the virus took hold. He\ndid as she asked and scanned her once more. &quot;It appears that you&#39;ve burned\nit out of your system.&quot; His scans showed mutated mech fluid, functional\ngears, Owl, and Polar bear DNA, and a few things he couldn&#39;t quite explain.\nHer protoform had formed her internal circuitry into what appeared to be\nmutating organics. Somehow when she transformed from polar bear to owl,\neverything inside her &quot;bones&quot; transfered to subspace allowing her to fly.\nUntil now a bot had to rely on either artaficial means like boosters, or\nplain raw strength. (Fuzor Silverbolt.) Now Ice was what he&#39;d envisioned for\na long time. She was science and nature, she was organic and Translife, she\nwas polar bear and owl. Veratis was one step closer to fulfilling Optimus\nPrimes Legacy. All would become one.\n\nVeratis was to busy studying the scans when Ice lifted her &quot;giggling paper.&quot;\nHe heard her say something but was to enthralled by his accident to pay much\nattention.\n\nOh darn, almost had it too.&quot; she said loud\n\n&quot;Had what my dear?&quot; he was trying to figure out what he&#39;d done to create\nthese abilities. Was it the rejection of the scanned DNA that made her so\nstrong? Or maybe it was the combination of the virus and the protoform. Or\nmaybe it was just the power of her spark that caused her transformation.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, November 16, 2000 6:21 AM\nSubject: Re: The next evolution of technology.\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She watched the screen with high interest. She was never very good\n&gt; with these things, but still wanted to learn about them. She saw how\n&gt; the DNA was structured and how it interlinked.\n&gt; &quot;Do you think that if the viru is still present inside of me that I\n&gt; can still, ah, change?&quot;\n&gt; She wasn&#39;t to sure on how the answer may come out, but she was very\n&gt; curious about it.\n&gt;\n&gt; She heard his comment on Lunarpine and her spark fell slightly. &quot;Yes,\n&gt; I suppose your right. But I still have great feeling for him.&quot; She\n&gt; breathed a heavy sigh and walked over to her corner.\n&gt;\n&gt; She layed down and wondered what would happen to her and Lunarpine.\n&gt; She was thinking about how he said he would help her, but how could\n&gt; he?  It was her problem to get her new form under control, not his.\n&gt;\n&gt; She stood up and tried to transform into the griffen mode. But she\n&gt; got stuck. her wings didn&#39;t come out fully and her owl head was\n&gt; jamming half way out. &quot;ARRHHGG!&quot; she groaned.  She stopped and tried\n&gt; again, but she couldn&#39;t transform fully. She strained and make the\n&gt; internal gears grind. It gave out a loud grinding sound as she\n&gt; finally finished the transformation. But she wasn&#39;t a griffin. She\n&gt; stood upright on two legs, covered with soft, white fur. Her head was\n&gt; her robotic head. Her hands were still like her polar bear paws, but\n&gt; her fingers were more defined.  Her light gray owl wings were on her\n&gt; shoulder blades.  She looked at herself and smiled. &quot;This is a form\n&gt; that I think I like.&quot;  Her female figure was more defined with this\n&gt; mode, even though her body was covered with soft, white fur.\n&gt; She felt like her body had finally settled down. The tingling feeling\n&gt; had stopped and her internal proccesses had ceased to change.\n&gt;\n&gt; She smiled.&quot;I&#39;ll stay here in the lab untill you tell me to. And I&#39;m\n&gt; sorry for running away earlier. I know that it was stupid of me to do\n&gt; that. From now on, I&#39;ll follow your orders. Also, can you do one more\n&gt; scan? I want to make sure that I won&#39;t change any more.&quot; She\n&gt; chuckled, &quot;If I keep changing, I&#39;ll start to have an identity\n&gt; crisis.&quot; she couldn&#39;t help but laugh a little. It had been a while, a\n&gt; long while since she had laughed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
