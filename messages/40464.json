Might want to post for that and the huge beam of \nchaochitan energy heading towards her. Although its only her \nsimulated body...\n\n\nVampiza tilts his head to the side at Windlords words. They made \nabsolutely no sense at all... Luckily for Windlord this put Vampiza \noff gaurd and all 25 shots hit him creating wounds in various parts \nof his body. The wounds and pain made Vampiza come back to reality \nand then he unleashed a beam of Choachitan energy at him and then one \nat Cleder.\n\nMeanwhile... at the Oblivion, Frostbite nods and opens a comm to \nZardus seeing as how he&#39;s the only one left and she is the only \nInfecticon to have a comm system naturally.\n\nFrostbite: &quot;That will do. I shall meet you there.&quot;\n\nFrostbite then stood and pressed a button causing the Oblivion to \ndissapear from sight beneath the water. She then headed off for the \nhangar.\n\nStill meanwhile... at the second Infecticon base, Blight laughs a bit \nas he responds to Alectos transmission.\n\nBlight: &quot;Very well... come on in... your going to like it down here. \nDown here we all float...&quot;(couldnt resist putting that in I was \nwatching &quot;It&quot; like last week on Scifi channel... or was it tuesday? \ndamn this mind of mine.)\n\nwith that the vortex opened up again, this time just enough for \nAlecto to fly through it.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
