So i&#39;ll do a quick description now, and a more \ndetailed one later.\n\nThe artifacts are small crystaline square shaped pieces, which go \ntogether to form a larger crystaline sqaure. Under sensors, they \ngive off varrying energon readings, but don&#39;t seem to affect any \nbots by putting them into energon stasis lock. One though could be \nto use the pieces for a power source, but their instability is a big \nproblem. They don&#39;t have a particular colour, but tend to take on a \ndarker colours around bots of evil intent, and lighter colours \naround bots of good intent. They are not actually Vok artifacts, \nrather, the 4 pieces make up the power core for a space cruiser used \nand developed by one of the Vok&#39;s enemies. At the moment, there is \nno known way to actually destroy one of the artifacts... then again, \nnobody has really tried have they. =p\n\nDoes that sound good for the moment?\n\n\n"}}
