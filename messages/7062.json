Please be paitent if I fall \nbehind. Thank you.)\n\n\n* The sight of the enemy base disgusted him, a snarl on his fangs and his \njaw clamped shut as a deep and low growl escaped his throat. Swearing that \nif any Alliance bot was within reach at that very moment there wouldn�t be \nanything left of them when he was through. But he secretly hoped that one \nwould be stupid enough to bump into him, something to relieve his rage upon \nthat was building up with each breath!\nDinobot crouched on a slight rise in the forest surrounding the Alliance \nbase, close enough to get a fairly good view of the enemy ship but just far \nenough to remain out of scanners reach.\nBut knowing that for a fact that if he were only 5 feet more ahead of his \ncurrent position he would then be scanable, though having no interest to \ngive his position away.\nHaving been there for over a mega-cycle he had had plenty of time to think \nabout the task ahead.\nAt this particular point he knew that communication through com-links was \nvery dangerous, their signature and message being able to be scanned and \nlocated very easily at this range.\nThere was no sound, no movement save the wind rustling the branches of Pine \nand Fur above him. Closing his eyes for a moment and listening to the wind, \nit giving variations of the movement of strange things in which he might be \nconcerned to be aware of. However, this day there was something else on the \nwind, something in which slightly calmed him but then sharpened his focus \ntowards the task at hand.\nOpening his eyes he then dug his claws into the needle covered floor, very \naware that there was much to do in the near future and no real time to \nsimply listen to variations of air.\nDinobot growled as he narrowed hie eyes and twitched his tail, knowing that \nhe was ready for the peril that was right in front of him.\nBut it was then that he heard Prowl�s voice liven his com-link, snapping and \ncursing he rose and turned away from the enemy ship. Walking off a mile in \norder not to be detected, knowing that he should have switched off his \ndevice but then knowing that if something was to happen then he needed it \nopen.\nWith a shake of his head and a sigh of annoyance he then sent his location \nto Prowl, coded and recoded as not to be detected by Alliance scanners.\nAlso along with his location was the coded message that as soon as Prowl \nreceived the coded transmission he was to then refrain from using the \ncommunicator any longer. The mission was far too dangerous to be buggered up \nby the simple need to use a traceable device.\nProwl and himself would then use verbal communication when he arrived at his \nposition, and the more closer they came to the Alliance base the more they \nwould rely on signals and such. For ones� voice was traceable as well.\nDinobot then turned towards the Alliance base again but now it was well out \nof view, Pine and Fur now dominated when he saw.\nNow his only task was simple, and perhaps the last simple one he would have \nfor the rest of the day, to simply wait while Prowl came to accompany him. *\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
