Already she knew which race of the metal beings she \nwould be \n&gt; studying, wondering when Biomass would give the order for them to \ngo out and \n&gt; connect with those races.\n&gt; Nue&#39;e looked around the ship from where she sat on the floor, \nlooking over \n&gt; at Stratus as he groans and stood up.\n&gt; Her nature was a little skittish, always looking before she took \nthe leap.\n&gt; But Sublime, on the other hand, was the fun loving type. Taking \nadvanture \n&gt; and danger with ease...and probably getting in trouble that she \ncould have \n&gt; avoided if she would have thought first.\n&gt; Nue&#39;e didn&#39;t really find Sublime as the kind she could relate to \nand become \n&gt; friends, more like the kind who would probably make fun of her or \nsomething \n&gt; such as that.\n&gt; Nue&#39;e gave Sratus a &quot; be nice!&quot; glare when he spoke at Biomass, \ngetting to \n&gt; her feet and pushing her glasses back up the bridge of her nose.\n&gt; She stood off to the side a bit when she saw Biomass snap his head \ntowards \n&gt; Stratus.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We&#39;ll leave when we leave and not before, Stratus.&quot; Biomass said \nsternly \n&gt; before looking his crew over.*\n&gt; &quot; We have a few things to go over first. You all know what you have \nto do \n&gt; but we&#39;de better eat and get ourselves charged before we go \nembarking on the \n&gt; mission. Once fed you can leave when you like. But for myself, I&#39;ll \ngo now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Biomass looked at Nue&#39;e.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You and I go to the same place but you can catch up later.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * He turned and headed towards the door...which just suddenly \nappeared in \n&gt; the side of the room. It closed and sealed itself behind him, a \nhole in the \n&gt; floor appearing where water lapped at the edges.\n&gt;            Outside the ship a giant grey squid jetted away from the \ngreat \n&gt; mass of the ship, stopping in surprise when a smaller seahorse \njoined him in \n&gt; the direction he was going.\n&gt; Biomass&#39;s eyes narrowed.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Nue&#39;e, I thought I told you to stay and eat something. This is \nnothing to \n&gt; charge into with an empty stomach.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Nue&#39;e only looked at him and then ahead.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I wasn&#39;t hungry.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * If there was anything she was, it was eager to see just what this \nnew \n&gt; world was like.\n&gt; So both headed towards a chunk of land several KM away from theyr \ncurrent \n&gt; position, Biomass estimating that they would reach it by evening.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
