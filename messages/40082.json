He launched two missiles, each \nsplitting apart, one heading for Termitron the other for Windlord.\n\nUnitron wasn&#39;t so lucky, although he was going full speed at 54 MPH he was \nonly able to dodge a few shots and a missile, the other missile blowing up \nagainst the armor plating in front of his treads, causing a huge dent and \nslowing him down a few more MPH.  The five shots dug into his armor, causing \ndents but nothing to serious.\n\n&quot;Afts!&quot; he yelled, his cannon swerving quickly on his turret, launching two \nexplosive shells (from a tank, so they&#39;re not bullets) at Hot Rod.\n\n---\n\nFirestarter saw the battle several cycles after crossing the Pacific Ocean \nand passing across some land, hovering several hundred feet above ground in \nhis biped mode.  &quot;Looks like they&#39;re holding their own.&quot;\n\n&quot;So?  Let&#39;s kick tailgate!&quot; Sixshot yelled, divebombing and launching off two \nmissiles, both at Aerotaur.\n\n&quot;Good enough for me!&quot; Firestarter called out after, following the space \nfighter, transforming to his own space fighter mode and firing off twenty \nrapid laser blasts from his nosecone, ten at Cledar and ten at Forrior.\n\n"}}
