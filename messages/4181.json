She smiled, Iron always did love battle.\nShe walked up to her and asked,*\n\n &quot; Did you have a good time, Dear?&quot;\n\n *She grinned and patted Iron on the shoulder. She\nthen became serious and asked.*\n\n &quot; Have you seen Snow Tech? He is supposed to meet me\nhere so we can go get our stuff. Jeeze, guys are\nalways late, excpecially the doepy ones.&quot;\n\n *She gave Prowl a meaningful look, and went to help\nthe two bots to the Cr chambers*\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n * Snow Tech sighed. He was pooped. trying to get to\none place to another trying not be noticed was hard\nwork. He let out a devistating fart that wilted the\nfolige around him.*\n\n &quot; Ooops!&quot;\n\n * That was a bad thing to do, not only did he give\naway his position, he smelled up his armour too.*\n\n &quot; jeeze, better check for skid marks! That was a\ndoozey! Whoa and ranchy!!!&quot;\n\n * He got up on wobbly legs and began to head for the\nArk, trying not to let anything suprise him, the\nresults could be devistating!!!*  \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages with Yahoo!
