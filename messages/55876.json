Your programming \nwould \n&gt; enhance that.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She stood straight. &quot;You are a Predacon, a Decepticon decendent,&quot; \nin some \n&gt; ways, a decendent of her & her comrades. &quot;You are NOT a beast, but \nan \n&gt; instrument of destruction. Some Predacons have perhaps lost the \ndevotion it \n&gt; took to be a Decepticon. I&#39;m NOT a beast, Blackstorm. I am a \nDecepticon. \n&gt; Unfortunately, in some Predacon lookalike form.&quot; She was more \nspeaking about \n&gt; the Predacons she once knew. Their animalistic fury was famous. \nBut the \n&gt; majority of these so called Predacons made the name sake a joke. \nShe would \n&gt; rather be known as a Decepticon. For that is what she still is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Motioning for Blackstorm to come to her, &quot;Stop trying to &#39;think&#39;. \nAccess your \n&gt; data banks & files. If you are a Predacon or Decepticon, you will \nfunction \n&gt; more as a bot, a true Cybertronian. Not some pathetic organic \nbeast.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
