A plan \nto draw out what he&#39;s searching for.\n\n  He remembers this area from his time using the decepticon \ndatabase.  This is where the Predacons have set up base.  He knew the \narea, the maps had shown him that. But he didn&#39;t know just how he&#39;d \nbreak in yet.\n\n  He has spent days mapping the area in his mind, using stealth to \nlook at the defenses and just plain waiting to see what bots have \ncome and gone and to see what the best time to attack would be.\n\n\n"}}
