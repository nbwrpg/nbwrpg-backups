Okay Leo, I&#39;m on\n&gt; it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He transforms into SUV mode and rolls off toward Polar Claw.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hey Leo, ya might wanna make sure Tucson doesn&#39;t see ya!  He gets wind\n&gt; that you didn&#39;t let em do that mission on his own, he&#39;s gonna see that as an\n&gt; act of distrust.  Then he&#39;s really gonna be in a bad mood.  Trust me, I\n&gt; know.  Ratchet was the same way.  Like dad like son.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;I know.&quot; LEO PRIME said over the radio &quot;But sometimes things are far\nmore important than his anger.&quot;\n\nWhen NIGHTSHIFT arrived at POLAR CLAW&#39;s location he was already\nstanding with RAMULUS and the group&#39;s tactical expert PROWL, they were\nall in robot mode standing at the shuttle.\n\nWOLFGANG was standing off to the side manipulating something. &quot;Its\nfueled up and ready to go.&quot; WLFGANG said as he stowed an energon\ndispensing unit in its holster.\n\n&quot;Good!&quot; POLAR CLAW said. he was easily the largest of the group. While\nnot as tall as RODIMUS or TUSCON were, he was still broad and massive,\ngiving he appearance of great size and ferocity.\n\nPOLAR CLAW turned to look at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;You&#39;re here because you know\nTuscon better than we.&quot; There was a dismissive grunt as he glanced at\na PADD he had in his hand, it is ohviously the notes and mission\nparameters he recieved from LEO PRIME.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s gone out alone. Sensors showed that he was going off in the\ndirection of that jungle where Rodimus is suppose to be.&quot; There was\nanother pause from POLAR CLAW, &quot;The same direction Wheelie took as\nwell.&quot;\n\nPOLAR CLAW lowered his padd as he looked at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;Every scan we\nhave of that place shows it is a dense jungle, his inhanced senses\nwill not help him much there. What tactic do you think he will use to\nlocate Wheelie?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
