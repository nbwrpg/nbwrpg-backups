The upper hull had been completely repaired\nand mo=\r\nst of the controls in the cockpit had been returned to working\norder.  The =\r\nship&#39;s computer was non-existent however.  In the fighting\nthat had occurre=\r\nd when Celeron had broken in, and when one of the\nprisoners had decided to =\r\ngo on a murderous rampage, the computer had\nbeen summarily reduced to a pil=\r\ne of silicon and wires.  Although\nCeleron had attempted to reconstruct it, =\r\nthe project had never been\nfinished, and now no one aboard the ship had any=\r\n idea how to fix it.\n\nMost of the outer hatches and doors had been replaced=\r\n using the scrap\nmetal from one of the cargo holds and the prison block had=\r\n been\nreinforced to prevent another escape.  The remaining crew now returne=\r\nd\nto the cargo bay for another strategy meeting and a review of the work\nth=\r\nat had been completed.\n\nAt the table sat Farelwave (the captain), Tigon (th=\r\ne warden of the\nprison block), Betaspiel (a pilot turned repairman), and a =\r\ncouple new\nfaces Rector and Cyphia (both released from stasis only a few da=\r\nys\nprior).  Rector had been the 2nd in command of the security forces\nwhen =\r\nthe ship had been operational, but now he wasn&#39;t certain what his\nrole woul=\r\nd be.  Cyphia was a communications technician, not only did\nshe know how to=\r\n maintain, repair, and build communication equipment,\nbut she also knew how=\r\n to decode encrypted frequencies.  However due to\nthe circumstances, none o=\r\nf the crew were really performing their\noriginal duties.\n\n&quot;I would like to =\r\nwelcome you back to our crew.  I will begin this\nmeeting by giving a brief =\r\non our standing as far as repairs and\nlocation of missing crewmen.\n\nFirst o=\r\nf all, aside from bringing you two out of stasis, we had not\nlocated any mi=\r\nssing crewmen, we will likely be bringing the other\nthree out of stasis whe=\r\nn we are absolutely certain that they were not\nput into stasis because of l=\r\nife-threatening complications, and since\nnone of us are doctors, that could=\r\n take some time.&quot;\n\nThere was a brief pause, the captain smiled and Rector a=\r\nnd Cyphia\nsmiled back nervously.\n\n&quot;As far as the repairs go, the cockpit is=\r\n completely repaired, minus a\nfew key components: the navigation computer, =\r\nthe communications panel,\nand the ship&#39;s computer.  The prisoner that has b=\r\neen repairing the\ncockpit circuitry has been able to repair many of the con=\r\nnections in\nthe security system, and its computer appears to be undamaged, =\r\nhowever\nwe do not have the reactor up in running, and so we cannot power up=\r\n\nthe systems to do a diagnostic.\n\nThe hull has been repaired on about 90% o=\r\nf the surface of the ship\nthat is visible now, I estimate that the buried p=\r\nortion of the ship\nconstitutes another 40% of the total surface area, meani=\r\nng we&#39;re a\nlittle over half-way done with basic external repairs.\n\nThe task=\r\n now, is to go down into the sections of the ship that contain\nthe reactor =\r\nand engines.  That area of the ship was sealed off when we\ncrashed, and sin=\r\nce we no longer have the ship&#39;s computer, I cannot\ndetermine what happened =\r\ndown there.  There are three hazards that\ncould be present down there: 1. R=\r\nadiation, 2. Escaped Prisoners, 3.\nOur Fellow Crewmen mistaking us for pris=\r\noners/enemies/intruders and\nshooting us on sight.&quot;\n\nTigon then turned to th=\r\ne captain, &quot;I only have 5 prisoners that are\nunaccounted for. According to =\r\nmy records though two of them are highly\ndangerous and natural-born leaders=\r\n, so all of the missing prisoners\nare still alive and they are down there, =\r\nthen we might have to\npostpone going in there until we have the other three=\r\n out of stasis. \n5 on 5 odds are not good.&quot;\n\nThe captain responded &quot;I agree=\r\n, the other two problems are also good\nreason why we must take some time to=\r\n prepare.  We are all trained to\nfight, but I know that these prisoners wer=\r\ne incarcerated for a reason,\nand judging by the two of these we had to figh=\r\nt, I&#39;m certain that we\nwill have great difficulty defeating them if they ha=\r\nve organized.\n\nFinally, I think it would be wise to attempt to clear out a =\r\nroom and\nconvert it into a vault or armory that we could use as shelter in =\r\nan\nemergency and also store our valuables in case we need to leave for\nany =\r\nreason.  If anyone would like to volunteer for this project please\nsay so n=\r\now, otherwise I will see to it myself.  Now I will open this\nmeeting up to =\r\nanyone who would like to speak.\n\nBetaspiel raised his hand.  &quot;I would like =\r\nto help you in that project\nsir.  I would also like to see if we can repair=\r\n one of the backup\npower systems and get power to the cockpit and the light=\r\ns in the areas\nthat we are currently using.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good idea, we can give that =\r\ntask to our inmate, just get me a plan on\npaper so I can make sure he has a=\r\n good idea of what we expect from\nhim.  Cyphia, what were you planning to d=\r\no.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well... I was planning to take a look at all the systems in the\ncockp=\r\nit, I hope that we can get some power running to it soon.  I can\nassist in =\r\nthe external repairs until we have power there.  I haven&#39;t\nhad the chance t=\r\no go outside yet.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good, and Rector?&quot;\n\n&quot;It doesn&#39;t appear like anybody ha=\r\ns gone into the other rooms the the\nlower deck that we do have access to.  =\r\nI would like to take a look\naround and then I can bring any weapons to the =\r\nvault when it is\nready.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ok.  And Tigon, I assume you will be leading the=\r\n work on the\nexterior, correct?&quot;\n\nTigon nodded.\n\n&quot;Ok, then I will now go to=\r\n attend the next stasis chamber.  You are\nall dismissed&quot;\n\nEveryone split up=\r\n, left the cargo bay, and began their work.\n\nOOC: I haven&#39;t posted on this =\r\nthread since March.  I figured it would\nbe a shame to let it go. I&#39;ll try t=\r\no post more on it, let my know if\nyou like it or not.  Or if you have any s=\r\nuggestions.  Yahoo IM:\ntitobeau  ^_^  Adios\n\n"}}
