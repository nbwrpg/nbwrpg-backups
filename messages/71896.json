wrote:\n&gt; Tucson looks to Leo with seriousness but with an air of professional calm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; In this case, I feel it&#39;s best to meet them all at once.  This scenario\n&gt; happened to me at one time and of all mechs I had to get tangled up with, it\n&gt; happened to be Sunstreaker and Sideswipe.  At the time they felt that they\n&gt; were the hot shots of the Autobot faction and they felt I was just another\n&gt; slow moving, fuel hungry off roader, like Trail Breaker, Hound, Beach Comber\n&gt; and even Ratchet.  Although they had the spark to ridicule Ratchet behind\n&gt; his back, it was another story when he was around them.  &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ratchet and I had a lot in common, mostly our short tempers and low\n&gt; tolerance for ridicule by fellow soldiers.  That too was something I got\n&gt; ridiculed for.  One day they went too far with their snide commentary and I\n&gt; got into a severe altercation with the two of them.  I&#39;m not proud of this\n&gt; mind you, but I can&#39;t deny that it happened.  The fight ended with\n&gt; considerable damage to me and the two of them, but more so to them.  Ultra\n&gt; Magnus had to literally pry me off of them because of the strength advantage\n&gt; I had over them.  It wasn&#39;t long before we were all brought to Optimus Prime\n&gt; due to our dispute that I admit that I started, and he was not happy with\n&gt; all three of us.  He did not discriminate against any of us and gave us our\n&gt; reprimands as equals all at the same time.  He then told us that the lesson\n&gt; to be learned was that we needed to work as a team if we&#39;re ever to get over\n&gt; our differences.  The brothers were not thrilled about that and neither was\n&gt; I .  But we still did as we were instructed, we worked together during a\n&gt; weeks time, learning how to cooperate and learn about who we really were on\n&gt; the inside.  We never thought it would work until..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gives a sigh.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was during one of our famous battles on Cybertron, we were under heavy\n&gt; fire by the Seekers and and they were much faster in flight than we were on\n&gt; wheels.  Side Swipe was on my left and Sunstreaker was on my right, a good\n&gt; distance ahead.  I tried to keep up with them but at the time my alt form\n&gt; was more suited for strength rather than speed.  It took only one shot from\n&gt; the seekers to destroy the road ahead of me, taking the twins with it.  At\n&gt; that time our differences meant nothing to me and I quicky shifted into\n&gt; robot mode, while still in motion, mind you, I slid on my chest for a good\n&gt; twenty feet, reached out and caught their back bumpers just before the fell\n&gt; hood first into a large bottomless void, created by the seekers.  They\n&gt; quickly transformed but I still held onto them.  As soon as they turned\n&gt; around, I retained my position so they could climb to safety.  I was never\n&gt; in so much pain in my life after that but for the first time, they were\n&gt; extremely thankful for what I had done, and they apologized for all the\n&gt; ridicule they inflicted on me and so I did the same and we shook hands.\n&gt; After that, we embraced each other, thankful we all made it out in one\n&gt; piece.  I have a feeling the same could be so with my sister, Rattrap and\n&gt; Wheelie.  But they may need more than just a week.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Aug 25, 2011, at 9:42 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LEO PRIME glanced over at his console as it beeped at him. &quot;Wheelie\n&gt;&gt; has arrived in at the Ark again.
