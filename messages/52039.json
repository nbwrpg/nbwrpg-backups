I am \nlooking for the Maximal known as Talos. Things are getting itchy back \non Cybertron and the High Command wants him back. All I demand is safe \npassage away from here.\n\nHe knew he was asking for much, but it was his safest move, lest he \nwanted to leave in pieces. Besides, he gave them plenty of room to \nnegotiate, which was not very pleasant, but what choice did he have? \nHe intruded on their territory and started the fight.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Oh, I never had it in mind to actually KILL him ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Devilact holds up his hand, and the Rogues halt their attack, \n&gt; although they keep their weapons ready.  &quot;Very well,&quot; he \n&gt; says.  &quot;Speak, and we shall listen.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC (last one i hope): Ok I don&#39;t want to start an argument with \n&gt; you. \n&gt; &gt; I admit that I should have accepted more damages, but my main fear \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; for Yggdrasil&#39;s survival. Anyways, let&#39;s keep it in game. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil felt a smile tug at his lips as he saw that his particle \n&gt; &gt; hits had not missed target. Hitting Devilcat was missing his \n&gt; target, \n&gt; &gt; as he saw the forest around slowly start to burn.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With Jayde out of the way, he knew that he was in deep trouble. He \n&gt; &gt; raised his shield against Fury&#39;s knife; it was torn out of his \n&gt; grip. \n&gt; &gt; He was not in the best situation. He kept track of Fury with both \n&gt; &gt; machine guns but did not fire.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: I demand a cease-fire! Let me talk! I&#39;m not here for \n&gt; you, \n&gt; &gt; so let me explain!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I see.  And I got an exemption on the faction bit already - \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; turned out to be necessary as there&#39;s only one non-cardhead \nRogue \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kicking around.  (And her controller is asleep at the switch \n&gt; again.) \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Torin hit the dirt and Fury attacked with TWO weapons \n&gt; capable \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reaching the target - you obviously misread my last post.  \n&gt; (Fury&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lashknife works both at a distance and in a melee - it&#39;s a blade \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attached to a handle by an extending cable.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jayde takes several hits as she scrambles behind cover.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fury, whirling his lashknife in confusing patterns, closes to \n&gt; easy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; striking range - still outside Yggdrasil&#39;s reach - and slashes \n&gt; out \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the whiplike device.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gatara and Devilcat also close in, the former trading her \nmachine \n&gt; &gt; gun \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for a long chain and the latter brandishing his laser sword - \n&gt; taking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the particle fire on his energy shield.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Torin and Riekan regroup to one side, waiting for a sniping \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Fine, I just wanted to give him a break before I started \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accept lots of damages. And may I remind you that normal \n&gt; faction \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rules \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say that one player isn&#39;t supposed to possess more than 50% of \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; faction? Besides, Torin was aimed too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BIC: Yggdrasil knew this was getting very nasty. He managed to \n&gt; &gt; fire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; twice more with his particle canon before two bommerang blades \n&gt; dug \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deep in his right arm. It started feeling numb and he dropped \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gun. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Torin&#39;s counterattack hit him hard in the abdomen. He tries to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reach \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for his barkskin shield to get some cover, but the blast from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Devilcat&#39;s and Gatara&#39;s weapon throw him back, missing him by \n&gt; only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a few feet in front of him. He stands and is hit by Jayde&#39;s \n&gt; shot. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rises his shield and blocks Fury&#39;s venom shots and turns at \n&gt; Jayde \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fires wildly his two machine guns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: Freaking preds of my slag!\n\n\n"}}
