The first was a big and \ntall \n&gt; &gt; one, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he had red eyes and a sinister laugh.  He laughed at Malice, \n&gt; until \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice curled up to cover his audios.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The second was a femme, tall and slender.  She too laughed at \n&gt; him, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and pointed and laughed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The third and final was also a femme.  But she was differant.  \n&gt; She \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was a little shorter than the previous, and kind.  She kneeled \n&gt; &gt; down \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and tried to reach out to him.
