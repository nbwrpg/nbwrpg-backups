He clenched his right fist \nwith eagerness; he wanted to do it again. \n\n&quot;Rodimus, know this: Nigh--&quot; He stops cracking another evilish \ngrin, &quot;Blackstorm is of no consequence. Whether she lives or dies \nmatters not. Your eminent destruction comes, preparing for it will \nonly further your suffering. Hydras out.&quot; As he closes the comm \nline, a deep laugh rumbles from Hydras.\n\n&quot;Well done Maxima.&quot; He places his hand on her shoulder. &quot;Now we must \nplan to use Blackstorm to lure Rodimus out so we can destroy him.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt; Maximadid as was asked, without question or looking at Hydras. \n&gt; \n&gt; Touching a few buttons, then within a second was Nightlight&#39;s \nvoice & some \n&gt; torturing moments. Not screams much, but some slight noticing \nmoments of pain... \n&gt; as well as the moment she was reprogrammed into Blackstorm... & \nPerceptor&#39;s \n&gt; little informative reprogramming of who she was. & her \nacknowledgement of she \n&gt; being Blackstorm & no longer Nightlight. There was no mention.. of \nNightlight. \n&gt; Just... Blackstorm. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her crimson optics glanced up to Rodimus & a wicked smirk cracked \nher face. \n&gt; Oh, she was enjoying this. The more torture for him, the better.\n\n\n"}}
