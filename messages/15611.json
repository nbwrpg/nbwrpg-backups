She dreamed she was in a place far away from the \nwar.  It was beautiful.  Lush,green hillsides, trees filled with \nflowers and fruits.  Waterfalls that fell into clear blue pools that \nteamed with fish and lily pads.  She could hear birds singing in the \ndistance.  The sun was high and felt warm to her.  She smiled at the \nvision. \n\nLaying on the ground, her eyes closed.  Her body lay there, \nmotionless. \n\n\n"}}
