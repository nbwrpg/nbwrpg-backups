And, believe it or \nnot, she cared about each and every one of them. And would be sorry to hear \nif any of them had passed away or been seriously injured.\nShe looked arounf the room again before she suddenly heard a voice coming \nfrom behind her, from the direction of the door.\nIron Raptor half turned to see a feline bot standing there, one the looked \nstrangely familier but she couldn&#39;t quite place where she had seen him \nbefore.\nNo matter. She would find out later.*\n\n&quot; Yes, I am. Can I help you?&quot;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
