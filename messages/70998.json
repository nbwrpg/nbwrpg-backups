To s=\r\nave his life by endangering that of another comrade.  And now, given that u=\r\nltimatum, he still holds firm, determined that if anyone was to give themse=\r\nlves up, for a cause, it would be himself only.  He did not care if he was =\r\nto suffer greatly for his actions, if they saved his comrades it was enough=\r\n satisfaction for him.  He cared not for power, but cared deeply for those =\r\nwho meant the world to him.  Talon, very much so, Lord Elder, Rodimus, and =\r\nall of the Maximals and Autobots he got to know.  No, it was not worth givi=\r\nng up one of them to save his own life.  He meets Hydras&#39;s glare with his o=\r\nwn optics.\n\n&quot;What you ask of me, I can not do.  Although, I will surrender =\r\nmyself in Perceptor&#39;s stead.  No way in the name of Primus am I going to pu=\r\nt any of my comrades in mortal danger.  If anyone is to meet a dangerous ou=\r\ntcome, I will be willing to take that chance.&quot;  \n\nNight Shift looks to Kup =\r\nand Straight Shot.  His gaze quite grim.\n\n&quot; No, it can&#39;t end like this.  If=\r\n he gives himself up, I&#39;m givn&#39; myself up too.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds, as sh=\r\ne looks to Talon and Kup.\n\n&quot;And if he gives himself up, I&#39;ll give myself up=\r\n too.  There&#39;s no way that lizard creepoid&#39;s gonna take one of our own like=\r\n that.&quot;\n\nThey step toward Tucson with their hands up, to show no weapons wi=\r\nthin them. Tucson looks to them.\n\n&quot;What are you two doing?&quot;\n\nNight Shift lo=\r\noks to him.\n\n&quot;Whatever you&#39;re don&#39;.  If they take you they gotta take us to=\r\no. Okay Hydras, you said no prisoners, but we&#39;re not gonna let Perceptor go=\r\n.  Instead, we&#39;re givn&#39; ourselves up. Besides, a ninjabot&#39;s highly prized f=\r\nor their skills.&quot;\n\nIn a slight moment of pause, a flurecent blue material t=\r\nrickles down Tucson&#39;s injured arm, as a drop of that liquid hits the ground=\r\n with an audible splat, as it disperses, and spatters the ground.  Several =\r\nmore drops follow.  It was also apparent that Tucson was faltering a slight=\r\n. A sure sign that he was losing more than just the regular lubricant.\n\nStr=\r\naight Shot looks down to the puddle and then back to Tucson&#39;s heavilly dama=\r\nged arm.  Yet, he wasn&#39;t paying too much attention to it.\n\n&quot;Oh no.  Battery=\r\n fluid.

Insecti=\r\ncon, Bruticus-X, and\n&gt; Iguanus moved in almost eagerly to pick up the might=\r\ny weapons that\n&gt; Tuscon has dropped, while Inferno, the self proclaimed bod=\r\nyguard of\n&gt; Hydras watched Tuscon carefully, his optic ready to spot treach=\r\nery.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quietly a short message is sent to Tuscon, &quot;Tuscon.&quot; The deep voi=\r\nce of\n&gt; Noctorro, the leader of the Maximal Fuzors can be heard, &quot;My team i=\r\ns\n&gt; here. Rodimus sent us to aid you. None too soon it would seem.&quot;\n&gt; Nocto=\r\nrro&#39;s words are grim, a soldier&#39;s humor in them. &quot;We await your\n&gt; signal.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time Injector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, and Quickstrike move=\r\n\n&gt; to do the same with Kup, Nightshift, Straightshot, Talon and the\n&gt; other=\r\ns. Skyshadow, the leader of the Predacon Fuzors just watches with\n&gt; a gloat=\r\ning look on his face, it is almost as if he wants them to\n&gt; attack and keep=\r\n the battle going.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Phobia and several sweeps keep an eye on =\r\nthings from the\n&gt; air, while Terrorsaur and Waspinator landed, ready to hel=\r\np out as\n&gt; needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time Legacy processed Tuscon&#39;s command =\r\nfor him to leave\n&gt; the Ark. There was a long pause, and then the temporal g=\r\nuardian&#39;s cold\n&gt; voice comes across the channel, &quot;I will not comply with yo=\r\nur command.\n&gt; I have been tasked with the . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Deepstryke=\r\n transmits to Hydras, &quot;Hydras. I am picking up an encrypted\n&gt; transmissions=\r\n to and from Tuscon, he is attempting to communicate with\n&gt; the others. I a=\r\nm generating a radio dampening field now in this area.\n&gt; Only the Predacons=\r\n will be able to transmit.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile inside the Black Tower:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nWindlord&#39;s attempt to open fire on the Scourge was met with a measure\n&gt; of =\r\nfutility. Scourge just stepped away from the opening that Windlord\n&gt; fired =\r\nout from and let the shots go harmlessly into a bulkhead,\n&gt; scorching it on=\r\nly slightly.\n&gt; \n&gt; However that slight amount of time allowed Windlord and R=\r\nat Trap time\n&gt; to scurry further into their crawl space and find an interio=\r\nr bulkhead\n&gt; to hide behind.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Scrap!&quot; Scourge&#39;s voice said from the ou=\r\ntside. There was a pause and\n&gt; then, &quot;Cyclonus, they have fled into the wal=\r\nls.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was another pause, and then Scourge chuckled, &quot;Of course. I=\r\n will\n&gt; be ready for them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; From further inside the crawl space the so=\r\nunds of chittering could be\n&gt; heard, and then several groups of optics coul=\r\nd be seen in the distance\n&gt; coming towards Rat Trap and Windlord. In the da=\r\nrkness their shapes\n&gt; could only be barely made out, but they looked like b=\r\nlack metallic\n&gt; spiders, Hydras&#39; wall guardians!\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: Rat Trap may re=\r\ncognize them from last time. Also keep in mind\n&gt; that Rat Trap and Windlord=\r\n should be in beast mode. They would have to\n&gt; be to fit inside the crawl s=\r\npace. In the toon the Beast Modes did not\n&gt; have offensive weaponry, except=\r\n for teeth and claws)\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside the Ark:\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus was positioned in =\r\na small grove of trees, ducking down behind\n&gt; several large rocks. He gives=\r\n Quickstride a quizzical look as the\n&gt; equine Maximal sniffed him.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OO=\r\nC: Quickstride&#39;s sniff reveals nothing wrong.)\n&gt; \n&gt; He was about to let Qui=\r\nckstride in on what he had planned when Uproar\n&gt; appeared. Rodimus appears =\r\ntaken aback though by Uproar&#39;s conclusion\n&gt; that it was Legacy that had tur=\r\nned evil. While Rodimus didn&#39;t know\n&gt; that much about Legacy, having only s=\r\neen him briefly while being\n&gt; rescued and repaired, there was nothing to hi=\r\nnt that this attack was\n&gt; Legacy&#39;s doing. He was about to say something whe=\r\nn Uproar ran towards\n&gt; the Ark to be let in . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;KRACK POW&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As =\r\nUproar ran towards the Ark, what seemed like a round bolt of\n&gt; lightening a=\r\nppeared, sending Uproar flying several yards through the\n&gt; air, to land hea=\r\nvily on the ground! Evidently the Ark shielding was\n&gt; still in place, and i=\r\nt was not allowing anyone in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus frowned, &quot;Uproar! Get over here!=\r\n If we are going to get back\n&gt; in, then we need to work together. That shie=\r\nld is supposed to hold off\n&gt; all the Predacon forces. We are not going to g=\r\net in by brute force.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Rodimus talked three other Maximals seemed t=\r\no almost materialize\n&gt; out of the underbrush, such was their skills at camo=\r\nuflage.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first was Wing Caliber, (See: http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Skywa=\r\nrp ) an\n&gt; old Maximal stratagist and military teacher, who from the brownis=\r\nh\n&gt; feathers along his frame turned into some sort of eagle.\n&gt; \n&gt; The next =\r\nwas Leo II,\n&gt; (http://en.academic.ru/pictures/enwiki/76/Lioconvoy_gathering=\r\n.jpg )\n&gt; the adopted son of Lio Convoy, and who looked much like him, and w=\r\nho\n&gt; had obviously picked up many of his mannerisms. His body was\n&gt; powerfu=\r\nlly built and heavily armored. He looked to turn into a lion.\n&gt; \n&gt; The thir=\r\nd was Ramulus (http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ramulus) who had like\n&gt; the others be=\r\nen on patrol for a while, surveying the area and trying\n&gt; to keep it free f=\r\nrom Predacon invasion.\n&gt; \n&gt; They also come up beside Rodimus, Leo II, obvio=\r\nusly the leader of the\n&gt; other two, &quot;What now sir?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus looked at =\r\nQuickstride and Uproar, &quot;Well let&#39;s get out of\n&gt; sight, and then we can dis=\r\ncuss it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Inside the Ark:\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor had received Tuscon=\r\n&#39;s message and sent attempted to send a\n&gt; message to Lord elder, however at=\r\n the moment there was no answer from\n&gt; the elder Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same =\r\ntime Legacy was still standing in the med lab along with\n&gt; the others, his =\r\nsingle optic glowing in the darkness.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It would seem that Nightlight&#39;s=\r\n vital systems are being held at\n&gt; minimal levels.&quot; Legacy said as he direc=\r\nted his gaze to the wall panel\n&gt; nearest Nightlight. A small light blinked,=\r\n indicating her spark was\n&gt; still online, but that there was not enough pow=\r\ner to reboot her\n&gt; systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to look at the others, his face =\r\nglowing in the darkness, lit\n&gt; by his own optic, and the glowing bar on his=\r\n chest plate. He raised\n&gt; his right hand in the air, the one with the arm c=\r\nannon on it and begin\n&gt; to emit light from it, much like a flash light or a=\r\n beacon so that the\n&gt; room was illuminated. He casually looked around, &quot;Per=\r\nhaps we could\n&gt; locate a back out or reserve power system . . . &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lega=\r\ncy paused as Tuscon&#39;s message came in. He turned to look at\n&gt; Santon, Bump =\r\nand Perceptor, a look of disbelief momentarily flashing\n&gt; across his face.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy straightened as his cold voice comes across the channel, &quot;I\n&gt; w=\r\nill not comply with your command. I have been tasked with  . . . .\n&gt; &gt;*BZZZ=\r\nTT!*&lt;  . . . the protection of the Ark as well as that of the\n&gt; Matrix. I w=\r\nill not knowingly leave the Ark undefended or the Matrix in\n&gt; the hands of =\r\nanother.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy turned to look at his console as he understoodf what =\r\nhappened.\n&gt; Communications had been cut part way through his message. He tu=\r\nrned to\n&gt; look at the others, his single optic cold, &quot;It is illogical to be=\r\nlieve\n&gt; that I would attempt to harm the Ark or allow anyone to take it fro=\r\nm\n&gt; the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Please keep in mind th=\r\nat radio/video communications from the\n&gt; battle field around the Black Towe=\r\nr have been severed for the Maximals\n&gt; and Autobots. Those at the Ark howev=\r\ner are free to communicate with\n&gt; each other if they choose.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sandy&#39;s M=\r\nessage: (Message #70992)\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson now recieves Notcorro&#39;s message. He th=\r\ninks of a way to signal him\n&gt; without drawing attention to himself or the o=\r\nthers. It was critical. He \n&gt; keeps\n&gt; his weapons down, and sends an encryp=\r\nted message back to Noctorro.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re right, I&#39;m not exactly perfect,=\r\n and help would gladly be \n&gt; appreciated.\n&gt; I have an idea. While I have yo=\r\nu on an encrypted signal, I best let you know \n&gt; to\n&gt; start moving in now. =\r\nBut try to remain unseen, move in gradually, and \n&gt; quietly.\n&gt; If you can, =\r\nsend in several fuzors in at a time, and in phases, send in \n&gt; others,\n&gt; ac=\r\ncording to their skills and expertise. I will continue to hold my position\n=\r\n&gt; here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Night Shift and Straight Shot keep quiet. They could tell Tuc=\r\nson was in \n&gt; thought,\n&gt; and somehow thinking up a strategy to get them out=\r\n of their bind. He now had \n&gt; to\n&gt; send a message to Legacy.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Legacy, =\r\nif you can hear me, I strongly suggest that you heed my demands and\n&gt; vacat=\r\ne immediately. You are endangering the lives of Nightlight and the \n&gt; other=\r\ns,\n&gt; and those who endanger my comrades, deserve not to be among them. Alth=\r\nough, \n&gt; I\n&gt; will be willing to meet with you privately in a remote locatio=\r\nn of your \n&gt; choice.\n&gt; But not now. Now is not the time. Heed my words now =\r\nand things will not be\n&gt; difficult.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Back at the Ark, Uproar hears Rod=\r\nimus, and trots over to him, looking a bit\n&gt; confused. Quickstride looks ov=\r\ner to him as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Sorry for the fuss, hey, what&#39;s go&#39;n on? Why won&#39;=\r\nt the Ark open for us?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstride looks over to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Legacy is=\r\n holding the Ark hostage, I think, or at least that&#39;s what I got \n&gt; from\n&gt; =\r\nthe last message from Lord Elder.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Uproar looks to the Ark and back at=\r\n Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Whew, I&#39;m glad you stopped me, Sir. No tell&#39;n what kind of =\r\nattack I \n&gt; could&#39;ve\n&gt; met up with. Okay, I&#39;m definitely in on helping you =\r\nout. But how are we \n&gt; gonna\n&gt; get the Ark back without getting blown ta sc=\r\nrap?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstride looks to Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah, what he said, how are =\r\nwe gonna get outa this mess? This is something\n&gt; neither one of us has ever=\r\n encountered.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo! Gro=\r\nups Links\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
