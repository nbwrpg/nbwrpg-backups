The sheilds \nwere \n&gt; raised, and autoguns armed. With the freash scourch marks on the \nhull it \n&gt; seems there might have been a rescent battle.\n&gt;     &quot;Now this is where i take command of my former troops. Watch \nand you \n&gt; might lern something, Major Gremlin.&quot; Hell Beast gloated as he \nreached his \n&gt; comm unit, &quot;This is Predacon Senetor and Commander Hell Beast. I \nhave \n&gt; returned to retake command of the Predacon forces. Open the hatch \nnow! Thats \n&gt; an order!&quot; He barked.\n&gt;     \n&gt;     Aracnia slapped herself on the head. First Megatron and now \nHell Beast. \n&gt; And Hell Beast was going to take command. &quot;Alright, let him in. \nQuickstrike, \n&gt; go to the hatch and meet him there. The rest of you finish up \ncleaning and \n&gt; hurry! Darkmouse, you go and scout out where Megatron is hiding, \nthen radio \n&gt; us back so we can get Inferno. Hurry!&quot; She said picking up debris \nalong with \n&gt; Rampage, Tarantulas, Aerostreak, and Paralysis.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron, Aquarious, Paddle Tail, Night Eyes, and an \nunconscience \n&gt; Inferno, and hopefully Terrorsaur made it to the cave. They entered \neasil and \n&gt; found Waspinator reclining on the Command Chair enjoying himself.\n&gt;     &quot;Trechorous bug! You left me to die!&quot; He snapped at the bot. \nWaspinator \n&gt; spun around and dropped to his knees.\n&gt;     &quot;Megatron! Slug bot said you were dead! He went to go and \nsalvage some \n&gt; parts from the transport.&quot; Waspinator said in his annoying bug \nvoice.\n&gt;     The tyrant sa on the command chair and turned to the \nmonitors, &quot;Well, \n&gt; this is our place now. And with Inferno we can now commence the \ncloning. It \n&gt; will take awhile....but with the clones we will dominate the Beast \nWars once \n&gt; and for all!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
