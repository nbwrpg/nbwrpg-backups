He has a main power core which is, and that&#39;s the one that=\r\n&#39;s gone dangerously low, nearly putting him in stasis lock.  But he also ha=\r\ns a tiny backup battery which has never been tapped into so this is the one=\r\n he&#39;s using now.  This little battery backup has ninety five percent power,=\r\n but unlike his main battery, it can not power his weaponry.  It can only p=\r\nower his transformation between robot and SUV mode.  He really can not figh=\r\nt Rodimus at this time, yet he is going to exchange a moment of idolness be=\r\ntween them, then he&#39;ll just switch back to SUV mode, and he knows now is no=\r\nt the time to fight.  He has no power for that.  It&#39;s an emergency backup w=\r\nhich allows for escape but nothing more.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Pr=\r\neston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have to apologiz=\r\ne. I thought I would have time to post after work, but I\n&gt; don&#39;t really hav=\r\ne it, they worked me like a dog today. Couldn&#39;t slide in at\n&gt; lunch like I =\r\ndo sometimes either :(\n&gt; \n&gt; I will not be here this weekend to do the battl=\r\ne between Tuscon, and the\n&gt; others who will be arriving. - Remember, Scourg=\r\ne, Cyclonus and I assume\n&gt; Perceptor were tracking Rat Trap, so they would =\r\nalso be arriving at this\n&gt; time. So you can either have someone else contro=\r\nl Dark Rodimus, let oner of\n&gt; airly&#39;s character step up instead or wait til=\r\nl Monday. I&#39;m sorry :(\n&gt; \n&gt; My question for Sandy is: How much energy does =\r\nTuscon have? At one point he\n&gt; was so low he was going into stasis lock bec=\r\nause of depletion. He got a\n&gt; boost from Rat Trap, but then dropped to 40% =\r\nduring his wild ride to rescue\n&gt; Nightlight. Then in your post before your =\r\nlast you said he had just enough\n&gt; to transform into his SUV mode indicatin=\r\ng he was really low - which made\n&gt; sense, but now in your last post he has =\r\n95% of a battery back up left, and\n&gt; is ready to do battle with Rodimus? Re=\r\nmember, I had Zarak scanning Tuscon\n&gt; quite closely back there in the hall,=\r\n and I am based his actions in the\n&gt; torture chamber on what you revealed. =\r\nHe would have seen that, or should\n&gt; have. Please help me out here :)\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nSee you folks Monday. Again, sorry for the premature departure. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; On =\r\nFri, Feb 26, 2010 at 5:37 AM, supercyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will try to post this afternoon/evening when I g=\r\net home from work.
