He finds that physical fire isn&#39;t much good against the insects but w=\r\nhen he did excercise spiritual power, it seemed to help Vestige and himself=\r\n immensely.  He thinks for a moment and looks to Vestige.\n\n&quot;Vestige, our po=\r\nwer lies in something that these insects do not have.  Our hearts.  The sim=\r\nplest power of all, one that all living creatures are capable of expressing=\r\n, and the one ability that these creatures do not possess.  We must use tha=\r\nt power now if we&#39;re going to vanquish our enemy and get Rodimus back.  it =\r\nwill unite all three of us, and only then, can we defeat this foe.&quot;\n\nHis ch=\r\nest now pulsating as it had before, with the force of a beating heart fille=\r\nd with compassionate power.  Several plates on his chest shift, as a well p=\r\nrotected heart like structure beats luminously.  He looks to Vestige.\n\n&quot; Ou=\r\nr compassion for each other, our loyalty to our comrades, our love for our =\r\nfellow Autobots.  That is the one power that can never be extinguished.  Yo=\r\nu believe in that power, reach down, touch it, and allow yourself to allow =\r\nit to flow freely within you.  It will light all flames as it has for centu=\r\nries.  We can do this Vestige, we can do this.  For Rodimus Prime, our hear=\r\nts are with him, as his is with us.  Let&#39;s unite them and end this once and=\r\n for all.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson transforms beside Vestige, and nodds =\r\nin readiness to fend off the enemy insectoids. He draws up one of the missi=\r\nle barrels from his cab, and attatches it to his left arm. He saves the sec=\r\nond for later, just in case it was needed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Time for a little pest=\r\n control, Prime style. All right Vestige, ready when you are, let&#39;s put the=\r\nse bugs in their place and get Rodimus back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vestige smile=\r\nd again as he turned back to the insects in front of him,\n&gt; laying down a t=\r\nremendous amount of firepower!\n&gt; \n&gt; Several of Vestige&#39;s attacks strike hom=\r\ne, tagging the approaching\n&gt; creatures on thier back and head. However thes=\r\ne creatures seemed to be\n&gt; built amost like tanks! Although there were a fe=\r\nw burnt and blackened\n&gt; areas on thier armored forms they still rushed fowa=\r\nrd to attack,\n&gt; cannons on thier backs orienting on Vestige and Tuscon and =\r\nfiring in\n&gt; return!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile from behind the buzzing sound was gettin=\r\ng closer, and the\n&gt; room began to rumble a little more violently. The figur=\r\ne on the bed\n&gt; bounced around, but otherwise did not move. The larger femal=\r\ne that had\n&gt; been knocked out earlier seemed to have regained consciousness=\r\n and\n&gt; with the grinding of gears she too shifted form and rushed in to\n&gt; a=\r\nttack!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: I am unsure if Tuscon was firing yet or not. B=\r\nut if so, than the\n&gt; attacks are about as effective as Vestige&#39;s)\n&gt; \n&gt; Pres=\r\nton\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
