There was a slight familiar \nscent in the air. It was from the female mouse. He sniffed again. He had \nsmelt it before. At that, he remembered being in the forest, sitting on a \nlog, with his leg badly damaged. He thought she had been there, right in \nthat forest. And once, he may have heard her voice over comm-link.\n\nHe had to find out. Maybe he could and save her if she was with them. She \nhad to be. She was near a group of Predacons when he had his leg busted \nopen. Seeing her in her present condition made him a little nervous.\n\nHe stared at her body. &quot;Ah hear you b&#39;fore?&quot; Nothing at the moment could \ntear his optics way from his stare, only if they pulled him by force and hit \nhim.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
