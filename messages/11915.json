In his\n&gt; right fist he clenched a bladeless hilt, with a flick of a button \nhis\n&gt; energon sword flared to life, humming warmly in his fingers. The \nother\n&gt; object was much like a door sheild yet the main face of it was \nempty until\n&gt; it too was turned on, an energy sheild filling the gaps to provide\n&gt; protection.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Xiane arrived just as Spears was blasted from her spot behind \nthe metal\n&gt; plate, kneeling down he examined the bot. &quot;Hail to thee m&#39;lady, it \nseems I\n&gt; find myself on a battlefeild yet know not the very sides I face.

She glided in right \nbetween\n&gt; &gt; the shots. They miss her by centimeters.

He was now upside down, facing Shadow Wing.  He opened\n&gt; &gt; fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a barrage of 5 rapid laser bolts, not wanting to use up to\n&gt; &gt; much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy to take out such a simple target.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
