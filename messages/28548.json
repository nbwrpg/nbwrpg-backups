I thought the number was considerably less.  Therefore \nI&#39;ll add \n&gt; the damage to Unicron now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another thing, please excuse JP of anything rash at the Ramora.  He \ndoesn&#39;t \n&gt; know the defenses and I didn&#39;t make a list so there&#39;s nothing for \nhim to go \n&gt; on so he&#39;s kind of in the blue)\n&gt;  \n&gt; Vehement/Unicron/Sun Crusher/Reflector:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron didn&#39;t wait for the heathens he had fired upon to respond \nand blasted \n&gt; full speed for the Ramora and slightly smiled as scanners detected \nincoming \n&gt; objects.  He sent orders quickly two the two robots not under fire \nunder his \n&gt; command.  He raised an arm, launching off a missile on an intercept \ncourse \n&gt; with one of the missiles heading for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; The movement of his arm slightly tore open a badly damaged piece of \narmor \n&gt; that began trickling a light amount of green mech-fluid.  Unicron \nwas in \n&gt; pain, but didn&#39;t show it.  He knew it would affect his followers.  \nAfter all, \n&gt; what kind of god feels pain?  He was a foot from the shields and \ncould feel \n&gt; the intense heat, a square large enough to fit him (barely) in the \nshield \n&gt; opening up.  The ancient being passed through the hole, his \nfollowers in \n&gt; close pursuit.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Chaos-Bringer would&#39;ve sighed if he could.  He had not powered \nup since \n&gt; he had been revived and upgraded his loyal followers.  He had not \npowered up \n&gt; since he had taken possession of their bodies and aided Unitron in \nhis \n&gt; near-death experience.  He needed to rest, and the heathens \nwouldn&#39;t stop him.\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement had used his access codes to override Hell Beast and make \nthe \n&gt; relatively small hole in the shield, and Vehement knew that Hell \nBeast could \n&gt; not defeat the codes without extensive attempts to break a code \nbased on a \n&gt; long forgotten language that only existed in Brotherhood dogma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Three objects headed for him as he was a few feet from Unicron&#39;s \nfeet, firing \n&gt; off two optic blasts at two of the incoming plasma blasts.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher fired off a five rapid optic blasts in a streak, three \nheading \n&gt; for the last plasma blast, one for a missile, the other for another \nmissile.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector watched Unicron pass through the hole in the shield and \nVehement \n&gt; almost completely pass through the shield right behind the supposed \ndiety.  \n&gt; Raising his right wrist and launching two missiles from the double-\nbarreled \n&gt; cannon attached to that appendage, two energy-signature seeking \nmissiles \n&gt; streaked out and split into seperate directions, one heading for \nSupernova \n&gt; and the other Vcyir.\n\n\n"}}
