His transformation was \nquiet and smooth, more of a musical hiss than a multi-tone warble.\nHe hastily climbed into Domnijoe&#39;s cockpit and shut himself in. \nSeconds later Domnijoe was in the air widely circling Wildrider\nbefore \nshe took off after Cyclonus, engines roaring.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n************************************\n\n\n"}}
