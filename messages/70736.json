He was \n&gt; happy to see his comrade back on the mend.  And now he was never going to \n&gt; allow anything else to happen to him.  He takes his words into \n&gt; consideration with a nodd of compliance.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Understood Rodimus.  I will not underestimate Cyclonus by any means, but \n&gt; I will do my best to be sure that neither he or Hydras lays another \n&gt; harmful hand on any of the Maximals or Autobots ever again.  And this \n&gt; time, I&#39;m very happy to have the help.  I&#39;ll need it, I may be a Prime, \n&gt; but I know even the best of warriors can do with having good comrades on \n&gt; his side.  Legacy, I will be grateful for anything you can do to help \n&gt; Perceptor.  And if Perceptor is comfortable with the extensive repairs, by \n&gt; all means, do try, but if it doesn&#39;t work, I will also understand.  When I \n&gt; was last examined, I was also told that my damage may be far too extensive \n&gt; to repair by normal means.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then turns to Stanton.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Stanton, I have something for Nightlight.  I hope it will be enough to \n&gt; restore her.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He opens his chest and reveals his pulsating orb, which pulsates twice and \n&gt; forms a smaller version of itself.  The small orb of energy pulsates in \n&gt; time with his own.  He presents it to Stanton.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; This is what helped me to bring Rodimus back.  It&#39;s a power that feeds \n&gt; off of compassion, hope, understanding, and kindness.   The power of \n&gt; unity, and a simple force that we all possess to a level of degree.  It&#39;s \n&gt; what drew Rat Trap to find me, and what drew me to Talon and all of you. \n&gt; And now, I wish to extend this to Nightlight, in hopes that the compassion \n&gt; we all share, will be enough to help her through this difficult time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot smiles as her own heart spark beats within her chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Love is definitely something our enemy doesn&#39;t have.  And there&#39;s no \n&gt; other force greater than that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson turns his ear to Perceptor after hearing what Legacy had to say. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; He smiles.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I can see how you got your name. Highly perceptive of you. Thank you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Legacy, you&#39;ve shed a lot of light on many of my questions. Now that I \n&gt;&gt; &gt; know my lineage, it&#39;s time I lived up to it. First things first, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor and I could do with getting our sight back, and if you could \n&gt;&gt; &gt; do that I&#39;d greatly appreciate it, Stanton. Next, we have insectoids \n&gt;&gt; &gt; hiding beneath the Black Fortress tunnels, which have to be shown a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; lesson about tampering with what is not theirs. And Hydras last of all, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; could use a lesson in that as well. Nobody tampers with any Autobot and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; gets away with it. Especially when they tamper with a Prime.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy merely nodded, his single optic pulsing slightly as he accepted\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon&#39;s words.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;We can work on getting your sight back Tuscon.&quot; Santon said, his tone\n&gt;&gt; grave and serious, &quot;However I would need to run complete scans of\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor to know if it is possible to do so. For some the damage can\n&gt;&gt; be so extensive that it would require a complete cranial\n&gt;&gt; reconstruction to fix the problem.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He turns his head toward Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; They caused great harm to you Rodimus, and I&#39;ll see to it, with your \n&gt;&gt; &gt; help, that they get it back in return. If Optimus Prime could fend off \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Megatron, I&#39;m sure I can follow in his footsteps, and fend off the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; enemy at hand. Both Hydras and Cylconus need to be dealt with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; accordingly. Rodimus voiced an interest in dealing with Hydras and so \n&gt;&gt; &gt; do I. Two Primes against an evil leader is sure to topple even the most \n&gt;&gt; &gt; evil of warlords. But our war does not end with just us. If we&#39;re going \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to send those Decepticons and Predicons packing, we&#39;ll need every \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Autobot and Maximal we have in our ranks to pull this off. Lord Elder, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like you to contact Lord Perseus, and assemble a Maximal/ Autobot \n&gt;&gt; &gt; assembly. The more we get together, the stronger we&#39;ll be.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus was begining to look decidedly better as an intervenous tube\n&gt;&gt; of energon continued to feed him energon in small but steady amounts.\n&gt;&gt; He clutched his hand and then flexed it, smiling as he did so. &quot;Yes,\n&gt;&gt; we need to do some serious pest control.&quot; he said as he looked up at\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus rubbed his chest with his hand, &quot;Don&#39;t forget Cyclonus, like\n&gt;&gt; you has been rebuilt by the forces of the Matrix, do not underestimate\n&gt;&gt; his power.&quot; Rodimus frowned, &quot;I did, and it cost us so very much.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus clenched his fist again, &quot;But I am ready.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Talon smiled and said &quot;Then I will need the help of LEgacy and Santon.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus&quot;said the female &quot;I think that would bee good idea that you be \n&gt;&gt; &gt; there,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; if your health allows you&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor did a malicious grin &quot;An excursion to BlackFortress wont be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; necesary... cause the only copy of all my reseachs and reprogramation \n&gt;&gt; &gt; files\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are with me. Any rival scientist will use the fruits of my reseachs... \n&gt;&gt; &gt; With\n&gt;&gt; &gt; out my consent&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As the others talked Bump came in with Nightlight on the suspensor\n&gt;&gt; bed, she was still unconscious. A small deep beeping told anyone\n&gt;&gt; listening that she was in deep stassis.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy stepped over to the rear section of the room, away from the\n&gt;&gt; others and gestured for Bump to bring her over as he began to examine\n&gt;&gt; her. &quot;From our initial scans, it would appear she is nearly blank, no\n&gt;&gt; secondary modes or weapons, even her memory banks appear to be only\n&gt;&gt; slightly formed.&quot; Legacy continued to scan, &quot;However I am detecting\n&gt;&gt; residual memory entries that have not been completely deleted. I do\n&gt;&gt; not believe she cannot access them.&quot; He looked up at Tuscon, &quot;I can\n&gt;&gt; attempt to restore them.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
