Just as he gets back up\n&gt; he sees that Cyclonus had fired a missile of his own. Rodimus is\n&gt; quick to react and fires at it with his wrist mounted lasers. The\n&gt; rocket is still closer to Cyclonus then Rodimus.\n\nCyclonus is nearly as swift as Rodimus, and as he watched the Autobot\ntake a bead on the missile, he raised his hand as if to give a command\nbut the missile errupted a brilliant burst of fire, smoke and debris as\nRodimus&#39; blast hits it. Cyclonus is lifted from his feet and flung head\nof heels back towards the water. Even as he did this the sweeps above\nfluttered and shifted, yet never moving from thier position, Cyclonus&#39;\nword still holding them there. From his vantage point Scourge frowned\nas he folded his arms over his chest. \n\nCyclonus picked himself up and looked over at Rodimus, the Unicronian&#39;s\narmor is dented and the cracks that had confined themselves to his\nchest from his last attack were now spreading over his shoulders and\nhips. Despite the damage though Cyclonus&#39; humorless smile reappeared.\n&quot;Yes Rodimus, let that warrior out, it is he that I wish to vanquish in\nbattle.&quot; Cyclonus raised both arms, his left arm rising a bit slower,\nobviously the victim of battle damage, he opened his palms as vicious\npower ripped out through the air at Rodimus Prime!\n\nScourge&#39;s focus on the battle is distracted for a moment as he recived\na communication. He said something softly into his radio, and then\nreturned his focus to Cyclonus, a smug smile appearing on his\nfaceplate.\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
