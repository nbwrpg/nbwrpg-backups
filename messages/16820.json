It was Senator Hell Beast, the famos Beast Wars vetren, awarded \nmany times for bravery, heroics, and genius. Now he spoke of what to do about \nseveral problems caused by the war.\n    &quot;Friends, and fellow Predacons. We find ourselfs at a troubled time in \nthe Empire. Our borders are shrinking with Maximal attacks, and our treasury \ngrows smaller. I was sent to mine Energon, and I have. But, I find it has \nalready depleated. If we are to control Cybertron, and defeat the Maximals, \nwe have to stop the war on Earth. First I suggest we stop letting anybot with \na starship go into the past. And seconed I say we kill anyone who attempts \nit. Examples must be made.&quot; Hell Beast said with his vast diplomatic \nexpertise.\n    &quot;That is very good, Hell Beast, but what do you plan on doing about it? \nGoing to the planet to stop the war yourself?&quot; One member said who didnt like \nHell Beast at all.\n    &quot;That would be diff-&quot; He was cut off by another member, now standing and \nwaving his arms, &quot;Hell Beast should go! They respect him! And if he were to \neliminate Megatron while he was there, that would send waves of moral through \nout the empire! We would be great once more!&quot; \n    &quot;Now lets not get out of hand-&quot; Hell Beast was cut off agian because all \nthe members agreed. Hell Beast should go back to Earth to kill Megatron and \nstop the war.\n    &quot;You leave tommorow morning Hell Beast. You may take major Gremlin with \nyou, as back up. I think you should get packing.&quot;\n\n"}}
