Let&#39;s restart the RPG! It&#39;ll be really c=\r\nool. Maybe we&#39;ll actually have factions back if we restart it. No kidding. =\r\nI&#39;ve been thinking of this all last night. I have only evil characters. The=\r\ny have to attack some good guy characters. I make them attack Chivtrons. Wh=\r\ny is that!? There are no other factions. Basically, we have about 4 faction=\r\ns in the RPG, and none of them main factions, they&#39;re all side factions con=\r\nsisting of about 3 or 4 characters each. I don&#39;t know, I just think that&#39;s =\r\npathetic. But, however, I think that it&#39;s only natural that people get atta=\r\nched to some characters. I got pretty attached to my old character Deemos. =\r\nAnd now I&#39;m pretty attached to my first characters that I didn&#39;t make up, t=\r\nhe Insecticons. I used to have the idea, that with alot of characters, I ca=\r\nn make mine die all of the time and nobody would complain. I realized this =\r\nafter KSLawdogg complained on me, because I wouldn&#39;t make my character die =\r\nafter receiving a shot from his. I still think that it was utterly ridiculo=\r\nus, but in that he did teach me two things. One, he was really cheap, much =\r\nlike I used to be, honestly, and two, I needed to make my characters die so=\r\noner or later, this wasn&#39;t first season Beast Wars. So I took hundreds of c=\r\nharacters, ALMOST literally. They died here and there, but when I realized =\r\nthat most of them died at my character&#39;s hands, I realized that not alot of=\r\n people were RPing with me, so what was the point of the extra characters? =\r\nAnyway, I grew to love ALOT of my characters. I let them all die over time,=\r\n mostly except for Deemos, but I still wanted to do my part in letting my c=\r\nharacters die. But, with the rule of the character limit, it makes it a lit=\r\ntle hard for me. I like to have some characters be consistent, and unfortun=\r\nately, that rule kind of binds me to only having the characters that I don&#39;=\r\nt want to die. Yes, I have characters that I don&#39;t want to die. WHAT!? I ha=\r\nve characters that I don&#39;t want to die. WHAT!? I said I have characters tha=\r\nt I want to live. Anyway, my point is simple, I think. Or is it? Anyway, my=\r\n point is there, simple or not. People always get attached to a certain num=\r\nber of characters, especially under a certain limit. WHAT!? The limit. Howe=\r\nver, my OTHER point is. I think that the restart might be good for the RPG.=\r\n WHAT!? I think the restart is good. WHAT!?

The real\n  one. Another person p=\r\nosted that characters are not allowed to die\n  currently...he is utterly in=\r\ncorrect.\n\n  The problem is the role-playing 101 aspect. People are given th=\r\ne\n  responsibility to judge how much damage they take...however as we&#39;ve se=\r\nen\n  some can&#39;t role-play their way out of a wet paper bag let alone respon=\r\nsibly\n  judge how much damage their character takes. When a bot does get da=\r\nmaged\n  what typically happens here?\n\n  Here&#39;s the list:\n\n  1) The enemy bo=\r\nt suddenly becomes cockeyed unable to hit the broad side of a\n  barn even i=\r\nf he was a g1 and standing over it.\n\n  2) The bot never gives chase to his =\r\nprey. It always lets the long time\n  character slip away.\n\n  3) A short sta=\r\ny (a few hours usually) in the CR chamber and any damage is\n  completely go=\r\nne.\n\n  4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back as an enemy\n=\r\n  infiltrator.\n\n  5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone appears which after=\r\n various meeting\n  with colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; turns good again. Person=\r\nality reverts to\n  pre-evil clone.\n\n  6) Character &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as =\r\na more powerful offspring. Personality\n  is hardly different.\n\n  7) Charact=\r\ner &quot;dies&quot; but the players 6 other characters cart it&#39;s blasted\n  carcass ba=\r\nck to a lab where they resurrect him.\n\n  8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with n=\r\new bot same personality...eventually\n  people will forget you died and you =\r\ncan go back to your old form.\n\n  Since most will never let their &quot;favorite&quot;=\r\n character(s) die, I mean truly\n  die, never come back like, there&#39;s really=\r\n very little new plotlines you can\n  do with them without repeating rehashe=\r\nd already done ones. Take for example\n  the geotrons planing to attack the =\r\nnew cat faction....both factions will\n  survive, I doubt either player who =\r\ncontrols the majority of bots in either\n  faction is gonna let their charac=\r\nters get anywhere near killed.\n\n  And what&#39;s to stop this from happening if=\r\n a restart/sequel DOES occur? The\n  role-playing by some will still stink, =\r\ncharacters will still be incapable of\n  dying and given another year or so =\r\nall plotlines for THAT game will be\n  starting to repeat. While I still do =\r\nbelieve a restart/sequel is in order I\n  think the role-playing problem nee=\r\nds addressing first to stop a repeat of\n  what&#39;s happening to NBW.\n\n\n\n  ---=\r\n-- Original Message -----\n  From: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@...&gt;\n  To: &lt;nb=\r\nwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  Sent: Sunday, January 20, 2002 5:57 AM\n  Subject: A=\r\nll Read: Important\n\n\n  &gt; My appologies, Narrator, I actually missed your or=\r\niginal post.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I find that Neo Beast Wars has been dragged on for too=\r\n long, and the\n  &gt; world is becoming clogged with bases among other things.=\r\n Ideas are\n  &gt; becoming exausted, if not completely exausted already.

While I still do believe a restart/sequel is in \n  orde=\r\nr I&lt;BR&gt;think the role-playing problem needs addressing first to stop a \n  r=\r\nepeat of&lt;BR&gt;what&#39;s happening to NBW.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message =\r\n\n  -----&lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:x_rauq_x@...&quot;&gt;x=\r\n_rauq_x@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: \n  Sunday, January 20, 2002 =\r\n5:57 AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: All Read: \n  Important&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; My appologies, N=\r\narrator, I actually missed your \n  original post.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I find th=\r\nat Neo Beast Wars has been dragged on \n  for too long, and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; worl=\r\nd is becoming clogged with bases among other \n  things. Ideas are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; b=\r\necoming exausted, if not completely exausted \n  already. It seems to&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; me that we are almost delaying the end of the \n  rpg. If you&#39;ve created&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; one storyline that you like, is it not fair to \n  say that you can&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; create another better one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The idea \n  of creating a=\r\n sequel to the rpg is one that I would agree&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with. That \n  would re=\r\nquire several things to happen:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) Changing the name of the \n  RPG.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) Appropriate changes to the website.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3) A means to \n  st=\r\nore all of everyone&#39;s previous characters (don&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; know about everyon=\r\ne \n  else, but I don&#39;t want to lose the bio&#39;s of all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my \n  characte=\r\nrs).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4) New story (i have an idea, not necessarily for the \n  story=\r\n, but for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how we could create the story).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 5) A catalyst \n  =\r\nto start us all off (the story should provide that).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 6) Implementat=\r\nion \n  of new rules, some of which have been, and are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; being, discus=\r\nsed in the \n  login messageboard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 7) other stuff that could be writ=\r\nten if I wasn&#39;t \n  so tired.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; All in all, since there are mo=\r\nre people voting \n  anti-restart that I&#39;d&lt;BR&gt;&gt; anticpated, I&#39;ll ask ever=\r\nyone a perhaps fate \n  deciding question:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Would it be favou=\r\nrable to have a sequel \n  instead of a restart?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; --- In &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@y&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@y&lt;/A&gt;..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt=\r\n;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:airly2000@y&quot;&gt;airly2000@y&lt;/A&gt;...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; I&#39;m agree \n  with Soulstice, restart isn&#39;t good idea.

Not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; am I seemingly not too much an=\r\n important part of this RPG, \n  despite&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the general current la=\r\nck of members, and the fact that \n  I&#39;ve been&lt;BR&gt;&gt; here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for=\r\n getting close to 2 years, but also I \n  am not involved in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; restart. I have very few characters. \n  Characters that, if the RPG&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; restarted, will still be \n  together (Insecticons, spec=\r\nifically), and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; therefore it wouldn&#39;t \n  harm me to vote yes. H=\r\nowever, I don&#39;t think&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; could vote \n  yes, because I a=\r\nm apposed to restarting the RPG. I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; decided \n  to vote no.=\r\n It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me to end the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; saga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; o=\r\nf Neo Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked hard over&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  =\r\nthe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; years to keep going. I don&#39;t think that we could suddenly =\r\n\n  pretend&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; never happened, I think it&#39;s impossible.=\r\n Maybe \n  if we ended it and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; started the sequel, I wouldn&#39;t mi=\r\nnd so much, \n  but otherwise, my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vote&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is no.
