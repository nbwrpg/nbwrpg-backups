Still, \nthe outcome of this battle would likely depend a lot on what \nSwitchblade found in those odd containers which had been found in \nthe storage bay. The strage artifacts made Megatron wonder what the \nMaximals knew about them, and whether they knew that the Predacons \nhad them.\n\nReady to go, Megatron jumps to his feet, and hops onto the top of \nthe Pred base. He picks out Tyrael, and begins to run at the Tripred \nleader. He begins his assault with two plasma blasts and a rocket, \nwhile his qickly prepares to draw his energon axe if it comes down \nto close range fighting, which may be preferable for Megatron right \nnow.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nSwitchblade opens the final container, having defeated the traps \nthat the Maximals had put in place. As he lifted the cover of the \ncontainer, he noticed a glow eminating from the container, and also \nfrom the three pieces that he&#39;d already collected. They seemed to be \nresonating from each others presence, almost like they were talking.\n\nHe picked up the one in the container and then put it down beside \nthe other three. &quot;Megatron.&quot; Switchblade says after opening a comm \nto the Pred leader, &quot;I&#39;ve got some interesting goods, look kinda \nlike artifacts, I wonder if this is some new Maximal technology or \nsomething, or maybe they just stumbled across them, heh.&quot;\n\nHe picks up two of them and eyes them for a bit, &quot;I think that they \nmay fit together somehow, so I&#39;m going to mess around with em.&quot;\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nA frown flashes across Megatron&#39;s impassive face as he understands \nthat he&#39;s relying on Switchblade to get something going, &quot;Do it \nthen.&quot; He says as he continues at Tyrael.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nSwitchblade smiles, &quot;Gotcha.&quot; He closes the comm. &lt;Now lets see what \nI can pull out of the bag.&quot;\n\nHe looks closely at the two and realizes that the pieces don&#39;t quite \nlook like they would go together, but... but his hands move without \nhis logic chips giving them signals. His hands seem to press some \npress some spots on the partial cubes, and the two pieces slide \ntogether like a well oiled knee joint. \n\nStill not entirely in control of his actions, he picks up the other \ntwo pieces, and repeats the process a few more times, effectively \nputting together the framework cube together, without knowing how.\n\n&lt;Well.&gt; he thinks to himself, &lt;That worked out well, just wish i \nknew what happened.&gt; Time to see what this thing could do, but he \nneeded to do a few repairs first of all, being caught by the first \nexplosing didn&#39;t help his functionality at all.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
