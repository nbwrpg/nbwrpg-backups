She could herself scream. \nbut not feeling the air come out of her mouth or lungs.  She was \npulled for what seamed an eternity.  She saw lights and colors fly \npast her as she was falling downward.  She felt something enfold her \nand surround her.  It felt heavy and cold.  She wondered if she was \nsent to the inferno.  She couldn&#39;t move.  She felt like she was \nsufficating, and couldn&#39;t breath.  She screamed but couldn&#39;t hear \nherself scream.  She tried to breath again.  Still she couldn&#39;t draw \na breath.  She felt energy pulse through her. It surged and she felt \na wave of heat cover her. She tried to breath again, only this time, \nshe felt her lungs fill with air.  She could feel the air pass in \nthrough her mouth and into her lungs. She felt cold benieth her.  She \nenvisioned a table. She was laying on a table.  She could hear \nnoises. It was like being brought on line for the first time. The \nenergy pulsed through her and if felt hot running through her body.  \nShe heard the noise of someone talking. But couldn&#39;t make out the \nwords.  She tried to open her eyes, but the remained shut.  Then she \nheard a loud pounting sound, like thunder in her ears.  It was her \nspark, it was beating and pulsing with the energy that surged through \nher.  The thunder filled her ears and almost drowned her other senses.\nShe could barely hear anything else.  She felt another surge of \nenergy and her body began to shake.  Her body shook and shivered.  \nShe then opened her eyes.  She was in a lab.  Tubes hooked into her \nbody.  She saw the room around her moving and spinning.  She tried to \ncall out, but couldn&#39;t.  As her lungs again filled with air, she \ntried to speak again. She couldn&#39;t yet. She closed her eyes and let \nher body shake as the energy filled and pulsed into and through her.\n\n\n"}}
