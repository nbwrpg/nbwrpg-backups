You startled me. I&#39;m fine.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;She looked at the ground for a moment and then to her wing.\n&gt;&quot;well, on second thought, I could do with a bit of repair work.  I seamed \n&gt;to have damaged my left wing.&quot;\n\n&gt;----------------Original Message-------------\n&gt;From:   &lt;Dachande85@a...&gt;\n&gt;Date: Tue Jun 27, 2000 4:53pm\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;::CyberShark::\n&gt;\n&gt;    Floating outside the fight he saw a very large bat fly and land in a\n&gt;tree. He decided to go in to investigate. Lowering himself to greet this \n&gt;bat.\n&gt;He scanned the trees to see exactly where it landed. The only reason he was\n&gt;so interested was that it was defintly a strange mix of colors for a bat.\n&gt;Which meant Robot in Disguise. The scanners picked up it&#39;s signal and it\n&gt;turned out to be Predacon.\n&gt;    &quot;Hey, are you all right? What&#39;s the matter?&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
