He then back at Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So you chose to continue.  Good, this time try to refrain from making snide\n&gt; comments.  AND HYDRAS, IF YOU SO MUCH AS TURN ON ANY OF US THIS ALLIANCE IS\n&gt; OVER!  AM I UNDERSTOOD!?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gives him a serious glare.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFor a moment RODIMUS just stopped as TUSCON spoke and then turned and\nlooked at him, his face a soldier&#39;s face. &quot;We will talk later.&quot; And\nthen he turned back to continue on his path, shifting into his\nvehicular mode as he moved.\n\nAbove him CYCLONUS floated, a large jet, his wings positioned for\natmospheric flight. &quot;If it means anything you were not given a\nwarrior&#39;s chance in battle.&quot; CYCLONUS said quietly to RODIMUS, &quot;That\nwas wrong. If we fight, it will not be from a stab in the back or a\nreprogramming, it will be machine to machine weapon to weapon.&quot;\n\nThere was a grunt from RODIMUS, &quot;You know Cyclonus, I almost look\nfoward to that.&quot;\n\nThe two drove on, trying to find a way for mortal enemies to work together.\n&gt; &lt;OLD &lt;Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; STAND BY ALL SOLDIERS!  DEPLOYING SONAR ATTACK AT FULL STRENGTH!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With a deep breath, Tucson rattles the horizon with a sensor splitting sonic\n&gt; inhibited roar.  A wave of sonar energy is cast from his throat and powerful\n&gt; vocalizers.  Sharp teeth and fangs glimmer in the moonlight as a strong\n&gt; silver tail thrashes the ground beneath his four feet.\n\nAs TUSCON&#39;s warning is heard the Predacons shift their audio circuits\noff as they glance back at at the large dragon.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;RRROOOAAARRR!!!&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nTUSCON&#39;s roar can be heard for hundreds of miles as the sound of it\nechoes and re-echoes out across the miles and miles of dead dinosaurs.\nOne of the first things he reailzes is that although capable of large\namounts of damage, It is rougher and cruder in its sensory mode, but\ncapable of far more damage then he could once deliver before.\n\nIt is almost like a wind has picked up and blown some of the bodies\nback. Dinosaurs that are caught in the cone of effect are broken and\ntossed about, bones vibrating and then snapped as if hit by a tidal\nwave, although instead of one of water, this one is made of sound.\n\nNo, it was not the same as his original sonar, but it was very effective indeed!\n\nAround TUSCON the Predacons, as well as probrably the Maximals leaped\nout of the way as the cones sweeps through. At high enough levels\nsound can do actual physical damage and not just bust ear drums and\nover load audio circuits.\n\nAs the roar dies down, the damage that is done is incredible and\nTUSCON&#39;s energy cells are slowly trying to recharge themselves from\nsuch a high energy output (OOC: He has to catch his breath). Across\nthe sensors there is no evidence of anyone being affected beyond the\ndead dinosaurs and the movement of TUSCON&#39;s allies.\n\nAs far as anyone could tell either their enemy was out of range of\nTUSCON&#39;s roar or was protected by them in some manner.\n\n&quot;That was interesting.&quot; SKY SHADOW said from his position next to\nHYDRAS as he shrugged his shoulders.\n\n&quot;And loud!&quot; INJECTOR said as he buzzed near by. He was in beast mode\nlooking like a strange cross of lionfish and hornet.\n\nCYCLONUS and RODIMUS continued up towards the path of devastation left\nby the dinosaurs, RODIMUS weaving between the bodies in vehicle mode\nwhile CYCLONUS just flew above them as a jet.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
