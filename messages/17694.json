Remembered \nhow he had saved her life, now it was time to repay the favor.  She \nstood in front of him, watching the rockets home in.  Both hit her in \nher side and she was flung over Ramulus and several yards away from \nhim.  She layed on her side, lots of wires were exposed.  She groaned \nand stood up slowly on all fours. She glares at Striker and fired \nboth optic lazars at him.  She then started to jog over to Ramulus, \nstill firing on Striker. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Ramulus/Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; SnowCat&#39;s tackle takes Slayer off of Ramulus, the Maximal jumping \nup \n&gt; as Slayer regains his balance.
