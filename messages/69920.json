Rat Trap looks up at the sky, and notices the min=\r\nions hanging about, yet he does not make any moves against them.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ll su=\r\nre be glad when we get these creeps off our backs.&quot;\n\nQuick Stride plucks at=\r\n a few blades of grass and swallows a mouth full.\n\n&quot; I hear ya.&quot;\n\nWhile eat=\r\ning he spots a pair of headlights, and a sizeable silver truck, with black =\r\nbumpers, looking a lot like the Autobot he had just helped to rescue recent=\r\nly.  He nudges Rat Trap.\n\n&quot;What? What is it?&quot;\n\nQuick Stride points to the t=\r\nruck with his nose.\n\n&quot; Over there, coming toward us. That truck, it looks f=\r\namilliar.&quot;\n\nRat Trap spots Tucson Prime heading toward them.  His little ja=\r\nw drops.\n\n&quot; Holy Primus, I was right!  I was right! Hah, it&#39;s Wheels!  And =\r\nwow!  Has he changed!&quot;\n\nQuick Stride and Rat Trap get into their robot mode=\r\ns and jump around happilly.  Tucson Prime sees their reception while approa=\r\nching.  As he gets close enough to them he transforms into robot mode and l=\r\nooks to them.  Rat Trap walks up to him with a smile and tears actually wel=\r\nling up in his eyes.\n\n&quot; Wow, look at ya.  Ya sure made a change for the bes=\r\nt.. Er, Tucson Prime.&quot;\n\nTucson smiles.\n\n&quot;I like the other name better.&quot;\n\nRa=\r\nt Trap looks up.\n\n&quot;Um, Tucson?&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles.\n\n&quot;No, the other one.&quot;\n\nRa=\r\nt Trap smiles.\n\n&quot;Wheels?&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;Yeah, that one.&quot;\n\nRat Trap quick=\r\nly goes up to his friend, as they exchange an embrace.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s great ta see =\r\nya again Wheels.  And contrats on your promotion.&quot;\n\nTucson&#39;s expression doe=\r\ns not change.  His smile as gentile as that of a common Autobot.\n\n&quot;Thank yo=\r\nu.  First I have to live up to my new status.  And I wouldn&#39;t have been abl=\r\ne to do that if you hadn&#39;t rescued me like you did.&quot;\n\nRat Trap was in his g=\r\nlory.\n\n&quot;Aww, what are friends for?  Okay, so, what brings ya here?  And, yo=\r\nu&#39;re lookn&#39; ta me now..&quot;\n\nTucson kneels down to Rat Trap.\n\n&quot; First, When I =\r\ngot transformed, the energy managed to repair the damage to my optics.  Sec=\r\nond, I came here to talk to Nightstrike.&quot;\n\nRat Trap points to the base.\n\n&quot;O=\r\nh, um, ya better check in with the guys in the base first.  Although, it&#39;s =\r\nkinda obivous that you&#39;re one of us..  More so now.&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles again=\r\n, and walks up toward the base.\n\n&quot; Legacy, this is Tucson Prime reporting b=\r\nack to the Maximal Base.  I wish to talk to Nightstrike, if at all possible=\r\n. Please inform Lord Perseus of my pressense, it&#39;s important that I convers=\r\ne with him also.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Ah, Marauder could be detecting Talon, but it seems like she=\r\n should\n&gt; have a Maximal signature now.
