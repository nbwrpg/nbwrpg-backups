One of them is\nan\n&gt; &gt; owl, and the other is a lion that is part of Magnaboss. This Prowl is\nthe\n&gt; &gt; owl, but he has a fairly strange history, probably different from the\n&gt; toy&#39;s,\n&gt; &gt; and I&#39;d doupt he and Bluestreak could possible be brothers, but IM me if\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; have any comments.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Prowl/Striker::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prowl looks at Iron Raptor, as she places her hand on his arm. &quot;Actually\nI\n&gt; &gt; have no idea what I&#39;m doing. You&#39;re third in command, I was hoping you&#39;d\n&gt; take\n&gt; &gt; over from here,&quot; he says, feeling slightly stupid. He turns to Rhinox,\nnot\n&gt; &gt; hearing the sleepy murmurings from Cyber Claw.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I have read about you in data logs back on Cybertron. There are plenty\nof\n&gt; us\n&gt; &gt; here, but they havn&#39;t got here yet.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At that point, Striker walks into the room, nearly crashing into Cyber\n&gt; Claw\n&gt; &gt; in the proccess.
