His livid \nexpression resulted not only in the fact that he knew he would die, \nbut on the disappointment of having killed no one before dying. Yet, \nhe managed to take out his laser cannon and arm his multi-explosives. \nHe unloaded everything he had at Shadow Star.\n\nWhile all this happens, Tyrael jumps swiftly upwards, avoiding the \nrocket and one of the blasts, but taking the last blast fully in the \nleg. He darted on the Predacon leader, shooting eigth shards at him \nand swooping with both talons directed at his enemy&#39;s massive chest.\n\nTyrael: My place was granted to me as a reward for my competence! Not \ntaken by giga-cycles of backstabbing! And besides, the very fact that \nyou failed the first time you came to Earth proves that you are \nunworthy of leading anyone!\n\nA laser shot from his second in command told him he was not the only \none to relish the glory of killing the renegade.\n\nTyrael: Shadow Star! Stop at once, or I will court-martial you for \nhigh treason and mutiny!\n\nAway from that scene, the ground shook where Inferno was standing...\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; While Megatron and Tyreal can&#39;t take their eyes off\n&gt; each other SS runs quietly towards Megatron and\n&gt; attempts to grab him from behind and hold his wrist\n&gt; weapon up to his neck\n&gt; \n&gt; SS:  And you&#39;re both going to learn why I&#39;ll live a\n&gt; lot longer than either of you.\n&gt; \n&gt; He fires a laser.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- x_rauq_x &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; -- Megatron / Switchblade --\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron grins easily as the Tripred leader\n&gt; &gt; addresses him, &quot;Somebody \n&gt; &gt; is thinking above thier position in the universe.\n&gt; &gt; Too bad you won&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; live long enough to learn why I only need 1 name,\n&gt; &gt; Megatron.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron hops backwards off of the ship, and onto\n&gt; &gt; the wing on that \n&gt; &gt; side it as the light bolts spray over his last\n&gt; &gt; position. He ducks, \n&gt; &gt; and prepares for his attack, fully aware that he was\n&gt; &gt; still damaged \n&gt; &gt; from the previous battle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His weapons armed, he pops up from the wing, and\n&gt; &gt; fires two plasma \n&gt; &gt; blasts and a rocket at Tryrael. Then he prepares to\n&gt; &gt; change location.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Switchblade.&quot; Megatron says through a comm, &quot;Found\n&gt; &gt; anything yet?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade grimaces then replies, &quot;Uhh, I found\n&gt; &gt; something in a \n&gt; &gt; box... it was trapped with an older model false\n&gt; &gt; top/explode-in-your-\n&gt; &gt; face style trap. I managed to disarm it... the hard\n&gt; &gt; way, and I&#39;m a \n&gt; &gt; bit damaged now. There appears to be a piece of...\n&gt; &gt; something anyway.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade picks up the artifact, and takes a\n&gt; &gt; closer look at \n&gt; &gt; it. &quot;Hmm, it almost looks like a small cube, which\n&gt; &gt; is the corner of \n&gt; &gt; a larger cube of some sort. There also appears to be\n&gt; &gt; writing on it, \n&gt; &gt; possibly Vok, but I can&#39;t tell. There are also three\n&gt; &gt; small \n&gt; &gt; miscoloured squares in the center of three of the\n&gt; &gt; sides of it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He takes a look around the room, and spots three\n&gt; &gt; more sealed \n&gt; &gt; containers, identical to the one he&#39;d grabbed the\n&gt; &gt; oddly shaped cube \n&gt; &gt; out of.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hold on, I&#39;m checking out three more containers\n&gt; &gt; which are seemingly \n&gt; &gt; identical to the one which had this.. thing in it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Mumbles \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade into the comm and he heads over to the\n&gt; &gt; next sealed \n&gt; &gt; container, his intrest smothering the pain of his\n&gt; &gt; damages, and also \n&gt; &gt; the fact that Megatron was in the middle of a\n&gt; &gt; battle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tyrael: I see you have come Megatron. Now come.\n&gt; &gt; You will learn why \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they call me the Blue Firestorm!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He showered his enemy with a rain of light bolts,\n&gt; &gt; no bigger than \n&gt; &gt; &gt; needles.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\n&gt; http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n\n"}}
