He was lucky he hadn&#39;t\nbeen kicked out. But he had no choice but to kill his opponent, if he\nhadn&#39;t, he would be dead now. He wondered about his next match. Would he\nsee Epyon?\n\n::Epyon::\n\nHe stood prepared for his next battle. He knew not to expect the ease he\nfound in his last match, but he was ready.\n\n(KSL, this free for all, do all of the round 1 winners just go at it?\nAnd will you officialy start it?)\n\n::DrillBit/KitKat2::\n\nThey both watched as the drones worked at extracting Foxfingers spark.\nDrillBit chuckled and KitKat had an evil smile on her face.\n\n(I might have missed the post but I dont remember a reply on this\nearlier Cyberwolf. Could you either post or repost on this? Thanks.)\n\n::Skyburst::\n\nHe finally arrived at Autobot HQ, although a little ahead of his escort.\nHe opened a comm link.\n&quot;This is the Autobot Skyburst, I have arrived. Could you please let me\nin?&quot;\n\n::Prowl::\n\nHe walked around Maximal City. He missed Iron Raptor, and wished she\nwould return. He was also thinking about his new position as Maximal\nCommander.\n\n(I dont know what Prowl was doing last, so I&#39;m starting off like that.\nAlso I need to know what the majority of Maximals are doing and what is\nhappaning at Maximal City. With my other Maxi&#39;s at IGL I had not been\nfollowing that.)\n\n"}}
