In the midst of \nthe fight \n&gt; one of the masquitos landed on apocalypse. Suked out some of his \ndna and flew \n&gt; off. It would be only felt as a masquito bite. Another landed on \nkillfest. \n&gt; Biting into him. So small doubt it could be felt. The two masqutios \nflew off \n&gt; back to the spot of thier master. Another masquito landed on the \nback of \n&gt; Zardus. Took a small sample and flew off quickly. To short of time \nfor most \n&gt; bots to tell. Another masquito landed on the back of  Dark Mouse. \nTakeing its \n&gt; sample and flying off. It would only  be known as a bothering \ninsect.   One \n&gt; more insect flew and landed on top of the bot known as cerberus. It \nhad used \n&gt; its digging abilitys though small to dig a minature hole under the \nshields. \n&gt; So small doubtful that a autogun would target a small creature. It \ntook its \n&gt; sample and left. The bots headed to thier new home. The two bots \nthey needed \n&gt; last would be obtained later. For now this would be enough to start \nthier \n&gt; master&#39;s first evolution.\n\n\n"}}
