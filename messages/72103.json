He&#39;s knocked off his feet which quickly triggers a flight\n&gt; response as he stumbles, crashes to the ground, and in a clumsy manner\n&gt; transforms back into his beast mode with a sizable gash on his back.\n&gt; Battery fluid leaks steadily down his back but he was still lucky enough he\n&gt; had his legs and his wings.  So even though he hated to do it, he bounds off\n&gt; hoping to get them off his back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; There has to be a way to get them off my back.  And who the pit made them\n&gt; that way?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs soon as TUSON began to run GRIMLOCK was on him as were the others\nof his team, like ravenous wolves downing a weakned prey! Swinging\naround they paused as if to sniff the air as if smelling someing odd,\nwhen a burst of some sort of energy went off. The energy was not\ndestructive in nature but something strange and different, and with it\nit seemed as if something had changed or shifted.\n\nGRIMLOCK paused, &quot;Where is he?&quot; he growled. &quot;I don&#39;t see him!&quot;\n\nSNARL and SLUDGE began to look around.\n\n&quot;I see his trail.&quot; SLAG said as he looked at the ground trying to\ntrace out the trail of lubricant, &quot;but something is confusing it!&quot;\nSLAG growled in rage!\n\nThere is a voice at TUSCON&#39;s ear, &quot;Stop moving if you want to live.&quot;\nIt was not a voice he recognized.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
