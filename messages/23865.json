He had his \nstealth \n&gt; &gt; mode on, so there was no possible way he could be detected, \nunless \n&gt; &gt; one saw the slight indents his hooves made on the ground.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His body was like one of a cenataur, yet slightly different. He \nhad \n&gt; &gt; horse legs and body, but where the horse chest would be was a \n&gt; &gt; slightly human torso, with strong looking arms and chest. His \nface \n&gt; &gt; had no mouth, just a nose, pointed ears, and two black almond \neyes. \n&gt; &gt; Atop his head sat two stalk eyes which could twist in any \n&gt; direction. \n&gt; &gt; Where the horse tail would be, was a 2 meters long tail, with a \n&gt; &gt; scythe like blade, wickedly sharp and coated with poison, on the \n&gt; end.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The stalk eyes swiveled slowly as he watched the battle, deciding \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; attakers were indeed stronger, but the defenders had the heart in \n&gt; &gt; them. He sniggered. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For now, he would be content to watch. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His Stasis Pod had crashed not too far away from here, but since \n&gt; &gt; everybot was so consumed in this battle, he had snuck out and \n&gt; &gt; discovered the new world on his own.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With a curious cock of his head, he noted neither faction seemed \nto \n&gt; &gt; have any leader. They were both disorganised, frantically firing \nin \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; fight to save their lives, no control whatsoever. With simple \n&gt; &gt; planning, the Attackers would win easily.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As he watched, he occasionally heard words being called out. \nNames, \n&gt; &gt; obviously. He didn&#39;t have a name. Staring into the night sky with \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; stalk eyes, but keeping his main eyes on the battle, a whisper \n&gt; &gt; floated into his head.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Diabo..&#39; It said. He would have smiled, if he had a mouth. A \n&gt; perfect \n&gt; &gt; name. A name that protrayed his personality. A name that his \nleader \n&gt; &gt; had used once.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (OOC: Diabo actually means Devil.. or Evil Soul in Spanish.., \nI&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; send in a Profile soon)\n\n\n"}}
