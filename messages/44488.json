He plummets downward at an alarming rate. At about 7000 \nfeet, as he nears 333 meters per second, he pulls up, causing a \nsonic boom to emminate around the surrounding area. Breaking, he \nlevels off near ground level. He quickly transforms into train mode, \nand lands on the ground, continuing onward. He matches speed with \nSpasstik, and his side door slides open. &quot;Spasstik, in, NOW.&quot; He \ncontinues to match speed with Spasstik, but he won&#39;t be able to for \nlong.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Spasstik&#39;s metalic paws continued to beat against the African soil \nas he\n&gt; moved further and further away from the battle scene, with the \nvaluable\n&gt; welker rifle in his maw. Rasor sharp claws propelled him forward,\n&gt; tearing up the earth, as herds of animals scattered to make room \nfor the\n&gt; larger than normal wolf. He was almost at the edge of the \ncontinent,\n&gt; where he was to rendezvous with Astrotain, and hopefully he would \nshow\n&gt; up, for lack of flight could keep him grounded on this rock.\n\n\n"}}
