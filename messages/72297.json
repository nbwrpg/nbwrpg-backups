Once we venture an=\r\ny closer all communications are blocked.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nVICE GRIP listened ove=\r\nr to the communication, pausing, &quot;What do we know about this..  Leo Prime, =\r\nI believe he identiifed himself as?  What are his capabilities?&quot;\n\nAt the ve=\r\nry least, they already had more to go on than they had previously - they kn=\r\new the name of the Prime.\n\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHADOW was listening to the con=\r\nversation, his optics glued to each\n&gt; one as they spoke =96 HYDRAS, FRACTYL=\r\n and LEO PRIME.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This new Prime is less predicatble.&quot; SKYSHADOW nodded=\r\n in agreement.\n&gt; &quot;But I am curious as to why is seeking to ally with us. Wh=\r\nere is\n&gt; Tuscon, the one had attempted to forge this alliance in the first\n=\r\n&gt; place?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDINOBOT nodded, &quot;Of course.  We should send an esco=\r\nrt along with HYDRAS for the neogtiations.  But we should hold the majorit =\r\nof our forces back.&quot;  Pausing.  &quot;And I would assume that the reason this se=\r\ncond Prime has taken over the negotiations, given he mentioned a very large=\r\n jamming zone, is that TUSCON and perhaps part of the MAXIMAL forces are lo=\r\nst within the area or otherwise engaged in missions there.&quot;\n\nGlancing over,=\r\n &quot;What group of us will be escorting HYDRAS, what will be remaining at base=\r\n, and what will be going out on a salvage mission with Cryotek or watching =\r\nTarantalus here?&quot;\n\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; &quot;Some how I get the impression that there are=\r\n assets and there are\n&gt; assets.&quot; CRYOTEK said with the ghost of a smile, &quot;A=\r\nnd I wonder how\n&gt; much sharing you have in mind?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite his conversa=\r\ntion with BLACKARACNIA he was paying close\n&gt; attention to the conversation =\r\nthat was in progress.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBLACKARACHNIA gave a small wink to CRYOTEK=\r\n, &quot;Oh, please.  Assets are a munitions bunker, or an information network.  =\r\nNow these..&quot;  Stroking her foreclaw over her torso plating, &quot;Are another re=\r\nalm entirely.&quot;  Teasing.\n\nStill paying close attention to the conversation =\r\nand updating TARANTALUS.\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a quiet chuckle from TAR=\r\nANTULUS, &quot;Some I knew and some I\n&gt; suspected.&quot; He said cryptically, never o=\r\nne to lay all the cards on the\n&gt; table. &quot;This is part of the reason you&#39;re =\r\nup there. To see what Hydras\n&gt; has in his small little processor.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW=\r\n&gt;\n\nThere was a shiver along the cerebral link from BLACKARACHNIA, and a qui=\r\net nod, &quot;As you wish.  Do you wish me to further interact with him or to pr=\r\nioritize myself upon CRYOTEK for now?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
