His optic sensors adjusted to the darkness of the bunker, and \nsaw Black Arachnia lying by him. He grinned and slid closer to her. \nHe rested his head on her shoulder, thinking things were going to be \nfine. If she was in a good mood enough to do what she did a few hours \nago, things were going to turn out just fine. \n\nHe watched as she slept and leaned up, kissing her forehead. He laid \nhis head back on her shoulder. He wanted to stay by her until she \nwoke. He looked down her body then put his cobra arm over her chest.\n\nWhile lying still, he got hungry. He glowered a little. He would have \nto wait.\n\n\n"}}
