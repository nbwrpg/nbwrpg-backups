The others will be shorter, promise.)\n\n\n\nHysteria/Tavatron\n\nHysteria stopped mid-step and raised her arms slightly, showing that she \nmeant no harm. After Chordate lowered his weapon she breathed a sigh of \nrelief. She didn�t feel like getting shot at point-blank range. Hysteria \ntook a seat at the other console and tapped out a few commands. A diagram of \nthe ship came into view on the cracked screen:\n\n&quot;Is there any power left in the main weapons that could be rerouted to the \nshields?&quot;\n\nHysteria braced herself as the CF shook, but soon settled down again. She \nchuckled softly, though on her face was a look of intense concentration:\n\n&quot;I blame on the lack of off-world contact-- What the slag�?&quot;\n\nSo, now they had a gestalt. Things were starting to look up. The again�\n\n&quot;The automated defenses within the ship appear to be functioning, but \nthere�s no guarantee they�ll last long enough to stop the intruder.&quot;\n\nHysteria turned her chair around so she was facing Chordate. He didn�t look \ntoo good, but neither did she. Her armor was cracked and leaking and \nmech-fluid was caked over a cut beneath her right optic:\n\n&quot;D&#39;you think I should try to intercept him?&quot;\n\n*****\n\nTavatron watched Scattershot fly up high and nearly out of sight. She didn�t \nhave time for this. He was insane, no matter what she did he probably \nwouldn�t care. She turned her attention to Dark Wolf after charging her \nstaff for several moments. It was whining from the near overload state, put \nmanaged to miraculously hold itself together. She sent two extremely \npowerful sickle shaped blasts at Dark Wolf. The first blast was vertical and \nimmediately followed by a horizontal one.
