Perhaps he could discover the whereabouts of Dark Prime...\n\nHowever, it was not the Dark One&#39;s spark he felt, but that of a\nfellow. He quickly turned around and transformed to jet mode. It was\nhis fastest mode and it could allow the confused spark to live a\nlittle longer if it was in danger.\n\nAfter some cycles of flight, he figured he was near the spark&#39;s\nposition. He transformed to dragon mode and a cloud of frost shot out\nfrom his armor plates. He looked around, but saw no one.\n\nAzureBlade: Hello? Is there anyone here?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt; Maxima explored the land that she came to. So perfect, prestine,\nfull of \n&gt; life... it was odd. But at the moment, nothing seemed to matter or\nmake sense. She \n&gt; was just... here. Her whole existance seemed to be in limbo, her memory \n&gt; currently short circuited, ... in otherwords.. she had amnesia. She\ncouldn&#39;t \n&gt; remember a thing. however, ... she could feel. She felt tired &\nweak. Also, feeling \n&gt; that a part of her was sad & aching for something. Unsure what it was. \n&gt; \n&gt; As she strode along, coming to a clearing where her optics beheld a\nwaterfall \n&gt; & a lagoon. Cocking her head to the side, she gazed at it curiously.\nThen \n&gt; moved up to it. As she looked into it, it showed her then as the\nbreeze moved \n&gt; across it it showed her a different reflection. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Whaaa!&quot; Jumping back. Stunned for a moment. Then leaning back over the \n&gt; waters to see her reflection of her battered body. Seeing it she\nfelt the dull \n&gt; aches & pains. What were they from?   \n&gt; \n&gt; -Leave this place! A familiar voice echoed. Tell Rodimus I will\nspeak with \n&gt; him-  the voice again echoed.\n&gt; \n&gt; She gazed at the waterfall, as the roar of the water hypnotized her.\nRodimus, \n&gt; the name was ... familiar to her. But.. how? Who was he? How did she\nknow \n&gt; this... Rodimus? \n&gt; \n&gt; She knelt at the water&#39;s edge, leaned over the waters again, her\nface up to \n&gt; the water&#39;s surface. The water though, seemed to sparkle as a breeze\nwashed \n&gt; over it again. She then took a taste. It wasn&#39;t just water.. it\nwas... energy! \n&gt; The energy surged through her reviving her. She smiled as she\nslipped into the \n&gt; water. enveloping her, causing energy to surge through her.... & to\nthe Matrix \n&gt; within her. Swimming in it&#39;s waters, memories rushed to her, visions\nof the \n&gt; past, faces of bots she had cared deeply for, had given her loyalty to: \n&gt; Soundwave, Thundercracker, Skywarp, Nightbird, Scream, Solaris.. so\nmany faces... then \n&gt; another who she remembered, Gamma, her mentor... & .. another whom\nshe cared \n&gt; so deeply for... Megatron... visions of him,... Cybertron.. the\nArk... the \n&gt; Heart of Cybertron.. the Matrix of Leadership.. Unicron... Quints...\nGolden \n&gt; Age... everything was so fast, she barely recognized it. \n&gt; \n&gt; The past memories then mixed with the present.. of a lion, a battle\nwith a \n&gt; orange/red car, of a face of a fembot, a group of Decepticons...\nthen.. of a \n&gt; kiss. A face... My sweet tigress, it echoed... \n&gt; \n&gt; Then the present gave way to the future, with Cybertron... few of\neither \n&gt; side.. a battle with Flarea, daughter of Optimus Prime & Elita -1...\nof a battle \n&gt; for Leadership... then her holding a Matrix releasing the power as\nthe light \n&gt; flooded her. \n&gt; \n&gt; She stiffened in the water as light enveloped her. \n&gt; \n&gt; Shooting to the surface, she nearly shot out of the waters as her\nfeathery \n&gt; mane flung back in a fantastic, erotic display. Her crimson optics\nglowed. As \n&gt; she then bobbed & all calmed down. The visions confused her.. but\nthey will be \n&gt; answered in time. \n&gt; \n&gt; Making her way to the waterfall, she then stood under it. The water\nshimmered \n&gt; with her form as the golden sun washed over her like the water.\n\n\n"}}
