THis is one of several ideas that may appear an=\r\nd all will be welcome to be heard. Also, it was suggested to change the nam=\r\ne to Neo Beast War, New Age; but other titles will be considered too. \n\nHer=\r\ne&#39;s what Azure has wrote.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n\nNeo Beast Wars: New Age\n\n \n\nHistorical F=\r\nacts\n\n \n\n  After Unicron left the periphery of the system, he left several =\r\nsleeping Minions on the moon. He had realized that the energon present on E=\r\narth was too powerful for him to absorb right away, and had decided to keep=\r\n a watchful eye on the planet until the crystals were ripe for his taking. =\r\nWith the Cybertronians out of his way, he went pleased with himself.\n\n     =\r\n       Yet before the Minions could awake, there came the wreckage of the M=\r\nephilis, a slaver ship. The crash on Earth caused the deaths of most of the=\r\n slave drivers, and those who survived were met with the wrathful vengeance=\r\n of the now free slaves. The slaves were from all known transformer faction=\r\ns and builds, a few even dating back to the era of the Great Wars. They all=\r\n formed a loose society, agreeing that slavery was to be banned from their =\r\nhearts, and punishable by death.\n\n            Fifteen years passed, and the=\r\n Mephilis survivors were then joined by the crews of rescue ships that had =\r\nfinally managed to track them down. Contact was re-established with Cybertr=\r\non, and colons started arriving, forming high-tech cities that were designe=\r\nd to ensure a central government on the planet. Industry and economy were b=\r\nustling, and everybody was happy.\n\n            Or rather, they would have b=\r\neen. The Minions awoke and soon, a sort of Cold War was raging between the =\r\nUnicronians and the Cybertronians, but also between the Cybertronians thems=\r\nelves. Old hatred died hard, and in this case, they even resurrected. The M=\r\naximals and Predacons emerged from the colonies and mistrust became rampant=\r\n. Yet, some felt that it was their duties to make sure the Minions were bei=\r\nng watched. Some, no matter their personal allegiance, collaborated and for=\r\nmed the Watchers, keeping the Unicronians in check while others were embark=\r\ning on a power trip.\n\n Cities and Locations\n\n  a.. Olympus Complex: The mil=\r\nitary heart of the planet. Army training facilities are located there and m=\r\nost weaponry is available from that city. It is located inside a tall mount=\r\nain, with its higher rises coming out of the rocky top. Most military leade=\r\nrs come from there, such as Lord Jotunn, leader of the Iron Skulls Predacon=\r\ns. Minions are to be shot on sight in Olympus Complex.\n  b.. Atlantis: Loca=\r\nted on an ancient island, this city is made up of tall towers and labs wher=\r\ne science and knowledge reign supreme. It is the testing ground of experime=\r\nntal technologies. Pacificus Maximals are strong there, with Lord Perseus l=\r\neading them. Violence in Atlantis results in immediate banishment from the =\r\ncity.\n  c.. Valley Mine Pentatron: As its name implies, this city is a mini=\r\nng city where much of the planet&#39;s workforce reside. It is also one of the =\r\nmost industrial cities in the world, and one of the most culturally univers=\r\nal. At the same time, shady business is frequent and law enforcement is not=\r\n one of the priorities. Lord Spire, leader of the Bushido Predacons, holds =\r\nher offices there.\n  d.. Cryonosis: This is the Antarctic base of the Watch=\r\ners. It is loaded with up-to-the-minute stealth and surveillance technology=\r\n. Not many dwell there, as it is the most environmentally hazardous city, b=\r\nut there are enough people to make Lord Elder, Watcher leader, proud of his=\r\n achievements. Giving in to faction struggles there can result in jailing.\n=\r\n  e.. Relay: If the world has a center, this is it. A city in the sky, Rela=\r\ny is where the lords meet and vote, where the Central Government is seated =\r\nand where the corporations are based. Trade is made from there, and transpo=\r\nrtations and communications are developed there. Lord Razorwing, leader of =\r\nthe Silver Wings Maximals, is based there. Being found guilty of corruption=\r\n in Relay is punishable by public execution.\n  f.. Orbital Factories: These=\r\n are the center of production for the planet.\n  g.. Searing Eye Base: Rumor=\r\ns say that the Minions are building a base on the moon, a tribute to Unicro=\r\nn himself. Nothing is known for sure about it, but red reflections can be s=\r\neen from the natural satellite at night.\n Factions and Groups\n  a.. Bushido=\r\n Predacons: In the spirit of the warrior&#39;s way, these Predacons believe tha=\r\nt preserving the peace will allow them to grow strong for the little while =\r\nthey still have before the Minions start an all-out war. Leader: Spire.\n  b=\r\n.. Iron Skulls Predacons: These Predacons think and proclaim loudly that th=\r\ne Maximals are weak and that they will bring destruction on everybody when =\r\nthe Minions act. They would rather take over the lead from the Maximals and=\r\n act right now. Leader: Jotunn.\n  c.. Pacificus Maximals: The Pacificus pre=\r\nach that peace is the only way everybody can focus on the efforts against t=\r\nhe Minions. Leader: Perseus.\n  d.. Silver Wings Maximals: The Silver Wings =\r\nare convinced that the Predacons are preparing a revolution and that they w=\r\nant to prepare a strike against them. They think they should take them all =\r\nout before things get rough. Leader: Razorwing.\n  e.. The Watchers: The Wat=\r\nchers are dedicated to the monitoring of the Minions. They are crafty and s=\r\nwift, and they are renowned Minion-killers at times. Their skills also incl=\r\nude diplomacy, however, as members of any factions can join the Watchers. L=\r\neader: Elder.\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0080_01C56579.7E3D9360\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.2627&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Okey &lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;As some of your knows NBW will go to&nbsp;change a \n=\r\nlittle its story line, and here&#39;s some ideas that Azure was working on.
