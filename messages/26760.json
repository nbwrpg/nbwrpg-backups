This is about tact.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I am a cynic and a skeptic by nature.  I am also emotionally detached\n&gt; when it comes to matters of death and opinion.  JP, you made a foolish\n&gt; mistake by saying that in front of his friends.  I am not saying you are\n&gt; right or wrong, I have no way of knowing.  However this will not be\nfinished\n&gt; until there is mourning, appropriate or not.  And I, for one, do not here\nto\n&gt; see depressing comments and petty arguments.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I would like to end this message with one last piece of advice: Do not\n&gt; pity those who have died by their own hand, for they no longer must cope\nwith\n&gt; the problems of life.  Pity those who must live with the consequences of\nhis\n&gt; decision.  Pity those who are forced to live with the people who brought\nhim\n&gt; to the point where suicide is possible.  And finally, pity those who\nbrought\n&gt; him to the point where suicide is possible for they will be forever filled\n&gt; with guilt for this tragedy.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
