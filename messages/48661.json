The shields had \ntaken a heavy beating and some parts of the hull were damaged, but \neverything was still in working condition.\n\nTyrael fell down on the floor, breathing loudly from the effort he had \nto make to keep stable aboard in phoenix mode. One aspect of the \ntechno-organicity had both good and bad points. While making a heavy \neffort took a lot of energy, its recuperation was faster than that of \npurely technologic transformers. \n\nThe major stood up and transformed. He looked around and saw that the \nbridge did not seem to have suffered major damages. However, the dim \nlight could prove him wrong.\n\nTyrael: Strikers, status report, both you and the ship. I want to know \nwhere we are as soon as possible.\n\nThe light brightness emanating from him was getting stronger as he \ncalmed down.\n\n\n"}}
