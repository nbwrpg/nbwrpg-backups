Like a meteor it \nscreamed across the sky. The maximal protoform inside instinctivly \ntried to salvage the ship. With little sucsess it crashed into a \npile of sharp energon. A small shrpnel piece was jammed through the \nprotoform slightly oh so slghtly penetrating his spark. The \nprotoform took the shape of a nearby Falcon, but with a translucent \nbody that shined blue. Inside you could see the mechanics at work, \nyet his outter body was the hardest material many had ever seen. \nCryaltron pulled himself out of the pod and ran a \ndiagnostic. &quot;Energon posioning iminent, spark in jeapordy, death \ninevitable.&quot; The shrapel still stuck out of his chest, he broke it \noff leaving a crystal like object infront of his doomed spark. on \nhis robot form shoulders were sharp extendesions of energon, as were \nhis fingers and feet. In his falcon form his wings were made of the \nsame. His body was basicly made of hardned energon and the spark \nencased in an energon crystal, the spark slightly ever so slighty \npierced in the front of it. &quot;How long do I have?&quot; came an voice of \nexperience, his exact age was unknow but he survived many \nwars. &quot;Unclear progression unmeasurable.&quot; Cryatron snarled, &quot;Slag \nit!&quot; He transformed into his Falcon mode. The sun shined through him \nlike a plate of glass...like he wasn&#39;t even there only leaving a \nrainbow under him as his trail. &quot;Any maximal in rage please \nrespond.&quot; He flew off blasting his thrusters as well trying to get \nas far away from the  murderous energon as he could.\n\n\n"}}
