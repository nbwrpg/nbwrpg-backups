He glances back, \nreturns to his work of moving the Dark Avian. The side thrusters fire \nslightly, nudging the ship, and it&#39;s passengers to the right slightly \nas the large vessel steadily moves past the southerly tip of the \nBaffin Islands. Seeing that the newcommer is looking confused, he \npops a few words back, &quot;What&#39;s crack&#39;n--&quot; His chair spins around \nonce, and returns to where it started, giving Switchblade a good \nview of who he was talking to, &quot;--Ragnus?&quot; (In other words, he said \n&quot;What&#39;s crack&#39;n Ragnus?&quot;) =)\n\n&gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  \n\nAstroblast smiles as the mighty figure known as Abominus forms \nnear him, dwarfing the much smaller bot. He mutters to himself in \nanticipation, &quot;Abominus...&quot; Then he gives out the orders, \n&quot;Abominus. Walk, into, the, water.&quot; He continues, going nice and \nslow so the stupid bot understands at least some of what is being \nsaid. &quot;Swim, (or sink I guess) downward, until, you, reach, Stratus, \nand, listen, and, obey, his, orders.&quot; Astroblast finishes having \nbecome somewhat irritated at this procedure. \n\nAbominus growls, &quot;Grrrr, Abominus.... crush....&quot; the stupid bot \nlooks at Astroblast menacingly, but decides to follow the \ninstructions provided. &quot; Abominus... walk.... sw... swi.... \ncrusssshhhh....&quot; The stupid bot enters the water.\n\nHe opens a commlink to Stratus, &quot;Stratus, I&#39;m sending Abominus \ndown to you,&quot; He says as Abominus enters the water in the \ndirection that Stratus had went, &quot;Order him to loosen the ship, and \nbring it to the surface. He strength should be able to do the job. \nThe ship will have slight flotation properties. Oh, and remember, \nkeep your sentences short and slow, VERY slow so the stupid bot \nunderstands. Astroblast out.&quot; He closes the commlink and by that \ntime, Abominus had completely submersed himself and was \ntraveling downward to Stratus\n\n\n\nOn 3 Aug 2001, at 20:14, ragnus_@... wrote:\n\n&gt;   Ragnus slowly made his way to the command section of the base, his\n&gt; joints still slightly stiff from lack of use.
