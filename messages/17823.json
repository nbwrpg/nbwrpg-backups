The Trainer chip was being \nforsed back by the maximal chip, but the maximal chip couldn&#39;t push \nout the trainer chips programming completely. the two main programs \nfought head to head and were in a tie as far as trying to push the \nother program out.  She was now dealing with two very strong programs.\n\nShe groaned a little inside the chamber and started to wake up.  She \nstarted to feel like her old self again.  her old Maximal self.  She \nopened her eyes smiled. She knocked lightly on the CR door. &quot;Hello? \nCan I get out now? I think I&#39;m ok now.  Hello?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
