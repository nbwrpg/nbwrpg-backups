I once was a bot named \n&gt; Treadshot, but i was killed by this Maximal bitch in a battle at \nthe CF. My \n&gt; partner Hurricane brought me back to base and was about to bury my \nbody, but \n&gt; then the inventor, Wheeljack, said he could fix me. He fixed me up, \nand here \n&gt; i am. the names Banzai-Tron.  So anyway i obviusly swore revenge on \nthis \n&gt; Airazor chick as soon as i was brought back.  I found her flying \nand slagged \n&gt; her easy.  But then her boyfriend or something goes ballistic. I \nchallenge \n&gt; him to a man-to-man fight and i almost had him, but then he hit me \nwith his \n&gt; flamehtrower. Next thing i know im here talking to you.  Im burned \npretty \n&gt; bad, so get me to a CR as soon as possible.\n\n\n"}}
