She stays in Mouse mode and scurries off through the forest. She is \na little upset over the fact that she can&#39;t find place to fit in.*\n\n*She whispers to herself as she goes along.*\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t believe it.  I&#39;m a Pred.  I know my programming.  I know I should \nbe without mercy and pity for anything.  I know I am supposed to be cold \nhearted and without regret.  So why am I not.  Why do I care? Why should I \ncare? I&#39;m a Pred.  I shouldn&#39;t care about anyone or anything.  But then why \ndo I find myself actually giving a care about what happens around here.  I \nhave seen bots destroyed and terminated.  I have killed enemies and fought \nbefore.  Yet I find myself regretting the killings.  Why is this happening \nto me?&quot;\n\n*She stopped and looked down at her Predacon symbol.  She felt disgust when \nshe looked at it.  She had never felt like this before.  She couldn&#39;t \nbelieve that her programming was doing this to her.  She wanted to rip the \nsymbol off her body and burn it.  But would the Maximals accpet her knowing \nshe was once a Pred?  Would The Pred&#39;s kill her for turning traitor?  She \npondered this as she walked along. She stopped by a large tree stump and \ntransformed into bot mode.  She sat on the stump and looked at the Pred \nsymbol again. She felt like she would never regain her honor if she tore it \noff.  But she couldn&#39;t stand to look at it any more. She sighed very heavily \nand put her hand over the symbol. She ripped it off and threw it to the \nground.  She stared at it for some time.  She knew she did the right thing.  \nBut she wondered if doing the right thing would cost her her life.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
