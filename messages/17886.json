First he slaps \nme, pushes me around. And I can&#39;t take it any more.  No more miss \nnice bat.&quot; She turned and headed for the canyons. She went into a \nnose dive and pulled up at the last second, coasting only a few feet \noff the canyon floor. She swung and glided in and out of the rock \nstructures. She skimmed her wings along a small pond and the rose a \nfew more feet.  She then made a sharp turn and quickly ducked into a \ncave.  She flew up into the ceiling of the cave and hung, upside down \non a stalagtite.  She wrapped her wings around her and hid in the \ndark of the cave.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
