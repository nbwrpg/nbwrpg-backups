He saw an \nintact EMP cannon on the CF and fired off 25 rapid blasts frome his nosecone, \nlaunching two missiles down at the CF itself.\n\nA thought popped into his neurological circuitry.  He opened up a comm. link \nto Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;Maximal leader.  I have a proposition.  I will release this pathetic Maximal \nif you relenquish all prisoners from your brig into our custody and allow all \nour forces inside your ship to leave without being shot at.  Then the \nAlliance forces shall withdraw.  Either this, or we shall continue to pummel \nyou into submission.  I suggest you take my offer.&quot;\n---\n\nBreakdown jumped out of the way of most of the shots including the photon \ncharges, the few that him didn&#39;t damage him that much to his thick armor.  He \nfired off a grenade from his launcher at Highbrow and a sonic arc blast from \nhis sonic blaster at Chromedome.\n\n---\n\nPyro was still being pushed, now five feet under the muddy ground.\n\n---\n\nHiss ducked down, a dozen crystal shards cutting at his armor.  He fired off \nfive rapid optic blasts at Hardhead and four fusion blasts from his cannon at \nHighbrow.  He let out a curse as the freezing vapors struck, the robot \nincreasing his internal temperature by ten degrees F.\n\n---\n\nScavenger swerves hard left, avoiding the acid but weapons fire from \nStreetwise struck his hood.  He fired off another fifty armor-piercing \nrounds, this time at Brainstorm, \n\n---\n\nHot Spot continued with his assault on Pryo.\n\n---\n\nGroove fired off another burst of freezing mist, this one at Scavenger.\n\n---\n\nBlades continued crawling, his wounds getting more severe as he dragged them \non the ground.  He was nearing First Aid, but didn&#39;t notice Nemesis Enforcer.\n\n---\n\nFirst Aid layed on his back still in stasis lock.\n\n---\n\nStreetwise jumped down from various shots, hitting his chest hard.\n\n===\n\nDemon Wulf growled, transforming ot his biped mode, swinging his sword, \nfiring a blade missile at the CF.  \n\nHe let out a howl, followed by a horse laugh, pointing a clawed finger at IR.\n\n&quot;You will not live to see the end of your pathetic craft!&quot;\n\n===\n\nFlesh Ripper formed a blue orb of energy in his left palm, throwing it at the \nCF, the orb being just a little stronger than the grenade.  He fied three \nfire balls from his mouth soon after.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw formed one black orb in his left palm, throwing the energy orb that \nis as powerful as a few charges at the CF.  He formed a whitish-yellow orb, \nthrowin it at the CF, the orb of energy having the affects of an EMP blast.\n\nDark Claw laughed, his energy was extensive.\n\n===\n\nBeeline the cyberbee dive bombed, firing off four optic blasts and \nintercepting four missiles.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch watched as the missiles heading for him were intercepted by \nlaser fire.  He raised his tail, firing a spray of acid.  He watched as the \nshots and all but one shell were intercepted.  The shell struck him, and he \nlaughed.\n\nHe raised his left pincher, firing off two energy-signature seeking missiles \nat Torca, tow of the same type from the other pincher at Sky Lynx.\n\n---\n\nManterror was struck by numerous blasts, sending him crashing to the ground, \nnot moving.\n\n---\n\nInjector flew up, avoiding the missile heading for him.  He raised his \nthorax, firing off two stinger missiles at Sideswipe.  He fired three optic \nblast from his insect optic sensors at Ratchet.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee flew hard left, the missile missing him as well as 12 of the shots \nintended for him, the rest knocking him back half a foot.  He raised both \narms, firing two stinger missiles from both launchers, two at Torca, two at \nSideswipe.\n\n---\n\nSixshot watched as the missile heading for him was intercepted by an optic \nblast.  He rolled, three shells digging into his left shin, mech-fluid \nleaking.\n\nHe raised boht weapons, firing off four hypersonic blasts at Sky Lynx from \nhis left blaster, and four of the same kind at Sideswipe from the other.\n\n---\n\nAres fired off two optic blasts at the incoming shells, two knocking him back \na few feet as they went off against his chest plate.\n\nHe raised his grenade launcher, firing a grenade at Torca.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher dodged the missile by flying fast, eight shots sending him \ntwisting through the air.  He raised his rifle as he balanced out and \nswitched it to automatic fire, 20 laser bolts lancing out at Torca.\n\n---\n\nReflector was struck by four shells, two in the left shoulder, two in the \nabdomen.  He cursed as his armor was cut through.  He fired off four laser \nbolts from his rifle at Tavatron.  He then fired ten rapid optic blasts at \nSky Lynx.\n\n===\n\nMinion pulled hard left in his jeep, the missile missing but shrapnel cut \ninto his front right light, breaking it apart.\n\nHe fired off twenty-four armor-piercing rounds at Sky Lynx, 12 from each \ncannon.\n\n---\n\nChaos fired four five-foot long missiles at the CF, one from all four of his \nmissile tubes in his missile truck mode.  -Have to keep a good portion of my \nmissiles-\n\n===\n\nNemesis continued crawling, spotting Blades.  He sped up his speed at \ncrawling.\n\n===\n\nScattershot flew through the air, looking at the CF and the slaggin shields \nthat had came back online.  He raised his right arm, firing off 25 explosive \nshells at the CF.\n\nRaising his left arm, a missile launcher appeared from subspace.  He fired \noff a rocket from the weapon of war at port side of the CF.\n\n===\n\nFirestarter continued flying, firing off two rockets from both wrist \nlaunchers, the four missiles heading for the bridge door that had been locked \ndown.\n\n---\n\nVehement sighed.  These heathens were irritating.  He turned around, raising \nboth arms.  With the left barrel that made up most of his arm launched a \nmissile, followed by another, heading for the armored computers.  \n\nHe turned his attention to the hole in the CF from whence he came, firing off \ntwo missiles at the hole, knowing his missiles would strike the shields if \nleft alone.\n\n---\n\nUnitron raised his laser rifle, firing off four bolts at the sealed door, \nfollowed by a single optic blast.\n\nMeanwhile, in the main entry door of the CF, in its exact middle, the horn \nmissiles continued sending out a shock wave of sonic energy to weaken the \nstability of the metal around it.\n\n"}}
