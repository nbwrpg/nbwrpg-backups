She then took steps to \n&gt; reactivate him.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;From my scans, it will take at least an hour for him to fully \nre- \n&gt; activate, since he lost all his built up energy reserve.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The crane arm over the table lifted back into the ceiling, and \nthe \n&gt; gel drained from the tank.

The t- rex head \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his chest lifted and opened, revealing the curcuitry inside.  \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interface connected and Hellplague went to the computer \nagain.  \n&gt; &gt; She \n&gt; &gt; &gt; began accessing his core memory, as well as his software.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;OOOOh, someone has put heavy restrictions on him.
