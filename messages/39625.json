Two huge wings shot from his back shooting him into the air.  Once there, he looked down to the ball and took aim.  &quot;Muchos, use all energy to make a barrette.&quot; he said.  \n\n&quot;Complete&quot;\n\nA massive energy barrette grew on the end of the rifle, with as much energy to match that of the ball Hellpeon was making.  Feeling no loss of energy, he pulled the trigger of his rifle and the barrette shot off forming a ball of energy that was heading straight for the other one Hellpeon had.  &quot;Lets jsut see how much you can handle.&quot;\n\nWith that Ultimo pulled his shield close a energy force field fallign around him.\n\n\nnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hellpeons sword twirled int eh ari while it was fung and then landed \n&gt; next to Ultimos foot. As it did and the energy barette came near \n&gt; Hellpeon, he quickly twirled off to the side and smirked as he stood \n&gt; in the sand. His body began to pulse somewhat as his body began to \n&gt; crackle with energy, his eyes began to glow red and his body an eery \n&gt; black. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hellpeon: &quot;You seem somewhat worthy of a fighter... but play time is \n&gt; over...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that said Hellpeon began to gather a large amount of Chaochitan \n&gt; energy into his palms, energy swirling into the orb as bits of the \n&gt; energy from Hacha&#39;s remains flew into the ball as well. Then the ball \n&gt; seemed to begin to draw solar energy and evergy generated by the \n&gt; slight wind, and perhaps some energy from Ultimo.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ultimo took a step back &quot;Energy Barrette&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Online&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A long barrette of pure energy so condense it made a solid able to \n&gt; change in shape. �Ultimo hit the sabre to the side then parried by \n&gt; having the �barrette extend towards Hellpeons sword hand. �With his \n&gt; other hand he threw �his shield in front of the blast but it knocked \n&gt; him back a bit from the close range, also obscurring the attack of \n&gt; his barrete causing Ultimo to swing his arm up the extended barrette \n&gt; going straight at Hellpeons neck from the chest area.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; nbwrpg@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And as the flame came towards him it was quickly repeled by that \n&gt; barrier of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chaochtian energy. And once again Hellpeon tried to skewer Ultimo \n&gt; with his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sabre before releasing a large blast at him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at \n&gt; http://webmail.netscape.com/\n&gt; \n&gt;\n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
