You&#39;re worth more to me than any preciou=\r\ns metal or power source.  And, Torca&#39;s right, I - could use a rest, but, pe=\r\nrhaps I will get that when I undergo the repairs to my optic sensors.   Sta=\r\nnton, I need to ask you a favor.  One that I know is extremely difficult to=\r\n accomplish, and one that I&#39;d never ask of you unless it was a dire need.  =\r\nI would like you to attempt the delicate process of bringing my optic senso=\r\nrs back online.  If it doesn&#39;t work, I understand.  But I saw how important=\r\n it was for me to be able to see in order to get an idea of the situation a=\r\nt hand and how to remedy it.  A blind eye can only go so far.  And if at al=\r\nl possible, could the same be done for Perceptor? He too, deserves a second=\r\n chance of seeing things in a whole new light.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =A0&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; El=\r\nita is okay, Nightlight is being repaired but I believe she&#39;ll make a full =\r\nrecovery or at least I have a feeling she will. Oh, um by the way, maybe yo=\r\nu should thank Tucson for helping you. After all, he took a real gamble in =\r\ngoing back into that tunnel to find you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nYeah, it was a real bumpy ride too. He couldn&#39;t let ya sit there and get de=\r\nstroyed, he risked his spark ta save ya, and I&#39;m glad we got ya back.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Tucson directs an ear toward Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, no one is g=\r\noing to go after you, as long as my spark remains strong. Rodimus, we&#39;ve be=\r\nen through a great ordeal, but I promise you that no harm to you will go un=\r\n noticed. That hive has caused nothing but strife for all of us, and I will=\r\n not tolerate that happening again. So here is where we stand.. We have two=\r\n enemies to vanquish. Yet in order to stop one, we must stop the other. We =\r\nneed to know everything there is about those insectoids, and find out their=\r\n weaknesses, and subdue them. Then, we will deal with what comes afterwards=\r\n. I can only hope that all of us, including Windlord, will be able to turn =\r\nthe tables which desperately need turning.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus look=\r\ned relieved as he heard about Eilita and Nightlight, a\n&gt; smile blossoming a=\r\ncross his face, &quot;Good.&quot; he said, his optics bright\n&gt; with joy. He looked ov=\r\ner at Tuscon, &quot;My friend you have saved me from\n&gt; the brink.&quot; His smiled di=\r\nmmed a bit as he thought about what had just\n&gt; happened, about what he and =\r\nTuscon had just experienced.\n&gt; \n&gt; He was about to say something when when .=\r\n . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;DAAAADDDD!!!&quot;said a very happy childish voice. E=\r\nLita Ran towards hers dad\n&gt; &gt; and Huged him tightly&quot;You and my mom came bac=\r\nk!!!! I missed you daddy.... I\n&gt; &gt; miss you and my mom&quot;Elita started to sob=\r\n&quot;you never leave me again, neither\n&gt; &gt; my mom, will you? will you never lea=\r\nve again? Mom still is in Cr Chamber and\n&gt; &gt; uncle Kup is with Windlord&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am back, and missed you too.&quot; Rodimus said cradling Elita =\r\nagainst\n&gt; his chest. &quot;I will always keep you and your mother safe.&quot; he said=\r\n, his\n&gt; mind still running over the past events and wondering with all that=\r\n\n&gt; was going on could any of them ever make that promise, that he would\n&gt; n=\r\never leave them. he wished he could.\n&gt; \n&gt; He nodded to Tuscon&#39;s question ab=\r\nout joining him, unsure what this\n&gt; would mean for Elita, but her knew that=\r\n there was so much that had to\n&gt; be said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I jsut Fini=\r\nshed, little one&quot;said Kup while he arrived to the room &quot;He will\n&gt; &gt; wake up=\r\n soon... Now Perceptor, what can you tell us about the strage\n&gt; &gt; behavior =\r\nof Nightlight? Why she acted as she did in the BLackfortress? why\n&gt; &gt; she r=\r\nan of us ?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;She is a predacon, still she is; and as a predacon she=\r\n behaves like\n&gt; &gt; one&quot;said dryly the male &quot;Well almost a predacon&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;What you mean?&quot;said Talon\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I havent time to do a conventional repr=\r\nogram process and she was to weak to\n&gt; &gt; endure one&quot;Said Dryly Perceptor&quot;an=\r\nd and i wont continue giving more details\n&gt; &gt; cause this little bot will ha=\r\nve nightmares if she hear it and some details I\n&gt; &gt; only told them to Tucso=\r\nn and Rodimus...&quot;and moving his head towars Rodimus\n&gt; &gt; and Tucson said&quot;I d=\r\notn know that if is the right way in Maximals but in\n&gt; &gt; Predacons some inf=\r\no just the comander knows it&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus stood carrying Elita =\r\nin his arms, showing a surprising amount\n&gt; of energy for a bot who had just=\r\n a few minutes earlier been in a deep\n&gt; life threatening coma. &quot;Young one.&quot;=\r\n he said, talking to Elita, his\n&gt; voice dropping for her ears only, &quot;we gro=\r\nwn ups have a few things to\n&gt; discuss. Go keep an eye on mommy until I get =\r\nthere.&quot; His was the voice\n&gt; of a loving father, a mixture of both authority=\r\n and affection. There\n&gt; was so much going on and they had to get it all out=\r\n in the open before\n&gt; things progressed too far.\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca the leader and =\r\ngeneral of the Maximal Fuzors also stepped into\n&gt; the room, his large tusks=\r\n that were attached to his shoulder rose up\n&gt; over his head barely missed t=\r\nhe cieling as he ducked down slightly to\n&gt; come through the doorway. He loo=\r\nked around his optics softening\n&gt; slightly as he saw for himself that Rodim=\r\nus was awake.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes indeed we do have much to discuss.&quot; his deep voice =\r\nboomed across\n&gt; the room. He looked at Perceptor for a long moment as if he=\r\n were about\n&gt; to send him out of the room, but then he just turned his mass=\r\nive head\n&gt; to peer at Rodimus and then Tuscon, &quot;And then I am sure both of =\r\nyou\n&gt; will need your rest.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
