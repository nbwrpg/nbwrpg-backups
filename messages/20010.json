There would be no other clear way out of this cavern then!\n\nZyber whimperes as she tried with her might to heave herself to her feet, \nholding her sides as she got up and looked towards DeathScythe.\nShe growled plaintivly at his words.\n\nShe closed and covered her optics as he blasts open the exit again, only to \nfeel a wash of cold air swamp into the cavern.\nZyber then opened her optics to see DeathScyther walk out of the cave, \ngiving it everything she had to move quickly and try and get out also. Even \nif it meant being with him again in the same situation.\nIt wasn&#39;t hard to know that he was going to seal up the hole again, and just \nas she broke into a run, so close to the enterance he fired.\nHowever, with a cringe she dove just under the blast, rolling out right into \nthe back legs of DeathScythe.\nShe hit hard against them, but at least she was out of the cave.\nBut there was still the threat that DeathScythe just might fall back against \nher now...because she had struck the back of his knees!*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
