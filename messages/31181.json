I must say that is has \n&gt; been an honor and a privilage to role play with all of you. I shall \n&gt; miss you all very much. Best wishes to all of you.  I hope that if I \n&gt; am able to return,  I shall have the honor of role playing with you \n&gt; all again. Thank you for letting me RPG here and for being such a \n&gt; wonderful group.  It&#39;s been a real pleasure to be apart of all this. \n&gt; Once again, I thank you all. Please feel free to email me on my \n&gt; private email when ever you wish.  I shall respond as soon as I can. \n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Logo\n\n\n"}}
