His \neyes widen as he hears Pyro&#39;s message. The slight surprise from it causes him \nto fail to evade another one of Sixshot&#39;s swings and stumble back in pain.\n\n&quot;Yeah, go ahead and fight him,&quot; Zardus says to Shocker, swinging his sword \nonce again at Sixshot.\n\nHe jumps backwards, letting Shocker take Sixshot, and recieves Dark One&#39;s \nmessage.\n\n&quot;Maximals,&quot; he says into his comm-link, sending the message to all maximal \nunits, &quot;This is Zardus. I must remind you that we are allied. If you would \nhold your fire on my troops, I&#39;d apreciate it. If not, you will all die by my \nfaction&#39;s hand.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl blinks as he recieves Zardus&#39; transmission. That was a pretty harsh \nultimatum, but they were, after all, allied. Hearing Liono, he turns to fire \na shot at the Dietes, who are forming Dark Messiah.\n\n"}}
