Do what you want. \nJust bec drillbit proposed first does not mean a thing. Destructor was not \naround then. So how will you ever know. But all I can do is tell you this. \nThink of who makes you happy. Who you can see as your protector your love and \nyour life. I know i cant help you make this desicion. No one can help you. I \nsuggest you take some time away from both of them and think. Do not tell \ndrillbit yet of what has happened for I fear what he may do. I leave you know \nto protecte destructor. I owe him that much. He is the noblest bot I have \never meet.&quot; He walked away and stood infront of the cr holding destructor \nstanding guard.\n\n"}}
