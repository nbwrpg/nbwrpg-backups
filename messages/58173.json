The transformer knew it and in fact enjoyed it. \nUnlike some of his brothers and sisters, he was pleased by the \nloneliness of the Great Void.\n\nHe scanned the place. This system was huge, and there were many \ninteresting resources around. One of the most promising was this gas \ngiant and its 16 moons. It would hold great significance for them...\n\nHowever, his long range scanners detected something even better. \nEnergon. Energon! ENERGON FOR THE ANCIENTS&#39; SAKE! The Master would \nlike that...\n\nHis meteorite form moved to a new trajectory and with astonishing \nspeed, he burst forward to this undiscovered planet. However, as he \ncame closer, he recognized something... Tranformers, cybertronian \ntransformers! He sent a message.\n\n???????: Master, I have discovered a planetful of energon. However, \nthere are Cybertronians crawling on its surface like flies on a \nrotting piece of meat. I would suggest you send Sister Lunekill to \neradicate their threat.\n\nA deep voice answered him, from another part of the galaxy.\n\n???????: A wise decision, Rockseeker, my minion. I will send her to \nyou. Continue your prospecting for now.\n\nWith that, Rockseeker flew down on the planet and went on the top of \nthe highest mountain to complete his survey.\n\n\n"}}
