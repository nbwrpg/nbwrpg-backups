So we have to be nice to everyone.&quot; she \nsaid with a big childish grin on her face plates. \n\nKitKat:\nShe couldn&#39;t help but notice how Blackfang was tripping over his \nwords. She smiled at him, trying not to laugh. She put her hand on \nher hip and let her tail slowly sway behind her as she stood. &quot;Are \nyou actually inviting me to stay here? I am a Predacon.&quot; but she \ncouldn&#39;t help it in liking the idea for recon purposes. She thought \nperhaps it might be a prime oppertunity. She smiled and took a few \nsteps closer to Blackfang. She stood only two feet from him and \nlooked directly into his optics. She couldn&#39;t stop herself from \nwishing he was on her side. &quot;Am I to be a guest or a well kept \nhostage?&quot; in a soft and gentle tone. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; He wouldn&#39;t admit it, but the tone of her voice made him shudder \nwith\n&gt; delight. However, he showed it a bit. He normally wasn&#39;t that shy \nwith\n&gt; female Transformers, but with her, he seemed to have become a \nwalking\n&gt; noodle-bot.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Well... Huh... I guess you could say that... But there \nwas\n&gt; that one Terran tradition where they used to treat the wounded that\n&gt; were both friendlies and enemies... I guess that&#39;s a fine tradition\n&gt; with me.\n&gt; \n&gt; In his head, he was just wondering what he was saying at all. He\n&gt; usually made sense in his sentences!\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: You know, if you&#39;d like to stay a while longer to make \nsure\n&gt; your injury is repaired, you&#39;re welcome. I mean, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re\n&gt; inhospitable, right Cam? We like everyone!\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
