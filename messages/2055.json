This is a heavy laser rifle (for reference, look at \n&quot;Aftermath&quot;, which was after the Other Voices parts, in that western-like \nfight between Maxis and Preds).  At point blank range, that gun would&#39;ve \nblown a frickin&#39; hole in Suukie&#39;s GUT!  I urge you to repost that Code.  The \nweapon has a power pack, it doesn&#39;t depend on the power of Stinkbomb&#39;s \nenergy.  \n\n"}}
