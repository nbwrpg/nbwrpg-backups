It was programmed ta fowllow his IFF signature upon deployment.\n&gt; The cam is cloaked but it is following him.  Just one of many useful tools a\n&gt; Ninjabot doesn&#39;t go without.  Here, ya got full interface with the stealth\n&gt; cam, and ya got full video feed inta the Ark&#39;s mainframe. C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get\n&gt; inside and see how far that spy cam got.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWING CALIBER nodded, &quot;Now this could be something that would be\nhelpful. Perhaps there will be footgae that could show us where they\nare.&quot; He looked at the ninja-bot, &quot;I take it the device has a beacon\non it so that we can track it when we need to?&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson slowly lumbers off the shuttle on heavy feet, dragging his long tail\n&gt; behind him.  He now has just enough energy to walk into the Ark.  Rattrap\n&gt; and Straight Shot are fast to scamper over to him.  He looks softly down to\n&gt; his sister with a gentile look on his face. Her new form didn&#39;t bother him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I knew that would happen eventually.  Remind me not to step on you,\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want a foot full of quills.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The tiny porcupine couldn&#39;t help but throw her little paws around her\n&gt; brother&#39;s neck, with a heart felt hug, keeping her quills down and\n&gt; retracted.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s for giving it your all, literally. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He couldn&#39;t help but gently rub his snout on her face, in a show of\n&gt; affection.  He then looks for Elita and Nightlight.\n&gt;\n&gt; I must - see Elita and Nightlight.  Their safety is at risk.  Can - not let\n&gt; Rodimus anywhere near them.  In fact he - must be barred from the Ark until\n&gt; further notice.  If he dares to show his face in this parameter I will not\n&gt; hesitate to defend the Ark against him.  He is our enemy now, and no foe is\n&gt; allowed anywhere near our territory.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEGACY walked out of the Ark to assist in the transport of SILVERBOLT,\nhis single optic turning to gaze at TUSCON, noting his new form.\n&quot;Interesting.&quot; He said strangely. &quot;Something new.&quot;\n\nHe turned as BUMP and SANTON emerged from the shuttle and began\nwalking towards the ARK.\n\nWING CALIBER turned to TUSCON, &quot;I do not believe you are in much shape\nto do anything, your systems look critically low.&quot; He stepped closer\nto TUSCOn as if afraid he would fall. &quot;Perhaps they can meet you in\nthe medical bay.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
