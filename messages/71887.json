We may not find=\r\n anything or we might just find something. At least we can start with the b=\r\nasics and go from there. I believe Nightshift was very interested in doing =\r\na recon mission in that area. Speaking of which, he must be at his place by=\r\n the river. He seemed upset before he left.

I actually enjoyed this aspect of military duty,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it w=\r\nas a good challenge for a rookie in training. And the strange aspect of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; that was the fact I just simply had a knack for solving complex strate=\r\ngies.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He then thinks of Optimus Primal, and how they could=\r\n determine his last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; location.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Mathematics, it has=\r\n everything to do with numbers. The geographic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates, they le=\r\nad to areas of latitude and longitude. Now, to find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Primal, he must=\r\n have informed someone as to where he was going. We chart\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the dista=\r\nnce between here and the intended destination, and map out various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nroutes leading to that location. You will come up with several different\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scenarios but, they will all point to one area of bilocation. We then=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; factor in his rate of speed he was traveling at, including the tim=\r\ne he left\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here, and the time it takes to reach the final destinatio=\r\nn. Then, determine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time of his last transmission and that will =\r\nindicate how far he got and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where he could possibly be now. I know =\r\nit sounds complicated, but it worked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Cybertron, so let&#39;s see if =\r\nthat will work here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;One thing I have fou=\r\nnd Tuscon is that often times one cannot solve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; every mystery while si=\r\ntting at the drawing board.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Manipulating the console LEO atte=\r\nmpted to locate the information. &quot;The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; last record of Optimus Primal .=\r\n . . and at that point he was Optimal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Optimus, was at the Base of the=\r\n Pacifist Maximals the Atlantis base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He paused and read further. &quot;A=\r\nn interesting point that was registered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at that point was that thee w=\r\nas an Optimal Optimus Prime as well as an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Optimus Primal?&quot; LEO looked=\r\n confused, then nodded, &quot;There was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting trying to determine if o=\r\nne was a minion or not.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (OOC: See messages in Dec 2005 for re=\r\nference to what I&#39;m talking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about.

After I talk to Rattrap, Straight Shot and Wheelie, I think we can defin=\r\nitely dispatch a ground crew to begin investigating that area of the jungle=\r\n. We may not find anything or we might just find something. At least we can=\r\n start with the basics and go from there. I believe Nightshift was very int=\r\nerested in doing a recon mission in that area. Speaking of which, he must b=\r\ne at his place by the river. He seemed upset before he left. He usually goe=\r\ns there to clear his directory. He should return shortly.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; On Aug 24, 2011, at 2:30 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Tucson steps up to view the computer screen.

I actually enjoyed this aspect of military duty,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it wa=\r\ns a good challenge for a rookie in training. And the strange aspect of&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; that was the fact I just simply had a knack for solving compl=\r\nex strategies.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He then thinks of Optim=\r\nus Primal, and how they could determine his last&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; location=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Mathematics, it has everything to d=\r\no with numbers. The geographic&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates, they lead to =\r\nareas of latitude and longitude. Now, to find&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Primal, he =\r\nmust have informed someone as to where he was going. We chart&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; the distance between here and the intended destination, and map out va=\r\nrious&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; routes leading to that location. You will come up w=\r\nith several different&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; scenarios but, they will all point =\r\nto one area of bilocation. We then&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; factor in his rate of =\r\nspeed he was traveling at, including the time he left&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; her=\r\ne, and the time it takes to reach the final destination. Then, determine&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the time of his last transmission and that will indicate ho=\r\nw far he got and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; where he could possibly be now. I know i=\r\nt sounds complicated, but it worked&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on Cybertron, so let&#39;=\r\ns see if that will work here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;One thing I have found Tuscon is that often times on=\r\ne cannot solve&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; every mystery while sitting at the drawing boar=\r\nd.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Manipulating the console LEO attempted to lo=\r\ncate the information. &quot;The&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; last record of Optimus Primal . . .=\r\n and at that point he was Optimal&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Optimus, was at the Base of =\r\nthe Pacifist Maximals the Atlantis base.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; He paused and read f=\r\nurther. &quot;An interesting point that was registered&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; at that poin=\r\nt was that thee was an Optimal Optimus Prime as well as an&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Opt=\r\nimus Primal?&quot; LEO looked confused, then nodded, &quot;There was a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; m=\r\neeting trying to determine if one was a minion or not.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; (OOC: See messages in Dec 2005 for reference to what I&#39;m talking&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; about.
