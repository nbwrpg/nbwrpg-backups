This\n&gt;was practice, he didn&#39;t want to force her into a struggle for life and\n&gt;death.\n&gt;Dinobot thought that he would give her a chance to give up before he was\n&gt;forced to damage her and cause mech fluid to flow.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Surrender or sustain more damage!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* He waited for a reply, he WOULD hurt her if she chose to continue.\n&gt;Part of being a warrior was learning how to take pain!*\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
