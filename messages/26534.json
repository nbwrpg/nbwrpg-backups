Okay, so he had never really been one for running, even though he \nwas good at it. Diana was the real athletic one. She was always challenging \nhim to some sort of race or contest:\n\nRion coughed a couple of times before he finally got airborne. He flapped \ntwice, and managed to stay a couple feet off the ground before nearly \ncrashing into it. He skimmed along the surface for awhile, flapping \noccasionally. He wasn&#39;t ging too fast, about the average fast walking speed, \nbut at least he wasn&#39;t walking anymore!\n\n&quot;C&#39;mon! If we can find some trees or something we might find other &#39;bots \ntoo!&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
