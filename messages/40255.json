He transforms into beast mode, swimming out toward the ship.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Yan if you don&#39;t have time I can take Blot for now.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; The 50 foot behemoth turns his massive head, it shaking slowly, as he\n&gt; looks out along the shore line. His eyes were totally devoid of feeling,\n&gt; whatever the creature was thinking, it was most likely a survival\n&gt; program. He took a step back to get a better look, his massive foot\n&gt; lifting up, and moving towards the forest area that was lit. Sinnertwin\n&gt; looked up, quickly transformed, and scrambled out of the way, as his\n&gt; body area was replaced by the foot, which crunched into the ground,\n&gt; causing a slight tremor across the small island, as the ground began to\n&gt; split open. His huge foot easily sank into the rock, as he turned, to\n&gt; look out over the horizen. He then shifted his head, looking downward.\n&gt; &quot;What we do?&quot; he asked towards no one in perticular, his deafening voice\n&gt; shaking the air. What was left of the forest erupted with life, as herds\n&gt; of animals scrambled away in fear at the sudden comotion.\n\n\n"}}
