He hadn&#39;t\nseen it in a while, and that in itself made him more worried than\nanything. The enemy you can see is easier to deal with than the one\nyou can&#39;t.\n\nHe frowned as he realized something. It was really small, and he was\nnot sure why it caught his atention at all, but it did. During the\ntime that the dot appeared there was a slight increase in\nelectromagnetic energy. Not much, and certainly it would not have\ncaught the attention of most. However checking the sensor logs\nconfirmed it.\n\nWith a click he opened the Maximal channel, heaviest level of\nencryption, &quot;I believe I understand why the sensors were able to\ndetect the sensor ghost. It is because it was transmitting something.&quot;\nElder scanned the logs, &quot;I&#39;m not exactly sure how long it&#39;s been\nthere, but it&#39;s been a while.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
