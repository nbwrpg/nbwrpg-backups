Nothing that could do any permanent damage\n(Unless the other player agreed)\n\nDefensive- scaled hide, and wings.

If\nCyberwolf agrees to have Megaton limited by the same conditions, the size\nthing is fine by me. The rest of the council might have different opinions,\nthough.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
