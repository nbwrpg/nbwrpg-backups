He \nsaw an \n&gt; intact EMP cannon on the CF and fired off 25 rapid blasts frome his \nnosecone, \n&gt; launching two missiles down at the CF itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; A thought popped into his neurological circuitry.  He opened up a \ncomm. link \n&gt; to Iron Raptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Maximal leader.  I have a proposition.  I will release this \npathetic Maximal \n&gt; if you relenquish all prisoners from your brig into our custody and \nallow all \n&gt; our forces inside your ship to leave without being shot at.  Then \nthe \n&gt; Alliance forces shall withdraw.  Either this, or we shall continue \nto pummel \n&gt; you into submission.  I suggest you take my offer.&quot;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Breakdown jumped out of the way of most of the shots including the \nphoton \n&gt; charges, the few that him didn&#39;t damage him that much to his thick \narmor.  He \n&gt; fired off a grenade from his launcher at Highbrow and a sonic arc \nblast from \n&gt; his sonic blaster at Chromedome.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Pyro was still being pushed, now five feet under the muddy ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hiss ducked down, a dozen crystal shards cutting at his armor.  He \nfired off \n&gt; five rapid optic blasts at Hardhead and four fusion blasts from his \ncannon at \n&gt; Highbrow.  He let out a curse as the freezing vapors struck, the \nrobot \n&gt; increasing his internal temperature by ten degrees F.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scavenger swerves hard left, avoiding the acid but weapons fire \nfrom \n&gt; Streetwise struck his hood.  He fired off another fifty armor-\npiercing \n&gt; rounds, this time at Brainstorm, \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Spot continued with his assault on Pryo.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Groove fired off another burst of freezing mist, this one at \nScavenger.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Blades continued crawling, his wounds getting more severe as he \ndragged them \n&gt; on the ground.  He was nearing First Aid, but didn&#39;t notice Nemesis \nEnforcer.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; First Aid layed on his back still in stasis lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Streetwise jumped down from various shots, hitting his chest hard.\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf growled, transforming ot his biped mode, swinging his \nsword, \n&gt; firing a blade missile at the CF.  \n&gt; \n&gt; He let out a howl, followed by a horse laugh, pointing a clawed \nfinger at IR.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You will not live to see the end of your pathetic craft!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper formed a blue orb of energy in his left palm, throwing \nit at the \n&gt; CF, the orb being just a little stronger than the grenade.  He fied \nthree \n&gt; fire balls from his mouth soon after.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw formed one black orb in his left palm, throwing the \nenergy orb that \n&gt; is as powerful as a few charges at the CF.  He formed a whitish-\nyellow orb, \n&gt; throwin it at the CF, the orb of energy having the affects of an \nEMP blast.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw laughed, his energy was extensive.\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Beeline the cyberbee dive bombed, firing off four optic blasts and \n&gt; intercepting four missiles.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch watched as the missiles heading for him were \nintercepted by \n&gt; laser fire.  He raised his tail, firing a spray of acid.  He \nwatched as the \n&gt; shots and all but one shell were intercepted.  The shell struck \nhim, and he \n&gt; laughed.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised his left pincher, firing off two energy-signature seeking \nmissiles \n&gt; at Torca, tow of the same type from the other pincher at Sky Lynx.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror was struck by numerous blasts, sending him crashing to \nthe ground, \n&gt; not moving.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector flew up, avoiding the missile heading for him.  He raised \nhis \n&gt; thorax, firing off two stinger missiles at Sideswipe.  He fired \nthree optic \n&gt; blast from his insect optic sensors at Ratchet.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Bumblebee flew hard left, the missile missing him as well as 12 of \nthe shots \n&gt; intended for him, the rest knocking him back half a foot.  He \nraised both \n&gt; arms, firing two stinger missiles from both launchers, two at \nTorca, two at \n&gt; Sideswipe.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sixshot watched as the missile heading for him was intercepted by \nan optic \n&gt; blast.  He rolled, three shells digging into his left shin, mech-\nfluid \n&gt; leaking.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised boht weapons, firing off four hypersonic blasts at Sky \nLynx from \n&gt; his left blaster, and four of the same kind at Sideswipe from the \nother.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Ares fired off two optic blasts at the incoming shells, two \nknocking him back \n&gt; a few feet as they went off against his chest plate.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised his grenade launcher, firing a grenade at Torca.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher dodged the missile by flying fast, eight shots sending \nhim \n&gt; twisting through the air.  He raised his rifle as he balanced out \nand \n&gt; switched it to automatic fire, 20 laser bolts lancing out at Torca.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector was struck by four shells, two in the left shoulder, two \nin the \n&gt; abdomen.  He cursed as his armor was cut through.  He fired off \nfour laser \n&gt; bolts from his rifle at Tavatron.  He then fired ten rapid optic \nblasts at \n&gt; Sky Lynx.\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Minion pulled hard left in his jeep, the missile missing but \nshrapnel cut \n&gt; into his front right light, breaking it apart.\n&gt; \n&gt; He fired off twenty-four armor-piercing rounds at Sky Lynx, 12 from \neach \n&gt; cannon.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Chaos fired four five-foot long missiles at the CF, one from all \nfour of his \n&gt; missile tubes in his missile truck mode.  -Have to keep a good \nportion of my \n&gt; missiles-\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis continued crawling, spotting Blades.  He sped up his speed \nat \n&gt; crawling.\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot flew through the air, looking at the CF and the slaggin \nshields \n&gt; that had came back online.  He raised his right arm, firing off 25 \nexplosive \n&gt; shells at the CF.\n&gt; \n&gt; Raising his left arm, a missile launcher appeared from subspace.  \nHe fired \n&gt; off a rocket from the weapon of war at port side of the CF.\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Firestarter continued flying, firing off two rockets from both \nwrist \n&gt; launchers, the four missiles heading for the bridge door that had \nbeen locked \n&gt; down.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement sighed.  These heathens were irritating.  He turned \naround, raising \n&gt; both arms.  With the left barrel that made up most of his arm \nlaunched a \n&gt; missile, followed by another, heading for the armored computers.  \n&gt; \n&gt; He turned his attention to the hole in the CF from whence he came, \nfiring off \n&gt; two missiles at the hole, knowing his missiles would strike the \nshields if \n&gt; left alone.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron raised his laser rifle, firing off four bolts at the sealed \ndoor, \n&gt; followed by a single optic blast.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, in the main entry door of the CF, in its exact middle, \nthe horn \n&gt; missiles continued sending out a shock wave of sonic energy to \nweaken the \n&gt; stability of the metal around it.\n\n\n"}}
