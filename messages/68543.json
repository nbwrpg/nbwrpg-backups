Let&#39;s do a sub=\r\ntle pass.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Brody (whispering back): Right! I&#39;m switching to thermal=\r\n scan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The hot air fuming upwards effectively broke under a cooler=\r\n cushion\n&gt; &gt; that didn&#39;t move. Chop rose in the air, targeting the anomally=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; armed a magazine of tracking bullets. As he flew over it, he fired=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the whole magazine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightrazor simply watched the duo from his va=\r\nntage point. As they rose\n&gt; and searched he looked at them closely. He coul=\r\nd tell that the ship had\n&gt; no clue as to his where abouts, but these two we=\r\nre a different matter. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is only as they got closer he realized what=\r\n they were doing. The\n&gt; buffeting heat from the surface would be stalled or=\r\n redirected by his\n&gt; presence. Here in this location he could be discovered=\r\n by indirect\n&gt; means. Then his attention was caught by the click of a magaz=\r\nine being\n&gt; loaded into position. \n&gt; \n&gt; With a burst of power he shot fowar=\r\nd and up, putting as much distance\n&gt; between him and the warmth comming fro=\r\nm the surface below, even as the\n&gt; full clip of trackeing bullets were unle=\r\nashed by Chop. \n&gt; \n&gt; Strafing shots ripped into his aft armor causing pain =\r\nto flood his\n&gt; systems and his cloaking field flickered. For the briefest o=\r\nf moments\n&gt; Nightrazor&#39;s aerodynamic ebony form was revealed as he moved aw=\r\nay . . .\n&gt; and then was gone as he passed out from beneath them. \n&gt; \n&gt; For =\r\nanother moment ionized particles from his engines attracted the\n&gt; attention=\r\n of the bullets from Chop as Nightrazor pushed his engiens\n&gt; temporarilly b=\r\neyond what his cloaking shields could handle. But the\n&gt; bullets were quickl=\r\ny left behind as the ship rose further into the air\n&gt; and the cloaking fiel=\r\nd restablished its presence. \n&gt; \n&gt; Nightrazor considered firing back as he =\r\nfled, but he knew as soon as he\n&gt; completely dropped his shields the other =\r\nship would no doubt open fire,\n&gt; and he was not here for conflict. With a b=\r\noost of power, now well\n&gt; within his cloaking field&#39;s ability to mask he ro=\r\nse higher and higher\n&gt; into the air. \n&gt; \n&gt; He would either have to watch fr=\r\nom a distance or move on, he was really\n&gt; in no position to take on two def=\r\nenders plus a well armed ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Nightrazor)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n      \n____________________________________________________________________=\r\n________________\n&gt; You rock.
