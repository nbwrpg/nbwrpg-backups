McGowan, \nVirgo, Barrymore, Lee, Depp and Alba walk up behind the two.\n&gt; \n&gt; McGowan: Hey!\n&gt; \n&gt; Birdbot looks at McGowan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Birdbot: Rah rah....\n&gt; \n&gt; McGowan scoffs and ignores Birdbot.\n&gt; \n&gt; Virgo: Hey! All you sorry sons a bitches! You ready to rock!?!?\n&gt; \n&gt; Hazel walks out of her room and near the entrance. She hears \nVirgo&#39;s yelling and gasps. Her gasp was a gasp a glee and joy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hazel: Cerulean! Bronze! Come here!\n&gt; \n&gt; Cerulean and Bronze stop in the hall and walk up to Hazel.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hazel: You guys, a fight! Isn&#39;t this great!\n&gt; \n&gt; Cerulean smirks and runs off to get the others together.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bronze: This is great! Some asses to kick!\n&gt; \n&gt; Hazel: I&#39;ve been waiting for this. We&#39;ll be the firsts out there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bronze: We get the most action!\n&gt; \n&gt; Hazel: The most scars!\n&gt; \n&gt; Cerulean leads Periwinkle, Pink White and Brown over to Hazel and \nBronze.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cerulean: Ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hazel sends Periwinkle, Pink, White and Brown out first and her, \nCerulean and Bronze slowly step out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Virgo: Look at this. Look at this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Virgo laughs while pointing at Pink running towards her. Virgo \nallows Pink&#39;s shots to hit. She trips Pink and catches her. She \nbrutally beats down at Pink with one fist and spins her around, \npowerbombing her ontop of several sharp rocks. Virgo climbs to her \nfeet. Pink gasps, not able to breath form the shock and pain. She \nsquirms around, clutching at the rock impaled in her back. Hazel \nstares at Virgo&#39;s cold smile. Hazel laughs some, at the same time \nMcGowan laughs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hazel: Go.\n&gt; \n&gt; Brown begins running. Depp begins walking. Brown lets out a battle \ncry while Depp laughs some. Brown begins firing his gun at Depp as \nthey became dangerously close. Depp swings his sword. Brown stares in \nhorror as his hand drops to the ground. Depp raises a gun and shoots \nBrown in the head. He collapses. McGowan raises a hand, signaling for \nVirgo and Depp to step back. They follow her orders and stand beside \nher. Birdbot and Papertron haven&#39;t attacked yet. They were waiting \nfor Aerotaur, Nightlight and Trinity. Virgo was also waiting for that \ncertain someone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Virgo: Furry bitch furry bitch....Gonna be so frigging dead....\n&gt; \n&gt; Hazel, White and Periwinkle begin walking towards the attackers. \nBirdbot&#39;s eyes change color. Then, without warning, he flies at \nHazel. She gasps and grabs White, pulling her in front of herself, \nfor protection. Birdbot digs his talons into White&#39;s chest. After \nseveral cracks, his feet bust through White&#39;s back and start trying \nto grab Hazel, but can&#39;t reach. He rips his feet back out of White, \nsending blood flying. Hazel blocks a fleet of shots from McGowan with \nWhite before dropping her. White stares, wide eyed. Her fingers \ntwitch as she lays on the ground. Hazel looks at McGowan, whose smile \nhad brightened. Hazel runs back over to Cerulean, Bronze and \nPeriwinkle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hazel: Damn, their good. I&#39;ve got to admit that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hazel watches Lee and Barrymore brutally kick Pink and Brown while \na puddle of blood forms around White.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bronze: Maybe I&#39;ll kick ass another day...\n&gt; \n&gt; Papertron: ERF FER FER FER!...\n&gt; \n&gt; Papertron flexes while Birdbot demands Doritos...\n\n\n"}}
