Boy, I&#39;m glad there&#39;s a\n&gt; bunch of you nice folks up here. Last time I joined a game, people\n&gt; all tried to kill me off right away. Not that I don&#39;t expect some\n&gt; combat.o_O;;\n&gt;\n&gt; (IC)\n&gt; Skullhammer&#39;s huge, grey form thundered across the plains of the\n&gt; African region. His large padded feet crashed along the ground at a\n&gt; great pace, striking up a cloud of dust which encircled and trailed\n&gt; after him like a tsunami. Powerful robotic legs pushed him onwards\n&gt; towards the base, his newly formed beast mode speeding nearer and\n&gt; nearer.\n&gt;\n&gt; His robotic mind, a network of circuitry and uplink servo-chips,\n&gt; accepted an incoming message clearly across the rapidly lessening\n&gt; distance between himself and the Autobot base. As he heard the voice\n&gt; and verification of being an Autobot, his tense steel muscles\n&gt; relaxed, and he continued on his pace. Amongst the heavy footfalls of\n&gt; his massive elephant form, Skullhammer made his reply with a high\n&gt; heart.er, spark.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Greetings Autobot Commander Pacifix. This is Maximal Infantry\n&gt; Skullhammer, approaching your base&#39;s eastern side. I&#39;ve just landed\n&gt; on this planet. Most of my own sensors are offline yet.&quot; His voice,\n&gt; made up of a deep and even tonality in line with his large body, was\n&gt; clear even above the loud rumbling his four strong legs made as he\n&gt; rushed across the barren region.\n&gt;\n&gt; Skullhammer&#39;s pace quickened, shocking even him. The corded steel\n&gt; muscles of the Maximal warrior flexed underneath the pseudo-skin\n&gt; which covered him, propelling him along at speeds he didn&#39;t think\n&gt; possible for the somewhat unwieldy and sizeable form which he\n&gt; inhabited. His weighty body came closer and closer to the base until\n&gt; he was less than fifty meters.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well inside the range of the base&#39;s autocannons, Skullhammer skidded\n&gt; to a halt on a small stone ridge. The base was clearly an Autobot\n&gt; site, and was furthermore armed to the teeth, ready to unload a\n&gt; powerful and violent volley of blasts upon his metallic hide. He\n&gt; could almost picture the barrage of energy bolts and hot projectile\n&gt; fire being fired in a terrifying storm of death, and himself being\n&gt; stuck right in the center of it, if he were to make a wrong move or\n&gt; come under suspicion. His life as an Autobot told him the procedures\n&gt; Autobots followed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Speaking directly to the base now, closer in range, Skullhammer\n&gt; raised his voice in a clear opening statement. &quot;Autobots, I am\n&gt; Skullhammer, an Autobot of Cybertron sent to assist the Maximals in\n&gt; their mission here on Earth against the Predacon forces.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
