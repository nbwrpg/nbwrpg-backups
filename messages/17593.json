THe scent had become an irritating hot smell\nthat masked the others. now there was no way of knowing whether or not the\ntrainers were planning an ambush. The change in the air came from behind\nthem so it had to have been from another Maximal. If there was an ambush and\nsomeone got hurt because Lunarpine couldn&#39;t smell it there would be the pit\nto pay for the one who did this.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: RYO D &lt;striderzero1@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, October 09, 2000 2:40 PM\nSubject: Lunarpine only Warning\n\n\n&gt; ::Koj::\n&gt; Koj doesn&#39;t pay any attention to the novices opinion&#39;s of his tactics and\nis\n&gt; more concerned with Lunarpine smelling the area.
