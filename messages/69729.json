It worked at that Fortress, so it might =\r\nwork here.. My sonar transmitter.. If we can augment the frequency from my =\r\ntransmitter through the audio systems of this ship, we may just be able to =\r\nstun that minion and any others that are around the Maximal base. Of course=\r\n, being careful to program the frequency so it doesn&#39;t harm Maximals or Aut=\r\nobots... Let&#39;s see... I&#39;ve done something to that effect before... I&#39;ll do =\r\na very mild form of the sonar transmission, and let me know if any of you f=\r\neel it.&quot;\n\nLord Elder shook his head as Tuscon performed his test, he didn&#39;t=\r\n feel\nanything either\n\n&gt; Something in Tucson&#39;s directory snaps. He raises a=\r\n brow in alarm. Thoughts race through his mind and one suddenly hits him.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &quot;Wait a minute.. Lord Elder, the attack on the base.... Why would they w=\r\nant an old base when there&#39;s more to be had at the Ark? Of course... A DIVE=\r\nRSION! THEY&#39;RE PLANNING A DIVERSION SO THEY CAN GET US AWAY FROM THE ARK!&quot;\n=\r\n\nAt Tuscon&#39;s outburst, rather than being upset about it he smiled. He\nwas w=\r\nondering about Tuscon&#39;s tactical ability. This showed Elder\nsomething about=\r\n the Autobot.\n\n&quot;Good&quot; he said without turning away from the controls, &quot;You =\r\nsee not\njust what needs to be done, but the over all picture.&quot; The shuttle\n=\r\nshuddered a little as Elder spoke, but then settled back down under\nhis kno=\r\nwledgeable hands.\n\nHe glanced over at Tuscon about to say something else, w=\r\nhen  the radio\nburst to life! There was static at first and then Kup&#39;s voic=\r\ne burst\nout over the speakers.\n\n&lt;SHHH&gt; &lt;Crackle&gt; &lt;Crackle&gt;  ... this is Kup=\r\n ! What&#39;t the situation?&quot;\n\nOpening a channel to the Ark Elder replied, &quot;Qui=\r\nckstride and I have\nrescued Rat Trap and the Autobot called Tuscon.&quot; Elder =\r\npaused for a\nmoment and then continued, &quot;Also there is a Minion, one from L=\r\negacy&#39;s\nlast scan, one of immense power at the old Maximal Base. They will\n=\r\nmost likely need back up there.&quot;\n\nElder had deliberately not mentioned that=\r\n Rodimus was still captured,\nas he knew how close Kup and Rodimus were. Ins=\r\ntead he just continued,\n&quot;I will be heading back to your location, as we mus=\r\nt make sure that\nthe Ark remains safe. I will have to land the shuttle firs=\r\nt though to\naffect repairs. Our last landing was not what I had wanted.&quot;  H=\r\ne said,\nrefering to the rather abrupt landing the shuttle had made after\nfi=\r\nring on Hydras&#39; fortress. The shuttle bucked once more, but still\nmaintaine=\r\nd flight.\n\n&quot;What I need are volunteers, to go to the old base and back up L=\r\nord\nPerseus and help him defend it, or himself should he need it.&quot;\n\nLord El=\r\nder turned to look at the others on the shuttle with him,\nwondering if any =\r\nof them would also volunteer . . . .\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Lord Elder)\n\n"}}
