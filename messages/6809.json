Again, I appologise.)\n\n\n* Dinobot shook his head as he saw Prowl nearly jump at his growl, not realizing that he had approached the fowl so quietly. Not really caring to see Prowl�s frown but paying no attention to it, waiting quietly for him to relay what equipment they would need.\nBut when he heard Prowl mention that the supplies in which they needed were, in truth, located at the Cybertronien Fire he growled deeply, he had been on his way there before he had been distracted by the urgings to locate Tavatron�s location.\nHe could have simply continued towards his original course and simply had Prowl meet him alongside the new ships� supplies quarters. But instead he had come here as Prowl had instructed�only to move out again.\nThe thought of just how inconvenient that was caused him to narrow his optics at the bird-bot�s back. However, with the current situation he forced himself to remain silent, realizing that his comments weren�t needed with Prowl�s concern.\nWith silent steps he exited the Ark quickly after Prowl, simply closing the door without a thought and looking off into the distance�the direction in which the Alliance base lay in.\nIn his mind flashed events in which he could not deem possible, things in which Zardus and his crew could be doing to Tavatron in which he had never even thought possible.\nDinobot bared his teeth and the wicked thoughts, the thoughts ending abruptly with a spark snarl as his mind focused on the supplies in which they might need.\nBut as he stood there he made one promise, the bot whom caused Tavatron harm would soon feel the cold steel of his claws ripping through their robotic flesh!!!\nThen snapping his head in the direction Prowl had launched towards he then focused his attention on the mission at hand, requiring the supplies needed for a successful recovery of the two fembots.\nWasting to time Dinobot set out at a dead run, transforming into beast mode yet knowing that he would have no chance in catching up with him.\nBut then a sudden thought occurred to him as he leaped over fallen logs and brush, it seeming better and better the more he thought about it.\nProwl was a flyer and, thus, would reach the Alliance base before him if they were to leave the Maximals ship at the same time, then being forced to wait for his arrival. A process that was not acceptable, ever second counted.\nSo of Dinobot was to break off from his course and diverted towards the Alliance base he should arrive just as Prowl did, thus no time was wasted at all.\nThe distance was great and his land for could not go as fast as a flyer, they simply flew over the trees and forests he had to pick his way through.\nWith his mind then decided Dinobot then broke off from his dead run and arched towards the Alliance base as an even faster pace, not having any time to explain in the hope that Prowl would simply understand.\nBesides, knowing that he was continually getting closer to reaching Tavatron eased his concern slightly, but not enough.\nBut even though his concern was there and was always going to be until she was safe at the Cybertronien Fire, he did not show it through his appearance. The simple face was that he didn�t know HOW to express it, just as he did not know how to express the fact that it almost seemed Tavatron had become slightly more then a simple friend. \nBut such things may have been on his mind but it was mainly focused upon the task ahead, reaching the Alliance base just as Prowl did.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
