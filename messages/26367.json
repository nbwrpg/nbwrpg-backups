This had been a long, fruitless battle. They had lost more than \nthey ever hoped to gain, however, the base was still intact, though it was a \nmess. With any luck it would be fully operational within the next few weeks, \nbaring any attacks.\n\nThe gentle wind that blew across the scarred earth was oddly... disturbing. \nSomething didn&#39;t feel right. She didn&#39;t know what it was, but it was \ndefinitely there. Perhaps she was only imagining it...\n\n*You&#39;ve always had an overactive imagination.*\n\nTavatron froze. That voice was not her own. That thought was not hers, but \nthen, where did it come from?\n\n*You thought I would simply disappear? You are a fool, Tavatron.*\n\nThe dirt kicked up by the breeze settled around her. She wasn&#39;t believeing \nthis. It wasn&#39;t possible. The --other-- had been destroyed, scattered across \nspace. *SHE* was nothing but bits of information now. This wasn&#39;t happening. \nTavatron staggered as she walked, the crazed laughter echoing in her head \nunbearable. Tavatron fought to suppress it, but only managed to dull it:\n\n&quot;Go away.&quot;\n\nTavatron whispered through clenched teeth, but the voice would not oblige. \nIt rose in volume and would not let her rest. Not now, not ever. Tavatron \nwatched as the world before her became unfocused as she contnued to make her \nway towards the CF. Her steps were unsteady, but she was doing her best to \nretain her composure. No one could know about this. Not Iron Raptor, not \nProwl, no one; especially Dinobot.\n\n*****\n\nHysteria:\n\nShe opened a comm to IR. The lights in the bridge had stopped flickering, \nand hopefully wouldn&#39;t for a long time:\n\n&quot;The lockdown has been disengaged commander. Welcome back.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
