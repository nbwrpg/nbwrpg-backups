Anyway one night we met up ther=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with a couple of femme bots, one night and I tried ta play match=\r\nmaker, but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson was a bit shy around femmes.  Although he still =\r\nhad a good time with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; them, but just on a friendship basis, noth&#39;n =\r\nserious.  Well one night we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; were just hang&#39;n out, and it was befor=\r\ne I knew how good he really was on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; dance floor.  He was modest=\r\n about that too but, I dragged his aft out on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; floor and I got =\r\nhim ta bust the moves and slag did he bust some serious&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; moves out =\r\non that dance floor.  You should&#39;ve seen the looks on the faces of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n the hot rods when Tucson got his groove go&#39;n .  So I joined in on the fun&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; and we&#39;ve been best buds ever since.  For the record, he can still=\r\n bust the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; moves, and so can I.  When things calm down, I&#39;ll see wh=\r\nat I can do ta&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gather some club tunes, so we can all have some muc=\r\nh needed fun.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The ship moves, causing Nightshift to move=\r\n painfully.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ow!  I felt that.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On Sep 22=\r\n, 2011, at 9:35 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus%40gm=\r\nail.com&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightshift does his best to hold on and looks to Ramulu=\r\ns with a pleading&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; expression.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &quot; Ramulus, ya know the animal I want, could ya please make sure I =\r\nget&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for my new frame?
