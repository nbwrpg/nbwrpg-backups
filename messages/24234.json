Zardus had occationally fought \nthe Energonian in the past, and getting energy sucked out of one&#39;s \nself wasn&#39;t the greatest feeling in the world.\n\n&quot;Yes, the war has raged on though,&quot; he answers Ominous, nodding at \nAkron at the introduction.\n\n&quot;This is DevilDuer,&quot; Zardus says, gesturing toward the smaller bot \nwho was sitting at one of the far chairs.\n\n&quot;So,&quot; Zardus leans forward, looking at Ominous. He might as well cut \nto the chase, &quot;What brings you here?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Ominous takes his seat, as dose Akron. The moment was here, \narrived \n&gt; finally. It was now or never, if this meeting fell through, then \nOminous was \n&gt; going to have problems.\n&gt;        &quot;Sir, are you positive he can be trusted?&quot; Akron, ever \nsuspicious, \n&gt; asked letting her pink eyes flutter a bit. \n&gt;        Ominous nodded as Zardus entered. He got up and smiled at \nthe \n&gt; Commander, making sure not to touch him in fear he might absorb \nsome of \n&gt; Zardus&#39; energy. That wouldnt make a good start.\n&gt;        &quot;Ah, Zardus. Its been a long while, truly.&quot; He said. &quot;This \nis Akron, \n&gt; she has come with me for this meeting.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
