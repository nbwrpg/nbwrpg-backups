What ever it was appears to be gone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ahead of WHEELIE though=\r\n the track that he was following appears to\n&gt; still be there as well as the=\r\n low hum of energy that seemed to be\n&gt; present everywhere, at least in this=\r\n section of this gigantic jungle!\n&gt; \n&gt; Then dimly, almost hidden in the bac=\r\nkround noise a beacon could be\n&gt; possibly made out. It was not one that rel=\r\nied on the typical comlink\n&gt; signal, but it seemed to be on a similar frequ=\r\nency as the back ground\n&gt; hum. It was very dim and faint, as if trying to s=\r\ntay unnoticed. The\n&gt; only thing that was recognizable about it was that it =\r\nwas an Autobot\n&gt; beacon!\n&gt; \n&gt; It was further up the trail, although how muc=\r\nh further was difficult to tell!\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nAt this point, Wheel=\r\nie frowned.  An Autobot beacon, this did not make sense.  Sending a quick p=\r\nulse along his transponder, sending a quick signal to the TELETRAAN compute=\r\nr with the pinged location he was picking up the trnsponder signal from.\n\nT=\r\nhis did not seem like RODIMUS, Rodimus would be running on a Maximal freque=\r\nncy, not an Autobot one.  And if someone was attempting to use an AUTOBOT s=\r\nignal as lure for a trap, would it not be easier to use a Maximal one inste=\r\nad, given the number who had according to what LEO PRIME had said gone miss=\r\ning?\n\nAnd so, WHEELIE, after pinging his quick burst transmission over to t=\r\nhe ARK&#39;s computer banks, began to quietly go towards the transponder signal=\r\n, his energon slingshot out now in his hands and charged.\n\n\n"}}
