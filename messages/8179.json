They pulled up \n&gt; beside it, and sent a message to within.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hello? Is anyone there? This is Brix, formely known as Bronco. I \n&gt; have the spark of Octociz inside of me, and if it isn&#39;t removed \nsoon \n&gt; we will both die. It has been a hard two weeks, and our circuts are \n&gt; almost out. We are both loyal maximals, so do not think we will \nhurt \n&gt; any of you. Please, we need your help.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois sits around the embassy, and then reaches the inevitable.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It looks as if my chosen three have decided not to come. I must \n&gt; continue alone.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He sends a message to every bot on the planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Everyone, listen. Maximal, Predacon, Alliance or any other \nfaction, \n&gt; listen. This is Vulois. We have all been fighting a stupid war. \n&gt; Cybertron is crumbling, and we are the only ones who can save it. I \n&gt; know, because I have recently been inside The Matrix. I have felt \n&gt; it&#39;s despair. The only way we can rebuild Cybertron is if we all \n&gt; unite, as one. We harness the energon together, and than return to \n&gt; Cybertron and unify everyone under beast modes. Please, I beg of \nyou, \n&gt; come to my co-ordinates and join in the very first Embassy meeting. \n&gt; You many not want to come yet. I can understand. But please think \n&gt; about it. Even if you here what we have to say, you don&#39;t have to \n&gt; follow it. Please, just come and listen.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He sits and waits.\n\n\n"}}
