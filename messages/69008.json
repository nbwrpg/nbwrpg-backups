It was pretty much as he had expected. He looked over at Shard to see his reactions the offer to meet Hydras. \n\n&gt; For a moment, Shard was as still as he was silent, obviously churning\n&gt; over his choices as he stared at Myrmidon.  After a few seconds, he\n&gt; nodded and followed Myrmidon to the shuttle. \n\nThe trip to the shuttle was short and relatively uneventful. The path they took was littered with burnt out sweeps, and  the ground itself was churned and scorched from the fire of many weapons. The smell of smoke and burning circuits hung heavy in the air, even as the skies above began to darken portending some coming storm. \n\nMyrmidon led Shard up to Hydras, &quot;Sir!&quot; The word was most distasteful in his mouth, but he spoke it anyway. &quot;This is Shard, newly minted from a stasis pod . . . &quot; Myrmidon turned to look at Shard, &quot; . . . at least so he claims.&quot;\n\n(TAG: Shard, Hydras)\n\n\nPreston\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
