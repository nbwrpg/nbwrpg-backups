Not was not the time and place to \nfight over hurt pride. She looked to Blackstorm.  &quot;Learn well the \nlessons learned. Oh, and yes, we may be on the same side. We may have \nthe same purpose and goal as Predacons. But, as true to your \nprogramming, pick your friends carefully. Keep your friends close but \nkeep your enimies closer.&quot;  She turned and walked out, but not before \nglaring at Maxima. This one would be a problem. For one, she assumed \na command without reguard for the purpose of others. For one to be an \neffective leaer, one had to use the strong points of all below them \nto thier advantage. This one however, was more selfcentered. She \nwould not live long enough to be of consiquence to her. She walked to \nthe entrance of the base and transformed into wolf mode. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt; In a message dated 4/24/03 1:17:01 AM Central Daylight Time, \n&gt; raccoon7679@y... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; With lightening fast reflexes, she turned, jumped the ring roped \nin \n&gt; &gt; one leap, and ran towards Maxima. &quot;YOU! You do not raise your \nvoice \n&gt; &gt; to me young one. I do not care who you think you are. You will \nshow \n&gt; &gt; the proper respect. I am the trainer here. You are the \ninterloper. If \n&gt; &gt; you want to play games, then leave and do your programming \n&gt; &gt; elsewhere.&quot; she said, growling. Her optics red with fury, and the \nfur \n&gt; &gt; on the back of her neck standing up. &quot;You will learn your place \nyoung \n&gt; &gt; one. In the pack, there is an order. And in that order, I am your \n&gt; &gt; supior officer.&quot;  She took a step back to recompose herself. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a more steady and lightly softer tone. &quot;You, young one are \nclever, \n&gt; &gt; smart and well knowledged. But you have yet to really learn how \nto \n&gt; &gt; use this talent to it&#39;s fullest potential. When you have, then \nyou \n&gt; &gt; shall be leader. Untill then, I am still higher ranked. You will \nshow \n&gt; &gt; the rank respect if not the bot. Much like Hydras. He has my \nloyalty \n&gt; &gt; and respect. And I shall show that to all who are around me. You \nwill \n&gt; &gt; do well to do the same.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She turned and went back to the ring. Her arm still holding her \n&gt; &gt; stomach.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Maxima&#39;s optics glowed. But she would not scrap the bot who just \nseriously \n&gt; insulted her. &quot;It is you who have crossed the line. Hydras deserves \nmy \n&gt; loyalty for many reasons. YOU however,&quot; her voice still eriely calm \nbut \n&gt; obviously there was hint that she did not appreciate what KitKat \njust did, \n&gt; &quot;underestimate me. I am by NO means young. I would be surprized \nthat you \n&gt; would be older than I. Rodimus himself is much younger than I. \n#2... \n&gt; Perceptor has placed ME in charge of Blackstorm. I do believe that \nyou have \n&gt; over stepped your bounds. If I am correct, I don&#39;t recall Hydras \ngiving you a \n&gt; superior ranking let alone charge. Flicker has charge of this \nplace. As does \n&gt; Perceptor. Now... if you will so kindly step aside & allow me \nfinish \n&gt; Blackstorm&#39;s programming.&quot; Her crimson optics glared at Kitkat. She \nknew at \n&gt; the beginning that this one would be a problem. She was right. So \nmany \n&gt; wanting so much. Sounded far too familiar. Sounded much like \nStarscream.\n\n\n"}}
