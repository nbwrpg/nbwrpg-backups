He disappeared almost a century ago. Some thought he\nhad been defeated in some battle, perhaps assasinated by an up and\ncomming Predacon. But yet here he was finally resurfacing after five\ndecades here on old Earth.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Walking along with the three, he nodded, &quot;Perhaps, that is the way I shall\n&gt; go.  As they say, the more I shall know.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Walking along&lt; &quot;And I am sorry you came from Magmatron.  He is a terror that\n&gt; let much on.  I must apologize for what he made you this day, I am thankful\n&gt; you were able to get away.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Walking along wtih them towards the mysterious unit that they had mentioned\n&gt; who had told of thier origins, and watching around quietly.  The presence of\n&gt; Magmatron and the unit he had not heard of desginate Saberback would be\n&gt; filed away in his processor, as soon as he was out of this strange null zone\n&gt; of communications to be broadcast back to the Maximal command staff present.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from UNUS, &quot;It is not your fault.&quot; he said solemly.\n&quot;But that which does not terminate us only gives us strength.&quot; There\nwas a quiet dignity in him as he moved. For some reason, even though\nhe was the same body design and structure as the rest he was larger\nand robust, his armor a bit thicker from the look of it. His movements\nwere one of a soldier, long used to the art of war, much like the\nothers who walked with them.\n\n&quot;We have not learned much from your friend.&quot; FIREHORN said as they\nwalked, his words more gruff and clipped. &quot;But he seemed to be be made\nof sturdy material. &quot;He came in heavilly wounded and yet he was still\nable to talk, even if just a little.&quot;\n\nASTRA nodded, &quot;It was Firehorn who found him.&quot; She said. &quot;We brought him here.&quot;\n\nThey stopped at a door with medical syumbology recognizable on it. At\nUNUS&#39; gesture the door slid open.\n\nInside was a very spartan room. The walls were plain and ulitarian,\npainted a single offwhite color. There was a small console on one side\npresumably for the medical staff to use. There was a small viewscreen,\na single recharging chamber and medical bed.\n\nHowever on the bed was a single figure, his optics dull but definitely\nonline as he focused on WHEELIE. &quot;I thought it would be Tuscon coming\nfor me.&quot; he said groggilly as if he had just come out of a long sleep.\n&quot;But I am glad it is you.&quot; His voice clearing as he spoke.\n\nHe sat up on the medbed, painted in oranges, reds and golds he was the\npicture of leadership and yet even when recovering there was still a\npower within him, an energy or fire that could not wholly quenched.\n\nIt was RODIMUS PRIME.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
