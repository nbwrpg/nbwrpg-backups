When Ignatius \nflew down low, Prebon lifted Spears off his back.\n\n&quot;You were wondeful! I can&#39;t believe how good you are!&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Hammer arrvied at K9&#39;s position.\n\n&quot;There is no way you are following us, Maximal! DIE!&quot;\n\nHammer opened a panel on his arm, and pulled out a grenade. He \npressed the button and laucnhed it. He got his plasma rifle ready \njust incase this bot survived the blast.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois stepped in front of Child.\n\n&quot;Hold on Child. You have just learned this power. Too much use before \ntraining could cause an overload, killing yourself in the process.&quot;\nVulois than went into a fighting stance an looked at AngelNemesis.\n\n&quot;I, on the other hand, have been training my power for months, and \nknow my limitations. Now Nemesis, watch the power of good triumph \nover evil!&quot;\n\nVuloic concentrated, and formed an energy sword in his hand. It \nglowed with all the light of the heavens.\n\n&quot;Good-bye, Nemesis.&quot;\n\nVulois charged, repeadidly slashing with the sword.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix nodded.\n\n&quot;All right. You can count on us.&quot; He than turned to the rest of the \ngroup. \n\n&quot;All right guys. Let&#39;s give Ramulus room to think. Let&#39;s install the \nnew computer boards so we can maybe get this thing up and running.&quot;\n\nBrix and Fliq picked up Computer boards and carried them inside.\n\n\n"}}
