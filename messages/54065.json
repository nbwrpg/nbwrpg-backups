In fact, I never\neven realized Riekan had shot at her, but that was my mistake and I\nwill mention that the harpoon sticks out from her in the next few\nposts. The thing, though, is that even at point blank range, you can&#39;t\nsay that Riekan headbutts her *successfully* and that, as a\nconsequence, the harpoon twists her guts even more. She could just let\ngo and fall back under the heabutt which would result in limited\ndamages or try to dodge while still in place, or something, but the\nway I see it, you dealt damage to Dread and I had no choice but to\naccept.
