Also later I&#39;m going to need a few \nTable&#39;s set up so that if I have to reprogram any other bots I can do \nso. But, I have one question for you, Will you be my Partner? I could \nuse somebody to watch my back and from the work I seen you do, You \ncould use someone to watch yours.&quot; But of corse that wasn&#39;t the only \nreason why Scorponok wanted to be parterns, He wanted to be partners \nso he could be close to her.\n\n\n"}}
