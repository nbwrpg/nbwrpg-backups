We started out at the Ark, \n&gt; but no matter how hard we tried, we couldnt keep it standing with the \n&gt; constant attacks by various factions and it was destroyed.  By that time the \n&gt; CF, which was at that time the most powerful Maximal battle cruiser was on \n&gt; Earth and everybody moved there.  It suffered pretty much the same fate as \n&gt; the ark, and here we are, Maximal City.\n&gt; Sideswipe: yeah, reminds me of the time back in the Great War when we pretty \n&gt; much left the Ark and moved to Metroplex.  But we haven&#39;t been doing well at \n&gt; all since all the factions started trying to destroy us.\n&gt; Orion: I got the feeling things are going to get better. Whose idea was this \n&gt; city thing?\n\n\n"}}
