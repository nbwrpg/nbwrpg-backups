He had not meant to offend the bot::\nWindrazor:  I am sorry, I am a little angry about Soundwave&#39;s demise.  I only \nmeant that the Alliance will not listen to you.  Soundwave was probably the \ngreatest Decepticon ever.  He broke the mold of the cold murderous type that \ntoo many cons are today.  I wholeheartedly want to help your cause and stop \nthis war.  And my men will need some convincing, but soon they will \nunderstand as well.  If it makes you feel better, Me and my men will single \nhandedly convince the alliance to accept your bid.\n::He had said his piece, now he just needed an answer: would Vulois accept \nhim and put this misunderstanding behind him?  Or would he have to fend for \nhimself?\n\n"}}
