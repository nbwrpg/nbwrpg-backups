Granted my early posts were stupid and\nnonexistant, but the council (Yan to be more exact)\nsaid I kept &quot;pushing my point&quot;, when in reality I kept\ncoming up with new reasons (really poor excuses) why I\nwas o.k. and everyone else kept pushing the same point\nof &quot;you can&#39;t do that&quot; I deserved at the time to be\nmoderated, but he was doing under false pretense, he\nshould have at least got the grammar right for the\npost where he said he moderated me\n\n2.  Not one single council member ever said &quot;you need\nto write an intro or your chars don&#39;t exist&quot; they\ncomplained about the individual posts, but never said\nI couldn&#39;t just have a char pop up out of nowhere and\nknow everything about every other character, and be\nestablished members of the Maximals, until much later,\nit was the other rpers who said that.\n\n--- x_rauq_x &lt;x_rauq_x@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ooC: Aight, I would have posted, but my comp crashed\n&gt; and I lost a \n&gt; big long Megatron post, so I kinda threw it out the\n&gt; window (not \n&gt; literally of course, if I actually HAD thrown it out\n&gt; the window, i&#39;d \n&gt; need to buy a new one, and I can&#39;t afford that).\n&gt; *sigh*\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I kinda stabbed myself in the foot about the\n&gt; magneto-shells \n&gt; thing. I was intending to change some of the rules\n&gt; (after a council \n&gt; review) thus legalizing EMP (to a degree), seeking\n&gt; missiles, and \n&gt; perhaps flash bombs.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was also a little overwhelming to see 60 posts in\n&gt; less than two \n&gt; days when i logged on to post for Megatron (the post\n&gt; i lost in the \n&gt; comp crash). Posts are supposed to last a very short\n&gt; amount of time. \n&gt; In battles, since there are many people involved,\n&gt; role players \n&gt; should not just keep posting, but wait for the rest\n&gt; of the RPG to \n&gt; catch up. In the 60 posts several new characters\n&gt; were introduced at \n&gt; the Predacon base, and a bunch of other stuff\n&gt; happened, while \n&gt; Megatron &#39;lagged out&#39;. =P Just a reminds to keep an\n&gt; eye on those \n&gt; things.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cardhead, When Azure suggested you hold your\n&gt; posting, you should \n&gt; hold your posting. He&#39;s not a moderator just so he\n&gt; can stand around \n&gt; and look pretty. Moderators are to be listened too,\n&gt; that way \n&gt; mistakes or misconceptions can be picked up and\n&gt; fixed before \n&gt; anything disasterous happens (we hope anyway). =)\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly, I&#39;d like to congratulate people on the\n&gt; excellent posting \n&gt; that I read while I was busy catching up. ^^\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
