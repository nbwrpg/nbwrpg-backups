After a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; moment =\r\nhe nodded, &quot;Cuffs.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Turning back to TUSCON the dino pulle=\r\nd out what were obviously stassis&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cuffs and was about to place the=\r\nm on the submissive TUSCON as the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; other dinosaurs grinned from bea=\r\nstmode.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; GRIMLOCK merely looked on sternly, still having h=\r\nis laser rifle&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; pointed at TUSCON.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end g=\r\nroup email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-86--498947930--\r\n\n"}}
