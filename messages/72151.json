At the inside of\n&gt; the door there were two other figu=\r\nres that looked like FIREHORN and\n&gt; ASTRA, atleast in basic construction an=\r\nd form. They both also had\n&gt; large axes that were held straight up in cerim=\r\nonial fashion, both\n&gt; hands grasping them firmly.\n&gt; \n&gt; They nodded as FIREH=\r\nORN and ASTRA, who nodded back, their movements\n&gt; strangly regal and dignif=\r\nied.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Unus is in here.&quot; ASTRA said to WHEELIE as she gestured for him =\r\nto\n&gt; come inside with them, no longer attempting to use his ryming speech.\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWHEELIE did not react over to the parroting of his own mannerisms,=\r\n merely explaining, &quot;Where I come from, this is what saved my bum.
