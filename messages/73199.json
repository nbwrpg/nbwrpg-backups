It took only a few moments, for them to knock do=\r\nwn the rest&lt;br&gt;of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SKYBYTE looked around, and seeing all of his=\r\n soldiers dead quickly&lt;br&gt;back pedaled from DINOBOT as he dropped his blade=\r\n and raced back&lt;br&gt;towards MAGMATRON!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; T=\r\nhe bats retreat as they return to their roosts. Then, something that&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; Magmatron said sparks an idea in Tucsons directory. What if he could&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; actually give Magmatron the grand illusion and make it appear that he&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; would turn on his comrades while in reality pulling off the most&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; strategic illusion of betrayal and winning his faction a very&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nstrategic victory?
