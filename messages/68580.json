First it was the greens and sandy browns of their\nsmall island retreat, and then it became the ever present and pristine\nazure blues of the oceans. Eventually this gave way to the varying hues\nof browns, oranges and greens of land as they cut through the skies\nover it, birds scattering in alarm at the thunderclap of their passing!\n\nFinally though in the distance a mountain can be seen, one that grew\nswiftly larger as they approached. Beneath the moving vehicles the\nground grew more and more rocky and course as they approached their\ngoal. Even as they drew ever closer the view of the aft end of a ship\ncould be made out, poking out of the side of mountain. \n\nContinuing on their approach Decibel gleefully launched forward, her\njets not only brightening but also becoming louder as she pushed them\nhard and fast. She wanted to be first to reach the goal and she wasn�t\ngoing to let anything stand in her way. \n\nThe others of course followed suit, pushing their engines to the limit.\nFinally the distance to the goal shrank from miles to meters as they\nsped in, weapons going hot, cannons ready to rip into the seemingly\nvulnerable ark!! \n\n**CCRRAAKKTHOOOM!!**\n\nJust as they came into range a rather large coruscating beam fired out\nfrom the ground below, just within the confines of the ark. The beam\nwas intense as it cut into the incoming minions! \n\nWith the unerring aim it caught Deepstryke near dead center; shards of\nmetal and armor were ripped from his form. It was only his internal\nfortitude and the insane amounts of armor that he possessed that\nstopped him from going into immediate stasis lock. As it was his\nsmoking form trailed from the skies as he spun towards the ground.\n�Minions attack �. � he commanded weakly as he fell to the ground.\n\nBelow a black futuristic tank with crimson highlights hovered out into\nview. Quickly it shifted form and looked upward, its form and visage\ndisturbingly familiar to those who know their history. The cyclopean\ngaze, the right arm sporting dual mounted cannons, the left arm that IS\na cannon. Despite the color changes it looked like SHOCKBLAST!! \n\nWho ever it is, it stood below them, and began to fire upwards at the\nincoming minion!\n\n(Tag Darkfate & Nightstrike)\n\nOOC: I would assume that the Autobots/Maximals have some sort of alarm\nsystem here at the ark, since on the show they did do a lot to guard\nit?? If they do then it began to go off, and then abruptly stopped!\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
