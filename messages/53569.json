He had to assist her. He just had to. She felt \ninferior \n&gt; with out her amazing abilities to detect things from long \ndistances. \n&gt; Another thing was that she had to get to the Ark. She felt that she \n&gt; had to protect it. \n&gt; \n&gt; But before she would go to the Ark, she would find these bases. \n&gt; \n&gt; Racing a different direction, which seemed forever to her. In her \njet \n&gt; form, she would be able to cover distances in mere hours. In his \n&gt; form, she couldn&#39;t. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her first task would be to &#39;convince&#39; Wheeljack to recreate her \nform. \n&gt; \n&gt; Soon enough, she reached the wreckage. Amazing enough, it didn&#39;t \nseem \n&gt; that any one had noticed her arrival other than Wheeljack, Ragnar, \n&gt; Empath, Windlord & another. Seemed they gave her no thought. Which \n&gt; was fine with her. As long as they stayed far from her & left her \n&gt; alone. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wheeljack?&quot; She padded inside the wreck. &quot;Wheekjack?!&quot;\n\n&quot;Over here!&quot; he calls from under a console.
