The reason I decided to put \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;poll up was because me and Alloran got to speaking, and he said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;because Bombshell was in the fore ground during the scene, he \n&gt;thought\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it was him. I wanted to see what you thought, but I dont know if \n&gt;you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;all understood the question. There was no right or wrong awnser, as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the writers never stated who it was. The popular opinion on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;internet was that it was Skywarp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
