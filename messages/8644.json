If there is any more fighting then there \nmay be no hope for our mission. Soundwave, try and talk Zardus into a \npeaceful settlement, a truce if you will. If that doesn&#39;t work, then \njust tell him you are on a peace mission, and will not fight any \nmore. Hide behind something and only fire at if you are fired upon. \nVulois out.&quot;\n\nHe went back to work on the embassy.\n\n\n"}}
