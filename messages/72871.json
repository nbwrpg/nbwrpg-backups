I remember when we met, and I said I would owe you a debt.  While we\n&gt; were on the planet of Quintesson, fighting off the wild Sharkticon.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing up at the seemingly rage imbued GRIMLOCK, WHEELIE continued, afraid\n&gt; fo what had happened, &quot;To what happened ot you, I do not know, all I fear is\n&gt; your tale of woe.  I am sorry, for what was begot, that at your side as I\n&gt; said I would be, I was not.  For if hate was inflicted upon you, for which I\n&gt; would quake..  Then I will pay the penance for what was inflicted uponyou,\n&gt; if eased your spark you would be then be make.&quot;\n\nGRIMLOCK paused as he looked at WHEELIE a certain level of recognition\nappearing in his optics for a moment. &quot;Wheelie?&quot; He said as he tilted\nhis head at the AUTOBOT who was less than half his size.\n\nBehind GRIMLOCK the roars of the approaching DINOBOTS were coming\ncloser and with that sound GRIMLOCK&#39;s optics once again started to\ndarken. &quot;Wheelie Friend!&quot; he bellowed loudly as if trying to command\nhimself to remember that, but it was obvious that GRIMLOCK was loosing\nsome internal battle.\n\nGRIMLOCK raised his head roared at the skies in frustration and anger,\nthe sound of it echoing across the landscape. However the optics that\nGRIMLOCK turned back on WHEELIE were not the ones of a friend, they\nwere ones of a raging monster!\n\nGRIMLOCK roared again as he stepped towards WHEELIE his jaws opened wide!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
