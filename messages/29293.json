He received Squawktalk&#39;s transmission. &quot;I&#39;m\n&gt; not sure what you should do, tell me what you see there&quot; he said calmly.\nHe\n&gt; looked to the new Decepticon. &quot;How did you arrive on earth?&quot; He questions\n&gt; Stratus.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
