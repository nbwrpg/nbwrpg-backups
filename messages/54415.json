What good is loyalty to someone who would feed \n&gt; &gt; dozens \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of loyal followers to Unicron just to save his own miserable \n&gt; &gt; hide?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras only cares about himself.  He wants to rule the \nuniverse, \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it doesn&#39;t matter to him what happens to anyone else along \nthe \n&gt; &gt; way.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She smirked. Only listening for now. &#39;typical&#39; she thought. It \nwas \n&gt; &gt; all too \n&gt; &gt; &gt; familiar. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Empath digs a little further into Maxima&#39;s mind, bringing the \n&gt; &gt; memory \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of that kiss to the forefront.  &quot;If you bought it, he&#39;d only \nbe \n&gt; &gt; upset \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because he lost his newest plaything.  He&#39;s using you, \nMaxima.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stopping for a moment as she stared at Empath. &quot;So much for \n&gt; &gt; technology. It&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not as good as the old Cybertronian technology we were once \nequiped \n&gt; &gt; with.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then she continued on walking beside Empath. &quot;Obviously. But \n&gt; &gt; Galvatron did \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that a lot as well, Empath.&quot; Glancing sideways as her. &quot;Or did \nyou \n&gt; &gt; forget \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that already?&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Continuing to walk in her feline state. &quot;I&#39;ve noticed much of \n&gt; &gt; Galvatron in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him. However, I&#39;m like Megatron... I belong to no body. I have \nmy \n&gt; &gt; own \n&gt; &gt; &gt; objectives. Remember.. the only one I obey & will follow \nwithout \n&gt; &gt; question... \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is Megatron.&quot; Her voice reflected the memories of the painful \nyet \n&gt; &gt; joyous \n&gt; &gt; &gt; past. Then she laughed. &quot;Besides,&quot; she smirked,&quot; I am not that \neasy \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; destroy.&quot; Living this long, proved that. She always made it \n&gt; &gt; through, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; surviving... until the next battle. &quot;If Hydras has any of \n&gt; &gt; Megatron&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; memories, then he should know me by now.&quot; pausing a \n&gt; &gt; moment. &quot;Whatever \n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened between Hydras & I... was a mere fabrication of ... \n&gt; &gt; organic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; emotions. Which... I am immune to.&quot; she only looked ahead of \n&gt; &gt; her. &quot;The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; closest to such organic weaknesses that I have, is my loyalty \nto \n&gt; &gt; Megatron.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pausing yet again. &quot;In which I have nearly lost my own \nfunctioning \n&gt; &gt; ability \n&gt; &gt; &gt; due to someone&#39;s foolish desire to depose him. I... getting in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; way.. to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; protect him... serve him...&quot; she trailed off.. it was more like \nshe \n&gt; &gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; muttering. Why she was &#39;pouring out her heart&#39; to Empath was \n&gt; &gt; something she \n&gt; &gt; &gt; never done. perhaps,.. it was this organic part of her. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Let him try to use me. He&#39;ll be greatly disappointed.&quot; She \n&gt; &gt; growled, sounding \n&gt; &gt; &gt; just like she was in the old days at the beginning of the Great \nWar.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Empath laughs.  &quot;You&#39;re as immune to emotions as a wet iron bar \nis to \n&gt; &gt; rust,&quot; she taunts.  &quot;You&#39;ll be sleeping with that egotistical \n&gt; &gt; scrapheap before you know it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She cocked a brow & glanced at her. The statement was familiar \nuntil she \n&gt; checked her data banks to know what it meant. Then she stopped & \ngrowled. \n&gt; &quot;Hardly!&quot; Her claws digging into the ground. &quot;I won&#39;t subject \nmyself to \n&gt; such... organic nonsense.&quot; She stepped over towards a bluff over \nlooking a \n&gt; tall cliff with a wide river below. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sitting down on the bluff, &quot;Power before pleasure, Empath.&quot; then \nshe glanced \n&gt; back at the old Seeker, &quot; Or have you forgotten all that?&quot; She \ngazed at \n&gt; Empath, sondering if she had become too soft, if being around \nanimals & \n&gt; Autobots has made her once hard Decepticon exocover as soft as the \nground she \n&gt; stood upon.\n\n&quot;Look who&#39;s talking; I didn&#39;t take time out from a mission to make \nout with my boyfriend,&quot; Empath snorts.  &quot;In case you didn&#39;t notice, I \ndidn&#39;t have too much trouble getting past Hydras&#39;s little defensive \nimpant - would you like to find out just how much my power has \nincreased?&quot;  Maxima is treading on thin ice; at this close range, \nEmpath could do just about anything she wants with her friend&#39;s \nneural circuitry.  &quot;You fell for him like a brick, Maxima - there&#39;s \nno overriding your emotion chips anymore, like we used to before the \nGreat Reformat.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
