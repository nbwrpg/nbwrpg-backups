Gatara turns, her massive, quasi-reptilian form \nlooming over everything here.\n\n&quot;Hello, Noir,&quot; she says.  &quot;Welcome back to the land of the living.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; -- Noir --\n&gt; \n&gt; Noir steps out of the now useless stasis chamber&#39;s chair. Her \njoints \n&gt; were a little unused from the long period of unawareness, but she \n&gt; ignored that problem. Use would wear them in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Noir.&gt; The word, or perhaps name, still remains part of her \npassive \n&gt; thoughts, sitting in the back of her mind like an unmistakeable \n&gt; signature of her passing. &quot;Noir.&quot; Her soft cold voice says quietly \n&gt; to nobody in particular as she excercises her joints momentarily to \n&gt; ensure their ability to function.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her hands absent mindedly slide into specific locations, her right \n&gt; had on her right hip, and her left had behind her back. Pistols pop \n&gt; out of hidden slots, and she fingers them gingerly, looking them \n&gt; over slowly before putting them back.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her eyes scan the room, and rest on a mid sized table which has a \n&gt; electronic device sitting on it in the middle of the room. \n&gt; Cautiously, she walks over to the table, but before she can \n&gt; touch the device, an interactive hologram flickered into existance \n&gt; above it. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Noir.&quot; The image said. &quot;Welcome to the Rogues base of the moment.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Noir eyes the holo warily, &quot;... Keep talking.&quot; The image then \n&gt; strikes her memmory, and she seems to remmeber this figure... \n&gt; Devilcat, the Rogue leader.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You are to contact the active rogues immediately for your current \n&gt; orders. And try not to delay.&quot; The image finished.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Shoulda had something more... important to say... oh well&gt; She \n&gt; checks to see that she has everything, then quietly leaves the \nroom. \n&gt; Her memory showed her where everything was located. It seemed that \n&gt; she&#39;d been here before for a long time, and knew it like the back \nof \n&gt; her hand. Knowing this, she made the trip to the control room as \n&gt; quick as possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unafraid of running into any other bots, she walks right into the \n&gt; control and communications room, her eyes scanning the room right \n&gt; from the instant she had entered.\n&gt; \n&gt; (is there anyone in the Rogue base? or is Noir going to have to \n&gt; contact the others.)\n\n\n"}}
