&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Neverl will exist a program that works like that&quot;hissed Perceptor&quot;I tried\n&gt; do it with Nightlight and Rodimus and both remembered the emotional bond\n&gt; among them... Rodimus fully remembered and Nighlight... well she still \n&gt; love\n&gt; him eventhoug she doesnt remember him fully... It seems that some emotions\n&gt; are hard to forget&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; After few seconds he said&quot;I tought that we will wipe out her corrupted\n&gt; programs not her memories&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy paused in his typing as he turned to face Perceptor, &quot;A program\nthat would delete only the personality subroutines and yet leave the\nmemories intact is beyond our currently abilities to create at least\nin this short period of time and with our current circumstances.&quot;\n\n&quot;Personality and memory are reciprocal processes in that one affects\nthe other.&quot; Legacy continued his single optic pulsing in a thoughtful\nmanner, &quot;We are all created with standard values, some mutable and\nsome nearly immutable. However what we process, learn and remember\naffects these values, and in turn the affect of these changes alters\nhow we process and learn new things in the future.&quot;\n\nLegacy looked at Perceptor as he tilted his head, &quot;To change one\nwithout changing the other would be an incredibly precarious process.&quot;\nLegacy paused again, obviously thinking, &quot;It is possible that is why\nyou have met with only limited success. attempting to delete the\npersonality without a complete deletion of the underlying memories\nwhich actually drove the personality allowed for corruption to set in\nas her core matrix attempted to revive the lost bits of personality\nand factional allegiance.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
