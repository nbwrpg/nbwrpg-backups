It was an attemp to get Nightlight back. Problem is in \nmy personal point of view, that regarding that she&#39;s reprogramed... \nshe won&#39;t came here voluntary, even perhaps she would try to resist \nand fight... So,... it&#39;s dificult to say... Practically... we have \nto kidnape her...&quot;\n\nWindlord felt in silence a while and encourage himself and \ncontinue &quot;I practically suggested Battera (That&#39;s voluntary&#39;s name) \nto sedat her and take her off the base... If that disgust you I&#39;m \nsorry, sir, but we have to get her withour harm for her and us... &quot;\n\nWindlord tried to set in order his ideas and spoke once more &quot;Lately \nI was thinking that would be dificult to broke for Battera the \ndefences and hide them of scaners while she scape with Nightlight... \nSo I was thinking that she has to do the same that Flicker did: \nBattera could deceive Nightlight and convince her to left the \nPredacon&#39;s territory and in a point, far of Preds, capture \nNightlight and bring her to base... That lead us to other point: \nafter the capture, what should we do? We can&#39;t let Nightlight be \nfree here and I guess that you don&#39;t like see her inside a cell, but \nI guess that reporgramation might take a lot time if that scum named \nPerceptor told the true about that program... That&#39;s all, Sir, If I \ndid something wrong when I suggest Battera sedate Nightlight, I&#39;m \nsorry... I was thinking in her safely and ours...&quot;\n\nWindlord looked to Rodimus, while Elita was drinking happily her \nenergon.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; Rodimus smiled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Yes, this Elita.
