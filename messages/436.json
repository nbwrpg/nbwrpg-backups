He didn&#39;t like it, but then he wasn&#39;t the one who \ncalled the shots around here.\nHe growled again then dug his claw into the surface of the table...*\n\n&quot; So, we not only have to watch our backs on the battle field but in the \nBase as well?!&quot;\n\n* He had no idea why Liono would let such a bot into their ranks but he knew \none thing for sure, if that bot even came near Tavatron or himself he&#39;d \nsquish &#39;em! Dinobot had learned one very important thing while he fought in \nthe earlier Beast Wars, never trust an arachnid! Especially one that was \ncloned from Tarantulus himself!\nHe sank his claw deeper into the metal of the table, what was this planet \ncoming to?*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
