The move over\n&gt; was a classic Metallikido charge, his long blade arm up and over his head\n&gt; then for a powerful downward swing.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, the swing would be a decoy, intent on drawing ANTAGONY&#39;s guard upwards,\n&gt; where the true blow would land - in this case, a powerful forward kick!\n&gt;\n&gt; And if she was moving to dodge the kick then or would try and evade to the\n&gt; side, then power would change over to the sweep of the clawed tail-sword to\n&gt; use it&#39;s superior range and buzzsaw properties to lash out at her while she\n&gt; was on the defensive!\n&gt;\n&gt; As well as with a slight backup motion now where if he was engaged in\n&gt; grappling her at close range or she would try and match him strength for\n&gt; strength of trying to shoot his otpic blasts into her face!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n[BAD-AFT}\n\nThere is only one word that can describe the speed, power and skill\nthat was brought to bear on DINOBOT!\n\nIt was is she could read his mind, or better yet, as if she knew every\nmove he was about to make before he made it. Spin, dodge, duck, block,\nfeint!\n\nShe move and stuck with such lighting speed and agility that was\ndifficult to follow never mind match! Leaping through the air as a\nblade seemed to flash out from no where and block DINOBOT&#39;s attack!\nShe flew back with a defensive kick as she moved.\n\nShe was both defense and offense moving with a strange fluid grace!\n\nLanding on the ground several meters behind where she stood before her\nblade now in her right hand spinning as she readied it, ANTAGONY\noriented her blaster at DINOBOT with her left!\n\nANTAGONY looked at the others, &quot;Are you guys idiots! I tell you that\nyour universe is about to tear apart and you want to capture me?&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot; CRYOTEK said. &quot;After all, we cannot know what other\nsecrets you are hiding from us.&quot; He manipulated a device in his hand,\nthe very same one he used to shut down TARANTULUS&#39; weaponry a few\nmoments ago. &quot;Such as how to turn such a thing to our own advantage.&quot;\n\nBehind ANTAGONY a pair of steel cables began to snake forward with\nmanacles opened up as if to capture her. However at the moment\nANTAGONY did not appear to be aware of as her focus seemed to be on\nDINOBOT as she watched him for another attack!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
