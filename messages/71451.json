At thi=\r\ns time he felt there was no time to actually deal with enemy forces and hav=\r\ning one directly in the same room was not good, but at the same time, this =\r\npredacon wasn&#39;t making any moves to attack anyone, as he could rightfully s=\r\nense.  Yet, his pressense does make him uneasy.  \n\n&quot; Leo Prime, have the Ar=\r\nk checked for loopholes in our security system, if this predacon was able t=\r\no breach our system there may be a chance  that others could slip easilly b=\r\ny our security system. We can&#39;t afford to have our operations compromised, =\r\nnot now. And where the pit is Rodimus?&quot;\n\nStraight Shot makes it back in the=\r\n room, as Tucson asks the question.\n\n&quot; He&#39;s trying to find Wheelie.&quot;\n\nTucso=\r\nn nodds.\n\n&quot; Of course, but does it have to take that long?  Anyway, Leo Pri=\r\nme, given the situation at hand, which you have described as rightfully imi=\r\nnent, we will have to do everything in our power to be sure that this plane=\r\nt is kept undesturbed, and left as Nature intended it to evolve.  But in or=\r\nder to do that, we need an energy supply to boost the Ark&#39;s systems, and ri=\r\nght now we don&#39;t have that, but, we will if we take Quickstride&#39;s proposal =\r\ninto consideration.  Energy is everything but at the same time, we do not w=\r\nant to steal from this planet, when we can actually develop ways to produce=\r\n our own by working with it rather than against it.  Perceptor brought up a=\r\n very valid point as well.  Hydras did have access to power, but unlike Qui=\r\nckstride&#39;s method of harnessing it, he just left it to go out of control, a=\r\nnd look where that got him.  We have the upper hand, a means to work with a=\r\n natural resource that is less harmful to some degree, and will not risk an=\r\ny danger to our lives and those that reside on this planet.  Now, as soon a=\r\ns Rodimus gets here, I&#39;d like Quickstride to explain and show all of us, th=\r\ne project he&#39;s working on, to provide the Ark with an energy source.&quot;\n\nHe t=\r\nurns to Quickstride once more.\n\n&quot; After all, energy is everything, and we h=\r\nave to do everything in our power to produce and concerve it.&quot;\n\n \n\n--- In n=\r\nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As eve=\r\nryone walked in, talking amongst themselves, rather than being\n&gt; greeted by=\r\n the site of an impatient LEO PRIME they see LEO talking\n&gt; with a green mec=\r\nh who is giving off a definite Predacon signature, a\n&gt; mech called CELERON.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So far LEO PRIME still had no actual weapons out but he was looking a=\r\nt\n&gt; the Predacon and asking a question, &quot;Tell me, why did you, a Predacon,\n=\r\n&gt; bring this to our attention? I would think that this would work in\n&gt; your=\r\n favor, perhaps use the confusion to accomplish whatever you have\n&gt; in mind=\r\n.&quot; His face was registering more curiousity than distrust at\n&gt; this point, =\r\nalthough his manner was a bit reserved.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time as LEO talked=\r\n the fuzors TORCA, NOCTORO were watching\n&gt; the Predacon from their sides.
