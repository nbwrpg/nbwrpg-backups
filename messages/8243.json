Don&#39;t you see? You can&#39;t blame yourself for \n&gt; it. You had a chance to escape. If you had died, than the plan of \nThe \n&gt; Matrix would have been surely destroyed. It was destiny that you \n&gt; survived Hell Beast&#39;s rath. Now come, Cybershark has already gone \n&gt; inside, so shall we join him? You too, Soundwave.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois went to catch up with Cybershark.\n\n\n"}}
