Her vision was returning.  She slowly \nopened \n&gt; her optics and notice two very large figures standing over her.  \nShe \n&gt; rubbed her optics with her paws and looked at them again. Her \nvision \n&gt; was clear now. She saw the two dragons from earlier.  She tried to \n&gt; jump to her feet, but her hind feet didn&#39;t want to co-operate. She \n&gt; transformed into bot mode and stood there, on shakey legs. &quot;Who are \n&gt; you? Why did you attack me? I didn&#39;t attack you? You know, that \n&gt; wasn&#39;t very nice.&quot;  She drew her sidearm, but kept it at her side. \nIf \n&gt; they hadn&#39;t killed her by now, then they must have a reason for \n&gt; keeping her alive. &quot;Would you please explain to me what is going \non?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
