Looking up he waved \nthe two bots in.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Good to see your mission was a success Hot Rod.&quot; He said \nsimply before turning his full attention to them both, &quot;Your next \nassignment is more of surveillance. One of the predicons captured by \nSunhawk had a surprising story to tell, seems she claims to be an \nold friend of yours. To verify her claim I&#39;ve granted her sanctuary \nhere with us and assigned you to keep an eye on her.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Turning to look at Hot Rod&#39;s companion he nodded, &quot;Welcome to \nmy ship, I&#39;m Talos.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
