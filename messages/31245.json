He walked around\n&gt; in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perimeter around his dead pod sticking his finger in the\n&gt; ground\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; three\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times every ten meters.

He reached to\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; side\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grabbed two tubes from his hips. He held them both in his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hands\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once a firm grip was on thim Energy Whips formed from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end...&quot;Well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like this....&quot; He then closed his optics off and\n&gt; entered his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brain...he searched for all his new abilites.....\n\n\n"}}
