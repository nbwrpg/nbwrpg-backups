Perceptor once again shut down his audio\nreceptors as Straightshot and Quickstride braced for battle. Meanwhile\nTalon and Legacy leaped from the vehicle and fired on the approaching\ntroopers in the desperate hope to buy Tuscon some time.\n\nTalon opened fire . . .\n\n[Insect Trooper #3 is HIT by Talon ] - Trooper #3 is at Light Damage\n\nMeanwhile Legacy also opened fire, targeting another of the approaching horde!\n\n[Insect Trooper #1 is HIT by Legacy] - Insect Trooper #1 is drops into\nstasis lock!\n\nBecause of having to reposition himself, Tuscon is unable to fire\nbefore the trooper reach him, and so he, as well as Legacy and Talon\nhave to fend off their attacks first . . .\n\n\n[Insect Trooper #1] - Unable to attack - Stasis Lock\n[Talon MISSED by Insect Trooper #2]\n[Legacy MISSED by Insect Trooper #3]\n[Tuscon MISSED by Insect Trooper #4]\n[Tuscon MISSED by Insect Trooper #4]\n[Talon is HIT by Insect Trooper #6] - Talon is at Light Damage\n\n[Tuscon is HIT by Elite Insect Trooper #1] - Tuscon is at Light Damage\n\nFinally Tuscon is able to return fire, and opens up with a wide area\naudio assault, hoping to stun the approaching enemy!\n\n[Insect Trooper #1] - Unaffected (Already In Stasis Lock)\n[Insect Trooper #2] - Unaffected\n[Insect Trooper #3] - Stunned 1 Round\n[Insect Trooper #4] - Unaffected\n[Insect Trooper #5] - Stunned 2 Rounds\n[Insect Trooper #6] - Stunned 1 Round\n\n[Elite Insect Trooper #1] - Unaffected\n\nSome of the insectile troops stumble back at the rather surprising\nattack from the truck that is Tuscon! All around the combatants the\nwalls rumbled slightly as a few loose stones and rocks fall to the\nground. However it stopped after a few moments.\n\nMeanwhile as some of the insects reel in dismay, others come forward to attack!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\nOOC: As this stunning attack is something new to Tuscon I am having it\naffect them at MUCH lower levels then it would ordinarily. I am trying\nto figure out how I want to handle this using weapons in new ways. It\nwas not something that was done so much in the cartoon or the comics.\nBasically folks had the weapons they had, and they used them to the\nbest of their abilities.\n\nAnyways, food for thought.\n\n-P\n\n"}}
