This alarms Rattrap and Quickstride.\n\n&quot;Uh oh=\r\nh, I saw that..  Don&#39;t tell me...  Ohh don&#39;t tell me you got what I think y=\r\nou got.&quot;\n\nRattrap moves away from Uproar as does Quickstride, who are reluc=\r\ntant only because they didn&#39;t want to catch Uproars affliction. The large c=\r\nat starts sneezing again as energon is dispersed.\n\n&quot;Sorry guys, wow, where =\r\nthe pit did this come from?  I don&#39;t remember being anywhere near anyone wi=\r\nth... Uhh ohh, guys, back up!  AHHCHOO!&quot;\n\nAgain another burst of energon co=\r\nmes out of his nostrills.\n\nQuickstride now looks over to Legacy.\n\n&quot; We have=\r\nn&#39;t seen this since Rhinox contracted it, a while ago... Poor guy, he was p=\r\nretty hefty, and that virus took alot out of him..  I can imagine what it&#39;s=\r\n gonna do ta Uproar, he&#39;s a lot smaller than Rhinox, and I dunno how much h=\r\nis body is gonna handle and for how long.&quot;\n\nRattrap quickly jumps in.\n\n&quot;We =\r\ngotta get that cat ta Bump ASAP.  Prefferably in Isolation, so the rest of =\r\nus don&#39;t catch it.&quot;  \n\nUproar nodds.\n\n&quot;Yeah, he&#39;s right, can&#39;t risk anyone =\r\nelse gettn&#39; sick..  Maaaan this bites.&quot;\n\nHe crinkles up his muzzle as Quick=\r\nstride and Rattrap move quickly out of the way.  They barely missed getting=\r\n sneezed on as their comrade is now stuck with a persistant sneezing fit.\n\n=\r\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC:  S=\r\norry that I can&#39;t do the old/new context when I&#39;m posting from my\n&gt; phone.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron didn&#39;t immediately answer, remaining silent and glar=\r\ning at Leo.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I like to think of myself as a Mercenary.&quot; he said, takin=\r\ng a glance around\n&gt; the room.  &quot;No, that&#39;s not right.
