T=\r\nhe question was, could he transform?  He slowly attempts the transformation=\r\n from vehicle to robot mode, and with each painful shift of the metal, he m=\r\nanages to get himself in robot mode, but finds himself pinned inside the to=\r\nppled trees.\n\n&quot;Slag.  No gettn&#39; outa this mess.  I&#39;m pinned in real good Ra=\r\nt Trap...&quot;\n\nRat Trap swallows hard.\n\n&quot;Well, at least ya tried.  Now what?&quot;\n=\r\n\nThe ground vibrates beneath them.  Night Shift feels it.\n\n&quot;First giant bug=\r\ns, and now large foot steps commn&#39; right at us.  Not good.&quot;\n\nRat Trap peeks=\r\n out from beneath the brush, and spots a familliar Dinosaur lumbering their=\r\n way.  \n\n&quot;Hey, remember that big dino that ya helped out back there?  I thi=\r\nnk he&#39;s back.&quot;\n\nThe stegosaurous lumbers closser to the fallen trees, and t=\r\nhen senses danger around the pile. Yet instead of fleeing, he grumbles and =\r\ngrowls at the insecticons, stamping his feet to ward them off, and swiping =\r\nhis tail to keep them away from the pile.  As he does that, the female and =\r\nthe baby stegosaurous now help to get Rat Trap and Night Shift out by movin=\r\ng the logs with their mouths, also surrounding them protectively as they do=\r\n so.  It appeared that NONE of them would move without a fight.\n\n\n\n--- In n=\r\nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He keeps going, hoping to get away, when without warning, his tir=\r\ne catches\n&gt; a sharp piece of wood and then, with a loud bang, he blows out.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;SCRAAAP!

Branches fell down around them.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the top of t=\r\nhe hill the two armored lady bugs, each one of them almost as\n&gt; big as Nigh=\r\nt Shift in his vehicular mode hovered as if trying to scan for\n&gt; Rat Trap a=\r\nnd Night Shift. It would seem that with the falling slide for the\n&gt; moment =\r\nthe armored bugs had lost them in the underbrush.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Insecticon bugs =\r\nhovered at the top of the hill and then began to move\n&gt; down with bright li=\r\nghts and beams shining along the ground slowly\n&gt; approaching their position=\r\n, following Nightshift&#39;s path of descent.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
