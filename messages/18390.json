It was still alive, and Starscream did not have it \nin \n&gt; him to fight a helpless bot. He watched the fire on her die down, \nand \n&gt; than placed her in the cockpit and sealed it tight, chaining her to \n&gt; the seat. He would take her back to KitKat, and she would decide \nwhat \n&gt; to do with her. Maybe she knew where Megatron was. He would stop by \n&gt; the base, put this rodent in custody, and than go and help Drillbit \n&gt; defeat Inferno. He blasted of towards the base.\n\n\n"}}
