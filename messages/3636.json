Gaining altitude, he fired \nthree plasma bolts down at Rhinox, autogun fire piercing his feet, sending \nhim crashing down into a clearing with high grass.\n\n---\n\nHades, took out a grenade, throwing it at the autoguns, turning his head as \nit blew up when getting into the middle of them, an optic blast lancing out \nat Snow Tech.\n\n---\n\nUnitron laughed, quickly flipping to the left, evading the darts.  &quot;Try a \nfaster weapon, like a laser!&quot; he yelled, raising both of his laser rifles.  \nFiring four laser bolts from one rifle at Shadow Cat, and four at Rhinox as \nhe ran.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor laughed at Rhinox.  &quot;Run, run as fast as you can, you won&#39;t catch \nme, I&#39;m the Void-Man!&quot; he smiled, firing a powerful blast from his plasma \nlauncher at an area 10 ft in front of Rhinox as the Maximal ran towards it.  \n\n---\n\nSixshot raised his main cannon, firing a powerful sonic blast at mid-hull of \nthe Ark, two missile launchers firing a total of four rockets at the Ark.\n\n---\n\nKoga Shuko fired two optic blasts at Liono Prime&#39;s left knee, raising his \nmissile launcher at the same time, firing a rocket off at Rhinox (using his \ninternal sensors to pinpoint the Maximal&#39;s position).\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer saw Rhinox being chased like mad.  Looking around, he \nsmiled.  The poifect crime.  Raising his rifle, he fired ten rapid laser \nbolts off at the Maximal&#39;s pelvis.\n\n\n"}}
