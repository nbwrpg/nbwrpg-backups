If you want =\r\nto control them, I do not \nmind \n&gt; their appearance.) )\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder&#39;s c=\r\nommands were carried out by the station and the guns \n&gt; erupted into the ai=\r\nr with a deadly symphony of wreckage! Firepower \n&gt; ripped into the invaders=\r\n as first the shuttle&#39;s batteries and then \n&gt; the Ark violently pulled swee=\r\nps from the skies! \n&gt; \n&gt; However much like the last battle the sweeps dispe=\r\nrsed, making them \n&gt; much harder to hit. Using their agility and speed they=\r\n turned in \nthe \n&gt; air, spinning as the weapons continued to pepper the ski=\r\nes with \n&gt; bullets and energy!\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy for his part pulled back, using =\r\nthe Ark as an additional \n&gt; defence as he laid into the oncoming sweeps. Mu=\r\nch like Lord Elder&#39;s \n&gt; attack, it was effective but the sweep disperesed, =\r\nleaving him to \n&gt; pick one or two out of the air at a time rather then dest=\r\nroying \nmany \n&gt; at a time. \n&gt; \n&gt; As Jhiaxus and Scorponok, Grimlock and Hyd=\r\nras and Rodimus all \n&gt; approached from their different vectors, they could =\r\nall see the \ngrim \n&gt; vista of the sweeps, and the number of them was stagge=\r\nring. At the \n&gt; center of all this Cyclonus floated a cold calm amidst the =\r\nstorm of \n&gt; sweeps that floated around him. \n&gt; \n&gt; To those who had been at =\r\nthe battle above Atlantis the sight \nbrought \n&gt; a darker reality: Although =\r\nthere were not as many sweep here as \nthere \n&gt; were at Atlantis, with Cyclo=\r\nnus were several other minions: \nDarkfate \n&gt; and Nightstrike as well as thr=\r\nee others which were unknown - A \n&gt; warning that this battle may prove to b=\r\ne far more dangerous then \nthe \n&gt; one before.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Grimlock landed and a=\r\nttacked his breath weapon attack proved to \nbe \n&gt; effective, striking down =\r\nseveral sweeps and singed several others \nas \n&gt; they maneuvered out of his =\r\nway. \n&gt; \n&gt; As Hydras approached from the rear his guns opening up on the re=\r\nar \n&gt; flank of the sweeps, they dispersed into the skies as several of \nthe=\r\nm \n&gt; were brought down and many more came in to take their places. \n&gt; \n&gt; As=\r\n the sweeps coiled around, absorbing the attacks from the would-\nbe \n&gt; defe=\r\nnders, in unison they began to open fire on Ark and Legacy as \n&gt; well as Gr=\r\nimlock and the defending shuttle!\n&gt; \n&gt; At same time minions were receiving =\r\norders from Scourge who was \n&gt; himself floating into position and was more =\r\nthen ready to prove \n&gt; himself, &quot;Tumult, Nightstrike and Darkfate You are w=\r\nith me! We go \nto \n&gt; destroy the ark, and TAKE the Matrix!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The answer=\r\n from Tumult was quick, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; as he powered up his \n&gt; engines and mane=\r\nuvered himself into position near the top of the \nhost.\n&gt; \n&gt; Strangely the =\r\nresponse for the approaching Decepticons and \nPredicons \n&gt; was a bit differ=\r\nent - Although the Sweeps avoided combat, no combat \n&gt; was initiated. Inste=\r\nad Hydras recieved a call: \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hydras&quot; Cyclonus&#39; calm voice crackled ove=\r\nr the communication lines \n&gt; in an ancient Unicronian code. &quot;You were once =\r\nGalvatron, I can feel \n&gt; his essence within you, and I have felt it since y=\r\nou have \napproached. \n&gt; I have given you and yours a stay of execution beca=\r\nuse of that \n&gt; ancient connection between us. Approach no farther and live,=\r\n leave \n&gt; and you will be rewarded when our work here is done.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Presto=\r\nn\n&gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
