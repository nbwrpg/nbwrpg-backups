Well, certainly smell the =\r\nsame and your signature&#39;s the same..  Okay, I can trust ya.  Unfortunately,=\r\n I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give ya a ride, because well, I&#39;m not transmetal, but I=\r\n can certainly help ya.&quot;\n\nBack at the battle field, Tucson lays the weapons=\r\n down as requested.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll do as requested, but I&#39;m counting on you to keep=\r\n your end of the bargain....  You know, the voice, it&#39;s familliar....  Lega=\r\ncy...  It&#39;s either it&#39;s you, Legacy, or it&#39;s a trick.  If it is you, I ask =\r\nonly this, why?  Why would you carry out such a deception for such a long t=\r\nime?  And why did I not listen when it was imperative to do so?&quot;\n\nHe lays t=\r\nhem down.\n\n&quot; If you must take someone, why not take me?  The power of the M=\r\natrix burns bright in my chest, it&#39;s what you want isn&#39;t it?  Then come, ta=\r\nke it, but leave Rodimus, Lord Elder, and the rest of the Autobots and Maxi=\r\nmals alone.  That is why I&#39;ve been given this power, so that they can live =\r\nwithout fear or danger.  And if I must sacrifice myself to do so, then so b=\r\ne it.&quot;\n\nHe steps forward, and then stops, standing couragiously in front of=\r\n his comrades, to ensure their saftey.  Yet he makes no moves to attack him=\r\nself.

The power is out, and Nightlight is =\r\nbarely alive. This piece of\n&gt; scrap is holding her hostage!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bump cut =\r\nin, &quot;I don&#39;t know what has happened to Elita.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Santon and Bump talk=\r\ned another voice cut in, this one over the Autobot\n&gt; and Maximal channels, =\r\nit was heavily encrypted &quot;Stall them!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It was Rodimus&#39; voice, and he w=\r\nas speaking rapidly. &quot;I think I have a way to\n&gt; get us out of this!
