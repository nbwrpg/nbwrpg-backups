Yet\n&gt; not asleep, he raises his neck with a heavy sigh.  He felt that somehow, he\n&gt; let everyone down. He tries to put his front talons on the bed and his back\n&gt; ones as well, trying to lift his body up but to no avail. He was too weak to\n&gt; move and it leaves him frustrated.  He sets himself down with a draconic\n&gt; groan.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I wish recharging did not take this long.  They need me out there.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to him while sitting up on her hind legs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; But we need you ALIVE.  Don&#39;t feel guilty for something ya can&#39;t help.  Ya\n&gt; gotta start thinking about yourself too, you don&#39;t do much of that, Tucson.\n&gt; You have a bright future ahead of ya with Talon and you could have a family\n&gt; down the road.  Just think how wonderful that will be, a family ta call your\n&gt; own, a life you helped ta bring into this world.  Please, don&#39;t throw that\n&gt; away.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson smiles and nods to her.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;  I won&#39;t I promise&quot;.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a knowing smile from LEO PRIME, &quot;A good leader knows when to\ncharge foward and when to hold back.&quot; LEO stood next to TUSCON, &quot;If\nyou burn out your circuits trying to be everywhere at once then you\nwill be in no condition to help them when it all falls apart.&quot;\n\nHe laid a comforting hand on TUSCON, &quot;Rest. The recharging will be\nover soon enough and you will still be needed.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile Nightshift grins at Wing Caliber.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; mind if we trade this for a can of energon?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot; WING CALIBER said with an amused smile on his face. He\nwalked over to a dispenser and retrieved a bit of energon. &quot;All you\nneed and more.&quot; He said after he made sure it was topped off and\nclosed up. With an agile movement he  tossed the container to\nNIGHTSHIFT, it glowed slightly as it flew through the air.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
