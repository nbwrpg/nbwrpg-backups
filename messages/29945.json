Where is Ice and what&#39;s her statis?\n\n\n\n---Original Message-----\n&gt;From: &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@...&gt;\n\n&gt;OK Logo, I made mutant signatures different from Maximal signatures so Ice,\n&gt;Razor Claw, and Lunarpine can&#39;t walk through the shields.\n&gt;\n&gt;the main reason was that I didn&#39;t want to give Megaton a way into the CF \n&gt;and\n&gt;have everyone complain.\n&gt;\n&gt;BIC Razor Claw walked around shakily in his new Wolverine mode. He was\n&gt;confused and made a mental note to ask Veratis what had happened. Somehow \n&gt;he\n&gt;knew that he still had his raptor mode but didn&#39;t want to waste the\n&gt;opportunity to learn about his new form.\n&gt;\n&gt;A little outside Maximal scanners the chat between Lunarpine and Megaton\n&gt;continued, Megaton sensed Lunarpines lothing.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;You fear my size?&quot; The dragon spread his wings again, stretching them to\n&gt;the peak of thier width. &quot;Maybe I can make you feal more comfortable.&quot; He\n&gt;quickly transformed to his warped robot/ T-rex/ Dragon form shrinking down.\n&gt;Even in this mode he was about 4 feet taller than Lunarpine and still fealt\n&gt;superior.\n&gt;\n&gt;Lunarpine stood up straight as he could trying pathetically to look bigger\n&gt;than he was. &quot;I&#39;ve beaten bigger bots than you.&quot;The wolfbot boasted\n&gt;attempting to impress the other bot.\n&gt;\n&gt;Megaton raised his T-rex legs to full extension making him 18- 19 feet. \n&gt;This\n&gt;severely limited his mobility and coordination but the cocky mutant was \n&gt;sure\n&gt;he could recover fast enough to destroy the smaller bot before any serious\n&gt;damage was done.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
