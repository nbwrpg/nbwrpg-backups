With his warning shot made, he rolls forward on \n&gt;&gt; his wheels with the light damage not effecting his engine nor his wheels. \n&gt;&gt; He wasn&#39;t ready to quit, not by any means. Small damage were like moon \n&gt;&gt; pebbles under his tires, simply roll with them and roll over them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The truck continues his relentless push forward.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Hit me all you want, I&#39;m not going anywhere except forward. We came \n&gt;&gt; here to retrieve our comrade, no matter what slag you throw at us. That \n&gt;&gt; is all we want, nothing more nothing less. We are not here to take over \n&gt;&gt; anything or anyone. Let us find Rodimus, and bring him home, and we will \n&gt;&gt; leave you undesturbed.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; talon hold back a moan and she continue to firing gainst the insect like \n&gt;&gt; aliens.\n&gt;\n&gt; The move foward by Tuscon is successful. Although Talon&#39;s shot misses\n&gt; its intended target, it instead hitting high and wide, Legacy&#39;s shot\n&gt; finds its mark hitting the insect square in the chest and sending it\n&gt; flying back into the wall. It lands with a crunching sound and slides\n&gt; to the ground, its optics completely dull.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile the rest of the troopers surge foward! however due to the\n&gt; extensive armor plating of Tuscon and his grim determination, they\n&gt; push through with only a modicum of trouble. The insects leap after\n&gt; Tuscon, but thier blades slide inaffectually along his armor, cutting\n&gt; only into his paint job, but little else. They are quickly left behind\n&gt; if Tuscon picks up any speed.\n&gt;\n&gt; The road ahead looks clear. all the way to the main chamber about a\n&gt; half a mile away where Rodimus and presumably where what the insectoid\n&gt; aliens called the misstress resides.\n&gt;\n&gt; The ground rumbled for a moment, and then a blast of cool air rolled\n&gt; down the tunnel, but all else was quiet.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Sorry, I had to type this one out fast :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
