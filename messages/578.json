She landed\nhard\n&gt; as she hit the ground, mech fluid dripping from the wound in her chest.\n&gt; BrightBlade yipped in rage(which is what foxes do) and jumped to her\n&gt; feet...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You wanna fight? I&#39;ll give you a fight!!!!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * BrightBlade swerved around a tree trunk and started to fiddle with the\n&gt; innards of her gun, she hadn&#39;t told Hell Beast that she could hot-wire\n&gt; weapons just for the fun of it.\n&gt; She switched the charge cavity with an extra energy booster , which made\nthe\n&gt; charges extra powerful. She smiled as she put the gun back together again,\n&gt; now the fun started.\n&gt; BrightBlade jumped out from behind the tree and fired at the boulder, when\n&gt; the charge hit it the huge rock exploded into chunks. Dust rose up and\n&gt; chocked the air, it had been a pleasure to make sure that the charge had\nthe\n&gt; force of a sticks of TNT.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; You have a voice mail message waiting for you at iHello.com:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3555/7/_/_/_/956812485/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
