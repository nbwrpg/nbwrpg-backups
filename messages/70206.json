Then he left on the floor\n&gt; Nightlight and opened his com link to Rattrap, and the others outside &quot;I&#39;m\n&gt; heading towards the exit... Cover me, Nightlight is with me but she&#39;s... she\n&gt; is sedated...\n&gt;\n&gt; Then the old autobot took Nighlight and continue his trip towards the exit\n\n&quot;Acknowledged.&quot; Legacy&#39;s voice transmitted to Kup.\n\nEven as Legacy spoke, the door of the Black Fortress, the frame and\nthe wall surrounding it began to smoke under the assault that massive\ntank that was Legacy was bringing to bear against it!\n\nThen with a loud crash the door and it&#39;s frame, rather than\nvaporizing, fell to the ground in a long arc. Interestingly, the\nspecialized heat resistant armor that normally protected the walls and\ndoors of the fortress against the searing heat from the lava, now\nallowed these same devices, much like a drawbridge over a moat, to\nbecome a pathway over the lava and into the Black Fortress itself!\n\n&quot;Autobots.&quot; Legacy transmitted to the Autobots and Maximals, &quot;I am\nresuming my entry into the Black Fortress to assist Rodimus and\nTuscon. Kup, I would suggest you rendevous with me as soon as you&#39;re\nable, the path behind me should be a safe egress.&quot;\n\n&quot;Rat Trap, Quickstride.&quot; Legacy&#39;s cold voice intoned, &quot;You have the\noption to accompany me if you desire.&quot; With that Legacy&#39;s lights came\non, illuminating the entrance he had just made as he began to go\ninside.\n\nLegacy&#39;s force shield sparked as it began to absorb blows from the\ninternal defences that the fortress tried to bring against him. So far\nit was holding.\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: I got the okay from Airly to knock down the door and such woohoo!!. :)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
