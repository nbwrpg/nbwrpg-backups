Quite frankly I\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t care if it was 250, \n&gt; 50, a 40, 88mm, or just plain 1. The fact of the\n&gt; matter is, intelligence is \n&gt; not something to gloat about which is something I\n&gt; bet you do in school alot \n&gt; and is the reason why you get made of fun so much. \n&gt; \n&gt; ~LN\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. If you learned what I did from watching\n&gt; bedazzled, you&#39;d know that \n&gt; overly intelligent people ARE gay. Let&#39;s see how\n&gt; often you brag about your \n&gt; intelligence now.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 9/17/02 7:44:32 AM Eastern\n&gt; Daylight Time, \n&gt; dewboy30816@... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; And I have an IQ of 150. \n&gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t shove it down my throat if yours is\n&gt; &gt; higher, I&#39;m just telling you I&#39;m not an idiot. \n&gt; And\n&gt; &gt; while I sometimes sound rude I said that simply\n&gt; &gt; pointing out &quot;long live&quot; is the general\n&gt; expression. \n&gt; &gt; Actually &quot;long life&quot; may be nice for a change, but\n&gt; &gt; &quot;long live so-and-so is all I&#39;ve ever heard said. \n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; not taking a shot at airly, if I made a mistake\n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; that in Spanish I&#39;d want him to tell me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
