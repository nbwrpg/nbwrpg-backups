He gestured to Hydras\nas the drones began to lead him down the hall.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; hydras started to walk ready for anything while he send a secret mesage to\n&gt; MAxima &quot;Be ready, I have a bad feelinga bout this&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Hydras began to walk the door behind him slid shut, plunging him\nand his three companions into near darkness for a moment.\n\n&lt;BZZZZT!!&gt; &lt;BZZZZT!&gt; It would also seem that any communications have\nbeen cut off. At the moment it would seem that Hydras is unable to\ncommunicate with the outside, and that would of course include Maxima\nas well as Injector and the others.\n\nAs this happened at the far end of the hall a door opened and a voice\ncould be heard as Hydras approached, &quot;Well well My dear Hydras I could\nnot have you talking about anything behind our backs now could I?&quot;\n\nThe voice is  genteel yet sarcastic as it spoke, &quot;It is so good to see\nyou have made it, you and your . . . um friends there.&quot;\n\nAs Hydras got to the door he could see the interior of what would\nappear to be a large room, monitors and computer stations lining the\nwalls. A tall figure hovered near the center of the room, next to what\nwould at first glance appear to be a throne. The figure seemed to be\ndraped in shadows, its dark armor almost exuding cold darkness and\nthreatening evil. It floated a few inches from the floor, helicoptor\ntype blades spinning at its shoulder blades were holding it aloft. Its\ncold red optics turned to look at Hydras as he, inferno, Buzzsaw and\nTerrorgator came to the door.\n\nHowever it is obvious that it was the figure on the throne itself that\nhad been doing the talking, and the throne turned and the figure of\nCryotek turned to greet Hydra, &quot;It has been a long time, yesss.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\nOOC: Cryotek was BW&#39;s Megatron&#39;s teacher and mentor. I would imaging\nthat since Hydras is part Galvatron and part Megatron, the Megatron\nside of him should recognize him. Although they have not seen each\nother in quite some time. heh heh heh BWHAHAHAHAHAHA &gt;:)\n\nhttp://transformers.wikia.com/wiki/Cryotek\n\n"}}
