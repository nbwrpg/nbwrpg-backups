Then energy began to go into the \norb from Ultimos Ene=\r\nrgy field.

Then the \nball \n&gt; &gt; seemed to begin to draw solar energy and evergy ge=\r\nnerated by the \n&gt; &gt; slight wind, and perhaps some energy from Ultimo.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ultimo took a step back=\r\n &quot;Energy Barrette&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Online&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A long barrette of pu=\r\nre energy so condense it made a solid able \nto \n&gt; &gt; change in shape. =A0Ult=\r\nimo hit the sabre to the side then parried \nby \n&gt; &gt; having the =A0barrette =\r\nextend towards Hellpeons sword hand. =A0With \nhis \n&gt; &gt; other hand he threw =\r\n=A0his shield in front of the blast but it \nknocked \n&gt; &gt; him back a bit fro=\r\nm the close range, also obscurring the attack \nof \n&gt; &gt; his barrete causing =\r\nUltimo to swing his arm up the extended \nbarrette \n&gt; &gt; going straight at He=\r\nllpeons neck from the chest area.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nbwrpg@y... wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as the flame came towards him it was quickly repeled by \n=\r\nthat \n&gt; &gt; barrier of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chaochtian energy.
