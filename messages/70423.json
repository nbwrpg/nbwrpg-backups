He did not want any fighting in the Ark among any \n&gt; Maximal, Predacon or Autobot for that matter.  But bringing them all \n&gt; together under one banner would be most difficult especially to a new \n&gt; Prime who was just starting out.  He uses his sonar systems to follow \n&gt; Ramulus, Cheetor and Lord Elder, transforms into truck mode, and rolls at \n&gt; a reasonable speed up to Lord Elder, and rolls slowly beside him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Your words are very wise Lord Elder.  Bringing everyone together will \n&gt; not be easy, and I admit, I don&#39;t know everything either.  But I do know \n&gt; that I sense great strength among our group, a strength I&#39;ve never quite \n&gt; sensed before.  A strength to overcome differences and to be able to work \n&gt; together under one roof.  We just need to learn how to tap into that \n&gt; strength and we haven&#39;t quite gotten that far, at least, I haven&#39;t.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He stops and opens his door to Lord Elder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Get in, wheels work faster than feet.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Must we always assume the worst Cheetor? Must we always follow a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; similar path even if it may lead us over a cliff to our demise? Talon \n&gt;&gt; &gt; is right, Perceptor risked his own life so that we may still remain \n&gt;&gt; &gt; functionable. If he were to turn his back on us, he would have done \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that vorns ago. Now, I will not hear another negative word about \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor. Not in my pressence. He has risked his life for us, and now \n&gt;&gt; &gt; we must do him the respect of showing him our thanks for his efforts. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, enough bickering, we have a tunnel to seal off and Rodimus Prime \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to bring back online. I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t want to see any of you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; bickering either. Am I understood Cheetor?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheetor looked at Tuscon, his optics cool yet dim, then he finally\n&gt;&gt; nodded, &quot;You are in charge.&quot; he said, sounding sullen and crestfallen.\n&gt;&gt; &quot;If you say it, then it must be true.&quot; He turned and began walking\n&gt;&gt; back toward the Ark, his shoulders slumped, his head bowed a little.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ramulus had glanced back at Cheetor and then Tuscon, and then just\n&gt;&gt; shook his head again as he continued to walk away. He had been helping\n&gt;&gt; Rhinox, perhaps it was time for him to return to that mission. Too\n&gt;&gt; much time around the Ark never made him feel good. he prefered the\n&gt;&gt; wide open out doors, not to be confined to and one spot.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Wow, ya know Lord Elder, he may not be able ta see, but he sure knows \n&gt;&gt; &gt; his words of wisdom. Definitely what Optimus Prime would&#39;ve done.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lord Elder watched Cheetor walk back to the Ark as well, as he\n&gt;&gt; listened to Quickstride. Elder folded his arms behind his back as he\n&gt;&gt; turned to look back at Quickstride, &quot;Is it?&quot; Elder asked.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Trust cannot be demanded or commanded only earned.&quot; He said quietly.\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Cheetor was not with you to watch the events that you saw that caused\n&gt;&gt; you to come to trust Perceptor, how can he be expected to trust\n&gt;&gt; without it?&quot; Elder&#39;s voice was not accusatory but calm and reasoning.\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Cheetor only knows what he sees here and now, and that is a Predacon\n&gt;&gt; that he has fought against for a long time. It will take time to get\n&gt;&gt; over that, to see him as a companion, perhaps one day as a friend.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elder turned to look back at Perceptor, &quot;And it will take Perceptor\n&gt;&gt; time to come to realize his new role here, and that the life that he\n&gt;&gt; has known has ended, he has a new part to play.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elder looked at Cheetor and Ramulus for a moment, watching each one\n&gt;&gt; walk away in different directions. &quot;It is Tuscon&#39;s job now to bring us\n&gt;&gt; together, unite us under a common banner. That is the hardest part of\n&gt;&gt; being a leader, not just leading but inspiring others to follow.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elder turned to follow after Cheetor, his steps quick to catch up with\n&gt;&gt; the swift Maximal, he would need a pep talk.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
