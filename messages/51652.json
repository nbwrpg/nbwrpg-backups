I am going alone and I place you under charges of order \ndisobeyance. We will resolve this matter once I am back. Yggdrasil \nPrime, over and out.\n\nHe stood from his command chair in the station and went to the hatch \nof the Bullet.\n\nThe Bullet was not the most spacious of ships. It sported had drop \nchamber for the crew and a belly-mounted laser for bombardment attacks \nthat were mostly used against heavily defended positions.\n\nThe Maximal entered the ship, started the engines and was soon out in \nspace. It would be some time before he reached the wormhole, so he \nengaged the autopilot and tried to relax.\n\n\n"}}
