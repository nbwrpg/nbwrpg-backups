One that has nagged me for a day or so now but\n&gt;&gt; I keep forgetting to ask it. Why did you change Tuscon&#39;s motiff or\n&gt;&gt; signature?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When he was Tuscon in the begining he had sonar attacks, and even when\n&gt;&gt; he was converted to his Prime form he kept that style. But when you\n&gt;&gt; converted him to Drgon you gave him fire, which is a departure from\n&gt;&gt; what he was.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also keep in mind that Rodimus already has a fire motiff, and now you\n&gt;&gt; will kind of have two of them running around. :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Why not give Tuscon a sonic breath attack rather than fire? Keep in\n&gt;&gt; mind, not all dragons had a fire attack. Sonics would go along better\n&gt;&gt; with what he was. It would still be a very powerful attack. Look at\n&gt;&gt; the Combaticon Brawl, who actually has a similar personality to Tuscon\n&gt;&gt; I think - but he has an ear splitting 300-decibel bursts of\n&gt;&gt; concentrated sound as well as a 10-Megawatt electron gun, which would\n&gt;&gt; be a lightning breath attack as well?? (although you can&#39;t use them\n&gt;&gt; both together)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And you also have Thundercracker as an example who had a sonic boom\n&gt;&gt; attack that can be heard for 200 miles. Sonic attacks are very\n&gt;&gt; effective weapons and then it would make sense that someone could hear\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon&#39;s roar hundreds of miles away.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It would be different from fire, but I think it would be a lot more in\n&gt;&gt; keeping with who Tuscon was as he was more of a sound based figure\n&gt;&gt; rather than a fire based one. He wouldn&#39;t neccessarilly have the sonar\n&gt;&gt; and all the other special stuff, but one could see how he shifted over\n&gt;&gt; and where he came from.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Does this make sense?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
