He wanders \noutside of the base, searching for lava tubes or something.  After \nabout a megacycle of wandering and searching, he finally found a \nbasalt based lava flow and transformed.  He wadded about knee deep \nand absorbed the heat so he would not melt or warp his legs.  He got \na hand full of the heavy thick stuff, and drew the heat out, leaving \na solid mass.  He then dipped it into the lava, pulled it out, and \nrepeated the process until it was halfway up his chest after several \nmegacycles.  He rolled it out of the lava stream and began to roll it \nback to the base.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Two megacycles later, Malice finally rolled the crude sphere like \nball into the base.  He rolled it into the cargo bay, and went to \nfind Wolfblade.\n&gt; &quot;Hey Wolfblade, I finished the sphere!  Where are you?&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She finished her glass and set it down. &quot;Well, uh, actually.....no \nI \n&gt; don&#39;t.
