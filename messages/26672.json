Don&#39;t do it again.  Just \nbecause JP&#39;s...opinion...differs, is not a reason to go cussing over the \nentire group.  Sending him a private e-mail would&#39;ve worked nicely.  What JP \nsaid might not be all that right to some of you, but he&#39;s entitled to his \nopinion.\n\nAnd this is a touchy subject, so I expect strongly worded e-mails, and I bet \nthere&#39;ll be more e-mails with the same content as Robo&#39;s, but we don&#39;t need \nto see it in the RPG&#39;s messaging system.  If you have the urge to swear at JP \nin an idiotic and non-productive manner, e-mail him.  I personally don&#39;t want \nto see your stupid, swearing-filled comments.  And when I open it up, I don&#39;t \nenjoy having it stuck in my computer and the only way to get rid of it is to \ngo in there and delete it.  I don&#39;t need that kind of useless e-mail piling \nin on the amount I have and receive.  So leave your moronic comments against \nJP in a private e-mail.\n\n\nL. Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n"}}
