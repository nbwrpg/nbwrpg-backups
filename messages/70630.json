Every\nscan showed the path leading in that direction.\n\nAs the band continued to move forward the ground continued to get more\nand more barren. The few trees and scrub brush that had been present\nnear the shuttle&#39;s landing area wee totally gone as they travelled in\ntowards the city. The air itself became progressively darker and\ngloomier as the ever present smog appeared to be almost blocking out\nthe sun.\n\nApproximately halfway to the city Hydras could see the city itself\nmore clearly. He could see the gate that granted entry to it, as well\nas the guards that protected it. However what was more troubling was\nwhat appeared to be several tanks that came through the gate and began\ntravelling in the direction that Hydras was travelling, thier powerful\ntreads leaving small plumes of ground up dust behind them as they\ntravelled. They appeared to be on an intercept course with Hydras.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
