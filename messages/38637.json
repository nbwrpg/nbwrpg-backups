When \nyou control chars in seperate factions and they get into a fight with \neach other you have to play them how you would play them if they were \nfighting a seperate faction. Just because your chars hate each other \ndoesnt mean you have to kill the chars of one faction off. Thats just \nplain dumb its like saying &quot;Oh, I like this faction so all these guys \nhave to die now because I cant handle them attacking each other.&quot; \nLook at Yan, he has the alliance against the Maximals, he doesnt go \naround killing his alliance chars and maximal chars simply because \nthey cant or wont coexist. ou should try to do the same.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Okay, I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s the truth. My characters could not \nco-exist in the same faction like that, ad then what? Make them act \nunrealistic? To keep them in character of course the Mafia would \nattack the Chivtrons, and then  who would I have die? As much as I \nlike them, my Chivtrons would end up dying.

Now, for the (hopefully) final \ncommant on this:\n&gt; \n&gt;   First of all: Soulstice, that was just plain cheap. Its threats \nlike those that make people not want people&#39;s chars in their \nfaction. &quot;If you do this, I&#39;ll kill off my chars on your side&quot; is \nexactly what makes faction commanders begin to rely on your chars \nless and less, resulting in them being ignored.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Second of all: as Gunthers said, quit trying to predict what the \nAlliance is gonna do. You&#39;re all wrong so far anyways.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; OOC: I did a poll. Want to vote in it?
