Megatron was making him\n&gt; nervous. He made it clear to himself not to go near him today. He knew\n&gt; better than to get too close. Megatron had a loose fuse.\n&gt;\n&gt; He hear the female scorpion say she wanted to go to the lake, now going to\n&gt; the mouth of the cave. That sparked danager in his mind. He ran to her and\n&gt; grabbed her arm. &quot;Wait!&quot; he said. &quot;Ah don&#39;t reckon that ain&#39;t the best\nidea.\n&gt; Remember what ah said? Don&#39;t go alone.&quot;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Special Offer-Earn 300 Points from MyPoints.com for trying @Backup\n&gt; Get automatic protection and access to your important computer files.\n&gt; Install today:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5667/13/_/_/_/962375573/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
