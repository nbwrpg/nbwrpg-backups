Her joints \nwere a little unused from the long period of unawareness, but she \nignored that problem. Use would wear them in.\n\n&lt;Noir.&gt; The word, or perhaps name, still remains part of her passive \nthoughts, sitting in the back of her mind like an unmistakeable \nsignature of her passing. &quot;Noir.&quot; Her soft cold voice says quietly \nto nobody in particular as she excercises her joints momentarily to \nensure their ability to function.\n\nHer hands absent mindedly slide into specific locations, her right \nhad on her right hip, and her left had behind her back. Pistols pop \nout of hidden slots, and she fingers them gingerly, looking them \nover slowly before putting them back.\n\nHer eyes scan the room, and rest on a mid sized table which has a \nelectronic device sitting on it in the middle of the room. \nCautiously, she walks over to the table, but before she can \ntouch the device, an interactive hologram flickered into existance \nabove it. \n\n&quot;Noir.&quot; The image said. &quot;Welcome to the Rogues base of the moment.&quot;\n\nNoir eyes the holo warily, &quot;... Keep talking.&quot; The image then \nstrikes her memmory, and she seems to remmeber this figure... \nDevilcat, the Rogue leader.\n\n&quot;You are to contact the active rogues immediately for your current \norders. And try not to delay.&quot; The image finished.\n\n&lt;Shoulda had something more... important to say... oh well&gt; She \nchecks to see that she has everything, then quietly leaves the room. \nHer memory showed her where everything was located. It seemed that \nshe&#39;d been here before for a long time, and knew it like the back of \nher hand. Knowing this, she made the trip to the control room as \nquick as possible.\n\nUnafraid of running into any other bots, she walks right into the \ncontrol and communications room, her eyes scanning the room right \nfrom the instant she had entered.\n\n(is there anyone in the Rogue base? or is Noir going to have to \ncontact the others.)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Somwehere in the Rogue base, in the center of a darkened inactive \n&gt; room in the crew quarters, a moderately sided stasis cell flickers \n&gt; to life. The liquid crystal display shows an increasing reactivity \n&gt; of the bot contained, which quickly levels off as it approaches a \n&gt; normal bot&#39;s functioning range.\n&gt; \n&gt; The chamber slides upward with an initially intense hiss, which \n&gt; gradually tapers off into an abrupt click as the chamber finishes \n&gt; rising from over top of the bot which it had been covering. \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Awake...&gt; thoughts trickle through the newly awakened bot&#39;s logic \n&gt; centers as its sensors begin to take in the surroundings. The \nbot&#39;s \n&gt; greyish visor turns slightly. The inpenitrable darkness is quickly \n&gt; washed away into a view of green and black which, the bot decides, \n&gt; could only mean night vision of sorts. The bot&#39;s vision was then \n&gt; interupted as the visor&#39;s green-black sight became bluish with \n&gt; reddish shapes around what must be heat sources.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;It has been a while.&gt; If thoughts could have temperature, these \n&gt; ones could have caused in ice age. &lt;This form... ahh yes, it is \nall \n&gt; coming back to me.&gt; Images of a lith black form weilding black and \n&gt; silver slienced pistols dodge weapon fire, and place three well \n&gt; aimed armour piercing bullets into a bot of unknown origin&#39;s \noptics \n&gt; and central cicuitry flash through her logic center as it acesses \n&gt; the bot&#39;s history.\n&gt; \n&gt; All the history files ended with one word.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;...Noir...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
