Owls and wolves \ncompeted in the frozen wilderness he came from, but not here. Pain \nscorched through his right arm (The one holding her). He knew not to \nrelease her or she&#39;d claw hhis eyes out. In beast mode her talons \nwere her most powerful weapon. Lunarpine lowered his claw anr pulled \nhis rifle. holding it up he pointed to the owls chest. Her head \nwasn&#39;t as big a part of her robot mode, destroy it and she&#39;d be \nrepairable. he was aiming for the one part that held her spark in \nboth modes. &quot;BANG&quot; Lunarpine shouted, &quot;Game over&quot; He dropped her to \nthe ground and jumped back ready to react if necessary. &quot;When I play \nWing it&#39;s for keeps. So will the Predicons. Remember this lesson and \nit won&#39;t be your last.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at him. Was he really going to kill her? She twisted and \nturned, \n&gt; but he had a good hold on her.  She knew that his wold instints \nwere taking \n&gt; over.  She had to react fast.  She let out an ear splitting screek. \nThen she \n&gt; reached with her tallon and scratched his arm, the one that held \nher.  She \n&gt; flapped her wings as hard as she could.  She was flapping her wings \nhard \n&gt; enough to almost lift him off the ground.\n&gt; &quot;The game isn&#39;t over yet. Kill me and it will be.&quot;\n&gt; She realized that if he didn&#39;t span out of it, the wolf in him \nwould kill \n&gt; her. She tried to claw at his face with her talons.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----Original message----\n&gt; From:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wed Jul 5, 2000 9:06pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine stopped suddenly, smelling the crow realizing the irony of\n&gt; the owls catch. All he could think how he&#39;d under reacted to her\n&gt; trick.\n&gt; \n&gt; The wolf transformed to bot again and lunged forward pinning the owl\n&gt; to the ground.&quot;You let your gaurd down before confirming the game \nwas\n&gt; over.&quot; He raised a claw to the owls throat. &quot;So what am I going to \ndo\n&gt; with a dead carcas?&quot; He lifted Shadow Wing into the ait claw still \npoised \n&gt; for the kill.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
