It was what he hoped to hear.  Deep down=\r\n he was hoping that somewhere along the line someone like Nightstrike could=\r\n turn over a new leaf.  She was proof of it.\n\n&quot; Talon, I&#39;m actually happy y=\r\nou told me this.  It actually assures me that my intentions aren&#39;t as crazy=\r\n as I thought they may seem.  Remember when we were fighting Nightstrike?  =\r\nHow skilled he appeared to be?  He gave us a run for our money, mainly me, =\r\nbut there was sheer talent in his approach, sheer talent that would not hav=\r\ne been at all recognized if I hadn&#39;t encountered him.  I don&#39;t think Unicro=\r\nn would have ever appreciated him for that, instead, he uses him as a puppe=\r\nt to do his dirty work, not at all giving him recognition for his efforts. =\r\n And what does he do when they fail?  Disposes of them. But what if someone=\r\n else, who he thought was an enemy, actually turned out to be a friend? You=\r\n&#39;ve proven that it can happen, see?  It doesn&#39;t change how I feel about you=\r\n.  So, this time, I&#39;d like to try a different approach with Nightstrike.  I=\r\n&#39;d like you to be with me as well as Depthcharge and the others, because I =\r\nwant them to see the same thing.  If we show compassion to those who are ot=\r\nherwise cast asside, because they aren&#39;t good enough, we can make friends o=\r\nut of enemies. Okay, let&#39;s go see if this works.  It might not.&quot;\n\nHe escort=\r\ns Talon outside, holding her hand.\n\n&quot;Okay guys, sorry about that..  I had a=\r\n slow leak in two tires and I had a heck of a time finding spares.&quot;\n\nRat Tr=\r\nap nodds.\n\n&quot;Thought so.  Kinda is hard ta find tires for a big guy like you=\r\n.&quot; \n\nTucson now looks to the others as he also transmits to Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; =\r\nFirst, I&#39;m also transmitting to Lord Elder and Kup, and guys, sorry about e=\r\narlier, I didn&#39;t mean to scare you.  Okay, everyone, this is what I hope to=\r\n accomplish..  Nightstrike may be a minion, but Unicron doesn&#39;t value his m=\r\ninions like we value each other.  I doubt he&#39;s ever been shown appreciation=\r\n for his talents and abilities.  And I have a feeling he&#39;s been given false=\r\n promises.  I&#39;d like to try and talk to him, on a neutral basis, because ev=\r\nen though he doesn&#39;t work for Hydras, he may just have some understanding a=\r\nbout Predacon technology that may come in handy if Night Shift isn&#39;t able t=\r\no get the information on his end, due to the level of risk he&#39;s taking. I d=\r\non&#39;t want him to go over his head on something.  If he needs to abandon the=\r\n mission, please, inform him that I have nothing against it.  In fact, I ho=\r\npe he realizes when it does become too dangerous to pull out.  So this way,=\r\n if he can&#39;t get it, at least I might have a chance to get it on my end.  I=\r\n&#39;m begining to think that maybe I may have to resort to plan B after all.&quot;\n=\r\n\nRat Trap swallows.\n\n&quot; So, Night Shift might not make it?&quot;\n\nTucson shakes h=\r\nis head.\n\n&quot;I highly doubt it.  It was a very risky proposition and I don&#39;t =\r\nknow why I even let him do it.&quot;\n\nRat Trap salutes Tucson Prime.\n\n&quot; Tucson P=\r\nrime, I hereby volunteer my little rat aft ta a call of dangerous rescue du=\r\nty.  If I got ya outa there before I can do it for Night Shift.&quot;\n\nTucson lo=\r\noks to him.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t ask you to do that Rat Trap. You almost lost your lif=\r\ne back there, I can&#39;t have that hang over my head, absolutely not. We&#39;ll se=\r\ne how it plays out.  He may be able to get out of there, but if he puts in =\r\na distress call, I&#39;ll assemble a rescue team for the job. All right, let&#39;s =\r\ndo this.  Lord Elder, Kup, I will inform you of my status after I&#39;ve conver=\r\nsed with Nightstrike.
