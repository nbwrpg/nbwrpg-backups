You&#39;re pathetic. Teltoli, you are a good fighter, \nI salute\n&gt; you. I wish to follow along with you, Teltoli, protect you from \nCarnage, be\n&gt; your traveling partner. Your so called friend thinks she can \nintimidate me,\n&gt; but I shall not do anything to harm her. I swear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instrat smiled to Teltoli and stayed by her side. (Spooky enough?\n&gt; )\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Carnage darkness&quot; &lt;carnage_blood@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 09, 2001 12:09 AM\n&gt; Subject: To Home.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ** Carnage was somewhat glad to see that Teltoli had cheered, her \neyes\n&gt; never\n&gt; &gt; strayed from Instrat.**\n&gt; &gt; &quot; What does that mean now, we&#39;re related?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ** She said this in a lighthearted sarcastic tone even though \ndanger may\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; threatening.\n&gt; &gt; There had been enough arguing.\n&gt; &gt; Carnage heard Teltoli trandform into her robot mode, but remained \nin beast\n&gt; &gt; mode herself...for now. She might have to call upon her guns soon \nand that\n&gt; &gt; called for a transformation. Though she was more eager to get \nhome then\n&gt; &gt; fight it out with Instrat.\n&gt; &gt; Carnage glanced over her shoulder towards Teltoli and flashed her \na look\n&gt; &gt; which spoke that it wasn&#39;t wise to act too haisty, they had \nplenty of time\n&gt; &gt; to beat this bot if it came down to it.\n&gt; &gt; She then turned her head back only to find herself nose to snout \nwith\n&gt; &gt; Instrat, growing and jerking her head back in irder to focus on \nher face\n&gt; &gt; properly. Once that was done Carnage growled at Instrat, her \nteeth inches\n&gt; &gt; away from the fems face, her body not even moving an inch from \nwhere it\n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; originally been.**\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Just hold on here! If you would care to notice that life isn&#39;t \nperfect\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; no one is perfect either.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ** Carnage pointed a claw tipped finger towards Instrat.**\n&gt; &gt; &quot; As I recall a sertain female who was suddenly about to whack my \nhead off\n&gt; &gt; in a clearing back there just because I was trying to get dinner. \nThen you\n&gt; &gt; realized your mistake. MISTAKE!\n&gt; &gt; Even YOU make mistakes, just like Teltoli had. So you see, no ones\n&gt; perfect,\n&gt; &gt; including me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ** Carnage growled and moved towards the pigs on the ground, \nthrowing them\n&gt; &gt; onto her back before moving around Instrat with a growl.**\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Come on Teltoli, we gotta get home.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ** She would leave their guest to the storm.**\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
