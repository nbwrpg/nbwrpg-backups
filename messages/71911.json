Was he alive during\nthe great war between the Autobots and Decepticons (Think of the 80&#39;s\ncartoon or comic books) or did he appear after the defeat of the\nDecepticons and peace accord that came after that? He didn&#39;t have to\nparticipate in anything, but just trying to get a feel for how old he\nis.\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
