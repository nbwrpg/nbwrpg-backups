It&#39;s \nbarely hanging in there as it is. I&#39;m estimating about 45-55% shipwide \ndamage. But that&#39;s a very crude estimate, given what I&#39;ve surveyed so far. \nFor all we know the damage may not be as extensive as we think, though I \nseriously doubt that.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
