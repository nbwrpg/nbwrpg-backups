She \nlooked at his face and couldn&#39;t help but smile as she looked at him. \nHer hand rested on his shoulder. Her hand tingled as touched his \nshoulder.  She coudn&#39;t understand why she suddenly felt her spark try \nto jump out of her chest.  She,for the oddest reason, couldn&#39;t take \nher eyes of him.  She then felt scared.  She pulled away from him and \nlooked down. She didn&#39;t know what to do, but she felt out of place \nall of a sudden. &quot;UH, forgive me commander.&quot; she said in a soft \nvoice, hoping he wouldn&#39;t just shoot her for the heck of it.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Destructor smilied at the small mouse..&quot;Find a little faith.
