It hits in the jungle hard.  The \nDNA scanners activate and 3 beast modes are chosen.  A brown horse, a \ngrey horse, and a Rhesus Monkey.\n\nBrown Horse: Hey not bad. From now on you guys can call me Mustex.\n\nGrey Horse:  Just call me Stallex.\n\nMustex:  Hey what do you want to be called.\n\nMonkey:  We&#39;re more animal now than Machine.  And like animals we \nabandoned our friends at the outpost.  Why fancy up what we are.  \nJust call me Rhesus.\n\nOOC: The question of what happened to Stallex still applies even \nthough I changed the back story.\n\nRhesus:  I developed a little something I called hover-cycles.  They \ncan go at speeds of up to 200 mph.  Thought you might like to know.\n\nRhesus presses a button and 3 come out of the storage room.  He then \nlooks at the readouts of the satalite.\n\nRhesus:  The biggest energon deposite is occupied and far away.  But \nthere is a fair sized one about 25 miles south of here. I think I can \nstill get enough thrust to get the shuttle there, but not to land \nit.  Believe me when this is over salvage will be the only use for \nthis shuttle.So we better take the hover-cycles.\n\nRhesus launches it toward the deposit (no one touch it it&#39;s mine) and \nthey take off on the cycles.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; A shuttle plumets towards earth.

There are transformers on that planet \nby \n&gt; my readouts!

But I know how we can after we&#39;re down there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bot 3 pushes a button and a sattelite is launched and begins \n&gt; orbitting (heck I was going to put it up there anyway).\n&gt; \n&gt; Bot 1: Now we just have to survive impact.\n&gt; \n&gt; They plummet toward Africa.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Well, I think that sounds legal. Would you like your word \ncooked \n&gt; or raw. Mustex, Stallex, and Rhesus do exist lol.\n\n\n"}}
