Und ich bin got a Guns N&#39; Roses CD with \nthem performing live that is pretty cool (Gotta love that guitar in &quot;Sweet \nChild O&#39; Mine&quot;).  And tomorrow I know I&#39;m gonna have a whole crap load of \nwork to do like fill in potholes in my gravel driveway (darn things like a \nquarter a mile long) and outside work because my dad&#39;s insane.  My brother \nhas Monday off.  But tomorrow I&#39;ll get up real early and start the IGL before \nI go off to exercise.  Which will be hard since the exercise machine broke \nand my bro&#39;s to lazy to fix it.  Anyway, IGL WILL, and I mean WILL start \nSunday or Monday.  \n\n-L.U.\n\n"}}
