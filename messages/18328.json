But to add to that, she was tired as \nwell.\nZyber stretched and yawned as she sat by the fire, but then finally got to \nher feet and looked over to the bed.\nThis botcreature would sleep easily tonight, but she would check up on him \nevery once in a while. Other then that, she had some things to do.\nLike get some breakfast, clean out the cave, store some roots and other \nvariouse deeds. Ones that would keep her busy all day.\nZyber let out a tired sigh, no rest for the good.\nWith that she looked at the bot again, expecting to fall asleep soon, and \nthen turned and began to head out of the chambers.\nThe words she spoke over her shoulder*\n\n&quot; I&#39;ll be back soon, I have to go and bring in the morning meal. Get some \nrest, I will wake you when it is ready.&quot;\n\n* And with that she left the room, transforming into beast mode and heading \nfor the exit to her den.\nAs she approached she spotted something that would just make her meal quest \na little diffacult...snow.\nIt was falling quickly and thick, and it would cover and wild signs of her \nprey.\nOh, well...she had to try anyway, she was running low of stored meat and \nneeded to restock.\nSo, with a shake of her fur she headed out into the snow, fading into the \nbackground like a ghost of the wild.*\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
