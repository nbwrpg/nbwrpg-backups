But something raw like that...she would doubt he would like it \neither.\nMaybe that was a lesson...no...it WAS one. They would have to learn to \ncontrole their thoughts, so that they weren&#39;t so loud and powerful.\nProwls anger along had nearly brought her to her knees.\n&lt; I&#39;m glad he&#39;s not the enemy and on our side.&gt; was her thought as she \nregained her mind and looked up from the ground.\nShe would also have to learn not to take those feelings the wrong way \nagain...this was new...and she didn&#39;t know how to react properly.\nShe even found herself wishing that she could just speak with er mouth \ninstead of mer mind. It was much easier.\n\nBut Iron Raptor just watched as Prowl stood tall in front of Shadow, looking \nat him and then the enemy. Not moving from where she stood, crossing her \narms as the cloth on her mack fluttered in the wind.\nLooking out from her helm.\nShe had only tried to help, but if Prowl wanted to go this alone then let \nhim.\nShadow had challenged HIM after all.\n&lt; I guess...being cooped up in that base made me eager to fight again.&gt;\nStill not knowing just how her body could have acted like it had, without \nher mind to guide it...or so it seemed.\nBut then her eyes turned to Prowl.*\n\n&lt; You can battle if you want.&gt;\n\n* She finally decided, moving back to that her shoulders were facing towards \nthe direction of the CF.*\n\n&lt; But I&#39;m going back.&gt;\n\n* And with that she turned her back to the battle, walking off towards their \ndestination.*\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
