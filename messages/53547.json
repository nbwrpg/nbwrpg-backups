Jan\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;=\r\n \n  &gt; There once was a man named George Thomas, pastor in\n  &gt; a small New E=\r\nngland town. One Easter Sunday morning\n  &gt; he came to the Church carrying a=\r\n rusty, bent, old\n  &gt; bird cage, and set it by the pulpit.  Eyebrows were r=\r\naised and, as \n  if in response, PastorThomas began to speak...\n  &gt; &quot;I was =\r\nwalking through town yesterday when I saw a\n  &gt; young boy coming toward me =\r\nswinging this bird cage.\n  &gt; On the bottom of the cage were three little wi=\r\nld birds, shivering \n  with cold and fright. I stopped the\n  &gt; lad and aske=\r\nd, &quot;What you got there, son?&quot;\n  &gt; Just some old birds,&quot; came the reply.\n  &gt;=\r\n What are you gonna do with them?&quot; I asked.\n  &gt; Take &#39;em home and have fun =\r\nwith &#39;em,&quot; he answered.\n  &gt; I&#39;m gonna tease &#39;em and pull out their feathers=\r\n to\n  &gt; make &#39;em fight. I&#39;m gonna have a real good time.&quot;\n  &gt; &quot;But you&#39;ll g=\r\net tired of those birds sooner or\n  &gt; later. What will you do?&quot;\n  &gt; &quot;Oh, I =\r\ngot some cats,&quot; said the little boy. &quot;They\n  &gt; like birds. I&#39;ll take &#39;em to=\r\n them.&quot;\n  &gt; The pastor was silent for a moment.\n  &gt; How much do you want fo=\r\nr those birds, son?&quot;\n  &gt; Huh?? !!!

He placed it in the boy&#39;s ha=\r\nnd. In a flash, the boy \n  was gone. The pastor picked up the cage and gent=\r\nly carried it to the \n  end of the alley where there was a tree and a grass=\r\ny spot. Setting \n  the cage down, he opened the door, and by softly tapping=\r\n the bars \n  persuaded the birds out, setting them free. Well, that explain=\r\ned the \n  empty bird cage on the pulpit, and then the pastor began to tell\n=\r\n  &gt; this story.  One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation. \n  Sat=\r\nan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and \n  boasti=\r\nng.  &quot;Yes, sir, I just caught the world full of people down \n  there.
