Perplex still stands back up, which\nmakes Burning Hammer laugh.\n\nBurning Hammer: You know, if you just cooperated, your detah would be less\npainful!\n\nPerplex held out a hand. Burning Hammer attempted to smash his hand. Perplex\nmoved and flipped off Burning Hammer. He fired from his hand and knocked\nBurnign hammer down. Burning Hammer realized that he had been tricked, this\nguy could fire at him without using a weapon! Perplex proceeded to kick\nBurning Hammer as hard as he could, about 20 times, until Burning Hammer\nspit up blood. But, Perplex was shocked. Burning Hammer was not only\nsmiling, but laughing. he flipped to his feet and got into a fighting pose.\nPerplex stepped backwards.\n\nBurning Hammer: Stop playing with me! Fight!...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 12, 2001 1:46 AM\nSubject: Termitron.\n\n\n&gt; Termitron::\n&gt;\n&gt; Termitron picked up TRinity, and he walked where TEchnosis was.
