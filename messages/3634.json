The darts carried a very heavy\nvirus on their tips that would drop the most skilled\nof bots in nano-clicks, the virus eating away at their\ninternal circuits and leaving nothing more then\nliquid.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages with Yahoo!
