It was a &#39;bot, not a monster! The sun continued to beat down on him as \nhe stood, his black feathers soaking up each and every ray. His own beast \nmode seemed to amplify the heat ten fold, and his unpadded feet were \nbeginning to burn:\n\n&quot;M-Maximize!&quot;\n\nThe hot wind singed his feathers as Rion transformed. He stood barely four \nfeet at best, and he was tall for his age! After some careful positioning \nand near falls, Rion was able to stand and balance his massive wings. They \nwere definitely going to be a problem, but he could worry about that later:\n\n&quot;I&#39;m looking for a friend, have you seen her?&quot;\n\nRion was trying to think of somthing else he could tell them about Diana. \nHer beast mode was probably different, and she wasn&#39;t anywhere within \nearshot as far as he knew. Slag! Why did they have to get seperated?! Now he \nwas lost, in a desert, surrounded by spiders and scorpions. What could \npossibly be worse?\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
