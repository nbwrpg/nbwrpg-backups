You&#39;re going \nto get us all killed. Take the others and get the pit out of here. That&#39;s an \norder. If you don&#39;t follow this one, you&#39;re going to have a nice long talk \nwith Iron Raptor.&quot;\n\nReptilica waits for the Maximals to answer, ready to give the order to \nfire....\n\n"}}
