Promise. & =\r\nSorry for the long post.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor watched Feline leave the room, =\r\na rather flustered \nsigh \n&gt; escaping from her throat.\n&gt; She had thought tha=\r\nt she wouldn&#39;t be very comfortable once she \nexplained why \n&gt; she had calle=\r\nd her here, knowing that the Alliance frightened her \nso badly. \n&gt; And now =\r\nit almost seems as if she had made matters worse.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sat up and =\r\nleaned her elbows against her knees as she \nhears \n&gt; Prowl and Hot Rod, loo=\r\nking at the floor with a tired look in her \neyes.\n&gt; Feline was too upset to=\r\n go on this mission now, just as she had \nfeared. So, \n&gt; now it was onto pl=\r\nan B.\n&gt; But first, to answer both of these bot&#39;s questions. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Oh. Ta=\r\nvatron and Dinobot&#39;s signatures both stopped in\nGrid 16 and \nI asked \n&gt; Fel=\r\nine if she would run a Search and Recover mission for me. To go \nand see \n&gt;=\r\n just why both of them aren&#39;t moving anymore, and if they&#39;re\ndamaged \nor in=\r\n \n&gt; stasis lock to go and recover them. But she&#39;s had some rough\nspots \nwit=\r\nh the \n&gt; Alliance and Grid 16 is just too close to their base for comfort. =\r\n\nSo, she&#39;s \n&gt; upset about it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor then the looked up at the=\r\n ceiling for a moment before \nresting \n&gt; her head on her heads, looking at =\r\nthe holo-projections of the two \nmissing \n&gt; Maximals. Wondering if Feline&#39;s=\r\n fear for Dinobot was part of\nit, or \nmaybe \n&gt; just a fear of males in gene=\r\nral.\n&gt; She tilted her head to the side for a moment with another sigh.\n&gt; We=\r\nll, by what Feline had told her about her experiences with the \nAlliance, \n=\r\n&gt; she couldn&#39;t really blame her for her fears. But that cat-bot\nwould \nhave=\r\n to \n&gt; learn how to act around the male gender without jittering all the \nt=\r\nime, it \n&gt; was something that would take her a bit of time to get over but =\r\n\neventually \n&gt; she would=85she had too.\n&gt; Iron Raptor continued to look at =\r\nthe projections.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; So, I&#39;ve finally decided that=85I&#39;m not going to\ns=\r\nend her out. She \ncan stay \n&gt; here and calm herself down while I go with a =\r\nbot or two and see \nwhat&#39;s up \n&gt; with our missing Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * That wa=\r\ns her plan B, but there was also a part that Feline was \ngoing to \n&gt; play i=\r\nn it as well.\n&gt; She wasn&#39;t going to send her out and deal with the problems=\r\n of \nbringing both \n&gt; of her Maximals back, but she had a feeling that at l=\r\neast one of \nthem was \n&gt; extremely injured and needed immediate medical att=\r\nention. And she \ncould \n&gt; almost bet her Second Beast Mode on that Dinobot =\r\nwas that one.\n&gt; But that also meant that a CR chamber couldn&#39;t heal him all=\r\n the \nway, so he \n&gt; would need excess attention outside before finally bein=\r\ng placed in \none. That \n&gt; was where Feline came in.\n&gt; She would treat him w=\r\nith the medical attention that he needed. But \nsince her \n&gt; fear of males i=\r\ns the major thing to think about, she would make \nsure that \n&gt; Dinobot woul=\r\nd be offline for repairs before she let Feline near him.\n&gt; Iron Raptor thou=\r\nght that it was a fairly good plan, but she would \ndiscuss it \n&gt; further wi=\r\nth Prowl on her way to Grin16. A second opinion was \nalways handy.\n&gt; She op=\r\nened her com-link to Feline with another of her sighs.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Feline? Abou=\r\nt the recovery mission: Don&#39;t worry about it.\nI&#39;ve \ndecided \n&gt; that you can=\r\n stay behind on this one, give you a chance to calm \ndown a bit \n&gt; and gets=\r\n use to the place a bit more. I&#39;ll be going instead.\nBut=85I \nwant you \n&gt; t=\r\no be ready for when we get back, I have a few things for you to \ndo. Does \n=\r\n&gt; that sound alright?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor waited with her com-link open, re=\r\nady to receive \nFelines \n&gt; reply.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n__________________________________=\r\n____________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail fro=\r\nm MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
