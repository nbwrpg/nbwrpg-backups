But I think we have a way to\n&gt; reproduce it controllably, as long as you think your spark can handle\n&gt; it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nightshift looks to Nightlight with a friendly smile.  He was happy to \n&gt;&gt; see\n&gt;&gt; that Nightlight remembered who he was.  He had also been concerned for \n&gt;&gt; her\n&gt;&gt; safety as were the others.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; And I&#39;d go through it again too, if I had ta.  It&#39;s real nice ta have \n&gt;&gt; ya\n&gt;&gt; back.  I just wish we knew what Hydras weakness is.  The problem is that\n&gt;&gt; guy&#39;s got too many sets of eyes on &#39;em and in his alt form... Wait Thats \n&gt;&gt; it,\n&gt;&gt; why didn&#39;t I think of this before?  Nightlight, I get it now.  I bet that \n&gt;&gt; if\n&gt;&gt; he lost all visual capabilities, Hydras would be severely compromised. \n&gt;&gt; On\n&gt;&gt; the other hand, Tucson lost the last fight because Hydras had &#39;em at a\n&gt;&gt; disadvantage.  But if Tucson took out all his visual circuitry, then he\n&gt;&gt; would have the upper hand.  Tucson&#39;s been blind a long time, it&#39;s second\n&gt;&gt; nature ta him ta fight that way.  But it&#39;s not for Hydras. &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He turns his head over to Bump.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; How would we go about knock&#39;n out Hydras visual circuitry?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a noncommital shrug from BUMP, &quot;Well a simple flash-bang\n&gt; grenade could do it. It is basically a bright light followed by a\n&gt; deafening noise.&quot; He shrugged again, &quot;I am not typically a weapons\n&gt; engineer, but they should be in the weapons stores.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; BUMP glanced at the readouts displaying NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s vital signs,\n&gt; nodding when everything looked good. He looked back at NIGHTSHIFT,\n&gt; &quot;Did you have anything specific in mind?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
