He waited until \nStingtra went into the water, then he laid down. He went on his side, \ndrawing his knees up and squinted. He didn&#39;t clearly understand. Why did he \nfeel this way? His stomach hurt. He covered his head with a scaly arm. He \ngroaned and closed his eyes. There was something going on that he wasn&#39;t \npaying attention to.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
