Her\n&gt; &gt; leopard skin was starting to fall off.  Her arms and legs were bare\n&gt; metal.\n&gt; &gt; Her tail was barren of skin as well and her face looked like she had\n&gt; on an\n&gt; &gt; old cat mask instead of her normal skin.  She fell to her knees and\n&gt; cried.\n&gt; &gt; As soon as she hit the ground, the rest of her skin fell off her\n&gt; metalic\n&gt; &gt; body.  She was now all crome.  Her looked like a full figured,\n&gt; slender,\n&gt; &gt; crome plated feline female bot.  The pain was starting to subside\n&gt; but she\n&gt; &gt; was still in agony.  She lay on her side on the ground, in the old\n&gt; leopard\n&gt; &gt; skin that once covered her body.  She meowed quietly, pulling the\n&gt; fur over\n&gt; &gt; her body and curled up in her old pelt.\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
