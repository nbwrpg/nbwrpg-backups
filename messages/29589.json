The ones she&#39;d known were savage ferocious\n&gt; beasts with\n&gt; &gt; insect like skin that made them difficult to kill. &quot;My technology\n&gt; was meant\n&gt; &gt; for science, exploration, and colinization purposes, not to create\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; uncontrollable killer.&quot; She could tell that Zardus&#39; attention wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; entirely on her. she wished she could transform to her half mode so\n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; could use her third eye to see what he was doing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, there&#39;ll be security,&quot; Zardus says to Lady Hawk after ending\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the transmission to Mortem. &quot;If the bot is uncontrollable it&#39;ll\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be redone. Once you&#39;re successful, you&#39;ll be free to go.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This was the best offer she had heard yet. She wanted away from\n&gt; this group.\n&gt; &gt; so far she&#39;d been wrapped up by one member(Najah) and shot at by\n&gt; another\n&gt; &gt; (Gotron). If these bots were supposed to be on her side then she\n&gt; hated to\n&gt; &gt; think what they&#39;d do to thier enemies. &quot;I&#39;m sure we can find a\n&gt; comprimise.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She says willing to do almost anything to get out of there.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
