Doh!\n\n  See, Skulletron had a spec=\r\nial mental ability, he had the ability to connect his mind with others&#39; min=\r\nds, and see what they are thinking, without them knowing.  They wouldn&#39;t kn=\r\now that he connected with their minds unless he told them, or they figured =\r\nout some other way like that.  And, here&#39;s the part that his ability is all=\r\n about, or that he has mostly used it for.  Some of his victims have been Z=\r\nardus(by request), and two other characters named Ga-I forget, and BrightBl=\r\nade.  And also, Skulletron used it,(sorry I did that without notice guys, w=\r\nho remember that!) to sort of gain access to everything, codes, cameras, on=\r\n the CF.  And now, I&#39;m gonna use it again, on Motormaster!  Muahaha!  Don&#39;t=\r\n worry, it&#39;s not THAT devastating...Unless I made Skulle-er-Slaughter, make=\r\n Motormaster commit suicide(or convince him.)  See, he can display images a=\r\nnd sounds to try and change one&#39;s emotions and feelings about something or =\r\nsomebody.  He made two people fall in love by displaying images of hearts a=\r\nround one person, and stuff.  And, when Zardus asked him to, Skulletron eve=\r\nntually made Zardus give off a little giggle, by displaying (corny) humorou=\r\ns things.  Now, in my next post, tell what Motormaster feels.....\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0091_01C0F2B0.AB74D360\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.50.4134.600&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#c0c0c0&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Okay, I&#39;=\r\nll spill the beans on Slaughter&#39;s \nabilty.&nbsp; Okay, here goes.&nbsp; Oka=\r\ny, I got it.&nbsp; Okay, get \nready.&nbsp; Okay, I say okay a lot.&nbsp; Ok=\r\nay?&nbsp; Okay!&nbsp; Okay, here \ngoes.&nbsp; Okay, I said thay already, so=\r\n I&#39;ll just say it all now.&nbsp; Damn, \nI&#39;m serious, I cant stop saying oka=\r\ny!&nbsp; DAMN!&nbsp; *slaps self silly for 45 \nminutes straight!*&nbsp; Whe=\r\nw, oka--THERE I GO AGAIN!&nbsp;&nbsp; *holds breath \nfor 20 minutes.....nea=\r\nrly dies*&nbsp; No more okays!&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; \nDoh!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&nbsp; See, Skulletron had a special mental \nability, he had the abili=\r\nty to connect his mind with others&#39; minds, and see what \nthey are thinking,=\r\n without them knowing.&nbsp; They wouldn&#39;t know that he \nconnected with the=\r\nir minds unless he told them, or they figured out some other \nway like that=\r\n.&nbsp; And, here&#39;s the part that his ability is all about, or that \nhe has=\r\n mostly used it for.&nbsp; Some of his victims have been Zardus(by \nrequest=\r\n), and two other characters named Ga-I forget, and BrightBlade.&nbsp; And \n=\r\nalso, Skulletron used it,(sorry I did that without notice guys, who remembe=\r\nr \nthat!) to sort of gain access to everything, codes, cameras, on the CF.&=\r\nnbsp; \nAnd now, I&#39;m gonna use it again, on Motormaster!&nbsp; Muahaha!&nbsp=\r\n; Don&#39;t \nworry, it&#39;s not THAT devastating...Unless I made Skulle-er-Slaught=\r\ner, make \nMotormaster commit suicide(or convince him.)&nbsp; See, he can di=\r\nsplay images \nand sounds to try and change one&#39;s emotions and feelings abou=\r\nt something or \nsomebody.&nbsp; He made two people fall in love by displayi=\r\nng images of hearts \naround one person, and stuff.&nbsp; And, when Zardus a=\r\nsked him to, Skulletron \neventually made Zardus give off a little giggle, b=\r\ny displaying (corny) humorous \nthings.&nbsp; Now, in my next post, tell wha=\r\nt Motormaster \nfeels.....&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0091_01C0F2B0.AB74D360--\r\n\n"}}
