The rest of you, stay put - and be ready to \n&gt; go at a moment&#39;s notice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Rogue commander leads the way outside.  He knows full well the \n&gt; objections his fellows would raise if he gave them the chance; until \n&gt; an alliance is officially made, the Maximals are still enemies, and \n&gt; going alone into an enemy camp is dangerous.  But it&#39;s a risk he&#39;s \n&gt; not prepared to shrug off onto someone else, and if the Maximals are \n&gt; to put their trust in the Rogues, they must be shown the Rogues are \n&gt; willing to trust them.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil thinks for a moment.

That leaves the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Indeed.  Shall me make them an offer?&quot; Devilcat invites, \n&gt; extending \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his hand.  One by one, the other Rogues place their hands on his, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; forming a loose circle.  (There&#39;s room for Yggdrasil to join, if \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wants.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Our greatest strength has always been unity.  I&#39;m glad to see \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; still holds true.&quot; Devilcat says with a smile.\n\n\n"}}
