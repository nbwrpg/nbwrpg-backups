He was a mess.....definetly\n&gt; needed a CR chamber. At the moment she was arriving at Kitkats, or the\nPACK&#39;s\n&gt; base, in a small transport. She found Inferno laying the ground in stasis.\n&gt; For now he would have to remain inside the vessle.\n&gt;     The ship soared just above the treetops, scattering birds and animals\n&gt; alike. In the distance she could see the base, or cave, as it would seem.\nShe\n&gt; typed the landing protocols in and set the ship down 30 meters from the\n&gt; entrance. Aracnia exited and began to walk to the entrace, turning to\nraise\n&gt; shileds on the transport.\n&gt;     The entrance was empty, quite suspicious, but not uncommon in these\ndays.\n&gt; The two metal doors stood silent as she stood before them. Looking, she\nsaw a\n&gt; panel and pushed a button, an intercom.\n&gt;     &quot;Commander Black Aracnia, of the Predacon Forces, wishes to speak with\n&gt; Commander Kitkat. Please acknowledge.&quot; She said cooly, not letting her\ntemper\n&gt; get the better of her.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Paralysis, Tarantulas, Aerostreak, Tankkor, and Rampage remained at\nthe\n&gt; ship, as did Quickstrike. They were going through routines and keeping the\n&gt; ship safe. It needed a lot of maintenence, but if Kitkats troops moved in\n&gt; there would be no problem.\n&gt;     That was the question after all.....where were the two groups going to\n&gt; stay? Together at one base, or divided at two? Aracnia tried the divided\n&gt; part, and it failed. But Kitkat seemed to be a better leader, so it might\n&gt; work.\n&gt;     &quot;Computer, locate Black Aracnia.&quot; Tarantulas said. He was in the dark\n&gt; bowles of the Predacon Cruiser. It was rusty, deserted, and scary. The\n&gt; bravest Predacon wouldnt even go in there. Thats why Tarantulas liked it\nso\n&gt; much.....it was his own little nest of terror.\n&gt;     Suspended above, amongst the pipes and iron works, were the bodies of\n&gt; small and large animals he had eaten and left to rot. Parts of a few\n&gt; mainenence bots scattered the web too, he had eaten those when the animals\n&gt; had become scarce.\n&gt;     The computer responded, &quot;Commander Black Aracnia is outside the ships\n&gt; scanning range.&quot;\n&gt;     Tarantulas rubbed his hairy palms together. That ment she was at the\n&gt; meeting. And Quickstrike, he beloved knight in mismatched armor, was\nasleep.\n&gt; The spider hated Quickstrike. He had programmed Black Aracnia long ago to\nbe\n&gt; his mate.....now she was in love with Quickstrike. Tarantulas wouldnt\nstand\n&gt; for it, not much longer anyhow. Revenge would be sweet....if he could only\n&gt; muster up a plan to do so. The witch was pregnant, prehaps he could use it\n&gt; agianst her, somehow.\n&gt;     He transformed into robot mode and left his sanctuary. Entering the\nmain\n&gt; corridor he ran into the ever moody Rampage. The self appointed ruler of\nthe\n&gt; Predacons when Aracnia was gone. He was a tyrant, he would make Megatron\n&gt; proud.\n&gt;     &quot;Where have you been, insect? The ships computer diagnostic wont run\n&gt; itself!&quot; He said, narrowing his already evil looking optics at the\nscientist.\n&gt; Rampage was alot stranger than Tarantulas, and he thought he was alot\nsmarter.\n&gt;     Tarantulas pushed past him and went into the bridge. He would work,\nfor\n&gt; now. When this little merger was complete, Megatron dead, Hell Beast\n&gt; banished, he would step out of hiding.....he wold have his revenge on all\nof\n&gt; them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
