He\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; uses sharp he=\r\naring to pick up the smallest of sounds, even those deemed to\n&gt; &gt; be comple=\r\ntely silent. He pays close attention to how the ground seems to\n&gt; &gt; vibrate=\r\n under his feet, giving him indication that although hidden, he\n&gt; &gt; could\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; tell where his opponent was. He slowly brings Straight Shot around. With=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; one of his arms injured, he had to do things in reverse. With the good=\r\n arm,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; hold the weight of his weapon, and with the bad arm, pull the=\r\n trigger. He\n&gt; &gt; had often practiced alternating between his hands, and was=\r\n glad he had done\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; so. Being ambidextrous was an attribute. He loads=\r\n an arrow specifically\n&gt; &gt; designed to be barbed and most difficult to remo=\r\nve. He knew that it was\n&gt; &gt; better just to disable his enemy rather than de=\r\nstroy him. He needed\n&gt; &gt; Nightrazor for questioning. Most effective area of=\r\n targeting, would be the\n&gt; &gt; knee joint Imbed the arrow in a joint and his =\r\nopponent would find it most\n&gt; &gt; difficult to abmulate, yet it would not kil=\r\nl or destroy him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now within striking distance, as determined by hi=\r\ns sonar sensors, he sends\n&gt; &gt; out short pulse emissions to pinpoint his are=\r\na of targeting. His reading is\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; quick, yet, anything could happen at=\r\n this point. He aims, and attempts to\n&gt; &gt; launch an arrow deep into his ene=\r\nmy&#39;s knee, if his calculations were\n&gt; &gt; correct.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Steady Straight S=\r\nhot. We need to make this count.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot programs her mechan=\r\nisms for optimal effeciency.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Talk about a shot in the dark.

Let&#39;s=\r\n see how you guys like be&#39;n trapped like rats! CHAAARGE!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Outside the battle rages as Hydras, Scourge and the swee=\r\nps attempt to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reign\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down fire on the more land bound Maximals. =\r\nThe sweeps fan out, using\n&gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; superior maneuverability to its g=\r\nreatest advantage as they try to come at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Maximals from all sides =\r\nat once!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rat Trap and Nightshift&#39;s weapons fire back up into th=\r\ne air, although\n&gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time it seems to be of no avail as the sweep=\r\ns twist and turn to avoid\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The sweeps are nothing if not s=\r\nmooth and agile!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The sweeps come back for another run when Silv=\r\nerbolt and Noctorro sweep\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from around one side, their weapon&#39;s=\r\n fire cutting into the sweeps,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; damaging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one, and sending anothe=\r\nr falling to the ground with a plume of smoke and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire trailing after=\r\n it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The sweeps seemed temporarily stunned with the Fuzor&#39;s and=\r\n the Maximal&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; charge into the battle, that is until Cyclonus, Deepst=\r\nryke and Waspinator\n&gt; &gt; &gt; show up!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Waspinator angles in, openin=\r\ng fire on Rat Trap, &quot;Waspinator say he\n&gt; &gt; getting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tired of blowing u=\r\np Maximals!&quot; he chuckled as he said this, his wings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; buzzing as he con=\r\ntinued firing at Rat Trap. &quot;Then again maybe not!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile th=\r\ne floating mobile cannon slash weapons satellite floats in\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ai=\r\nr, orienting its powerful main gun on Nightshift and opening up with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbursts from his powerful ion blast cannons!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However last, but d=\r\nefinitely NOT least Cyclonus floats in, looking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; majestic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and al=\r\nmost regal as he maneuvered in over the battle. In his jet mode he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lo=\r\noked to be like a hawk or an eagle, staring down at some bit of prey on\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the ground, waiting for just the right time to pounce on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n There is a small click from beneath his wings and then twin pylons drop\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them, their aft sends igniting and they take off targeting t=\r\nhe Maximals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; below!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *It would seem that this battle has b=\r\negun in earnest!*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
