She had dug deep \ninside\n&gt;   &gt; the earth. And there she had remained all this time.  Her \nsantuary\n&gt;   &gt; away from the war. After the fight with a rattlesnake that \nnearly\n&gt;   &gt; cost her her life, and the death of her beloved leader, she \nneeded to\n&gt;   &gt; find a place to rest. Away from the war that had been brewing \nup on\n&gt;   &gt; the surface. Now, she lay curled up in her den, under the \nground.\n&gt;   &gt; Sound asleep and snoozing peacefully.  Her whiskers twitched \nand her\n&gt;   &gt; head nudged against her paw.  She slowly opened her eyes and \nyawned.\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Ooohhhhh, ouch.&quot; she groaned softly to herself. &quot;Nothing like \nwaking\n&gt;   &gt; up to cramps after a long nap.&quot; Her body felt stiff from such a \nlong\n&gt;   &gt; period of time without activity.  She was in mouse mode and \nstretched\n&gt;   &gt; her small body, trying to get out the kinks. The only light in \nher\n&gt;   &gt; den was the light coming from her own optics. But being a \nmouse, she\n&gt;   &gt; could see in near pitch black.  &quot;Oh my,&quot; she said as she put \nher paw\n&gt;   &gt; to her belly,&quot;I guess I need something to eat.&quot;  She checked her\n&gt;   &gt; small energon compartment. It was empty. She sighed \nheavily.  &quot;Well,\n&gt;   &gt; if I&#39;m out of food, I have to go forage. But that means,&quot; she\n&gt;   &gt; swallowed hard,&quot; I have to go up onto the surface.&quot; She looked \ndown\n&gt;   &gt; and shook her head. &quot;Well, I knew I would have to go up sooner \nor\n&gt;   &gt; later. Well, here&#39;s nothing.&quot;  She started dig her way towards \nthe\n&gt;   &gt; surface.  She broke ground and saw the sun. She had to cover \nher eyes\n&gt;   &gt; as the bright light shined down on her.  She crawled up and\n&gt;   &gt; transformed into bot mode. She dusted herself off and looked \naround.\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Whoah!&quot;  She looked around and saw that things had changed \nsince she\n&gt;   &gt; went into hybernation.  She wondered how much things has changed\n&gt;   &gt; since she left.  When she started her her slumber, she had \nburried\n&gt;   &gt; herself a few miles south of the base that KitKat had been \nleader in.\n&gt;   &gt; Now, things have changed.  She needed to see what was out \nthere. She\n&gt;   &gt; started walking to the old base to see what she would find.  She\n&gt;   &gt; walked in bot mode, but kept out of sight, just in case things\n&gt;   &gt; weren&#39;t going well for the preds.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; OOC: OK, I need help, like an update on what&#39;s new here folks. \nI&#39;m\n&gt;   &gt; back for a while. So, I could use some help here. Oh, I&#39;m only\n&gt;   &gt; playing DarkMouse. So those who have my other chars need to \nstill\n&gt;   &gt; keep them. Sorry, but with my limited time on line, I can only \nwork\n&gt;   &gt; one char at the moment. Sorry about that.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
