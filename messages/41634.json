She had dug deep inside\n&gt; the earth. And there she had remained all this time.  Her santuary\n&gt; away from the war. After the fight with a rattlesnake that nearly\n&gt; cost her her life, and the death of her beloved leader, she needed to\n&gt; find a place to rest. Away from the war that had been brewing up on\n&gt; the surface. Now, she lay curled up in her den, under the ground.\n&gt; Sound asleep and snoozing peacefully.  Her whiskers twitched and her\n&gt; head nudged against her paw.  She slowly opened her eyes and yawned.\n&gt; &quot;Ooohhhhh, ouch.&quot; she groaned softly to herself. &quot;Nothing like waking\n&gt; up to cramps after a long nap.&quot; Her body felt stiff from such a long\n&gt; period of time without activity.  She was in mouse mode and stretched\n&gt; her small body, trying to get out the kinks. The only light in her\n&gt; den was the light coming from her own optics. But being a mouse, she\n&gt; could see in near pitch black.  &quot;Oh my,&quot; she said as she put her paw\n&gt; to her belly,&quot;I guess I need something to eat.&quot;  She checked her\n&gt; small energon compartment. It was empty. She sighed heavily.  &quot;Well,\n&gt; if I&#39;m out of food, I have to go forage. But that means,&quot; she\n&gt; swallowed hard,&quot; I have to go up onto the surface.&quot; She looked down\n&gt; and shook her head. &quot;Well, I knew I would have to go up sooner or\n&gt; later. Well, here&#39;s nothing.&quot;  She started dig her way towards the\n&gt; surface.  She broke ground and saw the sun. She had to cover her eyes\n&gt; as the bright light shined down on her.  She crawled up and\n&gt; transformed into bot mode. She dusted herself off and looked around.\n&gt; &quot;Whoah!&quot;  She looked around and saw that things had changed since she\n&gt; went into hybernation.  She wondered how much things has changed\n&gt; since she left.  When she started her her slumber, she had burried\n&gt; herself a few miles south of the base that KitKat had been leader in.\n&gt; Now, things have changed.  She needed to see what was out there. She\n&gt; started walking to the old base to see what she would find.  She\n&gt; walked in bot mode, but kept out of sight, just in case things\n&gt; weren&#39;t going well for the preds.\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: OK, I need help, like an update on what&#39;s new here folks. I&#39;m\n&gt; back for a while. So, I could use some help here. Oh, I&#39;m only\n&gt; playing DarkMouse. So those who have my other chars need to still\n&gt; keep them. Sorry, but with my limited time on line, I can only work\n&gt; one char at the moment. Sorry about that.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
