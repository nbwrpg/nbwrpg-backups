You can Retire,\n&gt; Little one &quot;He said to Nightlight&quot; keep open your comlink &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes Sir&quot;said the femme and she left the room and headed to her quarters\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor Arrived too and he sit down\n\nCyclonus turned as Hydras entered and nodded agreeably. &quot;Greetings\nHydras.&quot; Cyclonus said as he came to stand in front of the three new\nsoldiers.\n\nCyclonus gestured at them as he continued spaeking, &quot;You may recognize\nthem from the last battle we had.&quot; Cyclonus&#39; voice dropped as he\ntalked, but the confidence in it continued. &quot;These are my progeny.&quot; he\nsaid carefully. &quot;I created them with the last remnants of the matrix I\nhad absorbed, and gave them life.&quot;\n\nCyclonus gestured at each one in turn, &quot;The first is called\nDeepstryke, and he is an excellent tactical commander soldier.&quot;\n\nAs he spoke, the largest of the three soldiers stepped foward and\nsaluted Hydras.\n\n&quot;The next is named Phobia.&quot; Cyclonus said, gesturing at the red and\nwhite female soldier. &quot;She is an excellent warrior, but specializes in\npsychological warfare.&quot;\n\nThe female nodded at Hydras, smiling coyly, at the last moment her\nsmile becoming more impish and daring.\n\n&quot;The last is called Nightrazor.&quot; Cyclonus said as he gestured at the\ndark colored soldier. &quot;He is one of the best infiltration experts I\nhave seen. Able to become invisible and teleport, there are few places\nhe cannot get to unseen.&quot;\n\nCyclonus turned back to Hydras, &quot;He is the one I had watching the Ark\nall this time.&quot;\n\nNightrazor just nodded at Hydras, saying nothing.\n\nDeepstryke nodded as Cyclonus concluded the introductions, &quot;Hydras, we\nhave come in repsonse to Cyclonus&#39; call to arms. We have heard that\nyou have captured the Autobot leader. Is this true?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
