Her arm trembled as she listened to \n&gt; screams of pain, missile blasts and fireball hisses. She would cry \nif \n&gt; she could, but bots didn&#39;t have tear ducts.\n&gt; \n&gt; How could she live with this war? She couldn&#39;t! She wasn&#39;t designed \n&gt; for war, and she hated it! Bots did this to each other all the \ntime? \n&gt; No..\n&gt; \n&gt; She gasped in horror, and dropped her weapon, taking a step back. \nShe \n&gt; was doomed to live with this all her life?\n&gt; \n&gt; Not if she could help it, she wasn&#39;t going to live like this. \nTeltoli \n&gt; put on her cloaking, and flew up into the air, undetected and \nunseen. \n&gt; She gave WindLord one last look, closed her eyes briefly, and flew \n&gt; away. Flew away from the battle, the pain, and the Maximals.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry..&quot; She whispered, her back turned from the slaughter.\n\n\n"}}
