This was sure to prove ... interesting. With a \nsilent command from Zardus, the four jump out of the bushes, guns ready and \nsurrounding the maximals.\n\n&quot;How nice to see you, maximals,&quot; Zardus says, smiling evilly at the \nsurrounded maximals. It would be very stupid of them to fight at this point, \nthey were outnumbered two-to-one, &quot;You are going to accompany us back to my \nbase. Resistance will result in your deaths.&quot;\n\nReptilica and Bloodystrike, standing behind Iron Raptor and Tavatron, raise \ntheir weapons, aiming them at the maximals&#39; necks. Perndabot stands by \nZardus&#39; side, dwarfing all the other bots with his giant size, his rifle \naimed at Iron Raptor&#39;s head.\n\n"}}
