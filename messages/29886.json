His shape was that of the tiger&#39;s, but he \nwas much bigger, with scales instead of fur. There were two bumps in \nhis back where his jetpack was. He approaches the energon, intending \non mining it.\n\n&quot;If someone makes me a better offer, I will give you two weeks to top \nit, during which I won&#39;t serve either you or the other patron, and if \nyou don&#39;t top the offer, I go to them.

It didnt \nmatter if\n&gt; he was fully recovered, he didnt want to fight this robot, for this \nrobot\n&gt; was probably his chance to greatness. He stood back up, flexing his \nmetalic\n&gt; arms from the surge of energy, he must have more he thought. &quot;Thank \nyou&quot; he\n&gt; said, then he looked puzzled for a moment. &quot;What kind of payment do \nyou\n&gt; take?&quot; Megatron asked curiously. Normally in most of the metallic \nplanets,\n&gt; energon was used as currency. Now he didnt know what this robot \nwanted.\n\n\n"}}
