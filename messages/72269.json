An exchange in return for the\n&gt; truce and our cooperation that they will have to pay to weaken and divide\n&gt; them further. In return for our assistance, we should request an intact\n&gt; stasis pod with sparked protoform to remake toa  Predacon.  If they want our\n&gt; assistane then they can pay a price for it while at the same time dividing\n&gt; thier own troops by having to pay such a thing, which we can later take\n&gt; advantage of.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; VICE GRIP pondered, &quot;The Maximals will be more apt to expect a direct double\n&gt; cross in the field when it is over.  So if we do cooperate with them and do\n&gt; not instantly engage them when whatever this crisis is is over, it would\n&gt; disrupt any counter schemes they might have.  As well as keeping the new\n&gt; elements of our forces out of sight for now allows us to take a more\n&gt; opportune moment to exploit it later, as well as letting us gague what the\n&gt; reinforcements this new PRIME has brought wtih him and what his own\n&gt; capabiliteis are.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod of the head from SKYSHADOW as he glanced at HYDRAS.\nObviously he was going to play the role of a loyal lackey, especially\nwhen their leader was so close at hand.\n\n&quot;I agree. I would imagine that our Lord Hydras has plans in mind that\nwould cover all of this.&quot; He said slyly, trying to keep from assuming\ntoo much command lest HYDRAS lash out at him.\n\nSKYSHADOW folded his hands together before him in a gesture of\nhumility. &quot;And I would think that the Maximals would never send out a\nPrime without soldiers to go with him. The question is why? They have\nnot sent out a Prime in years.&quot;\n\nYou see, the Predacons were not properly aware of the crash of the\nprison ship and the release of so many prisoners onto old Earth. Nor\nhad anyone yet figured out how much the cumulitive affect of all these\nconstant battles could be having on the timeline. SOmehting the\nMaximals had only recently realized themselves.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, walking along with CRYOTEK, Blackarachnia smiled, &quot;So, tell\n&gt; me.  Just what bings you out to this neck of the time-space continuum?  The\n&gt; beautiful peaks and valleys?  The wondrous schemes to be made?  A mech like\n&gt; you.&gt;&quot;  Attempting to rub her claws over his armored plating, &quot;Doesn&#39;t come\n&gt; out here for just anything..  I want to know.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a humorous smile, &quot;Now if I give you everything, there would\nbe nothing to keep you here by my side, now would there dear lady.&quot; He\nglanced down at BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;Plus I must admit, I am a little shy\nin front of an audience.&quot;\n\nWas CRYOTEK talking about HYDRAS and the others around them or had he\nguessed or maybe even detected her open link to TARANTULUS. His\nenagmatic smile revealed little to nothing about the dark and devious\nintelligence that hid behind his faceplate.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Fractil is in charge to study it...&quot; Hissed Hydras while their little heads\n&gt; watched at Tarantulus trying to found out what is he doing&quot;I had... Some\n&gt; internall issues that I had to take care&quot;Said hydras in atone that was a\n&gt; warning about not to ask more&quot;But I we found out that all our missing\n&gt; Predacons had a realation with Unicron... what your maximal intelligence can\n&gt; clear about that? FRACTIL! As soon as you find out something tell me!!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Uh sir?&quot; FRACTYL said in low tones. &quot;I cannot get it to work, I think\nit was broken in its last use.&quot; He frowned as he turned it over in his\nhands one last time, then he looked up at HYDRAS, &quot;But I think I can\nuse it as a tracker to allow us to home in on where its home location\nis.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
