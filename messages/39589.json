Their double-bladed swords\nslice the air. It is\nsparring, but one mistake still means death. Stallex\nis by far the more\ntalented fighter, but he can not match his father in\nstrength and speed, so\nMustex continues pushing Stallex back. Mustex gets a\ngood blow to Stallex&#39;s\nchest. Stallex buckles under the pain.\nMustex:Why did you stop?\nStallex:It hurts.\nMustex:Don&#39;t stop. If you don&#39;t give into the pain it\nwill hurt 10 times\nmore. If you give into the pain you&#39;re enemy will see\nthat it hurts 100 times\nmore. I&#39;ve seen alot of bots fall from that mistake.\nAlot of bots wouldn&#39;t\nhave bothered teaching you that. Now back to beast\nmode.\nStallex:Beast Mode!\nMustex:Beast Mode!\nStallex:Internal repairs.\n They begin to run off. The two horses run quickly\nover the desert.\nStallex:What&#39;s our next mission.\nMustex:Yours is in &quot;Training City&quot;. There&#39;s a monkey\nthere named Rhesus. He&#39;s\nan old friend and he can teach you about stealth.\nStallex:What about you?\nMustex:I have a plan to take out the &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, but\nit&#39;s a 1 bot job.\nStallex:You know how dangerous that is.\nMustex:Yes but  it&#39;s even harder for 2 bots to\ninfiltrate. I have a shot\nalone though.\nStallex:O.k., but come back alive. I want to be the\none to beat you.\n They run off on their way to Egypt.\n\n2.Mustex and Stallex\nLocation:Training City,Egypt\nStatus:Preparation\n\n Mustex and Stallex walk into a room. Rhesus is\nsitting at a desk with his\nback to them. He is leaning over some circuits\nexamining them. Mustex has his\nhands behind his back and is wearing his poker face.\nHe knows the following\nconversation will be a simple matter of wearing down\nRhesus who is completely\noblivious to them.\nMustex:Rhesus!\n Rhesus jumps. Mustex walks around in frount of him.\nMustex:Still wasting precious Maximal computer space\non your own private\ncasino my,my,my. Stallex go start training with\ndrones,Rhesus will be with\nyou soon.\n Stallex walks out.\nRhesus:Ahh,my good friend. So the &quot;Carnitrons&quot; rise\nagain. I can hear the cry\n&quot;Carnitrons Carnivate&quot;. We were the only sensible\ngroup. We had a simple\nmotto of &quot;stay alive&quot;.\nMustex:Shutup! If we were so great then why did I lead\nus to get ambushed by\nthe &quot;Alliance&quot; for our first battle. As I recall 5 of\nthe 7 of us were\ndamaged beyond repair. Now I see that anything except\na 2-way war leads to\nextra senseless casulties. That&#39;s why I intend to make\neveryone pick Maximal\nor Predicon. All you can think about is revenge on the\n&quot;Alliance&quot;,and the\nrebirth of a lost cause. All I want is these parts and\na transport.\n Mustex hands Rhesus a paper. Rhesus looks upset as he\nreads it.\nRhesus:Where am I going to get a D.N.A. simulator.\nMustex:You&#39;re a bigger fool than I thought if you\nthink I don&#39;t know where\nFox Fingers got his.\nRhesus:Even so it will take me several weeks, but pay\ncould speed me up.\nMustex:Did I mention I&#39;m planning to take out the\n&quot;Iron Fist&quot; the Alliance\nwill be permantly crippled.\nRhesus:Well in that case just let me step into the\nnext toom to get what you\nneed. So,we can finally get revenge for Croctas,\nKangato, Tigecs, Socrow, and\nmy lovely Monkessa. I&#39;ve just finished about half a\ndozen special\nhover-cycles. They should do fine for you.\nMustex:Oh, and by the way I told my son you&#39;d train\nhim.\nRhesus:Small price to pay. Does he know about the\n&quot;Carnitrons&quot; yet.\nMustex:Not a clue.\nRhesus:Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t snich &#39;till you come to\nyour senses.\n Rhesus hands Mustex a large box of parts and walks\naway to train Stallex.\n\n3.Mustex\nLocation:Training City,Egypt\nStatus:Traveling\nDestination:Alliance Island,Spain\nETA:5 hours\n\nRhesus:Come back alive. You know I can&#39;t restart the\n&quot;Carnitrons&quot; without\nyou.\nMustex:You&#39;re not going to resart them with or without\nme.\nRhesus:I&#39;ll take good care of the kid... Uh,that is\nuntil you get back.\nMustex:bye\n Mustex jumps onto his waiting hover-cycle and races\noff.\n\n4.Mustex\nLocation:Alliance Island, Spain\nStatus:Infiltration\n\n Mustex looks at the newly completed drone in front of\nhim. He activates\nthe D.N.A. simulator. The drone takes on his\nappearance. He is positioned 500\nyards from the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; so the Alliance won&#39;t risk\nan attack unless he\ngets closer. He activates another pocket sized drone.\nIt begins its mission\nto plant a device he had built 100 yards from the\nbase, 40 feet under. When\nhis monitor says the drone is done he calls out the\ncode that will activate\nthe drones programming.\nMustex:Beast Mode!\n Mustex turns on his jammer and attaches it to his\nbelt. The drone begins\ntransmitting a Maximal  frequency,goes to Beast\nMode,and bounds for the base.\nMustex keeps low to the ground so he won&#39;t be spotted.\nThe auto-guns begin\nfiring, but no transformers come out. The horse jumps\naway from every shot.\nHe stops at 100 yards away.\nDrone:Mustex Maximize!\n The drone transforms and begins firing arrows at the\nshield of the base. He\ndodges all the beams,but only has enough power at this\nkind of level for 15\nminutes. Fortunately,he doesn&#39;t need that long. The\nmain turrets fireand take\nhim out. The shields flicker from power loss,but stay\nintact. Mustex then\nsmiles when his monitor shows the pocket sized drone\nthe pocket sized drone\nhas reached the surface. He activates the device and\nit transmites a Maximal\nfrequency. The drone then starts firing. It has enough\npower for 6 shots. The\n&quot;Alliance&quot; is beginning to sweat. The main turret\nfires again and the shield\ngoes down. Mustex deactivates th device and charges.\nMustex:Beast Mode!\n As he charges he scans the base. The shields will be\ndown for the next hour.\nIt will be down for the next hour. It will take him 10\nminutes to navigate\nthe corridors to his destination and 10 minutes to get\nback. He will go in\nthe  one way they won&#39;t expect,The Front Door, 10\nyards away he transforms.\nMustex:Mustex Maximize!\n Mustex draws a cyber arrow and blows the door open.\nUsing his frequency\njammer as cover he sneaks to his destination. He walks\ninto the Energon\nstorage room. The Energon will magnify the explosion\nof the small explosive\nhe made. He walks over to a computer console and hooks\nit up to the\n&quot;Alliance&quot; network. If a remote connection is placed\non it it will blow from\n2 connections to the network. It can detect the\nEnergon and will blow if much\nis removed. It can detect the energon in the room and\nwill blow if to much is\nremoved. It takes 20 minutes to diffuse and it would\nbe set for 15. There is\nno deactivation code. The full blast could probably\nnot be contained. Even if\nthe explosive is covered an electronic signal will\nignite the energon. He set\nit and ran out.\n\n            CHECK! Your move Zardus(feel free to\n             head for your time machine this\n              qualifies as a catastophe).\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
