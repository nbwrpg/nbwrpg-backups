Lets see how things \nturn o=\r\nut.\n\nMegatron X:\n\nAfter much study and paitent waiting, three aircraft; two=\r\n about the \nsize of an average maximal and the third signifigantly smaller-=\r\n \ninfiltrated the city from three different directions.  The largest \nrumbl=\r\ned down a thouroghfair, almost a block in shape.  At it&#39;s bow \nwas a large =\r\nbarreled fusion cannon wile the top portion contained two \nsecondary cannon=\r\ns on either side of a twin missile pod.  The second \naircraft; noticably fa=\r\nster, was set apart by its air foils and two \nprecision beam rifles.  The l=\r\nast, was tiny by comparison, flying high \nover the building until it dove d=\r\nown to join the other two.\n\nOnce the three craft converged, they combinded =\r\ninto an even larger \nship, the small flyer compacting and fitting inside th=\r\ne faster flyer, \nwhich connected to the bow section of the larger gunship. =\r\n The ship \nhovered over an intersection for several minutes as a crowd gath=\r\ner \naround it.  And then it suddenly fell.\n\nBut before it crashed to the ro=\r\nadway, it transformed.  The cannons \nfell away and reconfigured as the body=\r\n reformed.  The large engines \nformed strong legs.  The wings and forward f=\r\nuselage formed the upper \nbody and arms, with the wings forming two broad s=\r\nhields at the \nshoulders.  The fusion cannon attached to the bottom of the =\r\nright \nforearm, while the twin barreled rifle found home in the left hand. =\r\n \nWith missiles to protect his back, Megatron X Stood before the crowd \nand=\r\n sneered.  \n\n&quot;People of the world, Megatron has returned!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
