She wanted to get to cover before the storm hit, but \nif they were close enough by the time it did then they would continue on.\nCarnage growled at Teltoli once she mentioned a promotion.**\n\n&quot; Since when did a promotion become more important then a friend?!&quot;\n\n** Carnage stopped in her tracks and glared down at the fuzor.**\n\n&quot; Or were you my friend in the first place? Because, and I doubt it&#39;s ever \nchanged, that a friend was supposed to be to the end. SUPPOSED to be someone \nwho you can TRUST, COUNT ON, DEPEND!\nWell, that&#39;s obviously NOT you!&quot;\n\n** Carnage&#39;s expression was rather enthusiastic, but she was simply being \nsarcastic...to a cruel end.\nBut her eyes were always glaring, until she finally turned her head away \nfrom Teltoli and continued on her way.**\n\n&quot; But Hay!&quot;\n\n** She shrugged.**\n\n&quot; Since when has anything been any different. It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve ever \nmattered to anyone. I&#39;m easily run over. Exploited. Cheated and so on.\nIt&#39;s not like this is anything new to me.&quot;\n\n** If Teltoli couldn&#39;t tell that she was pissed off now then she didn&#39;t want \nto think of what she had to do to get it across, but she would simmer down \nsooner or later. Probably later, but still....\nCarnage glanced towards Teltoli for a sec as she continued to move off, \nwondering if the fuzor would give up and leave. Not that she wanted her too.\nThere was the room for a second chance for the cat, but she would have to \ntough out Carnage&#39;s aggression. And if she couldn&#39;t take the pain for the \nsheere way to keep a friend, then she wasn&#39;t a friend after all.\nSo this was the center of the moment, the place where true colors came out.\nAnd Carnage waited eagerly for the outcome.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
