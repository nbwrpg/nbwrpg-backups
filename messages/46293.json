You all know my \nfirst suggestion, here&#39;s my second:\n\nLegacy dumps the poison, but it has a wierd affect on the nitrogen in \nour atmosphere.  Most of it becomes Latent, but some of it interacts \nwith our bots sending them into stasis until a decade in the future \n(our future 2012 A.D.) so the story of the continent of Atlantis being \ndestroyed in a day and a night was really the story of a couple of \nbots being put into stasis lock for a few million years and Plato just \nleft off a couple of zeros because he didn&#39;t believe the Earth could \nbe that old when we think a zero got added in making it 10,000 instead \nof 1000 years.  But then they wake up in the near future and start \nslaggin&#39; again.\n\n\n"}}
