Same as \n&gt; she would do i=\r\nf danger was close, just stick to mommy&#39;s side.\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t see but in a=\r\n few days here eyes would open but without \nfood she \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t last that =\r\nlong. Even the jerky movements of her body were \ngetting \n&gt; weaker and her =\r\nwhining was getting more common too.\n&gt; All her little heart desired was war=\r\nm milk in her tummy and the \nwarmth of \n&gt; mommy&#39;s side. But all she got was=\r\n the warmth of a strangers arms \nand hunger \n&gt; pains.\n&gt; The baby yipped a b=\r\nit when Starice got up to get the milk bottles, \nsurprised \n&gt; by the sudden=\r\n movement and cuddling into her arms to try and stay \nwarm and \n&gt; safe.\n&gt; S=\r\nhe wasn&#39;t use to all this moving and it was confusing her more but \nit woul=\r\nd \n&gt; be worth it since Starice was going to make her tummy pains go \naway, =\r\nshe was \n&gt; just too young to know that right now.\n&gt; Her thinking patterns w=\r\nere primitive but that was just because she \nwas so \n&gt; young, when she grew=\r\n up more her thoughts would be more complex and \n&gt; detailed. But all she kn=\r\new now was that she was hungry.\n&gt; By now Starice had already shown her to E=\r\npyon and for some reason \nshe could \n&gt; smell milk but it wasn&#39;t too much li=\r\nke mommy&#39;s. And she was out of \nStarice&#39;s \n&gt; arms now too so there was the =\r\nsmell of milk but now warm side where \nit \n&gt; should come from.\n&gt; Having no =\r\nenergy to move the baby just stayed there and whined, \nfeeling cold \n&gt; even=\r\n though milk smelled close. Her whining got louder when her \ntummy \n&gt; rumbl=\r\ned because, by now, her body was warning her that if she \ndidn&#39;t eat \n&gt; foo=\r\nd soon it would give out on her.\n&gt; But She was suddenly picked up and it co=\r\nnfused and scared her, \nmaking her \n&gt; whine more before she suddenly smelle=\r\nd something very close to her \nthat \n&gt; smelled like=85like=85, her mouth fo=\r\nund the end of the bottle before \nher nose \n&gt; did and the fist thing she di=\r\nd was open her tiny mouth and start to \nsuckle.\n&gt; A little of the milk leak=\r\ned out of her mouth and ran down her fuzzy \ncheek, \n&gt; putting her itty paws=\r\n at the sides of the bottle, even though it \ndidn&#39;t feel \n&gt; like mommy&#39;s si=\r\nde and didn&#39;t taste like her milk. But she was SO \nhungry.\n&gt; The baby ate w=\r\nith greed, suckling and feeling the milk coat her \nstomach, \n&gt; making littl=\r\ne sounds that a suckling baby would when they eat.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n__________________=\r\n____________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private=\r\n, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
