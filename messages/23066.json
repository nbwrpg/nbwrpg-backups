Wait! Black Arachnia and \nGremlin are out too, heading this way!&quot;\n\nShe looks at Dollen and pulls out her gun. &quot;Nope, but we might have \nbattle here soon, be ready.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKillfest growls at DarkMouse&#39;s report. &quot;You heard her. I&#39;ll send my \nteam to take out Megatron. Get some troops to the engine room.&quot;\n\nHe nods at the three bots in the room that were under his command. \nThey exit and head for Megatron&#39;s position.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The only confirmed position is the Engine room.&quot;\n&gt; He re-opened his comm.\n&gt; &quot;Dark Mouse, you got that info yet?&quot;\n&gt; He then had a disturbing thought.\n&gt; &quot;Guys, I think we&#39;ve done exactly what they want.
