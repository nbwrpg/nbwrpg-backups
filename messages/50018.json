She hadn&#39;t known \n&gt; Rodimus for long, but she had respected his words and his actions. \n&gt; Visibly shaken Scryed looks at Rodimus her eyes sorrowful, &quot;H... \n&gt; How... How, what happened?! The Preds? If it was the Preds...&quot; She \n&gt; was now visily shaking with anger as she checks her weapons, which \n&gt; were nearly at full charge. She calms herself reconsidering her \n&gt; desire to attack the Preds full on; not a smart idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hearing another voice from behind Rodimus, she is momentarily \n&gt; distracted. Spoting Wheeljack-X, she calls over Rodimus to \n&gt; him, &quot;Whoa... I totally missed you, sorry bout that. I&#39;m Scryed, \n&gt; pleased to meet you.&quot; She passes Rodimus, and offers a paw.\n\n\n"}}
