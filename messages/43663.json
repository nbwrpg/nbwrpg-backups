You made an agreement, it is \ntime \n&gt; for you to return. You can not resist me... you are my puppet, my \n&gt; puppet for me to do with you as I wish.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As the voice said this Blacknightmare found herself drawing her \nblast \n&gt; and aiming at Orchestra, at the saem time her optics began to glow \na \n&gt; bright blue as he body was surrounded in a red glow. The mysterious \n&gt; voice speaking to orchestra now through Blacknightmares mouth, its \n&gt; voice replacing her.\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;She is not going anywhere with you. She is my puppet, follow \n&gt; and you shall find oblivion.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With those words the voice dissapeared yet the red glow remained \n&gt; aroudn her body as she was forced to fire at Orchestra at close \nrange \n&gt; before being amde to run off. Meanwhile back in the undersea base, \na \n&gt; potion of the ocean floor opens a bright glow emanating from the \n&gt; chamber. Inside the control room the mysterious bot laughs evily as \n&gt; it looks to Blight.\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;How long until launch?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Blight: &quot;Five seconds...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The mysterious bot turns and looks to a clock with the cybertronian \n&gt; symbols for four slowly coming, then 3, then 2, then 1. As one is \n&gt; reached a large projectile is launched from the ocean floor, in a \nfew \n&gt; moments the massive glowing object breaks the surface of the ocean, \n&gt; still flying up. The glowing shell around it soon breaks away \n&gt; revealing a black opject looking like a type of obelisk which soon \n&gt; pierces through the atmosphere, that soon breaking away leaving a \n&gt; large grey and red object made of energy now in orbit right over \nthe \n&gt; Mid atlantic base somehow being able to stay over it. Three blue \ndish \n&gt; like objects then appear on its face. Its purpose yet unknown to \nall \n&gt; but the infecticons and of course some people in the RPG.\n\n\n"}}
