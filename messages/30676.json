She\n&gt; couldn&#39;t break her concentration now, despite what Lunarpine said.\n&gt; She was about to change the image again when she heard him say\n&gt; Veratis.  That broke her train of thought.  Her image in Megaton&#39;s\n&gt; mind stop and she stared up at him. &quot;What did you say? What&#39;s Veratis\n&gt; have to do with this?&quot;  She realized she fell for a trick and started\n&gt; up the image again.  Only, this time, she put up the image of energon\n&gt; bars and caged Megaton inside.  If he tried to reach the bars, he&#39;d\n&gt; think he was being shocked. Or at least, she tried to make him think\n&gt; this.  The strain was showing and her body was trembling.  Her mind\n&gt; started going in differant directions.  Without knowing it, she had\n&gt; sent the same image to Lunarpine as well as MegaTon. Her power supply\n&gt; was getting low, but she couldn&#39;t let Megaton destroy her friends, or\n&gt; the bot she cared for.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Megaton didn&#39;t understand what could be happening to him, he was\n&gt; perfect,\n&gt; &gt; the ideal Pred. He tried to think logically, how was it that he\n&gt; hadn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; transformed? (He did but Ice&#39;s telepathy keeps him from knowing\n&gt; it.) He\n&gt; &gt; turned around to where Ice lay, he knew that either her or\n&gt; Lunarpine were\n&gt; &gt; causing this. He decided to try some more logic, &quot;You haven&#39;t told\n&gt; them what\n&gt; &gt; Veratis intends for the Maximals when his army of mutants are\n&gt; complete have\n&gt; &gt; you?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine rushed to Ice&#39;s side, he could see her strain. &quot;I don&#39;t\n&gt; know what\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re doing to him but I want you to stop before you hurt\n&gt; yourself.&quot; His\n&gt; &gt; concern for her was interupted by Megatons comment about\n&gt; Veratis. &quot;Shut up\n&gt; &gt; monster or I&#39;ll show you whats in store for ANY traitor who comes\n&gt; around\n&gt; &gt; me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
