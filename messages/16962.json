Am I alive?&quot; he says, trying to sit up but wincing with pain as his\n&gt;torso acomplishes nothing but a slight jerk.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
