The robot \nhe \n&gt; had looked at right after was Bleeder, Shadow Star&#39;s superior \nofficer. \n&gt; They had both talked, and Tyrael had explained his reason&#39;s for his \n&gt; choice. Bleeder had been in agreement. Now, Tyrael had to announce \nit \n&gt; to the principal interested...\n&gt;   He went to the junior officer&#39;s quarters. He hoped the young \nofficer \n&gt; was there. After searching for a few minutes, he found the bot&#39;s \ndoor, \n&gt; and pressed the button announcing him.\n&gt;   Tyrael: I am Colonel Tyrael. I have come to meet with you, Shadow \n&gt; Star.\n\n\n"}}
