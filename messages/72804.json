Ahh, yes, a=\r\nlways of the foibles of the MAXIMALS to think that only they were right on =\r\nany occasion, and especially that infuriating rodent.  Still fully conceale=\r\nd from view, still in total stealth mode now and her cloak powered up, she =\r\nkept on working to try and see if she could obost the homing signals any be=\r\ntter, to probably no luck.\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME nodded again, &quot;Perhaps=\r\n you are right, who can say. In the\n&gt; end it is always a test of leader shi=\r\np for anyone. To maintain order\n&gt; and unity among ones troops.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n=\r\n&gt; TARANTULUS&#39;s connection was rumored by some and guessed at by others,\n&gt; b=\r\nut the full extent of it was unknown at present. Was he truely a\n&gt; spawn of=\r\n the world destroyer or was it a rumor that TARANTULUS\n&gt; secretely fostered=\r\n to inhance his own agendas?\n&gt; \n&gt; Questions, rummors, innuendoes - that was=\r\n the province of TARANTULUS\n&gt; and it was a weapon that he wielded skillfull=\r\ny and with deadly affect.\n&gt; Could it be that HYDRAS has at last felt its st=\r\ning or is some other\n&gt; work afoot?\n&gt; \n&gt; Only time would tell.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIM=\r\nE looked around, &quot;Where is Dinobot and Waspinator?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWASPINATOR was =\r\nflying up and over into the air, going in a long circle for the moment as h=\r\ne was attempting to try and find a clear path through the underbrush.  OF a=\r\nll the ironies, WASPINATOR was a surprisingly dextrous flier, and with noth=\r\ning shooting at him immediately, he was seemingly able to clear his way thr=\r\nough it surprisingly deftly.  Avoiding the branches, hovering in the air an=\r\nd going thorugh them.\n\nMeanwhile, BLACKARACHNIA mused more over on TARANTAL=\r\nUS, testing again the mental link with her &#39;Lord&#39; to see if there was any r=\r\nesponse over it, or she was truly on her own for now.  If not..  Then it wo=\r\nuld be her happy time.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; VICE GRIP could quickly see a spike in =\r\nthe jamming of the signal as if\n&gt; they were heading towards the source of i=\r\nt. The further he went down\n&gt; into the tunnels, the more pronounced the aff=\r\nect.\n&gt; \n&gt; The question was, would he continue on or would he return to the\n=\r\n&gt; surface and inform the others?\n&gt; \n&gt; He began to hear a low level hum.\n\n\n&lt;=\r\nNEW&gt;\n\nFortunately, VICE GRIP could do both.  Gesturing over to DRILL BIT, &quot;=\r\nCome with me, we&#39;re going down.&quot;  Giving instructions to DINOBOT, &quot;Go up to=\r\n the surface and inform CRYOTEK of what we&#39;ve found and what we&#39;re doing.  =\r\nWe&#39;re going to keep on digging and trying to track the souce.&quot;\n\nWith that, =\r\nthe two would head towards it while DINOBOT went up towards the surface to =\r\ncovertly report to CRYOTEK.\n\n\n"}}
