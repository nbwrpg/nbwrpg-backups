If not, pelase disregard this post then and will rewrite!\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; With =\r\nthat final tail slap the wall of rock and debris shattered,\n&gt; sending stone=\r\ns flying in many directions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind that though was a massive wall of =\r\nwater that burst out like it\n&gt; was comming through some sort of massive hos=\r\ne and quickly fired out of\n&gt; the shaft it had been trapped in and it began =\r\nflowing in the direction\n&gt; of the flaming pillar, which was on the direct o=\r\nther side of the large\n&gt; cavern!\n&gt; \n&gt; At nearly one mile away it would take=\r\n the water approximately a minute\n&gt; or so to reach the other side where the=\r\n column of fire like energy was\n&gt; flowing over OPTIMUS PRIME and streaming =\r\nfrom the pit that was beneath\n&gt; him into a hole in the top of the cave.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; DARK RODIMUS looked down at NIGHTLIGHT and carefully set her down and\n&gt; l=\r\nooked up at SABERBACK and then pointed at the water that was coming\n&gt; down =\r\non them.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the distance the SHARKTICONS who were indeed much closer w=\r\nere\n&gt; already forced to veer out of the way and circle around.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Fuzors=\r\n, attack!&quot; TORCA said as AIR HAMMER and NOCTORRO rose into the\n&gt; air and be=\r\ngan firing on the now disoriented SHARKTICONS, sending them\n&gt; fleeing to th=\r\ne side.\n&gt; \n&gt; TORCA and BANTOR fired as well and it took ony a few moments t=\r\no send\n&gt; the SHARKTICONS crashing to the ground to be overwhelmed by the\n&gt; =\r\ntorrent of water that was rushing at them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile SABERBACK, who ha=\r\nd been already watching merely frowned as\n&gt; he pulled out a device and bega=\r\nn to manipulate it. The air near\n&gt; himself, DARK RODIMUS, MAGMATRON and OPT=\r\nIMUS PRIME suddenly distorted\n&gt; slight as a force field snapped into place.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight did a small groam, almost an unoticeable o=\r\nne, But she continued\n&gt; &gt; unconseus and her wound still was bleeding\n&gt; \n&gt; N=\r\nodding DARK RODIMUS looked back down at NIGHTLIGHT wondering and\n&gt; hoping t=\r\nhat her self repair circuits would kick in.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time MAGMATRON=\r\n continued to smile as power flowed along\n&gt; the cables that had been set up=\r\n between himself and OPTIMUS PRIME.\n&gt; Meanwhile OPTIMUS&#39;s whole body began =\r\nto sag, as if his own power\n&gt; reserves were being depleted.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even his s=\r\ncreams had become just grunts of pain.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nVICE GRIP had fallen in o=\r\nver behind CRYOTEK, ready over to assist in a flanking position as they cam=\r\ne face to face over with MAGMATRON and what seemed to be..  OPTIMUS PRIME.\n=\r\n\nDINOBOT was ahead and over to flank, and while still etnirely confused - O=\r\nPTIMUS was still aboard the ARK, and it was supposed to be impossible to cl=\r\none sparks forged from the MATRIX, he held back over and waited to attack. =\r\n Let the MAXIMALS weaken themselves first after all, and then charge in!\n\nS=\r\no now, the duo of PREDACONS watied like stooges over for the orders to atta=\r\nck, ready to rush forwards and gut anything in their path!\n\n\n\n"}}
