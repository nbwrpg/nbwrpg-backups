After all, a \npredacon sabertooth tiger kitten needs to stretch her legs once in a while.  \nShe went outside and started running into the dense underbush.  She was \ngrowling a kitten growl and having fun.  She saw a small butterfly and \ndecided to chase it.  She swatted at it and  growled, trying to be as fierce \nas she could.  She ran about 4 miles before she stopped and looked around. \nShe sat down and tried to get her barings. She hadn&#39;t payed attention to how \nshe got there in the first place, so she had no idea how she got there.  She \ncalled out a kitten roar and hoped someone might help her back to her \nfriends.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
