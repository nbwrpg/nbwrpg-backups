He didnt like the idea of being controlled, by anyone. He \nstood up and took a good look at himself. He looked the same in warrior mode \nas he did in his past life. The only wepon he could account for was a \ngrapling gun. It was large, bulky, but very effective. \n    He transformed into his demonic centiped beast mode. It looked the same \nas well. He hoovered in the air, his mouth full of jagged teeth and the \ngrappling gun opened and closed, and the spikes that covered his body flexed \nand pulsed.\n    &quot;I dont suppose this is to bad after all, Autofire. Whoever this Vok is, \nit knows its weponry.&quot; He said, cruising in the hot air.\n    Useing his eight bug eyes, Adrax scanned the area for miles ahead. He got \nthe direction of the Predacon base, and with Autofire, began the journey.\n\n"}}
