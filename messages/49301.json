So \nMegatron would be hiding and poking his weapons over to fire at the \nmoment, having some protection against weaponfire. \n\nEssentially, SS couldn&#39;t have gotten behind him, grabbed his wrist \n(which would be a mode anyway), and fired a laser at the back of his \nneck etc. I guess I need to work on my posting some more then to \nmake stuff like that clearer.\n\nThis is, of course, provided that Tyrael is where I had thought he \nwas. If not, we have a minor problem. =p\n\n\n"}}
