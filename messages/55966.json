She located the \nengineering section, the prisoner holding cells, the main ventilation \nsupply systems, lab and hanger bays.  She was just wondering around, \nlooking rather lost and not sure of where to go.  She eventually \nfound the Med bays and went to the console.  She looked around first \nto make sure that no one was looking. Then, she opened up the console \npad and started to look for info on the bot Nightlight.\n\nShe soon found what she was looking for. THe original bot known as \nnightlight had been here. Was reprogrammed and into another bot. She \nwas about to find the name when she heard a noise. She closed out the \ncomputer terminal and made a rather loud sigh. &quot;Drat. I try to find \nthe map to find my way around and this stupid computer won&#39;t help me. \nAll it does is bring up medical stuff to which I know nothing about. \nBy the PIT won&#39;t this bad day just end already.&quot;  She whined a little \nand turned to leave. Her head low and her shoulders drooping a bit, \njust incase someone was watching.\n\n\n"}}
