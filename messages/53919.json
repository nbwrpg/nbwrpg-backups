You&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; cunning, you&#39;re brave, You&#39;re loyal... If I would have ten like you I \n&gt;would\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; had conquestered Cybertron... and Now I know that that it&#39;s possible...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;There is always that possibility.&quot; The thought about the various warriors\n&gt;she knew. She was created to serve, to be loyal. But there was always\n&gt;something else.. something.. elusive. Perhaps something in her future.\n&gt;\n&gt;&#39;If I remember correctly, Megatron attempted that. using a device called \n&gt;the\n&gt;Robo Smasher. An interesting machine that warped the meta processors &\n&gt;circuitry of any cybertronian to his will. Such a device could still come \n&gt;in\n&gt;handy. But.... alas.. it was destroyed.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Perhaps new warriors? With certain programming? You have the power Hydras.\n&gt;Whatever you ask, it can be yours.&quot; Her icy blue optics stared back at him.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCharla con tus amigos en lï¿½nea mediante MSN Messenger:  \nhttp://messenger.microsoft.com/es\n\n\n"}}
