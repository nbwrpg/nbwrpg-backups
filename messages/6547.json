The hole was covered by Scavanger and Breakdown (not to mention a blast \ndoor or two), and the brig isn&#39;t made of mirror coated graphite.\n\n::Punch/Scattershot/The Oblitercons::\n\nPunch grunts as Tigerhawk&#39;s hologram laughs at him. &quot;He might have escaped, \nbut we have the two females.&quot;\n\nHe looks at Dark One and Pyro, seeing a shadowy figure with Dark One&#39;s gun \npressed to her head (Iron Raptor under effect of the holodram). He looks over \nat Tavatron, grinning as an idea occurrs to him.\n\n&quot;These two will be sorry that fool attemped to rescue them,&quot; he says, evil in \nhis voice. Punch points to Tavatron, &quot;Drag that one to the torture chamber. \nAnd take the other one too. She&#39;ll watch.&quot;\n\nDark One nods, smiling as he and Pyro begin to drag Iron Raptor and Tavatron \nto the torture chambers. Punch turns to accompany them.\n\n&quot;Scattershot, Breakdown, Scavanger, Hiss, repair that hole.&quot;\n\nThe bots get down to their assigned task.\n\n"}}
