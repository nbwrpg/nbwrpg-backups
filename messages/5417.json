He then went to his computer \nroom. He sat down and started looking for signs of Cheetor. Once he found him \nhe sealed the hallway so he couldn&#39;t escape. He then touched his face.\n    &quot;Bad Kitty,&quot; He said over the comm. &quot;Now listen, I am not a bad guy, I \nwould like you to help me. I actullay like the Maximals, so I would do \nnothing to destroy them. I only wish to talk to you, so please sit down and I \nwill be there in a second.&quot;\n \n ______________________________________________________________________\n ::CyberShark::\n \n    Carring Pantron on his back he zoomed to the Destron base. When he got \nthere he looked down at Pantron&#39;s face, it was almost completly destroyed. He \nneeded a lot of time in a CR chamber. But the doors were sealed to the Base.\n    &quot;What the--&quot; CyberShark asked himself. &quot;There must be an emergency \ninside. Magmatron it&#39;s me, CyberShark. I have Pantron here and he needs time \nin the CR chamber, he&#39;s almost blown to scrap.&quot;\n    The doors opened and CyberShark transformed and ran in. He ran past \neverythin untill he reached the CR room. Putting Pantron in there he slammed \nthe door shut and started it up. It quickly assesed the damage, his Spark was \nfading, he was going to die.\n    CyberShark opened the door and opened his Spark Container, what he was \nabout to do was nearly impissible to do, he needed to remove his spark. \nFinally he found something to put it in, it was crude and wouldn&#39;t last \nforever, but it would work. Putting the Spark in the container, he started \nrepairs on Pantron&#39;s body.\n\n"}}
