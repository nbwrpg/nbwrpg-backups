First rule of thumb, act only in defense, =\r\nand not in offense.  One of Yoketron&#39;s golden rules.  I haven&#39;t forgotten t=\r\nhem even today.&quot;\n\nHe had learned a lot from Yoketron, and he thinks back on=\r\n everything he was taught and how he developed into who he was today.  His =\r\ntemper still needed work, and he was aware of his weakness from day one. \n\n=\r\n&quot; I&#39;ll be honest with you, Big Convoy, I sought Yoketron&#39;s training because=\r\n I have a weakness I needed to work on.  I have an extremely short fuse of =\r\na temper, and I&#39;m still working on it.  As a rookie, I knew right away I ne=\r\neded to do something about it, so I sought Yoketron&#39;s training, which did h=\r\nelp somewhat but not completely.  But what he taught me, I consider it pric=\r\neless. I hope to return to Yoketron to complete my training, because I do k=\r\nnow I have not yet completed it.&quot;\n\nHe closes his eyes for a moment, and slo=\r\nwly draws his sword into defense position.  His posture changes as he prepa=\r\nres to take a combative pose.  His feet and legs, appear to be ready to spr=\r\ning into action at a moment&#39;s notice.  \n\n&quot; I think we&#39;ll be joined shortly =\r\nby unwanted company.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;super=\r\ncyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson moves quickly with Big Conv=\r\noy and keeps his sword at the ready.  As\n&gt; &gt; Yoketron had taught him, he ta=\r\nkes his challenge willingly but with an air of\n&gt; &gt; calm.  He knew a clear m=\r\nind had to be kept if he was going to perform at an\n&gt; &gt; optimal level.  Aft=\r\ner all, Yoketron had worked hard with Tucson, shaping him\n&gt; &gt; up to be one =\r\nof his star pupils.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; If it&#39;s all right with you, Big Convoy, I wou=\r\nld like to handle the next\n&gt; &gt; group of guards.

Oh, nice shot by the way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;=\r\nNEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; BIG CONVOY grunted as he looked back at TUSCON, &quot;So yoou are one =\r\nof\n&gt; those who enjoy combat.&quot; There was nothing on his face that showed\n&gt; w=\r\nether he respected that or detested it. &quot;Sure, the next ones are\n&gt; yours.
