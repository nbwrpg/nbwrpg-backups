Instead, Tucson conce=\r\nntrates on getting everyone out of there in one piece.  Runing from the thr=\r\neat gave them a jump ahead of the enemy, but only for so long, could they c=\r\nontinue this way, without runing out of energy.  Something needed to be don=\r\ne.  Tucson had to prove himself a worthy leader, and if he was going to do =\r\nso, now was the time to prove it.  Perhaps the dragon would have known how =\r\nto protect his kingdom from destruction, but how did he protect it without =\r\ntechnology to aid him?  He could not breathe fire, so that was out of the q=\r\nuestion.  But fire had to be born of a higher element.  Lightning.  Lightni=\r\nng, when it strikes the ground, it can create fire.  And following lightnin=\r\ng, comes the rain that falls to the ground, snuffing the flames of destruct=\r\nion.  His voice, when he roars, he sounds like thunder, so would it stand t=\r\no reason that maybe there could be something else in his breath, that he ha=\r\nd not explored yet.  \n\n&quot; Voice, like thunder, loud enough to rattle the gro=\r\nund.. Thunder..  After thunder, comes rain.  But before all that, comes lig=\r\nhtning.  Cast to the sky from the ground up..  Lightning causes fire, but i=\r\nt can also take it away.&quot;\n\nHe looks to everyone, being sure no one is withi=\r\nn his radius.  He opens his mouth and concentrates.  Tiny bolts of lightnin=\r\ng begin to come up from his gullet and crackle out from his mouth.  He then=\r\n roars, as it sounds like thunder, rumbling across the ground.  \n\n&quot;I know w=\r\nhat I must do.&quot;\n\nWhile emerging out near the top of the mountain, Tucson sp=\r\nreads his wings, and beats them to lift himself upward into the smoke fille=\r\nd sky.  It takes him great effort but he slowly starts lifting off the side=\r\n of the mountain and into the air.  He now attempts to create enough static=\r\n electricity to induce stormcloud formation.  If he could get it to rain, b=\r\ny using that science and the power of the old dragon, he could at least sta=\r\nll the magma enough to get everyone out of there in decent shape, and stop =\r\nthe firey bird above.  Yet, he was exhausted.  Could he do this now, in his=\r\n physical state?  He had to try.  With great determination, dead set in his=\r\n eyes, the dragon now picks up his speed in the air, and flies after the bi=\r\nrd.\n\n&quot; Not this time, Magmatron, not this time!&quot;\n\nHe opens wide, and concen=\r\ntrates with all his might, to breathe a bolt of lightning, just strong enou=\r\ngh to attempt stormcloud formation and hopefully a little rainstorm along w=\r\nith it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As everyone screamed out of the chamber and down the various tun=\r\nnels\n&gt; and halls, the MAXIMALS and the PREDACONS find themselves and two\n&gt; =\r\ndifferent sides of a large mountain - one that they both seemed to be\n&gt; nea=\r\nr the top of, and one that still continued to shutter and belch\n&gt; forth smo=\r\nke and flames!\n&gt; \n&gt; Tunnels callapsed and rocks began to slide down the sid=\r\nes as the the\n&gt; mountain transformed itself into a volcano!\n&gt; \n&gt; Overhead t=\r\nhe skies began to darken as gasses were pushed into the air,\n&gt; followed by =\r\nsmoke and ash. The trees that were on the side of the\n&gt; mountain were alrea=\r\ndy begining to wilt and crumble as their roots,\n&gt; which were buried in the =\r\nmountain were being fed a concoction of\n&gt; poisonous fluids and superheated =\r\nmagma. Birds over head screeched as\n&gt; their very homes were falling away be=\r\nneath them.\n&gt; \n&gt; All around was an ocean of trees, this mountain volcano wa=\r\ns going off\n&gt; and was about the change the landscape for years to come!\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; However up into the skies, from out of the top of the volcano itself\n&gt; th=\r\nere came a screeching cry as a large bird seemingly made almost\n&gt; completly=\r\n of fire came rising up out of the coronoa of heat.\n&gt; \n&gt; The fiery bird fla=\r\npped its wings throwing flame and plasma as it\n&gt; climebed higher into the a=\r\nir and began to circle the mountain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Incredulously the IFF signature f=\r\nrom the bird was a lot like RODIMUS\n&gt; PRIME, and in his claws, held unscath=\r\ned was the dark sewmiconscious\n&gt; form of NIGHTLIGHT!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile TUSCON =\r\ngot a static filled call from LORD ELDER, &quot;Tusco . .\n&gt; zztt . . can .. . . =\r\n.  me?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Off in one corner, on the far side of the mountain WASPINATOR&#39;=\r\nS head\n&gt; came rolling down the side of the mountain, bouncing a few times a=\r\nnd\n&gt; then sailing through the air to continue rolling.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Pr=\r\neston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
