He was now pretty good and pissed. He walks \nup \n&gt; &gt; to Maxima. SharpClaw: You are foolish. I suggest you start making \n&gt; &gt; friends. From what I&#39;ve seen, your attitude serves no purpose but \nto \n&gt; &gt; piss bots off. That&#39;s dangerous. You dont need enemies within \nyour \n&gt; &gt; own faction. He looks at Blackstorm. SharpClaw: You, my dear, \nshow \n&gt; &gt; great promise. Let her program fighting ability into you, it&#39;ll \nhelp, \n&gt; &gt; but dont reply on it. Artificial programs are crap. We are \n&gt; &gt; transformers, we are more advanced then that. Instead of being \n&gt; &gt; programmed like simple computers, we should learn are skills \n&gt; &gt; ourselves.
