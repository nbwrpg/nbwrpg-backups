We have managed to round everyone up, but w=\r\ne&#39;re still trying to apprehend Darkhawk. Night Shift is attempting that now=\r\n. Legacy, while I have your attention, I need to confirm some intel with yo=\r\nu, regarding an ancient legend about the mythical Hydra. From what I&#39;ve rea=\r\nd, a hydra can not be killed by decapitation, which only promotes the growt=\r\nh of multiple heads at one time. Yet, in this legend, it gives the clue on =\r\nhow to slay the beast. Direct fire is the only way to slay a hydra. Can thi=\r\ns knowledge be adapted and utilized as a weapon against Hydras? Can Rodimus=\r\n and I use the powers within us to subdue him as this legend fortells? I wi=\r\nsh to confirm this before I proceede.&quot;\n\nLegacy paused for a moment in an ob=\r\nvious attempt to recall the\nrequested information. &quot;You are referencing a h=\r\numan mythological\nnarrative.&quot; Legacy stated. &quot;Human datum is not my forte, =\r\nhowever I\nhave been programed with much of their lore.&quot;\n\nLegacy floated cle=\r\narly into view near the Black Fortress as he\ncontinued his communication wi=\r\nth Tuscon, &quot;The one fable recounts a\ngreek hero identified as Hercules who =\r\nwas able to slay the\nmythological beast by cutting off each cranial appenda=\r\nge and then\nburning the stump before a new set would grow. An interesting a=\r\nddition\nto that is that one appendage - or head was said to be immortal or\n=\r\nunkillable, and had to be placed under a rock.&quot;\n\n&quot;As to whether this is app=\r\nlicable to Hydras?&quot; Legacy paused for a\nmoment and then continued, &quot;Insuffi=\r\ncient data, however all presumptive\nanalysis would seem to indicate that it=\r\n would be largely ineffective.\nNiether Galvatron nor Megatron, the two spar=\r\nks that make up Hydras,\nhave evinced any specific or unusual weakness towar=\r\nds matix energies.\nDespite outward appearance Hydras is still generally Cyb=\r\nertronian in\nmake up, his outward appearance is only an adaptation to his\ns=\r\nurroundings. Also he does not appear to have any of the specific\nvulnerabli=\r\nties or benefits of being a mythological hydra, save for the\nones created b=\r\ny his transform circuits and innate weaponry and\nabilities.&quot;\n\nLegacy hovere=\r\nd over the ground for a moment as he observed the\nsurrounding area, then wi=\r\nth the grinding of gears he shifted into his\nalternate mode, that of a cybe=\r\nrtronian tank, complete with a massive\nfoward cannon and a dual turrent can=\r\nnon as well. &quot;What gives me pause\n. . . &quot; Legacy said as he he landed on th=\r\ne ground, the force of his\nlanding cracking the ground beneath him slightly=\r\n. &quot;. . . is that the\ncivilization that created that myth on this planet wil=\r\nl not exist for\nthe greater part of 4 million years. How is it that you hav=\r\ne come\nacross such information?&quot;\n\nAs he sent his question to Tuscon Legacy =\r\nturned his attention to Rat\nTrap and Quickstride,\n\n&gt; Outside, Rat Trap and =\r\nQuickstride also get the transmission.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is Rat Trap, I read ya Leg=\r\nacy, Quickstride&#39;n I are on standby out here, just in case they need a litt=\r\nle distraction and some backup.&quot;\n\n&quot;Perhaps it is time for that diversion, a=\r\ns from all indication the\nentirety of Predacon forces are closing in on Tus=\r\ncon and Rodimus&#39;\nposition.&quot; Legacy said to Rat Trap and Quickstride as he o=\r\nriented his\ncannon on the Black Fortress&#39; main entrance.\n\n&quot;Prepare yourselv=\r\nes!&quot; Legacy said both over the radio to the others as\nwell as to those near=\r\nby. Meanwhile his fore cannon glowed for a moment\nlooking like a spear of c=\r\norruscating energy. Then it errupted and\nmassive energies went hurtling at =\r\nthe Black Fortress, creating a\nsearing path across the magma before strikin=\r\ng home against the front\ndoor!\n\nOOC: Airly, it&#39;s up to you if Legacy is abl=\r\ne to force open the fornt door.\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
