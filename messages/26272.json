He landed several feet from the shield, speaking some inaudible words \ninto a comm. unit in his wrist, the shields dropping momentarily allowing the \nthree Brotherhood members to walk through and enter the ship and then closing.\n\n---\n\nReaching the lab, Vehement pressed a few commands and a secret panel opened, \na blank, old looking scroll inside.  With his free hand, the other holding \nthe black sphere AKA &quot;The Key&quot;, he lifted the scroll, walking over to an \nempty table and setting it down.\n\nHe held the sphere several inches from the blank ancient scroll, soon a mix \nof ancient Cybertronian and two languages known only to Vehement appeared, \nthe Archbishop reading the rather long list that was there.\n\n&quot;Put base on red alert.  If something moves, open fire completely.  No one \ncomes in, no one goes.&quot; he ordered his minions, deactivating the transmission \nbefore they could respond.  So far it was the usual headline for all \nBrotherhood-related texts.  But he had to study it carefully.  It was the \nnext piece of the puzzle.\n\n"}}
