I knew what I was going.)\r\n\r\n**Carnage hadn&#39;t meant to scare her, simply to make her point in the most friendliest way she knew possible. Also, it wasn&#39;t as if she�d harmed her in any physical way, though she acted almost as if she had cuffed her along-side the cheek with the back of her hand. : Spoiled, that&#39;s what she&#39;s grown up like,: she thought to herself as she looked at Teltoli while she breathed heavily with her back against a large tree trunk.  Yet Carnage paid it no mind as she then heard the girl simply reply that she would gather another boulder, by then her back was turned on her and she was moving towards the first large rock and black moss laying on the surface of it.\r\nTeltoli was someone who would have to get use to that, since it was HER request for Carnage to train her in order for her to become a better soldier. Besides, if that act offended Teltoli, she would only have to wait until they started sparing one-on-one to feel it again.  That girl would have to grow up and realize that things could not all work out the ways she had planned, that life was hard and not something passed down from your parents that you could live on easily for the remainder of your life.\r\nTeltoli was in the Beast Wars now, not in her posh up-town home. Things worked differently here and if a bot couldn&#39;t adjust to that, well, they�d signed their death slip.\r\nCarnage settled down beside the boulder, grabbing the last large leave and wrapping the last of the sow remains in it. Tying it and then setting it aside with the rest.\r\nTeltoli, by now, had left in a huff to get the boulder she&#39;d asked for, her attitude the last thing on Carnage�s mind.  Instead she was more concerned with getting breakfast ready before the morning was out, and it was already mid-morning and she still hadn&#39;t began to make anything yet.  So, now with the guts all wrapped up as well as the bones, it was time to get a fire going and get to work on that boulder. After Teltoli returned she would show her the magic of shaping one the way she was about to...after making a fire hot enough that is.\r\nCarnage stretched and still found her muscles stiff from the night&#39;s sleep, heaving herself to her knees so that she could move over towards the pile of wood Teltoli had brought back without having to stand, picking up a few choice pieces and setting them as the foundation of their fire.\r\nIt took very little time to build the foundations that would become a fire, Carnage them removing her hand phaser from it&#39;s hold in her back and aiming it towards the peak of sticks at the top of the foundation, setting it to stun...so that the blast wouldn&#39;t knock burning bits of wood all over the clearing. Fired, and found that a nice fire was soon burning from the singed fibers of branches.  And now, while replacing her weapon, she looked over at the boulder and the moss, giving off a deep such before moving over to it and settling down right beside it. What a load of work this was...even though it was nothing out of every day life for Carnage. : And Teltoli bitches about getting a stupid rock....: was all she thought as she took a little of the moss from the top of the boulder and set it upon the ground for the second one which Teltoli was returning with, then moving to set her palm against the moss so that it pressed into the flat surface of the boulder, moving so that her weight would press down on it and then began to rub as hard as she could, spreading the moss along the top.\r\nCarnage continued this until the moss was no more and gray lather appeared where it had been, leaning back and moving the back of her hand across her brow before flexing the wrist and wincing when she felt the joint complain.**&quot; So much work for a single meal.&quot;  ** But there was no time to rest then and Carnage leaned back while removing a dagger from her ankle, sinking the blade into the lather and then into the rock.\r\nMany people wouldn&#39;t believe her if she ever said that a rock could be as flimsy as a piece of bark, but with the right things to make it so, it was. And now, as she cut in a wide circle, the boulder yielded to the blade until Carnage could scoop out the dome of stone with her bear hands. So now, instead of a boulder, there was a large, torso sized cauldron. Thick enough on all sides to keep the heat but also thin so that heat could get into it.\r\nFinally moving to sit upon her rear, Carnage looked at her work but also at the forest as she saw a familiar bot emerge into the clearing...with a torso-sized boulder chasing her all the way.\r\nSmiling to herself when she saw the gunk that coated Teltoli, she cleaned the dagger blade on the grass then replaced it as she had the phaser.  Giving a little grunt as she moved to her feet, Carnage approached Teltoli...however, not failing to notice the expression in which she wore.  It was a guilty look and she knew just what it was about, walking past the fuzor and snapping the vines which held the boulder.  This one was no heavier then the first and she picked it up in her arms with ease, feeling her back protest but never saying a word.  Carnage walked up beside Teltoli.** &quot; Don&#39;t worry about it, just concentrate on getting use to it.&quot;  ** And with that she walked past her and towards the fire, setting it down right beside the great stone bowl.  She stood and looked back towards Teltoli.** &quot; It&#39;s part of your training. And I only attacked you to test your reflexes. That and you have to learn then when you&#39;re told to do something you should do it. But, luckily,in this course you&#39;re allowed to be yourself.&quot;  ** Carnage then moved and sat behind the sculpted boulder, leaving Teltoli to sit neck to her and behind the raw rock.\r\nShe leaned on the edge.** &quot; So, is there anything you�d like to know about...anything?&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
