It \nexploded into a huge fireball that rose through the trees like a \nsmall nuclear blast.  He smiled, &quot;I wonder if that would attract \nattention.&quot; he said with a slight evil grin.  He transformed into \nhis dragon mode and started to fly East.  He had a wing span of  150 \nfeet.  His dragon body was 100 feet long with tail included.  He \nglided on the warm air currents as he scanned the area.   He landed \nnear a volcano creator.  It was dormant.  No lava flowed.  No smoke \narose.  He liked the area.  Jagged rocks surrounding the mountain \nsides that lead up to the top of the volcano.  Perfect for cover \nfrom a ground attack.  And plenty of refuge from an airial a OK, If \nassault.  He smiled. &quot;Now all I need is a base, hmmm, yessss.&quot;  He \ntransformed into bot mode and started a scan for all forms of life.  \n\nOOC:\nIf anyone wants a char to be found, let me know.  The location of \nthe volcano is basically in North America, where Mt.St. Helens is.  \nSo if anyone is near there, let me know.  \nLogo\n\n\n"}}
