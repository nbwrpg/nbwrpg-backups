Please concurr with her orders.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He was really surprised at how badly these Maximals followed orders.\n&gt; He knew that Liono&#39;s days were pretty bad, but the Maximals didn&#39;t\n&gt; even look like warriors. They reminded him of little kids, squabbling\n&gt; to get what they want no matter what their superiors ordered.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the Alliance got like that, they would fall out of the ranks\n&gt; instantly.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Necromancer looked on in satisfaction as Mobster seperated.
