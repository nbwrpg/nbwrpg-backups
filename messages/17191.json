I don&#39;t\n&gt; think they went through any transwarp portal or anything, but they wern&#39;t\ntoo\n&gt; outdated when they emerged 4 mil years later because the war was taking\ntoo\n&gt; much of Cybertron&#39;s and the Cybertronians&#39; resources and time for them to\n&gt; make any technological progress. I think at one point there were only\nabout\n&gt; 100 bots total on Cybertron, and 100 bots whose time is taken up killing\neach\n&gt; other, wouldn&#39;t have too much time to invent new things. The war did,\nafter\n&gt; all, sap all of Cybertron&#39;s resources and ended its golden age, so why\n&gt; couldn&#39;t it stop technological advances as well?\n&gt;\n&gt; Although I believe that when the Autobots and Decepticons were awakened\n&gt; transwarp technology was being developed. I guess that&#39;s a step forward.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Glad to see you&#39;re alive, Firefox!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Good night everyone.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
