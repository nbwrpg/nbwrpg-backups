Thrusters at 33%. Position \nstabilized.\n\nYggdrasil: Good. Geoscan of the surface.\n\nComputer: Geoscan starting... Done.\n\nThe holographic map of Earth showed where some bases were located. \nUnluckily, it didn&#39;t reveal anything else. None of the \ncharacteristics, no faction, nothing.\n\nBut Yggdrasil was worried about the number of bases. Five?!? There \nwere supposed to be only Maximals and Predacons here! Choosing would \nbe difficult...\n\nYggdrasil: Alright. Computer, aim pod launcher on these coordinates. \nLaunch 15 seconds after my mark.\n\nBefore anything else, he relayed a remote detonator for the ship&#39;s \nlaser to his comm system. He then got in the assault pod and had it \nmoved in the launch tube.\n\nYggdrasil: Start launch sequence now!\n\nFifteen seconds later, he was hurled down at sound-breaking speed...\n\n...only two klicks away from Rogues&#39; ship.\n\n\n"}}
