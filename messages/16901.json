Everything would be alright!\nIron Raptor watched as Prowl closed his eyes in pain from the movement, \nleaning his head back and meeting her worried and loving gaze with his own.\nShe listened to his hushed words, a warm smile forming on her lips as more \ntears trickled from her optics...but of joy.*\n\n&quot; I love you too.&quot;\n\n* Her own voice was quiet as she held Prowl closer to her, leaninf her own \nback against the wall and simply staying there and holding her only love.\nShe would stay there with him, keeping him in her arms until she was \ncompletely sure that he was alright.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
