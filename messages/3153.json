Dracona pointed to Panthyria.\n\n&quot;This is Panthyria, she&#39;s new around here!&quot; Dracona said. Plintissa nodded.\n\n&quot;Hello, Panthyria, nice to see another GOOD Maximal make it to the planet,\nbecause there&#39;s some pretty rotten ones here you have to watch out for.\nFirst, Ramhorn, accuses people of killing when they did nothing, second,\nIron Raptor, sad to say but it&#39;s true, Iron Raptor became my friend and\ndumped me as soon as she got a boyfriend, and third, Liono, the leader of\nthe Maximals, watch out for him, because Suukie took many shots for him and\nhe never thanked him and then he insulted me and my team, even after I\nprotected him he still insulted me!&quot; Plintissa said to Panthyria. Plintissa\ngasped and looked around, no Suukie in sight. Plintissa walked over and\ngrabbed the note off of Stronghold, who never ceased his card game.\nPlintissa read it and found that Suukie was at the Predacon base to prove\nhimself because he had been a burden the time he was repairing.\n\n&quot;All right, troops! line up!&quot; Plintissa ordered. Dracona walked into line,\nand then Airbomber, then Stranato, then Train Wreck, then Arrow, and then,\nwith a little persuasion, Scamrock and Stronghold. Sinesis and Sinister came\nwalking up, looking angrier than ever before!\n\n&quot;Panthyria, you can help us if you wish to, we need help, we have to go to\nthe Pred base and battle the Predacons, Suukie is there and he&#39;s going to be\nkilled if we don&#39;t do anything, so lets MOVE IT!&quot; Plintissa ordered. The\nPeople&#39;s Group (I&#39;m just going to call it the populists from now on, it&#39;s\neasier.) turned into their Beast Modes. Plintissa sent a come right away\ncomm message to Wrath and Kamodia and The Populists were on their way to the\nPred base.\n\nSuukie aproached the Predacon base and fired at the base insanely, not\nthinking about his own welfare...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, June 11, 2000 12:43 PM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; Ramhorn/Beachcomber/Smokescreen:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramhorn looked to Plintissa.  &quot;Apology not accepted.
