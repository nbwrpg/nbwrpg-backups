If it \ngot away, she would tell Megatron where Inferno is, and he would come \nfor him. He commed Drillbit.\n\n&quot;You take care of Inferno and get him back to base. I&#39;ll get that \nother bot. We can&#39;t let her get away with the info she has!&quot;\n\nStarscream started flying after KitKat\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq arrived back at the Ark, relieved that they could now \nput their hard attained supplied into the Ark. They went inside and \nbegan installing new computer boards.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois smiled, thinking what a delight it must have been to have been \nworking with these people just a short time ago. He slumped beside a \nwall and turned to Cybershark.\n\n&quot;Wake me up in two mega-cycles, and than I&#39;ll take over. We&#39;ll \nprotect ourselves over the night, and perform the experiment \ntomorrow. Who knows, by this time tomorrow we could all be sipping \nenergon on Cybertron.&quot;\n\nVulois fell asleep, but he had another dream.\n\nIt was a continuation of the previuos dream. In it, Battera and \nCybershark had arrived, at were attempting to free Vulois from his \nchains. Than the evil Vulois appeared, and fryed them both, growing \nnew chains oon Vulois. The evil Vulois transformed into Child, and \ngazed at him.\n\n&quot;Oh great Vulois! Train me! Make me as great as you!&quot; Just than the \nbeing split, becoming Child and someone he had never seen before, but \nsome how knew his name.\n\n&quot;Nemesis....Nemesis Enforcer?&quot;\n\n&quot;Right Vulois.&quot;(Not moding! Dream sequence!), &quot;Little did you know, \nbut for all your mission I planned to destroy it. And now you have \ndone you job for me, and crushed yourself. But now I have a new task, \nand that is to defeat Child and NEVER give peace a chance. And what \nyour doing....could be very bad for these plans. You remember \neverything here, but when you wake up, you won&#39;t even remember this \ndream. If you remember your memories though, you will remember this. \nAnd you will try to stop me. So I will strengthen your chains, and \nnever et the old you leak out again!&quot;\n\nA massive cross came out of the ground, and Vulois was pierced \nagainst it.\n\n&quot;Now let your Alliance personality come back to you!&quot;\n\nWith that the dream ended, and the evil Vulois came back to take \ncontrol of the body.\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nAll the Trainers had come out of the CR, and Prebon was planning.\n\n&quot;It would take too long to develop a weapon to counter act their \nchips. We must attack now, while they are weak! We will simply kill \nthem, fix their bodies, remove the chip, and use them to store new \nsparks who will serve us. Come Trainers, we attack the Ark again in \none mega-cycle!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
