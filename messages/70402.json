Not even myself. So, I ask all of =\r\nyou to show him the respect, you would show your leader, Lord Elder, and Pr=\r\nimes who have governed before me. Let this be known that it is not a reques=\r\nt, but as a Prime, I am telling you to respect those who have shown the cap=\r\nability of turning over a new leaf.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; He&#39;s tell=\r\nn&#39; the truth guys, Perceptor&#39;s legit.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot also gives them a =\r\nthumbs up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And if I didn&#39;t give a thumbs up then you&#39;d know it&#39;s not t=\r\nrue.&quot;\n\n\nCheetor paused, anger and distrust written clearly on his face, and=\r\n\nalthough he&#39;s too far away from Tuscon, or anyone still in the pit to\nsee =\r\nit, it is also in his voice as he responded with a single word,\n&quot;FINE!&quot;\n\nMe=\r\nanwhile Ramulus and Airhammer say nothing, although Ramulus grumbled\nslight=\r\nly as he attempted to draw poeple up. However it was impossible\nto say whet=\r\nher Ramulus was grumbling about Perecptor about pulling\npoeple up by himsel=\r\nf or perhaps about the situation in general,\nRamulus was a grumbler anyway.=\r\n\n\nCheetor came over and began helping Ramulus pull as Airhammer stayed\nin t=\r\nhe air, acting as security, his sharp sensors keeping a lookout.\n\nWith Chee=\r\ntor&#39;s help, and hopefully anyone else who was pulled up, it\nwas easy to pul=\r\nl everyone else out of the pit, even Tuscon, who proved\nto be the heaviest =\r\nof them all.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n&gt; Tucson Prime waits for everyone to get out =\r\nsafely before making moves to get himself out of the deep hole. He assists =\r\non holding the cable so is to make it easier for the others to climb out. I=\r\nt was what Optimus Prime would have done, before helping himself out of a t=\r\night jam.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; All right, I don&#39;t wish to overload anyone, so I will wait =\r\nuntil everyone else is out safely, before I get out of here myself.
