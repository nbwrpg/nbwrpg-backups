He \nturns and heads once again toward FZ, his guns firing. Prowl&#39;s wing \norbs gave him an exact idea of what was going on around him, so he \ncould &#39;see&#39; shots fired at him even from behind.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ&#39;s scanners report a bot flying up behind him. By the time Shocker \nfires, FZ flies to the side, avoiding the shot. He growls as several \nshots from Prowl hit him. That bot was getting annoying.\n\nFZ flies back a bit and fires one of his glowing missiles at Prowl. \nThe Maximal spins to avoid it, but FZ presses a button on the missile \nlauncher and the missile explodes in midair, right next to Prowl. A \nblue energy wave flows from the missile, enveloping about 6 feet in \nevery direction and draining energy from everything it touches. \nProwl&#39;s eyes widen as he feels his boosters shut off and his energy \nlevels drop almost to the point of rendering him unconscious. He free-\nfalls toward the ground, feeling energy rush through him when he \nleaves the blue energy field and his energy levels slowly start to \nclimb back toward normal.\n\nProwl looks up as his boosters come back online, seeing FZ&#39;s foot \nflying down toward him. Before he can react, FZ kicks him in the \nhead, both bots falling toward the ground.\n\nThe blue energy field remains where it is, with the potential to \ndrain bots that touch it of energy.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEight nails dig into Astral&#39;s leg, sticking themselves into the \narmor. The Alliance bot growls and fires several plasma shots at \nTorca.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFenox ducks under the explosive tusk and several other shots, firing \nback with three shots from her rifle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStarlight flies backwards as optic blasts hit her, denting her armor. \nShe fires back with several darts, reaching for her charge launcher. \nSeveral autogun shots hit her, making her aim a bit off.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing Klant taken care of, Recklessa turns to fire at Torca, a large \nenergy blast sending her flying several dozen feet. Firearm drives \ninto the battle, opening fire with his turret on Recklessa and his \nmissile launcher on Bumblebee.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGriplash fires two missiles at Shocker. An EMP blast hits him in the \nleg, sending him down to the ground.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler runs out of the Cybertronian Fire, firing at Repressor and \nhitting the bot in the underside. Repressor shakes as he decends, \nmechfluid pouring from where Grimmler&#39;s shot hit him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot frowns, watching several Maximals arrive at battle. He \nmakes his way toward the Cybertornian Fire, firing two missiles at \nRatchet. He jumps into the air as the grassland catches on fire, \naccidently hitting FZ&#39;s energy field. Gasping, Perndabot falls back \nto the ground, trying to regain energy that was lost due to the field.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster jumps to the left, dodging several shots fired at him but \nnearly getting hit by a stray tranquilizer dart from Starlight. He \nlooks up at Manterror, returning fire.\n\n\n"}}
