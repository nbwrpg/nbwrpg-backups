And, \nbefore it hit him, he said the one thing he could think of.*\n\n&quot; Oh S@#$!!&quot;\n\n* The lightning shot through him, making his fur seemingly explode off his \nbody. The fur that was left on him, curled really tightly to his body, \nmaking him look like a french-poodle. He bounced around and stuttering.*\n\n&quot; d-dd-d-dd-dd-d-ddd-d!&quot;\n\n*He jittered into the bush again, falling on his ass. It would be up to \nShadow Cat now.*\n\n* Shadow Cat was flying high above the battle, oblivious to every thing till \ntwo missles flew past her and exploded. She growled. This was getting \nannoying. She lifted her arms to the sky and called with all her might for \nthe great forces of the air, her eyes turning a bright purple. the wind \nbegan to pick-up around her and the clouds darkened. Electricity crackled \nand roared towards her at her call. It condensed around her body, hugging \nher like a lover might, until she was the lightning herself. She shaped \nherself into a torpedo shape and shot down towards the pred. No way was she \ngoing to miss this time!*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
