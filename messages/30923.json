He looked inside, it was good to see\nfriends again. He was a bit uncertain of what to do now, considering he had\nnever been asked to join, and now they had forgoten, perhaps there is\nanother, more peace loving group, maybe he had these Maximals all wrong.\nMaybe they were not the good guys, or at least not as good as he wanted to\nassociate with. He wasnt to impressed by some of the soldiers conduct\nduring peace talks, and the comanders distrust and short fuse. Then one of\nthe chambers announced it&#39;s completion. He rushed over to it with some\neagerness, and pressed the button for the release hatch. Out stumbled a\nsmall blue and grey robot. Firedrill grabbed his shoulder to help stabilize\nhim. &quot;Whoaaa, you okay Beachcomber&quot; he asked hopefully. In an easy and\nnonthreatening voice the robot awnsered.\n\n\n&quot;Yeahhhhh. My head&#39;s a bit sore, but I&#39;ll be okay, did you save me from\nenemy fire?&quot; he askes. &quot;No, some Maximal did. He made a nice impression on\nme, but he was the only one. I don&#39;t know if we belong here buddy&quot; he\nawnsered to the question. He then helped Beachcomber against a wall, so he\ncould lean against it, and shake off his pain. Firedrill then stared\nintently on the last CR chamber, hoping for it to open, so they could maybe\nleave.\n\n\n\n"}}
