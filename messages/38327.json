He taps his comm to reply.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Permission granted,&quot; he says, &quot;Join and do your best.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;He then turns as he hears footsteps behind him, seeing Antagony. &quot;Ah,\n&gt;good. Welcome to the Alliance, Antagony. Did Perndabot already show you\n&gt;around the base?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;As he was replying to the femm, his comm was sending a transmission to\n&gt;Daemos. &quot;Welcome to past earth,&quot; the transmission read, &quot;This is \n&gt;Zardus,Alliance commander. I&#39;m interested in your offer. Can you come to my\n&gt;base or should I go to your location to discuss you working for the\n&gt;Alliance?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jen D.&quot; &lt;jeniff@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (ooc: im sorry if this is short. i have to go soon and have to type\n&gt; &gt; quick)\n&gt; &gt; +++ Supernova Flare Scrap Vycir Slasis +++\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Supernova and his team were training in the holo rooms of the Iron\n&gt; &gt; Fist when they heard the Intergalaction Gladiator League&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; transmission. They continued training untill they were done with the\n&gt; &gt; session, and then Supernova opened his comm to Zardus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Commander,&quot; he transmitted to Zardus, &quot;this is Supernova. Requesting\n&gt; &gt; permission to join the Gestalt League for the IGL.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Antagony had been looking for Zardus, and then she saw him walking\n&gt; &gt; through one of the hallways of the Iron Fist. She jogged to catch up\n&gt; &gt; with him, and finally reached him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hello, sir,&quot; she said when she approached, &quot;I&#39;m Antagony, the new\n&gt; &gt; Alliance member.
