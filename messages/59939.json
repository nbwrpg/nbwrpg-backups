The \nrush stoppped as abruptly as it started. Her optics went back to \nnormal and she sat looking at Malice. Her tone of voice was calm and \nrelaxed. &quot;Hmm, not bad.

I do not have an easy life among these \n&gt; Maximals or Predacons.&quot;\n&gt; As he talked, he mixed several liqures together in a sequence and \n&gt; then added refined energon.
