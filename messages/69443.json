If they stayed any longer,\n&gt;&gt; it would harm the people. He transforms out of his SUV mode and addresses\n&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus formally, as taught by his Autobot bretheren. Being blind, he\n&gt;&gt; pauses for a moment to hear if anyone was around him, to be sure that he\n&gt;&gt; had\n&gt;&gt; not stepped on anyone when he transformed.

It had taken three weeks to clear the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rubble and begin rebuilding; the Maximal base however, was a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; total\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loss: only the lower level remained, which merely contained a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed ractor system and the prison cells, which concievably\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modified to be used by the loca police.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;So you&#39;ll be leaving us?&quot; asked the mayor, already knowing the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; answer.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yes.
