To him Restoration was more than just restoring artifacts, makin=\r\ng them appear and work like new, it was also about restoring old programmin=\r\ng and recovery of important data. He did not know the extent of the corrupt=\r\nion upon which was placed on Rodimus but he knew he couldn&#39;t just throw in =\r\nthe towel on his leader. Autobots stuck together, and through thick and thi=\r\nn, he&#39;d keep his pledge to never abandon his fellow Autobots. He also reali=\r\nzed that if he was going to get anywhere, he&#39;d have to do it himself. \n\n&quot;On=\r\n second thought, I think I&#39;ll go this one alone. Don&#39;t wait up for me, I do=\r\nn&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back too soon.&quot;\n\nHe bids Kenzo good bye and walks out of =\r\nthe room. \n\n&quot;Oh before I forget, have the CR chamber prepared for Rodimus. =\r\nHe&#39;ll need it more than me.&quot; \n\nHe was dead set on recovering his leader. An=\r\nd this time, nothing and no one would get in his way of achieving his missi=\r\non. He sends one final message to Lord Perseus.\n\n&quot;Lord Perseus, it&#39;s come t=\r\no my attention that my leader, Rodimus Prime, has been abducted and altered=\r\n severely. This puts the Matrix of Leadership at a grave Risk, but most of =\r\nall, his spark, which I believe is too precious to waste for evil purposes.=\r\n I can not abandon my leader, not even in his corruptive state. I hereby an=\r\nnounce that I am on route to locating my leader, and I DO intend to BRING H=\r\nIM BACK. Hopefully, the damage can be reversed. If not, there is question o=\r\nf the well being of the Matrix. I must recover it, perhaps not for my own p=\r\nersonal gain, but for the benefit of Autobot kind. It&#39;s too precious to los=\r\ne to the hands of those who thirst for power and greed. I swear by Primus&#39;s=\r\n name, I will return, but my return may not be a fast one. May Primus guide=\r\n you as he guides me. This is Tucson, signing off. I will report to you aga=\r\nin, once I know more of the condition of my leader.&quot;\n\nHe signs off, gets of=\r\nf the ship, and transforms into SUV mode, hoping to find Rodimus via his so=\r\nnar systems.\n\nTag: Kraftlos and Cyclonus.\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_000B_01CAAC35.34373D40\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Diso-8859-1 http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18882&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY \nst=\r\nyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff; PADDING-LEFT: 10px; PADDING-RIGHT: 10px; PAD=\r\nDING-TOP: 15px&quot; \nid=3DMailContainerBody leftMargin=3D0 topMargin=3D0 Canvas=\r\nTabStop=3D&quot;true&quot; \nname=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCalibri&gt;=\r\nOOC: the matrix isnt inside Rodimus is insinde of one \nminion I dont rememb=\r\ner who&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt Tahoma&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3 f=\r\nace=3DCalibri&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3 \nface=3DCalibri&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #f5f5f5&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;font-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B=\r\n&gt; &lt;A title=3Dmagicquartz@... \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@...&quot;&gt;S=\r\nandy&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Friday, February 12, 2010 10:33 PM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3Dnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; Recov=\r\nering Rodimus&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCalibri&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DCalibri&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN \nstyle=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;=\r\nDIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;From what Kenzo had told him, Tucson could now put t=\r\nwo and two together and \nnow realized that his restoration abilities along =\r\nwith his skills as a warrior, \nwould be needed more than ever.
