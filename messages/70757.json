Rodimus, and I can guide you through the tunnels, and as soon as you learn anything, report back to the Ark as soon as possible and do not try to form an attack on your own.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They all reply.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes Sir.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns his head back to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I can not see, and you can.  Can you remember the geological layout of those tunnels?  Rat Trap and the others will need those for recon purposes.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus nodded as he crossed his arms over his chest, &quot;I do indeed\nremember the tunnels, like the back of my hand.&quot; he said. &quot;I can lead\nthe tem down there and see what we can see.&quot;\n\nHe looked around at the others, &quot;Who ever is comming be ready to do\nsome serious digging, I am sure that the bugs won&#39;t make it easy for\nus.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll do my best to help her.

Enough for chit chats&quot;said ddryly the male&quot;We have to run a full\n&gt; scan, we need to know what happened with the Predacon and Maximal program&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus&#39; optics soften a bit as the discussion turns to Nightlight, &quot;I\nwill do whatever I can to help.&quot; He said cautiously. &quot;Will you need me\nto be here for it?&quot; He said, feeling pulled between his need to be out\nthere looking at the bugs and the need to be here for Nightlight.\n\nEven as Rodimus spoke Bump was moving the still form of Nightlight\nonto one of the examination beds. Bump, for his small size was strong,\neasilly lifting the female onto the bed. He carefully placed her down\non her back on the bed and then began to manipulate controls on the\nside of it.\n\nTwin scanners began to move across Nightlight, beepiing as they did\nso. &quot;The initial scan has begun.&quot; Bump said as he watched the results\nfrom his screen, Legacy moved to stand behind him, his single optic\nwatching the screen carefully as well.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
