I don&#39;t want to die.&quot; Manterror yelled.\n\n&quot;We have to get back to Cybertron and wreak havoc!  We never wanted to be \npart of this war anyways!&quot;\n\n&quot;Got that right!&quot; Injector yelled to Double Punch, the kind of leader of \ntheir group.  &quot;That slagging Stinkbomb brought us here!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, I know.  Next time we see him, his skid plate is toast!  But we have \nto find a way of this dust ball.&quot; Double Punch said loudly.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll just have to wait until the oppertunity presents itself, which isn&#39;t \nmy slagging idea of fun!&quot;\n\n&quot;Nor mine...&quot; Double Punch mused, tryin to think of a scheme, but none that \nwould get them off of Earth came to mind.\n\n--------\n\nBumblebee entered the mess hall of the Predacon base, getting a glass of \nliquid energon.  Taking a seat, he began to drink quickly, washing down \nrecent defeats with the tasty pink liquid.\n\n=====\n\nRamhorn entered his quarters, laying down on the recharge bed, soon falling \ninto a stasis-like sleep.\n\n===\n\nSmokescreen got out of the CR chamber he had been in, walking off towards the \nbridge of the Cybertronian Fire for orders.\n\n---\n\nChordate approached the Cybertronian Fire, activating his com towards the \nbridge.  \n&lt;This is Chordate, lower the defenses, I&#39;m coming in&gt;\n\n===\n\nKoga Shuko paced around on the bridge of his craft.\n&quot;Set and his soldiers are dead or captured.  Probablyd ead, that incompitent \nfool.  We can&#39;t handle going on the offensive.&quot;\n\n&quot;I agree, Koga Shuko.&quot; Unitron said, nodding in agreement.\n\n&quot;Then what are we going to do?&quot; Anubis asked.\n\n&quot;Yeah, I still want to fight!&quot; Hades yelled.\n\n&quot;Personally, some R&R would be kind of nice.&quot; Serpentor chimed in.\n\n&quot;Prepare long range comm systems.  Set them to send a message to the Predacon \nforces.  We&#39;ll need to have them help us slightly.&quot; Shuko ordered.\n\nA few moments later...\n\n&quot;It&#39;s done, Master Shuko.&quot; Unitron said, sitting at a console.\n\nShuko stepped to the console, Unitron stepping aside.  Sitting down, Shuko \nspoke into the microphone.\n\n&lt;Predacon base, I repeat, Predacon base, this is Koga Shuko.  Megatron, we \nhad a peace treaty between my forces and the Predacons under Hell Beast&#39;s \nrule.  Do you wish the same for us?&gt;\n\n"}}
