What makes you think the gun he was using wasn&#39;t an \nenergy weapon anyway?  And finally these people are actually military \nNOT AN EXPLORATION VESSEL, AND SOME RANDOM STOLEN SHIP!  They will \nprobably have the better weapons that can hold more power or ammo.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Whee... time to kill two birds with one stone. Dinobot wasn&#39;t using \nhis \n&gt; energy weapons during coming of the fuzors instead he was using a \nhand \n&gt; blaster and a shotgun laser blaster type thing. Because of this he \nran out of \n&gt; ammo. Also the weapons couldnt be solar charged because then they \nwould have \n&gt; to be outraegeously used to charge and power the weapon. And if \nthere were \n&gt; solar cells then there would have been power to power the weapons \nat night \n&gt; since what kind of idiot wouldn&#39;t have solar batteries that took in \nsome of \n&gt; the energy to operate the weapon at night. This still doesn&#39;t \nexplain why \n&gt; they faught at night either. Face it they needed ammo and they did \nrun out of \n&gt; it at times and in G1 they also ran out. Don&#39;t deny simple facts \nsuch as \n&gt; these because you feel you can&#39;t RP without firing 40 shots in one \npost at an \n&gt; enemy.\n\n\n"}}
