You&#39;re either in an island (as most of \nyour posts have said so far), or on a land base. Pick one.\n\n::FZ/The Galactors::\n\nFZ speeds up, detecting four missiles heading for him. If he went \nfull speed, he knew he could outfly them, but that wasn&#39;t neccessary. \nWithout slowing down, FZ reaches behind him with his left hand, \nopening his palm and pointing the orb at the oncoming shots and \nmissiles. The orb flashed, a large wall of energy flying out of it. \nThe wall smashes into the missiles, detonating them and absorbing all \nbut three of the laser shots, one of which misses FZ, the other two \nhitting.\n\nFZ speeds up, knowing that he wouldn&#39;t be able to do that too many \ntimes. But it didn&#39;t matter; no one could go against the wishes of \nthe Vok, he had first-hand experience with that.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Whoosieeees!!!!&quot; the Supernova jet taunts, flying away from the base \nonce more, outrunning the missiles heading for him. The jet largely \nignores the laser shots, knowing that Scrap&#39;s repair system could \ntake care of minor damage such as that. It turns sharply upward, \nleaving two missiles to glide down toward the shields of the base, \nspiraling to avoid most laser fire directed at them.\n\nThe Vicir/Slasys jet is hit by one of the missiles, spinning out of \ncontrol for a second but then regaining damage.\n\n&quot;Supernova, we need to adjust,&quot; it says over the comm to the Galactor \nleader. The Supernova jet acknowledges, the two jets flying toward \neach other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (If I&#39;m not mistaken JP is at the old Brotherhood base.
