No, I want to fight. I can fight. \nSure I may not have nearly enough hours on the field in combat, but I \nhave the programs to fight and defend myself. Besides, I am a full \ndragon. We are a rare type of transformer. I know the original \nbuilders didn&#39;t want dragons because they were an anomily.  We are \ncapable of flying, have fire breathing capabilities, can out manouver \nmost plains and similar types, and we can also endure more damage \nbecause of our special metal skins.  I can fight. I just need \ntraining.&quot;  Her skin was still shimmering from the drink she had \nfinished. &quot;Besides, most dragons are made of not only transmetal, but \ntrimetal.
