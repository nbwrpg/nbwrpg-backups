Of course, this was a quality he \nlooked forward to exploit. He would make a great leader... after him. \nThe only important thing was to be sure to have the black one on his \nside.\n\nTyrael: I am glad to see you too, Shadow Star. I am here to give you a \ncommand. As you might know, I have been given Gorefeast&#39;s position. As \nsuch, I am about to embark on a mission, and the council has given me \nfree choice of my crew. I want you as my second in command. Do you \nagree?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Shadow Star opened the door.

The robot \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; had looked at right after was Bleeder, Shadow Star&#39;s superior \n&gt; officer. \n&gt; &gt; They had both talked, and Tyrael had explained his reason&#39;s for \nhis \n&gt; &gt; choice. Bleeder had been in agreement. Now, Tyrael had to announce \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; to the principal interested...\n&gt; &gt;   He went to the junior officer&#39;s quarters. He hoped the young \n&gt; officer \n&gt; &gt; was there. After searching for a few minutes, he found the bot&#39;s \n&gt; door, \n&gt; &gt; and pressed the button announcing him.\n&gt; &gt;   Tyrael: I am Colonel Tyrael. I have come to meet with you, \nShadow \n&gt; &gt; Star.\n\n\n"}}
