His spaceship, a 15 metre in diametre spherical \nred orb, collides with an asteroid. Bob&#39;s head smashes into the \nsmall porthole that he had been looking out of. He shakes his head \nas his ship bounces off in another direction, heading into an \nasteroid field. Bob frowns, and buckles his seat belt, remembering \nwhat his mother had told him, &quot;Buckle Up!&quot; He had just never \nthought that he would need to use that information in his life. He \ngrabs the saftey bars, and waits.\n\n\nOOC: This is just me fooling around. =P\n\n"}}
