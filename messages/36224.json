(Final exams take alot out of a person)\n\n\n::Killfest/Neody::\n\nKillfest follows Drillbit through, firing his missile launcher at the Trainer base before a blast hits the ground next to him, sending him flying to the side. He regains balance, looking up and seeing a ship. He hears Cygnar&#39;s transmission, but doesn&#39;t move to retreat yet, firing another missile at the base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNeody&#39;s organic pods warn him of the detonating bombs before they are destroyed by them, the bot running back from the base. A bomb explodes behind him, sending him flying forward, landing on his face.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lets go Killfest!&quot;\n&gt; He runs through the tunnel catching up with Cygnar. He comes out the\n&gt; other side, opening fire on the nearest Trainer. His massive gattaling\n&gt; gun blazing.\n\n\n"}}
