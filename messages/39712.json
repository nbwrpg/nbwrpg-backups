Their double-bladed swords\n    slice the air. It is\n    =\r\nsparring, but one mistake still means death. Stallex\n    is by far the more=\r\n\n    talented fighter, but he can not match his father in\n    strength and =\r\nspeed, so\n    Mustex continues pushing Stallex back. Mustex gets a\n    good=\r\n blow to Stallex&#39;s\n    chest. Stallex buckles under the pain.\n    Mustex:Wh=\r\ny did you stop?\n    Stallex:It hurts.\n    Mustex:Don&#39;t stop. If you don&#39;t g=\r\nive into the pain it\n    will hurt 10 times\n    more. If you give into the =\r\npain you&#39;re enemy will see\n    that it hurts 100 times\n    more. I&#39;ve seen =\r\nalot of bots fall from that mistake.\n    Alot of bots wouldn&#39;t\n    have bot=\r\nhered teaching you that. Now back to beast\n    mode.\n    Stallex:Beast Mode=\r\n!\n    Mustex:Beast Mode!\n    Stallex:Internal repairs.\n     They begin to r=\r\nun off. The two horses run quickly\n    over the desert.\n    Stallex:What&#39;s =\r\nour next mission.\n    Mustex:Yours is in &quot;Training City&quot;. There&#39;s a monkey\n=\r\n    there named Rhesus. He&#39;s\n    an old friend and he can teach you about s=\r\ntealth.\n    Stallex:What about you?\n    Mustex:I have a plan to take out th=\r\ne &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, but\n    it&#39;s a 1 bot job.\n    Stallex:You know how dangerous=\r\n that is.\n    Mustex:Yes but  it&#39;s even harder for 2 bots to\n    infiltrate=\r\n. I have a shot\n    alone though.\n    Stallex:O.k., but come back alive. I =\r\nwant to be the\n    one to beat you.\n     They run off on their way to Egypt=\r\n.\n\n    2.Mustex and Stallex\n    Location:Training City,Egypt\n    Status:Pre=\r\nparation\n\n     Mustex and Stallex walk into a room. Rhesus is\n    sitting a=\r\nt a desk with his\n    back to them. He is leaning over some circuits\n    ex=\r\namining them. Mustex has his\n    hands behind his back and is wearing his p=\r\noker face.\n    He knows the following\n    conversation will be a simple mat=\r\nter of wearing down\n    Rhesus who is completely\n    oblivious to them.\n   =\r\n Mustex:Rhesus!\n     Rhesus jumps. Mustex walks around in front of him.\n   =\r\n Mustex:Still wasting precious Maximal computer space\n    on your own priva=\r\nte\n    casino my,my,my. Stallex go start training with\n    drones,Rhesus wi=\r\nll be with\n    you soon.\n     Stallex walks out.\n    Rhesus:Ahh,my good fri=\r\nend. So the &quot;Carnitrons&quot; rise\n    again. I can hear the cry\n    &quot;Carnitrons=\r\n Carnivate&quot;. We were the only sensible\n    group. We had a simple\n    motto=\r\n of &quot;stay alive&quot;.\n    Mustex:Shutup! If we were so great then why did I lea=\r\nd\n    us to get ambushed by\n    the &quot;Alliance&quot; for our first battle. As I r=\r\necall 5 of\n    the 7 of us were\n    damaged beyond repair. Now I see that a=\r\nnything except\n    a 2-way war leads to\n    extra senseless casulties. That=\r\n&#39;s why I intend to make\n    everyone pick Maximal\n    or Predicon. All you =\r\ncan think about is revenge on the\n    &quot;Alliance&quot;,and the\n    rebirth of a l=\r\nost cause. All I want is these parts and\n    a transport.\n     Mustex hands=\r\n Rhesus a paper. Rhesus looks upset as he\n    reads it.\n    Rhesus:Where am=\r\n I going to get a D.N.A. simulator.\n    Mustex:You&#39;re a bigger fool than I =\r\nthought if you\n    think I don&#39;t know where\n    Fox Fingers got his.\n    Rh=\r\nesus:Even so it will take me several weeks, but pay\n    could speed me up.\n=\r\n    Mustex:Did I mention I&#39;m planning to take out the\n    &quot;Iron Fist&quot; the A=\r\nlliance\n    will be permantly crippled.\n    Rhesus:Well in that case just l=\r\net me step into the\n    next toom to get what you\n    need. So,we can final=\r\nly get revenge for Croctas,\n    Kangato, Tigecs, Socrow, and\n    my lovely =\r\nMonkessa. I&#39;ve just finished about half a\n    dozen special\n    hover-cycle=\r\ns. They should do fine for you.\n    Mustex:Oh, and by the way I told my son=\r\n you&#39;d train\n    him.\n    Rhesus:Small price to pay. Does he know about the=\r\n\n    &quot;Carnitrons&quot; yet.\n    Mustex:Not a clue.\n    Rhesus:Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;=\r\nt snich &#39;till you come to\n    your senses.\n     Rhesus hands Mustex a large=\r\n box of parts and walks\n    away to train Stallex.\n\n    3.Mustex\n    Locati=\r\non:Training City,Egypt\n    Status:Traveling\n    Destination:Alliance Island=\r\n,Spain\n    ETA:5 hours\n\n    Rhesus:Come back alive.

Uh,that is\n    until you get back.\n    Mustex:bye\n     Mustex jumps onto =\r\nhis waiting hover-cycle and races\n    off.\n\n    4.Mustex\n    Location:Allia=\r\nnce Island, Spain\n    Status:Infiltration\n\n     Mustex looks at the newly c=\r\nompleted drone in front of\n    him. He activates\n    the D.N.A. simulator. =\r\nThe drone takes on his\n    appearance. He is positioned 500\n    yards from =\r\nthe &quot;Iron Fist&quot; so the Alliance won&#39;t risk\n    an attack unless he\n    gets=\r\n closer. He activates another pocket sized drone.\n    It begins its mission=\r\n\n    to plant a device he had built 100 yards from the\n    base, 40 feet un=\r\nder. When\n    his monitor says the drone is done he calls out the\n    code =\r\nthat will activate\n    the drones programming.\n    Mustex:Beast Mode!\n     =\r\nMustex turns on his jammer and attaches it to his\n    belt. The drone begin=\r\ns\n    transmitting a Maximal  frequency,goes to Beast\n    Mode,and bounds f=\r\nor the base.\n    Mustex keeps low to the ground so he won&#39;t be spotted.\n   =\r\n The auto-guns begin\n    firing, but no transformers come out. The horse ju=\r\nmps\n    away from every shot.\n    He stops at 100 yards away.\n    Drone:Mus=\r\ntex Maximize!\n     The drone transforms and begins firing arrows at the\n   =\r\n shield of the base. He\n    dodges all the beams,but only has enough power =\r\nat this\n    kind of level for 15\n    minutes. Fortunately,he doesn&#39;t need t=\r\nhat long. The\n    main turrets fireand take\n    him out. The shields flicke=\r\nr from power loss,but stay\n    intact. Mustex then\n    smiles when his moni=\r\ntor shows the pocket sized drone\n    the pocket sized drone\n    has reached=\r\n the surface. He activates the device and\n    it transmites a Maximal\n    f=\r\nrequency. The drone then starts firing. It has enough\n    power for 6 shots=\r\n. The\n    &quot;Alliance&quot; is beginning to sweat. The main turret\n    fires again=\r\n and the shield\n    goes down. Mustex deactivates th device and charges.\n  =\r\n  Mustex:Beast Mode!\n     As he charges he scans the base. The shields will=\r\n be\n    down for the next hour.\n    It will be down for the next hour. It w=\r\nill take him 10\n    minutes to navigate\n    the corridors to his destinatio=\r\nn and 10 minutes to get\n    back. He will go in\n    the  one way they won&#39;t=\r\n expect,The Front Door, 10\n    yards away he transforms.\n    Mustex:Mustex =\r\nMaximize!\n     Mustex draws a cyber arrow and blows the door open.\n    Usin=\r\ng his frequency\n    jammer as cover he sneaks to his destination. He walks\n=\r\n    into the Energon\n    storage room. The Energon will magnify the explosi=\r\non\n    of the small explosive\n    he made. He walks over to a computer cons=\r\nole and hooks\n    it up to the\n    &quot;Alliance&quot; network. If a remote connecti=\r\non is placed\n    on it it will blow from\n    2 connections to the network. =\r\nIt can detect the\n    Energon and will blow if much\n    is removed. It can =\r\ndetect the energon in the room and\n    will blow if to much is\n    removed.=\r\n It takes 20 minutes to diffuse and it would\n    be set for 15. There is\n  =\r\n  no deactivation code. The full blast could probably\n    not be contained.=\r\n Even if\n    the explosive is covered an electronic signal will\n    ignite =\r\nthe energon. He set\n    it and ran out.\n\n                CHECK!

The two \n    =\r\nhorses run quickly&lt;BR&gt;over the desert.&lt;BR&gt;Stallex:What&#39;s our next \n    miss=\r\nion.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Yours is in &quot;Training City&quot;. There&#39;s a monkey&lt;BR&gt;there \n    =\r\nnamed Rhesus. He&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;an old friend and he can teach you about \n    stealth=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;Stallex:What about you?&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:I have a plan to take out the \n    &quot;=\r\nIron Fist&quot;, but&lt;BR&gt;it&#39;s a 1 bot job.&lt;BR&gt;Stallex:You know how dangerous that=\r\n \n    is.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Yes but&nbsp; it&#39;s even harder for 2 bots to&lt;BR&gt;infiltr=\r\nate. I \n    have a shot&lt;BR&gt;alone though.&lt;BR&gt;Stallex:O.k., but come back ali=\r\nve. I want to \n    be the&lt;BR&gt;one to beat you.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;They run off on thei=\r\nr way to \n    Egypt.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2.Mustex and Stallex&lt;BR&gt;Location:Training \n    =\r\nCity,Egypt&lt;BR&gt;Status:Preparation&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Mustex and Stallex walk into =\r\na \n    room. Rhesus is&lt;BR&gt;sitting at a desk with his&lt;BR&gt;back to them. He is=\r\n leaning \n    over some circuits&lt;BR&gt;examining them. Mustex has his&lt;BR&gt;hands=\r\n behind his \n    back and is wearing his poker face.&lt;BR&gt;He knows the \n    f=\r\nollowing&lt;BR&gt;conversation will be a simple matter of wearing down&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus =\r\n\n    who is completely&lt;BR&gt;oblivious to them.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Rhesus!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Rhe=\r\nsus \n    jumps. Mustex walks around in front of him.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Still wastin=\r\ng precious \n    Maximal computer space&lt;BR&gt;on your own private&lt;BR&gt;casino my,=\r\nmy,my. Stallex go \n    start training with&lt;BR&gt;drones,Rhesus will be with&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;you \n    soon.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Stallex walks out.&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:Ahh,my good friend. S=\r\no the \n    &quot;Carnitrons&quot; rise&lt;BR&gt;again. I can hear the cry&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Carnitrons Ca=\r\nrnivate&quot;. We \n    were the only sensible&lt;BR&gt;group. We had a simple&lt;BR&gt;motto=\r\n of &quot;stay \n    alive&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Shutup! If we were so great then why did I=\r\n lead&lt;BR&gt;us to \n    get ambushed by&lt;BR&gt;the &quot;Alliance&quot; for our first battle.=\r\n As I recall 5 \n    of&lt;BR&gt;the 7 of us were&lt;BR&gt;damaged beyond repair. Now I =\r\nsee that anything \n    except&lt;BR&gt;a 2-way war leads to&lt;BR&gt;extra senseless ca=\r\nsulties. That&#39;s why I \n    intend to make&lt;BR&gt;everyone pick Maximal&lt;BR&gt;or Pr=\r\nedicon. All you can think \n    about is revenge on the&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Alliance&quot;,and th=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;rebirth of a lost cause. \n    All I want is these parts and&lt;BR&gt;a trans=\r\nport.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Mustex hands Rhesus a \n    paper. Rhesus looks upset as he&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;reads it.&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:Where am I going to \n    get a D.N.A. simulator.&lt;BR&gt;M=\r\nustex:You&#39;re a bigger fool than I thought if \n    you&lt;BR&gt;think I don&#39;t know=\r\n where&lt;BR&gt;Fox Fingers got his.&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:Even so it \n    will take me sever=\r\nal weeks, but pay&lt;BR&gt;could speed me up.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Did I \n    mention I&#39;m pl=\r\nanning to take out the&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Iron Fist&quot; the Alliance&lt;BR&gt;will be \n    permantl=\r\ny crippled.&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:Well in that case just let me step into \n    the&lt;BR&gt;n=\r\next toom to get what you&lt;BR&gt;need. So,we can finally get revenge for \n    Cr=\r\noctas,&lt;BR&gt;Kangato, Tigecs, Socrow, and&lt;BR&gt;my lovely Monkessa. I&#39;ve just \n  =\r\n  finished about half a&lt;BR&gt;dozen special&lt;BR&gt;hover-cycles. They should do fi=\r\nne \n    for you.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Oh, and by the way I told my son you&#39;d \n    trai=\r\nn&lt;BR&gt;him.&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:Small price to pay. Does he know about \n    the&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Car=\r\nnitrons&quot; yet.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Not a clue.&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t \n    snic=\r\nh &#39;till you come to&lt;BR&gt;your senses.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Rhesus hands Mustex a large \n =\r\n   box of parts and walks&lt;BR&gt;away to train \n    Stallex.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3.Mustex&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Location:Training \n    City,Egypt&lt;BR&gt;Status:Traveling&lt;BR&gt;Destination:Allia=\r\nnce Island,Spain&lt;BR&gt;ETA:5 \n    hours&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:Come back alive. You kno=\r\nw I can&#39;t restart \n    the&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Carnitrons&quot; without&lt;BR&gt;you.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:You&#39;re=\r\n not going to resart \n    them with or without&lt;BR&gt;me.&lt;BR&gt;Rhesus:I&#39;ll take g=\r\nood care of the kid... \n    Uh,that is&lt;BR&gt;until you get back.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:bye=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Mustex jumps onto \n    his waiting hover-cycle and \n    races&lt;BR&gt;=\r\noff.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4.Mustex&lt;BR&gt;Location:Alliance Island, \n    Spain&lt;BR&gt;Status:Infi=\r\nltration&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Mustex looks at the newly \n    completed drone in fro=\r\nnt of&lt;BR&gt;him. He activates&lt;BR&gt;the D.N.A. simulator. \n    The drone takes on=\r\n his&lt;BR&gt;appearance. He is positioned 500&lt;BR&gt;yards from the \n    &quot;Iron Fist&quot;=\r\n so the Alliance won&#39;t risk&lt;BR&gt;an attack unless he&lt;BR&gt;gets \n    closer. He =\r\nactivates another pocket sized drone.&lt;BR&gt;It begins its \n    mission&lt;BR&gt;to p=\r\nlant a device he had built 100 yards from the&lt;BR&gt;base, 40 \n    feet under. =\r\nWhen&lt;BR&gt;his monitor says the drone is done he calls out \n    the&lt;BR&gt;code th=\r\nat will activate&lt;BR&gt;the drones programming.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Beast \n    Mode!&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;Mustex turns on his jammer and attaches it to his&lt;BR&gt;belt. \n    The dr=\r\none begins&lt;BR&gt;transmitting a Maximal&nbsp; frequency,goes to \n    Beast&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nMode,and bounds for the base.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex keeps low to the ground so \n    he =\r\nwon&#39;t be spotted.&lt;BR&gt;The auto-guns begin&lt;BR&gt;firing, but no transformers \n  =\r\n  come out. The horse jumps&lt;BR&gt;away from every shot.&lt;BR&gt;He stops at 100 yar=\r\nds \n    away.&lt;BR&gt;Drone:Mustex Maximize!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;The drone transforms and b=\r\negins \n    firing arrows at the&lt;BR&gt;shield of the base. He&lt;BR&gt;dodges all the=\r\n beams,but \n    only has enough power at this&lt;BR&gt;kind of level for 15&lt;BR&gt;mi=\r\nnutes. \n    Fortunately,he doesn&#39;t need that long. The&lt;BR&gt;main turrets fire=\r\nand \n    take&lt;BR&gt;him out. The shields flicker from power loss,but stay&lt;BR&gt;i=\r\nntact. \n    Mustex then&lt;BR&gt;smiles when his monitor shows the pocket sized d=\r\nrone&lt;BR&gt;the \n    pocket sized drone&lt;BR&gt;has reached the surface. He activate=\r\ns the device \n    and&lt;BR&gt;it transmites a Maximal&lt;BR&gt;frequency. The drone th=\r\nen starts firing. \n    It has enough&lt;BR&gt;power for 6 shots. The&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Alliance=\r\n&quot; is beginning to sweat. \n    The main turret&lt;BR&gt;fires again and the shield=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;goes down. Mustex \n    deactivates th device and charges.&lt;BR&gt;Mustex:Bea=\r\nst Mode!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;As he \n    charges he scans the base. The shields will be=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;down for the next \n    hour.&lt;BR&gt;It will be down for the next hour. It w=\r\nill take him 10&lt;BR&gt;minutes \n    to navigate&lt;BR&gt;the corridors to his destina=\r\ntion and 10 minutes to \n    get&lt;BR&gt;back. He will go in&lt;BR&gt;the&nbsp; one way=\r\n they won&#39;t expect,The Front \n    Door, 10&lt;BR&gt;yards away he transforms.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nMustex:Mustex \n    Maximize!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Mustex draws a cyber arrow and blows =\r\nthe door \n    open.&lt;BR&gt;Using his frequency&lt;BR&gt;jammer as cover he sneaks to =\r\nhis \n    destination. He walks&lt;BR&gt;into the Energon&lt;BR&gt;storage room. The Ene=\r\nrgon will \n    magnify the explosion&lt;BR&gt;of the small explosive&lt;BR&gt;he made. =\r\nHe walks over to \n    a computer console and hooks&lt;BR&gt;it up to the&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Alli=\r\nance&quot; network. If a \n    remote connection is placed&lt;BR&gt;on it it will blow =\r\nfrom&lt;BR&gt;2 connections to \n    the network. It can detect the&lt;BR&gt;Energon and=\r\n will blow if much&lt;BR&gt;is \n    removed. It can detect the energon in the roo=\r\nm and&lt;BR&gt;will blow if to much \n    is&lt;BR&gt;removed. It takes 20 minutes to di=\r\nffuse and it would&lt;BR&gt;be set for 15. \n    There is&lt;BR&gt;no deactivation code.=\r\n The full blast could probably&lt;BR&gt;not be \n    contained. Even if&lt;BR&gt;the exp=\r\nlosive is covered an electronic signal \n    will&lt;BR&gt;ignite the energon.
