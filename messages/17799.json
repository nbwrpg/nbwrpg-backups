Squizzy \nwatching her didn&#39;t make her job any easier. Once set up she placed \nthe somple of DNA from the bug she&#39;d found into a scanner. The bug in \nquestion was a scarab. She scanned the DNA into the computer. She \nadded the DNA she&#39;d obtained when she&#39;d picked up Rat Trap. the \ncomputer scanned for similarities in the strutures. It would take at \nleast an hour for the comparison to be completed.&quot;Watch this for me \nwould you please, I&#39;m gonna get a little rest before my presentation \nto Zardus.&quot; She stepped into the corner and curled up. It wasn&#39;t the \nluxuries that she fealt she deserved but many places that Veratis had \nthem stop lacked suitable surroundings.\n\nVeratis studied the scans from the Protoform which housed the spark \nof Shadow Wing. he thought it was time she was educated. The old \nscience bot attached the receptors again and went into the protoforms \nmind. &quot;Hello Shadow Wing, how&#39;s my favorite patient today?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
