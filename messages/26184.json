He was huge! \nAmazed, she reached out and stroked his fur with one hand. This was \none big bot. Big beast modes like these wern&#39;t too common these days.\n\n&quot;Huh?&quot; she shook herself back to attention, looking up at D&#39;s \noptics. &quot;Oh. Yeah, this is earth. You&#39;re at the Alliance base.&quot;\n\nShe gestures behind herself, showing the Iron Fist.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * D simply crouched there and watched Fenox, his attention \nocasionally \n&gt; grasped by other transformers from time to time. But sooner or \nlater he \n&gt; looked back towards the female, finding that he wasn&#39;t so nervouse \naround \n&gt; her as of if he was just left alone.\n&gt; D slowly uncurled from his ball so that he was standing on all \nfours like \n&gt; some giant wolf, his back reaching the height of Fenox&#39;s optics.\n&gt; He was no small beast!\n&gt; But, he kept close to Fenox all the same. Besides, she was the only \nfamiliar \n&gt; part of this world he knew of at the moment.\n&gt; D swung his head around so that he was nearly looking Fenox in the \nface, \n&gt; catching her words and understanding them perfectly.\n&gt; Earth? Is that where he was? This place was called that?\n&gt; He looked at the fembot in a puzzled way.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; E-a-r-t-h?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * It sounded clumsy but he still mannaged to say what he had heard \nher call \n&gt; this place.\n&gt; D failed, however, to catch the remainder of the sentance, about \nthe war he \n&gt; just happened to drop in on. Though he really didn&#39;t care, he was \njust on a \n&gt; world of wonders and was eager to learn.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
