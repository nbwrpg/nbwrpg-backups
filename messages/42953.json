I can&#39;t transform, so I represent no danger for them! \nHad Daemos been online by now, I guess he would be a lot better than \nme on this, but he is not. As for strika, she has been asked on a \nmission by Gesper. So I request this assignment.\n\nMelchana:\n............................\nThen go, and make the Tripredacus proud...\n\nJetstorm:\nThank you, trainer.\n\nHe flies off away from australia and to South America.\n\n\n"}}
