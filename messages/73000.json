By\n&gt; running a clawed finger over it, he could tell how tightly packed it was.\n&gt; Touch would serve him well, as he remembers training with just his hands,\n&gt; ears and sense of smell to guide him.  And so he closes his eyes, going back\n&gt; to the days of his training with Master Yoketron.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; The walls may seem an impossible barrier, but the eyes can only perceive a\n&gt; fraction of what is really in front of you.  Embrace your other senses, see\n&gt; with your hands, ears, feet and nose, rather than with your eyes.  Feel what\n&gt; must be felt and sense what must be sensed.  Yes Master Yoketron, I remember\n&gt; what you taught me. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes a slow step away from the wall of debris.  Takes a few deep\n&gt; breaths. And with eyes completely shut, he puts his hands together as if\n&gt; slipping into some form of deep meditation.  Straight Shot looks to her\n&gt; brother and then to Leo and the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Guys, step back, I&#39;ve seen this before, it&#39;s a maneuver Master Yoketron\n&gt; taught him and it&#39;s a doozy.  Gee I sure hope it works.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride and Rattrap move back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Okay, I definitely sense he&#39;s up ta something we haven&#39;t seen him do yet.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With serene poise, and peaceful grace, Tucson begins with a form of Tai Chi,\n&gt; that appears harmless to those who know nothing of Ninjabot training.  Yet\n&gt; if Magmatron knew of it, perhaps he may know what would come next.  Ever so\n&gt; gradually, Tucson begins to move faster and faster as feet seem to lift off\n&gt; the ground before they even touch it, and then it comes.  He lifts his body\n&gt; off the ground and spin kicks the wall, with great force, attempting to\n&gt; weaken the wall.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;THOOM!!&lt;&lt;\n\nTUSCON&#39;s hit was impressive! Great fissures and cracks began to appear\nin the wall as almost immediately water began to burst out in small\nsections as actual breaks began to spray from the wall.\n\nThe wall was not broken yet, but it was definitely weakening!\n\nAt the same time MAGMATRON was distracted with his own project and\napparently had not noticed TUSCON, being that he was at least a mile a\nway or more. However SABERBACK seemed to be aware, his optics\nnarrowing as he focused on them, even as he stood at the base of the\nflaming pillar of energy.\n\nPointing in TUSCON&#39;s direction SABERBACK was evidently giving orders\nas the SHARKTICON guards turned to look at TUSCON and the other\nPREDACONS and MAXIMALS.\n\nMore SHARKTICONS stepped into view as well. in the end there were\ntwenty one SHARKTICONS, each of them transforming into their shark\nmode and began to fly in the direction of TUSCON and the others with\nhim.\n\n&quot;Look!&quot; TORCA said as he pointed back at the energy pillar or fire.\n\nFrom another opening another familiar figure could be seen exiting,\nhis identity obvious to them all, even if he was a mile away: DARK\nRODIMUS and he was carrying NIGHTLIGHT in his arms!\n\n&quot;There is more!&quot; BIG CONVOY said as looked as well, his fists tightly\nclencehd in anger.\n\nBehind DARK RODIMUS were other SHARKTICON guards, two of them also\ncarrying what appeared to be two other MAXIMALS: STAMPY and SHARPEDGE,\nneither of whom were moving.\n\nMAGMATRON smiled as OPTIMUS PRIME began to scream again, the sound of\nhis agony echoing throught the cavern. However the cry was\nsignifigantly weaker than before.\n\nWeaker and growing weaker with each passing moment.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
