He carefully noted that the Ark&#39;s passive sensors were online to alert him should anyone attempt to enter who did not possess an Autobot or Maximal energy signature. For the moment the place was locked up as tight as it could be. \n\nWith a leap Legacy pushed himself into the air as he transformed. Gears grinded as his very form flexed and contorted, and stopped as he assumed his military satellite form. With a thrust of power he rose higher and higher into the air. While not as agile as a jet, he was far more armored and ready for anything, as he oriented himself and his powerful sensor array in the direction of the Old Maximal Base. \n\n&quot;This is Unit Legacy&quot; Legacy transmitted over encrypted Maximal channels, &quot;I will be there in approximately 10 of this planet&#39;s minutes.&quot;\n\nWith a powerful thrust of his engiens he began to move swiftly out of view of the Ark. \n\nPreston\n(Legacy)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
