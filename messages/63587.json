You can not let your thought processes think for a single\nnano that one of his kind can be trusted! Eons have proven they are\nsimply incapable of keeping any type of honor. No! He is a Decepticon.\nHe is not worth the value of slag metal!&quot;  She kept her optics on him\nthe whole time. &quot;I know of a bot who trusted a Decepticon once. He now\n is nothing more than atoms scattered across the stars. They can not\neven conceive the concept of honor Rodimus.
