She gave IR a quick nod before running from the room \ntoward the bridge. Once there the first order of business was to raise the \nshields, if that was at all possible. It was a good thing Firearm brought \nthe powercore back on line when he did. By now there should be enough power \nto run the shields and maintain power within the CF. Hysteria tped out the \ncommand and within moments the shields flickered to life outside the CF. She \nopened a comm to IR:\n\n&quot;The shields are online commander. DO you want me to power up the EMP cannon \nif possible?&quot;\n\n*****\n\nThe small creature that mewed pitifully at Tavatron&#39;s feet was beginning to \nannoy her counterpart. With a psychic kick of sorts and several harsh words \nTav managed to gain control of a small portion of Tavatron&#39;s speech and \nmotor functions. Tavatron fought as best she could, but found herself \nslipping deeper into a &#39;living death&#39; of sorts as Tav assumed momentary \ncontrol:\n\n*&quot;Pitiful creature.&quot;*\n\nThe voice that emerged from Tavatron&#39;s form was disembodied and somewhat \nmechanical. Tav smiled wickedly before delivering a swift kick to the small \ncreature&#39;s lower gut. Tav chuckled soflty. The creature&#39;s helplessness \namused her so. All the while she was methodically binding Tavatron to her \nsubconscious. However, Tavatron fought against the mental restraints Tav was \nattempting to bind her in. The momentary flux in control causing Tavatron&#39;s \nbody to spasm and stiffen. The only physical attribute that even hinted that \nsomething was wrong apart from the spasming were the eyes. During the moment \nwhen Tav siezed control, her optics had gone from their usual crimson red to \na glassy black.\n\nTav shrieked mentally as she was forcefully removed from the realm of \nconsciousness. She hurtled through broken thoughts and dreams before finally \nsettling in the mother programming that had spawned her. Tavatron, once \nfreed from the mental restraints, nearly collapsed in exhuastion from the \ninner battle. If Dinobot had not moved to catch her she would have fallen to \nthe ground. She leaned heavily against him, her optics slowly returning to \nthier normal color. She couldn&#39;t hide this forever, nor battle it alone. \nPerhaps she should tell someone... No. The answer was clear. Some censor \nprogramming not only kept her from speaking the truth, but her own fear as \nwell. Tavatron refused to look at Dinobot as she leaned against him, slowly \ncatching her breath. She looked to the side, just in time to see Vehement \nblast the Ark with what appeared to be air:\n\n&#39;Must be a sonic wave&#39;\n\nShe thought to herself, barely hearing Dinobot speak. She turned to look at \nhim, her composure returning:\n\n&quot;My injuries must be more extensive than I originally thought.&quot;\n\nShe watched the scene between Iron Raptor and the other &#39;bots for a few \nnanoclicks, all the while considering Dinobot&#39;s offer. A better place? A \nquieter, more peaceful place, away from the battle and war... How long could \nshe last in a place like that? She loved the idea of peace, but she was a \nwarrior to the core. Nothing gave her more pleasure than the constant threat \nof battle. She knew, deep down, that Dinobot knew this as well. However, \nperhaps a &#39;vacation&#39; of sorts was in order. She could never abandon the \nMaximals, despite their current situation. When she joined things had been \nquite well. However, you couldn&#39;t abandon a cause simply because your goal \nseemed more distant or the operatives less committed. Now, more than ever, \nthe Maximals needed loyal troops with the capabilities to win this war. No, \nshe wouldn&#39;t leave them, not permanently. But perhaps she would take a trip \nto this place Dinobot spoke of when things settled down a bit:\n\n&quot;I will give your offer some thought.&quot;\n\nIn the recesses of her mind, Tav slept. The experience had weakened her \nconsiderably. Weakened, but not destroyed.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
