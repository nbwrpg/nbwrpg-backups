Opening her optics only to see her nose pressed against the cold steel floor wasn�t something that she had expected, more like waking up in the Matrix with no physical body to worry about.\nNo pains, no aches, no worries�no such luck!\nShe knew where she was and she knew that she was in trouble, her scanners giving her location when she woke up and the 5 armed bots standing just outside the brig.\nNot her day if one was to sit down and think about it.\nIron Raptor growled as she lifted her face from the floor and looked up, the lights causing her to blink a bit but then settling down.\nShe propped herself up on her elbows as she layed on her stomach, every inch of her body screaming with aching and plain out pain. Shifting her weight to one elbow she rubbed the back of her sore neck with her other hand, it feeling like it would snap in two any moment.\nIron Raptor then looked around at the 5 bots but moved her head slowly, naming them all in her head as she layed optics on them.*\n\n&lt; Dark One, Breakdown, Pyro, Hiss and Scavenger! Figures!&gt;\n\n* She glared at them before gathering her back legs under her and then pushing up with her hands to end up in the kneeling position, it being much more comfortable then letting her rib cage press into the steel floor.\nIron Raptor then took in a deep breath but one that was silent enough not to be heard, setting her hands on her lap and looking at the bars ahead of her.\nThose bars were only a few feet in front of her, the only things that were keeping her from returning to the Ark...not to mention that the Oblitercons would be a bit of a problem too.\nShe simply stared at them silently for a few moments but then slowly moved towards them and the bars, slowly crawling on her hands and knees...not a sound heard.\nA small grin creased her lips as she approached one of them, close enough to the bars to reach out and grasp.\nIf she could snap his neck and take his gun there wound be an better chance of her escaping the enemy ship and making it back home, a thought that was too good to refuse.\nHer own weapons disabled by the battle, it was the only way.\nWith a sudden movement she straightened herself up to stand on her knees and struck forward with her hand, hissing in surprise and irony as they struck the bars and felt a quick and powerful zap of energy!\nShe drew her hand back just as fast as she&#39;d struck and held it in her other one, looking at the bare circuits in it&#39;s palm.\nThe irony of it all!*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
