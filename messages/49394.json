Well,  your talk on \nstory improvement has inspired me (well it hit, but not home, it hit \nan unrelated part of my brain to give me this idea) to create a new \nchar I might name LN.  This needs to seem like a real war, and in war \nyou don&#39;t just have blasting, you have double-crossing, and spying.  \nI think I might just create a Predicon who comes to Earth and posses \nas a Maximal to get information and transmite it back to HQ&gt;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; The problem does not entirely rely on the players within, it relies \non the \n&gt; lack of real story in the RPG that isn&#39;t known to the entire RPG. \nThis whole \n&gt; artifacts thing seems to be some small last attempt to get people \ngoing \n&gt; again, but how long until battles will begin for the artifacts that \nwill \n&gt; undoubtably end and begin and follow through like all the other \nbattles? When \n&gt; will bots suddenly realize they have ammo and can&#39;t possibly have \nclips for \n&gt; weapons that allow them to fire 120 shots by firing 40 shots in the \nspan of 3 \n&gt; posts? When will people realize that their charachter can not \npossibly dodge \n&gt; and then counter attack to each person that fired at them in a \nsingle post \n&gt; when the posts are supposed to last a few seconds each. This isn&#39;t \nDBZ, it&#39;s \n&gt; Beast Wars and if you haven&#39;t noticed noone in the show goes SSJ \nand suddenly \n&gt; dodges everything every five seconds and then returns fire to each \nperson. \n&gt; When will players also acknowledge simple facts that some \ncharachters cant \n&gt; take the exhuberent amount of damage that others do and sometimes \nthe \n&gt; charachter they have is just completely outclasssed, outgunned, and \nif a \n&gt; fight continued against the charachter they were fighting, out of \nservice. I \n&gt; have proposed many things to the council and soem  have been \nwelcomed more \n&gt; than others yet I have seen none of those even leak into the RPG. \nIn order to \n&gt; correct some of the things I have described above the concil needs \nto take \n&gt; more control and enforce certain rules to prevent them from \nhappening, of \n&gt; course the players can help too simply by waking up and noticing \nthey aren&#39;t \n&gt; little kids who are controling a Bantor action figure and having \nhim wreck \n&gt; everyone of their toys because they think its cool. We are adults \nand as we \n&gt; all know the only toy Bantor could possibly beat down is Optimus \nMinor. And \n&gt; maybe a spy changer or two since he would get nuked ready fast by \nany BW toy \n&gt; with a gun. Anyway, my ranting is over.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Qs7, LN, Whatever- who now feels like taking a bat to Bantor for \nthe hell of \n&gt; it.\n\n\n"}}
