That is deep enough. I can feel the energon!\n\nHe aimed with his laser and melted the last barrier. Under his eyes, \nthe energon sphere pulsated. The build-up started working its effect \non him, but he took no mention of it. What he had in a arm&#39;s length \nwas much more better...\nHe moved his hand and tried to break a piece from the sphere. However, \nwhat happened was not what he had planned. The energon began to \nvibrate at the touch, soon making the ground shake and emitting a \nstrange and strident sound.\nFor one of the first time in his life, Warhead was awed. He felt not \nfear, because his programs did not permit him, but he was very \nimpressed.\n\nWarhead: PREDACONS! OUT OF THE HOLE NOW!!!\n\nThis, however, was too late. The sphere imploded and sent a wave of \nenergy towards the surface, and one ray of light jetted in space. It \nwent in all directions in a radius of 5 kilometers. All transformers \nit hit would be struck down, suddenly overwhelmed by the energon.\n\nWarhead fell on the ground, in a stasis lock. The predacon base would \nsee that they had lost them...\n\n\n"}}
