There&#39;s no real difference though since I \nonly have a Pentium II processor, but anyway I let him go online the \nrest of the day in exchange for the $20 worth of RAM.  And then \nSaturday I was supposed to go over to a friend&#39;s house and we and a \nfew other people were going to work on a script for a short film of \nours.\n\nThat fell through though so I just invited one of the friends over so \nwe could work on the script and mess around with one of our new \ncameras.  Well, that friend spent 7+ hours online hitting on an 8th \ngrader until she went out with him, (we&#39;re 9th) so that fell \nthrough.  Then we played Delta Force on three networked computers for \nabout an hour.  We were going to work on above mentioned script but \nat 3 AM we couldn&#39;t think so we justed watched Wayne&#39;s World 2.  Then \nlater that Sunday my brain felt like such a mess that I couldn&#39;t \nreally concentrate.\n\nSo...anyway, the point of this long e-mail is to say my time is going \nto be gobbled up by the Time Chyort soon.  On one MUSH I have \nRomania, Los Angeles, and England to desc.  In way of school I have a \nginormous math test due Wednesday that could bring my grade from a D \nto a B (a most excellent thought) and a German test Wednesday that \nbasically determines my grade.  That&#39;ll be easy, except for the dang \nto have verb. \n\nAnd then while listening to AC/DC&#39;s Thunderstruck I just got the urge \nto work on a new TF fanfic series, and since it&#39;s been a few months \nsince I&#39;ve worked on any TF fanfics I feel I need to get moving on \nthat.  So my time will be very, very spread out this week, but in one \nor two weeks my time should be less occupied.  Thankfully I&#39;m not in \nanything too active in this RPG so I can still keep up with the \nposts.  But can ya please keep all this OOC stuff out that isn&#39;t \nimportant?\n\nAlso, I WILL respond to that Maximal City post, or die trying.\n\n-Uni\n\n\n"}}
