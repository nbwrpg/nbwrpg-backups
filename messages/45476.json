His brain analyzes the situation, \n&lt;No hostile actions detected, apparently a plea for help... all \nthings considered, I&#39;ve got no reason not to help him.&gt;\n\nThe large bot reaches down, grasps the obstruction, and his four \nstrong legs easily drag it off of Belthassan. He releases the piece, \nand the side of his head observes the other bot. \n\n&quot;And who are YOU?&quot; He grunts with a slight emphasis on the you, \nshowing some of his confusion, &quot;Friend of foe?&quot; He crouches, tensing \nup, although only the observant would notice it.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Belthassan, worried by the sounds he had heard, was now underneath \nthe \n&gt;  former top of the Renewal Chamber.
