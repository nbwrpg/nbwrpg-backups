Organics didn&#39;t quite know what to make of the situation.  \nEither he was telling the truth or he was covering up more ulterior \nmotives.  But whatever the reason, he was really wanting to get to \nwork.\n&gt; &quot;Perhaps you need a baby sitter, Dad?&quot;\n&gt; She cracked up as Malice tried to take a swing at her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord/Elita:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I have work to do to...&quot;said Windlord and looking to \nMalice &quot;Where you go, Malice?

I promise to come back and take care \nof you.  While I&#39;m gone, why don&#39;t see Organics?  I&#39;m sure she would \ntake care of you just as well as I can.  Later we&#39;ll play a game, \nhow&#39;s that?  If you&#39;ll let me work with Wolfblade and finish what \nwe&#39;re doing, we&#39;ll play outside for a while?&quot; \n&gt; Organics continued to grin as she looked between Malice, Elita, \nand Camoflage. &quot;Yes!
