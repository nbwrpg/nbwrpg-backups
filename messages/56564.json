Not sure what to think, \ndo... or even fells. Feeling was something she didn&#39;t want. But...\n&quot;Scourge,&quot; she stated as she took 2 steps towards him. &quot;You exist & function \nnow. At current... that is all that matters. Eventually, we all can return to \nCybertron. & the Decepticons can conquer Cybertron & the remainder of the \ngalaxy once more.&quot; She smirked, in rememberance of the old days.  \n FoxManRoar1 [1:48 AM]:  Scourge stopped, he turned slowly. &quot;You don&#39;t get it \ndo you.&quot; &quot;It was all over, in my time stream &quot;we&quot; are in peace, there is no \nwar, Unicron was destroyed and the Black Plague was stopped... There was no \nlonger a need for factions, and I ruled over them all, I Killed Starscream \nfor the murder of soundwave, and I fought ShockWave to the death, and I ruled \nover them all with an iron fist!&quot; No war, no crime, no factions, we stand \ntogether....&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [1:51 AM]:  She watched him for a time as he spoke. \n&quot;That was your supposed time. Where ever you came from.&quot; \nPausing, she wasn&#39;t sure whatelse to say next.  \n EmprzAnastazia [1:52 AM]:  &quot;It&#39;s time for something new.. it&#39;s time for a \nchange, Scourge. Forget where you came from.&quot; \n FoxManRoar1 [1:53 AM]:  He looked at her, his expression crossing his face \ntold she had said something wrong... &quot;I cease to exist if my time does not \noccur!&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [1:54 AM]:  &quot;Your time or your Dimension?&quot; more of a curious \nstatement than a question. A slight smirk upon her face. \n FoxManRoar1 [1:55 AM]:  He looked at her and slowly it set in... &quot;I could be \nin another dimension?&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [1:57 AM]:  &quot;anything ... is possible, Scourge. Remember the \nQuints had portals to various dimensions. Who&#39;s to say that it&#39;s possible \nwith you. Either way, your actions you do here, will still have a profound \neffect. & I mean to not let ANYTHING happen to Megatron. Period!&quot; Pausing a \nmoment. &quot;Let alone those whom are Decepticon comrades.&quot; She smiled at him.\n \n EmprzAnastazia [1:57 AM]:  &quot;Don&#39;t do anything so rash & quickly, Scourge.&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [1:58 AM]:  &quot;I have served Megatron for many millenia. & I \nshall continue to do so.&quot;  \n FoxManRoar1 [1:58 AM]:  &quot;Quints?&quot; These boggled his mind... &quot;What are \nquints?&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [2:00 AM]:  She gazed at him, stiffening to her full height \nwith pride. &quot;For now.. what I can tell you... they are the enemies of all \nTransformers. NEVER trust them. No matter what they say.&quot;  \n EmprzAnastazia [2:01 AM]:  &quot;They are beings either with 5 faces, of a single \nface... all float on an energy beam. But they are cruel & emotionless.&quot;  \n FoxManRoar1 [2:01 AM]:  He looked at her and smiled. &quot;Are you with anyone at \nthis time?&quot; He realized how that sounded, &quot;Errr I mean faction?&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [2:06 AM]:  She smirked. &quot;I am a Decepticon. Nothing more, \nnothing less. Though, I am allied with those who call themselves Predacons.&quot; \n FoxManRoar1 [2:09 AM]:  Scourge&#39;s metallic mind began working. &quot;Why, why not \njoin with my team, I may not be of your time, But I am a Decepticon as well.&quot; \n\n EmprzAnastazia [2:11 AM]:  &quot;Time has no meaning for me. Just as long as you \ncall yourself a Decepticon & are devoted to the cause, then I shall be \npleased.&quot; She grinned.  \n EmprzAnastazia [2:12 AM]:  &quot;But... understand this. I serve ONLY Megatron. I \nmay appear to follow others, but... I will only serve Megatron.&quot;  \n FoxManRoar1 [2:14 AM]:  He smiled and raised his hands to his face and \nslowly with a hsss he made a slight movement, and lowering his hands revealed \nthat he had removed the face plate, underneath his face resembled a younger \nbot, one who very well may be the son of the bot she cared so much for, &quot;As \nmy word as a decepticon i promise you a future that will be glorious!&quot;  \n EmprzAnastazia [2:16 AM]:  She watched him, the face so similar, & she \nsmiled. &quot;Decepticon rule forever,&quot; she stated softly but with force.  \n FoxManRoar1 [2:21 AM]:  He looked at her and smiled. &quot;So what might I ask is \na fellow &quot;con&quot; doing here?&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [2:27 AM]:  &quot;Long story.. unknown reason. I was on Cybertron, \nin stasis, then reformated into a pathetic techno organic form. Seems that \nwhen I went to Vector Sigma, by old form was refused to be returned to me. I \nhad a run in with the Tripreds, escaped... landed here, met a coupel Maximals \n& then found the Predacons. However... nothing is what it was in the good ol&#39; \ndays.&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [2:27 AM]:  &quot;There is a supposed Maximal who is supposed to \nbe working on reconstructing my old form. I have a Predacon hunting him down. \n&quot; \n FoxManRoar1 [2:31 AM]:  Scourge looked at her and blinked. &quot;Our C R Chambers \nmust work differently, ours scans the beings around it inorder to create a \nform suited to it, the dinos became organic, as well as the others, but i was \nmade... if our scanners scanned me as it worked on you then you would become \na Mecha once again.&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [2:32 AM]:  &quot;Noted & appreciated. Having a relation of sorts \nto organics is not something I care for.&quot;  \n EmprzAnastazia [2:33 AM]:  Despite her form was a transmetal mix/fuzor of a \nwhite tiger & a hawk.  \n FoxManRoar1 [2:34 AM]:  &quot;I know what you mean... i&#39;ll have to melt my \ntrailer after letting the dino&#39;s ride in it.&quot; He looked her over and smiled. \n&quot;But if I may add no femme in my time is not quite as well rounded.&quot; He \nchuckled. \n EmprzAnastazia [2:35 AM]:  She looked up at him, with a slight smirk. &quot;A .. \nminor adjustment.&quot;  \n EmprzAnastazia [2:36 AM]:  &quot;Anothe rminor adjustment could be made as well,&quot; \nas she reached over to his hand & took the face mask. &quot;Your faceplate is \nbetter without it.&quot;  \n FoxManRoar1 [2:37 AM]:  He looked at her and then the mask. &quot;I keep it as a \nreminder, of where i came from, and where i went...&quot; He smiled &quot;You miss my \nfather don&#39;t you.&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [2:40 AM]:  Her face somewhat went to a strange emotion. How \ncould she answer that one. She remained silent, as she glanced back at the \ndormant form of Megatron. But, she thought about Hydras. It had been the \nfirst time she had thought about him since the beginning of this personal \nmission. So much has happened... \n EmprzAnastazia [2:40 AM]:  But.. she answered, that even with Hydras, he was \nin stasis & damaged quite terribly... \n&quot;Yes,&quot; she said with a soft voice.  \n FoxManRoar1 [2:43 AM]:  He smiled and kneeling his chest opened and a panel \nslid open and a object slid out... &quot;This is Megatron&#39;s last master plan \nunfinished, but remembered..&quot; He lifted and handed to her, A matrix unit... \n&quot;All its missing is a sparke to ignite it...&quot; He smiled handing her the \nprurple and black object that looked like a clock work model of the planet \nsaturn... \n EmprzAnastazia [2:45 AM]:  She gazed at the object, as though it were \nStarscream given Leadership finally. \nTaking the object in her hands, she gazed at it. &quot;& how is it possible to \nfill this?&quot; She thought about the Autobot Matrix, that was from millions of \nyears of built up wisdom.  \n FoxManRoar1 [2:48 AM]:  The souls of two great leaders... Father created it \nso when i fought Prime and died my spark would ignite it changing him into \nthe decepticon leader he wished to be.&quot;   \n EmprzAnastazia [2:50 AM]:  She pondered that a moment. &quot;Indeed. \nUnfortunately, you shall not get far here with that goal. Unless you face \nRodimus Prime. However, I doubt that Hydras would allow you to have that \npleasure.&quot; \n FoxManRoar1 [2:53 AM]:  He smiled and shook his head and as he reached out \nthe Matrix began to glow and hummm a small wave of energy began spreading up \nMaxi&#39;s arms...  they looked like her old arms but were different in some way \nhe slid his hand away and smiled. &quot;I can ignite it for a short time with out \ndying.&quot; &quot;But it is not a good idea to stress it.&quot; He looked at the matrix and \nsmiled. &quot;You may keep it with you if you wish. \n EmprzAnastazia [2:59 AM]:  She felt the energy pulse through her, nothing \nthat was painful, just energizing. It was like Energon. \nShe looked up at him, watching him a moment. Not sure what to do or say. Then \nnodding, &quot;Thank you,&quot; \nBut curiousity struck her again. &quot;You said you can only ignite it for a short \ntime... does that happen often when you touch it like that? Or was this the \nfirst time?&quot; Observing the device. \n FoxManRoar1 [3:02 AM]:  &quot;I beleive it feeds off me when I carry it within my \nframe.&quot; &quot;Like a reverse battery, and when i concentrate I can awaken it...&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [3:04 AM]:  &quot;I see,&quot; her curiousity was aroused. A Decepticon \nMatrix. The possibilities was just too good to be true. \nShe smiled at him, with a wicked little glimmer in her crimson optics.\n\n(Ooc in de books megatron did create a decepticon matrix.)\n\r\n--part1_a.309bb034.2bfc7da3_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=3Darial,helvetica&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot; style=3D&quot;BACKGR=\r\nOUND-COLOR: #fefefe&quot; SIZE=3D1 FAMILY=3D&quot;SANSSERIF&quot; FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot; LANG=3D&quot;0=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt; EmprzAnastazia [1:37 AM]:&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR=3D&quot;#000000&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fefefe&quot; SIZE=3D1 FAMILY=3D&quot;SANSSERIF&quot; FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot;=\r\n LANG=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR=3D&quot;#000000&quot; style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:=\r\n #ffffff&quot; SIZE=3D2 FAMILY=3D&quot;SANSSERIF&quot; FACE=3D&quot;Arial&quot; LANG=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;Watches S=\r\ncourge a moment.
