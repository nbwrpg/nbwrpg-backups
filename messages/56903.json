Her voice showing \n&gt; restraint as she tried to keep her emotional chip at bay. &quot;Besides, \n&gt; I&#39;m a warrior.

Not to a maximal. Not now, not with the war. Not yet. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cam::\n&gt; She had crouched down and snuck up behind one of the drones. She \n&gt; crept right next to it, then, with her little reflexes, she jumped up \n&gt; on top of the drone. It spun around. She held  tight and reached for \n&gt; the deactivation button.  She pressed it and the drone sank to the \n&gt; ground. She sat up in fox kit mode and looked at Blackfang and \n&gt; KitKat. Neither bot was paying attention to her. So, she decided to \n&gt; fix that. She yelled at them in her small voice, &quot;HEY! LOOK! I DID \n&gt; IT!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; She turned and looked at the little maximal. &quot;Well done kid. Now get \n&gt; the rest of them. One is good, but let&#39;s see if you can do that every \n&gt; time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; She did a back flip and yelped back. &quot;SURE I CAN! JUST YOU WATCH!&quot;  \n&gt; And off she went to take out the next drone.\n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. &quot;Ahh, and she reminds me of me when I \n&gt; was that young.

Windlord\n&gt; &gt; trusts Empath, and she&#39;s a Decepticon. Likewise, I could get to \n&gt; trust\n&gt; &gt; you. If you are trustworthy to me, then even my commanders would \n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; nothing to say about it, not even old Yggie.

I can take them out. \n&gt; Easy. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang showed me how. Just have to jump on the tops of them \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hit the switch on the back. I&#39;ve been practicing. I&#39;m not as good \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang yet. But I will be soon. I just have to get a little \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bigger.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She nodded her head. &quot;You know kid, you&#39;d make a good predacon \n&gt; one of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; these days.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Camoflage:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;A Predacon?

All we want is the right to \n&gt; rule \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this planet as we are destined to. Predacons are supposed to rule \n&gt; &gt; &gt; over all the CyberLife. It&#39;s been told to us since the dawn of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cybertron. I just can&#39;t figure out why the maximals stand in the \n&gt; way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She scratched the top of her head. &quot;Why are the Predacons \n&gt; supposed to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; make up all the rules?

We Preds are going to \n&gt; fight \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for our right to rule. And the Maximals will forever stand in the \n&gt; way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of that destiny. We will never get along.

No bot \n&gt; can go \n&gt; &gt; &gt; against thier own programming,&quot; she looked up at Blackfang, &quot;no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; matter how much they want to.&quot;  She looked back at Cam. &quot;Now, \n&gt; let&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; see you take on a drone by yourself.&quot; She patted Cam on the head \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stood up. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang glanced shyly at Kitkat, then looked back at Cam.
