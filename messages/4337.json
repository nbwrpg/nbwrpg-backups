She turned and faced the console of the \ndrill.  She smiled to herself.\n&quot;Maybe he isn&#39;t that bad after all.&quot;  She was pleased.  He was actually \nbeing nice to her.  Then she looked at the drill.  It wasn&#39;t dissintagrating \nthe rock anymore.  She stopped and climbed down.  She moved infront and \nlooked at the hole.  She could see daylight shining through. She ran back to \nthe drill and enlarged the hole so that a bot could walk through it. She \nmoved the drill back and walked outside.\n\n&quot;Hmm, not bad if I do say so myself.&quot;\n\nShe then realized that for this to be a secret way out, she would have to \ncover it up.  She went back and looked for Quickstrike.  She would need his \nstrength to help lift the hatch for her to weld it to a frame.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
