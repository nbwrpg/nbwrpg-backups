This was definitely not good, unless..\n\nProwl&#39;s eyes shift to the massive and fully functional bulk of the\nElement (the ship, not the gestalt), his mind considering something.\nIf they used the Element as the core...\n\n&quot;Kluster,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;Get as much metal on the outer\nlayer of the CF and then just let the shields drop. These attackers\nare going to help us with the upcoming constructi-AAH!&quot;\n\nThat was the point when IR transformed into her second beast mode,\ncausing Prowl to transform as well. He gets the images of the four\nbots and takes off, heading for Cracken.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster recieves Prowl&#39;s transmission and his yelp of surprise,\nlooking over to see Prowl transforming into a monster. He sighs, going\nthrough what Prowl had asked him to do in his mind. It made sense. A\nthick layer of metal around the CF would protect it much better than a\nshield, although the outer few rooms would be gone.\n\nHe opens his wrist comp and taps a few buttons, watching several\nexplosions happen on the outside of the CF. The outer layer begins to\nmelt inward, creating a very thick and hard shell around the\nbattleship. By the time the shields drop, the shell would be complete\nand ready to take abuse.\n\nKluster aims his missile launcher, firing two missiles at Gremlin.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler sees the new enemies arrive, turning to fire two missiles at\nAdrax.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKillfest&#39;s yes narrow as he detects Hell Beast&#39;s signature. He turns,\nrunning toward the NDE member. Aiming his EMP and missile launcher\ncarefully, he fires four EMP blasts and two missiles at Hell Beast,\nthe missiles homing in and following.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; wait, nevermind, I got it.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Marine was the first one to see her coming. Iron Raptor,\nleader of the \n&gt; Maximals. The first glimpse of her he had ever seen. Her synthetic\nmuscles \n&gt; flexed as she barrled towrds them, holding something in her hand.\n&gt;        &quot;Continue the attack, I will deal with her.&quot; The giant turtle\nbot \n&gt; said. His green armor plating reflected the sun, and a small hum\nsignaled his \n&gt; dual shoulder missle launchers setteling on his broad shoulders.\n&gt;        Jade eyes watched her feverishly coming closer. It was clear\nnow that \n&gt; in her hand she held some kind of blade, poised to land in his body\nno doubt. \n&gt; He couldnt let the Fem get any closer than she already was. Hand to\nhand \n&gt; combat would be out of the question. It was time to act, and\nquickly.\n&gt;        Noting her leadership abilities, and the sheer fact that her\ngroup \n&gt; still endured while under constant attack made Marine question what\nhe could \n&gt; do. His internal processor assesed the probability of her next move.\nShe was \n&gt; to smart to come in, head on, even in her super mode. This was going\nto have \n&gt; to knock her off her feet.\n&gt;        Two black missles streaked out of the launchers with a trail\nof grey \n&gt; smoke tailing them. The projectiles quickly cut through the air and\nmet there \n&gt; target: the right and left side of Iron Raptor. The two side\nexplosions \n&gt; caused a bright rose of flame and sent debris scattering. \n&gt;        Marine quickly scanned the destroyed area. His jade eyes\npulsed with \n&gt; an optic blast ready to take her down agian if needed. He knew that\nhis move \n&gt; wasnt a checkmate, only to knock her down. Now the hard part came\nin.\n\n\n"}}
