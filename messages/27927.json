Luzbel&#39;s body in robot mode was strange:  \nhis legs and arms had metalic scales and they ended in sharped craws \nwhile his trunk and chest armour&#39;s like his helmet had silver metals \nwith strange reliefs that decorated them.\n\nHis robot mode was similar his master Darkfate, but several things \nmade him diferent. In one arms, Luzbel had a megablaster (Like \nMEgatron G1)\n\nHis pale handsome face didn&#39;t show his evil spark. Just his pale blue \neyes showed, at time, his pride and devil spark.\n\n&quot;What do you think??? &quot; mocked Luzbel while he saw Aerotaur &quot;I needed \nkill someone today... Unluckely you&#39;ll die...&quot;  \n\nLuzbel without said anything shot against Aerotaur 5 shot&#39;s\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Burning Hammer: Party?

He strikes \nBurning\n&gt; Hammer several times in the face. Burning Hammer pulls out a gun, \nsomething\n&gt; he swore he wouldn&#39;t use, and fired it rapidly into Perplex.

With one final \ncrackle,\n&gt; Perplex mumbled about his family and went into stasis lock.
