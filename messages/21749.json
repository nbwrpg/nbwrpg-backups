It would take a day or so, without stopping, to complete the \ntask. But the sooner it was done, the better.\n\n    Megatron wasnt an idiot. He knew how deep rooted revenge could be, and \nhate even more. Kitkat had shown both of these qualities when he had left her \nto die. Now, working together, he could sense it. It seemed with the arrival \nof this bot Apocolypse, the tides had turned. Yes.\n    He made his way down into the holding compartments of the ship. His \ntroops prefered it there, instead of upstairs. Entering the room he saw all \nof them, including Hell Beast&#39;s and Black Aracnia&#39;s troops.\n    Making his way through the room he came to the far corner where Hell \nBeast reclined like a true Roman Governer. He was surprized that he wasnt \nchewing on some grapes. Now, there yes met.\n    &quot;And what are you doing down here, Megatron?&quot; Hell Beast questioned with \na bit of agitiation. He didnt like being walked in on while resting.\n    Megatron sat down at the small pillowed area. &quot;I do belive our host is \ngoing to betray us.&quot; He said getting right to the point.\n    &quot;Really? Without us she is just another small faction. I dont think she \nwill be doing anything.&quot; The senator said.\n    &quot;Apocolypse, he is meeting with her now. I dont like it. Tell Aracnia to \nget here. Our council needs to have its first official meeting.&quot;\n\n    Black Aracnia looked longingly at Quickstrike. It had been so long scince \nthe two of them could be alone. She had never truly loved someone like this, \nbut she now carried his-there-child. He was a good, strong, and smart bot. He \nwould provide for her.\n    &quot;Tell me darling, whats troubling you?&quot; She asked, placing her claw on \nhis thigh, rubbing gently.\n\n"}}
