In this dream, his eyesight is returned and as sharp as it w=\r\nas before his unfortunate mishap with Cyclonus.  Yet, he carries his body s=\r\nize of a Prime as indicated in a reflective panel inside the room.  As he t=\r\nouches the panel, it wisks him out of Yokitron&#39;s quarters and back in the w=\r\noods of the planet he is on now.  Odd enough, he finds himself inside a lar=\r\nge cave not far from the Ark. \n\n&quot; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen this cave.  =\r\nOdd, I know where I am and at the same time, I don&#39;t. &quot;\n\nA silver mist circ=\r\nles his body and then vanishes inside a sub cavern as if telling Tucson to =\r\nfollow it.  He does just that and finds himself in a darker cave yet, as th=\r\ne mist circles it creates just a hint of light and a hint of what resides i=\r\nn the cave.  To his left ankle, a long, silver, tail with shimmering scales=\r\n moves ever so slightly, with a gentile nudge to Tucson&#39;s foot, urging him =\r\nto come closser.\n\n&quot; Hello?  If I have done anything to disturb you, I apolo=\r\ngize.&quot;\n\nIn response, a pair of Ice blue optics lights up the cave, as the f=\r\norm of a very old, majestic, dragon, peers straight into Tucson&#39;s optics.  =\r\nThe creature as silver as the warrior who is in his company.   Before he ca=\r\nn say or do anything, Tucson wakes up abruptly with a sudden gasp, sitting =\r\nup in his chamber.  Talon was still beside him, yet he did not want to wake=\r\n her.  He takes a few breaths and settles down to rest once again.  He thin=\r\nks to himself, trying to figure out what the dream meant and why did he hav=\r\ne it?\n\n&quot; There has to be a meaning to what I just saw.  I wouldn&#39;t have dre=\r\nmpt about Yokitron&#39;s quarters if it was just a dream.  Then the cave, and t=\r\nhat silver dragon that was the same size as Hydras.   Why did I see him? &quot;\n=\r\n\nHe tries to move his damaged arm, and still the damage remains.  Being on =\r\na world primarily for the adaptation of organic life, there was a good chan=\r\nce that Tucson would have to give up his wheels for something more suitable=\r\n to the environment.  \n\n&quot; Wait a minute, Tucson, you can answer this yourse=\r\nlf.  Two times you went against Hydras with little luck.  Why?  Because an =\r\nAutobot shell can only do so much.  In order to defeat a creature of Hydras=\r\n power, you must BECOME a creature similar in strength.  Only then can you =\r\novercome your nemesis.&quot;\n\nHe closes his optics to resume his rest.\n\nOutside =\r\nthe Ark, Straight Shot decides to venture out with Quickstride to scan the =\r\nparameters for intruders to confirm a save construction site for the wind a=\r\nnd water turbine.  Quickstride stops and points to where the wind turbine i=\r\ns going to be.\n\n&quot; Right up there, that&#39;s where it&#39;s gonna go.  Nice locatio=\r\nn, too.  Close to the Ark, tall enough to conceal the turbine. &quot;\n\nStraight =\r\nShot gives him a thumbs up.\n\n&quot; Looks good ta me.&quot;\n\nMoments later, they reac=\r\nh the mouth of the cave and begin to explore it.  \n\n&quot; Wow, Quickstride, thi=\r\ns cave is enormous.  There&#39;s a sub chamber off to the right.  I wonder wher=\r\ne it goes.&quot; \n\nQuickstride follows. \n\n&quot; This is perfect.  So outa the way th=\r\nat those Preds won&#39;t even know what&#39;s in here. &quot;\n\nHe suddenly trips on some=\r\nthing and looks down to find a long, silver, reptillian tail.  Then a low g=\r\nrumble from inside startles them both.\n\nStraight Shot looks to Quickstride.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Please tell me that was your stomach.&quot;\n\nQuickstride shakes his head with=\r\n a terrified look on his face.\n\n&quot;Nope.  Wasn&#39;t me.  &quot; \n\nHe quickly gets int=\r\no beast mode as Straight Shot hops on his back. And as the occupant of the =\r\ncave emerges, they are now greeted by a large draconic creature but waste n=\r\no time in fleeing the area.  Quickstride bolts back into the Ark with as mu=\r\nch terror as Straight Shot as they both scream;\n\n&quot;LEO, RODIMUS PRIME!&quot;  \n\nT=\r\nruly the duo had been severely spooked by the dragon&#39;s presence.\n\n\n"}}
