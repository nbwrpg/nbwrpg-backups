Though Pyro was in control, the \nother minds were urging to get out of there as more and more bots began to \npull out stronger weapons and start to get a little angry at the gestalt \nattacking their higher-ups.  About to disassemble, Oblitertron saw the \nmercenaries working for the Newcomers attack his leader, Zardus.  Yelling, \nOblitertron turned his weight towards the mercenaries&#39; skimmer, firing an \noptic blast as he raised a palm, firing a missile off at the same skimmer.\n\n"}}
