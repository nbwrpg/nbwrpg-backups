He didn&#39;t reply. Then today after he told me about the sub, I brought \nit up again and it didn&#39;t go to the bottom of the floor, etc.  The shields \nmodifications will be what should&#39;ve been done with common sense.\n\nAs for the torpedoes and mines, that was after we heard of the sub.  But \nthose are all necessary precautions.\n\nFinally, the Alliance Base was put into several different pieces and carried \noff by shuttle.  It didn&#39;t move, and it wasn&#39;t intact when it did so.  Yan \nand my problem with the mobile base rule is if you make the base into a sub.  \nI mean a sub the SIZE of BA&#39;s base.  Using the base for scrap parts is \nanother thing.  But a sub as big as BA&#39;s base, we&#39;d have to be crazy to say \nit wasn&#39;t a mobile base!)\n\n\nLord Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n"}}
