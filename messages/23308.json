He fluttered \nover on little wings to a new, more intresting creature which he hadn&#39;t \nstudied. He hovered over the male-bots face and looked deep into his eyes, \nthen zoomed around his head, settling on his shoulders for a moment then \nflying to another perch on Prowl. After thouroly inspecting him, he then \ndecided that Prowls head was a comfortable perch and landed on the very top \nof his head, and nestling in his hair.*\n\n&quot; Mew?&quot;\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Old Friends.\n&gt;Date: Thu, 07 Dec 2000 11:50:14 -0800\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor kept a hold on the little cat/bot, looking him over and\n&gt;thinking that he was rather a cute little puff of fur.\n&gt;Tiny and with those cute little wings coming from his shoulders.\n&gt;\n&gt;She looks on past the little creature towards Prowl, knowing that she still\n&gt;had durt him but found no other words to say...or think.\n&gt;Iron Raptor leans her weight on her other leg for a moment before she\n&gt;suddenly heard foot-falls heading in their direction, looking towards the\n&gt;sound and then seeing a familier face.\n&gt;It was ShadowCat, then hearing her before another past friend blundered \n&gt;into\n&gt;his sister and left them in a pile at her feet.\n&gt;Looking down at them as if she wasn&#39;t amused, lifting a brow.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt; ...yeah....&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Her mind too occupied with seeing her friends to pick up the scan of\n&gt;Arcangel, but picking up on Prowls thoughts instead.\n&gt;She looked up at him, a puzzled expression on her face.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt; Arcangle? But I ordered everyong to forget this and go to the meeting.\n&gt;But, might as well let him get here, then we can all go back to base.&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor then looked down at her friends again, all in one large heap.\n&gt;She simply sighed, still noticing the small fuzz-ball under her fingers.\n&gt;She looked ShadowCat and SnowTech over, they hadn&#39;t seemed to change from\n&gt;the last time she had seen them.\n&gt;But...she had changed...quite a bit.\n&gt;Iron Raptor looked at the moving mass of arms and legs for a moment more\n&gt;before bending over and looking down at them, simply letting the small\n&gt;cat/bot go and leting her hands rest on her knees.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; So, what brings you two here?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Since they couldn&#39;t hear her thoughts, verbal communication was needed.\n&gt;Though, she really didn&#39;t mind.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get more from the Web.
