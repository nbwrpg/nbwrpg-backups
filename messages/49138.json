And as for another idea, I am currently working on one with \nRauq.  Another thing this RPG needs is some good strict rules and someone to \nenforce them. Say I was just joining, seeing someone fire 40 shots and \nsomeone dodge them really turns me off and think the  RPG is a waste of my \ntime because just from those posts I believe most of the people have to be \nmoding. thats on example but I know things are trying to be changed by rauq \nand azure.\n\n"}}
