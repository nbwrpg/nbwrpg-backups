She spins, and it glances off of her\n&gt; &gt; shoulder plating. Lynxiz begins to fall, and is forced to break her\n&gt; &gt; fall by placing her hands on the ground, and pushing herself back up\n&gt; &gt; into a standing stance. She backs off slightly, keeping her eye on\n&gt; &gt; Stranato. She circles, snarling and holding her left upper chest\n&gt; &gt; wound, taking a defensive stance.
