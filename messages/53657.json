The shuttle looks=\r\n something like a Bident but instead of \ntwo \n&gt; &gt; pokers it has two lightni=\r\nng bolts.  It is a metallic silver/white \n&gt; &gt; color.\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;      But en=\r\nough of the space shuttle, inside the unique spaceship \n&gt; &gt; were two indivi=\r\nduals.  They were both silver metallic.  Over \ntheir \n&gt; &gt; metallic though w=\r\nas more metallic but this is where the two \n&gt; &gt; individuals looked differen=\r\nt.  One was a shinny red metallic and \nthe \n&gt; &gt; other was a shinny blue met=\r\nallic.  So for now they shall be known \nas \n&gt; &gt; Red and Blue.  Red was stud=\r\nying a map of the world known as \nEarth.  \n&gt; &gt; Blue was sitting in the pilo=\r\nt&#39;s chair but instead of carefully \n&gt; &gt; planning the course he had his legs=\r\n up on the controls and was \n&gt; &gt; twiddinling his thumbs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;      &quot;Hey=\r\n Brother,&quot; Red said as he turned and faced his \n&gt; &gt; comrade, &quot;What the Grea=\r\nse Bolting are you doing!  Why aren&#39;t you \n&gt; &gt; planning our landing!  I don=\r\n&#39;t want to crash.  Plan ahead.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       &quot;Plan Ahead?  Yeah right!&quot;  =\r\nBlue said as he let out a small \n&gt; &gt; chuckle, &quot;You are suppose to move with=\r\n the flow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       &quot;We need a landing vector!&quot;  Red yells.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n       &quot;YOU NEED a tic-tack!&quot;  Blue yells back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       Poor Poor Bl=\r\nue, if only he listen to his brother.  But he \n&gt; &gt; decided to not listen to=\r\n his brother and decided to go with the \n&gt; &gt; flow.  Well now they are flowi=\r\nng on the mountains of the Northern \n&gt; &gt; Continent where they crashed.  The=\r\nir exact location of the crash \nis \n&gt; &gt; (using the map on the events page) =\r\nas far east of the Predacon \nbase \n&gt; &gt; as possible and about an inch up.  I=\r\nt looks like these two bots \nneed \n&gt; &gt; a rescue operation. (Hint:  I just m=\r\naking the rescue operation to \nsee \n&gt; &gt; which groups are active and that is=\r\n how I am going to decide who \nto \n&gt; &gt; join to rescue me.)  (So Bots, move =\r\nout.)\n\n\n"}}
