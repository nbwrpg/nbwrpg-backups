She returned Dinobot�s look of puzzlement with one of her own before turning to Cyber Claw. Tavatron took several sniffs before finally satisfied that this new �bot was indeed not a male. Any huntress worth her weight in prey could smell the difference. She refrained from saying anything, however, curious as to how the situation would resolve itself. \n\nTavatron took another look at Dinobot, his gaze narrowed and tail thrashing. The last time he had looked like this he was prepared to slag her, the last thing they needed was for Dinobot to attack this new �bot. Tavatron walked over to Dinobot, purposely standing slightly in front and to the side of him. Tavatron closed her eyes for a moment, suddenly feeling very tired and light-headed, but the feeling passed just as quickly as it had overtaken her senses. However, it had awakened another one of those shadow memories, the one�s that weren�t her own, and yet she seemed to know them all, locked away somewhere deep in her subconscious. \n\nTavatron concentrated for a moment, then her eyes widened when she finally realized what the problem was. It wasn�t the fact that this �bot was new, or that she had attempted to impersonate a fellow warrior, and quite well except for her obviously feminine scent, it was the fact that this �bot looked like Dinobot had a long time ago! The memory awakened had been one of Dinobot standing outside an old exploration ship, possibly Maximal, she didn�t know how she knew it was him, she just did. He looked more or less exactly like the raptor standing a few feet from her. \n\nTavatron looked once more at her Dinobot, the one she had battled and hunted with, then at the clever clone across from her. Or, perhaps the one across from her was the real Dinobot, and the one she knew a clone... \n\nNo, that was not true. Every circuit within her knew that the Dinobot she was standing beside was the real one. Then why had this new �bot taken it upon herself to impersonate Dinobot? Tavatron growled softly, trying her best not to threaten but to let this new �bot know that she had better come up with a good explanation:\n\n&quot;Please, explain yourself... Dinobot.&quot; \n\nIt felt odd calling this �bot �Dinobot�, but she was willing to play along, for the time being anyway.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
