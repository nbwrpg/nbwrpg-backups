Did you hear the rules Atma? Now voting for yourself\n&gt; and i didn&#39;t mention Technosis&#39; name in the voting party. You have\n&gt; one vote. Us five, you, me, Drillbit, Pseudo and Phobia are voting,\n&gt; cause we basically lead. No matter what KitKat says we have to\n&gt; relieve her of command. I don&#39;t want to, but for the safety of the\n&gt; group we have to. My vote for Phobia stands. Pseudo, you vote for\n&gt; Atma. Drillbit, Atma, Phobia, whom do you vote for?&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix gazed at Ramulus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You want to put yourself inside Fliq? I don&#39;t know. I mean, when\n&gt; Fliq and I were in my body, it changed to this. Your spark could\n&gt; change Fliq&#39;s body, and with the damage who knowd if he could take\n&gt; it. But if it&#39;s the only way........Alright. He&#39;ll die anyway if we\n&gt; don&#39;t. What do i do?&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois&#39; face was struck with happiness.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Child....this theory could be great. How do you think the angels\n&gt; placed this book here? Human history has not been recorded yet. Thery\n&gt; barely exist. They must know time travel of some type. If they left\n&gt; that secret with the book...who knows what we can do? What if we\n&gt; stopped Hell Beast from coming  to the planet? We could end this war,\n&gt; before it began? It&#39;s already a proven fact that organics were on\n&gt; Cybertron. What if we went back and saved them? We could prevent the\n&gt; upcoming catastrophe. Sure, there could be conciquences, and before\n&gt; we made any decision we would weigh it, but if we could learn it, it\n&gt; would make our jobs a whole lot easier!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
