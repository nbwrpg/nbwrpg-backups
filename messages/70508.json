Being an Autobot, he co=\r\nuldn&#39;t resist the urge to help someone in need.  He kneels down, yet cautio=\r\nusly looks around before doing anything, and also remembering that it was n=\r\not wise to move an injured person, especially if they had any unknown fract=\r\nures.  His Sonar equipment scans the figure for fractures and injuries.  \n\n=\r\n&quot;Hmmm...  Strange..  I better stay with this person to see if I get any sig=\r\nns of life.&quot;  \n\nHe rides the rail car, never leaving the figure&#39;s side.\n\n--=\r\n- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson knew that heading right into them would only put hi=\r\nm in the same vunlerable position as Rodimus. If he is going to rescue him =\r\nhe knew he had to be careful as to how to approach the situation. He looks =\r\nup at the rail car, and then to the insectile creatures with a calculating =\r\nexpression. He wasn&#39;t about to tell them what he was up to. And like a true=\r\n ninjabot, he crouches, builds up the energy in his legs, and then springs =\r\nup with kinetic force, to attempt to grab onto the rail car to get him at l=\r\neast away from the creatures to where he could plan his next move.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;Not on my watch.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is the only word wispered from Tucson&#39;s mouth.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The creatures move in Tuscon&#39;s direction with a surprising speed and\n&gt; =\r\nagility, their multiple legs giving them enhanced balance and\n&gt; stability. =\r\nHowever just as they were about to reach Tuscon and sink\n&gt; their long claws=\r\n into him he leaped into the air! Grabbing on one\n&gt; handhold and then anoth=\r\ner he leaped and swung and leaped again,\n&gt; quickly pulling and pushing hims=\r\nelf in the direction of the\n&gt; magnetically powered rail-car above his head.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; A glance below him shows Tuscon that the insect-spider like creatures=\r\n\n&gt; are making no attempt to follow him, but they are watching the car as\n&gt; =\r\nit travels.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the car it appears well maintained. it is as if who=\r\n ever lived\n&gt; and worked here had only left a few hours ago, everything abo=\r\nut it was\n&gt; still clean, working and completely serviceable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside th=\r\ne car Tuscon can see a figure laying on the floor apparently\n&gt; unconscious =\r\nshoved into a corner.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
