His hatch opens to let Wildrider out.\n\nDead-End and Drag Strip are both getting quite bored. They heard the \nalarm sound and had ignored it for lack of care, but now the are \ngetting curious. &quot;I dunno bout you, Dead-End, but this is boring...&quot; \nDead-End looks over at his annoying ally, &quot;I suppose that doing \nnothing would always get annoying eventually, but yes. Why don&#39;t we \ncheck out the alarm that sounded a little while ago.&quot; Drag Strip nods. \nBoth bots get up and head towards the room that is holding \nMotormaster, and Slaughter. As they enter their eyes widden, and Drag \nStrip queries immediately, &quot;Motormaster, why aren&#39;t you killing the \nintruder?&quot; Dead-End thinks to himself, &lt;&lt;Maybe our surly leader has \nbecome a stupid wimp as of late?
