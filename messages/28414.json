He looked to \nhis master \n&gt; and lord, Unicron.  &quot;Orders, Chaos-Bringer?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The age-old being looked to all his fellow Brotherhood members and \ngave a \n&gt; slight smile.  &quot;Now, we crush these heathens who dare invade our \nterritory.  \n&gt; They dare attack our base and besmearch us by doing so.  And by \ndoing so, \n&gt; they attack me.  No one attacks me.  Kill all the heathens, take no \n&gt; prisoners, use any means necessary!&quot; he yelled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement raised both arms, each arms launching two energy-signature \nseeking \n&gt; missiles.  Two of those missiles headed for Darkfate.  The other \ntwo of the \n&gt; same type headed for Dragonfly.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron raised both arms, an orb of black energy forming in his \nleft hand and \n&gt; dropping downward towards Attilla, the orb having the power of a \nfew charges.\n&gt; \n&gt; Raising his right arm he launched two energy-signature seeking \nmissiles at \n&gt; Ocipite.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher raised an arm, launching a seeking missile at one of \nthe bat \n&gt; probes, firing five optic blasts at another.  In his left hand a \nmissile \n&gt; launcher from subspace appeared.  The Brotherhood warrior moved \nthat arm to \n&gt; the right, pulling the large trigger of the weapon twice, a missile \nheading \n&gt; for Shivah and another missile heading for Kali.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector smiled and waited until after his allies had fired and \nraised a \n&gt; double-barreled cannon attached to his right wrist, firing off a \nmissile from \n&gt; each of the barrels.  One energy-signature seeking missile headed \nfor Alecto. \n&gt;  The other of the same type began a pursuit of a bat probe.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron activated a commlink with Darkfate and made a guttural \nnoise that a \n&gt; robot could not make. \n&gt; \n&gt;  &quot;Leave my territory or you shall die, your head resting on a pike \nas a \n&gt; reminder of what happens when you invade the Brotherhood&#39;s land and \ntry and \n&gt; destroy their property!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
