Doing his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; bidd=\r\ning?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It was always known that despite his fierce=\r\n streak of independence&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; MAGMATRON was a Predacon at heart and =\r\nsome believed that he got his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; start among the DECEPTICON ranks=\r\n in the days long before the peace&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; accord working for the orig=\r\ninal MEGATRON.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He had definitely spent some time =\r\nworking with this MEGATRON, but that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; was long before the PREDA=\r\nCONS and MAXIMALS had actually come to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; EARTH itself.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Tuscon&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson inches just a little=\r\n bit closer to Drill Bit, with a heavy and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; serious stance.  As eac=\r\nh clawed foot touches the ground, dust kicks up just&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; from the mere=\r\n action of him putting them down.  Claws click against the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; surface=\r\n of the cave&#39;s floor, as a thwapping of his tail can be heard as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; s=\r\nlaps against the hard surface it was coming in contact with.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; The dragon growls.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You heard my comrade.  Identify =\r\nyourself.   Are you friend or foe?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Drillbit&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There was a quiet laugh from DRILL BIT, &quot;Your comrades have=\r\n bought our&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; assistance, for now.  The Maximals agreed for our assi=\r\nstance to rescue you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in return for a stasis pod and a sparked prot=\r\noform after this is over, sworn&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; on the Matrix.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nAn outright lie - DINOBOT had wanted it, but LEO PRIME had essentially beat=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; him down over it.  But right now, there were seeds of chaos to so=\r\nw for DRILL&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; BIT as the MAXIMALS would probably be rushing down the=\r\n tunnel in a swarm&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; then. A ll teh while to try and stir up some ch=\r\naos when hte two groups&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &#39;met&#39;.  &quot;And we are here to rescue you all=\r\n.
