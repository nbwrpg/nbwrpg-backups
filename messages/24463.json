HOW COULD YOU JUST LEAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS!?!?!?! ARGH!!!!!\n\n    Nighteyes moved her head to the right, and felt a quick sarp pain as the \nshot hit the tree. Thank goodness fro her agility. She got up and began to \nsprint to cover, when Aerostreak slammed in to her.\n    &quot;Alright, come on, I think we can even the odds now.&quot; She said, and both \ncrept behinde a large fallen Red Wood. &quot;Theres a strange bot here too, I dont \nhave a clue who she is though.&quot;\n    Aerostreak aimed for Dollen, Nighteyes aimed for Drillbit, and both fired.\n\n    Akron aimed her riffle at Dollen, and fired a threesome of energon \nblasts. She cursed as he kept moving, but then she sw Darkmouse. She cocked \nthe riffle in her direction and blasted.\n(Sorry Yan if I keep taking crappy shots at you while your not here, I know \nhow fustrating that is.)\n\n    Marine, Pheniox, and Jackle arrived at the Ice Caves. badly damaged, Hell \nBeast barely reconized them. &quot;Get to the CR chambers. In the meantime \nTarantulas and Tankkor go and help Nighteyes and Aerostreak. His signiture is \nin combat with Killfests group according the the map. Hussle!&quot; He said, and \ncoughed once more with the weakening virus.\n\n"}}
