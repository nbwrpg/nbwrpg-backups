Beeline!&quot; Double Punch yelled, firing off his cyberbee, Beeline.  \n\nThe cyberbee got to an altitude where the Cybertronian Fire&#39;s defenses \ncouldn&#39;t shoot it and scanners couldn&#39;t pick it up.  It started going around \nat different angles, taping the ship and taking &#39;snap shots&#39; that were being \nfed to Double Punch, which were rerouted to Hell Beast&#39;s ship.\n\n&lt;Hell Beast, it&#39;s Double Punch.  Incoming info on the base.  There are \nseveral Maximals coming to investigate.  We should hit hard&gt;\n\n(Basically, from the stats of this craft, Hell Beast now knows the visible \nweapons, like lasers, autoguns, ion cannons, and missile launchers)\n\n===\n\nScattershot and Nemesis Enforcer, rifles ready, stood guard in front of Iron \nRaptor and Tavatron.  (Are they caged, or what?  How are they being held \ncaptive?)\n\n----\n\nThe Oblitercons approached Zardus. \n\n&quot;Where may we find our payment?&quot; Dark One asked.\n\n===\n\nChordate slowly entered the bridge of the Cybertronian Fire, seeing his \ncommander Kluster.  &quot;Kluster, sir, how many of us are left?&quot; he asked, \ngetting to a computer console and checking up on systems.\n\n"}}
