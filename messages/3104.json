If this new &#39;bot was indeed a female, as she already suspected, then transforming would give her away. Tavatron kept her eyes locked on Cyber Claw, not wanting her to attempt escape, though it was nearly impossible with both herself and Dinobot blocking the doorway.\n\nTavatron took a few steps towards the closed door, doing her best to block it, and making sure it remained closed. Tavatron held no malice toward Cyber Claw, but she didn&#39;t want her to run. The door was the only exit Tavatron could locate besides the air-vent, and she didn&#39;t think a raptor the size of Cyber Claw could squeeze through that:\n\n&quot;Yes, that should put an end to this dispute.&quot; \n\nTavatron kept one hand at her waist, hovering just above her sword. The &#39;bot&#39;s cover was about to be blown, and Tavatron wasn&#39;t sure of how Cyber Claw would react, but she didn&#39;t seem like the type to take things lying down.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
