Using a drone for one task occasionally (the base thing) is\n&gt; allright, but sending them out all the time is not. Please use real bots\n&gt; from now on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, I&#39;l be using this email for most things from now on, so if you need\n&gt; to contact me, please send email to Zardus@...\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Havoc/Repressor::\n&gt;\n&gt; Havoc looks over at the scanners in the engine room, seeing that a new pod\n&gt; had fallen in europe. He looks to the other members of his group that were\n&gt; there.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lets go check this out. Zardus would probably be pleased if we get a new\n&gt; bot.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Repressor nods, following Havoc out the door and looking back to see if\n&gt; Demolition was coming.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, 30 Apr 2001, James T wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Magmatron:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      His scanners picked up a new stasis pod entering\n&gt; &gt; the atmosphere, it was over Europe.
