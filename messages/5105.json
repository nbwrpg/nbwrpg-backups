What now?&quot; \n\nTavatron fired off several more shots before reaching behind her\nback, \nas if to grab her staff. She growls, remembering that she had left\nher \nstaff somewhere on the battlefield. She turns to face Zardus,\nsnarling \nthreateningly. She charges the Alliance leader, her optics glowing a \nbright blue, as if she was about to fire an optic blast. She raises \nher sword above her head and brings it down and across Zardus&#39; chest.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
