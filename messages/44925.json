I know you want this plot to work, but It just \n&gt; can&#39;t. It&#39;s just like saying Mustex knows about Veratis when they \nhave \n&gt; not actually met in the RPG. The basic story of a rebelling faction \n&gt; sending a member to Earth was good, but you can not say \n&gt; Techno-organics were on cybertron because it is not the Cybertron \nthat \n&gt; has been going on. Beast Machines never happened. This means that \nthe \n&gt; Maximals safely arrived on Cybertron, took Megatron to a trial or \n&gt; something, and, in some way, he went back to Earth. That&#39;s it. BM \n&gt; never happened because if it did, Megatron never could have had went \n&gt; back to Earth, he would have been a part of Cybertron. It&#39;s hard, \nbut \n&gt; you&#39;ll have to deal with it.\n\n\n"}}
