Then, the portal warped in a strange alien building!  The buildin=\r\ng resembled a pyramid sort of, with a strange blue crystal at the top.  At =\r\neach corner, there were long pole-like things sticking up.  Then, several o=\r\nther smaller blue portals appeared, and each one warped in.....Alien creatu=\r\nres!  But alien creatures didn&#39;t seem like the right word(s) for these.....=\r\nPeople.  Yes, a people.  Not a human people, but an extra-terrestrial peopl=\r\ne.  Two of them were wearing some bandana-thing over their mouths, and each=\r\n had a sort of cape on.  And, strangely, these peeps were permanently cloak=\r\ned(invisible).  They had strange blades too.  \n\n        Two of the other wa=\r\nrriors, well, they looked like warriors anyway, wore strange-but-cool armou=\r\nr, and on their back-hands they had little gadgets which, when activated, e=\r\nmitted little blades made out of a blue lazer material.  \n\n        The next=\r\n two people that arrived were also strange.  They wore strange armour, but =\r\nit wasn&#39;t combat armour.  You couldn&#39;t see their faces, all you could see w=\r\nas blackness and then two red, glowing dots, their eyes.  They looked like =\r\nmagic-users, or priests or something that represented mysticism, religion o=\r\nr sorcery.\n\n        Finally, the last two....people....were warped in.  The=\r\nse didn&#39;t look like the others!  They looked more mechanical than biologica=\r\nl.  The had four legs, two at each end, robotic legs.  At the top they had =\r\nrobotic armour and shit.  \n\n        But, it wasn&#39;t the end of the warping! =\r\n Two, much larger, blue portals appeared....In the sky!

The two ships flew out of =\r\nthe warping portal, then they hovered high in the air, casting an immense s=\r\nhadow over the building and the people.
