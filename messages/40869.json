She cut one in half as it was jumping down \non her, and fired 25 times her dustfire, causing another one to erode and \nfall down. She was in the rage of the battle. She could live all of her life \nin that state. She went back to her lioness mode and went for the simulated \njugular of some more vine-fighters. She couldn&#39;t believe what her brother \nhad done. He had brought the key to vector sigma, the one thing that could \nerase organic and techno-organic life and had reformatted an entire \ncontinent. And one of the first thing she learned, Daemos had went off to \nmercenary life and he engaged in a gladiator league. A sad note passed on \nher face, but it quickly disappeared as she doubled her ferocity against her \nvegetal oponents. She would be finished soon enough anyways, so why waste \ntime thinking?\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
