Super-powerful characters are illegal in this RPG. Meaning the TM3 driver \ncan power you up, but it cannot make you super-powerful.\n\n::Mosquitor::\n\nAs the alarm sounds in the predacon base, Mosquitor flies into the room, gun \nready.\n\n&quot;DIE INVADER!!!&quot; He yells as he fires on Voluis.\n\n"}}
