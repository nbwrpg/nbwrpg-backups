She was \ntrapped under the rubble from the maximal base. She couldn&#39;t move and \nher air for her systems was getting thin. She started pounding on \nparts of the collapsed ceiling, She yelled and screamed. Then she \nheard a voice on her commlink. It was megatron. &quot;You served me well \nKitKat, but you will be remembered as dying well in battle. Farwell \nKitKat.&quot;  and the link went dead.  She screamed and pounded on the \nceiling. &quot;YOU SLAGGING PIECES OF RUSTED SCRAP METAL, HOW DARE YOU \nLEAVE ME TO DIE DOWN HERE, I&#39;LL COME BACK AND KILL YOU SO HELP ME I \nWILL!&quot;\n\nHer words could be heard outside the chamber as she kicked and \nscreamed. \n\nShe pounded her fist againt the wall of the chamber, when the ringing \nof the metal being pounded woke her up. She looked around to see \nherself in a cr chamber. She relaxed and wondered how she ended up \nhere.  She gently knocked from the inside of the chamber. &quot;Hello? \nanyone out there? Can I get out now?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
