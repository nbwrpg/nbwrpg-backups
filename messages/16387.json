He took off \n&gt; into the sky as Prebon and Hammer walked back to the base.

You know, before we left for the moo, I shook hands with \n&gt; Striker and told him I&#39;d see him again if I made it. He assured me \nI \n&gt; would. Now he&#39;s the one who isn&#39;t going to make it. I say we show \nup \n&gt; at the quadrant, but WE show up and toast that guy!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Easy Brix. You&#39;re letting Bronco get to you. It&#39;s Ramulus&#39; \ndecision. \n&gt; What are we going to do?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
