She&#39;ll try to fight when the sedative wears off. Once the \nhell at the Pred base is done, we can work on bringing her back. \nYggdrasil has the programing he took from you though, so we&#39;ll need \nhim, or his computer.\n\nKup transformes and the two Autobots take Blackstorm to a CR, placing \nher inside, and activating security measures.

I still have a score to settle with \nHydras, Flicker, Maxima and all the others that had a hand in doing \nwhat they did to Nightlight.\n\nThe two exit the base, transform, and head for the Predacon base.\n\n\n"}}
