That would be a problem for the \n&gt; techbots not him, and the problem at hand had to be discussed first.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I understand your precautions, I&#39;d probably do no less if the \n&gt; situation were reversed.&quot; He knew better though. if the situation \n&gt; were reversed a predicon would have blown them to bits by now and \n&gt; taken the information. The spider was glad that the Maximals were \n&gt; diplomatic creatures.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If at all possible I would like you&#39;re science officer, your \n&gt; tactical officer, and every available Maximal leader in on our \n&gt; conference.\n&gt; \n&gt; (If your answers yes then arrange temporary quarters for Phobia \n&gt; somewhere, if you don&#39;t trust him then I&#39;m sure you have room in \nthe \n&gt; brig until the meeting.)\n&gt; \n&gt; (If your answers no then)&quot;Do you at least have someone available \nwith \n&gt; knowledge of temporal physics?&quot; Phobia asks, confident that the \n&gt; question just stumped Kluster. &quot;We will need them present, I&#39;m not \n&gt; all that great with history.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
