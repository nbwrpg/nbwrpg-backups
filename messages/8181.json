That won&#39;t be for long.&quot;  She walked tot he \nentrance of the base with her sachel on her arm and transformed into \nowl mode.  She had the sachel strap over her shoulder and the sachel \nunder her wing.  She flew off following his signal. &quot;Yo, fuzz face, \nI&#39;ll be there in two shakes of a squirrels tail.&quot; she beat her wings \nhard to catch up to him.  He did have a good head start.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; The sun began to rise over Tibet as it&#39;s beams of light reflected \n&gt; gold off the damsged hull of the Ark warmth covered a wolf sleeping \n&gt; behind a sheet of broken off metal. yet another day in the life of \na \n&gt; transformer.\n&gt; \n&gt; The wolf rose stretching his legs, first his front, then his hind. \n&gt; His fur was ragged on the side he&#39;d slept on, but with one good \nshake \n&gt; he smoothed out his grey and white coat.\n&gt; \n&gt; He knew Shadow Wing would be looking for him, unless she&#39;d \nforfitted \n&gt; thier sparring match. After the argument about his eyes he didn&#39;t \n&gt; know if she&#39;d show. Unless she came out with guns blazing trying to \n&gt; cripple him so Stegotron could work his voodoo (That he do so \n&gt; well.)  &quot;Well time to get started&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lunarpine to whoever, I&#39;m going scouting to the north. I&#39;ll be \nback \n&gt; later.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He knew that whoever was working the scanners would report his \n&gt; departure in the log book. If she was smart, he knew she was, she&#39;d \n&gt; check the scanners and logbook to see where he was going, and try \nto \n&gt; head him off.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Give Shadow Wing a message for me, tell her she&#39;s IT.&quot; He figured \n&gt; she&#39;d know what IT meant\n\n\n"}}
