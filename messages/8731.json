She was getting sick of this, to\nsick to even care that the Alliance had turned their weapons towards her.\n&gt; She looked up and glared at Reptilica as he aimed his weapon at Prowls\nhead, silently coming up beside him and simply pushing his weapon so that it\npointed towards the floor.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re in no position to make threats here, Reptilica. We&#39;re the ones\nwith the explosives in your engin room. So don&#39;t push it!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *She continued to glare at him with no fear in her spark, too pissed off\nto feel any in the first place.\n&gt; Then looking back at Prowl she opened her com-link, a growl in her thoat\nand a look on her face that even Megatron wouldn&#39;t want to deal with her.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; ENOUGH OF THIS! All of you, get your skid-plates back to base! NOW!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Her expression was deep in concintration and anger, the thought of her\nown Maximals disobaying an order only making the situation worse.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll expect to see each and every one of you in the Conferance Room when\nwe get back! Iron Raptor...out!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then looked over at Prowl with the same determined and angered\nexpression, yet not aiming it at him. Deactivating her com-link she sighed\ndeeply.\n&gt; But then her expression sofened a bit, knowing that now their lives\ndepended on the fact that Arcangle and the rest followed HER command.\n&gt; Now, they had to wait and see.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
