Koj suddenly picks up the pace starts \nto play the guitar. &quot;Can&#39;t you see that I am a pioneer unlocking the \ngreatest mysteries my key is a fearless heart so pure and strong. People \nlaugh when you are a pioneer not walking the straight and narrow they tell \nyou way things are they swear your wrong.&quot; As Koj does this he picks up his \nguitar speed causeing the hull of the Cf to shake as the music echos through \nout all the halls and even onto the bridge.\n\n\n::Lilly::\n&quot;Because you cannot be a hero hiding underneath your bed. You got to live \nthe life you create inside your head.&quot; As a beautiful female voice rangs \nout.&quot;So I opened window caught wind one night and now I sail with the birds \nin the sky.\n\n::Koj::\n&quot;If your tired of everything come here to take a ride with me you&#39;ll cry out \nwith joy when you realize your dreams its a trip like no other for your \nheart and mind leaving all but the future far behind.&quot; Koj contines to play \nthe guitar and starts to up the speed and the sound gets better.\n\n::Lilly::\n&quot;But Koj sometimes I think I&#39;m safer here?&quot;\n\n::Koj::\n&quot;Never mind that be a pioneer. O Lilly can&#39;t you see that you are a pioneer \nnot one of the endless talkers who tell you the same old rules you&#39;ve heard \nbefore you are a pioneer the same as me.&quot; Koj gives it all he&#39;s got and goes \nall out for one more solo.\n\n::Lilly::\n&quot;Hand in hand we will journey as pioneers an won&#39;t listen those who say that \nwe are wrong.We will be Pioneers forever more&quot;\n\n::Both Koj & Lilly::\n&quot;Some will say we are saver here. Nevermind them we are pioneers. &quot;O&quot;  \nThrough the ages we will be Pioneers. We go on a secret mission hand in hand \nwe will travel to the stars and far beyond. We will be pioneers forever \nmore.&quot; As Koj comes to a stop and smiles. ((Thank you Thank you and people \nsay maximals never have fun.
