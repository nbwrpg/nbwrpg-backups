If you want to control them, I do not \n&gt; mi=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt; their appearance.) )\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lord Elder&#39;s commands were carried ou=\r\nt by the station and the \nguns \n&gt; &gt; erupted into the air with a deadly symp=\r\nhony of wreckage! \nFirepower \n&gt; &gt; ripped into the invaders as first the shu=\r\nttle&#39;s batteries and \nthen \n&gt; &gt; the Ark violently pulled sweeps from the sk=\r\nies! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However much like the last battle the sweeps dispersed, maki=\r\nng \nthem \n&gt; &gt; much harder to hit. Using their agility and speed they turned=\r\n in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; air, spinning as the weapons continued to pepper the skies =\r\nwith \n&gt; &gt; bullets and energy!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Legacy for his part pulled back, usi=\r\nng the Ark as an additional \n&gt; &gt; defence as he laid into the oncoming sweep=\r\ns. Much like Lord \nElder&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; attack, it was effective but the sweep disp=\r\neresed, leaving him to \n&gt; &gt; pick one or two out of the air at a time rather=\r\n then destroying \n&gt; many \n&gt; &gt; at a time. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Jhiaxus and Scorponok=\r\n, Grimlock and Hydras and Rodimus all \n&gt; &gt; approached from their different =\r\nvectors, they could all see the \n&gt; grim \n&gt; &gt; vista of the sweeps, and the n=\r\number of them was staggering. At \nthe \n&gt; &gt; center of all this Cyclonus floa=\r\nted a cold calm amidst the storm \nof \n&gt; &gt; sweeps that floated around him. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To those who had been at the battle above Atlantis the sight \n&gt; br=\r\nought \n&gt; &gt; a darker reality: Although there were not as many sweep here as =\r\n\n&gt; there \n&gt; &gt; were at Atlantis, with Cyclonus were several other minions: \n=\r\n&gt; Darkfate \n&gt; &gt; and Nightstrike as well as three others which were unknown =\r\n- A \n&gt; &gt; warning that this battle may prove to be far more dangerous then \n=\r\n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; one before.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Grimlock landed and attacked his breath =\r\nweapon attack proved \nto \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; effective, striking down several sweeps=\r\n and singed several others \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; they maneuvered out of his way. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; As Hydras approached from the rear his guns opening up on the \nrear \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; flank of the sweeps, they dispersed into the skies as several of \n&gt; them=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; were brought down and many more came in to take their places. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; As the sweeps coiled around, absorbing the attacks from the would-\n&gt; be =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; defenders, in unison they began to open fire on Ark and Legacy as \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n well as Grimlock and the defending shuttle!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At same time minions =\r\nwere receiving orders from Scourge who was \n&gt; &gt; himself floating into posit=\r\nion and was more then ready to prove \n&gt; &gt; himself, &quot;Tumult, Nightstrike and=\r\n Darkfate You are with me! We go \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; destroy the ark, and TAKE the M=\r\natrix!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The answer from Tumult was quick, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; as he powered=\r\n up his \n&gt; &gt; engines and maneuvered himself into position near the top of t=\r\nhe \n&gt; host.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Strangely the response for the approaching Decepticons=\r\n and \n&gt; Predicons \n&gt; &gt; was a bit different - Although the Sweeps avoided co=\r\nmbat, no \ncombat \n&gt; &gt; was initiated. Instead Hydras recieved a call: \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hydras&quot; Cyclonus&#39; calm voice crackled over the communication \nlines \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; in an ancient Unicronian code. &quot;You were once Galvatron, I can \nfeel \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; his essence within you, and I have felt it since you have \n&gt; approached. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I have given you and yours a stay of execution because of that \n&gt; &gt; an=\r\ncient connection between us. Approach no farther and live, \nleave \n&gt; &gt; and =\r\nyou will be rewarded when our work here is done.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; (Da&#39;=\r\nminion)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
