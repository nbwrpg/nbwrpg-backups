He knew all about the \nship. Hidden compatrments and hidden findings he did not know of before. Now \nall he had to do was wait for the upload to be complete. Now he knew that if \nMagmatron was a smart leader he would not show him all of the ships hidden \nsecrets until his demise. So he tried to search for a block of some kind. \nSuddenly a shock came through his body. Not much damage was done to him but \nit smarted. Suddenly he heard Magmatron&#39;s voice, &quot;Now you should have \nexpected a safe guard like this. Now complete your uplink and start your \nleadership.&quot;\n\n"}}
