Just great!\nIron Raptor rolled her eyes and slumped her shoulders, wondering if anything \nelse could happen that would be worse.\nJust then she recieved the transmission from Hysteria, reporting that the \nbase shields had just gone out and was now waiting for an order to take the \nship off of LockDown.\n&lt; I had to ask...&gt; was her only thoughts.\nBut if the larger bots came around they could start trouble with the \nAlliance again and with the CF like it was, there was slim chance that they \ncould survive it.\nHer eyes darted for a moment to Snow Tech as he plopped down beside her, \nseeing that he must be out of breath. But a lot had happened that day and \neveryone was bone tired, but since all they did for the past half hour was \nstand there they had just enough time.\nRepairs came next.\nIron Raptor only nodded towards Shadow Cat and opened a communication link \nto Hysteria.*\n\n&quot; Deactivate LockDown, we&#39;ll be in shortly.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor looked down at the tiny little kitten and a small smile \ndeveloped on her lips, stroking a hand over his back again before she felt \nhis tiny little claws dig into her arm.\nShe flinched for a moment but took the slight prick of pain, it wasn&#39;t \nanything worth fussing about.\nLooking over towards Prowl she noticed a guest, one of the musicle bots \nwhich had communicated with them earlier?\nWith her expression lighthearted she nodded, looking past them all and to \nthe battlefield for a moment before focusing on them again.*\n\n&quot; The more Maximals the better.&quot;\n\n* This had been a long day and Iron Raptor felt her muscles relax as she \ncontinued to pet the kitten in her arms, letting out a sigh.\nIt was time to repair and take some relief time, for all of them. But not \nher, she had to get to work on the base, as well as changing the codes to \nthe CF to a more proper design.\nMaybe post a few auto-guns at a 5oo meter radiouse to the ship, something to \nback up the troops while in combat. Plus, maybe, a few more weapons to the \nship itself.\nEven with the battle over it was still going to be a long day.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
