She \ncame up upon the bridge. She stood in the doorway and looked around. \nJust in case someone asked, she was lost. That story would work since \nshe was new to the ship anyway. She would deffinately have to ask for \na tour of the ship.  She took a step inside the bridge and leaned \nagainst the wall.  She swayed her tail around and looked around, \ntaking in the sights.  She purred and smiled. This may be and easy \nassignment after all. \n\nShe thought of Skulletron. She hoped he was having fun where ever he \nwas.\n\n\n"}}
