They\nwon&#39;t leave Cybertron, promise!\n\nOn the surface, a couple of meters higher, the patrol tech noticed\nsomething on the instruments.\n\nGesper: Sir, I have a reading. This looks like a non-repertoriated\nenergy signature, but it seems to be vaguely techno-nanitite... It&#39;s\nweird in any cases.\n\nBelthassan, the huge polar bear stopped and looked back at the monkey.\nHe took a few steps forward and frowned. He thought they had taken out\nall resistance, but for a techno-nanitite reading, it had to be\nanother Tripredacus.\n\nBelthassan: Can you confirm affiliation?\n\nGesper: No, it&#39;s too archaic. It doesn&#39;t even recognize it. The only\nthing I have is a spark signature.\n\nBelthassan: We&#39;ll go check. Where is it?\n\nGesper: It&#39;s down, in the underground.\n\nBelthassan: Old Iacon City... Could it be? Melchana, find a shaft and\nstart scouting. We&#39;re right behind you.\n\nMelchana transformed and let shine her armblades.\n\nMelchana: With pleasure! And yes, I&#39;ll wait your order before I engage.\n\nShe jumped in the nearest waste shaft and looked around. Silent, she\nlistened to the noises.\n\nMelchana: Bel, I think I hear a voice...\n\nBelthassan: Got it. Move out as silently as possible. HQ is warned. We\nare to terminate it if it&#39;s hostile, but not before.\n\nMelchana: Roger.\n\nShe advanced and descended lower. At the end of the pipe, she came in\na large vault-like place. She saw a ledge and jumped on it, but her\nclawed feet made a scraping sound that echoed all around. Mentally,\nshe swore and her hunter instincts kicked in. The lioness had to find\nher prey now!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt; Light was seen as she neared the end of a shaft. Padding along at a\ndecent \n&gt; pace. \n&gt; \n&gt; At the opening of the shaft, glancing about outside to see a very\ndifferent \n&gt; Cyberton that what she was used to.. from what she remembered. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No,&quot; she whispered. A pain in her voice. It wasn&#39;t that familiar \n&gt; metallic/robotic voice that was so familiar to her, but such a plain, \n&gt; ordinary organic like voice. \n&gt; \n&gt; A curiousity sprung up within her. She wanted to see if any part of\nCybertron \n&gt; remained as it was. Or was it all a mix of this organic & cybernetic? \n&gt; \n&gt; ******************************\n&gt; \n&gt; Padding along in the shadows & alleys, much like Ravage once did.\nHer optics \n&gt; glanced about, taking in this new Cybertron, much to her grief &\ndistaste. \n&gt; \n&gt; It pained her. & surely enough, it would have pained any Decepticon.\nEven \n&gt; worse, she was disgraced for being reformated into this organic like\nbody. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sad & lonely, for the first time in her existance, her thoughts went\nto her \n&gt; past. Thinking about the days of the Great War, the Decepticons. The\nbattles \n&gt; with the Autobots, Cybertron as it once was. Energon. Her rivals with \n&gt; Elita-1. \n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron. She felt so ashamed. If he were functioning & standing\nbefore her, \n&gt; she would beg him to either return her to her former body or help\nher to \n&gt; permenantly cease to function.  \n&gt; \n&gt; As she moved through the alleys & shadows of the streets of Cybertron, \n&gt; Megatron&#39;s faceplate remained the dominant figure in her mind. If\nshe could \n&gt; see him again, she would be reassured.\n\n\n"}}
