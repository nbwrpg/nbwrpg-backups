I can send you the\nlocation and perhaps it can be physically investigated?&quot;\n\nAll around the Predacons the number of birds in the air were\nincreasing, their calls echoing on the winds.\n\nCYCLONUS looked at HYDRAS, &quot;Sir, short of burning down the whole\nplace, do you have any suggestions as to how we are to get rid of all\nthese beasts?&quot; There was the definite look of distaste in CYCLONUS&#39;\nface as he looked around. As far as anyone could see there were dead\ndinosaurs of all sorts.\n\nMercifully the sun was beginning to set around them, which of course\nmeant that the nighttime scavengers were beginning to make themselves\nheard as well as the sounds of ancient breeds of canines could be\nheard howling in the distance as and glowing eyes could be seen even\ncloser.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
