The Infecticon test was meant\n&gt;to be a pass or fail thing. If you fail you die. It was established\n&gt;before the bet was made between the two. Darkfate and Airly had the\n&gt;choice to decline, but they didnt. I was actually expecting\n&gt;Blacknightmare to pass anyways. But she failed the test and that\n&gt;price is death. Also, how can she get out of the situation if you\n&gt;mind my asking? Shes under water in a very large facility. The only\n&gt;transport on and off can be activated by the main computer which can\n&gt;only be activated by the infecticon signature and brain waves. Not to\n&gt;mention the facility is heavily armed and can be sealed off to\n&gt;prevent escape.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Azure The Warrior&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Well there&#39;s something else.
