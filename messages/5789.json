It&#39;s in case someone gets ambitious\nwhile they think the crew is distarcted with your\npresence. I just had every compartment sealed leading\nbelow decks.&quot;\n\n &quot; Will that stop them?&quot; Megatron asked.\n\n  &quot;Of course,&quot; Panzertron said,&quot; Every door is locked\nwith a duracypertrioum lock. It&#39;s unhackable with out\nsetting off the ship&#39;s alarms. Each door is a meter\nthick, so they won&#39;t blast through them.&quot;\n\n  Megatron nodded,&quot; Seems you like precaution.&quot;\n\n  &quot;More then you know,&quot; Panzertron said. He waved his\nhand around thie bridge,&quot; This ship is secure against\nanything, given time. Anyone attacking will have only\nminicylces to make sure it works before the ship\ndefenses kick in. Unless of course the oppoents of\nthis world are very creative.&quot;\n\n  &quot;Don&#39;t be over confident,&quot; Megatron said,&quot; The\nopponets of this world are creative.&quot;\n\n\n-OOC- Panzertron is boasting about his ship. Like the\n&quot;Super-battleships&quot; of WW2 the Iron Fist isn&#39;t\nperfect.-\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
