For a second \nhe was lost in her beauty, his spark beating with his love for her. \nBut after she walked through the CF&#39;s hatch and it closed behind her, \nProwl&#39;s mind slowly got back on track, focusing on the orders.\n\n&quot;Epyon,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;Iron Raptor wants to know if you \ncould meet her at the CF&#39;s control room right now.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor closes in on the CF after walking for a bit with \nProwl in her \n&gt; arms, nodding before and watching Fliq scurry off towards the cr \nchambers a \n&gt; while ago.\n&gt; But she stops once Prowl lifts his weight from her shoulders, \nreluctantly \n&gt; letting go of him as he receives a transmission from Epyon.\n&gt; She missed how close they use to be and feeling his against her, \neven though \n&gt; he had been weak, had made her feel good. Just to be close like \nthat.\n&gt; &lt; Any time. &gt;\n&gt; She continues quietly towards the CF doors, leaving Prowl to take \ncare of \n&gt; whatever business he had with Epyon before she received the \nthoughts from \n&gt; Prowl just before reaching the doors.\n&gt; So, two members of his crew were missing, and he was starting to \nmake plans \n&gt; to dismantle his ship. It must be for that idea that Prowl had \nbefore after \n&gt; the first battle that they got back from.\n&gt; &lt; I&#39;ll take care of it. &gt;\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked over her shoulder at Mantle and his crew. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Mantle, please select 3 members of your crew and prep them for \npossible \n&gt; departure.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then turned to face the doors of the CF again and passed \nthrough them \n&gt; as they opened for her.\n&gt; &lt; Prowl, contact Epyon and tell him to join me here in the control \nroom. I \n&gt; want to understand what&#39;s going on before I send any of my soldiers \nout. &gt; ( \n&gt; she doesn&#39;t know Epyon&#39;s busy helping angel prime.)\n&gt; Iron Raptor opened a com channel to Histeria. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Histeria, I need a Maximal wide announcement for all of the \nfaction to \n&gt; either remain or return to base.  There&#39;s going to be a few things \ngoing on \n&gt; here and it involves everyone.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And from there Iron Raptor disappeared into the shadows of the \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire, her bulky armor making a siolette against the \nlight of \n&gt; distant rooms. A figure which was not to be reckoned with. *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
