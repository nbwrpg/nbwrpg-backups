Black Arachnia was gone, and Megatron and \nTarantsulas were left, two bots who he knew that would kill him if \nthey knew about his damage. He made sure he was out of their sights. \nHe transformed to beast mode and skittered off to a spot at the side \nof the cave that had a nice hidding spot. He crawled under it, with a \nlayer of rock over top of it, so it was low enough that his flat body \ncould fit through it. He curled around to the front and hunkered \ndown.  \n\n\n"}}
