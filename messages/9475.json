He calmed down a little. He looked at \nDark Mouse.\n\n&quot;Who is coming?&quot; a voice asked. Quickstrike jolted, and nearly lost his \nbalanace. It was Megatron&#39;s voice. He hated it when he came out of no where \nwanting to know what was going on. Quickstrike had some things to hide a \nwhile ago.\n\nMegatron came to Dark Mouse&#39;s side and looked at them both in beast mode. He \nlowered his head to their level. Quickstrike lowered his head, a little \nunsteady on his legs.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
