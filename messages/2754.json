A natural barricade, protecting both sides from each other, thus stopping the battle and from anyone getting hurt any further.\nShe  felt the last shots hit her sides but she really didn&#39;t care, the roar from her mouth said that there was to be no more fighting.*\n\n&quot; ENOUGH!!!&quot;\n\n* With that said she then turned her massive head towards Ramhorn, not a mean or misunderstanding expression on her face. Then turning her head towards Dracona and Plintissa with the same expression.*\n\n&quot; We&#39;re going to discuss this situation without further interruption with weapons if it kills me! Now calm down before I have to slag all three of you!&quot;\n\n* With that she then looked back over at Ramhorn.*\n\n&quot; Now, what&#39;s all this I hear about Stinkbomb&#39;s murder?&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
