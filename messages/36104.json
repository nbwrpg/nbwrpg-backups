I don&#39;t watch enough TF, I guess.\n&gt; Impact you say.. wasn&#39;t Branding&#39;s weapon a flamethrower? I forgot\n&gt; about the extra weapon fire, how big is Arty? because Pacifix is\n&gt; standing in the entrance to the hideout, if Arty is bigger than 14\n&gt; feet, Pacifix isn&#39;t in too much danger of being hit by friendly fire, or\n&gt; flame. What I&#39;m trying to get at is Arty is acting as a shield for\n&gt; Pacifix.  =0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 31 May 2001, at 15:07, CYBERWOLF4 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; As for unrealistic, during the gulf war how did american and Saudi\n&gt; &gt; missles destroy Iraqui Scud missles? as soon as a hissle was fired\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s warhead would be active, virtually any impact would destroy it.\n&gt; &gt; (Optimal Optimus would have NEVER been able to deflect Rampages missle\n&gt; &gt; simply by useing his arm.) But the writers allowed it because it\n&gt; &gt; allowed them to destroy the Maximal ship so the Maximals wouldn&#39;t have\n&gt; &gt; to defend it and the Ark at the same time, a war on two fronts\n&gt; &gt; would&#39;ve weakened the Maximals and since they didn&#39;t really have a\n&gt; &gt; qualified leader for the second front they would&#39;ve lost the Beast\n&gt; &gt; Wars.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If anyone feels I abuse the rules then say so but since it&#39;s usually\n&gt; &gt; my characters that end up looking like the wrong end of a collision\n&gt; &gt; with a mack truck I personally don&#39;t feel I do. Blocking an attack\n&gt; &gt; should be legal as long as it doesn&#39;t end up being EVERY attack. She\n&gt; &gt; shot down two missles and an attack failed, logical solution- ATTACK\n&gt; &gt; AGAIN AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve already posted that Brandeds flamethrower can heat up like a\n&gt; &gt; blast furnace, for those of you who haven&#39;t worked industry that would\n&gt; &gt; be anywhere from 2000 to 5000 degrees  (Nothing compared to &quot;Advanced&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Transformer technology.)  depending on whats being melted (Science\n&gt; &gt; note for those interested) Brass has a melting point of 1800 degrees,\n&gt; &gt; copper slightly lower.(Softer metal requires lower temperature.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One last question- How is it that Arty and Pacifix are engaged in hand\n&gt; &gt; to hand combat but Pacifix isn&#39;t being hit by any of the weapons fire\n&gt; &gt; being used against Arty? We&#39;ve got Slags flames, Artemiss&#39; automatic\n&gt; &gt; weapons fire, and whatever other attacks come his way. It&#39;s three on\n&gt; &gt; one people, IM each other and get your attacks organized. By all\n&gt; &gt; rights Arty Should be toast. (Burnt toast if Slag keeps eatin\n&gt; &gt; Jabernero peppers.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: robertdahl &lt;rdahl@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, May 31, 2001 7:53 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: The bum and the hole...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Well I just need to ad my opinion, I think the rule of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interception is pretty useless, and poorly thought out. IMH it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much more interesting sometimes to intercept than to just dodge when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you think you dont want to accept dammage. And Jeff, in the show\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they did intercept, ussually missiles with gun fire, but sometimes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more powerful rays against each other. Megatron and Dinobots laser\n&gt; &gt; &gt; war from Double Dinobot comes to mind. In the original series, Slag\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even ignited a missile with his flame breath before it reached him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and I&#39;m not sure, but I think Inferno did it too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
