It&#39;s only a small fight, and \nbeating the Maximals is rather boring.&quot; Flesh Ripper said, his optics \nmagnifying what was before his eyes a couple of times.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s true, brethren.  But it&#39;s a small battle.  Not much resistance.  And \nwhat is our goal?&quot; Demon Wulf asked with a sick grin.\n\n&quot;To slaughter all Cybertronians.&quot; Dark Claw replied, showing his fangs.\n\n&quot;Exactly.&quot; Demon Wulf said, pointed a clawed finger towards the battle scene. \n &quot;We will attack, and kill.  We will choose one target at a time.&quot; \n\nAnd with that, the three Vok creations set off, Dark Claw transforming to his \nattack vehicle mode and the brothers headed at full speed towards the \nCybertronian Fire.\n\n"}}
