Foliage and underbrush\nmaking the passing difficult but not impossible.\n\nFollowing the signal that LEO PRIME had was taking them off any\nobservable path, although curiously it followed the trail that\napparently TUSCON and his captors had taken, at least judging by what\nBANTOR and TERRORGATOR were detecting with their tracking skills.\n\nEventually they came out over a small mountain pass, coming around\nwhere the trees opened up and for the first time a path could be seen\nagain leading down into more trees.\n\nLEO PRIME turned to wave at HYDRAS, showing him the tracker, the\nbeeping was getting more steady, they were getting close when suddenly\nit was blasted out of LEO&#39;s hand as laser fire opened up on them from\nthe now open air errupted all around the group!\n\nTrees were burned down, instantly incinerated by acid and\ndisintergration cannons, shrubbery vanished into nothingness! Up in\nthe air the massive form of CYCLONUS hovered in his space interceptor\nmode with sweeps and a few seekers flew around him like some sort of\nblack entorage.\n\n&quot;Surrender or die!&quot; CYCLONUS &#39; deep voice said from the air!\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
