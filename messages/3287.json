Gould&quot; &lt;black_panther_kitten@...&gt;\r\n\r\n \n* Shadow Cat and Snow Tech began to get annoyed. Is\nthis how they treat new-comers? They decided that the\nonly way to get in is to just walk strait in. Whether\nthey liked it or not. They picked up their cases and\nstepped cautiously out into the clearing, watching the\nauto-guns and praying they didn&#39;t mistake them for\npredacons. When the guns didn&#39;t turn on them they\nslowly inched there way towards the door. shadow Cat\nstopped close to the door, and, turning to Snow Tech\nsaid,*\n\n &quot; I think we should at least inform them we are\ncoming in, whether they ignore it or not, it wouldn&#39;t\nbe wise to surprise them, they could take it the wrong\nway.&quot;\n\n * Snow Tech nodded,*\n\n &quot; Yeah, this is the weirdest place I&#39;ve been on,\nPredacons begging to get in and all, i wonder what our\nfellow maximals are like?&quot;\n\n *Shadow Cat smirked at his shallow attempt to humor\nher. but he was right in a sense. it was unusual for\npredacons to beg, for anything. She nodded to him and\nhe switched on his com-link once more,*\n\n &quot; This is Shadow Cat and Snow Tech, we are entering\nyour base,(since you didn&#39;t reply the first time, He\ngrumbled and Shadow Cat smacked him) We ARE Maximals!\nI repeat We are maximals and are coming in!&quot;\n\n * and with that they stood strait and entered the\nmetallic door-way which held two possibilities, 1.\nDeath or 2. Iron Raptor.*\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Photos -- now, 100 FREE prints!\nhttp://photos.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
