Was this really the Carnage she had first met\n&gt; when she had come to this planet for her first time?\n&gt;\n&gt; A dagger of fear twisted itself in her gut. Carnage didn&#39;t want her\n&gt; as a friend? Well. She was going to say something to that!\n&gt;\n&gt; The Fuzor began to follow her again, from a few meters distance, but\n&gt; just enough to let Carnage know that she was still keeping up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You think I&#39;m not Loyal? That I can be Trusted?&quot; She seethed. &quot;What\n&gt; about in the time that we were here on Earth, the first time? Does\n&gt; that mean NOTHING to you? If I wasn&#39;t a friend, don&#39;t you think I\n&gt; would have joined the Maximals by now, instead of risking my life to\n&gt; come here! I sought you out, tried to apologize, note the word TRIED,\n&gt; and you shove me off like I&#39;m some dirt underneath your foot? That\n&gt; I&#39;m not even worth considering?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She took a couple of deep breaths, eyes wide with her anger. &quot;If you\n&gt; would learn to trust the right people, then you wouldn&#39;t be run all\n&gt; over! If I had of known you would be like this when I went away, then\n&gt; I never would have left! Back then, Carnage, you seemed like nothing\n&gt; could ever knock you down..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Teltoli&#39;s voice had quietened, and her ears drooped with sadness.\n&gt; &quot;You always seemed stronger than anyone I ever knew, even my Father.\n&gt; I looked up to you, and anyone that strong would have been able to\n&gt; cope&quot; She whispered, just loud enough.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry that you think you get run over, but that doesn&#39;t mean\n&gt; that I tried to trample all over you. I never did, and I never will&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Her anger had fizzeled out, for the most part. She never could stay\n&gt; angry at people, for long, anyway. Her next sentance had a tinge of\n&gt; anger in it, and her ears know lay flat against her head with\n&gt; annoyance.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;But fine, if you want to trample all over me in your haste to\n&gt; destroy what could be the re-start of a great friendship, go ahead..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
