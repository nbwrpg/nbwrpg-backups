The missles launched by Darkwing \nnarrowly missed his as he pulled a roll/dodge manuver to get out of the way. \n  With his manuverability it would be nearly impossible to hit Ragnus from \nhead on.  Luckly for the attackers they had another two missles that were \nclosing in unnoticed by the Dragon.  The missles were nearly at impact when \nRagnus had just got into biting range of Darkwing.\n\n  Rearing his head back he bit at Darkwing.  As he clamped his jaws shut \nboth of the other two missles slammed into him, sening shards of armor \neverywhere.\n\n&gt;Dreadwind and Darkwing saw the enormous dragon, as it flew out.\n&gt;The now two jets flew at the dragon, one on each side, letting loose\n&gt;a barrage of bullets and four missiles.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
