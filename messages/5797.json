I need to get away for a bit. All this \ninactivity&#39;s dulling my senses. I can see it in the other Maximals, \nthey&#39;ve lost thier edge on this planet. We were given these senses to \nadapt to this planet, not to colinize it.&quot; The thought of technology \nwinning out over nature sickened him. Maybe being one of this planets \nnatural creatures for a time distorted the yechnological side of him, \nmaybe not. Either way the Maximals were inadvertently doing what they \nset out to prevent.\n\n&quot;We need to stay sharp Wing, back at the Ark I smelled something, \neven the sensors didn&#39;t notice. Nobody noticed it except me. If our \nleaders rely on technology that much then we&#39;ll all end up looking \nlike the Ark. I for one wouldn&#39;t want that.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She didn&#39;t like feeing this way.  She knew that revenge was a \npredacon \n&gt; emotion and not one for a Maximal.  She tried to put it out of her \nmind, but \n&gt; she still thought about striking back at them for all the damage \nthat they \n&gt; caused.  She thought about all the good bots that they killed. This \nhas to \n&gt; stop somewhere, she thought.  She went to the entrance of the new \nbase.  She \n&gt; saw Lunarpine walking out.\n&gt; &quot;Where are you going?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
