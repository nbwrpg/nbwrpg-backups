He taps his hand, a panel coming up from his wrist, featuring \na small built in computer. As the weapon operator of the CF, his \nwrist comp was mainly designed to control the weapons, but it could \naccess the other features too. He was sure Hysteria would have a \nbetter one as the main tech bot, but maybe she didn&#39;t.\n\n&quot;From what I saw of the outside, the hull is in very bad condition. \nLets get the power running first.&quot;\n\nHe taps a few buttons. With a grinding sound of damaged gears, four \nlarge panels slid aside on the top of the Cybertronian Fire, and two \neven larger solar batteries were brought up. The lights on the bridge \nbecame slightly brighter as the solar batteries began to bring in \nenergy.\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; he says, walking to a console and looking at the \ndamage, &quot;Lets get working on the comps.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;FIRE FOX&quot; &lt;firefox_y2k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hysteria:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria sighed deeply before turning to face Firearm:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well, despite how it may look, with enough help and round the \nclock work we \n&gt; could be up and running in about two weeks. But I haven&#39;t been able \nto \n&gt; survey all the damage yet.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria turned back to face the console, and continued talking to \nFirearm \n&gt; as she pulled up a half completed image of the CF&#39;s internal \nstructure:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There&#39;re a lot of internal problems, cut wires, broken links, you \nname it. \n&gt; First, however, I suggest we get the power core up and running \nagain. It&#39;s \n&gt; barely hanging in there as it is. I&#39;m estimating about 45-55% \nshipwide \n&gt; damage. But that&#39;s a very crude estimate, given what I&#39;ve surveyed \nso far. \n&gt; For all we know the damage may not be as extensive as we think, \nthough I \n&gt; seriously doubt that.&quot;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
