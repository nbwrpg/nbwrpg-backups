He checked on the bot\nformerly known as Shadow Wing. Her chamber was never used. The wolfbot\nsensed trouble again. &quot;Where&#39;s the crazy bot gone off to now?&quot; with her past\ntrack record she&#39;d gone off to get herself in another situation that\nLunarpine would have to bail her out. Now though she was stronger, and could\nprobably handle herself a little better.\n\nVeratis&#39; Rejuvination chamber opened and the old bot once again arose from\nhis sleep. The chamber had been set to open when Lunarpine was healed.\nVeratis stretched his wings and rewrapped them around him. He appeared to be\nan old man in an old fashion dress cape that men wore to keep thier Sunday\nbest from getting dirty on the road in the 1700s. He returned to the lab and\nfound Lunarpine already studying the computer display. He took a moment to\nstudy the situation. &quot;Ice&quot; had stopped for a rest, then continued on. Drops\nof blood containing the virus lay on the ground where she had been. The open\nair hadn&#39;t killed it. It wouldn&#39;t be destroyed until it was seperated from\nthe blood. He set his cleanup drones to do a sweep of the area and clean it\nup before anything else was contaminated. He didn&#39;t know if normal organic\ncreatures could be infected but viruses had been known to mutate in the\npast. Ice was now a danger to the whole planet.\n\n&quot;Take this scanner and bring her back.&quot; Veratis wanted to save the planet\nfrom the destruction Trans life had caused, now he found he was protecting\nit from himself. &quot;Whatever you do don&#39;t shed any more of her blood.&quot; His\ninstructions were filled with a nervous fear.  Lunarpine took the scanner\nand proceeded to the exit. the only chance the planet had now was that the\nvirus be stopped before it reached warm weather.\n\nOutside the base Lunarpine transformed to full wolf mode and started after\nIce. The drones flew around him scrapeing up the droplets of blood that had\nseeped through her bandages. &quot;What have you gotten us into this time Wing?&quot;\nwere the wolfs thoughts as he chased after her. Her name was now Ice but\nshe&#39;d always be Shadow Wing to him.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, November 10, 2000 8:24 AM\nSubject: ICE\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She had been laying the snow, sleeping for some time. She was covered\n&gt; in new fallen snow. She lifted her head up and loked around. She saw\n&gt; that the landscape was totally white. She smiled and stood up. HEr\n&gt; shoulder was throbbing and still trickling blood. She looked down at\n&gt; where she was laying and saw a frozen puddle of red liquid in the\n&gt; snow. She shook off the rest of the snow off her body and started\n&gt; walking again. She headed north and just wakled along, in a calm\n&gt; manner, seeing what there was to see. She left a small trickle of\n&gt; blood in the snow as she walked, but would soon be coverd by the\n&gt; falling snow.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
