He talked to\n&gt; Epyon while \n&gt; &gt;   he walked.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &quot;This ship was a big experiment, but I think its very good. Hasn&#39;t\n&gt; failed us \n&gt; &gt;   yet.&quot; With that he entered the bridge and sat down at the\n&gt; commander&#39;s chair. \n&gt; &gt;   The bridge was a very big round room with computers all around,\n&gt; and the \n&gt; &gt;   commander&#39;s char was on a raised platform in the center, so that\n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt;   commander could oversee everything that was going on. There were\n&gt; reports of \n&gt; &gt;   security cameras and stanners and everything on the computer\n&gt; screens, some \n&gt; &gt;   even had computer games on them! Mantle tapped a few buttons and a\n&gt; 3d \n&gt; &gt;   hologram of a battle city, at least how Cyndro had designed it\n&gt; from what \n&gt; &gt;   Mantle and Epyon had been talking about when they entered the\n&gt; Element. &quot;How \n&gt; &gt;   does that look?&quot; Mantle asked Epyon. &quot;If its acceptable, we can\n&gt; begin \n&gt; &gt;   construction right away.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Even though missiles and laser shots were hitting the shields, the\n&gt; robots \n&gt; &gt;   inside probably couldn&#39;t tell that anything was different. The\n&gt; ship didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt;   shake, the lights didn&#39;t blink, and everything remained the same.\n&gt; Outside, \n&gt; &gt;   however, Cyndro focused his firepower on the attackers. Three\n&gt; missiles \n&gt; &gt;   launched out at Sixshot, and three at Ares, followed by alot of\n&gt; plasma shots \n&gt; &gt;   at both. He also fired four missiles at Imprisoner.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Mist watched Surgital being attacked, and didn&#39;t waste time. She\n&gt; aimed at \n&gt; &gt;   Surgital&#39;s head and fired two charges. Below her, Rubble fired two\n&gt; missiles \n&gt; &gt;   up at Surgital&#39;s butt :), while Aqua and Cinder decided to take\n&gt; down the \n&gt; &gt;   bots that Abominus just seperated into. They both turned around.\n&gt; Aqua fired \n&gt; &gt;   two spears at Hunger and Cinder fired three laser shots at\n&gt; Rippersnapper.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Cledar looked around the battlefield and noticed that there were\n&gt; alot of \n&gt; &gt;   injured Maximals. He made a mental note to talk to the commander\n&gt; of this \n&gt; &gt;   faction after the battle, and then decided to fire a few more\n&gt; times at \n&gt; &gt;   someone, and shot his fusion cannon up at Surgital. He was sure\n&gt; that the \n&gt; &gt;   huge beam of plasma would hit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   A large burst of flame was shot out of Forrior&#39;s tank bottom and\n&gt; sent him \n&gt; &gt;   flying up above the missile and the shots. He landed near Predator\n&gt; and fired \n&gt; &gt;   his fusion cannon at him almost form point-blank range.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Rixer jumped forward and avoided a missile coming at him, but\n&gt; several shots \n&gt; &gt;   still hit him in the side. He rolled under a bunch more shots and\n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt;   jumped up and fired a missile and twenty shots at Sun Crusher.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Truttle ducked under a shot from Predator and chuckled to himself.\n&gt; So far \n&gt; &gt;   these Predacons were very bad at fighting. He saw Reflector firing\n&gt; at Rixer, \n&gt; &gt;   aimed both of his machine guns, and sent fifty laser bolts out\n&gt; toward \n&gt; &gt;   Reflector.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   The missiles that Blyer fired earlier barely missed the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire, \n&gt; &gt;   and hit the ground harmlessly. Blyer aimed again, this time with\n&gt; laser \n&gt; &gt;   cannons, and fired twenty rapid laser shots from each of his wing\n&gt; cannons at \n&gt; &gt;   Firestarter.\n&gt; &gt;   _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt;   Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
