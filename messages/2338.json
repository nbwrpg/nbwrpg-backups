He stumbles back, \nmech fluid stilling on the floor. Firing off a few shots at Prowl from his \npistol, he launches himself into the air, flying at Iron Raptor, firing his \ngun rapidly.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKiller yells in pain as teeth dig into his torso, very nearly ripping him in \ntwo pieces. His fist closes over his launcher, bending the trigger into a \nfiring position. The launcher falls to the ground, firing at everything in \nfront of it (Iron Raptor, Killer, etc...).\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl stumbles back as Annihilator&#39;s shots hit him, denting his chest plate \nand stomach. He growls and jumps into the air, heading for Annihilator.\n\n"}}
