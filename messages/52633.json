A searing burn ran \nacross his arm, but he managed to twist enough to fire his Gauss at \nFury. The slug went straight at the knife, which would break \ninevitably, and past it at Fury.\n\nThe blond Clansman looked at his limb and saw it in a bloddy metallic \nmess. Adrenaline was still high, but he would not last.\n\nKatya saw a breach and fired between the tentacles.\n\nBlackfang leaped back and out of most of the tentacles way. However, \nhis shotgun was taken out of his grip. He drew his pulse laser and \nfired small quick shots as near as he could to the gash.\n\nBlackfang: Why the hell are you doing this then? You&#39;re on our side!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Riekan takes the hit, all right, but he&#39;s sturdy enough to maintain \n&gt; his point-blank position long enough to fire his harpoon gun.  At \n&gt; this range, Ragnar could be ripped wide open by such a blast.  Fury \n&gt; whirls his blade, waiting for another opening.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most of the fire impacts on Pumpskin&#39;s self-regenerating limbs, but \n&gt; Blackfang scores a solid body hit with his last shot - and this \nwound \n&gt; doesn&#39;t close itself up right away, betraying the relative \n&gt; vulnerability of his torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hee hee, you&#39;re a perceptive one!&quot; Pumpskin chuckles as he flails \nin \n&gt; both directions, looking to give each of them a two-tentacle hug.  \n&gt; All four appendages stretch out to their maximum length again.\n\n\n\n"}}
