He didn&#39;t know what to make of \nthe snake-like arm that had her and threw her.\n\nHe stepped forward, putting his paw into the water, but found that it was \nonly about one inch deep.\n\n\n&gt;From: logomorph@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Fri, 21 Jul 2000 14:22:18 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;::KitKat::\n&gt;\n&gt;She cut and tried to sever the arm that held Stringtra.
