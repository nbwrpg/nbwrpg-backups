For her\n&gt; there was no other escape from here except death, thus was the penalty\n&gt; for failing the test. Meanwhile Blight simply smirked at Darkfate and\n&gt; then turned and headed towards one of the walls.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blight: &quot;They will work. Or you will die. As far as I can see its a\n&gt; win-win situation for me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With those words Blight walked through a new opening in the wall that\n&gt; sealed itself right back up after he left. He was now once again in\n&gt; the main control room of the complex, and soon a transmission was\n&gt; opened to all of Darkfate&#39;s troops, their frequency was also\n&gt; discovered when Blacknightmare was scanned. He chuckled somewhat\n&gt; before his message played over the comm lines of every single member\n&gt; of Darkfates men.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blight: &quot;This is Blight, of the Infecticons, your commander, Darkfate\n&gt; is now our prisoner. If you do not do as we say, we shall kill him.\n&gt; You are all to stop with whatever you are doing and are to come to the\n&gt; location of this transmission. You will recieve further orders from me\n&gt; then. If you need a landmark... just hover over the big whirlpool.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Blight laughed to himself as he then pressed another button. Back in\n&gt; the part of the base Alecto was in, an anti gravity device activated\n&gt; beneath her and sent her flying out of the chamber and back to ledger\n&gt; and co. At that point the whirling water vortex greatly shrank leaving\n&gt; only a small entry point down to the same sealed off section of the\n&gt; base. And still at the bases&#39; center a massive hole was now in the\n&gt; ground but all within the hole was metal and electronics beneath that.\n&gt; And still the nanites continued to build down deeper into the already\n&gt; seemingly bottomless thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmare/Darkfate::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmare felt chaotical energy  struk her but she would \n&gt; fight; \n&gt; &gt; she had a lot things to live, she had to destroy Vamprah and  the\n&gt; &gt; most important: She liked to see Orchestra again.
