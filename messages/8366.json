The coded Predacon frequency.*\n\n&quot; Predacon base, this is BrightBlade. I&#39;m currently 20 clicks from the\nCybertronien Fire. Expect a particularly large amount of vital data to be\nloaded directly into the main console from the Maximal main data base. I&#39;ll\nbe back with the loaded cross section of their ship in a mega-cycle or so.\nIf it&#39;s possible I want at least two bots processing the data that comes in.\nI&#39;m not infiltrating the enemy base just to use the bathrooms.&quot;\n\n* She looked down at Gangon&#39;s spark.*\n\n&quot; There should be diagnostics and diagrams of security programs, weapons and\nso on in the incoming data. It&#39;ll take a bit of program memory so it might\nbe smart to begin making room for the data now before I get in and transfer\nit to you. Oh, and Rampage? If Lord Hell Beast isn&#39;t there it would be nice\nif you took the position of commander until I returned. That&#39;s all. My next\nreport will be when I&#39;m ready to transfer the data. BrightBlade out.&quot;\n\n* The deactivating her com-link she looked back at Perndabot, a smile on her\nface. If she knew one thing that it was that she could trust her fellow\nPredacons, feeling that they were more a part of her then ever when she had\nbecome second in command.\nShe liked the idea of all of those talented bot&#39;s behind her, liking the\nresponsibility it gave.\nShe was going to get all this data for them, so that THEY could win this\nwar. Putting her life on the line for them, to get this data so that the\nMaximals would soon fall!*\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOld school buds here:\nhttp://click.egroups.com/1/7081/13/_/_/_/964446058/\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
