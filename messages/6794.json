Tripredicus \ndoesn&#39;t have the sense of fellowship and morality you Maximals have. \nIf they want something to happen losses are irrelevant. Especially \nlosses that won&#39;t exist after the missions completed. Megatron, Hell \nBeast, Tarantulis, Galvatron, thier all Predacon leaders with the \ndesure to overthrow the council and take control themselves. they \nwere given these types of assignments to remove them from opposition, \npermanently.&quot; so if they want us deleted then theres noyhing we can \ndo but succeed or die.&quot; The spider can speak of his own kind that way \nbecause he sees the same aspects in himself. He didn&#39;t care about how \nmany Maximals or Predicons lost thier sparks, as long as he survived \nis what mattered.\n\n&quot;These are the files I&#39;ve obtained on the Predicon ship, I also know \nthrough reliable sources that Magmatron&#39;s out to either capture it \nfor himself or destroy it.&quot; Phobia sets files on the table between \nthe others. &quot;The Cybertronian Fire may have the firepower to turn the \ntide of battle. Besides, a ship of this magnifficence should be in \nspace, not stuck on this primitive planet.&quot; Phobia knew what question \nwould come next, he just wanted to hear Kluster ask.\n(If you don&#39;t know the question it&#39;s how can we get this ship off the \nground without engines?)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; For your information, JP, the newcomers didn&#39;t attack the \nCybertronian Fire, \n&gt; they attacked the Ark. The Cybertronian Fire is still fully \nfunctional, \n&gt; except for the engines.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster nods, the info that Phobia had given his sinking \nin. &quot;Destroy this \n&gt; planet?&quot; Kluster frowns, &quot;They would first rescue the predacons. \nThis is \n&gt; serious,&quot; he looks at Phobia, &quot;The Council wouldn&#39;t do that, it \nwould destroy \n&gt; most of their army.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He stands up, going to a comp console. &quot;Are you suggesting we \nattack the Iron \n&gt; Fist?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
