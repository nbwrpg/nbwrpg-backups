She sat in the pilot&#39;s \nseat and watched out the window for a glimps of a planet.  She had \nflown in search of Cybertron. But as of yet, no success. \nShe was beginning to wonder if the rumor that the planet didn&#39;t \nservive the war was true. \n\nHer radar showed a planet off to her right. Her scanners wouldn&#39;t \nread what kind of planet it was untill she was only 5 hours out. As \nof now, she was 8 hours out.  \n\n&quot;Well, with luck, I&#39;ll land somewhere and find a friend to talk to. \nOh Pit, at least anything living would be nice.&quot;  She turned the ship \ntowards the planet and crossed her fingers hoping it was Cybertron. \n\nShe reached for the console where her cup of hot energon was sitting, \nwhen something hit the side wing and sent the ship into a spin.  With \nsome great effort, she finally got the ship to straighten out.\n\n&quot;Whooh, that was close.&quot;  She pressed a button to run a diognostic, \nwhen something hit the ship again. Only this time, it tore off the \nback tailfin and she was left with no engine power. Engine gages \nshowed the impulse coils were going to explode.  She pressed the \nbuttons on the console, and the whole enginge drive was ejected out \nthe back. However, just as it cleared, it exploded. The power from \nthe explosion sent her hurtling towards a planet.  She faught \nfuriously, but got the emergency power packs working. She&#39;d have \nenough power to maybe get the ship somewhere close. But she was being \nhurtled out of control.  \n\n&quot;DAMN! OK, hang on, try to keep control.  OK, use the guidence jets, \nhold course towards the planet.  OK, if I calculate this right, at \nthis rate, I&#39;ll be at that planet in only 5 hours.  This isn&#39;t going \nto an easy landing when I get into the atmosphere of what ever ball \nthat is infront of me.&quot;  She was struggling to hold the drive stick \nsteady. &quot;OK, what did I get told to do when slag happened? Oh yeah, \nhold the stick stead, keep an eye on the gages, keep both feet on the \npedals, bend forward, put your head between your legs and kiss your \naft-thrusters goodbye.&quot;  \n\nShe watched as the time seemed to pass to quickly to notice. Soon, \nthe planet was right in front of her. &quot;Holy Pit!&quot;\n\nShe closed her eyes for a second,&quot;Matrix, watch out for me.&quot;\nHer ship started to enter the atmosphere.\n\n\n"}}
