Prebon stood with his \nback to his troops watching the flashing battle on his scanners. he \npressed a green button on the console and a 3d view came up on \nscreen. \n\n&quot;It would seem that the Alliance has had the same idea that I thought \nof.&quot; He steps a little closer to the screen, &quot;A large concentration \nof Maximals have gathered at the Cybertronian Fire. Since they were \nat a strategic disadvantage I was going to have you attack them, It \nwould seem that the Alliance also saw the advantage and took action.&quot; \nhe looks at Slayer, &quot;This is a chance for all of you to make amends \nfor the pathetic attack on the Ark.&quot; The comment was directed at \nSlayer but everybody had made mistakes during that attack. &quot;I want my \norders followed exactly when I order it, not later, there will be no \nexcuses for failure. Am I understood?&quot; Prebon stared across his line \nof troops, Bullet, Ignatius, Blaze, Hammer, and Slayer all stood in a \nline before him. &quot;Are there any Questions?&quot; Prebon wasn&#39;t really \ninterested in questions, he was just wondering who&#39;d be the first to \nquestion him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;On my way,&quot; Slayer replies, walking off toward Prebon&#39;s office.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the distance Prebon watched the scanners, he carefully \nmonitored \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; battle between the Alliance and the Maximals.&quot; Trainers, report \nto \n&gt; my office\n&gt; &gt; for orders.&quot; he decided to let the Alliance take care of the \n&gt; Maximals then\n&gt; &gt; go after whoevers left.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bullet was the first to reply, &quot;On my way lord Prebon.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ignatius was refueling at the time so he couldn&#39;t go right \n&gt; away. &quot;I&#39;ll be up\n&gt; &gt; soon as possible.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blaze was monitoring communications so she was already outside \nhis \n&gt; office.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hammer was outside playing in the sand in Grizzly bear mode. &quot;Yes \n&gt; Sir.:&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (This means Slayer too.)\n\n\n"}}
