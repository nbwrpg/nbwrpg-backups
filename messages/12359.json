Many curious had happened to\n&gt; him\n&gt; this day. He firmly believed that the Matrix had a\n&gt; purpose for all bots, and for all things.Did the\n&gt; Matrix send him to this planet, to Battera, to show\n&gt; him up what his purpose was? Was his true purpose to\n&gt; bring this war to an end?He picked up a small stone\n&gt; and tossed it across the water. &quot;I guess I got\n&gt; plenty\n&gt; of time to figure that out&quot;, he thought.For now, he\n&gt; had more things to discuss with Battera. He\n&gt; transformed to beast mode, and flew back towards the\n&gt; CF to find her.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!\n&gt; Messenger.\n&gt; http://im.yahoo.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
