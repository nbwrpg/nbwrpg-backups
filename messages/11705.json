Suddenly, he saw a ship ahead in the\ndistance. He examined it further, and saw that it was\nthe Cybertronian Fire.He recognized it because he had\nbeen at the spaceport the day it launched. He also\nknew that he had traveled through a rift in time, and\nwas now in the middle of a war. This was not good. He\nwas a peace loving bot, and had no use for war. Still,\nhe decided that it would be safer for him there than\nout here in the open. He opened his comm, and\ntransmitted a message. &quot;Cybertronian Fire, do you read\nme. My name is WindRider. I am a Maximal, and I am\nstranded on this planet.Im not far from your position.\nRequest permission to come in. Please respond.&quot;\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail ï¿½ Free email you can access from anywhere!\nhttp://mail.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
