He \nwas strong enough to take Oblitericons arm off. Since I created Koj and \nInu-Yasha as a experiment moves there skills are all being field test. And \nsince this is my cousins first Rpg I think he has done a excellent job. He&#39;s \nshown more courage and guts then I seen since I played this Rpg. Since he \nleft me to cover for him I&#39;ll play Koj and Inu plus some shadows from the \npast. Lets see how you fare in a fair fight with Koj and Inu Ks but since \nyou always use size or numbers that will be the day. Also since there are \nover 100 attacks on the 2 this is the short version.\n\n::Koj::\nKoj looks at all the attack Fire &quot;Neo Scramble.&quot; Koj takes of countering and \navoiding what he can absorbs the lighting in to the Lance.\n\n::Neo Bahamut::\nDoing the same\n\n::As the Fire smoke as and etc settle in.::\n\n::Koj::\n&quot;Neo ya dead yet?&quot; As Koj looking for lack of a better word like shit bullet \nholes ever were his radar ear piece broken his mask cracked and chiped. \nLeaking enegry and has dart in his shoulder. Koj taps a becon.\n\n::Neo::\n&quot;No mon&quot; As his wings are tattered his armor marred, dinged, burned, cracked \nand piece by hanging on.

Looking around the \nAlliance leaving them for dead. Sink ratio 100%+ &quot;Lets go home we&#39;ll meet \nthem again soon enough.&quot; As climbs on Neo.\n\n::Neo::\nNeo thinks its moments like this I wonder about him &quot;We can go one more \nround as he stands up.&quot; looking at his Sink Ratio 100%+ Neo takes off back \ntowards the CF.\n\n::Else where::\n\n::?1::\nSitting is a place that reaks of Smoke fire and brimstone that becons a Old \nautobot channel &quot;That signals unit Zero?
