He =\r\nwas not about to give up now, not when Rodimus really needed him. He rememb=\r\nered how Vestige had been invigorated by his transfer of power from his che=\r\nst core, where a beating heart still pulsates. It would prove useful again,=\r\n and this time, he needed a way to channel that power into the figure lying=\r\n on the bed. He uses his arm to shield away the insects who were stinging h=\r\nim. With the other arm, he reaches out to the figure&#39;s chest, and puts his =\r\nhand on him gently. He concentrates deeply and tries to channel his own spi=\r\nrituality into the figure lying on the bed. His very soul now acting upon h=\r\nis heart out of the one power that no force could fight. The power of compa=\r\nssion, of love, and of loyalty.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Rodimus, I&#39;m here now, and there is n=\r\nothing that will stop me from bringing you back. My hand is here for you no=\r\nw. And this time, I will never let go.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFor a brief moment that lar=\r\nge winged insectiods are held at bay as\nTuscon attempted to direct his flow=\r\n of energy into the still form that\nlay on the bed. The figure itself shudd=\r\nered once as if taking in some\ndeep rattling breath and then lay still.\n\nMe=\r\nanwhile the winged insects still came at Tuscon thier furiously\nonlsaught b=\r\narely slowed by Tuscon&#39;s defensive movements. Each insect\nwas nearly as lar=\r\nge as Tuscon, and looking something flying a preying\nmantis. Thier fore-cla=\r\nws were large and sharp as they took swipes at\nthe Autobot before them, thi=\r\ner movements relentless and even some how\ndesperate, as if they knew that s=\r\nomethng was about to go dreadfully\nwrong if they didn&#39;t stop Tuscon!\n\nMeanw=\r\nhile towards the middle of the floor Vestige was fighting a\ndesperate battl=\r\ne of his own against his foes! Once and then again they\nsank powerful claws=\r\n into him forcing him back, and each time he fired\nblasts from his weapon b=\r\narely holding them at bay!\n\nThe figure on the bed shuddered once more as br=\r\night optics lit up and\nlooked at Tuscon. However at the same time Tuscon co=\r\nuld feel the\nbarbed claws of one the insectoids bite deep into his shoulder=\r\n!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
