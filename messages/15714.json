He laughed, stumbling back as a third shot hits him in \nthe chest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Oblitercon growled, transforming into his HUMVEE mode and \ndriving at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Necromancer, firing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Koj&#39;s shot hit the outside of Pyro&#39;s cannon, leaving a dent in \nit. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alliance member yelled in rage, scorching the forest while \ntrying to hit\n&gt; &gt; Koj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with his flames.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Scavanger yelled as a blade went halfway through his cannon. He \njumped\n&gt; &gt; back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transforming into bot mode and landing a few feet from the \nMaximal femm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Taking a rocket launcher out of subspace, the bot fired it at \nTavatron,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aiming for her feet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dark One and Firearm hovered a few dozen feet away from each \nother, both\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them having their weapons ready. The Alliance bot watched his \nopponent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; carefully, waiting for him to make the first mode.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Firearm growled, his weapons ready as well. He glanced quickly \nat the\n&gt; &gt; ground,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seeing the seperate scirmishes beneath.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;How about a deal?&quot; Firearm said, loudly enough for Dark One to \nhear. It\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious to him that this bot had some authority, and he could \nsee a way\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; limit the bloodshed, &quot;We fight right now. Just me and you. If I \nwin, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; leave these Maximals alone, if you win, we&#39;ll leave.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dark One considered the offer carefully, looking over the \nbigger bot in\n&gt; &gt; front\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of him. He was positive that he could take him. He had, after \nall, taken\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much bigger bots before. &quot;Agreed.&quot; he said, activating his comm \nas he\n&gt; &gt; nods,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sending a transmission to all the Oblitercons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hold your fire,&quot; the transmission read, &quot;Me and the Maximal \ncommander\n&gt; &gt; here,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he figured Firearm was the highest ranking Maximal, since he \nwas the one\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; offered the duel, &quot;Are going to fight one on one. Untill then, \nthere\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no further fighting, understood?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He looked back at Firearm, nodding. &quot;I&#39;m ready, Maximal.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Firearm grinned. &quot;Maximals,&quot; he said into his comm, &quot;I&#39;m gonna \ntake\n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; leader on a one-on-one. Whoever wins will be the winning \nfaction of this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; battle. It&#39;ll help limit the bloodshed. Hold your fire untill \nthen,\n&gt; guys.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This&#39;ll be over shortly.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Firearm turned back to Dark One, his sword ready. &quot;Well, shall \nwe?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dark One laughed, firing a plasma rifle into the Maximal&#39;s \nchest. The\n&gt; two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bots flew toward each other, their swords clashing when they \nmet...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Oblitercons stopped firing as they got the transmision, \nholding\n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire. Each one looked at their Maximal opponent, ready to fight \nin case\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals didn&#39;t follow the agreement.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Proto&#39;s eyes widened as he recieved Firearm&#39;s transmission, the \nMaximal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flying back a bit to give the two enemies space for battles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He hoped that Firearm knew what he was doing, a dead Maximal \nwas not the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; greatest thing in the world to get out of this mission.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prowl recieved Firearm&#39;s orders as he flew into the battle, \nfrowning as\n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; computer reports the message to him. A duel?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prowl shook his head, hovering in the air a few dozen feet \nbehind the\n&gt; two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; duelers. He wouldn&#39;t have trusted the Alliance with a one on \none duel,\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps it was possible...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prowl glanced at the ground, hoping that the Maximals would \nhold their\n&gt; &gt; fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
