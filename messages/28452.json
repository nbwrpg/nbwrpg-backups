It focuses in on the energy-signature.  Flying side to side wouldn&#39;t \nexactly dodge it.  Just wanted to let you know that)\n\n\nUnicron/Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector:\n\n\n\n\n\nUnicron didn&#39;t smile or show any emotion.  After Darkfate&#39;s reply, his \nopinion of the being was that Darkfate was somewhere between a cockroach and \nthe organic matter pond scum feeds upon.\n\nMoving sharp left through the air he dodged all but two shots that struck him \nin his armored right abs, but he was relatively undamaged.  He sent a plan to \nhis followers via inner monologue comm and he began activating several \nalgorithms inside the Ramora.\n\nRaising both arms he fired four missiles, all energy-signature seeking \nmissiles, two from each arm, down at Darkfate.\n\n---\n\nVehement nodded at what seemed a sound plan from Unicron, firing off ten \nrapid optic blasts at a bat probe.  Raising his left arm, he charged up a \nsonic wave and launched an invisible wave of destructive sonic energy down \ntowards Darkfate.  Raising his right arm, the barrel that was there instead \nof the arm fired off three fire balls at Shivah.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher raised an arm, launching two energy-signature seeking missiles \nfrom a barrel at the bottom of his wrist, the missiles heading for Alecto.\n\n---\n\nReflector would&#39;ve liked to comply with his master, but there were to many \nshots.  Forming a black orb in his hands, he threw it forward and made it \nprematurely explode, intercepting all the lasers.  The flames from the blast \nlightly scorched him, but he was relatively unhurt.  He fired off three optic \nblasts at Perceptor&#39;s abdomen.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
