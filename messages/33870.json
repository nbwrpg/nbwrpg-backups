Before you kill me, know this: I didn&#39;t do it on purpouse.\n&gt; \n&gt; Something I was making backfired upon testing and destroyed all the\n&gt; character profiles except for Alloran&#39;s (very strange occurance). It\n&gt; also mutilated the character editor. Nothing really works right now,\n&gt; and I&#39;m fixing it, but I just wanted to tell you guys so that you\n&gt; could get started with retyping your char profiles, because I don&#39;t\n&gt; have backups (Alloran&#39;s are still there, so he doesn&#39;t have to type\n&gt; them up). I&#39;m sorry about all this, But it gives me work too.\n\n\n"}}
