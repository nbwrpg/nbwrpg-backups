The Shadow Destiny has \nbeen built by Gesper, my younger brother. It is a techno-organic, with \na format similar to yours and mine. All of us, Tripredacus, are \ntechno-organics. We have been sent on Earth for a harvesting mission.\n\nHe heads to the storage bay.\n\nBelthassan: I will introduce you first to the other members of the \nteam before I present Daemos. He is our commander.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nDaemos: Oh, we did find Firedrill. However, he is not the same person \nanymore. Something we did not anticipate happened in the Renewal \nChamber. Usually, it heals techno-organics. What I believe happened is \nthat the Chamber reformatted him to fit the healing process. He now \ncalls himself Anachronox and has pledged alligence to my group. I did \nnot wish this to happen. I am sorry about what happened, and I hope \nyou can find some forgiveness in you. If we find any solutions, we \nwill talk with you about it.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nGesper: Sure thing Crotale. I&#39;d like to talk with Pacifix now.\n\n\n"}}
