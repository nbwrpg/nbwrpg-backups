He kept a watchful \noptic, he hoped for a real fight but a practice battle was good enough for \nnow. Besides, he wanted to test Tavatron&#39;s power and battle knowledge.\nIt was almost midnight but they could both see well in the dark, the moon \nshawn it&#39;s reflection in a small pond at the bottom of the valley. Yet \nanother challenge.\nDinobot hade to admit though, Tavatron had a good optic for terrain that \nchallenged her abilities of a warrior.*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
