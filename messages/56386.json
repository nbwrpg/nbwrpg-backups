So it&#39;s going \nto be a bit long.\nThough I&#39;m glad to be back, and I hope you enjoy what you read. ^-^\nThanks!\n\n\n\nThe stellar winds which drifted through space were calm and smooth just out \nbeyond the metallic atmosphere of the Transformer planet, known as \nCybertron.\nWhich, ultimately, turned out to be the ideal working conditions for a black \nand gray Decepticon research vessel stationed just above the silver planet.\nIts mission: to study and record a particularly strange space anomaly that \nhad developed months ago, a little too close to Cybertron for comfort.\n\n~\nA few weeks earlier, at one of the many secret meetings the Council of \nElders undertook, it was agreed upon that this new distortion in space \nneeded looking into.\nSo, naturally these days; long after the Great Wars which nearly shook the \nentire universe to pieces, the Decepticons were chosen as the prime \ncandidates to handle this matter.\nNo, the Maximals and Predacons which now dominated the planet, nor what few \nAutobots remained couldn�t be bothered to risk their own peoples. But, \nalthough there had been peace for centuries, the Decepticons had always \nseemed the most expendable.\nThey�d truly sunk that low.\n\n~\nStill, those aboard research ship couldn�t complain.\nBecause research and exploration was what they were all about, and this \nnewest occurrence in the delicate fabric of space fascinated them to no end.\nDaily the 4 of them had worked. Scanning over and measuring the variety of \nenergies that were emanating from the undulating tare. Which looked, \nexternally, like a circular patch of heat waves against the dark backdrop of \nouter space. Distorting the stars.\n\nDust storm, the smallest of the group and a professional scout, thought it \nlooked neat and tried to find out all that he could about it. Even if it \nmeant bothering his 2 superiors in the process. Bombarding them with \nquestions that they couldn�t possibly answer at this time.\nUntil Blue Flame, the 2nd in command, finally had to give him a good bop on \nthe head and tell the little dune bunny that that was enough.\nMuch to the relief of the rest of the crew.\n\nStill, it was far better to be curious about everything then interested in \nnothing, so Diesel Runner (D.R. for short) simply let Dust storm be. Being \nthe Commander of the mission, she was the one who had to put up with him the \nmost anyway, Since she couldn�t expect Blue Flame or the quiet Dark Cloud \nto. The ships aerial surveillance officer.\nMost of all, however, they all got along the best that Decepticons ever \ncould be expected to and completed their given assignments on time.\n\nIt was just that the space anomaly was turning out to be a bit more \ndifficult then could have been expected.\nAnd a shock of all shocks when it began to implode.\nScrambling to their stations, it was discovered that the distortion tare was \ncollapsing in on itself and beginning to suck in everything that it could as \nits gravity field collapsed. Including the Decepticon ship!\n\n� It�s pulling us in!� Blue Flame reported from his position at the helm \ncontrols as the bridge flashed with warning sirens. � And I can�t break us \nloose!�\n� Did you try the reverse thrusters?� D.R. asked from her seat at the \ncommand post. Only to receive a report from her 2nd in command that they \nwere on full and still had no effect.\nDust Storm freaked as the tare grew closer. � We�re gunna DIE!!�\nDark Cloud tried to correct their navigations back to Cybertron, with no \neffect. Mumbling to himself, � Where the Pit are those recovery drones when \nyou need them?!�\nAll of a sudden, everything inside of the ship went black and power ceased \nto flow throughout the bridge system.\nBlue Flame slammed his fists against the controls. � On great! Now the \nconsole�s dead!�\n�Over here too.� Dark Cloud reported from his post.\n\nThe ship was now on the fringe of the collapsing anomaly and the ship began \nto shake violently.\nSo violent, that it began to fell apart.\nInside the bridge, things were no better. And all Hell broke loose.\n\n� Hang onto something!� D.R. ordered just before they were sucked in and \neverything went black.\n\nThe tare disappeared and the atmosphere around Cybertron was left peaceful \nonce more.\n\n\n\nBIOS:\n\nCREW OF THE DECEPTICON RESEARCH VESSEL:\n\nName: Diesel Runner\n            (D.R. for short)\nGender: fembot\nHeight: 11ft\nWeight: 2 t\nFaction: Decepticon\nPosition: Commander\n\nVehicle: Black, with blue and purple striped semi truck\n              Mack 2000\n&#61623; hauls black cargo trailer with purple Decepticon insignia on upper \nright corner\n&#61623; chrome running boards, stacks, bumpers, grill and fuel tanks\n&#61623; Decepticon insignia on chrome hubcaps\nRobot: basically a female Optimus Prime (to put it simply)\n\nWeapon: Laser rifle\n&#61623; beam saber\n&#61623; flame thrower\n&#61623; x-ray headlights\n&#61623; holo-shield\n\n\nName: Blue Flame\nGender: male\nHeight: 12 ft\nWeight: 2.6 t\nFaction: Decepticon\nPosition: 2nd In Command\n\nVehicle: Blue semi-truck with yellow/orange flames on front\n&#61623; hauls no trailer\n&#61623; Chrome parts the same as D.R.\n&#61623; Decepticon insignia on grill.\n\nWeapon: Ion disrupter pistol\n&#61623; beam ax\n&#61623; laser sharpshooter rifle\n&#61623; acid grenades\n&#61623; flame thrower\n\n\nName: Dust Storm\nGender: male\nHeight: 8 ft\nFaction: Decepticon\nPosition: Scout\n\nVehicle: Copper colored dune buggy\n\nWeapon: Smoke bombs\n&#61623; acid pellets\n&#61623; beam staff\n&#61623; hologram projector\n\n\nName: Dark Cloud\nGender: male\nHeight: 9.1 ft\nFaction: Decepticon\nPosition: Ariel Surveillance\n\nVehicle: Black and silver jet plane\n\nWeapons: Plasma rifle\n&#61623; vibration cannon\n&#61623; missile launcher\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_23ad_72b6_6924\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;Blue Flame.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Blue Flame.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_23ad_72b6_6924--\r\n\n"}}
