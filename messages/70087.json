Shifting back into robot mode Chopshop caught the metal\n&gt; chunk he had cut out and laid it to the side, revealing a hole large\n&gt; enough for he and Lamia to enter the ship. Water from the interior of\n&gt; the ship began to run through the new hole in the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Lamia noddes and said &quot;the massster will be pleasssed with this new\n&gt;&gt; recluit&quot;She transformed and went inside, moving carfully ready for\n&gt;&gt; everything\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the ship is dark and dank, water has dripped in from the\n&gt; outside and pools of it sit on the floor, which both Lamia and\n&gt; Chopshop step into as the entered, the water reaches up almost to\n&gt; their knees in spots as they walk, although now with the hold that\n&gt; Chopshop had cut, the water was quickly draining, and the water level\n&gt; is beginning to drop.\n&gt; \n&gt; The chamber where they stood seemed to be a cargo hold of some type,\n&gt; although whatever cargo it held seems to be long gone, if there ever\n&gt; was anything here at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; To the right leads back to the engine room of the ship as well as the\n&gt; sleeping quarters, although from the size of them, this ship was not\n&gt; designed for comfort or long travels.\n&gt; The ship itself is not very large\n&gt; \n&gt; To the left is the cockpit, which like the rest of the ship, is\n&gt; heavily damaged and has water along the floor boards. It is heavily\n&gt; crumpled and a single pilot lay slumped over the controls, the body\n&gt; impaled by several stout tree limbs and large pieces of bent metal.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
