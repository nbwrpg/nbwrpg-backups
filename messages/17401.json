He stands by it and smiles. ANother bot comes out and hugs\n&gt; Agent 2 suddenly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m here. Don&#39;t tell me that&#39;s your base?&quot; Agent 5 says.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah. Hey, where&#39;s Agent 4?&quot; Agent 2 asks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;He didn&#39;t make it, we got into a fight. He got his brains blown\n&gt; out. How about Agent 1 and Agent 3?&quot; Agent 5 asks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Their ship got blown up. We&#39;re the last 2.&quot; Agent 2 says.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That totally lacks coolness.&quot; Agent 5 says.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It is loaded with Heinosity.&quot; Agent 2 says.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Like in that movie.
