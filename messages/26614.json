Glaring at the fembot as he stood there and \nwatched her hand come closer and closer to the black ball of lint.\nFor some unexplainable reason Tavatron&#39;s sudden apology heightened his \naggression and his eyes turned into slits. This was pathetic! Since when had \nhe needed the help of others in a foolish situation such as this? It \nwas...absurd! A grown man such as himself with a history of bloodshed, \nseeming helpless just because a black ball from Hell landed on his snout! \nWhat foolishness!     However, Dinobot remained where he was as Tavatron \nleaned close and the small creature decided to use her nose as a target, the \nfemale jumping back and whimpering quietly in alarm.\nDinobot only snarled and rolled his eyes, getting sick of the little game, \nwhich this creature was deciding to play with the both of them. Thinking and \nwondering if it had any clue that it would be nothing but stray whips of \nfuzz on the wind if he ever got his transmetal claws on it. It was already \nstamped DEAD as far as he was concerned.    Dinobot jerked his head towards \nTavatron as she tore her staff from sub-space, wondering if she was going to \ntake some sort of revenge upon the ball-o-fuzz resting comfortably upon his \nmost highly reflective snout. However, was not eager to see if his thoughts \nwere false...or her aim. There was one fact, which Tavatron would have to \ncatch up upon before she so much of moved a metallic muscle, and that was \nthat if she hit him instead of the cat she would have a pair of transmetal \nfangs to try and pry off of her throat. She was indeed his friend, yes...but \nno bot hit him and got away with it.\nDinobot snarled in response to her telling of him to remain still, shaking \nhis head to try and rid himself of the creature before moving it down and \nreaching towards it with his own claws. If it tried to swat him, he would \nsimply squish it, then peel it off of his snout. Which suited him just as \nwell.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
