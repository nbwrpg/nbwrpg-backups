The silence is brocken though, by an\nengines roar, and even more so by a cackling idiot. &quot;If ya dont hurry\nSpeedbreaker, Im gonna beat you to the base&quot; screams a grey car as he nears\nthe end of the Continent. He hits a pile of rocks, and jumps, smoothely\ntransforming into a flying robot. The robot looks truly magnificent, if not\nfor half of what is supposed to be a face was missing. Speedbreaker then\ncatches up, and does the same, he is in very good shape compared to his\ncomrade, &quot;Youre built for speed, im just built to look good Wildrider&quot; the\nrobot says quickly. Now that they are not in car mode though, Speedbreaker\nhas a chance to catch up. &quot;Well, now we have an idea of who our enemies\nare&quot; Speedbreaker says, looking towards Wildrider. He still had that stupid\ngrin, although it was now not complete. &quot;Dosent that hurt&quot;, asks\nSpeedbreaker, &quot;Naw, trust me, those Maximals will hurt worse soon, when we\nget some reinforcements&quot; Wildrider jests. As they near the end of the ocean\nSpeedbreaker starts to worry, &quot;There are three new signatures at our base,\ntheir not any of the new Decepticons&quot;. Wildrider replies, in still the\njoking tone &quot;The Maximals, they must be pretty ticked of what we did&quot; as he\nflies he pulls out his gun, &quot;well they&#39;d better be ready, I got a score to\nsettle&quot;, he rumbles, for the first time his smile replaced by a grimace, as\nthey close in on base.\n\n\n\n"}}
