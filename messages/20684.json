He picked up Ice&#39;s scent and continued forward. He came\nupon what appeared to be a frozen river. he could see a hole in it. He\nfeared the worst, if she fell in it could spread the virus even faster. He\ncontacted Veratis hoping the old bot would put his fears to rest.\n\n&quot;No sign of the virus in the water.&quot; Veratis said with a sigh of relief.\nHe&#39;d lost her on his scanners but could still give Lunarpine a direction to\nhead in in order to find her and bring her back.He hoped she was only a\ncarrier and not a victim. Veratis knew that Lunarpines body was immune to\nthe virus, unless it had mutated inside Ice.\n\nLunarpine was relieved at the close call, he again transformed, this time\ninto his half wolf stage and began moving. He&#39;d lost a little speed but\ngained strength which caused him to move a little faster, he could force his\nway through the snow more easily than run through. He howled to the sky\nhoping Ice would get the message and come home. He missed Shadow Wing. He\ndidn&#39;t get to know Ice, and now he might never get the chance. He might have\nshed a tear if the freezing winds hadn&#39;t frozen his ducts. This was like he\nremembered his crash site was like in northern canada. A frozen wonderland\nwhere he&#39;d met her, now it was his turn to search for her, He was glad, he\nnever thought he&#39;d have the chance again.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, November 12, 2000 7:05 PM\nSubject: Ice\n\n\n&gt; ::Ice:;\n&gt;\n&gt; She stopped at the end of the ice field.

Her\n&gt; shoulder was hurtingher too much to continue on. Her shoulder was\n&gt; just pouring out the red liquid. She could barely move at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; She heard a muffled voice on her commlink.
