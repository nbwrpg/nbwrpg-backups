It&#39;s always nice to be able to RP with you logo!\nNothing much has changed with the Predacons. They are at BlackFortress.\nDrillBit still leads with Killfest and DarkFate. DrillBit and KitKat2\nare not married yet.(sigh) Currently DarkFate is captured by one of the\nenemy factions.(Who has him anyway, Airly? I forgot.) And SilverScout is\nrunning around BlackFortress while we try to capture her. You wont be\nable to get into BF right away, because all the defences are up, and the\nbase is covered in lava right now.\n\n"}}
