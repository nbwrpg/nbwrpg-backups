Bad shape? He wasn&#39;t in too much of bad shape. The \nonly thing that he knew that was damaged was his foot. He looke down, seeing \nthat there was a hole through the front section of it, smashing most of it \nin. He wasn&#39;t very painful. It wasn&#39;t near to being close as painful when \nhis leg was busted open.\n\n&quot;It ain&#39;t nothin&#39;,&quot; he said to KitKat. &quot;Ah can handle mahself.&quot; He watched \nthe area where Cheetor took off. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about &#39;im. We got &#39;im where we \nwant &#39;im. He ain&#39;t goin&#39; no where. Ah think all we gotta do is catch up t&#39; \n&#39;im where he fell.&quot; He wavered his cobra hand.&quot;\n\nHe looked to KitKat and Stingtra. &quot;Come on, ladies, wanna give me uh hand.&quot; \nHe dashed off, a little too confident. He realized how his foot contended \nwith his gate. He stumbled, then stopped. He looked down on his smashed \nfoot. He needed another way to get around it. He hopped on one foot, testing \nit for a few strides, then got a hand of it. He had to use les pressure on \nit.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
