In fact, he realized just then \nthey had cloaking abilities. The harpoon exploded on his thigh but \nhardly did more than to shed some armor off. He swung his autocannon \nin line with the newly appeared Riekan and let go a double shot along \nwith his two large lasers.\n\nRagnar: Maximals! They have more troops coming in, but these have \ncloaking devices! Be careful!\n\nOn the other side of the battlefield, Katya barely escaped the \ntentacles of the pumpkin bot. Her speed did help her greatly and she \nsoon was meters away from him. She aimed at the two nearest appendages \nand tried to fry them.\n\nKatya: Stravag! Katya to Ragnar and Rodimus, I am being engaged. The \nhit-and-run will have to wait a bit.\n\nBlackfang: Katya, I&#39;m coming to assist...\n\nKatya: Neg! He is mine! Distract the others.\n\nBlackfang saw the fake Optimus and fired his shotgun on him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ragnar&#39;s only warning that he has a much closer opponent than \n&gt; Hydras&#39;s group is the distinctive &quot;k&#39;thunk&quot; sound of Riekan&#39;s gun \n&gt; launching and explosive harpoon.  The shot forces him to decloak, \nbut \n&gt; he retains most of the element of surprise.\n\n\n"}}
