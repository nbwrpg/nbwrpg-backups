The Rocak somehow created \nan element from Energon that was loosing it&#39;s radioactive properties. \nThis element is not unheard of,but the process is only known in \nnature. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve quite decided what its there for yet. The \noriginal pyramids of Peru were mad from this stuff(the Incas just had \na cargo cult LOOK IT UP) and when Mustex takes a sample he gets a \nblast of energon and discovers that these pyramids actually form a \nRocak transmitter literally the size of Peru. Also he discovers that \nthe Rocak created this entire galaxy as a giant energy generator and \nour moons job was to beam the energy to them.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Just because there is no rule doesn&#39;t mean that it allowed. Too \n&gt; many rules makes for a sad rpg, but oposite to that, too few also \n&gt; makes for a sad rpg. We&#39;ve brought rule creating to where it is \nnow, \n&gt; and we don&#39;t really want to create many more rules. There is no \n&gt; rule about naming other people&#39;s characters, but there is a rule \n&gt; about calling their characters by their names if the names haven&#39;t \n&gt; been said. There is no rule about naming a new element, but that \n&gt; isn&#39;t the problem, it is what the element can to that makes us \n&gt; question your motives. There is no rule about having a base around \n&gt; the moon, but likewise, there isn&#39;t a rule that says that it would \nbe \n&gt; allowed. Since the council now know of what you want to do, the \n&gt; we can talk about it, and decide what to allow, and what not to. \n&gt; There are more unspoken rules, things that you just don&#39;t do, than \n&gt; written ones. From now on, I suggest you ask the council about \n&gt; anything that isn&#39;t (or is) in the rules. Even if it&#39;s not there, \nit could \n&gt; still be disallowed, and we don&#39;t want to have you start posting \n&gt; about something absurd and causing an uproar like what happened \n&gt; with the Alliance story.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, read the post entitled &quot; - A - u - t - o - b - o - t - s - &quot; \nwritten \n&gt; by me, there&#39;s an ooc message after it that concerns you. \n&gt; Hopefully, you will find it helpful. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; On 31 Jul 2001, at 22:37, dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve already read the rules. The problem is that with what I \n&gt; &gt; concider the major rules to remember it&#39;s hard to remember the \nminor\n&gt; &gt; ones like posting when you leave. On another rpg I wrote for my \nfirst\n&gt; &gt; entree that I had barely survived 2 years on the planet Nagas. By \nthe\n&gt; &gt; way I&#39;ll go read over them,but I&#39;m pretty sure there are no rule\n&gt; &gt; against naming other players characters, naming a new element\n(I&#39;ll do\n&gt; &gt; that later), or declaring that the moon is really a giant robot \nthat I\n&gt; &gt; may later use as a base(I just want to know if you can list it on \nthe\n&gt; &gt; map).\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
