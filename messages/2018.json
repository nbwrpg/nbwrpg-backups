He slows down slightly as he \nsees that Iron Raptor isn&#39;t ready to catch him by the talons. He smiles as he \ngets an idea.\n\nProwl slows down and transforms into Robot Mode.\n\nHis wings propelling him forwards, he catches Iron Raptor by the waist, \nlifting her into the air. Resisting a terribly strong urge to kiss her, which \nwould look pretty strange to the maximals back at the Ark, he flies toward \nthe Ark.\n\nSeveral dozen yards away from the Ark, Prowl sees Shocker fly in. He tightens \nhis right arm around Iron Raptor, pressing her to him, takes his gun in his \nleft hand, and fires at Shocker.\n\n"}}
