She wasn&#39;t hungry and \nshe wasn&#39;t about to accept a meal from a bot who wanted her dead, she was \nsure of it.\nBrightBlade continued to walk towards the base until her scanners suddenly \ninformed her that Hell Beast had moved away from it and had come to the \nMaximal base.*\n\n&quot; WHAT?!&quot;\n\n*She said to the info that her scanners reported but had just happened to \nsay it a bit too loud. She looked over at Gangon.*\n\n&quot; Hell Beast had gone to the Maximal base, along with most of team.&quot;\n\n* Her tone was shocked and a bit suspicious at the same time, obviously \nthere had to be a logical reason for it.\nBrightBlade looked off into the distance and towards that Maximal base, if \nHell Beast was there with half of the Predacons that she was going to be \nthere too.\nShe looked back at Gangon but kept her eyes off Lightmare, something that \nshe liked to do best. With that she then began to run/limp off towards the \nenemy base, opening her com-link to Hell Beast.*\n\n&quot; My Lord, I am only about 9 clicks from the enemy base and your position. \nIf there are no orders to do other wise I would like to join you. \nBrightBlade out.&quot;\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
