She turned to Rowdy, &quot;What do you make of all\n&gt; &gt; this? They couldn&#39;t have vanished into thin air.  They didn&#39;t leave\n&gt; &gt; the cave because their scent is too strong right here.  They aren&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; dead or thier bodies would either be on the floor or floating in the\n&gt; &gt; pool. So where could they have gone? Swimming and found a cave with\n&gt; &gt; air somewhere down there do you think?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
