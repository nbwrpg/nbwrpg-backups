She was literally torn up where the fangs of the beast \nhad bitten into her. Her stare was blanker than ever and was \ndeteriorating at the second. It seemed as if time had stopped.\n\nMeteara: Fi... rax... is...\n\nShe touched the ground and disturbed the dust and weeds under her. \nThere, she died. Quietly, peacefully, but with a visible sense of \nregret as she had not even finished her mission.\n\nA few meters away, Sanguine laid on the ground. Her materialization of \nthe beast was now too hard for her to sustain. In fact, she could \nafford no energy to any transformation. She came back to the original \nlittle girl form, some of her artifices crumbling on the ground and \nliquifying in small pool of blood red nanites. She was hurt bad. There \nwas still hope for her though. Her automatic warning beacon lit up and \nresounded on every Predacon frequency. She entered stasis lock.\n\n\n"}}
