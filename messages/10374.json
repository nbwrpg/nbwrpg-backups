Not caring where as long as it was with him.\nAnd as much as she just wanted to spend time with him now, she knew that if she didn�t repair then she wouldn�t be of any use to him at all.\nHer wounds were fairly deep and there was no point in hiding that fact.\nHer mech-fluid covered side making it very obvious.\nIron Raptor sighed and leaned her head against prowl�s shoulder again, closing her optics for a moment and resting them. Smiling at the thought of when she slept, Prowls arms holding her tightly.\nThere was no other thought in the universe as comforting as that. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
