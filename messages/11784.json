She saw that \nthe whole area was almost completely destroyed. She gave a deep \nsigh,&quot;Well, I guess I should start somewhere.&quot;\nShe took a small light from her hip compartment.  She crawled up \nunder the console and looked around.  She saw burnt wires, melted \ncords,charred wire boxes, partially melted fuses, it was a total mess.\n\nShe found the main wire and power supply lines.  They were burnt and \nmelted in spots.  She looked aroud the room for some spair wiring she \ncould use to substitute as the power line. She found a short line \nthat would work for a while.  She swapped out the lines and pulled \nthe burnt fuses.  She had to go to the engine room to find more \nsupplies.  She found the fuses and some more wire that was useable.\n\nShe went back up to finish working on Teletran.\n\n\n"}}
