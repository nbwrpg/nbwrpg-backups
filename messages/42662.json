Unfortunately, I�m \nfinding that, with the stresses of school and such, I just can�t keep up \nwith the posts anymore. Sure they�re going slowly at the moment but it�s a \nreally big annoyance having a commander as a character. Especially when \nthey�re being called on 24-7 and expected to post right when someone needs \nthem. It�s really stressful. Especially when I didn�t ask for the position \nand now that I�ve got it I really wish that I hadn�t. I didn�t exactly \nexpect to have everything dumped into my lap, so to speak.  So, with regret \nnone the less, I�ve decided to leave the NBW.  I mean, it�s not like I�m \ngoing to be missed or anything. IR never really did much anyway�if you think \nabout it, right?  So these characters are up for grabs:\n\nDiana\nD\nTremmer\nZyber\nDesmonus\nBiomass\nNue&#39;e and\nSublime!\n\nAnyone can take �em. No one needs to ask.  Though I would like to keep IR, \nif that�s alright with everyone? She was my first character and if I ever \ndecide to return I would like to have her.  Maybe when school dies down a \nbit I�ll come back. But it�s just too much now. Seriously.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
