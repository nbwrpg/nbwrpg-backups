Her \n&gt; optics narrowed as it took a moment to register, her transorganic \n&gt; mind not as sharp as her totally metallic meta processor. But the \n&gt; voice & form was familiar enough. A Seeker. She knew what they were \n& \n&gt; how they were used & why. She had been at odds with Starscream for \n&gt; some time. But the others, especially Skywarp & Thundercracker she \n&gt; had deemed them to be good comrades. \n&gt; \n&gt; She smirked evilly, sometimes a trait that she had when she had \nsome \n&gt; plans in mind. &quot;Well, a Seeker. Empath, if I am correct.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Then she was serious. &quot;I hope you haven&#39;t turned Autobot on us?&quot; If \n&gt; empath was still a Decepticon & a good Seeker as she was or \ncurrently \n&gt; is on Cybertron, then she could be trusted with what Maxima had in \n&gt; mind.\n\n&quot;Autobot?  Never!&quot; Empath laughs, flaring her wings and showing off \nthe familiar purple insignia of the Decepticons.  &quot;But I am aligned \nwith these Maximals for the time being, on a matter of revenge.&quot;\n\n&lt;I&#39;ll explain later,&gt; she tells Maxima telepathically.\n\n\n"}}
