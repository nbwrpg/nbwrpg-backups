He looks to Percepto=\r\nr and then to the others.  Straight Shot meets up with him and offers back =\r\nhis transmitter. He looks to her with a smile.\n\n&quot;Ahh, my transmitter.  Grea=\r\nt to have you back Straight Shot.  Thank you.  Now I can help everyone much=\r\n more efficiantly.  Perceptor, I&#39;m going to get into vehicle mode, I will a=\r\nttempt to use sonar to pinpoint the creature&#39;s positions, and I could use y=\r\nou to map them.  Legacy, I&#39;d like you and everyone else to get aboard insid=\r\ne me,  because we may need to make for a fast getaway, and it&#39;s a lot easie=\r\nr if everyone is safe inside one transformer.  I will need you for a weapon=\r\n mount because in truck form, the missiles are all I have and I may need so=\r\nmething a bit more refined than those. Talon, I will need your help to man =\r\nthe cannon mount on my trailer. Two eyes up there are better than one.  Qui=\r\nckstride, Straight Shot, remain inside my cab and man the radar system.  \n\n=\r\nStraight Shot nodds as does Quickstride.\n\n&quot;Gotchya.&quot;\n\nTucson transforms and=\r\n opens all doors to everyone.\n\n&quot;All right, all aboard.

Since as it was discov=\r\nered, the Black Fortress is in\n&gt; &gt; Europe, and as we know the Ark is in Nor=\r\nth America. I believe that at\n&gt; &gt; the point in time NBW&#39;s takes place that =\r\nthere is a land bound route\n&gt; &gt; from the US to Europe, but it would take a =\r\nvery long time to traverse\n&gt; &gt; it. :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride and Stra=\r\night Shot find it relatively easy to reach the\n&gt; &gt; area that Tuscon, Percep=\r\ntor and Legacy are. The Ark&#39;s side of the\n&gt; &gt; cavern is steep and sheer, bu=\r\nt here on the European side, near the\n&gt; &gt; Black fortress, it is sloped enou=\r\ngh that a vehicle could drive up\n&gt; &gt; without too much difficulty.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A=\r\nhead of Quickstride and Straight Shot, Legacy had been silent during\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne trip so far, seemingly content to let the others take the lead.\n&gt; &gt; His s=\r\nensors had also locked in on Rodimus for a moment, and then like\n&gt; &gt; the ot=\r\nhers lost him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus appeared to be in critical condition.&quot; Lega=\r\ncy said as he\n&gt; &gt; walked, his cold cyclopean gaze attempting to pierce into=\r\n the darkness\n&gt; &gt; ahead. &quot;I did not get an exact enough scan of that creatu=\r\nre that held\n&gt; &gt; him to get a positive identification, however I have no in=\r\nformation on\n&gt; &gt; what I gave scanned.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon&#39;s headlights stretche=\r\nd far ahead into the darkness, but beyond\n&gt; &gt; the reach of them there was o=\r\nnly darkness, or cave wall where the path\n&gt; &gt; bent and turned. The venting =\r\nsteam that had obscured their vision had\n&gt; &gt; slowed and then finally stoppe=\r\nd. Ahead of them the tunnel appeared\n&gt; &gt; clear, although there was still li=\r\nttle sign of Rodimus or his apparent\n&gt; &gt; abductor, save for the occasional =\r\nscrape of metal on stone.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The noxious smell of magma still fills th=\r\ne air making the bean pod gas\n&gt; &gt; from Quickstride hardly noticeable, mixed=\r\n in as it was with all the\n&gt; &gt; other strange odors. Also heat from the surr=\r\nounding walls and floor\n&gt; &gt; make this area very hot even for transformers, =\r\nalthough it is still\n&gt; &gt; bearable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ahead of Tuscon, Perceptor and L=\r\negacy some sort of movement of several\n&gt; &gt; creatures can be made out, it do=\r\nes not look like Rodimus  . . .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
