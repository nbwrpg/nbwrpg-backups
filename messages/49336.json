The\n&gt; Matrix in G1 was the \n&gt; actual matrix and ignoring that is ignoring full\n&gt; dead on Canon. Just because \n&gt; the matrix was destroyed in G1 does not mean the\n&gt; dimension known as &quot;The \n&gt; Matrix&quot; Where the souls of the dead and heroic\n&gt; autobots and decepticons is \n&gt; gone. The Matrix in G1 was designed to tap into the\n&gt; power of those sparks, \n&gt; not destroy them. Remember the phrase they said\n&gt; &quot;Till all are one&quot; Which \n&gt; means one singular entity which could eb considered\n&gt; the matrix. Besides the \n&gt; Matrix device in G1 was duplicagted to an extent but\n&gt; not to its full power. \n&gt; Such as the Matrix Devices that were held by Lio\n&gt; Convoy, Big Convoy, and \n&gt; Super Fire Convoy. And the upcoming OPtimus Prime of\n&gt; the new TF Series, \n&gt; Transformers: Armada(Btw, who he doesn&#39;t think that\n&gt; Demolisher looks like the \n&gt; bastard son of Metroplex and Trypticon?). Anyway\n&gt; there is some clarrifying \n&gt; Info.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
