After flying for a\nwhile, halfway in turbo speed, they were close enough to the new location to\nwalk on their two feet.  Or in Fenox&#39;s case, all fours.\n\n         Fenox landed and transformed into flaming cheetah mode.  He ran at\nhis amazing speed, and was far ahead of the others.\n\n        &quot;Oh you wanna race, eh punk?!&quot; Astral shouted.\n\n        He transformed into lavadactyl mode, and flew off flapping at full\nspeed towards Fenox, and the new base.\n\n        Starlight transformed to flame wasp mode, and buzzed off towards the\ntwo.\n\n        Griplash couldn&#39;t slither very fast in snake mode, but when it came\nto running in robot mode, he was almost unmatchable.  He ran off after the\nothers.\n\n        Now the only one who hadn&#39;t joined in was Recklessa.\n\n        &quot;Suckers!!&quot; She screamed at them, as they disappeared into the\ndistance.\n\n     She snickered.\n\n      Recklessa flew up into the air with her thrusters, and shot straight\nafter them at the speed of a bullet.  Soon, she was ahead.\n\n       &quot;Na na na na na na!&quot; She taunted them, as she continued to fly.\n\n         &quot;I&#39;ll show you!!!&quot; Astral shouted.\n\n          Astral transformed into robot mode in mid-air, and blasted off\nwith his thrusters.\n\n        He was now ahead of all of them.\n\n        Recklessa growled as he passed her.\n\n        &quot;Creep!&quot; She said.  Recklessa pulled out her gatling guns, and fired\nthem straight ahead at Astral, still flying.\n\n         &quot;You wanna turn this into a destruction derby-race?  So be it!!!&quot;\nAstral shouted back.\n\n        He pulled out his rocket launcher, and fired back at Recklessa.\n\n        Fenox and Starlight were now ahead, constantly going ahead of\neachother.\n\n        Fenox leaped on top of Starlight, and brought her down.  He\ncontinued running off then.\n\n        Griplash eventually caught up.  He jumped in the air, and got hold\nof Recklessa&#39;s leg.\n\n       He climbed up onto her back, and started steering her.  They were so\ncaught in this race and everything that they didn&#39;t see the base location\nahead.\n\n        &quot;Stop!!!!!!&quot; Astral said, and fired a blast from his rocket\nlauncher.\n\n      They all stopped.\n\n      &quot;We&#39;re here!&quot; He said.\n\n       They all stopped there, and waited for everybody to arrive.\n\n\n"}}
