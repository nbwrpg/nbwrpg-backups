His eyes sharply ahead and lit with a =\r\nbright ice blue, as he vents his nostrills to remove some of the heat withi=\r\nn his body, as a cooling method.  Steam billows out from the nostrills, coo=\r\nling his temperature readilly.  He gives light only to give him enough to s=\r\nee his path, yet not enough to see deeper into the darkness.  His tail cont=\r\ninues to twitch as his eyes narrow further.\n\n&quot; Tell your master the feeling=\r\n is mutual.  I&#39;m looking forward to meeting him myself. &quot;\n\nHe says quietly =\r\nyet in a tone of sarcasm.  He lifts his head somewhat to balance his body a=\r\n bit more propertly.  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supe=\r\nrcyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson treads carefully down the =\r\nslope and realizes that he needs to grip\n&gt; &gt; the ground with his talons.  S=\r\no with thick claws he does just that, using\n&gt; &gt; his tail for balance.  He t=\r\nhought of using it to swat away the weapons that\n&gt; &gt; were so annoyingly pla=\r\nced around him but his judgement told him otherwise.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There would be=\r\n a good possibility that he might have to tangle with an enemy\n&gt; &gt; more pow=\r\nerful then himself.  Yet he was prepared to do anything for the sake\n&gt; &gt; of=\r\n preservation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Old dragon, could this be why you have guided me h=\r\nere?  This used to be\n&gt; &gt; your kingdom and now you hope that I will continu=\r\ne your legacy?  I hope I\n&gt; &gt; can do that old friend, I hope I can.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;N=\r\nEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no immediate answer to TUCSON&#39;s question as he was led by=\r\n\n&gt; GUILEDART, HARDHEAD and HYDRA down through brush and foliage and\n&gt; acros=\r\ns one path and to the next.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally they reach the clearing that held =\r\nthe strange energy door and\n&gt; stepped through, and immidiately they were al=\r\nl plunged into darkness!\n&gt; \n&gt; The ground beneath TUSCON&#39;s feet changed as h=\r\ne stepped through. On one\n&gt; side there was dirt and soil mixed with leaves =\r\nand discarded branches.\n&gt; On the other side there was the hard and unyieldi=\r\nng feel of cold\n&gt; metal, there was a scratching noise made as TUSCON&#39;s nail=\r\ns raked\n&gt; across it as he attempted to keep the same grip he had outside.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; As they walked overhead lights began to flicker on and TUSCOn could\n&gt; s=\r\nee that he was in a hallway, also made of metal, it had the feel of\n&gt; the i=\r\nnterior of a ship or perhaps a base.\n&gt; \n&gt; They came to a single large door =\r\nthat looked thick enough to stop\n&gt; grimlock and full rage! In front of it a=\r\n single Predacon was standing\n&gt; and he turned to look at GUILDART as he app=\r\nroached. &quot;My my.&quot; He said,\n&gt; a hiss in his voice. &quot;What have we got here?&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; GUILEDART came to a stop, &quot;It is . . . good to see you Rapticon.&quot; He\n&gt;=\r\n said as he bowed his head slightly in greeting. &quot;It is a gift for\n&gt; Magmat=\r\nron.&quot; He said looking at him warilly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind him HARDHEAD and HYDRA ke=\r\npt their weapons trained on TUSCON,\n&gt; but there was a definite fear of this=\r\n creature in front of them as\n&gt; well.\n&gt; \n&gt; RAPTICON looked nearly identicle=\r\n to the transmetaled DINOBOT that\n&gt; MEGATRON had made near the end of the f=\r\nirst Beastwars. He looked like\n&gt; an armored skeletal version with bladed cl=\r\naws, sharp teeth and a\n&gt; glowing mechanical optic that replaced on of his m=\r\nore organic looking\n&gt; ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;He does look tasty.&quot; RAPTICON said as he =\r\nsmiled at TUSCON. &quot;But I do\n&gt; believe that Magmatron will want the pleasure=\r\n of dealing with him\n&gt; himself.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; GUIULEDART nodded, &quot;As I would have s=\r\nurmized.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; RAPTICON gestured at the door as he looked at TUSCON, &quot;Magma=\r\ntron bids\n&gt; you welcome.&quot; Although his words might seem cordial, the tone a=\r\nnd\n&gt; manner from RAPTICON was anything but!. Instead there was his manner\n&gt;=\r\n was that of spider inviting a fly into a web.\n&gt; \n&gt; He chuckled as he stepp=\r\ned aside and the door began to iris open,\n&gt; almost like teeth in some great=\r\n maw opening.\n&gt; \n&gt; NEXT POST: MAGMATRON\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
