Slipping, he slammed into a wall, though his scaly armor \nhelped to protect him.  Raising his plasma launcher, he fired a powerful \nplasma blast striking Perndabot, the Alliance member exploding, his pieces \nslamming into the walls.  A bolt hit him in the leg, the scaly robot sliding \nforward as he fell, slowly getting up, a kick from Zardus sent him crashing \nthe ground.  Looking up, the last thing he saw were the evil faces of the \nAlliance, especially a laughing like mad Nemesis Enforcer, each of the seven \nother robots pulling their triggers, the lasers and plasma bolts tearing \nthrough his armor easily, everything going black. \n\n---------------- \n\nKoga Shuko laughed, seeing the screen on the device reading: 100%, the robot \nfully regenerated.  \n&quot;Now that-&quot;\n\nInterrupted, Serpentor, cloned, screamed, waking up, smashing through the \ndevice, fallin to his knees, slamming his fists on the ground.\n\nShuko looked to Anubis and Hades, the two robots approaching Serpentor.  \nSerpentor jumped forward, tackling Anubis to the ground.  Hades sent a swift \nkick, sending Serpentor to his back, aiming his laser rifle at the somewhat \nconfused robot&#39;s face.\n\n&quot;W...w...what the slag is going on!?&quot; Serpentor growled pulling out his sword \nwith a cobra head-shaped hilt, pointing it at Hades&#39; chest.\n\n&quot;I, am Koga Shuko.  Evidently you died somehow near the Alliance base.  I&#39;ve \ncloned you.  You are mine now.  You will have the honor of conquering the \nuniverse alongside myself and Set.&quot;\n\n&quot;What?!  The last thing I remember...being captured by the Alliance.  Then \nthey attacked.  I self-destructed to try and take some of them out.  Then I&#39;m \nhere.  What exactly are you doing on Earth...&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, errr...&quot;\n\n&quot;I am called Serpentor.&quot;\n\n&quot;Serpentor, I and Set are here to eliminate all the factions on this planet.  \nAnd take the energon.  Then conquer the universe in our time.  Hell Beast is \ndead (a lie), that fool Megatron stole his body and has gone crazy (a lie), \nwho you were obviously serving since you are Predacon and the Alliance killed \nyou, is old news.  Either join with the new Predacon forces here, or join \nyour old team.  I will let you decide.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hmmm...mass murder...Koga Shuko, I remember that name!  You could buy \nplanets like these with only a 10th of your fortune!  Mass murder \nthough...I&#39;m in!&quot;\n\nKoga Shuko and Serpentor shook hands.  &quot;Good, good!  Hades and Anubis, update \nour friend here with everything we know, and show him around.  Give him \nquarters as well.&quot;\n\nHades and Anubis nodded, walking away, Serpentor following.\n\nKoga Shuko was about to talk to Unitron, when recieving BH&#39;s com-link.  &lt;Yes, \nI told you to come here and get it.  Stay there.  If autoguns aim at you, \ndon&#39;t worry.  Merely a precaution for my personal safety.  My assistant will \nbring you the 68 kilos (150 pounds, 30 cubes) of energon cubes&gt; he replied, \nending the transmission.  \n\nUnitron had already left, going down below, lifting the crate thta had been \nfilled, walking off steadily towards BH and his comrade.\n\n===================\n\nAboard a craft of Maximal origin heading for Past Earth, an explosion went \noff in the engines, a bomb destroying them.\n&quot;We&#39;re going down, Bacterium!&quot; Amobeous yelled, slamming forward into the \ncontrols, the ship plunging down towards Earth.\n\n=================\n\nRamhorn sighed, ignoring Prowl&#39;s transmission.  &quot;Just because he&#39;s ordering, \ndoesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s in charge.  Liono will probably come back, and everything \ngoes back to the Pit.  Not for me!&quot; Ramhorn yelled, already at the edge of \nwhat will be known as Florida.\n&quot;Slag!  Dang river.  I better eat before I swim across.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
