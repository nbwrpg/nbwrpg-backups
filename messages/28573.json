He \nreaches into a compartment and draws a rifle, aiming it at \nMotormaster.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t bluff either. Put that Maximal down or you won&#39;t survive the \ntrip back yourself.&quot;\n\nHe glances around the Stunticons, and then at Astroblast. &quot;You can&#39;t \nall fit in that shuttle, and I can garauntee that I can catch any \nthat are left behind. Besides, the other Maximals will aid me. Give \nme the Maximal and I will give you safe passage. Otherwise, quite a \nfew of you will die.&quot;\n\nHe looks at Motormaster for the bot&#39;s reply. The four circling \nmissiles were ready to plunge down at Motormaster. Element was \ngetting ready to do a mental manuever.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Menasor looks around, having problems understanding the \nsituation, &quot;Why\n&gt; Menasor not just kill Maximal then&quot; he says in a low growl of a \nvoice, &quot;and\n&gt; we kill the one at base tooo&quot; he screamed threteningly. He then \ndisingaged,\n&gt; in a complex transformation, and flash of light, his legs turned \ninto\n&gt; Speedbreaker and Wildrider, who started to float again, and \nWildrider had\n&gt; an ugly smile, with half of his face missing, yet he was grinning \nwith\n&gt; glee. The middle section becomes Motormaster, and he grabs Firearm, \non\n&gt; hovers to land on top of Astroblast, and puts his cyclone gun to \nthe robots\n&gt; head. Meanwhile Dead-End and Drag Strip transform, Drag Strip \nstarts to\n&gt; soar, but the charred out body of Dead-End starts to plummet, \nmotionless,\n&gt; straight into Speedbreakers grip, who holds him firmly in mid air. \n(Okay\n&gt; rAuq, theyre yours again). &quot;Seriously Maximal, we have enough \nequipment in\n&gt; Astroblast to patch him up to survive the trip. And I am not \nbluffing, if\n&gt; we cant take him back to base, then he dies, as well as the other, \ndo you\n&gt; really want to be held responsible for two Maximals deaths, hah, \nthat&#39;s not\n&gt; very Maximal of you. And I dont bluff&quot; screamed Motormaster with \nfury in\n&gt; his eyes, he had had enough, and except for minor damage to his \nback and\n&gt; neck, and a hole in his front, he was fine, and more than capable \nof firing\n&gt; quickly.\n\n\n"}}
