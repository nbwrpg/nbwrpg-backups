She was just \nwondering \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking rather lost and not sure of where to go.  She \n&gt; &gt; eventually \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found the Med bays and went to the console.

THe original bot \n&gt; &gt; known \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nightlight had been here. Was reprogrammed and into \nanother \n&gt; &gt; bot. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was about to find the name when she heard a noise. She \nclosed \n&gt; &gt; out \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer terminal and made a rather loud sigh. &quot;Drat.

Her head low and her shoulders \ndrooping \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bit, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just incase someone was watching.\n\n\n"}}
