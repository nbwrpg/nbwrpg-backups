He \n&gt; stops just after he avoided the shots, but his arm hurt and he \ntries \n&gt; to stand up. Also, with the venom in him, he starts to see in a \n&gt; blurred way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar: Kup, Rodimus, Windlord, anyone... I am going down. I need \n&gt; backup now!\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang held his hand at Katya. She understood the motion and \nstood \n&gt; there, with her aim steady.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: How about you join us?

Riekan kicks at Ragnar, hoping to drive him \nback a \n&gt; &gt; bit, and fires again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The shots pepper Pumpskin&#39;s hide, but fail to \npenetrate.  &#39;Relative&#39; \n&gt; &gt; leaves a lot open, and the warrior&#39;s weak points are still \ntough.  \n&gt; &gt; When he hears what Blackfang has to say, he stops and thinks \nabout \n&gt; &gt; it.  &quot;You know, that&#39;s a very good point.

A searing burn \nran \n&gt; &gt; &gt; across his arm, but he managed to twist enough to fire his \nGauss \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fury. The slug went straight at the knife, which would break \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inevitably, and past it at Fury.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The blond Clansman looked at his limb and saw it in a bloddy \n&gt; &gt; metallic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mess. Adrenaline was still high, but he would not last.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya saw a breach and fired between the tentacles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang leaped back and out of most of the tentacles way. \n&gt; &gt; However, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his shotgun was taken out of his grip. He drew his pulse laser \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fired small quick shots as near as he could to the gash.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang: Why the hell are you doing this then?
