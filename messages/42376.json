Well...it should be.  It was \ncompletely artificially automated.*\n\n&quot; We&#39;ve lost contact with Prototype 13.&quot;\n\n* The second of the white clad male robots, a rather stumpy one at that, \nsneered before glancing up.*\n\n&quot; And exactly when did THIS happen?&quot;\n\n* The tall figure appeared disappointed.*\n\n&quot; We lost communications with Proto 13 about the same time as the Delta \nTrica was reported to have gone down.&quot;\n\n&quot; I see...&quot; * the stumpy man sighed before turning his attentions to the \nmost silent of the trio, one whom seemed deep in thought.\nThe slim figure, known well as Kere, eyed his built assosiate before \nreturning Brisa&#39;s glance. Soon returning his gaze to the younger of the \nthree.*\n\n&quot; What&#39;s on your mind, Beld?&quot;\n\n* Beld, a rather build young transformer whom had just been reassigned from \nthe Sirose millitary to it&#39;s scientific frounteer only 7 yours ago, stood \nonly a few inches less then Kere. Though his mind was just as sharp, despice \nthe gap in years between the two.\nBeld seemed to be jerked into reality at the mention of his name before \neyeing Kere and Brisa, soon bringing his hand to his chin and resting his \nhead upon it.*\n\n&quot; Just thinkin.&quot;\n\n* Brisa scowled.* &quot; Well?!&quot;\n\n* Beld sighed.*\n\n&quot; Is there any sign of whether Proto 13&#39;s active or not?&quot;\n\n* Kere shook his head.*\n\n&quot; No. Not even it&#39;s spark signature has been registered on any of the \nscanners since the disappearence of that ship it was assigned to.&quot;\n\n&quot; Unfortunate...&quot; * Brisa snorted before peering back into the lifeless blue \neyes of the image that stared at him from the console screen. Soon to turn \nhis back to the computer and his comrads.*\n\n&quot; If you ask me, if it&#39;s still alive it should be terminated. There&#39;s no \ntelling of what might happen if it&#39;s still active. &quot;\n\n&quot; We&#39;ve spent alot of money and time on this, Brisa. I don&#39;t think we can \nafford to kill this experiement before we retreve proof that it&#39;s \ndefective.&quot; * Kere retorted rather sharply. So, in fact, that even Beld \nturned to look at the blank expressions of his fellow scientist.\nThough, Brisa only shrugged.*\n\n&quot; We&#39;ll see what the Grand Destroyer has to say about this.&quot;\n\n* Beld jerked to life.*\n\n&quot; Brisa! You can&#39;t! Proto is a sentient being! She&#39;s ALIVE!  You can&#39;t just \ndecide to kill her like it&#39;s nothing any differne then putting out the weeks \ntrash!&quot;\n\n* Brisa chuckled coldly before half turning towards the stressed young bot, \ncompletely covered in shadow.*\n\n&quot; What&#39;s what you&#39;re saying, Kid. You might end up nipping off a little more \nthen you can handle. &quot;\n\n* Quickly turning his back to the soldier the stubby bot headed towards the \nexit to the room.* &quot; THEN we&#39;ll see who can and can&#39;t do what.&quot;\n\n* Silence filled the dark room soon after Brisa&#39;s leaving before the sound \nof armor striking a metallic surface shattered all.\nKere shook his head as Beld pulled his fist back from a fair sized dent in \nthe wall.*\n\n&quot; That pompus ass!&quot;  * Beld cursed before abruptly turning towards Kere.*\n\n&quot; I can&#39;t believe he can even consider such a thing! We worked SO HARD on \nthat Prototype! Used eqiptment that you can&#39;t even find in this sector \nwithout slitting someones throat...and he wants to throw all of that away? &quot;\n\n* Kere sighed.* &quot; I know. I don&#39;t wanna see the end of this project any more \nthen you do...but if Brisa gets his way with the Grand Destroyer...we&#39;ll \nhave no choice other then to pull the plug on Proto 13.&quot;\n\n* Beld closed his optics and clenched his jaw.\nThe Grand Destroyer&#39;s decision was FINAL.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
