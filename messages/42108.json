There was another bot! How the hell did he get there?, \nwondered Iss. \n&gt; Iss breifly considered possibilities. Chances were pretty slim that \nthe robot \n&gt; had just &quot;woken up&quot; from some years-long slumber, and thus been \npreviously \n&gt; missing on sensors. That could be the messenger of another faction.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Vorb&quot; sent Iss. &quot;That bot in the clearing may be another potential \nally.

[Let&#39;s go.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Iss took hold over VorbIss&#39;s cooperative systems, and walked \nVorbIss to the \n&gt; hatch controls. Iss found the &quot;Open&quot; button and pressed it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iss spoke throught the semi-open hatch entrance. &quot;Robot, do you \nread me? I am \n&gt; VorbIss. Who are you, and what is your faction?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Vorb::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Robot, do you read me? I am VorbIss.

Closer analysis of Iss, \nthrough \n&gt; their neural link, revealed a small issue, however: Iss was loyal \nto \n&gt; protecting the body. Vorb himself, the spark, was Iss&#39;s second \npriority.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vorb gently guided a nano-bot control tendril into position above \nIss&#39;s \n&gt; cognitive processors. He took aim. He pushed.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Iss::\n&gt; \n&gt; Pain! Pain! Pain!

Glitches in his software suddenly \nappearing. \n&gt; And through it all, Iss&#39;s changing processors experienced \neverything. It \n&gt; occured to Iss that Vorb was taking over his mind, and that he had \n&gt; underestimated the spark. That soon Iss would cease to exist, and \nso would \n&gt; Vorb, both merging to become the entity VorbIss. This did not \nsurprise Iss, \n&gt; though; It was like a law of nature. As taken-for-granted as \ngravity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iss shuddered, then suddenly was not Iss.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::VorbIss::\n&gt; \n&gt; The weird contortions of his face finally finished, what with the \nmessy \n&gt; business of melding Iss&#39;s mind into his, VorbIss analized his \nsituation. He \n&gt; had a taser, a laser, and a shuttle to hide in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Through the open shuttle doors, he took aim at the bot which had \nstumbled in. \n&gt; &quot;Halt. I am VorbIss, poly-consolidated intelligent robot. Explain \nyourself.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; VorbIss really really didn&#39;t want to fire. He had to act tough, of \ncourse, \n&gt; but the energy a taser shot would cost him would be too much.\n&gt; \n&gt; VorbIss waited for a reply form the haggard bot.\n\n\n"}}
