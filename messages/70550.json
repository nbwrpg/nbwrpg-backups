He knew that going too fast could upset the stru=\r\ncture even weaken it to the point of breaking, which he did not want to do.=\r\n He continues steadilly, sensing that Vestige was growing weak once more. G=\r\nently, he begins to take control of his own wheel, and goes in the directio=\r\nn of where he&#39;s being led.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s all right old friend, you have given m=\r\ne the course, I can take it from here. Rest now. I promise we will reach th=\r\ne chamber in time for you to be repaired.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With each word Tucson speaks=\r\n, his voice changes ever so slightly, sounding more and more like Optimus P=\r\nrime. Still he himself has no idea that he was ever related to the great Au=\r\ntobot leader. All he knew is that he admired him greatly not only as his co=\r\nmmander, but as a mentor during his younger years as a rookie Autobot. Tucs=\r\non could now sense some changes within himself, not only on the outside, bu=\r\nt on the inside as well. He could have turned to fight whatever onslaught w=\r\nas following him, yet he chose not to, and chose to save a life over taking=\r\n one. It was a choice he felt very good about and had no regrets to his dec=\r\nision.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Tuscon moved foward the trip was fairly easy at first. Th=\r\ne walls\nand floor were smooth and well made. The halls, while somewhat dim\n=\r\nwere still well lit, especially with the help of his headlights. And\nwhile =\r\nweak Vesitge still tried to hold on, slightly guiding Tuscon via\nthe sterri=\r\nng wheel to tell him which turns to make and how fast to go.\n\nHowever as ti=\r\nme went on it was easy to see that Vestige was still\nslipping away, his hol=\r\nd on the wheel becoming more and more slack as\ntime went on. Also the stran=\r\nge things is that the walls and floor were\nchanging with distance as well. =\r\nThe metal deckplating was becoming\nrougher and rougher, going from the silv=\r\ner and grey of metal to the\nbrown and blacks of something strange almost ch=\r\nitinous or shell like.\nThe walls began to take on a decidely dark brown cas=\r\nt, and instead of\nthier smooth gleaming surface they began to get rough and=\r\n jagged,\nalmost like claws and thorns that sometimes forced Tuscon to slow =\r\ndown\nto navigate around them.\n\nOutside the vehicle the ominous buzzing soun=\r\nd was getting louder and\nlouder as Tuscon moved foward, while inside his ca=\r\nb Vestige weakly\ngestured and tried to help. The tunnel straightened as Tus=\r\ncon drove,\nbut it had also gotten steadily darker and more dangerous, the g=\r\nround\nbeneath him now feeling more like earth and stone than metal. However=\r\n\nahead of him he could see a gleaming light. It was as if a door\nsuddenly o=\r\npened at the end of a long hall and a light that beckoned\nTuscon towards it=\r\n, but if it was to victory or destruction it was\ndifficult to tell.\n\nOutsid=\r\ne Tuscon could hear comming from the direction of the light the\nclear voice=\r\n of Rodimus, &quot;I AM HERE! DRIVE TUSCON! DRIVE!&quot;\n\nMeanwhile Inside Tuscon&#39;s c=\r\nab Vestige slumped over, even as several\nlarge insect-spider like creatures=\r\n seem to melt out from the darkness\nin front of the door and stand guard ov=\r\ner it.\n\n&quot;We are the horde, and you will go no further!!&quot; The creatures rush=\r\n\nfoward to attack!\n\n(TAG)\n\n"}}
