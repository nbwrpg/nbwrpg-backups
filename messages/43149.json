Yawning and rubbing her optics.  She \nopened a small thigh compartment and took out the last of her energon \nsupply.  After breakfast, she continued to walk east.  She followed \nthe mountain trail untill she finally came to the flat lands. She saw \na great desert open up before her.  She saw the sunlight shine up \nfrom the white, sunbleached sand and earth. &quot;How any bot can make it \nhere is beyond me.&quot;  She looked at her scanner, but it was still \nfried.  She tried to use her commlink, but it wouldn&#39;t be able to \nrecieve any transmissions. Only send.  She sat down on a stone and \ntook out her small tool kit.  She figured she wasn&#39;t in a hurry to \nget anywhere, so she tried to fix her scanner and link. \nUnfortunately, she needed a few parts in order to fully repair them.  \nSo she would do the best she could and try to make them work if they \nwould work at all.  \n\n\n"}}
