Nothing really looked good, \nbut she was hungry.  She picked a small energon cube and decided a \nquick recharge was better than really enjoying a meal.  She got a \nglass of water and sat down at a table near the door.  She looked at \nher glass and stared at the water in it.  She was thinking about how \nthe clone was made.  Could she make her own clone? COuld she clone \nother warriors?  She saw the advantage that clones offered.  But \nthen, she knew that one day, one clone would exceed it&#39;s programs and \ntake over.  The thought of clones running the world made her shiver, \nas the cold chill of fear ran up her back.  She had the distinct \nthought that what ever was going to happen, she couldn&#39;t let Megatron \nget away with making clones.\n\n\n"}}
