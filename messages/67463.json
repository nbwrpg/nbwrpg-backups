Cyclonus&#39; armor by this time is looking\nmuch the worse for wear, cracks, dents and scorch marks mar its once\npurple and silver hues, and yet he still looks confident as he takes a\nmoment to assess his opponant. \n\nThen with a sudden burst of power he leaped out of the water, his legs\nmerging as he converts to his robot-hover mode. With a small smile he\ntargets his cannon at Rodimus, and with a thought he fires a simple\nelectrical pulse at Rodimus, knowing that even should he miss, the salt\nwater would still carry the electrical current right to Rodimus as long\nas he was still close!\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus)\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better pen pal. \nText or chat with friends inside Yahoo!
