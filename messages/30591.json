He smiles, at their want\nto spread destruction. That&#39;s what he wanted. Motormaster walked by with\nWildrider, and was about to leave, when Megatron addressed him.\n&quot;Motormaster, what were you in the middle of doing when I arrived here?&quot; he\nquestioned. &quot;Why, we were looking for you mighty Megatron. You and the\nother Decepticons.&quot; Megatron thought. Yes, he wanted some of them back,\n&quot;They would be on the Ark, right&quot; he said. Motormaster responded. &quot;That&#39;s\nwhat we gathered, but when we got there the Maximals stopped us.&quot; Megatron\ngave him a solution. &quot;Then, we will have to eliminate them from the\nequation. Bodicons, go and bring in the metal that Astroblast unloaded. In\na bit I will have a mission for you.&quot; he said, and walked towards the\ncomputer screen. &quot;Computer, open up all info on the Maximals.&quot;\n\n\n\nOOC: Would it be moding for Megatron to read about Iron Raptor, and the others?\n\n\n\n"}}
