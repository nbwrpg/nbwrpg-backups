That is one possible weakness... Late\n&gt; Lincoln Osis, the \n&gt; last Smoke Jaguar, had won his position as a Khan\n&gt; and then as Ilkhan. \n&gt; He was a tactical Genius, but his lack of strategic\n&gt; thinking got his \n&gt; Clan wiped out by the Inner Sphere forces. However,\n&gt; we train our \n&gt; warriors so that they understand strategies as well\n&gt; as tactics. In \n&gt; your case though, I will support you and help you\n&gt; with strategies, and \n&gt; I hope so will Ragnar. That man is a\n&gt; strategic-planner born.

Should\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; win, you would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; prove that you are a better warrior than your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; officer, thus proving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She paused, then started moving back to the\n&gt; base.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She waved him to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; follow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Now about the Kerenskys... They are the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; founders of all Clans, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the makers of our society and one of the most,\n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not the most revered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bloodline among all Clans. Some of us maintain\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our duty as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Warriors is to protect the Inner Sphere. We\n&gt; oppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Crusaders \n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying it is a desecrated place and that it\n&gt; deserves\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conquered and brought back up into a stronger\n&gt; Clan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; society. It is all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation of the words of Nicholas\n&gt; Kerensky,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the first Ilkhan, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and it has led many to die, both among and\n&gt; outside\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Clans.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She closed her eyes remembered all too well the\n&gt; two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days she had spent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; evading the massive ComGuard battlemechs at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Great battle of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tukkayid.

Destroying a forest is the kind\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing that debalances \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a world&#39;s environment needlessly.

The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forces meeting in a Trial meet in a\n&gt; circle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equals. This way, we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight zellbringen, single combat.

The second reason for Trials\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevents waste.
