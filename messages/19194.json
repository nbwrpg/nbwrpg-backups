According to the scans Kitkat was a few hundred yards away at a \nbase of somekind. Nighteyes was also waiting there.\n    &quot;Call Nighteyes, that little traitor will die at my hands!&quot; Megatron \nsaid, brandishing his tail gun. He looked at his group, who were well amred \nand anxious to get back at Kitkat.\n    &quot;You do realize, now that youre out in the open, she can detect you on \nscans?&quot; Hell Beast said in a very matter-of-fact way. His rivalry for \nleadership was clear.\n    He said nothing in return, and then began to march. Waspinator buzzed \nnext to him, &quot;Megatron, wont wolf bot be surprized when we crush her?&quot;\n    &quot;Of course, idiot! Thats the point! Now, Waspinator and Aquarious attack \nfrom above, Gremlin and Hell Beast will go from the east, Padletail and I \nshall go from the north. Now go!&quot; Megatron barked as the Predacons split up \nand began the assult on Kitkats base. The element of surprize was a deadly \nweapon.\n\n    Black Aracnia yelled into her comlnk, &quot;Cyber Claw, dont bother coming \nback. I dont want you on this team anymore, personally, I think your a self \nindulged hipocrate that will get yourself killed. If I ever catch you around \nmy base agian.....I will kill you myself.&quot; And then slammed down her commlink.\n    &quot;Commander?&quot; Paralysis said, a bit nervous at her temper that had \nsuddenly reappeared.\n    &quot;Quickstrike! I will give the commands around here! Not you! Now, take \nRat Trap and question him. I want details. As for the rest of you, suit up \nand get ready for battle. The Ark isnt going to be rebuilt, not while Im a \nPredacon still breathing.&quot; She narrowed her eyes, as if to say the rise was \nover, no longer was she the compasinate female leader.....she was the cold \nbitch who wasnt going to let anything, or anyone, stand in her way.\n\n"}}
