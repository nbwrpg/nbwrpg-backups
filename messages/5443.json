Most of the \nteam was killed in the crash, or the battle before or after. Rescued \nby the Alliance (this was back when the Maximals and the Alliance \nwere closely allied), Striker and his team joined the Maximals. The \nonly surviving and active member remaining in his team is Prowl (the \nrest were either killed, or have quit, or have just stopped RPGing).\n\n\n"}}
