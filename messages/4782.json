It was a rabbit \nmound.  She waited until it came out.  The rabbit saw her and went back in \nthe hole before she could strike.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; she said with a sigh, &quot;looks like that lunch opertunity went out the \nwindow.&quot;\nShe loped along looking for something else to munch on.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
