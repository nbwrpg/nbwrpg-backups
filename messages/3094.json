Scanning the surface, he identified a mass energy\n&gt; signature, the Ark.  Already passing the ozone layer, he was visible from\nthe\n&gt; ground now, barely.  All that could be seen without zoomed vision was a\n&gt; bright, small dot in the sky.  Checking his scanners, Shockwave was 5000\n&gt; miles and closing quickly on the Ark.  4600.  3980.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Name: Shockwave\n&gt; Gender: Male\n&gt; Alternate Modes: Ray Gun, space fighter\n&gt; Side: None (OTHER, NOT NEUTRAL)\n&gt;\n&gt; Character History:\n&gt;\n&gt; Almost completely based on his namesake, Shockwave the leader of the\n&gt; Decepticon Empire in G1 Megatron&#39;s absence while on Earth, he was created\nin\n&gt; two hundred years ago.  Made by the Tripredacus Council in hopes of a new\n&gt; general, their plan backfired, Shockwave despising them for not being\n&gt; Decepticon, which technically he was.  Totally obliterating  the war\nfactory\n&gt; where he was forged, he declared an all out war on the Tripredacus\nCouncil,\n&gt; in turn unintentionally helping the Maximal Elders in their own agendas.\n&gt; Adding a second mode, a space fighter, to his transformation capabilities,\n&gt; Shockwave escaped, the Tripredacus Council and Maximal Elders in a joint\n&gt; mission were trying to kill him.  Reaching past Earth, a place where most\n&gt; feared to tread, he decided to make his conquests there.  Not joining any\nof\n&gt; the factions, he found them all to be pathetic and irrelevant.\n&gt;\n&gt; Character Personality:\n&gt;\n&gt; Cold and brutal, he likes to take a scientific approach to war most of the\n&gt; time, though sometimes he will go on murderous instincts.  Is sometimes\n&gt; confounded by emotional and rash thinking.\n&gt;\n&gt; Character Stats:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Clarity of thought before rashness of action.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Function: Ground Descruction and Air/Space Support\n&gt;\n&gt; Strength: 9.5\n&gt; Intelligence: 10\n&gt; Speed: 7\n&gt; Endurance: 7\n&gt; Rank: 9\n&gt; Courage: 9\n&gt; Firepower: 9\n&gt; Skill: 10\n&gt;\n&gt; Alternate Mode Descriptions:\n&gt;\n&gt; Space Fighter:\n&gt;\n&gt; Purple and blue, the cone has a spike extending from the point.  Maximum\n&gt; speed is Mach 5 and the Max range is 800,000 miles in a planet&#39;s\natmosphere,\n&gt; Mach 10 in space with a range of 2 million miles.  With a variety of\n&gt; missiles, he also has laser weaponry, which makes his arsenal deadly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ray Gun:\n&gt;\n&gt; Can fire deadly laser blasts, gamma rays, light, infra-red, radio waves,\nand\n&gt; x-rays.  Along with many more.  Has flight capabilties in the purple ray\ngun\n&gt; mode.\n&gt;\n&gt; Robot Mode Description:\n&gt;\n&gt; Almost completely purple, his single yellow optic in the middle of his\nhead\n&gt; gives him a wide variety of visions (check all vision capabilities in ray\ngun\n&gt; description).  With a laser weapon that extends instead of a hand on his\n&gt; right hand joint, it can be a hand or laser weapon.  In subspace he\npossesses\n&gt; energon, a repairing unit, a missile launcher, charges, and a laser rifle.\nA\n&gt; large purple Decepticon symbol rests on his chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Never lose a file again.
