Oh, um, just ta let ya \n&gt; know, we have a comrade down here who is visually impaired, he might need \n&gt; some extra help getting out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson walks forward, now able to use his sonar system.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; He&#39;s right, I&#39;m visually impaired, but just tell me where I can get a \n&gt; foot and a hand hold, and I might just be able to get myself out of here. \n&gt; I attempted something I call the inverted spider maneuver.  If I can do \n&gt; that, I might just be able to get out of here myself.  A little bit of \n&gt; ninjabot training.
