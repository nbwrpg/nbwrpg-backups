It&#39;s mainly used to carry viruses and can infect over a \nlong distance. Or...can be loaded with an antivirus.\nEither way it can carry a counter to that chip which was fired.\nSame with this weapon...&quot;\n\n* Iris displayed it as well and the other after that, all weapons cappable \nof carrying the counter.\nThen she began to display the programs.*\n\n&quot; These are all modified counterviruses...as well as default programs.\nThey basically can either wipe clean the programming that the viction has \nrecieved...or can kill them in the process.\nIt&#39;s a delicate process, one that takes time.\nThe programs have to be loaded properly in order for them to do their \njob...and not kill.&quot;\n\n* Iris knew that SHE could load the program so that it would work, she did \nhave the precision of a calculated geniouse...after all.\nBut, she would have to make a weaponry holding stand with nano-probs, and it \nwould only take about 3 mega-cycles at the longest.*\n\n______________________________Zyber.\n\n* Zyber watched as the beast drained the cup, her eyes wide.\nHow could he just gizzle it like that, it was strong as the Pit...and it \neven took her hours to finish.*\n\n&quot; Uh...I think you were attacked. I...uh...just found you in stasis lock on \nthe forest floor at dusk.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
