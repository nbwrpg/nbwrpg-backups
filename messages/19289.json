She stared, looking at\n&gt; the necklace.\n&gt; She looked at Devilduer.&quot;I wonder, would putting her\n&gt; into a deep \n&gt; stasis lock possably help her? I can&#39; do that, but\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how \n&gt; she would react to it.  See, my venom is designed to\n&gt; put the victim \n&gt; into a very deep stasis in one bite. It&#39;s the second\n&gt; bite that kills. \n&gt; So one bite might settle her down enough to were we\n&gt; can get that \n&gt; thing off her. What do you say?&quot;\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Messenger - Talk while you surf!
