Before I was rendered blind, we&#39;d do many \n&gt; missions side by side.  Of course, him being Hot Rod, a sports vehcile and \n&gt; me, an average compact SUV, off roading vehicle, with no interest in \n&gt; speed, we&#39;d often kid each other about speed versus rugged durability over \n&gt; off road terrain.  One day, we were driving toward a mission to stop \n&gt; Galvatron&#39;s path of destruction, when our path got blasted by unknown \n&gt; enemy fire.  We knew we couldn&#39;t let a rock slide stop us, and we didn&#39;t. \n&gt; I knew I could&#39;ve just drove over it, and gotten to the other side with no \n&gt; problem. But Rodimus wasn&#39;t built for that in his alt form.  We never left \n&gt; each other&#39;s side that day.  We found a way to get around that obsticle \n&gt; together, even though we had conflicting ideas on how to do it, but, \n&gt; eventually we did compromise and we thwarted Galvatron with the aid of the \n&gt; other Autobots.  Sometimes opposites work well together, and Rodimus \n&gt; proved it that day.  I guess that&#39;s what drove me to rescue him. I \n&gt; couldn&#39;t think of how I would manage, if I had not had him by my side.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gently rubs Elita&#39;s shoulders.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I wish I could remember what happened to Bumblebee and Spike, and \n&gt; Kremzeem, but after I was rendered off line for several vorns, I lost a \n&gt; good portion of my memory. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Like Rodimus, Tucson&#39;s gentile embrace takes on a paternal aspect. He \n&gt; holds Elita as if she were his own.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; And don&#39;t you worry about your mother, Stanton will find a way to bring \n&gt; her back, I&#39;m sure of it.  But you also have to keep that hope alive in \n&gt; your heart.  The more hope, the more chances of her healing.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson was now swapping his status to a more parental role.  It felt good \n&gt; to be with Elita, and right at this moment, he wasn&#39;t about to trade that \n&gt; joy with anything else.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elita:ow\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elita took Tucson&#39;s Hand as a lost child seeking  a friend, she was in \n&gt;&gt; her\n&gt;&gt; robot mode that had a strong look of Nightlight with the golden-red \n&gt;&gt; colors\n&gt;&gt; of Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Mom told me that story... and other ones...

He smiles. He knew who it was.

I&#39;m sure your father won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mind you spending a little time with your Uncle.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As large as he was, there was still an air of extreme gentility in his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; body language.  He had many things he wanted to share with her, one of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; them being Optimus Prime&#39;s legacy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; You&#39;re looking at the most legendary Autobot leader of all time. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; This\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is Optimus Prime, created and restorred by Alpha Trion vorns ago. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Before\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he became the great leader that he was, he went by the name, of Orion \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Pax,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a brave Autobot who didn&#39;t believe in giving up without a fight.  One \n&gt;&gt; &gt; day,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Orion Pax suffered greatly in battle, and was brought  to Alpha trion\n&gt;&gt; &gt; where he became Optimus Prime.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;There are so many things I never got to ask you. One of them being,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; how does one find the perfect balance between trust and loyalty? And\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; how does one find peace in an atmosphere full of tension? But most \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all Optimus, our paths appear to be the same, our values, our \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; courage,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; our strength and our faith in those around us. Are our origins \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; alike?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If so, is there a direction I should be going toward? One that will\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; help me to guide the Autobots and Maximals to finding the road \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; toward\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; peaceful existance? If anyone would know these answers, you would.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He puts a tiny orb of his own spark into a container, and gives it \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an offering to Optimus Prime.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The body and form of Optimus Prime remained absolutely still, there\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was no discernable movement from him, no spark of energy, no sign of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; recognition of any type. It could be that the Matrix energy that had\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; been animate before has been temporarily used up, or perhaps the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; situation now was not sufficiently critical so as to call it into\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; being. In either case Optimus prime looked, for all intents and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; purposes, as dead as any robot can appear and still be awaiting a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rebirth in another few million years.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
