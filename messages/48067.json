Blackfang, maximize!\n\nHe transformed to robot mode, reached for something in his back with \nboth hands and produced a large halberd and a mean-looking shotgun. He \naimed the ground with the shotgun and fired an energy blast. It made a \nhole in the rocky ground.\n\nBlackfang: This may actually work. If we blast our way deep enough, I \ncan then dig with my halberd when we get close to the pod... What do \nyou think? Is it too risky?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks around.
