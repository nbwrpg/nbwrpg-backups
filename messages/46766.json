To my \neyes just \n&gt; by saying that you are stating you are a moder. And then in your \nlast post \n&gt; you said &quot;Like heck your taking down one of my charachters&quot; which \nalso points \n&gt; to you moding. Thank you dewboy for once again proving that you \ntruly are \n&gt; nothing but an annoyance who can&#39;t RP his way out of a trash can \nwithout \n&gt; moding.\n&gt; \n&gt; IC:\n&gt; Being that thirst is on theground and void is standing, the kick \nstrikes void \n&gt; at the chest causing him to stumble back a bit. In retaliation Void \nopens \n&gt; fire with his laser blaster at Thirsts back, firing seven shots.\n\n\n"}}
