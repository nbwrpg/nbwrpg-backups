She wanted to know that she would give a sign of trust.\n&gt; She looked over and smiled at Malice. Her optics gave him a loving\n&gt; flash, then she looked at her two new comrads in arms. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HA!  Is that all you got?

You disappoint me, ha ha ha haa!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?  Yahoo!
