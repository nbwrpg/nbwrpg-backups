Such as not only will \n&gt; there be a few major storylines, but I believe that there should \n&gt; also be free-form side storylines - to this I&#39;m sure many would \n&gt; agree. I think this lies halfway between &quot;Normal free form&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;Organized free form&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Enter your vote today!
