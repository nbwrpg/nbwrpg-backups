Red like the=\r\n landscape it flew from, it \nrose \n&gt;  &gt;  into \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  the air. Then with =\r\na smooth twist of hue it turned black as \n&gt;  the \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  shadows of space=\r\n enveloped it. Like some black fog hunter-\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  terminators, or sweeps =\r\nas some call them, along with their \n&gt;  leader \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Scourge, gathered =\r\nthemselves under the direction of the \nmighty \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Cyclonus.

But as always a few cones were point=\r\ned \n&gt;  skyward, \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  always on the look out for Minions. What they saw=\r\n today the \n&gt;  &gt;  computers \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  had no way to understand. Something t=\r\nhat was there and yet \nnot \n&gt;  &gt;  there. \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  The slightest bit of dis=\r\ntortion, that under normal \n&gt;  circumstances \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  would have been igno=\r\nred, but in this case was large, and \nworse \n&gt;  &gt;  yet, \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  it was mo=\r\nving. (OOC: Think of Predator&#39;s invisibility when \nhe \n&gt;  &gt;  moved) \n&gt;  &gt;  =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  A yellow warning light began to go off in the pacifist \ncomman=\r\nd \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  center, as the computer screen automatically projected \ncourse =\r\n\n&gt;  and \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  heading. Approximated heading: Atlantis. Unfortunately no=\r\n \none \n&gt;  was \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  there to notice.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  On the grounds =\r\nof Atlantis the pursuit of Trelos continues \nas \n&gt;  &gt;  several \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Ma=\r\nximals attempt to retrieve the rather elusive Predacon \nfrom \n&gt;  his \n&gt;  &gt; =\r\n &gt;  newest hiding spot, underwater. One boat is on the water \n&gt;  &gt;  obvious=\r\nly \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  searching, while a floating car hovers over the waters \ndoing =\r\n\n&gt;  its \n&gt;  &gt;  own \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  search. Meanwhile Rodimus has noted a rather o=\r\ndd dot in the \n&gt;  &gt;  skies, \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  one that he can see to be a Predacon =\r\neagle. He is pointing \nat \n&gt;  it. \n&gt;  &gt;  And \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  even as he is doing =\r\nthis he notes something strange coming \n&gt;  from \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  behind the eagle.=\r\n The sky for a moment seems to flash and \n&gt;  ripple, \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  almost like =\r\nlightning, and yet there is a slight rotation \nto \n&gt;  the \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  flashes=\r\n. \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  In the skies above the eagle looks down noting Rodimu=\r\ns \n&gt;  pointing \n&gt;  &gt;  at \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  him, and he begins to drop out of the sk=\r\nies moving out over \n&gt;  open \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  water, preparing either to flee, or =\r\ndo a strafing run. In \n&gt;  either \n&gt;  &gt;  case \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  he is totally unawar=\r\ne of what is transpiring over his head.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  On the grounds b=\r\nelow Rodimus can see what is coming as his \n&gt;  &gt;  enhanced \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  vision=\r\n sees two very tiny dots spiraling out from the \nrippling \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  flashes=\r\n. At the same time Klaxons begin to go off as base \n&gt;  &gt;  computers \n&gt;  &gt;  =\r\n&gt;  do actually recognize this threat: MISSILES!\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Erupting=\r\n out of the skies, twin missiles streak across the \n&gt;  skies, \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  vor=\r\ntexes of flames spiraling after them like crimson, cone \n&gt;  shaped \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;=\r\n  contrails. They slam into communication towers, and the \ntowers \n&gt;  as \n&gt;=\r\n  &gt;  &gt;  well as a few outlying buildings burst into flames. \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;=\r\n  &gt;  In the background, almost unnoticed, a Myrmidon spirals out \nof \n&gt;  &gt; =\r\n the \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  skies, the recipient of several laser blasts. Small gouts \no=\r\nf \n&gt;  &gt;  flames \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  flowing from him even as he impacts the water. My=\r\nrmidon \nsinks \n&gt;  &gt;  beneath \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  the waves.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  And fl=\r\nying from amidst this bombardment Cyclonus rises high \n&gt;  into \n&gt;  &gt;  the \n=\r\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  air.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &quot;The days you have known are over.
