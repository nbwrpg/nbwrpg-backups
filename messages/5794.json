It&#39;s in case someone gets\n&gt; ambitious\n&gt; &gt; while they think the crew is distarcted with your\n&gt; &gt; presence. I just had every compartment sealed\n&gt; leading\n&gt; &gt; below decks.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &quot; Will that stop them?&quot; Megatron asked.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &quot;Of course,&quot; Panzertron said,&quot; Every door is\n&gt; locked\n&gt; &gt; with a duracypertrioum lock. It&#39;s unhackable with\n&gt; out\n&gt; &gt; setting off the ship&#39;s alarms. Each door is a\n&gt; meter\n&gt; &gt; thick, so they won&#39;t blast through them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Megatron nodded,&quot; Seems you like precaution.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &quot;More then you know,&quot; Panzertron said. He waved\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; hand around thie bridge,&quot; This ship is secure\n&gt; against\n&gt; &gt; anything, given time. Anyone attacking will have\n&gt; only\n&gt; &gt; minicylces to make sure it works before the ship\n&gt; &gt; defenses kick in. Unless of course the oppoents of\n&gt; &gt; this world are very creative.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &quot;Don&#39;t be over confident,&quot; Megatron said,&quot; The\n&gt; &gt; opponets of this world are creative.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -OOC- Panzertron is boasting about his ship.
