This day, in\n1999,\n&gt; we began the epic story of the Neo Beasts Wars. Over time we have lost\n&gt; members, banished members, and gained members. Lets hope that this RPG\nwill\n&gt; continue onward and get even more successful. As for the standout players,\nwe\n&gt; will be giving out awards in the near future when we get around to analyze\n&gt; some posts. In the meantime, keep up the RPing!\n&gt; -JP\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
