The last thing they wanted was to\nstart something. Ramulas Had told them this was\nprehistoric earth, and was going to show them there\nlodgings when a blast rattled the ship, and He left\nthem with Dracona. They were confused. Snow Tech\nturned to Dracona,*\n\n &quot; Does every one come and go this way?&quot; \n\n * A sudden screech distracted the bots once more as a\nfemale raptor/bot ran down the hall, followed by an\nexact copy, but male. As the male bot walked by,\nShadow Cat tilted her head and stared at him,*\n\n &quot; Nice tail.&quot; *she breathed, to no one in\nparticular.*\n\n * Snow Tech Smiled to his sister, as she watched the\nbot pass,*\n\n &quot; Jezze, and you said i wuz bad!&quot;\n\n * Shadow Cat glared at him, and made a rude gesture\nat him. She composed herself and kicked him in the\nshin when he began to snicker. She looked at Dracona\nand said,*\n\n &quot; of all the sparks in the universe i had to get the\ndumbest ass-hole for a brother. and, giving Snow Tech\nan extra mean glare, started to walk after Dinobot.\nSnow Tech giggled and followed, winking at Dracona.*\n \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
