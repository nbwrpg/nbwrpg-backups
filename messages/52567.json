Considering these new \nfacts, I fear it will end with this battle. I promise though that I \nwill not attack your group until my ship is down again. It is an honor \nto fight on your side. Tyrael out.\n\nHe directed the laser battery on Hydras. Just as he went to push the \nfiring command, a tremor shook the ship. Damage status showed that an \naft propulsor had been hit.\n\nTyrael: What in the Matrix was that?\n\nMeteara flew over the mountain range and saw the ship. She prepared \nher huge pincer and charged it. She unleashed a massive electric \ndischarge at it.\n\nThe discharge burned up two of the laser batteries.\n\nTyrael: We are under attack! Any assistance will be accepted!\n\n\n"}}
