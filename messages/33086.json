He had only fought with the Maximal&#39;s to save his own \n&gt; hide...they were different then him. He was destructive and nasty. \n&gt; They were honourable and good. Definetly not his style. He had \nfixed \n&gt; that one bot for the fact that he had saved him. But nothing to \n&gt; matter. He had learned many secrets of this faction as well as \nthier \n&gt; base from his brief look into the thoughts of Prowl.\n&gt; He looked to the sky and took off transforming to his vulture mode \n&gt; and flying off into the distance. Two things for sure on his \n&gt; mind....he needed a faction to join....and that the Maximals were \nnot \n&gt; it.\n\n\n"}}
