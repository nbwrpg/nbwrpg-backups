It was warm, all the devices generating a bit of heat. They \nmanage to get her up on the table, strapping her down. After how Feline broke \nout, they use reinforced metal straps, strapping her neck, legs, and arms. \nThe two bots stand at either side of the table, their eyes feasting on the \nfemmbot before them.\n\nThey both reach out to touch her at the same time, stiffening as each one \nsees the other move. Reptilica and Bloodystrike glare hostilly at each other, \ntheir hands retreating. They both stand over the femm, glaring at each other. \nReptilica activates his comm-link, not taking his eyes off his &#39;friend&#39;.\n\n&quot;Zardus, she&#39;s in the lab,&quot; he says into it, &quot;We&#39;re ready when you are.&quot;\n\n"}}
