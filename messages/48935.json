This\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; explain his ability to get blown up.  The Spark is\n&gt; &gt; everything.  If it dies so does everything. \n&gt; Beside&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; if logic were in the head you wouldn&#39;t need it to\n&gt; &gt; revive Waspinator, but they never threw it out as\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; useless waist of power.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; it seems like Inferno, Waspinator and Terrorsaur\n&gt; where the ones that \n&gt; always got blown up, they might have been the same\n&gt; type of model or \n&gt; something.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo!
