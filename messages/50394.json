But Rauq, even you have to admit that HNC&#39;s \ninaugural rp post wasn&#39;t worth the time it took to read the first \nline, let alone the whole thing.  And Lurker&#39;s start-up is the most \nover-dramatized entrance I&#39;ve ever seen - all you need is a shot of \nDr. Frankenstein throwing a switch and it&#39;s a ripoff of every single \nhorror movie out there.  \n\nIt&#39;s improved somewhat since then.\n\nAs far as characters are concerned, Terminion and \nSkullertron/Slaughter actually display both personality and \npotential.  The remaining four have been cannon-fodder thus far.\n\nThat&#39;s my opinion and it&#39;s up to you guys to prove me right or wrong \nby roleplaying, not bitching.  And this is a serious RPG, not a \nslapstick movie, so if I see another post/exchange like HNC&#39;s first \none, where everyone involved is an absolute idiot, I will ingore \nevery post thereafter made by the perpetrator(s) regardless of who \nthey are or think they are.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve been lurking around for those wondering. Megatron is waiting \nin \n&gt; the control room for the Predacons, most of which are &#39;busy&#39; or \n&gt; something. I really don&#39;t have much to post about right now, but I \n&gt; still have to read the posts up till when i last checked em.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess i have to stick my nose in, cause this obviously aint \n&gt; getting better, it&#39;s getting worse. *raises verbal shields*\n&gt; \n&gt; First think that needs to happen is a cease fire in this flame war \n&gt; between cardhead, lurker, and narrator. it started wrong right from \n&gt; the start. certain things which shouldn&#39;t have been said, were \nsaid, \n&gt; and the replies were less than sucessful at defusing the situation \n&gt; and it blew up. \n&gt; \n&gt; cardhead, if you don&#39;t like Narrator&#39;s posting style, that&#39;s your \n&gt; problem. Telling him that you don&#39;t like it, with a bunch of \n&gt; senseless slander isn&#39;t going to make him post the way you&#39;d like \n&gt; him to post.\n&gt; \n&gt; Narrator, keep ooc comments out of your posting, if you want to say \n&gt; something, say it and no pot shots. And I find it really hard to \n&gt; believe that you managed to put &#39;piece of dog shit&#39; and &#39;grow up&#39; \nin \n&gt; the same context.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone wants to grow up, then they should shut up about this \n&gt; stupid arguement, and get back to role playing. Nothing anyone can \n&gt; say now short of an appologies and &#39;I&#39;m being quiet&#39;, can show me \n&gt; that anyone is growing up.\n&gt; \n&gt; *preps for backlash*\n\n\n"}}
