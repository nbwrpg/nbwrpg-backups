He had no interest what so ever of helping his fellow Maximals destroy such a weak opponent, knowing that it wasn�t even worth the memory systems to think about it.\nHe was waiting for the real battle, the one in which might arise when they were in the process of escape.\nThen looking back towards Tavatron he noticed her smile at him, knowing exactly what she was smiling about.\nShe KNEW that he had put the cloaking device upon her waist, there was no point in even trying to hide the fact. So he didn�t bother.\nHe did what he did that there wasn�t anything in the entire universe that could change that�though with deeper thought he didn�t seem to feel any reason to change it at all.\nDinobot just saw that Tavatron was about to say something when she heard the sirens and tensed, activating her cloaking device and disappearing from his sight completely.\nBut yet, since he did not feel any vibrations upon the floor that would indicate her travel from her last position, which meant that she was still directly in front of him. With the sound of an unsheathed sword he knew that Tavatron was ready for battle, himself growling and flexing his claws.\nHe heard her tell that they mush get out of the room and felt the vibrations in which meant that she had moved towards the door, simply looking towards the door before he felt other vibrations, alien and unwelcome. The enemy had arrived.\nThere was no point in cloaking now; it was far too late. It was time to get down to the business in which he knew would come, knowing that he might get in a little slaging after all.\nWith the sound of Reptilica�s voice in the door way Dinobot snapped his head towards it, a growl escaping his throat despite the fact that he knew that the Alliance bot was NOT alone!\nDinobot tensed his muscles as he watched Reptilica, Bloodystrike, Breakdown, Pyro and Scattershot enter the room, his aggression rising with every one of their steps advancing towards him. With a quick sweep of his scanners he detected the auto-guns, every single one of them aimed at him. Yet, there was absolutely no worry in his systems at all. Just as long as he took out an Alliance bot or two before they brought him down, and as long as Tavatron got out safely. That was all that mattered.\n DEATH was not unwelcome to him, yet it was not invited either. It was accepted if ever showed it�s dark face.\nDinobot knew that if all of the fire was trained on him then the rest might be able to escape, thinking this over carefully in his mind to consider the possibilities of success.\nSince they could not be seen then they could easily slip out of the room, while he would remain to teach these Alliance fools not to mess with RAGE in armor!\nHe snarled at the idea, thinking of how high a chance of success it had.\nAs he was just about to send a coded message to Prowl to lead them out he suddenly noticed that he wouldn�t have to in the first place, Prowl had decloaked!\nDinobot rolled his optics and sighed in annoyance, what in the Pit was that bot trying to do?!\nHe watched Reptilica smile and just urged to rip it right off of his face, just daring the enemy to make some sort of wisecrack towards him. Just DARING!\nThen turning his optics to see just what Prowl was up to he noticed the tub-like device in his hand, knowing exactly what it was�similar to: A detonator for charges!\nRattrap had had a very similar device in which he used, more then once.\nSeeing the grin wiped off Reptilica�s face he nearly smiled, never seeing the Alliance bot so unsure of himself. It was a pleasant sight. But so would the sight of all of their mutilated body�s upon the ground, all caused by his claws.\nIt was strange, but in this new body it almost seemed as if his aggression and rage were multiplied three fold. Perhaps the unsuitability of it, perhaps just the different components, whatever the reason he had never found himself urging to rip his enemy as much as he did now. However, he couldn�t complain.\nDinobot nearly grinned that the thought of ripping Reptilica apart as he watched him but then something caught his attention, the words in which came from Prowl�s mouth. Snapping his head towards the Maximals with a snarl that was aimed right at him! He was going to destroy them all?! What in the Pit was wrong with him?!\nBut then he looked at the detonator again, it wasn�t real.\nDinobot suddenly narrowed his optics towards Prowl, then knowing just what the Maximal was trying to do.\nHe looks towards Reltilica as Prowl relays a false story to him, explaining how the two of them had relayed explosives into the Alliance engine room. Thinking to himself of how Prowl could have come up with a better story then that�but there was no time to think of details.\nBut then all of a sudden Prowl turned all of the Alliance bot�s attention towards himself, asking him if this was all worth the cost of four Maximal lives. Personally he wanted to cuff the feathered Maximal cross the face for coming up with such a lame story and expecting him to go along with it, but there was no time. Later would be more�convenient.\nWith a raged look he took a threatening step towards Retilica, making it seem as if he wanted to scrap him right there�which he did. But it was all for show�for now. His teeth bared and his claws looking like they could strike out at Reptilica any moment.*\n\n� As long as these fools are terminated as well, Maximal lives are well worth the cost!�\n\n* With that he then tensed as if he was about to simply leap out and slash at Reptilica, but he did not. He was well aware of the other Alliance bot�s in the room, they would scrap him in a nano-click if he so much as breathed wrong. But he had to back up Prowl�s story�in which he was going to have a long talk with him about later! *\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
