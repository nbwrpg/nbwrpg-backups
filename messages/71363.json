Why not drive off and show off that car?  That&#39;s all you seem to=\r\n be, talk talk talk, saying how you&#39;re so scary!  Well, where I come from, =\r\npeople do and don&#39;t say!  Those who say don&#39;t do, and they just all play!&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnd then over from the front of the room as pandemonium seemed to =\r\nbe ready to break out, as Windlord left, and Leo PRime tried to get control=\r\n, one of the few mechanoids that Wheelie respected to a degree, RODIMUS PRI=\r\nME, spoke up.  And Wheelie then lowered his weapon, &quot;As you ask, I shall do=\r\n.  But I do it for him, not for you.&quot;  Glancing over at Tuscon.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTh=\r\nen, at the comments from Night Shift and Straight Shot, Wheelie was egged o=\r\nn again, &quot;I would say get bent, since you already seem to be, it&#39;s nothing =\r\nnew, just between you and me.&quot;  And then at the tossing out of Ratchet, &quot;Yo=\r\nu say that name like it should make sense.  He&#39;s here in a sleep, so don&#39;t =\r\nbe dense.&quot; Meaning the Ark, &quot;By the time I was around, he was dead, word to=\r\n the wise.  So threatening me with the name of someone passed along makes y=\r\nou silly, ineffective guys.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWheelie going on, then retreating int=\r\no the back, &quot;You want someone mad, you want someone angry, I&#39;ll give you Sl=\r\nag, for whom his name is a cuss word thrown out like candy!  He&#39;s not a ver=\r\ny happy guy, and I see nothing for why Ratchet should be brought up, oh my.=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThen going over to take a seat in the corner, Wheelie glancing u=\r\np at Leo PRime, and finally softening, &quot;I guess I owe you an apology. I&#39;m s=\r\norry.  With the cast of glitches on Earth, you have a cue to worry.  Looks =\r\nlike you&#39;ve got your work cut out, if you&#39;re going to stay about.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockq=\r\nuote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-2-384817279--\r\n\n"}}
