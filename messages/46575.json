When a bot does get damaged\n      what typically happ=\r\nens here?\n\n      Here&#39;s the list:\n\n      1) The enemy bot suddenly becomes =\r\ncockeyed unable to hit the broad side of a\n      barn even if he was a g1 a=\r\nnd standing over it.\n\n      2) The bot never gives chase to his prey. It al=\r\nways lets the long time\n      character slip away.\n\n      3) A short stay (=\r\na few hours usually) in the CR chamber and any damage is\n      completely g=\r\none.\n\n      4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back as an e=\r\nnemy\n      infiltrator.\n\n      5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone appear=\r\ns which after various meeting\n      with colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; turns g=\r\nood again. Personality reverts to\n      pre-evil clone.\n\n      6) Character=\r\n &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful offspring. Personality\n      is ha=\r\nrdly different.\n\n      7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but the players 6 other characte=\r\nrs cart it&#39;s blasted\n      carcass back to a lab where they resurrect him.\n=\r\n\n      8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with new bot same personality...eventual=\r\nly\n      people will forget you died and you can go back to your old form.\n=\r\n\n      Since most will never let their &quot;favorite&quot; character(s) die, I mean =\r\ntruly\n      die, never come back like, there&#39;s really very little new plotl=\r\nines you can\n      do with them without repeating rehashed already done one=\r\ns.

The\n      role-playing by some will still stink=\r\n, characters will still be incapable of\n      dying and given another year =\r\nor so all plotlines for THAT game will be\n      starting to repeat. While I=\r\n still do believe a restart/sequel is in order I\n      think the role-playi=\r\nng problem needs addressing first to stop a repeat of\n      what&#39;s happenin=\r\ng to NBW.\n\n\n\n      ----- Original Message -----\n      From: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_r=\r\nauq_x@...&gt;\n      To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n      Sent: Sunday, Jan=\r\nuary 20, 2002 5:57 AM\n      Subject: All Read: Important\n\n\n      &gt; My appol=\r\nogies, Narrator, I actually missed your original post.\n      &gt;\n      &gt; I fi=\r\nnd that Neo Beast Wars has been dragged on for too long, and the\n      &gt; wo=\r\nrld is becoming clogged with bases among other things.

Take for example&lt;BR&gt;the geotrons planing to \n      attack the=\r\n new cat faction....both factions will&lt;BR&gt;survive, I doubt \n      either pl=\r\nayer who controls the majority of bots in either&lt;BR&gt;faction is \n      gonna=\r\n let their characters get anywhere near killed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And what&#39;s to \n     =\r\n stop this from happening if a restart/sequel DOES occur? \n      The&lt;BR&gt;rol=\r\ne-playing by some will still stink, characters will still be \n      incapab=\r\nle of&lt;BR&gt;dying and given another year or so all plotlines for THAT \n      g=\r\name will be&lt;BR&gt;starting to repeat. While I still do believe a \n      restar=\r\nt/sequel is in order I&lt;BR&gt;think the role-playing problem needs \n      addre=\r\nssing first to stop a repeat of&lt;BR&gt;what&#39;s happening to \n      NBW.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message -----&lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; \n      &lt;x_rauq_x=\r\n@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: \n      Sunday=\r\n, January 20, 2002 5:57 AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: All Read: \n      Important&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; My appologies, Narrator, I actually missed your \n      original post=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I find that Neo Beast Wars has been dragged \n      on for=\r\n too long, and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; world is becoming clogged with bases \n      amon=\r\ng other things. Ideas are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; becoming exausted, if not completely \n   =\r\n   exausted already. It seems to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; me that we are almost delaying the=\r\n \n      end of the rpg. If you&#39;ve created&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one storyline that you li=\r\nke, is \n      it not fair to say that you can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; create another better=\r\n \n      one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The idea of creating a sequel to the rpg is on=\r\ne that \n      I would agree&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with. That would require several things=\r\n to \n      happen:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) Changing the name of the RPG.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) Appr=\r\nopriate \n      changes to the website.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3) A means to store all of e=\r\nveryone&#39;s \n      previous characters (don&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; know about everyone els=\r\ne, but I don&#39;t \n      want to lose the bio&#39;s of all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my characters).=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4) New story \n      (i have an idea, not necessarily for the story=\r\n, but for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how we \n      could create the story).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 5) A catal=\r\nyst to start us all off (the \n      story should provide that).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 6) =\r\nImplementation of new rules, some \n      of which have been, and are&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; being, discussed in the login \n      messageboard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 7) other stuff=\r\n that could be written if I wasn&#39;t so \n      tired.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; All in =\r\nall, since there are more people voting \n      anti-restart that I&#39;d&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; anticpated, I&#39;ll ask everyone a perhaps fate \n      deciding question:&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Would it be favourable to have a sequel \n      instead of a r=\r\nestart?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., \n      &quot;airly20=\r\n00&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m agree with \n      Soulst=\r\nice, restart isn&#39;t good idea. All have good&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; story-lines \n     =\r\n and good characters. Perhaps the best would be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; eliminate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n=\r\n      &gt; less importat characters of our story-line (every rpgers \n      =\r\ncould&lt;BR&gt;&gt; choice&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; at whom wants eliminate) and elimitante \n=\r\n      factions where are member&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t posting and join \n=\r\n      factions that have few characters&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; playing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    =\r\n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That other way than restart.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    =\r\n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; \n      &lt;=\r\nthecode@p...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I at first wasn&#39;t sure \n    =\r\n  if I could vote in this one. Not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; am I seemingly=\r\n \n      not too much an important part of this RPG, despite&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne \n      general current lack of members, and the fact that I&#39;ve been&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; \n      here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for getting close to 2 years, but also I am not=\r\n involved \n      in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; restart. I have very few characters. =\r\nCharacters that, \n      if the RPG&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; restarted, will =\r\nstill be together \n      (Insecticons, specifically), and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ther=\r\nefore it wouldn&#39;t harm \n      me to vote yes. However, I don&#39;t think&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; could vote \n      yes, because I am apposed to restarting =\r\nthe RPG. I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n      decided to vote no. It just doesn&#39;t mak=\r\ne sense to me to end the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n      saga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of Neo Beast Wars=\r\n. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked \n      hard over&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; years to keep going. I don&#39;t think that \n      we could suddenly prete=\r\nnd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; never happened, I think \n      it&#39;s impossible. =\r\nMaybe if we ended it and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; started the sequel, \n      I wouldn&#39;t=\r\n mind so much, but otherwise, my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vote&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is \n      no.
