Then, a voice from the pod \nblurted out to \n&gt; &gt; anyone who happened to be listening, &quot;Main stasis chamber power \nfailure. \n&gt; &gt; Energy at 23%. Attempting to activate protoform.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The stasis pod stuck up a small antenna and, using power as \nmiserly as it was \n&gt; &gt; able, began a sweep for an acceptable life form for its occupant. \nOnly one \n&gt; &gt; happened to be close: A weasil, which the pod had landed on the \nnest of and \n&gt; &gt; trapped. The weasil chittered angrily at the massive metal hulk \nabove its \n&gt; &gt; nest, and was replied to with more status reports from the pod.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Species found. Adapting protoform to life form WEASIL....&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The pod suddenly released a puff of acrid blue smoke, and sparks \njumped from \n&gt; &gt; one end to the other. &quot;Error in solidification&quot;, it \nreported. &quot;Conversion \n&gt; &gt; from protomatter to proto-nano-bots: 100%. Conversion from proto-\nnano-bots to \n&gt; &gt; nano-bot structure drones: 80%. Conversion from nano-bot \nstructure drones to \n&gt; &gt; robot metallic alloy: 0%.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The stasis pod&#39;s computer hummed, buzzed, and shot some \nsparks. &quot;Main power \n&gt; &gt; level at 3% and falling.&quot; it informed the jungle \ndenizens. &quot;Enacting \n&gt; &gt; emergency protoform augmentation code to supplement incomplete \nstructural \n&gt; &gt; system. Computing maximum benefit,,,&quot; The computer fizzed some, \nand one of \n&gt; &gt; its memory units burst into flames from power core fluid which \nwas spilling \n&gt; &gt; onto it. The stasis pod beeped ominously, and made a \ndecision. &quot;Optimal \n&gt; &gt; protoform survival necessitates immediate intelligence. Inserting \n&gt; &gt; macro-neural algorithmic artificial intelligence module to \ntemporarily \n&gt; &gt; control protoform.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The stasis pod&#39;s viewport glowed brightly for a moment, as almost \na third of \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s proto-nano-bots were reconfigured to become a computer. With \nthat \n&gt; &gt; complete, the stasis pod opened itself, and a mass of fluid gunk, \nsupporting \n&gt; &gt; a small computer with tendrils extending throughout it, and \nanother tendriled \n&gt; &gt; vacuole holding the protoform&#39;s still-unconscious spark, gathered \nitself from \n&gt; &gt; the protoform bed and climed out of the stasis pod.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The nano-bot paste, controlled by the computer, oozed about 20 \nfeet before \n&gt; &gt; collapsing into a puddle, its energy mostly spent. Resting in a \nsmall ditch, \n&gt; &gt; the computer began to think.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Safety has been achieved. I have achieved safety for this spark. \nThis spark \n&gt; &gt; must now be activated by me. Me... I? I.. am. I am Iss. Iss must \nactivate \n&gt; &gt; this spark.] thought the computer. (Author&#39;s note: I will put \nIss&#39;s thoughts \n&gt; &gt; in square brackets.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Iss reached one of its tendrils through the nanoprobe body, and \nstroked the \n&gt; &gt; spark container, which activated it, and also created a thought-\nlink between \n&gt; &gt; Iss and the spark.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The spark thought. &quot;I have no body! No senses! No components! Am \nI dead? Am I \n&gt; &gt; in the matrix?&quot; [You are not in the matrix, spark.], replied Iss. \n[What is \n&gt; &gt; your name?] &quot;I am Vorb&quot;, thought the spark. &quot;If I&#39;m not dead, \nthen what&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; wrong with me? I&#39;ve never experienced this, or even heard of it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [You nearly did die, Vorb. Your protoform was not completely \nconverted into a \n&gt; &gt; robot. You consist of nano-bot structure drones and proto-nano-\nbots. Before \n&gt; &gt; your failed activation, the stasis pod chose a species for yout \nbeast mode.]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;If I&#39;m made of structure drones, then make a body for me! Robot \nmode, with \n&gt; &gt; all the normal stuff, plus a beast mode too, please.&quot; thought \nVorb.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Your thought is my command. Be patient, though, for structure \ndrones are \n&gt; &gt; slow to be adapted outside of a CR chamber or a stasis pod.]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Over the next hour, the puddle lying on the jungle ground \nlengthened itself \n&gt; &gt; noticeably. After about two, a basic bi-pedal humanoid form could \nbe \n&gt; &gt; recognized, but still looking like a slightly melted metal \ncasting of one. By \n&gt; &gt; five hours, the structure drones had collected and hardened \nthemselves into \n&gt; &gt; pseudo-robot-parts, and the proto-nano-bots began to change for \nsensory \n&gt; &gt; input, simple weapons, and computer access.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Seven hours after Vorb was awakened, the new body opened its \neyes. &quot;Finally&quot;, \n&gt; &gt; said Vorb, aloud, through his new mouth. &quot;I am activated.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Be warey, Vorb] warned Iss. [Your body is not hardened metal \nalloy like a \n&gt; &gt; normal robots; it is composed of structure drones. You are very \nfragile.]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Fragile, shmagile&quot;, thought back Vorb. &quot;I need to find help. Why \ncan&#39;t I \n&gt; &gt; remember anything?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Your memory banks were destroyed when the stasis pod landed. To \nyour left, \n&gt; &gt; you can see what remains of it.]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vorb walked over to the pod, and plugged into the emergency \nauxilliary power \n&gt; &gt; to recharge himself, then grabbed an empty power cell, for \nfilling up later. \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I must find allies&quot;, he thought.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Over his radio, Vorb began to broadcast. &quot;Attention all \nprotoforms. We are \n&gt; &gt; Vorb and Iss, poly-intelligent robot form. Henceforth we will \nrefer to \n&gt; &gt; ourself in singular as VorbIss. I require information about what \nfactions \n&gt; &gt; exist on this planet. Please reply.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a copy&paste of the VorbIss info page from nbwrpg.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gender: Male \n&gt; &gt; Alliegence Neutral \n&gt; &gt; Alternate Mode(s): Weasil, Puddle \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Description:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; VorbIss is mostly made out of nano-bots. The nanobots form his \nbody, while \n&gt; &gt; other core functions are done by specialized machinery. All the \nnanobots are \n&gt; &gt; capable of doing is changing shape, with the exception of a small \nsupply of \n&gt; &gt; very specialized information-warfare nanobots. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; VorbIss has a literal split personality, in that in addition to a \nspark \n&gt; &gt; container he has a very advanced, and very insane, computer AI. \nBoth of these \n&gt; &gt; are connected to a nanobot control unit, without which the \nnanobots are \n&gt; &gt; unable to function. However, a nanobot puddle will broadcast a \nhoming beacon \n&gt; &gt; so that it can be found later. A nanobot control unit can control \nany \n&gt; &gt; nanobots which it is in physical contact with, so that if VorbIss \ntouches a \n&gt; &gt; nanobot puddle he immediately gains control of those bots. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Example of control unit: \n&gt; &gt; If you shoot off VorbIss&#39;s arm, and the arm doesn&#39;t have a \ncontrol unit in \n&gt; &gt; it, then it will simply fall to the ground. Over a period of \nabout an hour, \n&gt; &gt; the nanobots will cease to hold their positions (since they have \nno \n&gt; &gt; controller), and the arm will have melted into a small puddle \nspewing radio \n&gt; &gt; waves.] \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; VorbIss&#39;s spark is named Vorb, and the AI is Iss. If VorbIss is \nsplit in two \n&gt; &gt; somehow, and Vorb and Iss are separate, then Iss will act without \nVorb. \n&gt; &gt; However, Iss is (as mentioned above) insane. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In addition to the spark container and computer, VorbIss has one \ntaser, onem \n&gt; &gt; edium-powered cutting laser, a small jet engine, and a computer \ninterface. \n&gt; &gt; These arec ontrolled by nano-bot control units as well, but are \nnot made of \n&gt; &gt; nano-bots. Any other hardware VorbIss encounters lying around can \nalso be \n&gt; &gt; picked up and used by his nanobotc controllers as well. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Example: \n&gt; &gt; If you shoot off the arm with the taser, a puddle with a taser in \nit will be \n&gt; &gt; the result. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If VorbIss finds device X, then device X can be integrated into \nhim and be \n&gt; &gt; controlled and accessed by his nanoprobe controllers. \n&gt; &gt; ] \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; VorbIss&#39;s nanobots are a deep green, and unable to change color. \nThey are \n&gt; &gt; also unable to quickly rearrange themselves to change shape, so \nnormally \n&gt; &gt; instead of being a fluid being VorbIss&#39;s nanobots take the shape \nof standard \n&gt; &gt; robot components, and harden themselves. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; VorbIss is a relatively fragile bot, because impacts which would \nnot damage a \n&gt; &gt; regular bot are capable of tearing the nanobot bonds. This means \nthat if you \n&gt; &gt; swing a sword at him, instead of causing a big dent the sword \nwill cut right \n&gt; &gt; through him. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Because Vorb and Iss share the same body. Iss is constantly \nsupplying Vorb \n&gt; &gt; with weird ideas. Although Iss&#39;s motives are volatile and insane, \nIss is \n&gt; &gt; quite intelligent, and can provide very usefull assistence with \nVorb&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; guidance. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; VorbIss specializes in computer hacking and information warfare, \nboth of \n&gt; &gt; which come especially easy to him because Iss is a computer. In \naddition to \n&gt; &gt; simply hacking, VorbIss designs and implements hidden data taps \nand homing \n&gt; &gt; beacons with the help of a limited supply of specialized \nnanobots. These \n&gt; &gt; specialized nanobots are able to maintain simple orders without a \ncontrol \n&gt; &gt; unit, allowing his taps and beacons to operate on their own.\n\n\n"}}
