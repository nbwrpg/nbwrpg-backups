J=\r\nust keep an eye on my demeanor.  I trust you know how a dragon gets when st=\r\nricken by Natural instincts.  That will be your clue.  But do not do anythi=\r\nng until everyone&#39;s attention is on me.  When it is and an escape route is =\r\nestablished, that&#39;s when you make a break for the Ark.  I may not make it o=\r\nut but I&#39;m sure you will.  Inform Lord Elder and Leo Prime of everything th=\r\nat&#39;s happening here.  I&#39;m sure they will send help promptly.  Good luck to =\r\nall of you.&quot;\n\nHe says quietly so is not to be heard.\n\nPerpetually on the mo=\r\nve and constantly busy. \n\nOn Sep 30, 2011, at 12:29 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;sup=\r\nercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nods once to Big Con=\r\nvoy&#39;s suggestion. He then extends his hand in\n&gt; &gt; greeting to Mach Kick and=\r\n Break.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Noted Sir. And it&#39;s good to meet both of you. Hmm, from w=\r\nhat I have\n&gt; &gt; already observed, Magmatron is a highly established strategi=\r\nst. You&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; right, Big Convoy, getting past him will not be easy. Then a=\r\ngain, my\n&gt; &gt; comrades often have a hard time trying to figure me out. I adm=\r\nit that some\n&gt; &gt; of my techniques are completely out of the box but so far,=\r\n we&#39;ve all\n&gt; &gt; survived through some very difficult times. Which has now le=\r\nd me here, to\n&gt; &gt; you. I know this happened for a very good reason, and if =\r\nI can get all of\n&gt; &gt; you out safely I will. It&#39;s just going to have to be a=\r\n little creatively\n&gt; &gt; done, if you know what I mean.. And I already have s=\r\nomething in mind. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He steps closer to all of them. As he spoke his=\r\n voice was kept at a\n&gt; &gt; whisper. He continues but lowers it even further t=\r\no the point where only his\n&gt; &gt; new found friends could hear.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I no=\r\nticed that as a Maximal, in beast form, I experienced strong urges to\n&gt; &gt; r=\r\nevert to my most primitive of animal instincts. Mind you, dragons can be\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; extremely aggressive and destructive as well as wise. I&#39;ve also found my\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; tail and wings to be rather strong. But most of all, my voice. As the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; dragon, my roar has a sonic component to it. This means that through pro=\r\nper\n&gt; &gt; harmonics I could stir up a sizable diversion, long enough to get y=\r\nou out of\n&gt; &gt; here. Of course my little reversion will be controlled and as=\r\n soon as\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re free, I will join you. If I don&#39;t make it out, at least=\r\n I know that\n&gt; &gt; you will, and then you can rejoin Leo Prime and the others=\r\n back at the Ark\n&gt; &gt; where you belong. This is a risk I am more than willin=\r\ng to take for your\n&gt; &gt; freedom. So, all in favor, shake on it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He =\r\nkeeps his hand extended to his new comrades.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; They all exten=\r\nd their hands to shake TUSCON&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You do realize that there is a weapo=\r\nn suppression system in place?&quot;\n&gt; Said the short dimunative figure of BREAK=\r\n. &quot;We can use our weapons in\n&gt; the arena, but they have shields up protecti=\r\nng the audience.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The somewhat taller MACH KICK bobbed his head up and=\r\n down, he was a\n&gt; bundle of energy. &quot;yes, yes, true enough.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; BIG CONVO=\r\nY looked around at the others in the room but still continued\n&gt; to speak qu=\r\nietly, &quot;I think even that roar of yours you spoke of would\n&gt; be muffled som=\r\newhat.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As they spoke, one of the soldiers across the room waved at BI=\r\nG CONVOY\n&gt; as if to hush him. Moments later a trio of MAGMATRON&#39;s soldiers =\r\nwalked\n&gt; down the hall, weapons at the ready, their optics flashing as they=\r\n\n&gt; looked around.

He then extends his hand in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; greeting to Mach Kick and B=\r\nreak.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Noted Sir.  And it&#39;s good to meet both of you.  H=\r\nmm, from what I have&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; already observed, Magmatron is a highly estab=\r\nlished strategist.  You&#39;re&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; right, Big Convoy, getting past him wil=\r\nl not be easy.  Then again, my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; comrades often have a hard time try=\r\ning to figure me out.  I admit that some&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of my techniques are comp=\r\nletely out of the box but so far, we&#39;ve all&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; survived through some =\r\nvery difficult times.  Which has now led me here, to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you.  I know =\r\nthis happened for a very good reason, and if I can get all of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you =\r\nout safely I will.  It&#39;s just going to have to be a little creatively&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; done, if you know what I mean..  And I already have something in mind. =\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He steps closer to all of them.  As he spoke his voice =\r\nwas kept at a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; whisper. He continues but lowers it even further to =\r\nthe point where only his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; new found friends could hear.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I noticed that as a Maximal, in beast form, I experienced strong u=\r\nrges to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; revert to my most primitive of animal instincts.  Mind you=\r\n, dragons can be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; extremely aggressive and destructive as well as w=\r\nise.  I&#39;ve also found my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tail and wings to be rather strong.  But =\r\nmost of all, my voice. As the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; dragon, my roar has a sonic componen=\r\nt to it.  This means that through proper&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; harmonics I could stir up=\r\n a sizable diversion, long enough to get you out of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; here.  Of cour=\r\nse my little reversion will be controlled and as soon as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you&#39;re fr=\r\nee, I will join you.  If I don&#39;t make it out, at least I know that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n you will, and then you can rejoin Leo Prime and the others back at the Ark=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; where you belong. This is a risk I am more than willing to take f=\r\nor your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; freedom.  So, all in favor, shake on it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; He keeps his hand extended to his new comrades.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nThey all extend their hands to shake TUSCON&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;You do realiz=\r\ne that there is a weapon suppression system in place?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nSaid the short d=\r\nimunative figure of BREAK. &quot;We can use our weapons in&lt;br&gt;\nthe arena, but th=\r\ney have shields up protecting the audience.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe somewhat taller M=\r\nACH KICK bobbed his head up and down, he was a&lt;br&gt;\nbundle of energy. &quot;yes, =\r\nyes, true enough.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBIG CONVOY looked around at the others in the r=\r\noom but still continued&lt;br&gt;\nto speak quietly, &quot;I think even that roar of yo=\r\nurs you spoke of would&lt;br&gt;\nbe muffled somewhat.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs they spoke, on=\r\ne of the soldiers across the room waved at BIG CONVOY&lt;br&gt;\nas if to hush him=\r\n.
