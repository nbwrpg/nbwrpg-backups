So \nit&#39;s going \n&gt; to be a bit long.\n&gt; Though I&#39;m glad to be back, and I hope you enjoy what you read. ^-^\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The stellar winds which drifted through space were calm and smooth \njust out \n&gt; beyond the metallic atmosphere of the Transformer planet, known as \n&gt; Cybertron.\n&gt; Which, ultimately, turned out to be the ideal working conditions \nfor a black \n&gt; and gray Decepticon research vessel stationed just above the silver \nplanet.\n&gt; Its mission: to study and record a particularly strange space \nanomaly that \n&gt; had developed months ago, a little too close to Cybertron for \ncomfort.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~\n&gt; A few weeks earlier, at one of the many secret meetings the Council \nof \n&gt; Elders undertook, it was agreed upon that this new distortion in \nspace \n&gt; needed looking into.\n&gt; So, naturally these days; long after the Great Wars which nearly \nshook the \n&gt; entire universe to pieces, the Decepticons were chosen as the prime \n&gt; candidates to handle this matter.\n&gt; No, the Maximals and Predacons which now dominated the planet, nor \nwhat few \n&gt; Autobots remained couldn&#39;t be bothered to risk their own peoples. \nBut, \n&gt; although there had been peace for centuries, the Decepticons had \nalways \n&gt; seemed the most expendable.\n&gt; They&#39;d truly sunk that low.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~\n&gt; Still, those aboard research ship couldn&#39;t complain.\n&gt; Because research and exploration was what they were all about, and \nthis \n&gt; newest occurrence in the delicate fabric of space fascinated them \nto no end.\n&gt; Daily the 4 of them had worked. Scanning over and measuring the \nvariety of \n&gt; energies that were emanating from the undulating tare. Which \nlooked, \n&gt; externally, like a circular patch of heat waves against the dark \nbackdrop of \n&gt; outer space. Distorting the stars.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dust storm, the smallest of the group and a professional scout, \nthought it \n&gt; looked neat and tried to find out all that he could about it. Even \nif it \n&gt; meant bothering his 2 superiors in the process. Bombarding them \nwith \n&gt; questions that they couldn&#39;t possibly answer at this time.\n&gt; Until Blue Flame, the 2nd in command, finally had to give him a \ngood bop on \n&gt; the head and tell the little dune bunny that that was enough.\n&gt; Much to the relief of the rest of the crew.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still, it was far better to be curious about everything then \ninterested in \n&gt; nothing, so Diesel Runner (D.R. for short) simply let Dust storm \nbe. Being \n&gt; the Commander of the mission, she was the one who had to put up \nwith him the \n&gt; most anyway, Since she couldn&#39;t expect Blue Flame or the quiet Dark \nCloud \n&gt; to. The ships aerial surveillance officer.\n&gt; Most of all, however, they all got along the best that Decepticons \never \n&gt; could be expected to and completed their given assignments on time.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was just that the space anomaly was turning out to be a bit more \n&gt; difficult then could have been expected.\n&gt; And a shock of all shocks when it began to implode.\n&gt; Scrambling to their stations, it was discovered that the distortion \ntare was \n&gt; collapsing in on itself and beginning to suck in everything that it \ncould as \n&gt; its gravity field collapsed. Including the Decepticon ship!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s pulling us in!&quot; Blue Flame reported from his position at the \nhelm \n&gt; controls as the bridge flashed with warning sirens. &quot; And I can&#39;t \nbreak us \n&gt; loose!&quot;\n&gt; &quot; Did you try the reverse thrusters?&quot; D.R. asked from her seat at \nthe \n&gt; command post. Only to receive a report from her 2nd in command that \nthey \n&gt; were on full and still had no effect.\n&gt; Dust Storm freaked as the tare grew closer. &quot; We&#39;re gunna DIE!!&quot;\n&gt; Dark Cloud tried to correct their navigations back to Cybertron, \nwith no \n&gt; effect. Mumbling to himself, &quot; Where the Pit are those recovery \ndrones when \n&gt; you need them?!&quot;\n&gt; All of a sudden, everything inside of the ship went black and power \nceased \n&gt; to flow throughout the bridge system.\n&gt; Blue Flame slammed his fists against the controls. &quot; On great! Now \nthe \n&gt; console&#39;s dead!&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Over here too.&quot; Dark Cloud reported from his post.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ship was now on the fringe of the collapsing anomaly and the \nship began \n&gt; to shake violently.\n&gt; So violent, that it began to fell apart.\n&gt; Inside the bridge, things were no better. And all Hell broke loose.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hang onto something!&quot; D.R. ordered just before they were sucked \nin and \n&gt; everything went black.\n&gt; \n&gt; The tare disappeared and the atmosphere around Cybertron was left \npeaceful \n&gt; once more.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; BIOS:\n&gt; \n&gt; CREW OF THE DECEPTICON RESEARCH VESSEL:\n&gt; \n&gt; Name: Diesel Runner\n&gt;             (D.R. for short)\n&gt; Gender: fembot\n&gt; Height: 11ft\n&gt; Weight: 2 t\n&gt; Faction: Decepticon\n&gt; Position: Commander\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehicle: Black, with blue and purple striped semi truck\n&gt;               Mack 2000\n&gt; &#61623; hauls black cargo trailer with purple Decepticon insignia \non upper \n&gt; right corner\n&gt; &#61623; chrome running boards, stacks, bumpers, grill and fuel \ntanks\n&gt; &#61623; Decepticon insignia on chrome hubcaps\n&gt; Robot: basically a female Optimus Prime (to put it simply)\n&gt; \n&gt; Weapon: Laser rifle\n&gt; &#61623; beam saber\n&gt; &#61623; flame thrower\n&gt; &#61623; x-ray headlights\n&gt; &#61623; holo-shield\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Name: Blue Flame\n&gt; Gender: male\n&gt; Height: 12 ft\n&gt; Weight: 2.6 t\n&gt; Faction: Decepticon\n&gt; Position: 2nd In Command\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehicle: Blue semi-truck with yellow/orange flames on front\n&gt; &#61623; hauls no trailer\n&gt; &#61623; Chrome parts the same as D.R.\n&gt; &#61623; Decepticon insignia on grill.\n&gt; \n&gt; Weapon: Ion disrupter pistol\n&gt; &#61623; beam ax\n&gt; &#61623; laser sharpshooter rifle\n&gt; &#61623; acid grenades\n&gt; &#61623; flame thrower\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Name: Dust Storm\n&gt; Gender: male\n&gt; Height: 8 ft\n&gt; Faction: Decepticon\n&gt; Position: Scout\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehicle: Copper colored dune buggy\n&gt; \n&gt; Weapon: Smoke bombs\n&gt; &#61623; acid pellets\n&gt; &#61623; beam staff\n&gt; &#61623; hologram projector\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Name: Dark Cloud\n&gt; Gender: male\n&gt; Height: 9.1 ft\n&gt; Faction: Decepticon\n&gt; Position: Ariel Surveillance\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehicle: Black and silver jet plane\n&gt; \n&gt; Weapons: Plasma rifle\n&gt; &#61623; vibration cannon\n&gt; &#61623; missile launcher\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; MSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE*  \n&gt; http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\n\n\n"}}
