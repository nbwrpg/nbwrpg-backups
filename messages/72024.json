His attempt to=\r\n\n&gt; ping Teletran-one was met with utter silence.\n&gt; \n&gt; However even the sign=\r\nal he was recieving was strange. It was not a\n&gt; communication in the conven=\r\ntional sense. It was a resonance wave that\n&gt; was traveling along the backro=\r\nund energy that was in this strange\n&gt; jungle. Like a small leaf floating al=\r\nong a larger river, the signal\n&gt; went out riding on the wave of energy that=\r\n seemed to permeate this\n&gt; section of jungle. It was detectable by WHEELIE&#39;=\r\ns communication gear\n&gt; but it was not being transmitted along the typical l=\r\nines.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing WHEELIE may remember is that RODIMUS is still Autobot =\r\nhaving\n&gt; never become a Maximal. And it was not that this signal was being\n=\r\n&gt; transmitted on an Autobot frequency, because anyone Maximal or Autobot\n&gt; =\r\nwould have recieved it had they been with WHEELIE, but it was\n&gt; transmittin=\r\ng an Autobot distress signal.\n&gt; \n&gt; However that does lead to the question a=\r\ns to how RODIMUS would be\n&gt; transmitting it, if it was RODIMUS at all? RODI=\r\nMUS was smart, but he\n&gt; never showed an apptitude for advanced communicatio=\r\nn skills,\n&gt; especailly along the lines as this - tapping into a background =\r\nenergy\n&gt; resonance and transmitting a signal across it - it did seem to be\n=\r\n&gt; beyond his skill set.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nOOC - NICE post Preston.  Nice=\r\n little reminders you put in. ;)\n\nAt this point, WHEELIE would realize that=\r\n he had lost contact over with the ARK and hte other AUtobot forces, in his=\r\n haste to extricate himself from it and go in search of his friend.  Now he=\r\n would be disrupting their own search by making them also look for him as w=\r\nell.  \n\nWheelie shook his head as he realized his own haste in things would=\r\n now compound the issue in searching.  But he would deal with that later.\n\n=\r\nAt this point, Wheelie was confused by what he was detecting, and he had to=\r\n take a few moments to try and recalibrate his scanners.  It was foreign to=\r\n him, and he was not very well versed over in communications.  As the memor=\r\nies of Rodimus current status, he shook his head.  He had been wrong and mi=\r\nsanticipated hwat he was looking for.\n\nWHEELIE had not heard much (if at al=\r\nl) on teh crashed ship and prisoners, having only been peripherally paying =\r\nattention during the earlier briefing when it had been on before his fight =\r\nhad been instigated, so he was mostly unaware of any signs that could be of=\r\n them.\n\nFor the moment, what he could tell was that the signal was made by =\r\nan Autobot, but it could be anything, and anyone with reasonable skill coul=\r\n ddo such a thing, at least to his minimal skill level with sensors.\n\nAs he=\r\n also recalibrated his sensors, and he realized next that RODIMUS did not h=\r\nave this level of skill, his frown deepened.  WHo woudl ahve the capacity t=\r\no send out a flickering signal along AUTOBOT lines, if not the Predacons?  =\r\nBut why would they bother with such a thing?\n\nAnd yet, having little else h=\r\ne could go on now he went over in that direction.  Assuming the ground was =\r\nin good enough shape to allow him to transform and make better speed, he ou=\r\nld do so.  If not, he would walk.\n\n\n\n"}}
