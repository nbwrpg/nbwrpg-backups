It was almost a surprise to see her stand beside him and attack the enemy almost as if she had not missed anything, looking down at his cracked and bleeding armor he growled�she had missed a lot.\nJust then a sudden rush of movement caught his sensors from across the battlefield, above the rising dust and the stench of mech fluid the sound of clanking a joining metal rang. Within moments it soon came to him just what was happening as it came into view, the new comers had transformed together into a robot of such size that it was no hope for him to even try and stop it.\nDinobot looked wide-opticed at the approaching behemoth and growled as he saw it come closer and even closer towards their position, raising his rifle towards the huge robot but knowing that it was no hope if it decided to attack. But as the robot suddenly turned towards Tavatron and himself he knew that his own days would be numbered if it decided to fire upon them, but how could he blame them? There had been a huge mistake when the Maximals had opened fire upon the Alliance but it was also a fact that some of them did not know of the treaty between the two factions and that mistake had caused this to happen. Now the Alliance�s Oblitertron was revenging the mistake attack and firing upon the Maximals, this was something that had to be stopped but with a bot that size and with such power it would almost be impossible!\nDinobot turned towards Tavatron with a snarl, the giant shape of Oblitertron in the distance behind him. *\n\n� Do NOT attack the Alliance further, they are allied with us!�\n\n*With that he then turned back towards the Alliance giant and gestured towards it�s advancing form. *\n\n� We have made a dire mistake and now observe what we must deal with!�\n\n* He was just about to turn back towards Tavatron when a movement from Oblitertron caught his attention, it almost seemed as if they were about to attack�them!! Dinobot saw in a split second a huge energy bolt leave the barrel of Oblitertron�s pistol and streak towards Tavatron but knowing that he was standing close enough to get the full brunt of the charge as well. They had made the mistake of firing upon their allies and now they had to pay the price�with their lives! But that was not going to happen today, there was to be no dead from the cause of the Alliance behemoth if he could help it!\nJust before the bolt arrived at it�s target Dinobot snapped around and slammed his shoulder-plate into Tavatron with the force that would send her flying a fair distance, it may damage her greatly but being damaged was not half as bad as being dead�he knew!\nJust a nano-click after his shoulder struck the armor of the fembot the bolt hit, the force of the explosion ripping near by trees from their roots as fire erupted and dirt sprayed all around. The field now shrouded in mist and smoke as the earth rumbled and the great fireball died away, the sound of the blast echoing around the field.\nDinobot lay where he had been standing only seconds before, his armor cracked and spewing fluid more then ever as he lay on his stomach. The damage now more extensive then ever for the unconscious bot his repair sequences began to activate a repair his tattered hide. The green coils emerging from his spark and repairing what they could before there was any more damage caused from the enemy, the cracks closing but leaving white marks temporarily where they had been.\nSoon the repair coils retreated back into his chest plate but his body was not completely healed, the coils needing to replenish their power before repairing further.\nDinobot�s optics slowly opened as he lifted his head from the ground, every inch of his body feeling as if it had been disconnected and reassembled the wrong way. A growl escaping his throat as he raised himself from the ground until he came to a kneel, his head hung in pain as it wavered through his body but then snapping up as he remembered Tavatron and how she was.\nThe thought of her being worse off then he was when he had tried to shove her out of the way concerned him to a point where his optics frantically searched the field, his own body still tattered and bleeding�a huge gash along along his back and side causing mech fluid to puddle around him. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
