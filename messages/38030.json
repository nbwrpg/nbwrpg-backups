Stright \n&gt; over the Iron fist and the old base of the alliance.  Meanwhile, \n&gt; Inside the Oblivion of Pherical hologram of the Earth shows \nDarkfate \n&gt; approaching the area of the Infecticon ship. Not one to waste time \n&gt; Frostbite taps a green button. A moment the later the ocean \nbeaneath \n&gt; Darkfate seemingly egins to bulge before it parts off to the side \nto \n&gt; show a bright circular energy field hoding the sea from falling in \non \n&gt; the ship. On another portion of the ship, two small portions open \nup \n&gt; before two odd looking ships seemingly flying like a vertical like \n&gt; exit and fire out into the ocean. Each then flys off towards the \n&gt; surface before they break through and the bottom folds out into \n&gt; wings. Each one passenger ship then speeds off towards the location \n&gt; of the IGL transmission.\n\n\n"}}
