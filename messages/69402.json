Eve=\r\nn though the wars were past, his memory of that one brutal battle against D=\r\necepticon foe remains as sharp as if it had just happened a day or so befor=\r\ne.  \n\nThings were different now.  There was talk of peace with Megatron.  T=\r\nhe thought of putting differences asside was comforting yet he wasn&#39;t quite=\r\n sure he could ever forgive any Decepticon for what was done against his co=\r\nmrades and himself.  He finds himself betwixed between being happy and feel=\r\ning frustrated.  But Frustration would soon be melted away with the thought=\r\ns of a little leisurely target practice, involving make shift targets.  \n\n&quot;=\r\n Time to see if those adjustments I made on your mechanisms will optimize y=\r\nour performance.&quot;\n\nWith a weak smile, he feels for his cross bow, and scans=\r\n his left hand into a quiver of arrows, taking one gingerly and placing it =\r\ninside his weapon.  As if he had his optics in full working order, Tucson m=\r\nanages to load his weapon swiftly and raises the cross bow to meet the heig=\r\nht of his target.  Before aiming and firing, he sends a sonar wave to bounc=\r\ne off the target, giving him ample information as to where to aim his arrow=\r\n head.  He finds it quickly, and releases the trigger.  \n\nThe swish of a fa=\r\nst flying arrow soon meets the target with an explosion of ample force, as =\r\nhis target is struck but not with the accuracy he had been hoping for, nor =\r\nwith the force.\n\n&quot;Hmmm, that didn&#39;t sound too bad, but not exactly what I w=\r\nas hoping to accomplish.  I think I better scan over your mechanisms once m=\r\nore.&quot;\n\nHe takes the cross bow and sits down on a boulder of alloy, scanning=\r\n his fingers over the cross bow&#39;s springs, and trigger mechanisms.  The wea=\r\npon was of his own making and Tucson would only be satisfied with it when i=\r\nt performed to it&#39;s optimal performance level.\n\n\n"}}
