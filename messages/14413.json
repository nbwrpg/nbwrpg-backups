No\noffense to the owner, of course, my bots deaths have gotten extremely\ngruesome and I figured that it would be an ideal thing to have your bots get\ntheir arms cleaved off and all kinds of wicked stuff before they die. Deemos\ndid some pretty wicked things to Artist, and how about the deaths of Weight\nand Time Bomb? Loved those!...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, September 05, 2000 8:45 PM\nSubject: The Alliance\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I just talked to Panzertron over IM (he&#39;s the bot in charge of the Iron\n&gt; Fist), and he said that he can no longer keep up. He has two jobs and is\n&gt; taking colledge corses online. He asked me if I could take over his\ncharacter\n&gt; and have him die a grusoume, terrible death. You guys can email him if you\n&gt; want.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/Panzertron/Reptilica::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus&#39; comp beeps, the Alliance commander looking down at it. It was a\n&gt; transmission from Panzertron.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Zardus,&quot; it read, &quot;I want you to meet me at the Iron Fist. I think its\ntime\n&gt; to strengthen the treaty between the Alliance and the Militron.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus nods. &quot;I&#39;ll be right there,&quot; he says, walking off toward the exit.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica nods at Burning Hammer. &quot;Allright, then, so you won&#39;t be\nfighting\n&gt; any battles?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
