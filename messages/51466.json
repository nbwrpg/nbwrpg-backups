He didn&#39;t marvel for long at this, though, as \n&gt; the three plasma shots came at him. He dodged one, barely, but not the \n&gt; second and third. One of his two missile racks was destroyed by the \n&gt; attack, and he was spun to the ground. He sttod up and fired in \n&gt; Wolfenstein&#39;s legs with his pulse lasers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Elsewhere, Proto had successfully taken grip of Tyrael&#39;s arm and was \n&gt; mauling it. Tyrael, however, did not consider this a tragedy. He \n&gt; turned off the two turrets from Megastorm and directed them at any \n&gt; enemy, basically Inferno and Quickstrike.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Megastorm? Is that you?! Haha! You have changed! As for what \n&gt; to do... FIGHT FOR THE CAUSE&#39;S SAKE! FIGHT THEM ALL OFF!\n&gt; \n&gt; He swiftly took a light shard and cut his own arm just above where \n&gt; Proto was. The bleeding consisted of a massive surge of energon and \n&gt; energy. It would at the very least fry some of Proto&#39;s liquid \n&gt; circuits.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: ONWARD, TRIPREDACUS! OFFER NO PITY TO THE ENEMIES!\n&gt; \n&gt; He fired four small blasts at Proto.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Airshadow Nightstar&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ????::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The dragon femme moved close to Tyrael with the purpose of cover his \n&gt; back. \n&gt; &gt; When she took her position she aimed and opened fire against \n&gt; Skullentron.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: Tyrael/Wolfenstein\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 03 Sep 2002 22:19:29 -0000\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Tyrael managed to take flight and thus avoiding some of the major\n&gt; &gt; &gt;shots. Seeing another shot coming from a large tank that had just\n&gt; &gt; &gt;arrived, he rises higher and avoids the large blast that could have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;blown him down. The smaller shots however did get to him, and his \n&gt; leg\n&gt; &gt; &gt;was getting weak. He wouldn&#39;t be able to use that talon for some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;He saw that Skulletron was trying to coordinate with Wolfenstein, \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the tank&#39;s arrival made things more complicated. A plan formed in \n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;head.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;He directed two turrets to concentrate fire on the new bot and \n&gt; follow\n&gt; &gt; &gt;it. They both unleashed a hellfire of laser beams at him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Tyrael: Khan Vlad! Forward and do not stop! We drive them back now!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Vlad: Are you certain, Major?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;The Clanner looked around. The brunt of the enemy opposition was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;situated on a northeastern frontline from the base. Inferno and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Quickstrike were near, but the base defenses could handle the pair.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Vlad: I see... (He turned to Inferno) I withdraw my claim on you as \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt;opponent. Forward Tyrael!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;He turned to Wolfenstein, transformed then used his medium laser on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the hairy bot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;At the same moment, Tyrael let go another volley of needles on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Skulletron, dived down and slashed twice at him with his \n&gt; razor-sharp\n&gt; &gt; &gt;feathers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Eric Bischoff&quot; &lt;1641coburn@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : : Skulletron : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Skulletron nods, then he points to Tyrael.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Skulletron:  That&#39;s the bot in charge of the Tripreds.  I need \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to go and take his attention, but try not to get hurt.  And please,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;try to resist aggression, or else this will be harder for me.  Can \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;do that, comrade?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Charle con sus amigos online usando MSN Messenger: \n&gt; http://messenger.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
