She landed on \n&gt; her side.  She got up but limping.  The crash with the wall injured \n&gt; her right shoulder.\n&gt; Despite the pain, she walked over to Quickstrike and Stringtra.\n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here!&quot; She couldn&#39;t transform with her broken \n&gt; shoulder. &quot;Come on! Stringtra, can you carry Quickstrike?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Rowdy Wolf/Terrorsaur:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Metal Beast showed no pain as KitKat latched her teeth onto its \n&gt; leg. It \n&gt; &gt; reared up, swung its leg that KitKat was on, and launched her \n&gt; across the \n&gt; &gt; section.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rowdy Wolf fired his rifle at the wolf-bot. He heard the shot \n&gt; ricochet \n&gt; &gt; inside of its shoulder. It turned its head to Rowdy Wolf, with two \n&gt; beady red \n&gt; &gt; eyes glaring at him. He froze for a second, then came to \n&gt; again. &quot;Get out of \n&gt; &gt; here! Go!&quot; He waved his arm in the air. &quot;Slag it, run!&quot; he shouted \n&gt; a the \n&gt; &gt; others. He fired again, onto the Metal Beast&#39;s leg as he stomped \n&gt; towards \n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Terrorsaur didn&#39;t seem like he was going to stay. He paced in mid-\n&gt; air, \n&gt; &gt; trying to study the Vok creation. He flew over top of Stingtra&#39;s \n&gt; head. He \n&gt; &gt; flew down and slashed at the wires that connected to Quickstrike&#39;s \n&gt; head.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Blow the cavern!&quot; he shouted. He flew to the side and turned his \n&gt; shoulder \n&gt; &gt; cannons at the wall of the cavern. He fired multile times.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; __\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
