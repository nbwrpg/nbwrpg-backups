Still, in the same vici=\r\nnity as Scourge, Cyclonus and Rodimus, he manages to keep himself out of si=\r\nght, using the skills which had been taught to him by Prowl. Quietly he sta=\r\nnds up against a wall in a dark crevace of the room, making no sound. He th=\r\ninks for just a moment at how cowardice this must seem. To try and make a m=\r\nove and then recede into darkness like a spinless glitch. That he was not. =\r\nHe could feel the hold Cyclonus had over Rodimus and it enrages him to the =\r\npoint where he grips his fists in anger. He thinks to himself.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve come=\r\n this far, I just can&#39;t give up and turn the other way. Rodimus, whether he=\r\n knows it or not, needs my help. But how to go about this? This is somethin=\r\ng Kup nor Prowl trained me to do.&quot;\n\nHe puts his hand on his chest. His acti=\r\nons were of his spark, not of his mind. His spark was telling him to contin=\r\nue on and not give up. \nHe remembers the good days when Rodimus was very cl=\r\nose to all his Autobot comrades, and how many battles were won thanks to hi=\r\nm and his guidence. And now, it appeared that Rodimus was the one who neede=\r\nd to be rescued. He closes his eyes in thought.\n\n&quot; Optimus Prime, what woul=\r\nd you have done if you were in my position? If there were a time when I nee=\r\nded your guidence, it&#39;s now. Rodimus needs me but how? How can I pull this =\r\noff? I&#39;m just one Autobot with only his bare spark leading him...&quot; \n\nIn tho=\r\nught he tries to go back to a time, when he had met Optimus Prime as a youn=\r\ng rookie in training. He flashes back to one particular moment when he actu=\r\nally got the opportunity to talk to the great Autobot leader. He remembers =\r\nhow he was told that no matter how dim a situation was, there was always a =\r\nlight to guide them through. It comes to him, the very verse Rodimus had sa=\r\nid when he first took up the Matrix of Leadership.\n\n&quot;Light our Darkest Hour=\r\n.&quot; He thinks to himself at first.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s it. That&#39;s what Optimus Prime wo=\r\nuld have done. But instead of the Matrix it&#39;s up to ME to light our darkest=\r\n hour. Of course, I awoke first, it must mean something. All right, Tucson =\r\nget off your sorry aft and make this happen.&quot;\n\nHe gathers the strength to w=\r\nalk into where he could be seen, judging by the heat that lights were givin=\r\ng off, as faint as the lights may be. He stands before Cyclonus, and Scourg=\r\ne unarmed, yet ready to defend himself if need be.\n\n&quot; Yes, you do have some=\r\none here. And that someone is me. I don&#39;t know if you remember me or not, w=\r\ne may not have even met. My name is Tucson and I&#39;m proud to say that I am a=\r\n member of the Autobot faction.&quot; \n\nHe then senses Rodimus not too far away.=\r\n\n\n&quot; All right, Rodimus, I have a question for you, and you may answer at wi=\r\nll. What was the very verse that brought the Matrix of Leadership to life, =\r\nthus giving you the power of its spark? I know you know this, and right now=\r\n you may be hating my sorry servos, but I think I could use a refresher on =\r\nwhat it was. Can you tell me?&quot;\n\nHe was now preparing himself to get the bol=\r\nts beaten out of him. This would either make or break things. It was a heck=\r\n of a gamble yet Tucson knew it was his greatest Trump Card and he was not =\r\nafraid to use it. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyc=\r\nlonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras&#39; extended his invitation to Cyclonus, and S=\r\ncourge, Rodimus was surprised for a moment, but then just leaned back again=\r\nst a support beam, his arms once again folded across his chest.
