Getting =\r\nnow that\n&gt; &gt; SKYBYTE was seemingly directing them, but holding back behind =\r\nthe fray, he\n&gt; &gt; let out a snarl.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Going to try and whip up his tail=\r\n cannon to blast a snap shot at SKYBYTE,\n&gt; &gt; one of the SHARKTICONS leaping=\r\n up and latching it&#39;s teeth inot it, half\n&gt; &gt; severing DINOBOT&#39;s ARM!\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The blast from DINOBOT&#39;s cannon sped fast and true across the ca=\r\nve\n&gt; floor, moving past several SHARKTICONS including several that\n&gt; attemp=\r\nted to intercept it and hit SKYBYTE square in the chest, sending\n&gt; the bot =\r\nsprawling across the floor!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Quickstride was=\r\n getting tired of the Sharkitcons and gets into\n&gt; &gt; robot mode bearing his =\r\nover the shoulder blast cannon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Okay, that&#39;s it, it&#39;s fish frying=\r\n time!  Heads up Rattrap!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rattrap quickly scoots out of Quickstrid=\r\nes way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; FIRE IN THE HOLE!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride now attempts to ta=\r\nke out a large group of Sharkticons with a\n&gt; &gt; shot from the blast cannon.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The attack from the shoulder blast cannon does indeed seem to have an\n=\r\n&gt; affect as several go down at once, a couple even exploding into\n&gt; multico=\r\nlored clouds of metal and ash!\n&gt; \n&gt; Much like of DINOBOT it would appear th=\r\nat QUICKSTRIDE&#39;s cannon is\n&gt; thinning out their numbers. However with SKYBY=\r\nTE now temporally\n&gt; distracted by DINOBOT&#39;s blast it takes them a few momen=\r\nts more to\n&gt; recover this time -- A few moments that the MAXIMAL FUZORS use=\r\n to\n&gt; their advantage, flying in and attacking SKYBYTE himself!\n&gt; \n&gt; NOCTOR=\r\nRO, among the fastest of their number streaks in to tackle the\n&gt; already hi=\r\nt SHARTICON leader while AIRHAMMER and BANTOR tried\n&gt; valiantly to keep the=\r\n slowly ebbing tide of SHARKTICONS off of\n&gt; NOCOTORRO!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Meanwhile, VICE GRIP was being gradually..  Chewed apart by the SHARKTICON=\r\nS,\n&gt; &gt; buried in a pile of them and thrashing about, his most opwerful weap=\r\nons\n&gt; &gt; useless as he was SHARKPILED&lt; their teeth threatening tos kewer him=\r\n layer by\n&gt; &gt; layer!\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The SHARKTICONS continue to attempt to=\r\n maul VICE GRIP, their teeth\n&gt; trying to grind through his armor . . .  unt=\r\nil suddenly they are not!\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickly, as if stung, they rose into the air=\r\n going to defend their\n&gt; master who was now under assault by the MAXIMAL FU=\r\nZORS and, at least\n&gt; for a moment, DINOBOT!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson con=\r\ncentrates and remains focused as he continues to match Magmatrons\n&gt; &gt; moves=\r\n simply to defend himself against his onslaught.  He knew his sword was\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n not big as Magmatrons nor was it made to handle its power.  Knowing that, =\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; opts not to use the sword.    Narrowing a brow in thought he quickly=\r\n goes\n&gt; &gt; from robot to beast mode, landing on his hind feet and using his =\r\nfront legs\n&gt; &gt; as arms and hands.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The sword may not have the streng=\r\nth nor the size but he knew his tail could\n&gt; &gt; be strong and long enough of=\r\n a weapon for him.  With surprising grace he\n&gt; &gt; whirls the tail masterfull=\r\ny into a coil and slaps at Magmatrons sword to\n&gt; &gt; attempt a tail block by =\r\nslapping it with the side of the skinnier part of\n&gt; &gt; his long tail with a =\r\nforceful swipe.  His long neck coils back like that of\n&gt; &gt; a serpent ready =\r\nto strike.  Yet he remains calm without any explosive\n&gt; &gt; temperamental out=\r\nbursts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; A worthy opponent indeed.  But can you face me in  your o=\r\nwn beast mode as\n&gt; &gt; I am facing you in mine?  You seem attached to your ro=\r\nbot mode, Magmatron,\n&gt; &gt; is there something you&#39;re not telling me, about yo=\r\nur level of expertise?  Or\n&gt; &gt; is it that because you are contrived of a mi=\r\nxture of creatures that are not\n&gt; &gt; known for combative agility?  As you ca=\r\nn well imagine, a dragon faces\n&gt; &gt; similar weaknesses.  And you may ask you=\r\nrself why would a dragon take on a\n&gt; &gt; posture that would expose him to inj=\r\nury?  Or is it that the dragon may have\n&gt; &gt; learned to adapt to such weakne=\r\nsses?  Now I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a very charismatic\n&gt; &gt; individual but, are you w=\r\nitty enough to step outside the box?  Let&#39;s see if\n&gt; &gt; you are.  Come on th=\r\nen, I&#39;m sure a beast of your caliber can make short work\n&gt; &gt; of a smaller m=\r\nountain dragon.  Show me what you&#39;re really made of,\n&gt; &gt; transform, and fac=\r\ne me in your beast mode!  I dare you to do the unusual!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; MA=\r\nGMATRON laughed as TUSCON made his challenge. &quot;You have no knowledge\n&gt; of j=\r\nust who I am yet, do you?&quot; He laughed again as he yelled out,\n&gt; &quot;MAGMATRON =\r\n. . . BRUTALIZE!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As he yelled his body form shifted, moving from his =\r\nrobot mode to a\n&gt; dragon mode, in some elemental ways similar to that of TU=\r\nSCON&#39;S\n&gt; although much larger and more robust. Armored from snout to rump\n&gt;=\r\n MAGMATON stood up on his hind legs and flapped his wings in an almost\n&gt; le=\r\nisurely fashion. His long tail flipped behind him like a whip as he\n&gt; looke=\r\nd over at his opponent.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am taking it easy on you Maximal, showing y=\r\nou your place =96 because\n&gt; I can see that you do not know it yet.&quot; He chuc=\r\nkled menacingly. &quot;But\n&gt; you are beginning to annoy me with your prattle!&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; He opened his mouth a breathed out a blast of fire and plasma!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nOLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Noightlight took the quills that fell around her andhide them =\r\nwith the\n&gt; &gt; others that Straightshot had given her in the Ark. She tried t=\r\no remain\n&gt; &gt; conceuos but dificulty she can do it\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\ntraightshot looks to Torca with a thumbs up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Direct hit, nice one=\r\n Torca!  Oh before he gets up, think you could blast\n&gt; &gt; the rock that&#39;s ov=\r\ner him for me?  If ya get what I&#39;m getting at.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She points to a lar=\r\nge structure of rock that&#39;s over the cave.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; TORCA nodded as =\r\nhe fired upward, his firepower hitting the top of the\n&gt; cave! With a loud c=\r\nrack stone and rock dislodge themselves and large\n&gt; pieces fall from the ro=\r\nof!\n&gt; \n&gt; SABERBACK had not been paying attention to TORCA or STRAIGHTSHOT.\n=\r\n&gt; Instead he had been looking at OPTIMUS PRIME who instead of being dead\n&gt; =\r\nas he had thought had just opened crimson optics. So it was that one\n&gt; of t=\r\nhe large pieces of stone hit SABERBACK square in the back pinning\n&gt; him to =\r\nthe ground, its size and bulk totally obscured SABERBACK from\n&gt; view!\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nSmall stones hit NIGHTLIGHT as well, but most of them were about the\n&gt; size=\r\n of pebbles to about the size of golf balls.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time DARK ROD=\r\nIMUS and RODIMUS PRIME were on the bridge\n&gt; over the pit battling, exchangi=\r\nng one blow for the other, slugging it\n&gt; out. Gone was any play at finesse =\r\nor art, gone was any knowledge of\n&gt; martial art or style, it was pure brute=\r\n strength and tenacity that\n&gt; kept these two going.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, above t=\r\nhem, over the pit the darkened figure of OPTIMUS\n&gt; PRIME looked at the appr=\r\noaching figures of the PREDACON FUZORS who had\n&gt; been fighting their way ac=\r\nross the battle field to get to him and then\n&gt; glanced down at the two figu=\r\nres fighting below him smiling as he did\n&gt; so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking up at his hands=\r\n he clenched his fists and with a massive surge\n&gt; of power broke the chains=\r\n that held him and he began to plummet down\n&gt; towards the pit and towards R=\r\nODIMUS and DARK RODIMUS who were up to\n&gt; this point totally unaware of the =\r\nthreat coming right at him!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
