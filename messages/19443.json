Gives me the programmin&#39;, and what the \nnecklace does and how it works. WIth any luck, it works by \ntransmittin&#39; data back to the bot, in which case we can trace it back \nto the bot and get &#39;im. My chips worked without any sort of data \ntransferr back to me, but ones that are effective are really hard and \nexpensive to produce, an&#39; easy t&#39; cancel out. Gets easier t&#39; do stuff \nyourself.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Diamond::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah,well, the old cuffs and things worked well.  But a bot could \n&gt; get out of them.  IF one knew how, one could break the connection \n&gt; permenantly. Thus become free from them.&quot;  \n&gt; She looked at the ground as she remembered when she found the way \nto \n&gt; break her link and become free.  That was a few months before the \n&gt; council even realized she was no longer in thier control.\n&gt; &quot;Yeah,  the cuffs and other devices were good, but not fool proof.&quot;\n&gt; She smiled slightly, thinking, this fool beat out a fool proof \nsystem.\n&gt; &quot;You said you use chips now? Things must have advanced since I left \n&gt; home.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She stood up and walked over to the machine,&quot;So what will this \nthing \n&gt; tell us about that necklace?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
