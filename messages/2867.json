Across the ship, lights glare brighter for a few seconds. The \ncontrolls beep, reporting the power levels jumping toward 120%.\n\nIn the CR room, an electric shock passes through the dead body of Ramulus, \nwhich was left in a CR chamber, and due to that was now fully repaired.\n\nAbove the planet, a spark falters on it&#39;s jeorney to the matrix. A strange \npower pulling it back, the spark heads toward earth, and eventually into the \nArk.\n\nRamulus opens his eyes, his internal computer reporting that he was fully \nfunctional. He stands up, exiting the CR chamber. Ramulus blinks several \ntimes.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m .... alive,&quot; he says in surprise, questions drifting through his mind. \nWhat had happened? He growls as he remembers the battle against the predacons \nin which he had been killed. Why was he alive now?\n\nRamulus takes a few steps and smiles. By whatever means he had been \nressurected, he was alive, that was good enough for him!\n\n&quot;Liono,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;Ramulus here. Reporting for duty.&quot;\n\nRamulus walks off toward the bridge.\n\n"}}
