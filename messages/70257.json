He \n&gt; thinks back to the time when he did his best to cause a diversion that \n&gt; would have allowed Rodimus to escape free of harm.  But instead of that \n&gt; happening, he had been shot and taken off line before he had the chance to \n&gt; save him.  For that he felt guilty.  He looks to Night Shift, who quickly \n&gt; gets the idea of what he&#39;s trying to tell him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Right, change of plans again. Here, gimme Windlord&#39;n I&#39;ll make sure he \n&gt; gets outa here safely with Perceptor&#39;n Nightlight.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime hands him Windlord as Night Shift takes the same gentile \n&gt; approach as did he.  He looks to Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Okay, change of plans, we&#39;re outa here and they&#39;re stayn&#39; behind. \n&gt; C&#39;mon, we gotta burn rubber!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime then looks to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No Rodimus, this isn&#39;t all your fault.  A lot of it if not all of it, is \n&gt; actually my fault.  The day we fought off Hydras&#39;s lackies two years ago, \n&gt; I had managed to deal with the ones I was fighting against and saw that \n&gt; you, Nightlight and Windlord were in desperate need of help.  So I went as \n&gt; fast as I could, to try and divert enemy fire away from you, but I failed \n&gt; to check a blind spot in my rear view mirror, and I was shot from behind, \n&gt; rendering me inoperable and blind.  If I had just taken more careful \n&gt; survey of what was around me, none of this, including what happened to \n&gt; you, would never have happened.  Now, now is the time to make it up to \n&gt; you.  We&#39;ll fight them together.  Scorponok doesn&#39;t scare me, none of them \n&gt; do.  All right Jhiaxus, don&#39;t expect me to make this easy for you because \n&gt; I&#39;m not!  As I&#39;ve said to Scorponok before, I will not fold to any of you, \n&gt; no matter what damages you instill on me!\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside the fortress, Rat Trap transforms into rat form and scrambles for \n&gt; thick brush, trying to virtually vanish into the vegitation in an alluding \n&gt; maneuver.  Meanwhile, Quickstride remains in equine form, and continues to \n&gt; kick, buck, stomp, and even motion to bite the enemies if they get too \n&gt; close.  With his ears aback, smoke billows from his flairing nostrills. \n&gt; As his hooves slam on the ground the ground around them vibrates, due to \n&gt; the sheer force of his quick but strong movements.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;looks like these chumps are just itching ta be turned inta scrap yard \n&gt; material!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap tries an evasive maneuver while scampering in a figure eight \n&gt; pattern beneath his enemies, hoping that they&#39;d accidentally crash into \n&gt; each other, due to the dizzing motions he&#39;s making.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Then allow me ta help.  I may not have the umph you got, but I certainly \n&gt; got the brains for the job.. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Who: RODIMUS PRIME, CYCLONUS, SCOURGE, JHIAXUS, SCORPONOK, Tuscon,\n&gt;&gt; Nightshift, Darkhawk, Perceptor\n&gt;&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Tunnels beneath the Black Fortress\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Dont cross in my way, Rodimus&quot;while he tried to hold his emotions that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; first time in centuries overhelmed him &quot;I dont want to have to destroy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you... You and Nightlight were the only friends that I had...&quot;he \n&gt;&gt; &gt; sighed&quot;The\n&gt;&gt; &gt; kid was right, I&#39;m aging&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus nodded, sadness mixed with resigned resolution crossing his\n&gt;&gt; face. He orients his weapon again, trying to find a shot that wouldn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; kill him but would look good when the sound of falling earth could be\n&gt;&gt; heard echoing from down the tunnel, and the distinct sound of drilling\n&gt;&gt; erupted into the hall for a moment and then grinds to a stop.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus turned his weapon to face this new threat as Cyclonus and\n&gt;&gt; Jhiaxus step from the hole in the wall, one obviously made by\n&gt;&gt; Skorponok who was still in Scorpion mode. Scourge stepped out as well,\n&gt;&gt; and like the others his weapons drawn.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Well Well&quot; Jhiaxus said as he stepped clearly into the tunnel, &quot;It\n&gt;&gt; would seem we have found Perceptor after all Cyclonus.&quot; Jhiaxus said,\n&gt;&gt; his face was cold as he spoke, yet with a hint of some dark humor,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Consorting with the enemy are we?&quot; his voice was confident, almost\n&gt;&gt; smug. &quot;That is most unfortunate.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Unknown to most, while Jhiaxus was talking, Cyclonus was transmitting\n&gt;&gt; this to Hydras, making sure he heard it all.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;GO!&quot; Rodimus said fiercly to Tuscon and Perceptor, &quot;Its too late for\n&gt;&gt; anything else now. &quot;I will hold them so you can get away! Get\n&gt;&gt; Nightlight and Windlord out of here! This is my mess, and I will\n&gt;&gt; finish it! GO!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus turned to face the slowly advancing Decepticons.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (OOC: I have a few plans for Rodimus, but feel free to stay or go as\n&gt;&gt; you folks see fit)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
