He might be Autobot, but the old geezer is no fool. You \nare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there for a purpose. Even the Tripredacus Council knew that!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again, she growled at him. Alpha Trion was one of those she \nloathed.\n&gt; He was \n&gt; &gt; one of those responsible or so she tagged, for the demise of her\n&gt; mentor... & \n&gt; &gt; one of Megatron&#39;s creators... Gamma Quadran. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I belong to no one,&quot; she growled at Tyrael. &quot;Least of all Alpha \nTrion!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As to a plan that was in store for her.. she didn&#39;t care. She made\n&gt; her own \n&gt; &gt; destiny. & as long as the Decepticons were a major part of it. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He turned to Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tyrael: By the way, Hydras, did you know that we were the ones\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manipulating the Predacons all along?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She didn&#39;t wait for Hydras&#39; response to him. She wanted this \nTripred so \n&gt; &gt; terribly, to feel his life fluids dripping through her claws after\n&gt; she ripped him \n&gt; &gt; apart.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She charged at him with her saber ready to strike. &quot;Best beg to\n&gt; Primus, you \n&gt; &gt; will NEED it!&quot; she growled in hate & loathing. Pure evil dripping\n&gt; from her \n&gt; &gt; voice as her crimson optics glowed. Despite her damage, she went \non.\n&gt; She had to, \n&gt; &gt; she must. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swinging her saber hard at his neck, the other ready to jab at his\n&gt; midsection \n&gt; &gt; or block if needed.\n\n\n"}}
