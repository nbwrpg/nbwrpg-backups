This means \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that if the scans I asked are positive, we will\n&gt; &gt; raid one of the \n&gt; &gt; base. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Our objective here is not to eradicate our enemy,\n&gt; &gt; only to pinpoint \n&gt; &gt; &gt; their position, if they are truly here. However,\n&gt; &gt; if I am right, \n&gt; &gt; there \n&gt; &gt; &gt; should be two bases. We will divide our group and\n&gt; &gt; raid both bases at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Burrock arrived soon enough. He took no time to\n&gt; &gt; transform to robot \n&gt; &gt; mode. His right arm consisted of the flailing\n&gt; &gt; tendrils that had ripped \n&gt; &gt; the pod in two. His left arm was normal looking. He\n&gt; &gt; stood only 8 feet \n&gt; &gt; up, but his strength was undeniable. What was more\n&gt; &gt; disturbing was the \n&gt; &gt; absence of eyes or optics sensors. The bot was\n&gt; &gt; blind.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Burrock: You Tyrael? Who&#39;s that guy?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael: Yes, I am Major Tyrael (he insisted on  the\n&gt; &gt; Major). This is \n&gt; &gt; Lieutenant Shadow Star, second in command of this\n&gt; &gt; group. We are the \n&gt; &gt; Tripredacus Strikers, and our mission here is to\n&gt; &gt; find and neutralize \n&gt; &gt; Megatron. We were about to mount a raid. I think you\n&gt; &gt; will function \n&gt; &gt; well with Shadow Star.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Burrock: Yeah, whatever. So, SS, whaddaya have to\n&gt; &gt; say about me going \n&gt; &gt; with your team?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\n&gt; http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n\n"}}
