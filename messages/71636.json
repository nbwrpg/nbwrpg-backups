All\n&gt; right, Fractyl, you have the floor, please tell us your input. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He tries to comfort Talon by rubbing his head against her shoulder with a\n&gt; gentile touch.\n\n&lt;NEW - Fractyl &gt;\n\nFRACTYL flew over to HYDRAS  pointedly ignoring TUSCON and TALON for\nthe moment. He transformed into robot mode setting down some sort of\nspary dispenser that looked like it had been cobbled together out of\nold parts. It looked rusted and ill fitting, how it did seem to work.\n\n&quot;I have constructed a specific type of acidic isotope that will break\ndown the molecular structure of the reptiles.&quot; FRACTYL pointed over at\nthe dinosaurs that he had just sprayed, &quot;You see. Their molecular\nstructure has already begun to liquify. It will in time become gaseous\nand be dissipated on the breezes.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Elita&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Havent your momie taught you not to spy others chat?&quot; said Elite with a\n&gt; childish tone&quot;and I&#39;m training to be a warrior and then I&#39;ll teach you a\n&gt; lesson if you try to hurt my momie&quot;\n\n&gt;  &lt;OLD - Nightshift&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Nightshift securely locks Elita inside his cab and secures all\n&gt; doors in his vehicle mode.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Sorry fellas, can&#39;t touch this.  No Preds allowed in and around the frame,\n&gt; off limits, private property, access denied!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW - Scourge&gt;\n\nSOURGE just chuckled evilly at ELITA&#39;s statement but saying nothing\nelse to either one of them as he moved foward ahead of them. Behind\nhim his sweeps fell in, they were dangerous wolves falling in behind\ntheir pack leader.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Straight Shot&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; While with Waspinator, Straight Shot giggles with delight.  She loved a\n&gt; little thrill seeking and being almost dropped was actually exciting to her.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s okay, it was actually kinda fun.  I&#39;ve never had the opportunity to\n&gt; fly and I&#39;m enjoying it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She transforms into her robot mode and catches hold to Waspinator&#39;s spindly\n&gt; legs, keeping a sure but gentile grip on it.  She keeps her beacon on track\n&gt; mode while flying with what could very well be an evolving friendship.  She\n&gt; looks up to Waspinator with a smile and a thumbs up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;re still on track, and my beacon is  rapidly flashing.  We must be\n&gt; getting close.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She now swings herself up onto his back, carefully minding his wings.  She\n&gt; proves to be a very light passenger as she rides contently on the Predacon&#39;s\n&gt; back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I never thought that I would ever make friends among enemies but, I think I\n&gt; just did.  Nobody has ta know anything except for us.   What&#39;d ya say?\n&gt; Friends?  I promise never ta tell Leo or Rodimus.  Tucson will understand\n&gt; but I don&#39;t think the other two will.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t exactly tell what was happening to her but whatever it was,\n&gt; certainly didn&#39;t bother her in the least.\n\n&lt;NEW - Waspinator&gt;\n\n&quot;Wazzpinator is a -Predacon-&quot; Waspinator buzzed angrilly his wings\npicking up speed as he moved higher into the skies. &quot;He is not a\nhorze-bot!&quot; He flips around as she attempted to sit on him grasping\nher with two of his legs again.\n\n&quot;Arrow-bot just show Wazzpinator where signal is coming from.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
