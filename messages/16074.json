He walked to his desk, and sat. He activated a\nholo projector. There was a holo picture of Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus,\nSpringer, ArrCee, Gold Bug, Kup, and other Autobots, Aerialbots, and the\nDinobots, as well as himself. Tears of oil, and other mech fluids\nappeared in his eyes, and ran down his cheek. It had been a long time\nsince he had looked at this, and saw his old friends. Many were\nperminetly offline, or retired. These were the bots and friends that he\nsearved with, for millions of years. He clicked a switch, and a large\npic of Optimus Prime appeared. Hot Rod put his head in his hands, and\nlooked at the pic. He began talking in a wisper, to his former mentor,\nteacher, and dearest friend.\n&quot;Hello, Optimus. It&#39;s been a long time.&quot; He went on for two hours,\nbefore going to the CR room for a recharge. He looked for Feline.\n&quot;Hello? Honey?&quot;\n\n"}}
