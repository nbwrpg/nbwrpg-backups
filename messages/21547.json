Then Destructor grabbed her and \nflew off to the new base.  Right Now, KitKat is dented up, has holes \nin her armor and is leaking. But she has business to attend to before \nshe can get tot he CR tank. GoldenEye and Terrorsaur are still at the \nfight scene. I&#39;m sure if Quickstrike is there or not. The tretreat \nhappened so fast, I hardly had time to keep up. I&#39;m sorry KSLawdogg, \nit kind of got away from me.  Ah, but yes, KitKat did take on damage. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
