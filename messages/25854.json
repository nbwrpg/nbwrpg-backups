He listens through, looking at the body of the \nqueen and considering something. At the end he stands up, asking a \nquestion.\n\n&quot;If one of us volunteers for that thing,&quot; he says, reffering to the \nqueen, &quot;Will we keep our memories and stuff?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dachande&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Magmatron::\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Yes, please take a seat,&quot; Magmatron said, looking over the \ntable. The lights brightened at his look. Then he began his speach.\n&gt;     &quot;Now, we have reformed. You will all be given quarters, and we \nwill be taking things at a much more....agressive tone. We have made \nrelations with the Alliance. And from what Cerberus has shown me, \nthey are quite powerful, we are not able to take them on directly.\n&gt;     &quot;Our first target, though, will be the remaining Predacons. \nScanners have reported a big ship landing nearby, and if they get \norganized they will be quite, well, more worthy opponents then they \nare.&quot;\n&gt;     He started to walk around to all of them. &quot;Good, we have \nDestrons capable of flight, that can be a great source of attack. I \nwould like to introduce you to a mainstay in out army. Nightmares, \nDachande, Preatorian, and Jynx, please step up.&quot; ::They step \nup:: &quot;These our the more powerful warriors I have created, Beast \nMode.&quot; ::They transform to Beast Mode::  &quot;As you will notice they all \nhave almost the same Beast Mode, meaning that they would be hard to \nnotice one in a crowd. Ahh, but they are in need of powerful Sparks \nto control them. I am one, but then another, for more direct battle \ncontrol, is needed. They will command this new body.&quot; ::A panal opens \nfrom the right of Magmatron and in it is the Queen, she raises her \nhead and stares at the other Destrons, then she hisses and shows off \nher inner mouth:: &quot;A magnificent, isn&#39;t it? I admire it&#39;s perfection, \nit has no fear, no reason to fear. But back to the subject at hand. \nThe Cybertronian Fire is under attack by the Alliance, well, they are \nat a cease fire. They are quite weak now, the Maximals. But, the \nPredacons are not organized at all. Then there are the smaller \ngroups, the Mafia, the Stunticons, the smaller Maximal groups, we \ncould easily take them out. I shall take your questions now.&quot;\n&gt;     Before anybody says anything Magmatron interupts. &quot;Ohh, and one \nmore thing, Optimus Prime, the &#39;great&#39; Autobot leader, is among us on \nthis planet. He has been changed to darkness by some unseen force, I \nwish to know more, If you see him, do not engage, just watch.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
