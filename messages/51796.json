If she\nwas then I&#39;ll apologize, if not than everyone else\nshould apologize for flaming me and filling the board\nwith all these OOCs.\nAnd I don&#39;t see women as &quot;just&quot; sexual objects, that\nwould be rude, and anti-Christian (please don&#39;t start\na big debate because I used that word).  I currently\nhave a crush on a mediocre looking girl (face and body\nwise) because she&#39;s polite to me and we have common\ninterests.  Actually, I have no intention of EVER\nletting her know I like her because she&#39;s one of my\nfew friends and I&#39;m worried I&#39;d embarrase her, or\nannoy her and she&#39;d get angry and say something rude,\nand I&#39;d get angry and say something rude back, and\nwe&#39;d end up hating each other (exactly what&#39;s happened\nwith every girl I&#39;ve ever liked, so not this one).\n\n--- Eric Bischoff &lt;1641coburn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC:  Kyle, I&#39;m going to have to teach you a lesson\n&gt; little boy.  First of all, your name isn&#39;t Kyle, and\n&gt; I refuse to call you that from now on.  Second of\n&gt; all, about your intelligence.  Being intelligent is\n&gt; only good in a very little way.  You can have the\n&gt; highest IQ in all of damned history, yet it&#39;s still\n&gt; nothing without WISDOM.  You lack wisdom, and\n&gt; therefore your intelligence is a joke.\n&gt; \n&gt; Second of all, I am not weird if I don&#39;t see women\n&gt; as nothing more than mere sexual objects.  I don&#39;t\n&gt; want to have children or marry somebody.  I\n&gt; extremely LOVE being alone, and I plan to be alone\n&gt; all of my life.  If I EVER want to have somebody\n&gt; there for me, it might as well be the VERY few\n&gt; friends I have.  Let&#39;s just say I have a lot less\n&gt; than 5 friends.  True friends, anyway.  Even if I\n&gt; haven&#39;t seen them.  Hehe.  Anyway, if all you think\n&gt; about in a woman is bed, why don&#39;t you go watch XPW\n&gt; or something.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pooboy, the way you suggested to Airly wasn&#39;t\n&gt; polite, all it displayed was ignorance and\n&gt; self-absorbsion.  So get lost.
