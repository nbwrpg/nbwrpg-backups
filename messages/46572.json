While I still do believe a restart/sequel is in =\r\norder I&lt;BR&gt;think the \n    role-playing problem needs addressing first to st=\r\nop a repeat of&lt;BR&gt;what&#39;s \n    happening to NBW.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Origin=\r\nal Message -----&lt;BR&gt;From: \n    &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To:=\r\n \n    &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Sunday, January 20, 2002 5:57=\r\n \n    AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: All Read: Important&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; My appologies, Nar=\r\nrator, \n    I actually missed your original post.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I find th=\r\nat Neo Beast \n    Wars has been dragged on for too long, and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wo=\r\nrld is becoming \n    clogged with bases among other things. Ideas are&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; becoming exausted, \n    if not completely exausted already. It seems to&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; me that we are \n    almost delaying the end of the rpg. If you&#39;ve c=\r\nreated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one storyline \n    that you like, is it not fair to say that=\r\n you can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; create another \n    better one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The idea o=\r\nf creating a sequel to the rpg is one \n    that I would agree&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with.=\r\n That would require several things to \n    happen:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) Changing the =\r\nname of the RPG.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) Appropriate \n    changes to the website.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; 3) A means to store all of everyone&#39;s \n    previous characters (don&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; know about everyone else, but I don&#39;t \n    want to lose the bio&#39;s of a=\r\nll&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my characters).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4) New story \n    (i have an idea, not n=\r\necessarily for the story, but for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how we could \n    create the stor=\r\ny).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 5) A catalyst to start us all off (the story \n    should provid=\r\ne that).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 6) Implementation of new rules, some of which \n    have be=\r\nen, and are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; being, discussed in the login \n    messageboard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; 7) other stuff that could be written if I wasn&#39;t so \n    tired.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; All in all, since there are more people voting \n    anti-restart tha=\r\nt I&#39;d&lt;BR&gt;&gt; anticpated, I&#39;ll ask everyone a perhaps fate \n    deciding qu=\r\nestion:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Would it be favourable to have a sequel \n    instea=\r\nd of a restart?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., \n    &quot;a=\r\nirly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m agree with \n    So=\r\nulstice, restart isn&#39;t good idea. All have good&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; story-lines \n =\r\n   and good characters. Perhaps the best would be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; eliminate&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n    &gt; less importat characters of our story-line (every rpgers could&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \n    choice&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; at whom wants eliminate) and elimitante fac=\r\ntions where \n    are member&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t posting and join facti=\r\nons that have few \n    characters&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; playing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; That other way \n    than restart.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In \n    nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; =\r\nwrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I \n    at first wasn&#39;t sure if I could vote i=\r\nn this one. Not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    &gt; am I seemingly not too much =\r\nan important part of this RPG, \n    despite&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the general curren=\r\nt lack of members, and the fact that \n    I&#39;ve been&lt;BR&gt;&gt; here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; for getting close to 2 years, but also I \n    am not involved in this&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; restart. I have very few characters. \n    Characters that, if th=\r\ne RPG&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; restarted, will still be \n    together (Insec=\r\nticons, specifically), and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; therefore it wouldn&#39;t \n    harm me =\r\nto vote yes. However, I don&#39;t think&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; could \n    vote =\r\nyes, because I am apposed to restarting the RPG. I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n    d=\r\necided to vote no. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me to end the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n   =\r\n saga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of Neo Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked \n=\r\n    hard over&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; years to keep going. I don&#39;t think t=\r\nhat \n    we could suddenly pretend&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; never happened, =\r\nI think \n    it&#39;s impossible. Maybe if we ended it and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; started=\r\n the sequel, I \n    wouldn&#39;t mind so much, but otherwise, my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vote&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; is no. \n    Thank you for reading this if you even did...&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n    &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your use of Yahoo!
