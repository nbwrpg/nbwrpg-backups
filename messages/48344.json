It&#39;s probably more due to the fact \nthat we changed the number of characters maximum. When you have 5 \nchars max (and not everyone has 5 chars yet) rather than 15 chars, a \nsignificant difference shouldbe, and is, present. =)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; The RPG is dieing because there is nothing new to it.
