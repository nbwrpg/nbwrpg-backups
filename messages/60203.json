He heard a commotion near his \napartment he, Megatronics, and their adoptive sister, Organics \nshared.  Several bots were gathered around the door, watching \nMegatronics stand over Organics.  Not menacing her, protecting her.  \nHis brother was struggling with an appearently drunk, tenticuled, \nrobot of unknown origin.  Neutronics pushed the gatering at the door \naside and rushed the attacker.  He was knocked to the ground, but \nmegatronics was able to knock the attacker away.  The mystery bot \nescaped through the window and into the night.  Megatronics helped \nhis brother to his feet.  They pull Organics up and Neutronics shut \nthe door and rushed to his sister&#39;s side.  As he held her hand to \nreassure, his hand passed through her&#39;s, and the room grew black, \nNeutronics looked around, and instead of his protective older \nbrother, the mighty Megatron stood rusting and laughing.  Neutronics \ncovered his audio\n&gt;  recepters, until Megatron opened fire on them both.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Malice jolted awake, dropping the alarm clock in his hand.  \nInstantly, a monofiliment wire shot from his wrist.  it bounced off \nhis index finger, pierced the clock housing, bounced off the \ninsides, and exited to stick in the wall.  The clock slide down the \nwire, till it rested on the floor.  He retracted the wire and looked \naround.  He saw Wolfblade was awake.  He picked Camoflage up gently, \nrested her in his lap, and swung his legs over the edge of the cargo \nnet to face Wolfblade.\n&gt; :Good afternoon, I think.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; \n&gt; She purred slightly as Malice stroked her head and nuzzled even \n&gt; closer to him.  Her mind was dreaming of past times. In her sleep, \n&gt; she muttered, &quot; No, I don&#39;t want to go mommy. I can fight. I won&#39;t \n&gt; get rust sickness. Honest, I can stay, please let me stay mommy.&quot;  \n&gt; She whimpered a bit and calmed down. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; She moved and rolled onto her back to see what had scratched her. \nIt \n&gt; was Elita. She gently put her arm around the little sleeping bot \nand \n&gt; sighed. SHe very gently stroked Elita&#39;s head and shoulders and \n&gt; wondered how long the little bot had been there.  She thought to \n&gt; herself, Why do kids come around bots who have little to no \n&gt; experience with kids? I wonder if they do it on purpose just to \nraise \n&gt; a bot&#39;s oil pressure.\n&gt; She turned her head to see that Malice had a little one sleeping \nat \n&gt; his side as well.  She wondered why the kids came to his room to \n&gt; sleep. THen something else occured to her. If kids could sneek in \nto \n&gt; this place, how easy would it be for an enemiy to sneek in and \nkill \n&gt; them. Especially when they were sleeping. This thought disturbed \nher \n&gt; enough to not let her fall back to sleep. She would wait for the \nkids \n&gt; to wake up, then address the matter with Malice. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;In the name of God, I banish these souls of the evil undead into \ndamnation.  May God have mercy, for I have none.  In Jesus&#39; Holy \nName, Amen.&quot; -Rawl, Hellsing-RPG\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
