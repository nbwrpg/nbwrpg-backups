His new \nself-appointed command did not please them, but they would have to \ndeal with it.\n\nDaemos: You know that the original harvesting mission still stands. \nUpon my arrival, I have planted energon seeds. The fruits should be \nripe by now. I need someone to go gather them. The urgency of the \nmoment, with the Infecticon demonstration of power, has really shown \nus that we need to gather as much energon as we can in what little \ntime we have.\n\nMelchana: I could take the Hellgate and bring the fruits back. That \nis, IF you do not appose your veto, O, revered Commander.\n\nBelthassan: Shut up, sister. Yes, this was not a group decision, but \nit was what the Matrix decided...\n\nTankor: Matrix, Shmatrix...\n\nBelthassan glared at Tankor, venom in his eyes.\n\nDaemos: Melchana, gather the fruits. Belthassan, you are my second \nofficer. Come with me and I will ezplain why I do all this. Tankor, \ncontact Zardus to know what he wishes to do about the Infecticons.\n\nLittle did he know that Zardus has been missing for some times \nalready.\n\nThus, the Hellgate departed for France.\n\nTankor: This is a message to Zardus. The Tripredacus wish to know what \nyour actions will be towards the Infecticons.\n\n\n"}}
