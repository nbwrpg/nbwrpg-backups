He curses and whishes that he could fly, since they were going to fast to keep up with by land. Drillbit looks around and walks toward the destroyed Trainer base, seeing Halucigen flying out of it and bringing up his gun just in case.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKillfest groans as he gets up, seeing Scyther and Incarcinator standing in front of him.\n\n&quot;Status?&quot; he asks them, stretching his back.\n\n&quot;Demise and EndBringer are in stasis lock,&quot; Scyther replies, &quot;The base is destroyed. Darkfate&#39;s troops are chasing some Trainers. That explosion did quite alot of damage to everything here.&quot;\n\nKillfest nods. &quot;Allright. Get EndBringer and Demise to a CR. I&#39;ll go find DrillBit or Darkfate.&quot;\n\nScyther and Incarcinator fly off to get EndBringer and Demise, Killfest walking off toward DrillBit, his jetpack too damaged to function.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCrater tries to painfully get up, but can&#39;t befcause of a severed spine. He swears under his breath, transforming into beast mode but finding that to be a bad idea. He transforms back to robot mode from a sting ray, beginning to drag himself to higher ground so that someone could see him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNeody rubs his head, getting up. He looks ahead at the Trainer base and sees nothing but smoke. Aiming his shoulder guns at the ground, he deploys two organic pods to scout the area.\n\n\n"}}
