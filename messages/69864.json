I am about to=\r\n open up what could be a larger story ark involving the minions, which of c=\r\nourse means it will imapct many others &gt;:)\n&gt; \n&gt; I will be creating - or per=\r\nhaps INDUCTING would be a better choice of words - others into the minion r=\r\nanks to create some mayhem for all. They will be revealed soon. \n&gt; \n&gt; I wil=\r\nl be happy to take on the temporary roles of whatever is needed to keep the=\r\n lines rolling, although I will probably try to keep that to a minimum as m=\r\nuch as I can, as there are many already out there to be utilized. \n&gt; \n&gt; San=\r\ndy, I have been trying to send you some offline mail to that email address =\r\nyou sent me, but I don&#39;t know if the mail is being sent to spam-land or jus=\r\nt lost. I had some pictures of a possible new form that might interest you,=\r\n and am just looking for your input and thoughts. Also I was wondering at h=\r\now much you know about the BW&#39;s toon, so I know if I have to feed you any b=\r\nackground information from time to time. I just wanted to be sure we are on=\r\n the same sheet before we stepped forward :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Also as for the rest, I k=\r\nnow Airly has some stuff that she is trying to accomplish as well as Sandy =\r\nand Kraftlos, as I have gotten stuff from each at different times. My goal =\r\nis to touch on all of them, and keep it fun as much as I can. I am not GMin=\r\ng, but I am doing as much as I can to keep stuff moving - much like I did b=\r\nefore. \n&gt; \n&gt; The question I have is: What does everyone want to see from th=\r\nis and from me? In other words: What are your thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
