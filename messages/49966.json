We wanted to skip the mundane and get right to the \ngood stuff.  BTW, Kyle, I don&#39;t really mind.  I&#39;m a mod myself in an \nRPG where it&#39;s considered perfectly acceptable to RP someone else&#39;s \ncharacter for an entire conversation.  (Mostly to speed things up and \npoint the story in the right direction so that it stays interesting.)\n\nAs they unload the equipment (mostly an assorted selection of things \nGatara figures they may run low on; the Rogues already have what they \nneed, more or less), Phoenix&#39;s wandering eyes find Flicker.  Now \nshe&#39;s REALLY confused, because she feels like she should remember \nhim, even though she doesn&#39;t.  (For those not well-versed in \npsychology, this is a case of semantic memory - emotional attachments \n- versus the regular, event-based recollections in memory engrams, \nwhich Phoenix has lost.)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Why would we get mad?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Then let&#39;s just say it takes 2 loads so as not to\n&gt; &gt; get the council mad.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:  Flicker gets back, loads up under Gatara&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; supervision (don&#39;t complain, you wanted to speed\n&gt; &gt; things up) and heads back.\n\n\n"}}
