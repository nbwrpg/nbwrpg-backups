The right corner of his mouth rises slightly, \nforming a predatory grin on the commander&#39;s face. &quot;Drillbit, how \neffective are our scanners at the moment?&quot; Not waiting for an \nanswer, &quot;Predacons, we do not know the location of the Maximal base \nat the moment.&quot; he shifts his gaze to Warhead and \nUltraByte, &quot;Warhead, you and UltraByte will both lead scouting teams \nand begin range patrols. You will likely be out of comm range, so \ndon&#39;t bother using them, and don&#39;t engage the enemy when you find \nthem.&quot;\n\n&quot;UltraByte, your team will head west, zig zagging your way until you \neither hit an impass, or you are unable to go any further west. At \nthat time, cirle north. Make sure to record the distance travelled, \nand to note any areas that may contain energon deposites. You team \nwill consist of the following bots: Apocalypse, Coldfire, \nQuickstrike, and Snowblazer. Arm yourselves, and depart \nimmediately.&quot; Megatron&#39;s head focuses on Warhead.\n\n&quot;Warhead, your team will head east, following the same pattern as \nUltraByte&#39;s group. You will head North if you reach an impass, and \nfollow the impass until. make sure to record the distance travelled, \nand to note any areas that may contain energon deposites. You team \nwill consist of the following bots: Inferno, Rage, Drillbit, and \nNightshade. You will also depart immediately, so arm yourselves.&quot;\n\n&quot;Those who are left will defend the base.&quot; He stands, and looks at \nthe remaing bots. &quot;Perceptor, take over on the console, start trying \nto make repairs. Waspinator, you&#39;re on scout duty. Triptych, get to \nthe engine room, and see if anything is salvageable.&quot; He glances \naround, &quot;Is Nemesis Enforcer back yet?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
