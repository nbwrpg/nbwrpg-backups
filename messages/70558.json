You have within you the power to relight the flame, and all you =\r\nneed do, is look deeper into your heart. There you will find it, a power th=\r\nat is perpetual, a power that is unmatched by anything ever devised in the =\r\nuniverse, and a one true power that as Autobots, we share among each other.=\r\n Be not afraid to delve into this power, as I too am not afraid to do the s=\r\name. My heart is here for you, all you need to is reach for it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Inside=\r\n Tucson&#39;s cab, a screen shows the image of a beating heart. As it beats fur=\r\nther, the inside of the cab glows a brilliant silvery blue light. A light t=\r\nhat eminates from his heart, and a light that can not be doused by the forc=\r\nes of evil.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFrom beyond the insect creatures there is nothing but c=\r\nold light\neminating from the room behind them. They look like some mishappe=\r\nn\nshadow stretching out like spindly legs as they scramble down the hall\nto=\r\nwards Tuscon. The sound of their claws hitting the strange metaerial\nof the=\r\n ground sounding like stone on stone, the sound high pitched and\ngrating.\n\n=\r\nEven as they approach the inccessant humming that had been heard has\ngotten=\r\n louder as several blue and white winged insects approach from\nbehind Tusco=\r\nn and they also make their way up the long hall seeking to\nbox him in. The =\r\nwaiting hungry claws of the red-white and yellow\nspider like insects to the=\r\n front and the blue and white ones flying up\nat the rear, thier stingers re=\r\nady to poison and rend, Tuscon in the\nmiddle, fodder for thier taking!\n\nHow=\r\never at the last moment a searing flame errupted seemingly everywhere!\n\nOne=\r\n moment it was dark, only the light from the door way showing in\nthe hall. =\r\nThe next flames burst from no where, catching the insects,\nmelting thier ar=\r\nmor, searing internals. When the flames dissipate\nthere was nothing but cha=\r\nrred remains.\n\n&quot;Tuscon . . . &quot; a voice whispered &quot;hurry . . . &quot; It was Vest=\r\nige\ntalking from inside Tuscon&#39;s cab, but he sounded like Rodimus his\nvoice=\r\n weak and small. &quot;I can&#39;t hold this for too much longer . . . &quot;\nHe fell ove=\r\nr again seemingly offline.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
