He \nstops just after he avoided the shots, but his arm hurt and he tries \nto stand up. Also, with the venom in him, he starts to see in a \nblurred way.\n\nRagnar: Kup, Rodimus, Windlord, anyone... I am going down. I need \nbackup now!\n\nBlackfang held his hand at Katya. She understood the motion and stood \nthere, with her aim steady.\n\nBlackfang: How about you join us? We are brothers in arms after all...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ragnar neglected to take into account the weapon&#39;s rapid motion - \nthe \n&gt; slug misses the lashknife and goes straight to Fury, rocking the \n&gt; smaller warrior.  Riekan kicks at Ragnar, hoping to drive him back a \n&gt; bit, and fires again.\n&gt; \n&gt; The shots pepper Pumpskin&#39;s hide, but fail to penetrate.  &#39;Relative&#39; \n&gt; leaves a lot open, and the warrior&#39;s weak points are still tough.  \n&gt; When he hears what Blackfang has to say, he stops and thinks about \n&gt; it.  &quot;You know, that&#39;s a very good point.

A searing burn ran \n&gt; &gt; across his arm, but he managed to twist enough to fire his Gauss \nat \n&gt; &gt; Fury. The slug went straight at the knife, which would break \n&gt; &gt; inevitably, and past it at Fury.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The blond Clansman looked at his limb and saw it in a bloddy \n&gt; metallic \n&gt; &gt; mess. Adrenaline was still high, but he would not last.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katya saw a breach and fired between the tentacles.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang leaped back and out of most of the tentacles way. \n&gt; However, \n&gt; &gt; his shotgun was taken out of his grip. He drew his pulse laser and \n&gt; &gt; fired small quick shots as near as he could to the gash.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang: Why the hell are you doing this then?
