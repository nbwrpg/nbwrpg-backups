She stayed a short distance, but not close enough to \nresort to a battle if they were too edgy for a friendly greeting. She \nwatched the ship. \n\n\n\nQuickstrike, while on the roof of the Predacon ship, out for fresh \nair and a watchout, noticed a figure at the corner of his keen \noptics. He jerked his head around to it and watched. His mind \nimmediately snapped: Dinobot! \n\nHe went on defense. A Maximal was in the ship&#39;s range. But his \nscanners weren&#39;t picking up a Maximal signature, but a Predacon. He \nglanced harder at the figure. \n\nIt was certainly Dinobot&#39;s structure. Another thing that didn&#39;t make \nsense was that form of Dinobot was gone. The original Dinobot was \ngone. Maybe it was another clone. \n\nQuickstrike clambered over to the open roof hatch from the ship and \nlooked down into the beginning corridor. \n\n&quot;Hey!&quot; he called. No one was near him inside the ship. So, he opened \nhis comm-link. &quot;Somebody get down here!&quot; he said with alarm. &quot;We got \nuh Maxi outside here. Looks like Dinobot.&quot; He jumped down from the \nroof hatch into the corridor with a loud bang.\n\n\n"}}
