He had been given luxiourious space, and \nsome great technoloy to work with. Soon he can start working on an \nidea to get the three of them home. He had returned the Scorponok&#39;s \nbox to Hell Beast. He was glad too, cause that thing was starting to \nhum, like it was gonna explode or something. Just than his vent shaft \nopened and out crawled a large termite.\n\n&quot;Intruder! Kill it!&quot; Vulois TF&#39;d to Robot Mode.\n\n&quot;No, please don&#39;t shoot. My name is Terminess. I lead a young band of \nPredacons on Cybertron. I have great mental skills, which some people \ncall psycic powers. Without me, my bad will surly fall apart and die. \nI was accidentaly detected and sentenced to spend the rest of my life \nasleep in a stasis pod. I used my abilities to change the course and \nbring me here. I just want to go home. I am great at things like \nthis; I could help build the ship. I have a bod just a few parsec&#39;s \nfrom here which we could use. All I ask is that I come with you.\n\n&quot;Very well. I&#39;ll talk to Hell Beast about setting you up a small lab. \nI&#39;ll get you some quarters. You can bunk here for the night.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you so much! You will not regret this.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
