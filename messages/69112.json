Suddenly brilliant light erupted into the room from the one calling himself Malik, revealing a tall broadly built powerfully armored warrior. Large bat wings extend from his back, crimson at the tips and black as the draw into the shoulders. Silver armor covers his chest and head plating, while black armor cover strategic parts, especially his shins, hips, shoulders and forearms. In his hand a twin blade glows, the author of the light in this place. \n\nHe looked down at Darkfate, &quot;Your master named me Malik, and rightly so, for it means &#39;KING&#39;, but you will call me &#39;MAURADER&#39; because I will rape and pillage this ball of dust until nothing stands!&quot;\n\nTAG: Darkfate\n\nPreston\n\nOOC: Sorry it took me so long to post this last one, but I could not get a pic to post at the wiki site.
