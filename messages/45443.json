Knowing something \nwas wrong, he ran to the Renewal Chamber. When he arrived, he saw the \nlarge form of the robot, though he did not recognize him. However, he \nhad his idea on the matter.\n\nBelthassan: Firedrill? Is that you?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ooC: lol, i shoulda kept RPing Pacifix when I first got back... oh \n&gt; well. Lets just say that Gesper has been shown around the base. \n&gt; (unless you&#39;ve got other plans)\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Pacifix / Anachronox --\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix frowns at the news of technical difficulties, &quot;Unfortunate.. \n&gt; I was hoping to speak with my bot. When he becomes available, have \n&gt; him contact me immediately.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hoist,&quot; says Pacifix.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hoist appears at the call, &quot;What&#39;s happening Pacifix?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix nods, &quot;Gimme a sec, I might need you to go get Gesper.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hoist nods silently.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix returns to his conversation with Daemos, &quot;He is well, and is \n&gt; currently being shown where his quarters are by Crossroads. Would \n&gt; you like to speak with him?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; The sounds and bumping can be heard resonating from the renewal \n&gt; chamber. A scream ensues, but quickly stops, coincidentally at the \n&gt; same time as the thumping. High temperatures seem to have sealed the \n&gt; chamber from the inside, and only a dark form can be seen from the \n&gt; clouded convering. (unless there is no clear covering)\n&gt; \n&gt; Anachronox appears to be sleeping.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; In the Shadow Destiny, Daemos received the message from Pacifix.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: What? Why have I not been warned of Firedrill&#39;s arrival.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the same time, on one of the consoles, a warning signal lit up. \n&gt; It \n&gt; &gt; showed disturbances in the Renewal Chambers. Daemos opened a base-\n&gt; wide \n&gt; &gt; frequency.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHERE FIREDRILL IS?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tankor: I have just took him to the Renewal Chamber. Is anything \n&gt; &gt; wrong, Commander?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: Wrong? THERE IS A DANGER SIGNAL IN THE RENEWAL CHAMBER!! \n&gt; &gt; BELTHASSAN, CHECK IT OUT!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Belthassan started to go to the Chamber, thinking he, at least, \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; done something to weaken Daemos&#39; leadership.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: Pacifix, my esteemed brethren. I have not been warned \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; Firedrill&#39;s arrival. We are experiencing technical difficulties in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; base, and I am afraid I may have to postpone this chat. How is \n&gt; Gesper \n&gt; &gt; doing on your side, by the way?\n\n\n"}}
