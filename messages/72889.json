Apparently there is a =\r\nrash of accounts being broken into on yahoo.   Before it happens to you, th=\r\nere is something you can do to prevent intrusion.   And here it is:\n\n1:  Si=\r\ngn into your account info.\n\n2: Scroll down to SECOND SIGN IN VERIFICATION.\n=\r\n\n3: Click on that, it will send you a verification number and give you the =\r\noption \nOf sending that number to another email, other than yahoo, or throu=\r\ngh your mobile phone, which is ten times safer by the way.\n\n4:  If you have=\r\n a mobile number, click on the option to just send it through there rather =\r\nthan the email.\n\n5:  The verification code will need to be verified on the =\r\ncomputer.  Type the number exactly how it was sent to you and then you&#39;re d=\r\none.\n\nWhat this will do is make it impossible for hackers to access your ac=\r\ncount.  If they try an unauthorized login they will fail miserably.  There&#39;=\r\ns more info related to this in your account profile section.  It&#39;s really w=\r\north the time investment.\n\n\n"}}
