Well, part of that is starting to surface.\n&gt; &gt; He&#39;s lost his temper an=\r\nd Straight Shot picked up on it. But to cover\n&gt; &gt; himself, he told her it w=\r\nas a pure bluff. So it looks like he&#39;s bluffing to\n&gt; &gt; try to fool the enem=\r\ny, or is it really a bluff? Did he mean everything he\n&gt; &gt; said, and did he =\r\nalso intend to ram his foot into Megatron&#39;s fallen body?\n&gt; &gt; This is a grea=\r\nt chance for Rodimus to over come his self doubt as his own\n&gt; &gt; comrade&#39;s e=\r\nmotional stability seems to be wearing thin. And now, he\n&gt; &gt; threatens to p=\r\nut an arrow straight through the chest of the fallen\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon leader,=\r\n if the enemy does not stand down. You could call this a\n&gt; &gt; fit of bottled=\r\n up rage that he&#39;s had for a long time, since his own\n&gt; &gt; unfortunate incid=\r\nent when he was shot down and taken off line, only to fail\n&gt; &gt; in his missi=\r\non to protect his comrades. He doesn&#39;t take failure very well\n&gt; &gt; since tha=\r\nt, and he&#39;ll do everything in his power to make sure it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; happen =\r\nagain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot doesn&#39;t know the full scope of Tucson&#39;s issues=\r\n, it may be up\n&gt; &gt; to Rodimus to fill in the gaps for her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As far a=\r\ns what happened, it was the day that Rodimus had been taken by\n&gt; &gt; Hydras, =\r\nas Tucson desperately tried to fend off the enemy, by providing a\n&gt; &gt; decoy=\r\n to get the enemy to focus on him rather than Rodimus. He was taken\n&gt; &gt; off=\r\n line by Cyclonus long before he could actually accomplish what he was\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntrying to do, and the only one who saw that shot, was Straight Shot, who\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; just shortly after that, was taken off line herself. Tucson was in vehicl=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; mode when it happened, and can not remember anything of that battle d=\r\nue to\n&gt; &gt; the cranial shot he endured. This is what makes him so angry. The=\r\n fact\n&gt; &gt; that he feels that he failed Rodimus and the others the first tim=\r\ne, and now\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;s in danger of failing them again. You could say that eve=\r\nn though he may\n&gt; &gt; think he doesn&#39;t need help, he could really use Rodimus=\r\n&#39;s support right\n&gt; &gt; about now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Supe=\r\nr Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I hope to be posting to=\r\nmmorrow or so, so many things to catch up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in so many places. But I ha=\r\nd a question :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How is Talon inside Tuscon? When Tuscon transfo=\r\nrms back into robot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mode he is roughly human hieght or slightly large=\r\nr, the same height as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nearly all the Maximals and Predacons are more =\r\nor less. Talon would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approximately the same size as Tuscon in this=\r\n form - perhaps a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inches shorter or so - seeing as Tuscon is a Pr=\r\nime an all that. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; having said that, having Tuscon holding holding =\r\nTalon inside, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be a bit . . . um . . . messy?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\nnd I want to apologize about Tuscon&#39;s arrow. It was not that it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i=\r\nneffective, but it was just that Nightrazor was not visable any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; longe=\r\nr. When I am crafting a post, I try to take into account just how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; muc=\r\nh conversation or other actions have gone on between each move. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tu=\r\nscon was tapping out his communication to Rodimus and Straight Shot,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthen that gave Nightrazor time to hide or make other choices. I was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; g=\r\niving you a hint to that when I had Rodimus speak in short sentences\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nand remind Tuscon that the intruder would not wait for lengthy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; commun=\r\nications.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not trying to be mean. As a suggestion, imagine =\r\nyourself saying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the things Tuscon is saying in the middle of a battle=\r\n or an intense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scene and you will see what I mean. Imagine how many t=\r\nhings you could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have done in the time that it would have taken for Tu=\r\nscon to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; communicate the information he did in morris code to straight=\r\nshot and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, not trying to be mean, just accu=\r\nrate and realistic as I can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a made up world where robots can tr=\r\nansform and we break laws of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; physics with every stroke of the pen :)\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Mon, Apr 11, 2011 at 10:54 AM, Sandy &lt;ma=\r\ngicquartz@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Replying to Airly&#39;s=\r\n post first, going in that sequence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nnside the Ark, Tucson puts his hand over his chest, and gently does as\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Talon had asked.

The dino\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; roars slightly but is quickly relieved of his pain. He&#39;s soon joine=\r\nd by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his mate, and it&#39;s clear to see, that this was a family of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Stegasaurouses. He looks down to Night Shift, and nudges his hand with=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his nose gently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s okay big guy, no sweat, you=\r\n go back with your family.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The stegasaurouses now retreat =\r\nback into the forest, yet the little one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks back once more thank=\r\nfully and then retreats.

The=\r\n computer&#39;s voice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be heard echoing off several panels as it=\r\n worked through an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; internal diagnostics check, &quot;Predacon signatur=\r\nes detected.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the room with Perceptor the computer b=\r\negan quickly pin pointing the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; various signatures both inside and =\r\nwithin a mile of the Ark outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BACK OUTSIDE THE ARK:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the same time Torca, Noctorro, AirHammer, Quicksilv=\r\ner and Bantor,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Maximal Fuzors took this moment of distraction=\r\n to rush the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons cannons blazing!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sever=\r\nal sweeps fell from the skies and Scourge as well took another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hi=\r\nt, this one sending a sizzling burn up the side of his flank.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Cyclonus was also hit, although he was able to twist in the air,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; turning what would have normally been a devastating blow into one th=\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glanced off his armor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deepstryke was hit =\r\nseveral times, forcing him to back off, his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boosters flaring as h=\r\ne began to retreat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inferno also was damaged as he took=\r\n a hit that was designed for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras, the hit sent Inferno spirali=\r\nng towards the ground as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As powerful as the Preda=\r\ncons were, they did not have all their forces\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there, and the Maxi=\r\nmals were finally getting their own forces\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together. The only thi=\r\nng that was holding the Predacons together was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the sheer power th=\r\nat Cyclonus and Hydras and to a lesser extent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scourge and Deepsty=\r\nke were bringing to bear on the Maximals!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That might ch=\r\nange with the Ark beginning to power up!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
