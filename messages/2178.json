Lauguidhing, since he had a big huge hole in \nhis middle (which, will undoubtedly kill him), the lasers merely hitting the \nwall behind him (though pieces of the wall piercing into his back, Stinkbomb \nwas way gone so he couldn&#39;t even feel it).  Not even wondering how Suukie \nmystically got repaired, he shoved his heavy laser rifle up to diagonally at \nthe bottom of Suukie&#39;s chin (though a few millimeters away), pulling the \ntrigger repeatedly, slashing his seringed and very deadly tail up at the \nmiddle of Suukie&#39;s chest.\n\n-----------\n\n    Ramhorn, stepped into the armory of the Ark, not seeing anyone on the \nway.  -Dang, it&#39;s a ghost ship- the temporarily insane robot thinking, coming \nback into reality, no longer crazy.  &quot;Stinkbomb, by Primus, what have I \ndone!&quot; he yelled, grabbing a missile launcher and running as fast as his \ndamaged legs could carry him, each &#39;step&#39; banging against the &#39;ancient&#39; metal \nflooor, stopping at the door of the Ark gradually, the door slid up \nautomatically, the Maximal running in, seeing the fight between Suukie.  \nYelling, &quot;Stinkbomb, hold on, I&#39;ll kill the traitor!&quot;, he raised the missile \nlauncher, stopping 6 feet behind Suukie, firing off a rocket at the middile \nof his back, swearing in ancient Cybertronian (a way Ramhorn likes to show \noff to everyone).\n\n"}}
