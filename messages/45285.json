He walks straight to the control room.  Before the door can \n&gt; slide open he brings his arm up, a panel slides open as a gun flps \n&gt; out into his hand.  &quot;Why hello there&quot; he points it at the door.  \n&gt; Pulling the trigger the small pistol blasts the door to nothing \nleaving \n&gt; destruction for his door.  HE slowly paces in.  &quot;Soundwave andm \n&gt; inions.  Megatron has a little change of, well body, but heart as \n&gt; well.
