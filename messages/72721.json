It wa=\r\ns no longer under Maximal control.  It would be a situation that Tucson cou=\r\nld never handle on his own no matter how strong he is now and how determine=\r\nd he is to set things right.  But being clever was something Nightshift was=\r\n famous for.  He radios back to Polarclaw via text message.\n\n&quot; Guess what, =\r\nI know why this tower dissed us.  It&#39;s been infested with those giant ugly =\r\naft bugs that we ran into at the jungle location.  Brute force might not wo=\r\nrk but germ warfare will.  See if you guys can drum up someth&#39;n about insec=\r\ntile viruses, and see where we might find out how ta spread one and where t=\r\na find the virus spores.  Viruses can spread faster than we can storm a com=\r\nplex, and wipe out an entire colony once an outbreak is established.&quot;\n\nHe t=\r\nhen turns to the honey comb like structure.\n\n&quot; I hate bugs.  And after this=\r\n, the only bugs I wanna see are the ones I can squash under my paws!&quot;\n\n--- =\r\nIn nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightshift narrows his eyes and gives a feline hiss of dislik=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I knew we should&#39;ve called an exterminator, when these bugs fi=\r\nrst showed\n&gt; &gt; up!
