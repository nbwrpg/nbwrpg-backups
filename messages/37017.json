His eyes narrowed, as he put his fingers together. \nThey\n&gt; erupted a low powered laser, which he then used to open up the\nchest \nof\n&gt; Redhot, and now scanned inside, for anything out of place.\n\n\n\n    ::REDHOT::\n\n    Redhot&#39;s eye&#39;s opened a crack when the stranger began on his \nchest. The lazer was painful at first. It caused him to yelp loudly \nuntil his pain receptors drowned out the burning. Once it faded he \nrelaxed. He groaned and quietly tolerated the Autobot&#39;s prodding.\n    (OOC: Internally, Redhot is truely ALIEN. At least at first. \nFurther inspection would find simularities. Mechanisms would be \ndifferent shapes, in the wrong location, or BeachComber wouldn&#39;t \nrecognize them at all.  However, many of Redhot&#39;s mechanisms would be \n&#39;recognizable&#39;.)\n\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n***********************************\n\n\n"}}
