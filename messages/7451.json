Neither of them seemed \neager to find out.\n\n&quot;Its very simple, really,&quot; he says anyways, &quot;This little bug attatches to \nyour neck, sliding its mouthpiece through your skin. It taps into your \nnervious system, taking over your pain sensory circuits. Then it proceeds to \nmanipulate those circuits, activating them on full power. You&#39;ll feel pain \nlike you never felt before. Worse than me slamming this metal rod through \nyour stomach,&quot; Nemesis points to a cruel-looking metal rod in the corner. He \nlooks down at the bugs.\n\n&quot;Oh yes, and they disable your safeguard of falling unconscious. Or delay it \nseverely. Only one bug is needed for the procedure, and since there are \ntwo....&quot; he looks at Iron Raptor, evil in his eyes, &quot;You&#39;ll get to enjoy this \nexperience too.&quot;\n\nDark One shakes his head, &quot;I think its better if we let her watch. She seemed \nunwilling to do so before.&quot;\n\nNemesis Enforcer looks at Dark One, &quot;Believe me, she&#39;d rather watch than go \nthrough this.&quot;\n\nHe tosses one of the bugs to Dark One. &quot;Get it prepared. It needs to be \ncharged.&quot;\n\nDark One nods, walking over to a console.\n\n"}}
