The Predacons had started to \nretreat. Things wern&#39;t ok yet though, Tyrael&#39;s ship was destroyed. \nWhat was left was laying outfront the Maximal base. Luckily the Maxi \nbase was fine. The shields had been damaged but were not taken down. \nThere was also the matter of this strange bot that was telling \neveryone to leave the planet. Rodimus decided to handle this. Rodimus \nfirst finds Nightlight and puts his arm around her. She was ok. \nRodimus Prime: Maximals help find any injured Maximals or other \nallies. Get everyone to CR&#39;s. Pay special attention to the Tripred \nship. We could have lost guys in the crash. Rodimus now turns to the \ndemanding newcomer.
