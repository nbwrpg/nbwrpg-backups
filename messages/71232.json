The =\r\nolder stego turns and waits for them to follow him.\n\n&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, thes=\r\ne dinos are on our side.  This old guy&#39;s got his entire herd lookn&#39; after N=\r\night Shift.&quot;\n\nBack where he had been left, Night Shift tries to sit up agai=\r\nnst a boulder, and finds his legs completely useless.  This meant he could =\r\nneither walk, or transform.  The stegos look to him curiously.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ll be o=\r\nkay, no worries.  Slag, sure hate ben&#39; in this situation though.  Night Shi=\r\nft ta Ramulus, Rat Trap&#39;s probably found ya by now, he&#39;ll take ya ta where =\r\nI am, over.&quot;  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonu=\r\ns@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One stego looks down to Night Shift makin=\r\ng sure he&#39;s unharmed. He smiles and rubs her nose.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m okay. My fr=\r\niends are commn&#39; back ta help me out.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, another stego sco=\r\nuts the area where Night Shift and Rat Trap had just fled. He had been with=\r\n the family originally, and appears to be one of the oldest members of the =\r\nherd. He picks up a familliar scent, yet not Night Shift, but the scent of =\r\nanother comrade, and follows it. It leads him close to Ramulus. He spots th=\r\ne Maximal, and waits for his approach, quietly gurgling his growl, and lowe=\r\nring his head as if to try and get him to follow him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; When =\r\nthe Stegosauras spotted Ramulus, the Maximal was at the scene of\n&gt; the batt=\r\nle. He was in robot mode skulking around the area, the smell\n&gt; of gunpowder=\r\n and burnt metal and smoke still hung in the air like a\n&gt; cloud. But for hi=\r\nm it would seem that battle is over. There are no\n&gt; combatants, no explosio=\r\nns, and no bright flashes of light in the\n&gt; distance. All is quiet, except =\r\nfor a strange gurgling growling sound.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus looked over at the rath=\r\ner strange acting Stegosauras. he gave\n&gt; it a quizzical look and tried to s=\r\nhoo it away. &quot;Hey big fella, you\n&gt; don&#39;t need to be around here. It might n=\r\not be safe.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile he turned his radio on. &quot;Rat Trap, Nightshift. =\r\nI am here at\n&gt; the site wher you called us from, but I don&#39;t see you.&quot; Ther=\r\ne was a\n&gt; cautious and confused timber to his voice. &quot;I can see the battle =\r\nyou\n&gt; were talking about, but there is no one left. It looks like half the\n=\r\n&gt; forest was set ablaze though.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
