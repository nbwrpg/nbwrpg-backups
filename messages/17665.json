Try to take the leader!&quot; he yells into his comm as a green beam \nemerges from the weapon, along with a chip, both heading for Spears at a high \nspeed.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHearing the command, Firearm instantly dives toward Prebon, his arm cannon \nset on charge launcher and firing at Prebon, his optics firing as well.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen jumps up from his crawling position as he hears Ramulus&#39; orders, \npulling out his heavy-fire rifle and firing three shots at Prebon&#39;s chest.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProto, being a bit further away and not in range of fire, flies forward, \ngetting closer to Prebon&#39;s location.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSlayer growls as he hears weaponfire, activating his comm-link again.\n\n&quot;Has she stabbed him,&quot; he asks into his comm, speaking quickly, &quot;Should I \nattack, Master?&quot;\n\n"}}
