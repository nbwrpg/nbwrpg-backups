Shokaract, irratated, \nfollows. The\n&gt; Mini-Mafia, the team who formed the gestalt Mobster, followed behind\n&gt; Shokaract. Doom Ice finishes screwing Rizopas&#39; head on, but it \nfalls of\n&gt; again. So she picks it up and drags him behind her to the Iron \nFist. Serge,\n&gt; depressed with his role in the Alliance, stands there, looking on \nas Deemos\n&gt; leaves. Diskus flies up to Deemos.\n&gt; \n&gt; Diskus: Diskus will help Deemos some way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deemos: No you won&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; Diskus: Huh?\n&gt; \n&gt; Deemos: You may be my oldest cohort but I must admit, you helped a \nlittle,\n&gt; but that&#39;s when I figured out that you and Artist were obsolete. \nArtist is\n&gt; dead now, but I give you a chance to live. Leave, and don&#39;t come \nback. You\n&gt; don&#39;t own anything you&#39;d leave behind anyway, so just go.\n&gt; \n&gt; Diskus quickly flies away, transforming to beast mode in flight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deemos: Chances are, that the team he joins will get screwed up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Diskus flew away quickly, sad that Deemos didn&#39;t want him anymore. \nHe flew\n&gt; around looking someplace else for companionship...\n\n\n"}}
