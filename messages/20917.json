He \nlooks down on it, frowning as he listens to the thing twice.\n\n&quot;Looks like there&#39;s a slight change of plans,&quot; he says to the bots \ngathered around him, &quot;Oblitercons, can you go to this new bot&#39;s \nbattle ship and see what you can do to help him? Deamon Wulf, Flesh \nRipper, Dark Claw, SixShot, Ares, BumbleBee, Manterror, Double Punch, \nInjector, and the Dark Lavacons will attack the platform. Keep your \ndistance, the scans did not confirm what weapons they had. They could \nhave powerful defences. Use your long range weapons.&quot;\n\nHe looks over at Nemesis, &quot;Nemesis, Unitron, myself, and the rest of \nus will stay here and work on the defences.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement watched the darkness suddenly disperse as light flooded \ninto the CR \n&gt; chamber.  The nine foot tall Vehement stepped out of the CR \nchamber, heading \n&gt; for the bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement arrived on the bridge, looking to his two soldiers.\n&gt; &quot;What have you found so far?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well, Archbishop, there are several bases.  There is an area where \ntwo bases \n&gt; are together.  I believe that&#39;s where the strongest faction \nresides.  It&#39;s on \n&gt; an island also, and I&#39;m detecting over twenty-five different energy \n&gt; sigantures.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmmm...that&#39;s many for Earth.  I&#39;m surprised.&quot; Vehement \nreplied.  &quot;Go on.  \n&gt; Is anyone near us?  Where are we?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We are in what will be known as Ulaanbaator, Mongolia in the Gobi \nDesert in \n&gt; the continent of Asia.  There is no one that close to us.  We are \nsurrounded \n&gt; by complete desert.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement looked to Reflector and Sun Crusher.  &quot;Open up a comm. \ntransmission \n&gt; to ALL frequencies.  I will speak.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, Archbishop.&quot; Reflector replied, going to his terminal and \npressing in a \n&gt; few commands.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Attention, all residents of Past Earth.  I am Vehement.  My \nbattlecruiser \n&gt; has crashed on this planet as I&#39;m sure you know by now.  My base is \nbadly \n&gt; damaged and is in need of serious repair.  Any assistance would be \nthankful.&quot; \n&gt; he signaled Reflector to end the transmission.  &quot;Play that \ncontinously for \n&gt; five mega-cycles.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Sun Crusher said, walking over to Reflector&#39;s terminal \nand \n&gt; pressing a few commands.  &quot;Done.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good.  What is the status of the base?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Surprisingly,&quot; Sun Crusher said with a smile, &quot;all weapons are \nintact, all \n&gt; CR pools and chambers are fully functional, and our shields and \nother primary \n&gt; systems are intact.  Energy reserves are down to 74% though, and \nthere are \n&gt; several breaches in the hull.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;How long would it take to repair the hull?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A mega-cycle.  They aren&#39;t bad.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do we have any solar panels?&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good.  Set those up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It&#39;ll take two mega-cycles.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll keep defenses active while you do that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Understood.&quot; Sun Crusher acknowledge, him and Reflector walking \nout of the \n&gt; bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement sat in his command chair, smiling as the transmission \ncontinuously \n&gt; played to all bases and everyone on Earth.\n\n\n"}}
