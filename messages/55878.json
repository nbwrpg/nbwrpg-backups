She wondered why this bot whom did show \npromise was given so much favor, while showing little in the ways of \nleadership. She kept running and running, dodging trees and jumping \nover logs.  She stopped at a stream and layed down. Her stomach was \ncreating great pain for her.  She was about to turn and go back, when \nshe caught a strange scent on the wind.  She got up and started \nwalking to the scent.\n\n\n"}}
