She noticed that she was \nbeing scanned.  By who or what she didn&#39;t know.  She suddenly got that \nnervous feeling in her stomach.  She held her gun close to her and walked \nout of the bridge.  She went down the hallway and looked out through the \nhole in the side of the ship. She could see forest surrounding ship through \nthe hole.\n&quot;Oh boy.&quot;she whipsered. A wave of fear came over her. She knew that someone \nhad to have survived the holocost that happened here.  She just hoped that \nwho ever survived was Maximal and still could be found.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
