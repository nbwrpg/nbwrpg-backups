But I still want\n&gt; to destroy that Predicon now.\n&gt;\n&gt; He continued waiting for an answer.\n&gt;\n\n{Talos}\n\n    When Sunhawk had barged in Talos had looked up from what he was\nstudying, in his hand was a small buckler sized chunk of metal, one side was\ndetailed in pink and white with several faded splotches of red. Setting the\nobject aside and turning to regard Sunhawk he sighed.\n\n    &quot;We will not be executing anyone Sunhawk. Not these predicons or any\nother. Our mission is to capture...not serve as judge jury and executioner.\nThat&#39;s not our way, at least not mine. Escort Arc..I mean, Nightshade here\nto some quarters...and I do mean quarters not the brig Sunhawk, when Hot Rod\nreturns from gathering the stasis pods he&#39;ll be assigned the duty of keeping\nan eye on her.&quot;\n\n    Turning to pick up the peice of metal he looked down upon the insignia\nupon it, even the wear of time could not remove it completely and he had\nverified it&#39;s authenticity. Nightshade for all practical terms was what she\nhad claimed to be. Maybe it was a mistake assigning Hot Rod to watch her,\nbut he&#39;d be able to tell if Nightshade was really the autobot Arcee or\nnot...\n\n    &quot;Dismissed&quot; He said simply, flipping the peice of metal back to it&#39;s\nowner.\n\n    Nightshade smiled and caught the metal lifting her chest plate slightly\nand slipping it back into a compartment within as she stood and turned to\nSunhawk, &quot;We meet again and without you trying to kill me no less...&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
