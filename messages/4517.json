He was \nglad that Wrath hadn&#39;t brought back his Maximal comrades to get revenge on \nan unfair fight.\n\nHe turned, with Stingtra still in his arms, checking just in case. All was \nquiet and black. The stars shined just perfectly with the moon.\n\nHe walked to the CR chamber, then paused. He tried to open it with Stingtra \nstill in his arms, but he couldn&#39;t manage, not both with his bizare arms and \nhands. He gently put her down, resting her at the side of the chamber, then \npressed a botton that openeded it. He stepped back to the side and picked \nStingtra up, placing her in the chamber. He closed it.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
