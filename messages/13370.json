Her slender figure, \nstanding tall and unmoving. She looked at him with her peircing gold \neyes.&quot;I&#39;m GoldenEye.  Pleased to met you. And I wouldn&#39;t worry about \nyour symbol.  It will get blown of in time.  It&#39;s the symbol the \nMaximals aim for.  Knowing that it will hurt the most if it is \nmarred.&quot;  She took her hand and wiped her symbol a little. She looked \nat him and smiled.  He was good looking, darn right handsome. She \ncouldn&#39;t hep but smile at him. &quot;So, what brings you to our little \nrock?&quot; she said with a smile.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;            The stasis pod DNA scanners scanned the area for a \nsuitable\n&gt; lifeform to give Dollen a beast mode.  After a suitable lifeform \nwas found,\n&gt; the bot inside, named Dollen, heard banging on the stasis pod, and \nsomeone\n&gt; talking to him.  The stasis pod opened up, and Dollen stepped out.\n&gt; \n&gt;             Dollen looked at GoldenEye.  He suddenly thought about \ndreams\n&gt; and visions he had been having about a female bot.  The female bot \nhe kept\n&gt; having visions about was beautiful.  But, he did not know her name, \nor\n&gt; anything.  He looked at GoldenEye again.  No.  This bot wasn&#39;t the \none.  He\n&gt; looked at her symbol.  Then he looked at his.  She wasn&#39;t an \nenemy.  She was\n&gt; on his side, or so it appeared.  He had to make sure.  He looked at \nhis\n&gt; signature detector.  Yes, she was a Predacon, on his side.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   &quot;Ah, nice to meet you.  My name is Dollen.  I see \nyour a\n&gt; Predacon, like me,&quot; Dollen stopped, and grabbed a little thing from \nhis arm\n&gt; storage compartment.  Inside it was creamy stuff, and then Dollen \nput some\n&gt; on his finger, and rubbed it on his Pred symbol, which was located \non his\n&gt; chest.  He grabbed a cloth out of his arm as well, which was odd, \nas you\n&gt; don&#39;t see too many bots with a cloth.  He rubbed his symbol with \nthe cloth,\n&gt; and then his symbol was shiny and clean.  He put the stuff back in \nhis\n&gt; compartment.\n&gt; \n&gt;            &quot;Sorry about that little pause, I had to polish my \nsymbol, to\n&gt; show that I respect my title as a Predacon.  Anyway, what is your \nname?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
