Sinesis and Sinister stepped outside and walked around a bit. Then they\nwondered away from the base and into the forest. Sinister laughed while\nSinesis kept telling him to be quiet. Sinesis spun around to silence\nSinister when a huge hand wrapped around his throat and threw him into a\ntree. Stronghold stepped out.\n\n&quot;Your shouting and lauhging made me spill my beer.&quot; Stronghold said calmly.\nScamrock came out around the other way and kicked Sinister down. Arrow\nstarted to kick Sinesis and Sinister while they were down. Sinesis shot his\npin dart into Arrow, but the toxins had no affect. Sinister drew out\nhisweapon and threw it, it bounced off a tree and went spiraling through the\nair until it reached Stronghold, who was too busy &quot;SHOVING&quot; Arrow out of the\nbattle that he didn&#39;t notice. Scamrock leapt through the air and kicked the\nweapon down, the weapon slashing into his leg. Scamrock roared several times\nbefore going down. Stronghold grabbed both Sinesis and Sinister and pinned\nthem to a tree. Arrow stepped in the get cheap shots in on them. Sinesis and\nSinister grabbed Strongholds hands, and even shot him several times, but he\nwould not let go.\n\n&quot;I had a Straight Flush, damn it! I would have whupped Scamrock and that\nidiot Arrow both but then you have to come along and step on that branch!&quot;\nStronghold was talking nonsense, of course, but in a way it actually made\nsince, that branch was supporting their card table that was made from a tree\nstump. Stronghold released Sinesis and Sinoster and catches them again as\nthey fall, this time by the throats. Arrow laughed and started to suck up to\nStronghold, telling him how strong and deadly he was. Stronghold yelled and\nsqueezed harder...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;; &lt;Inferno731@...&gt;;\n&lt;firefox_y2k@...&gt;; &lt;carnage_blood@...&gt;;\n&lt;thecode@...&gt;; &lt;BioBuu@...&gt;; &lt;UnderT4976@...&gt;;\n&lt;Alloran2@...&gt;; &lt;steph_pack@...&gt;; &lt;inferno126@...&gt;;\n&lt;JP3884@...&gt;; &lt;jeniff69@...&gt;; &lt;tmrattrap@...&gt;;\n&lt;dustie21@...&gt;; &lt;nashtah@...&gt;; &lt;firestorm36@...&gt;;\n&lt;warbeacon@...&gt;; &lt;shadowwarrior_ax@...&gt;; &lt;RgDaN@...&gt;\nSent: Thursday, April 13, 2000 6:59 PM\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; Ok, the Egroups thing is up and should be functional.
