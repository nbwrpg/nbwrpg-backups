You don&#39;t have to read it unless you \nwant to be bored. =P (or interested, if you like physics and stuff.)\n\nThe boulder would land first, but not because it weighs more, \nbecause the feather float, it catches air. If it couldn&#39;t catch air, and \ntherefore couldn&#39;t float, then they would both land at the same time. \nEver watch Bill Nye: Science Guy? Wait.... lemme think about \nthis.  Weight is mass multiplied by gravity, therefore force. Force \ndoesn&#39;t affect velocity. \n\tThe equation you would have needed to use to calculate how \nfast the objects are traveling is Ep + Ek = Ep + Ek (Ek=kinetic \nenergy, and Ep=potential energy). \n\tEk on the left side would cancel, because v=0 (v=velocity). The \nEp on the right side would also cancel out, since h=0 (h=height). \t\n\tThat leaves Ep=Ek. Ep=mgh, and Ek=0.5mv^2. (the &quot; ^ &quot; sign \nrepresents &quot;to the power of&quot;). \n\tThen you&#39;d have mgh=0.5mv^2. Mass cancels, making leaving \nus with gh=0.5v^2. \nThus, I conclude that mass doesn&#39;t affect how fast you fall, only \nhow high you are at the start.\n\nPS: weight is a force, in newtons. Mass is usually in kilograms, or \npounds etc.\n\n\n\nOn 5 Apr 2001, at 15:42, dcoburn wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Hehe, rAuq, weight does effect how fast you fall.  If you took a feather, and a boulder, and dropped them from the same height, which would land first?
