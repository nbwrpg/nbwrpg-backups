A bit un nerved, but not frightened =\r\nenough to turn back and run. Instead, he would press on, and while doing so=\r\n, while holding Vestige in one arm, as his strength could allow him, with t=\r\nhe other arm, he reaches for a spare emergency canister of energon which he=\r\n had saved for dire need. This was that dire need. He opens it, and holds i=\r\nt for Vestige to drink from it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I don&#39;t know where we can find a repa=\r\nir chamber, but this should help you find just a little bit more energy. It=\r\n&#39;s my last reserve, but you need this more than I do. Here, drink, it&#39;s ene=\r\nrgon, and it will help you keep some energy in your body.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At the same =\r\ntime, Tucson was keeping an ear out for the metallic spiders and insects. H=\r\nis pace steady, as he continues to walk forward, keeping his headlights a b=\r\nlaze to light his way.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;ll get through this Vestige, I promise you.&quot;=\r\n\n\nVestige&#39;s systems flicker and sputter as Tuscon feeds him the energon\nand=\r\n then with a small burst of energy his optics brighten. &quot;Thank you\nTuscon.&quot;=\r\n he said, his voice horse and raspy but clearer than before.\nIt is obvious =\r\nthat although Vestige is doing a little better he is\nstill in need of repai=\r\nrs. For some reason his self repair circuits do\nnot seem to be healing as e=\r\nffeciently as they should.\n\nHe nods as Tuscon promised to get them through,=\r\n &quot;I . . . I don&#39;t know\nwhy, but I feel as if I can trust you.&quot; he says, his=\r\n voice weak but\nstill clear. With a shaky arm he points further down the pa=\r\nth that\nTuscon is taking them, &quot;There is where I must go, down there. The\nc=\r\nhamber where I need to be sits there.&quot;\n\nThe direction that Vestige points i=\r\ns simply a long hallways, that\nafter maybe 30 yards or so bends around a co=\r\nrner and apparently\ncontinues on. There are doors on either side of the hal=\r\nl at different\npoints, and lights on the cieling illuminate the hall ahead.=\r\n So far\nthere is no evidence of insects, and whatever scraping noise that w=\r\nas\nheard before seems to be much further away.\n\nVestige climbes unsteadily =\r\nto his feet, and much like an old man\nattempts to hobble slowly down the ha=\r\nll, seemingly focused on the task\nahead. &quot;Come.&quot; he says, his voice weak, b=\r\nut now filled with a grim\ndetermination.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
