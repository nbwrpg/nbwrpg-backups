A quick scan of his systems told\nhim that while the last attack had briefly flickered his cloak, it had\nreasserted itself, so he wondered how in the cosmos these guys were\nable to see him? \n\nWith a blast of power Nightrazor&#39;s boosters ignited pushing him still\nfurther into the air as small bites of pain ripped again into his\nsytems as bullets coaxed him still further away. \n\nHe reset his cloak again! This was too much for the minion, it was time\nto move on to the next point. If he stayed and fought he would have to\nface not only these two, but the ship - bad odds to say the least. \n\nA few acrobatic spins and he moved up and away from the scene, leaving\nthe Maximals behind as best as he could!\n\nPreston\n(Nightrazor)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
