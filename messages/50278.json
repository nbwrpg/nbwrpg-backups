Made true by transformer \n&gt; technology. I feed on energon, and need a fresh supply to keep me \nin \n&gt; working order. I don&#39;t know if pure energon will do, my creators \n&gt; never tested it on me, I was made to kill. Another thing about \n&gt; vampire&#39;s, they aren&#39;t alive, it&#39;s just a dead body. That&#39;s what I \n&gt; am, a dead body. I have no spark. Which is why I need Transformer \n&gt; juice to live. I hate it, I have never liked feeding on other \n&gt; Transformers, and I wish I could find a way to change me. Well, \nthere \n&gt; it is, I&#39;ve never told anyone, and now I have.
