He \nsensed\n&gt; Astral firing again. he wasn&#39;t worried about him, the trainer \nleaders armor\n&gt; seemed to be holding well against the shots from Astrals rifle. \nPrebon fired\n&gt; his rifle again destroying the second missle. His backpack was \nstarting to\n&gt; smoke from the way he was pushing for speed. He didn&#39;t worry though \nit\n&gt; should get him as far as the alliance base, getting back is \nsomething he&#39;d\n&gt; worry about later.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I will not fail, you will all fall before the might of the \nTrainers.&quot; he\n&gt; yells into his comm. he fires two more shots at Starlight and two \nin the\n&gt; direction of Recklessa. he didn&#39;t have time to aim so the shots \nwould have\n&gt; to be intended as a distraction.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, January 12, 2001 8:25 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: New Character!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Astral/Fenox/Starlight/Recklessa::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Astral jumps back, the charge exploding infront of him and sending\n&gt; &gt; him flying backwards.
