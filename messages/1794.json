She was dirty!\nBrightBlade scanned around and suddenly located just what she needed, a \nfresh water creek! She smiled to herself and then began to move slowly away \nfrom the tree and Gangon, she was in much need of a bath!\nThe creek wasn&#39;t to far away from the tree in which Gangon hung, in the same \nclearing and in clear sight of each spot.\nShe stuck a foot in and then pulled it back, it was COLD!\nBrightBlade then thought about how dirty she felt and just plain waded in, \nshe clenched her teeth as she wadded in to about waist height.\nIt was a good time to be thankful that her circuits were waterproof!*\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
