Unfortunately, his jet mode had \ndrained most of his energies.  Descending rapidly, Shockwave could see the \ncrashed ship.  It wasn&#39;t really big.  But it may or may not have an energon \ndispensor.  If it did...he may be able to get himself some energy.  Slamming \nto the ground, he slid, stopping after he slammed cone first into the crashed \nship.  Transforming to robot mode slowly and painfully, he got up, raising \nthe pistol embedded into his right hand.  Stepping slowly to the entrance of \nthe shuttle, he turned the coner, hand-pistol raised.  Looking around past \nthe corner, he saw nothing.  &quot;It&#39;s clear.&quot; he said aloud, quickly spotting an \nenergon dispensor.  Then a large room.  \n\n&quot;A CR chamber!&quot; hey yelled.  &quot;Perfect!&quot; the doors to the room swooshed open, \nrevealing where a CR chamber would be.  But evidently someone had ripped it \nout of the ship.  &quot;SLAG!&quot; Shockwave yelled, raising his pistol-hand firing a \nbolt off at where the CR chamber had been, blowing a small dent in the wall. \nHe calmed down, quickly disposing of his emotions.\n\nGoing back to the energon dispensor, it had three days worth.  Significantly \nless than the normal, but it would do for now.  Letting inetrnal repairs kick \nin, he drained the energon from the dispensor.  Then, with his hand, he \nripped it out of the wall. He set it down, getting a few tools from subspace \nas his right laser-hand became a white hand.  He began work on the dispensor.\n\n"}}
