And currently the \nAlliance Island is under attack by a single robot named Chaostaur, owned by \nRudra, but Punch is firing several autoguns on him and I am humbly waiting a \nresponse)\n\nShockwave/Unitron/Sixshot/Firestarter:\n\n\n\nShockwave did some basic and advanced maneuvers, and there were just to many \nshots as a dozen blasted a gaping hole in his right wing, which a few seconds \nlater was ripped off by the wind.  He reverted to biped mode and instantly \ntransformed to his ray gun mode.\n\nAs big as he was originally, this massive weapon bears upon Windlord, firing \noff a powerful blast of gamma rays.  The Emperor reverted back to robot mode, \nmissile launcher in his single hand, his energy resources temporarily drained \nfrom the demanding shot.\n\nMore down towards the ground was Unitron, in his tank mode, not fairing to \nwell.  Going at his full speed, he was able to dodge both missiles and all \nbut two shots from Aerotaur, but the ice blast from Gemini struck one of the \nextensive armor plates that protected his treads, and a fusion blast tore \nthrough the now greatly weakened armor there, blasting through the treads.\n\nUnitron came to a dead halt, the Deceptcion warrior in great pain.  He \nswerved his turret, firing off two explosive shells from his large cannon at \nthe Maximal tank that had struck him, getting ready to go to an alternate \nmode.  The mounted machine gun on his turret swivelled and fired off ten \nrapid laser bolts at the Gemini who had shot at him. \n\nMeanwhile, back in the air, the only STAG in existance easily dodged the six \nshots fired at him, coincidentally his name being Sixshot.  He armed a pair \nof missiles, launching them both, each splitting apart, one heading for \nCledar and the other at Blyer.\n\nAnd still in the air, for now, was Firestarter, third oldest among the \ncurrent Decepticons present at the battle.  His scanners detected someone \ngetting a lock on him and two incoming objects, so he barrel rolled, each \nmissile going by but the explosions from the shock wave rattled him a little, \na piece of shrapnel smashing a small hole through his cockpit and stabbing \ninto the empty seat.\n\n&quot;Lousy Autobots.&quot; he cursed, bringing his laser weaponry to full and \nlaunching off twenty rapid laser bolts down at Hot Rod.\n\n"}}
