He had his stealth \nmode on, so there was no possible way he could be detected, unless \none saw the slight indents his hooves made on the ground.\n\nHis body was like one of a cenataur, yet slightly different. He had \nhorse legs and body, but where the horse chest would be was a \nslightly human torso, with strong looking arms and chest. His face \nhad no mouth, just a nose, pointed ears, and two black almond eyes. \nAtop his head sat two stalk eyes which could twist in any direction. \nWhere the horse tail would be, was a 2 meters long tail, with a \nscythe like blade, wickedly sharp and coated with poison, on the end.\n\nThe stalk eyes swiveled slowly as he watched the battle, deciding the \nattakers were indeed stronger, but the defenders had the heart in \nthem. He sniggered. \n\nFor now, he would be content to watch. \n\nHis Stasis Pod had crashed not too far away from here, but since \neverybot was so consumed in this battle, he had snuck out and \ndiscovered the new world on his own.\n\nWith a curious cock of his head, he noted neither faction seemed to \nhave any leader. They were both disorganised, frantically firing in a \nfight to save their lives, no control whatsoever. With simple \nplanning, the Attackers would win easily.\n\nAs he watched, he occasionally heard words being called out. Names, \nobviously. He didn&#39;t have a name. Staring into the night sky with his \nstalk eyes, but keeping his main eyes on the battle, a whisper \nfloated into his head.\n\n&#39;Diabo..&#39; It said. He would have smiled, if he had a mouth. A perfect \nname. A name that protrayed his personality. A name that his leader \nhad used once.\n\n(OOC: Diabo actually means Devil.. or Evil Soul in Spanish.., I&#39;ll \nsend in a Profile soon)\n\n\n"}}
