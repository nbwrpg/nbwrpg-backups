I am Magmatron.&quot; He started. &quot;I understand you\nmade\n&gt; Bazooka a Predacon. And from what he tells me you are a great fighter, and\n&gt; seeing this arial battle I know he is right. If you will follow me we can\n&gt; talk where it is safer. But first you must attach this to you, my autoguns\n&gt; will not see you as a threat with this on.
