Why you ask? Because I want\n&gt; nothing but good things for this RPG. Since I joined back in July 2000,\n&gt; this RPG has been a very big part of my life. And like any other part of\n&gt; my life, I want things to get better. If I am elected to the council, I\n&gt; will do everything in my power to make things beter. I will listen to\n&gt; everyones ideas, and if they will help the RPG, I will try to impliment\n&gt; them. \n&gt;  And if we want to talk about RP ability, you all know me. Even though\n&gt; this was my first RPG, I know the rules well, and rarely mode.\n&gt; I would like to think of everyone in this RPG as friends, and would\n&gt; appreciate you&#39;re vote.
