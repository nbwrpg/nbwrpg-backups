Although he could not see him, he could sense his pressense. He \n&gt; then turns his head back to lie back and as he does so, he closes his \n&gt; eyes, to reach deep down into that special place in his spark, the one he \n&gt; could feel for Talon, and everyone else, the one that lead him back to \n&gt; Rodimus instead of abandoning him in the dark insectile pit.  It may not \n&gt; have been the Matrix, but it was something of his own accord.   Yet, he \n&gt; takes a moment to slip back into a trance like state, to consult the \n&gt; matrix power within him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Primus, I could not leave Rodimus abandoned in the dark pits of the \n&gt; Black Fortress, even though he had told me to do so.  It is not his time, \n&gt; and I will not see him die needlessly.  Give me the strength to  reach \n&gt; Rodimus, and bring him back into the light, where he belongs.  I know I \n&gt; can do this, I have to do this, in your honor I will never give up on my \n&gt; bretheren.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside the observation room, Night Shift stands close to Silverbolt, with \n&gt; the same kind of hope and faith as his comrade.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re right Silverbolt, we can do this, we have what it takes ta \n&gt; overcome the worst and give it our best.  We&#39;ve got somethn&#39; Hydras will \n&gt; never have, somethn&#39; we got gon&#39; on right here, and somethn&#39; that ain&#39;t \n&gt; shot out of some fancy plasma weapon.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot now consoles Noctorro.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re worried that Tucson might not come out of it, I can&#39;t blame you \n&gt; for being worried because this is a really risky step he&#39;s taking.  But I \n&gt; can tell ya that, Night Shift&#39;s right. We got something that beats the \n&gt; most powerful weapon in the universe, and Hydras doesn&#39;t have it.  It&#39;s \n&gt; something we all share, something deep down inside us.  And unless you \n&gt; know what compassion is, you&#39;ll never have that special power.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She gently puts a hand on Noctoro&#39;s leg.\n&gt;\n&gt; You got that special power, I know you do.  He&#39;ll make it, you&#39;ll see, \n&gt; Tucson Prime will make it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap keeps his hopes up and eyes on what happens inside the room.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We just gotta hold onta hope guys, we just gotta.  I know I will. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot ponders things for a moment.  She could feel something deep \n&gt; down inside of her, and she felt that she needed to share that with \n&gt; others.  So, she gives her hand to Perceptor at first, and another to Rat \n&gt; Trap, who smiles back.  He then turns and gives Night Shift his hand, as \n&gt; Night Shift smiles, and then gives Silverbolt his.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I think I know where she&#39;s gon&#39; with this..  We gotta pull tagether \n&gt; guys.  Our hope in our leader is what&#39;s gonna pull him through. After all, \n&gt; didn&#39;t someone say till all are one at some point or other?  Well, this is \n&gt; where we get ta test that out.  Who&#39;s with us?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson lies on the bed, and waits for Stanton to hook him up to connect \n&gt;&gt; &gt; him to Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I promised to save him Stanton, I will not go back on my word. I know \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I will be able to do this, and if any harm comes to me, then nothing \n&gt;&gt; &gt; will be held against any of you but myself. I will take full blame for \n&gt;&gt; &gt; what happens. In Primus&#39;s speed my friends, in Primus&#39;s speed. Good \n&gt;&gt; &gt; will prevail, and the light will remain forever lit. Now, let&#39;s do this \n&gt;&gt; &gt; before we lose him.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He lies still to await hookup.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Santon nodded as he he gestured for Legacy to begin connecting Tuscon\n&gt;&gt; to Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;This is alien technology that is affecting Rodimus.&quot; Bump spoke up\n&gt;&gt; from his position next to Tuscon. &quot;We do not know what will happen or\n&gt;&gt; how this will affect you or Rodimus. Be very careful.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Santon pointed to a seperate scanning module, &quot;We will be watching\n&gt;&gt; your spark signature as well. If it should dip into critical levels we\n&gt;&gt; shall pull you out.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;He is ready.&quot; Legacy said as he connected two thick cables and\n&gt;&gt; several smaller ones to Tuscon&#39;s power module.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Santon nodded again, &quot;Begin.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *    *    *    *    *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Outside in the observation room, it doesn&#39;t take Straight Shot long to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; see what is going on. But deep down she knew he was doing the right \n&gt;&gt; &gt; thing, she felt it too. Night Shift could also feel what his comrade \n&gt;&gt; &gt; was up to, and a feeling of absolute positivity comes over him as well. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride, however has the same feelings as Noctorro and Bump. But \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap holds onto the positivity that Straight Shot and Night Shift \n&gt;&gt; &gt; share as well as Silverbolt.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I know wheels, he&#39;s gonna make it, I know he is. Somethn&#39; inside me \n&gt;&gt; &gt; tells me so and that doesn&#39;t happen too often.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to him, and holds his hand.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;You feel it too, so do I. He can do this, I know he can. Silverbolt&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; right, he can do this. We have to believe he can. It&#39;s our belief in \n&gt;&gt; &gt; him that&#39;s gonna make him pull through.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Night Shift keeps a finger crossed as he stands next to Silverbolt.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;You feel it too, huh Silverbolt. That deep down feeling that no matter \n&gt;&gt; &gt; what happens, good is gonna prevail. It&#39;s real guys, it&#39;s real. Tucson \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Prime&#39;s got somethn&#39; inside him that I can&#39;t explain but it&#39;s there and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; it&#39;s gonna work.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap chimes in.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Just think, we&#39;ll have two Primes plus Lord Elder, and Lord Perseus \n&gt;&gt; &gt; on our side. That&#39;s really gonna put a damper on lizard lip&#39;s day. Ohh \n&gt;&gt; &gt; yeah, when we&#39;re all back tagether, look out, because that golden age \n&gt;&gt; &gt; is just a few shots away.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot listens to him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; And then maybe, just maybe we&#39;ll have something to celebrate.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Silverbolt continued to watch the operation through the glass, his\n&gt;&gt; face lightly reflected in the glass was thoughtful as his optics took\n&gt;&gt; in the scene. &quot;We will be victorious, because have to be.&quot; he said as\n&gt;&gt; his own hand clamped down. He was a soldier, a knight, who was ready\n&gt;&gt; to do battle, and yet there was nothing to battle. He felt helpless.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yet none of that was on his face as he looked back, &quot;Sometimes all we\n&gt;&gt; have is hope.&quot; he said his voice confident. &quot;No doubt Hydras is also\n&gt;&gt; using this time to consoldate his black army for what ever evil scheme\n&gt;&gt; he has in mind.&quot; He smiled, &quot;But we shall be ready for him, with all\n&gt;&gt; of our combined might.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He looked back at the operation as Tuscon was being connected, &quot;We\n&gt;&gt; will be waiting for you when you return.&quot; he said, his voice low.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
