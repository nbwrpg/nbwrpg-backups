Beachbomber.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Lunarpine. &quot;The Alliance is a group of &#39;neutral&#39; bots, led by\nZardus. They ally themselves with whoever they please. In this battle, they\nhelped up. In the last one, they nearly killed us.&quot;\n\nHe then grins. &quot;We&#39;re in better condition than the Ark &#39;cause we can dodge.\nSomething the Ark can&#39;t do. My name&#39;s Prowl, what&#39;s yours?&quot;\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
