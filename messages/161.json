One was a raptor, almost like her, and the other was a \nflying panther.\n\nShe snarled with her mouth gaped. All of her teeth were exposed. She was \nangry, two bots had trespassed into her territory. She spread her three \ndigit fingers from behind the vegiation.\n\nThe raptor moved off like a shadow, keeping down wind. She knew how to \nsurvive here. As far as she was concerned, she was a child of the wild, not \nbrought on-line to it, but forced to live by it. She betrayed her leader, \nand this is what she got. She was a clone, but she no longer cared. She was \nwho she was. Try to change it, she couldn&#39;t. She was a female version of a \nmale warrior. She was an assissin. Well built, with many talents.\n\nShe watched them, traling them as if she was a harmless shadow. When the \ntime was perfect, she would kill them.\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
