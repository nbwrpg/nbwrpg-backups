He was in beast mode, laying in a forest. He could \nsmell smoke, and could see missile fragments and mechfluid all around him. \nThe Alliance bot gets to his feet, transforming into robot mode.\n\nHe looks down at himself. His internal defences seem to have repaired most of \nthe damage. Reptilica takes a few steps, yelping in surprise as he falls down \nover something. He stands up, looking back at what he tripped over. It was a \nTasmanian Devil.\n\n&quot;Yo, Devil, get up,&quot; Reptilica says, shaking DevilDuer&#39;s shoulder. DevilDuer \nopens his eyes.\n\n&quot;Are you my mommy?&quot; DevilDuer says in a funny voice, then falling back into \nunconsciousness. Reptilica shakes his head, picking up DevilDuer and carrying \nhim off toward the CR chambers.\n\n"}}
