Which meant that they would bump right into him, sending both of the Maximals sprawling upon the floor. His balance was perfectly fine, but a good enough shove with Prowl and himself in this position would send anybot onto their face.\nHowever, Dinobot was a little surprised at just how light Prowl was. Though he knew that flyers were somewhat sight he had no idea that they weighed as little as Prowl seemed to. However, if situations were reversed and it was he who had to be boosted towards the vent, Prowl would have no hope in the Pit of supporting him. There was just no way. With his circuitry and muscle mass there was no chance of him being light at all, it just wasn�t possible.  However, he never did regret being as heavy as he was. With the added power of his weight he could throw more of it into strikes, use it as an advantage.\nThe feel of Prowl�s weight lifted caused Dinobot to look up, seeing the Maximal disappears into the open vent shaft.\nDinobot then looked back to his level and around, no bots in sight or within scanner�s reach. A particularly good sign as far as he was concerned.\nHe then looked back up towards the vent and saw Prowl leaning from it with an extended hand, noting that a bot such as Prowl couldn�t possibly pull him up.\nDinobot growled as he then looked at the wall and then his claws, resisting the logical movement to take the hand Prowl offered to him. With his weight he would pull Prowl right out of that vent and they would both fall on their backs, causing enough noise to alert the scanners and they would be found. No. He wasn�t about to cause such trouble just because he took an offered lift.\nHe then looked back up at Prowl with his reaching hand, narrowed his optics for a moment.\nJudging by the distance of the vent he could easily get to it himself, yet noting that climbing would be the worst way to do so. There would be his claw marks left in the wall leading towards the vent, a plain give-away if another bot was to happen by. No�he would have to jump. But if Prowl didn�t move his hand he would soon loose it if he did.\nDinobot snarled and simply batted Prowls hand away, leaving it so that he wouldn�t have to cause the Maximal injury.\nBut then he looked at the wall again, then back up at the vent.\nWith a step back he kept his optics on the edge of the vent, bunching his muscles for the strain they needed for him to pull off this action.\nThen without the flick of a tail he covered the distance from him to the wall, just before reaching the wall he leaped, grabbed hold of the edge of the vent and simply used the momentum of his leap to bring him up right infant of Prowl.\nHis two superior claws were dug into the edge of the vent, then simply pulling them out with no more then the tiniest sound of ripping metal.\nDinobot looked at his claws but then looked at Prowl in the darkness of the vent, simply staying there in the kneel he had landed in. He moved in a bit and replaced the vent cover, everything looking as if nobot had ever been there.\nThere had been no sound as he had gotten himself up, and no sound as he waited for Prowl to continue their mission.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
