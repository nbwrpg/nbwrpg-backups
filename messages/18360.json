He winced, but \nthan laughed.\n\nAll right mousey, he thought, I was only going to take you back to \nKitKat and find out how much you know. But if you&#39;re going to play \nrough, a dead mouse is as good as any.\n\nStarscream&#39;s path was a little clearer now, and he could float across \nthe log. But he didn&#39;t need to. The bot was done enough to try and go \nthrough the fire. All she needed was a little help.....\n\nStarscream loaded another missle and locked it on.\n\n&quot;My first kill in the new body......&quot;\n\nStarscream fired the missle, heading straight for Darkmouse.\n\n\n"}}
