He&#39;s had the worst luck while in this war. He had \nnever gotten on anyone&#39;s good side ever since he was brought back on-line. \nCertainly Hell Beast&#39;s troops. He was still nervous around Megatron.\n\nHe lowered his head and closed is eyes. Maybe it was time to calm down. \nTemper like his couldn&#39;t be good for him.\n\nAfter several seconds, Quickstrike listened in, thinking he&#39;d heard a \nbanging going on in the base. He opened his eyes and looked around.\n\n&quot;Ya hear somethin&#39;?&quot; he asked Mantella.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
