Quatro headed to the control room, and looked at =\r\nthe, well, controls and stuff.

Quatro did some fu=\r\nnky stuff with his technologically-advanced body and mind, and was then abl=\r\ne to see everywhere inside the base.  He saw Slaughter going to attack Squa=\r\nwktalk, who was giving Cepta a tour.  He saw two other bots inside the base=\r\n as well(forgot their names.)  It was almost as if Quatro was controlling a=\r\nn invisible camera which could move around everywhere, with his mind.  Quat=\r\nro could even see an area around the outside of the base.\n\n       But, that=\r\n wasn&#39;t what Quatro needed.

And guess which one he wanted to look =\r\nat?  Yep, Megatron&#39;s.  Quatro read some history and then read about Megatro=\r\nn in the present.  Quatro decided he had enough from there, so he disconnec=\r\nted the wire thingy and it went back into his forehand.  Now, he had to get=\r\n in contact with Megatron soon.
