To her, it was a threat. Sometimes she took the littlest \nthings as threats. That was the way she was. With her temperament and \nweariness of Megatron, she turned that way. She watched his face and \nmovements. It wasn&#39;t the same as the Dinobot face she was used to. But she \ncould still read him. She bared her teeth back at him. She payed no \nattention to Sniper, now as she focused on a possible threat.\n\n&quot;About Megatron?&quot; she said Dinobot, hearing about her question. She squinted \na brief moment and leaped forward at him, in a more curious way than \nthreatening. She kept her legs bent, and brought her clawless hands out to \nhim. Slag her build. &quot;Tell me if you know about Megatron!&quot;\n\nPrimus, she was nearly desperate. She wanted to kill the son of a \nmaintenance bot as well as find out why he had stopped tracking her.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
