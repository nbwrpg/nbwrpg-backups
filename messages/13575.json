He turned his tail \nand skittered off to a boulder lying near a wall. He hunkered down to \nthe ground, tail low, chin inches from touching the ground. \n\nHe poked the side of his head out from the side of the boulder, \nhearing a rowdy commotion. Dark Mouse was behind most of it. It \nlooked like she was going psycho. He showed the left half of his \nlong, scorpion body, trying to show that he was still there, and \ntrying to get some of his pride back.\n\n\n"}}
