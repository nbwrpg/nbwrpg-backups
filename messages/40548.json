For the moment,=\r\n I am \nabout to \n&gt; enter a gladiator league. I am also about to conclude an=\r\n agreement \nwith \n&gt; Zardus the leader of the faction called the Alliance. T=\r\nhey could \nassist us, \n&gt; for now. I will recommend you to Zardus.\n&gt; \n&gt; (to =\r\nZardus):\n&gt; I am on the move. (he started over to where Zardus was) But I mu=\r\nst \nremind \n&gt; you that I will take part to the IGL and that I shall soon de=\r\npart. \nIf any of \n&gt; your troops need a ride aboard the Hellgate, it&#39;s on me=\r\n.
