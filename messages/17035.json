I read some previous posts, and, really, a Transformer&#39;s \nRPG is \n&gt; cool!!!  Tell me how this is for a first post and new character.\n&gt; \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~\n&gt; [Ganthrax]\n&gt; \n&gt; Ganthrax was settling down by a lake, watching the night stars. \nThe \nwater \n&gt; glimmered from the moonlight.  Ganthrax&#39;s dark body could only be \nseen by \n&gt; his glowing red optics.  He walked up to the edge of the lake, and \nlooked at \n&gt; his reflection.  He thought to himself, Earth was wonderful.  \nMarvelous.  \n&gt; Ganthrax went over by some trees, and went to sleep, his red optics \ngetting \n&gt; dimmer and dimmer.  So much beauty, so many things to see, so many \nbots to \n&gt; kill.  Yes, Earth was wondeful.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Did I do okay?  Did I do anyth\n\n\n"}}
