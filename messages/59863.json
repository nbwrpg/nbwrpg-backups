But let&#39;s \n&gt; face, it took me half an hour to go through all messages. There is \na \n&gt; problem, but nothing that we can&#39;t repair.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here are some suggestions:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Go through all messages before you start to reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Reply only once with each character, but try to incorporate a \n&gt; reply to every character he talked to.\n&gt; \n&gt; - try to keep your posting time to a reasonable distance when \nthere \n&gt; are more than two people involved\n&gt; \n&gt; - Be mindful of others, please!\n&gt; \n&gt; This is not something to drag you down, just to help you live with \n&gt; each other.\n\n\n"}}
