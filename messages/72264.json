For this moment, his options were limited.  He could not leave\n&gt; Rodimus, and without further assistance he could not contact the MAXIMALS\n&gt; due to the jamming field that was covering the entire basin and area.\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, he also could not ask those who lived here for further help,\n&gt; not wanting to risk them being a target or making them take sides over in\n&gt; this war.\n&gt;\n&gt; And also getting the &#39;suggestio&#39; over from UNUS over towards RODIMUS,\n&gt; wondering just why they were so strongly but keeping quiet as he spoke to\n&gt; RODIMUS, &quot;Yes, rest.  Your friends will be around soon.  Don&#39;t succumb to\n&gt; gloom and doom.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Waiting for UNUS to tell him where to go now, not wanting to do anything\n&gt; aggressive, and filing away the information on SABERBACK and MAGMATRON to\n&gt; tell them as soon as he could, as well as a possible third army, and an\n&gt; outpost of escaped neutrals.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nUNUS nodded as he left the room, followed by ASTRA and FIREHORN and\npresumably WHEELIE as well.\n\nAs they did so another soldier, one looking like all the rest of them\ncame up qickly to UNUS and spoke into his ear.\n\nUNUS nodded as he looked curiously at WHEELIE and the symbol that he wore.\n\nWhen the other soldier reached an end of whatever he was saying UNUS\nclapped him on the shoulder, &quot;You have done well Darkhoof.&quot; he said.\n\nTurning to look at WHEELIE there was a smile on UNUS&#39; face, &quot;It would\nseem that there is another of your kind in here looking as well, a\nsilver dragon of some kind? He has the other symbol that your friend\ndescribed.&quot; Of course talking about the Maximal symbol.\n\nUNUS looked at DARKHOOF and then back at WHEELIE, &quot;Somehow he ended up\nfighting Grimlock and his men.&quot; His tone was dark as he talked. &quot;They\npatrol the jungle looking for stragglers to pick off. From what I&#39;m\ntold he was able to hide your companion and distract him, but I don&#39;t\nthink your friend came alone.&quot;\n\nDARKHOOF nodded and took up the narrative at a gesture from UNUS,\n&quot;There were others.&quot; DARKHOOF said calmly, although there was a\ntiredness in his voice. &quot;I couldn&#39;t couln&#39;t get close enough to see\ntheir symbol, but one turned into a black wheeled vehicle like you and\nyour other friend.&quot; Evidently DARKHOOF knew of RODIMUS.\n\nhe continued, &quot;Grimlock went after them. One of them got hurt, the\nvehicled one I believe, but they made it back their craft.&quot;\n\nFIREHORN nodded, &quot;Grimlock and his team are tough, but not all that fast.&quot;\n\nUNUS looked at WHEELIE, &quot;Does any of this sound familar?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
