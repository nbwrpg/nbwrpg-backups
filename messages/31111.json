Lunarpine owed him a dept that\nhe wasn&#39;t wanting to explain to anyone, he fealt in his spark that it was\nhis best option, it was his ONLY option.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, March 27, 2001 11:24 PM\nSubject: Ice\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; She woke up in the CR tank and the images she had been projecting\n&gt; stopped.  She opened the door and stepped out.  Something didn&#39;t make\n&gt; sence to her. If she just got out of the CR unit, then why&#39;d she feel\n&gt; so tired.  She looked around and transformed into griffin mode.\n&gt; Standing on all fours, she stretched her wings. Her shoulder felt\n&gt; great, her wounds were nicely healed, but she had a few new scars to\n&gt; proudly wear.  She opened up her mind to Lunarpine. &quot;How are you\n&gt; feeling? Have you had your turn in the CR yet?&quot; Then she remembered\n&gt; his remark about her wieght. She smirked and chuckled to herself.\n&gt; She thought to herself, I&#39;ll get him for that one, he&#39;ll never see it\n&gt; coming.\n&gt;\n&gt; Despite it all, she cared for Lunarpine with all her spark. If she\n&gt; let anything happen to him, she&#39;d rip her spark out and give it to\n&gt; Veratis on an energon platter.  It was her love for him that kept her\n&gt; alive while her spark sat in a jar in Veratis&#39; lab. And she wasn&#39;t\n&gt; going to give him up now.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
