It made sense,\n&gt; sometimes it was far better not to move then to run.  He was also losing\n&gt; energy rather quickly and felt the need to conserve it.\n&gt;\n&gt; He lies down on his belly, with his neck down on the ground and tail coiled\n&gt; tightly around his feet.  Wings are tucked tightly against his body to\n&gt; conceal himself in the vegetation.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a moment of near silence as GRIMLOCK shifted into beast mode\nand sniffed the air, his head turning one way and then the other, his\nkeen senses looking for the slightest scent of something. Nothing\nmoved but the breezes, even the sounds of the animals had stopped.\n\nHe tilted his head finally as if finally caught the scent, and with\none of his dimuniative arms he pointed, &quot;There!&quot; he said with an eager\nfinality. &quot;Get him!&quot;\n\nAll four of the transmetal dinosaurs run at the scent GRIMLOCK picked\nup, running away from TUSCON and down the path he had come!\n\n&quot;There.&quot; the voice said by TUSCON&#39;s ear, this time the voice sounded\ntired and worn. &quot;I hope your friends do not posses the hubris that you\ndo.&quot; There is another feeling of strange breezes and energy and then\nthe world seemed to shift back into focus.\n\nGRIMLOCK and his team were gone, the sound of them moving through the\nfoliage could be heard moving away.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
