Lady Hawk warned him that there could be problems if\nFZ\n&gt; &gt; were to transfer the DNA. Problems including the beasts ferocity and\nkiller\n&gt; &gt; instinct causing them to turn on thier creators. Lady Hawk upheld her\nend of\n&gt; &gt; the bargain and wants Zardus to uphold his and release her. last post I\n&gt; &gt; remember she asked ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Can I go now?&quot; Lady Hawk asked not happy that she was still a prisoner\nin\n&gt; &gt; the Iron Fist.
