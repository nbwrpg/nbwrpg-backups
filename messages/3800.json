Though \nunder most of the circumstances it was fair, some of it wasn&#39;t.  I was in a \nbad mood, though that is no excuse.  I will be more careful.  Thanks for the \nperson who let me know)\n\n\nThe \nOblitercons/Hades/Anubis/Bumblebee/Injector/Manterror/Ramhorn/Bumblebee/Double\n Punch/Counter Punch/Koga Shuko/Serpentor/Unitron:\n\n\n\n\nPyro yelled, seeing the missile coming for him.  All he could do was stay in \nhis current mode and hope for the best, all his treads had been slaughtered \nby blasts earlier.  Screaming, the other three Oblitercons up their getting \nout of the blast zone, watched Pyro slide forward through the ground as the \nmissile went off, flipping him several times, Pyro reverting to robot mode, \nunconsciouss.\n\n---\n\nDark One threw the gun he had into the air, Hiss transforming to robot mode \nand landing on his feet.  Raising his weapon, he sighed, hearing Zardus.  He \nhad disobeyed orders enough for one day.  He was after all, under a contract. \n Bringing up his rifle, he fired two bursts off at Set.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown transformed to robot mode, firing six rounds off at Ominous.\n\n---\n\nHiss fired off three fusion blasts at Hades, two missing.\n\n---\n\nScavenger felt someone on his hood.  He felt the weight get off.  \nTransforming to robot mode, leaning against the tree he had hit for support, \nhe saw Dinobot.  Raising his rifle, he heard Zardus&#39; transmission.  &lt;Ok \nmommy, I love ya&gt; he said in a reply to Zardus, falling to his back \nunconsciouss.\n\n---\n\nHades yelled, Dinobot&#39;s shots sending him flying backwards through the air, \nlanding on his back.\n\n---\n\nAnubis raised his rifle, firing three plasma shots off at Dinobot.\n\n---\n\nKoga Shuko smiled.  Mass damage had been done.  Even if they retreated, the \nnext time they attacked the Ark wouldn&#39;t be at full efficiency.  Attack after \nattack WOULD bring down the Ark.  As long as no one stopped them first.  \nRaising his missile launcher, he fired a rocket off at the Ark.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor leaned against a rock for support, he had been able to must enough \nto strength to make himself look strong and make the Pred (Cyber Claw) run \noff (so he thinks), but he wasn&#39;t starting to get drained.  Firing off his \nlast blast from his plasma launcher at the Ark, he sat down, twiddling his \nthumbs.\n\n======\n\nShockwave&#39;s sight came back on.  He had almost been smashed in half, smashing \nthrough 50 feet of tree branches and a tree itself.  Blast that scaly robot \nwho had blew off his wing (Koga Shuko).   Transforming to robot mode, though \nthe actual time it took was eight minutes, he began to limp away.  He may be \nable to get a CR chamber.\n\n======\n\nBumblebee slammed through a tree from Archangel&#39;s missiles, going \nunconsciouss.\n\n---\n\nSeeing the rest of the Maxis run off, Manterror picked up Bumblebee, using \nhim as a shield to block Ramulus&#39; shots with a crafty smile.  He, Injector, \nand Counter Punch went into the Predacon base.  Injector dumped Ramhorn off \nin Double Punch&#39;s quarters, though he stayed to guard him.  \n\nDouble Punch, Manterror, and Bumblebee got into CR chambers.\n\n---\n\nCounter went to his quarters despite his wounds.  Activating his interal com, \nhe &quot;spoke&quot; in his mind &quot;into the com&quot;.  &lt;Zardus, it&#39;s your spy, Punch.  The \nlittle battle between Maxis and Predacons near the Predacon base has ended.  \nThree Maximals are down.  One dead.  One reprogrammed.  And one will be \nreprogrammed soon enough.  Minimal damage to the Preds.  Heavy damage to the \ntwo Maximals who retreated.  The unit Quickstrike seems to show care and \ncompassion.  I will be returning to our ship so you may contact me anytime&gt;\nTransforming to his dingo mode, he exited the Predacon base, hauling it to \nthe Alliance&#39;s base.\n\n\n"}}
