It really was a nice thought�but it \nstill didn�t seem as if it was ever going to happen.\nThere had been alliance after alliance and every one ended with bots being \ninjured and one side betray, peace seemed like something out of a fairy tail \nby now. Every bot hoped for it but it never came, the thought of reaching \npeace now seeming more impossible to think of then she would care to admit.\nBut even now as she pondered Batteras words she was reminded of a saying \nthat she had heard in the past, one that seemed more ancient that first \nthought:\nEven in the darkest of Night,\nThere will�and always be,\nA twinkle of Light.\nAnd in those few words, there stood the hope of the light of peace in the \ndarkness of this war�however small it may be.\nAnd there�stood her answer as well.\nIron Raptor glanced towards Prowl for a moment before turning her optics \ntowards Battera, her answer written all over them as a smile creased her \nlips.*\n\n� Alright�I�ll join you and your causes for peace. The Matrix knows I want \nit as much as any other bot fighting this cursid war.�\n\n* But even as she spoke those words she knew that there was a 99.9% chance \nthat peace wouldn�t be reached and the Beast Wars would go on�but she had to \ngive it a chance.\nHowever, just in case she would power up her Second Beast Mode just in case \nthe Predacons decided to pull on of their little tricks.\nThough, first she had to deal with a few more things before she was able to \nleave, things that wouldn�t take more then a mega-cycle or so at more to \nsort out.*\n\n� Though, I do have to warn you. You�ve come at a rather busy time for \nme�and I�ll need a bit of time to get a few things straightened out before I \nleave for this Embassy of yours.�\n\n* Iron Raptor then straightened her stand as she remembered something, about \nthat intruder that they had caught earlier today and what Battera said about \nthe Predacon commanders joining the Peace Talks as well.\nShe had brought up a scan on that intruder earlier and was rather surprised \nto find out that it was Hell Beast�s Second In Command, meaning: since he \nwas gone, that they held one of the Predacon commander in their brig at this \nvery moment.\nHer icy blue optics then turned towards Kluster.*\n\n� Speaking about Predacons, don�t we happen to be holding two on the brig at \nthe moment?�\n\n* Her optics then turning towards Prowl.*\n\n� And doesn�t one of those bots just happen to be Hell Beasts Second In \nCommand?�\n\n* Iron Raptor then leaned against the table and crossed her arms, a \nthoughtful expression on her face.*\n\n� And if I�m not mistaken, since Hell Beast is gone�wouldn�t that make that \none�Predacon Commander of his lot?�\n\n* She looked up at both men and awaited their answers, knowing that if they \nheld a Predacon commander in their brig then they would have to be released \nto accompany them to this Peace Talk.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
