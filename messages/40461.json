I will accept that absorbing thing however as for \nusing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it to better herself I will ignore that since that entire energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; absorbing and bettering thing is not listed anywhere in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blacknightmares bio. Which I just looked at, and if it suddenly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;appeared&quot; there I would be very suspicious of it. Also note \nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy from sparks doesnt act like normal energy. Since \nBlacknightmare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; isnt a creation of the Bamphomet and the energy is specifically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; created to be used solely by those he creates it would have a \nvery bad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; negative effect on blacknightmare if she absorbed it and/or \ntried to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; use it to improve anything.
