She never expected that to happen. She \npulled away from him and looked at him  with utter shock on her \nface. &quot;You....you....you..ah...you...&quot; she turned and put her hand \nagainst the wall. She was in total shock.  She didn&#39;t know what to \nsay or think.  Thoughts of Drillbit killing her was one though that \nran through her mind.   The other was the thought of Destructor \nkilling Drillbit.  She felt her spark pound as she still couldn&#39;t \nbelieve what just happened.  She knew one thing was for certain.  She \nhad a big problem on her hands.  If she refused Destructor, he could \ntake away everything that he had given them.  That would leave her \noroginal troops helpless.  She didn&#39;t know what to do.  She faced the \nwall, as her spark pounded and her mind went scattering.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  I know you would. But listen. It will never work.
