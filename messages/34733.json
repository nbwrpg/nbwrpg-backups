With a\nthought of annoyance, it turns and floats back toward earth. The Ikoto\nwere always annoying, as it had thought to itself many times during\nthis meeting, but this bet should be interesting.\n\nThe Vok being arrives back at earth in a matter of seconds, and\nsecretly activates its link to the servant it had made. Unknowingly to\nZardus, thoughts were being placed into his mind, quickly taken up by\nZardus&#39;s mind and turned into ideas and plans.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- Azafroth / Ikoto ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Azafroth and the other Ikoto flash their approval. &quot;Good good,&quot; \n&gt; thinks Azafroth globally, &quot;We shall choose a group of bots from \n&gt; Cybertron who&#39;re being sent on a secret mission which we forged \n&gt; and they fell for. They will... disappear, only to find themselves \n&gt; crashing towards earth. Once they arrive, they will begin, \n&gt; unknowingly, to wage a war for the destruction of the very planet \n&gt; that they wish to help!&quot; as Azafroth finishes his speech, he and the \n&gt; other Ikoto are visibly shimmering with malevolent excitement. \n&gt; &quot;You will hear from us soon.&quot; Azafroth stops shimmering, &quot;Until we \n&gt; meet again, Vok representative.&quot; With a small wave of energy is \n&gt; thrown from the Ikoto as they teleport. a faint telepathik message \n&gt; drifts on the wave, &quot;Untilllll weee meeettt aggaiinnnn, Vokkkkk.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
