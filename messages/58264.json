He and \nCeleron met in mid-air about half way between the two places and \nthey were both almost hit by the firepower of the angry prisoner.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Why would you imprison somebody with their weapons still \nweapons?&quot; Celeron angrily asked Tigon (the warden).\n&gt; \n&gt; Tigon hadn&#39;t waited to listen to Celeron, he was already locked in \na battle with the prisoner.\n&gt; \n&gt; The prisoner fired a volley of three shots which hit Tigon in the \nchest.  Tigon blasted the prisoner with his main gun, and then \nkicked the prisoner out of the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron decided to sneak over to the pod and see what he could \nlearn.\n&gt; \n&gt; The prisoner got back up and got up real close to Tigon.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You won&#39;t take me back!  NEVER!&quot; at that, he started firing \nviolently.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tigon tried to shield his face with his arm; he tripped and fell \nover backwards down a hill.  The prisoner saw his chance and jumped \non Tigon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron decided to intervene (there would always be time to pick \nthrough the pod later) he charged up his arm cannons and sneaked up \nbehind the raging prisoner.  Tigon was not moving and the prisoner \nwas trying to break open the armor on his back.  Celeron fired both \nof his cannons pointblank into the prisoner.  He was blown back a \nfew yards and fell into the sand.\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron decided that if he didn&#39;t act now, he&#39;d lose too and could \npossibly die.  He grabbed a pair of handcuffs from Tigon&#39;s tools, \nand he shot at the prisoner to make sure he was down.  When cuffed \nthe prisoner, the prisoner tried to break free.  Tigon reactivated \njust in time to see Celeron attempting to disarm the prisoner.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This prisoner has a protective field that keeps him from being \ndisarmed.  The only way I could detain him, was to render him \nunconscious.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The prisoner was still struggling, Tigon took a device from his \nkit and strapped it to the prisoner&#39;s neck.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now we can momentarily control him.&quot; Tigon explained.\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron kicked the prisoner who was now powerless to resist him.  \nTigon glared at Celeron and Celeron immediately stopped.\n&gt; \n&gt; When they got back into the ship The Warden chained the prisoner \nto the wall and had Celeron guard him.  Tigon then prepared a \nchamber to keep the prisoner in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey...isn&#39;t there some way to disarm him?&quot; Celeron asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I haven&#39;t found a way to.  I&#39;ve been trying for several years.  \nHe has an energon field that is generated when someone tries to \ntamper with his weapons.  I&#39;ve given up trying&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron thought that this was a challenge worth trying.  He rubbed \nhis hands together and schemed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; --------- Original Message ---------\n&gt; \n&gt; DATE: Wed, 24 Sep 2003 14:24:26\n&gt; From: &quot;Alex .&quot; &lt;rm2kmidi@l...&gt;\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Cc: \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;The radio beeped....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;This is Celeron....

Once he got a lock on the prisoner who was rapidly \nclosing on him, he fired and blew it back about half as far as he \nhad been blown back.  Celeron realizing that he&#39;s out matched began \nto run.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The prisoner had full flight capability and as they flew around \nfor a while Celeron discovered that it was also well armed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Armor at 10%.......Target at estimated 75%&quot; read the computer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Arrrgggg!&quot; Celeron grunted as he attacked.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;{Bleep}  Celeron....I have the equipment, I&#39;ll be out there \nASAP....standby.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;(To be continued)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Message: 4\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Date: Tue, 23 Sep 2003 03:49:36 -0000\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   From: &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Subject: Re: Celeron--Salvge\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;StarStorm::\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Starstorm looked all things that had happned , she hid herself \nand \n&gt; &gt;&gt;waited thinking what she will do next? what sould be the best to \ndo\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bob The  Builder&quot; \n&lt;rm2kmidi@l...&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; After an hour or so; Celeron had dug out the pod.

He \npulled \n&gt; &gt;&gt;the lid open and saw a pair of eyes looking back at him.  \nMalicous \n&gt; &gt;&gt;looking eyes.  He slammed the lid shut an locked it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; He brushed off the side of the pod and found that this was one \nof \n&gt; &gt;&gt;the prisioners from the ship.

It was a boring night, he \nhad \n&gt; &gt;&gt;solved all their problems and now the captain had been having \nhim \n&gt; &gt;&gt;repair stuff.  Once his task was done, instead of getting \nanother, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;he quickly sneaked out.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;He half flew, half walked up to the top of the sandy hill \nwhich \n&gt; &gt;&gt;was right next to the ship.  Then he started a scan for anything \n&gt; &gt;&gt;interesting.  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Searching........some metal, some mice, a bug....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Somthing caught his attention.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;....ooooOOO  small pod.....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;It was quite a ways away so he had to hike about 13 minutes \nto \n&gt; &gt;&gt;another mountain about 10 clicks south.  When he arrived at the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;object he discovered that it was buryed about 80% of the way \ninto \n&gt; &gt;&gt;the sand.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Its buried.....time to get out the old shovel....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;(To be continued)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;____________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Get advanced SPAM filtering on Webmail or POP Mail ...
