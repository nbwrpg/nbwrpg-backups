I will not have AngelNemesis ruining my dream!&quot;\n\nHe turned to the three bots.\n\n&quot;As I said, I am Vulois. This is Embassy Mountain, where a peaceful \ngroup of bots negotiate with the others for peace, so that we may \nsave Cybertron from the vicious nebula that will strike soon. Come, I \nwill evaluate you. You must stick very close to me. Their are many \ntunnels in this mountain, and only one takes the right way. If you \nget off track you will wander this mountain forever. Now come.&quot;\n\nVulois went back inside, waiting for the bots to follow.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTrainers\n\nBlaze continued to work on Striker. She had chosen a cold-blooded \nkiller who had total loyalty to Prebon for his new persona. That&#39;s \nwhat The Trainers needed if they were to make a huge impact on this \nplanet. She had basically put in the new persona, and now she was \nreplacing his vital systems, because they had been mostly destroyed \nwhen he tried to shoot the chip. Soon they would have the greatest \nwarrior on this planet, and they would defeat everyone. Blaze laughed \nto herself, and continued working.\n\nIgntius stepped out of his CR Chamber, repaired from Striker&#39;s \nattack. He went down to the cargo area to meet Hammer and Bullet.\n\n&quot;So how&#39;s the BH2 coming along?&quot;\n\n&quot;Great! We&#39;re almost done, and when we are it will cause so much \ndestruction we will be unstoppable.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good, good. Prebon was saying that he wants Striker to where it when \nhe&#39;s done. We all have Tamron, so it would be good for Striler to \nhave back up firepower. He&#39;s going to be the greatest mercinairy \nwe&#39;ve ever had.&quot;\n\n&quot;Alright, fine. But give us a hand, would ya?&quot;\n\nIgnatius, Hammer and Bullet got to work on the BH2.\n\n\n"}}
