A cloaked jet, consisting of Vicyr \n&gt; and Slasys, was following it. In seconds, the jets cleared the \n&gt; distance to the CF and could now clearly scan the fighting bots \n&gt; through the ashes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All Alliance bots, this is new Alliance warrior Supernova.

Do not \n&gt; fire on us.&quot; He ends the transmission and then barks a short order to \n&gt; the Galactors. The bigger jet (Supernova and co) seperates and then \n&gt; forms again using only Flare and Scrap, leaving Supernova to land on \n&gt; the ground and continue toward the Cybertronian Fire on foot.\n&gt; \n&gt; The jets get into range of the CF, one of them firing two missiles at \n&gt; Astroblast and the other four heavy-plasma shots at him.
