He thought it odd\nthat the Ark had been worked on but nobody seemed to be around to protect\nthier work. The large bot called out to the repair crew. &quot;Is anybody there?&quot;\nhearing no immediate answer he worked his way forward. he opened his comm\nand called out again. &quot;You can come out now, I&#39;m a Max.....&quot; The bots call\nwas cut short as the ground opened up beneath his feat. He was to big to\nstop his fall by transforming. That would leave him stuck in the hole. He\ntried the next best thing. Necromancers wings spread from his back and he\ntook flight. he quickly flew out of the hole and landed at the edge of the\npit. He dropped to one knee and tried to stay low as possible to avoid any\nenemy fire. Unfortunately his size didn&#39;t make that an easy task.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: RYO D &lt;striderzero1@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, December 08, 2000 3:09 PM\nSubject: Re: Stop Dragon my heart around.\n\n\n&gt; 1.The Defenses are on and ?5 is on patrol so I don&#39;t think you would be\nable\n&gt; to get that close with your size before something or someone was on you.\n&gt; 2.
