He looked around the\n&gt; room, A\n&gt; &gt; dim light from the emergency flashers filled the room.

He\n&gt; opened a\n&gt; &gt; comm again, &quot;I&#39;d love to come out, but unfortunately the doors are\n&gt; stuck,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d apreciate it if you&#39;d send a rescue party.&quot; The bot hated being\n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; polite but he knew he had no choice, if he was rude there wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; be enough\n&gt; &gt; left of the base, or him, to capture.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vile growls as he recieves the comm from the bases commander before\n&gt; sending one of his own to the base.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vile: &quot;Rescue party? and run the risk of you self destructing your\n&gt; abse and killing some of my crew? I think not. We&#39;ll blast you out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vile smirks before both Mega cannons rotate and aim at where the\n&gt; Violator&#39;s computer had traced the comm from.
