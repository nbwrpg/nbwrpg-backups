Good luck, guys!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Element zoomed into the African plains, the grass bending as\nit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; passed,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and stopped 200 feet from the Cybertronian Fire. The brand new\nship\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beauty outside. It was mostly oval-shaped, with a flat bottom and\na\n&gt; &gt; flat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back where the engines were attached to it. There were weapons and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hatches on the outside. The weapons were (yan helped me out by\ntelling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what weapons are on the planet right now, so this is partly his\nwork\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; missile launchers, autoguns, and EMP cannons (I&#39;m not exactly sure\n&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those are, but they&#39;re there :). There were two big cannons on\neither\n&gt; &gt; &gt; side\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Element, which could fire very strong plasma shots at\nenemies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was also a small disk on the top that could target robots and\nshoot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concintrated sonic waves at them. It could also be switched to\ntransit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unbearebly loud beeps over the comm, which would stop attackers\nfrom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comminicating with each other (my little invention :). The ship\nwas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; designed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for fighting in space, so its weapons were powerful. Around the\nship,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 20 feet from the sides, was the shield, a thick wall of protective\n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cinder&#39;s heart was pounding as she watched the hatch open and her\n&gt; &gt; family\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exit through it. She was finally going to fight! She exited behind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else, and then took off at a run toward battle. Cinder reached\ninto\n&gt; &gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hip\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compartment, taking out a large pistol and firing it at the first\n&gt; &gt; enemy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she saw, which was Deamon Wolf. Out of the corner of her eyes, she\n&gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rubble running near her and aiming a missile launcher at Dark\nClaw. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pulled the trigger and a missile shot out, heading quickly toward\nits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; target. Aqua ran on the other side of Cinder. His spear gun was\naimed\n&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Flesh Ripper and several spears were flying out of it toward the\n&gt; &gt; meanie.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mist flew overhead, her charge launcher (it launches small\nexplosives,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ones Rattrap used) out. She aimed at Astroblast as she got\nwithin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; range,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; firing two charges at him. Mantle was flying beside her, his arms\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stretched\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out. Two missiles flew out of each arm, mentally guided by him\ntoward\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Menasor. Shadows passed over all the Eletors as missiles and\nlasers\n&gt; &gt; shot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cyndro flew out toward any attacking bots.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
