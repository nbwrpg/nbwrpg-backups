So far, he had ignored her and her suggestions. \nShe was beginning to feel greatly unneeded here. She went about the \nbase locking down the airvents and putting up the bionets on the \noutside of the shields to help slow down the plague if it came to the \nbase.  She grumbled under her breath while she reformatted the air \nregulators so they would not allow outside air inside the base but \nrecirculate the air through the main CircumFilters.  &quot;Why would such \na leader that I feel such great loyalty to just ignore someone who is \ntrying to help him destroy our enemies?&quot; under her breath.  Then an \nidea crept into her cybermind.  She smiled at the thought.  She could \nsneek out of this base, go to the maximal base. Surely she would \nencounter the plague. She would tell them she was seeking refuge from \nit and that she had not been infected. The maximals being so \ngullable, they would let her in and she would then infect the entire \nbase of maximals with the plague. She grinned more evilly at this \nthought.  She would die, but then, the maximals would be wiped out \nand she would finally accomplish her one life&#39;s goal, and wipe out \nthe maximals. She wrote a note to Hydras outlining her plan. \n\n\n"}}
