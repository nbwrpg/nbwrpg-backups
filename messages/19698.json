The sky was the brightest blue she had ever \nseen. The air carried so many different scents and smells. She moved \naround in beast mode and tested her new body.  She loped around the \nclearing and felt her new paws on the grass. It was like she had just \nbeen born again. She spread her wings. She lifts off the ground a few \nfeets and feels the wind under her wings. She knew that it felt like \nto fly, or thought she did. It was like she was just set free. No \ncares or worries, she felt free.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Veratis wanted to keep her inside until she sniffed him. He knew \nthat \n&gt; newly formed protoforms tended to have a feral aspect about them. \nIt \n&gt; was to his advantage to let her out and see what she was capable \n&gt; of. &quot;Alright, you can go out but stay close I don&#39;t want you having \n&gt; any problems with your new form.&quot; he led her to the door and let \nher \n&gt; out. It was later in the day than he was used to. He needed some \n&gt; rest. he couldn&#39;t rest though, not with Shadow Wing still \nadjusting. \n&gt; He had to be awake in case anything happened to her.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
