The average BW bot is slightly less than \nhalf that, from what I know.\n\nGatara laughs.  &quot;You know as well as I do that Phoenix is no \nPredacon.  However, since you seem so ... concerned for her welfare, \nI will consider your offer.  What means, if any, do you have of \ntransporting these supplies of yours?

He holds a plasma rifle, not pointed at \n&gt; anyone, so it&#39;s not threatening, but the barrel is closer to Gatara \n&gt; than any other Rouge.  He stares at her with contempt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Flicker:  We Predicons have a reputation of backstabbing, her sense \n&gt; of loyalty is something few of us have.  I intend to show her I \nhave \n&gt; learned at least a little loyalty from her.\n&gt; \n&gt; His voice remains calm, but a tear comes to his eye where it is \n&gt; plainly visable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Flicker:  Now tell me.....what are your terms?\n\n\n"}}
