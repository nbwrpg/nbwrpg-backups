But first of all,&quot; he says, studying \nSkulletron carefully, &quot;The computers report that you have the power to tamper \nwith the emotions of other bots, is that true?&quot;\n\nZardus waits for Skulletron&#39;s answer, noticing Bloodystrike nodding in the \nbackground. If it was true, Skulletron would be able to complete his part of \nthe mission. Zardus had no doubt in Feline&#39;s capability, now he just had to \nmake sure of Skulletron&#39;s.\n\n"}}
