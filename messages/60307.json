Then he set up the energy field.  It was a lesser\nversion of the base energy shield.  He was a bit worried here, because\nhe wasn&#39;t sure if a vork could pass through it or not, though it\nblocked other forms of energy such as laser beams and directed energy\nweapons so theoretically it could prevent an energy being such as a\nvork from passing through.  He injected her with an antidote to the\ntranquilizer and rapidly switched on the energy field.  A blue glow\nformed around the table. \n\nHe waited silently for her to wake.\n\n\n"}}
