There, she thought of \nCarnatron and his last transmission. She wondered what he could do \nfor her to eliminate the maximals. But yet, her loyalty was to \nHyrdas. And for that, she could not go against anything he said.\n\nyet, her thoughts returned to SharpClaw. Why had he done this and why \ndid he think he had to do this? This isn&#39;t like a Predacon to safe \nanother from self destruction? maybe he&#39;s a maximal in disguise, she \nthought. Her optics shined with hate towards him. \n\n\n"}}
