I will accept that absorbing thing however as for using\n&gt; it to better herself I will ignore that since that entire energy\n&gt; absorbing and bettering thing is not listed anywhere in\n&gt; Blacknightmares bio. Which I just looked at, and if it suddenly\n&gt; &quot;appeared&quot; there I would be very suspicious of it. Also note that\n&gt; energy from sparks doesnt act like normal energy. Since Blacknightmare\n&gt; isnt a creation of the Bamphomet and the energy is specifically\n&gt; created to be used solely by those he creates it would have a very bad\n&gt; negative effect on blacknightmare if she absorbed it and/or tried to\n&gt; use it to improve anything.
