You are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; strong. However, being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a Clansman... err... Clansbot in your case, that\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more than \n&gt; &gt; &gt; techniques. It is a lot of training, and\n&gt; probably a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; major change of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; minds. We Clans value zellbringen, single\n&gt; combat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even in a melee, we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tend to engage no more than one enemy at the\n&gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, honor is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; above everything else in every aspect of our\n&gt; life...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; except maybe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; politics, but that is easily answered through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; combat.

You do have\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wolf&#39;s soul and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bear&#39;s strenght.
