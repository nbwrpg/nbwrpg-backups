He found himself doing it more \nwhen he was nervous or bored. It was becoming a habit now. He \ngrumbled to himself as he went down. He wasn&#39;t happy with Hell Beast \naround. He wasn&#39;t going to calm down until something was done about \nhim. He didn&#39;t get why he was here. He claimed that he was leader of \nthe Predacons, but he had that all wrong. Black Arachnia was.\n\nHe forced himself to stop pacing and went to find Tarantulas, his old \npartner. &quot;Hey T,&quot; he called. He sighed while looking for him. &quot;Ah \ndon&#39;t get it.&quot; he said low, hardly loud enough to be heard.\n\n\n"}}
