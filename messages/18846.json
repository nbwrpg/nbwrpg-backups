Hknew that something was wrong \nhere. Why had they not been destroyed. Could it be that somehow the autobots \nsurvived or maybe it was all a trick. All he could do was wait. He turned to \nsee three mettalic horsemen arrive. They must be those preds he had heard \nabout. But where was the fourth? Then he turned to see two destrons arrive. \nAnd he could see some following them. This was not enough however he knew. Hw \nwas sure the maximals would have to send someone to help. It was their life&#39;s \non the line.\n\n"}}
