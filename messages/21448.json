It didn&#39;t \nsuit his needs. He missed the buildings and life of Cybertron. The \nplanet was organic, and it confused him. How could a robot survive \nhere? He followed the edge of a forest, dirt on his heavy shoulders, \nknees and forearms. \n\nThe clone growled at this. How as he going to get out of this?\n\nHe froze. He stood by a tree, half of his body hidden as he saw a \ngroup of bots walking. They were Predacon. Inside he was surprised, \nbut he wasn&#39;t much of an expressional bot. He bared his teeth some, \nstudying them. He took a step forward. They had to be prisioners here \ntoo. He needed to get to them, but he hesitated. He knew when other \nbots saw him, it was fear.\n\n\n"}}
