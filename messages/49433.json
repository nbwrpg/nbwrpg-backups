Still \nwe can also believe that the guns are somehow linked to the bot \nholding them so as long as the bot has energon in him the weapon can \nbe fired.  Maybe theirs a panel to absorb it on the trigger?.....oh \nno I just started a new argument over energon consumption, I just \nknow it.....don&#39;t look at me I had Sunhawk eat once.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Dewboy, this RPG wouldnt get amde into a cartoon. So much \ncontinuity has been \n&gt; disrupted it would be hated by most of the fans and likely \ncanceled. And ins \n&gt; tarwars if you didnt notice they werent firing 40 shots every five \nseconds \n&gt; they fire small amounts of shots at a time and even then they \nwerent firing \n&gt; at everyone that fired at them at the same time. Dewboy ammo limits \nshould eb \n&gt; played I know some of the council members agree with this but when \nor if they \n&gt; will do anything has yet to be seen. Also dewboy you seem to be the \nonly \n&gt; person whining about why we shouldnt have them. I snapped at \ncardhead which  \n&gt; I apologized for mainly because of your lack of logic in this \nentire matter. \n&gt; And more than likely people will see 40 shots being fired sicne \nmsot of the \n&gt; time in this RPG there is a battle and half of the battles seem to \nhave \n&gt; moderish actions taking place. When I first joined I really thought \nthe RPG \n&gt; was a joke, so I decided to cash in and see how far I could \npossibly go with \n&gt; direct powerful tings that could add to the story but also further \nmy \n&gt; somewhat sadistic motivations. We saw where that all lead to(Can I \nget a \n&gt; hellpeon please? What about a fury cannon? Any bases need blowing \nup? Whee). \n&gt; Now we have a chance to actually make the RPG better but all you \nseem to be \n&gt; wanting to do is make it worse by ignoring certain logical things \nsuch as \n&gt; ammo. In most games you have a limit to what you can do. In RPGs \nyou&#39;ll have \n&gt; MP, in Resident Evil type games you&#39;ll have ammo, in first person \nshooters, \n&gt; ammo again, in some games like contra, you have certain amounts of \ntime or \n&gt; bullets of a ifferent weapon. All of these things have one \nparticular trait, \n&gt; there is always a limit.\n\n\n"}}
