He laughed, stumbling back as a third shot hits him in the chest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Oblitercon growled, transforming into his HUMVEE mode and driving at\n&gt; &gt; Necromancer, firing.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Koj&#39;s shot hit the outside of Pyro&#39;s cannon, leaving a dent in it. The\n&gt; &gt; Alliance member yelled in rage, scorching the forest while trying to hit\n&gt; Koj\n&gt; &gt; with his flames.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Scavanger yelled as a blade went halfway through his cannon. He jumped\n&gt; back,\n&gt; &gt; transforming into bot mode and landing a few feet from the Maximal femm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Taking a rocket launcher out of subspace, the bot fired it at Tavatron,\n&gt; &gt; aiming for her feet.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Dark One and Firearm hovered a few dozen feet away from each other, both\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; them having their weapons ready. The Alliance bot watched his opponent\n&gt; &gt; carefully, waiting for him to make the first mode.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Firearm growled, his weapons ready as well. He glanced quickly at the\n&gt; ground,\n&gt; &gt; seeing the seperate scirmishes beneath.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;How about a deal?&quot; Firearm said, loudly enough for Dark One to hear. It\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; obvious to him that this bot had some authority, and he could see a way\nto\n&gt; &gt; limit the bloodshed, &quot;We fight right now. Just me and you. If I win, you\n&gt; &gt; leave these Maximals alone, if you win, we&#39;ll leave.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dark One considered the offer carefully, looking over the bigger bot in\n&gt; front\n&gt; &gt; of him. He was positive that he could take him. He had, after all, taken\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; much bigger bots before. &quot;Agreed.&quot; he said, activating his comm as he\n&gt; nods,\n&gt; &gt; sending a transmission to all the Oblitercons.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hold your fire,&quot; the transmission read, &quot;Me and the Maximal commander\n&gt; here,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; he figured Firearm was the highest ranking Maximal, since he was the one\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; offered the duel, &quot;Are going to fight one on one. Untill then, there\nwill\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; no further fighting, understood?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He looked back at Firearm, nodding. &quot;I&#39;m ready, Maximal.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Firearm grinned. &quot;Maximals,&quot; he said into his comm, &quot;I&#39;m gonna take\ntheir\n&gt; &gt; leader on a one-on-one. Whoever wins will be the winning faction of this\n&gt; &gt; battle. It&#39;ll help limit the bloodshed. Hold your fire untill then,\nguys.\n&gt; &gt; This&#39;ll be over shortly.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Firearm turned back to Dark One, his sword ready. &quot;Well, shall we?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dark One laughed, firing a plasma rifle into the Maximal&#39;s chest. The\ntwo\n&gt; &gt; bots flew toward each other, their swords clashing when they met...\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; The Oblitercons stopped firing as they got the transmision, holding\ntheir\n&gt; &gt; fire. Each one looked at their Maximal opponent, ready to fight in case\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Maximals didn&#39;t follow the agreement.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Proto&#39;s eyes widened as he recieved Firearm&#39;s transmission, the Maximal\n&gt; &gt; flying back a bit to give the two enemies space for battles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He hoped that Firearm knew what he was doing, a dead Maximal was not the\n&gt; &gt; greatest thing in the world to get out of this mission.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Prowl recieved Firearm&#39;s orders as he flew into the battle, frowning as\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; computer reports the message to him. A duel?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prowl shook his head, hovering in the air a few dozen feet behind the\ntwo\n&gt; &gt; duelers. He wouldn&#39;t have trusted the Alliance with a one on one duel,\nbut\n&gt; &gt; perhaps it was possible...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prowl glanced at the ground, hoping that the Maximals would hold their\n&gt; fire.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
