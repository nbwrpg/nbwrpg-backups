Mech fluid flowed \nfrom the wound. Quickstrike and Senesis were gone. :::\n\n::: pheniox barged into the room ::: What happened? I heard an explosion!\n\n::: Black Aracnia glanced at her ::: No, no. I just tried to kill \nQuickstrike. Senesis rescued him though.\n\n::: Pheniox ::: Get that shoulder fixed. Hell Beast said he was on his way \nhome.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: The last battle driod exploded as Set and Ra exchanged fire with Hell \nBeast, Megatron, Jackle, Gremlin, Transanulas, and Marine :::\n\n::: Set ::: Damn it! We cant fight them, they out number us,....\n\n::: Ra ::: Master...you under estimate me.\n\n::: His hands glowed a cosmic blue, and he shot forth a blue blaze that \nenglufed a nearby tree, sending it tumbling down and scattering the Predacons \n:::\n\n::: Set laughed ::: Good...now we can pick them off...\n\n::: Ra continued to level the forest :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Keep firing, they will die here and now!\n\n::: Jackle and Gremlin nodded. Marine stood behinde Hell Beast while \nTransanulas and Megatron were seperated :::\n\n::: Hell Beast looked at the giant turtle bot agian ::: General?\n\n::: Marine ::: Yes, and I wish only to serve you commander. \n\n::: Hell Beast ::: o....k\n\n::: Marine ::: now, if Jackle and Gremlin work there way behinde Set and Ra, \nwe can attack from all sides.\n\n::: Hell Beast looks to the two Predacons ::: You heard him, do it!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron looks to the spider, and then to his broken leg ::: \n\n::: Transanulas gave his classic chuckle ::: Oh Megatron, you were always a \nfool.\n\n::: Megatron ::: Shut up, scheming tarantula! I killed your original...and \nIll kill you too!\n\n::: Transanulas ::: I have better things to do.\n\n::: He poked up and shot Set, sending him sprawling to the fern covered floor \n:::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Ra saw Set fall, and then Gremlin and Jackle assulted him from behinde. \nHe fell like a rag doll. Marine and Hell Beast rushed over to view the \ndamage. Transanulas walked in front of the limping Megatron :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Ah! Set, you are a weak leader indeed.\n\n::: Megatron ::: A wise tyrant would have stay-\n\n::: Suddenly, they realized Ares was firing at them. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Damn, retreat. We will get them agian.\n\n::: The small team retreated and arrived at the Base. Pheniox and Balck \nAracnia were egar to greet them :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Hell Beast, through the remaining CR chamber and now fully healed sat in \nhis command chair :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Ah, truly this was a fateful week.\n\n::: Transanulas, who was being watched closely ::: Yes, and I for one am glad \nit is done with! In a matter of time these new comers will be gone.\n\n::: Megatron ::: Yes. But we will work together. For now, the Predacons are \nthe lesser of two evils...\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: No matter. We will win, the new comers and the Maximals \nwill be no more. Pheniox, contact Zardus. I belive a meet between me, him, \nand Megatron is in order.\n\n::: Megatron ::: And contact shredder.
