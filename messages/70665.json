Oh, um by the way, maybe you should thank Tucson=\r\n for helping you.

Rodimus, we&#39;ve been through a great ordeal, but I promise you t=\r\nhat no harm to you will go un noticed.  That hive has caused nothing but st=\r\nrife for all of us, and I will not tolerate that happening again.  So here =\r\nis where we stand..  We have two enemies to vanquish.  Yet in order to stop=\r\n one, we must stop the other.  We need to know everything there is about th=\r\nose insectoids, and find out their weaknesses, and subdue them.  Then, we w=\r\nill deal with what comes afterwards.
