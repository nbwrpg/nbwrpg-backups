Finally, he got some rest\nand healed up.  He decided to go to the weapon storage to get some new\nweapons.  He looked at the weapons, and tried to decide which ones to take.\n He found a plasma rifle which looked in good shape, and he also took a\npistol.  He felt ready now.  But, he missed his state-of-the-art laser\nsword.  Oh well, he was fine with what he had now, a plasma rifle, a\npistol, optic lasers and metallicarpal mini-missiles.  (Fact: Our finger\nbones are called Metacarpal bones so for bots I made up Metallicarpals. \nAlso, Hakibuscon can fire 4 of his mini-missiles because they only do half\nas much as normal missiles) \n\n\tHakibuscon called Blackarachnia through his commlink, &quot;Predacon leader, I\nam requesting permission from you to go on a stealth mission at the\nAlliance base.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
