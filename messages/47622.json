Though I\nwouldn&#39;t say it was &quot;perfect&quot;, there has been a few times when the scale has\nbeen thrown off a bit (usually when cheetor or rat trap was caught in one of\nthe spiders energy webs).\n\nIn any case using BW scaling standards they basically did shrink the\ngeneration into pint sized versions of their ancestors.

So yeah, I&#39;d say they were all at\nleast 7\n&gt; or so feet.  The Decepticon cassettes, at least Rumble and Frenzy, seemed\nto\n&gt; be about 7 or 8 feet.  There was a scene in G1 where Rumble and Spike were\n&gt; fighting and Rumble was only a few feet taller than him.  Then again in\nthat\n&gt; episode Spike punched Rumble down for the count and didn&#39;t even hurt his\nhand\n&gt; against that Cybertronian alloy :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
