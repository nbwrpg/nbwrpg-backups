The two of them point \n&gt; and shoot ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Pumpskin seems to be quite settled down now, except for his tendency \n&gt; to consider everything in life to be a joke.  &quot;Why not?&quot; he \n&gt; sniggers.  &quot;After all, someone seems to be in trouble over there.&quot;  \n&gt; He points at Ragnar, who&#39;s about to get zapped.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Being down on his back, Ragnar takes the kick and starts rolling \n&gt; away \n&gt; &gt; on his side when he sees the gun&#39;s muzzle bearing down on him. He \n&gt; &gt; stops just after he avoided the shots, but his arm hurt and he \n&gt; tries \n&gt; &gt; to stand up. Also, with the venom in him, he starts to see in a \n&gt; &gt; blurred way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ragnar: Kup, Rodimus, Windlord, anyone... I am going down.
