She \ngreatly preferred the greenery of the forest to the small yet too often \nencountered dry patches.\n\nTavatron thought about Dinobot&#39;s comment for a moment, unsure of how to \nreply. *Mud puddles? She had no fondness for water much less mud.* Tavatron \nrasied an eyeridge at Dinobot, not sure of what he meant:\n\n&quot;If you are implying that I like mud then you are mistaken. I have no such \nfondness for the substance.&quot; Tavatron turned back towards the ark, then it \nhit her. He was insulting her! Tavatron thought back to an old earth saying \nabout a pig&#39;s eating habits. So, she ate like a pig. Tavatron grinned at \nDinobot and playfully snapped at him. She had taken no real offense but she \nwasn&#39;t about to let him know that:\n\n&quot;So, I have the eating habits of a pig? Well, I&#39;d rather eat like a pig than \nlook like one!&quot; Tavatron meant no disrespect, but knew better than to linger \nin one spot for too long if Dinobot took it as such. Tavatron widened her \nstride and picked up her pace as the ark began to loom in the distance. She \ntook a quick look over her shoulder at Dinobot, unsure of how the transmetal \nveloceraptor had reacted to her comment and sudden burst of speed.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
