Red like th=\r\ne landscape it flew from, it rose into \n&gt;  the air. Then with a smooth twis=\r\nt of hue it turned black as the \n&gt;  shadows of space enveloped it. Like som=\r\ne black fog hunter-\n&gt;  terminators, or sweeps as some call them, along with=\r\n their leader \n&gt;  Scourge, gathered themselves under the direction of the m=\r\nighty \n&gt;  Cyclonus. Then with lightening swiftness boosters flared turning =\r\nthe \n&gt;  surface of the moon crimson for the briefest of moments before they=\r\n \n&gt;  struck out across open space, moving with precision and ease toward \n&gt;=\r\n  the unsuspecting inhabitants of the earth. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Inside the pacifist Ma=\r\nximal base in Atlantis the computers continued \n&gt;  to monitor the grounds, =\r\nprimarily attempting to keep track of the \n&gt;  fleeing Trelos. But as always=\r\n a few cones were pointed skyward, \n&gt;  always on the look out for Minions. =\r\nWhat they saw today the computers \n&gt;  had no way to understand. Something t=\r\nhat was there and yet not there. \n&gt;  The slightest bit of distortion, that =\r\nunder normal circumstances \n&gt;  would have been ignored, but in this case wa=\r\ns large, and worse yet, \n&gt;  it was moving. (OOC: Think of Predator&#39;s invisi=\r\nbility when he moved) \n&gt;  \n&gt;  A yellow warning light began to go off in the=\r\n pacifist command \n&gt;  center, as the computer screen automatically projecte=\r\nd course and \n&gt;  heading. Approximated heading: Atlantis. Unfortunately no =\r\none was \n&gt;  there to notice.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  On the grounds of Atlantis the pursuit =\r\nof Trelos continues as several \n&gt;  Maximals attempt to retrieve the rather =\r\nelusive Predacon from his \n&gt;  newest hiding spot, underwater. One boat is o=\r\nn the water obviously \n&gt;  searching, while a floating car hovers over the w=\r\naters doing its own \n&gt;  search. Meanwhile Rodimus has noted a rather odd do=\r\nt in the skies, \n&gt;  one that he can see to be a Predacon eagle. He is point=\r\ning at it. And \n&gt;  even as he is doing this he notes something strange comi=\r\nng from \n&gt;  behind the eagle. The sky for a moment seems to flash and rippl=\r\ne, \n&gt;  almost like lightning, and yet there is a slight rotation to the \n&gt; =\r\n flashes. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  In the skies above the eagle looks down noting Rodimus po=\r\ninting at \n&gt;  him, and he begins to drop out of the skies moving out over o=\r\npen \n&gt;  water, preparing either to flee, or do a strafing run. In either ca=\r\nse \n&gt;  he is totally unaware of what is transpiring over his head.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  O=\r\nn the grounds below Rodimus can see what is coming as his enhanced \n&gt;  visi=\r\non sees two very tiny dots spiraling out from the rippling \n&gt;  flashes. At =\r\nthe same time Klaxons begin to go off as base computers \n&gt;  do actually rec=\r\nognize this threat: MISSILES!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Erupting out of the skies, twin missil=\r\nes streak across the skies, \n&gt;  vortexes of flames spiraling after them lik=\r\ne crimson, cone shaped \n&gt;  contrails. They slam into communication towers, =\r\nand the towers as \n&gt;  well as a few outlying buildings burst into flames. \n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt;  In the background, almost unnoticed, a Myrmidon spirals out of the \n=\r\n&gt;  skies, the recipient of several laser blasts. Small gouts of flames \n&gt;  =\r\nflowing from him even as he impacts the water. Myrmidon sinks beneath \n&gt;  t=\r\nhe waves.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  And flying from amidst this bombardment Cyclonus rises hig=\r\nh into the \n&gt;  air.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &quot;The days you have known are over. All that you =\r\nhave belongs to us! \n&gt;  Resist and be destroyed!! THE MINIONS OF UNICRON HA=\r\nVE COME!&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Even Cyclonus spoke sweeps arrive seeming to almost darken=\r\n the skies \n&gt;  for a momsnt, disintegrator blasts providing bright flashes =\r\nof light \n&gt;  as they bath Atlantis and the Maximal base in war.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  - - =\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n&gt;  \n&gt;  OOC: I am sure other Max=\r\nimal and Predacon bases/HQ&#39;s will note \n&gt;  something similar to what the Ma=\r\nximal base in Atlantis noted, feel \n&gt;  free for anyone to jump in, if it ma=\r\nkes sense. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  The only thing of note is that the Sweeps and Scourge ca=\r\nnnot be \n&gt;  locked on to with sensors (check out their profiles on wiki). T=\r\nhat \n&gt;  should not affect most of you very much, since most of you shoot by=\r\n \n&gt;  sight anyways, unless you are using base sensors or some remote \n&gt;  se=\r\nnsing capability. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Also any Minions that chose to come with are in t=\r\nhis group as well.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;      \n&gt;                                \n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n__________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired=\r\n of spam?
