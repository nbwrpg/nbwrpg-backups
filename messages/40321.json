Grounded knew he had to do something so he \n&gt; bent to the ground, placing his hand on it.  His arm began to pulse \n&gt; with a green hue.  Vines began to grow out from the ground around \n&gt; the base, covering the walls in a organic shield 6 feet thick.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seekker flew through the air trying to grab onto the ice head&#39;s \nface.\n\nAnd as seeker flew towards it the left head curled and moved over to \nthe left some more making him fly up a head.

At the same time the right head launched a continous stream of \nfire at the Organic shield.\n\nElsewhere Vampiza finally arrived on the scene of the masive Chitron \nbattle. His eyes immediately focused on Hotrod who he decided to \nattack first. His eyes began to glow as he send a ball of Chaochitan \nenergy at Hotrod, however this ball was from a lower level Infecticon \nand thus it did not have as much energy as the ones from Hellpeon.\n\n\n"}}
