He opened up a tight laser beam message \nheavily encrypted in an old type of comm. codes that Hell Beast had used when \nhe first landed on Past Earth.  Shockwave had gotten that information from an \nold member of Hell Beast&#39;s gang long ago.\n\nHe opened up a comm. transmission.  &quot;Unit Hell Beast, I wish to discuss terms \nof a union between you and my comrades.  I wish to speak in person, not from \nthe freezing cold to you in your base.&quot;\n\n"}}
