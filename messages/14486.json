Thanx.\n\n\n* Iron Raptor almost fell over in relief that this new bot wasn&#39;t here to \nannounce some attack on the Ark or some other heavy mission/problem she \nwould have to deal with.\nA smile crossed her lips as she stepped away from the scematic of the \nCybertronian Fire(and Prowl) and towards the new Maximal, actually glad to \nmeet Quake and how their force just grew a notch.\nThere were so many new bots coming to this world all the time, every new \nMaximal was more welcome then anything else.\nIron Raptor, however, wasn&#39;t quite as swamped with work as before and could \nactually afford this smile, the only other worry on her mind being that of \nthe Ark.*\n\n&quot; Hot Rod, huh? Well, he told you to come to the right fembot.&quot;\n\n* She held out her hand towards Quake, the smile on her face not wavering a \nbit.*\n\n&quot;Pleased to meet you, Quake. As you already know, my name&#39;s Iron \nRaptor...current Maximal Commander. And I would like to OFFICIALLY welcome \nyou to the Maximals as well as the Beast Wars.&quot;\n\n* But, just like Feline, she also wouldn&#39;t mind knowing just what sort of \nqualifacations this man had and how he could be of value to the Maximal \nforce (skills).\nIron Raptor qhickly looked him over, from top to bottom. Noting everything \nabout him that she could, and all that he hadn&#39;t told.*\n\n&quot; If you wouldn&#39;t mind, Quake? Could you please tell me a bit about \nyourself, skills and so on?&quot;\n\n* However, time was preciouse and she would have to make this a bit of a \nshort introduction, knowing that she had much important things to deal with. \nThe Ark, for one.\nThough, already she was thinking of the just where she could send Quake to \nkeep him busy, a job that didn&#39;t require too much if everything went right.\nProtecting the Ark. He would go out with the repair and protection team she \nsent before she left for the Embassy.\nThough, Kluster&#39;s news of the Ark cave in was none too assuring.*\n\n&quot; You see, I like to know as much about ever individual Maximal as I can and \nI also like to hear them speak themselves instead of having to look over a \nfile every time. It makes them more familier with a few things and helps to \nbreak the ice.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
