She had never known any \nbot to enjoy pain like these two did. She sighed and thought about \nhow to curb their appitite for pain.  She looked towards the \nlab. &quot;Stay there and don&#39;t go anywhere,&quot; she said to Land Mine and \nTime Bomb.  She went to the lab and looked around.  She found an old \ntorture box. She smiled, &quot;This aught to do it. The old Pain Box.&quot;  It \nwas a box big enough to put a bot in.  It had electrodes that \nprotruded inward n the box.

She \ncarried it out and gave it to Time Bomb. &quot;Here, go plug this in in \nyour room and have fun.&quot;  Fun wasn&#39;t what she would call it, but it \nmight keep them happy for a while.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Time Bomb ran off and told Land Mine.
