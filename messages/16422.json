The \nmachine was going haywire!\n\n&quot;It seems you&#39;re beyond this technology,&quot; he remarks, whatever else he wanted \nto say being drowned out by a transmission and a beeping from his wrist comp.\n\n&quot;Very well&quot; he says, walking out of the lab and motioning for Sickle to \nfollow him, &quot;Meet me at the bridge.&quot;\n\nZardus enters the bridge, tapping a few keys to bring up a reading on the \nstrange probe in Alliance territory. He activates his comm-link again, this \ntime to Dark One.\n\n&quot;Dark One, what&#39;s your location?&quot; he says into the device.\n\n&quot;Flying toward base. I have a new recruit that you might want to reprogramm,&quot; \nDark One replies. His comm system was only heard in his head, and didn&#39;t \nreach his cockpit, or its occupant.\n\n&quot;Allright, can you send Pyro or Breakdown to a probe that has been picked up \nin the area? I&#39;ll send you the coordinates,&quot; Zardus says, terminating the \ntransmission after sending the coordinates.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRecieving a new order from Dark One, Breakdown turns around, driving off \ntoward the probe.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica&#39;s shuttle lands some hundred yards away from where the strange \ncraft had crashed (Deamon Wulf), the Alliance bot walking slowly toward the \nmountain.\n\nHe was ready for an attack, but hoped that none would come.\n\n"}}
