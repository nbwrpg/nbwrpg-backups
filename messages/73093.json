Attempting a quick communications burst and finding it still\n&gt; jammed, he still let out a sigh fo relief from his air vents.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Me Wheelie find you Grimlock not of sound mind.  And so me Wheelie say me\n&gt; glad you Grimlock back this way.  Wheelie hopes that you function better\n&gt; this day.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE glanced over, &quot;Now can someone tell me what is going on, for things\n&gt; seem to be moving quite very wrong.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nGRIMLOCK paused again, his optics flickering still between the\ndarkness they had before and their typical hue. However this time he\nappears to be winning this battle. He looked at WHEELIE, &quot;Me Grimlock\ndon&#39;t know.&quot; He said. &quot;Grimlock just know he mad . . . mad all the\ntime.&quot;\n\nSLUDGE and SNARL had by this time caught up as well. &quot;What about the\nlittle Predacon.&quot; He said slowly as he too was fighting the same\nbattle as GRIMLOCK, but seemed to be more in control then before.\n\n&quot;Yes!&quot; SLAG cried out, &quot;There was one. He promisedus freedom! He\npromised us   power!&quot;\n\nGRIMLOCK shook his head, &quot;Me Grimlock don&#39;t care about power, but me\ndid want freedom!&quot;\n\nIt was at this point that SWOOP arrived followed by TERRANOTRON, both\nof them shifting to robot mode.\n\n&quot;Grimlock!&quot; SWOOP said. &quot;Please no hurt Swoop!&quot;\n\nGRIMLOCK looked at him and nodded, &quot;Fine, me no want to be mad at\nfriends anymore.&quot;\n\nIn the distance BACKSTOP was approaching, it would take him a few\nmoments to arrive.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
