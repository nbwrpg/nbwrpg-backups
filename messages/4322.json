And it was boring working by herself.\nShe climbed up to the lazar controls and stood next to Quickstrike.\n&quot;This button here activated the lazar.  Use the joystick to control the \nangel of the lazar.  This blue button will make tha lazar more consitrated \nand give you a finer and more pinpoint beam.  This orange buttom will widen \nthe beam for excavating the larger portions of the tunnel.&quot;\nShe was about to climb down when she turned and faced Quickstrike.\n&quot;Uhmm, Thanks for the help commander.&quot;\nShe climbed down and stood just off to the side of the lazar.\n&quot;Aim the beam for right there commander.&quot;\nShe pointed to the center of the back wall.\n\n----original message---------\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n\nQuickstrike:\n\n\nQuickstrike nodded to Dark Mouse. &quot;Sure thing.&quot; Sugar-bot almost slipped, \nbut he caught himself before it went past his voice. She wasn&#39;t sugar-bot  \nyet.\n\nHe looked at the drill, studing it. He moved closer to it. &quot;So, what do ah \nsupos&#39;d t&#39; do?&quot; Maybe it wasn&#39;t the best idea that he operate this machine, \nsince he wasn&#39;t the best when it came to heavy machinery. He honestly didn&#39;t \nhave the hands for it. But he wanted to do something.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
