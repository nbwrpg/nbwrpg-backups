Hearing his voice again did bring joy to her. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;as well as an ache.. an ache to be at the base, to be in hi arms. But, the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;reality was, she had a duty to do. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;&quot;I very much missed you,&quot; she purred. Her voice was rather soft. &quot;I awaited \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;for you to be repaired. Perceptor stated your damage was great &amp; that it would \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;take some time to repair the damaged areas. Then I was called away.&quot; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;She pondered a moment, as a sweet yet sly smile came upon her face, &quot;I was \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;never bored,&quot; she paused, &quot;Just lonely,&quot; she hated the idea of spilling her \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;emotions &amp; feeling them, but.. she let them this time. How she ached for him. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Then turning a little serious. &quot;I have Blackstorm. We are on a rendezvous \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;with some newly arrived Decepticons. We shall bring them back soon enough.&quot; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;MSN.
