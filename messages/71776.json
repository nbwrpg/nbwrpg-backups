I have a character in mind\nfor Hydras&#39; new second in command, or security officer - or however he\nwants to use him. I could play it myself, but I would much rather have\na player use the character rather than myself. Plus I would think it\nwould help Airly to have other players on his team. I have his team in\nplace but he is woefully short on other players.\n\nHe should be coming available very soon and I wanted to see if anyone\nout there wanted to take him on.\n\nTo give you a little in game history: he is a transmetal and a Mega\nsized character, one who was loyal to BW&#39;s Megatron and now Hydras,\nsince Hydras was once partly Megatron.\n\nIf you think you are interested please let me know on or off list.\nThis is open to anyone who feels they can keep up with posting at\nleast a few times a week and can handle being Hydras&#39; subordinate.\n\nFrom what I can see Hydras is a good commander and he doesn&#39;t bite . .\n. MUCH! :)\n\nCome one come all! :)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
