With the help of Myrmidon and Perc=\r\neptor Malice was\n&gt; repelled from the base. Megatron X showed up and said a =\r\nfew words.\n&gt; However just as quickly he left leaving us to our own devices.=\r\n (IE:\n&gt; These character&#39;s player stopped posting)\n&gt; \n&gt; While this was happe=\r\nning the Maximals chose this time to attack, I\n&gt; presume in an attempt to g=\r\nain back their captured members, but their\n&gt; attempt failed and in fact a m=\r\nember was captured: Windlord! And much\n&gt; like his predecessor Rodimus Prime=\r\n he too was corrupted becoming \nDarkhawk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, at a lull in the =\r\ncombat between the Maximals and the\n&gt; Pedicons  a huge host of sweeps began=\r\n attacking both Predicons and\n&gt; Maximals at Hydras&#39; base, wreaking much hav=\r\nok. \n&gt; \n&gt; meanwhile Rodimus was sent away on some secret mission and Scourg=\r\ne\n&gt; along with a few sweeps was sent by Cyclonus to track him down.\n&gt; Scour=\r\nge tracked Rodimus to an old Maximal base from many years ago.\n&gt; And despit=\r\ne his best efforts Rodimus eluded him. \n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile at the Ark, the mini=\r\nons Cyclonus had reconstructed \nattacked\n&gt; the Ark, they had managed to arr=\r\nive there before the Maximal \ndefenders\n&gt; who were sent there, due to the d=\r\nistraction of Nightrazor. \n&gt; \n&gt; The minions were about to attack when Legac=\r\ny, (who appears as a \nblack\n&gt; and red version of Shockblast) appeared seemi=\r\nngly from inside the \nark\n&gt; and began to defend it. He was able to single-h=\r\nandedly able to \ndefeat\n&gt; Deepstryke and Phobia, and held off the others un=\r\ntil help arrived in\n&gt; the form of Lord Elder and the other Maximal defender=\r\ns. \n&gt; \n&gt; It was revealed that Legacy was a temporal guardian and had been \n=\r\nsent\n&gt; back to correct a temporal irregularity that had formed. \n&gt; \n&gt; It wa=\r\ns then that Cyclonus and his host of sweeps arrived, and the\n&gt; Maximals and=\r\n the Predicons had come to an accord to work together to\n&gt; defeat this mini=\r\non menace. \n&gt; \n&gt; The battle that ensued was huge! Lord Elder, Legacy, Griml=\r\nock and \nthe\n&gt; other Maximal defenders held the Ark while Hydras and his cr=\r\new\n&gt; attacked from the rear. \n&gt; \n&gt; During the battle a black sphere appeare=\r\nd around the ark for a long\n&gt; while, inside a spark extractor unit flew att=\r\nacking the occupants\n&gt; inside, seeking to find a way into the ark. An inter=\r\nesting effect of\n&gt; this extractor is that at certain intervals it fired out=\r\nside the\n&gt; sphere, striking several of the minion lt&#39;s. \n&gt; \n&gt; However due t=\r\no the efforts of Legacy and Kup, this menace was\n&gt; ultimately warded off. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; BUT it was the battle between Cyclonus and Rodimus that turned the\n&gt; b=\r\nattle. At first it looked as if Cyclonus had the upper hand, but at\n&gt; the e=\r\nnd Rodimus fired some strange black optic blast that knocked\n&gt; Cyclonus out=\r\n, even as he too fell over. Strangely this attack seemed\n&gt; to effect Scourg=\r\ne, who left his post to come to his commander&#39;s\n&gt; defenses. However instead=\r\n of being thanked Scourge was hit by a\n&gt; similar blast from Cyclonus and Sc=\r\nourge also fell unconscious. \n&gt; \n&gt; Without any of the commanders to lead th=\r\nem the sweeps were quickly\n&gt; routed. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now the Predicons and Maximals a=\r\nre attempting to pick up the \nshattered\n&gt; pieces of thier battle, and make =\r\nthier own plans for the future. \n&gt; \n&gt; Interestingly, the Spark extractor th=\r\nat had attacked the ark has\n&gt; attacked Myrmidon, KOing him, so far his cond=\r\nition is unknown. The\n&gt; device is now attacking Hydras, as he attempts to g=\r\net his wounded\n&gt; forces about of there. \n&gt; \n&gt; And as a last note: Rodimus, =\r\nCyclonus and Scourge have been captured\n&gt; by Skorponok for unknown reasons.=\r\n Perceptor has tracked to to his \nlast\n&gt; dig site where he picked up the on=\r\nly two minions who appeared mobile\n&gt; from this battle: Darkfate and Nightst=\r\nrike.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
