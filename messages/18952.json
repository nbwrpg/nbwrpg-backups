She \nmanaged one word to come out clearly, the rest was \ngarbled. &quot;Lunarpine.....&quot;   She tried again, but the connection \nwasn&#39;t clear.  She felt a little disappointed in herself.  She wanted \nso much to try to talk through this form, but it wasn&#39;t going to \nhappen.  She reached up with the arm and touched Veratis. Through the \nconnection to the eyes, she could see Veratis, but only as a fuzzy \noutline of a bot.  Not a clear visual picture. She touched his arm, \nbut couldn&#39;t feel it.  She could see it a little, but still had no \nfeeling.  This form was not her&#39;s yet.  It was a controlled form, but \nnot connected to her. \n\n\n"}}
