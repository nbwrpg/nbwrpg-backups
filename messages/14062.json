The wound was near\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spark, but missed it by an inch.  She picked up GoldenEye and took\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her to the entrance of the cave.  She put her just inside the\n&gt; door of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the base, out of harms way.  &quot;Someone take her to the CR.

She took a few more hits in the shoulders and hip.  She\n&gt; &gt; &gt; groaned in pain, but continued to stand her ground.  This was her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; base and she wasn&#39;t giving up. She was leaking badly, but she\n&gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; care.
