I must&#39;ve ended up there so many times that I lost count=\r\n.  But it wasn&#39;t for stupid reasons, usually because of freak ambush attemp=\r\nts by Decepticon speedsters.  I sure hated those guys, I wasn&#39;t as fast as =\r\nthey were and they knew it.  So of course they&#39;d always chose me as their t=\r\narget.  Ratchet was aware of that, and he never got agitated when I came in=\r\n.  But what was worse, I&#39;d never hear the end of it from Sunstreaker and Si=\r\ndeswipe.

Now mind ya, they knew better not ta scrap around with him because he&#39;d=\r\n slag &#39;em real good if they did.

I sure hated those guys, I wasn&#39;t as fast as they were =\r\n\n      and they knew it.&nbsp; So of course they&#39;d always chose me as their=\r\n \n      target.&nbsp; Ratchet was aware of that, and he never got agitated =\r\nwhen I \n      came in.&nbsp; But what was worse, I&#39;d never hear the end of =\r\nit from \n      Sunstreaker and Sideswipe.&nbsp; Slag, those two were always=\r\n rank&#39;n on \n      me.&nbsp; But I tried ta ignore &#39;em.&nbsp; Then one day, =\r\nOhh this is \n      sweet, one day it happened again and I wound back up in =\r\nRatchet&#39;s office. \n      Tucson was mak&#39;n a delivery of supplies before he =\r\ngot shot blind, and \n      those two were pull&#39;n their scrap on me.&nbsp; W=\r\nell, not only did he hear \n      them, he saw them do&#39;n it and slag, you di=\r\ndn&#39;t wanna be around Tucson that \n      time, because he had the look of de=\r\nstruction in his eyes.&nbsp; Now mind \n      ya, they knew better not ta sc=\r\nrap around with him because he&#39;d slag &#39;em \n      real good if they did.&nbs=\r\np; All they had ta do was look into his optics \n      and they turned aroun=\r\nd and apologized ta me without a single word outa \n      Tucson&#39;s mouth.&nb=\r\nsp;

It kept the speedsters in line and guys like \n      u=\r\ns, Hound, Trail Breaker, and Beach Comber were happy not ta get ranked on \n=\r\n      because of our lack of speed.&nbsp; And definitely no one ever messed=\r\n with \n      Ratchet.&nbsp;
