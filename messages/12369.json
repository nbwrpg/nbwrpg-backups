But you have to take a solemn oath. You must \nalways use these powers for peace, and never for war.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Herald.\n\n&quot;Come. I will you the quick tour and then you may go. After that, I \nwill take Child to meet Windrazor, and train him. But before we go, I \nwould like to offer a permanent alliance between our groupes. This is \nnot a joining, just an alliance. If you need any help, you may always \ncount on us. We will always take you in. We have me, and Battera, and \nCybershark, and Windrzor, and The Peace Angels. So anytime you need \nhelp, we would all gladly give it to you. Now come, let&#39;s start the \ntour.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
