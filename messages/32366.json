I guess its time for me to\nreveal the project I&#39;ve been working on for the past long while.\n\nFor the past few weeks, I&#39;ve been making a login feature (I lost most\nof what I had when my comp crashed, but I&#39;m redoing it) for the site.\nThis login feature will include functions like being able to log in\nand edit your char profiles, create new chars and have them added\nquicker to the char list (they&#39;ll still have to be reviewed, but it&#39;ll\nbe easier and quicker to add them), a member chat room and message\nboard (I found some bugs in my message board, and am currently fixing\nthem), and the ability for faction commanders to edit their faction\nprofile, though that&#39;s a long shot. The final feature of this system\nis the ability to vote from the site.\n\nAnyways, the first scheduled vote will be a reelection of the council.\nThe details are still being made, but the general goal is to give\npower to the active players and stuff. I also want to have some help\nmaking rulings and stuff.\n\nThe people I&#39;ve discussed this too suggested the following. These are\nall up to the members in the end though, but here&#39;s what me and a few\npeople came up with:\n\n1. There will be council reelections periodically (how often is\nundecided. 1 month and 2 month periods have been suggested)\n2. Once elected (at least the first new council), the new council will\nreview all current rules, policies, and everything and adjust them if\nneccessary.\n3. The council will consist of either 3 or 5 people, and everything\nwill be decided by votes. Votes will last 24 hours, and if council\nmembers fail to vote within that span, the matter is closed and\nwhichever side won wins even if not all the council members have\nvoted.\n4. If any matter is brought up by a member and seconded by another\nmember, the council has to vote on it, unless its already been brought\nup before.\n\nI think there&#39;s it. Well, there&#39;s one more thing. Some of the people I\ntalked to suggested that I be a permenent part of the council (reasons\nare that I have the eGroups club thing, update the site, etc..), and I\ndon&#39;t know how the rest of y&#39;all would feel about this. This, along\nwith everything else, is up to you members.\n\nSo, everyone email me with your ideas. The more ideas I get, the\nbetter this idea can be.\n\n\nrAuq, can you print this message out and give it to Rdahl, and give me\nhis input? Thanx.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., nbwrpg@y... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Enter your vote today!
