He fired off \ntwo bolts from his laser pistol at Habiuskon.\n\n---\n\nOinker, tracking his fellow members, ran into the engine room, weapon \nready.  If he saved his comrades, Zardus would reward him nicely.\n\n&quot;Not so fast yuh Maxi.&quot; he fired off two bolts from his rifle at \nHabiskun&#39;s back.\n\n\n"}}
