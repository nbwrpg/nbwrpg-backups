He would\n&gt; either turn into his ant mode should it be required, or just fly using\n&gt; his booster. Either way he was ready to follow his master where ever\n&gt; he went.\n&gt;\n&gt; Iguanus on the other hand shifted into a Giant Transmetaled Frilled\n&gt; Lizard, he was large and well armored, but it was obvious that the\n&gt; fliers would easily out distance him on the trip if they didn&#39;t go\n&gt; slow enough so that he could keep up. &quot;I&#39;m ready sir.&quot; he said, ready\n&gt; to take on what ever mission that Hydras had for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile a call came in from Cyclonus, &quot;Sir. I have taken Bruticus-x\n&gt; and Insecticon with me to help track down Scourge. We have trailed him\n&gt; into the caves that the Maximals fled into, but so far the trail is\n&gt; still cold. I think there is something else down here besides us\n&gt; though.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
