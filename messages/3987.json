Iron Raptor was \ngoing to sacrifce herself but Prowl saved her. She wanted to calm \nObliteron down but now Liono Prime is going to fire on him. Octociz \nsees that and is now firing on Liono even though They are both \nMaximals. As for the TM3 thing, Vulois found a TM3 driver that was \ncreated when Cheetor sabotaged Megatron&#39;s TM2 device in the real \nBeast Wars. Now Vulois, Soundwave and mayve Ramjet are planning to \nuse it to start a new faction and win the Beast Wars.\n\n\n"}}
