He withdrew \nhis clash sword knowing he was going to get a fight out of this. He \nstepped up to the entrance, catching the door before it closed. He \npaused for a moment to make sure it was safe for him. He waited until \nhe thought the bots walked on into the base some more, then forced \nthe door back, and squeezed in as much of his large body could fit. \nHe held it with his foot, and fiddled with a panel on the side to \nmake it hang open halfway. He stepped inside, looking around. \n\n\n"}}
