One dang carride from school, and 3 F&#39;ing acidents to hold me up!\n&gt; Guess Friday the 13th is unlucky after all.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t like these moding accusations that are going on. Surge can eat\nrubber\n&gt; if he wants to (some bots can resist pain, as can some humans), and I\ndon&#39;t\n&gt; see how HotRod moded. So both of you stop accusing each other. This is an\nIC\n&gt; fight, not an OOC one. I will back neither up, in fact I will tell both of\n&gt; you to shut up. THe next one to accuse the other one of moding (whether\nover\n&gt; the RPG or complaining to me personally) gets moderated for the battle. I\nam\n&gt; not in a good mood, so don&#39;t try me.\n&gt;\n&gt; And quit threatening each other too.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/Bloodystrike/The Oblitercons/Havoc::\n&gt;\n&gt; Flying in closer to Deemos, Zardus continues firing his plasma launcher,\n&gt; firing at the bot&#39;s chest.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Seeing the battle between Surge and HotRod, Bloodystrike flies toward\nSurge,\n&gt; once again taking out his rifle.\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes carefull aim, firing two missiles at Surge&#39;s back.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Pyro laughs as bullets hit his armor, making a few dents and scratches,\nbut\n&gt; nothing major. He drives at Gigas, firing at him as he shoots fireballs at\n&gt; the bot.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Spinning in midair, Dark One manages to avoid most of the shots, a few\n&gt; hitting him as he continues flying toward Horn Drill and firing at him.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scavanger shakes as shots hit him, the Oblitertron transforming into robot\n&gt; mode and dodging some more bullets, returning fire with his rifle.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Breakdown continues to ride at Grenade, ignoring the shots hitting him as\nhe\n&gt; fires two more missiles, again at Grenade.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Hiss dives behind a tree, shots sailing over his head. The tree falls,\nnearly\n&gt; hitting Hiss as the Oblitercon returns fire, shooting at Shockaract.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &quot;Soon yes,&quot; Havoc replies to Demolition, diving out of the way of some\nshots.\n&gt; He pulls up, nearly hitting the ground as he sails over Shockaract&#39;s head,\n&gt; gropping a bomb on the bot, &quot;But not yet.
