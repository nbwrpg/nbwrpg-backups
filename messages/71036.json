Phobia and \nthe other sweeps fell in with the groups, leaving many of the more ground \nbased Predaons sitting in the shuttle that had picked them up.\n\n&quot;Sir&quot; Cyclonus said to Hydras as he flew along side him, &quot;do you have some \nwhere to go, some destination in mind for us?&quot; He asked curiously. &quot;With \nyour base destroyed we have no fall back position.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
