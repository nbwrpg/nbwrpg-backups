It ain&#39;t every day I save a stranger but, I saw something in him, someth=\r\ning different, and something not everyone could see.  He was sure worth the=\r\n risk, look where he is now, he&#39;s a leader, and yeah he&#39;s new ta the job bu=\r\nt, he still has that special something that ya don&#39;t see every day.&quot;\n\nStrai=\r\nght Shot turns to him with a smile and a heart felt hug.  Rattrap smiles as=\r\n he returns the hug.\n\n&quot; Know something Rattrap?  Looks like us rodents gott=\r\na stick together. &quot;\n\nHe nods.\n\n&quot; Definitely.  Since a certain feline seems =\r\nta be missing the big picture here, you&#39;re absolutely right.  I bet he&#39;d le=\r\narn a thing or two if he got a few quills stuck in his paws. &quot;\n\nStraight Sh=\r\not tries not to comment but listens.\n\n&quot; That would definitely get to the po=\r\nint but I dunno.  To me, solving differences happens when you ask to speak =\r\nto someone privately and try to come to a reasonable resolve.  But I sure d=\r\no dislike the fact that Leo has no personal relation skills.  I mean, serio=\r\nusly, if you want your comrades to respect you but, the leader has ta also =\r\nshow a little compassion if he&#39;s to be properly respected.  And that&#39;s what=\r\n&#39;s bothering me.  Is it that hard to be nice as well as authoritative ?  Tu=\r\ncson does that and more and he doesn&#39;t even try to. &quot;\n\nRattrap sighs.\n\n&quot; So=\r\nrta like what your pal Ratchet was like.  He had a temper but he gave it hi=\r\ns all ta save the lives of those who needed saving.  In fact, all those tim=\r\nes he put his life on the line for everyone, just like the old CMO would do=\r\n.  He&#39;s also got Ratchet&#39;s expressions..  You guys may be more connected ta=\r\n the old medic in more ways than one.  You too.  You got his heart and so d=\r\noes your brother.&quot;\n\nShe looks to him.\n\n&quot; Wait are you saying that Ratchet m=\r\night have been our- our dad?&quot;\n\nRattrap nods.\n\n&quot; Might be, I&#39;m sure we got p=\r\nlenty of intel on it.  I&#39;m sure Legacy will be able ta do a search for us b=\r\necause it is your right ta know.  He could&#39;ve been family and it&#39;s your rig=\r\nht ta find your roots.
