She opened the door and stepped out.  Something didn&#39;t make \nsence to her. If she just got out of the CR unit, then why&#39;d she feel \nso tired.  She looked around and transformed into griffin mode.  \nStanding on all fours, she stretched her wings. Her shoulder felt \ngreat, her wounds were nicely healed, but she had a few new scars to \nproudly wear.  She opened up her mind to Lunarpine. &quot;How are you \nfeeling? Have you had your turn in the CR yet?&quot; Then she remembered \nhis remark about her wieght. She smirked and chuckled to herself. \nShe thought to herself, I&#39;ll get him for that one, he&#39;ll never see it \ncoming. \n\nDespite it all, she cared for Lunarpine with all her spark. If she \nlet anything happen to him, she&#39;d rip her spark out and give it to \nVeratis on an energon platter.  It was her love for him that kept her \nalive while her spark sat in a jar in Veratis&#39; lab. And she wasn&#39;t \ngoing to give him up now.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
