I agree with that, he just wants to be known as the\none who saves the day, well I&#39;ve been here longer and I still haven&#39;t done\nanything as great as his charactrs, because I don&#39;t believe in moding to get\nit done! I wish that I wouldn&#39;t be outdone, but with moders like Trikejacob\nand Jason Lind, you can&#39;t be outdone? This RPG needs some censorship before\nlong it&#39;s getting so bad, and nothing will be done about it, because I&#39;ve\ntold everyone several times. Blabber I am? Well I get caught for moding by\naccident, like me bending back someone&#39;s wrists, yet he gets to do all of\nthis coooool stuff! Wow-O! I seriously dislike moders, Jason Lind, and if\nyou don&#39;t take damage for any of MY shots in the future, I will ignore your\nposts, just a fact I thought I would spread around...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, August 11, 2000 6:04 AM\nSubject: Top 10 reasons Jason shouldn&#39;t whine about the weapon\n\n\n&gt; 10 whys it matter, weapons don&#39;t harm his godlike characters anyway\n&gt;   9 Striker fired at his characters, nothing hit\n&gt;   8 Rhinox fired at his characters, nothing happened\n&gt;   7 Ramhorn fired on his characters nothing happened\n&gt;   6 Lunarpine fired at his characters nothing happened\n&gt;   5 Shadow Wing fired at his characters nothing happened\n&gt;    4 Spears fired at his characters nothing happened\n&gt;   3 The only characters that can harm his characters are his other\n&gt; characters.\n&gt;   2 Rush was repeatedly fired on by 4 bots and somehow still made it close\n&gt; enough to the Ark to grab Shadow Wing\n&gt;\n&gt;  And the number 1 reason that Jason shouldn&#39;t whine about the weapon\n&gt;\n&gt; Because Arcangel can always swoop down just on time to save the Ark and be\n&gt; enjoying a nice refreshing beverage at the Cybertronian Fire in his next\n&gt; post.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you say modeing?\n&gt; I knew you could.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Jason Lind &lt;icedemon101@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 10, 2000 5:30 AM\n&gt; Subject: (unknown)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I just like to point some stuff to everyone firing emps is crazy a emp\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; shut down all machine type stuff so who ever fires the emp will also be\n&gt; shut\n&gt; &gt; down]\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
