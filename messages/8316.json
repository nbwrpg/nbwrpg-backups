She could see the fire in his spark \nburning brightly.  She smiled and felt his hand run through her \nfeathers. &quot;Your right. You can see just fine. And I&#39;m fine. Shook up \na bit, but fine. Thank you.&quot;  \n\nShe transformed into bot mode and stood for a moment looking into his \neyes, his big, beautiful, golden wolf like eyes.  She shook her head \nas if trying to brake a spell he had put over her.\n\n&quot;I ah...that was a good move you made. Felling the tree like that. I \ndidn&#39;t expect that one at all. I&#39;ll have to be more careful next \ntime.&quot;  she smiled warmly at him and looked again into his eyes.  \nThey were almost hipnotic to her. She knew a wolf&#39;s stare was \nsupposed to be able to almost stare into the heart of a being, but \nhis stare surrounded her. She turned around and looked at the tree on \nthe ground. &quot;uh, OK, what do you want to teach me next? How to fight \nwith swords perhaps?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Are you alright?&quot;Lunarpine asked with more concern in his voice \nthan \n&gt; he&#39;d origionally intended.&quot;Are you able to fly?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He helped Shadow Wing to her feet (Talons) and checked her wing. \n&gt; Nothing appeared to be damaged beyond internal repair capabilities.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked in her great owl eyes and saw the beast she could&#39;ve been \n&gt; if she wasn&#39;t a transformer. A spark which seemed to be wanting \n&gt; completion. He kissed the top of her beak and brushed his hand \n&gt; through her soft downy feathers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately Lunarpine didn&#39;t know when to shut up.&quot;See I told you \n&gt; not to worry about my eyes.&quot; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
