Moving quickly he opened a hatch to the\ncrawl\n&gt; spaces, which weren&#39;t much for crawling since they usually were\nconstructed\n&gt; so a bot could stand upright within. Running along this his scanners\nlooked\n&gt; for a hatch leading outside. The &quot;leaders&quot; who owned this base weren&#39;t\ngoing\n&gt; to be too pleased that someone had slipped inside and tore the wiring from\n&gt; thier shield generator...for such comedic ranting Panthos wanted to be on\n&gt; the outside of the base and out of turret range...\n&gt;\n\n{Panthos}\n\n    Panthos turned another corner and smiled seeing the hatch approaching,\nas he moved towards it he became more cautious looking it over slowly. His\nchest plate opened revealing the compact version of his energy rifle,\nextracting it he began to fire on the hatches hinges and locking mechanism.\nHe didn&#39;t think this faction was completely full of morons and not have\nsealed the bases exits tight...no one was that dumb.\n\n    Sighing he set abut his task using the laser to slice through the metal\nwith each shot until it&#39;s energy was expended. He didn&#39;t expect it to\ncomplete the job, just weaken the structural integrity of the hatch.\nReplacing the weapon in his chest cavity he stepped back and lashed out with\na side kick, his foot/paw smacking hard on the door making it shudder\nslightly.\n\n    Shaking his head he moved back some more than ran at the hatch flinging\nhimself feet first at it, both feet connecting hard breaking the hatch from\nit&#39;s weakened surroundings. Peeking his head out he looked down the face of\nthe outside base and dug his claws in slowly scaling downwards towards the\nground far below. This was always a pain of infiltrating and causing\nhavoc...there was rarely a ground floor exit waiting for him...\n\n\n"}}
