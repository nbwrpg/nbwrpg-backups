There beings were hostile, and they were supposed to \nmingle with them? This was going to harder then they thought.\nBut both Biomass and Nue&#39;e relax as Perndabot removes the launched from it&#39;s \nlocation at Biomass&#39;s chest, sighing in relief.\nBiomass blinked as he listened to Perndabot introduce himself. His gaze \nshifted to the Iron Fist when he gestured to it.\nThis was the place they were going to stay? How.....wonderful.\nNue&#39;e took a few steps forward and looked even closer at the Iron Fist, her \nview blocked by Perndabot so she moved up and peeked around his body to see \nthe base.\nIt wasn&#39;t as nice looking as their ship but she was sure that they had a \nperfect lab.\nBiomass kept his eyes on Perndabot until he noticed Swift, looking down at \nher and waving a tenticle at her.*\n\n&quot; Hello.&quot;\n\n* But then Biomass looked back towards Perndabot.*\n\n&quot; Our ship just crashed here and you were the closest faction to us. I \ndecided to join you, if I can.&quot;\n\n&quot; Me too.&quot; *came the voice from Nue&#39;e as she looked straight up at Perndabot \nbefore stepping around him and looking at the Iron Fist.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
