It seemed \n&gt; &gt; kinda fair since JP got 5 Inferno clones in the past.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree that the lack of specification is getting really \n&gt; &gt; annoying. &quot;Firing at the enemy&quot; or &quot;Firing at some Alliance \nmembers&quot; \n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t good form. Also, &quot;Firing at all the Alliance members&quot; can \nimply \n&gt; &gt; that your character is spinning in circles and firing through \nwalls, \n&gt; &gt; so please be SPECIFIC!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, KSL has authorized my use of Unitron.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::The Oblitercons/Deamon Wulf/Dark Claw/Flesh Ripper/Six \n&gt; &gt; Shot/Ares/Manterror/Injector/BumbleBee/Double \n&gt; &gt; Punch/Unitron/Zardus/FZ/Perndabot::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dark One rolls in the air, dodging a few shots, several of them \n&gt; &gt; hitting him.

So next \n&gt; &gt; post on this should be hers.)\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; The arrow hits near Pyro, the Oblitercon ignoring the pain as he \naims \n&gt; &gt; his gun at KitKat on Dark One&#39;s orders and opens fire, sending a \nfew \n&gt; &gt; fireballs flying at her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A rocket hits near him, charring the side of him a bit.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; In HUMVEE mode, Scavenger drives toward Destructor and KitKat, \nfiring \n&gt; &gt; dozens of rapid laser shots at KitKat.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Transforming into his artillery cannon mode, Breakdown aims his \n&gt; &gt; weapons at KitKat, firing a few laser shots as well as a missile \nat \n&gt; &gt; the femm.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Hiss, in Robot mode, runs toward KitKat, firing at her from his \ngun.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Dark Claw growls as an arrow hits near him, not being affected by \nthe \n&gt; &gt; virus due to his advanced form.
