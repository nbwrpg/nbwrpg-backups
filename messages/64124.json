She was in a dark room with grey\nwalls. She obviously did not recognize the place. In fact she hardly\nremembered anything... except a burning mix of emotions towards\nsomeone... Azure. Where was he now?\n\nAs she stood up in a prone position, a door slid open and a tall\nrobot, with huge weapons in his back, entered without saying a word.\n\nBalistica: You&#39;re the one who had me repaired? Well, I guess I-\n\n???: You have three choices, Maximal. (He turned to face her) You see,\nwe are quite a xenophobic bunch here. We don&#39;t like Maximals. However,\nwe are disposed to let you join us as you are one of the Ancients.\nShould you not wish to do this, you will have to join the Governmental\nArmy. There is no other option.\n\nShe was flabbergasted. She hadn&#39;t even said a word and she was being\nstigmatized! Just what was going on?\n\nBalistica: Huh... Just... Just who do you represent?\n\n???: I am from the Iron Skulls. We believe that the Maximals are going\nto lead us astray. War is brewing, and survival means we must impose\nour leadership.\n\nBalistica: On second thought... I think I&#39;ll get into the army...\n\n???: As you wish... Someone will fetch you soon enough.\n\n\n\n"}}
