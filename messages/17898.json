Cool, but I really \nwant to get my hands on Megatron.&quot; He walked over to KitKat. &quot;Let me \nand Drillbit go on a mission and bring Inferno back here. I&#39;m sure he \nknows the real wherabouts of that virus. I can make him talk.&quot; He \nsmiled evily.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nThey started walking back to the Ark with everyone, hoping they could \nforget about the Trainers and install the things they worked so hard \nto get.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois saw Battera try to lose him in the caverns. Not so fast, Bat-\ngirl. The Crimson Scavenger wants to have a few words with you. He \nfollows her with some dificulty, clipping his wing on that sharp \nturn. He loses control of a second, but balanes himself and attempts \nto catch up. He sees her enter a cave, but when he goes in he can&#39;t \nsee her any where. He cries out.\n\n&quot;Yo, Bat-Girl! Listen, I&#39;m sorry about earlier. I was angry because I \ndon&#39;t like sarcasm. By what I know, I think you&#39;re in the same \nposition as me. Only I think you have some idea of where you came \nfrom before you joined the Alliance. I had....a flashback, I guess \nyou could call it. It had you in it, and you were crying, and I was \nhappy for you, and I don&#39;t UNDERSTAND IT!&quot; Vulois sat down, \nfrustrated, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just, I think you may know something, \nand I really want to clear this up. So, before all of this, did I \nknow you somewhere? Doing something?&quot; He prayed she had the answer.\n\n\n"}}
