She wasn&#39;t ugly but he wasn&#39;t interested either. However, Shesta seemed to like her.\r\nThe dog/wolf creature padded towards Fenox slightly and moved to press her snout on the femms thigh, since that was her sign which indicated that she wanted to be petted.\r\nVlad, on the other hand, simply ignored what Shesta was doing and went forward with his words. \r\nHowever, it might prove wiser to try and find out if this woman knew anything about Von and if he was still alive. There was no point in getting a hitman if his brother had passed on.\r\nVlad cleared his throat and leaned in towards Fenox ever so slightly.** &quot; I&#39;m looking for my older brother, Von. From what I remember of him he&#39;s tall and fierce in appearance. I was wondering if you knew him or where he&#39;s located.&quot;   *** Vlad leaned back a bit, his optics still trained upon Fenox.** &quot; If it&#39;s any help he was one of the first to crash here with Megatron. After participating in the Golden Disc theft.&quot;\r\n** He hoped that she would know who he was talking about, it was much more easier then trying to search for his spark signature. Which would be like looking for a needle in a haystack.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
