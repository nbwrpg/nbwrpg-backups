(Optimal Optimus\nwould have NEVER been able to deflect Rampages missle simply by useing his\narm.) But the writers allowed it because it allowed them to destroy the\nMaximal ship so the Maximals wouldn&#39;t have to defend it and the Ark at the\nsame time, a war on two fronts would&#39;ve weakened the Maximals and since they\ndidn&#39;t really have a qualified leader for the second front they would&#39;ve\nlost the Beast Wars.\n\nIf anyone feels I abuse the rules then say so but since it&#39;s usually my\ncharacters that end up looking like the wrong end of a collision with a mack\ntruck I personally don&#39;t feel I do. Blocking an attack should be legal as\nlong as it doesn&#39;t end up being EVERY attack. She shot down two missles and\nan attack failed, logical solution- ATTACK AGAIN AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\n\nI&#39;ve already posted that Brandeds flamethrower can heat up like a blast\nfurnace, for those of you who haven&#39;t worked industry that would be anywhere\nfrom 2000 to 5000 degrees  (Nothing compared to &quot;Advanced&quot; Transformer\ntechnology.)  depending on whats being melted (Science note for those\ninterested) Brass has a melting point of 1800 degrees, copper slightly\nlower.(Softer metal requires lower temperature.)\n\nOne last question- How is it that Arty and Pacifix are engaged in hand to\nhand combat but Pacifix isn&#39;t being hit by any of the weapons fire being\nused against Arty? We&#39;ve got Slags flames, Artemiss&#39; automatic weapons fire,\nand whatever other attacks come his way. It&#39;s three on one people, IM each\nother and get your attacks organized. By all rights Arty Should be toast.\n(Burnt toast if Slag keeps eatin Jabernero peppers.)\n\n ----- Original Message -----\nFrom: robertdahl &lt;rdahl@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, May 31, 2001 7:53 AM\nSubject: Re: The bum and the hole...\n\n\n&gt; OOC: Well I just need to ad my opinion, I think the rule of interception\n&gt; is pretty useless, and poorly thought out. IMH it is much more\n&gt; interesting sometimes to intercept than to just dodge when you think you\n&gt; dont want to accept dammage. And Jeff, in the show they did intercept,\n&gt; ussually missiles with gun fire, but sometimes more powerful rays\n&gt; against each other. Megatron and Dinobots laser war from Double Dinobot\n&gt; comes to mind. In the original series, Slag even ignited a missile with\n&gt; his flame breath before it reached him, and I&#39;m not sure, but I think\n&gt; Inferno did it too.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
