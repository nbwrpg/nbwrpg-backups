Don&#39;t worry, they don&#39;t breathe fire or\nanything, and they certainly don&#39;t want to ram ground targets).  \n\n\t&quot;Well, me and my sister haven&#39;t been here for too long.  We landed here in\nour stasis pods pretty close by,&quot; Necromancer then looked again, making\nsure there was enough space, &quot;And about beast modes.  I will show you mine\nfirst,&quot; He said as he started running, then he transformed into a big, big\ndragon!  He quickly shot up into the sky, so he didn&#39;t hit any surrounding\ntrees with his enormous body.\n\n\tNecromancer looked down at Dinobot and Tavatron.  They looked much\ndifferent from up here, &quot;In our beast modes, we are capable of carrying\nover 30 bots,&quot; He said and then queued Hell Drak to transform.\n\n\tHell Drak nodded, but didn&#39;t say anything, and then ran and transformed,\ngoing up into the sky beside her brother.\n\n\tShe then looked down at Dinobot and Tavatron, &quot;You two need a ride\nanywhere?&quot; \n\n\tNecromancer looked at Dinobot and then moved his eyes towards Hell Drak.\n\n\tNecromancer doubted that they wanted a ride, but if they did, he wouldn&#39;t\nlet Hell Drak carry them, just in case she tried pulling a stunt.\n\n\tNecromancer looked down again, &quot;If you need a lift, I&#39;d be happy to help.&quot;\n\n"}}
