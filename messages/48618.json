Here are\n&gt; the \n&gt; final results: \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; POLL QUESTION: I think I know how to bring the rpg \n&gt; back.  We need to turn it into a \n&gt; contest where you get points for your \n&gt; chars.  Naturally the RPer&#39;s success \n&gt; would be more important than the \n&gt; chars.  For winning a battle (like \n&gt; Sunhawk did) you might get 2 or 3 \n&gt; points, for rping the battle well (like \n&gt; Sunhawk did) you might get 15 or 16 \n&gt; points, for having your char voted most \n&gt; messed up in the head (Sunhawk will be) \n&gt; 50 or 60 points.  Whatt&#39; you think? \n&gt; \n&gt; CHOICES AND RESULTS\n&gt; - yes, 1 votes, 25.00%  \n&gt; - no, 3 votes, 75.00%  \n&gt; \n&gt; INDIVIDUAL VOTES\n&gt; - yes \n&gt;      - dewboy30816@... \n&gt; - no \n&gt;      - airly2000@... \n&gt;      - black_ben14@... \n&gt;      - x_rauq_x@... \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; For more information about this group, please visit \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg \n&gt; \n&gt; For help with Yahoo!
