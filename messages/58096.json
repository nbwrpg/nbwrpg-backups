(3rd Year Computer Science Major in University) =)\n\n-AzureBlade-\n\nAzure nearly keeled over as the backlash from the abruptly severed \nlink smashed into his neuro-capacitors (i just made these up ;). His \narm shot out and caught the edge of the table before he collapsed \ncompletely. As he caught himself he noticed something... something \nthat was off... something he&#39;d just been in contact with. \n\nThe dormant program.\n\nIt had latched itself to his neurolink just before it had been \nsevered. This was not only bad news, but it meant they still didn&#39;t \nknow how to remove it correctly.\n\nAzure looked up at Ydrassil for a few moments with a pained \nexpression on his face before he cringed violently and slumped to \nthe ground quivering as the dormant - or perhaps not so dormant - \nprogram showed him why a removal attempt was NOT in anyone&#39;s best \nintrest.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ydrassil/BlackStorm:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I can&#39;t resis more!!!!&quot;said the femme  and the link among Azure \nand \n&gt; BlackStorm was broken.
