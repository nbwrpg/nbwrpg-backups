However if you\nare drawing from Animated versions of Prowl and Jazz and Prime, then\nwe can make some alterattions. Perhaps they are from a later version?\nI am trying to get a feel for them.\n\nWhich toon is the inspiration for your characters of Tuscon,\nNightshift and Straight Shot?\n\n- preston\n\nOn 8/25/11, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; That&#39;s an interesting question.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would probably say, Tucson is G2, due to the fact that he&#39;s quite a bit\n&gt; younger than Leo Prime.  That also includes his sister, Straight Shot, who\n&gt; probably were transported off Cybertron and near Atlantis so is to allow\n&gt; them ample time to recover from near traumatic injuries.  Tucson was taken\n&gt; off line after he got pegged by Cyclonus and was in some sort of Stasis lock\n&gt; for a couple of vorns.  Then he travels to Ancient Earth with Perseus.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift is also G2, how he got to Ancient Earth was probably due to the\n&gt; fact that as a pretender, he had connections even with Decepticon forces,\n&gt; and somehow hitched a ride with them, ending up on Ancient Earth.\n&gt; Nightshift is definitely built with a vehicle alt form, and he finds it hard\n&gt; to adapt, but does the best he can under his circumbstances.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s the best I can think of for now.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Here is are interesting questions for each of our characters. So many\n&gt;&gt; of us I think have created characters on the fly and have inserted\n&gt;&gt; them in the game or perhaps have been given the character by someone\n&gt;&gt; else, and the history is sparse.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However I would think that after all this time it is safe to assume\n&gt;&gt; that no matter how we got the character, these characters are\n&gt;&gt; completely ours now. So now we can create, reboot or whatever our\n&gt;&gt; character&#39;s history so that they chime in with our portrayals of them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Did your character come from G1/G2 time frame and some how appear\n&gt;&gt; here, did they live through the great war and transport to old Earth\n&gt;&gt; from the future Beast Wars time frame or were they constructed\n&gt;&gt; somewhere else?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If they did have a vehicular alt mode, why have they maintained it on\n&gt;&gt; Ancient Earth where there are no roads?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; All questions to ask ourselves about our characters. These are all\n&gt;&gt; ways we can expand our knowledge of the characters we play - whether\n&gt;&gt; we created them or given to us, and I look forward to the answers.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
