He had =\r\nfinally gathered the courage to ask her hand in eternal bond. His spark bea=\r\nting a mile a minute, he couldn&#39;t help but share his joy with her, yet doin=\r\ng so in an innocent way.  He closes his eyes for a moment with a smile on h=\r\nis face.\n\n&quot; I love you with all my spark, that will never change, and no on=\r\ne will ever take that away from us.&quot;\n\nOutside, Uproar catches up to Lord El=\r\nder, as he observes the private code on Tuscons door.\n\n&quot; Wow, so, I guess T=\r\nucson and Talon are kinda gonna be like Rodimus and Nightlight.  I wonder i=\r\nf Tucson will ya know..  Have a family of his own some day?&quot;\n\nMoving to Leg=\r\nacy&#39;s quarters, Straight Shot thinks for a moment before saying anything, w=\r\nhich was her best of traits.  Once she had an idea of what she wanted to sa=\r\ny, she looks up to Legacy, with an air of sincerity she always had for ever=\r\nyone, including her brother.\n\n&quot; Thanks, for letting me talk to you, I appre=\r\nciate it.  I just wanted ta let ya know that I think my brother doesn&#39;t qui=\r\nte understand where you&#39;re coming from and maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s so critica=\r\nl of your actions.  He&#39;s always been like that, not just around you, but wi=\r\nth me too, and yeah, sometimes it gets on my nerves.  But with things as th=\r\ney are, and what happened ta him in the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s pu=\r\nt up such a defense and why he&#39;s so determined ta think off the pavement.  =\r\nAnd maybe that&#39;s why his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed with=\r\n mine too, at times.  Honestly though, how do you feel about his thinking o=\r\nutside the box?  Is there a reason why you&#39;d rather not go that way?&quot;\n\n--- =\r\nIn nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nighlight Smiled and squeezed Rodimus&#39;s hand while she lay do=\r\nwn, she was\n&gt; &gt; getting better and with more energy with every second that =\r\npassed &quot;ELita?,\n&gt; &gt; where is she? how is she?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elita waved her litt=\r\nle tail when she hear her mom calling her, she was\n&gt; &gt; impatient to go and =\r\ngive her a big hug, but she knew that she had to wait\n&gt; &gt; till her dad and =\r\nPerceptor decided that it was time\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus smiled broadly as more and =\r\nmore evidence of Nightlight&#39;s full\n&gt; recovery was being shown. There was al=\r\nways so much weight on his\n&gt; shoulders as of late, weight and guilt. For wh=\r\nat he had done, for what\n&gt; he allowed to be done. But being here and now wi=\r\nth Nightlight he could\n&gt; feel at least some of that weight lifting from his=\r\n shoulders.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;She is waiting outside my love.&quot; Rodimus said softly. &quot;We=\r\n were just\n&gt; making sure you were strong enough first before we brought her=\r\n in.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning to wave, Rodimus motioned for Elita to be brought in.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; *******************************\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kup watched the sce=\r\nne, letting the couple have time together.

He could see Rodimus and Nightlight, a small wistful=\r\n\n&gt; smile playing about his face. &quot;Perhaps we can give them a little more\n&gt; =\r\ntime.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wing Caliber nodded, &quot;A little.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *************************=\r\n**\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor walked away of the maximals almost follow=\r\ning Lord Elder, with no a\n&gt; &gt; real purpose by now.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Eld=\r\ner slowed as he walked away, noticing that none of the others\n&gt; had taken t=\r\nhe moment to talk with Perceptor. He shot a glance at\n&gt; Uproar and Quickstr=\r\nide and then looked back at Perceptor. With a\n&gt; motion of his hand he gestu=\r\nred for them to talk with Perceptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to walk in the directio=\r\nn of Tuscon when he was waylaid . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot ca=\r\ntches up to Lord Elder. If she had learned anything from\n&gt; &gt; her brother, i=\r\nt was how to put up a brave face, and do the things that you\n&gt; &gt; were afrai=\r\nd to do no matter if you knew the outcome or not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Lord Elder, sir,=\r\n you&#39;re right too, I know what I gotta do, for my brother&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; sake. I - r=\r\neally should try ta talk ta Legacy about all this, and get his\n&gt; &gt; side of =\r\nthe story. Ohh boy, here it goes, Courage 101 in session.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nElder smiled broadly, &quot;That is very good!&quot; he said happily. &quot;May\n&gt; Primus b=\r\ne with you.&quot; He said as he patted her on the back and then\n&gt; continued on h=\r\nis to see Tuscon\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She now walks off to find Legacy and =\r\nby intuition, finds him readilly. Being\n&gt; &gt; as small as she was, what she w=\r\nas about to do, would take every ounce of\n&gt; &gt; bravory in her tiny spark. To=\r\n be sure that she was at eye level with Legacy,\n&gt; &gt; so she didn&#39;t need to c=\r\nrane her neck, she finds the highest point in the\n&gt; &gt; room, climbs on it, a=\r\nnd looks to him as if she were about to talk to Tucson\n&gt; &gt; personally.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; By the time Straight Shot caught up with Legacy he had made it =\r\nto one\n&gt; of the shops that seemed to liter the Ark. He had made it into his=\r\n own\n&gt; personal quarters and work station.\n&gt; \n&gt; He had not added much to th=\r\ne place or even made many changes. There\n&gt; was a small section for rechargi=\r\nng chamber and a small modified\n&gt; computer panel; something that was needed=\r\n since these rooms were\n&gt; designed for Autobots who were several times larg=\r\ner than any of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy was standing at one of the computer panel =\r\nas information\n&gt; scrolled across the screen.\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned as Straight Sho=\r\nt entered.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Legacy, if it&#39;s okay, could - we talk for =\r\na little while?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy looked at Straight Shot, his cold c=\r\nyclopean gaze fastening onto\n&gt; her. &quot;That would be acceptable.&quot; Legacy said=\r\n emotionlessly. He turned\n&gt; to face her completely, folding his arms behind=\r\n his back he waited\n&gt; patiently for her to say what she had to say.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He types in a code to close the doors, to allow them a little=\r\n privacy.\n&gt; &gt; Once hearing them shut, he smiles to Talon, and gently takes =\r\nher hands.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; By the time Lord Elder caught up with Tuscon he =\r\nwas inside his\n&gt; chamber, he could smell the metallic oils that Talon custo=\r\nmarily wore\n&gt; as well. He smiled grimly as he saw that the privacy codes on=\r\n Tuscon&#39;s\n&gt; room had been engaged.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a nod Lord Elder turned away. =\r\nThere would be time enough for talk.\n&gt; \n&gt; As he turned he noticed Torca as =\r\nhe walked up to him, a grim look on\n&gt; his face. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Lord Elder =\r\nsaid, concern written on his\n&gt; face.\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca nodded, &quot;We need to talk.&quot; =\r\nIs all he said, his reverberous tone\n&gt; echoing in the halls.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Talon widely smiled and said while she jumped to Tucson&#39;s arms and s=\r\naid\n&gt; &gt; &quot;YES!! YES!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a start Elder thought he heard s=\r\nome sort of outburst from the\n&gt; room but he could not make out what it was.=\r\n He smiled thinking that at\n&gt; least it sounded happy, they all needed happi=\r\nness in their life.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked back at Torca he nodded, &quot;Of course.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; With a gesture from Torca he and Elder began walking towards the bridge.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
