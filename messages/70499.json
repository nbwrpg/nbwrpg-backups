Quite clearly Tuscon\ncould hear his own voice coming back, &quot;LOST . . . LOST . . . Lost . .\n. Lost . . . lost . . . &quot;\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; He narrows his eyes, and in a running start he transforms into truck mode, and rolls his tires swiftly over the ground,kicking up dust beneath them. He was adament about reaching Rodimus and was not about to let anything get in his way.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus, if you can hear me, keep talking to me. If we keep in touch with each other it will be easier to be reunited. Where are you? And what direction are you headed?&quot;\n\n&lt;New&gt;\n\nThere is no response from Rodimus from radio or otherwise to Tuscon&#39;s\ncall. All that he can hear is the background static of the\ncommunication open lines.\n\nHowever he does hear something, a strange femenine voice that comes\nsimultaniously over his radio and somehow from the air around him. One\nthat sounds distinctly alien and yet all too familiar at the same\ntime. &quot;He is no longer yours. You are too late . . . . .&quot;\n\nEven as the voice was speaking a door on one of the manufacturing\nplants beeped. Under normal conditions the sound would have been so\nsmall so as to go unoticed, but here on this silent and unmoving\nstreet the sound was almost strident as with a rumble the door began\nto raise, revealing inky blackness inside.\n\n&quot; . . . . . I have given you his carapase,&quot; The voice continued, &quot;but\nhis spark belongs to the horde . . . . .&quot;\n\nFrom the shadows within three insect or spider like creatures stepped\nout, their clawed feet making high pitched scratching noises on the\nsteel of the street. They looked like wicked, mishappen spiders with\nlong claw like appendages. Thier bodies were all well armored colored\nin reds, yellows, and blacks - looking distinctly like Rodimus&#39;\ncolors, even if a bit backwards and darker. Each one stood twice as\ntall as Tuscon himself when in robot mode and much wider.\n\n&quot; . . . . . And now, so will yours!&quot; The voice finished and lapsed\ninto silence.\n\nThe creatures looked around as if sniffing the air as they slowly\nbegan to orient on Tuscon!\n\nMeanwhile Tusonc&#39;s radar gave him, not quite a ping, but a &#39;pull&#39;.\nSomething that he couldn&#39;t quite make out was almost calling him.\nAbove him, perhaps 50 feet in the air, an automatic magna-railcar\nmoved along its track that would take it through and eventually around\nthe city. The hum of its supsensor beams breaking the silence that\nlives on the open street. It was from there that the pull seemed to\nresonate.\n\nThe insects so far seemed to be only noting Tuscon as the three began\nmoving with surprising speed in his direction.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
