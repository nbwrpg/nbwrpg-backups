I recommend either a tag system or a\nSERIOUS cut-down on characters. I don&#39;t mean to sound\nlike I&#39;m complaining, because I&#39;m not. For instance\nyou, Yan have a buttload and a half of characters, 85%\nof which probably don&#39;t have a purpose and a great\ndeal which I&#39;m positive you never use. I&#39;m all for\nlarge-scale robot warfare, but this is just\nridiculous.\n\nIt annoys me having to waste space in my inbox full of\nposts that say...\n\n\n:::Optimus Prime:::\n\nSmokes a doobie.\n\n\nAnd that&#39;s it. That&#39;s the post. Would it not be\npossible for anyone to y&#39;know...not do separate posts\nfor 15 characters instead of devouring space in other\npeoples&#39; mailboxes with one-liners?\n\nIf nobody else has a problem with this, I&#39;ll shut up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Yanshosh@... wrote:\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea. I&#39;ve seen RPGs\n&gt; with tags, and \n&gt; they&#39;re kinda missing something. I can&#39;t really say\n&gt; what, but it \n&gt; isn&#39;t as good as knowing what&#39;s going on everywhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kevin Ramsey &lt;kramsey20@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I agree. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But is anybody else annoyed about having to read\n&gt; EVERY\n&gt; &gt; message in your inbox only to find that about 75%\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; what you read neither pertains to your\n&gt; &gt; character/characters or has any interest to you at\n&gt; &gt; all? (considering that my box fills up with an\n&gt; average\n&gt; &gt; of 30 NBWRPG posts an hour, I&#39;m willing to bet\n&gt; that at\n&gt; &gt; least some of you don&#39;t have time to rifle through\n&gt; up\n&gt; &gt; to 100 messages a day if you only have time to do\n&gt; &gt; e-mail once or twice a day.). I wouldn&#39;t mind\n&gt; things\n&gt; &gt; changing. Maybe a tag system where at the end of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; message everybody puts in parentheses say...(Tag:\n&gt; John\n&gt; &gt; Doe) or something. Or maybe an Attention system in\n&gt; &gt; every subject header, say....&quot;Your Subject Header\n&gt; Here\n&gt; &gt; (ATTN: Optimus Prime)&quot;. If something is REALLY\n&gt; &gt; important, the subject header could be (ATTN:\n&gt; &gt; Everyone). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I remember being told shortly after I joined that\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; current system is SUPPOSED to be so everybody has\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; go through every message. But considering that\n&gt; most of\n&gt; &gt; the posts here are one-liners and/or complete\n&gt; drivel\n&gt; &gt; (that&#39;s not to say EVERY post are one-liners or\n&gt; drivel\n&gt; &gt; though), doing that just seems like a\n&gt; Unicron-sized\n&gt; &gt; waste of time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts anyone?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     As much as I enjoy watching pointless\n&gt; arguments,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this could drive another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wedge between people in the group.  We don&#39;t\n&gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that.  Alten, as amusing as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the post was, it went beyond the bounds of good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taste.  From an objective \n&gt; &gt; &gt; perspective, Yan probably could have been less\n&gt; harsh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but his point was valid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
