Even his arm \nhad been repaired although it still lay detached on the ground.  He had \nconsidered reinstalling it but left it off as a reminder of his failings.  He \nhad spent his time wisely, however.  He spent most of the sitting and \nreviewing the previous battle.  He now knew that he needed to dodge and move \nfaster.  To do this he trimmed his wings.  It was excruciatingly painful but \nhe was now more aerodynamic.  He also needed better aim.  This was easier \nonce his wings were recovering but of a new shape.  He began flying at high \nspeeds and shooting hapless birds.  Once he was able to hit a bird at any \nspeed he sat and waited.\n\n    He was sitting on his island home when he saw the &quot;dark light.&quot;  It took \na minute to register what it was but he quickly realized that his battle was \nnot yet over.  He picked up his arm and grimaced as he jammed it back in its \nsocket and reattached its circuitry and motor controls.  It still hurt but \nthat would be a fitting reminder.  He would need both arms for the battle to \ncome.  He took off and headed toward the source of the light.  By the time he \narrived Galvatron had already left and Enertron had no way to track him so he \nsat.\n\n"}}
