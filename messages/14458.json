He frowns, \nlooking around. Everything was shattered! Zardus&#39; eyes widen, looking at the \nfemm, still strapped on the table.\n\nThe Alliance commander frowns again, looking around the lab. There was no \nother explanation, the femm must have somehow broken every piece of glass in \nthe room, including the lights.\n\nZardus walks over to a console, frowning at the shattered screen. He taps a \nfew keys on his wrist comp, the bonds on the female releasing.\n\nZardus walks over to her. The scanners reported that she was awake, and that \nthe new programming has kicked in.\n\n&quot;Welcome to the Alliance,&quot; he says, coming up to the table, &quot;I must \ncongratulate you on the job you did with the glass in this room.&quot;\n\n"}}
