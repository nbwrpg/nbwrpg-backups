Kenzo landed and\ntransformed back to his robot form. He then glanced around at all the\ndifferent types of bots that were gathered together.  It looked like a\nstrange Halloween party.\n&quot;Looks like we&#39;ll get to meat a lot of &#39;old friends&#39;&quot; Kenzo commented.\n\nInferno and Quickstrike arrived from the opposite direction.  \n&quot;Ah! The Queen as summoned bots from every colony.  A show of the\nRoyalty&#39;s power.&quot; Inferno stated, even if it was a bit inaccurate.\nQuickstrike sat down panting &quot;I-I musta run at least 40 miles. I need\na break.&quot; he collapsed on the ground to catch his breath.\n\nWaspinator flew nearby carrying the missile he had taken from the\nPredacon base.  He placed it nearby on the ground before proceeding to\nthe gathering.\n&quot;He-he, for once Waspinator be sneaky one.  Waspinator will blast\nMini-Unicrons warriors with bomb so they know how it feels. hehehe.&quot;\nHe snickered to himself.\n\n\n"}}
