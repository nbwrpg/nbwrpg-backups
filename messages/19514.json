And you\n&gt; want to put that in me? Oh no...No way. I am not going to run the\n&gt; risk of infecting...&quot; she stopped as the protoform shivered.  It was\n&gt; coming out of stasis lock.  She woke up and opened her eyes.  She\n&gt; took a deep breath and felt the air fill her lungs.  She just layed\n&gt; there, breathing and with her eyes open. She thought, &quot;Veratis, what\n&gt; did you do to me?&quot; She could tell that Veratis was nervious, and that\n&gt; wasn&#39;t helping her own fears any.  She felt herself shake, she felt\n&gt; cold.  The white fur was still growing and the wings on her back were\n&gt; developing into huge wings with white feathers.  She could feel her\n&gt; skin crawl as it developed and started to form over her protoform.\n&gt; She tried not to cry, but she couldn&#39;t understand what or why this\n&gt; was happening toher.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Veratis didn&#39;t know what to expect, he didn&#39;t expect yes from\n&gt; Shadow\n&gt; &gt; Wing that much was for sure. &quot;The last time I used the virus was on\n&gt; &gt; insecticons. It nullified thier ability to communicate. The virus\n&gt; &gt; eventually spread until they were wiped out.&quot; he wasn&#39;t afraid for\n&gt; &gt; her at the moment, he was afraid of the effects that would occur if\n&gt; &gt; it spread through her telepathy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If I give you a small dose it should weaken your telepathy, I just\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know what other effects it may have.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  He didn&#39;t have to say it but the biggest thought going through his\n&gt; &gt; mind was that he&#39;d never used the virus on a protoform.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
