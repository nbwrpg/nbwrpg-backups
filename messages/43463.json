I WAS A NEWBIE WHEN I MADE THEM AND FURTHERMORE IF \nYOU SAY THEY DON&#39;T EXIST THEN WHY IN THE HECK IS ICE AT MAXIMAL CITY, \nAND IN THE STRICK LAWS OF PHYSICS NONE OF OUR CHARACTERS EXIST!  I \nRETHOUGHT THEIR BACKSTORY AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS!  THEY WERE ON \nEARTH ALL  THIS TIME WITH AN IDEA THERE MIGHT BE OTHER TRANSFORMERS \nBUT NEVER ACTUALLY SAW (except for that &quot;Carnitrons post and Megaton) \nANY SINCE THEY STAYED IN THE SAME PLACE FOR A LONG TIME. I WAS JUST \nTO LAZY TO PUT IT UP UNTIL NOW!  YOU CAN ELIMINATE MOST OF MY OLD \nPOSTS DUE TO THAT, BUT NOT QUESTION THEIR EXISTENCE (this is my \ntechnique in most debates bore the guy until he&#39;s sick of the whole \nthing effective huh?)!\n\nMustex:\n\nMustex runs up to perceptor, and flashes his Maximal icon.\n\nMustex:SHOW ME YOURS OR PREPARE TO DIE!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Hello LN nice to see you back.

Well now, seeing as how the RPG seems incapcitated \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; dewboy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is back in some shape or form, and also because people have been \n&gt; &gt; asking where \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am. I think its time to return to the RPing in NBWRPG. \n&gt; However... \n&gt; &gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; things first... Dewboy shut the hell up. You got banned for not \n&gt; &gt; following \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rules, just having chars pop up any which way, doing things \n&gt; without \n&gt; &gt; asking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the council, and above all else just plain being a complete \n&gt; idiot. \n&gt; &gt; Noone \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cares about mustex or stallex and what their supposeblys going \nto \n&gt; &gt; do, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; noone cares about Rhesus who doesn&#39;t exist since he never \n&gt; appeared \n&gt; &gt; and even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the council said he didn&#39;t. Whee another thing now, my next post \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; going to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be evil... very very very evil.... Airly if you don&#39;t like what \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; going to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen in it to blacknightmare, too bad. You got her into whats \n&gt; &gt; going to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen and you understood it when I told you OOC and went along \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; it. Oh \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the next post is going to be so very evil... very very \n&gt; evil... \n&gt; &gt; oh \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah.... since the infecticons and Vile Force havent been heard \n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; in god \n&gt; &gt; &gt; knows when, I think I have some time to work with... yessss....\n\n\n"}}
