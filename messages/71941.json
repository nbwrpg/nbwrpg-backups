Perhaps a bridge with a tim=\r\ne rift component. I wonder...

A Space Bridge is not small, it is not hidden. It is=\r\n huge and it will do as bidden. It would not make someone go bye bye withou=\r\nt a cry, it would be as if half the planet had bene here to die. Believe me=\r\n, if there was one up, we would know right away. From a column of light int=\r\no space that would be visible far far away. It cannot be hidden, it is so e=\r\nnormous it would do what it is bidden.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Glancing up at Tuscon, &quot;There =\r\nare plenty of things that canmadke someone go invisible and hdie.

We would see it, we =\r\nwould tell, we would tell the shunt shooting up to Primus knows well. So th=\r\nat it is not, that it is ridiculous, utterly and absolutely totally it give=\r\ns me fits. Far easier to do something like a cloak, a sensor jammer, someon=\r\ne stealth whom can poke. They could have simply blasted him offline, and ca=\r\nrried him off in Beast mode this time.

Standing up and ready to storm=\r\n, &quot;If you want to waste your time, then you won&#39;t waste mine. Withuot you t=\r\nhen I will go, in search of my friend and out I know.

But like Leo said, only use it if we gotta defend ourselves and not ta t=\r\nhrow the first punch.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson could already se=\r\ne that the three of them would be a good fit, just by how they expressed th=\r\neir views.  It made him smile.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; See?  It&#39;s no=\r\nt so bad is it?  Here you are putting your heads together instead  of again=\r\nst each other.  Remember, look out for yourselves and if something is way o=\r\nver your head, please call for help.  It isn&#39;t worth risking your lives jus=\r\nt to try and do something on your own.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; He tur=\r\nns to Leo Prime.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; That goes for you as well. =\r\n Don&#39;t take on more than you can handle.  Now, let&#39;s meet with everyone and=\r\n see who wants to stay and who wishes to venture out.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;NEW =E2=80=93 WHEELIE&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWheelie glanced timidly over at =\r\nStraight Shot and Rattrap.  He didn&#39;t like them one bit, and he felt that g=\r\niven RODIMUS was missing that now was not the time for the `learn the meani=\r\nng of friendship&#39;, as someone in the past he knew would have put it so bell=\r\nigerently.  But he knew that they could nto put their issues aside until la=\r\nter, and he would have to deal with it now to the best of his abilities, an=\r\nd now was not the time for being offensive.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFor now, like it or no=\r\nt (probably not) the little orange racer was in the army, and htat meang go=\r\ning along with orders.  Nodding up at TUSCON, &quot;Then we should go and out, a=\r\nnd find thigns before they get worse about.  Rodimus is powerful yes, and w=\r\ne might lose him if we waste time abreast.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNodding at Straight Sh=\r\not and Rattrap, &quot;Then we had better go, we have to get out fast before we l=\r\nose what we know.  We have to start searching about, before we lose what we=\r\n&#39;re sent to find out!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;OLD =E2=80=93 WINDLORD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Windlord arrived at the place and said at Tucson&quot;Sir=\r\n, Talon has arrived at the base; Also I would like to know what measures wo=\r\nulb be taken in order to avoid dark Rodimus to lure out the basee at Nighli=\r\nght and Elita&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;OLD =E2=80=93 TUSCON&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Tucson looks to Windlord with a sigh of relief.  He was happy to ha=\r\nve Talon back safe at the Ark.  He then takes a moment to collect his thoug=\r\nhts.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Let Talon know that she is more than welcome to j=\r\noin us here in the ready room.  And as far as what to expect, I&#39;m not sure =\r\nbut we should keep a bodyguard with Nightlight and Elita.  They must not le=\r\nave the Ark until I deem it safe to do so. &quot; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He leans u=\r\np against the wall, watching the computer models carefully.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &quot; There is no easy way around this situation, we&#39;re all in for a tough =\r\nroad ahead.  Now, I am not going to force anyone into anything, I will allo=\r\nw everyone to make a choice that best suits them and the mission at hand.  =\r\nAnd whatever they wish to do is alright with me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Someth=\r\ning nudged at his logic system what would make someone vanish off the ends =\r\nof the Earth without a trace?  Then the answer his him and it hits hard.  &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Space bridge.....&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He turns his hea=\r\nd sharply to Leo Prime.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Leo, I think I know what could =\r\nhave happened to Optimus Primal.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Only a space bridge would be capa=\r\nble of causing a strange disappearances as what happened to Primal.  Perhap=\r\ns a bridge with a time rift component. I wonder... Scan for rift activity, =\r\nI don&#39;t know for sure but that&#39;s what it looks like.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW =E2=\r\n=80=93 WHEELIE&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNow this had Wheelie looking up, whether shocke=\r\nd, against, or something different, &quot;NO, you don&#39;t get it.  A Space Bridge =\r\nis not small, it is not hidden.  It is huge and it will do as bidden.  It w=\r\nould not make someone go bye bye without a cry, it would be as if half the =\r\nplanet had bene here to die.  Believe me, if there was one up, we would kno=\r\nw right away.  From a column of light into space that would be visible far =\r\nfar away.  It cannot be hidden, it is so enormous it would do what it is bi=\r\ndden.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nGlancing up at Tuscon, &quot;There are plenty of things that can=\r\nmadke someone go invisible and hdie.  That is far from the top of the list,=\r\n and far thigns wide.  One cannot hide a portal in space, even from scanner=\r\ns, optics know their place.  We would see it, we would tell, we would tell =\r\nthe shunt shooting up to Primus knows well.  So that it is not, that it is =\r\nridiculous, utterly and absolutely totally it gives me fits.  Far easier to=\r\n do something like a cloak, a sensor jammer, someone stealth whom can poke.=\r\n  They could have simply blasted him offline, and carried him off in Beast =\r\nmode this time.  So, what you suggest is the least likely thing, likely to =\r\nbring Unicron himself over to wing.  So think first before you run an idea,=\r\n and file it away in ridiculous or so I hear!&quot;  &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWheelie had been =\r\ntrying to be respectful and listen to orders, but at the point Tuscon had c=\r\nome up with something the small Mini Vehicle thought was utterly absurd, to=\r\ntally nonsense and the most remote thing that could have happened that if d=\r\nid they would instantly know to him was just wasting time.  His thoughts we=\r\nre that Tuscon wanted them to not find Rodimus, his friend, by wasting thei=\r\nr time on such trivialities!  Standing up and ready to storm, &quot;If you want =\r\nto waste your time, then you won&#39;t waste mine.  Withuot you then I will go,=\r\n in search of my friend and out I know.  This is stupid, this is absurd, yo=\r\nur vocalizer just wants to be heard.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nReady to storm out towards t=\r\nhe jungle, with or without orders, with or without Straight Shot and Rattra=\r\np.  This was Wheelie being belligerent and baiting, whether he was given or=\r\nders or not.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOOC =E2=80=93 Yes, he is definitely acting out here i=\r\nf you want ot put on consequences.  But also, I would figure  aspace bridge=\r\n, which results in a huge column of light going out into space, or a rift i=\r\nn reality for a time portal would be fairly obvious, and I think Preston wo=\r\nuld have made a point of us noticing them otherwise.  It&#39;s sort of like a n=\r\nuclear bomb going off a few miles away =E2=80=93 you don&#39;t just not be awar=\r\ne it exists! &amp;#61514;  And fun posts Sandy and Preston, And Airlys!&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b=\r\nlockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-56--963386731--\r\n\n"}}
