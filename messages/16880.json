She hugged herself while \nsitting in the corner.  She wondered why she even gave a care about \nStriker.  But she knew that he was gone forever.  She remembered \ntalking to Prebon and giving herself up for Striker&#39;s release without \na chip.  She then felt a surge as the chip on her straightened out \nher programs again.  She stopped crying and wiped her face with her \nhands.  She slowly got up to her feet and walked over the door way \nand watched Prebon and Slayer. She smiled and knew that is was now \nher place to serve Prebon and to make him happy.\n\nShe walked down and went to Prebon.  She smiled and nodded to Slayer.\n&quot;Is there anything that I can do to help Master Prebon?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
