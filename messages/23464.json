Shokaract, irratated, follows. The\nMini-Mafia, the team who formed the gestalt Mobster, followed behind\nShokaract. Doom Ice finishes screwing Rizopas&#39; head on, but it falls of\nagain. So she picks it up and drags him behind her to the Iron Fist. Serge,\ndepressed with his role in the Alliance, stands there, looking on as Deemos\nleaves. Diskus flies up to Deemos.\n\nDiskus: Diskus will help Deemos some way.\n\nDeemos: No you won&#39;t.\n\nDiskus: Huh?\n\nDeemos: You may be my oldest cohort but I must admit, you helped a little,\nbut that&#39;s when I figured out that you and Artist were obsolete. Artist is\ndead now, but I give you a chance to live. Leave, and don&#39;t come back. You\ndon&#39;t own anything you&#39;d leave behind anyway, so just go.\n\nDiskus quickly flies away, transforming to beast mode in flight.\n\nDeemos: Chances are, that the team he joins will get screwed up.\n\nDiskus flew away quickly, sad that Deemos didn&#39;t want him anymore. He flew\naround looking someplace else for companionship...\n\n\n"}}
