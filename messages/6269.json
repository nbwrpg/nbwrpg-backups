It was\nment for capital ship weapons so hand held did nothing\nof real measure.&quot;\n\n  Allitron nodded,&quot; I checked the logs, apparently he\nhas been buzzing the ship while we were talking to\nmegatron. Why he waved at the secondary command bridge\ni don&#39;t know, might have mistaken it for this one. He\nthen tried attacking one of the main battery turrets\nand got no where.&quot;\n\n  &quot;How was he here for so long and went un reported?&#39;\nPanzertron asked.\n\n  &quot;Just see that it don&#39;t happen again. Also, bring\nthe ship to condition red, Zardus is showing up soon\nand i don&#39;t want any more unexpected visitors once he\ngets here. This includes internal and outboard\nsensors, let see if the system works as good as the\ndesginers claimed it would.&quot;\n\n &quot;Yes General.&quot;\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet Yahoo!
