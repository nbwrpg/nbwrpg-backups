He presses one more button, and both him and \nFliq are edjected into the air, hundreds of feet from the CF.\n\n&quot;Maximals, DROP DOWN, NOW!!!&quot; he yells into his comm on an encoded \nfrequency, hoping that the Maximals will heed his warning. A second \nlater, the shuttle, going over 400 miles per hour, clears the top of \nthe Cybertronian Fire, smashing into the ground two dozen feet behind \nVehement and his minions. The shuttle digs several feet into the \nground upon impact, the self destruct sequence that Grimmler had \nactivated not having any time to activate. But that wasn&#39;t \nneccessary. Every fuel tank in the shuttle is smashed open, coming \ninto contact with energy and exploding in a huge inferno. Rocks, \ndirt, and metal fly in all directions, the blast radius of the \nexplosion being about 30 feet.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster drops to the ground at Grimmler&#39;s warning, the shuttle \nexploding behind Vehement seconds later. He feels shuttle pieces \nflying over his head, smashing into the shields of the Cybertronian \nFire (IR or Tav, please post damage). Dirt and rocks shower over him, \nbut the metal plates are launched from the shuttle too fast to hit \nanyone who is laying down. He opens his eyes, realizing it was \nimpossible to see through all the ash.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler smiles, watching the huge explosion. His jetpack propelling \nhim toward the Cybertronian Fire, he fires his rifle randomly at \nwhere he last saw the enemies. Several shuttle pieces fly past him. \nGrimmler dodges one and looking ahead. His eyes narrow as he sees \nanother plate heading for him, but there wasn&#39;t time to dodge. The \nplate smashes into Grimmler, the impact instantly putting him into \nstasis lock and launching him down toward the ground, his jetpack \nexploding on his back.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFliq lands safely on the ground, looking up to see Grimmler&#39;s jetpack \nexplode. He transforms into robot mode, running to catch the fellow \nMaximal.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (First you say it&#39;s not in your chest, then it is.  Man, you&#39;re \ncrazy)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement would&#39;ve laughed at Iron Raptor&#39;s display of ignorance, \nbut Vehement \n&gt; wasn&#39;t in control of his own body.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Foolish Maximal.&quot; an arm raised, but Unicron seemed to notice all \nthe \n&gt; Maximals, but a plan formed without a tiny bit of fear.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher saw an object approaching, and raised his right wrist, \nthe barrel \n&gt; attached to the bottom of it, two missiles launching out at \nWhistler&#39;s \n&gt; sternum as he jumped at him.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Brotherhood member transformed to his hover tank mode.\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector flew upward, the missiles missing but twenty of the \nbullets \n&gt; striking his legs and the flames engulfing the back of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; He didn&#39;t seem to notice the damaged armor of his legs, transformin \nto his \n&gt; camera mode and hovering the air.  A bright flash emitted from the \ncamera, \n&gt; the flash designed to temporarily disable optic sensors, the flash \nheading \n&gt; for the Maximals present.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement&#39;s face contorted into a smile, the robot doing a flip \nbackwards and \n&gt; transforming into the shape of a sword.  The sword hovered for the \nbriefest \n&gt; of seconds, not affected by the flash, same as Sun Crusher.  The \ntip of the \n&gt; nine foot long broadsword began to glow a dark emerald.\n&gt; \n&gt; A bolt lanced out form the tip of the blade, extending into a fifty \nby fifty \n&gt; radius, the middle of the blast pointed at Iron Raptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Control returned to Vehement, who instantly felt more drained then \nhe ever \n&gt; had, scanners telling him he had lost 80% of all his power in that \nsingle ye \n&gt; powerful blast.  He transformed back to robot mode, feeling but not \nshowing \n&gt; his weakness.\n\n\n"}}
