No, wh=\r\nat happened back then wasn&#39;t your fault.&nbsp; None of it \nwas.&nbsp; Leo h=\r\ne&#39;s blaming himself for what happened to Rodimus and the others \non himself=\r\n.&nbsp; He thinks that if he had just been a little more careful, he \ncould=\r\n&#39;ve prevented Hydras from winning that battle.&nbsp; But it wasn&#39;t his \nfau=\r\nlt.&nbsp; I was in his cab with him as an on board scout, looking out for \n=\r\npossible ambush.&nbsp; I saw someone in the skies far off behind us and I f=\r\nroze \nbecause he moved in really fast.&nbsp; By the time Cyclonus moved in =\r\nfor the \nshot, I could barely say anything.&nbsp; I was terrified.&nbsp; Th=\r\nen that&#39;s when \nit happened.&nbsp; I don&#39;t remember too much after that but=\r\n he was not the bot \nwho failed the faction, I was.&nbsp; And there isn&#39;t a=\r\n day that goes by without \nme being reminded of that costly error I made ou=\r\nt on that battle field.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Tucson moves over to =\r\nhis sister and puts a hand on her shoulder.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&quot; =\r\nNo, that was never your fault.&nbsp; It was mine.&nbsp; I should have \nneve=\r\nr asked you toventure out with me on such a dangerous mission.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;He then looks to everyone.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&quot;=\r\n Times are about to get difficult.&nbsp; In order to win the battle ahead \n=\r\nwe have to work together, and we need to remain strong.&nbsp; We will overc=\r\nome \nas we have for centuries.&nbsp; Freedom is the right for all sentient =\r\n\nbeings.&nbsp; Now let us win it, for this planet, for us and for Primus.&quot;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpetually on the move and constantly busy. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;On Jul 13, 2011, at 2:11 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyc=\r\nlonus@...&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@g=\r\nmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt;
