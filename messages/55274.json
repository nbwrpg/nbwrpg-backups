His wings were broken \nand could no longer glide..if he had to hed use the thrusters on his feet. \nFire shot out from numerous places, lava like substance came from his mouth, \ninside the two bots were hatching a plan..&quot;What does it take to kill this \nMaximal!&quot; screamed Galvatron, &quot;Yesss.. he is a true foe indeed..&quot; Megatron \nsaid with a snarl. Hydras stood up holding his ribs breathing heavy. &quot;O \nrodimus...were not done with you yet!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; The swords and tails rip the underbelly of Rodimus&#39; car mode to shreds. However \n&gt; since he was airborn and still moveing from his 300mph thrust, he continued at \n&gt; Hydras.\n&gt; OOC: He cant really stop untill he hits something that&#39;ll do the job. He is \n&gt; supposed to have one hell of a collision with Hydras.\n&gt;  aerosmith4e@... wrote:Hydras watched as the bot kept coming....&quot;Aww crap&quot; \n&gt; for rodimus was upon him \n&gt; and he thrusted both his swords and tails at him instinctivly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; Hydras&#39; shots all strike Rodimus, sending parts flying off of him. He lets out \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; roar as the pain surges through him. However he was still coming at Hydras!\n&gt; &gt;  aerosmith4e@... wrote:OOC:sheesh you call that a little?\n&gt; &gt; Hydras let out a roar of pain as the kick sent him flying backwards, The fire \n&gt; &gt; closed around the rocks moved closing his wounds. Perceptor&#39;s message bellowed \n&gt; &gt; and he saw the anger in Rodimus&#39;s eyes..&quot;Yes Prime do it use your anger I love \n&gt; &gt; it!&quot; As Rodimus lept off at incredible speed He shot fire from his mouth,the \n&gt; &gt; two tails lashing out toslice open the bot, his eyes shot out the lasers and \n&gt; &gt; his shoulder blasters rang out 15 shots all right onto the coming Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I hope you dont mind a little CC. I posted for a little damage to \n&gt; Hydras, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but nothing critical.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus brought his arms down in a &quot;x&quot; formation, forcing the swords, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras&#39; arms down. Rodimus then grabbed Hydras around the wrist with his \n&gt; left \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hand. He dug his saw which was in the place of his right hand, down into \n&gt; &gt; Hydras&#39; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; arm. With his balance on his left arm, Roddy flipped both legs up to double \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dropkick Hydras. After hitting this he back flips away and to his feet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just then Perceptor is heard over the comm system.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus stands motionless, and optics look empty, like all hope had been \n&gt; lost. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But then...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Enough of this! Maximals, kill these bastards in cold fluid!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; face shows nothing but hate. He grits his teeth together, while \n&gt; &gt; letting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out an yell that could destroy an audio receptor. He is almost fomeing at \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mouth, with the mixed mech fluids that leak from it. The anger causes his &gt; \n&gt; &gt; normally blue optic sensors to turn a crimson red. His gaze locked on Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus empties his mouth, spitting all the energon and other mech fluids \n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his mouth at Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: On this day, Galvatron, I&#39;ll finally KILL YOU!!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus transformes to car mode and fires his propulsion rockets. Full power \n&gt; &gt; all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; at once, sending Rodimus Prime at Hydras&#39; gut at an airborn 300mph!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the Maximal base Kup was about to take Elita from Cam...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: Give her here...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When Perceptos message came over the comm sytem as well as a picture on all \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the monitors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: By primus no... How could they?! She was a mother, a good bot, she \n&gt; didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deserve this. They targeted her just to get at Rodimus...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kup drops to the floor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: Cam, you may have to help with that baby more if you can. Her father is \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; commander, and she just lost her mother...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kup looks up at the picture of Perceptor on the monitor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: Rodimus will lose all control now. I fear that are leader is gone, and \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; killing machine is in his place. I actually pitty those Predacons now, for \n&gt; &gt; what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus will do to them. May primus have pitty on their sparks...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I hope I really showed the emotion I meant to in this post.
