He remembered being in the forest, trying\n&gt; to escape a granade, but next part he remembered him waking up in CR\nfluid.\n&gt; He paniced a little. His eyes were wide, looking around the area, finding\n&gt; himself in familiar surroundings. It was the cave of the Predacon base.\n&gt;\n&gt; He shook his head and stood up. He looked over and saw Stingtra.
