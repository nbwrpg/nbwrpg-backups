He was obviously still in favor of\n&gt; Meagtron. He&#39;d send Dollen away, Starscream&#39;s most vigilant\n&gt; supporter, and than rat Starscream out to Megatron. Than whe he&#39;s\n&gt; catchin some snooze, somebody pulls the plug on Starscream&#39;s spark.\n&gt; Well, that isn&#39;t going to happen.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Captain Phobia, please let me go in Dollen&#39;s face. I could not stand\n&gt; a meeting with Megatron yet. Please, I can stay loyal if I go with\n&gt; the Alliance. But if I smell Megatron, my anger might overcloud my\n&gt; judgement. Please, for the safety of the group.&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix looked at Ramulus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Alright.....I&#39;m putting you in stasis lock now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix opened Ramulus&#39; back side and pressed a button, putting him into\n&gt; stasis lock.
