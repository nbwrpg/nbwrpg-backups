Yes, I did ask KSL to be a \nmoderator, because he has much more RPGing experience than me, and I am \nrunning very low on time, and cutting alot of events I shouldn&#39;t to be able \nto RP. THat doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s in charge of the RPG, or has any special \npowers. Everyone can point out where rules are broken (but it might get \nannoying), but KSL is stricter than me, so I figured he&#39;d make a good \nmoderator. I admit that small rules don&#39;t need to be pointed out (swearing in \nOOC mails, etc.) but moding and the like does.\n\nAnd SoulStice, I&#39;d like you to show me the post where Unitron broke the shot \nlimit. I could at least be sure that KSL is human then... (kidding)\n\nBut everyone leave KSL alone, he&#39;s only doing his job. And start arguing.\n\n::Zardus/Reptilica/Bloodystrike/DevilDuer/WarMachine::\n\nZardus watches the Chosen Mafia scramble to retreat, frowning. Looking down \nat his wrist comp, Zardus taps a few buttons, the Alliance base tracking \nDeemos&#39; group&#39;s location and keeping a watch on them.\n\n&quot;Should we follow?&quot; War Machine&#39;s voice booms as he steps closer to Zardus, \nlooking at the combining Mafia in the distance.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; Zardus says, &quot;Kill them.&quot;\n\nWarMachine nods, running at the Mafia gestalt, firing missiles and plasma \ncharges.\n\n&quot;Dark One,&quot; Zardus says into his comm, &quot;Can you and your group combine and \ntake that enemy gestalt out?&quot;\n\n&quot;Everyone else,&quot; he says after switching his comm to the whole Alliance, &quot;If \nyou&#39;re not too damage, pursue and destroy. If you are damaged, get into the \nCR chambers.&quot;\n\nWith that, he activates his jetpack, flying after the Mafia and firing at \nDeemos.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike recieves Zardus&#39; orders, flying past the running WarMachine and \nfiring a missile at Sharpedge.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica steps out of the CR chamber, grumbling about dangerous work when he \nrecieves Zardus&#39; transmission. He walks to a door, taking off at the exit of \nthe base at a run.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer comes to a stop as he sees the Chosen Mafia retreating a few dozen \nfeet away from him.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s them!&quot; he yells as he sees the Alliance shots heading for them, &quot;We \nneed ta kill &#39;em!&quot;\n\nHe pulls out his stun gun again, running after Stronghold and firing.\n\n"}}
