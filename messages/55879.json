She crouched under a \nbush and watch something she had never really seen  before. But had \nheard the stories. She rubbed her optics and stared wide opticed at \nthe scene before her. Here was a male black wolf bot showing a small \nfox bot how to pounce and catch prey. She stared in utter amazement. \nCould this be happening, she thought. She stayed down wind of them so \nthey would not smell her. She stayed crouched under the bush and \nwatched. She saw them pouncing on a drone of some sort. She sighed \nand smiled slightly. Such things were forbidden to the old code of \npredacons. A family would give the enemy someting to hold over you in \nbattle. And if something happened to them, you could not focus on \nwhat you were doing, you&#39;d be focused on how they were. She shook her \nhead and sighed. She was about to turn away, when the pain in her \nstomach came back but with force. She fell to the ground and lay \nthere, in wolf mode, panting heavily and in great pain. Under the \nbush, she wasn&#39;t all that visible. She knew if she could not get \nherself back to the base, either those bots just 50 yeards from here \nwould find her by her signal, or she could die there. Either way, she \ndidn&#39;t like her choises.\n\n\n"}}
