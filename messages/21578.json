And I formed up an official sounding rule \n(a variation of the original):\n\nSince there have been no mobile bases in the Beast Wars, and also \nsince mobile bases give an unfair tactical advantage (and often lead \nto moding), mobile bases (any mobile craft other than a transport \npod, one-person transport ship, or something to that extent is \nconsidered a base and is subject to this rule) are not allowed. \nAllowed vehicles are small (up to three bot) transports, with no \nonboard weapons, shields, or CR chambers. If you arrive on the planet \nin a ship not abiding to these rules, it must be grounded where it \nlands, and may not be moved.\n\n\nHow does that sound? Unless there are a bunch of objections, it&#39;ll \nend up on the new site.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Because my sub idea was already rolling before this whole \nthree bot deal \n&gt; took place, im still going to be using it for my design...but I \nwill only \n&gt; place three bots in it.\n\n\n"}}
