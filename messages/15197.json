Thats one of the reasons I came back. Besides, \nyou wouldnt know how to use them to there fullest potential.\n\n    Aracnia spun around to Darkmouse. She didnt look to good, not at all. &quot;I \nthink you ought to get in a CR chamber, now.&quot; She pointed out  the door to \nthe CR room.\n    Paralysis jumped up and walked to the two fembots. &quot;Commander, what about \nRampage? Are we moving?&quot; He asked rather egar.\n    She turned her attention to the frog. &quot;Yes, we are. As soon as Tarantulas \ngets Kitkat and the others here.&quot;\n\n    Tarantulas gives a chuckle to Phobia, a bit confused about his remark. \nOnce agian he looks around, &quot;ARE WE GOING OR NOT?!! WE HAVE CR CHAMBERS AT \nTHE BASE!!!!! LETS MOVE OUT!!!!&quot;\n\n    Rampage now marched through the ship, it creaked under his heavey body. \nHe had to bring the main power back on, warm things up for Aracnia. The rooms \nthat had been left so quickly were still a mess, and the corridors were \nscattered with debris. This place needed some work.\n    &quot;Ah, what a sight it shall be to have the Predacons together once agian! \nSoon, Megatron will join us too....and we will rule this planet! Bawhahah!&quot; \nHe mused to himself, finally reaching the control room where he would \nreestablish power to the ship.\n\n    Inferno, in flight mode, zoomed across the sky holding his pistol. it had \nbeen a long time scince he had actually gone out and patroled, but he was \nactually going to meet with the new Royalty, Black Aracnia. He would reach \nthe bunker soon.\n    As his rear burst out in fire, sending him faster, he spotted the opening \nto the bunker. &quot;AH Ha! The Royalty! Fear not, Inferno has come for you my \nQueen!&quot;  He yelled with excitement and began to plummit towrds the ground.\n    He landed, and tucked his balster away. There, leaning on the entrance, \nhe saw Quickstrike. A bit puzzled at first he realized who it was an \napproached.\n    &quot;Hail fuzor Quickstrike. Where can I locate the Royalty?!!!&quot; He said, \nsaluteing when he said Royalty. He then ducked his head, arched his \nshoulders, and looked around the area suspiciously.\n    He frowned and tilted his head, closer this time, and waited for the \nanswer.\n\n    Megatron had had the best CR dip in a long time. Waspinator had the same, \nand was now talking to Adrax. Megatron just sat and thought about his plans. \nUniting the predacons into one fraction would be hard, impossible. But from \nthe rumors Aracnia had already begun. He would have to talk to her about \nthat....for now he just relaxed in the tank.\n\n"}}
