Zardus is.\n\n::Zardus/Hiss/Scavanger/DevilDuer::\n\nZardus ducks easily under the rockets, looking Kamodia over. She wouldn&#39;t be \na challenge, he funally decides, jumping up into the air and firing at her. \nFrom the corner of his eyes he sees Soundwave arrive. Zardus flies over to \nhim, firing another shot at Kamodia.\n\n&quot;We are a bit busy right now,&quot; he says, firing yet another shot, &quot;Your help \nwould be greatly apreciated...&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHiss turns quickly, Arcangel&#39;s blade slasing inches away from his chest. \nReaching out to quickly grab the Maximal&#39;s arm, Hiss brings his knee up, \nattempting to break the arm.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScavanger ducks under the missiles, flying back up in a spiral, trying to \nmake himself hard to hit as he fires again from his rifle at Icedragon.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer&#39;s eyes widen as he sees the shots coming at him. He jumps to the \nright, the shots riddling his left leg. The Alliance member growls as he hits \nthe ground, rolling to his feet to fire a shot at Shocker from his pistol.\n\n"}}
