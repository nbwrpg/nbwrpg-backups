She kept her hand covered and flung the dagger =\r\nback. It missed Plintissa and hit Artist in the leg. Dracona smiled in sati=\r\nsfaction. Plintissa tackled Dacona and took her down. Dracona once again tu=\r\nrned to her saw blade to saw into Plintissa. Dracona fired an ice beam, but=\r\n Plintissa dodged. Dracona started to burn everything with fire beams. Plin=\r\ntissa still avoids it. Plintissa was always a good fighter, but it wasn&#39;t u=\r\nntil now, after her bad life that she discovered her true fighting power. P=\r\nlintissa beat Dracona mercilessly. Draocona&#39;s parts were flung everywhere a=\r\ns Plintissa spun a simple stick through the air. Dracona raised the saw bla=\r\nde and sliced the stick to pieces. Dracona laughed and sliced Plintissa sev=\r\neral hundred times.

Plintissa grabbed her arm from=\r\n earlier and threw it. It hit Dracona&#39;s blade. Dracona slammed it into Plin=\r\ntissa, but as she did, the blade came loose before it hit Plintissa. The bl=\r\nade flew up. Dracona blinked her eye, the one Dinobot had scarred when she =\r\nfirst arived on the planet. The blade sawed through Dracona and left her in=\r\n pieces everywhere. Her spark extinguished. Her last words were:\n\n  &quot;*Cough=\r\n, Cough* Zardus I am sorry. Plintissa, do not forget your promise.&quot; And Dra=\r\ncona died smiling. Plintissa remembered that she promised Dracona that she =\r\nwould never leave her sitting. Plintissa cried. Her mech fluid ran everywhe=\r\nre and she got weaker and weaker. Artist stepped slowly over to Plintissa. =\r\nHe was crying, too.\n\n  &quot;Artist, I&#39;m sorry it had to end this way.&quot; Plintiss=\r\na whispered.\n\n  &quot;Why are you leaving me, Plintissa?

And the=\r\nre it was, sticking above ground now and burning away. Sinesis looks at the=\r\n base and sighs.\n\n  &quot;Twister, Dracona is dead, I guess we have to leave.&quot; S=\r\ninesis says. Sinister stands next to Blizzard and sighs.\n\n  &quot;Blizzard, we n=\r\need to find another home, now.&quot; Sinister said sadly.\n\n  Artist came closer =\r\nto Plintissa. Her spark suddenly burst from her and floated into Artist&#39;s h=\r\nands. She said to him what he needed to do. He opened his chest compartment=\r\n and his spark was revealed. Artist combined Plintissa&#39;s spark with his own=\r\n, they became one.\n\n  &quot;Till all are one.&quot; Artist whispered really low. Plin=\r\ntissa told him she still loved him. Artist was overjoyed! Plintissa was wit=\r\nh him now, and now they could never be seperated again. Artist, completely =\r\nignoring Blizzard and Sinister, and Sinesis and Twister. ran out into a fie=\r\nld.\n\n  &quot;Artist, now we need to take care of Dracona&#39;s spark.&quot; Plintissa sai=\r\nd.
