It read four aces, and a King. &quot;Read\n&gt; it and weep boys.&quot; He said smugly. Two other same sized robots were\n&gt; around him, the larger slammed their hands down. &quot;Damn it.&quot; He yelled\n&gt; yelled. &quot;Well Tiptop, Heater, fork over your energon tips.&quot; Caliburst\n&gt; said with a smile ear to ear. As the robot began to do it, Heater put\n&gt; his hands on the chips. &quot;Oh no, I don&#39;t lose at this kind of game.&quot; He\n&gt; said, laying down a royal flush in order.\n&gt;\n&gt; Slugslinger nursed his drink some more, and was now telling the robot\n&gt; who was desperate for it, a long ago story. Noises of robots shouting in\n&gt; the backround, something about cheatin. &quot;Well, I remember, I was against\n&gt; 30 of the finnest Autobot pilots, when I pulled an amazing barrel role,\n&gt; and gave em all instant air conditioning.&quot; he said, remembering back\n&gt; fondly. &quot;That&#39;s not how it went.&quot; A voice yelled from across the bar.\n&gt; Slugslinger looked up angrily, &quot;Who dares to interupt SLugslinger,\n&gt; Decepticon pilot.&quot; He yelled, and was met by a fist to the mouth, which\n&gt; sent him toppling over. Through bluring optics he looked up, angrily,\n&gt; then calmed down. &quot;Oh.. Hey Quake.&quot; he said, like the whole thing was\n&gt; normal.\n&gt;\n&gt; The one robot listening to Slugslinger got upset however. &quot;Hey, I was\n&gt; listening to him.&quot; He said, as he got up, and in Quake&#39;s face. &quot;Kid\n&gt; what&#39;s your name?&quot; Quake asked. &quot;Jagged, Why?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Cause Im gonna rearange your face punk.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
