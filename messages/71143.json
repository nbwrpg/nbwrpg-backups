He sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I understand Perceptor, no such action will be taken. Yet I do not intend\n&gt; for Hydras to get away with his crimes.  He may have retreated for now, \n&gt; but\n&gt; it&#39;s not enough.  I made a promise to all of you that tables would be\n&gt; turned.  I don&#39;t intend to go back on that promise by any means.

I was out of line.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot smirks.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s more like it.  Don&#39;t take it the wrong way Rodimus, Tucson&#39;s \n&gt; always\n&gt; had a nasty temper, even when he was just an average Autobot. I can \n&gt; remember\n&gt; a lotta bar room fights and all those times where he&#39;d smash a con&#39;s face \n&gt; to\n&gt; unrecognizable smitherines.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson also adds in his part.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;She&#39;s right, I never lost my temper around Autobots, only Decepticons. \n&gt; But\n&gt; I would get agitated with certain Autobots from time to time..  But that&#39;s\n&gt; as far as that went.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I remember that.  Sort of what Ratchet was like back in the days.  Great\n&gt; medic, Brilliant individual, but he also had a nasty temper. That kinda\n&gt; rubbed off on you big guy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Before I became a warrior, I do remember helping Ratchet periodically \n&gt; with\n&gt; Supply runs. I&#39;d get what he needed and deliver the goods safely back to \n&gt; the\n&gt; Iacon med bay.  Then, I&#39;d actually watch him repair damaged Autobots. \n&gt; When\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t fighting, I was using my spare time to restore old weaponry and\n&gt; artifacts.  I got to learn a lot about simple repair work, simply by\n&gt; watching Ratchet, and taking his good advice.  That was all before my\n&gt; unfortunate run in with Cyclonus.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks up to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Of course, when he was needed on the battlefield, Tucson was always \n&gt; there,\n&gt; on time, no matter where he was or what he was doing.  I guess his temper\n&gt; stems from the need to see a job well done all the way through.  Hydras is\n&gt; disrupting that sense of stability, and that&#39;s what&#39;s really making Tucson\n&gt; angry.  If given the opportunity, would you allow him to face Hydras once\n&gt; again, to try and even the score?  I really think he needs that if he&#39;s\n&gt; gonna find personal closure.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perce alter itoptor:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That isnt possible&quot;said Perceptor by comlink&quot;We willbe altering the\n&gt; &gt; history\n&gt; &gt; and hydras would have a better chance to capture Megatron&#39;s spark if he\n&gt; &gt; wants, as in Beast wars...

I&#39;m sorry.  Of course, no harm will come to anyone\n&gt; &gt; here, Legacy, Rodimus, excuse my actions, they were not done with the \n&gt; &gt; best\n&gt; &gt; of judgement.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to Tucson, and this time with a concerned look on \n&gt; &gt; her\n&gt; &gt; face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Ever since that day, you haven&#39;t been the same.  I know, I was there,\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; lemme tell ya it haunts me too.  Have ya ever thought ta open up about \n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; Tucson?  Maybe that would kinda help ya heal a little bit.  The wounds \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; still fresh, even though that fight was a long time ago.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; You&#39;re right.  Rodimus, Legacy, I&#39;ve been keeping something from you \n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; long time, and that&#39;s not what a respectable leader does.  A leader may \n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; strong but he too, must open up about the issues that weaken his state \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; mind.  It all started on the day of that battle, that had Rodimus \n&gt; &gt; abducted\n&gt; &gt; and taken over by Hydras and his forces.  I fought in that battle as a\n&gt; &gt; soldier. And being a Ninjabot myself, I knew of Nightrazor&#39;s properties,\n&gt; &gt; yet\n&gt; &gt; I felt that if I barged in on Rodimus, it would only land me with a case\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; insubordination.  So, I refrained from doing so, but tried to divert \n&gt; &gt; enemy\n&gt; &gt; attentions indirectly.  For the most part it worked and I was able to\n&gt; &gt; fight\n&gt; &gt; my way through those who knew nothing about Ninjabot combat.  Yet, there\n&gt; &gt; were seekers who were far more swift on their wings then I was on my\n&gt; &gt; wheels.\n&gt; &gt; They were bearing down on the Autobots, to the point that I felt that if \n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; did not step in, there wouldn&#39;t be an Autobot left to defend the Ark or\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; planet.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He pauses.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; From what I remember, I transformed into my vehicle mode, and started \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; kick up dirt from my tires, in hopes that a seeker would see what I was \n&gt; &gt; up\n&gt; &gt; to.  It worked, and I grabbed the attention of several, although I\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; see who they were because they were rather high up from me.  Then,\n&gt; &gt; suddenly,\n&gt; &gt; I was struck.  And I don&#39;t remember anything more than that.  A long \n&gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; afterwards, I was brought back online, and when I woke up, I could only\n&gt; &gt; see\n&gt; &gt; darkness.  At first, I thought it was a power outage, but then, I was \n&gt; &gt; told\n&gt; &gt; that my optic sensors were completely destroyed by the cranial shot that \n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; had endured during that chase.  I asked about you Rodimus, but, no one\n&gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; tell me what happened.  It was at that point where I knew that I failed\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; If only I had listened to myself the first time, and came in front of \n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; when you were chasing Nightrazor that first time.  You would not have\n&gt; &gt; suffered as you had, nor would your family. And since then, I pledged to\n&gt; &gt; get\n&gt; &gt; back on my feet, and never let my defenses down again, and if I had to,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; strike back harder than any Decepticon or Predacon could ever fathom.  I\n&gt; &gt; failed you once Rodimus, and I pledged NEVER to let that happen again.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to Tucson with a thoughtful gaze.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wow, you never even told me all that before.  Well, since we&#39;re opening\n&gt; &gt; up\n&gt; &gt; about it, I wish I could help you guys understand what happened, but I\n&gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; remember a little bit more than he does. Right before he got shot, I saw\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus decending just a tad closser to us than the other seekers that\n&gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; following us.  I saw him take the shot and I screamed, and that&#39;s when\n&gt; &gt; everything went blank.  I think what would really help Tucson now, is\n&gt; &gt; knowing that what happened, really wasn&#39;t his fault.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson now turns his head toward Megatron&#39;s body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Having the Decepticons here amongst us is highly un nerving to me.\n&gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; must be a way to separate them from the Autobots, and place them in a \n&gt; &gt; safe\n&gt; &gt; location...  Wait, I remember something..  The Decepticons had their own\n&gt; &gt; craft, The Nemisis...  Why couldn&#39;t we return them to their rightful \n&gt; &gt; craft\n&gt; &gt; and separate them from the Autobots, where both factions would be safe\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; harm?  Rodimus, due to circumbstances which I have just told you, for my\n&gt; &gt; own\n&gt; &gt; emotional stability, I can not have these Decepticons here.  But I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; willing\n&gt; &gt; to help preserve them in a safe location away from the Ark.  Legacy, if\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; could, I&#39;d like you to find out where the Nemisis is now located and if \n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; is within reach.  Once located, I want the Decepticons brought safely \n&gt; &gt; back\n&gt; &gt; to their own ship, where they can rest in peace, thus leaving the Ark to\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Autobots to do the same.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot smiles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Now that&#39;s more like the Tucson I know.  I like that idea, I like it\n&gt; &gt; alot.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside the Ark, Uproar and Quickstride look to each other and just \n&gt; &gt; shrug\n&gt; &gt; off the event.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hmm, oh well, would&#39;ve been fun ta see them end up in the tar pit but,\n&gt; &gt; works for me, Uproar.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ditto.  Okay, so, I guess we can go back inside.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They get into beast mode, and prance back into the Ark. Yet, Uproar \n&gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; not help but look back with a perplexed look on his face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras did a final shot and send a secret message to Nightrazor &quot;The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; door\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is open, time to leave&quot;and said in loud voice &quot;PREDACONS... \n&gt; &gt; &gt; RETREAT!!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras picked up inferno and started to leave the area\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Tuscon&#39;s] eyes narrow dangerously.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;THAT&#39;S IT!

PERIOD!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His voice echoes throught the Ark. With each word he rattles the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ark,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; voice booming like that of an angry lion. He was sick of the Predacons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Decepticon&#39;s attack on his Ark, and he holds his position over \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megatron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; awaits their response before doing anything to anyone. Yet, the arrow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remains pointed for a perfect shot to the fallen Megatron&#39;s chest!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He then turns his head to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I want you to know you have full permission to permanently disable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; predacons or Decepticons you see fit.

LOOK!&quot; he said, pointing at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who had picked up his fallen teammate and was already moving out of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ark.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At this same time Legacy also stepped into the room, coming from one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back corridors into the front. As a guardian, it was his job, his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; internal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directive to keep the Ark and all of its occupants safe, an imperative\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would also include even the Decepticons that were to wake up several\n&gt; &gt; &gt; million\n&gt; &gt; &gt; years later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy&#39;s single optic pulsed as he took in the scene, Hydras leaving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tuscon pointing a weapon at Megatron to ensure that he did so.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;NONE OF THE ARK&#39;S OCCUPANTS ARE TO COME TO HARM.&quot; Legacy said, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; falling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his old coldly logical voice. His voice sounded nothing if not more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; formal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his tones frigid, his words clear as crystal, and his stance firm and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resolved. Legacy pointedly glanced at Straight Shot and then back at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tuscon,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;TO PUT OUR FUTURE IN JEOPARDY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE IS NOT \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ACCEPTABLE.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PErceptor gain control of the ark and activate all the internal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defences\n&gt; &gt; &gt; against the Hydra&#39;s predacons and tried to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As preceptor worked, the Ark began to respond to his commands as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; weapons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; began to activate, internal defenses systems came online.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;What is your command?&quot; Teletran 1 asked Perceptor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MEANWHILE IN THE MEDICAL BAY:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight continue peacefully sleeping while Elita jumped on the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her beast form and nuzzled in her mom&#39;s cheek while she cried in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; silence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mommie&quot;said Elita&quot; I miss you so much... so much&quot;sobbed the little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while her tears fell in her mom&#39;s cheek\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight continued to sleep, as all around her the machines \n&gt; &gt; &gt; registered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as resting in a comma like state. All of her systems seemed otherwise \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stable condition.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus looked at Nightlight and Elita, a soft look on his face.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then Tuscon&#39;s voice boomed through, threatening the Predacons. &quot;SLAG!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus said as he glanced back at Elita, &quot;You stay here.&quot; Ramulus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to lock you in and then go see if anything can be done for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; medical staff.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus spoke as he quickly gathered up a few med packs and a scanner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Danged daft Predacons, causing so much damage.&quot; Ramulus grumbled \n&gt; &gt; &gt; under\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breath. Ramulus was no medic, but he did know a bit about first aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there was something he could so for Santon and Bump who were still \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the floor of the corridors. Perhaps they were not as . . . hurt as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; looked. He couldn&#39;t even bring himself to think of them as dead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With a last look at Elita he left. The door clicked as he locked it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the room that Elita was in went silent except for the computer \n&gt; &gt; &gt; monitors\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were watching over Nightlight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For the moment all was peaceful in the medbay.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However outside the Ark was a very different matter!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord and Kup keep their fire against Scourge and Deepstrike\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As the firefight continues Deepstryke took a hit, as did Scourge,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them to break off their attack on the door and swing up into the air \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; avoid any further and more critical damage. Several more of the sweeps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blasted from the skies, the last one swinging up next to his master\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Scourge,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; almost as if for protection.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Predacons were looking decidedly more damaged and a bit more tired\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before. Energon looked to be looking a bit lower than before and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from Windlord and Kup were building up on them, not to mention the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; firepower\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coming from the fuzors as well as Leo II! Yes, the Predacons had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breached\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the door, but getting further in would be an uphill battle indeed, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of them did not look to be in the best shape to fight it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Outside, Quickstride quickly gets Uproar to his feet, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assesses the situation. He then looks around the parameters and then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remembers a body of goop, that resembled a tar pit, not far from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ark&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parameters. Uproar looks to him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *&lt;SNIP/CUT/PASTE&gt;*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar and Quickstride now approach Deep Stryke and the others with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hands up in submission. Quickstride is the first to approach them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deepstryke hovered in the air as he noticed the two walked towards \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cannons swiveling to track them when they spoke . . .\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, okay, you got us, you got us. Why don&#39;t we just show you guys\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy way inta the ark hmm? That way we all get what we want and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happy.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You, a Maximal would show a Predacon a way into his own fortress?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deepstryke said, obviously not believing the two for a moment, and yet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t shoot at them either. Perhaps there was a part of him that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; WANTED\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe it. Then Hydras&#39; call went out to retreat!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Blast you Maximal!&quot; Deepstryke said as he began to pull back. &quot;NEXT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; TIME\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will breach your walls and TAKE what we want!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Predacons began to back up, moving into the air, slowly moving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; away\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Ark, even as the Ark&#39;s cannons and weaponry began to move and come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; online.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
