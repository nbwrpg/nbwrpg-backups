His animal form was nocturnal, and didn&#39;t like \nbright lights!  And that damn star (the Sun) was blazing right into his \nsensetive optic sensors.  When he got back to base, he&#39;d have to do something \nabout them.\n\nHe thought a little longer, two thirds of the way to the Iron Fist and \nrelocated Alliance Base.  He looked to his right at Scattershot, who was \nchasing a fish near the surface of the water.\n\nNemesis sighed at the bald eagle, opening a comlink to Zardus.\n&quot;Zardus, it&#39;s Nemesis Enforcer.  I&#39;ve been thinking about things, and I think \nwe need to make a few modifications to the defenses of the island.&quot;\n\n&quot;First, I was wondering if the shields which cover the island go all the way \ndown to the bottom of the sea bed?  If not, people could swim under the \nshields and gain access, possible.  Now, to combat that possibility, I was \nthinking making it possible for the shields touch down to the sea bed.  Also, \nwe could have underwater mines and torpedo tubes underwater.&quot;\n\nNemesis awaited for a response, raising in altitude twenty feet, not wanting \nScattershot to hear him.\n\n"}}
