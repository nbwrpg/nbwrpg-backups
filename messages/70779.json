Hydras has gone too far and has paid no price for h=\r\nis actions.  Those days are over.  He may think he has won, but this battle=\r\n has not even started.  And I&#39;m NOT walking away without a fight.  Not this=\r\n time.  And not ever again.  He&#39;s done far too much damage and has even att=\r\nempted to fracture a family, and emotionally harming an innocent child, by =\r\ntaking away the ones she loves the most.  That is my final straw.&quot;\n\nStraigh=\r\nt Shot looks up to him.\n\n&quot; With a name like yours, it was bound ta come ta =\r\nthis sooner or later.  You didn&#39;t get that name for nothing.  Even when you=\r\n weren&#39;t a Prime, you were still as tough as nails, even if you weren&#39;t the=\r\n largest Autobot on the team.  Rodimus is lucky ta have ya fighting beside =\r\nhim as a Prime.  Now with the two of you putting your feet down, you&#39;ll hav=\r\ne him running in the opposite direction with his tail between his legs, lit=\r\nerally. And Rodimus, now that I think of it, As I do for Tucson, my weapon =\r\nalt modes will also work for you in the event that Tucson is unfit to wield=\r\n me.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s right.  If anything happens to me, you are the=\r\n one chosen to wield Straight Shot.  She will not let you down, her aim is =\r\nimpecable, and she never misses her target.

He&#39;s trying very hard to become one of us, but \n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nere are a few of our comrades who do not have as much faith as we do. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFaith is important if we&#39;re going to combat Hydras.

Faith.  We have that wit=\r\nh each other, but when it comes to those \n&gt; &gt; who are trying to turn over a=\r\n new leaf, I see a lack of it.  I can not \n&gt; &gt; stress enough on the importa=\r\nnce of all around faith in each other.  If we \n&gt; &gt; do not have that, we are=\r\n not ready to confront our worst enemy.  Rodimus \n&gt; &gt; would surely agree wi=\r\nth me, that faith is of the essence, because at \n&gt; &gt; first, I too was distr=\r\nustful of Rodimus once he had been freed of the \n&gt; &gt; shell program.  But no=\r\nw I see where that distrust would have gotten me, \n&gt; &gt; and I too had to com=\r\ne around and give faith a chance.  I know we can do \n&gt; &gt; that, we&#39;re Autobo=\r\nts and Maximals.  We believe in each other, and now, \n&gt; &gt; among us, is a Pr=\r\nedacon who has shown great courage by helping us here \n&gt; &gt; now.  Please, do=\r\n not let distrust weaken your faith.

Before I was rendered bli=\r\nnd, we&#39;d do many\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; missions side by side.  Of course, him being Hot Ro=\r\nd, a sports vehcile \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me, an average compact SUV, off road=\r\ning vehicle, with no interest in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; speed, we&#39;d often kid each other ab=\r\nout speed versus rugged durability \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; over\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; off road terrain.  O=\r\nne day, we were driving toward a mission to stop\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Galvatron&#39;s path of=\r\n destruction, when our path got blasted by unknown\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; enemy fire.  We k=\r\nnew we couldn&#39;t let a rock slide stop us, and we \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I k=\r\nnew I could&#39;ve just drove over it, and gotten to the other side with \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; no\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problem. But Rodimus wasn&#39;t built for that in his alt form.  We=\r\n never \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; left\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; each other&#39;s side that day.  We found a way to g=\r\net around that obsticle\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; together, even though we had conflicting ide=\r\nas on how to do it, but,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; eventually we did compromise and we thwarte=\r\nd Galvatron with the aid of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other Autobots.  Sometimes o=\r\npposites work well together, and Rodimus\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; proved it that day.  I gues=\r\ns that&#39;s what drove me to rescue him. I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t think of how I woul=\r\nd manage, if I had not had him by my side.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He gently rubs El=\r\nita&#39;s shoulders.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I wish I could remember what happened to Bu=\r\nmblebee and Spike, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kremzeem, but after I was rendered off line f=\r\nor several vorns, I lost a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; good portion of my memory. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Like Rodimus, Tucson&#39;s gentile embrace takes on a paternal aspect.

Are our origins\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a=\r\nlike?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If so, is there a direction I should be going toward? On=\r\ne that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; help me to guide the Autobots and Ma=\r\nximals to finding the road\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; toward\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; peaceful exista=\r\nnce? If anyone would know these answers, you \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He puts a tiny orb of his own spark into a container, and=\r\n gives \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an offering to Optimus=\r\n Prime.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The body and form=\r\n of Optimus Prime remained absolutely still, there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was no discer=\r\nnable movement from him, no spark of energy, no sign \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; recognition of any type. It could be that the Matrix energy that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; had\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; been animate before has been temporarily used up, or p=\r\nerhaps the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; situation now was not sufficiently critical so as to =\r\ncall it into\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; being. In either case Optimus prime looked, for all=\r\n intents and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; purposes, as dead as any robot can appear and still=\r\n be awaiting a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rebirth in another few million years.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
