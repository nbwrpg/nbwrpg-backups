It seemed \nkinda fair since JP got 5 Inferno clones in the past.\n\nI agree that the lack of specification is getting really \nannoying. &quot;Firing at the enemy&quot; or &quot;Firing at some Alliance members&quot; \nisn&#39;t good form. Also, &quot;Firing at all the Alliance members&quot; can imply \nthat your character is spinning in circles and firing through walls, \nso please be SPECIFIC!\n\nAlso, KSL has authorized my use of Unitron.\n\n::The Oblitercons/Deamon Wulf/Dark Claw/Flesh Ripper/Six \nShot/Ares/Manterror/Injector/BumbleBee/Double \nPunch/Unitron/Zardus/FZ/Perndabot::\n\nDark One rolls in the air, dodging a few shots, several of them \nhitting him. Dodging some gatling fire, he turns in time to see \nDestructor grabb KitKat.\n\n&quot;Kill the wolf femm,&quot; he says over his comm-link to his troops, \nlaunching two signature seeking missiles at KitKat.\n\n(I don&#39;t think the part of the battle involving KitKat should be \ncontinued untill Logo posts if KitKat was grabbed or not. So next \npost on this should be hers.)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe arrow hits near Pyro, the Oblitercon ignoring the pain as he aims \nhis gun at KitKat on Dark One&#39;s orders and opens fire, sending a few \nfireballs flying at her.\n\nA rocket hits near him, charring the side of him a bit.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn HUMVEE mode, Scavenger drives toward Destructor and KitKat, firing \ndozens of rapid laser shots at KitKat.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTransforming into his artillery cannon mode, Breakdown aims his \nweapons at KitKat, firing a few laser shots as well as a missile at \nthe femm.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHiss, in Robot mode, runs toward KitKat, firing at her from his gun.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDark Claw growls as an arrow hits near him, not being affected by the \nvirus due to his advanced form. He aims his sword at Pestilance, the \nblade detatching and flying as a missile at the bot, a new blade \nreplacing it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFlesh Ripper stumbles back from an explosion in front of him, \nlaughing as he puts his palms together, launching the ball of energy \nit forms at Disease.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nManterror yells as pain from the virus goes through him, taking him \nout of the battle for a few seconds.\n\nHe manages to roll out of the way of a rocket, the explosion sending \nhim flying.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCloaking after getting up from weapon fire, Double Punch looks up as \nDarkFate flies in, firing two missiles at the bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nInjector jupms away as he sees an arrow hit nearby, the virus not \nreaching him. He runs after the horsement, firing stinger missiles \nafter them.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSixShot barrel rolls in the air, dodging weapon fire and launching \ntwo missiles at War.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nYelling in pain as the virus surges through him, Ares is thrown to \nthe ground by an explosion.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBumbleBee flies toward DragonFly, firing a missile at the bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus frowns as the Iron Fist reports the stage the battle is in, \ntapping his comm.\n\n&quot;Deemos, have your group engage the enemy. Kill as many as you can. \nUnitron, go intercept any fleeing bots.&quot;\n\nHe frowns as he sees Perndabot on the scanners again. &quot;Perndabot, go \nto the coordinates I&#39;m sending you, back up the Alliance members.&quot;\n\nSending a mental command to FZ to go and also back up the Alliance, \nZardus watches Unitron fly off and head toward the battle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRecieving Zardus&#39; transmission, Panzertron looks over at BrightBlade.\n\n&quot;Hey, there&#39;s a battle I&#39;m needed on, lets go, you can join in too!&quot;\n\nHe takes off at a run toward the battle, then activating his jetpack \nand flying toward it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ looks up as he recieves Zardus&#39; orders.\n\n&quot;I must go, Zardus calls,&quot; he says to Squizzy, running out of the \nroom and out of the IF, launching off toward the battle.\n\n\n"}}
