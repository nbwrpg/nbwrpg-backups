He sensed something \n&gt; was terribly wrong and that Rodimus was in danger.  And it wasn&#39;t by the \n&gt; Decepticons or Predacons.  A new enemy. It was all he needed.  But this \n&gt; time he was not going to put up with scrap.  It was the one thing that \n&gt; separated him from Optimus Prime.  His temper was slightly shorter than \n&gt; his mentor&#39;s.  His power levels spike quickly due to his change in temper.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong.  I haven&#39;t come to feed anyone!

Whether or not \n&gt; it would hit his target was completely unknown.  He was dangerous when \n&gt; angry.  Straight Shot, whenever she traveled with him would be sure not to \n&gt; push any of his buttons the wrong way.  She could now sense that her \n&gt; brother was having one of those bad mood fits.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Uhh ohh, he&#39;s in that mood again...  Perceptor, guys, if I were you I&#39;d \n&gt; shield your audio sensors.  You - don&#39;t wanna be too close when he blows a \n&gt; fuse.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride nodds as he covers his ears.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I remembered the last time he blew a fuse. She&#39;s right, you don&#39;t wanna \n&gt; be anywhere near him when he&#39;s angry.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Who: LEGACY, Tuscon, Perceptor, Talon, Straight Shot, Quickstride\n&gt;&gt; Location: Deep Earth caverns not far from the Black Fortress\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; We know you&#39;re approaching our location.

Here along the path, according to the reports,\n&gt;&gt; there had been a chamber that at that time had distinctive minion\n&gt;&gt; signature. However the report also reported that at last scan that\n&gt;&gt; chamber had been filling with magma, but now sensors were picking up\n&gt;&gt; something very different from that specific location.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; While no one was close enough to see it, it was still nearly a quarter\n&gt;&gt; of a mile down the tunnel, sensors showed this area to be an open\n&gt;&gt; area, one that stretched several hundred meters in diameter, and was a\n&gt;&gt; perfect circle. From within this chamber Rodimus Prime&#39;s signature\n&gt;&gt; could be made out, although it did not appear that he was conscious at\n&gt;&gt; the moment judging from his low energy output. Strangely his signature\n&gt;&gt; seemed to be a bit muffled as if something were covering it or\n&gt;&gt; attempting to remove it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also from that larger chamber there is the signature of something\n&gt;&gt; truely alien. It was not Predacon, Decepticon, Autobot or Maximal, but\n&gt;&gt; it was technological life none the less.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From in front of the group, just outsdie the range of Tuscon&#39;s lights\n&gt;&gt; step figures, six of them nearly identicle to the ones that the group\n&gt;&gt; had already seen before. Insectile and alien they were as big as full\n&gt;&gt; grown lions. However a seventh is there as well. It looked much the\n&gt;&gt; same as the first ones, but was larger, nearly as large as the tunnel\n&gt;&gt; itself and about as large as an elephant.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You have come to feed the mistress.&quot; said the larger of the figures,\n&gt;&gt; its voice hissing as it did so. &quot;Good. Your technological\n&gt;&gt; distinctiveness will be added to our own, and we will become\n&gt;&gt; stronger.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The creatures continued out of the darkness and into the light, thier\n&gt;&gt; bladed feet echoing oddly as they sliced through rubble and rock to\n&gt;&gt; attack!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
