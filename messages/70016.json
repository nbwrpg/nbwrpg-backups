However\nhe grunted as one caught him in the arm, the sound of metal on metal\nringing painfully for a moment.\n\nCrimson optics focused painfully on Nightshift as he reached over and\nby force he ripped the metal blade out of his arm, and with a deft\nflick of the wrist sent it spinning through the air!\n\nNightshift&#39;s own shuriken went flying back at him!\n\nScorponok, unlike Scourge made no effort to avoid the blades. Unlike\nthose of lesser structure, the mighty Neo-Decepticon simply brushed\nthem away, using his mighty claws like a human would against gnats.\nWhile one managed to strike, it was unable to penetrate his dense\narmor.\n\n&quot;Is that all you got?? Stick pins??&quot; Scorponok smiled grimly, &quot;This\nwill be easier than I thought!&quot;\n\nScorponok continued to fire at Nightshift with plasma cannons!\n\nEven as they spoke the security doors rumbled and began to close all\naround the base as well as at the throne room!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
