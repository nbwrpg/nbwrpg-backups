He may not be able to hold up in a tough battle with the Dinobots bu=\r\nt he is still able to scoot out of the way when it depends on his life.  He=\r\n doesn&#39;t intend to attack, he&#39;s just defending himself.  And yeah, there is=\r\n an earthquake going on but agility was something he studied and worked har=\r\nd on, so perhaps he may stumble a slight but he does know how to right hims=\r\nelf by practicing balance.  A big focus in Kung Fu and Ninjutsu .  \n\nThe cr=\r\nouching maneuver was something I learned from watching a lot of Kung Fu mov=\r\nies.  First, potential energy is stored in the muscles and then the result =\r\nis the release of that energy, making it Kinetic energy, and that&#39;s what Tu=\r\ncson was doing.  Not quite on his knees, but on his feet.  And from there, =\r\nhe&#39;s able to launch his body straight up, releasing the Kinetic energy stor=\r\ned in his body.   I hope this makes it easier to understand.

Yet the tip of his left wing still =\r\ntakes some damage, Tucson\n&gt;&gt; does manage to literally dodge the bullet.\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Not bad, so close but yet so far.
