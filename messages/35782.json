The other\n&gt; half, the\n&gt; &gt; mechanical one, in a final fight over organic life and it&#39;s future\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; Cyberetron proved a failure for the organic bot.  In the battle\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; raged against each other.  With a qucik snap of his wrist the\n&gt; organic\n&gt; &gt; bot lashed his special energon whips across his arch-enemy&#39;s face,\n&gt; &gt; blinding him instantly. He remembers how the bot crazed, firing al\n&gt; over\n&gt; &gt; the place, and with a crazy shot it all went black for the\n&gt; protector of\n&gt; &gt; organic life.  The shot had put his spark into stasis lock. What\n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; happened to his foe, his evil half, he did not know.
