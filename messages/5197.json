Someone really dosent like me up there!\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Winter. Hell Beast hated the season of white death as much as he hated\n&gt; the Maximals. The white shroud would envelop the valley, and that was not\n&gt; good news for any Predacon, be they in the Predacons, Newcomers, or\nMegatrons\n&gt; little group. With the dark colored armor the predacons had, they would\nsurly\n&gt; stick out in the whiteness of nature in the next few months. And, the snow\n&gt; was beginning to fall. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast, his breath visable, turned to adress his crew :::\nPredacons,\n&gt; it is with deep remorse that I must say we are in Winter. It is going to\nbe\n&gt; alot harder for us, because of our armor color. But I think we will endure\n&gt; whatever comes our way.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Gremlin ::: Yes, but we failed at the destruction of the Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast :: No, if we had destroyed it the Autobots would have lost\nthe\n&gt; war. The Decepticons would then rule the Galaxy, and Predacons would have\n&gt; never been created.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Transanulas ::: Those sound like the words of a traitor.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Youre one to talk about traitors, achacnid.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Transanulas looked down and said nothing. The other predacons\nlistened.\n&gt; :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: So, what do we do now?\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: We continue as we did before. Nothing changes.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Marine, in the back holding a sack, ::: Do you want the materials we\n&gt; salvaged from the maximal base?\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast nodded. Marine spilled the contents onto a table. They were\n&gt; nothing really they could use at all. But Hell Beast commended Maine for\nhis\n&gt; intuition to get them. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast turned to look out the window, the meeting was at an end.\nAll\n&gt; the Predacons returned to there posts, except for Jackle and Inferno who\nwent\n&gt; out on a perimiter patrol. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Standing there, thinking about Vuloris, Battera, Megatron, Koga Shuko.\n&gt; ...Hell Beast sighed. Things would get better. After all, his fraction was\n&gt; the biggest and most powerful in the Beast Wars. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Pheniox, bring Rat Trap up here. I have an idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: pheniox nodded, and after a brief pause she brought the vermine to the\n&gt; bridge. ::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Ah, Rat Trap. Looking well.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Rat Trap ::: Ah, can it Hell Beast! You havent fed me in days!\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Yes, well....can you blame me?\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Rat Trap ::: Yeah, for alot of stuff!\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast smiled ::: I have a job for you. If you refuse, you will\ndie.\n&gt; If you accept, I will grant you your freedom. Clear?\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Rat Trap ::: Im listening...\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Excellent.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Need a credit card?\n&gt; Instant Approval and 0% intro APR with Aria!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6034/13/_/_/_/962296922/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
