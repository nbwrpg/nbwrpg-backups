Hey! Guess what in these post I make my first kill! \nChild kills someone This is pretty important but its also pretty Good so \nplease read it!\n\n:::Child sees the bots, they are big and devastatingly evil looking. child \nfeels vulois&#39;s arm and gets strength. He Steps forward after Vulois had \nspoken:::\n\nChild; &quot;You will flee before our wrath! leave This Mountain or Die!!!&quot;\n\n:::AngelNemisis disregards Child and looks at the bot who was obviously \nVulois:::\n\nAngel: &quot;You pathetic creature You think you can defeat me? Do you Know Who I \nam? I an AngelNemisis, The creator of the Nightmare, You&#39;re Matrix powers \nwill wither under the Power of the Third God! Yes... There are more Gods then \nJust the Matrix and the pitt, There are in between gods, The most Powerful is \nthe creator of the Voc and he has blessed us with immense Power!&quot;\n\n:::Gardein Spoke to Child:::\n\nGardein: &quot;Your Father was one of us you know. And we are ten times stronger \nthen him. You, we will spare but we will strip you of all your power... Good \nnight little Angel.&quot;\n\n:::With that Gardein let rip a pearcing scream and unfolded her wings, She \ngathered Energy from every existing voc in the Galaxy and Put it in her body. \nThe energy became fier and she threw the Raging inferno of energy down at the \nchild. Child Stood still letting the Fire burn him. He let it stop and then \nlooked up at the evil creature. He began to sing. His notes filled with sweet \nharmony and peace the world grew alight again and Light filled the mountain. \nThen the light began to gather around Gardien. Child stooped singing and \nOpened his chest panel. There was a whorl wind of energy and in screamed \ntowards Gardien. Gardein saw it coming and then every thing went black. And \nher spark disolved. Child Watched as the bot exploded in white light and fell \nas ashes onto the floor. She was dead:::\n\nChild: &quot;So.. Are you still up to the chalenge of defending the Mountain \nNemmesis?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHerald desides not to give the presentation he enters the CF and gose looking \nfor ArcAngel. He says over the comm:::\n\nHerald: &quot;ArcAngle... Where are you, you said you wanted to talk?&quot;\n\n"}}
