Everything in unpacked. Windrazor, Terradive and I will\n&gt; move everything to the new base. Child Eagle Eye and Afterburner will\n&gt; stay here and protect the stuff, because it will tkae many trips.\n&gt; Than finaly we will bring everybody in and we will put everything\n&gt; together again there. Alright? Good. Windazor and Terradive, get an\n&gt; armful of junk and follow me!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois picked up some computer boards and flew off towards his ship.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix and Fliq loaded the boards into the shuttle, and than turned to\n&gt; Ramulus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Load your stuff in the back, and than we have a question to discuss.\n&gt; We only have enough room for Hull or Weapons.

If only I\n&gt; hadn&#39;t been meditating, we would&#39;ve been side by side on the front\n&gt; line, like you promised. I&#39;m so sorry!(He turned to Drillbit.) Is the\n&gt; battle over? Did I miss it?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (Some people may get mad at the way I&#39;m portraying Starscream, since\n&gt; he&#39;s supposed to be ruthless and uncaring. Well this is the way I\n&gt; want to. He&#39;s changed and learned alot from wandering the Universe.
