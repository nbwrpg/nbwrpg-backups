He laid \ndown in the shade of a nearby tree. The breeze was warm, but it still \nfelt good blowing through his fur. the wind became stronger, he \ncaught a scent in the air. An odd smell, but still a recognizable \nsmell. A combination of Mech fluid and exaust. something about it \ndidn&#39;t smell right. He knew they weren&#39;t alone.\n\nQuickly he stood up, looking in the direction of the scent, he saw \nlittle movement, which only meant they didn&#39;t want to be discovered. \n\nLunarpine turned and sprinted into the Ark calling out over his \ninternal comm unit, &quot; Lunarpine to Prowl,, we have company......&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Prowl/Striker/Ramulus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl nods slowly, letting what Bluestreak had said sink in.
