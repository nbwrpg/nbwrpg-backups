If you open fire on them \nnow, \n&gt; they can easily be terminated; they look to be missiles, but they \nseem \n&gt; to be heading towards the Ark.&quot; His hatch open&#39;s slightly. &quot;We&#39;ll \nhave \n&gt; to return to the base... take care of our trailers quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade is thrown across the storage room as the shrapnel and \n&gt; plasma bombard the ship. &quot;Uhh.&quot; He growns as he gets to his feet, \n&gt; &quot;Astroblast, watch where you&#39;re going next time,&quot; he stomps back to \n&gt; his place, grumbling about bad drivers and stuff.\n&gt; ------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Airly, Razorclaw pounced at Khonkolor again. (also, Razorclaw \nis \n&gt; in Lion mode right now, that&#39;s why he&#39;s pouncing) =)\n&gt; \n&gt; Razorclaw misses his pounce, and dodges left, a trail of machine \ngun \n&gt; fire following him. He snarls, then fakes right and rushes \nKhonkolor, \n&gt; hind legs pumping, and his claws outstreched. \n&gt; ------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Tantrum&#39;s body lands beside Rampage, &quot;Oh no, I&#39;m gonna have to save \n&gt; your hide as well?&quot; Rampage grabs Tantrum, and leaps into flight, a \n&gt; grenade from Epyon exploding underneath him, and he almost drops \nthe \n&gt; wreckage he&#39;s carrying.\n&gt; ------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Divebomb has returned to the CF battle, and is in flight a ways \nabove \n&gt; the base. &quot;BOMBS AWAY, haha haaaa,&quot; he launches two large bombs at \nthe \n&gt; CF.\n\n\n"}}
