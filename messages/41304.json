(OOC:)\n&gt;Date: Sun, 5 Aug 2001 19:29:13 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;Just because four bots rode him doesnt mean he got any bigger. Making your\n&gt;bot grow to 80 feet long is cheap and should be illegal. he could crush\n&gt;someone, no matter if hes 80 feet long or tall. It simply isnt fair. And If \n&gt;I\n&gt;use your reasoning I guess I can make Gemini Dragon grow to well over 125\n&gt;feet tall simply because its a gestalt and suddenly it can grow. And not\n&gt;everything that was legal before is legal now. Shooting weapons fire \n&gt;heading\n&gt;at your charachter was once legal and is now illegal. Seeking weapons were\n&gt;once legal, now they aren&#39;t.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
