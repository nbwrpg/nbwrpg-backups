She was just a field soldier with a fancy name!\nShe looked at Rhinox but then turned her head towards Striker as she heard him greeting some new visitor, but then a clouded look came into her optics when she heard the visitor mention that their name was...Dinobot? How could that be? They already had a Dinobot.\nIron Raptor then growled deeply, speaking of their Dinobot, where was he? And that fembot Tavatron, the one she had first met when coming to the Ark?\nShe then activated her scanners and searched the ship for them, no place to be found, she then widened the range of her scanners to the external of the ship. It wasn&#39;t more then a few nano-clicks before she located their energy signatures, moving deeper into a near by forest and...farther away from the ship!\nWith that Iron Raptor looked at Striker, hoping that she would have caught his optics by now. The look she gave him said to not comment of the stranger&#39;s name because for all they knew it could be a defect in the programming or just a bot that had the same name. But just in case it was wise to call their own Dinobot into the meeting, just to see if this bot was confused or something more. But the main point was to keep quiet about it. She then looked at Prowl the same way before turning back towards the stranger.\nShe then opened her communicator to Tavatron&#39;s frequency and spoke into it.*\n\n&quot; Tavatron, my scanners indicate both of you moving AWAY from the base. There&#39;s a meeting at the moment and it would be very nice if you to would join us, please?&quot;\n\n* With that she deactivated her com-link but had it on a setting that if Tavatron replied it would simply be heard internally and not by everybot in the room.\nIron Raptor then turned to the new bot that she seemed to recognize from the Alliance attack, it had been with that other raptor if she remembered correctly.\nShe looked at Prowl in the corner of her optic to see what he thought about this new bot that seemed to have an, all to familiar, name. It was strange she had to admit but it was still a bot none the less.\nIron Raptor then gestured towards the stranger and then to the seats and the room in general.*\n\n&quot; Then one such as yourself is most welcome here...Dinobot. Please, come in.&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
