I&#39;m coming back soon, and I have some\n&gt; questions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.  Would Winged Warrior, and whoever I gave\n&gt; Flicker\n&gt; &gt; to (can&#39;t remember who) like to keep them?  I\n&gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know about Owlhawk, but based on the number of\n&gt; posts\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen baring Flickers name he&#39;s been developed\n&gt; &gt; alot.  I&#39;d be perfectly happy giving them up, in\n&gt; fact\n&gt; &gt; I have another idea for a char that will either be\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; undisputed coolest char I have ever made, or be\n&gt; &gt; instantly banned in a unamimous vote by the\n&gt; council. \n&gt; &gt; Which brings me to question two.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2.
