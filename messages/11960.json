No one is. Zardus just maintains the\n&gt; website and he can&#39;t give you the position because he is not the Predacon\n&gt; Commander only Blackarachnia or Megatron can give you that position. In\nfact\n&gt; the last second in command who probably is the real one is BrightBlade.\nYou\n&gt; are such a fucking liar.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
