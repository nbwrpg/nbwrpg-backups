However, it was this battle that he would try to remain clean from gashes and the possibility of being gored.  With his attention now on the chaos all around him, he barely even acknowledged Tavatron&#39;s speech before moving towards the Cybertronian Fire like he had instructed moments ago. However, sensing that her presence wasn&#39;t near, his scanners wavered towards the Maximal ship, discovering her form before turning them back towards the battle. Suddenly his instincts slipped, the ultra-aggressive tendencies of his highly unstable transmetal 2 form zeroed in on the first of an enemy, which might catch his attention.\r\nDinobot had not chosen this prey on his own, though his beast mode had played too large a role in doing so then would be wise for comfort. However, it&#39;s selection was nothing he could argue with, for, he agreed fully.\r\nFireBlade.\r\nIn yet, the dastardly creature was almost half way across the battlefield from his current position, but distracted so Dinobot might gain the objective of surprise after all. Though he would never depend on such luck, so any way to gain ground on that person was ticking through his mind.   With Tavatron out of the way for concern there was nothing stopping him from waging his own war, though he wanted to make it to FireBlade&#39;s position without having to contend with other enemies which might threaten to take his concentration away from his true objective.\r\nIt was then that Dinobot began to move across the field, however, in a way so that no others would notice him.\r\nStealth was a prime factor, and it wasn&#39;t long before FireBlade came within firearm striking distance.\r\nDinobot raised the weapon he held in his claws,yet, charged and fired the paralyzing effects of his optic laser before firing with the gun.  The enemy would be rendered defenseless before his ruin became a reality. **\r\n\r\n( Carnage: If any of my post is not correct, please feel free to right my wrongs.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
