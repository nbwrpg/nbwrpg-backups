Fully expecting the fighter \nto dodge an attack in the posistion they are in Hellpeon sped off to \nthe other side while he opened fire on him with a large beam of \nChaochitan energy.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; Ultimo tried to dodge to the left but one of hte beams hit his \n&gt; shoulder ripping through it.  His arm hung limp at his side.  &quot;Now \nI \n&gt; am mad&quot;, he said as he transformed into his griffon mode.  The \n&gt; giant griffon flew at Hellpeon.  As he opened his mouth, a large \n&gt; blast of plasma flew out heading for Hellpeon.\n\n\n"}}
