He barely dodged an EMP blast, cursing.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m always the main target!&quot; he yelled, firing down to missiles at\nTeltoli.\n&gt; His bottom was down towards the ground, so he was not effected by the\nflare.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Breakdown transformed into his artillery mode, firing off a shell at the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire.  The flare went off, but since Breakdown didn&#39;t have\nany\n&gt; optics in this form, he was unharmed.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Pyro transformed to tank mode, firing off three fire balls at Hot Rod,\n&gt; driving for him.  &quot;You&#39;re going down traitor!&quot;  Being in a tank form, he\nwas\n&gt; not effected by the flare.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Hiss energized his fusion cannon.  He ducked down, as his optics were\nblinded\n&gt; by the flare.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scavenger laughed as the flare went off.  He remembered the last time\nMagnus\n&gt; had tossed a flare, and had prepared himself.  He fired off 25 explosive\n&gt; rounds at Magnus, charging at full speed.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Sixshot dived downard, avoiding most of the shots, some clipping his back\n&gt; dorsal fin.  He yelled out in an attempt of intimidation, firing off ten\n&gt; rapid laser blasts at Aerotaur.  His bottom was pointed to the ground, so\nthe\n&gt; flare had no effect.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark Claw drove up to the scene of the battle, launching off two missiles\nat\n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire, the weapons exploding against the shields.  The\nflare\n&gt; went off, and a cycle later out popped his brethren, Demon Wulf and Flesh\n&gt; Ripper.\n&gt;\n&gt; Demon Wulf touched to the ground, raising his sword to point at Gabriel,\nand\n&gt; firing off a blade missile at him, the blade of his sword being replaced\nin\n&gt; less than a second.\n&gt;\n&gt; Flesh Ripper fired off ten rapid optic blasts at Rex, walking towards the\n&gt; Maximal with his teeth showing and his claws outstretched from his finger\n&gt; tips.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Double Punch saw autogun fire hit near him, trying to hit a fellow\nAlliance\n&gt; member next to him (Godfather).  He saw Teltoli open fire on Godfather,\nand\n&gt; raised both pinchers, and smiled to himself while in his stealth mode.\n&quot;Bye,\n&gt; bye...&quot; he cursed and covered his optics as the flare went off, still\n&gt; invisible though.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Manterror covered his optics, but soon regained his composure, firing down\n&gt; two ion disks at Caitiff.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Injector dived, but the flare blinded him, sending him slamming into the\n&gt; ground, an EMP blast hitting his knee joint and making his leg useless\n&gt; temporarily.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Bumblebee averted his eyes from the flash, and awaited until it cleared.\nHe\n&gt; fired down a total of six stinger missiles at the Cybertronian Fire, three\n&gt; from each weapon.  He watched them explode against the shields, and then\n&gt; dodged autogun fire.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Ares transformed to tank mode.  But in midtransformation, the flare went\noff\n&gt; and blinded him, so he collapsed, holding his optics, in\nmidtransformation.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Serpentor slithered, transforming into biped mode and charging, seeing\nMagnus\n&gt; fire the flare into the air.  He deactivated his optic sensors until the\n&gt; flare died out, and reactivated them.  He hoisted his plasma launcher up\n&gt; against his shoulder, and fired a blast at the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Caitiff flew backwards, slamming to the ground from all the shots.  He got\n&gt; up, chest bleeding, when one ion disk passed over his head, and the other\n&gt; slashed off his left hand.  He fell to his knees, letting out screams of\npain.\n&gt;\n&gt; ====\n&gt;\n&gt; Chordate slammed his fist against an armrest of his chair.  &quot;Slag it!\n&gt; Kluster, requesting authorization to use the missile launchers.  We need\nto\n&gt; fire them into the bulk of the Alliance to scatter them.&quot;  He watched as\nthe\n&gt; shields dropped to 74%.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
