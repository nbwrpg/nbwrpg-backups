Her suprise evedent on her face.*\n\n&quot; How&#39;d they do THAT!&quot;\n\n* She whipped her head around to Snow Tech who looks just as dunb-founded as \nshe. Snow Tech finally looks at Shadow Cat, and speaks what she was \nthinking.*\n\n&quot; Holy S&*^! That thing is HUGE!&quot;\n\n* They both whip their heads around to the sound of it&#39;s voice and the \nrummbling of its approach. They both saw the barrage of missles raining down \nat them.*\n\n&quot; SCATTER&quot;\n\n* SHadow Cat leaps to the air, using her wings and supersonic speed to dodge \nthe missles that fell down past her like large, dangerous drops of rain. \nSnow Tech was not so lucky, he could not fly yet, so had to dodge them on \nthe ground. He squeeled and ran around the large exsplosions and craters \nthat appeared arund him.*\n\n&quot;Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!&quot;\n\n* Shadow Cat flew up into the clouds, gathering energy as she went. Once in \nthe safe cover of the clouds, she extended her pent up energy into the \nclouds, calling her favorite element. Lightning. The energy of the sky came \nrumbling at her call, balling up above her up-raised hands. It gathered \nuntil it was the size of a large building. She knew that some of it wouldn&#39;t \nhit the large Predacon, but some of it had too, and hopefully it would give \nSnow Tech enough time to get away. But she was taking a risk, she didn&#39;t \nknow if it would affect the large Pred. She had never done it to one. Heck, \nshe hadn&#39;t done it to one of her own kind period! She had only used it on \nher prison guards.She arched her back, getting ready to fire. She closed her \neyes and prayed that it would work.*\n\n&quot; LIGHTNING STORM!!!!&quot;\n\nElectric energy rained down on her enemy, falling every-where, she could \nonly approximately aim this big of a bolt at something that small. If she \nwas trying to hit a mountain, she would for shure hit it. But this was \nrisky.*\n\n* Snow Tech squeeled again as a bolt of lightning struck his tail and butt. \nThe electric energy almost short surcuiting him. God! She could&#39;a warned \nhim!!!*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;From: Yanshosh@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Fuzz nut!\n&gt;Date: Wed, 20 Dec 2000 01:08:58 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;::Dark Lavatron::\n&gt;\n&gt;Astral fires two missiles as he dives under several shots, taking out\n&gt;one of the two EMPs which were still functional.

Fenox, Starlight, Griplash, and\n&gt;Recklessa all transform into various body-parts. Shots whizz past\n&gt;them as they combine, forming the giant Dark Lavatron.\n&gt;\n&gt;Dark Lavatron laughs. &quot;Feel my wrath, Maximal!&quot; He yells out in a\n&gt;deep voice, stomping toward Snow Tech and Shadow Cat and firing\n&gt;missiles down at them. A missile hits the ground, flames rushing\n&gt;across the grassland. The ground shakes as his feet make large\n&gt;imprints in it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *The little fuzz ball looked up at Iron Raptor, He understood what\n&gt;she\n&gt; &gt; said,and would do what she asked.
