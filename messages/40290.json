One \ncatch what happens there, happens to Blacknightmare... hellpeon still \nis fighting Ultimo. Now without further ado... the evil that happens \nwhen one makes the wrong choice. The right choice was Orchestra, \nsimply because it was the only choice there she had knowledge about. \nHellpeon was the wrong choice because opposing the Bamphomet is a bad \nthing... and the other guy... well thats the &quot;Bamphomet&quot; extremely \nsmall sized. He was the wrong answer because although your not \nsupposed to disobey him he doesnt want to take over the universe. \nOrchestra was the correct answer because it was the only one she knew \nand it displayed Infecticon beliefs. You destroy a race, you salvage \nwhats left of the technology that would benefit you and move on.\n\nAs Blackknightmare walked towards the Chamber, all the other \nHolograms dissapeared. A moment later the floor beneath her opened \nand she dropped into a chamber, the entrance sealing up. A  right \nlight shown all around and then suddenly she found herself standing \non what looked to be an asteroid in front of what appears to be \nHellpeon. A moment later a very and all too real blast of chaochitan \nenergy.\n\nWeird simulation type hellpeon: &quot;Predacon trash!&quot;\n\nElsewhere Blight looks to Darkfate and smirks as he steps away from \nhim and soon a barrier of chaochitan energy flys in front and to the \nsides of Darkfate.\n\nBlight: &quot;Slight change of plans... I decided not to have you killed. \nYou would be better as a prisoner. Now your troops will work for us \nor you shall die. Forget about recieving and sending coms as well. \nThe energy hear &quot;kills them off.&quot;&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; BLacknightmare::\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Orchestra???&quot;said Blacknightmare when the hologram placed a hand \nin \n&gt; her face, she walked some steps and stopped &quot;No... I can&#39;t let my \n&gt; feelings manage me now&quot; thought the femme and looked to holograms, \n&gt; she come back to her pedestal &quot;Well at whom will I choose?&quot; thought \n&gt; Blacknightmare&quot;I should think... Carefully&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Darkfate frowned and thought&quot;I should speak with her... later&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Blacknightmare started to walk and she walked towards Hellpeon&#39;s \n&gt; hologram. \n&gt; \n&gt; She stopped and waited that chamber open in order to enter. &quot;Why \n&gt; me?&quot;thought the femme&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything&quot;\n\n\n"}}
