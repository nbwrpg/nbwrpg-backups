Look at us, here on the range.  Look at what we were, in the\n&gt; heavens where we occur.  The AUtobots, the Decepticons. Now the Maximals and\n&gt; the Predacons.  What we were, now are they.  The war carried on aother way.\n&gt; In the ages to come, in the ages to pass, will someday they be the ancients\n&gt; watching as their descendents carry the ballast?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Looking up to the heavens, &quot;Is that what we are?  Always at war?  Can we\n&gt; bedevil no other fates but what shall occur?&quot;  Pausing, &quot;The roads, the\n&gt; skylanes, all to war.  In the past, in hte future.  Can we never ever find a\n&gt; way to suture?  I see what we were, I see what we are.  I see nothing but\n&gt; destruction from star to star.  It makes me sad, it makes me mope, for being\n&gt; here I see we have no hope.  For even if we do win..  We shall begin the\n&gt; cycle yet again.  Even if we protect the past, the future shall have war, it\n&gt; will always last.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from LORD ELDER, &quot;So you are becoming much like any of\nus now.&quot; He patted WHEELIE on the shoulder in a hopefully comforting\ngesture, &quot;You are growing tired of the war.&quot;\n\nHe smiled in a companiable way, &quot;That is good. There are others who\nseem to live for battle, even when they say they are looking for\npeace.&quot; A sorrowful looked passed over ELDER&#39;s face, &quot;Keep this\nfeeling, treasure it. Try to use it to keep you going, so that as you\nfight this war you do not loose focus of your goal - peace.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
