He=\r\n directs an ear over to Leo Prime and Wing Caliber with a soft sigh.\n\n&quot; The=\r\n chamber renewed my strength but was unable to repair my damages.  At the s=\r\name time, I had the dream.  I was first brought to Master Yokitron&#39;s traini=\r\nng facility, where I was mentored with Straight Shot and Nightshift.  Then =\r\nI was transported to a large cave, not far from the Ark, where I am now sen=\r\nsing Rodimus&#39;s position.  Yes, I know who resides there, and I must go ther=\r\ne.  He&#39;s expecting me.  His time grows short or else he would not have reac=\r\nhed out to me as he had.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot and Quickstride look to Tucson.\n\n&quot;=\r\n So he&#39;s not dangerous after all?&quot;\n\nAsks Straight Shot.  Tucson smiles to e=\r\nveryone.\n\n&quot; No on the contrary he&#39;s been our friend for a long time.  He ju=\r\nst happens to be very old and keeps mostly to himself.  And since you two w=\r\nere the first to encounter him, I&#39;m sure he would like to meet you and the =\r\nothers before his time expires.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot smiles.\n\n&quot; Since you put it=\r\n that way, wow, sure, now that we know he&#39;s not a threat. So howcome Saberb=\r\nack can&#39;t control him?&quot;\n\nTucson points to his chest.\n\n&quot; I think it&#39;s becaus=\r\ne my spark is somewhat connected to him.  All right, we haven&#39;t got much ti=\r\nme, he&#39;s dying and he has requested my presence.  We must go quickly.&quot;\n\nAt =\r\nthe large cave, the old dragon hears Rodimus exploring the cave and slowly =\r\nrepositions his body so he can look to him directly.  It wasn&#39;t Tucson but =\r\nhe could sense that Rodimus was a friend.  With his long tail he gestures R=\r\nodimus to enter into his sub cavern where he could get a better look at him=\r\n. With soulful eyes and gentile look upon his muzzle, he welcomes his visit=\r\nor graciously, giving him one of his shed silver scales as a remembrance of=\r\n their encounter.  Then he could sense it, the one who he truly called for.=\r\n  Just outside the cave, having moved rather quickly for a bulky Autobot, t=\r\nhe Silver warrior arrives as he had done in his dream.  He hopes the others=\r\n were not far behind.  Straight Shot had transformed into her alt mode for =\r\nthe trip but gets back into robot mode, once having arrived at the cave.\n\n&quot;=\r\n It&#39;s as my dream foretold.  We&#39;re here.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot is now met by Quic=\r\nkstride.\n\n&quot; Here we go again, this time, we know he&#39;s not having any of us =\r\nfor lunch.&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles and then leads the group to the dragon who now=\r\n has Rodimus for company.  Upon seeing Tucson, the old dragon slowly lifts =\r\nhis head to Tucson&#39;s chest.  The blue light which once beat within his spar=\r\nk chamber beats once again but with greater intensity.  Before things begin=\r\n to transpire, the old dragon looks down to Straight Shot and Quickstride, =\r\nwith a gentile air of apology.  He had never meant to frighten them.\n\n&quot; It&#39;=\r\ns okay, Tucson explained everything.  We know you were just looking for som=\r\ne company.  We shouldn&#39;t have been so hasty, assuming you were a threat. I&#39;=\r\nm glad we got the chance to actually meet you.&quot;\n\nShe gives the dragon a fri=\r\nendly rub on his snout as does Quickstride.\n\n&quot; Gee, too bad we didn&#39;t meet =\r\nya sooner big fella.&quot;\n\nAfter things were sorted out between them, the drago=\r\nn turns Back to Tucson.  It was time.  The dragon places his snout on Tucso=\r\nn&#39;s chest as the warrior places his hand on the dragon&#39;s forehead.  A blue =\r\nlaser like light is ejected from three ports on Tucson&#39;s chest as the beams=\r\n now scan over the old dragon.  A very bright pulsating light develops in T=\r\nucson&#39;s chest as it quickly envelopes himself and the dragon, turning them =\r\nboth into a silvery shimmering entity.  Soon the two begin to melt into one=\r\n.  The light dims, revealing a warrior of shimmering silver, where Tucson a=\r\nnd the dragon once stood.   The warrior opens his bright blue optics which =\r\ngives the cave light where there once was darkness.  He looks around and fo=\r\nr the first time in vorns he can see.  \n\n&quot; Rodimus, everyone, I can see all=\r\n of you.  The dream was a vision.  Better times are ahead and the dragon kn=\r\new exactly what needed to transpire.  My Autobot shell was weakening and wo=\r\nuld not have lasted much longer.  And now, I am the Silver Dragon, but plea=\r\nse, call me by my original name. &quot;\n\nHe looks outside with a strong stance i=\r\nn his new trans metal draconic form.  He transforms into his new alt form a=\r\nnd takes a strong stance at the foot of the cave.  Now a much younger and s=\r\ntronger version of the Silver Dragon, Tucson makes his voice heard, hoping =\r\nthat Saberback hears his assertive message.  A booming draconic roar is sen=\r\nt over the skies as a warning is cast to the enemy that the guardian lives =\r\nagain.\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Aug 4, 2011, at 7=\r\n:39 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; On 8/3/11, Sandy=\r\n Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot tries desperately =\r\nto communicate with Leo and Rodimus as does\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride, who&#39;s face sti=\r\nll shows shock.

Al=\r\nthough the dragon never made any motions to harm\n&gt; &gt; them, it was to them, =\r\nstill cause of alarm. The sound of Quickstride&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; hooves grabs Tucson&#39;s =\r\nattention as well, since he had already been awakened\n&gt; &gt; by his dream.

Now, what happened?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to her brother.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot; We went to survey the construction site for the wind turbine and we went\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; into the cave where the turbine is gonna be installed...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quick=\r\nstride now speaks up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; At first it looked deserted, but well..

We didn&#39;t hang\n&gt; &gt; around long enough ta find out if it w=\r\nas dangerous or not. All we knew, it\n&gt; &gt; was enormous, had the same feature=\r\ns as Hydras, but with only one head and it\n&gt; &gt; had really big teeth and cla=\r\nws.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson stumbles back in surprise.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; You - just describ=\r\ned something I saw in a dream I just woke up from.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The duo stare a=\r\nt him in shock.

I&#39;m g=\r\nlad we got the chance to actually meet you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She g=\r\nives the dragon a friendly rub on his snout as does Quickstride.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Gee, too bad we didn&#39;t meet ya sooner big fella.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After things were sorted out between them, the dragon turn=\r\ns Back to Tucson. &nbsp;It was time. &nbsp;The dragon places his snout on T=\r\nucson&#39;s chest as the warrior places his hand on the dragon&#39;s forehead. &nbs=\r\np;A blue laser like light is ejected from three ports on Tucson&#39;s chest as =\r\nthe beams now scan over the old dragon. &nbsp;A very bright pulsating light=\r\n develops in Tucson&#39;s chest as it quickly envelopes himself and the dragon,=\r\n turning them both into a silvery shimmering entity. &nbsp;Soon the two beg=\r\nin to melt into one. &nbsp;The light dims, revealing a warrior of shimmerin=\r\ng silver, where Tucson and the dragon once stood. &nbsp; The warrior opens =\r\nhis bright blue optics which gives the cave light where there once was dark=\r\nness. &nbsp;He looks around and for the first time in vorns he can see. &nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Rodimus, everyone, I can see all of you. &nb=\r\nsp;The dream was a vision. &nbsp;Better times are ahead and the dragon knew=\r\n exactly what needed to transpire. &nbsp;My Autobot shell was weakening and=\r\n would not have lasted much longer. &nbsp;And now, I am the Silver Dragon, =\r\nbut please, call me by my original name. &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He look=\r\ns outside with a strong stance in his new trans metal draconic form. &nbsp;=\r\nHe transforms into his new alt form and takes a strong stance at the foot o=\r\nf the cave. &nbsp;Now a much younger and stronger version of the Silver Dra=\r\ngon, Tucson makes his voice heard, hoping that Saberback hears his assertiv=\r\ne message. &nbsp;A booming draconic roar is sent over the skies as a warnin=\r\ng is cast to the enemy that the guardian lives again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpetu=\r\nally on the move and constantly busy.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Aug 4, 2011, a=\r\nt 7:39 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;su=\r\npercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote ty=\r\npe=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;di=\r\nv id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;On 8/3/11, Sandy Panico &lt;&lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@yahoo.=\r\ncom&quot;&gt;magicquartz@...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot tries =\r\ndesperately to communicate with Leo and Rodimus as does&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrid=\r\ne, who&#39;s face still shows shock.

Although the dragon never made any motions to ha=\r\nrm&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; them, it was to them, still cause of alarm.  The sound of Quick=\r\nstride&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hooves grabs Tucson&#39;s attention as well, since he had alr=\r\neady been awakened&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; by his dream.

We didn&#39;t hang&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; around long enough ta find out =\r\nif it was dangerous or not.
