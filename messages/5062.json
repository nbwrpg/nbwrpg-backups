He could feel the pain\nbeside him. He was dying. It was almost time. Mechfluid was spilling\nout of him. But than a voice, one of great mystique, spoke to him.\n\n&quot;It is all right. You will be fine.&quot;\n\nVulois blacked out, and that is when he magically dissapeared from\nPast Earth.\n\nVulois awkoke in a strange place. He could not understand where he\nwas. Than he looked ahead. It was the voice who brought him here. The\none who sent him to Earth in the first place: The Matrix! But that\nmust mean......He&#39;s back on Cybertron! He could feel the Matrix\ncalling him. He went up to it, and stepped inside.\n\nIn moments he was wisked away inside it. It spoke to him.\n\n&quot;You are now interfacing with the Oracle, the computer where the\nsparks of all who lived, or are going to live meet. Welcome Vulois&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t understand. Why am I here?&quot;\n\n&quot;Let The Oracle explain. What you saw before, in your last moments of\nRanbis the Decepticon was fraud. You were not sent to Past Earth as\nPunishment, but for a reason. We want you to be our abassador. We\nwant all of Cybertron to be Organic, and we want all the factions to\nunite and bring the organics to Cybertron and make new peace. We\nneeded to send you before so you could be disgusted by the Predacon\nway. How they treated you. We want that to end. We want one faction,\nliving Organically. You and three others are too start our peace\ngroup. You must build an embassy on neutral ground, and hold meetings\nto return to Cybertron under one organic faction that all\nCybertronians will become. The three that you should work with are\nSoundwave, Battera and Cybershark. They might not say yes, but you\nmust try to recruit them.&quot;\n\n&quot;What about Terminess? Was she killed?&quot;\n\n&quot;She has served her purpose. We made sure she would go to Past Earth.\nMany of the things you did you could not have done without her. We\nhave erased her memory and sent her back to her group.&quot;\n\n&quot;Than I will do it. Send me back to Past Earth!&quot;\n\nVulois felt like he was going faster and faster, until bright light\nsone on him and he was gone.\n\nWhen he regained sight, he was on Past Earth, on a huge X.\n\n&quot;This must be where I will build the embassy. By the Matrix, I will\nsucceed!&quot;\n\n(All right, that ties up loose ends for my chars. Now I won&#39;t have to\nread a thousand messages when I come back from vacation. Please don&#39;t\nsay you found my char or anything while I&#39;m gone. I want to be there\nto re-act. I have grad tomorrow and vacation friday, so wish me luck!\nGoodbye everyone!)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
