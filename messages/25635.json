She speeds up, firing two more\nmissiles at Prebon.\n\nPrebon lets the missles hit him forcing him into the water below.\n\nFenox speeds up, above the ocean and heading for the Iron Fist. She\nknew they wouldn&#39;t lower the shields untill Prebon was taken care of,\nbut the missile launchers and laser turrets would take care of that\nnicely.\n\nMissles and lasers flaired around him like sparks from a campfire. he\nswerved and dodged avoiding the higher power blasts. he waited till a missle\nwas close and blasted it causing an explosion close enough to him to disrupt\nany sensors until the smoke cleared. he swam after Fenox hoping the alliance\nwould mistake the missle debris for his remains but his sensors were messed\nup too so he couldn&#39;t tell.\n\nStarlight continues after Prebon, firing four more charges at him.\n\nCharges exploded around him, he couldn&#39;t know if they were fired before the\nexplosion or after. Until his scanner was back up he couldn&#39;t know.\n\nPrebon kept working his way under the water following Fenox&#39;s wake. he knew\nit would be difficult to avoid sensors for very long but for now he had\nenough disturbance from the bot above him to be safe for the moment. He\nstayed alert for activity, he knew that moments can change at a moments\nnotice.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, January 14, 2001 9:55 AM\nSubject: Iron Fist and Alliance Base Security\n\n\n&gt; Jaws:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The great white shark took out his rifle shaped like a few foot long\nshark,\n&gt; walking towards where Prebon was, but could only see him on sensors, he\n&gt; wasn&#39;t even half way there yet.
