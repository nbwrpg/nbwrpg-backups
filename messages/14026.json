I \nwill have him stop by the bridge for a security check, if that&#39;s \nalright with everyone.&quot; She curtsied and walked out.  She went down \nthe hall and went to the entrance.  She opened the hatch and looked \nout.  There was CyberShark, standing there.  She smiled, &quot;Hello \nthere.&quot; She chuckled, &quot;Long time no see.&quot;  She had a sweet smile and \nloving look in her eyes. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFeline:\n\nShe got that parts ready in the CR room.  She had spare boards and \nwires ready.  She had arms and legs, chest and other body parts and \nplating.  Joints and sauldering supplies out and ready.  She had it \nall set out on the counter tops and in containers.  Tools were set \nout and put out, ready for use.  The place looked like a surgery room \nwith everything ready for a procedure, except a patient.  Dinobot and \nTravatron had not yet been rescued yet.  She smiled at her work.\n\n&quot;Oh, fixing them up will be no problem at all, no matter what the \ndamage.&quot;  She smiled gleefully at her handy work and walked out of \nthe CR room.  She headed for the mess hall, humming and whistling.\nShe swayed her hips and twitched her tail as she walked.  She kept \nher eyes straight, incase she passed any other bots. \n\n\n"}}
