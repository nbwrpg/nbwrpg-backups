Lino was on for about 20 minutes a few\n&gt; days\n&gt; ago. He is coming back when he has the time. He read about 100 mails\n&gt; in 20 minutes. So Code shut up about Iron Raptor should be in\n&gt; command.\n&gt; She is in command right now. What ever she says goes and She doesn&#39;t\n&gt; need to wait for Lino because He can&#39;t get on right now and havent\n&gt; been on for days. So She can do what ever she want so Code shut up.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Find long lost high school friends:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4056/10/_/_/_/960154906/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
