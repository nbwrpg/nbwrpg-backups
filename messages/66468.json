No intellige=\r\nnt life was \n&gt; &gt; within\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fifty miles which obviously meant one t=\r\nhing to the occupant \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; longer occupied the ship. H=\r\ne was all alone on this world!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He started to panic =\r\nwhile he looked around. What could he \n&gt; do?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he=\r\n could get back in the stasis pod and blast out of here \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; se=\r\narch\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a new planet? No that wouldn&#39;t work; the stasis pod \n&gt;=\r\n didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough energy to get out of the atmosphe=\r\nre.

Obviously he couldn&#39;t \n&gt; call\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; far\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough =\r\nfor help. He finally realized that his only hope was \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surv=\r\nive. The first thing you need to survive is shelter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; The bot looked around and noticed some hills off in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; distance.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there were some hills, maybe there would be some c=\r\naves or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; caverns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that he could sur=\r\nvive in. So it was decided he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He would walk =\r\nto the hills and hope to find shelter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He grabbed t=\r\nhe side of his stasis pod and started to drag \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; along\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; with him. It was heavy, but inside there was short range \n&gt; &gt; &gt; scanners\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and even a few weeks worth of food. The journey to the \n&gt; hills=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be long, but at least it was a way for him to sur=\r\nvive.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nb=\r\nwrpg@yahoogroups.com &lt;nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;hugar_twriker&quot; =\r\n&lt;hugar_twriker@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In space, s=\r\nound can not be heard, but if it could a \n&gt; &gt; bystander\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear the loud crack hiss of an asteroid slamming into the \n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nold\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; white metallic shell of a nearby stasis pod=\r\n.
