I mean Rattrap&#39;s\nfather who stands about 30&#39; tall and looks exactly how\nhe did when he was alive before and in the same area\nas Nightlight, yet you totally had him ignore\nShadowcaster. The same applies to your other BW\ncharacters who fought alongside Shadowcaster and\nshould clearly remember him dying valiantly while\ndisabling the Nemesis. I&#39;d advise you to check out the\nPosts &#39;Shadowcaster&#39; and &#39;A Hero reborn&#39;.\n\nhttp://greetings.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo! Greetings\nSend your love online with Yahoo!
