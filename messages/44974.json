There is no Q in my name.\n&gt;   &gt;   2. The fact that vehicons are mostly the\n&gt; original bot has nothing \n&gt;   to \n&gt;   &gt;   do with that Megatron being an attemt to purge\n&gt; himself of organic \n&gt;   &gt;   life.\n&gt;   &gt;   3. Then why is there a Jetstorm in this\n&gt; storyline.\n&gt;   &gt;   4. I am not going to let it go.\n&gt;   &gt;   5.

You basically just said that NBW never\n&gt; happened in Optimus \n&gt;   Fury&#39;s \n&gt;   &gt;   timeline then how does he know to go south to\n&gt; find the alliance \n&gt;   base?\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a...\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Vehicons arent Vehicons. like 98 percent of\n&gt; all the original \n&gt;   &gt;   transformers \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; transformed into some type of machine.\n&gt; Deqwboy, BM did not hapen \n&gt;   in \n&gt;   &gt;   the RPGs \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; original story line.
