The council is trying to\ndecide a character limit, because inthe past, people have constantly\nbrought in new characters, carrying tomany, and then forgetting about\nthe older ones. We want to know what inyour opinion would be a good\nnumber limit.\n\nSomebody suggested 15, and no limit to the number in a faction. What\nisyour thought?\n\nWe also think that to be a faction, someone needs to have a least three\ndifferent people in the group. What do you think about this?\n\nAlso, I hope to see you run for council. :)\n\n"}}
