Then, they recieved a message from Zardus.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Astral turned to Starscream.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;Hey, nice meeting you, but we must leave, the path of \ndestruction is ours to create!!!&quot; Astral laughed demonically, firing \na missile from his dark flame rocket launcher, which hit the ground \nin front of Starscream, and made a ring of dark fire around him, but \nnot to hurt him. \n&gt; \n&gt;         They all said goodbye quickly and in an instant got up and \nsped off towards the battle.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; ::Skulletron::\n&gt; \n&gt;           Skulletron continues limping down a corridor, holding his \nbleeding side.  Two autoguns popped up and started blasting holes in \nhis upper body, up to the chest.  He kept going back, mech fluid was \nspurting everywhere with each blast.  Soon, he was bound to be found \nout.  He took out his raygun and just as h was going to press the \ntrigger, he put it back, rolling to dodge shots.  He didn&#39;t need his \nweaponfire to be detected.  Suddenly, he felt something in him, a big \nboost of energy.  Unintentionally, his body sprang into action.  \nSkulletron did a somersault forward, in between the two autoguns, and \nlanded behind them.  He grabbed them, and used force to turn them to \nface each other, then let go quickly.  The two autoguns blasted \neachother.  Skulletron gave a thumbs up to himself, and then fell \ndown on the ground.  Mech fluid poured and poured.  Skulletron knew \nit, he was going to die.  But, he wouldn&#39;t let himself go that \neasily.  He fought death.  But, he didn&#39;t know how long he could \nfight it.\n&gt; \n&gt;        He opened his comlink to all Alliance members.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;This is.....This is.....&quot; He spat out some mech \nfluid, &quot;This is Skulletron........Ughh..........&quot; He yelled in pain \nas a spasm of pain hit him, &quot;Rescue me......Release me from \nthese.....These.......&quot; Skulletron coughed up more mech fluid, &quot;Send \nsomebody to get me.........Get \nme...........I&#39;m...I...I....I&#39;m.....I&#39;m......I&#39;m \ndieing.........Slowly dieing..........Need.....Help......&quot; \nSkulletron&#39;s optics closed, and he was still alive, but in really bad \nshape.  His body just lay there in a massive pool of mechfluid, \ngrowing.\n\n\n"}}
