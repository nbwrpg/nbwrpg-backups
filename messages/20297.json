A \nproptform with no spark.\nBut with spark or not, they had to get moving, mainly to find Iris and ask \nabout what in the pit was going on herr with this wierd beast mode.\n\nShe keeps her snout on the back of Prowls shoulder, knowing that this wasn&#39;t \ntoo good of a time for him. Wounded and now facing a sparkless form. But \nwhat pain she caused him by the nudge she didn&#39;t mean to, only wanting to \ntell him that she knew how he felt and that it was time to get going.\nThe sun was already setting and it was dangerouse to travel at night, \nespecially with the enemy planning to attack as she was sure thery were.\nHer eyes look up into his as he looks at her, seeing that there was love \nthere which had replaced the blank look he seemed to have only moments \nbefore.\n\nShe could understand why he still loved her, because he loved her for her \nand not her appearence, because he knew that the spark of a bot still beat \ninside her exo-structured chest.\nAnd that was part of the reason she loved him in the first place.\nBut still, this situation not only effected her but Prowl as well. If she \nhadn&#39;t been in pain she could have killed him, and almost did.\nAnd that was why she was going to Iris now, to find out just why and how \nthis happened so that she could find out a way to stop it from happening \nnext time.\n\nIron Raptor simply stood still as Prowl nodded to her and walked over to her \nside, still a bit concerned about the stump which was the only thing left of \nhalf of his wing.\nShe felt him climb on and settle himself down, moving her back and shoulder \nmuscles a bit to settle herself more comfortably to moving with a passenger \nagain.\nFeeling him lean down she caught the feeling of the kiss and then simply \nlistened to what words he whispered into her ear.\nThey were comforting to a point but only so far, knowing that perhaps he was \nthe only one who loved her no matter what shape she took...for if anyone \nknew how she felt she was rather frightened of this beast mode, not being \nable to trust it.\nShe didn&#39;t like its instincts or actions, or how it liked mutilation more \nthen anything.\nIt was horrable!\n\nIron Raptor sighed as she began to move off towards the setting sun once \nagain , continuing on her way towards the Ark.*\n\n&quot; That&#39;s one of us which thinks that then...&quot;\n\n* And with that she picked up her speed and soon began to run, heading \nstraight for the Ark.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
