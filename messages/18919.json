Every \nMafia member seemed to be being slaughtered or attacked by one or another of \nthe Alliance members. He sees Zardus fire at Deemos, smiling internaly.\n\n&quot;WarMachines,&quot; he says as he dives at Deemos, his siren screaching as he \ndrops a few bombs at the bot, &quot;We combine in one cycle. Get ready.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRepressor recieves Havoc&#39;s orders, flying past a few autogun shots, one \ndigging into his side.\n\nSeeing the Mafia base&#39;s shields go back online, he fires two missiles, them \nalong with several dozen rapid fire shots streaming at the shields.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike and Reptilica jump to the side, dozens of shots and a few \nmissiles passing by them through the hole through which they were entering \nthe Mafia base.\n\n&quot;Take out the rest of the autoguns, then we can go back for a CR.&quot; \nBloodystrike says, aiming at one of the two remaining autoguns and firing, \nfrom almost point-blank range. Reptilica does the same witht he other one.\n\n"}}
