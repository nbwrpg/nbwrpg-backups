Neither side\n&gt; =\r\ntrusted each other, and the tesnsion in the air could be cut with a\n&gt; micro=\r\nserated blade.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the moment the communication lines were still open, =\r\nincluding the\n&gt; one between BLACK ARACHNIA and TARANTULUS, but very soon, a=\r\ns they\n&gt; would venture further towards the forest, that too would cease to\n=\r\n&gt; exist. They would all be cut off from outside help, and they would\n&gt; have=\r\n to rely on their own skills and instincts, and even each other.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I ex=\r\npect a full report when you get back.&quot; TARANTULUS transmitted\n&gt; through his=\r\n link with BLACK ARACHNIA, &quot;But for the moment I will have\n&gt; time to keep a=\r\nn optic on Hydras&#39; base while he is gone.&quot; There was a\n&gt; soft chuckle from =\r\nTARANTULUS as if he were already contemplating some\n&gt; sort of mayhem.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;=\r\nNEW&gt;\n\nThere was a sniff of annoyance from BLACKARACHNIA.  Just like TARANTA=\r\nLUS to go off and hide when something needed doing and giggle over it.  But=\r\n, in the time she was in the brush her link wold be cut off to him, and the=\r\n She-Spider would have time for the runningo f her own schemes.  Which she =\r\nwould enjoy..  Her own webs, plots, and spinnerettes.\n\nThe time for schemin=\r\ng would be her own, and she would enjoy it greatly.\n\nFor the moment, VICE G=\r\nRIP watched in the leafy underbrush as the Maximal reserves came up, and a =\r\nsecond group approached.  No, definitely too many Maximals to attempt to at=\r\ntack, adn too many of them had high mobility to try and otherwise cut off a=\r\nnd ambush if the groups got separated.\n\n\n\n"}}
