His chamber opened again and he stepped out. \nVeratis greeted him with a look of relief. The monitor showed the owl \nDNA merging with the polar bear DNA. \n\n&quot;What will become of her?&quot; Lunarpine asked, his concern shined \nthrough his beedy eyes. &quot;Will she be alright?&quot; he stepped closer to \nthe scientist for a better view.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m hoping that the owl DNA would turn her back into her fusor form. \nUnfortunately it seems to have the reverse effect. Instead ofmerging \nthe two DNA strands are some how intertwining with each other.&quot; The \nscientist in him was fascinated by the prospect. The creator in him \nbegan to worry. &quot;The virus has stopped growing. All I can suggest is \nwe watch her closely and hope her new form can fight it off.&quot;\n\n that--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She was roared again in the chamber just as the seditive was taking \n&gt; effect. She fell into a deep sleep. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her mind stilll focused on the cage. She had always been free. Free \n&gt; to move where the wind took her. Now with her new body, she could \n&gt; have been free to roam the iced lands and wander where the land \ntook \n&gt; her. But instead, this virus trapped her. She was a threat to \nherself \n&gt; and all those around her. She could see the cage of metal bars \n&gt; surounding her and keeping her shut in.  She was no longer free, \nbut \n&gt; a prisoner. And one the might have to be destroyed. She roared out \nin \n&gt; her sleep as the thought of them having to kill her ran through her \n&gt; thoughts. Despite the seditive, she was in a fitful sleep. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOPS, tried to reply yesterday, guess it didn&#39;t go through.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine sensed fear from Ice, she was becomeing more terrified \nat \n&gt; every\n&gt; &gt; moment. He set her inside the transport pod and set the \ncoordinates \n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; Veratis&#39; base. The pod quickly sped back to the base in time to \n&gt; save Ice.\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine tried to make sense of her thoughts, they seemed mixxed \n&gt; up beyond\n&gt; &gt; comprehension. She wasn&#39;t afraid of the virus, she was more \nafraid \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; something else. he tried to focus, the visions made little sense \nto \n&gt; him. Why\n&gt; &gt; would she be thinking about a cage at a time like this. Her roar \n&gt; echoed\n&gt; &gt; deafeningly in his head. &quot;Calm down.&quot; He shouted to her hopeing \nshe \n&gt; had at\n&gt; &gt; least a little comprehension. The cleaning drones helped the \n&gt; struggling bot\n&gt; &gt; carry Ice back inside and into the lab. He forced himself to \nresist \n&gt; the urge\n&gt; &gt; to scream as he placed her into her CR chamber. He hoped that \nthis \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; settle her. Almost immediately a sedative flooded the tank \nintended \n&gt; to calm\n&gt; &gt; her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Veratis raced into the lab and activated the DNA sequencers. He \n&gt; hoped that\n&gt; &gt; the intervention of her origional DNA would counteract the virus. \n&gt; He held\n&gt; &gt; his head as if it would explode if he let go. &quot;What happened out \n&gt; there?&quot; the\n&gt; &gt; old science bot asked when the sedative took effect on Ice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;She paniced I think.&quot; Lunarpine answered looking on at her new \n&gt; form inside\n&gt; &gt; the chamber.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Now it&#39;s your turn.&quot; Veratis stated in an almost demanding \nmanner \n&gt; as he\n&gt; &gt; pointed Lunarpine into the other chamber. &quot;We can&#39;t take the \nchance \n&gt; that the\n&gt; &gt; virus may have mutated.&quot; Veratis watched the scanners as \nLunarpine \n&gt; stepped\n&gt; &gt; inside.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers locked himself in his room while he waited for the \nviral\n&gt; &gt; emergency to calm down. He suddenly came to a paniced \nrealization. \n&gt; His\n&gt; &gt; samples were in the lab with the infected bots. If they were \n&gt; contaminated\n&gt; &gt; thered be hell to pay.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
