I know that rAuq and Yan\nare temporarily away, that Megan has quit (sigh) and that people never\nseem to reply  anymore. Another problem is we have a new council dropped\non it&#39;s head (okay not really a council, ME for christ sakes, Hedge\nwhere are you?) and I never was told what to do.\n\nFirst of all, no one replied to my last rant, I repeat, everyone must at\nleast skim every message to make sure it does not apply to them, and if\nit does, reply. No one said anything about me playing out rAuq&#39;s\ncharacters, and Lurker, Airly, you guys never replied to my ask for\nsuggestions on how to be a better leader, making it so I am not even\nsure if you guys read it. Kslawdogg, if you could get this IGL going\nplease, so we can speed up the RPG, also, WHat happened to Grimlock, did\nyou post about it? What about Jagged and Nightmare. Without further Apu,\nand since no one argued, here is a super long post.\n\nPacifix/Technobots/Menasor/Abominus/Astrotrain/Swoop/Grimlock/Jagged/Nightmare/Megatron/Hook/Bonecrusher/Soundwave/Frenzy/Rumble/Spinister/\nCrossroads/Firedrill/Cliffjumper/Beachcomber/Hoist.\n\nAutobots\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nBeachcomber looked on in awe, as the ship disapeared with his friends.\nHe ran up to RedHot, &quot;They, they got away.&quot; he mummured.\n\nScattershot looked oh, &quot;Oh no they won&#39;t, not with a Technobot.&quot; he then\nturned to them. &quot;Transform, and roll out.&quot; he shouted, as he leapt into\nthe air, and transformed into his Jet mode, speeding away towards the\nArena like ship, the other Technobots followed.\n\nPacifix looked on as his troops were scattering. &quot;No, not now, not\nwithout a plan.&quot; he said in disbelief, as the ships doors folded open,\nHoist trudging out. \n\n&quot;The computer is back online sir.&quot; Hoist said in ignorance to what was\nhappening.\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nDecepticons\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nDominjoe landed near the Constructicons and Soundwave, as they all\nlooked around. The cockpit opened, and Megatron flew out of it,\ntransforming into his large robot mode. He looked to his old troops, and\nbegan to speak informally.\n\n&quot;Greetings Decepticons, It is time to rejoin the cause you gave your\nlife to Millions of years ago, that, or be oblitorated.&quot; he said, firing\nhis fusion cannon into the air to add an exclamation point to his\nphrase.\n\nBonecrusher looked in awe. &quot;It can&#39;t be, Megatron.&quot;\n\nRumble and Frenzy walked forward away from Proto 1000. &quot;Yeah, we saw you\ndie.&quot; They said in unison.\n\nSoundwave looked at both of them, no emotion showing on his face. \n\n&quot;Megatron obviously exists.&quot;\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nDecepticon Ship\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n&quot;Come on, hurry up Abominus.&quot; Astrotrains voice complained, showing the\nweariness in him. Then out of nowhere the island began to shake.\n\nMeanwhile deep under the water, Abominus plunged his second hand deep\nwithin the core of the Islands anchor to the earth, as he placed his big\nhands around the ship, then he began to pull, his eyes showing no sign\nof intelligence, as he placed his foot on the island core for leverage.\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nGrimlock&#39;s rescue attempt\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nGrimlock arced towards the giant threatening robot. &quot;Wrong, you release\nAutobots, and Grimlock not smash you.&quot; he yelled.\n\nBehind the ship, Firedrill finally arrived, and transformed, and began\nbanging his fists agains it&#39;s armored sides. &quot;Let Cliffjumper gooooooo.&quot;\nHe screamed with rage.\n\n"}}
