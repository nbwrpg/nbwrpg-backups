His \nscanners had confirmed that both were Maximals, but he had tried to \nget them to stop fighting.\n\n&quot;I apologize,&quot; he says to Iron Raptor, dropping her back to the \nground, &quot;Did this bot attack you?&quot;\n\nA second after he asked his question, Element felt claws digging into \nhis arm. Prowl had manage to turn himself around in the gestalt&#39;s \ngrasp and scratch at Element&#39;s armor. Element growls, bringing his \nother hand back and slamming the back of his fist into Prowl&#39;s head. \nWith a sickening, loud crunch originating from Prowl&#39;s head, his body \ngoes limp, simply remaining still in Element&#39;s grasp.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * She&#39;d broken his wing, the roar coming from him was a good sign.\n&gt; His mind was a cloud of rage and pain, but the man she knew was \nsomewhere in \n&gt; that mix of it all, she just had to try and find him.\n&gt; &lt; Prowl, where are you?&gt; she thought to herself before her mind \nwent blank \n&gt; in shok while she saw him lung at her from the corner of her eye.\n&gt; She was even more surprised, though, when a huge hand suddenly came \ninto the \n&gt; picture and lifted him away from her, possibly saving her from the \nresult of \n&gt; a broken neck.\n&gt; For some stupid reason she just stood there and watched as a giant \nbot \n&gt; picked Prowl from her, him struggling in the things grasp.\n&gt; Where did this come from? It totally snuck up on her, even though \nshe had to \n&gt; admit that it was pretty easy since she was dwelling on the fight \nand not \n&gt; too much on things going on around her.  By now the big bot had \nlifted Prowl \n&gt; high in the air and Iron Raptor suddenly realized that if it let go \nof him \n&gt; now and with his broken wing, Prowl would fall to earth and would \nprobably \n&gt; make a sickening sound when he landed. She made a sick face at the \nthought.\n&gt; &lt; Great job, dumb ass.&gt; her mind teased.\n&gt; But she suddenly hissed through her teeth when she saw the other \nhand whoosh \n&gt; down towards her now, scrambling to try and get out of the way on \nall fours. \n&gt; But she made a slight gaging sound when the hand caught her tail \ninstead and \n&gt; she was suddenly hauled up through the air up-side down!*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hay!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * This was un-needed! And what did this bot think it was doing \nanyway?*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Put me down!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She was rightfully pissed off now!*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
