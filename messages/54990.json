I killed you as just Galvatron once, now im much more.&quot; Still unknowing \nof the tracer when it was placed on him it simply melted...the gift of being \nmade of basicly hot rock and fire. He stared as they both went off. &quot;Ill be \nthe last one standing.&quot; He blasted off towards the base. he opened his comm to \nTyrael. &quot;Meet me at my base, we must talk now!&quot; he then sent a comm to his \nbase. &quot;All predacons meet on the bridge.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; Rodimus listened to Optimus. He was out of the times.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: It&#39;s a different era Optimus. Maximals, Predacons, and the \n&gt; Tripredacus are the main factions. Autobots and Decepticons, such as the three \n&gt; of us, are ancient.\n&gt; When optimus talked of crushing enemies, Rodimus knew something was wrong.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Listen to yourself, Optimus. You never taught me to &quot;crush&quot; \n&gt; enemies. You taught me to do what was right.\n&gt; When Optimus mentioned Magnus, Rodimus became angered. He knew it was a lie. \n&gt; Magnus had been killed by him.\n&gt; Rodimus watched as Optimus flew off.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: I guess thats it. When the three of us meet next, you know it&#39;ll \n&gt; be war.\n&gt; Rodimus transformes to car mode and heads back for the base.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime(via comm): Yggdrasil, I&#39;m done with Optimus. What&#39;s going on at \n&gt; the base?\n&gt;  thedachande1985 &lt;thedachande1985@...&gt; wrote:::Optimus Prime:\n&gt; \n&gt;      He stood up, ready to see his old &quot;friends&quot;.\n&gt;      &quot;Welcome, Rodimus,&quot; He said, &quot;Welcome..Hydra. I see that things \n&gt; have changed in my absence. But, no more worries, things will be put \n&gt; to rights.\n&gt;      &quot;Which is what I have come here to discuss, All these pathetic, \n&gt; weak factions. Where are the Autobots and Decepticons of old? From \n&gt; what I have learned in the data disks, that I stole, there are many \n&gt; smaller factions here. The NWO? The Tripreds, even the Maximals and \n&gt; Predacons; what are all these things?\n&gt;      &quot;You two are the leaders of some prominent groups, Rodimus, you \n&gt; act as though I taught you nothing,&quot; He walked over to him, and \n&gt; placed his hand on his shoulder, as he had left his gun on a ripped \n&gt; apart stump. Secretly he had placed a bug on his shoulder, very tiny, \n&gt; about the size of a freckle. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you crushed those that seek \n&gt; to rip your faction apart?&quot;\n&gt;      He let go and walked to Hydra, &quot;And you, although part of you \n&gt; may have killed me long ago, you have fallen from your vaunted seat. \n&gt; You have had to merge with the new Megatron. Galvatron not enough for \n&gt; you?&quot;\n&gt;      Prime held Hydra&#39;s upper arm, and placed a bug on it.\n&gt;      Then he turned and walked away, back to where he had begun. &quot;I \n&gt; have crossed galaxies to put things to right here,&quot; He bent down to \n&gt; grab his gun, which he promptly attached to his leg.\n&gt;      &quot;You are both free to go,&quot; He said, then smiled at Rodimus, &quot;Oh \n&gt; yes, one last thing...You both remember Magnus, right? Well, he gave \n&gt; his life to bring me back, and look at how well his wish was granted!&quot;\n&gt;      He transformed into his truck mode and lifted off, flying right \n&gt; over Rodimus&#39;s and Hydra&#39;s head.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: The bugs are simple tracers, they won&#39;t do much more than \n&gt; say &quot;Hey! Rodimus/Hydra is here!&quot; Detected easily enough, with the \n&gt; right equipment, which most bases would have. Removal is easy too.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
