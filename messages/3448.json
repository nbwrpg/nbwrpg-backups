She looked around the \nroom.  She saw the consoles and holo-imageprojectors.  She saw the image of \nthe battle at the Predacon base.  Her spark fell to her knees.  She wanted \nto help.  But she wan&#39;t sure what would be the best way to help.  She walked \nover to the projector and turned on the sound to hear what was happening.  \nShe heard the shots and thumping of metal on metal. She heard the crashing \nof swords and firing of weapons.  She wanted to help.  She couldn&#39;t just sit \nthere and watch as her new friends died and she not do anything to help.  \nShe ran off the bridge and to an entrance way.  She ran out and ran through \nthe forest.*\n\n&quot;I hope I make it in time.&quot;\n\n*She changed into beast mode and continued to run to the Predacon base.*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
