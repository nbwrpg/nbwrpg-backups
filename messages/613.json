She fired at one of the top auto-guns and smiled as it exploded, she \nHAD done a good job rewiring this weapon!\nBrightBlade looked over at the others as they continued to attack the Ark, \nwere they having as much fun as she was?\nShe sighed, when were the Maximals going to come out and play? She&#39;d love to \nhave a chance to shoot at one of them rather then an auto-gun, or maybe even \nhave a chance to sneak inside and get the drop on a few.\nBrightBlade snickered, she was going to enjoy this! :)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
