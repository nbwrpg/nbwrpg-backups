We need to set up a so=\r\nnar grid that will be strong enough to transmit over an extended range of d=\r\nistance both land and skyward.  Since Saberback uses harmonic technology, w=\r\ne too, will deploy similar tactics.  Only this time, we will transmit at a =\r\nreverse polarity.  It&#39;s how I managed to ward off stealth warriors in the p=\r\nast.  First, if any of you have any intel as far as the frequency of his ha=\r\nrmonic wavelength is concerned, that will prove most useful.  The more I kn=\r\now, the better prepared we can all be.&quot;\n\nHe looks to Cyclonus with a seriou=\r\ns gaze.\n\n&quot; I realize that neither of you wish for such collaboration.
