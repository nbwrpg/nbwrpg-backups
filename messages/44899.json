I made BM out to be basically a state secret everyone knows about, \nbut makes a point of not mentioning (or rather it&#39;s considered a \nhistorical side note). And that would basically be writting a book \nwhich would be fine except I&#39;m already writting a 3 part series (if I \ncan get it published) I call &quot;Gundam Omega&quot;. It takes place in the \nyear Martian Century 80. It involves the war between the Martian group \n&quot;Red Sphere&quot; and the now militaristic &quot;Earth Sphere United Nations&quot;.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Dewboy you cant post for the RPGs cybertron. YOu can post for your \nalternate \n&gt; dimension one. You want to make a cybertron based off BM? Go \nsomewhere else \n&gt; and do it, then you&#39;ll be in charge. Just because you want your way \ndoesnt \n&gt; mean your going to get it, so long as people oppose the idea of the \ntechno \n&gt; organic cybertron it will ntoi work. And notte Dewboy, you arent the \nonly one \n&gt; ot have posed from Cybertron others ahvbe. KSL has, I have, Hugar \nhas. yan \n&gt; has. And none of those were trechnoorganic. so Dewboy TOUGH!\n\n\n"}}
