He \nrealized, he was in the CR chamber. It all came back to him why he was in \nhere; the auto-guns commanded from Transulas put him into stasis lock, \nturning him into a mess of a bot.\n\nThe mouse! He thought of her, him trying to find out who she was. He jolted \nhimself into full alert. She could be dead by now, but he had to find out. \nFighting if he had to.\n\nThe door of the chamber lifted, and in an instant, he leaped out and looked \naround. There were some bots by the door. He charged past them, shouldering \ninto one, not really taking the care to look who it was.\n\nThe ran into the hallway as fast as his short legs could carry him. He came \nacross the room where he was shot. He looked in, preparing to see the dead \nmouse, Transulas still in there--but instead it was empty.\n\nHe ran back to the crowd, calling, &quot;Where&#39;s that mouse-bot? Transulas had \nher!&quot; His curiosity wouldn&#39;t back down.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
