Something&#39;s happened with Yahoo and the reply to Yanshosh&#39;s reply to \nDesmonus hasn&#39;t gotten through, so here it is again.\nAnd please don&#39;t mind spelling mistakes, I have to type quickly.\n\n* Desmonus simply ignored the fact that both of the males on either side of \nher glared at each other as she took hold of their hands.\nFinding herself a bit annoyed at it.\nGreedy, was her thoughts. Most likely trying to make sure that they had her \nto themselves instead of simply getting along for the moment.\nBut their greed she could use more then anybot could think, and she was \nindeed going to use it.\n\nShe looked towards Bloodystrike as he began to jabber on about his quarters, \ncatching on right awat at just why his room was the first place he wanted \nfor her to check out.\nHe was fairly blunt...without getting right to the point right away.\nBut she followed him anyway, simply thinking how these bots could be pleased \nso easily with such simple pleasures where all she was after was a meal.\nAnd there was one on each side of her. Dinner and Desert...\nBut she would do what she had to to feed, as long as she could survive and \nlive she cared little for what pleasures they asked of her, something so \ntrivial that it didn&#39;t even concern her.\n\nDesmonus then found herself being pulled in another direction by Reptilica, \nbut both simply in the same line of direction....\nSo, he wanted her to see his quarters as well?\nShe sighed, such simple things for such simple minds.\nBut then they were at it again, arguing with each other over who&#39;s quarters \nwere better.\nMen!\nDesmonus simply took hold of their hands more firmly and cleared her \nthroat.*\n\n&quot; Hmm...perhaps it is not wise to tour on such empty stomachs, perhaps a \nsmall meal is in order before we continue towards the more formal subjects. \nBesides, I wouldn&#39;t minding getting to know you two a little better.\nIf one does not know thri team mates then one does not know themselves.\nOh! And I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Desmonus...&quot;\n\n* She simply spoke, giving their hands a little extra squeeze.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
