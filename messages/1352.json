Her eyes were used to the dark more than the light, from being in that Chamber.\n\nShe sighs as she steps out, and reverts to beast mode. Teltoli folds her wings neatly across her back and yawns in a pantherish way. It had certainly been a big day.. of battle. Something she wasn&#39;t used to. Teltoli knew she was going to have sore muscles for a while!\n\nHumming an odd tune from one of her favourite bands back at home, she makes her way along the corridor, taking every chance to peek in rooms and see what was going on. Her panther paws made no sound as she walked, much to her liking. She had hated the big clumpy sound her robot form had made.. it gave one away.\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
