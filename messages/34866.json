I&#39;m only going to go because if not well.....i don&#39;t know y\ni am going...&#39; he said again looking to the bit of oil on the floor by\nPacifix.  He opened his mouth and a small blast of flame erupted from\nit igniting  the oil.\n&quot;Bah&quot; he said to PAcifix then leaving out the same hole he cmae through.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;If others nervous it cause they weak&quot; Grimlock said with contempt, not\n&gt; at Swoop, but aimed at all the peace loving Autobots. He looked at\n&gt; Pacifix, and pointed his sword, &quot;DAMN STRAIGHT YOU HAPPY WE COME WITH\n&gt; YOU. YOU NOT SURVIVE OTHERWISE. ONLY ONE WAY TO WIN FIGHT, AND IT NOT\n&gt; INVOLVE AUDIO MODUEL&quot;. Ironhide frowned. It was really a pathetic\n&gt; counter to Pacifix. He was suprised with Pacifix&#39;s maturity, it normally\n&gt; took Autobots eons to grow up, at least, it did for him. &quot;Is anyone\n&gt; opposed to the Dinobots going along?&quot; He asked. The room was silent, you\n&gt; could have heard a nebulan clip his tone nails. He had expected more\n&gt; against it, then realized that Grimlock still held his sword. He didnt\n&gt; blame anyone for not objecting. &quot;Fine then Grimlock, you will go too, I\n&gt; suppose they might need your muscle,&quot; He said. All Grimlock could do was\n&gt; looked pissed, &quot;Slggin right&quot; is all he said, as he walked past Swoop,\n&gt; and towards Pacifix. He looked down at his future comander, and spat a\n&gt; glob of oil beside him, then stormed out.\n\n\n"}}
