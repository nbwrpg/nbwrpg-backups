He would crush these pathetic ants, one by one.  No matter how\nlong\n&gt; it took.  The behemoth burst out into laughter as autogun fire stung into\nhis\n&gt; back.\n\n&quot;coward? Your the one still a gestalt you wimp!&quot; Kracken yells. Grenade is\nstruck by the optic blasts.\n\n&quot;Ahhhh! The hell?&quot; Grenade says. Serge fires 2 missiles from each shoulder\ncannon (The dinosaur arms) at Oblitertron.\n\n\n&gt; Dark Claw, still in his &quot;vehicle&quot; mode, firing off two missiles, one from\n&gt; each missile launcher installed in his vehicle mode, at the Mafia base.\n\nThe Mafia base is struck and an alarm goes off. It blares as the remianing\nautoguns open fire on Dark Claw.\n\n&gt; Chaos fired off ten rapid optic blasts at the Mafia base.\n\nThe Mafia base is hit harder and fires yet more at Dark Claw.\n\n&gt; Minion fired took out his automatic rifle, firing off twenty-five\nexplosive\n&gt; shells at the Mafia base.\n\nThe explosive shells exploded on the base.\n\n&quot;A tough base like this will last for a while I hope.&quot; Deemos says. He\ndecides to come out to the battle. He comes around the side and fires at\nOblitertron with 2 missiles.\n\n&gt; Unitron, still in tank mode, targeted with his cannon, firing off a single\n&gt; blast at Kracken.\n\nKracken raises his blaster, but is hitm by the missile and falls over. He\naims carefully and fires 4 times at Unitron.\n\n&gt; Sixshot gained altitude, getting a target lock, and firing off two seeking\n&gt; missiles down at Gigas.\n\nGigas aims at the missiles, and fires, destroying one. He remains immobile\nand the other missile hits him, it explodes. He still stands, but is now a\nvery nice black color with alot of scratches.\n\n&quot;Ow. You are now going to die, for I will destroy you.&quot; Gigas says slowly.\nHe fires back rapidly 15 times at SixShot.\n\n\n&gt; Serpentor looked at the Alliance bot who had told him to join the battle.\n&gt; &quot;Fine.&quot; he said, rubbing his mech-fluid soaked face from the shrapnel of\nthe\n&gt; exploding Diskus.  He ran off for the Mafia base.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re to injured.&quot; Scattershot said, taking out a charge and setting it\nin\n&gt; the middle of the pieces of Diskus, the bomb set for 20 seconds.\n\nDiskus&#39;s leg burrowed under ground completely and starrts to move back to\nbase. There was a homing beacon inside of it and it moved rapidly toward the\nbase, being drawn towards it. The bomb explodes and destroys all of the\npieces except for the leg that failed to be noticed. Burning Hammer looked\nat the fire.\n\n&quot;Something is not right here.&quot; Burning Hammer says. He moves away from the\nfire as it grows.\n\n\n"}}
