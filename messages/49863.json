So \nI&#39;ll go ahead and announce I&#39;m running.  Here are my promises:\n\n1. I&#39;ll include &quot;no protohumans&quot; on the rules page so as not to \nconfuse any newbies (a change that&#39;s LONG overdue)\n2. I&#39;ll try to imploy my ideas in a less outlandish way, and with the \nagreement of the rest of the council\n3. I&#39;ll try to create a plot synopsis of the entire Transformers \nhistory and post it on the site for anyone who wants to join, but \ndoesn&#39;t know anything about Transformers (or else hasn&#39;t seen either \nG1 or Beast Wars).\n4. I will NOT ban LN for no reason other than I don&#39;t like him\n5. I will remain open to all new ideas, even if they interferre with \nmy own\n6. I will try to get new, capable members, and motivate the old ones.\n\nHave I won even 1 single vote yet (I&#39;m not asking will you vote for \nme, simply if you think there&#39;s a good chance anyone will)?\n\n\n"}}
