I think I&#39;d like to roll\n&gt; with that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Oct 28, 2011, at 12:19 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Basically I am using a lot of the animated events in the background\n&gt;&gt; events of Cybertron. Basically the world went from G1/G2 to Animated\n&gt;&gt; to Beast Wars back on old Earth - Beast Machines never happened.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So for Yokatron: (Yes I am stealing the name Prowl-Z from Adam for the\n&gt;&gt; name of the animated version of Prowl, I hope he doesn&#39;t mind)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ***************\n&gt;&gt; Yoketron is a wise old Autobot responsible for training the Autobot\n&gt;&gt; Cyber-Ninja Corps at the Cyber-Ninja Dojo, but more importantly, he\n&gt;&gt; protects the Autobots&#39; cache of protoforms, which will have to be\n&gt;&gt; activated if Project Omega fails. He is a master of many martial arts,\n&gt;&gt; including Circuit-Su, Metallikato, Crystalocution, diffusion,\n&gt;&gt; Tekkaido, Tahtib-tron and Laser Lathi.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One of Yoketron&#39;s former students, Lockdown, betrayed him, stealing\n&gt;&gt; most of the protoforms for the Decepticons, and leaving Yoketron to\n&gt;&gt; die. Prowl-Z returned during the aftermath, and he attempted to revive\n&gt;&gt; Yoketron by transferring his spark to a protoform that had been left\n&gt;&gt; behind. Though Yoketron formed from the new Protoform, Yoketron\n&gt;&gt; chastised Prowl-Z for not accepting fate, telling him he &quot;...must not\n&gt;&gt; sacrifice a piece of the future to bring back the past.&quot; As he told\n&gt;&gt; Prowl-Z that he would understand when his time came, Yoketron\n&gt;&gt; relinquished his spark, and his new body grayed.\n&gt;&gt; **************\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So yes Yoketron is dead, killed by Lockdown, however that leaves\n&gt;&gt; several things open - In who&#39;s employ was Lockdown, it could easily\n&gt;&gt; have been BLUDGEON. The manner of Yoketron&#39;s death has been kept from\n&gt;&gt; the public at large. In fact I would imagine that the story is that\n&gt;&gt; since he was considered old, that he sucummed to the ravages of time.\n&gt;&gt; MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS STORY.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am unsure at what point Tuscon and Nightshift left the Dojo and came\n&gt;&gt; to Earth, so he may not be aware that Yoketron is dead, or if he is,\n&gt;&gt; he may not know how. I will leave that up to Sandy how much Tuscon and\n&gt;&gt; Nightshift know and how much they may have told Straight Shot.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However the revelation that Bludgeon could have been behind it, or\n&gt;&gt; even part of of it at all would be new knowledge. Most will not have\n&gt;&gt; any knowledge unless they have some special connection to someone who\n&gt;&gt; was in on matters, or was in it themselves.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I invite questions and/or comments.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
