It is obvious that none of the trio were up f=\r\nor battle as \nthey were still beaten and battered from thier own conflicts =\r\nearlier. \nThey swiftly move into the base, making thier way towards the \nre=\r\ncharging chambers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Skorponok shifted form as well, Zarak, once again =\r\nmerging with him \nso they became one being once more. In his massive robot =\r\nmode, he too \ntowards the base, glancing around at the ruined landscape he =\r\nshook \nhis head and then passed inside following Rodimus and crew. \n&gt; \n&gt; OO=\r\nC: Pretty much Rodimus, Cyclonus, Scourge and Scorponok will be \ngoing to t=\r\nhe recharge chambers, seeing as they were pretty much on \nthe frontlines of=\r\n the last battle and are in need of repairs, unless \nsomething else interve=\r\nnes. \n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
