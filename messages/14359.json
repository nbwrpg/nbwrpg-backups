She couldn&#39;t understand why Land Mine was \nhaunting her so.  She knew she had done the right thing.  She knew \nshe had tried to help her friend and do what she thought was the \nright thing to do at the time.  Had she known the pain she would go \nthrough, she thought she would still do it again to save her friend \nfrom torture and pain.  But now she was in pain herself, \nShe kept running and started yelling &quot;LEAVE ME ALONE LAND MINE! GO \nAWAY!&quot; As she ran further up the hillside. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; Drillbit followed KitKat, untill she yelled for him to leave her.
