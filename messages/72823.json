Consoles and monitors lines the walls as well work centers\nspaced through out the room. The only problem is that certain sections\nlooked as if they had taken heavy damage. Parts had been ripped away,\ntorn apart and generally mauled. There was no general rhyme or reason\nto, it just looked like general chaos.\n\nThere was no power in this room and all the lights were off. The only\nlights were from what NIGHTSHIFT and PROWL were shining.\n\nThere was a lift positioned in the center of the room, its doors\nhaving claw marks on it as well. It also was shut off.\n\nOn the far side of the room was where the communications was located,\nthrough the door that POLAR CLAW had instructed.\n\nThe communications room looked to be in a lot better shape. The walls\nwere lined with various panels and stations desinged with the idea of\nanalyzing communications and detecting even encrypted data.\n\nIt geneally looked whole, very little damage had been done here.\n\nPROWL looked around and nodded, &quot;So, how much do you know about\ncircuit board repair?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
