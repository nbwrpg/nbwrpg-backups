Seeing that he was very \nuncomfortable and edgy.\nHowever, at least he had lowered the gun now.\n\nThe mode shifted her weight for a moment as Prowl tooka step towards her, \nher posture still mainly stiff and alert.\nHer head tilting as she heard him say that word again, or was it a name?\nShe knew it, but the memory just wasn&#39;t coming up.\n\nWith caution she slowly stretched her neck out towards the approaching bot, \nsniffing and testing the air.\nThe scent, she knew. And she knew it belonged to him. Why couldn&#39;t she \nremember?!\n\nA small growl trickled out from between her teeth, but one that was not \nthreatening, more...content.\nShe wanted to know just who this man was, and to see if she could come up \nwith the reason why he seemed so familier.\n\nThe conciouse thoughts of the fembot within were there, but the thoughts of \nboth the beast modes were something else.\nThey were using her thoughts to calm them, but only to suddenly take over \nand strike out. Louring the prey close for the kill.\nBut none of that showed on the outside, while she stretched her head further \nand tested the scent.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
