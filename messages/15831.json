One of his shoulder blasters swirls around, getting a \nlock \n&gt; on the chip. All it would take is one shot... On low power, it \ncould \n&gt; melt the chip without damaging Spears too much.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, there could be a fool-proof program, that could \n&gt; deactivate the bot if the chip was destroyed. Striker sighs. One\n&gt; thing \n&gt; was for sure, he was not going to kill Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Report away,&quot; he says under his breath, trying to convince himself \n&gt; that it was the chip talking, not Spears. He looks through the hole\n&gt; in \n&gt; the door. There was no choice but to knock out Spears, not if the\n&gt; chip \n&gt; would make her run and tell Prebon everything that was happening.\n&gt; \n&gt; His shoulder blasters charge up again, but Striker stops himself \nfrom \n&gt; firing. He couldn&#39;t do it, he couldn&#39;t shoot Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey,&quot; he says, an idea occuring to him, &quot;Can you go fetch Prebon? \nI \n&gt; need to speak to him.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
