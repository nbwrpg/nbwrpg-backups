At last, he finally knocked \n&gt; some sense into him.  He follows his comrade&#39;s signature until he arrives \n&gt; at his side.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;About time you listened to reason.  Welcome back.  Oh, by the way, be \n&gt; prepared, Nightshift and Rat Trap may not be so accepting upon your \n&gt; return. Anyway, we have to find Nightlight and Darkhawk, who is really \n&gt; Windlord.  I suggest you find Nightlight, I find Windlord and we get the \n&gt; pit out of here as fast as we can.  If we get separated, meet me outside \n&gt; the fortress by the front fascade, you&#39;ll know who to look for, big, \n&gt; silver missile truck, that&#39;s me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside Rat Trap gets the com link.  And as Tucson Prime would have \n&gt; suspected, he blows his stack, upon hearing Rodimus&#39;s words.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Grrrrrr!  WHERE THE PIT HAVE YA BEEN ALL THIS TIME SPEEDY HUH?!  WORKN&#39; \n&gt; FOR HYDRAS WERE WE?!  ABOUT SLAGGN&#39; TIME YA SNAPPED OUTA YOUR LITTLE \n&gt; TRANCE PAL! AND BY THE WAY, I&#39;M MAD BECAUSE YOU HAD THE NERVE TA SLAG \n&gt; WHEELS WHEN HE WAS JUST TRYN&#39; TA HELP YA! SOME FRIEND YOU&#39;RE TURN&#39;N OUT TA \n&gt; BE!  C&#39;mon Quickstride, let&#39;s get back ta the ark.  I feel better now that \n&gt; I blew off some much needed steam.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson could hear Rat Trap through his com link.  He glances back to \n&gt; Rodimus one last time.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Err, I&#39;ll - see what I can do to resolve this little issue.. Like I \n&gt; said, it could take some time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then opens his com link to Rat Trap.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rat Trap, it&#39;s me, Tucson Prime, I&#39;m all right little guy, and believe it \n&gt; or not, Rodimus is responsible for my jailbreak.  We&#39;ll see you guys soon, \n&gt; okay?\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap responds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You got it Wheels, I almost thought you were done for.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In his cell, Nightshift joins up with Kup, and gets Rodimus&#39;s com link \n&gt; too.  Like Rat Trap, he also shows some signs of being a slight displeased \n&gt; about his recent alliance with Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I wonder how long this is gonna last before he falls for another one of \n&gt; Hydra&#39;s scemes?  I dunno about you Kup, but as far as I&#39;m concerned, \n&gt; Tucson Prime&#39;s my leader.  This whole thing about Rodimus, still creeps me \n&gt; out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He replies to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nightshift here, I got the memmo. But unless you want me ta be cool with \n&gt; ya, ya gotta prove ta us that ya ain&#39;t gonna slip through the cracks \n&gt; again, and is this some sorta trick ta put us down even deeper?  I dunno \n&gt; Rodimus, but after this, I kinda don&#39;t trust ya.  I&#39;ll do as told, I ain&#39;t \n&gt; gonna disobey, but I&#39;m gonna run those orders through Tucson Prime first, \n&gt; since he&#39;s been able ta resist this slag ball&#39;s scheme with no problem. \n&gt; He never quit on you and I ain&#39;t never gonna quit on him.  This is \n&gt; Nightshift, peace out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He replies his last phrase with a cool tone of voice.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yeah right, two years he serves Hydras, and all of a sudden he&#39;s all \n&gt; high&#39;n mighty again.  Yo, Tucson Prime, Nightshift here, what&#39;s the next \n&gt; phase of the plan?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson catches Nightshift&#39;s com link.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nightlight and Windlord still need to be recovered.  Windlord goes by the \n&gt; name of Darkhawk, and it may be difficult to snap him out of his shell \n&gt; program.  I suggest you proceede with caution, and if you find Darkhawk \n&gt; before I do, contact me.  Don&#39;t try to handle him yourself, he may be \n&gt; rather crafty.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gotchya.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime senses a cool tone in his comrade&#39;s voice.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nightshift, are you all right? You seem a bit disturbed.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift replies.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I dunno sir, I hate ta say this but I dunno if I can trust Rodimus after \n&gt; two years of him workn&#39; for the enemy.  I can&#39;t trust someone who&#39;s turned \n&gt; his back on his faction, it just ain&#39;t right.  And now he acts all high&#39;n \n&gt; mighty.  What next?  He&#39;s gonna turn his spoiler on us &#39;n really slag us \n&gt; good?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I was afraid of this.  Our return to the Ark is going to be a rocky one. \n&gt; I think a conference will be in order once we get back.  One between all \n&gt; of us.  I know what you&#39;re feeling and I can&#39;t blame you for your \n&gt; apprehensions, and neither can I blame Rat Trap for his. I too wonder why \n&gt; and how, but we have to get past this and at least try to rebuild our \n&gt; alliance with Rodimus who is now trying hard to redeem himself.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift replies.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll try.  But don&#39;t expect miracles.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson smiles gently.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Thanks Nightshift.  I appreciate it.  Now, do you have any stasis cuffs \n&gt; available?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift takes inventory of his restaint supplies.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;One pair.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson looks in his possession as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Same here.  All right, actually if you do find Darkhawk, try and get the \n&gt; cuffs on him if you can.  But don&#39;t harm him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift salutes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Copy that, Peace out Tucson Prime.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not long before Nightshift goes to his duties, as Tucson Prime \n&gt; reaches Kup.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Kup, I know you&#39;re good at keeping the peace.  I have a feeling Rat Trap \n&gt; and Night Shift are still a bit steamed off at Rodimus.  You have my \n&gt; permission to break up any squabbles that might ensue between them.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With his last instruction, Tucson Prime carries out his part of the \n&gt; mission.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hydras/Darkhawk/nightlight:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nighlight woke up scared, the alarms was ranging and she doesnt knew what\n&gt;&gt; was goin on now.
