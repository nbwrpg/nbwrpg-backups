She knew she had smelled their scent earlier, but now they were \nattacking.  She followed her first mouse insticts, and that was to \nrun.  And run she did.  In mouse mode, she scurried off into the \nforest as fast as she could. &quot;Of all the rotten luck.&quot; She scurried \nand was about 50 yards away.  She turned her head back to see if any \nof them were following her.  She was still looking behind her and \ndidn&#39;t see the low lying branch of a tree.  She ran square into it, \nhead first.  She fell to the ground, knocked unconsious. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt; \n&gt; He followed, and continued to shoot at the retreating bots.
