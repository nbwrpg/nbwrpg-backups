My\n&gt; parents were\n&gt; &gt; both killed in cold blood, it is a terrible thing. Zeni misses them\n&gt; &gt; terribly, you aren&#39;t alone. Gramps misses them, too, my mom was his\n&gt; &gt; daughter, and my dad was his daughter&#39;s husband. It isn&#39;t very fun\n&gt; in my\n&gt; &gt; memories neither, Trinity, but I&#39;m trying to replace the bad\n&gt; memories with\n&gt; &gt; the good ones, I continue to do so every day of my life, and so does\n&gt; &gt; Gramps...and Zeni. Technosis has faced hardships, too. Maybe more\n&gt; awful ones\n&gt; &gt; than we&#39;ll ever know, and she&#39;s still trucking along. Come back\n&gt; with me,\n&gt; &gt; Trinity, don&#39;t run away. Zeni needs you...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
