She had to talk to someone \nfrom the Maximal side as Vulois instructed to do.  She kept going \nuntill she came to the tree just outside of the ship.  She figured \nthat she was just out of the range of the autoguns.  She tried her \nscanner again but it wouldn&#39;t read. She hit it against the \ntree, &quot;Work damn you, work.&quot; She hit it a few more times and looked \nat it. It was working again. &quot;Holy Cybertron, it worked? I should use \nthat technique on other stuff.&quot; She checked the scanner again.  this \ntime it showed a Maximal near her. &quot;Alright.&quot; she said in  hushed \nvoice to herself. \n\n\n"}}
