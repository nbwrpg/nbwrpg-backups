He \njust hoped that it was a typical Pred following her. &quot;All guns no \nbrains&quot; he said to himself. The Pred broadcast information on all \nchannels, maybe he didn&#39;t know how to tap into direct communication. \nLunarpine didn&#39;t want to underestimate the Pred, it could be a trap.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; OOC:( Shadow Wing is a Recon Scout.That is her primary function.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Shadow Wing:\n&gt; \n&gt; She heard a voice on her comm link.  It was Lunarpine.  She didn&#39;t \n&gt; want to answer it.  She knew he could fight this pred who was after \n&gt; her.  But she wanted to prove that she could make it. She not only \n&gt; wanted to prove it to him, but to herself as well.  She opened her \n&gt; comm link. &quot;I have a Pred on my tail feathers, but I think I lost \n&gt; him.&quot; She looked about and still didn&#39;t see the Pred. &quot;Yeah, I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; see him so I guess I lost him.&quot; She sighed. She liked hearing his \n&gt; voice, but she still didn&#39;t want to face him.  She knew she would \n&gt; have to, but she wanted to hold off on that as long as possable.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; She closed her comm link and flew off to the west \nagain.  \n&gt; she rose into the sky to get a good look around.  She used her \n&gt; telescopic vision and didn&#39;t see the Pred.  She flew closer to the \n&gt; ground.  She knew that when she used her comm link, that she could \nbe \n&gt; traced.
