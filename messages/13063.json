I&#39;ve been trying to find the leader \nfor some time now.  I&#39;m supposed to talk to them to try to get them \nto come to the peace talks.  I know it&#39;s kind of strange to have a \npredacon like me talk of peace like this.  But I have to try.  These \npeace talks may be the only way of ending the war. At least I hope \nthey end the war.&quot;  She was starting to get discouraged.  She had \nbeen there for so long and had yet to even meet with the leader.\n&quot;Oh well, I&#39;ll just have to wait a little longer I guess.&quot;  She \nturned and leaned up against the wall with her head still hung down.\n\nShe had been on the maximal ship so long, she wondered if she was \nbecoming a maximal herself.  She wrapped her wings around her body \nand tried to think.\n\nShe turned her head and looked at Kluster.  &quot;Who is the leader then \nif your not hte leader of the maximals?&quot; It struck her that no one \nhad even told her who was in charge yet.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster shakes his head. &quot;I&#39;m the commander of the ship, not of the \n&gt; Maximals,&quot; he replies to Battera, &quot;The Maximal Commander is \nsomewhere else.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
