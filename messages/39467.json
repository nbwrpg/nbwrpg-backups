He waves his \nhand indicating that he is going to attack in three. He counts down, \nand pulls guns out, aiming them at the bots, then stops. He \ndoesn&#39;t want anybody to get caught in the crossfire. Knowing that \nhe is not visible to the enemy, he starts to crawl to the nearst \nmountain, which was right beside him. He gets behind it, gets up \nand runs up the mountain, opening a commlink to Grounded, \n&quot;Trying to get higher so there is no crossfire.&quot; He keeps going.\n\nAxis still wondering where Lokk was, pulls his gun over the podd, \nand fires two laser blasts at Barrymore, and the pulls back behind \nthe pod, his laser charging again. \n\n\nOn 8 Jul 2001, at 22:32, Jordan Guthrie wrote:\n\n&gt; Grounded popped out of the ground right behind Lokk.  He sent a comm\n&gt; link.  &quot;This is Grounded. Split the fork and choose a pea.&quot; he said\n&gt; hoping Lokk would understand his code.  He then went beside Lokk in\n&gt; his mole form walking slowly and stealthly behind him.  Using\n&gt; vibrations through the ground he determined within a few some odd\n&gt; yards they would be directly behind the enemy.\n\n"}}
