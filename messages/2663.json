It was obvious she was \nupset. He frowns as an idea comes to him, an idea that probably should have \ncame a long time ago.\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; he says, looking at Iron Raptor, &quot;If Liono won&#39;t run this show, \nsomeone else needs to.&quot;\n\nHe sighs, his eyes a bit sad. He didn&#39;t like to do this, he was not a \ntraitorous bot. But there was no choice. The maximals needed to be organized. \nBesides, Iron Raptor was upset, and he didn&#39;t like that.\n\n&quot;All maximals,&quot; he says to all the maximals over his comm-link, &quot;Report to \nthe war room immediately. That&#39;s an order.&quot;\n\nhe then notices Rhinox. &quot;Hello, I am Prowl and this is Iron Raptor,&quot; he says \nas a greeting, &quot;You are new?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker&#39;s eyes slightly widen as he hears Prowl over his comm-link. Things \nwere taking an unexpected turn. He looks at Archangel and Sniper.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go see what Prowl has to say,&quot; he says, setting off toward the war \nroom.\n\n"}}
