You had Scamrock grab them, \nwhich would cause them to explode because of impact.  That was your mistake \nby doing that.  Also, I read in a few posts that the People&#39;s Base exploded, \nI didn&#39;t see the actual post where it exploded, and I never saw your &#39;sister&#39; \n, but evidently since I didn&#39;t get the e-mail, you can&#39;t blame me)\n\nThe Oblitercons (Oblitertron)/Nemesis Enforcer/Anubis/Hades/Unitron/Koga \nShuko/Scattershot:\n\nOblitertron raised both of his arms in triumph, splitting into five seperate \npieces, each transforming into a robot, the Oblitercons landing in a line.\n\nDark One: &quot;Alright, the base is crushed, this...Dracona&#39;s base is in \nruins...her forces are destroyed.&quot;\n\nBreakdown: &quot;I think Nemesis called for reinforcements.&quot;\n\nPyro: &quot;Then let&#39;s fire a few shots off and pull back to re-energize.&quot;\n\nHiss: &quot;Yes, let&#39;s.&quot;\n\nScavenger raised his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at Scamrock, the \nother Oblitercons charging off towards the Alliance base, not really caring \nabout finishing them off, leaving Nemesis and Scattershot alone with the four \nNewcomers.\n-------------\nNemesis Enforcer fired two optic blasts at the People&#39;s base&#39;s rubble, \nturning, a clawed fist sending him slamming into a trunk.  Anubis grabbed him \nby the neck, kneeing him in the face twice, backhanded him with claws.\n-------------\nScattershot fired off twenty explosive bullets down randomly at the Radicons, \ndeciding he really didn&#39;t enjoy them without a bomb, he&#39;d have to go bumb \nsome off other people.  Raising an &#39;eyebrow&#39;, he fired off ten shots, Anubis \nslamming into a tree, the tree hitting the ground.  Landing to the ground, \nhis side aching from previous wounds, he didn&#39;t spot Unitron from behind, six \nlaser bolts tearing into the Alliance member&#39;s back, sending him crashing to \nthe ground.\n------------\n&quot;Excellent, Unitron.  Let&#39;s move out!  Hades, grab Anubis.  It&#39;s time to get \nrejuvinated.  The people here shouldn&#39;t hinder our plans, their base is \ndestroyed.&quot;  Unitron ordered, Hades picking Anubis up, the Newcomers heading \nback towards their downed ship to recieve repairs.\n\n"}}
