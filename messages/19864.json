It was time to put an end to this battle and to the traitor \n&gt; once and for all. Lunarpine couldn&#39;t let the fact that they once \n&gt; served together matter. At this moment only two things mattered to \n&gt; him. Winning or losing would be the difference between who stands \n&gt; tall and who crawls away licking thier wounds.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC Thank you and have a nice day.\n\n\n"}}
