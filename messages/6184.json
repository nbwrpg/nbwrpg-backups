She was very confused.  She \ndidn&#39;t know what was wrong with her.  She knew that she was n ormally \ndriven by her instincts.  Normally her logic circuits were helpful in \ngetting things accoumplished.  But since she met Lunarpine, her logic \ncircuits were going bonkers.  She decided to go to her quarters and \nrun diognostics.  She hoped a small wire waqs just loose and that \nthis confusion in her would easily be solved.  She ran her \ndiognostics.  She found no such wire.\n&quot;Blast! Well, so much for an easy cure to this problem.&quot;\nShe went out of her quarters.  She looked for Lunarpine.  When she \nfound him in the base, she walked up to him,&quot;Uh, look.  I&#39;m terrably \nsorry for my behavoir earlier.  I was wrong.  I should have faced my \nproblems instead of running from them.  But I was wondering, since \nyou are a greater fighter than I,I was wondering if you could teach \nme how to fight. I mean, you showed me that I could use a lot of \nimprovement on my technequ.  I was wondering if you could help me \nhelp me to improve?&quot; She looked into his eyes and took one step \ncloser to him, &quot;Please?&quot; \n\n\n"}}
