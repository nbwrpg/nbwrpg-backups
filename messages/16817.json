Aquarious, Paddle Tail, and Nighteyes followed closely. Megatron \ntold them that they were near the armory, Inferno&#39;s favorite hangout. And \nwhile they were there they could easily pick up some wepons.\n    &quot;Paddle Tail, the door is locked. Get it open now! You two, keep a look \nout!&quot; Megatron barked at them to there surprize. Paddle Tail quickly went to \nthe door and fiddled with the controls.\n\n    Inferno heard them at the door and grabbed his gun. No one was going to \ntake him alive, not with out a fight. He was going to make them burn.\n    &quot;Invaders!&quot; He yelled as the door opened and Megatron marched though, \nblasting frantically before Inferno knew what happened. The insect went down \nquickly, and tragically.\n    &quot;Night Eyes, Aquarious, take him. Paddle Tail, you select the wepons. \nHurry, time is short!&quot; he barked agian sending the Maximals scurrying. They \ndid as they were told and soon were on there way agian.\n\n    It wasnt a long trip until Megatron saw Terrorsaur walking towrds them. \nHis team was concealed behinde a turn in the corridor. But, being the ever \nloyal Terrorsaur, there would be no problem.\n    &quot;My favorite little minion, come to help your leader escape?&quot; Megatron \nsaid stepping into the corridor.\n\n    Aracnia led the way, followed by Paralysis and Aerostreak. All they heard \nwas Tarantulas screaming. They were armed and couldnt for the life of them \nfigure out what was going on.\n    They entered Megatron holding chamber to find the tube smashed and the \nMaximals gone. Tarantulas was on his knees curseing the sky. \n    &quot;He&#39;s escaped! I want all Predacons to search this ship until the four of \nthem are found! Now!&quot; Aracnia screamed as she burst from the room heading \ntowrds the bridge.\n\n"}}
