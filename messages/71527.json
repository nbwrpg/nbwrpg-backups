He noted that\nTUSCON was being taken to a CR chamber for some well deserved rest and\nrepairs and that the rest of the teams were readying themselves for\nwhat is to come.\n\nLooking over at TORCA he nodded, &quot;Take up the security post until we\nget things taken care of here and get a few patrols out, it has been\nawefully quiet I am afraind that soomething ewlse is about to happen.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from the large robot, TORCA&#39;s head nearly reaching the\nceiling. &quot;Yes sir.&quot; he said deeply and formally.\n\n&quot;I am on my way to the medical chamber.&quot; He said. He was about to\nleave when the green robot, Celeron, said something . . .\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; Celeron didn&#39;t immediately answer, remaining silent and glaring at Leo.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I like to think of myself as a Mercenary.&quot; he said, taking a glance around\n&gt; the room.  &quot;No, that&#39;s not right.  More like, an entrpeneur.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;For me, there&#39;s no loyalty, just interests. I don&#39;t consider you my\n&gt; enemies. As long as our relations remain amicable, I see no reason to\n&gt; fight.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;That sounds interesting.&quot; LEO PRIME said as he turned back to\nCELERON. &quot;I too have no wish to fight and Hydras has been a thorn in\nthe side for many.&quot; LEO&#39;s words are calm and thoughtful.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Perseus opened the door to the room, and seeing the Predicon decided to\n&gt; slip in quietly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I think the reason I&#39;m alligned with the Bushido Predicons is that sense of\n&gt; honor.  While we are warriors, we don&#39;t enjoy fighting for the sake of\n&gt; fighting.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, things are not going well.  Hydras has been encroaching on our\n&gt; territory and we don&#39;t have the manpower to handle him.  Kratos is too proud\n&gt; to accept help from Maximals.  So my friends sit at the bottom of the ocean,\n&gt; and I lack the resources to handle a rescue attempt.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;So who are your friends?&quot; LEO PRIME said cutting to the chase, &quot;What\ncan you tell me of the Maximals that are onboard the ship, and what of\nthe criminals that may have gotten off, and most importantly how can\nwe help?&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\nLord Perseus was now right next to Celeron.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Greetings, I&#39;m Lord Perseus of the Pasificus Maximals.  Sorry I&#39;m late.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO turned to look at PERSEUS, &quot;Greetings Lord Perseus I am Leo Prime,\nnewly sent by the council and have only just recently arrived.&quot; He\nsmiled. &quot;It is good to meet you Perseus.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
