That was not what he had meant. He \nhad wanted Spears to actually go and get Prebon, so he could work \nwithout being watched.\n\nHe sighs as he looks at her. &quot;No, you don&#39;t, Spears. We&#39;ll get out of \nthis, don&#39;t worry.&quot;\n\nHe was pacing the cell at this point, trying to think of a way to get \nthem both out. He swore under his breath. Why couldn&#39;t Prowl be here? \nHe was good a plans. Striker turns his mind back to the problem, \nremindning himself that there was no use regretting the unchangeble.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Spears::\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at Striker and nodded.  &quot;That I can do for you.&quot;  She \n&gt; opened her link, &quot;Master Prebon, the prisoner Striker wishes an \n&gt; audiance with you.&quot;  She looked at Striker, &quot;For your own sake, \n&gt; please don&#39;t do anything foolish. It could lead to your \n&gt; termination.&quot;  She then looked down, &quot;Or mine.&quot; she said in a \n&gt; whisper. She turned her back to the cell door.

One of his shoulder blasters swirls around, getting a \n&gt; lock \n&gt; &gt; on the chip. All it would take is one shot... On low power, it \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt; melt the chip without damaging Spears too much.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On the other hand, there could be a fool-proof program, that\ncould \n&gt; &gt; deactivate the bot if the chip was destroyed. Striker sighs. One\n&gt; &gt; thing \n&gt; &gt; was for sure, he was not going to kill Spears.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Report away,&quot; he says under his breath, trying to convince \nhimself \n&gt; &gt; that it was the chip talking, not Spears. He looks through the \nhole\n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the door. There was no choice but to knock out Spears, not if the\n&gt; &gt; chip \n&gt; &gt; would make her run and tell Prebon everything that was happening.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His shoulder blasters charge up again, but Striker stops himself \n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; firing. He couldn&#39;t do it, he couldn&#39;t shoot Spears.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey,&quot; he says, an idea occuring to him, &quot;Can you go fetch\nPrebon? \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; need to speak to \n\n\n"}}
