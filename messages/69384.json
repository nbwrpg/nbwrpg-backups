The cargo ramp lowered and the crew walked\n&gt; out into the scene of the disaster. They were greeted by Lord Perseus\n&gt; who stopped digging through debris to fill them in on what happened.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Right before the tidal wave hit, we saw a massive ship fly overhead,\n&gt; not 300m above us.&quot; he said. &quot;Something that massive falling from\n&gt; orbit could easily explain the force of the water.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;How&#39;s the rest of the city,&quot; asked Salveo.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Not good. Most the people escaped to their shelters, however the\n&gt; buildings were all destroyed. Except the tower and several on the far\n&gt; side of the island.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The shuttles?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ours was destroyed, a few were in the air when the wave hit.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I dont think we can rebuild this.&quot; said Salveo after a moment of\n&gt; looking at the devistation.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I think its possible, but unwise. I think this gives us a new\n&gt; opportunity to rejoin our Maximal allies and pool our resources. So\n&gt; for the moment, we should recover what we can and put it into the\n&gt; shuttle, then assist Atlantis in anyway possible.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rejoin Lord Elder? Will that work? And what about Atlantis?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Atlantis will be safe from the Unicronians; they wont bother with a\n&gt; few hundred scientists and fisherman. What they want is to destroy\n&gt; us, and they will follow us wherever we decide to have our base. As\n&gt; for that crashed ship, I dont think its wise to mount a expedition\n&gt; while the city lies in ruin and we remain baseless.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Right, so priority one, help the city and recover what we can from\n&gt; our base.&quot; replied Salveo.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Correct.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 4/30/09, airly2002@... &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Talon:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Talon nodded and Followed Lord Elder.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kup.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kup followed salveo but he still regrets to leave Roddy, windlord and\n&gt;&gt; Nightlight behind\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: Kraftlos\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, April 27, 2009 8:25 PM\n&gt;&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: The Crash Landing and Aftermath\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus opened the door to the lower level of the base, and water\n&gt;&gt; poured into the room. He motioned for everyone to follow.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;It looks like that ship we saw crash landed in the ocean...&quot; he said\n&gt;&gt; mater of factly. &quot;Look at this place.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What had once been their base was now a slab of concrete and metal\n&gt;&gt; with the ocasional structural support poking up from the foundation.\n&gt;&gt; The city, in just as bad of shape, was errily flat with a large number\n&gt;&gt; of buildings simply washed away.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Looks like we need a new base.&quot; said Guardia steping quietly behind\n&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus, sloshing water with each step.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;This base was build from an old hanger, it wasnt intended to take\n&gt;&gt; that kind of punishment. We could rebuild here, or we could find a\n&gt;&gt; better location. First we need to make sure the townsfolk are ok;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll try to signal Salveo&#39;s team, we&#39;re going to need that shuttle.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Celeron lept up from his chair to stair at some strange radar\n&gt;&gt; readings. An entire sector on the map had temporarily darkened, then\n&gt;&gt; went clear again. The mass that represnted Atlantis didnt look right.\n&gt;&gt; He knew it had changed in the last minion attack; but this didnt even\n&gt;&gt; look like the same city anymore.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Blast... looks like we need to go see what&#39;s going on.&quot; said Celeron\n&gt;&gt; to himself. &quot;Predecons! Report!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OOC: This would be the Iron Skull predecon base,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Salveo walked into the room where Lord Elder was working.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Atlantis was just devastated by a tidal wave. We&#39;re going to have to\n&gt;&gt; go back there and assist them.; our base was destroyed.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 4/24/09, airly2002@... &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Talon:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;WHAT THE PIT IS GOING HERE????&quot; Cursed Talon, in a minion way, while she\n&gt;&gt;&gt; followed guardia and Lord Perseus\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Kraftlos\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 21, 2009 6:08 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: The Crash Landing and Aftermath\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The engines had been losing power for the last day and a half; but\n&gt;&gt;&gt; finally\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the gigantic craft could no longer fight the forces that pulled on it and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; its orbit began to decay. Knowing that their only hope of survival was to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; safely crash land, the pilot picked an open area of ocean and tried to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; approach at a safe angle to slow itself enough to keep the ship intact.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus and his crew walked along the bridge that crossed the gap\n&gt;&gt;&gt; between the part of the island where the hangers were located and the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; peninsula area where the base sat. Suddenly the sky became dark and a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; rumbling noise could be heard, growing louder and louder. He looked up to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; see almost the whole sky occupied by a massive starship seemly heading\n&gt;&gt;&gt; straight for the island. The Atlantis emergency alarm started to sound\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; civilians rushed to their shelters.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Everyone! To the base! Hurry!&quot; ordered Perseus breaking out into a run.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The rumbling sound continued to get louder. As Perseus and his crew\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reached\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the base door, it was quickly opened for them then shut behind them. He\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ordered everyone to move the lower level of the base. As the ship passed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; over the island, the sound grew so loud that the ground shook and weaker\n&gt;&gt;&gt; parts of buildings started to crumble, as in an earthquake. The ship\n&gt;&gt;&gt; traveled for another three miles before it touched down in the deep ocean\n&gt;&gt;&gt; waters. The force of the impact sent the ship hundreds of feet below the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; surface and it continued to sink until coming to rest on the top of an\n&gt;&gt;&gt; underwater mountain. The mass of water displaced by the ship started a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; massive tsunami-like wave, going out in all directions.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The ground began to shake again and the lights flickered inside the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Maximal\n&gt;&gt;&gt; base.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Sir, what&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing the last heavy door to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; underground section of the base.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The lights continued to flicker, then went out.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; At that moment the ten-story-high wall of water struck Atlantis from the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; east, picking up all the boats in the harbor and tossing them onto the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; land.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The parts of the docks that were not made of concrete were pushed up and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; destroyed. A moment later the water hit the buildings in the lower wharf\n&gt;&gt;&gt; area and they immediately collapsed under the intense weight of water.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Likewise the metal dome that made up the upper story of the Maximal base\n&gt;&gt;&gt; was\n&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately ripped from its foundations and carried away, along with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; everything in the command center, the armory, mess hall, and the main\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bank\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of CR chambers were also picked up and carried away.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The lower floor of the base had a large metal slab to protect it from\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bombing, and as the water continued to pour over it, everything on the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; upper\n&gt;&gt;&gt; floors was ripped away, leaving a clean plate of metal sitting at the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bottom\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of the crater that was the base. The buildings along the center of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; town\n&gt;&gt;&gt; were a little sturdier and remained standing, though heavily damaged. The\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hanger and all the craft in it were picked up and thrown into the ocean.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; As the water came to tower it filled up the deep trench around the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; structure\n&gt;&gt;&gt; then the wall hit it, wrapping it entirely except for the top five\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stories,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; damaging supports, breaking out all the windows and destroying the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bridges\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that allowed access to the tower. The wave then continued across the rest\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of the island, destroying buildings and carrying away the mass of debris,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and then all was eerily quiet.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
