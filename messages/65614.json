We have picked up an signal of a bot \n=\r\nwithin the\n&gt; city.  We were unable to detect its affiliation.  Approximatel=\r\ny 4 \nhours ago,\n&gt; the bot charged our shields, but eventually gave up.  We =\r\nhave \nreason to\n&gt; believe it is loose in the city right now, and I don&#39;t be=\r\nlieve \nAtlantis\n&gt; police forces are capable of combating something like thi=\r\ns.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately we did not get a picture of the bot, however seeing =\r\n\nas it\n&gt; attacked our base, I think we need to handle this with great \ncaut=\r\nion.  We\n&gt; don&#39;t want to be caught off guard.  For now, we need to capture =\r\n\nthis bot and\n&gt; bring it back to our holding cell through the underground e=\r\nntrance \nto the\n&gt; base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus and Nightlight, since you are not offi=\r\ncially members of \nour group,\n&gt; you may choose whether or not to join us, h=\r\nowever the rest of you \nneed to\n&gt; gear up and be ready for this mission imm=\r\nediately after this \nbriefing ends.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before I continue, do you wish to =\r\njoin us Rodimus?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Rodimus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus: I&#39;ll gladly join you, howev=\r\ner request that Nightlight \nstay behind\n&gt; and watch over Elita.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord p=\r\nerseus turned to Nightlight\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do you wish to stay behind?&quot; he asked.\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
