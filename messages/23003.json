I say we attack the engine room. but your\ntactic of attack is sound.&quot;\nHe then turns to Killfest.\n&quot;Order all your troops to join us. I&#39;ll do the same. We&#39;ll attack the\nengine room wave after wave. Inform them to kill any of Meg&#39;s troops\nthey encounter on the way.&quot;\nHe turns back to StarScream and Dollon.\n&quot;You guys stick with me. We&#39;re command team Alpha. Killfest, take a\ncouple of your guys. Have them with you at all times. We cant avord to\nloose a commander. Not again. You&#39;ll be command team Beta.\nOnce we have are troops set we&#39;ll attack.&quot;\n\n"}}
