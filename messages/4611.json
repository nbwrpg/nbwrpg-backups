She heard what Stingra said to\n&gt;Quicktrike.  Shge felt sorry for him.  She turned her head to look at\n&gt;Scorponok.  She liked him.  She wanted him to bfe happy with her.  She\n&gt;looked back at Quickstrike.  She wanted to comfort him but felt like it was\n&gt;not her place to interfere with his relationships.  She just lowered her\n&gt;head and worked on the console.\n&gt;\n&gt;She looked at Quickstrike and said in a low voice.\n&gt;&quot;Is everything alright commander? Is there anything I can do for you?&quot;\n&gt;She wanted to make him happy.  Blast her programming, not only did she have\n&gt;to obey, but she liked both of them.  She felt benieth both of her\n&gt;commanders and not worthy of either, but wanted to please both.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
