Her trainer \nprogram had almost finished it&#39;s attempt to deactivate the device \nthat kept Spears in stasis lock.  Her body jerked and twitched as the \ntrainer program finished with the device.  Her body lay perfectly \nstill on the table.  Then her eyes opened slowly.  She looked around \nand checked her surroundings.  She noticed that she was in a lab.  \nShe tried to move, but found that the straps held her down tight.  \nShe even had her head bound down.  She couldn&#39;t sence any other bots, \nor any transmissions from her master.  The device over the table \nblocked all transmissions.  She looked around again with her eyes and \nbreathed a deep sigh.  She didn&#39;t understand what was going on and \nshe couldn&#39;t understand why they left her alone in the ship, let \nalone alive.  Her trainer program told her to escape and get find a \nway back to Prebon.  She took a deep breath, and yelled at the top of \nher lungs, &quot; HHEEEELLLPPP!!!!&quot;\n\nShe stopped and listend..nothing.  the only thing she heard was her \nown echo in the lab and in the halls outside.  She yelled again,&quot; \nHHEEEELLLPPP!!!!&quot;  She listened again, hoping to hear the foot steps \nof someone coming for her. She hoped it might be a trainer.\n\n\n"}}
