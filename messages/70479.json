A good friend always knows what his com=\r\nrade is thinking, and no matter how saddened one is, he can always feel goo=\r\nd that he has friends standing beside him. It&#39;s very good to know I have yo=\r\nu and the others for support. I should consider myself very lucky to be a p=\r\nart of a powerful merger of factions. Now, Rodimus&#39;s health is declining, a=\r\nnd I have more than enough spark to share. I think it is time that you allo=\r\nw me to attempt a form of energy transfusion. It may be his only hope of re=\r\ncovery.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSilverbolt turned to face Tuscon a look of surprise crossi=\r\nng across\nhis expressive features as he nodded at Tuscon, &quot;Those of valor m=\r\nust\nact as one.&quot; he said. &quot;I heard the cracking of your knuckes and I know\n=\r\nwhy we are here, and I know whoes black energon pump is behind this.&quot;\nSilve=\r\nrbolt&#39;s optics darkened as he turned back to look at Rodimus\nthrough the gl=\r\nass as the alarm went off.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; He establishes a com link to Stanton a=\r\nnd Legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Stanton, Legacy, I am more than honored to have you working=\r\n so diligantly on saving Rodimus Prime, and now it is my turn to give somet=\r\nhing back in exchange for the undaunting dedication you are showing our fac=\r\ntions. My spark has more than enough power to transfuse energy from my body=\r\n into his. Not to worry, I will not go off line. It may be our only hope of=\r\n saving Rodimus Prime. It is not a request, it is my order.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSanton=\r\n looked up at Tuscon through the window, his optics at first\nannoyed to hav=\r\ne been pulled away from these delicate proceedures by\nTuscon.
