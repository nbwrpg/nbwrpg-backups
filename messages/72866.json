Running her optics to an ultraviolet mode if it was availabile, and\n&gt; seeing fi she could begin to run energy blockage traces, to hopefully track\n&gt; where teh jamming was heavier.\n&gt;\n&gt; And as the MAXIMALS and PREDACONS seemed to be readying to travel\n&gt; underground, she went over to try and scan the area to see where further\n&gt; signatures might be coming from.  Still not breaking her cloak, intent on\n&gt; staying aboveground.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSimply put, the closer they got to the cave, the heavier the jamming\ngot. It was as if it was a foci of some sort, perhaps one of the\nplaces, if not THE place from which the disruptive energies were\ncoming from.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT sat to the back as the MAXIMALS went to go down teh tunnel.  IF\n&gt; there was an ambush ahead, then they would take the brunt of it, and any\n&gt; hidden defenses would target and attrite them first.  While also giving the\n&gt; PREDACONS effective control of the tunnel up to the surface in case a quick\n&gt; escape was needed or other uses could be maintained for it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Speaking over to TORCA, &quot;I would assume a question of geology.  Their\n&gt; facility, if it is such, is probably underground quite simply as that is\n&gt; where the most stable ground is.  Aboveground things are too muddy for a\n&gt; solid base iwthout using heavy technology to establish it.  Which wold be\n&gt; more noticable to outside analysis.  So they have a stable base in the\n&gt; caverns.  It also may have to do something with their jamming technology as\n&gt; well.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Not saying the obvious &#39;it was a trap&#39;.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTORCA grunted as if he suspected that something more was at play here\nas well, however he continued to followed LEO PRIME into the cave\nopening.\n\nThe cave itself was quite large, at least once you passed through the\nmouth of it. It quickly began to descend its curving path leading\nfurther and further into the darkness that was below. The walls were\nlike any other cave, rough and natural, thee was no ambient light in\nhere, except for whatever light spilled in from the mouth of the cave\nor what the PREDACONS and MAXIMALS cared to utilize.\n\nSensors were getting more and more muffled as they passed into it.\nPassive ones still abosorbed, but active ones were basically of little\nto no use beyond a few feet espeacially ones that used radio or energy\nwaves that went outside the normal visual or auditory ranges.\n\nAhead of them they could hear something roar in the distance,\nsomething loud and reptillian - it was TUSCON! From the sound of it,\nhe was perhaps several hundred meters ahead of them deeper into the\ncave.\n\nHowever behind them, as the last of the PREDACONS were making their\nway in, a metallic &#39;door&#39; slid across the mouth of the cave blocking\nout any external light as well as any chance of egress.\n\nThe trap, at least this section of it, had been sprung!\n\nOOC: Adam the &#39;door&#39; will wait for all the preds and maxi&#39;s, but it is\nup to you if Blackarachnia was inside or outside when the door closed.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
