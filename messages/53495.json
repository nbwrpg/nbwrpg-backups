Only Teletran 1 could rebuild her \ncompletely. \n&gt; She doubted that anyone here would rebuild her the way SHE wanted \nto be. \n&gt; \n&gt; She noticed a wolf like bot awaiting & groaned as she slowed down & \npadded up \n&gt; to him. &quot;You must be the welcoming committee.&quot; her clear optics \ngazed at the \n&gt; wolf.\n\n\n"}}
