This should \nsum up an\n&gt; end to that battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; The shots hit Necromancer like a tap on the shoulder. Being the same \nsize as\n&gt; most of the gestaults had it&#39;s advantage. He stopped chaseing \nIgnatius and\n&gt; glared down at Zoe. &quot;Brave attempt for an enemy, I respect that.&quot; he \nshouts\n&gt; down. Raising a mighty claw shakeing  one pointed finger toward her \nhe\n&gt; smiles, &quot;You can go now, I&#39;ve had my fun.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The dragon turns away flying back toward the cave where the chase \nhad begun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignatius landed near Zoe gasping for breath. He&#39;d pushed himself to \nhis\n&gt; limits to avoid being lunch. &quot;Lets head to base, you can follow me.&quot; \nThe\n&gt; eagle again took flight heading north toward  the future sight of \nCairo\n&gt; where he&#39;d rest up until his strength returned.\n\n\n"}}
