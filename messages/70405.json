He could clearly see Cheetor and Ramulus working to pull\n&gt; everyone out of the deep pit, with Airhammer pulling guard duty. He\n&gt; had almost forgotten about that hole that Megatron had dug. They need\n&gt; to fill that thing in, not telling what else could come out of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; He glanced back at Kup, &quot;They&#39;re about out.&quot; Elder said, his voice\n&gt; excited by what was going on, but he still managed to keep his cool.\n&gt; &quot;Legacy is about to bring Rodimus in, we have Santon and Bump both\n&gt; there ready to assist Legacy in the repairs.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A viewscreen showed Legacy approaching the Ark, the shield parting\n&gt; slightly to allow him to enter.\n&gt; \n&gt; The screen also showed Santon and Bump standing on the dock. Santon\n&gt; was the larger, bulkier form. He was Grey with red on his thighs and\n&gt; arms. Large tusk like protrusions comming from the side of his head\n&gt; and heavy plating displaying clearly what his beast mode would be,\n&gt; that of an elephant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Standing just behind Santon was Bump, a smaller more compact Maximal,\n&gt; colored almost in reverse of Santon, red armored frame with grey along\n&gt; the thighs and bicepts. His beast mode was more difficult to discern,\n&gt; perhaps some sort of reptile.\n&gt; \n&gt; The camera view showed them both looking up at the approaching Legacy\n&gt; as he was carrying Rodimus&#39; form in his arms.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
