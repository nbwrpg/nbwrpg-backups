Once again taking\n&gt; aim at\n&gt; Cyclonus.  The four rockets, which are substantially larger than the\n&gt; ones\n&gt; inside the city, fly toward their target with great speed.\n\nOOC: Another quick question. Would the missiles be able to get a line\nof sight on Cyclonus at the moment? I do not know the lay out of the\ncity as well, but as far as I know Cyclonus has drop perhaps 50&#39; down\nthe side of a 100 foot drop to the water&#39;s edge. He should be fairly\nwell insulated from city view .. but then again I am not sure. \n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
