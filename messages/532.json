That was \nsomething new, but with the things coming out of pods these days...it didn&#39;t \nsurprise her much.\nShe looked over at the bike and slowly got to her feet again.       Iron \nRaptor walked over to it, sat down and started the ignition. It purred like \na litten. She smiled, these Maximals sure did know their hardware! Iron \nRaptor gestured for Plintissa to hop on, but she wasn&#39;t sure if there was \nenough room for Suukie. She looked back at him...*\n\n&quot; Can you...fly? Or are you grounded like me?&quot;\n\n* She knew that she couldn&#39;t dawdle for long, Liono had given the order to \nget back to base and that&#39;s just what she was planning to do...if Plintissa \nwould hurry up! *sarcastic**\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
