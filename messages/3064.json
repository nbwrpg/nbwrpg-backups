She snarled at Dinobot and lowered \nher head, exposing her dagger-like teeth. She wanted to bolt out of her, \ntake a few Maximals with her as he escaped. But she couldn&#39;t. She was \nsurrounded. A long time ago, when she was under Megatron&#39;s control, the \nmoment Dinobot returned, all hell broke loose. Dinobot had lunged at her, \nnearly clipping her on the back, but instead he had barely crashed into the \nCR chamber. All the Maximals where staring her down, ready to rip out her \nthroat if they desired. She had to haul tail and use her flight mode to get \nout the base.\n\nPrimus, that day was like the Inferno. And Megatron wasn&#39;t too happy about \nit either.\n\nBut here, she could confuse the slag out of the Maximals. She could still \nconvise them she was Dinobot.\n\n&quot;What has Megatron done?&quot; she said, snarling. She actually wasn&#39;t sure \nherself if this Dinobot was another clone.\n\n\n&gt;From: Carnage Dinobot &lt;carnage@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: 9 Jun 2000 14:51:47 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;( Carnage: I must make this reply short, I am called back to my \n&gt;grandmother&#39;s home once again.)\n&gt;\n&gt;* Dinobot looked over at Cyber Claw as he continued to hold the door open \n&gt;for Tavatron, not sure what to make of the situation.\n&gt;He had just come back from a hunt with Tavatron and come into this room \n&gt;where there was a bot who seemed almost like him, the same voice and the \n&gt;same smalls...almost.\n&gt;The scent of this stranger seemed so similar to his own but it also carried \n&gt;a bit of something else, something that set this stranger apart from being \n&gt;completely like himself. It was like a hormone that set the being off from \n&gt;him, the scent of it clearly distinguishing it from him...and he knew \n&gt;exactly what it was. This new bot, the one who almost seemed to be \n&gt;imitating him...was a female.\n&gt;Dinobot growled deeply in the back of his throat as he took a step towards \n&gt;the stranger and away from the door after looking towards Tavatron with \n&gt;puzzlement,but then noticing Striker come between the stranger and himself \n&gt;with a question that he was wondering at the same moment.\n&gt;He looked at Striker but then locked his optic on the new bot, even his \n&gt;laser guiding system ready to target the stranger if needed. His muscles \n&gt;were tense and his aggression was rising, he didn&#39;t like the fact that \n&gt;there was a female bot trying to seem like him.\n&gt;He snarled.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Yes, explain.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* He looked over to Cyber Claw with his optics narrowed and his tail \n&gt;thrashing, he would like to hear what she had to say for herself because he \n&gt;knew that once he exposed her feminine origins she would have no place for \n&gt;error. But for now he wanted to hear what this new bot had to say, wanted \n&gt;to see what sort of lie she would make up to almost make him seem like he \n&gt;wasn&#39;t who he really was.\n&gt;Dinobot crossed his arms but his tail continued to thrash,*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; This may prove most interesting.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;____________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt;address on the Net!\n&gt;http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt;Want to make new friends all over the world?
