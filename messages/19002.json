At the same time, he fired two fire balls\n&gt; forward at the Mafia base.\n\nPYro had missed as Stronghold was shot out of the way just in time. (See\nearlier post) This came before Stronghold decided to leave.\n\n&gt; Hiss ducked under the missile, the explosion almost toppling him over.  He\n&gt; returned fire with three fusion blasts at Stronghold.  &quot;WHY WON&#39;T YOU\nDIE?!&quot;\n\nStronghold seen the blasts coming this time and fired against them, making\nonly a few burn wounds worth of damage. Stronghold started leaving again,\ngrowling at the insolence of the Alliance.\n\n&gt; Scavenger fired off 25 explosive rounds at Rizopas.\n\nRizopas seen the rounds, knowing they had to be explosive, he rolled to the\nside, each one explosion misssing him by a few feet. He flips to his feet.\nRizopas got out his own charges, throwing 2 at Scavenger before running.\n\n&gt; &quot;I agree brother.  They do not know when to surrender or when to DIE.&quot;\nFlesh\n&gt; Ripper yelled out, firing three blasts from his rifle at Blender.\n\nStronghold knocks Blender out of the way, the rifle blasts going past where\nBlender was and hitting a tree. Stronghold grabbed Blender and angrily\nstomped away again.\n\n\n"}}
