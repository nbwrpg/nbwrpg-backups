He has seen the same\nthing over again the last few days.\nHe sees the classic fight, in the year 2005. He sees himself fighting\nGalvatron, inside Unicron. He grabs the Matrix from Galvatron, as it\nturns him in to Rodimus Prime. Optimus Prime&#39;s voice is heard. \n&quot;Arise Rodimus Prime.&quot; Rodimus runs at Galvatron, and throughs him\nthrough Unicrons hull. He opens the Matrix, the power begins to destroy\nUnicron. He and the Autobots escape.\nNow the dream is in slow motion.\nSeconds before Unicrons head blows off, what looks like a construction\ndroid is launched.\n\nHot Rod wakes. His organic parts are swetting, he is leeking oil.\nWhat does it all meen? Is Unicron rebuilt?\n\n"}}
