I&#39;ve heard \nof &#39;striking while \n&gt; the iron is hot&#39; or &#39;beat them while they&#39;re down&#39; but never &#39;beat \nthem while \n&gt; they&#39;re hot&#39;.  Because frankly that just doesn&#39;t make any sense.&quot;  \nHe takes a \n&gt; deep breath before beginning again.  &quot;Secondly, why exactly are you \nplanning \n&gt; the strategy.  HELLO, military strategist.  That is what they \nbrought me out \n&gt; of retirement for.  If you&#39;d like me to be doing something else \nthen by all \n&gt; means reassign me, but right now I&#39;ve got nothing to do except sit \nhere and \n&gt; stare at the tactical console.  Oh yeah, that reminds me we have \ncompany \n&gt; incoming at a high rate of speed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        The unknown bot finally stopped circling the mountain and \nflew in a \n&gt; straight line toward the nearest base, in this case the Tripred&#39;s.  \nHe stops \n&gt; just outside the defensive perimeter and lands.\n\n\n"}}
