She quickly \nregained her balance and continued to run down the hall as fast as her legs \ncould carry her.\nThe auto-guns weren�t helping much either, dodging them was harder then she \nhad first thought. But as she ran she managed to skitter out of the way of \nmost of the blasts, occasionally being hit in the back from a shot she just \ncouldn�t avoid.\nFocusing over the loud explosions of the roof defenses she heard the foot \nbeats of pursuing bots, three to be exact.\nBut she ran the line of a desperate bot; one that would do whatever it took \nto get away.\nIf the Maximals caught her now they would kill her, she was sure of that. \nEither that or imprison her without release, ever.\nBrightBlade cried out again as she suddenly felt her right knee buckle, \nsending her into a stumble, finally catching herself on the wall. She \ncouldn�t stop, not if she wanted to get away. And that was ALL she wanted.\nWeaponless, she couldn�t turn and defend herself. So, running for her life \nwas as good an idea as ever at this point.\nShe hauled herself to her feet, using the wall to help her.\nIt was Firearm�s shot that had got her, the other two sailing away further \ndown the hall.\nUsing the wall for support she continued down the hall, going as fast as she \ncould with her damaged knee.\nWith her hands cuffed she couldn�t do much, clinging to the wall as she \nran/stumbled down the hall.\nBut Firearm, Rex and Grimmler were in hot pursuit and she had slowed down a \nbit, making it easier for them to catch up to her.\nBut the thought of being caught caused her to let go of the wall, missing \nher steps for a few paces before picking up her pace.\nHe chest was bleeding like the Pit and her knee hurt just as bad, but she \ndidn�t care.\nShe wouldn�t let them catch her!\nBrightBlades head snapped up as she heard something, the auto-guns ahead of \nher had activated!\nHer breath was quickened with panic, her mind reeling to come up with some \nsort of idea to get away from this.\nFinally she came to the end of the hall to a T section, two other halls \nrunning off to her right and left.\nShe turned to the right without even thinking�and finally met her match!\nAn auto-gun that was being controlled from the bridge, right in front of \nher.\nBrightBlade didn�t even have enough time to gasp before she found herself \nhitting the far wall down the left section of the wall.\nHer body went straight against the wall as she hit, then curling into a ball \nas the pain came to her.\nA strangled wail erupted from her throat as she coiled around herself, a \npuddle of mech-fluid quickly forming around her.\nBut with more will-power then she thought she ever had she began to uncoil \nfrom her ball, slowly raising to her hands and knees. But she couldn�t get \nto her feet, raising her head and not believing what she saw.\nIt was some sort of shoot, like the ones that others used to deposit their \ndirty laundry.\nWith a groan she slowly crawled towards it, hoping that she could get there \nbefore the Maximals were upon her and had their guns pressed to her head. *\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
