Suukie grabs them both by the necks in his\nbig hand and slams them into a tree. Suukie looked very psychotic. Sinesis\nand Sinister knew a new trick, though. Sinesis and Sinister&#39;s weapons\ncombined and then split in half, making a half sword and half axe in each of\ntheir hands. Suukie choked them both until they couldn&#39;t breath. Suukie\nlaughed as they ran out of air. Lightmare stepped into the scene. Lightmare\ntransformed and fired into the back of Suukie, dropping him to his knees.\nBlades popped out of the forearms of Sinesis and Sinister and they combined\nwith their already devastating weapons. Theior weaponss complete, Sinesis\nand Sinister lunged at Suukie, stabbing their blades through him and pinning\nhim to a tree. Suukie stared straight ahead, seeing flashes of the future\nagain. Suukie&#39;s spark got weaker, and he lost gallons of mech fuid...\n\nPlintissa senses something was wrong and started to run. She ran from the\nMaximal base and ran over the hills toward the Pred base. She should have\nknown not to let Suukie do what he wanted and fight this battle alone, but\nhe threatened to kill her and she was already on the side of his choking\nbefore. Dracona yelled for Plintissa to wait but it was no use. Plintissa\narived and seen the grim Suukie. Sinesis and Sinister were nowhere in sight,\nbut Plintissa seen some of their mech fluid and their footprints, after\ntheir betrayal she knew they did this. Plintissa looked up onto a rock above\nand saw Lightmare looking down at her in her horse mode. Lightmare ran off\nas Plintissa fired at her. Plintissa helped Suukie to the ground, he wasn&#39;t\npinned to the tree anymore because Sinesis and Sinister took their weapons.\nPlintissa drug Suukie out and away from the Pred base and layed him in the\nfield.\n\n&quot;Suukie...Does not exist. I love you.&quot; Was all Suukie said. Plintissa had\nsome med packs from dracona&#39;s lab, but they were doing little good on a bot\nthis brutalized...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, June 15, 2000 9:58 AM\nSubject: Re: (unknown)\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m going to a river with a bunch of friends, and we&#39;re probably gonna\nbeat\n&gt; each other up for several hours, so I&#39;ll be unable to RP untill about 5pm\n&gt; Arizonan time.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Shredder::\n&gt;\n&gt; Shredder amerges from a hallway, gun aimed at the back of the bot that had\n&gt; just entered the base (Bazooka).
