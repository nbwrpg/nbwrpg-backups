Or at least her spark.\n&gt; By now she was feeling very tired and worn out, but there was no time to \n&gt; sleep when you&#39;re looking after over 20 Maximals.\n&gt; And though they could look after themselves, what sort of person would she \n&gt; be if she didn&#39;t at least look out for them?\n&gt; Though those thoughts slipped her mind when she heard someone land near her, \n&gt; then tuenrd to see that it was Prowl.\n&gt; A relieved smile crossed her lips at his greeting, leaning in against him at \n&gt; his hug and kiss.\n&gt; It was nice to have someone you could lean on, especially when you haven&#39;t \n&gt; recovered from the wounds of war.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; That would be a good idea.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
