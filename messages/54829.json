He connect the shoulder \nattachments together and forms a two handed bladed weapon. (Be aware, \nthis is similar to the Klingon Batlath)  He looked directly at Kaiser \nwith no fear in his optics. &quot;You are cunning. I admire that. let the \nopponent make the first mistake. Fine, I shall undertake your \nchallange.&quot;  He swished the wide blades around his body. He stopped, \nheld fast, then swung up and then down, bring the blade towards \nKaiser&#39;s shoulder. HE did not wish to disobey the words of Tyrael. He \nwould not kill Kaiser. One does not make ranks by killing thier \nsuperior officer. Well, not right away anyway.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kaiser::\n&gt;        He nods willingly and draws his two blades.  He holds his \ntwo curved \n&gt; scimitars in a crossed defensive stance in front of his face.  With \nthe free \n&gt; fingers of one hand he beckons for Deathsteel to make the first \nmove.  &quot;Come \n&gt; on Deathsteel, let&#39;s see how you handle yourself.  Have at me!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
