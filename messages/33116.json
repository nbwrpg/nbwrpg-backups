If you&#39;re running, send me an email saying that you&#39;re running, and\nname the two supporters you got.\n2. If you&#39;re supporting someone, send me an email saying who you&#39;re\nsupporting. Remember, if you&#39;re running, you can support one person,\nif you&#39;re not running, you can support two people.\n\nI will be accepting emails all through tomorrow. At that point, I will\nset up the poll at the site and the voting will begin. If you don&#39;t\nhave a username and password for the site, get one from me, or else\nyou won&#39;t be able to get into the polls.\n\n\n"}}
