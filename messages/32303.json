Iron Raptor,\nleader of the \n&gt; Maximals. The first glimpse of her he had ever seen. Her synthetic\nmuscles \n&gt; flexed as she barrled towrds them, holding something in her hand.\n&gt;        &quot;Continue the attack, I will deal with her.&quot; The giant turtle\nbot \n&gt; said. His green armor plating reflected the sun, and a small hum\nsignaled his \n&gt; dual shoulder missle launchers setteling on his broad shoulders.\n&gt;        Jade eyes watched her feverishly coming closer. It was clear\nnow that \n&gt; in her hand she held some kind of blade, poised to land in his body\nno doubt. \n&gt; He couldnt let the Fem get any closer than she already was. Hand to\nhand \n&gt; combat would be out of the question. It was time to act, and\nquickly.\n&gt;        Noting her leadership abilities, and the sheer fact that her\ngroup \n&gt; still endured while under constant attack made Marine question what\nhe could \n&gt; do. His internal processor assesed the probability of her next move.\nShe was \n&gt; to smart to come in, head on, even in her super mode. This was going\nto have \n&gt; to knock her off her feet.\n&gt;        Two black missles streaked out of the launchers with a trail\nof grey \n&gt; smoke tailing them. The projectiles quickly cut through the air and\nmet there \n&gt; target: the right and left side of Iron Raptor. The two side\nexplosions \n&gt; caused a bright rose of flame and sent debris scattering. \n&gt;        Marine quickly scanned the destroyed area. His jade eyes\npulsed with \n&gt; an optic blast ready to take her down agian if needed. He knew that\nhis move \n&gt; wasnt a checkmate, only to knock her down. Now the hard part came\nin.\n\n\n"}}
