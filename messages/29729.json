A 44 foot robot soon \nstands where they used to stand, looking down at the battlefield. The \nrobot had Supernova&#39;s intelligence, Flare&#39;s explosive weapons and \ntemper, Scrap&#39;s repair system, Vycir&#39;s cloaking capabilities (although \nthey wern&#39;t very good considering the size of the bot), and Slasys&#39;s \nweapon knowledge.\n\n&quot;Hey Perndabot,&quot; he says in a deep voice to the robot fighting below, \naccessing what had been programmed into the Galactors by Zardus to get \nthe bot&#39;s name, &quot;If you don&#39;t slag him, I get to try next.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Sorry Zardus.
