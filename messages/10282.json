Plintissa wasn&#39;t mo=\r\nving. Dracona smiled and walked back toward her base. A dagger flew into Dr=\r\nacona&#39;s back. She spun around and grabbed the dagger in pain. Plintissa sto=\r\nod there.\n\n        &quot;You do not know when to give up, you fool, but never mi=\r\nnd that your an idiot, I&#39;m going to grind you so small you won&#39;t be able to=\r\n be seen with a microscope!&quot; Dracona said. She kept her hand covered and fl=\r\nung the dagger back. It missed Plintissa and hit Artist in the leg. Dracona=\r\n smiled in satisfaction. Plintissa tackled Dacona and took her down. Dracon=\r\na once again turned to her saw blade to saw into Plintissa. Dracona fired a=\r\nn ice beam, but Plintissa dodged. Dracona started to burn everything with f=\r\nire beams. Plintissa still avoids it. Plintissa was always a good fighter, =\r\nbut it wasn&#39;t until now, after her bad life that she discovered her true fi=\r\nghting power. Plintissa beat Dracona mercilessly. Draocona&#39;s parts were flu=\r\nng everywhere as Plintissa spun a simple stick through the air. Dracona rai=\r\nsed the saw blade and sliced the stick to pieces. Dracona laughed and slice=\r\nd Plintissa several hundred times. Plintissa fell.\n\n        &quot;Th weak move a=\r\nside and die so the strong can survive. As ancient as the Cosmos, that has =\r\nalways been the way of things. I&#39;m sorry Plintissa, you were a good friend,=\r\n but don&#39;t take this personally, it&#39;s just business.&quot; Dracona said.\n       =\r\n  \n        Dracona pulled back the saw blade and thrust it towards Plintiss=\r\na. Plintissa grabbed her arm from earlier and threw it. It hit Dracona&#39;s bl=\r\nade. Dracona slammed it into Plintissa, but as she did, the blade came loos=\r\ne before it hit Plintissa. The blade flew up. Dracona blinked her eye, the =\r\none Dinobot had scarred when she first arived on the planet. The blade sawe=\r\nd through Dracona and left her in pieces everywhere. Her spark extinguished=\r\n. Her last words were:\n\n        &quot;*Cough, Cough* Zardus I am sorry. Plintiss=\r\na, do not forget your promise.&quot; And Dracona died smiling. Plintissa remembe=\r\nred that she promised Dracona that she would never leave her sitting. Plint=\r\nissa cried. Her mech fluid ran everywhere and she got weaker and weaker. Ar=\r\ntist stepped slowly over to Plintissa. He was crying, too.\n\n        &quot;Artist=\r\n, I&#39;m sorry it had to end this way.&quot; Plintissa whispered.\n\n        &quot;Why are=\r\n you leaving me, Plintissa? Why does everyone betray me?&quot; Artist asked.\n\n  =\r\n      &quot;Artist, there floats Dracona&#39;s spark, recover it, we can&#39;t part, she=\r\n really was my friend.&quot; Artist walked up and captured the extinguished spar=\r\nk as it tried to fly away. He contained it in a capsule.\n\n        &quot;Plintiss=\r\na, if you leave me, I&#39;ll...have no more reason to live, all my friends are =\r\ngone, my helping days are over.&quot; Artist said.\n\n        &quot;Your helping days a=\r\nre never over, and we&#39;ll always be together.&quot; Plintissa said.\n\n        &quot;Thi=\r\ns isn&#39;t some lame thing about how you&#39;ll always be in my heart, is it?&quot;\n\n  =\r\n      &quot;No, Artist, come here.&quot; Plintissa whispered. Artist looked at Team U=\r\nltima&#39;s base. It was destroyed, the funny thing was, that it was destroyed =\r\nby Dracona, the very one, along with Plintissa, that originally built it. A=\r\nnd there it was, sticking above ground now and burning away. Sinesis looks =\r\nat the base and sighs.\n\n        &quot;Twister, Dracona is dead, I guess we have =\r\nto leave.&quot; Sinesis says. Sinister stands next to Blizzard and sighs.\n\n     =\r\n   &quot;Blizzard, we need to find another home, now.&quot; Sinister said sadly.\n\n   =\r\n     Artist came closer to Plintissa. Her spark suddenly burst from her and=\r\n floated into Artist&#39;s hands. She said to him what he needed to do. He open=\r\ned his chest compartment and his spark was revealed. Artist combined Plinti=\r\nssa&#39;s spark with his own, they became one.\n\n        &quot;Till all are one.&quot; Art=\r\nist whispered really low. Plintissa told him she still loved him. Artist wa=\r\ns overjoyed! Plintissa was with him now, and now they could never be sepera=\r\nted again. Artist, completely ignoring Blizzard and Sinister, and Sinesis a=\r\nnd Twister. ran out into a field.\n\n        &quot;Artist, now we need to take car=\r\ne of Dracona&#39;s spark.&quot; Plintissa said. (Remember, only Artist can hear Plin=\r\ntissa now) Artist headed toward the Maximal base, there Dracona would get a=\r\n new body, one she could not attack anyone ever again in, and where she can=\r\n always be helpful. Artist held up the contained, Dracona&#39;s spark still ins=\r\nide.\n\n        &quot;I love you.&quot; Artist said seemingly to nobody.\n\n        &quot;I lo=\r\nve you too.&quot; Plintissa said to Artist. Artist continued walking to the Maxi=\r\nmal base...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_043A_01BFFEA1.2A4C5AA0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2919.6307&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Okay.&quot; Sinister sai=\r\nd lamely.

She spun around and grabbed the dagger in pain. \n        Plin=\r\ntissa stood there.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT size=3D2&gt;&quot;You do not know when to give up, you fool, but never \n        m=\r\nind that your an idiot, I&#39;m going to grind you so small you won&#39;t be \n     =\r\n   able to be seen with a microscope!&quot; Dracona said. She kept her hand \n   =\r\n     covered and flung the dagger back. It missed Plintissa and hit Artist =\r\nin \n        the leg. Dracona smiled in satisfaction. Plintissa tackled Daco=\r\nna and \n        took her down. Dracona once again turned to her saw blade t=\r\no saw into \n        Plintissa. Dracona fired an ice beam, but Plintissa dod=\r\nged. Dracona \n        started to burn everything with fire beams. Plintissa=\r\n still avoids it. \n        Plintissa was always a good fighter, but it wasn=\r\n&#39;t until now, after her \n        bad life that she discovered her true figh=\r\nting power. Plintissa beat \n        Dracona mercilessly. Draocona&#39;s parts w=\r\nere flung everywhere as Plintissa \n        spun a simple stick through the =\r\nair. Dracona raised the saw blade and \n        sliced the stick to pieces. =\r\nDracona laughed and sliced Plintissa several \n        hundred times.

Dracona slammed it into Plintissa, but as she \n        did, =\r\nthe blade came loose before it hit Plintissa. The blade flew up. \n        D=\r\nracona blinked her eye, the one Dinobot had scarred when she first \n       =\r\n arived on the planet. The blade sawed through Dracona and left her in \n   =\r\n     pieces everywhere. Her spark extinguished.

Her spark suddenly \n        burst from her and floated into Arti=\r\nst&#39;s hands. She said to him what he \n        needed to do. He opened his ch=\r\nest compartment and his spark was \n        revealed.
