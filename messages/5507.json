He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grumbled as he saw it zip away.

He cursed in\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacon language. He was so hungry. He watched after a few moments as\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fish returned. He leaned his body closer over the edge of the boulder,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; targeting percisely. He plunged his tail down into the water. He felt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something in between the jaws of his tail. He pulled his tail up and\n&gt; &gt;found\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out that he had a catch.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He laughed and snapped his claws in victory. &quot;Ah got one!&quot; he called\n&gt; &gt;out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ah got one!&quot; He turned his body to the side and threw the fish from\nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tail, to the shore. It was already limp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He looked back down into the waters. He targeted his tail, and tried\n&gt; &gt;again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One wasn&#39;t going to enough for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Conference Calling with Firetalk!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Click Here!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5480/13/_/_/_/962496375/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; 0% Introductory APR!\n&gt; Instant Approval!\n&gt; Aria Visa - get yours today.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6035/13/_/_/_/962506343/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
