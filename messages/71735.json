And even\n&gt; in his compromised state, he still carries an air of his famous temperament,\n&gt; as he narrows his eyes with a low growl in his voice.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON got on board the ship BUMP and SANTON were there to greet\nhim as he landed. They carefully took SILVERBOLT from him and laid him\non a suspensor bed and moved him to the side.\n\nBUMP hooked a energon feed tube to TUSCON so that he could regain his\nenergon as quickly as possible while SANTON began to look over\nSILVERBOLT. He shook his head. &quot;He is still alive, but we but we need\nto get him back to the ark.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; About Rodimus...  If he chose to turn on our faction, then so be it.\n&gt; Instead of taking the initiative to fend off the temptation, he has opted\n&gt; for an easy way out instead.  I did what I could to save him!  I can not do\n&gt; any more than that! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He snaps his tail in annoyance.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; He has no sense of responsibility, self confidence, or the ineptitude to\n&gt; overcome a major adversity!  Of course he is vulnerable to possession!  HE\n&gt; WANTS IT THAT WAY, IT&#39;S THE EASIEST WAY AROUND A DIFFICULT SITUATION!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He slaps a heavy front paw down on the shuttle floor.  Now exhausted, he\n&gt; tries to catch his breath. Yet he looks to Leo Prime as he fights to keep\n&gt; his head and long neck up off the shuttle floor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Leo Prime, the best thing to do is to relinquish his Prime status and\n&gt; revert him back to Hot Rod, where he can do no harm.  From now on, until I\n&gt; am restored, I ask that you assume all leadership duties while I recover.\n&gt; Promise me you will - do as I request?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He can no longer hold up his head and lays it back on the floor.  Yet he\n&gt; looks to Stanton while conversing with Leo Prime.  It was clear to him that\n&gt; Rodimus was quite comfortable where he was and that now it was time to do\n&gt; something about him.  The silver dragon hardens to the idea of having to\n&gt; fight against a friend who now proves to be his greatest foe.  A look of\n&gt; sheer determination covers his face as he remains grounded for the time\n&gt; being.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot; LEO PRIME said calmly over the comlink. Almost as if LEO\nPRIME could hear his thoughts he said, &quot;We all have weaknesses and\nfoilbles and things that cause us to do things that we would not\nordinarilly want or desire to do.&quot; There was a thoughtful pause from\nLEO PRIME, &quot;But sometimes our greatest foe is not the enemy without,\nbut we ourselves.&quot;\n\nLEO paused again and then said, &quot;Rest. I think we all need to discuss\nthis with calmer heads. I will see you when you get back to the Ark.&quot;\n\nEven as TUSCON was getting that rest the shuttle was turned back to\nthe Ark, SILVERBOLT was a priority. The other FUZORS and TALON would\nhave to make it for a little while longer.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
