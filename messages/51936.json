She had gathered \nthe emergency food/energon rathions, a few small back up lights that \nwere battery opperated, she even took out the lazy boy co-pilot \nchair and stuck the base into the ground. Deciding to stay night, \nshe made a small circle of stones and built a campfire. She sat back \nin her lazy boy chair with her pistol still at her side.  Being in \nunkwon territory still made her feel uneasy.  BUt she had figurerd \nthat since no bot had come for her by now, probably no bot would.  \nShe pulled out a small energon cube fron her lunch pack and munched \non it contently. She saw a small bird land on a nearby trtee \nbranch. &quot;So what&#39;s this place called? What&#39;s the rest of the wild \nlife like? Oh, and let me guess, you want to see my transport papers \nright?&quot; she laughed and chuckled. &quot;Ahh, first real sign of life, and \nit can&#39;t even tell me where to find a fast food joint in these \nparts.&quot;  She was finally starting to feel relaxed about this place.  \nFeeling somewhat restless though, she got up and placed a few empty \ncontainers on a log and started to work on target practice. She hit \nmost of them, but she was no great marksbot.  She sighed and kept \npracticing.  She hit them all down and stood them back up to shoot \nagain.  While shooting, her small pocket scanner started showing a \nblib heading in her direction.  But she didn&#39;t hear it over the \npistol fire. &quot;DANG! I Knew I should have gone to those target \nclasses back in school!&quot;  She kept up her taret practice, unaware of \nher scanner. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Bored again, Jackie wanders aimlessly about the base, with his \n&gt; internal music player blaring Bob Seger.  (One has to wonder how \nthe \n&gt; rest of the Maximals like hearing this stuff rattling \ndeckplates.)  \n&gt; Slipping into the control room, he notices that one of the \nscanners \n&gt; is picking up a homing signal.  Scratching his head, he pulls out \na \n&gt; datapad and types out a quick note:  &quot;Gone to check out signal - \nBack \n&gt; soon.  Jackie.&quot;  Switching off the player, he dashes out, \ntransforms \n&gt; to vehicle mode, and races toward the source of the broadcast.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
