His \nadded weight added more pressure on her broken ribs, but she didn�t mind. \nTavatron clenched her teeth and waited for him to regain his balance. She \nslowly searched the ark for any available �R chambers, when much to her \nsurprise Dinobot loosened his grip on her shoulders until he was no longer \nusing her for support.\n\nTavatron grimaced as Dinobot transformed. The sound of grinding gears and \nsparks sending shivers down her spine. However, once he was fully \ntransformed he appeared to be alright, or at least in less pain. Tavatron \nsighed softly, bringing up a flickering image of her system�s status with \nher internal computer. Her optic lasers were non-existent and the majority \nof her right ribcage was either broken, cracked, or fractured. Her internal \nsystems were fried, causing her optics to occasionally spark, not to mention \na seriously fractured left wrist. Tavatron shut her optics, small sparks \nerupting from her eyes. she hadn�t realized she had sustained this much \ndamage:\n\n&quot;Perhaps you are correct.&quot;\n\nTavatron opened her optics, expecting to see Dinobot heading for an �R \nchamber when much to her dismay she saw him drop in front of an open air \nvent. She hung her head and groaned softly. She didn�t know whether to kill \nhim or feel sorry for him. On the one hand she had practicly dragged him to \nthe base, ignoring her own injuries, just so he could get repaired. On the \nother hand she wasn�t very fond of CR chambers and suspected that neither \nwas he. She crouched down beside him, she wanted to help, but didn�t know \nhow. She wasn�t a medic �bot, she was a warrior. If anything she was more \nskilled at taking a life than saving it! Still, she had to do something:\n\n&quot;Beast mode.&quot;\n\nTavatron barely whispered the command, not wanting to disturb the sleeping \nDinobot. She turned, about to head to her own quarters, then stopped \nmid-step. She looked back at him, watching a few moments as he shivered from \nsome inner-cold. Tavatron snarled softly in frustration. She wanted to rest. \nShe was exhausted, mentally and physically. Still... for some odd reason she \njust couldn�t leave. He needed warmth.  Tavatron walked over to him and \nplaced a gentle paw on his shoulder. She could feel his body shiver beneath \nher padded paw. Silently she stepped closer, a little hesitant.\n\n*Oh slag it!* She thought as she laid against him. She rested her head and \nforepaws across his back in an attempt to warm him. She knew he hated being \ntouched, and if he were awake he would probably snap at her tell her to get \nthe slag off of him, but she didn�t care. Like it or not she wasn�t moving. \nTavatron closed her optics and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep. The warm \nair from the vent gently ruffling her fur as she slept.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
