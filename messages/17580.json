But this gave him \nthe opportunity. He knew Inferno was in the exactly the right spot to \ngive him the shock of his life. Starscream used all his force to move \nupward. Slowly and horitantly, as to not shake any things off his \nbody. As they got to a tremendous height, Starscream blew out all his \nexhaust and grime that were in his jets into Inferno&#39;s face, hoping \nto knock him off and to send him plummiting to the earth.\n\n\n"}}
