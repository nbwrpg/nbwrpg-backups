Vladimir Ward is a Khan. He is my\nKhan. Keeping a Clan leader imprisoned is a waste of important command\nresources. As for the poor strategy, we know that the Preds are weak\nfrom the last great battle and that some of them are out of the base.\nIf we bring support weapon, we could take out point defenses and force\nour way in. My original idea was to challenge them, but Kup thought it\nwould be unwise.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;&quot;\n&lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Empath::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Some plan,&quot; the femme snorts, her combative Predacon nature getting \n&gt; the better of her.  &quot;We risk a half-dozen or so units to save one?  \n&gt; That would seem to fall under the category of wasteful actions, \n&gt; Katya - not to mention poor strategy.&quot;  Empath is deliberately \n&gt; baiting the Clan warrior by using her own principles against her.  \n&gt; She has no doubt Katya will come up with a counter-argument.
