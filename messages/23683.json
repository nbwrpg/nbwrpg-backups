One shot glazes his shoulder, doing minimal damage.\n\nTwo missile launchers flip out of his shoulders, sending two missiles \nat Tankor. He jumps on an elevated rock, hoping Tankorr would blast \nit down. If only EndBringer could get in close...\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCloaked, Scyther calmly watches the battle. He was invisible, \nundetectable, and therefore, safe. He unsheathes his scythe, ready to \nkill someone.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise blocks a missile from Rampage with his claws, easily taking \nthe explosion. The beast charges the smaller bot, ignoring more \nexplosions.\n\nLike EndBringer, Demise was deadly at close range.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Tankkor plows over the snow drift and comes down hard, and \nthe bots on \n&gt; top of him go into the battle plan, taking a target and proceeding \nafter it. \n&gt; Tankkor, as he was promised, got the first shots. He targets \nEndbringer, and \n&gt; releases a few shots from his powerful tank turrets while the other \n&gt; Predacons, Rampage included, unlease thier well stocked ammo.\n\n\n"}}
