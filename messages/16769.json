He doesn&#39;t know anything about you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Blaze had put in Striker&#39;s new personality, and she had repaired \nmost \n&gt; of his damaged systems. But the head....he had completly destroyed \n&gt; his own head. It was amazing that this bot had survived. It was \n&gt; almost like the chip was a fate worse than death. It didn&#39;t matter. \n&gt; He would be serving Prebon soon enough, as his top mercenairy. She \n&gt; even installed a new name for Striker to go by. As far The Trainers \n&gt; were concerned, Striker was dead. Only his shell remains. His sprak \n&gt; had been completly re-formatted. But back to topic, the head needed \n&gt; to be replaced. She carefully disconected it from his body, and \n&gt; through it aside. Now how was she supposed to make a new head? \nWait! \n&gt; She had it! She picked up Striker&#39;s old head, and popped the face \n&gt; plate off. It had been virtually undamaged, except for a few blac \n&gt; spots. Now she needed a new main part. She went to the cargo area \n&gt; where the boys were building their new toy.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yo, do you guys need the head of the bot you killed?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No, here. Take it!&quot; Hammer through her K9&#39;s head. She went back to \n&gt; the bridge and popped the face plate off, and attached Striker&#39;s \n&gt; plate. Now all it needed was some minor repairs. She got to work on \n&gt; that, thinking how this bot was going to act when he was finished.\n\n\n"}}
