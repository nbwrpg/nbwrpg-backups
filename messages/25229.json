She may not like it, but she had \na 10 7-year-olds view of the world. Everything seemed too new and eager to \nbe explored. Mind so full of ideas that the imagination never ceased to \namaze!\nBut even though others might enjoy her antics, Carnage wasn�t blind enough \nnot to see that Teltoli really would rather be thought of as an adult.\nBut there was something she had to get straight, life wasn&#39;t a game and she \nhad to buckle down and beat her brains out before she could take in what was \nneeded to be like that. Carnage knew that for a fact. BUT.....she had \nlearned the easy way and grew up like that, Teltoli was lucky and had grown \nup in a wealthy home.\nCarnage sighed. There was a time she despised the wealthy and hated their \nguts, and would have never guessed that she would ever call one friend.\nShe sighed again...lucky twit! What she�d give to have grown up never having \nto worry about where you next meal was coming from.\nCarnage smiled at the description Teltoli was giving of her mother.**\n&quot; Yeah. I bet if I knew who my mom was, she might have been the same \nway...or close to it.&quot;\n** But then she listened to the words her father had spoken, reminding her \nslightly of her own horrid past.\nWhere blood had been something she had to grow fond of, even though it \nwasn&#39;t spilled by her own hands.\nCarnage didn&#39;t like thinking about it, it was even worse then Dinobot&#39;s \ndeath. At least he had died in one piece!\nShe shivered for a moment, not sure if it was from the cold rain or the \nthoughts in her mind.\nShe had been very young when it all happened but she could remember almost \neverything. And it hadn&#39;t come back to her until now. Though she wished it \nwouldn&#39;t have.\nCarnage had had a hard life, ever after her home had been destroyed and her \nfather mutilated right in front of her eyes. But he never screamed. That was \none things she remembered. He was brave to the end.\nCarnage shook her head, relieving herself of the images, barely even hearing \nTeltoli finally talk about food.\nHer voice was flat as if she was zoned out.** &quot; Here there&#39;s no special \nadditives, it&#39;s bound to taste different.&quot;\n** Carnage shook her head again and looked at Teltoli.** &quot; Can I ask you \nsomething...personal?&quot; ** she cleared her throat.** &quot; What it like to be \nloved? By family, I mean.&quot; ** she waited calmly, and she was really curious. \nShe had never had a family to love her so she would like to know. Honest \nquestion. **\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
