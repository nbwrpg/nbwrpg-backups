DarkMouse got up and left the mess \nhall.  She went up to the bridge and started checking the scanners and \nsecurity systems.\nKitKat2 looked at Drillbit. &quot;How I got here? I walked here from the CR tank. \nDarkMouse fixed me up and now I&#39;m here with you. Why do you looked shocked? \nI mean, why wouldn&#39;t I be here?&quot; Then she remembered why DarkMouse had told \nher. &quot;Oh, that, well, according to DarkMouse, I was hurt badly from the \nsnake bite.  She said I was reborn and now I&#39;m back. Why, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;\n\nGoldenEye::\nShe smirked at Dollen&#39;s responce. &quot;Yeah, have a nice nap there pal. I&#39;ll be \nout hunting if you need me.&quot;\n\nShe turned and went to the armory.  She found a nice electron staff and \nstarted to practice her moves.\n\n\n\n----original message---------\n&gt;::DrillBit::\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Are you kidding? I always have time for you.&quot;\n&gt;He walked to the mess hall, and found their table. He sat down.\n&gt;He was remembering the night their relationship started. They had been\n&gt;in the mess hall at the old cave. They both got drunk, and spent the\n&gt;night making out. Hmmm, that wasn&#39;t very romantic.\n&gt;He placed a hand on hers.\n&gt;&quot;Hello, love. I&#39;m sure you would like to be caught up, and I could use\n&gt;an explination of how you are here. Its a marical!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;::Dollon::\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Ok. I&#39;m going to get some shut eye.&quot;\n&gt;He heads to his room, and sleeps.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
