A mirage of \nimages danced across the inside of her optics. They were shrouded in a gray \nfog of mystery and harsh reality. Maximals, Predacons, a valley not unlike \nthe one she and Dinobot had practiced in, all fleeting dreams of a past that \nwas not her own. Tavatron groaned and whimpered... a fire.\n\nTavatron stared through optics that were not her own at a world she had \nnever known. Suddenly a blackening fog engulfed the images and they were no \nmore. Tavatron cried out silently in her sleep as reality hit her like a ton \nof bricks.\n\nDinobot, the resent battle with the Predacons, slowly the images faded from \nher mind as they were replaced with those of the present. She shut her \noptics tightly, concern and worry etched on her sleeping face. She silently \ncried, the tears flowing freely inside. She was too tired to return to beast \nmode, and unable to cry in robot mode. The sorrow and concern engulfed her, \nshaking her to the very core of her spark.\n\nThoughts of her lost friend filled her mind, then those of Dinobot&#39;s near \ndeath. A slow realization dawned on her. She was afraid. Afraid to be alone. \nDinobot had replaced the void her friend&#39;s death had created all those \nstellercycles ago. She didn&#39;t want to lose him, not now. Tavatron fell limp \nagainst the side of the &#39;R chamber, her arms wrapped about her knees in a \ndesperate atempt to hold on to reality.\n\nSuddenly a sense of calm filled her, something she had never felt before. \nTavatron relaxed as she fell into a deep, somewhat peaceful slumber.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
