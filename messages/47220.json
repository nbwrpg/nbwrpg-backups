Sensing the general emotion of a spark \nspontaeneously was something, but doing it on purpose was another one. \nIt was not impossible, but still difficult.\n\nAzureBlade: I sense you are... curious. You seem to seek a knowledge \nabout us, as you stated. You feel defiant in a way. Of course, because \nof this, there was no way you were just going to let us go without at \nleast showing yourself. You do not fear us, yet, I sense something \nclose to respect... Am I right?\n\nOOC: I did the best I could!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Kali::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Are you twin of that... devil????&quot; said Kali &quot;If I hadn&#39;t had a \n&gt; psichopath as sister I wouldn&#39;t belive you... but you aren&#39;t \n&gt; interested in my troublemaker family... so Maximals kind-heart move \n&gt; them act as they act???
