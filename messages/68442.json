Enough was said\n&gt; for these two brothers in arms. They both jumped out of the shuttle\n&gt; only to combine and transformed into a compact but heavily equiped\n&gt; transport chopper. Rapdly they rise up in the sky to be cover by the\n&gt; cloud scanning for pursuier while keeping a safe distance from the\n&gt; shutte.\n\nNightrazor watched as the chopper exited the shuttle and for a moment\nhe almost thought he had been discovered. But when he saw the Chopper\nassume a watching posture he relaxed and continued to mirror the\nmovements of the shuttle maintained his shielding.
