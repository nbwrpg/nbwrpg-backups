Drillbit, Atma and \nStarscream all want KitKat. All out war in Pred ranks.)\n\nStarscream, still carrying Phobia, went around the debris. The heat \nwas getting intense, the flames getting larger and the ship nearing a \ncrash that would kill any onboard.\n\nComputer:&quot;Heat Overload Iminant. Reverting to stasis lock..\n\n&quot;Delay that! Put all weapons power towards Heat Tolerence.\n\nComputer:&quot;Transfering.......Crisis averted.&quot;\n\nFinaly Starscream made it to the escape hatch. He put Phobia down and \nwent to Jet Mode. He than asked forgiveness.\n\n&quot;Sorry to scare you for this, Phobia, but it&#39;s the only way.&quot;\n\nStarscream than nudged Phobia out of the ship and sent her falling he \nimmediatly dove after him, got under, opened the cockpit and let him \nfall in. He closed it.\n\n&quot;There we are. All safe and sound.&quot;\n\nStarscream didn&#39;t know how wrong he was. Just as the was about to go \nand join the others, The ship hit the ground, causing what was eft of \nthe cargo and fuel to explode in a vicious fury. Starscream, with \nPhobia inside him, was still very close to the blast. Most of his \narmor was incinerated, and he was thrown against a stone wall into \nstasis lock. Before he went it was his only hope that the cockpit had \nprotected Phobia enough to give a help signal, or the Preds would \nthink they died in the blast.\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron headed back to the base on Zardus&#39; orders.\n\n\n"}}
