Lightmare smiled as innocent as\npossible and offered pears to Gangon and BrightBlade, smiling a bit\nirregular at BrightBlade.\n\n&quot;Well, thank you, Lightmare. See BrightBlade?

Hell Beast is our Lord, what he says goes...you\nknow\n&gt; that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then winked at him just because, but mainly for the reason that he\nhad\n&gt; actually called her &quot;baby&quot;. It was a new word to her since Gangon just\n&gt; usually called her beautiful or something like that, compliments could go\na\n&gt; long way if she was in a good mood.\n&gt; But she also knew that if she didn&#39;t watch her back then she wouldn&#39;t have\n&gt; any future at all, if Lightmare had her way anyway.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Old school buds here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4057/10/_/_/_/960300532/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
