Why would someone rush headlong into an enemy base,\nknowing that they would quickly bring to bear all the security measures\nthat had on the intruder.\n\nPressing button on the control panel beside the room door he checked\nthe condition of the room. The result was of course a single occupant,\nand that the room was totally shielded and powered down. So the room\nthat could be an arena for battle was now doubling for a temporary\ncell. \n\n&quot;Perceptor&quot; Myrmidon called over the short range intrabase\ncommunications, &quot;Report to my location, I believe I have our intruder\npinned.&quot;\n\nAs Myrmidon waited went back to staring at the door as he crossed his\narms over his massive chest, his optics narrowing. &quot;DECEPTICON!!&quot; He\ncalled through the door to malice, &quot;You were a fool to enter this base.\nWhat are you looking for?&quot;\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n--- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hearing and detecting the security measures being implaced to keep\n&gt; him in the room, he could safely change forms.  Now in classic form,\n&gt; he lie in wait behind a stack of crates.  He drew his swords and\n&gt; smirked.  Now he just had to find Rodimus.

Weather he was talking about the intruder\n&gt; or\n&gt; the defenders at the door it is difficult to tell. \n&gt; \n&gt; With a thought Myrmidon shifted form assuming his avian mode and\n&gt; followed. While he was smaller, about the size of a large eagle, he\n&gt; was\n&gt; outfitted with boosters amd missile launchers. He fired the former as\n&gt; he pursued Malice into the base as he primed the latter, ready for\n&gt; what\n&gt; would come next. \n&gt; \n&gt; As Malice wound his way deeper into the base, Mymidon followed, his\n&gt; sensors taking in the residual heat signature and exaust output. Even\n&gt; for one without sensors Malice wasn&#39;t difficult to follow - the\n&gt; sounds\n&gt; of internal defences attempting to capture or kill him was a finger\n&gt; pointing directly at him. \n&gt; \n&gt; Arriving at the door just after Malice entered his hidey hole of a\n&gt; room, Myrmidon smiled. &quot;Good, you have trapped yourself. There are no\n&gt; other doors here.&quot; He nodded as he heard the bulkheads dropping down\n&gt; in\n&gt; different part of the base. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Computer!&quot; Myrmidon crossed his arms over his chest. &quot;Erect a\n&gt; maximum\n&gt; strength forceshield around ante cabin 447 and deactivate power.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ((OOC: Airly, you will have to let me know if that works.))\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Myrmidon)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- xochitla2006 &lt;xochitla2006@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfortress/ Perceptor:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The black fortress alarms started to rang and warn about the \n&gt; &gt; intruder.
