He growls \nas his mind proccesses Biomass&#39;s last comment. The large bot levels \nhis missile launcher at Biomass&#39;s head, which was heading toward the \nIF, attached to his body ... for now...\n\n&quot;Freeze, turn around, drop your weapons, and put your hands in the \nair,&quot; Perndabot says loudly enough for Biomass to hear, trying very \nhard to control his temper and not just attack this bot head on. \nBiomass had a very large missile launcher aimed at the back of his \nhead, which was armed with two very dangerous missiles, which could \nbe launched by a finger twitch of a very pissed off bot. Perndabot&#39;s \nfinger tightened over the trigger.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Biomass was surprised that Perndabot hadn&#39;t made any move towards \nhim by \n&gt; now, perhaps there was a thought or something in his programming \nthat was \n&gt; holding him back. But it was his job to push buttons until he got \nthe \n&gt; reaction he was looking for, and to see where Perndabot snapped was \njust \n&gt; that sort of reaction.\n&gt; He glanced down towards Nue&#39;e when Perndabot reacted to her, \nlifting a brow, \n&gt; realizing what she&#39;d said before just now and giving Swift a side \nlong \n&gt; clance.\n&gt; Nue&#39;e let go of Perndabot&#39;s finger after he had reacted to her, \ngiving \n&gt; Biomass that look again and getting a look back that told her not \nto worry. \n&gt; She only sighed.\n&gt; &lt; Must be the new body.&gt;\n&gt; Biomass, narrowed his optics when he heard Perndabot&#39;s comeback, \nnot feeling \n&gt; insulted but knowing that he wasn;t going to leave what he said \nwithout a \n&gt; responce. However, he could use the need to get to the Iron Fist as \nan \n&gt; excuse to push this man just a little further before he placed him \nunder his \n&gt; concern and ignored him.\n&gt; Biomass&#39;s expression turned aggressive.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You have a striking point there. So, I&#39;ll leave you women to your \n&gt; ammuseMENTS!&quot; on the last word Biomass  struck to check his \nshoulder-plate \n&gt; hard against Perndabot&#39;s arm as he passed by, the force enough to \nknock even \n&gt; a bot Perndabot&#39;s size to the ground.\n&gt; Biomass, on the other hand, continued walking towards the Iron \nFist, leaving \n&gt; Nue&#39;e to stand by Perndabot and stare at him in complete \ndisbeliefe.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
