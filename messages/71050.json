As always.&quot;\n\nQuickstride=\r\n nodds, and sends an oxygen neutralization mist, to clear out the stench.\n\n=\r\n&quot;There, hopefully that&#39;ll work.  And next time, don&#39;t get me in trouble aga=\r\nin.&quot;\n\nUproar shrugs.\n\n&quot;Right, ignore my bright ideas, they usually don&#39;t wo=\r\nrk anyway.&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks to Leo ll and then looks around.\n\n&quot;Hmm, I wo=\r\nnder...  I know there&#39;s a control room around here somewhere..  I&#39;m not too=\r\n good at the technological stuff, but, I used to do a few things, like cont=\r\nrol climate, monitor parameters, that sorta thing.  I wonder if we can gain=\r\n access into the control box, and bypass everything the intruder&#39;s done so =\r\nfar?&quot;\n\nUproar knew where the control box was, he points upwards.\n\n&quot;I know w=\r\nhere the box is, but getting to it, that might not be easy.&quot;\n\nOn the way ba=\r\nck to the Ark, it was clear that Tucson sensed that history was partially r=\r\nepeating itself, from the day he had been taken off line during a harrowing=\r\n battle vorns ago.  He was not about to let anyone down a second time, and =\r\ncertainly not willing to give up to any of the minions, or Hydras&#39;s low lif=\r\ne commandoes.  \n\n&quot;Talon, I deeply appreciate your concern, and take it grea=\r\ntly into heart.  But, I&#39;ve failed our factions once before, I can not and w=\r\nill not let that happen again.  I have to do this, to stop history from rep=\r\neating itself.&quot;\n\nNight Shift could tell Tucson was getting ready to put it =\r\ninto battle gear.\n\n&quot;Look, big guy, Talon&#39;s right, you&#39;re in no condition ta=\r\n put up a fight.  You&#39;re just gonna get yourself even more damaged than ya =\r\nalready are.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;They&#39;re right Wheels, you can&#39;t just throw=\r\n yourself out there at sixty percent power ratio.  It&#39;s like ya said, somet=\r\nimes, we don&#39;t always win the battle, but eventually we&#39;ll win the war.&quot;\n\nS=\r\ntraight Shot listens too.\n\n&quot;I second that.  No one expects you to always sa=\r\nve the day, Tucson.  You&#39;ve stretched yourself over your limits far too man=\r\ny times, and it&#39;s time you gave yourself time to recharge.&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n=\r\n\n&quot; There isn&#39;t any time for that Straight Shot.  For every moment I take to=\r\n recharge, more destruction is inflicted.  Lord Elder is in severe disrepai=\r\nr, everyone there is in grave danger, and there is an enemy unseen by anyon=\r\ne&#39;s scanners that is wreaking havoc in our home.  No, I will not rest until=\r\n this enemy is dealt with.&quot;\n\nNight Shift groans.\n\n&quot;Slag, are you stubborn, =\r\nTucson.  You&#39;re not ready for another fight, plain&#39;n simple!&quot;\n\nTucson&#39;s inn=\r\ner cab vibrates, a slight effect of his emotional state.\n\n&quot;Night Shift, don=\r\n&#39;t.  I&#39;ll do what needs to be done regardless of my condition.  I owe you a=\r\nll that much. I owe you your freedom and your saftey.  I owe everyone that.=\r\n&quot;\n\nRat Trap too, gets upset.\n\n&quot; Wheels, will ya just listen ta us this time=\r\n?!  Ya can&#39;t go inta battle the way you are!  There&#39;s more chances of them =\r\nsend&#39;n ya ta the junkyard now than there is when you&#39;re runn&#39;n with a hundr=\r\ned percent of your power!  You got nothn&#39; left!  You try ta fight now you c=\r\nould go off line permanently!  YOUR LIFE IS DEPENDING ON IT!&quot;\n\nStraight Sho=\r\nt sits up.\n\n&quot;Thank you Rat Trap, exactly what you said.  If we have to temp=\r\norarilly take you off line Tucson we&#39;ll do that for the sake of saving your=\r\n aft! Now Rodimus doesn&#39;t want you to risk your life, and neither does anyo=\r\nne else!  For once, LISTEN TO US!&quot;\n\nTucson pauses.\n\n&quot; Bantor, I - need you =\r\nto go ahead to back up the other Fuzors, and to see if Rodimus needs your h=\r\nelp.  I can now drive myself with the energy I&#39;ve got left.  I will arrive =\r\nat the Ark shortly following your arrival there.  Primus be with you.&quot;\n\nEve=\r\nryone heaves a sigh of releif. Especially Rat Trap.\n\n&quot;Good choice.  So, wha=\r\nt next Wheels?&quot;\n\nTucson replies as he warms up his engine to continue on hi=\r\ns own wheels.\n\n&quot; It seems that whoever has taken control of the Ark, has ta=\r\nmpered with it&#39;s configuration, via the mainframe.  There is only one thing=\r\n that could possibly interrupt that.  My sonar system.  It has the ability =\r\nto disrupt most alien programming, and perhaps with enough of a disruption,=\r\n we may - just be able to gain control of it again.&quot;\n\nRat Trap grins.\n\n&quot;Hee=\r\neeey, that&#39;s right, that&#39;ll create a weankess in the programming and that&#39;s=\r\n when we can take advantage of reclaiming the configurations.  Better get b=\r\nack ta Rodimus and the others about that.&quot;\n\nTucson acknolwedges and contact=\r\ns Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Tucson Prime to Rodimus Prime, over.  As soon as I am close en=\r\nough to the ark, I am going to attempt a short range sonar disruption inter=\r\ncept of the Ark&#39;s systems.  Hopefully this will cause enough of a falter, f=\r\nor us to regain control of the system via an interruption of frequencies.  =\r\nTell - Legacy to be ready to intercept the mainframe on my mark.  Tucson Pr=\r\nime out.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot smiles.\n\n&quot;Now that&#39;s the Tucson Prime I know.  Res=\r\nourceful yet sensible.  Just like a truck should be.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; INSIDE THE ARK\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Heeey, wait a minute, Leo ll, Wind Caliber, I got an i=\r\ndea. Cover your\n&gt; noses, this might get stinky. Hey, Quickstride, eat any b=\r\nean pods lately?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride raises a brow, and transforms into hi=\r\ns beast mode.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;As a matter of fact, I did. And a lot of &#39;em. Stand =\r\nback fellas, stay\n&gt; down wind, and try not ta breathe any of this in.

The venting s=\r\nystem is down while the power is out to the rest of the\n&gt; ship!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wing =\r\nCaliber&#39;s call came too Late as the great gas cloud quickly began to\n&gt; fill=\r\n the air, causing the greenish brown haze to expand rapidly. Quickly the\n&gt; =\r\nvery paint that was on the wall where the intruder had once stood began to\n=\r\n&gt; turn a decidedly darker color and even chip a little from the wall in spo=\r\nts.\n&gt; However there was no other response from the intruder, or the area th=\r\nat he\n&gt; once stood.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Perhaps the *cough* intruder left through the *co=\r\nugh* door when it opened\n&gt; and closed *cough*&quot; Wing Caliber said as he chok=\r\ned on the noxious fumes that\n&gt; was beginning to fill the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortu=\r\nnately this room, unlike the last time when Quickstride let loose\n&gt; with th=\r\nis outside, was enclosed there was no where for the gas cloud to go.\n&gt; And =\r\nmuch as Wing Caliber had surmised, the cloud kept expanding to quickly\n&gt; co=\r\nver the entire chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; Leo&#39;s optics narrowed as he looked at Quickstr=\r\nide, obviously he was not too\n&gt; happy with this turn of events, especially =\r\nbecause his sense of smell was\n&gt; unusually keen. His face was turning a lit=\r\ntle green around the edges.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There&#39;s got to be a *cough* secondary exi=\r\nt from this room *cough*&quot; Leo II\n&gt; said as he looked around. &quot;We need to fi=\r\nnd it and get out of here. *cough*&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile near the sickbay. . . .\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor opened his comlink To Tucson and Rodimus and said &quot;Here is=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor... A volenteer and me will go to Back up Rodimus&quot; after he s=\r\naid\n&gt; &gt; that picked up from Nightlight the weapon that he lend her and look=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; towards the other bots said &quot;One volenteer Follow me, the others ke=\r\nep an\n&gt; eye\n&gt; &gt; in her and lock down the room... It&#39;s time to clean up the =\r\nHouse&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then he left the room following the signatures.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;I read you.&quot; Rodimus said over his comlink to Perceptor. &quot;I am heading=\r\n back\n&gt; towards the bridge. I can&#39;t tell if we have one intruder of more. H=\r\ne&#39;s not\n&gt; showing up on my sensors!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Perceptor left the room, Legac=\r\ny quickly followed behind him, his arm\n&gt; cannon beginning to glow as the te=\r\nmporal guardian prepared for battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus&#39; voice came back over the=\r\n link, &quot;Send someone to see about Elita and\n&gt; Lord Elder too.&quot; There was an=\r\n edge of fear in his voice, fear of harm coming\n&gt; to his daughter, fear of =\r\nharm to his wife. &quot;And keep Nightlight as safe as\n&gt; you can.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon n=\r\nodded, &quot;I will go after Lord Elder.&quot; He looked back at Bump, I am\n&gt; sending=\r\n a security code to the Maximals, if you don&#39;t get that cose, don&#39;t\n&gt; open =\r\nthe door for anyone.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Understood.&quot; Bump said as he rose to his full h=\r\neight, ready to guard the\n&gt; room and Nightlight. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Rodimus, I wi=\r\nll protect Nightlight, and\n&gt; Santon is going after the others.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good!=\r\n&quot; Rodimus replied.\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon sent a small encrypted code to the rest of t=\r\nhe Maximals, &quot;This is so\n&gt; we can recognize each other.&quot; He said. &quot;I don&#39;t =\r\nknow if this intruder can\n&gt; imitate any of us or not.&quot; With a last look bac=\r\nk at Nightlight and Bump\n&gt; Santon went through the door and closed it tight=\r\nly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elita covered Lord Elder with whatever she could f=\r\nind in order to hid him\n&gt; &gt; and she hid somewhere close\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lor=\r\nd Elder remained unconscious, fluid leaking from several of his wounds.\n&gt; I=\r\nt is obvious from the amount of damage that he will require major repairs\n&gt;=\r\n to be functional again.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a soft creak on the floor near to w=\r\nhere Elita was hiding, someone\n&gt; or something was coming in her and Lord El=\r\nder&#39;s direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ON THE WAY BACK TO THE ARK\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [T=\r\nuscon] then transmits to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;RODIMUS, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, I&#39;M=\r\n ON MY WAY, AND MARK MY WORDS WHOEVER IS\n&gt; THERE NOW WILL WISH THEY HADN&#39;T =\r\nATTEMPTED THE INFILTRATION!
