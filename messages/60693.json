Each wore a hood making them \n&gt; &gt; &gt; indistinguishable.  On his left sat Deus, a\n&gt; heartless \n&gt; opportunist; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in front of him sat Ex, a female bot who wished\n&gt; more than \n&gt; anything \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to know what the future held; and to his right\n&gt; was his most \n&gt; &gt; fearsome \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ally Machina, a warrior who wanted merely to\n&gt; live forever, and \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; willing to do whatever it took to break the\n&gt; prophesy that doomed \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; three of them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Seer, however, was under no such restraint.  He\n&gt; could not die, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nor could he leave his palace.  In it destiny\n&gt; energy flowed \n&gt; &gt; through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, he knew all possible pasts and presents,\n&gt; and most futures, \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; existed in all he could see.  Deus shuffled\n&gt; nervously, he was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; planning a betrayal, and he knew Seer knew it,\n&gt; but he also knew \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his betrayal was too small to bother with in\n&gt; retrospect of what \n&gt; &gt; Seer \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was trying to accomplish.  Deus&#39; companion would\n&gt; die, but he \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; live�for now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;The timelines are shifting wildly out of\n&gt; control,&quot; Seer \n&gt; &gt; &gt; said, opening the meeting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;Yes, but is it worth the risk to\n&gt; intervene and try and \n&gt; stop \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it,&quot; said Machina.  He had never been able to\n&gt; see beyond risks, \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was why he was destined to fail at his overall\n&gt; purpose.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;We   will not stop it.  Because of\n&gt; this�Neo Beast War the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; potential pasts and presents are multiplying\n&gt; along with the \n&gt; &gt; future, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but we must gain more destiny potential in order\n&gt; to control it.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some presents are shifting away, becoming\n&gt; obscure.  Thankfully \n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; course of events has provided us with an ample\n&gt; source of \n&gt; &gt; potential.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All actions in a past so distant are magnified\n&gt; in the present.  \n&gt; By \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stealing the potential of even one bot who\n&gt; vaguely resembles a \n&gt; &gt; hero \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or villain we could very well achieve the\n&gt; equivalent of \n&gt; destroying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Optimus Prime.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;Master, I volunteer for this service,&quot;\n&gt; said Ex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;No!&quot; cut in Deus, &quot;I-I mean in such a\n&gt; time period the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; destiny energy could magnify the potential for\n&gt; the prophesy of \n&gt; our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; demise being fulfilled.  We must send someone\n&gt; else.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;Who else could be entrusted with such a\n&gt; task?&quot; asked \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Machina.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;I will personally vouch for\n&gt; Fortuneteller,&quot; said Deus \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; confidence.  All three of the other bots at the\n&gt; meeting burst \n&gt; into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; laughter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;You would send one of our lowest level\n&gt; deviners?&quot; asked \n&gt; Ex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;And your lover at that,&quot; said Machina.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Seer laughed for a moment with them, but\n&gt; then considered \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; idea.  He called on his prescience, and saw the\n&gt; potential for \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; own ends.  Fortuneteller might think she was\n&gt; working for Deus, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he knew he could make her do whatever he wanted\n&gt; in the end with \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; few of Deus&#39; screams if she refused to comply\n&gt; with his \n&gt; &gt; will.  &quot;Very \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well!  She will go, and she will remember her\n&gt; prophesy `So long \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you pay the Seer&#39;s price, no Transmetal will\n&gt; take your life.&#39;  \n&gt; Now \n&gt; &gt; &gt; let us select the target we can gain the most by\n&gt; destroying.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Deus kissed her, and ran his fingers\n&gt; through her hair.  &quot;I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; am yours,&quot; she said, &quot;what do you wish me to\n&gt; do.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;Go to Earth.  Bring me the destiny\n&gt; potential of the bot \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have been ordered to kill.  Say he died before\n&gt; you got to him.  \n&gt; &gt; Only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you, I, and Seer will know.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;But Seer is the one who wants the destiny\n&gt; potential.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;Yes, but he knows everything we&#39;ve done\n&gt; against him, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t acted.  Obviously we&#39;re necessary to\n&gt; avoid some future he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would prefer not to face.  We just need to keep\n&gt; working.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;But I would break my prophesy, and lose\n&gt; my inability to \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; killed by transmetals.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;Isn&#39;t it worth it?  Isn&#39;t it worth it for\n&gt; me?&quot;  He kissed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;Yes, my love.  Yes is it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: O.k., I need a volunteer for\n&gt; Fortuneteller&#39;s quarry.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n=== message truncated ===\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
