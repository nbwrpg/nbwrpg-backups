There \nare currently only two chars active right now, those being Tyrael and \nCheetah. I will defend with as much as I can, including base defenses, \nbut I will not allow them to die like that. If I can, I&#39;ll bring more \nchars in, but I can&#39;t guarantee anything. This said, I warn the two \npred groups that I won&#39;t get Tyrael killed and that the base defenses \nare semi-intelligent. If you have any ideas about this situaton, don&#39;t \nhesitate to warn me! Thanks!\n\n\n"}}
