Yes, I did ask KSL to be a\n&gt; moderator, because he has much more RPGing experience than me, and I am\n&gt; running very low on time, and cutting alot of events I shouldn&#39;t to be\nable\n&gt; to RP. THat doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s in charge of the RPG, or has any special\n&gt; powers. Everyone can point out where rules are broken (but it might get\n&gt; annoying), but KSL is stricter than me, so I figured he&#39;d make a good\n&gt; moderator. I admit that small rules don&#39;t need to be pointed out (swearing\nin\n&gt; OOC mails, etc.) but moding and the like does.\n&gt;\n&gt; And SoulStice, I&#39;d like you to show me the post where Unitron broke the\nshot\n&gt; limit. I could at least be sure that KSL is human then... (kidding)\n&gt;\n&gt; But everyone leave KSL alone, he&#39;s only doing his job. And start arguing.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/Reptilica/Bloodystrike/DevilDuer/WarMachine::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus watches the Chosen Mafia scramble to retreat, frowning. Looking\ndown\n&gt; at his wrist comp, Zardus taps a few buttons, the Alliance base tracking\n&gt; Deemos&#39; group&#39;s location and keeping a watch on them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Should we follow?&quot; War Machine&#39;s voice booms as he steps closer to\nZardus,\n&gt; looking at the combining Mafia in the distance.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; Zardus says, &quot;Kill them.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; WarMachine nods, running at the Mafia gestalt, firing missiles and plasma\n&gt; charges.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Dark One,&quot; Zardus says into his comm, &quot;Can you and your group combine and\n&gt; take that enemy gestalt out?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Everyone else,&quot; he says after switching his comm to the whole Alliance,\n&quot;If\n&gt; you&#39;re not too damage, pursue and destroy. If you are damaged, get into\nthe\n&gt; CR chambers.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With that, he activates his jetpack, flying after the Mafia and firing at\n&gt; Deemos.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Bloodystrike recieves Zardus&#39; orders, flying past the running WarMachine\nand\n&gt; firing a missile at Sharpedge.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica steps out of the CR chamber, grumbling about dangerous work when\nhe\n&gt; recieves Zardus&#39; transmission. He walks to a door, taking off at the exit\nof\n&gt; the base at a run.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer comes to a stop as he sees the Chosen Mafia retreating a few\ndozen\n&gt; feet away from him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s them!&quot; he yells as he sees the Alliance shots heading for them,\n&quot;We\n&gt; need ta kill &#39;em!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He pulls out his stun gun again, running after Stronghold and firing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
