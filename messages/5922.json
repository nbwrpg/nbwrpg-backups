She knew that she could be tracked from her \nsignal. She turned her head and looked back to see if she was being \nfollowed.  She didn&#39;t see any bot following her.  She faced west \nagain.  She could see a snow and eletrical storm up ahead.  She \nthought the electricity would disrupt her signal so she couldn&#39;t be \ntracked.  But she would risk getting hit by lightening.  She took a \ndeep breath. &quot;Yeah, better risk it than get scrapped.&quot;\n\nShe headed straight for the storm.\n\n\n---Original Message---\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; The wolf got a beed on her location and started running toward it. \nHe \n&gt; just hoped that it was a typical Pred following her. &quot;All guns no \n&gt; brains&quot; he said to himself. The Pred broadcast information on all \n&gt; channels, maybe he didn&#39;t know how to tap into direct \ncommunication. \n&gt; Lunarpine didn&#39;t want to underestimate the Pred, it could be a trap.\n\n\n\n"}}
