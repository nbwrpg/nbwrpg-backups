As he approached he\n&gt; could see a single figure standing at the gate=\r\n as if waiting for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; The figure is in the photos section of the clu=\r\nb site:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/306782857/pic/1=\r\n443963172/view\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nOOC - Nice, I really wanted a Battle Unicorn toy.=\r\n  \n\nAt this point, WHEELIE did not know what the robot was, or if they were=\r\n friend or foe.  The Transmetalized state of the building made him cautious=\r\n, regardless.\n\nAt this point, keeping his weapon out in front of him as he =\r\ntransformed to robot mode, &quot;Hey there, or so I say!  It&#39;s a pleasure to mee=\r\nt you on this dreary day!  What an interesting place I see you at.  I think=\r\n Trypticon once crushed it at his kneecap.&quot;\n\nGoing on then and gazing up at=\r\n the Unicorn styled robot, &quot;And isn&#39;t that point on top, make it hard and g=\r\net stuck a lot?  I hope it doesn&#39;t give you an ache, if you keep on smashin=\r\ng into it to break?&quot;\n\nAt this point, Wheelie was speaking this way on purpo=\r\nse.  Not sure if this other robot was friend or enemy, Maximal or Predacon.=\r\n  So, speaking in his nromal way in a tone that was sure to grate would, if=\r\n they were an enemy probably cause them to attack, and if htey were a frien=\r\nd would irritate them tino explaining what was going on then to shut him up=\r\n!\n\n\n\n"}}
