The missiles \npenetrate, the blue glow around them protecting them. They hit the \nshields and explode, sending energy through them.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAstral, Griplash, Fenox, and Starlight continue firing at the \nshields. Recklessa sees Lunarpine attacking an Alliance bot and flies \ntoward him.\n\nShe aims at Lunarpine, firing several energy globs.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot&#39;s vision clears in time to see Proto swooping down on him. \nThe Alliance bot brings up a hand and grabs Proto&#39;s leg, yanking the \nMaximal down. Proto smashes into Perndabot, sending both of them \nrolling on the ground.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster swears again as he watches the shields drop a full 6% from \ntwo of those energy missiles, along with several more precent from \nthe energy weapons. He stands up.\n\n&quot;Slag this. The computer can take care of defences, I&#39;m going out \nthere to fight,&quot; he says to Chordate and walks out of the room. &quot;Oh, \nand go ahead and activate the missiles,&quot; he says over his shoulder, \narming him plasma rifle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRex&#39;s still body shakes as the optic blasts hit it.
