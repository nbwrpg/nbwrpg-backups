Prebon is no where near \nyou. He doesn&#39;t know anything about you?\n\nBlaze had put in Striker&#39;s new personality, and she had repaired most \nof his damaged systems. But the head....he had completly destroyed \nhis own head. It was amazing that this bot had survived. It was \nalmost like the chip was a fate worse than death. It didn&#39;t matter. \nHe would be serving Prebon soon enough, as his top mercenairy. She \neven installed a new name for Striker to go by. As far The Trainers \nwere concerned, Striker was dead. Only his shell remains. His sprak \nhad been completly re-formatted. But back to topic, the head needed \nto be replaced. She carefully disconected it from his body, and \nthrough it aside. Now how was she supposed to make a new head? Wait! \nShe had it! She picked up Striker&#39;s old head, and popped the face \nplate off. It had been virtually undamaged, except for a few blac \nspots. Now she needed a new main part. She went to the cargo area \nwhere the boys were building their new toy.\n\n&quot;Yo, do you guys need the head of the bot you killed?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, here. Take it!&quot; Hammer through her K9&#39;s head. She went back to \nthe bridge and popped the face plate off, and attached Striker&#39;s \nplate. Now all it needed was some minor repairs. She got to work on \nthat, thinking how this bot was going to act when he was finished.\n\n\n"}}
