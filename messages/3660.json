Spotting Rhinox, they \nstopped for a moment, seeing how damaged he and the bot he was carrying was.\n\n&quot;Hey, green guy, you get in a CR chamber too.  We&#39;re fresh and revived, so \nwe&#39;re gonna kick some tailgate!&quot; Smokescreen said, giving Beachcomber a &quot;high \nfive&quot;, heading for a hatch to leave the ship.\n\n---\n\nAnubis rolled, the force of the explosions and shots sending him rolling \nfast, slamming into a rock.  (By the way, Carnage and Crow Lord, Anubis is \nbasically right behind Dinobot, so any rockets fired, the explosions would \nhave a high chance of hitting Mr. Dinobot)\n\n---\n\nSixshot brought up his targeting scanners, rolling out of the way of enemy \nfire.  Getting a lock, he fired six missiles off at the Ark, when flying \nabove it, dropping two photon bombs towards the Ark.\n\n---\n\nKoga Shuko laughed at Liono&#39;s stupidity.  Raising his launcher, he fired a \nmissile off at Liono, followed up by three optic blasts.\n\n"}}
