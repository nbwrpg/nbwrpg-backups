He was going to fast for\n&gt;the other shots to hit. He growls, looking around the battle. The\n&gt;Decepticons were seriously outnumbered.\n&gt;\n&gt;Activating his comm to request assistance from Megatron, Autofire is\n&gt;met with only static. He frowns, trying to contact any of the\n&gt;Decepticons there and resulting in more static. Deactivating his comm,\n&gt;Autofire angles up, firing two missiles at the Supernova/Scrap/Slasys jet.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jen D.&quot; &lt;jeniff@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; (ooc: I&#39;m not good at battles, so sorry if this is confusing :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cyndro&#39;s scanners detected weaponfire outside the Element, and\n&gt;quickly made\n&gt;&gt; a scan to find out who the attackers were. Soon he knew the location\n&gt;and\n&gt;&gt; weaponry of every Decepticon in the area.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You might wanna go out there and fight them, Rubble, we&#39;re under\n&gt;attack.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; he says through a speaker to Rubble, who thanks him and runs out of the\n&gt;&gt; base. Cyndro reroutes more power to the shields, and then activates the\n&gt;&gt; defences.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The round plate on top of the Element flashed several times, and then a\n&gt;&gt; deafening screech was emmited over all comm frequencees other than\n&gt;the ones\n&gt;&gt; that the Maximals were using. After a few seconds, the screech shut\n&gt;off, and\n&gt;&gt; a jamming signal was sent out to disable any communications that the\n&gt;enemies\n&gt;&gt; might have. During the screech, most of the weapons on the Element\n&gt;fired at\n&gt;&gt; the hopefully distracted bots, sending four EMP blasts, one missile,\n&gt;and\n&gt;&gt; five plasma shots at each one, other than the ones that were\n&gt;shielded by the\n&gt;&gt; Cybertronian Fire (I think FireBlade is the only one shielded :).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mantle spun around when all the enemies arrived, and was immediately\n&gt;ready\n&gt;&gt; for battle. He flew into the air and stretched out both arms. A\n&gt;missile flew\n&gt;&gt; out of each arm, both of them mentally guided by Mantle to hit\n&gt;&gt; Rippersnapper. Out of the corner of his eyes, Mantle could see Aqua\n&gt;firing\n&gt;&gt; his spear gun at Flesh Ripper, the same bot that he had tried to get\n&gt;during\n&gt;&gt; the last battle. Near him, Cinder was already firing at Rippersnapper.\n&gt;&gt; Mantle knew that Cinder wanted to impress Prowl, but he hoped that she\n&gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t do stupid things to show off.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Allright, guys, we&#39;ll fight like this for a while, and then we&#39;ll form\n&gt;&gt; Element and chase these guys out of here!&quot; he said to his team over the\n&gt;&gt; commlink, watching Rubble emerge from the Element with his missile\n&gt;launcher\n&gt;&gt; and fire two missiles at Rampage. Mist flew by above him, firing three\n&gt;&gt; charges down at Autofire.\n&gt;&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt;&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
