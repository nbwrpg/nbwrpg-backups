She opened her eyes and looked \nabout.  Her vision was somewhat blurred.  She saw a figure standing \nnear by.  She tried to talk, but she could only whisper,&quot;where am I? \nwho are you?&quot;  She felt another pulse of energy surge through her and \nher body shook violently for a bit.  She closed her eyes and waited \nfor the shaking to stop.  She could still feel pain in her arms from \nthe tubes.  She tried to move her arms and legs, but they would not \nrespond.  She felt a single tear run down her cheek.  She wanted to \nstop shaking and get up, but her body wouldn&#39;t listen to her.  She \nfelt fear, cold,pain, and sorrow all at once.  She couldn&#39;t \nunderstand why this was happeneing.  She was starting to forget her \ntrip to the Matrix.  She could remember a voice from somewhere, but \nthe memory was fading.  She  felt her body stop shaking and now was a \nonly shivering slightly.  She felt her spark pound in her chest.  she \nopened her eyes and her vision was clear this time.  She saw Black \nAracnia near her.  She tried to smile.  She \nwhispered, &quot;black....arac....nia&quot;  her voice jsut wouldn&#39;t come out \nlike she wanted it too.  Her body felt cold, now damp, and heavy to \nher.  She just looked at Black Aracnia, not being able to speak at \nthe moment.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Black Aracnia saw the mouse awaken. It had taken long enough. \nNow, she \n&gt; had to wait until the spasams stoped and then, of course, she would \nneed to \n&gt; be in bed for a day or so. At least now Aracnia could relax.\n\n\n"}}
