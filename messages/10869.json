No need for oxygen in thier systems. A \nBW bot has biotechno parts.  So I would say there is enough eveidence \nto support the theory that Beast Wars and Beast Machines need air to \noxygenate the bio portion of thier bodies.  Living things need \noxygen. Hence BW may need to breath. But they may not have to breath \nlike humans.  So instead taking a breath every 5 seconds, it may be \nthat they have to breath every 30 seconds or something like that.  On \nthe show, when they ar running, they breath harder.  So they must be \nbreathing, but I would have no idea what the ratio is for them.)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (G1 and G2 Transformers didn&#39;t need to breath.

They make sounds like \nthey do.  \n&gt; But I don&#39;t know.  Maybe the Beast Warriors needed to breath oxygen \nto \n&gt; oxygenize their mech-fluid?  Can&#39;t say for sure.
