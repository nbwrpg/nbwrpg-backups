His mad insanity seemed insatiable, and he seemed at the\n&gt; moment to h=\r\nave little care for what his ravaging could have, his\n&gt; minions always seem=\r\ning to watch, looking for the right moment to\n&gt; attack.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What are you =\r\ndoing out here.&quot; LORD ELDER said as he stood just\n&gt; outside the light of th=\r\ne Ark looking in WHEELIE&#39;s direction. Ever\n&gt; playing the role of guard and =\r\nGuardian it was he and LEGACY that often\n&gt; stood the long vigils over the A=\r\nrk and all that were held inside.\n&gt; \n&gt; ELDER&#39;s voice was gentle and concern=\r\ned as his keen optics swept over\n&gt; the area and then smiled at WHEELIE. &quot;Tu=\r\nscon and Rodimus have left and\n&gt; it looks like Leo and some of the others a=\r\nre about to leave soon too.&quot;\n&gt; ELDER&#39;s voice was wise and concerned as he a=\r\npproached. &quot;What draws you\n&gt; out here to look at the stars. I would have th=\r\nought you would be\n&gt; preparing to go with the others.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nOOC - Assumi=\r\nng ths pose is set &#39;before&#39; the time skip and other events.\n\n\nGlancing up a=\r\nt the LORD ELDER, Wheelie glanced up at him from his position over nearby t=\r\nhe ARK.\n\nFinally, WHEELIE spoke, &quot;They went out looking for a fight.  They =\r\ndid not intend to go gentle into that good night.  While everyone is about =\r\nand away, someone else may come to play.  The Ark is what&#39;s here in the pas=\r\nt, someone else may consider it to be excessive ballast.  Something is up, =\r\nwhat I don&#39;t know, I just know I see Maximals about on the go.  I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw why they&#39;re running around, nor what they intend to do on the ground.&quot;\n\nW=\r\natching as the assault team zipped away, &quot;Something may happen to call them=\r\n back, or they may encounter a bit of flak.  What they intend, I don&#39;t know=\r\n.  I just know you don&#39;t put your all into one big throw.  You sometimes wa=\r\nnt to hold some back, just in case you get a smack.  If they go into a trap=\r\n, be lured away for an attack.  At the Ark some of us must stay.  Especiall=\r\ny while everyone else is away.&quot;\n\nContinuing to glance around, &quot;This planet =\r\nis not as it will be, etched into my memory.  It will be different some day=\r\n.  I don&#39;t belong here any way.  But what way iwll it go?  That is what I d=\r\no not know.  Will I still someday meet my friend?  Even though he will die =\r\nin the end?  I do not know what will be our fate.  I can only simply commis=\r\nserate.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
