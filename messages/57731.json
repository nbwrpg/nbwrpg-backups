As I said, this might not please you \nvery \n&gt; &gt; much, but neither am I hot to the idea. I was sent here to get \nyou, \n&gt; &gt; alive or dead. What I suggest is that you leave, in exile. You \ncan \n&gt; &gt; still have contacts with your crew, which I do not necessarily \nwish \n&gt; &gt; to see evicted, but the main thing is that you are not on Earth \n&gt; &gt; anymore. We will not chase you or anything, unless you come \nback. If \n&gt; &gt; you wish, you can negotiate to accomodate yourself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dreadplague looked at Tyrael with a struck air, then at \nDarkangel. \n&gt; &gt; Her voice came out so low that only her fellow warrior could \nhear her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dread: Is he crazy? What is he doing?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Maxima was stunned. It appeared that she was breathing heavily, as \nher \n&gt; crimson optics widened slightly & glared at Tyrael. Barely able to \nkeep her ground, \n&gt; her claws dug into the ground. Forgetting about her wounds, the \npiercing in \n&gt; her lasercore to lose Hydras was far worse. \n&gt; \n&gt; Growling angerly, like the wild, wounded animal she was. Then \nmoved up, in \n&gt; tiger form, next to Hydras. &quot;We will NEVER leave his side. Not \nnow... not ever,&quot; \n&gt; growling evilly at such a suggestion. Her long black & white \nstriped tail \n&gt; flicked hard back & forth behind her.\n\n\n"}}
