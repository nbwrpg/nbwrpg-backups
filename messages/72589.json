There&#39;s\n&gt; only one way to find out. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He leans up against the door and gently taps a talon on it, just enough to\n&gt; be heard.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Nightlight, its me, Tucson.  Are you all right?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He whispers softly while still tapping on the door gently.\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful for things you already\n&gt; posses.  Nothing is worth more than family and friends.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Nov 4, 2011, at 7:42 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson nods quietly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; It&#39;s not that I completely enjoy it, I do what I must to defend others\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; myself. First rule of thumb, act only in defense, and not in offense.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; One\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of Yoketron&#39;s golden rules. I haven&#39;t forgotten them even today.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He had learned a lot from Yoketron, and he thinks back on everything he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; taught and how he developed into who he was today. His temper still\n&gt;&gt; &gt; needed\n&gt;&gt; &gt; work, and he was aware of his weakness from day one.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;ll be honest with you, Big Convoy, I sought Yoketron&#39;s training\n&gt;&gt; &gt; because\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have a weakness I needed to work on. I have an extremely short fuse of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; temper, and I&#39;m still working on it. As a rookie, I knew right away I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; needed to do something about it, so I sought Yoketron&#39;s training, which\n&gt;&gt; &gt; did\n&gt;&gt; &gt; help somewhat but not completely. But what he taught me, I consider it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; priceless. I hope to return to Yoketron to complete my training, because\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; do know I have not yet completed it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He closes his eyes for a moment, and slowly draws his sword into defense\n&gt;&gt; &gt; position. His posture changes as he prepares to take a combative pose.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; His\n&gt;&gt; &gt; feet and legs, appear to be ready to spring into action at a moment&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; notice.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I think we&#39;ll be joined shortly by unwanted company.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as TUSCON spoke those words his com-links sprang to life as\n&gt;&gt; LONGRACK&#39;s voice began to speak across the channel, &quot;Sir. We have\n&gt;&gt; copmmandeered part of their system. I am diverting the alerts away\n&gt;&gt; from your location.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It was obvious from BIG CONVOY&#39;s reaction that he was also recieving\n&gt;&gt; the transmission. It was confirmed as CONVOY spoke, &quot;Can reach the\n&gt;&gt; other Maximals, they need to be warned?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There was a brief pause and then LONGRACK responded, &quot;No. We cannot\n&gt;&gt; reach them as yet, I will see if I can get a link.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; CONVOY grunted, &quot;Let me know as soon as you get one.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Of course sir.&quot; LONGRACK&#39;s voice was calm and factual, belying the\n&gt;&gt; fact that he was scrunched up at the top of an elevator shaft, hacking\n&gt;&gt; into an enemies compter network. &quot;If you continue to the left you\n&gt;&gt; will be heading towards Rhinox&#39;s location. The systems list his\n&gt;&gt; quarters as close by section A-121 on your level.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LONGRACK continued, &quot;Curious?&quot; There was a slight grunt, &quot;Did you are\n&gt;&gt; right outside of ?? . . . Well of course you didn&#39;t. But you are\n&gt;&gt; right outside of what the computer lists as Rodimus&#39; chambers.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
