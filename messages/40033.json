Very, very, very sorry.  \n&gt; There are some major reasons.  Number one, I was going to schedule the first \n&gt; matches this Monday, but thanks to my brother messing with my computer, I \n&gt; can&#39;t access my archive of e-mails and that kind of had my whole game plan on \n&gt; it.  See, I passworded it, but it&#39;s not recognizing my password.  So...I&#39;m \n&gt; not happy.  Also Rdahl has hounded me down since he wants to enter the IGL \n&gt; and told me to freeze it J/K\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s very late, 1 AM Pacific, my brother being lazy, he&#39;ll attempt to fix my \n&gt; computer completely.  But even if he does, I still have to reinstall \n&gt; Realplayer, RealJukeBox, all my games, and a ton of stuff. Moving files, \n&gt; yadda yadda.  So I need to take a little mental break.  I&#39;ll still \n&gt; participate OOC and IC and work on the IGL thing.  I pretty much have it all \n&gt; figured out, I just need that list that is password protected...and I need to \n&gt; speak with Yan when he gets back from gambling away all his money...errr, I \n&gt; mean &quot;Defcon&quot;, about him watching the IGL for any moding.  I noticed some \n&gt; strong characters in a few bios and a few powers concern me ::Is looking at \n&gt; Rdahl :):: J/K\n&gt; \n&gt; So, thanks for all you IGL contestants, I&#39;m very sorry about postponing it, I \n&gt; don&#39;t want to.  I want to start it.  It&#39;s off schedule by two weeks and that \n&gt; ain&#39;t good.  But, but, so some things can get rolling ya know, if you want a \n&gt; character to be in a fight to the death match, e-mail me personally with the \n&gt; name of that character(s) who will fight to the death.  Then I will pair them \n&gt; up with anyone else who wants to do so.  )\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks very much -\n&gt; L.
