Her pride had \nbeen \n&gt; hurt, not to mention her jaw. She looked at Perceptor and shook \nher \n&gt; head. &quot;What? Never looked at a femme before?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And with that, she went to he base entrance. There, she thought of \n&gt; Carnatron and his last transmission. She wondered what he could do \n&gt; for her to eliminate the maximals. But yet, her loyalty was to \n&gt; Hyrdas. And for that, she could not go against anything he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; yet, her thoughts returned to SharpClaw. Why had he done this and \nwhy \n&gt; did he think he had to do this? This isn&#39;t like a Predacon to safe \n&gt; another from self destruction? maybe he&#39;s a maximal in disguise, \nshe \n&gt; thought. Her optics shined with hate towards him.\n\n\n"}}
