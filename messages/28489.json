Even she wasn&#39;t this bad when \nshe was first created, or she at least didn&#39;t remember being that bad.\nMust be a male thing.\n&lt; Thinks he can get away with anything!&gt; was her thoughts.\nShe just hoped that the nip got through to him and he&#39;de learn to keep his \nmanners around her.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
