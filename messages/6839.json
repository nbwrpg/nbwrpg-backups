He and Megatron engaged in a one on one\nbattle. Prime had Mega down. Mega saw a gun, under some ruble, the Prime\ndidn&#39;t see. Mega asked for mercy, so he could buy time to get to the\ngun. When Mega pleded, Prime said &quot;I thought you were made of sterner\nstuff.&quot; I saw Mega grab for the gun, and I jumped on him to stop him.\nIf I had stayed out of it, Prime could have finished him. But Megatron\nheld me as a hostage. &quot;Out of the way Hot Rod!&quot; Prime said. Megatron\ngrabed the gun, and shot Prime several times, yelling &quot;FALL, FALL!&quot;\nPrime fell to the ground. Megatron through me aside, and walked to\nPrime. &quot;It&#39;s over Prime.&quot; Said Megatron. Prime nocked Megatron over the\nedge, yelling &quot;Never!!&quot; I ran over to Prime, and asked him to forgive\nme. He then went into stasis lock. He died later, in sickbay.\nIt was all my falt that Prime died. And I never forgave myself.&quot;\n\n"}}
