She\nlooked all around Rowdy&#39;s den but didn&#39;t find the thing that she needed to\nhelp bring down the small fever.\n&gt; Zyber suddenly saw a water bastion and a small wooden bowl, she walked\nover and picked both up only to carry them back to set them beside Striker.\nShe poured just enough water into the bowl to be soaked up by some sort of\ncloth, she then took a small piece of fur and dampened it.\n&gt; Zyber wrung the fur out and folded it enough that she could lay it over\nStriker&#39;s optics and forehead.\n&gt; She placed the damp fur where it belonged and then set the bowl and\nbastion aside, that should at least bring the fever down a little.\n&gt; Zyber looked over at Rowdy, she knew that something was wrong since he had\nseen the Maximal symbol on the damaged bot. But now was not the time to\nworry about race or who hates who, now was the time to save an injured bot&#39;s\nlife!\n&gt; She sighed and sat back on her heeds.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Do you happen to know where I can find the plant    &#39; Devil&#39;s Club&#39;\nabout your territory somewhere? It would help bring the fever down more and\nalso to help heal his wounds a bit faster.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She knew this fact by spark, she had been injured a number of times and\na mixture of devil&#39;s club, mint, thistle, and pond lily had saved her life.\nShe was doubtless that the same mixture could save this bot as well, she had\nto try something...didn&#39;t she?\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor continued towards the bridge in a slow pace, still weak from\nthe massive loose of mech-fluid. CR chambers could replace and construct a\nbot&#39;s body back to normal health but it couldn&#39;t replace the amount of fluid\nlost in combat, a minor set back.\n&gt; She sighed as she continued on her way, it was then that Prowl came up\nbeside her and asked if she was alright, she smiled as she continued to\nwalk.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Yes. Besides being weak from the lose of mech-fluid I&#39;m fine. Thanks for\nasking.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She looked over at him and noted that he too was now fully healed, she\nwas glad to see that.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed as she walked, he had saver her life...yet again.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I have to thank you...for saving my life again. I...don&#39;t seem to know\nhow I can repay you for that deed. Any suggestions?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * He had saved her life and it was only fair to give him some sort of\nreward for it, she would do the same for any other transformer that managed\nto save her spark.\n&gt; Iron Raptor stopped when she finally entered into the bridge, the computer\ngave the damage report on the Ark and she growled. It would take more then a\nFEW mega-cycles to repair the damage caused by the Alliance attack, but at\nleast most of the troops were safe.\n&gt; It was then that she realized that Teltoli wasn&#39;t back, why was that?\n&gt; She sighed yet again and walked up to a computer screen to survey the\ndamage to the ship and how much power was lost.\n&gt; Iron Raptor put most of her weight on her shoulders and wrists as she\nleaned on the table supporting the comp, being weak from the fluid lose.*\n&gt;\n&gt; * She\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
