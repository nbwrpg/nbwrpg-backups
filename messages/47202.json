Neutral Terrain remains \nsuch. \n&gt; &gt; If you were mentionning my earlier venture near your base, then I \n&gt; &gt; would have to say that I am a Maximal, and that I consider \nhelping my \n&gt; &gt; brethrens as my duty. And bravery, my esteemed Kali, is not \ndifficult \n&gt; &gt; to find. Would you dare to stand up to your leaders because of \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; you think?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; North America...so then that was their location. Neutral Terrain to \nboot. \n&gt; That meant Kali wouldn&#39;t dare to try an attack out here...would \nshe? Or would \n&gt; she defy her leaders? In any case, despite her beast form being \npartially \n&gt; bat, Mistra would be glad to be free of this cave...and of any \npossible \n&gt; conflict at the current time. When she changed...or maybe not...her \n&gt; activation code, things would be different of course.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;He looked at her intensely. She read open defiance, and he knew \nit. He \n&gt; &gt; just wished she could let them go. Besides, Prowl had told him \nabout \n&gt; &gt; the non-agression pact. That could be the key.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: As for my friend Mistra, I believe she has already \nchosen. \n&gt; &gt; I will also refresh your memory, if you allow. Maximals and \nPredacons \n&gt; &gt; have agreed to non agression, right? If you do not let us go \nsafely, \n&gt; &gt; this could mean war. Think, and you shall see you clearly do not \nwant \n&gt; &gt; a war. Now step aside.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Mistra was confused...but things were looking up. So...the Maximals \nand \n&gt; Predacons had agreed to non-agression then. She just hoped Kali \nwould listen \n&gt; to Azure&#39;s words and move to aside for them to leave. Oddly \nenough...Kali \n&gt; hadn&#39;t seemed to do more than glance at her before her full \nattention was on \n&gt; Azure. Perhaps because he looked more daunting to the Predacon as \nhe was than \n&gt; she did. It made sense, come to think of it...or perhaps because \nshe was as \n&gt; of yet, still new to this planet and its conflicts. Or just the \nfact she&#39;d \n&gt; already chosen her side, and Kali didn&#39;t see any point in trying to \nchange \n&gt; her mind. Whatever the reason, Mistra was glad Azure had taken \ncharge in this \n&gt; situation.\n\n\n"}}
