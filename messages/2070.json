Owner of Shuko International and PredTech Labs, he is one of the \nmost influential Cybertronians ever in their 12 million year history.  \nGetting the name Koga Shuko from Japanese history (Koga Shuko being a \npowerful Japanese warlord), he thinks of himself as a warlord, crippling all \nother business.  After investing in gestalt technology with a regular \nbusiness partner, Set, the Oblitercons destroyed one of his most valuable \nlabs, costing him several million (since no name has ever been given for the \nCybertronian monetary unit, I will not put one in).  After sending a commando \nteam to hunt them down, he got a report their ship crashed.  Forming a group \nwith Set, he set off for Earth.  During the flight, the ship was hit by \nasteroids composed of unscannable metals, causing the ship to crash on Earth. \n Now Shuko sets out to fufill his destiny.\n\nCharacter Personality:\n\nKoga Shuko thinks things through.  If something isn&#39;t for his benefit in one \nway or another, he won&#39;t do it.  Merciless, but can be merciful when it is to \nhis benefit, Shuko will not show pity.  He doesn&#39;t care for any of his men.  \nIn his mind, everyone except himself is expendable.\n\nCharacter Stats:\n\nFunction: Corporation Leader/Leader/Warrior/Scientist\n\nStrength: 8.5\nIntelligence: 10.0\nSpeed: 5.0\nEndurance: 9.2\nRank: 1.0 \nFirepower: 8.6\nSkill: 10.0+\n\nBeast Mode Description:\n\nKoga Shuko&#39;s beast mode is a large Komodo Dragon.  With teeth that can pierce \nsteel, this mode weighs over a ton, easily enabling Koga Shuko to pin his \nenemies and claw them to death.  His scales act as a super-srong armor, and \nhis tail is like a deadly club, able to smash through a 20 ft thick tree \ntrunk.\n\nRobot Mode Description:\n\nWith a superbly armored red and black body, Koga Shuko is a menacing sight.  \nWith an energon blade in a scabbard around his waist, and a laser rifle in \nhis right hand.  His optics a bright emerald, a face plate where his mouth \nwould be.  In subspace he possesses a plasma rifle, gattling gun, missile \nlauncher, and a set of charges.\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
