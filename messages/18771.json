He hoped this \nwould work. He rerouted some of the power in the shields to the computers. It \nhad been at least two hours since they went off. He had found a dozen of \nPhobia&#39;s babies with hisown short range scanners that is why the computers \nhad still not been restarted. He had destroyed them and saw that they where \nall in some type of stasis. This proving that they where in some way damaged \nby the pulse but not destroyed. He turned and saw all the comps come online. \n..&quot;Computer make scan of all internal systems and seek them out and destroy \nall of them. Modify for any possible cloaking of shield modification.&quot; He \nsmilied at his work and sat back for a well deserved rest.\n\n"}}
