Welcome around! \n&gt; \n&gt; Playing in the rpg is quite simple; since it&#39;s a play by e-mail \n&gt; (pbem), you simply state what your characters do and say. Since \nyou \n&gt; say you&#39;ve been on the website, you might have read the rules. \nSimply \n&gt; summarized: Have fun, but don&#39;t play the characters of others and \n&gt; don&#39;t be a god. Seems easy, but the step can be subtle! But don&#39;t \n&gt; worry, it&#39;s not that hard. \n&gt; \n&gt; The story for now is that the Beast Wars have begun anew after the \n&gt; Beast Wars series (Beast machine never occured, although there are \n&gt; techno-organics). First there were only Maximals and Predacons, \nbut \n&gt; soon the Tripredacus came to get Megatron (who later became Hydras \n&gt; when he fused with Galvatron), a task that they yet have to \n&gt; accomplish. There are many storylines currently going on, but \nsince \n&gt; there have been elections lately, the game format could change to \n&gt; something we hope will be even better! \n&gt; \n&gt; As for character creation, just follow the rules on the website. \n&gt; Since you can&#39;t really submit anything right now on the website, \nyou \n&gt; can upload it on the Yahoogroups page (files link). State your \n&gt; faction (Maxies, Preds or Tripreds), your gender (if any) and a \nbrief \n&gt; description of your character along with its armament. No more \nthan 5 \n&gt; weapons though! \n&gt; \n&gt; Be careful though; since you are two players, you should make two \n&gt; separate yahoo ID&#39;s, unless you want to play as a single player. \nIt&#39;s \n&gt; up to you! \n&gt; \n&gt; Last thing (I&#39;ve said a lot for someone just joining, haven&#39;t I?), \nif \n&gt; you need any more information, the other players are your best \n&gt; sources for advices. Not sure with a rule? Ask someone! What&#39;s \nthis \n&gt; faction doing? Ask someone (preferably in that faction)! You don&#39;t \n&gt; know what time it is? Down to the right of your screen!
