She aims, and fires three impact explosive disks \nat the largest target there, Train Wreck. She growls to herself, \n&quot;You ain&#39;t gettin away easy this time.&quot; She prepares for another \nround of fire.\n\nAxis, who is standing around with Lokk and Seekker, is suprised \nwhen weaponfire starts streaking around him. &quot;Whoa, that was \nclose!&quot; He turns around, and spots some bots he knows: Train \nWreck, McGowan and her group, and Demos. He watches the \nfighting until Lokk smacks him, &quot;Axis, wake up, we&#39;ve gotta defend \nthe base.&quot; Lokk draws his twin chain guns, and starts running \ntowards McGowan, firing continuously. Shells litter the ground, \nbehind him.\n\nStartled, Axis draws his charging laser, and his missile launcher. \nHe looks around, unsure of which enemy bot to attack. He yells to \nLokk, &quot;Lokk, which one should I attack?&quot; Exasperated, Lokk calls \nback, &quot; Just chose one!&quot; So Axis looks around again, and spots \nBarrymore. He follows Lokk firing two missiles at Barrymore, and \npowering up his large laser.\n\n\nOn 6 Jul 2001, at 20:53, Rudra656@... wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: The posts confused me so I&#39;m not sure where the battle is.
