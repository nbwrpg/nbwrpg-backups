He looks over at Najah. &quot;Composer&#39;s just entered the base. He&#39;s carrying alot of supplies, so he&#39;ll probably need help.&quot;\n\nHe then turns to Wheeljack. &quot;Good. We&#39;ll want her on her way as soon as possible. Follow me, I&#39;ll take you to her.&quot;\n\nZardus walks off toward another exit, glancing at a reflection in one of the shuttles to make sure that Wheeljack was following.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ&#39;s comm plays back the message left on his answering machine, and he looks over at Vamprah. &quot;Wait right here. Wheeljack will be right in. I have to go take care of something.&quot;\n\nHe walks out of the room, tapping his comm. &quot;I&#39;m on my way,&quot; he says to Lady Hawk as he walks toward her lab.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMosquitor looks over to Hurricane, walking along with him. &quot;So, how has Hell Beast led his troops without me?&quot; He asks, thinking that they were in the Predacon base and under Hell Beast&#39;s command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Time had passed and by now Lady Hawks creations had grown. they were now\n&gt; about four feet in height and learning quickly. They were held in Stasis\n&gt; fields keeping them in thier place. Each had recieved the agression of it&#39;s\n&gt; animal side, if the bot that recieved the samples got those it would be\n&gt; uncontrollable.\n&gt; \n&gt; She opened her comm to Zarddus getting his answering machine.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m out destroying, plundering, and killing right now, or I&#39;m home\n&gt; and just plotting to, either way I&#39;m not answering, leave your name and\n&gt; number after the beep and I&#39;ll get back at- ER I mean back To you.&quot; it says\n&gt; playing punishing elevator music dureing the pause before the beep Zardus\n&gt; truly was a Sadist.\n&gt; \n&gt; BEEEEEP\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Zardus, I have the samples you asked for come and see them for yourself\n&gt; and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll aprove and I can leave.&quot; Lady Hawk says in her usual\n&gt; courteous tone. She knew that it was propper to use a high ranking bots\n&gt; title with his name even when there was only limited respect for the bot.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: CYBERWOLF4 &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 28, 2001 9:08 AM\n&gt; Subject: Lady Hawk\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC since she never got her samples I&#39;ll pick Lady Hawk up from here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BIC Lady Hawk grew tired of waiting, If Zardus had lied about providing\n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; samples for her experiments she decided to provide her own. She searched\n&gt; &gt; through her DNA samples and decided to use Scorpion and Snake DNA fused\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; theAlien DNA Zardus had provided. A small pool of DNA sat before her,\n&gt; &gt; already beginning to grow. Much like Doctor Frankenstein she was creating\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; monster and didn&#39;t even know it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
