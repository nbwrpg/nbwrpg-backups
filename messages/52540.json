It digs and stays there. He manages to dodge the harpoon \nthis time, but barely. He fires his autocannon again but he adds a \nGauss slug. At this distance, there was no way Riekan could away the \nsonic iron bullet.\n\nThe eye lasers catch Katya where her guts would have been and destroy \nthe small laser located there. She aims her three remaining weapons at \nPumpskin&#39;s head and fires.\n\nKatya: Stravag! You machines take a lot, but I have something to pay \nwith!\n\nJust then, Blackfang comes in, leaping and slashing with his halberd, \ntrying to go for Pumpskin&#39;s tentacles. It would take more time to \nregenerate than with simple laser shots.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Riekan dodges to one side and launches his boomerang blades, \nfollowed \n&gt; by another explosive harpoon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fury, still under cloak, dashes across the battlefield, intending to \n&gt; help his shark-friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pumpskin uses his longer legs to start closing the distance again.  \n&gt; Katya&#39;s fire impacts on his tentacles, but it turns out to be a \n&gt; wasted effort as the damage regenerates within seconds!  The \n&gt; oversized Halloween reject returns fire with his own eye lasers.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ragnar had not seen the attack coming. In fact, he realized just \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; they had cloaking abilities. The harpoon exploded on his thigh but \n&gt; &gt; hardly did more than to shed some armor off. He swung his \n&gt; autocannon \n&gt; &gt; in line with the newly appeared Riekan and let go a double shot \n&gt; along \n&gt; &gt; with his two large lasers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ragnar: Maximals! They have more troops coming in, but these have \n&gt; &gt; cloaking devices! Be careful!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On the other side of the battlefield, Katya barely escaped the \n&gt; &gt; tentacles of the pumpkin bot. Her speed did help her greatly and \n&gt; she \n&gt; &gt; soon was meters away from him. She aimed at the two nearest \n&gt; appendages \n&gt; &gt; and tried to fry them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katya: Stravag! Katya to Ragnar and Rodimus, I am being engaged. \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; hit-and-run will have to wait a bit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang: Katya, I&#39;m coming to assist...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katya: Neg! He is mine! Distract the others.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang saw the fake Optimus and fired his shotgun on him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar&#39;s only warning that he has a much closer opponent than \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras&#39;s group is the distinctive &quot;k&#39;thunk&quot; sound of Riekan&#39;s \ngun \n&gt; &gt; &gt; launching and explosive harpoon.  The shot forces him to \ndecloak, \n&gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he retains most of the element of surprise.\n\n\n"}}
