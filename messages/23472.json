Shokaract, irratated,\n&gt; follows. The\n&gt; &gt; Mini-Mafia, the team who formed the gestalt Mobster, followed behind\n&gt; &gt; Shokaract. Doom Ice finishes screwing Rizopas&#39; head on, but it\n&gt; falls of\n&gt; &gt; again. So she picks it up and drags him behind her to the Iron\n&gt; Fist.
