She located the \n&gt; &gt; engineering section, the prisoner holding cells, the main \n&gt; ventilation \n&gt; &gt; supply systems, lab and hanger bays.  She was just wondering \n&gt; around, \n&gt; &gt; looking rather lost and not sure of where to go.  She eventually \n&gt; &gt; found the Med bays and went to the console.  She looked around \n&gt; first \n&gt; &gt; to make sure that no one was looking. Then, she opened up the \n&gt; console \n&gt; &gt; pad and started to look for info on the bot Nightlight.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She soon found what she was looking for. THe original bot known \nas \n&gt; &gt; nightlight had been here. Was reprogrammed and into another bot. \n&gt; She \n&gt; &gt; was about to find the name when she heard a noise. She closed out \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; computer terminal and made a rather loud sigh. &quot;Drat. I try to \nfind \n&gt; &gt; the map to find my way around and this stupid computer won&#39;t help \n&gt; me. \n&gt; &gt; All it does is bring up medical stuff to which I know nothing \n&gt; about. \n&gt; &gt; By the PIT won&#39;t this bad day just end already.&quot;  She whined a \n&gt; little \n&gt; &gt; and turned to leave. Her head low and her shoulders drooping a \nbit, \n&gt; &gt; just incase someone was watching.\n\n\n"}}
