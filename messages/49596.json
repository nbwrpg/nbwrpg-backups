Burrock, on the other hand, received many shots \nthroughout him and his acidic gland got blown up. The result, however, \nwas more dire.\n\nThe worm-like robot, started tilting forward and fell on the ground, \nin the midst of battle. Then, he started bulging up, chemical \nreactions inside him tearing the techno-organic tissues and circuits \napart, then frying the whole body. The tripredacus finally exploded \nwith a forceful blast, spraying sharpnels, flesh and a lot of acid on \neveryone around the base.\n\nSeeing his new warrior die so prematurously, Tyrael got angry. He \ntransformed to phoenix mode, grabbed the remains of Burrock and flew \nup high.\n\nTyrael: Tripredacus! We retreat now! You shall see more of me, \nMegatron! Few have ever escaped me, and you will not be one of them!\n\nHe started flashing, his light glowing brighter and brighter, until it \nbecame like a sun a few meters from the base. This would perfectly \ncover the retreat...\n\n\n"}}
