Oh..uh, yeah sure thing commander.  I think I have most of the figures \nI need to start drilling in these two back caves to make the escape tunnels \nthat you spoke of.  I mentioned to Megatron that you had mentioned this and \nwas acting under you suggestion. I will need help managing the lazar to make \nthe tunnels.  If it pleases you, I would need your help on this project.&quot;\n\n------Original Message---------\nFrom: Talon Harvilicz  &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\nDate: Fri Jun 23, 2000 4:27pm\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nQuickstrike:\n\n\nQuickstrike looked around the cave, eyeing the progress. He made a count of \nthe bots inside their new base, and thought of what could be done. As Dark \nMouse said, they had scanners, auto-guns, and a few escape routes were on \ntheir way. He walked up to the mouse&#39;s position, getting a little bored with \nbeing the overseerer.\n\n&quot;Help you wit&#39; anythin&#39;?&quot; he asked her.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
