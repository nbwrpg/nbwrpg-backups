Try to not use energy weapons.  I wish to attempt to form \nOblitertron again later.&quot;  Dark One fired of a pair of missiles as he \nreceived acknowledgements from the rest of his team.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown let out a loud grunt as the missile exploded against his left \npectoral, the explosion tearing apart much of his armor, his face cut from \nthe exploding metal.  &quot;Hey, you too!&quot; he  yelled as he fired a grenade off at \nShokaract.\n\n---\n\nPyro fired off three fire balls at Serge.\n\n---\n\nHiss fired off three fusion blasts from his cannon at Shokaract.\n\n---\n\nScavenger fired off another 25 explosive rounds at the Mafia Base.  He lifted \nup his left arm, firing off another rocket from his bazooka at the Mafia Base.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf lifted his sword, another blade missile launching out at the \nshields.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper fired another blast of flames from his mouth at the base.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw brought his hands together, slowly pulling them apart until they \nwere three feet apart.
