He aims his missile\n&gt; &gt; launcher, firing two missiles at Necromancer, backed by two dozen\n&gt; &gt; laser shots from his rifle.\n&gt;\n&gt; Laser shots hit the rim of the crater forcing the warrior to stay low.\n&gt; Repressors missles hit the opposite side of the crater Necromancers hiding\n&gt; in sending shrapnel into his bad wing\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prowl sighs in frustration as Necromancer opens fire on the Alliance\n&gt; &gt; again. For a second he wondered what the punishment for disobeying\n&gt; &gt; orders like this would be in Striker&#39;s old group.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Stop firing!&quot; he says over the comm to Necromancer.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; Necromancer thinks for a moment the consaquences of his actions, stop\nfiring\n&gt; he&#39;s a sitting duck. Return fire he&#39;s a sitting duck. Either situation\ncomes\n&gt; up with a negative ending. the only result seemed to be take some of the\n&gt; fragging scum that calls themselves the alliance with him. He doesn&#39;t like\n&gt; the thought of disobeying Prowls orders but it seemed way to late to do\n&gt; anything but that. &quot;I&#39;d love to oblige Prowl but I&#39;m a little tied down to\n&gt; consider it.&quot;\n&gt; .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shokaract over commlink to Zardus: Zardus, are we firing again?..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Necromancer lost his patience with the situation, &quot;No you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; dieing.&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fired five fireballs at Shockarackt, smiling as the weapon recoiled\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; each shot.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
