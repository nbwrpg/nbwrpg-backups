He tilts his head in \ngreeting toward Epyon, and then walks up to Iron Raptor, saluting.\n\n&quot;Commander, this is Firedrill. I picked him and two other bots up \nfrom a crash site.&quot; he says outloud, while his thoughts convey a \nslightly different message to Iron Raptor alone: -He seems kinda \nfamiliar to me, love, but I can&#39;t place my finger on it. Maybe its \nnothing. I have a feeling we can trust him though.-\n\nProwl motions for Firedrill to step forward, taking a step off toward \nEpyon. He needed to speak to him about the city idea.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;But the strategies are important to any battle, to keep the troops\n&gt; together,&quot; Firdrill exclaims. He then thinks about Prowl&#39;s words \nabout\n&gt; needed warriors. He was not anxious to hear that. He didn&#39;t train \nfor ten\n&gt; years, just to learn how to aim a gun and take life, he trained to \nsave it.\n&gt; He followed on in silent, contemplating.\n\n\n"}}
