It was silent and brigh=\r\nt.  And just when it seemed nothing would ever happen there until future Ea=\r\nrth, something did happen.  Out of nowhere, a big blue portal appeared.  Th=\r\nen, the portal warped in a strange alien building!  The building resembled =\r\na pyramid sort of, with a strange blue crystal at the top.  At each corner,=\r\n there were long pole-like things sticking up.  Then, several other smaller=\r\n blue portals appeared, and each one warped in.....Alien creatures!  But al=\r\nien creatures didn&#39;t seem like the right word(s) for these.....People.  Yes=\r\n, a people.  Not a human people, but an extra-terrestrial people.  Two of t=\r\nhem were wearing some bandana-thing over their mouths, and each had a sort =\r\nof cape on.  And, strangely, these peeps were permanently cloaked(invisible=\r\n).  They had strange blades too.  \n   \n          Two of the other warriors,=\r\n well, they looked like warriors anyway, wore strange-but-cool armour, and =\r\non their back-hands they had little gadgets which, when activated, emitted =\r\nlittle blades made out of a blue lazer material.  \n   \n          The next t=\r\nwo people that arrived were also strange.  They wore strange armour, but it=\r\n wasn&#39;t combat armour.  You couldn&#39;t see their faces, all you could see was=\r\n blackness and then two red, glowing dots, their eyes.  They looked like ma=\r\ngic-users, or priests or something that represented mysticism, religion or =\r\nsorcery.\n   \n          Finally, the last two....people....were warped in.  =\r\nThese didn&#39;t look like the others!  They looked more mechanical than biolog=\r\nical.  The had four legs, two at each end, robotic legs.  At the top they h=\r\nad robotic armour and shit.  \n   \n          But, it wasn&#39;t the end of the w=\r\narping!  Two, much larger, blue portals appeared....In the sky!  Then, emer=\r\nged two big ships(I won&#39;t powergame).  Hehe, if you looked at them, they al=\r\nmost resembled bumbe-bees.  But then again, not really.  The two ships flew=\r\n out of the warping portal, then they hovered high in the air, casting an i=\r\nmmense shadow over the building and the people.  They stayed there.  \n   \n =\r\n         &quot;Ah, Zeratul, we&#39;ve arrived at a strange planet indeed.....Why, it=\r\n reminds me of Tarsonis, but, it seems.....different,&quot; said one of the cloa=\r\nked dudes to the other one.\n   \n          &quot;Yes, Toranis, it does resemble t=\r\nhe Terran Raynor&#39;s homeworld quite closely....&quot; Zeratul said.\n   \n         =\r\n &quot;My brethren!&quot; shouted one of the dudes with lazer blades, &quot;This must be t=\r\nhe UED homeworld, Earth!!!&quot;\n   \n          &quot;Why, I believe you&#39;re correct, A=\r\nllanon!  But it seems.....Uninhabited,&quot; Zeratul replied.\n   \n          The =\r\ntwo mage-looking guys, who&#39;s names were Anthradar and Azlis, spoke up.\n   \n=\r\n          &quot;This world isn&#39;t uninhabited.....I feel a presence on this plane=\r\nt....But it&#39;s definitely not Terran or Human,&quot; Azlis said.\n   \n          &quot;M=\r\ny brother is correct,&quot; Anthradar added.\n   \n          &quot;Well, then we should=\r\n explore this planet,&quot; Toranis suggested.\n   \n          The other dude with=\r\n lazer blades, named Amostitus, nodded, and said, &quot;Perhaps, we should send =\r\nthe Carriers to scout....&quot;\n   \n          &quot;That would be a good idea.....&quot; Z=\r\neratul said.\n   \n          And so they did send the Carriers.
