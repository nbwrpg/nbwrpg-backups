She had Land Mine, Time Bomb, \n&gt; Drillbit, Phobia.  She wondered if she could talk to Terrorsaur about \n&gt; joining her.  She was getting fed up with Megatron.  She had lost her \n&gt; leg in the last battle because of his foolhearty plans.  Come to \n&gt; think of it, he went into battle without a real plan or stratagy.\n&gt; \n&gt; She was beginning to think that maybe she could run the Pred pack.\n&gt; She had a broad grin on her face.  But now wasn&#39;t the time to act.  \n&gt; She waould have o make sure that the group would follow her and not \n&gt; go back to Megatron at the first sign of trouble.  She wondered if it \n&gt; was even possable.\n&gt; \n&gt; She turned to Phobia, &quot;You know, I was wondering, what would happen \n&gt; if we went and took the ship for Megatron without him knowing it. And \n&gt; then hand it over to him as a surprize? I wonder if he would like \n&gt; that?  I mean, he&#39;d then have the best ship around.  He could then \n&gt; destroy the Maximals once and for all. And Megatron would be in \n&gt; command of the ship and he wouldn&#39;t have even gotten his hands \n&gt; dirty.  We would have done it for him.  I&#39;ll bet that would earn a \n&gt; little respect from him.&quot; She looked up at the ceiling with a wide \n&gt; grin on her face. &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s be proud of us.  We could go and \n&gt; conquer the ship and just hand it over to him.  We do all the work \n&gt; and he gets the ship.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Just the it clicked in her head, they did all the work now and were \n&gt; getting nothing. A good crew must be paid well for thier efforts lest \n&gt; they leave or turn on you.  A good pack leader must take good care of \n&gt; a good crew.  Megatron wasn&#39;t doing anything but getting the group \n&gt; killed off one by one.  They had already lost Quickstrike and \n&gt; DarkMouse.  Who knows who was next to go meet the Matrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
