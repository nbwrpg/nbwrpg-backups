Well, all I can say to that is: You missed Galvatron!&quot; Unitron yelled \nwith a chuckle, his laser rifle appearing in his hand from subspace and \npointing at Megatron.  Three bolts shot out at Megatron&#39;s abdomen the \nboosters in Unitron&#39;s feet propelled him back and into the air slowly, \ngaining momentum quickly, as he fired upon Megatron.\n\n"}}
