She still waits to see what weapon he want=\r\ns her to transform into.\n\n&quot;Umm Kup, ya forgot ta mention which weapon you p=\r\nreffer, cross bow or traditional bow?  Any of them will do.&quot;\n\nTucson couldn=\r\n&#39;t help but put an arm around Talon, and give her a gentile embrace.\n\n&quot; And=\r\n as for you Talon, we will need some heavy hitters to finish the job. I hav=\r\ne full trust in you as a warrior and I&#39;d like you to join me in bringing up=\r\n the rear.  Rodimus, you will go before me, and if anything happens to you,=\r\n I will back you up.&quot;\n\nNight Shift then turns to Perceptor.\n\n&quot; Okay Percept=\r\nor, looks like you&#39;n I are gon&#39; it tagether.  No worries, I&#39;ve done plenty =\r\nof silent infiltrations, and ben&#39; a ninjabot, I know when ta make myself sc=\r\narce.&quot;\n\nRat Trap now approaches Windlord.\n\n&quot;If ya want, we could team up.  =\r\nThat way you&#39;re not gon&#39; it alone.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;Excellent idea, Rat Tr=\r\nap. In this case, it doesn&#39;t hurt everyone to be working with another comra=\r\nde, due to the magnatude of this mission. It&#39;s far safer for everyone to te=\r\nam up with someone.&quot;\n\nQuickstride raises his hand.\n\n&quot;We forgot about Rodimu=\r\ns, I think I better go with him.  Y&#39;know, for extra fire arm support?&quot;\n\nTuc=\r\nson nodds.\n\n&quot;Yes, I agree.  Rodimus, I&#39;m sending Quickstride with you.  His=\r\n skills on the battlefield will be much needed.  And Cheetor, feel free to =\r\nfall back on anyone you wish.  The more we work with each other, the strong=\r\ner we will be.   And as for Cyclonus, that is the only exception my friends=\r\n.  I do not wish to lose any of you to his wrath, therefore, I wish to deal=\r\n with him myself.&quot;\n\nRat Trap gasps.\n\n&quot;But, but, that&#39;s almost like suicide!=\r\n  Ya heard Rodimus!  Ya can&#39;t do that!&quot;\n\nTucson grins.\n\n&quot;Not if I listen to=\r\n the power of the Matrix.  It will guide me, as it has guided Optimus Prime=\r\n.  I will not stray from its wisdom, and nor shall I ignore any unforseen d=\r\nanger.&quot;\n\nRat Trap quickly leaps up onto Tucson&#39;s leg and embraces him in ra=\r\nt form.\n\n&quot; Please, I almost lost ya once, I don&#39;t wanna lose ya again.&quot;\n\nTu=\r\ncson could understand where Rat Trap was comming from, and instead of brush=\r\ning him off, which he would never do, he returns the embrace.\n\n&quot; You won&#39;t,=\r\n I promise you.  All I ask in return is that you continue the faith.  For t=\r\nhat is power that not even Cyclonus has, and it&#39;s that power which will see=\r\n all of us through, even myself.&quot;\n\nWith a tear, Rat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;You got i=\r\nt Wheels, I&#39;ll never lose faith, ever.&quot;\n\nTucson then turns to Lord Elder.\n\n=\r\n&quot; As with Talon, I&#39;d like you to join me as well, Lord Elder.  Hydras has d=\r\none you great wrong and I&#39;d like you to be there to see the tables turn, pl=\r\nus, the more help we have, the better off we are. Now, as Optimus would say=\r\n, TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nights=\r\ntar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;i do&quot;said the male&quot;I have to=\r\n do amends of my behavior... &quot; and looking to \n&gt; Rodimus said&quot;I acted like =\r\nchild and when I,... i tried to create some \n&gt; trouble among you and Nightl=\r\night... and create you some troubles with \n&gt; Hydras...

He looked around at =\r\nthe others, his\n&gt; optics flashing as he contained his own internal anger. &quot;=\r\nHydras has\n&gt; long used this method of control to create his troops from the=\r\n ashes\n&gt; of Maximal protoforms.&quot; His voice deep and controlled. &quot;He must be=\r\n\n&gt; stopped.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Walking more or less to the middle of the room he turned =\r\nto face the\n&gt; others, &quot;There is little doubt that Hydras has spent at least=\r\n some of\n&gt; this time shoring up his base against the same methods that we u=\r\nsed to\n&gt; enter before.&quot; Rodimus frowned, &quot;and Cyclonus is a force to be\n&gt; r=\r\neckoned with as well.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning his head to look at Tuscon Rodimus cont=\r\ninued, &quot;Like you he has\n&gt; felt the power of the Matrix and has been forever=\r\n changed by it, but\n&gt; in his case it has been corrupted, a dark twisted ver=\r\nsion of it.&quot;\n&gt; Rodimus clenched his fist, &quot;But do not mistake it for a mome=\r\nnt that\n&gt; his wisdom and cunning are greater than they had been before - he=\r\n\n&gt; knows much more than he reveals.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheetor crossed his arms over his=\r\n chest, &quot;Power or no power, we will\n&gt; blast him back to Cybertron!&quot; he said=\r\n, his voice exuding that\n&gt; exuberant confidence that was ever his trademark=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus smiled, &quot;Good, we will need that spirit soon.&quot; He turned to\n=\r\n&gt; look at the others, &quot;But first we need a concrete plan of action, to\n&gt; be=\r\n sure that we all act together.&quot; He looked around, &quot;Is anyone\n&gt; keeping wat=\r\nch on Hydras&#39; base?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
