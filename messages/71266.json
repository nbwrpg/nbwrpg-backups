She had not known what really\n&gt; happened, and at =\r\nthe time it did happen she had not yet been a part of the\n&gt; Autobot Faction=\r\n.  She stands thoughtfully for a moment, now taking in what\n&gt; she had been =\r\nmissing for a long time.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wow, that part I never did understand..  Tha=\r\nt sure explains things. I&#39;m\n&gt; glad I did talk to you, Legacy.  So by doing =\r\nwhat he did, Starscream saved\n&gt; our faction...  I&#39;ve only heard bits&#39;n piec=\r\nes about Starscream&#39;s\n&gt; relationship with Megatron, and from what I learned=\r\n, they never did see eye\n&gt; to eye. Anyway, thanks for the explanation and t=\r\nhe video feed, it was really\n&gt; useful. I better let ya get ta the bridge no=\r\nw.

Although most of the Max=\r\nimals and Autobots were about the\nsame size, there was something about the =\r\nFuzors that just emanated\nsize, especially with ones like TORCA and NOCTORR=\r\nO.\n\n=93We will soon be sharing this with the rest of the crew, but we have\n=\r\nwords with Lord Elder first.=94 TORCA=92s words were deep and yet\npowerful,=\r\n his voice managing to almost echo in the hall they were\nwalking through.\n\n=\r\nNOCTORRO looked up at TORCA, =93Legacy will be joining us there too.=94\n\nEL=\r\nDER glanced between the two, clearly not understanding either, =93If\nLegacy=\r\n is coming, why not the rest?=94\n\nTORCA just shook his head. =93When Tuscon=\r\n is finished with his . . .=94\nTORCA shrugged not quite how to put it, =93.=\r\n . . affairs and Rodimus is\nfinished with his wife we will assemble everyon=\r\ne.

Perhaps that is\nsom=\r\nething we will have to work out.=94\n\nHe glanced up at TORCA and NOCTORRO, n=\r\neither of whom said anything.\n\nGlancing back at PERCEPTOR he smiled hopeful=\r\nly, =93and perhaps Perceptor\nwill have a few ideas as well. It would go a l=\r\nong way in settling some\nof the trust issues that some of the Maximals may =\r\nstill have.=94\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;we willbe ready fot that&quot;replied Perceptor&quot;and=\r\n we will have to start to\n&gt; work&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD\n&gt;\n&gt; Uproar smiles to Perceptor.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &quot;Count me in Perceptor.
