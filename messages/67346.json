I like\nto catch it all, but there are a lot of details. I apologize in\nadvance.\n\nBIC:\n\nThe air is becoming positively filled with the acrid smell of laser\nfire and the bite of acid. The skies above are still thick with sweeps,\nbut for those keeping count, the number of them is beginning to\ndiminish. Whatever the various defenders are doing it is beginning to\ntake its toll on the minions. But so far their onslaught continues\nwithout let up!\n\nSweeps around the base continue a holding pattern above and beyond the\ndoor, either out of range or the field of view of the door�s cannons\nand defenders. They continue concentrating firepower around the base,\ntheir heavy lasers and disintegration beams bathing its shields in\nscintillating colors. Blasts from Guardia and the gate guards continue\nto keep the sweeps at bay, and even succeed in bringing down a few. As\na result the sweeps redouble thier efforts to stay out of the direct\nline of fire and attempt to harass anyone trying to leave through the\ndoors. (OOC: No the sweeps are not at the doors, but anyone trying to\ncome out may have to face their firepower from an oblique angle. The\nsweeps may not be able to totally block the door, but they can make\nexits difficult. IE: people should be able to leave, but should pose\nhaving to dodge cannon fire and such) \n\nAs for Salveo, his scans for any other minions other than the ones in\nthe air, or otherwise already accounted for come up negative. However\nas far as most of his sensors are concerned the sweeps are not there,\nonly infrared picks up a slight vapor trail from their exhaust when\nthey engage engines in heavy thrust, or visual cameras as they pan over\ntheir fields of view. \n\nSomewhat nearby:\n\nSeveral sweeps go up in an amazing blast of fire and pyrotechnics as\nLord Perseus&#39; long black rifle lights into the air. Several charred and\nsmoking frames fall from the skies and hit the streets below! For the\nrest of the sweeps the reaction is swift as they swing away from the\nfortifications for a moment and circle around trying to find an\nopening. For the moment Perseus� immediate area is free, however the\nwalls of his fortification still rumble and debris continue to fall\naround him as laser fire targets his location from sides he cannot yet\ndefend! \n\nIn the air above:\n\nCyclonus turned away from Ravenchief�s as the Maximal fell away from\nhim, the expression on his face giving no hint to his inner thoughts.\nInstead he turns his attention to his true prey ...   \n\nOn the streets below:\n \nAs Ravenchief pulls himself out of his fall and swings up, two sweeps\nmove in his direction led by a slightly larger one. �Ahhhh, so we meet\nagain. I have come to return the favor!� Laughter rings out as laser\nfire opens up from Scourge and soon enough from the sweeps beside him.\n(OOC: I know Windlord is in route, but not sure how close he is)\nNear the waters:\n\nAt the water below:\n\nBelow near the water the combined firepower of Kup, Doc and Rodimus\nPrime are enough to finish off the few remaining sweeps that menace\nthem. Sending several smoking and charred wrecks to a wet grave beneath\nthe ocean waves. \n\nHowever their respite is short indeed as Cyclonus and nearly a half a\ndozen sweeps move over the railing floating down to the waterfront,\nperhaps the very sweeps that scattered to avoid Cyclonus� earlier\nmissile attack have returned. Now they circled Cyclonus, like air bourn\nlions waiting for the command to attack! \n\nCyclonus looks down, and with a gesture from him the Sweeps swirled\nforward, their cannons lashing out at Doc and Kup, even as Cyclonus\ncontinued is decent. \n\n�Rodimus Prime!� The old timber of Cyclonus� voice resonated against\nthe cliff walls. �You have only one choice ahead of you now.� \n\nPerhaps this is the same Cyclonus of old, perhaps not, but as he\ndescended, the very power he radiated showed something there was\nsomething newa bout him. This is NOT the Cyclonus that served under\nGalvatron. The reformat he and Scourge had undergone changed them\nsomehow, and it is as if Cyclonus has been fully unleashed, and finally\nbrought to his fullest potential. \n\nHis voice deepened as he continued, �You will give me the Matrix now,\nor I will lay waste to you and this entire city and take it from your\nsmoking frame!�\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
