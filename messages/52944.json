His presence was a nuisance to our goals and threatened to\nawaken the Predacons&#39; sensibility to the Tripredacus manipulation that\nwas going on. I departed along with my crew and followed the stolen\nmaximal freighter to here, prehistoric earth. We fought mostly against\nthe Predacons, but Megatron was not killed or captured. However, he\nmerged with Galvatron and became Hydras. This caused dissidence\namongst predacon troops. When you arrived insystem and contacted me,\nwe had allied with the Maximals and the dissident Predacons in order\nto bring down Hydras. Although we fended off the attack with no loss\nin personel, our ship was destroyed by a very powerful attack. The\nstasis pods that were contained in it were sent away, some here and\nothers elsewhere on the planet, and special data has been retrieved\nbefore the destruction was complete. \n\nHe turned to Blackheart.\n\nTyrael: Before making any recommendations, General, I would like to\nknow your objectives here and the situation on Cybertron.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; Blackheart nodded. &quot;Very well you go first.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
