I don&#39;t like this.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He drops a com link to Leo Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Nightshift ta Leo, over.  I got some strange feelings that we got an\n&gt; intruder on the grounds.

Even her scent was minimized in it&#39;s own way.\n&gt; But, BLACKARACHNIA, hanging above on the ceiling, stayed still.

He didn&#39;t appear to be\nalerted or alarmed by anything.\n\nHe looked up and over at NIGHTSHIFT as he angled his ears forward and\nthen nodded at him. He couldn&#39;t smell anything but he would be happy\nto help in the search.\n\n&quot;Always happy to help.&quot; WOLFGANG said, &quot;What have you got?&quot; He began\nto walk over.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
