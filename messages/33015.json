He didnt care that they were \ntaller (it&#39;s not a big deal guys). He snarled, then grimaced. He then \ntook a few breaths and calmed down. &quot;No, you followed orders Autofire, \nand for that I commend you,&quot;. He then quickly snarled, &quot;but when I \nwant your opinion Fireblade, I&#39;LL GIVE IT TO YOU&quot; he yelled as he sent \na flailing backhand towards the taller robot. With Megatron&#39;s \nstrength, it didnt matter how tall the robot was. \n\n\n\n"}}
