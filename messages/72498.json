He points to them.\n&gt;\n&gt; There , I will need those weapons, and that&#39;s it.  They were confiscacted\n&gt; from me when I was brought here.  &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gives a careful listen to everything around him and then turns his\n&gt; attentions back to his comrades.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;  Remember, please leave Rodimus up to me, and be sure you escape safely.\n&gt; He&#39;s my responsibility, and I have to deal with him myself.  I trust he is\n&gt; well trained but perhaps not as in depth as I was.  He will cheat in ways\n&gt; you may find unfathomable.  I have prepared for the unexpected and know how\n&gt; to confront it.

The\nlevel we cam in on would be about 12 to 15 above and in that\ndirection.&quot; He pointed back behind where TUSCON and CONVOY were\nstanding.\n\n&quot;Good.&quot; CONVOY said as he turned to look in that direction. &quot;Then we\nhad best get a . . .&quot;\n\n&quot;SHHHH&quot; NIGHT VIPER said as he pinned himself against a wall, the\nothers following suit, more out of reflex.\n\nCONVOY looked over at VIPER, &quot;What is it he whispered.&quot;\n\n&quot;It looks like old scaley . . . I mean Tuscon Prime over there may ah\nheard somethin&#39; after all.&quot; VIPER said as he looked down the hall.\n\nIn the distance  a small troop of six guards, looking very much\nsharkticons were marching down the hall towards them. It seemed that\nfor them moment they had not spotted the Maximals, but it was only a\nmatter of time before they would.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
