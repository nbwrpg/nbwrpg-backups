Just \n&gt; like my old modem!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Aw, dang it!&quot; Quickstrike turned around and looked at the vent \nface. He \n&gt; walked up to the wall. He attempted to jump up into the vent, but \nhe was too \n&gt; short to reach it. He tried two more times, but with no avail.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Beast mode.&quot; Quickstrike transformed to beast mode and climbed up \nthe wall, \n&gt; into the air shaft. He crawled around inside it, and called, &quot;Dark \nMouse. \n&gt; Dark Mouse? Where are ya rodent?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ah, a good logical bot.&quot; he said. He stood up. &quot;I belive it&#39;s time \nfor us \n&gt; to return their glory. It doesn&#39;t make sense for fellow Predacons \nto fight \n&gt; amoung themselves while we can put out energies into fighting the \nMaximals \n&gt; and even the Alliance. A Predacon uses team work. What you need is \nan \n&gt; experienced leader like myself.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
