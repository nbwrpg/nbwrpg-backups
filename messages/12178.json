But she had known his name, looking over his file while her memory tapped into the main systems.\nShe walked back over to him, having seen Feline walk into the next room as she had asked.\nIron Raptor looked at Chardate more closely then she had before, wondering of she had missed anything else other \nShe gave him a tired but warm smile, making her seem as if she had been at this command forever. Her stance confident and experienced as it ever was.\nBut everything was happening all at once and she could only handle one thing at a time, feeling tired at the mere thought of all that she had to do before she collapsed onto a bed and slept. And at the moment, she felt as if she could sleep for a week!\nIron Raptor�s optics warmed as she looked at Chardate, not failing to notice the kiss that Feline had given him before entering into the next room.\nCausing her to develop an ache deep inside, remembering the way the Prowl kissed her and wanting him there like she never had before.\nBut she had things to do, and it almost made her wish that she could throw the responsibilities of command in someone else�s face and just go back to being a normal field soldier. But that was impossible, she had her duties and she wasn�t about to fail them.\nHer voice was light-hearted but had that commanding edge to it. *\n\n� I�m sorry for not introducing myself earlier, Chardate. But I was a bit busy, as you saw. �\n\n* She cleared her throat and smiled again, her features softening just long enough to become kind. Holding out her hand towards Chardate for him to shake a common greeting. *\n\n� I am Iron Raptor, current Maximal Commander. Pleased to meet you, Chardate. I�m sure.�\n\n(I�m not sure if Adrax has already pulled the beam below the Ark; I�m a bit tired. If he has then just dismiss this bit of the post. Thank you.)\n\n* The programs of the Ark began to sputter, already most of them had gone offline. Iris had done all she could so save this ship, keeping one computer console online and under guard in a small shield. If she could keep this one operational then she would have access to the weapons, the only systems run off of this console.\nBut her annoyance grew with every shake of the Ark, more of it falling apart by the second.\nBut there was one little thing that she noticed somebot was tampering with the support beams of the great Autobot ship. The front. And if that gave way then the entire base would rip in half.\nIris ran through the defense systems and found a few external guns on the bottom of the ship, also an air vent.\nThe ships systems were over heating and turning the intaced quarters into steam filled ovens, a plan forming in her mind as she activated the external guns.\nIris quickly turned the guns as well as the remainder of the ship under her power, three external guns dropping from the bottom of the ship and every one of them targeting Adrax�s signature. The Air vent opening just above his head.\nShe had swamped out the main computer system; the entire ship now running off of her own programmed systems and power. And even though she seemed nothing more then an advanced computer systems, she was much, much more. A powerhouse for one.\nHer voice was deep with a metallic rung as it rocked through the entire ship, almost seeming as if the very base was alive. *\n\n� Step away from the support, Slag pile.�\n\n* That was her warning, but she wasn�t about to give this thing a chance to crack the beam and then get away.\nWith a sudden roar of straining systems the guns began to fire, each carefully aimed so that it would be the enemy the charges his and not the beam.\nAnd with a whoosh of air searing steam poured out of the vent above Adrax�s head, routed from the cooking quarters.\nThere were enough supports to hold the ship if this one gave way, but it would weaken the structure further and that was the last thing she wanted.\nThis bastard bot would know what it was like to piss off a comp program with a mind of it�s own!!*\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
