He ducks, \n&gt; and prepares for his attack, fully aware that he was\n&gt; still damaged \n&gt; from the previous battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; His weapons armed, he pops up from the wing, and\n&gt; fires two plasma \n&gt; blasts and a rocket at Tryrael. Then he prepares to\n&gt; change location.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Switchblade.&quot; Megatron says through a comm, &quot;Found\n&gt; anything yet?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade grimaces then replies, &quot;Uhh, I found\n&gt; something in a \n&gt; box... it was trapped with an older model false\n&gt; top/explode-in-your-\n&gt; face style trap. I managed to disarm it... the hard\n&gt; way, and I&#39;m a \n&gt; bit damaged now. There appears to be a piece of...\n&gt; something anyway.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade picks up the artifact, and takes a\n&gt; closer look at \n&gt; it. &quot;Hmm, it almost looks like a small cube, which\n&gt; is the corner of \n&gt; a larger cube of some sort. There also appears to be\n&gt; writing on it, \n&gt; possibly Vok, but I can&#39;t tell. There are also three\n&gt; small \n&gt; miscoloured squares in the center of three of the\n&gt; sides of it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He takes a look around the room, and spots three\n&gt; more sealed \n&gt; containers, identical to the one he&#39;d grabbed the\n&gt; oddly shaped cube \n&gt; out of.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hold on, I&#39;m checking out three more containers\n&gt; which are seemingly \n&gt; identical to the one which had this.. thing in it.&quot;\n&gt; Mumbles \n&gt; Switchblade into the comm and he heads over to the\n&gt; next sealed \n&gt; container, his intrest smothering the pain of his\n&gt; damages, and also \n&gt; the fact that Megatron was in the middle of a\n&gt; battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael: I see you have come Megatron. Now come.\n&gt; You will learn why \n&gt; &gt; they call me the Blue Firestorm!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He showered his enemy with a rain of light bolts,\n&gt; no bigger than \n&gt; &gt; needles.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
