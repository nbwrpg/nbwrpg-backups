I \ndon&#39;t really want to be in here for long. It&#39;s cramped in here.&quot;\n\nShe walked over to Veratis, as she walked, she changed into full \npolar bear mode. She put her huge head just over Veratis&#39; shouler. \n&quot;What are you looking at?&quot; She nudges his shoulder slightly. \n&quot;I can hear Lunarpine. He&#39;s not happy. He thinks that with my new \nform, I won&#39;t like him anymore. Can you talk to him for me Veratis. \ntell him that it&#39;s not the form that counts, but what&#39;s inside. I \ndidn&#39;t realize that earlier, but I know it now. Tell him that I care \nfor what&#39;s inside him, not his outer form.&quot;\n\nShe hoped that Veratis could tell Lunarpine and talk to him so he \nwould understand. &quot;Please Veratis? Will you talk to him?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis heard Ive&#39;s thoughts again. he reached out to open a comm \nand\n&gt; decided why bother. He thought back to her, &quot;We have a bot on board \nthat\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have the immunities that we do. I&#39;ll have to keep you in \nthe lab.&quot;\n&gt; He studied the Dna strand by strand. &quot;It would appear that your \nhalfling\n&gt; mode manifested itself to help you adapt. I&#39;m not sure as of yet \nwhether or\n&gt; not it&#39;s permanent.&quot; he looked carefully trying not to miss a \nsingle detail.\n&gt; &quot;Note to self, Inconsistencies in the IceBird form seem to be \nchangeing, I\n&gt; have yet to determine in what way but they are deffinitely \ndifferent.&quot; he\n&gt; recorded his notes delecately trying not to mince his words..\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine walked around the ship as if it were a second home. He \nwas still\n&gt; worrying about Ice. He feared that once she learned some control \nshe&#39;d\n&gt; consider him obsolete. He was no longer the sleek new model he \nthought he\n&gt; was. She was the newest breed of thier kind. He couldn&#39;t stop \nthinking about\n&gt; what a mutant transformer would see in such a pathetic form like he \nhad.\n&gt; \n&gt; Foxfingers crossed the hall to check the situation, Nothing seemed \nto have\n&gt; changed. He saw Lunarpine wandering. &quot;Problems?&quot; he asked more for \nthe sake\n&gt; of conversation than concern.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Let me guess Foxfingers right?&quot; Lunarpine had read up on Veratis&#39; \nteam. He\n&gt; knew not to turn his back on the young bot before him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ya and you&#39;re Lunarpine, I&#39;ve had time to read up on you too.&quot; He \nwas a\n&gt; cocky little runt compared to Lunarpine but his attitude made him \nfeal\n&gt; twenty feet tall. &quot;I&#39;m not impressed. That other wolf I encountered \nputs you\n&gt; to shame. At least she showed a little interest.&quot; The fox was \npushing\n&gt; Lunarpines buttons and they both knew it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Slayer?&quot; he thought concerning himself with his failure to beat \nhis former\n&gt; teamate. &quot;No he said She.&quot; the news hit him like a brick. There was \nat least\n&gt; four wolves in this war. He no longer fealt the need for a pack, he \nnow knew\n&gt; that there were others like him.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 15, 2000 7:08 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: The next evolution of technology.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even in her sleep, she heard Lunarpine. She was dreaming of \nsparring\n&gt; &gt; with him as in the old days. She smiled. In her dream, he stood up\n&gt; &gt; and said to her, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid Wing. I didn&#39;t risk spark and \nlimb\n&gt; &gt; to save you just to see you brought down by a flu bug, we&#39;ll get \nyou\n&gt; &gt; through this I promise.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but smile.  She knew \nthat\n&gt; &gt; he meant it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She awoke a little while later. She yawned and stretched and stood\n&gt; &gt; up. She looked around the lab and wondered where she was allowed \nto\n&gt; &gt; go in the base. She hoped she would ba able to find something to \ndo.\n&gt; &gt; Being a big bear cooped up in one room for days on end was not her\n&gt; &gt; idea of fun. She looked around and thought to Veratis, &quot;What am I \nto\n&gt; &gt; do now? What will happen with these new modes that I have?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She felt a tickle in her nose and she sneezed. But in doing so, \nshe\n&gt; &gt; changed from polar bear into her halfling form.  She looked up at \nher\n&gt; &gt; wings and sighed. &quot;This is going to drive me bonkers. What good is\n&gt; &gt; this half form going to accomplish, other than instill fear into\n&gt; &gt; other for not knowing what I am.&quot; Then the thought entered her \nmind.\n&gt; &gt; She had three forms. No one but they knew this. She could \napproach a\n&gt; &gt; bot in one form and attack in another. She could also get cought \nor\n&gt; &gt; captured in one form and then use another form to escape. She was\n&gt; &gt; finally seeing the possabilities of her new body. She smiled and\n&gt; &gt; chuckled to herself. &quot;Oh wouldn&#39;t those preds get a big suprize if\n&gt; &gt; they ever saw me again.&quot; she chuckled. She almost wanted to go \ninto\n&gt; &gt; battle, just to see thier reaction to her changing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Veratis spoke openly to Lunarpine as if Ice weren&#39;t there. There\n&gt; &gt; was no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sense trying to hide anything from her. He knew that her \ntelepathic\n&gt; &gt; powers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weren&#39;t in her control. &quot;We have to find a way to control this.\n&gt; &gt; Right now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she&#39;s on the verge of either insanity or corruption.&quot; He feared \nfor\n&gt; &gt; her if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she ever deciced to use this power improperly. &quot;I&#39;ll work with \nher\n&gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;ll have to help too.&quot; He turned back to Ice. &quot;Rest for now\n&gt; &gt; young one,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you have alot of hard work ahead of you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine watched as Ice fell asleep. He could still hear her \nvoice\n&gt; &gt; rambling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on in a tired, half asleep dilogue. He moved closer to her and\n&gt; &gt; placed a hand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on her head. &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid Wing. I didn&#39;t risk spark and \nlimb to\n&gt; &gt; save you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just to see you brought down by a flu bug, we&#39;ll get you through\n&gt; &gt; this I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; promise.&quot; He started out the door but felt the urge to stop. He\n&gt; &gt; turned back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as if to say something. &quot;Just wait till our next match, we&#39;ll \nsee\n&gt; &gt; just what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your new form can do.&quot; He knew ?Veratis could only hear his\n&gt; &gt; thoughts if Ice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; broadcast them to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
