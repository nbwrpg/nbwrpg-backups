He let out a squeal, and bolted. He scrambled on his feet, nearly\n&gt; loosing his balance. Having over-grown feet weren&#39;t helping in dodging\n&gt; things. The missiles went past him, one nearly hitting his back. They\n&gt; slammed into the wall, making a fair hole in the wall.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike winced, staring at the Predacons. &quot;Hey!

Mabey Hell Beast and Zardus didnt want to join\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Newcomers, but Megatron did. They had a plan, a motive, and minions to\n&gt; &gt;get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the job done.
