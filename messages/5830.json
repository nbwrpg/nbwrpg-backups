The only thing that could come from it would be an \nargument. He looked at his arm, she got him pretty good, but his \ninternal repairs would handle the damage. Right now all he wanted to \ndo was rest. He entered the base and went to his quarters to rest. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She flew back to the base after she calmed down.   She knew that \nshe was no \n&gt; fighter.  She felt dissapointed in herself.  She thought she could \nmake him \n&gt; think that she could make it.  But she failed herself as well as \nhim.  She \n&gt; knew he was a fighter, a better hunter.  He would survive.  She \ntransformed \n&gt; into her bot mode.  She lifted her head, swallowed her spark, and \nwalked in. \n&gt;   She saw Lunarpine out of the corner of her eye.  She didn&#39;t turn \nto face \n&gt; him, she just kept walking.  She knew her emotions were her \nweakness.  But \n&gt; she couldn&#39;t help it.  Her spark was as big as the rest of her. \nNormally she \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t mind, but now, she hated that fact.  She just walked to \nher room \n&gt; and sat on her bed.  She leaned forward, rested her head in her \nhands and \n&gt; started to cry again.  She hated and liked him at the same time.  \nAnd now \n&gt; she couldn&#39;t even look at him.  She wanted to rip out her spark. \nShe just \n&gt; sat there and let her spark burn.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---original message----\n&gt; From:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wed Jul 5, 2000 10:44pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine could see her pain, Shadow Wing wasn&#39;t programmed as a\n&gt; warrior. He saw that now, he fealt for her but knew that a wolf and\n&gt; an owl weren&#39;t meant to work together, were they? He turned back to\n&gt; the crow and gobbled it up. In his world scavenging food was just as\n&gt; important as hunting it. Shadow Wing was a good hunter as an owl but\n&gt; she didn&#39;t seam to realize that she was more. she has the ability to\n&gt; change into something that gives her an edge yo the hunt. If she\n&gt; could learn that, she might survive. In the cold he&#39;d want her at \nhis\n&gt; side, but he still wasn&#39;t sure how she&#39;d fight in this climate. Her\n&gt; emotions were her weakness. One moment she wanted the hunt, the \nkill,\n&gt; the next moment she wanted to run away and hide.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; he said more to himself than to her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I had \nto\n&gt; do that to help you survive.&quot;\n&gt; Lunarpine wiped his mouth and headed back to base, alone again.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
