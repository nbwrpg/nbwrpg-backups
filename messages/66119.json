O=\r\nut of the corner of his eye, he could see \nTrelos, now\n&gt; fully awake and in=\r\n beast mode, pacing back and forth in his cell.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ok, you can close the=\r\n cell.&quot; he said to the Trooper who was \nmanning the\n&gt; security console.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The cell bars came down from the ceiling quickly and without a \nsound, th=\r\nen\n&gt; the forcefield turned on.  It glowed with a dull blue-green color.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; There was a partition door which could be closed in case of \nemergency so=\r\n the\n&gt; prisoners wouldn&#39;t be able to harm eachother.  Perseus stepped \nthro=\r\nugh that\n&gt; door frame and glanced at it casually for a second before turnin=\r\ng \nto face\n&gt; Trelos.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So, why did you do it?&quot; he asked Trelos. &quot;Why di=\r\nd innocent people \nneed to\n&gt; die?  You were after us, right?  What purpose =\r\ndid that serve?  What \ngave you\n&gt; the right to do that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Trelos stared=\r\n at Perseus with animal-like eyes and didn&#39;t say a \nword.  He\n&gt; now continu=\r\ned pacing slower, keeping his gaze fixed on his enemy on \nthe\n&gt; other side =\r\nof the forcefield.\n\n\n\n"}}
