If what he said \nwas true, then what could this group offer her? She wondered what \ncould they give her for what she could offer them? She knew that she \nhad all the codes and information from the Cybertronian Predacon \nCouncil.  But what could they give her? The only thing she could \nthink of was a safe place to stay untill she could figure out \nsomething. For now, what safety they offered was needed. She looked \nat Devilduer. She noticed from his actions, he was a seasoned \nwarrior. ANd if the others were anything like him, they could give \nher the protection she needed. She wondered if they would ever think \nto ask about what she knew. Then she wondered just how much she would \ntell them.\n\n\n"}}
