If I read correctly, the one and only KSLawdogg has returned!  Welcome back, KSL.  I also noticed that your still as self-centered as ever.  I&#39;m not going to do a long rant, so I&#39;ll cut to the chase.  It&#39;s simple, you see.  Things are not like they were before.  You and others can laugh all you want, as we KNOW you think this is an over-rated joke, but I just wanted to let you know that you are no longer a player here, and you are belittled by the nWo and some non-nWo&#39;ites out there.  I expect somebody to reply either a long, boring post against this or insulting the me or the nWo, or else a short, boring post doing the same.
