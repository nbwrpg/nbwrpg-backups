He turned back to\nthe panel he stood in front of and began to program into it a series\nof instructions.\n\n&quot;This should not involve a major alteration of your structure, but I\nwill be installing several skill sets that should involve your battle\nprowess as well as your tactical knowledge.&quot; he turned back to look at\nher, &quot;We have had several . . . um . . additions that we can use.&quot;\n\nHe smiled as he turned back to the panel. As he worked a door opened\nand Dirge walked through and he looked over at Lamia and then at\nMarauder. &quot;Sir, the Insectors have their orders and are preparing now\nfor the next stage in the plan.&quot;\n\nMaurader nodded and then glanced up at Dirge, &quot;Good.&quot; he said as he\nstraightened. &quot;I have programmed several changes that will be made to\nLamia.&quot; he said gesturing at the female that stood at his side.\n&quot;Prepare the reformatting chamber.&quot;\n\nDirge glanced at Lamia, his face curious and perhaps a bit annoyed. He\nwas about to day something, but a subtle shake of the head from\nMarauder forestalled it. Instead he just turned back to Lamia.\n\n&quot;This way.&quot; Dirge said to Lamia as he gestured to another door that\nslid open in the wall. The interior of that room glowed slightly as\nenergies coursed through it. In the center of the room was a pod that\nwas laid back like a bed.\n\nDirge glanced back at Lamia, &quot;Lay here.&quot; he said shortly, gesturing at\nthe pod bed.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
