Celeron felt stupid that\nhe fallen for such a simple illusion.  Now he had no idea where he\nwas, so he just picked a random direction and started walking,\nrunning, and flying.  Taking quick breaks when needed.\n\nAfter about 4 hours of random wandering, making sure that he was\nheading in the same direction and not in circles.  He detected a large\nmetal mass on the horizon and decided to alter course to see what it\nwas.  Upon further inspection he found that it was a medium-sized\ncrashed ship.  It was nothing like that prision ship monstrousity that\nhe had been involved with before.  He wasn&#39;t even sure how long ago\nthat was, or how he got here.  He could be right near the prision\nship, or this place could be on the other side of the planet.\n\nHis adventerous obcession kicked in, and thinking he could find some\nuseful parts, or even some information he located a hatch, opened it\nand began an organized search of the first areas he came to.\n\nOn Sun, 3 Oct 2004 22:57:58 -0700, Alex Sell &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Approximately 4 hours later, Celeron had pushed himself out so that\n&gt; everything below his waist was above ground.
