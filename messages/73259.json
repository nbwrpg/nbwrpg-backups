He then looks down to Rodimus and gets beside him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; F=\r\nor once, I agree with you.  We may not always see eye to eye but it\n&gt; doesn=\r\n&#39;t mean I don&#39;t respect who you are.  Now, our only hope to escape this\n&gt; t=\r\nhreat is to relocate all together.  We must return to the Ark and see if we=\r\n\n&gt; can get it flying just enough to relocate its position.  Before I became=\r\n a\n&gt; warrior, I did extensive work in mechanical and weaponry restoration. =\r\n I\n&gt; haven&#39;t lost sight of those skills. I can attempt to restore the essen=\r\ntial\n&gt; components for transport, and worry about the rest at a later time. =\r\n Of\n&gt; course I will need a bit of help from anyone with engineering as thei=\r\nr\n&gt; background, which I believe Stanton and Bump, along with Legacy, could =\r\nbe a\n&gt; big help.

He looks dow=\r\nn.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; Sorry, slight miscalculation, won&#39;t happen again.  I thought t=\r\nhe clouds\n&gt;&gt;&gt; held water but they don&#39;t .  If I knew there was water I coul=\r\nd stop the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ash\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and fire.  I must try to climb higher, beyond the sm=\r\noke cover.

Ash rains down on his wings\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and =\r\nback yet he ignores the sting and burn of their impact.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A=\r\ns TUSCON tried to fly over and protect RODIMUS it is quickly evident\n&gt;&gt; tha=\r\nt RODIMUS was much larger than he had been before! He was no\n&gt;&gt; ordinary sp=\r\narrow or hawk but he was a giant phoenix with flamed\n&gt;&gt; slowing off of his =\r\nwings and entire frame like a bonfire. Only his\n&gt;&gt; claws where he held the =\r\nsmaller form of NIGHTLIGHT was cool and dark.\n&gt;&gt; Also the soot and debris t=\r\nhat were falling seemed to be doing little\n&gt;&gt; to RODIMUS as they quickly tu=\r\nrned to ash and char when his flames hit\n&gt;&gt; them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; They both were flyi=\r\nng above and yet away from the Volcano.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =93I do not think a simple ra=\r\nin will stop this volcano.=94 RODIMUS said\n&gt;&gt; his voice somehow wiser and d=\r\neeper than it had been before. =93It is\n&gt;&gt; purging itself of a dark menace.=\r\n=94\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as RODIMUS spoke dark magma began to flow from the mountain.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =93Come, we must get the rest of the Maximals to safety.=94 RODIMUS =\r\nflew\n&gt;&gt; towards the others as the skies continued to darken and the ground\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; began to turn black as it rained ash and fire. &quot;We can do nothing but\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n try to heal and get everyone away from here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With the ash falling a=\r\nnd small burning bits of fire and brimstone,\n&gt;&gt; plus the Magma flows this a=\r\nrea will be dangerous until the volcano\n&gt;&gt; fueled storm abates. Smoke was b=\r\negining to rise from the ground as\n&gt;&gt; burning trees fell and burned.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nOOC: To anyone using sensors or communications it is possible but\n&gt;&gt; spotty=\r\n. The ash still seems to have at least some of the properties of\n&gt;&gt; the int=\r\nerior of the Volcano and the distortion field that was up\n&gt;&gt; previously. IE=\r\n: Sensors and radios work, but distance is shorter. It&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; like trying see=\r\n through a heavy driving rain.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
