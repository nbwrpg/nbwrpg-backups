This is \nwhat has changed:\n\n--- Mmembers can vote in polls; Moderators can create/modify/vote in \npolls.\n\nIf you want a poll to be made, simply email the question and the \npossible choices to me (x_rauq_x@...) or to one of the other \nmoderators.\n\nWe decided to restrict polling due to the recent number of \ninflammatory polls. So those who wish to create a poll must first \nsubmit it to the council for editing.\n\n     Second thing,\n\nHugar has been far too incactive for the past while (just about 2 \nmonths actually) so he has lost his moderator abilities. To replace \nHugar, Azure now officially a moderator. We chose not to have a vote \nto decide this because there aren&#39;t really enough people to vote \naccurately, thus making a moderator based decision perferable. In \nsimpler terms, listen to what Azure says, and we&#39;ll all get along \nfine. =P\n\nQuestions or further comments can be emailed to me.\n\n\n"}}
