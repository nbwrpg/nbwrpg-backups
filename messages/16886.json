She hugged herself \n&gt; while \n&gt; &gt; sitting in the corner.  She wondered why she even gave a care \nabout \n&gt; &gt; Striker.  But she knew that he was gone forever.  She remembered \n&gt; &gt; talking to Prebon and giving herself up for Striker&#39;s release \n&gt; without \n&gt; &gt; a chip.

She slowly got up to her feet and walked over the door \nway \n&gt; &gt; and watched Prebon and Slayer. She smiled and knew that is was \nnow \n&gt; &gt; her place to serve Prebon and to make him happy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She walked down and went to Prebon.
