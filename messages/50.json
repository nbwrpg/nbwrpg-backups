Now look what you&#39;ve done!!!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor stood back and straightened her stance, it was time to test \nout her Second Beast Mode! She knew that it was a huge waste of energy but \nPlintissa and her couldn&#39;t beat Rampage like this.*\n\n&quot; Second Beast Mode!!!&quot;\n\n* Within seconds she had transformed into a two story exoskeleton creature, \nblack as night and hard as alloy. ( Ever seen the movie Alien? Looks like \none of them except with a raptor claw on the third toe.) She came up behind \nRampage and bared her teeth, her head now 3 times bigger then his. A plate \nof bone covered her neck and half her back, vertebral spikes ran down her \nback and tail.\nIron Raptor knew that she only had roughly 5 clicks before the energy drain \nwould force her back into her normal Beast Mode and maybe even stasis lock, \nso she had to act NOW!!!\nWithin seconds she sank her 6 inch teeth into Rampage&#39;s shoulder-plate.*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
