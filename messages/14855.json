I\nalso own the first Marvel TF comics, in the North American continuity,\nand none of that happaned there either. And since the Asian cartoon\ncontinuity follows the NA/E continuity in the begining, and the Asian\nand Europian comics follow the NA continuity in the begining, I dont see\nhow any of what you said could have happaned.\n\n"}}
