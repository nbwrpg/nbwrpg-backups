He \nregains stability, seeing that the attackers were getting out of \nrange. FZ turns in the direction of the Iron Fist and takes off after \na last look around the battlefield. He needed to report to Zardus, \nand some data couldn&#39;t be downloaded through the link he had with \nZardus&#39;s mind. However, he did send some information to Zardus \npsychicly.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKillfest blocks the shots with his hands, the armor getting dented. \nHe watches Vehement depart and then picks a new target, firing two \nmissiles at Demon Wulf&#39;s back. His scanners keep track of the \nBrotherhood to see where they were heading.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDetonating the missile heading for him with one of his own, \nEndBringer spins around as the Brotherhood leaves. He roars, running \nat Flesh Ripper from behind and firing two missiles from each gun at \nhim, the missiles locking on to Flesh Ripper&#39;s signature and \nfollowing it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven jumps back, firing a missile into one of the missiles heading \nfor him. He ducks right as the first was about to hit, the missile \nmisisng and slamming into the ground. Seeing that that enemy was \nleaving, Greven turns around and fires four energy seeking missiles \nat Dark Claw.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (Thanks for reminding me, Yan, but my guys aren&#39;t hovering, they&#39;re \nall going \n&gt; full speed northeast so they&#39;re no where near the blast area of the \npuny \n&gt; weapon :p)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron/Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector/Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark \nClaw/The\n&gt; Protectobots/Shockwave:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron kept flying at top speed as did his warriors, feeling a \nsmall amount \n&gt; of his energy being drained, though every second it was being \ndrained less \n&gt; and less.  He raised an arm, launching another ES-seeking missile \nand stopped \n&gt; firing immediately after that, the ancient robot out of firing \nrange, unless \n&gt; the enemies pursued them.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement dived down in the air, avoiding the missiles but two shots \nstriking \n&gt; him.  One in an undamaged part of his robe that absorbed the blast, \nthe other \n&gt; hitting him in a gap of the material, getting past some damaged \narmor and \n&gt; deactivating some circuitry that wasn&#39;t vital.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked back, firing off ten rapid optic blasts at Killfest, \nraising an \n&gt; arm, but followed Unicron as he was out of firing range of his \nenemies.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher saw two incoming missiles fired off five rapid optic \nblasts on an \n&gt; intercept course with one of the missiles and ducked under one, not \nknowing \n&gt; it was ES-seeking, and yelled out as it exploded against his back.  \nHe \n&gt; cursed, raising an arm and launching off two energy-signature \nseeking \n&gt; missiles down at Greven, continuing at maximum speed in pursuit of \nUnicron.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector&#39;s back was to EndBringer, but his advanced scanners \ndetected four \n&gt; projectiles heading towards him and he stopped, firing off ten \nrapid optic \n&gt; blasts, only intercepting three missiles, the other getting close \nto his \n&gt; knees, the Brotherhood &#39;bot firing another optic blast, the \nexploding missile \n&gt; only three feet from him and sending a nice amount of shrapnel and \nflames \n&gt; into his abdomen and legs.  As if nothing happened, he raised a \nwrist and \n&gt; launched a single energy-signature seeking missile at EndBringer&#39;s \nsternum.\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning back around, he blasted off into the air gaining altitude \nand in \n&gt; pursuit of Unicron.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf watched the three other Protectobots arrived and the Vok \nwarrior \n&gt; growled of irritation.  Raising his sword, he fired off five rapid \noptic \n&gt; blasts at Blades&#39; left knee, taking a page out of Groove&#39;s book.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper fired off a single optic blast off at the incoming \ncharge, \n&gt; missing and letting out as the explosive went off in between his \nfeet and \n&gt; sent him in the air a few feet, crashing down onto his chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw armed the two double-barrelled laser cannons on top of \nhis current \n&gt; mode, firing bolt from each, two at Hot Spot&#39;s sternum and two at \nFirst Aid&#39;s \n&gt; left shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Spot felt two burning beams stab into his sternum, the force \nknocking him \n&gt; flat to his back, a small charred out hole in that area.  He got up \n&gt; painfully, transforming to his blue fire truck mode and driving at \n80 MPH at \n&gt; Dark Claw.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Groove got up slowly, taking out his twin cannon, arming freezing \ngases and \n&gt; started a painful jog for Flesh Ripper.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Blades rolled to the left, crashing to his shoulder in mid roll and \nthen \n&gt; getting back up to his feet, firing off three bolts from his photon \npistol at \n&gt; Demon Wulf, leaping into the air and transforming into his Apache \nmode, \n&gt; arming his cannons.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; First Aid felt two blasts burn into his shoulder, sending him into \na slight \n&gt; spin, the robot falling to a knee.  &quot;Slag it!  This isn&#39;t happening \nagain.&quot; \n&gt; he said, getting up and firing a welding laser beam at Dark Claw.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Streetwise slowly pushed himself up, but fell back down to his \nchest.  \n&gt; &quot;Shi...&quot; he coughed up some mech-fluid, transforming to his police \ncar mode \n&gt; and slowly headed for Demon Wulf, gaining speed quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave landed in biped mode behind First Aid, raising his right \nhand, \n&gt; which held a missile launcher, and fired off a rocket at the back \nof First \n&gt; Aid&#39;s pelvis.\n\n\n"}}
