I wasn&#39;t feeling too well when I wrote that.=\r\n I&#39;ve got pneumonia for the second time this year, and that was perhaps whe=\r\nn I wasn&#39;t feeling my best. My bad.\n\nOOC: Eww, oh, sorry to hear that :( I =\r\nhope you are feeling better now.\nI have had that once, it was not fun at al=\r\nl. Don&#39;t let us push you\ninto posting before you are ready. Take your time.=\r\n\n\nBIC:\n&gt; Okay, so what I got ta tell ya is I think he&#39;s plann&#39;n an all out =\r\nassault on you guys, like tryn&#39; ta take this place for the Maximals and Aut=\r\nobots. Wants ta level the fortress ta the ground. What I think we gotta do =\r\nis beat &#39;em at his own game. And he knows we&#39;re gonna try&#39;n get at the Ark,=\r\n and if we go there, we&#39;re done for. See? It&#39;s not easy gettn&#39; around the g=\r\nuy because he ain&#39;t your average scrap heap. He don&#39;t think like an average=\r\n Autobot. So, if I were you guys, that shell program you got gon&#39; on, I thi=\r\nnk ya better have a bot make a backup of that&#39;n hold onto it. Because he&#39;s =\r\ngonna try&#39;n blow this place sky high, and everything with it. And as far as=\r\n I know he&#39;ll be barrelln&#39; in here with the rest of his posse any time now.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course he was telling them a complete lie, hoping they&#39;d buy it. H=\r\nis tone shows no indication of telling a fib. Inside he was hoping that his=\r\n idea mixed with Tucson&#39;s would take hold.\n\nScorponok nodded thoughtfully a=\r\nnd attentively as Nightshift talked,\nhis optic getting a speculative hue to=\r\n them. &quot;How does Tuscon expect\nto accomplish his task?&quot; the large Predacon =\r\nasked, his voice betraying\nonly a few misgivings about Nightshift and his s=\r\ntory. &quot;The Maximals\nhave to know that this fortress can be made near impreg=\r\nnable should\nHydras command it.&quot;\n\nAs Nightshift talked of the shell program=\r\n Scorponok&#39;s musing attitude\nbecame sharp as he looked back at the mech. &quot;T=\r\nhe shell program is well\nprotected.&quot; He said, obviously his suspicions comm=\r\ning once again into\nfocus. &quot;And with all of us here, there is no way that h=\r\ne could take us\nall. He already arttempted to break in here once, and he fa=\r\niled. It\nwould be foolish for him to try again.&quot;\n\nScorponok&#39;s optics narrow=\r\n as he watched Nightshift, &quot;Unless of course\nthere is something that you ar=\r\ne holding back from us . . . &quot; Scorponok\nlet the question hang in the air a=\r\ns he waited for Nightshift&#39;s\nresponse, along with the potentially disastero=\r\nus result should\nNightshift answer wrongly.\n\n(TAG)\n\n"}}
