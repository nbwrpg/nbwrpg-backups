She got up \nonto her feet and kept up with the mental image.  She gave him the \nidea that his skin was falling off his head.  She kept the image \nstrong in his mind, but it was taxing her energy levels.

He swung his head to the side, tossing her \nout of\n&gt; the way. Suddenly he fealt something in his head, he looked down it \nappeared\n&gt; that he was falling apart. Just as he was ready to lash out in \nanger he came\n&gt; to the unproven fact that he was Megaton, indestructible leader of \nthe\n&gt; Predacons. (In his mind anyway.) He looked back in the direction \nhe&#39;d tossed\n&gt; Ice, &quot;Do yourself a favor and quit while you&#39;re alive.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine used his speed to the best of his ability and raced up \nMegatons\n&gt; back. he raised his claw to strike only to be blown away by a puff \nfrom the\n&gt; dragons nostrils. &quot;Bad dog, Stay down.&quot;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 6:58 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Ice/ New battle\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC:: thanks being easy on me here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt; She tried to dive out of the way, but the dragon got her by the\n&gt; &gt; wing.  She roared out as the teeth peirced the flesh and almost \ntore\n&gt; &gt; the wing from her shoulder.  She still swiped at him.  Then she \ntried\n&gt; &gt; another idea.  She closed her eyes, ignoring the pain, and sent \nthe\n&gt; &gt; mental image of the dragon&#39;s scales starting to fall off.  Then \nthe\n&gt; &gt; dragon&#39;s skin started to peel away. MEch fluid running fast down \nhis\n&gt; &gt; body.  It was a grusome thought, but she tried hard to make the\n&gt; &gt; dragon think it was really happening. With luck, he&#39;d gasp in fear\n&gt; &gt; and let her go.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megaton stood tall taking the shot, his thick scales prevented \nany\n&gt; &gt; major\n&gt; &gt; &gt; damage. Another shot, then another. The blows fealt like a few\n&gt; &gt; punches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of claws. The dragon was beginning to feal annoyed by \nthe\n&gt; &gt; winged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; polar bear swatting at him.
