Transforming into robot \nmode, he ripped the disk out of his chest, a squirt of blue mech-fluid \nlanding on the ground.  &quot;Slag it!&quot; he yelled, raising his grenade launcher, \nfiring off a grenade at Blender, not sure if the fool was to far away to \nshoot.\n\n---\n\nPyro cursed as he saw Stronghold go by, firing off three fire balls at \nShockaract.\n\n---\n\nHiss cursed as he got caught in autogun fire, ducking back.\n\n---\n\nScavenger fired off explosive rounds at one charge, rolling away from the \nother.  He let out a yell as the explosion&#39;s shock wave and flames sent him \nstumbling back several feet.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf fired off three optic blasts at the Mafia Base.  &quot;Brother&#39;s, bring \ntheir puny fortress to be one with the Void!&quot; he ordered.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper fired off three laser bolts at the Mafia Base.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw formed two blue orbs in his hands, throwing the explosive balls of \nenergy at the Mafia Base.  &quot;I grow weary of this pathetic battle.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do as your told!&quot; Demon Wulf yelled back with a snarl.\n\n---\n\nMinion leaped into the air, attaching as the right arm of War Machine.\n\n---\n\nChaos yelled out as autogun fire cut into his stomach, mech-fluid leaking.  \nHe jumped into the air barely able to ignore the pain, his body taking the \nshape of an arm, hand and all.  He attached as War Machine&#39;s left arm.\n\n---\n\nWar Machine pounded his left fist against his chest, letting out a roar.  \n&quot;NONE SHALL WITHSTAND THE MIGHT OF WAR MACHINE&quot;.  He raised his wrists, \nfiring off three laser bolts from each (barrels extending from wrists), six \nbolts in relative size to the 45 foot behemoth heading for the Mafia Base.\n\n---\n\nUnitron looked at War Machine.  &quot;Another idiotic gestalt.  Those things are \nto dangerous...&quot; he said slowly, firing 25 rapid laser bolts in a strafing \nrun.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor screamed as an autogun blast caught him the face, forming a huge \ngash in his forehead, his face charred.  &quot;WHY ME!?
