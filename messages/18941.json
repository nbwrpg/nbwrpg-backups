Computer, total clampdown, track that bot!!&quot;\n\nLooking at the console to see where Diamond had gone, DevilDuer sees that \nshe&#39;s in the vents. He jumps up, sounds of the outside exits shutting as he \njumps to the vent, clambering into it. Realizing he was stalking a \npossibly-poisonous snake, he jumps back down, activating his comm.\n\n&quot;Hey, everyone,&quot; he says into it, &quot;There&#39;s a snake-bot on the loose. If ya \nsee her, get her in stasis lock or somethin&#39;, I&#39;ll be there t&#39; pick &#39;er up.&quot;\n\nHe runs out of the room, looking at his scanners, hoping that every exit was \nsecured.\n\n"}}
