No, he cant, he took a step back, and wound up\nhis fist, and shot it forward with all his might into the icy wall, a huge\nrumble coming from his immences strength, as the ice cracked, and the wall\ngave way, as the hundreds of tons of ice above came crashing down, and in\nall the chaos, of the huge tremors, and the large amout of ice falling,\nMegatron had to aim his cannon upwards, and with what remained of his\nenergy, fire a huge blast, to keep himself from getting buried. The stream\nof raw power cut through the ice falling towards him, melting it as soon as\nhis power hit it. Then there was silence.\n\nHe fell to the ground, panting, his energy reserves where almost used up in\nthat blast, and a huge hole where all the ice fell remained, &quot;I must get\nthe .... energy&quot; he whispered, as he crawled forward.\n\n\n\n"}}
