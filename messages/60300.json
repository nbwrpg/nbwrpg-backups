One was tall, with beam weapons mounted into his body.  His \nface was always a perpetual sneer, which cleverly disguised his lack \nof thinking. The other, also tall, was much differant.  He was like a \ndignitary or stately male.  But his regal appearance hide his \nincredible indurance, he survived many battles, and thus his \njudgement was affected.  He regarded his companion with disgust, he \nwas inferior.  Suddenly a fmale voice rang out.\n&quot;Splattercannon, Necross, you are to proceed to the Maximal base on \nthe planet.  Unicron&#39;s orders.&quot;\nThe female chuckled from an unseen corridor, as the first male walke \nto an airlock.\n&quot;Hold it, you oaf, we need provisions, we need energon!&quot; Necross said.\n&quot;Well then let&#39;s get some and go!  Unicron commands!&quot; Splattercannon \nsays as he turns an walks down another corridor.  They shortly come \nupon an energon cache, consume their fill, and then leave for the \nplanet below, intent on fighting this day.\n\n\n"}}
