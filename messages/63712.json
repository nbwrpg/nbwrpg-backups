For if they are on the base and working\n&gt;   as our allies, then they must have done something to keep in trust\n&gt;   with you. But surely from the depths of my spark, I am in loathing of\n&gt;   thier kind. Yes sir, as you have so ordered I will not create\n&gt;   dissention in the ranks nor will I create conflict with them. As you\n&gt;   order me to do so, I shall work along side with them and strive to be\n&gt;   a perfect soldier. To complete all tasks at hand without question or\n&gt;   fail.&quot;  She lowered her head, &quot;I shall try to keep my personal feeling\n&gt;   just that, personal and not betray them as I have in the past. But if\n&gt;   I may I shall voice them only to you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   She let her head fall in shame. Her sense of honor told her that she\n&gt;   had disgraced herself infront of her commanding officer and will need\n&gt;   to strive to her fullest to regain her honor in his optics.  &quot;Sir, is\n&gt;   there some task for which you have need of me?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
