She had \nno memeory of walking or crawling there.  She slowly got to her feet. \nShe walked inside the bunker, leaving a diminishing trail of mech \nfluid.  By the time she was entering into the main roomof the bunker, \nher wounds had healed up fully and her strength had returned to her.  \nShe went around looking for Aracnia.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron sniffed the air around the doors to the great cavern. \nSo far \n&gt; they had not met any troble...but they had just gotten to the cave \nafter all. \n&gt; Waspinator also buzzed frantically around the cavern.\n&gt;     &quot;How do we get in, Megatron?&quot; Waspinator said in his insect \nbizz voice. \n&gt; He was getting on the tyrants nerves.\n&gt;     Megatron didnt answer, but instead rapped on the door and \nwaited for an \n&gt; answer.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aracnia looked to her new....um...intrest, Quickstrike.
