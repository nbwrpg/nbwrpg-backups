He frowns. Something was \nwrong, he could feel it. He looks down at his hand, seeing that it was half \ntransparent. No! It was happening again.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be gone for a few days,&quot; he says over his comm-link to the Alliance, \n&quot;Nemesis is in charge untill I get back.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Nemesis. &quot;Finish the meeting with Panzertron. Try to recruit him.&quot;\n\nWith that, Zardus phases out, ready to phase back in in several days.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn his quarters, DevilDuer turns around in his chair. He was not feeling \nwell. Stumbling across the room, he falls on his bed. With a flash, DevilDuer \nis gone (for a few days).\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot spins around, looking at the sky. He could swear something had just \nflown over him.\n\n&quot;Night vision,&quot; he tells his internal computer, his optics changing color. He \nlooks around, seeing a bird. That was it. Perndabot lifts his gun, his optics \nwidening when he looks at his arm, seeing through it. He growls. Not again!\n\n&quot;There is a Maximal at my coordinates,&quot; he says over his comm-link, the \ndevice accidently transmitting that message over all frequences, then sending \nthe coordinates.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica and Bloodystrike drop off the energon they had mined in the cargo \nhold. Reptilica smiles. &quot;That&#39;s 200k of energon.&quot;\n\nBloodystrike growls. &quot;I hate mining.&quot;\n\nWith a flash, the two dissapear.\n\n"}}
