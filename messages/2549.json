He could care less. He rubbed the \nback of his neck. He must have been out for quiet a while. He went to a room \nwhere he again, refueled his energies, then went back to Megatron&#39;s quarters \nand laid back down. He felt strange in his quarters, but for now it would \nhave to do. It would make sense to get his own, but that didn&#39;t seem the \ncase.\n\nHe fell asleep for the second time.\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Wed, 31 May 2000 17:29:59 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;Sinesis called Quickstrike...... &quot;Quickstrike, i am now in the process of\n&gt;fooling these Maximals, the Peole&#39;s Group!.....they are so \n&gt;gullible!....they\n&gt;don&#39;t know that me and sinister are leading them into a trap!....&quot; Sinesis\n&gt;said through Quickstrike&#39;s com.....\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, May 31, 2000 3:20 PM\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Heck,&quot; Quickstrike said into his comm-link, while standing the the \n&gt;middle\n&gt; &gt; of the hallway. &quot;Any...reports?

He lightly kicked his side and walked away. That&#39;ll teach him \n&gt;to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;pick\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a fight with him. He went on his way. He wondered if any of his\n&gt;comrades\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were here. He wondered where Sinesis was.
