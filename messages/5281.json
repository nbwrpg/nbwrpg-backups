In the wild a wolf and owl compete for the \nsame food. he hoped that would be different with the maximals. He \ndidn&#39;t want to hurt her, even to survive.\nLunarpine shook his head, trying to seperate the logic and instincts \nburied in his head. To justify both he asked two questions.\n&quot;Shadow Wing where are we going and who will greet us when we  \narrive? \n(side question- how are we getting across the ocean from canada to \nTibet?)  \n\n-- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She chuckled, &quot;Haven&#39;t heard that one in a while.&quot;\n&gt; She transformed into Owl mode.
