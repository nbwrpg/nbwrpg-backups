Her back feet clung to Dinobot with all the strength she had, while her front paws swiped at Tavatron&#39;s hand. She swung from his snout, but managed to hang on, while fighting off both Dinobots claws and Tavatrons Staff. When Tavatron swung, the little black kitten ducked and dug her claws into his snout even deeper. She raised her head and blinked with dark purple eyes, and looked at Dinobot.*&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&quot; RRRRROOOOWWWWWRRRR, HHSSSSTTTTT!!!&quot;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;* Meanwhile, the little white kitten in Iron Raptors arms was laying down to nap when he heard the black kittens screech. His head shot upwards and he began to squirm and try to get out of her grasp. He looked at Iron Raptor and mewed*&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&quot; Merrow?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;TMRATTRAP@...&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: Cat Problems! \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Date: Wed, 31 Jan 2001 21:14:22 -0800 \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;** Dinobot growled as Tavatron approached him and the small ball of fur on \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;his nose, knowing that she was trying to help him but not quite wanting \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;anyone near him at the moment. Glaring at the fembot as he stood there and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;watched her hand come closer and closer to the black ball of lint. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;For some unexplainable reason Tavatron&#39;s sudden apology heightened his \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;aggression and his eyes turned into slits. This was pathetic! Since when had \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;he needed the help of others in a foolish situation such as this? It \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;was...absurd! A grown man such as himself with a history of bloodshed, \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;seeming helpless just because a black ball from Hell landed on his snout! \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;What foolishness! However, Dinobot remained where he was as Tavatron \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;leaned close and the small creature decided to use her nose as a target, the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;female jumping back and whimpering quietly in alarm. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Dinobot only snarled and rolled his eyes, getting sick of the little game, \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;which this creature was deciding to play with the both of them. Thinking and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;wondering if it had any clue that it would be nothing but stray whips of \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;fuzz on the wind if he ever got his transmetal claws on it. It was already \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;stamped DEAD as far as he was concerned. Dinobot jerked his head towards \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Tavatron as she tore her staff from sub-space, wondering if she was going to \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;take some sort of revenge upon the ball-o-fuzz resting comfortably upon his \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;most highly reflective snout. However, was not eager to see if his thoughts \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;were false...or her aim. There was one fact, which Tavatron would have to \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;catch up upon before she so much of moved a metallic muscle, and that was \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;that if she hit him instead of the cat she would have a pair of transmetal \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;fangs to try and pry off of her throat. She was indeed his friend, yes...but \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;no bot hit him and got away with it. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Dinobot snarled in response to her telling of him to remain still, shaking \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;his head to try and rid himself of the creature before moving it down and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;reaching towards it with his own claws. If it tried to swat him, he would \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;simply squish it, then peel it off of his snout. Which suited him just as \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;well.** \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;_________________________________________________________________________ \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
