I never saw that post when the Oblitercons moved. Sorry. And believe it or not, I�m not bored.\n\n* Iron Raptor jumped as she heard Dark One yell at her and fire towards the ceiling, her hand slamming against the bars of the cell at the action.\nShe hissed again as she drew her hand back and looked at it again, now the palm and top of her hand open and bleeding mech fluid. This wasn�t going well, a fact now known to the fullest.\nIron Raptor looked back towards the back of the cell and saw Tavatron, seeing how damaged she was. She sighed with annoyance of their situation and cursed herself for thinking that she could simply walk away, she should have known that Zardus would never allow them to do that.\nWith a narrowed opticed look she then turned her face back towards Dark One, slowly getting to her feet and glaring at him from between the bars. She saw the autogun come down from the ceiling but ignored it, not caring if she got shot but just itching for a chance to dig her teeth into the bot she glared at.\nHer attention was then averted towards Hiss as he chuckled, her annoyance rising with ever breath he took.\nIron Raptor bared her teeth as she heard him call her a scum bag, every inch of her wanting to leap out and rip his throat open!\nShe walked up to the bars but stayed far enough back that they wouldn�t harm her, hearing the buzz of the electricity running threw them at this distance.\nShe felt like some caged animal as she stood there and looked beyond the bars, an animal that just yearned to kill once it was released. She glared at each one of the Oblitercons in tern as she paced back and forth behind the bars, just willing for one of them to come close enough for her to reach out and break their neck!\nHer species was well known for their high temper, and she was simply proving that knowledge.\nIron Raptor hissed at Hiss as she heard him finish her sentence and heard the other Oblitercons chuckle, her hiss ending in a half out roar as she finally had enough.\nShe struck forward heavily and with force, completely ignoring the bars and their warning buzz!\nThere was the sound of metal ringing as metal hit metal; a shower of sparks erupting towards the Oblitercons as her force hit them and the electrified bars began to do their job. *\n\n� Laugh at ME, you Slags, and the last thing you hear will be my teeth cracking the supports of you super structures!!!� \n\n*Iron Raptor didn�t care as she felt the painful surge of power run through and begin to short-circuit her structure, she continued to throw her weight into the bars in an attempt to get at Hiss and the rest of the Oblitercons. Her teeth were bared and a roar in her throat, every muscle straining to break through the barrier that held her back.\nBut soon her systems began to flicker, a sign that they might soon give out.\nIt was common sense that stopped her from slamming against the bars any longer, simply then standing back and glaring at the Oblitercons. Just daring them to let her out, to unleash her to their throats.\nPacing the cell again she glared at them from under her brow plate, a snarl on her lips and her hands in fists. Just waiting for another chance to go at them.\nA small smirk came across her lips then as she saw where she had hit, the bars bent outward towards her tormenters but still giving off the buzzing sound, still electrified.\nShe looked at the dented bars and then at the Oblitercons with the smirk, simply letting it sink in that if the bars hadn�t have held that same force that bent those bars would be baring down on them at this very moment.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
