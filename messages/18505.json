But  by the look of Cyber Claw, something was up.  Her insticts \ntold her not to trust this one, and she wasn&#39;t going to trust any of \nAracnia&#39;s group untill they proved to be loyal. But after what \nhappened with Phobia, she was having serious doubts about her own \ntroops.  Right now, she had to play her cards right. &quot;Very well, we \nshall wait for Black Aracnia to arrive. I hope this allience will \nwork out. Just think of the possabilities of it all.  All the \npredacons unite, and together, we can crush the maximals. Wouldn&#39;t it \nbe glorious?&quot;  She smiled at the thought.  &quot;Although, I think instead \nof one ruler, a council will be needed.  What do you think my new \nfriend?&quot;\n\nShe tried to appear open and welcome them into her pack. But she \nreally was waiting to see what trap they were laying for her.  As a \nleader,she knew that everyone would gun her down any chance they \ncould get.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Cyber Claw:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyber Claw glared at KitKat. &quot;Perhaps she will be here soon.
