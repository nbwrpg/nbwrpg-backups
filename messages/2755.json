A natural\nbarricade, protecting both sides from each other, thus stopping the battle\nand from anyone getting hurt any further.\n&gt; She  felt the last shots hit her sides but she really didn&#39;t care, the\nroar from her mouth said that there was to be no more fighting.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; ENOUGH!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that said she then turned her massive head towards Ramhorn, not a\nmean or misunderstanding expression on her face. Then turning her head\ntowards Dracona and Plintissa with the same expression.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;re going to discuss this situation without further interruption with\nweapons if it kills me! Now calm down before I have to slag all three of\nyou!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that she then looked back over at Ramhorn.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Now, what&#39;s all this I hear about Stinkbomb&#39;s murder?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
