That will \nrestore your past to you.&quot;  She pulled the linterlink from the back \nof her head. &quot;If you want me to, I can do this. but we must hurry. I \nfear that there are those who may not want you to know who you are.&quot;\n\n\n\nKitKat::\nShe worked feverously over both projects.  She went from Phobia&#39;s \nbaby to working on Megatron&#39;s clone spark.  She finished with the \nbaby and set it in a stasis chamber.  She hoped that the baby would \ngive her more info on the temperal rift.  Next she worked on the \nspark.  She put it into the replicator and set the   replicator on \ngenerate.  She hoped it would start to create a perfect clone of \nMegatron.  Now that she had that done with, she turned to Starscream.\n&quot;I understand your fears.  And I agree with you, to a point.  I shall \nmake you my war general.  Destructor shall be my strategic advisor.  \nYou shall accompany me in my next meeting. But for now, I have to \nwork on this.&quot;  She looked at him and smiled.  &quot;Yes, I do believe I \nhave made the right choice, making you my advisor.  I trust that you \nwill help guide me to do the right thing.&quot; She smiled again and then \nwent back to looking at her console, working on the cloning.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois slowly lowered his weapon, and looked strangely at Battera \nand \n&gt; Cybershark.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The past?

Make me the thirs member of this \n&gt; council, as a military adviser. I would leave most of the decision \n&gt; making to all of you, I just want to be able to keep a close eye on \n&gt; Arachnia.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
