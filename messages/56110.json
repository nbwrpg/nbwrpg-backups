I got absolutely zero questions about Aerotaur&#39;s \nnew name... \n&gt; So... here it is.  I got bored and thought he should have a more \nappropriate \n&gt; name for his new look... In short Hevngjerrig is Norwegian for \nVengeful.  On \n&gt; a side note Hevn is Norwegian for Revenge.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Hevngjerrig::\n&gt;        He continues to hold onto Blackstorm&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;I&#39;m \nafraid that \n&gt; isn&#39;t good enough.  You are the reason I am here.  I exist only to \nensure \n&gt; your well-being.&quot;  He gives her shoulder a quick squeeze and lets \ngo, turning \n&gt; to face Maxima again.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;As for you, I really don&#39;t care what Hydras thinks of my \nnew look.  I \n&gt; don&#39;t think we&#39;re that similar.  I mean come on, he&#39;s a two headed \ndragon, \n&gt; and I&#39;m a winged centaur.  How much more different can you get?&quot;  \nHe leans \n&gt; close to her and smiles amicably.  &quot;As for this form,&quot;  he \nshrugs, &quot;is it my \n&gt; fault if we have similar tastes?&quot;  He winks conspiratorially and \nbacks up a \n&gt; step.\n\n\n"}}
