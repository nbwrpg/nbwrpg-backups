You be careful too.&gt;\nAnd with that she felt Prowls arms open, looking down at the ground as she \ndropps a short way before landing on her feet, looking at the battle from \nthis new view point,finding that she could see quite well through her helm.\nHer cape flew behind  her slightly, then looking down at the little creature \nin her hands.*\n\n&quot; Remember, into the compartment.&quot;\n\n*And with that she moved the little guy up over her shoulder, opening a \nlittle compartment in her back armor, where the blade of her sword was \nmostly held.She tipped her hand so that he would tumble in.\nHer other hand moving up to take hold of the handle of her sword, sliding it \nout and holding it at the ready while she straightened up and looked towards \nthe battle.\nHopefully the little ball-o-fuzz wouldn&#39;t find the ride too bumpy.\n&lt; I&#39;ll remember that.&gt;She replied to Prowl quickly.\nWith that Iron Raptor steadied herself out and then began to run towards the \nbattle, since Prowl had dropped her off a few hundred meters from it.\nWith the added armor her body felt heavy and her legs had to work hard, her \nfeet pounding against the ground as she ran.\nWith her sword in had Iron Raptor looked for a target, seeing one which \nseemed a good enough one to her.\nAfter watching Astral fire off missials at the CF, she decided that he would \nbe her first victom to taste her new power.\nIron Raptor snarled as she brought her sword back, the blade glowing for a \nsecond before bringing it down, an energy slash sent towards Astral&#39;s \ntorso.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
