These robots specialize in hunting as the name implies and \n&gt; are also very feirce Warriors. After completion of the bots the \n&gt; Maximals began to place them with in Maximal ships one each that is \n&gt; until The preds stole the Maxi ship which halted progress. Only two \n&gt; of the bots were created and placed (myself and my brothers \n&gt; characters) within the preds stolen ship and the maximals trailing \n&gt; ship. Since the bots are top secret they would be known of by high \n&gt; ranking bots and are hidden deep within each ship. Since the \nHunters \n&gt; are programed to follow orders they will probably take alegances \nwith \n&gt; whom ever wakes them up.\n&gt; \n&gt; One last thing : My brother wishes to play a Beast wars type \n&gt; character within the maximal ship and I wish to play a technorganic \n&gt; within the pred ship. Is this possable?\n\n\n"}}
