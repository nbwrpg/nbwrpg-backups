Had dinner with friends.\n\nWhimpers came from the kit when she couldn�t feed, her tiny tummy grumbling \nwith an empty sound.\nThe sound of the thing that was holding her wasn�t mommy and she was \nconfused. Where was the warm side and milk her brain was trying to find?\nShe was starting to make tiny yipps when she was suddenly washed, \nremembering how her mothers tongue use to run over her back and she became \nquiet, thinking mommy had come back.\nAnd on reaction she tried to find the war side and suckle but there was \nnothing there! Mommy was just there, where was she again?\nThe she-kit turned a bit in Starice�s arms, thinking that the warm side was \njust behind her where it usually was when it wasn�t in front.\nBut it wasn�t there either!\nMilk! Where was milk? Where there was milk there was mommy.\nBy this time Starice had taken the kit to the lab, and all the sounds \nconfusing the baby and making her mew/whine.\n(mews are little whimpering sounds for the baby)\nNow time passed and before and knew it something strange smelling was put by \nher nose (e-cubes + o-food). She didn�t know what it was so she sniffed the \ncubes, the smell not registering in her mind as something she could eat but \nwhen her nose touched a cube sitting on top another one the jerky movements \nof her body made it fall off, surprising her and she yipped.\nDrawing back into Starice�s arms she cuddled into them, trying to hide from \nwhat made the scary sound. But soon she became brave since there was no more \nof the sound and moved in Starice�s arms again, suddenly bumping her nose on \nher fingers.\nThe shape of their tips reminded her of her mother�s teats  and she opened \nher tiny mouth, trying to suckle from them.\nHer mind thinking milk again. Her itty-bitty paws moved unsteadily towards \nthe sides of Starice�s hand, trying to massage the milk from mommy�s side.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
