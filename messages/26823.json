Right away Ma&#39;am!&quot; \nwith a hint of laughter in her voice before taking to the skies in \nsearch.\n\nShe knew there could have been dry wood in the clearing they had been \nin, but she was grateful to stretch her wings after a long.. and \ncramping night. \n\nOnce she had cleared the trees, a smile spread across her face as she \nfelt the warm sunlight coming up and beginning to shine. Focusing her \neyes downwards for any place that there could be dry firewood. After \nabout a minute a searching, her eyes sought out a tree that was a \nlittle smaller than the rest, and had maybe been sheltered by the \nother trees, so any moisture could have been prevented. She shrugged, \nand swooped down. She didn&#39;t know everything about this planet, nor \ndid she pretend to.. but it made sense.\n\nLanding on a fairly sturdy branch, she kept her wings out to steady \nherself and dug her claws into the branch. Transforming to her robot \nmode, she kept her grip with the agileness (is that even a word? LOL) \nof one who was light and not that tall. She looked around and found \nthat there was indeed some very dry branches there, and she sighed. \nThe Fuzor made a firm grip on the branch and wrenched down on the \nbranch, snapping it off.\n\nAfter getting several big peices, she held them tightly in her arms \nand stood up on the branch, wobbling slightly but managing to get her \nwings in the proper position. It was always harder to fly in bot \nmode. \n\nTeltoli flapped her wings and took off into the sky, looking for the \nclearing that Carnage was in. Her green eyes soon picked it out and \nshe put her feet first, landing in the clearing fairly smoothly. She \nput the large peices of wood near the boar.\n\nShe stayed in her robot form just in case. &quot;There you go. Sorry for \nthe wait, but I needed a stretch of the wings anyway&quot;\n\n\n---------------\nSteph F. Geeves\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; drawled Jack, &quot;it looks like it&#39;ll be up to Teal&#39;c and me to \nonce again be &#39;babysitting&#39; the two of you. Daniel has a building \nthat&#39;s misbehaving and Carter&#39;s got spooky energy waves--gee, Teal&#39;c, \nwe&#39;ll be having more fun than sentient beings should be allowed to \nhave.&quot;\n\t- &quot;The Test&quot; by TrishGirl\n\n\n"}}
