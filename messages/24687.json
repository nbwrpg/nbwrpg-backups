They moved their way as one back to \nthe area where the council base was. They stayed at least a mile away \nto make sure they were not seen or picked up by a scanner. \nQuickstrike stayed by Wildfire&#39; side to stay in her range of pshyic \nabilities, and be able to read the mind ambient. \n\n\n"}}
