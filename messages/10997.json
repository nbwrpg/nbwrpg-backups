It was the \nfirst personal quarters he&#39;d had since he had been brought back on-\nline. He had been on the run ever since, trying to advoid the others \ntesty attitudes. He found an empty quarters in the ship and made it \nhis. If anyone had anything to say about it, he was going to let them \nhave it. He just wanted to lay down and sleep on an actual bunk and \nhave an actual door. \n\nHe closed his optics, watching the dark hit his vision. He listen to \nthe slight hums that sounded in the ship, and a few voices that were \nmuffled through the distance. \n\nWhen he did drift off to sleep, he dreamt of blackness and felt a \nslight chill against his temperature sensitive armor; but he wasn&#39;t \nsure. He just wanted to rest fully recharge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
