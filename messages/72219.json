Yes=\r\n, he was a\n&gt; machine who&#39;s very size and power commanded respect. Not only =\r\nthat but\n&gt; he had forged a group of predators . . . of PREDACONS seemingly =\r\nout\n&gt; the defeat that had been dealt them by the Maximals at the end of the=\r\n\n&gt; first Beast Wars. Was he still MEGATRON and GALVATRON or was he\n&gt; someth=\r\ning wholly different and how would this affect the future of the\n&gt; Predacon=\r\ns? Only the future would say.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the group made their way to the meeti=\r\nng room there was indeed an\n&gt; open message link waiting for HYDRAS, althoug=\r\nh the signature was not\n&gt; that of STRAIGHT SHOT and instead of looking for =\r\nWASPINATOR it was\n&gt; addressed properly to the current Predacon commander HY=\r\nDRAS.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We must talk.&quot; were the words that were waiting for HYDRAS as h=\r\ne\n&gt; arrived. LEO PRIME&#39;s stern face appeared to look through the link and\n&gt;=\r\n see not only HYDRAS but those who were traveling with him, peering\n&gt; into =\r\nhis very secrets.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course that was not the case, since HYDRAS would =\r\nhave to\n&gt; acknowledge him first, and it would be up to him how much could b=\r\ne\n&gt; seen.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
