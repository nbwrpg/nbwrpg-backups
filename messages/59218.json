He \ngathered his weapons and what little equipment he could salvage.  \nBefore he set out, he located as best he could the closest base.  \n&quot;At best, two bases worth interest.  I will find my quarry later.  \nNow I need to find a place to rest, the Predacons and Maximals are \ncertainly on the way to investigate the crash.&quot;\nThe bounty hunter exited after setting his traps, hoping to run into \nsomeone out in this wilderness.\n\nOOC- Ok, Anyone can hopefully run into my character.  It can be \nanyone, I don&#39;t care.  Just find him.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bustercross365&quot; &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; The small craft cruised through the area of controversy, the spot \n&gt; where Megatron II and the Maximal ship Axalon disappeared.  The \n&gt; ship&#39;s onboard computer reported to its pilot the area was full of \n&gt; subspace instabilities.\n&gt; &lt;Hmmm, so their trans-warp dives must has interacted with the \n&gt; instabilities.&gt; the pilot theorized.\n&gt; &quot;Computer, use avalible jump data to jump the same way the Axalon \nand \n&gt; Nemesis did.&quot;\n&gt; The computer complied, and was ready to jump through time.\n&gt; &quot;Engage transwarp drive.&quot;\n&gt; The ship jumped into warp space, and shortly was found in the Sol \n&gt; system, near Prehistoric Earth.  The craft somehow sustained major \n&gt; damage, and was sent careening down, to crash on the North american \n&gt; continent.\n\n\n"}}
