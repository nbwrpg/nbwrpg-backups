It&#39;s =\r\nwhere we go sometime to leave the base, it&#39;s also where we go after we come=\r\n in! It&#39;s got all these cool computers and stuff, and tables and that and i=\r\nt&#39;s where we are right now! Isn&#39;t that a coincidence? Well, anyway, it&#39;s a =\r\nnice room maybe a little too dusty but then again maybe not and it&#39;s a good=\r\n room because it has lots of room, and it leads into all of the other rooms=\r\n, it&#39;s also one of the biggest rooms, which is good, because everyone might=\r\n try to come in at the same time, and if they do and the room is really tin=\r\ny then everyone will be crowded and the base might explode. Also, it&#39;s big =\r\nbecause something might happen like someone breaks in, and there might be a=\r\n shootout and everyone will get shot if there isn&#39;t much room, did I mentio=\r\nn that? I don&#39;t think I did, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I know I&#39;m not wr=\r\nong because I&#39;m right. Anyway, I&#39;m Squawktalk and you are?
