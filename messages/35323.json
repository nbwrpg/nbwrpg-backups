She\n&gt; doesn&#39;t notice Airbomber&#39;s approach, until several shots streak by\n&gt; her, she turns and tries to dodge out of the way, but gets hit twice,\n&gt; and it knocked down. She rolls as she lands, and ends up on her\n&gt; feet, claws sheathed, and disk launcher out, with a charred dent on\n&gt; her leg and another on her right arm. She holds her pain in, and\n&gt; fires two disks at the torso of the approaching Airbomber. The\n&gt; disks are set to one second impact-explosion.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 22 May 2001, at 20:15, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Stranato was hit by the energy balls and laughed.
