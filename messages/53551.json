Jan\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; There once was a man named George Thomas,\n&gt; pastor\n&gt;   &gt; in\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; a small New England town. One Easter Sunday\n&gt;   &gt; morning\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; he came to the Church carrying a rusty,\n&gt; bent,\n&gt;   &gt; old\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; bird cage, and set it by the pulpit. \n&gt; Eyebrows\n&gt;   &gt; were raised and, as \n&gt;   &gt;   if in response, PastorThomas began to speak...\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; &quot;I was walking through town yesterday when I\n&gt; saw\n&gt;   &gt; a\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; young boy coming toward me swinging this\n&gt; bird\n&gt;   &gt; cage.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; On the bottom of the cage were three little\n&gt; wild\n&gt;   &gt; birds, shivering \n&gt;   &gt;   with cold and fright. I stopped the\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; lad and asked, &quot;What you got there, son?&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Just some old birds,&quot; came the reply.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; What are you gonna do with them?&quot; I asked.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Take &#39;em home and have fun with &#39;em,&quot; he\n&gt;   &gt; answered.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; I&#39;m gonna tease &#39;em and pull out their\n&gt; feathers\n&gt;   &gt; to\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; make &#39;em fight. I&#39;m gonna have a real good\n&gt;   &gt; time.&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; &quot;But you&#39;ll get tired of those birds sooner\n&gt; or\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; later. What will you do?&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; &quot;Oh, I got some cats,&quot; said the little boy.\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;They\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; like birds. I&#39;ll take &#39;em to them.&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; The pastor was silent for a moment.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; How much do you want for those birds, son?&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Huh?? !!! Why, you don&#39;t want them birds,\n&gt;   &gt; mister.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; They&#39;re just plain old field birds. They\n&gt; don&#39;t\n&gt;   &gt; sing.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; They ain&#39;t even pretty!&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; &quot;How much?&quot; the pastor asked again.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; The boy sized up the pastor as if he were\n&gt; crazy\n&gt;   &gt; and\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; said, &quot;$10?&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; The pastor reached in his pocket and took\n&gt; out a\n&gt;   &gt; ten\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; dollar bill. He placed it in the boy&#39;s hand.\n&gt; In\n&gt;   &gt; a flash, the boy \n&gt;   &gt;   was gone. The pastor picked up the cage and\n&gt; gently\n&gt;   &gt; carried it to the \n&gt;   &gt;   end of the alley where there was a tree and a\n&gt;   &gt; grassy spot. Setting \n&gt;   &gt;   the cage down, he opened the door, and by\n&gt; softly\n&gt;   &gt; tapping the bars \n&gt;   &gt;   persuaded the birds out, setting them free.\n&gt; Well,\n&gt;   &gt; that explained the \n&gt;   &gt;   empty bird cage on the pulpit, and then the\n&gt; pastor\n&gt;   &gt; began to tell\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; this story.  One day Satan and Jesus were\n&gt; having\n&gt;   &gt; a conversation. \n&gt;   &gt;   Satan had just come from the Garden of Eden,\n&gt; and\n&gt;   &gt; he was gloating and \n&gt;   &gt;   boasting.  &quot;Yes, sir, I just caught the world\n&gt; full\n&gt;   &gt; of people down \n&gt;   &gt;   there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew they\n&gt;   &gt; couldn&#39;t resist. Got &#39;em \n&gt;   &gt;   all!&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; &quot;What are you going to do with them?&quot; Jesus\n&gt;   &gt; asked.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Satan replied, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m gonna have fun! I&#39;m\n&gt;   &gt; gonna\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; teach them how to marry and divorce each\n&gt; other,\n&gt;   &gt; how to hate and \n&gt;   &gt;   abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and\n&gt;   &gt; curse. I&#39;m gonna teach \n&gt;   &gt;   them how to invent guns and\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; bombs and kill each other. I&#39;m really gonna\n&gt; have\n&gt;   &gt; fun!&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; &quot;And what will you do when you get done with\n&gt;   &gt; them?&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Jesus asked.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll kill &#39;em,&quot; Satan glared proudly.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; &quot;How much do you want for them?&quot; Jesus\n&gt; asked.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t want those people. They ain&#39;t\n&gt; no\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; good. Why, you&#39;ll take them and they&#39;ll just\n&gt;   &gt; hate\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; you. They&#39;ll spit on you, curse you and kill\n&gt;   &gt; you.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; You don&#39;t want those people!!&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; &quot;How much? He asked again.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, &quot;All your\n&gt;   &gt; blood,\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; tears and your life.&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Jesus said, &quot;DONE!&quot; Then He paid the price.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; The pastor picked up the cage he opened the\n&gt; door\n&gt;   &gt; and\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; he walked from the pulpit.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;         Yahoo!
