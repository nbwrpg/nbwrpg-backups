He kept an open frequency to \nall happenings. He overheard a battle between a maxi cheetor and some odd \nquickstrike. HE noticed as quickstrike and the two females were carrying him \noff that they were on direct route to where he planned to meet tthe new \nmaximal longhunter. HE would eventualy encounter them any way so he decided \nhe better at least have the element of surprise. Bobertron tararize! He \ntransformed into his robot mode and jumped down and gave a quick shot to \nquickestrikes head. Before they new what was happening bobertron grabbed the \ncat and flew off. Immedidatley he comm magmatron im gonna need some help \nhere. Im gonna have three pissed off guys on my tail in a nano click so move \nyour ass!\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
