The events page should be fully up to date as of this point. If I missed something on it, someone tell me. As soon as the new login system is out, the site will be much more easilly updatable.\n\nSo far, I&#39;ve planned the following for the new login script:\n\n- Everything the current one offers.\n- Members will be able to post fanfiction and fanart without having to go through the slow proccess of having me put it up.\n- The council will be able to create polls and update the site.\n- If KSL wants is fine with it, I can implement a member profile thing much like his NBWRPers site.\n\nThat&#39;s all for the moment. I think I forgot half of it though.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., lordofdarkness11001@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; hey everybody i will be making my own events page for this rpg on a \n&gt; &gt; new website\n\n\n"}}
