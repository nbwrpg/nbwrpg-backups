A scientist looked into the problem and realized\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; the planets that were avoided were full of avian life that lived off\n&gt; insect\n&gt; &gt; life. The insecticons took on the survival instincts of the\n&gt; creatures they\n&gt; &gt; turned into. The logical solution was to create avian modes for our\n&gt; &gt; translife.&quot; she paused trying to speak without revealing to much.\n&gt; &quot;Anyway\n&gt; &gt; the point is that everything has a predator and prey.
