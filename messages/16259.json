Remember awhile back I wanted to host a chat with \n&gt; everyone to celebrate the anniversary? Well, I was thinking we \ncould \n&gt; use the chat here at egroups cause the one at the sigh isn&#39;t very \n&gt; good. But the thing is, and don&#39;t get your hopes up because it \nisn&#39;t \n&gt; official, that II could get Bob Skir, one of the writers and \n&gt; Producers of Beast Wars, to join us at the chat! What do you all \n&gt; think?\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignatius\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No, nothing. You aren&#39;t doing anything wrong. It&#39;t just \n&gt; that...sometimes Prebon might be hard to please.
