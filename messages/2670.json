Just got home from a friends house and all.)\n\n\n* BrightBlade soon found herself smiling at Lightmare�s comment on her claim \non Gangon, as if that move wasn&#39;t predictable! She had seen the way that the \ntwo of them had been looking at each other, but she had also seen the way \nthat the more that Gangon looked at the new bot then more likely she was to \nloose her partner. It was as the saying went, � Out with the old and in with \nthe new.� Herself being the old and Lightmare being the new. But then why \nshould she care? It wasn�t as if Gangon had ever loved her, just said that \nshe was beautiful, protected her and that was it. Or at least that was what \nshe thought. Just saying that a bot happened to look nice and helping them \ndidn�t mean that they loved them, and a lot of other bots would be shocked \nout of their minds if it ever did!\nBrightBlade then leaned on one leg and looked away from both of them but \nkept an optic on Lightmare.*\n\n� I�d watch what you say to me, Old Nellie. Or you might end up as a pot of \nglue!�\n\n*She then transformed back into her beast mode but then began to walk \ntowards Gangon as he laied in the ground. When she finally came up beside \nhis fainted form and looked down, a simple and emotionless expression on her \nface .She then created and downloaded this message so that he would see it \neven as he was blacked out:*\n� You can either come back to base with me�or stay here with that walking \ncow pie. But I�m going back to base to continue my duties.�\n\n* With that BrightBlade then began to walk slowly towards the Predacon ship. \nIf Gangon was to wake up and follow her then it would mean that he wanted to \ncontinue being her partner, if not then their partnership was through and he \nthen had Lightmare as his new partner. That was as she saw it, it was either \nher or Lightmare.Two was a peace bond but three was a crowd! The choice was \nhis and only histo make, even though she new that she would be left by \nherself again...working solo as she alway had before. She really didn�t care \nwhich, she had worked alone before and it wasn�t anything new to her.*\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
