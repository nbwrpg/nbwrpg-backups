Like a wave of swarm =\r\ntheir disintegration beams\n&gt;  blaze into the buildings below with a frighte=\r\nning intensity. As the\n&gt;  defensive shields go up and the missile battery o=\r\npens fire on Scourge,\n&gt;  like killer bees on the warpath several sweeps fly=\r\n at the battery, the\n&gt;  air seeming to almost buzz with laserfire! The defe=\r\nnders at the missile\n&gt;  battery do manage to pull down a few sweeps, only t=\r\no have a few more\n&gt;  take their place and continue firing. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Lord Per=\r\nseus and the troops have a similar effect as they lay into the\n&gt;  sweeps, t=\r\nheir blasts cutting down a few sweeps. For a moment there is a\n&gt;  reprieve =\r\nas sweeps explode with a satisfying blaze of fire and light.\n&gt;  But then mo=\r\nre come from different directions. It&#39;s like firing into a\n&gt;  swarm, you hi=\r\nt a few, and a few more come. Their attacks coming from\n&gt;  everywhere above=\r\n them and to the sides, laser blasts and disintegration\n&gt;  beams rock their=\r\n fortified area, seeking to terminate those housed\n&gt;  within!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Withou=\r\nt any commands from Nightstrike and Darkfate the sweeps around\n&gt;  the Maxim=\r\nal base just continue to pound on it from above, seemingly\n&gt;  content to ke=\r\nep anything on the inside the base pent up there. Anything\n&gt;  so foolish as=\r\n to step out of its doors face their cannons with a most\n&gt;  grueling intens=\r\nity!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  In the air above Scourge is only slightly impressed as the Maxi=\r\nmal\n&gt;  (Ravenchief) evades his blast, hoever it is the fact that he is igno=\r\nred\n&gt;  totally that sets his nerves on edge. It is then they his proximity\n=\r\n&gt;  alarms flip on warning him of the incoming missiles. He chuckles, &quot;Only\n=\r\n&gt;  six?? They don&#39;t know me!&quot; With a blast of power he drops down to near\n&gt;=\r\n  street level, zipping between tall buildings, far more agile then\n&gt;  simp=\r\nle missiles. As several of them hit structures rather then him his\n&gt;  laugh=\r\n echoes through the streets below. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Scourge&#39;s laugh slows a bit as h=\r\ne realizes that a few missiles continue\n&gt;  to follow him then. &quot;Heat seeker=\r\ns.&quot; He grumbles for a moment and then\n&gt;  chuckles, &quot;This should be fun!&quot; Fl=\r\nying towards one of the large\n&gt;  buildings he peppers it with laser fire, s=\r\netting it ablaze. Then with a\n&gt;  mighty thrust from his hover jets, which p=\r\nut out much less heat, he\n&gt;  pushes to the side and around the building as =\r\nthe building which is now\n&gt;  much hotter then he receives the brunt of the =\r\nremaining missile\n&gt;  strikes. His laugh echoes once again through the stree=\r\nts as several\n&gt;  sweeps meet him there and begin to rain destruction! \n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt;  In the air somewhat closer to the shoreline, Cyclonus had continued in\n&gt;=\r\n  the direction he was going, his jets flaring with power, the wind\n&gt;  almo=\r\nst screaming as it moved past him! As his own missiles exploded\n&gt;  spectacu=\r\nlarly at the railing he merely flew through blaze, with all the\n&gt;  attendan=\r\nt dramatic glory, allowing the heat of the explosion to either\n&gt;  attract R=\r\navenchief&#39;s missiles attention or detonate them. In either\n&gt;  case he rose =\r\nhigh into the air, careful to stay out of the line of fire\n&gt;  from those on=\r\n the shoreline below, as the missles just added to the\n&gt;  wreckage that fel=\r\nl towards the waters below. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Shifting to his robot mode, Cyclonus tu=\r\nrned his gaze to the approaching\n&gt;  Ravenchief, his form seeming to almost =\r\nradiate power as he floated in\n&gt;  mid air. He is tall and almost regal, see=\r\nming to be almost made for the\n&gt;  air boued as he was on powerful thrusters=\r\n that took the place of his\n&gt;  feet. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  His voice is deep and resonate=\r\n, exactly the pitch and timber of the\n&gt;  Cyclonus of old, &quot;Is this what you=\r\n wanted Maximal?&quot; Cyclonus lets go\n&gt;  with two more missiles, quickly the a=\r\nir behind them began to spin, then\n&gt;  ripple and finally burst aflame as th=\r\ney pulled away from Cyclonus and\n&gt;  streaked towards Ravenchief!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  At =\r\nthe shoreline below Doc manages to hit one of the two sweeps\n&gt;  menacing hi=\r\nm. However these sweeps are not jets and share very few of\n&gt;  their frailti=\r\nes; they are made for hunting and pursuing hostile prey,\n&gt;  and their armor=\r\n is extremely durable. The laser fire smokes along the\n&gt;  surface of the sw=\r\neep&#39;s armor, leaving a nasty gash, but does not bring\n&gt;  it down. The sweep=\r\ns just slow and stop just over the edge of the water\n&gt;  and open up with a =\r\nbarrage of laser fire at Doc&#39;s position.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Meanwhile from above severa=\r\nl sweeps move down following Rodimus and\n&gt;  kup, also opening up with canno=\r\nn fire at the swimming and hopefully\n&gt;  helpless Maximals below.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Pre=\r\nston\n&gt;  (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt;  \n&gt;  ________________________________________________=\r\n__\n&gt;  Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;  Tired of spam?
