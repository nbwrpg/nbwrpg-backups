I and Bazooka are some of the\n&gt; original Destrons. We have no connection to the Decpticons, although we\ndid\n&gt; at one point. We all under went a procedure that will prevent the\ndestruction\n&gt; of us if the Decpticons were destroyed in the past. This only went down\n&gt; recently after we learned that the Maximals and Predacons were fighting on\n&gt; past Earth. Now if you decide to join me then I will have you under go the\n&gt; same procedure It will remove all traces of Autobot or Decpticon within\nyou.\n&gt; Shredder, I can give you a beast mode if you wish for one, although you\nseem\n&gt; to not need one. Now as for you Mantella I can change your beast mode to\n&gt; something more powerful.
