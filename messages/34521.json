He staggered back a couple of steps. Then\nmechfluild leaking out his shoulder he touched his sword to his armor\naround the leak instantly sealing it.\n&quot;Now your mine.&quot; he said calmly geting into a defensive stance.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor could taste the mech fluid of FireBlade touch her tongue.\n&gt; And slowly, the inner jaws from the roof of her mouth crept towards\nthe arm\n&gt; that we trapped by her teeth.\n&gt; But her head was almost pulled back by FireBlade as he pulled, so\nher neck\n&gt; strained to keep pulling her own way.\n&gt; Luckily, this time, her tail had moved out of the way of FireBlades\nsword,\n&gt; gicing it tome to heal.  And that&#39;s just what it did.\n&gt; The armor/skin began to fuse together as she concintrated on mending\nthe\n&gt; wound.\n&gt; The inner jaws finally slammed down to get a further lock on his arm,\n&gt; pulling back and biting again, only to pull back a second time.\nRipping and\n&gt; mutilating.\n&gt; Iron Raptor&#39;s black eyes suddenly focused on the movement of\nFireBlade&#39;s\n&gt; shoulder mounted grenade launcher, suddenly pushing forward and\nopening her\n&gt; mouth more so that she could get the whole of his shoulder into it.\n&gt; She slammed her head down onto him, hoping that he would fall and\nshe could\n&gt; maul him from there.\n&gt; But one of her arms came up and tried to grab the arm with the sword.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Not as easily won over as you though, am I?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
