He didn&#39;t have any idea of where he\nwas for a couple seconds, or who the heck he was or anything.  Then\ninstantly, something just clicked into his mind.  He remembered talking to\na bot named Soundwave.  He had to find the leader of the Alliance, Zardus. \nSkulletron saw his plasma rifle at his side.  He picked it up and\nthen--BANG!--He blasted his way out of the CR Chamber.\n\n\t&quot;You, Bloodstryke I believe, where is Zardus!!!!!!  I must see him!!!  I\nhave to help the Alliance!  I have to aid them in winning their battles and\nin reaching their goals.......For We Are Many!!!!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
