Got got most of the soot and \nblack dust off as far as he could. He decided he may stay a little longer \nout here, not quite ready to return to the cave. In the Wild, he had plently \nof room and fresh air.\n\nHe surfaced, and at the shore he saw another bot, Lightmare. He screamed and \nsplashed backwards. She caught him off-guard. His leg dropped, putting him \nunderwater for a few seconds. He brough his head up.\n\n&quot;What in tarnation are ya doin&#39;?&quot; she shouted at her. &quot;Ya scared th&#39; slag \noutta me!&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
