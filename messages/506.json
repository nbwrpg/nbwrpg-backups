He wanted to find a place to rest, but he couldn&#39;t, in fear that Hell Beast&#39;s soldiers would find him. He didn&#39;t want to get caught. \n&lt;P&gt;He wanted to go back to the base. He wanted to know if the ship had taken them out. \n&lt;P&gt;Maybe it did. Maybe that was why his troops were out here, to find that bot who had messed with the computer and turned it against them. Well, if that was the case, they weren&#39;t going to find him. They never will. If his troops caught all of them, he would never know he did it. He and the others thought of him as the stupidest bot on the team. But he wasn&#39;t stupid, it was just the way he was. \n&lt;P&gt;Those sons of maintance bots won&#39;t find him. He wasn&#39;t going to be a prisioner. He picked up a few ideas as he was reformating the Darkside&#39;s files to Hell Beast&#39;s ship, but he hadn&#39;t the time to share them to Megatron. Those maintance bots had blown into the control room and shot him to the Pit. He wanted to get the jerk who posioned him and shot the heck out of his leg. \n&lt;P&gt;No one listened to him anymore. He just wanted the way it was before all of this. He wanted the group he was used to. He didn&#39;t like any of these bots. Not even Megatron&#39;s team. Sinesis was a big-mouth, trying to say he was better than everyone, even him. That, he didn&#39;t like. Shredder, he didn&#39;t care about. Rattrap, he didn&#39;t trust. Like he was going to trust any ex-Maximal. You&#39;d have to get up eariler in the mourning to fool him into that. Silverstryke---where the heck was he? \n&lt;P&gt;He didn&#39;t want to care about anybody. Just himself. His life was at stake. To the Pit with everyone else. The can go to the Inferno for all he cared. \n&lt;P&gt;Quickstrike went on, until the joints in his legs stared to ache. His left claw felt like it would fall off. He had to go on just a little further, a little more aways from the battle, so no one would track him down.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
