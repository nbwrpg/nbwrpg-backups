He thought he was smart enough and strong enough to escape Megatron. But at some times he sounded like he was on a death wish. She blinked after a few seconds and her red eyes went cold again. She shrugged and sighed. &quot;At least one of my tornments are gone.&quot; She studied Carnage and grinned. &quot;Would you mind me,&quot; she snarled, feeling somewhat uncomfortable in saying this. &quot;tagging along? Two blades are better than one, as a warrior would say. He still is the slagging reptile who torchered me, left me for dead, and hunted me so he could see me die! I believe that I have a bigger reason for revenge.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
