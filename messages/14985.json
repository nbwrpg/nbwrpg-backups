The only thing we can \ndo is use the pieces of hull we took off and....Wait! I&#39;ve got an \neven better idea! Ramulus, can you shout down the liftoff count? This \nthing is gonna go in a few minutes, and when it does we&#39;ll be stuck \nand liq will burn up in the atmosphere.&quot;\n\nBrix headed over to Gekkidama&#39;s dead body and picked it up He pressed \na few buttons on his arm, and his back plate popped off.\n\n&quot;Portable shield....Don&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t use it.&quot;\n\nBr5ix shoved the shield into the hole.\n\n&quot;This shield was designed to take huge beatings. I think it will hold \nthe re-entry. Shut down the countdown, I &#39;ve got to go somewhere for \na sec. Even though Gekkidama tried to kill, he was really insane from \nlac of contact. He still desrves a proper burial(In the show, did \nDinobt have a burial, or did they just blast him into space?). I&#39;ll \ngo cover him in some of the ship wreck.&quot;\n\nBrix picked up the body and walked away.\n\n\n"}}
