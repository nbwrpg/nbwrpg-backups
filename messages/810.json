She looked around and saw Gangon \ntrying to dig a hole under the Maximal base and then looked back at \nTavatron, Gangon was her partner...she just couldn&#39;t abandon him!\nBrightBlade suddenly shot 4 charges in a row at Tavatron and then hopped \ndown from the boulder, she kept firing at the boulder as she backed up \ntowards Gangon. Finally she bumped into her partner and snarled down to \nhim...*\n\n&quot; There&#39;s an extra energy charge in my back compartment, I was saving it for \nan emergency...this seems like a good enough one to me. Take it. It isn&#39;t \nmuch but it&#39;ll get you through the battle.&quot;\n\n* She continued to fire upon the boulder as she opened her compartment so \nthat Gangon could get to the energy reserve, she knew that he was her \npartner and her only real friend. It would be a shame and a waste if he was \nto die now.*\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n* Rage snarled in fright as she backed away from Scourge, this was so \nstrange and scary! How could that attack do this to her, turn her into one \nof them?\nShe was shaking a little from the shock of it all, how could this have \nhappened? And what scared her even more was that she was beginning to \nunderstand the sounds that came from her attacker, beginning to understand \nhis language!\nRage snarled again, what was she going to do?\nShe slowly got to her feet and stood in front of the Predacon, she was a bit \nunsteady but she was able to keep her balance.\nA question formed in her mind as she looked at Scourge with her grey optics, \neven sooner the question formed on her lips...*\n\n&quot; Who...who... you?&quot;\n\n* Her voice was soft at that moment, no louder then a whisp of wind and \ntwice as smooth. It wasn&#39;t the loud roar that she was used to but it was all \nshe could make right now, and even though she could speak she still had much \nto learn about putting together a proper sentence.\nRage looked at Scourge from head to foot, he was rather a big male and \nalmost seemed to have a dominating environment around him.\nShe almost seemed intimidated by him, but she wasn&#39;t about to show any signs \nof submission yet.*\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
