BrightBlade was \nstill in the CR chamber, and was cloaked. She did, however, make one \nfatal mistake... I&#39;ll rewrite your post since I have permission to\nuse \nyour chars.\n\n::Chordate/Rex/Perndabot::\n\nA beep shook Chordate from his sleep, the Maximal jerking his head \nover to the screen he had been sitting in front of. Something was \nwrong, the security systems of the ship had picked up a transmission, \ncoming from the brig.\n\nThe Maximal officer taps a few keys, bringing up the contents and \nfurther data on the transmission. It was NOT Maximal, that was for \nsure. He swears, tracking the transmission to the brig CR chamber.\nThe \nother reports, however, didn&#39;t report a bot in it...\n\nChordate swears, pressing a few more keys, a cybernetic gas is \nreleased into the chamber, meant to put the occupant into stasis.\n\n&quot;Rex,&quot; he says into his comm-link to the Maximal on brig duty, \n&quot;There&#39;s a bot sending transmissions from Brig CR 2. There is no \nsignature from it so it must be cloaked. Check it out.&quot;\n\n&quot;On my way,&quot; Rex&#39;s voice replies, Chordate seeing from the scanners \nthat Rex was moving in the direction of the CR.\n\nChordate nods, begining to talk to himself. &quot;Now... To just find the \nbot that the transmission was meant for...&quot;\n\nHe goes to work, tapping more keys.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot smiles, walking after Feline and Skulletron. From what he \ncould hear of their conversations, they were obvioustly Alliance\nbots. \nHe opens his mouth to speak, being stopped by BrightBlade&#39;s \ntransmission. Perndabot sighs. He had been looking for the brig, but \nhad now gotten lost.\n\n&quot;Hey,&quot; he says quietly from behind the two bots, &quot;You Alliance \nmembers?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (Yanshosh has the authorization to use Chordate and Smokescreen \nwhenever he \n&gt; wants due to me having no time to participate with them)\n&gt; \n&gt; Chordate/Smokescreen:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Chordate awoke from his post, looking around.  He heard a loud \nbeeping, \n&gt; pressing a button, it ceased.  Looking over screens of each camera, \nhe saw \n&gt; one that was flashing a light blue.  That meant to tell him where \nthe trouble \n&gt; was.  Looking at the screen, he saw the bot that had been captured, \nor so he \n&gt; thought, who was now free.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;These idiots.  All you have to do is, is watch them?  Is that to \nmuch to \n&gt; ask?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Chordate pressed several commands.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Two autoguns pop down from the cieling, one pointing at \nBrightBlade&#39;s head, \n&gt; one at the back of her knees.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Chordate activated the intercom for that room.  &quot;Attention\nPredacon, \nstay put \n&gt; and don&#39;t try anything, or I will stop you with deadly repeat.  I \nrepeat \n&gt; DEADLY force.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He activated the comm. on a secured Maximal frequency.  &quot;This is \nChordate, \n&gt; attention all available Maximals, a once captured intruder is FREE \nnear CR \n&gt; chamber (instert # here), in sector (insert here).  Get there \nimmediately, \n&gt; watch for autogun fire, and possibly flamethrowers.  Try to take\nthe \nprisoner \n&gt; alive, but you have authorization to use deadly force.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; -----\n&gt; \n&gt; Smokescreen recieved Chordate&#39;s transmission.  &quot;Smokescreen on it.&quot; \nhe \n&gt; replied, taking out his weapon (sprays chemical that knocks people \nout, kinda \n&gt; like skunk&#39;s spray, only more powerful, etc, check in his profile).\n \nHe ra\n\n\n"}}
