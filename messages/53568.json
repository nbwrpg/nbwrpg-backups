He had to assist her. He just had to. She felt inferior \nwith out her amazing abilities to detect things from long distances. \nAnother thing was that she had to get to the Ark. She felt that she \nhad to protect it. \n\nBut before she would go to the Ark, she would find these bases. \n\nRacing a different direction, which seemed forever to her. In her jet \nform, she would be able to cover distances in mere hours. In his \nform, she couldn&#39;t. \n\nHer first task would be to &#39;convince&#39; Wheeljack to recreate her form. \n\nSoon enough, she reached the wreckage. Amazing enough, it didn&#39;t seem \nthat any one had noticed her arrival other than Wheeljack, Ragnar, \nEmpath, Windlord & another. Seemed they gave her no thought. Which \nwas fine with her. As long as they stayed far from her & left her \nalone. \n\n&quot;Wheeljack?&quot; She padded inside the wreck. &quot;Wheekjack?!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
