He had felt a great \npower within him, and with Rodimus there, he felt it even more.  He puts a \nhand on his chest.\n\n&quot;Hmmm?  This is strange, ever since we&#39;ve been talking here together, I \nsense an increase of power in my spark..  I wonder...  Rodimus your plan is \nfail safe, but something inside me is trying to tell me that we should stick \ntogether...   Almost as if....&quot;\n\nStraight Shot transforms and lands between them.\n\n&quot;Power link.  That&#39;s the word you&#39;re trying to get out Tucson, Powerlink. \nY&#39;know?  It&#39;s when two Autobots transform and merge into one highly powerful \nwarrior.  You guys are both Primes, and I bet you two can power link. \nThat&#39;s what that little voice inside you is telling you Tucson.  And that&#39;ll \nexplain the power increaes you feel, whenever you&#39;re with Rodimus.  Well, \nthat&#39;s if it is possible, not sure though..  Just think imagine what you \nguys could accomplish if you could do that?  And Rodimus could become your \neyes and you can become his strength.  And since sometimes you guys have \ndifferent views, you can share them when you&#39;re linked together.  And the \nmore you share, the more well rounded you become.  Knowledge is power, and \nthat&#39;s one thing we got that Hydras doesn&#39;t have.&quot;\n\nTucson turns his head toward Rodimus.\n\n&quot;I - I have never tried that...  That&#39;s up to you if you wish to attempt it, \nRodimus..&quot;\n\nRat Trap steps in.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re missn&#39; out on a power play if ya don&#39;t try it.  Flatten Hydras, \nstomp out those big bad bugs...  Powerlinking will give you guys the umph \nit&#39;s gonna take ta take ta not only exterminate those overgrown pests, but \nit&#39;ll really put Hydras in his place.&quot;\n\nTucson turns to Rat Trap.\n\n&quot; A power play huh?  I&#39;m willing to try it, but Rodimus has to also agree to \nsomething like this.  It&#39;s not something I can do without his permission.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;Atta boy Wheels.  And I can&#39;t think of anyone else who&#39;d make a powerful \nstatement other than you guys.&quot;\n\nTucson turns his head to Rodimus and waits for his reply.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds and does as asked of him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Very well. I&#39;m happy to see that all of you are showing the initiative \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; have faith in the unknown. This will only strengthen our bonds and our\n&gt; &gt; forces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He then turns his head toward the direction of Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I notice you&#39;re a tad quiet Rodimus, I understand if something is \n&gt; &gt; bothering\n&gt; &gt; you and I&#39;m here to listen if you need to get a few things off your \n&gt; &gt; mind. I\n&gt; &gt; realize that you have been through a lot, and most of it unpleasent. I\n&gt; &gt; assure you Hydras will not get away with what he did to you and neither \n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; the rest of his lackies.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A stone solid look of determination comes over Tucson&#39;s face. Like \n&gt; &gt; Optimus\n&gt; &gt; he was not one to shy away from working toward a resolve.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; And if I must, if given the challenge, I will face him if he so \n&gt; &gt; choses, on\n&gt; &gt; a one to one basis. He took something very valuable away from me, my\n&gt; &gt; comrades, and my friends. And now, it&#39;s time I took something away from\n&gt; &gt; him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus shook his head slighly as he turned to leave the room, his\n&gt; strides long and purposeful. &quot;There are so many things to deal with at\n&gt; once.&quot; He said as he walked, his face firm and resolute. &quot;At them\n&gt; moment we have our two objectives, locating and defeating Hydras as\n&gt; well as learning more information about the Insect creatures that we\n&gt; have just encountered.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus turned and looked at the others that had followed him out of\n&gt; the room. He gestured expansively with his his left hand as he\n&gt; continued to hold Elita in his right arm. They had all come to a stop\n&gt; in a large chamber, the bridge was just a litle ahead of them. Cheetor\n&gt; and Lord Elder also made thier way over to joim the group.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tuscon, since you are a Prime now and I am sure you are eager to\n&gt; revisit yourself on Hydras, whoch will leave me to focus on the\n&gt; insectoids.&quot; Rodimus smiled grimly as he tapped his head meaningfully.\n&gt; &quot;I believe that even though they have been able to learn much of us\n&gt; Maximals and Autobots from what was stored in my head, I believe that\n&gt; they left a few tid bits in my head as well.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
