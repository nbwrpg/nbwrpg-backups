I admit I messed up! But\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for the sake of Primus, can we put this behind us and just move on!?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson&#39;s out there with Optimus Primal, Cheetor, Rodimus and now\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Every astrosecond we waste here is one less we have ta find them and get\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &#39;em back safely! And you got Cyclonus&#39;n Scourge ta worry about too! So\n&gt;&gt; &gt; let&#39;s try and work together here and actually accomplish something!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nods.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Look, Dinobot, he&#39;s right, our comrades need us more than ever and we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; really can&#39;t afford ta let them down. Magmatron is out there and unless\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; put our differences aside, like Tucson was attempting to achieve with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; all of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; us, we might as well hand the planet over to that monster and head for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hills. None of us want that, we work too hard to defend what little\n&gt;&gt; &gt; territory we have. Let&#39;s keep it that way. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; She stands up on Quickstride&#39;s rump, on her hind legs.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Tucson started this because he believes that unity is our best weapon\n&gt;&gt; &gt; against a formidable foe such as Magmatron. If we fought separately,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; none\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of us would survive his onslaught. He did this for ALL of us. He didn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have to but he did, and it would be a real slap in the face for him if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; let it fall apart now. Please, we gotta try ta work together, because if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; don&#39;t, we could end up being the losers.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is a watchful smile from AIRHAMMER as he watched the\n&gt;&gt; conversation go back and forth. He is not the long winded sort, and so\n&gt;&gt; stays largely quiet in all of this.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Ahh yes, you were a Maximal at one time weren&#39;t you?&quot; BANTOR said to\n&gt;&gt; the new and improved DINOBOT, &quot;First Predacon, then Maximal and now\n&gt;&gt; Predacon again?&quot; He said as he tilted his head in DINBOT&#39;s direction.\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You seemed to have had an upgrade or two.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BANTOR gestured at DINOBOT&#39;s frame, &quot;You look more like the old\n&gt;&gt; Megatron now, before he went all draconish.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile on the otherside of the clearing SKYSHADOW was still looking\n&gt;&gt; at HYDRAS awaiting his next words and LEO was standing towards the\n&gt;&gt; middle of the clearing, a growing sense of agitation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; WINGCALIBER, TORCA and SANTON were standing next to him, waiting on\n&gt;&gt; the small sidebar conference to end while NOCTORRO was pacing around,\n&gt;&gt; obviously letting his own sense of impatience get the better of him.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
