Our ship is a distinctive one and has \n&gt; been \n&gt; &gt; &gt; connected officially with dozens of terrorist acts, including the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; destruction of some important Tripredacus outposts.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Devilcat considers for a moment.  Activating his comlink, he \n&gt; issues a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; command to the Rogues: &quot;Everyone meet me in the command center - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stat!  We&#39;ve got business to discuss.&quot;  He heads out of the room, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; beckoning Yggdrasil and Jayde to follow him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil came up near Devilcat and looked at the data \n&gt; displayed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: That is a new ship design. Seems like a warship to \n&gt; me, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since it&#39;s new, they might well have lots more where they come \n&gt; from.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That means they&#39;re not alone. As for personel, I can&#39;t say \n&gt; much. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fought Tripreds. But they might be elite, or they might be green\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rookies that have been placed there to man the ship. However, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rookies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could not have landed the ship as successfully as they just \n&gt; did. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is something else. The survivors of the first group probably \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to observe things here and I am convinced that they have \n&gt; gathered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence on most people here. The newcomers now have that \n&gt; edge. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frontal assault is totally out of question.\n\n\n"}}
