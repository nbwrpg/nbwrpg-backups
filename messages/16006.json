He smiled as Spears put her head on his shoulder. \nDeeper \n&gt; and deeper into his web of deception she fell. He wondered that if \nhe \n&gt; removed the chip hat she would still stay with him. But she \nwouldn&#39;t, \n&gt; he knew it. She would turn on him the first chance he got. But \n&gt; nonetheless, she was here, serving him. He called everyone together.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright! We leave very soon to get Ramulus. He will be our link to \n&gt; rule the Maximals. Now, let&#39;s revise the plan. There will be no \n&gt; fighting. Bullet and Blaze, you will stay here and guard the \n&gt; prisoner. Spears, Hammer Ignatius and myself will go on to the Ark. \n&gt; Ignatius and Hammer will be holding Spears tight, and she will be \n&gt; screaming, pretending to be wanting help. You will have to put on \n&gt; your most convincing performance ever. I will tell Ramulus that if \nhe \n&gt; wants you and Striker alive, than he&#39;ll meet me one on one. I&#39;ll \nsay \n&gt; that I&#39;ll exchange the prisoners for a map of all base locations, \nbut \n&gt; when Ramulus comes, we&#39;ll hit him with the chip. We will send him \n&gt; back with Striker, whose memory has been cleared, and he will say \n&gt; that the Maximals have hit a permanent Alliance with The Trainers, \n&gt; and Spears is staying with us as ambassador. Than anytime we want \nto \n&gt; attack, we will have full Maximal support because, well, I will be \n&gt; the leader of the Maximals. Everyone understand?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
