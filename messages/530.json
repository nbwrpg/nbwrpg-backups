She \nbreathed hard as mech fluid began to drip from her lips, her lungs had been \npunctured...she was sure of it!She propped herself up on her elbow.\nIron Raptor looked up slowly and saw Plintissa only a few feet away, she \nreached out to her but then collapsed to the ground. She was tired and \nloosing mech fluid fast, but she wouldn&#39;t risk calling anybot from base with \na battle threatening...not just for her.\nIron Raptor laied on her side, breathing hard but steadily, that Pred could \nfight! She snarled as she slowly began to get up, first on her hands and \nknees, then her knees, finally her feet. She was unsteady but she made her \nway over to Plintissa and dropped to her knees beside her...mech fluid \nflowing from the wound in her chest and dripping from her lips...*\n\n&quot; Are you... alright?&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
