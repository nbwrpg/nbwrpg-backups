It hits in the jungle hard.  The \n&gt; DNA scanners activate and 3 beast modes are chosen.  A brown horse, \na \n&gt; grey horse, and a Rhesus Monkey.\n&gt; \n&gt; Brown Horse: Hey not bad. From now on you guys can call me Mustex.\n&gt; \n&gt; Grey Horse:  Just call me Stallex.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mustex:  Hey what do you want to be called.\n&gt; \n&gt; Monkey:  We&#39;re more animal now than Machine.  And like animals we \n&gt; abandoned our friends at the outpost.  Why fancy up what we are.  \n&gt; Just call me Rhesus.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: The question of what happened to Stallex still applies even \n&gt; though I changed the back story.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rhesus:  I developed a little something I called hover-cycles.  They \n&gt; can go at speeds of up to 200 mph.  Thought you might like to know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rhesus presses a button and 3 come out of the storage room.  He then \n&gt; looks at the readouts of the satalite.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rhesus:  The biggest energon deposite is occupied and far away.  But \n&gt; there is a fair sized one about 25 miles south of here. I think I \ncan \n&gt; still get enough thrust to get the shuttle there, but not to land \n&gt; it.  Believe me when this is over salvage will be the only use for \n&gt; this shuttle.So we better take the hover-cycles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rhesus launches it toward the deposit (no one touch it it&#39;s mine) \nand \n&gt; they take off on the cycles.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; A shuttle plumets towards earth. Abourd it 3 bots try to pick it \nup.\n&gt; &gt; Bot 1: What&#39;s going on?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bot 2: Hate to say this dad but we&#39;re plummting head first into a \n&gt; &gt; planet!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bot 3: This makes no sense! There are transformers on that planet \n&gt; by \n&gt; &gt; my readouts! Also the energon readings are off the scale!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bot 1: Can you get a read out of the larget concentration?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bot 3: No! But I know how we can after we&#39;re down there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bot 3 pushes a button and a sattelite is launched and begins \n&gt; &gt; orbitting (heck I was going to put it up there anyway).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bot 1: Now we just have to survive impact.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They plummet toward Africa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Well, I think that sounds legal. Would you like your word \n&gt; cooked \n&gt; &gt; or raw. Mustex, Stallex, and Rhesus do exist lol.\n\n\n"}}
