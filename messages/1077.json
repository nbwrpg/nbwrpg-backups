It was a beautiful day.*\n&gt;\n&gt; *****************************************************************\n&gt;\n&gt; * Dinobot snarled as the pain increased suddenly but then snapped his head\n&gt; towards Sineses as the Predacon fired upon Tavatron.\n&gt; He was just about to lift his rifle towards the Predacon when the pain\n&gt; overtook him and he dropped it, the gun clattered upon the ground.\n&gt; Dinobot roared as he ignored the pain and moved in front of Tavatron and\n&gt; fired his optic laser at Sineses, but then he almost doubled over in pain\nas\n&gt; it occurredd again.\n&gt; Now he was sure that something had been damaged inside of his body,\n&gt; something vital!\n&gt; Dinobot bowed his head but then looked up and fired at Sineses again, it\nwas\n&gt; not only a battle against an enemy but a battle against how long he could\n&gt; stand this damage of his.\n&gt; The charges intended for Tavatron hit him as he stood in front of him,\nmost\n&gt; hit his shoulders and chest but some hit the areas where the acid had\neaten\n&gt; away his armor and made it weak. All it took was a well placed shot and he\n&gt; would soon have an open chest cavity, his internals would then be\n&gt; vulnerable.\n&gt; Dinobot glared at Sineses, no bot would get past him as long as he was\n&gt; alive!*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Would you like to save big on your phone bill -- and keep on saving\n&gt; more each month?
