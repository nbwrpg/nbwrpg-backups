He stomped the ground shaking the wartorn battlefield. He\nsaw some bots aproaching from different directions. (Lunarpine and\nGrimmler.)\n\nLunarpine reached Megaton first, the wolfbot looked up in awe at what was\nbefore him. &quot;You&#39;re a creation of Veratis, correct?&quot;\n\nThe dragon looked down, wondering what stood before him. &quot;I was created by\nhim, I am my own bot now.&quot; He puffed a cloud of smoke down at the smaller\nbot next to him. &quot;The Predacon files tell me nothing about you, do you cower\nat the thought of battle?&quot;\n\nLunarpine didn&#39;t like being called a coward. He&#39;d die for a cause the same\nas any Maximal.&quot;I never cower.&quot; He sneered looking through the smoke.\n\n&quot;Then you will live a little longer,&quot; The dragon sneered back wanting to\nswallow this morsel whole and let his digestion tear the bot apart. He had\nmore important issues at hand, &quot;Where is your commander? I am here to talk\nwith someone more important than you. Maybe someone the Predacons actually\nhave information about.&quot;\n\nLunarpine was close to losing his temper, he didn&#39;t care how big this\nmonstrosity was he wanted it&#39;s head on his mantle. (If he had a mantle.)\n\nThe dragon just raised his head, looked off into the land and waited for\nGrimmler. Though he didn&#39;t have much information about the aproaching bot at\nleast he knew his name.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, March 06, 2001 5:05 PM\nSubject: Retrieving Maximals\n\n\n&gt; ::Fliq/Grimmler::\n&gt;\n&gt; Fliq stops near the bodies of Dachande and Battera, breathing\n&gt; heavily.
