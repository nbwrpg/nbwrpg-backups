Her left wing had fallen off.  \nAt joint, you could see the metal portion that would be bone, but \nthat wasn&#39;t mech fluid that was leaking out onto the floor.  It was \nred, deep red, blood red. Instead of wired and metal joints, it was \nmuscle and small, extremely tiny fiber wires.\n\nShe lowered her front paw down and picked it up.  She looked at the \nwing in her paw.  She then turned her head to look at her shoulder.  \nIt was red, and the red fluid ran down her back and side. She looked \nat the wing again and then to Veratis, &quot;How...is this..possable? \nAnd...what does it mean?&quot; her voice was soft and inquisitive. She was \nconfused and wanted answers.  She wasn&#39;t mad, or had fear, but wanted \nto know how and why?\n\nShe looked at the wing in her paw,&quot;With out the wing, I am no longer \nShadow Wing.  But what am I?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
