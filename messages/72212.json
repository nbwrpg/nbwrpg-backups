You woke up\n&gt; before me, and battle defending the Ark from hydras, I woke up later without\n&gt; a beast form... we meet briefly and I started the process to take this beast\n&gt; form.. while i was in the Cr you left the base in a mission and dissapeared,\n&gt; then your Dark personalitie appeared again... you mentioned that your were\n&gt; as if you was on fire? Your frame color were Golden, red and oragne and this\n&gt; &quot;said the femme while she touched glenty his chest&quot; looked like real\n&gt; flames.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Why are you so agitate when I mention it?&quot;she said while she looked\n&gt; carefully at his eyes as if she liked to ponder if he was lying her\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight didnt liked to admit it but all her unfortunate adventure was\n&gt; starting to take the toll but she couldnt down the guard. She wanted the\n&gt; true.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;No!&quot; DARK RODIMUS said as he pushed away from NIGHTLIGHT and began\npacing around the room, his movements predatory, aggressive  and\nangry, his optics blazing, &quot;No! I am the only real Rodimus, there is\nno other besides me. I can remember having different colors and when I\nwas a Maximal.&quot; He paused for a moment, not yet looking at NIGHTLIGHT.\n\n&quot;I am no longer a Maximal I am something more.&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I am\nevolving past that. Tuscon and his petty squabbles, wanting to be\nleader, he can have it!&quot;\n\nNow he finally did look at NIGHTLIGHT, &quot;One of the last things I\nremember of him is when he said he would take charge of the Maximals,\nwell they are his now.&quot; He smiled, &quot;And you are mine and so will\nElita! The rest of that light can go to the pit!&quot;\n\nHis smile became even more wicked, &quot;As for what you thought of this\nother Rodimus.&quot; DARK RODIMUS waved a dissmissive hand in the air,\n&quot;Well he is gone now and there is only me now, and I make my own\npath!&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
