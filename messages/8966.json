She decided to sit for a while.  She \npulled the rat from her shoulder and held him. &quot;How does one little \nrodent like me get into these messes anyway? huh? Do you know my \nlittle friend?&quot; She held the rat up to her face  and looked at him.  \nThe rat reached out a paw and touched the end of her nose.  she \nchuckled, &quot;You don&#39;t know either huh? Oh well.  I&#39;ll get us out of \nthis somehow.&quot;  She sat there for a while and didn&#39;t realize that she \nhad drifted off into sleep.\nThe rat crawled up her arm and back to her shoulder.  It curled up \nagainst her neck and slept as well.\n\n\n"}}
