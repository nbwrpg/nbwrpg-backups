The healing\n&gt; tools in this room, rather than being syringes a=\r\nnd scapels, were\n&gt; instead laser cutters and wrenches, along with other ass=\r\norted high\n&gt; tech scanners and devices.\n&gt; \n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nOR perhaps he was overthi=\r\nnking it.  Perhpas he was looking too much over inot what was there, and wh=\r\nat was not.  Perhaps it had come preinstalled, or perhaps whatever base the=\r\ny had taken over.  THere was simply too much he did not know, and he was no=\r\nt a medic, so he could not say.  HE filed away his analysis for later, but =\r\nregistered it as a low priority over on his investigation list.\n\nThere was =\r\nRODIMUS at the cetner of the room, and for now WHEELIE went over towards hi=\r\nm, and debated how much to brief his friend.\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS&#39; optics =\r\nbrightened, &quot;Grimlock!&quot; he said as he swung his legs\n&gt; over the side of the=\r\n bed. &quot;Did I see Grimlock?&quot; He looked around the\n&gt; room and then back at WH=\r\nEELIE, it was as if he were trying to jog a\n&gt; sluggish memory.\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS=\r\n slid out of bed and onto his feet, he was definitly looking a\n&gt; lot strong=\r\ner now. He reached over trying to dislodge the final energon\n&gt; drip that wa=\r\ns still attached to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; He shook his head, &quot;My memory of what brought=\r\n me here is kind of\n&gt; fuzzy.&quot; With an almost startled look he straighted as=\r\n a part of his\n&gt; memory crystalized. &quot;Have you seen Cyclonus here? He was w=\r\nith me when\n&gt; . . . whatever happened.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWHEELIE shook his head, =\r\n&quot;I&#39;m told that CYCLONUS was here, but if he&#39;s around I haven&#39;t seen him nea=\r\nr.  Neither him nor Scourge are about, they seem to be doing without.&quot;\n\nSig=\r\nhing, and elaborating, &quot;As for what&#39;s up wtih GRIMLOCK, I don&#39;t think any c=\r\nan say or say not.  HE and the rest of his DINOBOTS are about, but no one k=\r\nnows for sure or without.  They seem to be smashing around, driving everyon=\r\ne into the ground.  They say there&#39;s some sort of prison ship, under attack=\r\n by someone named MAGMATRON and SABERBACK after a clip.  I&#39;m not sure what&#39;=\r\ns going on, but something is heavily wrong.  GRIMLOCK is after other MAXIMA=\r\nLS, and something pains me to say so, but he seems enraged from the get-go.=\r\n  Within this area of land, we are cut off and must make a stand.  And you =\r\nare in no way ready to go, so we must say here for now and we both know.&quot;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
