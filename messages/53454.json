They&#39;ll pay for that\neventually. What I mean is that however powerful the Preds can seem to\nbe to us, we have no idea of the force the Tripreds have managed to\nbring. Also, if they can manage to bring in such a warship without\nfeeling threatened elsewhere, then the Preds don&#39;t weigh as much in\nthe balance. Face it, Preds have no truly common front politically.\nWhat would the Tripreds gain from their destruction? No. If they&#39;re\nafter something or someone, it has to be after us Maximals. Thus, I\nsay they won&#39;t scrap themselves on such small prey as the Preds.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;&quot;\n&lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Unthreatening?  My friend, you sorely underestimate these \n&gt; machines.&quot;  Devilcat gives Yggdrasil a grim smile.  &quot;Hydras, by my \n&gt; calculation, is the most powerful transformer on this planet.  And \n&gt; for some reason, his ranks seem to include a former member of your \n&gt; own Iron Squad.  This is scarcely a faction to be discounted - the \n&gt; Tripreds can&#39;t hope to eliminate them without at least weakening \n&gt; themselves, and that&#39;s the whole plan.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil shook his head.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: Not if they&#39;re as prepared as they seem to be. My theory \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; that they&#39;ll wipe out the Preds then turn to us. They are definitely\n&gt; &gt; dangerous and we can&#39;t think they&#39;ll grind themselves to death on\n&gt; &gt; something as unthreatening as the Preds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Devilcat::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Perhaps if we could trick the Predacons and Tripredacus into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fighting each other, it would weaken both groups, giving us an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage.&quot; Devilcat suggests.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: I would very much like that solution.
