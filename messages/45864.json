My Geotrons have agreed to go and \nif they don&#39;t instantly offer a treaty when they show up destroy them. \nSo far as I can tell Thunderstorm is undecided.  I said in an earlier \npost Mustex would just let Gorzo sleep since LN left without ever \nposting for him.  So go ahead and let him wake up.  Oh and don&#39;t go \n50 meter to the left, right, or in front of the Geotrons Base intrance \nStallex planted 3 landmines he built from the ruins of Gorzo&#39;s shuttle \nhope you don&#39;t mind.  I asked it I could turn the whole shuttle into a \nnuclear missile, but rAuq said no and Rudra dissapeared.  We&#39;re \nconsidering a restart to the game.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;hugar_twriker&quot; &lt;hugar_twriker@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have finally gotten off punishment so I am back, so what has \nhappen \n&gt; since I been gone?\n\n\n"}}
