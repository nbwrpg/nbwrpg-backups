We do need to start RPing better, and not grow \n&gt; attached to our characters.  I can understand fighting for him, but \n&gt; don&#39;t make it so he can&#39;t die.  I have the same situatin as rAuq \n&gt; where as i would;ve had at least four characters dead without the \n&gt; help of other RPGers.  I vote for a sequal.\n\n\n"}}
