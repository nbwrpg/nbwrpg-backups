She had not realized Dinobot was wounded. \nTavatron dismissed the concern as quickly as it had come to her, if he was \nseriously injured he would tell her. Then again...\n\nTavatron&#39;s worry was finally put to rest when Dinobot transformed. If he was \nwell enough to transform then he was alright. However, when she spoke her \nlatest &#39;insult&#39; she began to worry again. It wasn&#39;t like Dinobot to get so \nstressed out over a simple word, even if it wasn&#39;t spoken in the most \npositive of senses.\n\nShe dropped into a very low crouch when Dinobot glared at her, drawing back \nher head and gazing up at him. She knew that if he got angry enough he could \neasily rip her in two, and no amount of training would be able to save her. \nTavatron&#39;s look  than became one of curiousity, Dinobot didn&#39;t look so angry \nanymore, but he wasn&#39;t exactly looking friendly either. She raised an \neyridge and slowly rose from her crouched position until she was standing \nupright again. Tavatron snarled then smiled when she saw that Dinobot was \nback in the joking spirit again, however she made it a point to ask him \nabout his reaction later, when he couldn&#39;t dodge the question, and when she \nhad a more readily available route of escape:\n\n&quot;I&#39;m a WHAT?!&quot; Tavatron said with mock anger. She was really angry, but the \nlook on her face would have made even her own mother think otherwise:\n\n&quot;Tavatron, MAXIMIZE!&quot;\n\nTavatron transformed and caught up with Dinobot just outside the War Room. \nShe gave him a quick smile before pushing open the door:\n\n&quot;You think you&#39;re so smart, don&#39;t you?&quot; Tavatron held the door open for \nDinobot, waiting for him to enter.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
