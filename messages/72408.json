At this\n&gt; ponit, as he went in to chat with Rodimus, he instinctively checked about\n&gt; the room for booby traps, signs fo security or other such things around.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe room was much like it was when WHEELIE saw it last. The room was\ndominated by the medical bed upon which RODIMUS PRIME lay. The rest of\nthe room was fairly standard for a private repair chamber. A small\ncloset was off to one side, shelves, a small table a computer\ninterface console, presumably for the doctors and staff, but could be\nset to allow the patient limit access as well.\n\nThe only door apparently leading out of the room was the one that\nWHEELIE was using, and there were no windows, the only light coming\nfrom overhead lamps.\n\nRODIMUS looked up as WHEELIE opened the door, he much better than he\ndid last time, his optics bright and clear. &quot;Wheelie!&quot; He said a smile\non his face as he sat up. &quot;Tell me, what&#39;s going on?&quot; RODIMUS gestured\nat the room at large, &quot;These nurses and doctors won&#39;t tell me\nanything.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
