Oh, um by the way, \n&gt; maybe you should thank Tucson for helping you.  After all, he took a real \n&gt; gamble in going back into that tunnel to find you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yeah, it was a real bumpy ride too.  He couldn&#39;t let ya sit there and get \n&gt; destroyed, he risked his spark ta save ya, and I&#39;m glad we got ya back.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson directs an ear toward Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, no one is going to go after you, as long as my spark remains \n&gt; strong.  Rodimus, we&#39;ve been through a great ordeal, but I promise you \n&gt; that no harm to you will go un noticed.  That hive has caused nothing but \n&gt; strife for all of us, and I will not tolerate that happening again.  So \n&gt; here is where we stand..  We have two enemies to vanquish.  Yet in order \n&gt; to stop one, we must stop the other.  We need to know everything there is \n&gt; about those insectoids, and find out their weaknesses, and subdue them. \n&gt; Then, we will deal with what comes afterwards.  I can only hope that all \n&gt; of us, including Windlord, will be able to turn the tables which \n&gt; desperately need turning.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift steps forward.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m in.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap raises his hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Count me in.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Always here ta help.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot salutes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ready ta rumble.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson now puts a hand on Rodimus&#39;s shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So, when you are fully rested, will you do me the honor of rolling out \n&gt; along side me?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;You need to rest, Tucson&quot;replied dryly perceptor&quot;Others can stay with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Santon ran scanners over Tuscon, Bump and Legacy continued to watch\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus, thier optics bright with tension.
