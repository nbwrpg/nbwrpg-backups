Straight Shot too, looks forward as does Quickstride, who d=\r\noesn&#39;t keep his eyes off the front windshield.\n\nFor the most part Tucson Pr=\r\nime had kept his promise to keep everyone safe.  He wasn&#39;t about to put his=\r\n comrades and Perceptor into any more perril.  He locks and loads a few bla=\r\nst cannons located on either side of his front cab, just below the head lig=\r\nhts, just in case he may have need of them.  Quickstride aims outside the p=\r\nassenger&#39;s side window, as Straight Shot gathers back her courage and aims =\r\nout the driver&#39;s side with her forearm affixed to what ever target was movi=\r\nng in on them.  Yet, knowing that Tucson was in charge, Straight Shot and Q=\r\nuickstride wait for Tucson to say the first words.  \n\nSteam vents out the h=\r\nydraulic systems which connect his front cab to his trailer with a loud his=\r\ns.  He then pivots his tires to the right, and makes a firm stance in parke=\r\nd position.  His engine idols with a rumbling noise.\n\n&quot; We know you&#39;re appr=\r\noaching our location.  You will show and identify yourself immediately.  If=\r\n you do not comply, I will be forced to terminate you!  You have thirty ast=\r\nro seconds to come forward!&quot;\n\nThis was it, Tucson Prime was not fooling aro=\r\nund.  More and more his demeanor, and tone of voice resounds more and more =\r\nlike Optimus Prime. His physical features, although silver and black in col=\r\nor, also nearly resemble those of the legendary Autobot leader.  He doesn&#39;t=\r\n cower, and does not move, letting whoever was out there know, that they we=\r\nren&#39;t about to scare him off.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor/Talon:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Something mechanical is a proaching...=\r\n i can sense it... my sensor cant \n&gt; said what is&quot;said dryly the male.

Meanwhile stones and rocks of varying sizes began=\r\n to fall. First\n&gt; &gt; it was grains of sand, then pebbles and then larger and=\r\n larger pieces.\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon continued to push forward, using his great size =\r\nand agility to\n&gt; &gt; move around what he could and to bull his way through wh=\r\nat he\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For the first few minutes it seemed as if a mou=\r\nntain was going to fall\n&gt; &gt; on top of Tuscon and those along with him. Afte=\r\nr they had traveled\n&gt; &gt; several miles the only trembling got worse and wors=\r\ne, as the walls and\n&gt; &gt; floor continued to shake and even split in spots.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;CRASH!!!&lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tons of rock fell behind Tuscon, perhaps a mile =\r\nor so back, falling\n&gt; &gt; between them and the area where the battle had take=\r\nn place, making\n&gt; &gt; that area totally impassable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However the area =\r\nahead was calm as they trembling stopped. A billowing\n&gt; &gt; cloud of dust cam=\r\ne flowing up the tunnel from where the rock had fell,\n&gt; &gt; but so far nothin=\r\ng dangerous was showing itself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ahead sensors could not detect any =\r\nsign of Rodimus, however there was\n&gt; &gt; also no other breaks or branches bre=\r\naking off from their path. There\n&gt; &gt; was only one direction Rodimus and his=\r\n abductor could have gone -\n&gt; &gt; Straight ahead.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The air is in the t=\r\nunnel was getting decidedly cooler as the group\n&gt; &gt; traveled, and up ahead =\r\nPerceptor could catch a slight scent of\n&gt; &gt; something mechanical. What ever=\r\n it was out of range of sensors, but it\n&gt; &gt; was up ahead and they were stea=\r\ndily approaching it!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
