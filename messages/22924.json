But this is one of those things that has to be done I am \nagain sorry.))\n\nDear, Yanshosh, KSL, JP, and Talon.\n\n\n                As all of you know I decided to take on the task of \nrepairing the Ark. My Team of 8 rogues ((That will hereby be referred to as \nthe Wild Cats.)) have been working around the clock nonstop at this point \nhave put in 240 hours of work each. ((Counting Saturday this is not going to \nbe a word problem but that�s the only way I can explain it.)) I am not \nfinished and have some more work to do. I want to put the Ark in space with \nthe Autobots in it when I finished. But a member of the Council says I must \nhave the Decepticons or this will not be allowed as well. I contesting that \nstatement he expects the Wild Cats to defeat the Predacon army. In order to \nfind out from Hellbeast were the Decepticons are that cannot be accomplished \nwithout extreme moding. When I did explain that point he stated launching \nthe Ark is illegal. Based on the mobile base rule that might be waved if I \nwas willing to get the Decepticons from Hellbeast. The mobile base rule \nreads:\n\nSince there have been no mobile bases in the Beast Wars, and also since \nmobile bases give an unfair tactical advantage (and often lead to moding), \nmobile bases (any mobile craft other than a transport pod, one-person \ntransport ship, or something to that extent is considered a base and is \nsubject to this rule) are not allowed.\n\nI do not consider the Ark a Mobile base on the grounds of when launched the \nonly thing in it is going to be the Autobots and teltran 1. The Ark is a \npiece of Autobot history and I�m trying to save it. If anything the ark in \nthat state is mobile transport and the Decepticons are in Hellbeast&#39;s care. \nI don&#39;t think its fare to the Wild Cats and there owner ((Ryo)) to make him \nleave the Ark in that position after that many hour of work because one \nperson things it will make his job easier at the cost of someone else.  Base \nis defined as a point of operations none of the Wild Cats will be operating \nout the Ark once it is launched into space so it not a mobile base it is \nmore of a Transport shuttle for more than the usual number of passengers.\n\n((It is 3:33 A.M. were I am longing a days rest and I broke a bone in my \nfoot training so between the pain killers and the lack of sleep please \nexcuse my less than perfect grammar and the lack of vulgar profanity my \nnormal letters have.))\n\n                                                                             \n                                   Ryo.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
