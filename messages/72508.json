He listens,\n&gt; with eyes shut.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Six figures approaching.  By the sound of their footsteps and their\n&gt; thermal output, they&#39;re a group of Sharkticon guards.  They&#39;re heading our\n&gt; way.  Quickly, find any corner you can find that isn&#39;t exposed to light, and\n&gt; remain silent, with signatures scrambled.  They use signature tracking to\n&gt; hunt down their prey.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes a nimble but defensive pose, ready to defend his comrades if need\n&gt; be\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe SHARKTICON-like guards march down the hall until they get about\nhalfway and then stop at a rather large door, three standing on one\nside of it and three standing on the other side of it.\n\nThe door slides open and SABERBACK stepped out and looked at the\nSHARKTICONS. &quot;Good, you have arrived.&quot; His face was filled with\nimpatience. &quot;Here is, take him.&quot;\n\nAnother figure came walking out of the room, a large figure, large and\nbroad, it was RHINOX!! He came walking out as if he were in some sort\nof trance.\n\n&quot;Take him to his cell.&quot; SABERBACK said. &quot;He is almost finished his\ntreament. It has taken me some time to rebuild him, but he is nearly\ncomplete.&quot; The guards nodded as they began to prod RHINOX with thier\nbutt of thier rifles, forcing him to come back in the direction they\njust came from, which was away from BIG CONVOY, his team and TUSCON.\n\nWithout a further word SABERBACK went back into the chamber, his door\nsliding shut behind him.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
