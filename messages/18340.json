She falls to the ground and \nshakes her head.  She stood up and her body trembled as the maximal \nprogram took over.  She looked at Firearm and Lunarpine.  She had the \nlook of utter confusion on her face. She saw that Firearm was in tank \nmode and aiming at her.  She yelled out, &quot;Please, don&#39;t shoot. Why \nare you aiming at me like that? Why are you trying to shoot me \nFirearm? I didn&#39;t do anything?&quot;  She stood there, scared and \nconfused.  She looked around and then back at Firearm, &quot;Please don&#39;t \nshoot. I didn&#39;t do anything. I&#39;m a maximal, your friend....why?&quot;\n\nThe programs went wild, fighting for control.  Her body shook as the \ntrainer program was about to take over again.  She stood there, her \neyes looking into nothingness as the programs started to change \nplaces again.\n\nShe then faced Firearm as the trainer program took over. &quot;Go ahead \nand shoot Maximal. You don&#39;t have the guts to kill. None of you \nmaximals do.&quot;  She turned and ran again.  She opened her link \nagain,&quot;MASTER PREBON!
