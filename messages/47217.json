I checked the origin of the transmission and it \n&gt; concorded with the base where you are heading. I suggested they \nwould \n&gt; meet you there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Daemos: You have what? What if their intentions are hostiles? They \n&gt; will have time to get ready for a forceful defense and we could \nsuffer \n&gt; great casualties! You idiot!\n&gt; \n&gt; He thought for a minute. Tankor&#39;s silence revealed his great \n&gt; embarassment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Daemos: On the other hand... If they truly wish to work with us... \n&gt; This could make things easier... Hellgate over and out.\n&gt; \n&gt; He thought. This operation was going to be either easier than \n&gt; expected, or a total butchery. The homeworlds could not wait... He \nhad \n&gt; to go on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Daemos: Jetstorm, Anachronox, get ready for vanguard drop. I have \nhad \n&gt; new data. Expect either great resistance or no resistance at all. \n&gt; There could be a group of bots wishing to discuss. That&#39;s where \nthe \n&gt; prophets will come in play. As soon as you three drop, you form \n&gt; Prophetus and lead negotiations. The vanguard drop is in 5 cycles. \n&gt; Understood.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Prophets looked at each other, worried, excited, thoughtful, \nbut \n&gt; nonetheless decided to live up to their name.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan: We are ready, Daemos.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jetstorm: Anachronox, I want to pick the small and many ones.
