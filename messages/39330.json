I&#39;m wondering how he could possibly be \nwinning the council, look what he sent, it&#39;s right below this. Apparently, \nI&#39;m the same person as everyone who wants to use Jume in their posts. Hedge \nis incredibly immature to keep this going on and on. The word incredibly \nshould be emphasized...\n  &gt;&gt;\n\n(Paranoia cannot hinder ones effect in the Council, Hedge will make a fine \nCouncilmember.  Just look at Yan.  He&#39;s still frantically searching for who \negged and TPed his house :)\n\n"}}
