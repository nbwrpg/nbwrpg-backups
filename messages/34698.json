He turns back to Cliffjumper, his eyes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; widening as he sees Astroblast fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Watch out!&quot; he exclaims, firing several laser bolts at\n&gt; Astroblast.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- Astroblast / Switchblade ---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Astroblast transforms into robot mode, and pulls out his gun. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observes the Terrorcons messing with some Maximals, he sees and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hears Megatron going for the big fish, and smiles, deciding not\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bother Megatron till he is in need. He debates quickly about\n&gt; firing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the Element (S) then realizes the futility of the matter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He &gt; decides on a closer, smaller, easier to destroy target,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cliffjumper. &gt; He owed the bot anyways.

He &gt; sneaks over to the battling bot, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attaches an unarmed charge to &gt; his back, in an easy to reach\n&gt; spot. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly leaps back to avoid &gt; gettin noticed, besides by Fireblade\n&gt; who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can see him anyway. He &gt; continues on, dropping a Spider, and\n&gt; using it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as a third eye.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
