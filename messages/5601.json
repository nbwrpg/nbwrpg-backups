It had more of A techno smell then any of os have. I believe \nI smelled some form of exaust, where we burn our energeon remains \ninternally.&quot;\n\nLunarpine was confused from all the events of the last couple days, \nhe was still adapting to this military style of living, and hoped \nthat he wasn&#39;t making a stupid mistake making an indefinite report.\n(He smelled the exaust as Inferno flew away.)\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m in Boston now, and I won&#39;t be able to post as often as I did \nbefore. I&#39;ll \n&gt; still be posting as much as possible, though. I&#39;m still dazed from \nthe \n&gt; flight, so if this post&#39;s a bit strange, please forgive me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, JP, I believe the Autobots arn&#39;t in the Ark, and Ra wouldn&#39;t \nbe able to \n&gt; get in the Ark with all the Maximals in and around it. To do so in \nless than \n&gt; one post (since you never even posted his walking up and entering) \nis pretty \n&gt; bad moding.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Prowl/Striker/Ramulus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl looks at Falcore, slightly confused. He sighs. &quot;I&#39;ll set the \nautoguns \n&gt; to recognize him as enemy,&quot; he says and continues to walk down the \nhall.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl spins around when he hears Lunarpine over his comm-link, \nseeing the \n&gt; maximal as he does so.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Company? Where&#39;d you pick them up?&quot; Prowl asks, taking out his \nscanner.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Striker walks toward his quarters, picking up random important \nstuff to take \n&gt; to the new base.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus blinks as Primal walks up to him, talks to him, and leaves. \nHe nods, \n&gt; galloping off after Primal to see where he was heading to.\n\n\n"}}
