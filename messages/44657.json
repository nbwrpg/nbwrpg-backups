I have been monitoring Abominus&#39; progress in the\nocean. I need you to head into the water and tell him to stop, or he\nwill overshoot his needed position. Spasstik, get me to the repair\nchamber. Astrotrain, check on Soundwave.&quot; At that Spasstik quickly\npadded his way into the base, towards Switchblade&#39;s laboritory, with his\nweakened leader still in his jaw.\n\nHe rounded two corners, then into the elevator. It dropped downwards,\nthen opened up as the wolf emerged from the doorway, and headed down a\nlong coridoor with many rooms on the sides, getting much more technical\nwith more and more equipment in each one, until he reached the end, and\nentered a doorway on his right.\n\nSpasstik emerged in Switchblade&#39;s room, and the small pistol spoke\nagain. &quot;Fix me.&quot; it weakly hissed, as the wolf stood there snarling in\nthe doorway, protective of the gun.\n\n"}}
