She sighed as \nshe then looked up at Gangon, she had heard what he had said about kooks. \nShe snickered, how wrong he was.*\n\n&quot; That isn&#39;t always true, Gangon. Some bots that may seem strange can be \nsmarter then you know. Slag, you say that some bots like Dinobot and \nTavatron are kooks when I know that you&#39;re wrong, that lizardbot of Tvatrons \nthere could rip both you and I apart and not even break a sweat.&quot;\n\n* BrightBlade hated to admit it but there were more powerful bots then \nGangon and herself, even though she knew that her hacking and hot-wiring \nskills were almost unmatched.\nShe popped another piece of fruit in her mouth and chewed thoughtfully, \nyes...there were more powerful bots then Gangon and herself.\nAnother bot that concerned her was that 3ed in command of Liono&#39;s, what was \nher name? Iron Raptor?\nWell, there was a bot with a beast mode that kicked ass, literally!\nBrightBlade smiled, she wondered what sort of prize she would get from Hell \nBeast if she and Gangon could manage to bag that bot!\nIt was risky and she doubted that she could pull it off but just think, a \nbeast mode like that fighting on the Predacons side!\nShe crossed her arms in frontt of her and snickered, that would have to \nworth some type of prize...didn&#39;t it?\nBrightBlade sighed as she extinguished the idea, she would most likely end \nup dead if she so much as tried, she picked off another grape and swallowed \nit. But it was nice to dream.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
