OK WHO said\n&gt; everyone could go in the ark and blow it up. you all are stupid did you\nall\n&gt; not understand if the ark goes very few bots would still exist. there is\nno\n&gt; way any of your guys would have been able to get into the ark except for\n&gt; zergling and Punch. they would have killed each other with the bombs. when\n&gt; Arcangel,Silverbolt, and Brooder arrived they got in the way of the door\nso\n&gt; how the fuck did all these people get into the ark. I say take one of\nthose\n&gt; bombs stick it up zerglings ass. That was the bigest mode I ever heard\nworse\n&gt; then what I do. and if any of you all understand what it means firing\n&gt; rockets down the haul. It maens that when i fire rockets they are heading\n&gt; down the walls of the ship. If you don&#39;t understand that GO TO SCHOOL YOU\n&gt; RETARD. Also logomorgh why do all of your char keep dying? I will leave it\n&gt; at that.]\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
