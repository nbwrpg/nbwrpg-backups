With a few barely audible commands into his comm, \nthe autoguns aim at Starscream again, ready to fire.\n\n&quot;Listen,&quot; Reptilica says, growling, &quot;You&#39;re at the Alliance base, and that \nkind of behaviour will get you killed. On me command, these autoguns open \nfire and kill you. And they&#39;d do the same to Megatron. He&#39;s not a threat, I \ndon&#39;t even think he has a faction to lead.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA shot hits Striker in the back, the Maximal spinning around. He growls when \nhe sees the attackers coming toward the Ark. Didn&#39;t they ever stop?!\n\nHe opens fire on Savage, wondering why these bots were trying to destroy time \nby killing the Ark.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus nods, walking over to Brix and Fliq and helping with attatching the \npanel.\n\n&quot;Think it&#39;ll hold?&quot; he asks, working on it.\n\n"}}
