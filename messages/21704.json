It was an uneventful landing and \nall the systems were still working.  The only unusual thing was that it \nlanded in a field of living llamas.  It didn&#39;t crush them or anything, they \nwere just there.  The bot inside the pod had been altered as it was now \ntransmetal.  With all of these llamas around it is no surprise that it&#39;s \nbeast mode was that of a llama.\n\n"}}
