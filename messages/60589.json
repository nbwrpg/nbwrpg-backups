Gravity shook it and pulled it directly towards a rocky \nformation in the middle of an orchard.\n\nTemplar regained some semblance of consciousness as he saw clouds \npassing around him. He reflexively touched the controls and \nstabilized the pod just enough.\n\nThe fall, however, was far from stable. The pod hit the ground and \nleapt three or four timesin the air and finally stopped at the base \nof the rocky hill.\n\nAll that remained of the pod was a battered hull...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Windlord:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Windlord looked Kenzo and reached him and said &quot;My pal if you \naren&#39;t \n&gt; in conditions to follow up... come back base and use Cr&#39;s&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;CatMaster o&quot; &lt;CatMastero@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord picked the sigan and opened a com link to KEnzo &quot;Kenzo \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pod it&#39;s comming... if you&#39;re in conditions to come join us... \n&gt; it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; maximal....&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord and Blackfang ran toward Pod&#39;s landing coordinates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;On my way&quot; Kenzo said.
