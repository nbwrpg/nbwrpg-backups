I could use someone like you in my quest. \nMy quest is to control all of Cyberton, and having you on my side would \nalmost ensure my victory. If you decide to join me in my quest then ditch the \nother bots with you, whoever they may be and go to this signal, Bazooka will \nbe waiting for you. Magmatron out.&quot;\n    &quot;Bazooka go to sector 324.56 and meet Shredder, If he decides to join us.&quot;\n\n"}}
