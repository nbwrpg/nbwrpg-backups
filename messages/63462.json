He walked up and stood beside Wolfblade, his rifle\nat his side.  He regarded the smaller bot for a moment, tilting his\nhead to the side for a moment.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;I assume you are the one who activated the beacon.  I guess we can\ntell Kup to chill for a bit.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; He then opens a channel to base, informing Kup they had the bot and\nwas ready to return to base.  He didn&#39;t ever think his appearance\nwould be threatening in anyway, he did look scary according to a few\nsources.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
