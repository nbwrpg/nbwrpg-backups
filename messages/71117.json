Instead he responds to Hydras=92 call to targe=\r\nt the Ark=92s door. With a quick twist and flare from his boosters he lines=\r\n himself up with Hydras and prepares to follow his orders. \n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Qu=\r\nickstride now gets sick and tired of Waspinator&#39;s torment as he too, breaks=\r\n out the big guns against his flying foe.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yeah, well, I&#39;m gettn&#39; prett=\r\ny sick of you dropping your bombs on me too, bug aft!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He throws contin=\r\nuous rounds from his large blast cannon while deflecting Waspinator&#39;s blast=\r\ns.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;TIME FOR SOME MAJOR PEST CONTROL! THIS&#39;LL MAKE YA WISH YA NEVER GOT=\r\n OUTA YOUR HIVE THIS MORNING!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As it was for equine nature, Quickstride=\r\n shows a severe dislike to Waspinator, hoping one day he would swat the ser=\r\nvos out of him in his wasp mode, with his long, copper tail while in his ow=\r\nn equine beast mode.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIt would seem that Quickstride is more success=\r\nful against Waspinator than Uproar was against Cyclonus. Quockstride=92s la=\r\nrge blast cannon fires repeatedly into the air keeping the vicious Predacon=\r\n at bay. One of his attacks catches him in the fuselage sending Waspinator =\r\nspinning through the air once more, smoke trailing behind him. \n\n=93Waspina=\r\ntor hate all this!=94 he said as he sailed away! \n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord an=\r\nd Kup continue firing against Scourge and Deepstrike.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt; \n\nAs Windlord =\r\nand Kup continue their firefight, Scourge swung out around them, forcing th=\r\nem to change their attacks and swing with him. Meanwhile Deepstryke moved h=\r\nigher up and the other way, swinging his multiple cannon mounts around at t=\r\nhe same time. However instead of firing at Kup or Windlord he targets the d=\r\noor to the Ark! \n\nMEANWHILE INSIDE THE ARK:\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; He thinks for a mo=\r\nment. This was a great way to communicate because Nightrazor may not have a=\r\nny idea that Tucson was still able to communicate in this mode. He raises a=\r\nn optic and continues to tap his shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t take this the wrong =\r\nway Rodimus, but it&#39;s the only way we can communicate in a way that Nightra=\r\nzor has no notion of us doing so. Feel free to do the same, use the morse c=\r\noding, it will help us understand each other to apprehend him sufficiantly.=\r\n&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Tuscon had his hands on Rodimus to pass the message he could f=\r\neel Rodimus move in the darkness, presumably nodding his head in understand=\r\ning. =93Gotcha!=94 Rodimus tapped back, knowing the code Tuscon was using. =\r\n\n\n=93Need move quick=94 Rodimus tapped back quickly, =93Intruder not wait u=\r\ns talk.=94\n\nRodimus motioned for them to spread out, =93Your senses better,=\r\n find switch=94 he tapped again. \n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; He stops to feel the vibrati=\r\nons of the floor. Then he puts out his hand to sense vibrations in the air.=\r\n Through that, he could get a faint idea as to how the air circulates aroun=\r\nd various objects. A cross breeze as stale as it was, would navigate him to=\r\nward an emergency generator switch. He follows that breeze, and extends his=\r\n hand out to touch it, slowly comming to the device. With another raise of =\r\nthe brow he carefully throws the switch and waits to see what happens.\n\n&lt;NE=\r\nW&gt;\n\nActually as Tuscon was just about to the generator control, but before =\r\nhe could pull it he found that he did not need to! \n\nIn moving he had stepp=\r\ned out of the field of darkness and with a blink he could hear and his rada=\r\nr/sonar snapped back on, all sensors were a go! \n\nHowever any scan back to =\r\nwhere he came from would show that where he was standing there was a large =\r\nball of darkness several meters across that he could not scan, it was a glo=\r\nbe of darkness and silence.  \n\nRodimus stepped out of the other side of the=\r\n globe blinking also obviously his sensors were coming back online too. He =\r\nlooked around, =93Where is the . . . . \n\n&gt;&gt;KABOOM!!&lt;&lt;\n\nWith a deafening exp=\r\nlosion the main door exploded off its hinges as the combined power of Cyclo=\r\nnus, Hydras, Deepstryke and several other predacons blasted it! Fortunately=\r\n the fallen bodies of the Autobots and Decepticons were too far away to rec=\r\neive more than a little rumbling and smoke, nothing that would significantl=\r\ny impact their slumber and their eventual awakening. \n\nMeanwhile . . . \n\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We must be carefull&quot;said Talon with a moan, the pain was unbeara=\r\nble.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Can you set me in stasis???&quot;sais Talon with pain&quot;I donat know how=\r\n \n&gt; much longer i could bear this pain...&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nEvidently whomever had p=\r\nlaced Talon down had left Talon is a well shielded place, there was no dama=\r\nge to this Maximal as well. The console that was between Talon and the door=\r\n snapped off and was flung across the room, but Talon continued to lay ther=\r\ne, his systems merciful shutting him down, sending him into stasis lock.\n\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor tried to seal all the corritors that lead to the sleep=\r\n \n&gt; decepticons and autobots. He worked as fast as he could.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nPercep=\r\ntor could not seal off the room that the Autobots were in simply because th=\r\ne front chamber leading into the Aark was one large chamber. It was not unt=\r\nil they got further in that it branched off into other sections. \n\nHowever =\r\nwith a small beep the computer came fully to like. =93Main power restored.=\r\n=94 The computer said calmly.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Mom...&quot;said Elita with fear, an=\r\nd she ran towards the Medical bay, \n&gt; she almos couldnt hold her tears. She=\r\n was fearing that somethign \n&gt; really bad had happened to her.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRamu=\r\nlus ran as well to the medical chamber, the whole way, glancing back at Eli=\r\nta to be sure that she was keeping up. When they got there the door was loc=\r\nked, sealed with a medical privacy code. \n\n=93FRAG!=94 he said as he tried =\r\nthe door. =93With the power down it won=92t recognize me.=94 Then with a hu=\r\nm the lights began to come on in the hall and the door began to buzz as it =\r\nscanned Ramulus. =93Identity Ramulus detected and confirmed.=94 The door sl=\r\nid open\n\nRamulus leaped inside and looked around, and in one corner, there =\r\nwas Nightlight laying on her bed, unconscious, but other wise okay. =93O Pr=\r\nimus!=94 Ramulus said in relief as he looked over the readings. =93He was n=\r\no doctor, but to him everything looked okay.\n\nMeanwhile through the rest of=\r\n the Ark lights began to flicker and blink as main power began to reassert =\r\nitself. The computer=92s voice could be heard echoing off several panels as=\r\n it worked through an internal diagnostics check, =93Predacon signatures de=\r\ntected.=94 \n\nIn the room with Perceptor the computer began quickly pin poin=\r\nting the various signatures both inside and within a mile of the Ark outsid=\r\ne.\n\nBACK OUTSIDE THE ARK:\n\nAt the same time Torca, Noctorro, AirHammer, Qui=\r\ncksilver and Bantor, the Maximal Fuzors took this moment of distraction to =\r\nrush the Predacons cannons blazing!\n\nSeveral sweeps fell from the skies and=\r\n Scourge as well took another hit, this one sending a sizzling burn up the =\r\nside of his flank. \n\nCyclonus was also hit, although he was able to twist i=\r\nn the air, turning what would have normally been a devastating blow into on=\r\ne that glanced off his armor. \n\nDeepstryke was hit several times, forcing h=\r\nim to back off, his boosters flaring as he began to retreat. \n\nInferno also=\r\n was damaged as he took a hit that was designed for Hydras, the hit sent In=\r\nferno spiraling towards the ground as well. \n\nAs powerful as the Predacons =\r\nwere, they did not have all their forces there, and the Maximals were final=\r\nly getting their own forces together.
