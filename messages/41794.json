But recently, he&#39;s been missing.  I have no idea where he went.&quot;\n\n&quot;Heh.  I serve the Alliance, as you&#39;ve probably guessed, under Zardus,&quot;\nComposer said.\n\n&quot;Oh.  Interesting.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah.&quot;\n\nIt seemed the conversation bewteen the two brothers was getting nowhere.\nThen, that&#39;s when the question popped up.\n\n&quot;Orchestra, would you.....join the Alliance?  For me?&quot; Composer asked.\n\nOrchestra didn&#39;t quite know what to say.\n\n&quot;Uh well....I would....but-&quot;\n\n&quot;But what!?&quot; Composer cut off.\n\n&quot;Well, you see.....I have a special somebody in my faction...&quot; Orchestra\nsaid.\n\n&quot;Hmm?&quot;\n\n&quot;Her name&#39;s Blacknightmare.  I&#39;m in love with her, and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m\nready to leave here,&quot; Orchestra said.\n\n&quot;Well, I&#39;d like it if you made your decision soon.....&quot; Composer said.\n\n&quot;Umm......I think I&#39;m gonna need some time to talk to her about this....&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, okay, you make your decision right though, brother,&quot; Composer said.\n\nThings were silent for a moment.  Then, the same thing went through the\nminds of both brothers.\n\n&quot;What happened to Symphony?&quot; Orchestra managed to ask it first.\n\n&quot;I haven&#39;t seen him.  He must&#39;ve went off course too.  If he&#39;s still alive\non this rock, I&#39;ll be damned if we find him,&quot; Composer said.\n\n&quot;Yeah.  You know, he&#39;s probably with the Maximals!&quot; Orchestra said.\n\nComposer and Orchestra both laughed.  Little did they know that they were\nactually right.\n\n&quot;Well, I think I&#39;ll stay here for a while,&quot; Orchestra said, remembering his\nreal mission.\n\n&quot;Alright.  Would you like me to give you a tour?&quot; Composer offered.\n\nOrchestra figured this would be the perfect chance to get to know the base\nand perhaps get information.\n\n&quot;Yes, brother, that would be nice,&quot; Orchestra accepted.\n\nThe two got up, then Composer went to give Orchestra a tour.  Orchestra\nfollowed...\n\n\n"}}
