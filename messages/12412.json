Several days passed \nwithout \n&gt; incident with other bots, thank Primus. No sightings meant that \nthey \n&gt; weren&#39;t going to report that Rattrap was around, so they wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; take that to Hell Beast. \n&gt; \n&gt; Running was his only option. It wasn&#39;t his best idea, but it got \nhim \n&gt; away from the torcher chamber. He sniffed around the exit-way of \nhis \n&gt; little den, shaking his whiskers, testing the air, making sure no \none \n&gt; was around, then he pulled his body out of it. He looked around. \nAll \n&gt; clear, just like everyday.\n&gt; \n&gt; He went deeper inside of the forest where he found more edible \n&gt; berries. Those things were the only thing keeping his stomach from \n&gt; aching from hunger. He stood up and leaned on the branched, pulling \n&gt; the red berries off with his front teeth.\n\n\n"}}
