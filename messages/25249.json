Ironraptor you are weak. you \nwould let your guard down so Zardus and the alliance can stabbs us in the \nback. no the maximals will never fall not today not ever. To all maximals \nthis is Angel Prime. you have two choices give up everything you ever fought \nfor and all you dreams and hopes so the Alliance can walk over us. Or you \ncan push back and fight the alliance to the bloody end. and go out with some \npride. Ironraptor is not the leader she wants was. lets not fail.&quot;\n\n\nAngel Prime flys up and opens his wing wide and starts firiing little fire \nlike rain but it pure fire.\n\n\n\n\n[just to point this out on behalf os Soulstice. she has a point you notice \nthat every time the alliance attack the maximals they lose. The ark got \ndestroyed by them.]\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
