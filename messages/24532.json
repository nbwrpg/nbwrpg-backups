His DNA donor had loyal\nfollowers but he could still be overthown when the time was right. Megatron\nwas the old model, the time was near for him to be replaced with the new\nimproved version. &quot;Lead the way megatron.&quot; he stated, not allowing Megatron\nto stab him in the back. Megaton looked around thinking about the odds. Soon\nthe odds wouldn&#39;t matter since he&#39;d been given a rank and title for the\nother Predacons to follow.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;JP3884@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, December 24, 2000 11:20 AM\nSubject: Battle\n\n\n&gt;     Tarantulas, in his vhicle mode, flew off his tires as al lthe shots\naimed\n&gt; at him impacted. He gathered his thought, and sent a batch of eight\ncluster\n&gt; missles at EndBringer.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Tankkor growled as he was pelted with blasts. He turned and sent his\nmian\n&gt; laser turret blast at Killfest.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Nighteyes covered her head, and with a bleeding hand, began to unload\non\n&gt; Greven.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Aerostreak dove into Killfest, sending them both skidding across the\n&gt; forest floor. (Hope you dont take that as a mode, sorry if you do.)\n&gt;\n&gt;     Akron pickes her target. She see&#39;s Darkmouse and Scather, (Well,\ndosent\n&gt; actually see Scather) and sends several Energon bolt blasts at them.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Putnam spots Golden eyes, and takes off into the air. He extends his\n&gt; hands and manages to grab hold of her leg, and begins to drain some energy\n&gt; out of her.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Odiphious takes his riffle out and fires at Drillbit, and then sends\nan\n&gt; energon bolt at him.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Venus, armed with an energon pistol, fires at Dollen. She is stil\nlsore\n&gt; from a hit she took in the shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Megatron turns to Megaton. &quot;Come on, Megaton, Marine, Pheniox, Jackle,\n&gt; and Gremlin. Youre all coming with me to help out in the forest. Lets go.&quot;\n&gt;     Megatron was finally going to strech his legs after beening cooped up\nin\n&gt; the ice cave for so long.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
