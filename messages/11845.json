She \nhit the hull then slid to the ground.  She landed and shook her \nhead.  She transformed into porcupine mode and turned her back to the \npreds.  She spun around throwing 10 quills at them.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Lord Unitron&quot; &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The Oblitercons/Nemesis \n&gt; Enforcer/Scattershot/Zergling/Oinker/Punch/Ramhorn:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Breakdown cursed as a quill barely cut into his armored cannon \nmode, \n&gt; soon laughing, firing off another shell at Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hiss yelled, a spear slicing open his left side.
