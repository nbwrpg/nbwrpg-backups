It went near and immediatly realized it was emitting its wave\n&gt; of panic. It stopped at once.\n&gt; \n&gt; ???: Are you all right?\n&gt; \n&gt; It passed a hand over Darkangel&#39;s head, instantly stopping the\n&gt; panic-induced stasis lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; ???: Forgive me, I did not realize my capacities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Surprisingly, the voice was soft.
