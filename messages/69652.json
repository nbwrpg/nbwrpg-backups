The jolt=\r\n is enough to return his energy levels to a reasonable percentage, but not =\r\nenough to unfreeze his body.

Ever - hear of the - term, Classified informat=\r\nion?  Well, that&#39;s what my information is.  Classified.&quot;\n\nHe says in a cold=\r\n tone of voice to Zarak.  His optics narrow fiercely.\nHe was not through fi=\r\nghting yet.

There was =\r\na part of him that wanted to blast the little Predacon for daring to tell h=\r\nim anything. But the ugly thing was that Zarak still needed the extra force=\r\ns that Hydras and his Predacons brought to the table.\n&gt; \n&gt; So rather than c=\r\nommanding his Scorponok unit to open fire on the base he just nodded and sa=\r\nid, &quot;I apologize, I have overstepped my place.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Cyclonus and=\r\n Scourge continued to face down Dark Rodimus, the air was tense as Dark Rod=\r\nimus&#39; optics stared into Cyclonus, niether of them ready to back down, both=\r\n of them remembering the last battle they fought!\n&gt; \n&gt; However it was Perce=\r\nptor that broke the deadlock as he continued giving orders . . . \n&gt; \n&gt; (PAS=\r\nTE)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The rest, we have to Keep an eye in maximal base things are beco=\r\nming\n&gt; &gt; interesting lately there, Rodimus... I need you for task&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n affect of the command was almost instant as Rodimus stepped back from Cycl=\r\nonus and Scourge and looked over at Perceptor. &quot;What&#39;cha need Percy?&quot; Rodim=\r\nus said to Perceptor, happy for the moment that it was Perceptor and Hydras=\r\n giving orders and not Cyclonus and his lap dog.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus, seeing the =\r\nbreak in the tension also stepped back, pulling Scourge back with him. &quot;The=\r\nre will be another time Scourge.&quot; he said quietly, &quot;No need to fight this o=\r\nut here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Scourge nodded, &quot;Yes, there will be.&quot; he said darkly. His op=\r\ntics still watched Rodimus, his look almost hungry as he smiled evilly.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; As the tensions between Cyclonus, Scourge and Rodimus cooled Zarak turned=\r\n to look at Tuscon, wondering what information this bot could hold. &quot;Come&quot; =\r\nZarak said to Darkhawk, &quot;Let&#39;s see what this Auto . . . &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *BEEP*\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nZarak was caught in mid sentence by his scanner going off, the hand held on=\r\ne that he had been keeping trained on Tuscon.

It was located somewhere near Tuscon&#39;s head.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Zarak stepped forward to take a more careful scan . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOOC: Yup, the same scanner he had been scanning him with a few posts ago.
