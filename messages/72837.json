And=\r\n DRILL BIT is a known Predacon, generally regarded as little more than &#39;dum=\r\nb muscle&#39;.  Of course, that might be entirely what he wants them to think..=\r\n.  http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Drill_Bit_%28BW%29  and   http://tfu.info/1997/Pr=\r\nedacon/DrillBit/drillbit.htm\n\n&lt;OLD - TUSCON&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The tunnel was continuin=\r\ng to slope downward the hum was steadily\n&gt; getting more prounced. It was mo=\r\nre of a low level vibration rather\n&gt; than a true sound. Perhaps it was a ma=\r\nchine of some sort, perhaps it\n&gt; was something else.\n&gt; \n&gt; TUSCON had just t=\r\nurned another corner, using the rocks and stones as\n&gt; cover to keep himself=\r\n out of sight when . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n&lt;OLD - DRILL BIT&gt;\n\n&gt; DRILL BIT&#39;s sensors we=\r\nre a bit off now as well. While he was somewhat\n&gt; shielding by being underg=\r\nround and his hearing was good enough to\n&gt; detect the footsteps of TUSCON a=\r\ns he passed by, still the ever growing\n&gt; sensor distortion field was throwi=\r\nng off even his keen senses just a\n&gt; bit.\n&gt; \n&gt; For TUSCON he saw a CYBERTRO=\r\nNIAN of unknown faction rise from the\n&gt; ground, bursting from the very dirt=\r\n and stone! (OOC: DRILL BIT)\n&gt; \n&gt; However unfortunately as IFF signatures w=\r\nere down there was no\n&gt; immediate way for TUSCON to determine who he was or=\r\n his factional\n&gt; origin.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFor the moment, as the PREDACON dug ove=\r\nr through the tunnel, and hten popping out a moment later  the PREDACON tra=\r\nnsformed out of his beast mode over to his robot.  &quot;Maximals.  YOu have oth=\r\ner whelps with you.&quot;  Hissing over and holding his arms up in front of him,=\r\n his weapons charged but not shooting at them.\n\n\n&lt;OLD - TUSCON&gt;\n\n\nTucson co=\r\nntinues to watch Drill Bit carefully. He also knew that his dragon\nmode was=\r\n a little bit more suited for dealing with strangers since it was easy\nto w=\r\nard them off as a large predator. He makes the transformation as silently\na=\r\ns possible and then remains hidden, but with a little bit of a rumbling gro=\r\nwl\nto his voice. It would be just enough to make himself heard and determin=\r\ned as\nan apex predator who is not to be toiled with.\n\n&lt;NEW - VICE GRIP&gt;\n\nOO=\r\nC - And VICE GRIP would be barely known by anyone at all, even on Earth.  H=\r\nE was one of Megatron&#39;s flunkies on Cybertron &#39;before&#39; he went to the Beast=\r\n Wars and wasn&#39;t among the group Megatron took to Earth or was part of the =\r\nGolden Disk raids.  So the most likely person who would be somewaht familia=\r\nr with him is someone who&#39;s in the Cybertronian Law Enforcement division, a=\r\nnd thus would be familiar with Predacon criminals and underworld types.  He=\r\n would most likely register as unknown other than Predacon allegiance on IF=\r\nF if that worked, though I&#39;m fine with someone knowing a bit about him.  Ju=\r\nst be realistic over in how they got that data - Big Convoy is much likelie=\r\nr to have a whiff of an idea of who a relatively minor Predacon with a repu=\r\ntation for being a thug than Tuscon is, for example.\n\nFor the moment, VICE =\r\nGRIP stayed behind over DRILL BIT as the Bugacon popped out into the cavern=\r\n, and remained relatively stealthed behind them, but at the close range in =\r\nthe tunnels he was fairly easy to spot on, as well as his noted staying bac=\r\nk and away, nots peaking.\n\n\n"}}
