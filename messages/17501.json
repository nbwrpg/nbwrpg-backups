That made 8 bots, all out to rescue Striker\n&gt; and Spears.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Then we&#39;ll need to get them and programm them back to Maximal, I guess.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Cloaked on his cliff, Slayer scans the area, searching for any Maximals.\n&gt; Catching a glimpse of Ramulus in the distance, Slayer&#39;s face twists into\nan\n&gt; evil smile.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They are on their way, Master,&quot; he says into his comm-link, watching\nRamulus\n&gt; carefully.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
