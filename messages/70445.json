He radios quickly to Lord \n&gt; Elder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, the Ark is registering Perceptor as an enemy, I need time to \n&gt; help him attain the Maximal/Autobot signature so that way harm can be \n&gt; avoided, over.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He stops just before getting to the Ark.  He knew that if he advanced now, \n&gt; he could endanger his new found comrade and Talon as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the Ark, Rat Trap quickly mans the computer as his fingers tap \n&gt; feverishly on the keyboard.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Aww Slag, if we don&#39;t change Perceptor&#39;s signature Wheels will also be a \n&gt; gonner!  Lord Elder, I can do this, I&#39;ve done it before!  Just say the \n&gt; word and it&#39;s done.  This is Rat Trap ta Wheels and Perceptor, Over, \n&gt; better stay where you are for now, I know I can convert Perceptor&#39;s \n&gt; signature but I&#39;m gonna need some time ta do that, and of course, \n&gt; permission ta access his signature files. Once that&#39;s done, it&#39;ll only \n&gt; take a few minutes ta change it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson replies.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Noted, I&#39;ll wait here.  Thank you Rat Trap.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride takes some time to reflect the condition of Rodimus, to the \n&gt; others.  He sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Well, judging by the way those insects drained his energy, he&#39;s gonna \n&gt; need one heck of a jump start after that.  And I dunno if this is true, \n&gt; just a hunch I&#39;m gettn&#39;, but I think Tucson Prime&#39;s got enough in his \n&gt; power core ta give Rodimus Prime the jump start he needs.  I know that&#39;s \n&gt; what he&#39;d wanna do.  All that power and strength..  He doesn&#39;t wanna just \n&gt; keep that to himself, I fully believe that Tucson would rather save \n&gt; someone else than save himself. We saw that taday, when we were in that \n&gt; tunnel. He could&#39;ve just left Rodimus down there, but he risked his spark \n&gt; ta go back down and attempt a rescue.  And then when we were all leaving, \n&gt; he chose ta come up last, and waited until everyone else was safe. There&#39;s \n&gt; something inside him that is a little bit different than Optimus..  Just a \n&gt; little bit, not much. It&#39;s one of those things you can&#39;t put your finger \n&gt; on.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The trip to the Ark was largely uneventful and relatively short. As\n&gt;&gt; they moved across the broken terrain they drove past were it looked as\n&gt;&gt; if a massive battle of some sort had taken place some time ago. This\n&gt;&gt; is obviously were the minions had made their attack on the Ark several\n&gt;&gt; months ago. Only now was the scorched ground begining to heal as weeds\n&gt;&gt; and different wild grasses were begining to peak out from beneath the\n&gt;&gt; rocky grounds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The Ark is as Tuscon and the rest left it. Even for Perceptor, the Ark\n&gt;&gt; has not changed appreciatively since the last scans he had recieved\n&gt;&gt; from it. A broken ship lying partial entoumbed in the side of a mid\n&gt;&gt; sized mountain.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Tuscon and those that were with him approached the Ark the Ark\n&gt;&gt; computer voice could be heard, &quot;Predacon signature detected.&quot; The Ark\n&gt;&gt; shields snapped into place as the base went on alert and weapons began\n&gt;&gt; to target Tuscon . . . or perhaps someone he&#39;s carrying.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
