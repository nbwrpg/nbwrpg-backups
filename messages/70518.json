I had been working with Lord P=\r\nerseus, a commander of the Maximals of Atlantis, we left, and happened upon=\r\n a planet, where we came in contact with an old Maximal base. From that bas=\r\ne, I learned of what had happened to my commander, and comrade, Rodimus Pri=\r\nme. He had been abducted by Hydras, and turned against his faction forceful=\r\nly. I heard of what happened and I knew I had to begin my own quest to try =\r\nand recover Rodimus, no matter if I was destroyed in the process while doin=\r\ng so. I traveled to the Black Fortress, where I had learned the whereabouts=\r\n of Dark Rodimus, who was Rodimus but reprogrammed into a darker figure and=\r\n turned into a slave of Lord Hydras. It was a long battle, and at first, I =\r\ndid not succeed. I was rescued myself by a tiny Maximal, named Rat Trap, wh=\r\no I could see desperately needed a friend, and in saving me, he found one a=\r\nnd so did I. He called for backup and I was recovered by Lord Elder, a lead=\r\ner of a Maximal group. He had faithfully guarded the Autobot Ark until such=\r\n time that an Autobot would return to restore what was lost. It was there w=\r\nhere I was lead to the body of Optimus Prime, and it was there where the Ma=\r\ntrix of Leadership granted me it&#39;s power and I was given the power of the P=\r\nrimes. Now, before this, I was known as just Tucson, an average Autobot, wh=\r\no fought faithfully in the wars, but suffered a great defeat which left me =\r\nvisually impaired even today. But for some reason, right now, it seems to h=\r\nave corrected itself. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He shifts his weight and then begins to tel=\r\nl the rest of the tale.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; That leads me to your question Vestige. W=\r\nhen I was at the Black fortress, I released a bolt of energy from my spark,=\r\n which supposedly was supposed to heal Rodimus of any possession that Hydra=\r\ns may have had over him. Not at first though. He had recovered a small frac=\r\ntion of his old self but was quickly overcome by the evil once more. But it=\r\n was not until he had sensed something within him that he made the change b=\r\nack to his normal self. So, we all began to proceed out of the Black fortre=\r\nss, only to be entrapped by another enemy. An enemy which was insectile, an=\r\nd arachnid in nature. Rodimus told me to run, and at first I did, but in my=\r\n spark I knew I could not abandon him. So, I went back and proceeded to sea=\r\nrch for Rodimus along with my comrades. Once we found him, he was bound by =\r\ncountless numbers of dangerous tendrills, and the only way for me to save h=\r\nim, was to lend my spark in efforts to save his. And that is how I got here=\r\n. I will do what ever it takes to recover Rodimus. I lost him three times, =\r\nI will not lose him again. I could have fought the arachnids, but I saw som=\r\nething disturbing in them. Their colors, they were the same as Rodimus Prim=\r\ne&#39;s.. The bright reds, oranges and yellows of his armor and vehicular form.=\r\n There is more to defeating the evil than meets the eye and perhaps you may=\r\n be able to tell me about this place, and from there I can compile a strate=\r\ngy to get Rodimus back. I don&#39;t want to make any foolish moves if I don&#39;t h=\r\nave to.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclo=\r\nnus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson puts his hands up i=\r\nn submission, to show that he meant no harm.
