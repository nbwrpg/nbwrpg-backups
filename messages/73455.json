Spin, dodge, duck, block,\n&gt; feint!\n&gt; \n&gt; She move an=\r\nd stuck with such lighting speed and agility that was\n&gt; difficult to follow=\r\n never mind match! Leaping through the air as a\n&gt; blade seemed to flash out=\r\n from no where and block DINOBOT&#39;s attack!\n&gt; She flew back with a defensive=\r\n kick as she moved.\n&gt; \n&gt; She was both defense and offense moving with a str=\r\nange fluid grace!\n&gt; \n&gt; Landing on the ground several meters behind where sh=\r\ne stood before her\n&gt; blade now in her right hand spinning as she readied it=\r\n, ANTAGONY\n&gt; oriented her blaster at DINOBOT with her left!\n&gt; \n&gt; ANTAGONY l=\r\nooked at the others, &quot;Are you guys idiots! I tell you that\n&gt; your universe =\r\nis about to tear apart and you want to capture me?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Of course.&quot; CRYOT=\r\nEK said. &quot;After all, we cannot know what other\n&gt; secrets you are hiding fro=\r\nm us.&quot; He manipulated a device in his hand,\n&gt; the very same one he used to =\r\nshut down TARANTULUS&#39; weaponry a few\n&gt; moments ago. &quot;Such as how to turn su=\r\nch a thing to our own advantage.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind ANTAGONY a pair of steel cabl=\r\nes began to snake forward with\n&gt; manacles opened up as if to capture her. H=\r\nowever at the moment\n&gt; ANTAGONY did not appear to be aware of as her focus =\r\nseemed to be on\n&gt; DINOBOT as she watched him for another attack!\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;=\r\n\n\nDINOBOT had fought better than her.  DINOBOT had seen better than her.  B=\r\nut that did not chnage the point that she was better than him.  Having enga=\r\nged wtih superior fighters did not mean that one was superior to their oppo=\r\nnent, after all.\n\nEach assault he made was disrupted as fi she was reading =\r\nhis spark, even when his body was on full blow assault.  Each coutner count=\r\nered. Each impact turned against him as he went at her in a rage.\n\nHer form=\r\n was more fluid, more graceful than his brutal Metallikido which preferred =\r\nmaximum efficiency, and she was in a word of a martial arts master &#39;showing=\r\n off&#39; as she sent him stumbling away and falling to the ground as he hit an=\r\nd rolled, slowly getting up.\n\n\n\n"}}
