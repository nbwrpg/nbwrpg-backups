He looks down, the bots on the ground looking like tiny ants. They \nwere really pissing him off. Mech fluid was leaking through the cracks in his \narmor, and his optics were running a bit low on power. He takes out a charge, \ndropping it onto the bots on the ground, firing at Terrorsaur with all three \nof his guns.\n\nHe growls as shots from the Autoguns nearly hit him, gliding down to Adrax.\n\n&quot;The battle seems to have evened out, lets get out of here,&quot; he tells the \nother bot, ready for further attacks.\n\n"}}
