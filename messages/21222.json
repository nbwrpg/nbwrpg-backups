He had some \nkind of plan.&quot; He shrugged his wings. &quot;I didn&#39;t get much information \nthat I wanted to. When I lost sight of Megatron, I left, and I think \nI got frost bite on my wings on the way back.&quot;\n\n&quot;Big whoop,&quot; Quickstrike said sarcasticly. &quot;Coulda done better on the \nspyin&#39; job.
