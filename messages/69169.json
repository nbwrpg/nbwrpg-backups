With a short burst of power they fired,\n&gt; cutting Scorponok free, and severing his link to the base! Inside\n&gt; the screens that had been counting down the containment breech\n&gt; went black as thier feed was lost. \n&gt; \n&gt; However the voice could still be heard from outside, &quot;10 . . . 9 . . . \n&gt; 8 . . . 7 . . . &quot;\n\nRodimus glanced at Zarak, flashing him an ugly look, but quickly complied. Zarak turned back to look at the screen, ignoring Perceptor&#39;s inaction. \n\nFrom outside the voice continued: 6 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . \n\nWith a rumble Skorponok came to life. Screens came to life in front of Zarak as he smiled to himself. Another rumble as the drill claws began to turn and with a push the giant crab began to push its way beneath the ground of the chamber, leaving it behind. \n\nBehind it the voice finished its count down: 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . . \n\n     . . .  and then the room exploded as large pipes burst and trapped heat flowed into the chamber, and then quickly behind it magma that liquifyed metal and stone. As it burst through the room it pushed up the main chamber and corridores that led out of it, ripping its way to the surface. Pushing along the main corridore, but also finding the pathway that had been created by Megatron from above. \n\nBeneath all this Skorponok fled the scene - Zarak, Cyclonus, Rodimus, Scourge and Perceptor all held safely inside. Beghind the digging machine weapons opened fire, slagging the tunnel behind it, closing off the tunnel from the flow of magma as it dug its way towards the black tower, Hydras&#39; base, far in the distance. \n\n(TAG: Perceptor, Any)\n\nPreston\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
