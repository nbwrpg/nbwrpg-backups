She got up \nand walked around the forest. She saw only dark trees and no one in sight.  \nShe wandered around for a while, deciding that since she was now lost, she&#39;d \nneed to find something to make her unlost. She wnet running in the direction \nof the sun and kept going.  All the while, she kept meowing and calling in \nhopes of one of her friends finding her.  She also hoped that one of the not \nso nice bots didn&#39;t find her.  So she kept running as fast as her little \nlegs would go. &quot;Meow!&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
