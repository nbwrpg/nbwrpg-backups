A tall\nand dark cloaked figure stepped out of it, its feet clicking as they\nmet the ground. The figure had no face, but it saw Darkangel on the\nfloor. It went near and immediatly realized it was emitting its wave\nof panic. It stopped at once.\n\n???: Are you all right?\n\nIt passed a hand over Darkangel&#39;s head, instantly stopping the\npanic-induced stasis lock.\n\n???: Forgive me, I did not realize my capacities.\n\nSurprisingly, the voice was soft. It was that of a female, but the\nfigure seemed to belie the possibility of anything but fear.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Darkangel : : \n&gt; Darkangel was paying attention to the computer and did not notice\nthe movement in the pod. \n&gt; Suddenly the wave from the new bot struck, and Darkangel&#39;s eyes grew\nwide and bright. He seemed to start sweating immediatly. His hands\nwent to his head, and it became obvious he was in pain. \n&gt; Darkangel: Ahhhhh! What the hell is wrong with me?! \n&gt; The bat bot fell to the ground in stasis. The wave had knocked him out. \n&gt;  &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote: Inside\nthe pod, something began to move. The file had not been totally\n&gt; uploaded, but it was not an essential part. The protoform was now\n&gt; fully awake and knew what was happening around.\n&gt; \n&gt; More out of instinct than by real malevolence, it sent a wave of\n&gt; distress on Darkangel&#39;s mind. It could freeze him in place and leave\n&gt; him shaking, but the effects were variable depending on many factors.\n&gt; However, it was a disturbing sensation that would likely leave him\n&gt; restless.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; : : Darkangel : : \n&gt; &gt; He recieved the comm message from Tyrael, and opened a return\nchannel. \n&gt; &gt; Darkangel: Understood. I&#39;ll begin work on this right away. \n&gt; &gt; Darkangel got the pod he had returned with ans set it up in a lab,\n&gt; connected to the computer system. First he got the black canister and\n&gt; unloaded it&#39;s contents into the pod, so it would be part of the\n&gt; protoform. That was easy. Now Darkangel was at the keyboards running\n&gt; through millions of files looking for the correct one. \n&gt; &gt; Finally after about ten minutes he found Burrock.dna on the system.\n&gt; He selected the file and began to upload it into the pod.

I want you to create this new bot I\n&gt; &gt; was talking about, since I can&#39;t be there right now. Go into the lab\n&gt; &gt; with a blank stasis pod and download the Burrock.DNA file in it. Then,\n&gt; &gt; include the black canister to its composition. Contact me when our new\n&gt; &gt; soldier is born.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
