Within a few moments a slow rumble could be heard\nas birds rose into the air and animals bellowed in fear as they reacted\nto sudden seismic activity. The once calm, icy blue\nwater water of the lake rippled and then splashed as the activity\nbecame more forceful. \n\nThen with an ugly hissing sound, smoke\nbegan billowing from the cave entrance that the minions had just exited\nfrom, the smell of sulfur filling the once pristine air. \n\n&quot;Yess,\nindeed.&quot; Marauder said softly as he watched the show! Still in his\nstarfighter mode he banked almost lazily away from the distant mountains as he activated his boosters. &quot;Come my minions! We will soon\nsubjugate this ball of rock!&quot; Marauder said as he began to chuckle\nlightly to himself. &quot;But first we will need an army!&quot;\n\nHe began\nto move off to the south, away from scene, away from the mountains, and\nonto the new beginnings of the Minion menace on the Earth. \n\nBehind\nhim magma began spewing out of the cave entrance as it fell steaming\ninto the water below, looking like a molten water\nfall. White steam and vapors billowed into the air as the water was quickly boiled away by the lava.\n\nMarauder began to laugh as he picked up speed!\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
