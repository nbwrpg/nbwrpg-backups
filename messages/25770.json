Some man who got in a hissy fit just because something \ndidn&#39;t go his way.\nShe didn&#39;t hate him but she wouldn&#39;t let this go. At least Angel Prime had \nappologized. This man was just plain rude.\n&lt; I&#39;ll get you back. One way or another.&gt;\nIron Raptor growled and narroewd her eyes.&lt; Same with the Alliance. One way \nor another.....&gt; Her fist clenched and she clamped her jaw.\nShe hated this! Waiting like some dog ready to serve it&#39;s master. But she \nhad to wait, just a little longer.*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
