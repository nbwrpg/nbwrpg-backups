If I tried to draw something that I \ndidn&#39;t copy\n&gt; from a book, it would look like that. I have alot of Pokemon \ndrawings, but\n&gt; they don&#39;t go on a Transformer&#39;s page. Don&#39;t get me wrong, though, \nPokemon\n&gt; makes for a lovely game... and an idiotic and crappy cartoon. No \noffense to\n&gt; anyone who actually likes it, though. In the future I might try to \ndraw\n&gt; something, but I just don&#39;t have the talent for that kind of thing. \nSo don&#39;t\n&gt; feel bad, Zardus...\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, January 04, 2001 10:26 AM\n&gt; Subject: Zardus&#39; &quot;Masterpieces&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (LOL!
