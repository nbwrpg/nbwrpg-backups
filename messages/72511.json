Now it was their only s=\r\nhot.

He&#39;s going to try and bait them direct=\r\nly to either disrupt\n&gt; things for further chaos later.  IT&#39;s a more subtle =\r\nand Predacon thing to\n&gt; do, so I&#39;ll let you decide where to run with it.  A=\r\nnd Hydras, request you\n&gt; let DINOBOT play it out then given you would proba=\r\nbly trust him in this and\n&gt; it humilaites the Maximals as well.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
