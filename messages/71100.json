No =\r\none&#39;s commn&#39; in or outa here unless they wanna risk their sorry afts ta do =\r\nso.&quot;\n\nHe then transforms into beast mode, and rears up.\n\n&quot; I got more kick =\r\npower in this mode.  Hooves are geat defense weapons, &#39;specially when ya wa=\r\nnna strike a bot below the belt, if ya know what I mean, Torca.  \n\nHe charg=\r\nes in beast mode toward his enemys, at a strong trot and hefty snort.\n\nOuts=\r\nide the Ark, Rat Trap clings to Night Shift with his dear life, fearing tha=\r\nt their distraction may not be enough to foil the sweeps.\n\n&quot; Slag! They cau=\r\nght onta us!  Now what?!&quot;\n\nHe screaches to Night Shift as he dodges the bla=\r\nsts on screeching tires.\n\n&quot;I dunno Rat trap, I&#39;m go&#39;n as fast as I can!  I&#39;=\r\nm not a speedster, I&#39;m an off roader.... Waaaaiiiit, that&#39;s it...  We all k=\r\nnow that jets can&#39;t fly in heavy vegitation right?&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;Uh h=\r\nuh, Oh, I get it, well ya better do it fast buddy or else we&#39;re done for!&quot;\n=\r\n\nNight Shift chuckles.\n\n&quot;Better get inside, it&#39;s a lot more fun when you&#39;re=\r\n buckled in.&quot;\n\nRat Trap quickly gets inside, and settles himself in the dri=\r\nver&#39;s seat, resorting to robot mode, buckling the seat belt.\n\n&quot;Heeey, you&#39;r=\r\ne right, it is a lot more fun in the driver&#39;s seat. &quot;\n\nNight Shift turns of=\r\nf the beaten path, and heads down a rather steep slope, as his tires roll o=\r\nver rough terrain, heading right for a patch of heavy vegitation.  His susp=\r\nension system is now put to the test as he rolls along without a worry in t=\r\nhe world, knowing that perhaps this would prove difficult for a sweep to fo=\r\nllow him in such thick brush cover. \n\n&quot;Okay, hopefully this will get those =\r\nair heads off our tail pipe.&quot;\n\nBack at the Ark, Tucson realizes that he&#39;s l=\r\nost Nightrazor for the moment, and decides not to try a shot at him.  Inste=\r\nad, he concentrates and decides it&#39;s best to just follow him.  Yet he wante=\r\nd Nightrazor to know he was there.  But without a fix on him, he had to sta=\r\nrt from scratch.\n\n&quot; All right, I never said this was going to be easy. Sorr=\r\ny Straight Shot, but I believe he&#39;s on the move again.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot goes=\r\n along with him.\n\n&quot;No probs, things happen.  Now what?\n\nTucson narrows a br=\r\now.\n\n&quot; We play his game.  I have control of the PA system in the Ark, so it=\r\n&#39;s time he knew who he was up against.  I also had time to anaylize who he =\r\nis.  Name is Nightrazor, one of Cyclonus&#39;s Ninjabots.  It came up on my int=\r\nel search system.&quot;\n\nHe turns on the PA on his gauntlett.\n\n&quot;  Don&#39;t make thi=\r\ns harder than it has to be, Nightrazor.&quot;\n\nHe narrows his optics.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s i=\r\nt, if Sonar is the only way to stop him then so be it.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot sque=\r\nals.\n\n&quot;Oh no, not again, that last one really hurt.&quot;\n\nHe sighs.\n\n&quot;Sorry, I =\r\nhave to.&quot;\n\nWith a look of sheer determination, he again activates a sonar w=\r\nave formidable enough to rattle the relays of any bot around.  He realized =\r\nhe could not let go of his sonar attack, due to the fact it was the only wa=\r\ny to capture Nightrazor.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m tired of antics, and I&#39;m tired of games!  Th=\r\nis is OUR Ark and it&#39;s MY duty to keep it safe!  And safe it will be!&quot;\n\nIt =\r\nwas clear that Tucson was truely losing his temper.  Through his injuries, =\r\nhe remains strong, stubborn and resolute.  There would be no stopping him f=\r\nrom protecting his comrades, and his base.  And there would be no stopping =\r\nhim from protecting the bodies of the Autobots who have yet to awaken many =\r\nyears afterwards.\n\n&quot; Rodimus, I need you to concentrate your vigil over the=\r\n sleeping Autobots!  And be sure no harm comes to Optimus Prime!  I have a =\r\nfeeling that Nightrazor, our so called intruder has been sent here to destr=\r\noy his body and those of our sleeping comrades!  If one Autobot is touched,=\r\n do not hesitate to do the same to a Decepticon!  It&#39;s a life for a life an=\r\nd I&#39;m NOT taking anyone&#39;s scrap anymore!&quot;\n\nHe transmits to Torca and the ot=\r\nher Maximals.\n\n&quot;Torca, if you can hear me, I need you and the others to bar=\r\ne down on Hydras and the other predacons with no holds barred!  That means,=\r\n if they take anyone&#39;s life, or attempt to, return the favor at will!  They=\r\n want to play rough, they got it!  Because if they think we&#39;re going to fal=\r\nl to them, THEY&#39;RE SADLY MISTAKEN!&quot;\n\nHe slams a foot down hard, and at the =\r\nsame time, lets loose another round of formidable sonar waves.\n\n--- In nbwr=\r\npg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: I fi=\r\ngured I would post first before I decided if Tuscon would hit.\n&gt; Nightrazor=\r\n still had that last move. Anyone do what you will and we will see\n&gt; what h=\r\nappens :)\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside the Ark the battle is picking up speed, th=\r\ne Maximals bringing\n&gt; everything they have to bear against the Predacons!\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; This is the scene that greets Wing Caliber and Quickstrike as they emer=\r\nge\n&gt; from the Ark and into the combat - one of complete mayhem! Two of the =\r\nmost\n&gt; powerful Predacons to date are moving against the Ark, Hydras and Cy=\r\nclonus!\n&gt; And they are not alone as Predacons of all sorts follow them, len=\r\nding their\n&gt; destructive energies to the battle!\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca, as the highest=\r\n ranking Maximal on the field was attempting to bring\n&gt; order to the chaos!=\r\n HoweverTorca is blown his off his feet and sent\n&gt; sprawling to the ground =\r\nby a blast from Cyclonus. The stalwart\n&gt; Maximal continued giving orders as=\r\n he attempted to return fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wing Caliber, Quickstrike!&quot; Torca&#39;s boo=\r\nming voice echoed across the\n&gt; communication channel. &quot;The automatic contro=\r\nls are offline, get the Ark door\n&gt; closed. We don&#39;t want any of these piece=\r\ns of scrap getting inside the Ark!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Noctorro, Airhammer and =\r\nQuicksilver did what they could to harass\n&gt; the other fliers like Waspinato=\r\nr, Deepstryke and even Cyclonus while Bantor\n&gt; entered the fray with a wild=\r\n abandon as he leaped after Hydras, hoping to\n&gt; distract him long enough to=\r\n allow the others to come in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup&#39;s blasts are powerful as he attempte=\r\nd to fire at the sweeps as well.\n&gt; However what he got in return was severa=\r\nl shots from Scourge as he lined up\n&gt; on the Autobot. &quot;Foolish prey!&quot; Scour=\r\nge said as he came around for another\n&gt; run, his auto canons opening fire o=\r\nn Kup!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile as the sweeps came after Nightshift and Ratrap, Night=\r\nshift\n&gt; transformed into his SUV mode and began zipping through enemy fire =\r\nhoping to\n&gt; dodge the well aimed blasts of the sweeps. However the sweeps a=\r\nre designed\n&gt; to capture pray, and so as Nighshift picks up speed, the swee=\r\nps quickly\n&gt; oblige the Maximals by firing sizzling hot disintegration beam=\r\ns at them as\n&gt; they fly after them!\n&gt; \n&gt; INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Elita noded and Took ramulus&#39;s hand, she was unusually quiet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus looked at Elita, &quot;I will protect you. I promise. Your father =\r\nhas to\n&gt; defend the Ark.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Rodimus gave Elita one last squeez=\r\ne and then transformed. With a\n&gt; screeching noise Rodimus took off for the =\r\nfront door. It was time to join\n&gt; the battle in earnest!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile =\r\nat the same time Tuscon was still continuing his search, using his\n&gt; sonar =\r\nto attempt to locate the intruder. A small blip appeared on his\n&gt; screen, a=\r\nlerting him to the possible location of the intruder. Long years of\n&gt; steal=\r\nth training are readying him for this moment as he moves forward,\n&gt; trying =\r\nto listen for the smallest sound, feeling for the smallest vibration.\n&gt; Unf=\r\nortunately Tuscon&#39;s armor is heavier than it once was, slowing him. While\n&gt;=\r\n he is far more durable than he once was, moving silently and stealthily is=\r\n\n&gt; not an easy task, especially with his injuries. But he took his moment t=\r\no\n&gt; ready himself . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Steady Straight Shot. We need=\r\n to make this count.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot programs her mechanisms for opt=\r\nimal effeciency.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Talk about a shot in the dark. Okay, let&#39;s do th=\r\nis.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as Tuscon uttered those words he could hear a sma=\r\nll whisper from\n&gt; somewhere in the dark. &quot;AHH yes, the wave is gone . . . F=\r\nINALLY!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The blip disappeared from Tuscon&#39;s screens . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
