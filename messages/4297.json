She hadn&#39;t nabbed a Predacon that could lead to \nMegatron&#39;s whereabouts. He lowered herself to the ground and walked slowly \ntowards the Arc.

Her scanners picked them up as Predacons. She walked towards Black \nArachnia and Inferno. Rampage wasn&#39;t too far. She made sure that she could \nsee him. She came up a few feet away from them, and said, &quot;You there, who \nare you?&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
