Her knew shiney chocolate brown\n&gt;   skin glistened in the room lights.  Her red optics glowed with pride\n&gt;   as her spider legs fanned out behind her giving a fan like appearence,\n&gt;   only to enhance her regal stance.  The new built in shields gave only\n&gt;   the slightest vibration when activated and she had new photosonic\n&gt;   pistol blasters on her hips.  The new blasters could, if focused on a\n&gt;   single point long enough, melt most metals since it not only used\n&gt;   energy, but sound to create it&#39;s blasts, disrupting an object on an\n&gt;   atomic level.  Her new venom was even more potent, and her webs were\n&gt;   now three times thier strength.  Despite the improvements, she still\n&gt;   could mix web and venom to create explosives. BUt the one drawback to\n&gt;   all this was that her mech fluid was very acidic and would eventually\n&gt;   disintegrate her internal systems. But no one could of her long term\n&gt;   death sentence, not her or her up grader. \n&gt; \n&gt;   She showed her new form proudly. &quot;I hope you like it.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
