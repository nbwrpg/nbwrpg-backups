She tapped the tube for a sec to make sure that it \nwould work, then walked over to Dinobot.\nShe sighed and looked over to Prowl.*\n\n&quot; Open his mouth...&quot;\n\n* This tube she held would go down his throat and into his stomach, pumping \nfluids into his body to be digested and transformed into mech-fluid.\nBut she needed both her hands to shove this tube down his throat, and she \njust prayed that he didn&#39;t wake up and start gaging on it.*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
