Easy to anger, easy to bait, not caring\n&gt; for those he can relate.  Blame others he does for his loss of control, not\n&gt; care how he got into his hole.  Care for him not, I know I do, but think he\n&gt; is not ready to go unlike you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sighing, &quot;But know what is up with them I do not, out in the boonies like\n&gt; time forgot.  I think that you are not ready to go, until you finish repairs\n&gt; I know.  So, here I am afraid you will stay.  We both will hate it quite\n&gt; much this way.  I am ready to go, but will leave it to you, so say so.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS just looked at WHEELIE for a long moment, a war or desire vs\nreality being fought on his face as he slowly came to the harsh\nreality that he could not follow WHEELIE, at least not yet.\n\nFinally he nodded. &quot;I understand. I cannot go with you, but we need to\nknow what and why the Dinobots are acting so strangely.&quot;\n\nRODIMUS reached up to his shoulder and pulled off what looked to be\none of the smaller insignia, one that was similar to the Autobot but a\nlittle different, more like GRIMLOCK&#39;s face. &quot;This is his old Dynobot\nbadge. One that we had crafted together many vorns ago.&quot; Rodimus said.\n&quot;I don&#39;t know what has happened to Grimlock, but if there is anything\nleft of him in there, perhaps this will remind him of who is was, and\nwho he could still be.&quot;\n\nRODIMUS held it out to WHEELIE, &quot;If there is a way to still save him,\nhe deserves that chance.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
