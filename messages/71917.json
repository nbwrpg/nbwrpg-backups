I am trying to create a cohesive history of things and I\n&gt; am creating what Cybertron is now and this is will require a soft\n&gt; reboot of Cybertron. I am basing it in part on our sister RPG site:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://wikihost.org/wikis/nbwrpg_wiki/wiki/start\n&gt;\n&gt; As well as using Transformers Animated for the general FEEL and\n&gt; ATMOSPHERE of Cybertron today. My history for Beast Wars basically\n&gt; uses G1/G2 cartoon from the 80&#39;s with elements from the comics and\n&gt; perhaps some of the other toons for spice. I am ignoring Beast\n&gt; Machines, although if someone wants or needs elements from it it can\n&gt; be incorporated into what we have. For me Cybertron is still metal and\n&gt; the Maximal council rules, and there is a cold war of sorts going on\n&gt; on Cybertron between the Maximals and the Predacons. Decepticons and\n&gt; Autobots exist but are consider rare and odd, Decepticons are to be\n&gt; hunted down and Autobots are considerfed relics of times past.\n&gt;\n&gt; None of this should affect what has already happened here on old\n&gt; Earth, but if anyone has any questions or comments, please feel free\n&gt; to let me know. I have a time line in the works to help put things\n&gt; into perspective.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n"}}
