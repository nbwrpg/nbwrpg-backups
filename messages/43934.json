Gobots was a rival\nshow, about the same, but it didnt have no where near the impact with\nstoryline, or creating a whole universe. Their toys were quite inferior,\nand eventually Hasbro put them out of buisness, then bought the rights\nto it. That&#39;s why for a while in Generation 2 they had characters named\nGobot, it was a shot in the face.\n\nI would have liked to see the Beast Wars that the writers would have\nmade if they had total control and an unlimited budget. In my opinion\nthe guys who wrote that show were geniuses.\n\nI like RID, but I am not to fond of how Anime it is. I&#39;m not a big fan\nof Japanese cartoons, and this one is no exeption, it dosent take itself\nseriously. The animation is beautiful however, but the stories are not\nvery compeling. However I have read rumors that Takara or Hasbro (i&#39;m\nnot sure which one is the owner) will make a brand new series soon\nrevolving around Generation 1, but this is just a rumor.\n\n"}}
