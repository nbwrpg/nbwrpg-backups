He frowns. He didn&#39;t\nwant\n&gt; the Maximals destroyed, though he doubted that they would be. Either\n&gt; way, though, a small token of help would improve his dealings with\n&gt; them greatly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alliance members,&quot; he says over the comm, &quot;The battle is at the\n&gt; Maximal base. We&#39;re going to help the Maximals out this time, so\nfire\n&gt; on anyone firing at you unless the Maximals open fire on us. In that\n&gt; case, we&#39;ll blow them to scrap.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He motions for the Galactors to follow him and then looks at Havoc.\n&gt; &quot;Wait here in case Wolfgang wakes up. I should be back soon.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Motioning for the Galactors to follow, he walks out of the CR room,\n&gt; heading for the exit. Him and the Galactors exit the base and take\n&gt; off, the shields flickering off for them as they pass through and\nfly\n&gt; toward the CF. Zardus looks behind him, checking to see if anyone\nwas\n&gt; following, as they should be.\n\n\n"}}
