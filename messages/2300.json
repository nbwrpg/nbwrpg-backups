Spinning back around, \nhe manages to fire his launcher at her before her teeth close around his \ntorso.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAnnihilator looks in shock at the huge maximal that had just attacked Killer. \nHe takes a few steps back, calling Shuko and Set for backup on his comm-link.\n\nAiming his gun carefully at the back of Iron Raptor&#39;s neck, he nearly pulls \nthe trigger before an acid pellet hits his side, causing him to drop his gun. \nHe yells in pain, pulling out a pistol and firing it at Prowl.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl ducks under Annihilator&#39;s shot, rolling forward and slamming his \ndouble-bladed knuckle weapon (look at his bio on the site, you&#39;ll see what I \nmean) into the predacon&#39;s side.\n\n"}}
