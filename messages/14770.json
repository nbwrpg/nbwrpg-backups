She had been in Stasis lock for\n&gt; awhile, and the battle was almost over. She could see Deemos, still\n&gt; ifghting alone. She struggled to her feet, and walked, always\n&gt; directly behind Deemos. When she got to him she whispered in his here.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Deemos, look! Their escape ship is almost ready to leave. Give me\n&gt; permission to stow aboard, and I&#39;ll sabotage it. It&#39;ll be destroyed\n&gt; in huge flames. I have no problem&#39;s dying for the Chosen Ones.&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt;\n&gt; Just when things looked their bleakess, Vulois thought he saw light\n&gt; ahead.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Windrazor!
