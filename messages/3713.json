She dodges 2 of them but \nthe third hits her in the leg slicing it open.  She screams out in pain.  \nThe plasma blasts send her fliying into a tree, which she cracks in half \nfrom the impact, and lands at the base of the tree. The stinger missles hit \nher dead on.  She is heavily damaged.  She finds enough strength to stand \nand she walks over to DarkMouse.  She covers DarkMouses body with her as the \nheat seaking missles hit.  DarkMouse is not further damaged as Ursa Major \ntook the hit from the missles.  Ursa Major collapses ontop of DarkMouse.  \nUrsa Major&#39;s spark flutters......and gives out.  Ursa Major is dead.\n\nDarkMouse is barely alive while under the wait of Ursa Major&#39;s body.\n\n\n\nPlease put Ursa Major on the deceased list as killed by Manterror,  Counter \nPunch, Bumblebee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------Original Message--------------\n&gt;From: KSLawdogg@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: (unknown)\n&gt;Date: Sun, 18 Jun 2000 14:33:00 EDT\n&gt;Manterror/Counter Punch/Double Punch/Injector/Bumblebee:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Manterror, Counter Punch, and Double Punch arrive on the scene, seeing all\n&gt;the fuss over Dark Mouse.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Manterror fires three ion disks at Ursa Major.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Counter Punch fires three plasma blasts off at Ursa Major.\n&gt;\n&gt;Double Punch fires two enrgy-signature seeking missiles off at Dark Mouse.\n&gt;\n&gt;Bumblebee slams into a tree trunk, firing three stinger missiles off at Urs \n&gt;a\n&gt;Major.\n&gt;\n&gt;Injector fired two missiles off at Striker.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
