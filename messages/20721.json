A sort of feeling \nlike when he had Shadow Wings Spark inside him. He tried to quicken \nthe pace but walking on 2 legs was harder than he thjought it would \nbe. He got another idea. &quot;Veratis&quot; He called over his comm, &quot;Send my \ntransport pod to me.&quot;\n\nFoxfingers reached the entrance to the base when his comm intercepted \nthe message. &quot;I&#39;m nearby, I&#39;ll take it to him.&quot; The fox didn&#39;t know \nwho was speaking but if Veratis vouched for him then he was an allie.\n\n&quot;No&quot; Veratis shouted, &quot;Ice is contaminated with the virus.&quot; He \ncontinued yelling for Foxfingers to keep his distance until the \ndrones cleaned up.\n\nThe Maximal transport launched by remote control. Lunarpine waited \npatiently for it hoping that it wasn&#39;t to late.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She heard Lunarpine&#39;s thoughts. She wasn&#39;t quite sure what he ment. \n&gt; She scanned his mind and saw just what the virus was and what it \n&gt; could do.  She felt fearful now.  She had thoughts about what would \n&gt; happen if the got into a battle and her blood was spilt. It could \n&gt; endanger the planet. She was now a threat. Her worst fear was \n&gt; starting to come true before her eyes. She would no longer ba able \nto \n&gt; fight with Lunarpine, she would have to be caged and kept under \nlock \n&gt; and key as long as she had this virus in her. Her body started to \n&gt; shake as fear started to flood her mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine smelled the dripping blood and knew that he had to get \n&gt; Ice \n&gt; &gt; back to base quickly. He caught another scent on the wind, \nanother \n&gt; &gt; wolf. He knew how to handle this though. He snarled loudly as a \n&gt; sign \n&gt; &gt; to the scavenger that this was his prize. He knew from pack \n&gt; instincts \n&gt; &gt; that the other wolf would recognize Lunarpines size strength, and \n&gt; &gt; health as a sign of dominance. Ice wasn&#39;t on the menu tonight.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The clean up drones continued to take care of the virus infected \n&gt; &gt; blood. Lunarpine watched as they dusted through his footprints \n&gt; &gt; cleaning up all traces of blood. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you know this \nor \n&gt; &gt; not but you just came close to ending us all.&quot; He knew he was \n&gt; immune, \n&gt; &gt; he also knew that if the virus would&#39;ve gotten out that every \n&gt; faction \n&gt; &gt; on this tiny little world would hunt them down and force them to \n&gt; &gt; share the same fate.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
