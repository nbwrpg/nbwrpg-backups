He laid it out \non level ground and began to decypher the control panel.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What kind of pod is this?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; After much trouble, Celeron managed to unlock the pod.  He pulled \nthe lid open and saw a pair of eyes looking back at him.  Malicous \nlooking eyes.  He slammed the lid shut an locked it.\n&gt; \n&gt; He brushed off the side of the pod and found that this was one of \nthe prisioners from the ship.  An especially violent prisioner \nbecause a few seconds later he began to try to break out of the pod.\n&gt; \n&gt; I better call the Warden.  He runs away just as the pod errupts in \nflames.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Message: 1\n&gt; &gt;   Date: Mon, 15 Sep 2003 07:45:49 -0700\n&gt; &gt;   From: &quot;Vryl The Cranberry Hag&quot; &lt;rm2kmidi@l...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Celeron--Salvage\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Celeron steped outside the ship.  It was a boring night, he had \nsolved all their problems and now the captain had been having him \nrepair stuff.  Once his task was done, instead of getting another, \nhe quickly sneaked out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;He half flew, half walked up to the top of the sandy hill which \nwas right next to the ship.  Then he started a scan for anything \ninteresting.  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Searching........some metal, some mice, a bug....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Somthing caught his attention.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;....ooooOOO  small pod.....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;It was quite a ways away so he had to hike about 13 minutes to \nanother mountain about 10 clicks south.  When he arrived at the \nobject he discovered that it was buryed about 80% of the way into \nthe sand.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Its buried.....time to get out the old shovel....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;(To be continued)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;____________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt;Get advanced SPAM filtering on Webmail or POP Mail ...
