Maybe it&#39;s the one we came from.&quot;\n\n* Though the sound of gunshots reached her too, so that meant.....*gasp!**\n\n&quot; Rion! If that&#39;s the Delta Trica...and since there&#39;s weapon fire...that \ncould mean that there&#39;s survivors!&quot;\n\n* And without even waiting for her friend, Diana jumped into action and \nbegan to run towards the ship. Even though aches a pains made it a little \nharder then usual.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
