I&#39;m loaded with posts AGAIN!\n\n&quot; Yes. It was our temporary base until it was destroyed beyond recognition. \nThen rebuilt and launched to a safer location.\nFrom there we moved onto the Cybertronian Fire. It was the largest war ship \nthen but soon it was outclassed and outgunned. Meeting the same fate as the \nArk. Soo...it was dismantled and what remains were left were used to help \nfortify the Maximal City.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor began to walk away from the city a little, at a slow pace.*\n\n&quot; As for allies...we don&#39;t have many...if any anymore.  There are a few \nfactions that have aided us, even the Alliance at times. But the Maximals \nare basically alone on this planet.  Cheated, ransacked and generally beaten \nbeyond recognition. That has been our fate so far.&quot;\n\n* It was lack of leadership, she knew. There were great warriors here but \nwith poor leadership all they&#39;ve been getting was beaten up. And it wasn&#39;t \nhard to notice that all of the battles they HAVE WON...weren&#39;t led by her at \nall.\n&lt; I was never made to lead. I was made to follow.&gt;*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
