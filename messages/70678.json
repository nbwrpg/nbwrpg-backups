But I&#39;m sure the others would be interested in hearing your story.  Why=\r\n don&#39;t you tell them, and then catch up to us at a later time perhaps?  Rig=\r\nht now, I am tired, and I do need rest.  So does Rodimus.  You may use the =\r\nroom where Optimus Prime rests, if you wish.  Just be sure to leave things =\r\nas they are.&quot;\n\nHe says with a gentile voice.  Before becomming a Prime, he =\r\nhad been known as gruff autobot, always willing to take chances.  But now, =\r\nhis experiences begin to change him, not only on the outside but on the ins=\r\nide as well.  He had learned a lot in his experience while fighting beside =\r\nVestige in his subconcious state, and how important team work was, and how =\r\nvaluable the help of others truely is.  \n\n&quot; Oh, before you go, Thank you, t=\r\nhank you for standing by us during our ordeal.  It means a lot to us.&quot;\n\n---=\r\n In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson smiles and puts a hand on Rodimus&#39;s shoulder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;A favor I would not mind doing for you again, Rodimus. You&#39;re worth more=\r\n to me than any precious metal or power source. And, Torca&#39;s right, I - cou=\r\nld use a rest, but, perhaps I will get that when I undergo the repairs to m=\r\ny optic sensors. Stanton, I need to ask you a favor. One that I know is ext=\r\nremely difficult to accomplish, and one that I&#39;d never ask of you unless it=\r\n was a dire need. I would like you to attempt the delicate process of bring=\r\ning my optic sensors back online. If it doesn&#39;t work, I understand. But I s=\r\naw how important it was for me to be able to see in order to get an idea of=\r\n the situation at hand and how to remedy it. A blind eye can only go so far=\r\n. And if at all possible, could the same be done for Perceptor? He too, des=\r\nerves a second chance of seeing things in a whole new light.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Santon nodded, a smile on his face, &quot;I had assumed that you would need\n&gt;=\r\n that sooner or later.&quot; He walked over to Tuscon holding a sensors a\n&gt; few =\r\ninches from the side of his heard, apparently taking reading, &quot;The\n&gt; scanne=\r\nrs should have a pretty good work up on you, but once we get\n&gt; this room re=\r\nady I believe we can get your optics wokring again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bump had walked o=\r\nver to Rodimus and began running a scanner over him\n&gt; as well. &quot;Both of you=\r\n are to get rest before you go galavanting across\n&gt; this planet again. You =\r\nhave both been through a lot.&quot; Bump looked at\n&gt; both of them meaningfuly, i=\r\nt was apparent he was not going to let them\n&gt; leave the base withou some re=\r\ncharging and true down time.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Then my tale has to wait&quot;sa=\r\nid dryly Perceptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca had been watching Tuscon and Rodi=\r\nmus with a critical optic as if\n&gt; weighing out how much they could handle, =\r\nbut he glanced over at\n&gt; Perceptor, &quot;No, it does not.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked back =\r\nat Tuscon and then Rodimus, &quot;There are so many tales.&quot;\n&gt; he said. &quot;We all h=\r\nave much to discuss.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, yes!&quot; Bump said as he glanced up from his =\r\nscanner reading of\n&gt; Rodimus, &quot;But not in the medical chamber.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca =\r\nsmiled indulgantly at Bump, &quot;Quite right.&quot; He looked over at\n&gt; Tuscon and R=\r\nodimus, &quot;Shall we take this to another room?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
