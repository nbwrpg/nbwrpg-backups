Scanning she discovered Hell Beast.\n&lt; Filthy scum. &gt; She hissed to herself.\nIt was then that she wished she could transform into her SBM but then that \nwould trigger Prowl to do the same and the last thing they nedded was an \nuncontrolable beast.\nBut...then again....\nSBM: &lt; So, finally need me now?&gt;\n&lt; Shut up and transform!&gt;\nSBM: &lt; You&#39;re the boss.&gt;\nThe transformation wasn&#39;t as easy as it had been the first time, though the \nlast one had more pain involved then this.\nIt only took a matter of seconds before IR had completed the morph from bot \nto beast, but she had a plan up her sleeve.\nBefore she had TFed she gave Prowl an image of 4 explicit signatures that \nwere soaring 200 meters above the CF, trying to lock that image into his \nmind so that, IF he TFed then he would have those targets to destroy while \nshe went after those of Hell Beasts force which were on the ground.( \nGremlin,Pheniox, Aerostreak, and Craken.)\nBy then she was already 3/4 of the way to the location of the enemy which \nwas firing on her ship, growling when she finally saw Hell Beast himself. \nBut before she even could approach him alone, there were his troops on the \nsouthern face she had to deal with first. Jackle, Klash, Nighteyes and \nMarine.\nIf she had to she would deal with one group at a time, but they would have \nto notice her or be destroyed, it was their choice.\nIron,roared as she beared down on that group, each step carrying her closer \nto striking range.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
