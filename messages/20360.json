Tears were starting to well up in her \n&gt; eyes. &quot;No&quot; she whispered.  She felt her spark breaking. She sat \ndown \n&gt; on the table and stared of into space. She shook her head as the \n&gt; tears rolled down her cheeks. &quot;No...no..no, he can&#39;t be gone. He \njust \n&gt; can&#39;t be gone. Oh holy matrix, no, please no.&quot; She covered her face \n&gt; with her hands and cried uncontrollably. From what she was told, \nher \n&gt; love was lost to her, forever.\n\n\n"}}
