The three humanoid ones\n&gt; begin to speak in complete unison &quot;Unit Reflector and Ratbat returning&quot;\n&gt; they anounce. At that a large building emerges from underground and\n&gt; opens up. The four fly into it. Reflector&#39;s parts land, and Ratbat\n&gt; perches on the middle ones shoulder. Then lights begin to iluminate, and\n&gt; a small table is visible, with three ancient robots surrounding it. &quot;Was\n&gt; your mission a success?&quot; One of the old forms says, not wasting any\n&gt; time. Reflector nods, then the three parts transform into a camera\n&gt; again, hooking up to a machine on the wall. Ratbat then transforms into\n&gt; a cassette and enters the Machine. The scren begins to illuminate with\n&gt; pictures of the meeting that had just happened between the Autobots,\n&gt; then slowly sound is added. The three robots look on with interest.\n\n\n"}}
