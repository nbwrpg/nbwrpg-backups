This old warrior locked down his ship \n&gt;as\n&gt;it crashed into a pile of raw energon. His beast scanner came out and only\n&gt;found raw energon signatures. The sound voiced. &quot;Too much energon error.  A\n&gt;skeleton of a bot came out. Its eyes red. Suddenly a white cloud of pure\n&gt;energy surronded him. His hands extended forwards he looked at himself. &quot;I \n&gt;am\n&gt;Archon....I am energy.&quot; He floated across the grassy field. His ship blew \n&gt;up\n&gt;behind him. he sent a com to the Maximal city near by. &quot;I am Archon Maximal\n&gt;warrior please respond.&quot;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
