They miss her by centimeters.  She flies closer and uses \nher talons to scratch the cockpit glass as she turns and flies \nstraight upwards in a right angle to Dark One.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Lord Unitron&quot; &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dark One/Hiss:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; He cursed as a spear dug into his left side, though, it hit no \nvital \n&gt; parts.  Similar to what humans called a &quot;flesh wound&quot;.  He raised \nhis \n&gt; missile launcher firing a rocket off at Spears.  (Or the plate \nshe&#39;s \n&gt; hiding behind).\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark One pulled up, a shot skinning one of his back fins near his \n&gt; engines.  He was now upside down, facing Shadow Wing.  He opened \nfire \n&gt; with a barrage of 5 rapid laser bolts, not wanting to use up to \nmuch \n&gt; energy to take out such a simple target.\n\n\n"}}
