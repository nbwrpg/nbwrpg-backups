To which extent do you want \nthis, though? Simple non-agression pact or a deeper alliance?\n\nIt would always be good to have allies, especially since his was now a \nweak group, but he did not especially love the idea of sharing \ntop-secret Tripred data with a band of rogue Predacons and nosy \nMaximals.\n\n\n"}}
