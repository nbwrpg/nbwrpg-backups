One minute you&#39;re\nfighting\n&gt; outside with Pegasus and Striker, the next you mysteriously get through\n&gt; sealed doors to Plintissa.  You&#39;re also not really responding to Pegasus\n&gt; (Jfrey) as I&#39;ve noticed.  I think you should try clarifying these things,\n&gt; because what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t really making much sense)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramhorn:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Slag!&quot; Ramhorn yelled, slamming a foot to the ground.  &quot;Insubordinate\nfool.&quot;\n&gt; ~Ramulus, this is Ramhorn.  I need you go to (gives the coordinates and\n&gt; section where Plintissa) and take Plintissa, she&#39;s a kind of squid robot,\nand\n&gt; take her to the brig and guard her.  If she attacks at all, shoot to kill.\n&gt; We can&#39;t afford to lose anymore good Maximals.  You&#39;ll have internal base\n&gt; defenses to help you.  THere are two others, you may have to shoot to kill\n&gt; anyways.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Watching Kamodia try to get in, he presses a few buttons, another missile\n&gt; launcher extending from the side of the Ark, firing two seeking missiles\nat\n&gt; Wraith.\n&gt; ~Striker, Pegasus, it&#39;s Ramhorn.  Try and take these people out fast, kill\n&gt; them if you have to.  We&#39;ve got intruders inside the Ark and we need them\n&gt; stopped~\n&gt;\n&gt; Seeing Bluestreak and Ratchet on a video monitor, Ramhorn smiled.\nActivating\n&gt; a comlink to them, he spoke:\n&gt;\n&gt; ~Hey, if you&#39;re Maximals we need your help,~ Ramhorn spoked, unlocking the\n&gt; door Bluestreak and Ratchet were near, ~We&#39;ve got intruders, and if you\njoin\n&gt; us we need your help badly.  If you go after them (he gives them their\n&gt; positions, their being Plintissa, Wraith, and Kamodia), you have\n&gt; authorization to shoot to kill~\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramhorn took out his submachine gun, loading it up.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Want to win airfare to Vegas for you and 20 friends, $15,000 and a\n&gt; suite at Bellagio for New Year&#39;s?
