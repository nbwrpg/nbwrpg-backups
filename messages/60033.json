To reach that objetive, current chars have to develop \ntheir weapons and skills in order to defat him... Impossilbe??? Not \nso.  Remember when the aparently weak defeats the mighty Minions. \nThey&#39;re NPCs, so we&#39;ll make it possible the way it is. The solar \nflare idea ruins that because it threatens Earth and simply gets to \nkill Unicron in one shot. Killing him like this ruins the whole \npoint and the fun of the game. Try something else that will allow \neveryone to get through the battle. \n\nIf you want to tell us of your concept in order to make it more \nlegal (speaking to everyone), you&#39;re welcome.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
