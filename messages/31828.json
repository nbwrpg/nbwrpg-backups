He was hoping that Prowl wouldnt notice\nhim. His\n&gt; small frame collided with the talons of the beast, and sent him\nflying\n&gt; backwards, straight onto his back. He lay motionless for a few\nseconds,\n&gt; then strugled to sit up. He was gushing oil, and one of his eyes was\n&gt; dangling from a spring. He strained himself to stand, and through\nmuch\n&gt; pain, and anguish, stood up defiantly, &quot;COME ON, you stupid freak&quot;\nhe\n&gt; screamed, forgeting he was trying to save a life, and getting\npissed. He\n&gt; also forgot he wouldnt be able to take this thing on in hand to hand\n&gt; combat...ever.\n\n\n"}}
