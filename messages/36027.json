He pulled out a semi large energon chainsaw.\n\nSlag shot another blast.\ncyberwolf4@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Oh, I thought they were in an Alleyway above ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doggeds speed was concentrated on the falling debris around him. &quot;This bots\n&gt; crazy!&quot; he thought knowing such a reckless attack could easily bring the\n&gt; entire tunnel down on them all. He noticed the second shot but didn&#39;t have\n&gt; time to move as it collided with him sending him rolling back from the\n&gt; impact. He reached up to feal his shoulder quickly learning that a gaping\n&gt; hole was now where his plating had been. He tried to move his arm, pain\n&gt; shooting through every servo in his body. His hand opened dropping his disk\n&gt; launcher to the ground. He opened a link to the others, &quot;The preys biting\n&gt; back.&quot; He shouts trying to hold back his pain. &quot;Do we really need the\n&gt; supplies this badly?&quot; The Cybrats had normally taken whatever they needed\n&gt; but now what Dogged needed was a medic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogged fealt a mysterious wave of virtigo come over him. He thought that the\n&gt; injuries were causing his mental state. He glanced in the direction of\n&gt; Repugnus and quickly realized that it was the Monsterbot who was causing his\n&gt; problems. He tried to recover his launcher when pain shit through his\n&gt; injured arm. The smallest of the Cybrats was nothing more than a useless\n&gt; target. In his condition ther was no way he&#39;d be of any use to his team.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 29, 2001 4:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Just a reminder: this is all taking place in an underground tunnel.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; ::::\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The bot ducks quickly, a laser passing overhead. He straightens and slams\n&gt; his fist into the piece of metal heading for him, knocking it aside.\n&gt; Reaching behind him, he takes out a very large, mean-looking rifle, aiming\n&gt; it at Dogged. He pulls the trigger once, nearly stumbling back from the\n&gt; recoil. The shot misses, sailing past Dogged and smashing into the roof of\n&gt; the tunnel. A large explosion caves that section in, and the bot fires\n&gt; again, this time right on target, the explosive round heading for Dogged\n&gt; very quickly.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Dogged  . transforms to four treaded\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; terrain vehicle about the size of a snowmobile.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Speeding through the flames, the heat warping the paint and singing the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; metal beneath. he remained focused on the bum.

His equilibreum\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; caused dizzyness and he stumbled backwards his weight carrying him\n&gt; towards\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Pacifix.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Switchblades optics began to blurr as Repugnus&#39;s waves took thier\n&gt; effect.
