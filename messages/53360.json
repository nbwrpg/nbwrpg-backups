She turns\n&gt;toward Windlord and gently places her hands on either side of his\n&gt;head.  &quot;It&#39;s easier to show you than tell you,&quot; she says.  &quot;Try to\n&gt;relax - I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;She reaches out with her mind, drawing Windlord&#39;s feelings for her to\n&gt;the surface.  Empath&#39;s gratified to learn that her initial assessment\n&gt;was correct, but she&#39;s not done.  Briefly, she opens her own mind to\n&gt;the Maximal, allowing him to see all she&#39;s seen - from her creation\n&gt;millions of years ago, through the Great War, to the pain of losing\n&gt;Skywarp to Galvatron&#39;s selfish machinations.  She shows him the\n&gt;reformatting, when she became a predacon trapped under Galvatron&#39;s\n&gt;control; finding the Soul Orb and accidentally freeing herself; and\n&gt;finally, she shows the recent events that have drawn them to this\n&gt;moment - and the fact that her own emotions mirror his.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Fotos: la forma m�s f�cil de compartir e imprimir fotos. \nhttp://photos.msn.es/support/worldwide.aspx\n\n\n"}}
