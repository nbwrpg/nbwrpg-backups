The score is =\r\n\n&gt; 106 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Ballers and 102 for the Gorrilaz.  The story=\r\n so far has \nbeen \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play by Gorzo.  Gorzo, A rookie from Cr=\r\nystal University is 30 \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; 34 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shots made.  10 3-pointers a=\r\nnd 15 dunks for a total of 50 \n&gt; &gt; points.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But can the last rank =\r\nGorrilaz with the help of Gorzo beat the \n&gt; &gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rank Ballers? =\r\n Lets go down to the court to see what happens. \n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Court S=\r\nide Announcer:  Hello, we have 20 secounds left in the \n&gt; &gt; game. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Gorrilaz are passing in the ball as we speak.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nA bot wearing a jersey that says &quot;Bentals&quot; passes the ball in \nto \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; bot wearing a jersey thats says &quot;Gorzo&quot;.  Gorzo Dribbles the \n&gt; ball=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down the court and passes it to a bot with a jersey that \n&gt; &gt; say=\r\ns &quot;Bob&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bob then passes it to Bentals and Bentals passes =\r\nit a bot with \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jersey that says &quot;Micko&quot;.  Micko passes the=\r\n ball to Bentals \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bentals passes it to Gorzo.  Gorzo steps up =\r\nto the 3-point \nline \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jumps up making it look like a jump =\r\nshot.  At the last second \nhe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passes it to a jumping bot, which is=\r\n by the goal, whose jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned then slams the ball =\r\nfor an Alley-op(SP?).  \n&gt; &gt; Bots \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a different jersey grab the =\r\nball.  The bots jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reads &quot;Feller&quot;.  Feller passes the ball in =\r\nto a bot with a \n&gt; jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which read &quot;Rauq&quot;.  (Time to make Rauq l=\r\nook Stupid.)  Rauq \n&gt; starts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dribbiling the ball down court when h=\r\ne trips over his own \nfeet. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ball leaves his hands and=\r\n rolls into Gorzo hands.  Gorzo, who \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standing behind the 3-poi=\r\nnt line and takes a jump shot.  The \n&gt; ball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sails into the hoop as=\r\n the Buzzers sounds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Court Side Announcer:  HOLY RUST POCK=\r\nET, THE GORRILAZ WIN 107-\n&gt; &gt; 106.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; THE GORRILAZ WIN!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;5 Years Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Bot that was wearing the Go=\r\nrzo jersey 5 years earlier was \nin \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small 2 person shuttle. =\r\n He is Flying around Earth.  All of a \n&gt; &gt; sudden \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the right wing c=\r\natches on fire and falls down towards Earth as \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shuttle fa=\r\nlls down with the wing.  The shuttle lands near Mid-\n&gt; &gt; Africa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ab=\r\nout 10 miles from where Dewboys Characters are.\n\n\n"}}
