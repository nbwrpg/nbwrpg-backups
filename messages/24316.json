Oh, and you know how Kinger is \nalways complaining about moding? Yes, well, in the past several posts he has \nsaid that Hell Beast is dead. I think that qualifies as a mode.\n\n    The Virus Scanner loacted the Virus. Indded it had surrounded the Spark \nof Hell Beast. But, luckily this Virus Scanner could hold it off for awhile.\n    &quot;Hmm....were going to need something to get rid of this Virus. And I just \nknow what will do the trick. Call Darkmouse.&quot; Megatron ordered. He was going \nto beg her, do anything, for a Liquid Energon transfussion. Just enough to \nkill the Virus off, not nearly as much as she has in her body.\n    Looking to the comm, Megatron says, &quot;Darkmouse, This is Commander \nMEgatron. I beseech you to allow us a quart of your Liquid Energon blood. \nSenator Hell Beast is currently ill and needs it to combat a Virus. If you \nallow us what we ask, we will grant you a favor. Please think our offer over. \nPerhaps this could be the first steps to a treaty of peace between our \nfactions. Thank you agian.&quot; He said finally and logged off, hoping she would \naccept.\n\n\n"}}
