He held it at the ready and slowly approached the \nhostage takers.  His body continued to glow brightly, even though a \nsignifigant amount of power went into his cannon blast.\n\n&lt;Just hurry up and help!&gt; Organics thought as Nightlight \nacknowlegded.  She was injured, in enemy hands, and now almost \nunconscious.  Hellplague had her off the ground, her feet mere \ninches from the dirt.  Malice was on his steady advance, and stopped \nstanding next to Rodimus.\n\nThe Sweep commander sneered as Malice approached.  She tightened her \nhold on Organics&#39; neck, causing her more discomfort.  \n&lt;Soon, Unicron will have the Matrix Bearer, a new follower, and I \nwill have my lizard as a pet.&gt;\nHellplague chuckled, and leered down at Malice.\n&quot;Yes, come here.  Bow down before me, worship me, and I might spare \nyour sister.  Become my servant, and all will be forgiven.&quot; she \nlaughed.\n\nSplattercannon took position behind the hostage takers, holding his \ngatling rifle ready to waste anyone who moved without permission.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Nightlight/BlackNightmare/Hydras/Windlord/Rodimus:\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord still was aimed to HellPlague&#39;s head and readi to take \nany \n&gt; chance to save Organics.\n&gt; \n&gt; **********\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus opened a com lin to Proto and said &quot;What ever you will do \nit \n&gt; don&#39;t have to hurt her&quot; after the com lik was closed he looked at \n&gt; HellPlague and tried to find out quickly what to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; *********\n&gt; BlackNightmare was pleased with the idea of hostage and said &quot;Then \n&gt; we have to give this little gift to Unicron... perhaps he could \ngive \n&gt; her a perfect use...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightstrike whispered &quot;Why not take Prime???? it&#39;s most wort than \n&gt; this one and it seems that he&#39;s most than willing to be a \nvoluntary \n&gt; hostage...&quot;\n&gt; **********\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras picked up the com link and looking to MAxima said &quot;Come lil \n&gt; one... we will have some fun after all&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And leaves the base\n&gt; \n&gt; **********\n&gt; \n&gt; Nigthlight/Sedna picked up the com link and send aencoded message \nto \n&gt; Organics &quot;Hold on...
