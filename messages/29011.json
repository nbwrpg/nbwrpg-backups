Shutting off \nsome non-crucial systems, like scanners, weapons, and jets, he \nmanages to restore his energy to a functional level.\n\nThe Maximal barely manages to follow along with Iron Raptor as she \nwalks off toward the Cybertronian Fire. What she said about him \nnearly ripping her head off confused him. Everything from the time \nthat he was flying after Unicron was a blur, and he couldn&#39;t remember \na thing. The immages that flashed through her mind, however, give \nProwl a little insight on what he had been doing.\n\nIf he had more energy, Prowl might have been sorry for it, though it \nwasn&#39;t really his doing, but right now he barely had energy to stay \nconscious.\n\n-Yeah, I think we need to work on that,- he replies to her, -How did \nI get a second beast mode?-\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCinder follows behind Iron Raptor, worry for Prowl written on her \nface. Mantle and the others follow behind.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRubble enters the Element, heading for the CR chambers.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor looked over towards Mantle after he told her that \nthey&#39;de \n&gt; recovered a crew member of hers and brought him into a CR chamber.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Thank you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Her attention was drawn towards Prowl as he groans, standing up \nwith him \n&gt; in her arms, making sure that he was on his feet so that he \nwouldn&#39;t just \n&gt; keel over into the dust.\n&gt; She looked into his eyes for a sec to make sure that he was \nalright, her \n&gt; hair falling from her sounders.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Was your second beast mode, hun. I transformed into mine and you \n&gt; automatically TFed into your own. But it took you over and luckily \nMantle \n&gt; and his crew turned up before you could rip off my head.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She smiled at him and gave him a little bit of a squeeze, holding \ntight to \n&gt; make sure that he didn&#39;t fall over.\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked up at Mantle and the rest of his crew, smiling.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I think you guys&#39;ll be a real value here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She gestured towards the CF with her chin.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Why don&#39;t we all head in now....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She began to move towards it but very slowly, walking so that \nProwl could \n&gt; get use to haveing his feet under him again.\n&gt; The images of his attack on her flashed in her mind and she did it \non \n&gt; purpose so that Prowl would know what happened, since thoughts \ncould explain \n&gt; things way easier then words.\n&gt; &lt; Maybe we should work on that when we have a little time, hmm?&gt; \nshe thought \n&gt; to him, smooth and gentle so as not to stress him or anything.\n&gt; She didn&#39;t hold anything against him, she understood.\n&gt; But it was important, if she was ever going to be able to use her \nSBM \n&gt; without worrying about him, that Prowl learned to controle that \nthing.*\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris eyed the crew that Mantle belonged to, staying behind and \ngesturing \n&gt; for them to follow Iron Raptor to the CF.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
