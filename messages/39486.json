I&#39;m detecting a battle involving a dozen \nrobots engaging in the Colorado area, more precisely the Rocky Mountain \nregion.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very good, Firestarter.  Send the new recruit, Rainchark, to come aid \nUnitron and I as we engage these enemies.  The other Decepticons will \ncontinue with their salvage operation.  Shockwave out.&quot;\n\nThe comm. link ended and Firestarter sighed.  &quot;Of course, leave me out of the \nbattle.&quot;  He pressed a few more buttons and activated a comm. link with \nRainchark.\n\n&quot;Rainchark, this is Firestarter on the bridge,&quot; he pressed another button and \na compressed amount of data including longitudes and latitudes and 3D maps \nwere sent to the new &#39;Con, &quot;go to these locations where as far as we can tell \ntwo factions are fighting with each other.  Our Emperor Shockwave and other \nsoldier Unitron will be there engaging the enemy, you are to asist them.&quot;\n\n===\n\nSixshot transformed to his biped mode, hovering a dozen feet above the ground \nas his long range scans came to a finish.  &quot;The area is clear!&quot; he called \ndown to his comrades, slowly lowering to the ground softly.\n\n&quot;This brings back memories,&quot; Ares muttered as he finished staring at the site \nof the once proud Newcomer base, &quot;old Koga Shuko didn&#39;t know what hit him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who cares about Koga Puko?  We&#39;ve got a job to do.&quot; Injector said, pushing \npast the two others, Double Punch and Manterror following behind.\n\n&quot;Hell Beast had a single salvage operation earlier, but he didn&#39;t even get a \nthird of what is here.  How are we going to do this, anyway?&quot; Double Punch \nasked, launching his cyberbee, Beeline, into the air for extra surveillance.\n\n&quot;Ares, Manterror, and I will load up our subspace pockets with as much cargo \nas we can carry, and then Ares and I will load our space fighter modes with \nwreckage and Manterror will act as an escort when we return to the Ramora and \nthen come back here.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sounds good enough.&quot; Ares replied, going at a brisk walk towards the \nwreckage.  &quot;But if you ask me, Unitron should be doing this.  He&#39;s the jerk \nthat blew the damn thing up.&quot;  \n\n"}}
