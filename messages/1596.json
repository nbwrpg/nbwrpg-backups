I.R.&#39;s still with Prowl.)\n\n* Iron Raptor loosens her grip on Prowl&#39;s talons ever so slightly, she never did quite like heights.\nShe had seen Tigerhawk and the new Maximal heading back to base but she still wanted to check out the ship that they had been at.\nShe looked up at Prowl.*\n\n&quot; It seems our Maximal friend has been rescued, but I still wouldn&#39;t mind checking out that ship that he was at. I&#39;m picking up Pred energy signatures from there right now.&quot;\n\n* She then looked ahead of them.*\n\n&quot; Just to make sure that they don&#39;t see us it might be a good idea to land a click or two from their ship, that way we can walk up and check it out without them spotting us. But...only if you want to. After all, you are the designated flyer.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor smiled at this, it was just a small joke but worth a small smile.\nShe thought about what this new ship would look like, but if it belonged to Predacons that it couldn&#39;t look TO good.\nShe sighed, they would know when they got there and not before.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
