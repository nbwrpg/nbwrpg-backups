A cecopho=\r\nny of thoughts\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; memories flooded his consciousness as he watched=\r\n, the name \nMegatron\n&gt; &gt; floating amongst the wave. A constant litanty, par=\r\nt statement part\n&gt; &gt; question, &quot;Megatron, who is the true Megaton.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; It was as if somthing in his programing was attempting to \nemerge.  It\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; reminded him of how he felt when he first emerged here, and that\n&gt; &gt; dri=\r\nve\n&gt; &gt; to find Megatron, but more pronounced. When he heard from Hydras \nin=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; begining he thought his duty was answered, and yet now perhaps=\r\n \nthere\n&gt; &gt; was doubt. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was as if there was something he was su=\r\nppose to do or remember,\n&gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; he could not . . . yet!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With =\r\na shake of his head he cleared his thoughts as the image of\n&gt; &gt; Megatron fa=\r\nded. In frustration and a desire to cover his \ndistraction\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; grunt=\r\ned and spoke over his radio, &quot;Hydras, you had better if get \nout\n&gt; &gt; here i=\r\nf you wish to resolve this as you had hoped!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; (Myrmido=\r\nn)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dodging Trelos while hovering in vehicle mode was in no way \ne=\r\nasy. \n&gt; &gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recieved signifigant scratches to his ventral heatshield=\r\ning, \nbut in\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; few minutes it would be repaired.  In the meantime=\r\n he \ntransformed\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focused his attention to Myrmidon.  A small =\r\npanel on his chest\n&gt; &gt; opened\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and a communication holo emitter.  He m=\r\nade contact with Megatron\n&gt; &gt; via\n&gt; &gt; &gt; internal radio, and the image of th=\r\ne large and powerful \nMegatron X\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stood before Myrmidon.
