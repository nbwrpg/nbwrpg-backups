The real\n        one. Another=\r\n person posted that characters are not allowed to die\n        currently...h=\r\ne is utterly incorrect.\n\n        The problem is the role-playing 101 aspect=\r\n.

When a bot does get damaged\n        what typically happens=\r\n here?\n\n        Here&#39;s the list:\n\n        1) The enemy bot suddenly becomes=\r\n cockeyed unable to hit the broad side of a\n        barn even if he was a g=\r\n1 and standing over it.\n\n        2) The bot never gives chase to his prey. =\r\nIt always lets the long time\n        character slip away.\n\n        3) A sho=\r\nrt stay (a few hours usually) in the CR chamber and any damage is\n        c=\r\nompletely gone.\n\n        4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming=\r\n back as an enemy\n        infiltrator.\n\n        5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an =\r\nevil clone appears which after various meeting\n        with colleagues or &quot;=\r\nloved ones&quot; turns good again. Personality reverts to\n        pre-evil clone=\r\n.\n\n        6) Character &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful offspring. =\r\nPersonality\n        is hardly different.\n\n        7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but t=\r\nhe players 6 other characters cart it&#39;s blasted\n        carcass back to a l=\r\nab where they resurrect him.\n\n        8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with new =\r\nbot same personality...eventually\n        people will forget you died and y=\r\nou can go back to your old form.\n\n        Since most will never let their &quot;=\r\nfavorite&quot; character(s) die, I mean truly\n        die, never come back like,=\r\n there&#39;s really very little new plotlines you can\n        do with them with=\r\nout repeating rehashed already done ones.

Another person posted that characte=\r\nrs are not allowed to \n        die&lt;BR&gt;currently...he is utterly incorrect.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The problem is the \n        role-playing 101 aspect. People are give=\r\nn the&lt;BR&gt;responsibility to judge \n        how much damage they take...howev=\r\ner as we&#39;ve seen&lt;BR&gt;some can&#39;t \n        role-play their way out of a wet pa=\r\nper bag let alone \n        responsibly&lt;BR&gt;judge how much damage their chara=\r\ncter takes. When a bot \n        does get damaged&lt;BR&gt;what typically happens =\r\nhere?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here&#39;s the \n        list:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) The enemy bot suddenly bec=\r\nomes cockeyed unable to hit \n        the broad side of a&lt;BR&gt;barn even if he=\r\n was a g1 and standing over \n        it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) The bot never gives chas=\r\ne to his prey. It always lets the \n        long time&lt;BR&gt;character slip away=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) A short stay (a few hours \n        usually) in the CR chamber a=\r\nnd any damage is&lt;BR&gt;completely \n        gone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4) The character &quot;dies=\r\n&quot; but faked his death coming back as \n        an enemy&lt;BR&gt;infiltrator.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone \n        appears which after vario=\r\nus meeting&lt;BR&gt;with colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; \n        turns good again. Pe=\r\nrsonality reverts to&lt;BR&gt;pre-evil clone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6) \n        Character &quot;dies&quot;=\r\n but is reborn as a more powerful offspring. \n        Personality&lt;BR&gt;is har=\r\ndly different.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but the \n        players 6 other =\r\ncharacters cart it&#39;s blasted&lt;BR&gt;carcass back to a lab \n        where they r=\r\nesurrect him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with new \n        bot same=\r\n personality...eventually&lt;BR&gt;people will forget you died and you \n        c=\r\nan go back to your old form.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since most will never let their \n      =\r\n  &quot;favorite&quot; character(s) die, I mean truly&lt;BR&gt;die, never come back like, \n=\r\n        there&#39;s really very little new plotlines you can&lt;BR&gt;do with them wi=\r\nthout \n        repeating rehashed already done ones. Take for example&lt;BR&gt;th=\r\ne geotrons \n        planing to attack the new cat faction....both factions =\r\nwill&lt;BR&gt;survive, \n        I doubt either player who controls the majority o=\r\nf bots in \n        either&lt;BR&gt;faction is gonna let their characters get anyw=\r\nhere near \n        killed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And what&#39;s to stop this from happening if=\r\n a \n        restart/sequel DOES occur? The&lt;BR&gt;role-playing by some will sti=\r\nll stink, \n        characters will still be incapable of&lt;BR&gt;dying and given=\r\n another year or \n        so all plotlines for THAT game will be&lt;BR&gt;startin=\r\ng to repeat. While I \n        still do believe a restart/sequel is in order=\r\n I&lt;BR&gt;think the \n        role-playing problem needs addressing first to sto=\r\np a repeat \n        of&lt;BR&gt;what&#39;s happening to NBW.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Ori=\r\nginal Message \n        -----&lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@...&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;To: \n        &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Sunday, January 20=\r\n, 2002 5:57 \n        AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: All Read: Important&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; My =\r\nappologies, \n        Narrator, I actually missed your original post.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I find \n        that Neo Beast Wars has been dragged on for too l=\r\nong, and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        world is becoming clogged with bases among ot=\r\nher things. Ideas \n        are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; becoming exausted, if not completely=\r\n exausted already. It \n        seems to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; me that we are almost delay=\r\ning the end of the rpg. If \n        you&#39;ve created&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one storyline th=\r\nat you like, is it not fair to \n        say that you can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; create ano=\r\nther better one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The \n        idea of creating a sequel to =\r\nthe rpg is one that I would agree&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        with. That would require=\r\n several things to happen:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) Changing \n        the name of the RPG=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) Appropriate changes to the \n        website.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3) A mean=\r\ns to store all of everyone&#39;s previous \n        characters (don&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kn=\r\now about everyone else, but I don&#39;t want to \n        lose the bio&#39;s of all&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; my characters).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4) New story (i \n        have an idea, not =\r\nnecessarily for the story, but for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how we \n        could create the=\r\n story).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 5) A catalyst to start us all off (the \n        story shou=\r\nld provide that).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 6) Implementation of new rules, some \n        of =\r\nwhich have been, and are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; being, discussed in the login \n        mes=\r\nsageboard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 7) other stuff that could be written if I wasn&#39;t \n      =\r\n  so tired.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; All in all, since there are more people voting =\r\n\n        anti-restart that I&#39;d&lt;BR&gt;&gt; anticpated, I&#39;ll ask everyone a perh=\r\naps \n        fate deciding question:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Would it be favourable=\r\n to have a \n        sequel instead of a restart?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; --- In \n        nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m \n        agree with Soulstice, restart isn&#39;t good idea. =\r\nAll have good&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        &gt; story-lines and good characters. Perhap=\r\ns the best would be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        eliminate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; less importat c=\r\nharacters of our story-line (every \n        rpgers could&lt;BR&gt;&gt; choice&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; at whom wants eliminate) and \n        elimitante factions where a=\r\nre member&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t posting \n        and join factions that =\r\nhave few characters&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; playing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; That other way than restart.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; \n        &lt;thecode@p...&g=\r\nt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I at first wasn&#39;t \n        sure if I could=\r\n vote in this one. Not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; am I \n        seemingly no=\r\nt too much an important part of this RPG, despite&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        &gt; the=\r\n general current lack of members, and the fact that I&#39;ve \n        been&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for getting close to 2 years, but also I \n        am =\r\nnot involved in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; restart. I have very few \n        charact=\r\ners. Characters that, if the RPG&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n        restarted=\r\n, will still be together (Insecticons, specifically), \n        and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; therefore it wouldn&#39;t harm me to vote yes. However, I \n        don&#39;t t=\r\nhink&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; could vote yes, because I am apposed \n        t=\r\no restarting the RPG. I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; decided to vote no. It just \n    =\r\n    doesn&#39;t make sense to me to end the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; saga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of Neo \n =\r\n       Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked hard over&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n =\r\n       the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; years to keep going. I don&#39;t think that we could \n =\r\n       suddenly pretend&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; never happened, I think it&#39;=\r\ns \n        impossible. Maybe if we ended it and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; started the se=\r\nquel, I \n        wouldn&#39;t mind so much, but otherwise, my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vote&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; is \n        no.
