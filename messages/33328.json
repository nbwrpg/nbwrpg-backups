He \nswung his blade wide, as did the other mirror images. \n\nFiredrill was not sure which one was swinging, and tried to put up his \nshield plating arms against the two furthest Headstrongs. Both blades \npassed harmlessly through his arms, and he realised with horror what \ncame next. He tried to quickly change his arms, but it was too late, \nthree more blades harmlessly passed through him, as one stuck straight \nthrough his shoulder. He screamed out in pain.\n\nHeadstrong spread his feet for grip on the ground, then put his other \nhand on the blade, and strained to send the robot straight up and \nbehind him. He flung Firedrill off his sword, and the Autobot hit the \nground with a sickening thud. He then turned to First Aid, and swung \nto take his head off.\n\n\n\n"}}
