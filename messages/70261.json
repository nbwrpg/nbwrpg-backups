Meanwhile, Quickstride remains in equine form, and continu=\r\nes to kick, buck, stomp, and even motion to bite the enemies if they get to=\r\no close. With his ears aback, smoke billows from his flairing nostrills. As=\r\n his hooves slam on the ground the ground around them vibrates, due to the =\r\nsheer force of his quick but strong movements.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;looks like these chumps=\r\n are just itching ta be turned inta scrap yard material!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap trie=\r\ns an evasive maneuver while scampering in a figure eight pattern beneath hi=\r\ns enemies, hoping that they&#39;d accidentally crash into each other, due to th=\r\ne dizzing motions he&#39;s making.\n\nBlackrazor slowly climbed to his feet, his =\r\nchest still smoking from\nthe blast he took from Legacy. &quot;You&#39;ll pay for tha=\r\nt.&quot; he said quietly\nas he glanced around and then shimmered and vanished fr=\r\nom sight.\n\nMeanwhile Phobia continued to target Rat Trap, she stopped using=\r\n her\nweapon and used her feet, both of wich were stylized like stilletto\nhe=\r\neled shoes. He sent her long dagger like heels at the Rat as he\ntried to ma=\r\nnuver through where she stood. She laughed excitedly as she\ndid so.\n\nLegacy=\r\n on the other hand simply targeted his main cannon on the force\nshield that=\r\n was before him and began to generate in inverse resonance\nbeam to bring do=\r\nwn the shield, the one that had Quickstride seperated\nfrom the group, hopef=\r\nully without damaging Quickstride.\n\nDeepstryke just chuckled as he continue=\r\nd to back away from\nQuickstride, using his weapons to keep the Maximal at b=\r\nay, and yet\ntrying to tease him into continually move forward, away from th=\r\ne\nprotection of the others.\n\n(OOC: Remember, they are still inside the Blac=\r\nk Fortress halls,\nDeepstryke has a shield in place that seperates Quickstri=\r\nde from\nLegacy and Rat Trap, although from the looks of things it is possib=\r\nle\nthat Quickstride is unaware of that. Also one of the opponants:\nBlackraz=\r\nor, has apparently vanished. So far the only enemy the group\nsees is Phobia=\r\n, as she tries to step on Rat Trap and Deepstryke as he\nlures Quickstride f=\r\nurther and further down the hall.\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
