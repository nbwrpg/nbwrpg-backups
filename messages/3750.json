He\n&gt; realized, he was in the CR chamber. It all came back to him why he was in\n&gt; here; the auto-guns commanded from Transulas put him into stasis lock,\n&gt; turning him into a mess of a bot.\n&gt;\n&gt; The mouse! He thought of her, him trying to find out who she was. He\njolted\n&gt; himself into full alert. She could be dead by now, but he had to find out.\n&gt; Fighting if he had to.\n&gt;\n&gt; The door of the chamber lifted, and in an instant, he leaped out and\nlooked\n&gt; around. There were some bots by the door. He charged past them,\nshouldering\n&gt; into one, not really taking the care to look who it was.\n&gt;\n&gt; The ran into the hallway as fast as his short legs could carry him. He\ncame\n&gt; across the room where he was shot. He looked in, preparing to see the dead\n&gt; mouse, Transulas still in there--but instead it was empty.\n&gt;\n&gt; He ran back to the crowd, calling, &quot;Where&#39;s that mouse-bot? Transulas had\n&gt; her!&quot; His curiosity wouldn&#39;t back down.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Find out your risk for Diabetes and win one of 40 cash prizes.\n&gt; For every test taken, we&#39;ll donate a $1 for research.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5600/10/_/_/_/961349640/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
