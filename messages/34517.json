Rion pushed through the thick vegetation on the other side of \nthe trees and stopped short.\n\n(I&#39;m going to let you take it from here Meg^_^)\n\n* * * * *\n\nSwyft:\n\n(I didn&#39;t get a reply to my last e-mail, so I&#39;m just gonna... do something, \nyea...)\n\nA light scraping noise and small scratches marked Syft&#39;s passing as she \ndragged her claws against the left wall of the hallway. She was a little \nbored and had not been listening to Devilduer&#39;s response (If there was one):\n\n&quot;Who did you say your leader was?&quot;\n\n* * * * *\n\nTavatron:\n\nTavatron stretched and groaned as she pushed herself into an akward position \nagainst the side of the CR chamber. It had taken a while, but all of the \ninternal damage had been repaired.\n\n&lt;No thanks to you.&gt;\n\n&#39;What is that supposed to mean?&#39;\n\nTavatron rubbed the side of her head as she pushed the CR hatch open all the \nway. She clambered out, her legs unsteady after being in a confined space \nfor so long. She stretched one, then the other before leaning back and \ntwisting, listening as her back cracked into place.\n\n&lt;You&#39;ve nearly gotten us killed numerous times since our arrival. I don&#39;t \nplan on dying anytime soon. You, on the other hand, are expendable.&gt;\n\nTavatron&#39;s body became rigid as waves of electricity shot through her. The \nvoltage forced her to lean against the wall for support and dig her claws \ninto the thick metal. Finally, after several antagonizing minutes Tavatron \nwas able to force Tav to release her hold on the form they shared and \ncollapsed against the wall.\n\n&#39;That... hurt.&#39;\n\n&lt;Yes, and there is nothing you can do about--&gt;\n\nTav cried out as Tavatron mentally shut her out from any conscious thought.\n\n&quot;Finally, peace.&quot;\n\nTavatron walked through what remained of the original CF. It seemed a lot \nhad happened since she entered the &#39;R chamber. The battle still raged, but \non a less impressive scale. The sounds told her what little she needed to \nknow. Tavatron left the ship and watched as the Decepticons battled with the \nMaximals and vice versa.\n\n(If I made any mistakes lemme know, kay?)\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
