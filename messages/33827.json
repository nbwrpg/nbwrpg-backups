He smiled and aimed his missile launcher. Rixer fired two seeking \nmissiles at Reflector and then twenty plasma shots at him. This battle was a \nbreathe so far.\n\n\nBlyer saw a jet flying by behind him, and his scanners told him that the jet \nwas Firestarter. He lowered altitude, eager to shot this Pred who&#39;s boss, \nand fired two missiles down at him. He then aimed his machine gun and fired \ntwenty laser shots.\n\n\nSeeing that Hell Beast wasn&#39;t at the battle anymore, Truttle turned his \nattention to Injector. He fired twenty shots from each machine gun at him.\n\n\nForrior watched his shots hit and smiled. His cannon fired another plasma \nshot at Predator, but this one was aimed down toward the ground. It made a \nhuge explosion when it hit and would hopefully envelop Predator in it.\n\n\n\nMantle entered the Element and looked around. A screen lowered in front of \nhim with a boyish face of a bot on it.\n\n&quot;Hello Mantle!&quot; Cyndro&#39;s voice sounded from the panel. &quot;How&#39;s the battle?&quot;\n\n&quot;Pretty good, Cyndro.&quot; replied Mantle. &quot;We might have use for your nano bots \nsoon, Cyndro. Can you prepare them.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure can!&quot; The panel folded back into the roof and Mantle turned around to \nwait for Epyon.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
