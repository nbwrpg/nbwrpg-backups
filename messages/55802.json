She went running \nwildly around some of the trees, smelling the drones.  She saw one \nand went running up to it. It sped off through the trees and found \nanother hiding spot.  She stopped and thought about what happened. \nShe tried to sneek up on a drone. She was about to pounce on one, \nthen it senced her and flew off.  She was starting to get a little \ndiscouraged. She started scouting around, looking for another drone.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blackfang: You have to get all the drones to the ground, but beware!\n&gt; if they hear you coming, they&#39;ll flee away.
