So I have no clue who Prowl is looking at. Sorry.)\n\n* Zyber trotted out of Rowdy&#39;s cave and began to sniff around for the plants and herds she needed to heal Striker, she kept her nose to the ground and soon came up with the sent of pond lily. She smiled as she began to follow it&#39;s sent.\nSoon Zyber cane to a shallow pond and looked into it&#39;s waters, there was lily there but half of it was submerged. She sighed as she waded into the pond and took a few of the soft white flowers from the pads.\nShe walked out of the pond and shook every limb in turn until she was sure that they were not soaking wet. Now it was time to find what she needed most...devil&#39;s club.*\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n* Iron Raptor exited the Ark and looked up at the damage when Prowl mentioned it.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve got the ship&#39;s repair system working on that right now, it&#39;ll take a few mega-cycles but it&#39;ll be done.&quot;\n\n* She then looked at Prowl and smiled.*\n\n&quot; Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll be complete before the next attack.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then looked out at the scene before her and sighed, smoking craters and blast areas...a typical battle field. She took a few steps forward and scanned, her scanners picked up a stray signature heading towards the Predacon base. They indicated that the signature was that of Plintissa&#39;s, but why would she be going to the Pred base willingly?\nIron Raptor looked back at Prowl with concern.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve got a stray signature on my screen here, I think that it&#39;s Plintissa but why would she be going to the Pred base?&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
