As a precaution, he seals off the foyer, then sets up his \n&gt; accessory - a large electric fan.  Switching it on to full power \n&gt; causes quite a wind, and Jackie smiles behind his protective \n&gt; faceplate.  He&#39;s partly counting on that wind to keep him safe.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Autobot opens the main doors just far enough for his sample drone \n&gt; to get through, and gives his windmaker one final adjustment to make \n&gt; sure it&#39;s blowing the right way.  Then he opens a three-foot hole in \n&gt; the shields and sends the plastic &#39;bot on its way.  &quot;Taking sample \n&gt; now,&quot; he reports over the comm, raising his voice to compensate for \n&gt; the loud whirring of the fan.  &quot;No problems thus far.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; &gt; Kup(via commlink): Hmm, that&#39;s a good idea.
