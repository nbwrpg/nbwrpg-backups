There was no way he was going to be\n&gt; turned against his comrades.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;NO!  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!  You might enjoy being evil, Rodimus but I a by\n&gt; no means as susceptible as you are to evil influences!  And nothing any of\n&gt; you say or do will make me change  my mind!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He stares at Magmatron with a thunderous roar in his voice.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;He is quite loud isn&#39;t he.&quot; SABERBACK said as he winced from the\nthunderous volume in TUSCON&#39;s voice.\n\n&quot;He has always been a loud mouth! I remember him from my days on\nCybertron.&quot; DARK RODIMUS said as he pointed at TUSCON, his optics\nblazing in response to the roar. &quot;This new form has just made it more\nobvious!&quot;\n\nHARDHEAD and HYDRA were about to hit TUSCON with the butt of their\nweapons when MAGMATRON held up his hand. &quot;No, do not harm him.&quot; He\nsaid, his voice full of amusement, he did not seem to be as much\naffected by the volume as SABERBACK or DARK RODIMUS.  &quot;At least not\nyet.&quot;\n\nHARDHEAD and HYDRAS both nodded as they lowered their weapons and\nGUILEDART resumed his standing posture.\n\n&quot;What shall we do with him my lord?&quot; GUILEDART said, looking up at the\nmuch taller MAGMATRON.\n\nSmiling MAGMATRON folded his arms over his chest. &quot;tell me my dark\nknight, will he do well in the games?&quot; He glanced at DARK RODIMUS\n\nDARK RODIMUS looked at TUSCON speculatively, much like one might\nexamine a horse or a dog before a purchase. &quot;Perhaps. He has always\nbeen a maverick. Maybe it will be put to better use there.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good. have him taken to the pens and made ready.&quot; MAGMATRON said as\nhe looked back at GUILEDART.\n\nMAGMATRON glanced over at SABERBACK as he detected a slight frown.\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you will be able to have your fun with him.&quot;\n\nMAGMATRON turned to address TUSCON, &quot;Oh and yes, all of you start out\nthis way. Full of themselves.&quot; He smiled, &quot;I love to see it. It means\nyou will be around for a while.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
