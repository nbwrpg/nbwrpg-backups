She smiles to Kup.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Thanks Kup, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll keep my end of the bargain no matter what! \n&gt; Now, ta find my brother and get this party started!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In the tunnel, Tucson puts up his headlights, and scans the tunnels. He \n&gt; does catch a faint signature resonating from his sensors.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re right Perceptor, it is Rodimus.  And by the way, about all that \n&gt; you told me, I&#39;m glad you did.  Now I know everything there is to know.  I \n&gt; may not have been able to read Kups&#39; reviews of these tunnels, but I will \n&gt; be sure to do so when we get back to the Ark.  And I&#39;m not mad at you for \n&gt; anything Perceptor.  In fact, I&#39;m highly proud of you for expressing the \n&gt; courage to confess.  Now, let&#39;s go find Rodimus and bring him back to the \n&gt; Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; As they were conversing, Quickstride had made it to the mouth of the \n&gt; tunnel, as Straight Shot dismounts and kneels down beside it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Okaaaay, looks like we&#39;re taking a real shot in the dark Quickstride.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The maximal transforms into robot mode and kneels down.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yeah, big time.  Okay, let&#39;s go.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He helps to lower her down into the tunnel.  She can hear Tucson loud and \n&gt; clear.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I hear him!  Follow me!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She begins to make her way into the tunnel, following her brother&#39;s voice. \n&gt; The bean pods once again react in Quickstride&#39;s gut as a noxious gas fills \n&gt; the cavern.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; What&#39;s that smell?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride gives a sheepish grin.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sorry. That - happens when I overdose on the bean pods.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The scent wafts through the caverns.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OOC: It is possible that Tuscon has also read a similar report from Kup \n&gt;&gt; as\n&gt;&gt; well, since he was also there near the same time. I will post tomorrow to\n&gt;&gt; give Sandy a chance to catch up. Just keep in mind that the tunnel is\n&gt;&gt; treacherous, cave ins are likely if one is not careful and the creature \n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; has what appears to be Rodimus seems to be moving about as fast as Tuscon\n&gt;&gt; can typcially drive. At the moment the cave tunnel is open and clear and \n&gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; about 8-10 feet wide and tall, the walls are sheer as if cut by an energy\n&gt;&gt; beam, although there are spots where the wall has caved slightly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; IE: The chase will not be an easy one, so let&#39;s have some fun.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Mon, May 10, 2010 at 7:32 PM, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor::\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;QUICK!!!

A scan reveals some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of mechanoid, possibly minion in origin carrying a shape or mass\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that could possibly be Rodimus. The creature read as insect like,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; although the shape was unfamiliar. However the creature quickly\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; continued down the tunnel out of easy scanning range.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Also Perceptor may remember from a report from Scorponok that these\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; tunnels used to lead all the way back to the Ark, beneath the Earth&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ocean. Although it is unlikely that all the tunnel is still intact\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; after all this time.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However there is one notable fact in there: There was a fairly large\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; chamber about half way or so that appeared to be filled with some \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sort\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of minion based technology. Scorponok&#39;s last view of the chamber was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it being filled with magma.
