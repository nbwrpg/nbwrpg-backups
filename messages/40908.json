Sure gunthers, from what Ive heard from some people \nyour one of the biggest complainers period. And Gunthers, Sunlight \nnever reaches the bottom, as far as it goes underwater is I believe \n500 or 1000 feet. And Rdahl can tell us how deep the decepts actually \nwere. And TF physics arent the same, do you see people walking around \nthe north or sound pole? No, Do you see people generating energon \ncubes? No. And Missiles wouldnt neccessarily be crushed, after all \nthe Cybertronian armor is abonormally durable, this isnt ordinary \nsteel here, and the infecticons dont make everything oiut of that \nalloy anyways and are much older and advanced then the cybertronians. \nEither one could have advanced stuff far enough to operate \nunderwater. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; dude shut up.......when they were firing missiles were they 20,000 \n&gt; leagues under the ocean......they weren&#39;t at a part where quote &quot;no \n&gt; sunlight can get to&quot; un quote.  you built your base there, so tough \n&gt; shit.....it is still hard to get to because it is in the bottom of \nthe \n&gt; ocean....TF physics are the same as Earths.  Missiles will have \n&gt; the gravitatioal force on them, and water will have the same \ndensity \n&gt; and comression that also creates the friction..........and ppl \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; complain to you cuz you never seem to notice your problems your \n&gt; self and can&#39;t give up a talk fight......so they would rather just \nnot \n&gt; go through with talking to you, beacuse they don&#39;t want to ....\n\n\n"}}
