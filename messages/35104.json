These codes won&#39;t work.  They may be able get\n&gt; &gt; through the energy shield but my new organic shiled only reacts to the\n&gt; &gt; codes. That is why I had them specially numbered and incripted. I\n&gt; &gt; understand from your bio that you are the tech master here at Chivtron\n&gt; &gt; and feel free to remain that. My function is defense strictly and that\n&gt; &gt; is what i am doing. Now please don&#39;t get jealous that I was able to\n&gt; &gt; get the shields up and protect the base where you couldn&#39;t.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Obfucious::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     He stands out of sight on the bridge watching as people get\n&gt; &gt; their codes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He walks off to an auxiliary computer.  &quot;He comes in and thinks he\n&gt; &gt; runs this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tech operation now.  We&#39;ll see about that.&quot;  He uses the computer to\n&gt; &gt; take a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look at the program creating and controlling the shielding codes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Interesting work, I&#39;m almost impressed.&quot;  He then sets about a\n&gt; &gt; flurry of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; programing to duplicate the program.  It didn&#39;t take very long\n&gt; &gt; because he had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a template by looking at Grounded&#39;s program.  He then created four\n&gt; &gt; codes.  He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; connected himself to the computer and downloaded one code.  With\n&gt; &gt; that done he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sets up a fire wall so that only he can get at this new program.  He\n&gt; &gt; opens a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tight band com to Aerotaur, Perplex, and Windlord.  &quot;Please come\nto my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; position.&quot;  He was going to offer a code to Nightlight but he had\n&gt; &gt; seen her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; receive one from Grounded.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
