Not good! And just so people\n&gt; know, i treat any post that cuts me off like that as\n&gt; invalid, for the very reason i stated 2 sentances\n&gt; back.\n&gt; \n&gt;  --- Jerame Johnson &lt;jeramej@y...&gt; wrote: &gt; HEy\n&gt; Bro I Post once a day and that is when I go to\n&gt; &gt; bed But I am so COnfused right now as to what is\n&gt; &gt; going on in the game.
