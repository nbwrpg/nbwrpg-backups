She blinked and rubbed her optics. Her optics were \n&gt; coming into focus when the little girl said she was a maximal. She \n&gt; jumped out of the Cr chamber,  jumping over Cam&#39;s head and lands on \n&gt; all four paws, looking at the child. &quot;Your a maximal?&quot; She looked \n&gt; around and her optics landed on Blackfang. She stared at him for a \n&gt; moment. &quot;If your a maximal, then why are my commands, still intact? \n&gt; TERRORIZE!&quot;  And transforms into bot mode. Her black matte body, \n&gt; sleek and slender. Her wolf tail flowing behind her. Her red optics \n&gt; bright and vibrant. Her stood there,looking at Blackfang, then to \n&gt; Cam, and back to Blackfang. &quot;Why am I here?&quot; Her face showing no \n&gt; fear, but puzzlement. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you kill me?
