Quickstrike forced \nmore careful steps in walking so he wouldn&#39;t loose his balance and \nfall. \n\nHe could feel it, his body was fighting the cold as well as trying to \nstable his odd damage. It was internal, he knew that. If it was fatal \nor not, he couldn&#39;t tell. Sometimes a bot couldn&#39;t find that out \nuntil it was too late. He just didn&#39;t trust Megatron around with this \nsort of damage. He was nervous that he could kill him, if he thought \nhe couldn&#39;t stand up to his duties. \n\nBeing made for war was sometimes difficult, but he took pride in it \nbecause he liked it. He was used to it. It was instinct for him to \nfight.\n\nHe had to close his optics a few times to stop himself from loosing \nhis orientation. If he had some energy maybe he could straighten his \nproblem out a little bit more. Maybe all he needed to fix it was \nenergy that was used up. He stopped to think what he could do. \n\nHe looked around at the vast snowy wasteland. It was like his lone \ntrip to Asia he did a while ago. He turned and walked off towards the \neast, taking a mile to get to another spot that was no promising of \nhunting. It would be easy. He knew of few tricks on lone hunting. His \nrobot mode worked the best because he didn&#39;t have to run after it. \nAnd running after something in the snow like this would be the \nInferno. He could manage the terrain and weather, but not like this. \nHis trip to Asia gave him some experience, as well as his short \ntraining from Rowdy Wolf. \n\n\n"}}
