I&#39;m in...somewhat a normal place.  Washington State!  I&#39;ve\n&gt; exited Alaska.  I&#39;m at my computer and -- WHAT THE HELL!?  1000 e-mails!?\n&gt;     Who the hell do you think I am, Jesus Christ?  Well...don&#39;t tell\n&gt; anyone...but...\n&gt;\n&gt;     You may think I have fully returned...but unfortunately, that is new\n&gt; true.  I was going to read the e-mails...but 1000...I&#39;m just going to get\n&gt; info from the other Council members.  The Events page...I was hoping\nYanshosh\n&gt; would take care of it, but that isn&#39;t the case.  So, that won&#39;t be updated\n&gt; for the days I was gone.  Sorry.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I plan on being back in da game tomorrow after having a nice long chat\n&gt; with Yanshosh.  My dad and brother will be gone, so Junior Czar Unitron\n(me),\n&gt; will have ze whole house to himself.\n&gt;\n&gt;     So, if you&#39;ve got any formal complaints with me, no offense intended,\nbut\n&gt; it&#39;s midnight, I&#39;m kind of tired, &quot;Unhappily Everafter&quot; is coming on, so\nyou\n&gt; can shove &#39;em.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Unitron\n&gt; &quot;Working for a better tomorrow, for himself.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Wish you had something rad to add to your email?\n&gt; We do at www.supersig.com.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6810/13/_/_/_/964162977/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
