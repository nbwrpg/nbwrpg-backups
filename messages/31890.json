I\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; hope you&#39;re considering joining us.  Both of you.  Although\nit may\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; be a bit\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; dull for you Angel Prime.  We don&#39;t get many attacks way out\nhere.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; And we\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; aren&#39;t equipped to attack anyone.  But we could really use the\n&gt;   &gt; help.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;  We need\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; to get some shields on this base.&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; ::Obfucious::\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;     Still standing outside the base, &quot;Sirs I&#39;ve been thinking\n&gt;   &gt; about\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; this\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; problem.  I think I can develop a different type of\nshielding for\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; the base.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; It wouldn&#39;t be the best but it might work.  First we&#39;d need\n&gt;   &gt; typical\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; force\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; type shielding for use against missiles, lasers, etceteras.\n&gt;   &gt; Second\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; a type of\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; back up shielding.  It wouldn&#39;t affect incoming attacks but it\n&gt;   &gt; would\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; affect\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; the incoming attackers.  A typical shield system uses a\nbubble of\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; force to\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; stop attacks. But deflecting them takes energy and they can be\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; brought down.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; I propose focusing energon in such a way that it creates a\nbubble\n&gt;   &gt; of an\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; energon field around the base.  This would prevent bots from\n&gt;   &gt; getting\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; through.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;  Unfortunately the instability would mean we couldn&#39;t get out\n&gt;   &gt; while\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; they&#39;re\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; up.  We would have to attack from well within the bubble to\n&gt;   &gt; prevent\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; stasis\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; lock.  Our shots will still be able to pass through the\nshielding\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; but theirs\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; would not.  And the energon shields would last until the energon\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; power source\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; ran out.  It wouldn&#39;t last more than a day or two but that would\n&gt;   &gt; be\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; enough to\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; repair and get back to battle.&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;Next for weapon systems we&#39;ll need automated turrets.\n&gt;   &gt; Mounted\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; in the\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; mountain side and around the base.  I&#39;d also like a mine field\n&gt;   &gt; but that\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be necessary.  Maybe some more primitive traps,\nlike the\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; hole we&#39;re\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; one step to the right of, or the logs.  They&#39;re primitive but\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; effective.&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;The shielding I can modify and repair from spare parts\nin the\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; base but I\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t think I can make turrets from anything in there.  I&#39;ll\nneed\n&gt;   &gt; at\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; least\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; one example and some spare parts to build more with.&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;I think it&#39;s time we visit the Maximals again Windlord.\n They\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; owe us a\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; favor or two.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Yahoo!
