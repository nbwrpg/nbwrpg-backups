However \n&gt; the transformation process hurt like hell. Rodimus looked extreamly injured by \n&gt; now. Ripped shreds of his armor were sticking out everywhere. Mech fluids \n&gt; leaking from the wounds.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: And you think I&#39;m done?

His wings were broken \n&gt; and could no longer glide..if he had to hed use the thrusters on his feet. \n&gt; Fire shot out from numerous places, lava like substance came from his mouth, \n&gt; inside the two bots were hatching a plan..&quot;What does it take to kill this \n&gt; Maximal!&quot; screamed Galvatron, &quot;Yesss.. he is a true foe indeed..&quot; Megatron \n&gt; said with a snarl.

I posted for a little damage to \n&gt; &gt; Hydras, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but nothing critical.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus brought his arms down in a &quot;x&quot; formation, forcing the swords, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras&#39; arms down. Rodimus then grabbed Hydras around the wrist with his \n&gt; &gt; left \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand. He dug his saw which was in the place of his right hand, down into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras&#39; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arm. With his balance on his left arm, Roddy flipped both legs up to \n&gt; double \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dropkick Hydras. After hitting this he back flips away and to his feet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just then Perceptor is heard over the comm system.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus stands motionless, and optics look empty, like all hope had been \n&gt; &gt; lost. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But then...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Enough of this! Maximals, kill these bastards in cold \n&gt; fluid!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; face shows nothing but hate. He grits his teeth together, while \n&gt; &gt; &gt; letting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out an yell that could destroy an audio receptor. He is almost fomeing at \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mouth, with the mixed mech fluids that leak from it. The anger causes his \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; normally blue optic sensors to turn a crimson red. His gaze locked on \n&gt; Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus empties his mouth, spitting all the energon and other mech fluids \n&gt; &gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his mouth at Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: On this day, Galvatron, I&#39;ll finally KILL YOU!!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus transformes to car mode and fires his propulsion rockets. Full \n&gt; power \n&gt; &gt; &gt; all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at once, sending Rodimus Prime at Hydras&#39; gut at an airborn 300mph!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the Maximal base Kup was about to take Elita from Cam...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: Give her here...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Perceptos message came over the comm sytem as well as a picture on \n&gt; all \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the monitors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: By primus no...
