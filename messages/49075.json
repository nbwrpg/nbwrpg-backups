We have \n&gt; four auto guns, two laser turrets, and a missile launcher. That&#39;s \n&gt; all I was able to put together from the scraps I was given.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good...&quot; Megatron says, pleased that at least something was a 100% \n&gt; success. &quot;Prepare them to be set up when my forces return. Megatron \n&gt; out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade nods to the comm, &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll have em there in a \n&gt; jiffy.&quot; He begins to drag the bulky weapons to the storage bay.\n\n\n"}}
