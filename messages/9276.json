He circled \naround and let out a high pitched howl, it would attract attention \nbut it would also let it know that he knew that it was there.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; The Tiger leaves the area of the pod and roams forth.  It can smell \n&gt; the scent of a wolf and it looks about.  It lets out a low growl \nand \n&gt; slowly walks on.  It follows the scent trail left by the wolf.  the \n&gt; tiger knows it&#39;s getting closer to it&#39;s prey because the scent \ntrail \n&gt; is getting strong.  It uses stealth and cunning to follow it&#39;s next \n&gt; meal.
