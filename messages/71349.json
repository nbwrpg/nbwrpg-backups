Hydras needs to be \n&gt; stopped, but I can not =\r\nexpect any of you to become vulnerable to his attack, \n&gt; when it is I who s=\r\nhould be doing something about him personally.

I read up on it, you didn&#39;t do anything \n&gt; wro=\r\nng, you were out there going above and beyond the call of duty and you \n&gt; w=\r\nere unexpectedly hit from behind. There was no way you could have avoided \n=\r\n&gt; what happened to you. Although, we don&#39;t know who did it do we? That \n&gt; w=\r\nasn&#39;t in the intel I read. Guys, We can&#39;t let Tucson face Hydras all \n&gt; alo=\r\nne, it&#39;s way too dangerous.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot looks to Leo Prime and ever=\r\nyone else.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Leo Prime,everyone, I believe I know how ta fill in the ga=\r\nps as to what \n&gt; happened vorns ago. I was with him during that battle. He =\r\nhad finished \n&gt; dealing with some of the heavy hitting battlechargers, when=\r\n he noticed that \n&gt; Rodimus and the others were getting seriously pegged ou=\r\nt in battle. He \n&gt; couldn&#39;t just sit there and watch it happen, and he knew=\r\n that decoy detail \n&gt; wasn&#39;t best suited for his alt form which at the time=\r\n, was more designed for \n&gt; utility and off road driving. But he couldn&#39;t ba=\r\nre to see anyone suffer or \n&gt; be oppressed so he did the unthinkable, and b=\r\neyond his ability \n&gt; specifications, he sped out there to catch the attenti=\r\nons of the Seekers, \n&gt; who were concentrating on striking at the Autobot sp=\r\needsters. Well, Tucson \n&gt; got their attention and began to draw them away f=\r\nrom Rodimus and the others, \n&gt; but then, un be known to him, way out in the=\r\n distance, Cyclonus hid himself \n&gt; nicely among cloud cover, and decided to=\r\n take a pop shot at Tucson. Well, I \n&gt; saw out of the rear view, Cyclonus i=\r\nn the distance, and then I saw the shot \n&gt; coming toward us. After that, Tu=\r\ncson and I were struck, but I was the only \n&gt; one who saw the shot and the =\r\nperpetrator. Then, anything after the strike, \n&gt; I really don&#39;t remember.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Night Shift now hobbles into the room slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I do. I - was the=\r\nre too. I could see Cyclonus headn&#39; toward &#39;em, but I \n&gt; was so far off fig=\r\nhtn&#39; some of the combaticons, I couldn&#39;t get there fast \n&gt; enough ta swing =\r\nTucson or Straight Shot outa the way. I was miles behind \n&gt; them and no mat=\r\nter how loud I beeped my horn ta warn &#39;em, they couldn&#39;t \n&gt; hear me. Then, =\r\nyeah, I saw that slag ball hit my buddy, and there was an \n&gt; explosion that=\r\n went miles up in the sky.. I thought for sure he was a \n&gt; gonner.. I did m=\r\ny best ta get back up, and then got Tucson back ta base.. \n&gt; He was off lin=\r\ne for a long time, and when he woke up, he thought the power \n&gt; went out.. =\r\nLittle did he know he was struck blind by Cyclonus, never ta see \n&gt; the lig=\r\nht of day again, or at least until he got a second opinion from a \n&gt; medic.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot knew that Talon would also like to see Tucson get his =\r\nsight \n&gt; back. She smiles to Talon and puts a hand on hers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I think =\r\nTalon said it best, when she said it was time we gave Tucson back \n&gt; his ey=\r\nes. Leo Prime, before anything else, I think it&#39;s time you guys \n&gt; fought a=\r\ns a whole, and you really can&#39;t do that unless all of you can see \n&gt; the ro=\r\nad ahead of you. So, if I may do so, I want to request that Tucson \n&gt; Prime=\r\n undergoes a detailed examination and full repair of his visual \n&gt; impairme=\r\nnt.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson looks to Straight Shot and Talon.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They&#39;re right. It&#39;=\r\ns time I stopped procrastinating. Stanton, Bump, I \n&gt; would like to give yo=\r\nu two the honor of undergoing this proceedure. I&#39;ve \n&gt; seen your work, and =\r\nI would be honored if you would perform the repairs.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks to ever=\r\nyone confidently.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We will do this, we will overcome every obsticle t=\r\nhey&#39;ve put in front of \n&gt; us.

There was no way you could have avoided &lt;br&gt;\nwhat happened to =\r\nyou.  Although, we don&#39;t know who did it do we?  That &lt;br&gt;\nwasn&#39;t in the in=\r\ntel I read.  Guys, We can&#39;t let Tucson face Hydras all &lt;br&gt;\nalone, it&#39;s way=\r\n too dangerous.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStraight Shot looks to Leo Prime and everyone els=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Leo Prime,everyone, I believe I know how ta fill in the gaps a=\r\ns to what &lt;br&gt;\nhappened vorns ago.  I was with him during that battle.  He =\r\nhad finished &lt;br&gt;\ndealing with some of the heavy hitting battlechargers, wh=\r\nen he noticed that &lt;br&gt;\nRodimus and the others were getting seriously pegge=\r\nd out in battle.  He &lt;br&gt;\ncouldn&#39;t just sit there and watch it happen, and =\r\nhe knew that decoy detail &lt;br&gt;\nwasn&#39;t best suited for his alt form which at=\r\n the time, was more designed for &lt;br&gt;\nutility and off road driving.  But he=\r\n couldn&#39;t bare to see anyone suffer or &lt;br&gt;\nbe oppressed so he did the unth=\r\ninkable, and beyond his ability &lt;br&gt;\nspecifications, he sped out there to c=\r\natch the attentions of the Seekers, &lt;br&gt;\nwho were concentrating on striking=\r\n at the Autobot speedsters.  Well, Tucson &lt;br&gt;\ngot their attention and bega=\r\nn to draw them away from Rodimus and the others, &lt;br&gt;\nbut then, un be known=\r\n to him, way out in the distance, Cyclonus hid himself &lt;br&gt;\nnicely among cl=\r\noud cover, and decided to take a pop shot at Tucson.  Well, I &lt;br&gt;\nsaw out =\r\nof the rear view, Cyclonus in the distance, and then I saw the shot &lt;br&gt;\nco=\r\nming toward us.  After that, Tucson and I were struck, but I was the only &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\none who saw the shot and the perpetrator.  Then, anything after the str=\r\nike, &lt;br&gt;\nI really don&#39;t remember.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNight Shift now hobbles into t=\r\nhe room slowly.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; I do.  I - was there too.  I could see Cyclonus =\r\nheadn&#39; toward &#39;em, but I &lt;br&gt;\nwas so far off fightn&#39; some of the combaticon=\r\ns, I couldn&#39;t get there fast &lt;br&gt;\nenough ta swing Tucson or Straight Shot o=\r\nuta the way.  I was miles behind &lt;br&gt;\nthem  and no matter how loud I beeped=\r\n my horn ta warn &#39;em, they couldn&#39;t &lt;br&gt;\nhear me.  Then, yeah, I saw that s=\r\nlag ball hit my buddy, and there was an &lt;br&gt;\nexplosion that went miles up i=\r\nn the sky.. I thought for sure he was a &lt;br&gt;\ngonner..  I did my best ta get=\r\n back up, and then got Tucson back ta base.. &lt;br&gt;\nHe was off line for a lon=\r\ng time, and when he woke up, he thought the power &lt;br&gt;\nwent out..  Little d=\r\nid he know he was struck blind by Cyclonus, never ta see &lt;br&gt;\nthe light of =\r\nday again, or at least until he got a second opinion from a &lt;br&gt;\nmedic.&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStraight Shot knew that Talon would also like to see Tucson get his =\r\nsight &lt;br&gt;\nback.  She smiles to Talon and puts a hand on hers.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; I=\r\n think Talon said it best, when she said it was time we gave Tucson back &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nhis eyes.  Leo Prime, before anything else, I think it&#39;s time you guys &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nfought as a whole, and you really can&#39;t do that unless all of you can s=\r\nee &lt;br&gt;\nthe road ahead of you.  So, if I may do so, I want to request that =\r\nTucson &lt;br&gt;\nPrime undergoes a detailed examination and full repair of his v=\r\nisual &lt;br&gt;\nimpairment.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTucson looks to Straight Shot and Talon.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;They&#39;re right.  It&#39;s time I stopped procrastinating.  Stanton, Bum=\r\np, I &lt;br&gt;\nwould like to give you two the honor of undergoing this proceedur=\r\ne.  I&#39;ve &lt;br&gt;\nseen your work, and I would be honored if you would perform t=\r\nhe repairs.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHe looks to everyone confidently.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; We will =\r\ndo this, we will overcome every obsticle they&#39;ve put in front of &lt;br&gt;\nus.  =\r\nBut we must work as a team if we&#39;re to achieve success.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a=\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Kup&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Kup looked in sadnes=\r\ns how Windlord Stormed out the room and then he looked &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; at Tucson =\r\nsaid  =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93It seems that Nighlight is in her old self...
