She had known this was going to \nhappen...but seeing as how she was out numbered....\n    &quot;Well, if it isnt the mighty and all powerful Killfest. Its so nice to \nsee you here. Where exactly are you guys headed?&quot; She asked, her hands raised \nabove her head, weapons on the ground, and a cocky tone in her voice. \n\n    Megatron shook his head at Megaton. &quot;Dont threaten me you sorry excuse \nfor a clone. Come on, we need to return to base. Aerostreak, go and rendevous \nwith Nighteyes. Report back on her progress.&quot;\n    Aerostreak nodded and transformed into a hawlk. He soard into the sky and \nheaded to Nighteyes location.\n\n    Ominous tapped Quasar awake. The operation was over, she was now a full \nfunctioning Energonian. Weather or not she wanted to be one wasnt an issue. \nIf she decided to leave Ominous, she wouldnt live past a week. Her Liquid \nEnergon fule tank would drain, leaving her dead.\n    &quot;Wake up Quasar. We have errands to run.&quot;\n\n    Akron saw Darkmouse...and the other bots. They had just captured another \nPredacon. She didnt understand why the Predacons were fighting amongst each \nother....but then agian she didnt understand half the things going on in the \nwar.\n    &quot;Darkmouse, your going to have to come with me weather you like it or \nnot...&quot; She whispered to herself. Her hand began to glow with an Energon \nbolt...if she hit Darkmouse at the base of her neck, she could send her right \ninto stasis quickly. And, she hoped, the Predacons were using Plasma guns, \nbecause she could absorb the plasma.\n    She shot out from behinde the a tree, her hand held out in front of her, \nand blasted a bolt at Darkmouse. Eyes wide and alert, she went tense, ready \nto engage in a fight.\n\n"}}
