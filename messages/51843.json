So\n&gt; far as I&#39;m concerned the Council is still all\n&gt; powerful, and any authority given to the nWo comes\n&gt; directly from the council, and can be taken away as\n&gt; well.  If it&#39;s for the council then I&#39;ll run, if not,\n&gt; shutup.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Eric Bischoff &lt;1641coburn@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Did you come here to see NBW?

So if I\n&gt; &gt; were you, I&#39;d be paying a lot more attention to the\n&gt; &gt; stuff that goes on in the RPG, if you want to vote. \n&gt; &gt; Also, make sure you start making friends, as there\n&gt; &gt; will be voting categories for RPers as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------\n&gt; &gt; The preceding announcement has been paid for by the \n&gt; &gt; New World Order\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; New DSL Internet Access from SBC & Yahoo!\n&gt; http://sbc.yahoo.com\n\n\n"}}
