He blinked and decided to leave them alone, his scanners telling him they were Predacon. He turned and trotted back, where he was going he had no idea. Rexon only knew that there was bot life on this planet. Maybe only a few, but there was some.\n\nHe wanted to find the life. The Fox-Wolf Hybrid thought he didn&#39;t know the meaning of lonely, till now. Back on Cybertron he had always been.. in company. Until the incident. He knew it was better just to forget.\n\nHis ears picked up the sound of deer, and he could smell it on the wind. He stopped, and lifted his nose up to the smell. It was coming from the North East. He gave a long howl and chased after the deer, leaping on its back and breaking it&#39;s neck. \n\nHe tore into the meat with a blood-thirstness he didn&#39;t know could exist. Maybe he could live alone. Helping bots whenever they crossed his path. Rexon was yet to decide.\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
