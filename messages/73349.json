We need to find out what&#39;s going on\n&gt; with the Predacons and find out what those Humans were up to.  I&#39;m wondering\n&gt; if these events are connected to each other.  Windlord, Perceptor, I entrust\n&gt; you with the task of gathering the intel we need about the Predacons and the\n&gt; Humans. Rodimus and I will begin our survey of the parameters and see what\n&gt; we come up with.  And by the way, Talon will be flying with me, of course.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His arm does not let go of Talon, as he embraces her gently.\n&gt;\n&gt; Straightshot nods and looks up to Leo Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If ya want, I can continue trying ta contact the others.
