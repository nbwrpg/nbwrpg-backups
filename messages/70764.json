He knew deep down that Perceptor was turning over a new \n&gt; leaf, even if the others didn&#39;t quite believe it was true.  As he regains \n&gt; a lot of his strength, he is now able to stand up on his feet by himself, \n&gt; without stumbling.  He turns his head in the direction of where Optimus \n&gt; Prime&#39;s body lay.  He knew a visit to his fallen leader would benefit his \n&gt; own piece of mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Excuse me everyone, I won&#39;t be long.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He begins walking slowly at first, but then regains his footing as he \n&gt; passes through doorways, and back into the room where Optimus Prime&#39;s body \n&gt; lay.  Just by his sonars he could pinpoint where he was and then kneels \n&gt; down in front of his lifeless body.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There are so many things I never got to ask you.  One of them being, how \n&gt; does one find the perfect balance between trust and loyalty?  And how does \n&gt; one find peace in an atmosphere full of tension?  But most of all Optimus, \n&gt; our paths appear to be the same, our values, our courage, our strength and \n&gt; our faith in those around us.  Are our origins alike?  If so, is there a \n&gt; direction I should be going toward? One that will help me to guide the \n&gt; Autobots and Maximals to finding the road toward peaceful existance?  If \n&gt; anyone would know these answers, you would.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He puts a tiny orb of his own spark into a container, and gives it as an \n&gt; offering to Optimus Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Could be or not necesary, i dont know&quot;replied Dryly PErceptor&quot;That \n&gt;&gt; &gt; depends\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of the scan and the strategy to follow, My best bet is do the same what \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; did some weeks ago... Insolate the programs and install the other ones \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; partially unleash her memories; and speaking about her memories... If \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kups\n&gt;&gt; &gt; observations are true then Her behavior could be a risk for herself and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; others; we couldnt afford sedate her again I dont know how much her \n&gt;&gt; &gt; health\n&gt;&gt; &gt; could stand it; If she Remembers you, you be able to calm her down \n&gt;&gt; &gt; enough to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; avoid any umpleasant situation cause she has strong emotional \n&gt;&gt; &gt; attachments\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with you and the other being that has stronger attachment is your \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Daughter\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and it&#39;s too young to put her in a risk... Speaking about risks, do you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; know\n&gt;&gt; &gt; if she still has my blaster? I gave her in one of the Maximals \n&gt;&gt; &gt; invations\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and she hadnt given it back&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus nodded, a worried but resolute look on his face as he walked\n&gt;&gt; over to where Nightlight was laying, the scanning beam Bump and Legacy\n&gt;&gt; were running was still moving slowly over her form. &quot;She has been\n&gt;&gt; through so much.&quot; He said quietly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A part of him wanted to rage at Perceptor since it was he that did\n&gt;&gt; much of this to her, yet he could not escape the stabs of guilt he\n&gt;&gt; felt at his own hand in it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Her personality subroutines appear to be largely intact.&quot; Legacy said\n&gt;&gt; as he watched the data from the scanning beam, &quot;However many of them\n&gt;&gt; are noncontiguous. They will need to be reorganized so that her\n&gt;&gt; cerebral cortex can access them.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bump nodded obviously in agreement, &quot;Yes, but that will take some\n&gt;&gt; time.&quot; He pointed to the screen, &quot;Some of these have degraded over\n&gt;&gt; time. They will need to be restored.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus reached out a hand to touch Nightlight, but stops just short,\n&gt;&gt; not sure if his touch would disrupt the scanning field that enveloped\n&gt;&gt; her. &quot;Can you help her?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bump nodded gravely, &quot;Yes I believe when can.&quot; He turned to look at\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor, &quot;If we can get some help reversing some of this damage.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy remained silent, unwilling to venture a guess, there were far\n&gt;&gt; too many variable for him to make an unqualified answer.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
