Determined to get this done before the hole had \nthe chance to fill with rain water and become a mucky mess.\nCarnage enjoyed the feeling of her muscles at work, reminding her of all the \nfeasts she had to perform before they got that way. She had earned many \nmetals in her time, some for honor, some for valor, or some in feats that \nshe would rather not remember. Ones which were given to her because she was \nthe only one in the squad to survive. Yes, she had many of those metals. But \nthat&#39;s what you get when you survive missions which had been classified as \nsuicide draws.\nBut her mind had always learned to leave the past in the past and to focus \non what she was doing, and that was making sure that their meal wasn&#39;t \nspoiled.\nCarnage&#39;s motions stopped slightly for a second when she heard Teltoli speak \nup, wondering just how nervouse the fuzor had to be to battle like she was. \nShe didn&#39;t mind it when Teltoli went on about things but when it was just \npure dribble it was wiser to keep her lips sealed.\nBut what came out of Teltoli&#39;s mouth this evening was rather a...mixture of \nboth sounds and actual words. Making it so that Carnage had to stop digging \nfor a few moments and see if she could make sense out of what the fuzor was \ntrying to say.\nSo, it turned out that, indeed, Teltoli was asking her to teach her the \nethics of battle. Thinking to herself that it was about time she asked, she \nwas getting tired of waiting.\nCarnage looked Teltoli over for a final second before going back to the hole \nshe was digging, digging a little harder but not giving her friend a final \nanswer just yet. Thinking that Teltoli was in for the training of her \nlife.** &quot; I hope you know what you&#39;re asking for?&quot; ** Her training would be \nhard and brutal, and she was garonteed to shed mech-fluid at one time or \nanother.\nCarnage knew that, if Teltoli decided to go ahead with this, that she would \nbe getting into the hard stuff pretty fast. Especially when pain was the \nfirst thing that she would have to learn how to controle. As well as her \nfeelings and emotions.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
