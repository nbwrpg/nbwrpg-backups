They don&#39;t\n&gt; really know you, so \n&gt; why would they make it personnal? The only thing\n&gt; anyone around here \n&gt; can complain about is the posts you send.\n&gt; Also, you should know that Rauq, Rudra and I are the\n&gt; three council \n&gt; members. We are here to enforce the rules and help\n&gt; people (even if \n&gt; some think otherwise). When there is a problem case,\n&gt; we get forced to \n&gt; moderate someone, and this means no posting for some\n&gt; time.\n&gt; Rauq did send you a link to yahoogroups, but please\n&gt; also check \n&gt; www.nbwrpg.com to check out the rules. If anything\n&gt; else, it&#39;ll help \n&gt; you to role-play even better.\n&gt; \n&gt; For everyone, please remember that this is a\n&gt; transformer rpg, not a \n&gt; religious forum. I believe in my own way, but I\n&gt; respect what others \n&gt; believe. The point is that not everyone would like\n&gt; to hear about it.\n&gt; And please, if you have to tell something to\n&gt; someone, do so by private \n&gt; email, even if it takes longer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
