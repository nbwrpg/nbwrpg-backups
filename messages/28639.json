The\nold bot hadn&#39;t slept in weeks and his studies of the DNA samples had gone\nuntouched since Megaton was born.\n\nLines formed around the old bots face distinguishing his worn exterior, his\neyes half closed almost weeped in fear for his one true connection. Veratis&#39;\nmotor skills had slowed to a near stop do to his lack of rejuvination. Still\nhe pushed himself on, there would be plenty of time to sleep when his goal\nwas done.\n\nHis young aid Foxfingers entered the lab quietly knowing that his boss was\non a low energy cycle and would get upset at any problems that arose. He\ntook his seat slowly, eagerly awaiting Veratis to decide thier next move. He\nthought about the previous attempts at communication and realized that\nMegaton had made the most progress of them all. The foxbot snapped to\nattension when his mentor finally spoke.\n\n&quot;Find me some compatible DNA from the files.&quot; Veratis instructed rubbing his\nchin in concentration. &quot;DNA that could be used to find something.&quot; He didn&#39;t\nuse her name but Foxfingers knew exactly what Veratis was searching for.\n\nLady Hawk had been instructed to maintain radio silence when she left. The\nfct that she didn&#39;t break it didn&#39;t surprise her father. The fact that she\nwas weeks overdue concerned Veratis though. Deep down inside he knew she\ncould handle herself but she&#39;d never been exposed to these situations before\nnow.\n\nThe computers beeped and crackled as the selected DNA was inserted into the\nscanner to create the next bot. The protoform slid into place, receiving the\nlink from the scanner. &quot;Insert the virus&quot; Veratis called out over the noise\nof the computer.\n\nThe young assistant did as he was told and was rewarded with success. He was\na little more carefull with his selection this time. The mistake with\nMegaton had taught him well. This time he used the DNA from two females. He\nwas proud of his choices, but Veratis was still wary. Foxfingers selected\nthe DNA from two of the best hunters he could think of.\n\nThe stasis pod opened and out stepped a shapely silver female, her features\nglimmering in the light of the lab. Foxfingers regretted knowing that soon\nthe virus would take hold and she would lose her robot form. &quot;Hello, welcome\nto life as we know it.&quot; The foxbot said to her, trying to watch her moves as\nmuch out of interest as caution.\n\n&quot;Where am I and where is my unit?&quot; the shining bot queried to her\nbenefactors.\n\n&quot;You are where you are needed most my associate. &quot;There was a glimmer of\nhope in the old bots eyes when he saw what Foxfingers had done. &quot;Your unit\nas you put it is in protoform and not ready yet.&quot; he was carefull to choose\nhis words so he didn&#39;t upset his new hope. &quot;I need your help my dear.&quot; he\ntried to be forward with the bot but didn&#39;t want to say to much. &quot;My\ndaughter is missing, she left to collect samples of the wildlife and didn&#39;t\nreturn.&quot;\n\nThe bot remained in a tall dominant stance, keeping eye contact with her\ncreator and his assistant. &quot;Give me the information on the wildlife she went\nafter and I&#39;ll find her.&quot; There was no doubt in the females voice about her\nsuccess. her alternate forms showed even greater odds against failure. Even\nif the wildlife Veratis had mentioned was translife the female was sure she\nwouldn&#39;t faulter.\n\nAfter The beautiful young female had gathered the information she\ntransformed into a small and muscular silver furred wolf. her shining coat\nreflecting the room around her. As quicly as she had scanned the information\nshe sprinted outside and transformed again. This time she formed a large\nsilver and black hawk. the ice and snow of the frigid norwegian landscape\npailed to the glory of the majestic hawk taking flight heading toward Lady\nHawks last known position. (Saudi Arabia) With one last call back to the\nbase she swore into her commlink. &quot;I will return your daughter to you, you\nhave the word of Silver Scout.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
