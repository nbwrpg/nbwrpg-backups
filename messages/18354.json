The only problem was that he had to manuver through all of the \ntrees. He was catching her though. Time to cut her off......\n\nStarscream launcheed a missled into a tree a few metres infront of \nher into a tree, causing it to catch on fire and fall down, blocking \nher path. He continued the chase.\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon was getting ready to attack the Ark, when he decided to check \nup on the three chips he had installed in three different bots. He \nwent to the computer and checked their status.\n\nThe first was Savage. Everything was fine. Prebon had complete \ncontroll over him.\n\nThe second was Koj. The chip was giving off no signs of anything.\n\n&quot;Damt it! He must have used those Ninja powers of his to defeat it. \nWell, it might be somewhere in the Maximal base, so it could still be \nof some use. Chip 30175A, self destruct!&quot;\n\nThe chip exploded wherever Koj has put it.\n\nThe thirs was Spears. He was waiting for this. He examined the \nreadings. Most of the time it had complete contro, but than there are \nsome blanks that could not be accounted for. The Maximal Chip. They \nhave both intergrated themselves into her vital systems. Removing \neither one would result in immediate termination. When he got her \nback he would find a way to fix that though. She must be going nuts, \nnot remembering stuff that well. Just than the message came in from \nSpears. Time to go.\n\n&quot;Trainers! We are leaving early and going to Spears&#39; positio. I&#39;ve \nlocked onto it. She wants to return to us. We must go rescue our lost \ncomrade! And perhaps we could pick up a dead body and place the spark \nof Lightrade in it! We must go!&quot;\n\nThe other Trainers left the base and hopped on Savage with their \ncloaks on, ready to go. Prebon waited, signaling for Slayer to come.\n\n\n"}}
