No wonder there was a war \ngoing on, \n&gt; with being like this one terrorizing the planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; But even as DeathScythe advenced on her she backed further into the \ncave, \n&gt; momenterraly tripping on a small rock but regaining her balence and \n&gt; continuing on into the shadows.\n&gt; Her mind kept wreeling. Why was he like this, even after she had \nsaved his \n&gt; life? Didn&#39;t that count for anything?!\n&gt; But she kept calm, other then backing up and hearing her spark \npound in her \n&gt; ears.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; It has kept me alive so far, has it not?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But she knew that talking to this bot was useless, just like it \nwas to \n&gt; think that he could have at least let her go as thanx for saving \nhis \n&gt; miserable life.\n&gt; However, as her form bacxked even further into the cave her foot \nslipped in \n&gt; a small puddle, DeathScythe shoting 2 charges at her at the same \ntime.\n&gt; So, she not only fell back, but flew a few feet further into the \ncave as \n&gt; well. Hitting the far wall hard and with a sickening crack.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zyber whimpered silently as she slowly rise from a sprawl to a sit, \nlooking \n&gt; down at her chest and shoulder to see mech-fluid leaking from them.\n&gt; But she slowly stood, her optics fixed on DeathScythe but also \ninching along \n&gt; the wall to get towards the passage which led deeper into the \ncaverns.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; It is not skills which make beings strong, it is their \nwillingness and \n&gt; pure of spark which gives them their strength.\n&gt; The weak are only those which chose to hide their purity until a \ncertain \n&gt; time in their life where they can release it and rise above the \nreast. As it \n&gt; always has been and still is.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
