I won&#39;t forget \nthat bots face... He lifted his arm as the techno poison continued to \nplay with his circuts. &quot;We&#39;re coming up to the ship...&quot; He limped up \nto a clearing... huh?&quot; He looked down at Crosswise. &quot;Out of three \nyour the only one not damaged and you take us to the wrong ship?&quot;\n\n\nBlackstorm:\n \nBlackstorm was tired to wait the new comers signal, so she took off \nand flew towards the ark. when she saw Side way. She landed some \nmiles far of him and she transformed to her beast mode. Cautionsly \nshe walked towards the group, hoping to know more about those bots. \n\nSideways:\n\nSideways limped up to the ship and shook his head. &quot;Well we might as \nwell turn around and try again.&quot; He stoof up right and transformed \nand the two smaller bots formed into a rider and the two started off.\n\nBlackstorm:\n\nBlackstorm saw that, she carefully follow them\n\nSideways smiled to himself. &quot;That dragon bot was a bombshell wasn&#39;t \nshe boys.&quot; The minicons whistled and he laughed and braked. &quot;Hmmm \nLooks like the terrains rough ahead, Rook you check out see if we can \nget by on wheels, me and crosswise will stay here.&quot; He transformed \nand became his bot form and crosswise formed his head...\nBlackStorm:\n \nBlackStorm stopped and hide, she was very daring following a lone \nthat bot... Perhaps she have to call her babysiter after all, plus \nshe have to come back to her patrol. She moved slowly trying to left \nthe area.\n\nSideWays looked around. &quot;What do you mean you heard something?&quot; He \nturned and a visor slid over his eyes. &quot;A bot!&quot; He raised his arms \nand the guns slid out. &quot;Freeze!&quot;\n\nBlackStorm:\n\nThe femme stopped and  waited. But she was full awared \n\nSideways reached her quickly. &quot;Name, faction, etc, be quick about it.&quot;\n\nBlackstorm:\n\n&quot;BlackStorm,  Decepticon, Scout&quot;replied the femme&quot;May I transform?&quot;\n\nSideways chuckled. &quot;Your either young or neive.&quot; A true decepticon \nwould have lied.&quot; He nodded. &quot;Heh, go ahead, but know this theres \nanother bot with me and he&#39;ll be back soon.&quot;\n\nBlackstorm:\n\nBlackstorm felt as fool, MAxima wouldn&#39;t like this and her chances to \nget good mission and receive honors from Hydras was vanishing. She \ntranformed to her bot mode. \n\nSideways smiled. &quot;Why your a child.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;And your a \ndecepticon., well then BlackStorm, I am Sideways, and i too am a \nDecepticon.&quot; He lowered his weapon.\n\nBlackStorm:\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not a child....&quot;replied the femme&quot;that means that we aren&#39;t \nenemies, are we&quot;\n\nSideWays chuckled. &quot;No, were allies.&quot; He lowered his guns and raised \nhis hand in greeting.\n\nBlackStorm:\n\n&quot;Some nanoclick you said that I&#39;m a child &quot;said BlackStorm&quot;I presume \nthat you said that &#39;cause you belive that I&#39;m inoccent; but I \ndon&#39;t&quot;her tone was neutral but almost friendly &quot; what do you want?&quot;\n\nSideways smiled. &quot;I apologise, i am here trying to find megatron, and \noptimus prime.&quot; Rook ran by BlackStorm and stood next to sideways \nlooking up at the femme\n\n&quot;Megaron, Megatron, where have I heard that name?&quot;thought the femm, \nshe said &quot;who&#39;s your little friend?&quot;\n\nSideways chuckled,  &quot;Thats Rook, he&#39;s a minicon, he can err, unlock \nnew powers that i can use.&quot;\n\nBlackStorm&quot;I see&quot;replied the femme\n\n\n\n"}}
