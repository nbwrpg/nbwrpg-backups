The Autobots have the\nbasic ethos of &quot;Peace is the right of all sentient beings&quot; while the\nDecepticons are about &quot;Peace through tyranny!&quot; or &quot;Might makes right!&quot;.\nHowever there are variations on each theme. \n\nIf you look at the Wiki site (which I encourage you to do) under the\nsubsection summary and setting which kind of gives you a break down. \n\n(I have grafted these from the site. please read them there in their\nentirety)\n\nYou have at least two versions of predacon : BUSHIDO PREDACONS who\nbelieve that preserving the peace will allow them to grow strong for\nthe little while they still have before the Minions start an all-out\nwar. their leader is Spire. And IRON SKULL PREDACONS who believe that\nMaximals are weak and they would rather take over the lead from the\nMaximals and act right now. Their leader is Jotunn.\n\nYou also have at least two versions of Maximal: PACIFICUS MAXIMALSwho\nbelieve that peace is the only way everybody can focus on the efforts\nagainst the Minions. Their leader is Perseus. While you also have the\nSILVER WINGS MAXIMALS who are convinced that the Predacons are\npreparing a revolution and that they want to prepare a strike against\nthem. They think they should take them all out before things get rough.\nTheir leader is Razorwing.\n\nThen there are THE WATCHERS who look to me to still be Maximals but \ntake in members from other factions like Predacons. This faction is\ndedicated to the monitoring of the Minions. They are crafty and swift,\nand they are renowned Minion-killers at times. Their skills also\ninclude diplomacy, however, as members of any factions can join the\nWatchers. Their leader is Elder. \n\nThen there are the Minions of Unicron, generally called either Minions\nor Unicronians. Their apparent goal is to turn the Earth into a ripe\nfeeding ground for Unicron. Unicron realizing that the energon present\non Earth was too powerful for him to absorb right away, left minions\nbehind to keep an eye on Earth until the crystals were ripe for his\ntaking. (Remember how the crystals originally interfered with Maximals\n& Predacons, and they couldn&#39;t stay in robot mode?) Up until recently a\nsort of Cold War was raging between the Unicronians and the\nCybertronians however with the arrival of Cyclonus, Scourge and the\nsweeps, and the addition of several new warriors this cold war\nthreatens to explode into something more. They are led by Vorpal, a\npowerful villain who&#39;s full abilities have yet to be revealed.\n\nI hope this helps, and I am sure the others will give corrections and\nexpansions as well. Also Please read what is on the Wiki site, and\nexplore the different links. There is ALOT of information there -\nPictures of some of the bases, who leads, facts about the characters,\nthe history and much more. \n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
