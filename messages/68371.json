His only reaction was to\nincrease his thrust, to push his massive bulk slightly higher in the\nair.\n\nHe was a sight to behold, hued in deep purple and black armor, his twin\nshoulder mounted mortar cannons and an arm mounted cannon mute\ntestimony to his offensive abilities. His armor was thick and well\ncrafted as he floated in mid air, boosters flaring from his back. His\nhead casing was reminiscent of a jungle cat&#39;s head opened in a\nperpetual roar, Myrmidon&#39;s optics peering from within the maw past long\ntoothed fangs.\n\n&quot;HOLD!&quot; Myrmidon&#39;s sonorous voice flowed over the area as he pointed a\nclawed finger at Malice. &quot;You bear Decepticon markings, and yet you\nattack us!&quot; With an audible click both of his mortar cannons target\nMalice and prepare to fire. &quot;Out of respect for your allegiance I give\nyou one final chance to yield, or the battle begins in earnest.&quot;\n\nOOC: If Hydras chooses to receive the transmissions from Myrmidon, he\nwould be seeing this as well. \n\nOOC: Oh, and as Myrmidon had only stepped out of the base and began\nhovering, shifting only so much as to allow others to emerge and to\navoid the lava, he is between Malice and the opening to the black\nfortress.\n\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n--- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt; \n&gt; As more opponents showed up, malice could only grin.  Since Trelos\n&gt; was turning fast enough to keep from being outflanked, He ignited his\n&gt; flight engines and flew up to avoid the missile.  He fired into the\n&gt; hardened lava under his enemies&#39; feet, then fired a flurry of\n&gt; grenades into the weakened ground.  He then transformed into the\n&gt; waverider craft, proudly showing his Decepticon insignias on his\n&gt; wings, then flew straight down.  He transformed at the last minute to\n&gt; land on his feet.  His momentum caused the weakened slab of rock to\n&gt; tilt up.  The fresh lava that flowed up to him was no concern, as he\n&gt; drew the thermal energy into his body, leaving his air frame safe.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Words are a sign of stupidity, you bunch of punk children.  You all\n&gt; talk a bit too much,&quot; Malice retorted, breaking free after his short\n&gt; break to fly low to the ground toward the base&#39;s entrance.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:  The three sent to take care of malice are far from any danger\n&gt; of getting hurt.  Its more to sting their pride.  he&#39;s just there to\n&gt; stir up trouble.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@...&gt;\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Monday, March 10, 2008 6:12:28 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Black Fortress/Mesagge to Lord Perseus\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Scorponok: :\n&gt;  \n&gt; Not more then a minute after Myrmidon had joined with Trelos in the\n&gt; battle against Malice Scorponok also exited the base.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Scorponok: It seems you shouldn&#39;t be alone, intruder!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Scorponok aims at the enemy and opens his life pencer claw/hand,\n&gt; releasing a G2 rocket.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Scorponok: Today you have the honor of fighting a Generation 2\n&gt; Decepticon Headmaster!\n&gt; \n&gt; Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@gmail. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Trelos quickly sidestepped the shot and as the Pred moved around to\n&gt; get as his flank he merely rotated as he ran, still facing the\n&gt; intruder he got in close and leapt at the bot trying grab his armor\n&gt; with his teeth and wrestle him to the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Just a few quick facts, if he&#39;is trying to flank Trelos, he has\n&gt; significantly more ground to cover than Trelos does to rotate to face\n&gt; him.  Trelos can do combat with bots in beast mode, his jaws have\n&gt; been known to rip off arms and legs (necks too);  his front paws can\n&gt; also slash armor.  He runs faster than many bots fly, and he&#39;s racked\n&gt; up quite a kill list already.  He broke out of the Pasificus Maximal\n&gt; base without any assistance, while all the Maximals were in the base,\n&gt; he&#39;s bested Hydras in combat.  Don&#39;t take him lightly. :P\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Mar 10, 2008 at 11:35 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@\n&gt; yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; As the Predacon base rose to the surface Myrmidon was close behind\n&gt; Trelos. He took a moment to look around as he carefully stepped onto\n&gt; the the cooling surface, steam rising from the contact. With the\n&gt; slightest application of power, bosters flared and he rose above the\n&gt; muck. \n&gt; \n&gt; He watched as Trelos ran at the new robot and watched the result, a\n&gt; slight smile flitting across his face. With a flick of thought he\n&gt; began\n&gt; transmitting what he saw to the command center, as he began to\n&gt; approach\n&gt; Malice.

After the fortress\n&gt; settled\n&gt; &gt; and a sentry exited to search- for himself he assumed, he decided\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; get the creature&#39;s attention. He leveled his rifle and fired a\n&gt; &gt; careful shot in the beast&#39;s path only fet in front of him, then a\n&gt; &gt; follow up shot behind it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s far enough, Predacon.
