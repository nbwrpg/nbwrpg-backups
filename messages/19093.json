A ting if guilt in her spark.\nShe faught her beast modes to attach him again, wanting to rip him apart. \nBut this time she resisted, using as much will power as she could handle.\n\nAs she heard Prowl ask a question she understood she began to shift her \nweight uneasily, her systems far to ferel to communicate to him, but \nsystematic and logical enough to know what he was talking about.\n\nOf course she wasn&#39;t all right! And she wanted to scream that at him, but \nshe didn&#39;t know how to form the sounds into the peoper words.\nHer systems were overloading from too much power, her adrnalin was through \nthe roof, she was trapped in this mode and didn&#39;t know how to get out.\nShe wanted...no...NEEDED help, but she didn&#39;t know how to ask for it.\n\nAs the mode shifted she began to look towards Prowl nervously, almost like a \ndog that knew it did something bad and was now facing its owner.\nBut she began to slightly mew as well, pathetic little sounds that \ncommunicated her uneasyness.\n\nShe wanted help, and this was the best way she knew how to ask for it.\nBut at any moment she could become vilent again, and she wanted help to keep \nthose mood swings under control. But also to keep her beast modes under \ncontrole as well.\n\nThe mode soon began to pace the room, almost seeming to want a way out like \nshe wanted a way out of this terror which was true.\nBut the pacing was also doing something else as well, it was keeping her \nbeast modes under control...for now.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
