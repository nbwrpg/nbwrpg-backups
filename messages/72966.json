Foward towards the flickering light&lt;br&gt;\nthat lay =\r\nahead and what ever lay beyond it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Tucson steps aside to allow the escaping parties a clear passage to saf=\r\nety .&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  He remains firm in his stance.  Evil was coming toward him =\r\nand this time he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; was dead set on facing it head on himself.  It wa=\r\ns what the old dragon would&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have done to protect those under his p=\r\nowerful wings, and so the need to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; protect his comrades and the pre=\r\ndicons who had agreed to put their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; differences aside to join his f=\r\naction against a greater evil than&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; themselves, had grown stronger =\r\nto the point where he felt it was all or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nothing to save everyone&#39;=\r\ns lives.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; EVERYONE, GET OUT OF HERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN! =\r\n I&#39;LL TAKE CARE&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; OF THIS FROM HERE ON! &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He narro=\r\nws his eyes in stern vigil.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Your lives are too valuable=\r\n to lose, and I for one will not stand for such&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a loss.  It&#39;s time=\r\n, time to reclaim what has been unlawfully stolen!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; His e=\r\nyes glow a bright blue, lining the cave slightly with a hint of blue&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; light.  Intern what little light is cast from his eyes bounces off of hi=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; silver armor shimmering like small flashes of lightning that pee=\r\nr through&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; thick storm clouds .  Intern he gives a warning roar as =\r\nloud as a clap of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; thunder, hoping that he&#39;s heard and perceived as=\r\n a suggestion of surrender.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There would be no more bowing=\r\n down to Magmatron, or his minions.  No more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; kidnapping or corrupt=\r\ning anyone against their will.  And if they still defy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; him, which =\r\nhe senses they will, the Silver Dragon was ready to remind them&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; th=\r\nat in order to get to the innocent, they would have to get past him first.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;  Even if this would cost him his own spark, Tucson was ready to em=\r\nbrace his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; inner spirit.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; The time for introspetion and meta-awareness and contemplation had ended =\r\nnow&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as the tunnel collapse raced after the PREDAONS and MAXIMALS i=\r\nn full force&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as they tried to trample and run over one naother!&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The PREDACONS, at least some of them, seemed to not care WH=\r\nERE Tehy were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; going, or that they were being HERDED, moreso that t=\r\nhey just avoided going&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; down over like WASPINATOR!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Which way do you &#39;pect us to be goin?&quot; QUICKSTRIKE, one of t=\r\nhe&lt;br&gt;\nPREDACON FUZORS said. &quot;There&#39;s only one way to go, and it&#39;s that a&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nway.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCRYOTEK held up a silencing finger, his quick glance hope=\r\nfully&lt;br&gt;\nquieting the other PREDACONS down.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTurning back to TUSCO=\r\nN as he finished speaking CRYOTEK nodded. &quot;Of&lt;br&gt;\ncourse Mighty Maximal.&quot; H=\r\ne said in a deeply respectful voice. &quot;I will&lt;br&gt;\nlet you stand and face the=\r\nm in any way you wish.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWith a small gesture he silently commanded=\r\n the PREDACONS to comply,&lt;br&gt;\nafter all, why should they waste their fire p=\r\nower and energon and risk&lt;br&gt;\ntheir sparks when TUSCON was so clearly so re=\r\nady to waste his?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;No!&quot; LEO PRIME said as he came to stand next to=\r\n TUSCON, along with&lt;br&gt;\nSANTON, WINGCALIBER as well as TORCA and his FUZORS=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME gestured dismissively to CRYOTEK and then turned back =\r\nto&lt;br&gt;\nTUSCON, &quot;We will not let you stand alone. We stand or we fall, but w=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\ngo foward together.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThen there is a voice, one deep and pow=\r\nerful echoed through the cave,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Ahh, it is good to see that you have fo=\r\nund your backbones after all&lt;br&gt;\nMaximals!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;That is Saberback!&quot; S=\r\nKYSHADOW said. The other PREDACON FUZORS nodded.&lt;br&gt;\nThey had been there wh=\r\nen HYDRAS had challeneged him.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe voice chuckled, &quot;You remembered=\r\n me? I feel honored. I remeber you&lt;br&gt;\ncowering before my power once before=\r\n, and you shall do so again. Come&lt;br&gt;\nfoward and come to your doom!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nThe laughter echoes down the through the cave, although there is no&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nsign of SABERBACK himself. Only the flickering light comming from the&lt;br&gt;\ne=\r\nnd of the tunnel.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThen there was a scream, one that nearly anyone =\r\nand everyone could&lt;br&gt;\nrecognize, a voice giving vent to rage and pure agon=\r\ny!!!!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt was OPTIMUS PRIME!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockqu=\r\note&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-C7B68108-D1EC-432B-A107-A23D89C1D47D--\r\n\n"}}
