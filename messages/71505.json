The look on his face tells of a priceless feeling o=\r\nf perpetual joy that could only be felt when in the company of those you lo=\r\nve.  He had found happiness the moment he met her, which to him was far mor=\r\ne valuable than the most powerful weapon in the universe.  What better way =\r\nto express one&#39;s love and the joy it brings by giving something back that i=\r\ns as precious as love itself.  He was ready to take the next step.  As Rodi=\r\nmus graced Nightlight by fathering a child, so promised Tucson as he gently=\r\n holds her hand.\n\n&quot; Talon, I have yet to give you something.  A gift truly =\r\nwhich comes from my spark.  A family is formed when the love of two sparks =\r\ncome together as one.  And as you have given me so much of your heart, I wo=\r\nuld like to give you so much more of mine.  That of course, is if you want =\r\nme to.
