The spiderbot hesitated &quot;We \nwouldn&#39;t want that now would we?&quot; he turned and exited the quarters \nwondering how he could get a message to the Cybertronian Fire that he \nmay be late. He couldn&#39;t risk the consequences of breaking thier \nagreement.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::KitKat:;\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at Phobia. &quot;Oh please don&#39;t call me leader.

I&#39;m not \nlooking \n&gt; for a council seat, just looking out for my team.&quot;  She looked at \n&gt; Drillbit,&quot;Tell Time Bomb, Land Mine and the others to join me in my \n&gt; quarters.  Terrorsaur too.  But not Megatron.  I want this to be a \n&gt; suprize for him.  When we have devised a perfect plan, then \nmegatron \n&gt; will learn of this, but not before.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She smiled and nodded to Phobia. &quot;Yes, I shall be by your ship in a \n&gt; day or two.
