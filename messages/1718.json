He looks around and pulls out his \nrifle. Like the thundergod that his namesake was, he fires a bolt at \nMosquitor, who had just flown into the battlefield. Mosquitor crashes into a \ntree and shoots acid back at Zeus.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAnnihilator and Killer emerge from the ship. They look around.\n\n&quot;Sub commander, eh?&quot; Killer yells at Rampage, &quot;Sub-commander THIS!&quot; He adds \nas he fires at Rampage from his launcher.\n\nAnnihilator opens fire at Inferno.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus falls forward as the predacons&#39; shots hit him, slamming him through \nthe boulder in front of him. He stands up, severely damaged, and turns to \nface Manterror and Injector. &quot;We are allied. Instead of firing at me, you \ncould be firing at them!&quot; He says, pointing to the ship.\n\nWhile pointing to the ship, he sees the new defenders emerge out of it, \nfiring at the attackers. He growls. It was time to leave.\n\n&quot;Beast Mode!&quot; He says and transforms, snatching Nemesis in his talons.\n\n&quot;All allience members, return to base.&quot; He says into his comm-link as he \nflies off with Nemesis in his talons.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDeathStorm flies back toward the alliance base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl smiles at Iron Raptor. &quot;No problem.&quot;\n\nHe frowns as he hears gunshots, explosions, and screams coming from the \ndirection of the ship. &quot;Sounds like a battle. Let&#39;s be careful.&quot; He says as \nhe sneaks into the forest.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker takes the liquid from Zyber and drinks it, making a face at the \ntaste. He looks at her and then shifts his gaze to Rowdy Wolf.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s a predacon,&quot; He says in the form of an accusation.\n\n"}}
