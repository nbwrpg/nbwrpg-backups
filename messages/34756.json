This wasnt eh Iron Raptor he had seen over\nthe\n&gt; video screen, and he knew the Matrix was at work. How many times\nmust it\n&gt; meddle in their affairs, he then had a look of shock on his face as\nthe\n&gt; lightning closed around him, and shrunk into him. He quickly fired a\n&gt; blast of his raw fusion energy downwards, and the crossfire hit,\n&gt; emmiting a large light of energy as the two forces met. Then it\ncleared,\n&gt; and Megatron was left floating there, covering his face, smoke\nlifting\n&gt; off of his body. \n&gt; \n&gt; As his arms moved away to reveal his face, it had a grimace on it of\n&gt; pure anger. He landed on the ground a few meters away from this new\n&gt; Prime. He pointed accusingly, &quot;YOU, you are pathetic for challenging\nme.\n&gt; Megatron DOES NOT YIELD TO KNOW ONE&quot; he screamed, his rage apparent.\n&gt; &quot;HOW DARE YOU. I AM OLDER THAN YOUR CREATOR, I AM MEGATRON. Do you\nhave\n&gt; any idea how many holders of the matrix I have crushed in my 20\nmillion\n&gt; year life time? DO YOU&quot; he screamed, furious at the audacity of this\n&gt; rookie Prime. &quot;HOW DARE YOU&quot;\n\n\n"}}
