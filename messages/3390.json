She was going about this in the wrong way, he wasn&#39;t there to fight or spar or even jusr glare at her for the fun of it. He was there to get the answers to his questions and try to calm a menace that could be dangerouse to all other bots.\nHe looked at her more in a puzzled way which almost would make him seen not all that dangerouse to a bot who had never met him before and did not know his attitude, but his expression changed into that of thoughtfulness when he had heard her plea for his information on Megatrons position.\nHe then tilted his head to the side in a puzzled way again but a snarl on his lips, she had to answer his questions first before he have her the info she requested and required.*\n\n&quot; As I have spoken before, the answer to your question, I have...however, you must answer a question of my own. Who are you and why did you impersonate me?&quot;\n\n* He then looked down at the floor in a way that made his brow ridge hide his optics, but in truth he was looking straight at Cyber Claw. The snarl still on his lips.*\n\n&quot; Once my question has been answered the answer to your will be freely given.&quot;\n\n* With that he waited patiently again for Cyber Claw to answer his given question...if she wanted the answer to hers.* \n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
