He tries to remain unseen\n&gt; yet only visible to Big Convoy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;re definitely not alone.  We should fall back for a moment.&quot;\n\nThe tunnel was continuing to slope downward the hum was steadily\ngetting more prounced. It was more of a low level vibration rather\nthan a true sound. Perhaps it was a machine of some sort, perhaps it\nwas something else.\n\nTUSCON had just turned another corner, using the rocks and stones as\ncover to keep himself out of sight when . . .\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; And underground, VICE GRIP had the pillbug DRILL BIT digging\n&gt; through, going to breka through first to be the decoy while he\n&gt; would be the muscle just up behind!\n\nDRILL BIT&#39;s sensors were a bit off now as well. While he was somewhat\nshielding by being underground and his hearing was good enough to\ndetect the footsteps of TUSCON as he passed by, still the ever growing\nsensor distortion field was throwing off even his keen senses just a\nbit.\n\nFor TUSCON he saw a CYBERTRONIAN of unknown faction rise from the\nground, bursting from the very dirt and stone! (OOC: DRILL BIT)\n\nHowever unfortunately as IFF signatures were down there was no\nimmediate way for TUSCON to determine who he was or his factional\norigin.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
