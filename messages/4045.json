But, I dont think \nwe&#39;ll be needing it, she seems to be obedient.\n\n::: He turns to see Quickstrike and Darkmouse talking. Quickstrike didnt seem \nthrilled. :::\n\n~~~~~~~`\n\n::: Marine slowly crawled in his beast mode to talk to Gremlin. He had \nexpected an attack by now, even by Megatron, but nothing had happened. :::\n\n::: Marine ::: Marine, Terrorize!\n\n::: He transformed and stood a large seven feet over Gremlin, who stood a \nmedium six. :::\n\n::: Marine ::: Now, what do you have to report?\n\n::: Gremlin ::: The shileds are still up and un touched, we have all out \nriffles and pistols charged and ready, and the cannon is still functonal.\n\n::: Marine looked at the cannon. It was a large device where the gunner would \nsit in a small pod and fire the meter long cannon from safety. It was similar \nto an Auto-gun, only used manually. :::\n\n::: Marine ::: Good. Hows radar?\n\n::: Gremlin ::: All is clear.\n\n::: Marine nodded and walked up to Pheniox and Transanulas. They had \ncompleted the mid section of the tower. The spider was on a scoffold welding \nsomething, while the firebird was beneath him connecting wires. They seemed \nto be getting along at the moment. Marine then went back to a small \ntransportable computer. He sat at it and contacted Hell Beast. :::\n\n::: Marine ::: Commander Hell Beast, phase two is in ful swing. The tower \nwill be completed on schedual.\n\n::: Hell Beast&#39;s face formed from a swirl of static ::: Excellent General. I \nknew I could count on you. But be wiry, I do antcipate an attack.\n\n::: Marine nodded ::: I concour. Its only a matter of time.\n\n::: Hell Beast nodded and the static filled the screen. Marine turned off the \ncounsol and looked towrds the entrace. He saw a Proto-human sniffing the air \naround the shield, and Gremlin was antagonizing him. :::\n\n::: Gremlin ::: AH, a protohuman! Where is the rest of your disgusting little \ntribe?\n\n::: Marine came over and stopped the fight. ::: Enough, Gremlin go and run a \ndiagnostic on the cannon, Ill deal with this...thing.\n\n::: Gremlin left the two alone. The human snarled at Marine, and Marine \ndismissed it. He watched as it ran away, and out of the cave. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n::: Set, Ominous, and Ra waited in the bridge. They needed a new plan of \nattack....and for some reason there radio signals were getting weaker.....:::\n\n"}}
