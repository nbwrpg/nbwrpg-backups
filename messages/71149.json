Now, let&#39;s see what we&#39;ll need. Tucson \nto Ramulus, over.  I need to know exactly what types of tools you&#39;ll be \nneeding to repair our medics.  I&#39;m in my work lab now, assembling everything \nyou&#39;ll need.  Also, if there are any materials you need I&#39;ll see about them \nas well.

But Talon should\n&gt; go now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride nodds and quickly wisks Talon to the CR chambers.  Tucson \n&gt; turns\n&gt; toward Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Both medics down..  And an Ark in need of repair..  Hmm, I did a good\n&gt; portion of that damage with my sonar system..  First and foremost, are our\n&gt; comrades.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He walks slowly to a door, which leads into the one room he never thought\n&gt; he&#39;d enter.  His own private workshop.  Before becomming a Prime, he had\n&gt; taken great pleasure in restorring old weapons and those in desperate need\n&gt; of repair.  And in some cases, he would also help to repair damages to \n&gt; other\n&gt; comrades.  He opens the door with a code.  Straight Shot peeks in.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Wow, it&#39;s just as you left it Tucson.  Everything is still there.  Your\n&gt; entire workshop, tools, materials, all neatly categorized according to \n&gt; form\n&gt; and function.  A little dusty in here but still workable space.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; True, but things must be kept clean.  And to properly conduct repairs on\n&gt; comrades, I&#39;d rather be where they can be monitored safely.  I need some\n&gt; tools, and materials. I can get them here, and bring them to the medical\n&gt; bay.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Inform Ramulus to prepare the med bay for me.  It&#39;s about time I \n&gt; actually\n&gt; put to work some of the skills I&#39;ve aquired from Ratchet and Wheeljack.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to Tucson.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You really should have an assistant.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes.  Legacy, if you could, I&#39;d like you to assist me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson flashes his headlights dimly in reply.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Of course. But if you could, please, allow us to rest together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing\n&gt; &gt; that she is with me, safe from harm, only then can I rest as well.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It was rather obvious that his love for Talon grew ever stronger. He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; not able to show her that due to being under such duress, but now, there\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; time to express his feelings for her. He was a bot true to his word. His\n&gt; &gt; love was real, and it would remain as such.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Straight Shot knew him well. She knew what he meant and that made her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very\n&gt; &gt; happy. Her big brother had finally found someone to be with and she only\n&gt; &gt; hoped that it would lead to something more special in the future.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Aw, now how can ya refuse a request like that huh Perceptor? I think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; know what this means.. And I hope one day, somewhere along the line, \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;re both as happy as Rodimus and Nightlight, with a family of their\n&gt; &gt; own.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus nodded as the others talked, taking his time to look around the\n&gt; &gt; room, trying to be absolutely sure that nothing critical is damaged.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside, Hydras and his team were little more than a dot in the skies as\n&gt; &gt; they moved away carrying their own injured with them. All around the Ark\n&gt; &gt; defensive shielding began to flicker into place on the heels of the\n&gt; &gt; Predacons and Decepticons vacating the area, weapons and guns began to\n&gt; &gt; twist\n&gt; &gt; and turn as they initialized and calibrated themselves â€&quot; another \n&gt; &gt; Predacon\n&gt; &gt; attack would not be so easy. In fact this one would not have been if it\n&gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; not for Nightrazor sabotaging many of the Ark&#39;s systems and then the \n&gt; &gt; sonic\n&gt; &gt; wave that Tuscon had sent out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even as the main systems were coming up, it would be some time before\n&gt; &gt; every\n&gt; &gt; systems was running again as they should.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy near the gigantic forms of Megatron and Optimus, even in death it\n&gt; &gt; seemed that these two were locked in some sort of titanic struggle. He\n&gt; &gt; looked around, his single optic taking in the entire vista and then he\n&gt; &gt; turned back to Tuscon and Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;For the moment the time stream would appear undamaged.&quot; Legacy\n&gt; &gt; pronounced.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;However it is difficult to know the full ramifications of even these\n&gt; &gt; small\n&gt; &gt; changes that have occurred, and if we have not inadvertently changed\n&gt; &gt; something that was.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus looked at Legacy, &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Rodimus came to stand beside\n&gt; &gt; Legacy, who had himself moved towards Tuscon. &quot;We need to find a way to\n&gt; &gt; secure this Ark. If it is damaged too much, or too many changes are \n&gt; &gt; made,\n&gt; &gt; then all this that we are fighting for would be for nothing.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A call came in from Ramulus, &quot;Rodimus, Tuscon, our medics are both down.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; holding them together with a med kit, but I am going to need some help\n&gt; &gt; down\n&gt; &gt; here.&quot; Ramulus&#39; voice was calm, and yet there was still an edge of\n&gt; &gt; something\n&gt; &gt; in his voice: Concern? Fear? Anger?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From outside Leo II followed by Wing Caliber and the Fuzors. With the\n&gt; &gt; battle\n&gt; &gt; over, they definitely looked tired. Two battles in the space of a day\n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; definitely tax anyone&#39;s reserves.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
