From what he \npeiced together, this was a colonization post. It was put here to observe the \nplanets evolution, and then with the data they would begin to relocate on to \nthe planet. As he read further he found out that when the original Beast Wars \ntook place, the Aliens began to observe the bots as a threat. They hadnt \nencountered any intelligent life before and this scared them. They knew the \nMaximals were trying to stop Megatron from destroying the Autobots, but felt \nboth races needed to be exterminated.\n    The Aliens constructed a ship called the Armada. It was an automated \nwarship that would activate when the Observation Bunker was destroyed. The \nArmada is a large vessle, loaded with warheads to eradicate all intelligent \nlife. When the bunker was destroyed, it began its mission to destroy the \ntransformers.\n    The Bunker was destroyed when the Carbon Dioxide filter shut down and \nallowed Oxygen to flood into the bunker, which the aliens could not breath. \nFrom what the arachnid determined, they had been dead for a week, leaveing \nthem with a few days to stop the vessle.\n    &quot;Aracnia! We have troble! These Aliens, it seems, figured out that we \nwould get to them sooner or later. A warship is headed this way, programmed \nto eradicate any intelligent life. Our metal bodys and sparks will be dead \ngive aways.&quot; Tarantulas said to Aracnia.\n    She turned to him. &quot;Damn it! When will it arrive?&quot; She yelled.\n    &quot;Four days, and then according to the data, it will begin an automated \nassult via warheads.&quot;\n    She paused for a moment. She knew only oner person who could aid them in \na situation like this. &quot;Alright, get Megatron on the Comm, we need to talk. \nNow!&quot;\n\n"}}
