He gets up, ignoring his internal \ncomputer, which was saying, &quot;Warning. Logic center ... offline. Severe system \ndamage.&quot;\n\nThe predacon laughs like a maniak, looking at the giant beast that was Iron \nRaptor and the maximal floating above her, who was Striker.\n\n&quot;Ha!&quot; The now-crazy predacon yells, &quot;YOU CAN&#39;T KILL ME!!! I AM INVINCIBLE!&quot; \nWith that he takes out a pistol, aiming it quickly at the maximals in front \nof him. The arm thats holding the pistol snaps off due to the bite Iron \nRaptor, which had severely damaged it.\n\nHe looks in surprise at the stump of his arm, then looks back up at the \nmaximals. &quot;No matter!&quot; he yells, &quot;I will destroy you all!&quot;\n\nWith his functional arm, Zenyak takes out another grenade, laughing madly and \nthrowing it at the maximals. At that point his self-destruct countdown \nreaches zero and he starts igniting.\n\nA blue and red blur flies in from the direction of the Ark, grabbing the \ngrenade in midair and throwing it into a clump of trees to harmlessly burn \ndown a sizable portion of the forest, possibly taking quite a few animals \nwith it.\n\nStriker looks in disgust as Zenyak detonates, screaming like an idiot. Pieces \nof the once-sane predacon fall everywhere.\n\nProwl lands near Striker and Iron Raptor, grinning. &quot;I thought you guys might \nneed some help,&quot; he says, raising his voice slightly so he could be heard \nabove the two explosions.\n\nProwl then turns serious as he sees Iron Raptor&#39;s torn up side, &quot;Are you all \nright?&quot;\n\n"}}
