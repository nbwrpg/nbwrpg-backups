At close\n&gt; range, attempting to use his ELECTRICAL OVERLOAD upon Hydras as he was\n&gt; blasted!\n\n\nCRYOTEK watched the battle, his crimsom optics watching as if\nabsorbing every detail of the battle. He folded his arms over his\nchest, his wings flexing behind his back. He was a master tactician\nand chess player learning from others. The question was, was he\nlearning so as to aid an ally or to deal with an eventual opponant.\n\nThere was a look of loss on INFERNO&#39;s face as he watched. It was\nobvious that he wanted to come to HYDRAS&#39; aid, to take any hits into\nhimself than allow for HYDRAS to come to any harm. But his obedience\nto HYDRAS was far stronger and he stood  still, his body tense and\nready. Should HYDRAS call on him he would fly instantly into action!\n\nBRUTICUS X was in a similar. His body was tense and ready, the small\nbat-like wings on his back flexed spasmodically as he looked on, the\nflail in his hand seeming to move of its own accord, sparks of energy\npopping off its ends.\n\nThere was a chuckled from TARANTULUS as he watched a cruel smile on\nhis face, but he otherwise said nothing.\n\nIGUANUS and WASPINATOR seemed to be the most comfortable with this\nturn of events.\n\nIGUANUS just crossed his arms over his chest as he watched, a content\nsmile spreading across his face. He gave the impression that for him\nthis was both sport and entertainment.\n\nWASPINATOR just watched as well his smile was a happy one. He looked\nat CRYOTEK &quot;Waspinator just glad he not the one taking the blow this\ntime.&quot; he said quietly.\n\nCRYOTEK ignored him as he watched.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
