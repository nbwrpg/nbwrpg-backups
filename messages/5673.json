I&#39;ll try to be more consistent in the \nfuture.)\n\nDeep within the cargohold of the Cybertronian Fire, Hysteria stirred. She \npainfully pushed several boxes off of her small, hyena body and staggered to \nher feet. She raised her plasma rifle and performed a rough scan of the area \nwith what was left of her internal computer:\n\nInternal Comp: No P*static*acons in the immediate a*static*ea.\n\nHysteria lowered her rifle and activated her wrist com:\n\n&quot;Commander Kluster,  I&#39;m on my way to the bridge. Is everyone alright?&quot;\n\nHysteria left her com open as she holstered her rifle and did a quick scan \nof her systems. A flickering status screen sppeared before her dark blue \noptics:\n\nInternal Comp: Damage to inte*static*nal computer critical. All other \nsystems are function*static*ng within safety parameters.\n\nHysteria sighed as she exited the cargo hold and worked her way through the \nsurrounding debri towards the bridge.\n\n*****\n\nStats:\n\nName: Hysteria\n\nGender: Female\n\nBeastmode: Black Hyena w/silver speckles\n\nFaction: Maximal\n\nStatus: Tech &#39;bot\n\nWeapons: Plasma rifle, a small energon dagger, and shoulder/wrist \ncannons(&lt;--- like the original Optimus)\n\nDescription: What Hysteria lacks in size she makes up for in weaponry. She&#39;s \na good &#39;bot with a quick mind, but a little lacking when it comes to battle. \nShe&#39;d prefer to blast you from above then engage in hand to hand combat.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
