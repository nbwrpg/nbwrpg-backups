I have been asked by state\n&gt; &gt;and local authorities to write this email in order\n&gt; &gt;to get the word out to car drivers of a  very\n&gt; &gt;dangerous prank that is occurring in numerous states.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Some person or persons have been affixing hypodermic\n&gt; &gt;needles to the underside of gas pump handles.\n&gt; &gt;These needles appear to be infected with HIV positive\n&gt; &gt;blood. In the Jacksonville area alone there have been\n&gt; &gt;17 cases of people being stuck by these needles over\n&gt; &gt;the past five months.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;We have verified reports of at least 12 others in\n&gt; &gt;various around the country. It is believed that these\n&gt; &gt;may be copycat incidents due to someone reading about\n&gt; &gt;the crimes or seeing them reported on the television.\n&gt; &gt;At this point no one has been arrested and catching\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt;perpetrator(s) has become our top priority.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Shockingly, of the 17 people who where stuck, eight\n&gt; &gt;have tested HIV positive and because of the nature of\n&gt; &gt;the disease, the others could test positive in a\n&gt; &gt;couple years.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Evidently the consumers go to fill their\n&gt; &gt;car  with gas, and when picking up the pump handle get\n&gt; &gt;stuck with the infected  needle. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO\n&gt; &gt;CAREFULLY CHECK THE HANDLE of  the gas pump each time\n&gt; &gt;you use one. LOOK AT EVERY SURFACE YOUR HAND MAY\n&gt; &gt;TOUCH, INCLUDING UNDER THE HANDLE.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If you do find a needle affixed to one, immediately\n&gt; &gt;contact your local police department so they can\n&gt; &gt;collect the evidence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;PLEASE HELP US BY MAINTAINING A VIGILANCE AND BY\n&gt; &gt;FORWARDING THIS EMAIL TO ANYONE YOU KNOW WHO DRIVES.\n&gt; &gt;THE MORE PEOPLE WHO KNOW OF THIS THE BETTER PROTECTED\n&gt; &gt;WE CAN ALL BE. ***********\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Tobia E.
