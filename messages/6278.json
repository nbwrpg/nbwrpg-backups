About time you \nguys got back.  Quickstrike has been wanting to talk to you since you \nleft with Megatron.&quot;\n\nDarkMouse::\n&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Looks at KitKat. &quot;Take your feet off my console.  \nThat&#39;s highly specialized equipment.&quot;\n\nKitKat:: \nPuts her feet down off the console. &quot;Ok, OK, OK. I&#39;ll watch it from \nnow on. But go and see Quickstrike.  Oh, wait.  Better let him and \nStringtra finish first.&quot;\n\nDarkMouse::\n&quot;OK.
