Taking several of them could cause lots of\n&gt; problems for the Trainers.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Allright,&quot; he agrees after a moment of hesitation, &quot;Let me go review\n&gt; whatever recent comms the base has picked up from that area first,\n&gt; though.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns and walks to a console, tapping a few buttons to bring up\n&gt; any intercepted comms.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ignatius looked Slayer square in the eye, &quot;There seems to be some\n&gt; bad mech\n&gt; &gt; fluid between you and the Maximals, it shouldn&#39;t be to hard to get\n&gt; thier\n&gt; &gt; attention.&quot; Ignatius activates his Recon map of the mountains\n&gt; shoeing a\n&gt; &gt; particular dropoff near a sharp turn. &quot;I can position myself here.&quot;\n&gt; points\n&gt; &gt; to top of the dropoff. &quot;You lead one or two Maxi pads through\n&gt; here.&quot;  points\n&gt; &gt; to lower portion of dropoff leading around corner. &quot;Our prey will\n&gt; be trapped\n&gt; &gt; between us while we retain all the cover.&quot; The plan seemed simple\n&gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; with one exception, there was no way of knowing which Maximal would\n&gt; follow\n&gt; &gt; them, or how many. If successful they could scavenge the parts from\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; bots, or trade bodies for parts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ignatius brought up the menu from the cargo hold. &quot;We can use these\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; confuse the scanners.&quot; He points out an item labled Mirror sensors.\n&gt; Items\n&gt; &gt; designed to reflect a bots image and energy signature making it\n&gt; difficult to\n&gt; &gt; determine how many bots there were.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
