It was a \nsmall insect \n&gt; crawling around the table. He squashed it. Getting up becasue he \nwas \n&gt; disgusted to eat his food he walked over to the trash and threw it \nin. He \n&gt; noticed two more in the trash. (They are insects after all) He went \ninto the \n&gt; kitchen to grab a drink and noticed somemore by a vent. He went to \na computer \n&gt; monitor.\n&gt;     &quot;Computer give me a schimatic of the ktichen,&quot; One popped up \nbefore him \n&gt; on the screen. He pointed on the screen. &quot;Where does that vent lead \nto?&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;To many options to choose from, please specify.&quot; The computet \nreplied. \n&gt;     &quot;Just show me all of where it leads to,&quot; The computer did as it \nwas told. \n&gt; The vent ran pratically through all of the ship, and to the \noutside. He \n&gt; picked up a bug and asked the computer to show where all organic \nlife forms \n&gt; were in the ship. It showed that there were none in the kitchen, \nincluding \n&gt; other places. The strange part was that he had one in his hand, and \ncould see \n&gt; a few more by a vent. But there were few organic creatures in the \nbase at \n&gt; all. Only by the main door.\n&gt;     &quot;Battera, I will be right back, I&#39;m going to find Magmatron.&quot; \nCyberShark \n&gt; said and rushed out the door. He made his way to the Control room, \nbut \n&gt; Magmatron was not there.\n&gt;     He asked the computer where Magmatron is. It showed him. He ran \ntoward \n&gt; Magmatron.\n&gt;     &quot;Sir, I found this bug in the kitchen,&quot; CyberShark said out of \nbreath. He \n&gt; needed to catch his breath before he could explain.\n&gt;     &quot;Yes, we seem to be having an infestation problem. It&#39;s nothing \nof \n&gt; importance. Yet.&quot; Magmatron replied.\n&gt;     &quot;But sir you don&#39;t understand, there no--urgk,&quot; CyberShark said \nas \n&gt; Magmatron lifted him off the ground by his neck.\n&gt;     &quot;Don&#39;t tell me what I don&#39;t understand. Do yoy understand \nthat?&quot; \n&gt; Magmatron said putting him down.\n&gt;     &quot;Yes sir. But the Computer doesn&#39;t show them as organic \ncreatures. They \n&gt; are machines.&quot; CyberShark said.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I could go further, but I wanna see what Phobia does with this \nnews.)\n\n\n"}}
