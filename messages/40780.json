Darkwing finally stood awakening from his dark \nslumber, looking around and seeing Firestrike staring right back at \nhim.  Darkwing took a step back towards Dreadwind, as Firestrike \npulled out his sword.  \n\n&quot;AAAHH GO!&quot;  Darkwing cried out as he jumped into the air \ntransforming into his jet mode, as DReadwind followed in suit.  The \ntwo combined making a super jet, and blasting off at incredible \nspeeds.\n\nHavotron and the rest of D.E.D flew forward as the screaming jet \nwhipped past them.  &quot;What the slag&quot; Havotron said.  &quot;Dreadwing, \nget over here&quot; he yelled.\n\nThe jet pulled at fast turn coming back to Havotron, not saying a \nword.  As the group arrived at where the Dark Avian used to be, \nHavotron landed, followed by Dreadwind and Darkwing, now \nseperated, Needlenose, and Scrapper, and hopefully the rest of the \nD.E.D members.\n\nWhen he landed he looked around, seeing a few select \nDecepticons, but no base.  &quot;What is this Deception, future \nfollowers of the Great Havotron.&quot; he yelled out.  \n\nFirestrike stepped forward.  &quot;What do you mean, what Deception, \noh great Havotron&quot; he said very mockingly.  \n\n&quot;Where is Megatron&quot; Havotron replied pointing his unfiltered-energy \ncannon at FireStrike.  Not recieving a reply fast enough a blast of \npure , dangerous energy, blasted out of the cannon nailing \nFireStrike, sending him flying at the ground, hundred of meters \naway, once again, awakeining the other side of FireStrike.  &quot;Stupid \nMegatron, once again he sends us out to get killed while he runs.  \nBut I will win, and show the others that my leadership qualities are \nbetter then the Megatron ancient styles&quot;\n\n"}}
