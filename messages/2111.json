His lips had still been firmly pressed to hers and the whole world had fallen away, it wasn&#39;t long until she felt his back muscles tense under her touch as the giddy feeling he felt set in. Just the feel of his muscles clench like that had sent a second shiver up her spine, this one was just not as easy to shake off!\nShe was almost completely lost in the moment and Prowl himself when she had heard a stray voice erupt from nowhere, she had opened her optics, watched Prowl break from her and reluctantly look at the source of the voice while keeping an arm and a wing firmly around her.\nShe had followed his reluctant gaze until her own optics fell on Striker, her own look a little reluctant and a bit annoyed that they had been disturbed.\nIron Raptor heard Striker and Prowl converse a bit before she suddenly caught Striker&#39;s last comment. Bonus? Her? She blushed at this but a small smile was caught on her lips and she couldn&#39;t remove it.\nIron Raptor looked at Prowl then back at Striker as she slid her hand from his back to his chest, hoping that she hadn&#39;t tickle him in the process. \nThe introduction to Striker from Prowl was unneeded but she liked to hear his voice anyway, she knew Striker from when she had first come to the Ark. He was a nice bot.\nShe saw his wounds and gestured with her optics towards them.*\n\n&quot; Better get to a chamber and get yourself healed, never tell when the next Pred or Alliance attack&#39;ll be. We need all the able bodied soldiers we can get and a wounded bot is no good to anybody.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then slid her hand a little higher on Prowl&#39;s chest-plate but low enough for both of their comfort. She thought about how Prowl would ask of how she knew Striker and how she would answer, but even as she stayed pressed to his body she was a bit concerned for the wounded bot in front of them. Business before pleasure.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
