He calls &#39;Tocar&#39;, of which he has no excuse for (if he \neven IS a BW fan), and when I said that I was the descendant of Optimus \nPrime, he called ME power-hungry!  Then he made up a G1 story that Prime died \nin the end of G1.  Now I know that they wouldn&#39;t allow death in the show, \neven the Rebirth.  Did he read my profile?  We are friends, not rivals.\n\n"}}
