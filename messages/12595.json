Glad to see \nthe \n&gt; reaction to my return. I&#39;ll now take back the chars that I lent out \nbefore \n&gt; last friday.\n&gt; \n&gt; Forgive me if this post is a bit inaccurate, but I just read a \nwhole lot of \n&gt; posts, and am a bit confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/Prowl/Autofire/Striker/Shredder/Rex/Firearm/Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus opens his eyes. He wasn&#39;t feeling well. The Alliance \ncommander looks \n&gt; down at his arm, seeing the last traces of the shimmering which had \nphazed \n&gt; him out days before dissapear. He hated that feeling, it always \nleft him \n&gt; dizzy. Zardus clentches his fist, relieved to have a physical body \nonce \n&gt; again, after his absence. He stands up, looking around the lab of \nthe \n&gt; Alliance base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Walking toward a computer console, the Alliance commander presses a \nfew \n&gt; buttons, a table rising out of the floor in the middle of the room. \nOn the \n&gt; table was strapped the femm that Reptilica and Bloodystrike had \nbrought in a \n&gt; few days ago (IR&#39;s new char).\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus taps his wrist, his wrist comp popping up. Tapping a few \nbuttons, he \n&gt; checks the messages he had recieved. He smiles at Skulletron&#39;s \nreport. The \n&gt; pair seemed to be doing well.... But it was too dangerous to send a \nreply, \n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire would probably detect it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus looks over the &#39;resumes&#39; from Inzola and Stranato. He \nactivates his \n&gt; comm-link, sending the two bots a transmission (I&#39;m assuming that \nthe resumes \n&gt; had their names on them).\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Inzola and Stranato,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;I understand that \nyou wish to \n&gt; join. Is this correct?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus looks back at the femm on the table. She&#39;d have to wait, he \nhad more \n&gt; important things to do. The Alliance commander turns around, \nexiting the lab \n&gt; and heading for the bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All Alliance members,&quot; he says into his comm-link, sending the \ntransmission \n&gt; to all Alliance bots except for Skulletron and Feline (because \nthey&#39;re in the \n&gt; CF), &quot;I&#39;m back. I&#39;ll be at the bridge catching up on recent events.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He switches his comm to Nemesis Enforcer&#39;s frequency.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Nemesis, I have returned, has anything major happened lately?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl appears back at the CR room of the Cybertronian Fire. He \nlooks around, \n&gt; a bit dazed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Computer, locate Iron Raptor,&quot; he says to the nearest console, a \nlocation \n&gt; coming up on the screen. Prowl walks off toward the location, eager \nto see \n&gt; the bot he loves once again.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Autofire looks after Paralysis as the bot runs off toward the \ngunfire, then \n&gt; turning to look at Adrax.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Should we help &#39;im?&quot; he asks, looking around the room.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Striker appears back at the Ark, nearly falling as his body phazes \nin. He was \n&gt; dizzy, the ussual result of these sort of things. The Maximal looks \naround, \n&gt; noting that alot more panels have fallen from the cealing. He \nactivates his \n&gt; comm-link, setting it on a Maximal frequency.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m back, everyone,&quot; he says into it, &quot;What&#39;d I miss?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Shredder appears in the jungle, looking around. Mantella was \nnowhere to be \n&gt; seen. His scanners reported that she was a bit away, slowly heading \ntoward \n&gt; the Destron base. He takes off at a jog, heading for her.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Seeing BrightBlade and Gangon fall, Firearm walks over to \nBrightBlade, \n&gt; picking her up and putting her over his shoulder, Rex doing the \nsame to \n&gt; Gangon. Firearm activates his comm-link, sending a transmission to \nChordate.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sir, the intruders are neutralized. What do you want done with \nthem?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster blinks, appearing in the cargo hold of the CF. He activates \nhis comm, \n&gt; heading for the bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m back, Chordate, how&#39;s the intruder situation?&quot; he asks into \nhis comm, \n&gt; exiting the cargo hold.\n\n\n"}}
