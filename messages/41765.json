She had grown accustom to sleeping in \nmouse mode. She walked out of her room and headed towards the bridge. \nShe looked and saw Galvatron still sleeping in the chair. She smirked \nand tried not to laugh. Let sleeping bots lie, she thought.\n\nShe walked over to the holo-projector and looked at the bases. She \nsaw her short time base, the Black Fortress. She sighed and started \nto miss her predacon friends from past days.  She looked over her \nshoulder to Galvatron. She sighed. She wanted to learn more about \nthis ship.  She sorted out priorities in her mind and smiled as she \ngot things straightened out. \n\nShe sat down at the projector console. She put her hand over the hand \nplate, but nothing happened.  She relized she would have to get a \ncopy of Galvatron&#39;s handprints inorder to activate the equipment. She \nwould also have to get his voice programmed into her synthesizer in \norder to activate some of the other stuff in this ship.  Once that \nwas done, she would be able to run things. Like she had always been \nable to do with the other bases she had lived in. She never felt safe \nunless she had run over most of the systems and the defence gear. She \nsmiled at her plans on how to get this base to respond to her.  She \nwould try the upfront approach first. If that didn&#39;t work, well, she \nwas a pred after all. She knew she could get it done. She glanced \nback at Galvatron. She got up and walked over to him. &quot;Say, can you \nshow me how to operate the long range scanners for incoming bots?&quot; \nknowing he&#39;d be awakened, but she could calm him down if he got mad. \nShe survived Megatron, she could survive anything. \n\n\n"}}
