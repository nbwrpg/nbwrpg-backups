Not even agony would keep him from doing what he so =\r\npassionately set out to do.  He concentrates on the figure on the bed, and =\r\nbravely endures the burning sting of the attack, not giving into it&#39;s venom=\r\nus scourge on his system.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m here, don&#39;t worry, a bee sting isn&#39;t going=\r\n to stop me from doing what I came here to do, trust me.  You&#39;ll be all rig=\r\nht, I promise.&quot;\n\n\n\nHe keeps his hand on the figure&#39;s chest, as he now looks=\r\n at the insect who impailed him. His stare is cold and adament, an expressi=\r\non commonly used by Optimus Prime who had many legendary battles against Me=\r\ngatron back in the day.\n\n&quot;If you&#39;re looking to drain my power, you&#39;re defin=\r\nitely going about it the wrong way.  You won&#39;t find it there, or anywhere y=\r\nou think is accessable.&quot;\n\nHis compassion to successfully bring Rodimus back=\r\n, fuels his determination, and stamina.  He remains strong, although in som=\r\ne considerable pain, he shows no sign of weakening.  The power that was dri=\r\nving him was the power of the most simplest of creatures.  A power he suspe=\r\ncted was not at all exhibited by his insectile enemy.  He gives Vestige a n=\r\nodd, letting him know that he was all right, and then turns to the insect o=\r\nnce more.\n\n&quot; You have no sense of compassion therefore you can not fight a =\r\npower that is not familliar to you.  I knew that, I knew that from the firs=\r\nt time I encountered you.  So why do you keep on trying to defeat me, when =\r\nyou have no inclination of what power I&#39;m using to defend my comrades and m=\r\nyself?  Think about it, if you keep fighting it will only weaken you. If yo=\r\nu do not, and surrender, you may spare yourself a lot of grief and hardship=\r\n.  I know you can colonize, and a colony should be able to find alternate s=\r\nources of food and fuel.  You may not have compassion but you have intellig=\r\nence.  If I were you I&#39;d start using it before something adverse happens to=\r\n you.&quot;\n\nHe narrows his optics at the insectoid. \n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson =\r\ngrits his teeth and bares the pain inflicted on him. He was not about to gi=\r\nve up now, not when Rodimus really needed him. He remembered how Vestige ha=\r\nd been invigorated by his transfer of power from his chest core, where a be=\r\nating heart still pulsates. It would prove useful again, and this time, he =\r\nneeded a way to channel that power into the figure lying on the bed. He use=\r\ns his arm to shield away the insects who were stinging him. With the other =\r\narm, he reaches out to the figure&#39;s chest, and puts his hand on him gently.=\r\n He concentrates deeply and tries to channel his own spirituality into the =\r\nfigure lying on the bed. His very soul now acting upon his heart out of the=\r\n one power that no force could fight. The power of compassion, of love, and=\r\n of loyalty.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Rodimus, I&#39;m here now, and there is nothing that wil=\r\nl stop me from bringing you back. My hand is here for you now. And this tim=\r\ne, I will never let go.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; For a brief moment that large wing=\r\ned insectiods are held at bay as\n&gt; Tuscon attempted to direct his flow of e=\r\nnergy into the still form that\n&gt; lay on the bed. The figure itself shuddere=\r\nd once as if taking in some\n&gt; deep rattling breath and then lay still.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Meanwhile the winged insects still came at Tuscon thier furiously\n&gt; onlsau=\r\nght barely slowed by Tuscon&#39;s defensive movements. Each insect\n&gt; was nearly=\r\n as large as Tuscon, and looking something flying a preying\n&gt; mantis. Thier=\r\n fore-claws were large and sharp as they took swipes at\n&gt; the Autobot befor=\r\ne them, thier movements relentless and even some how\n&gt; desperate, as if the=\r\ny knew that somethng was about to go dreadfully\n&gt; wrong if they didn&#39;t stop=\r\n Tuscon!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile towards the middle of the floor Vestige was fightin=\r\ng a\n&gt; desperate battle of his own against his foes! Once and then again the=\r\ny\n&gt; sank powerful claws into him forcing him back, and each time he fired\n&gt;=\r\n blasts from his weapon barely holding them at bay!\n&gt; \n&gt; The figure on the =\r\nbed shuddered once more as bright optics lit up and\n&gt; looked at Tuscon. How=\r\never at the same time Tuscon could feel the\n&gt; barbed claws of one the insec=\r\ntoids bite deep into his shoulder!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
