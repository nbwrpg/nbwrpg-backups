He still hadnt figured out why. but for now he was free of the\n&gt; Predacons and ready to be come a Maximal. From what he saw, the Ark was\ncrap,\n&gt; but the new cruiser looked excellent. Rat Trap, now changed from Predacon\nto\n&gt; Maximal, sent a distress signal to the Maximals. He was dying, and he\nneeded\n&gt; help. The Predacons turned there backs on him, and he needed a good home.\n:::\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Inferno and Jackle watch the Maximal cruiser with great curiosity.\nThey\n&gt; saw it set down, and make contact.

We should burn this\nnew\n&gt; colony to the ground!\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Jackle ::: Its not that simple.
