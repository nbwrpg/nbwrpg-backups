Even though their \norganic muscles would grow after training, I don&#39;t think it&#39;d make \nmuch difference over their much-stronger mechanical structure. It \nmakes sense that metallic stuff would be stronger than notmal organic \nmuscles.\n\nHowever, Transformers are sentient beings, and as so, can learn. So, \nin effect, training would allow them to learn new techniques, change \nold ones, etc. And if they were training with other bots, they&#39;d \nlearn their tactics, and become better at fighting. See what I mean?\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  OCC: DONT FORGET THEY ALSO ARE ORGANIC. DONT YOUR MUSCELES GROW \nAFTER YOU \n&gt; TRAIN OR WORK OUT. ITS THE SAME THING.
