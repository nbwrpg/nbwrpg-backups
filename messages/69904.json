I&#39;m sure T=\r\nucson&#39;s already figured me out&#39;n hid it somewhere else. It used ta be in Pr=\r\nime&#39;s chest, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s where it is anymore. I know that bot =\r\nScorponok, he&#39;s not stupid. If he feels that somethn&#39; ain&#39;t right, he&#39;ll go=\r\n out of his way ta make sure nothn&#39; goes wrong. And I saw inside his chest,=\r\n he doesn&#39;t have it in &#39;em, that was a lie. If anything, he probably has it=\r\n hidden somewhere in a different grid all together.&quot;\n&gt;\n\nScorponok grunted a=\r\ns he moved swiftly over the terrain, his form\neasily able to traverse the u=\r\nneven surface. While designed primarily\nfor sub surface travel, he appeared=\r\n to be doing quite well in the\nterrain he was in.\n\n&quot;He moved it a couple of=\r\n grids away?&quot; Scorponok sounded a bit\nskeptical. &quot;I thought the Matrix had =\r\nto stay housed within Optimus\nPrime&#39;s form?&quot;\n\nEven as they spoke Hydras&#39; fo=\r\nrtress came into view.
