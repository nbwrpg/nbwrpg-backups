It \ncould have been put a little more politely perhaps. \n\nI don&#39;t feel I was pointing in the wrong direction (not sure what I \nwas pointing at either), and nor do I expect you to get the RPG \nright away. I also didn&#39;t automatically know everything about your \nweapon. I understand the function of the weapon based upon what you \nwrote earlier. My post was more refering to what was said in the \nupper paragraph of this post. \n\nI wasn&#39;t intending to say that your weapon wasn&#39;t appropriate for \nthe rpg. I did speak my mind saying that perhaps a reduced number of \nshots was preferable after reading your suggestion that you would \nfire it at a rate of 2 shells per post. The whole misunderstanding \nstarted by me forgetting to bring up rule changes to the rest of the \ncouncil to be reviewed.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I fully understood the attitude/new guy comment.\n\nHow would you prepare yourself for new people who come in with lots \nof new ideas? If our system is lacking, I want to use your knowledge.\n\nThere are 3 moderators because we&#39;re human, and are quite capable of \nmistakes.\n\naerosmith: \nI don&#39;t believe that I said &#39;don&#39;t post while I am gone&#39; (though my \nmistake if it seemed like it). I was suggesting that it would be \nmore logicial and reasonable if when in battle, people regulated \ntheir posting frequency so that everyone fights the battle, not just \na few people. =)\n\noff topic, now that Galvatron is present, is he going to be a loner? \nor is he going to join the Predacons?\n\nKyle: \nYa, it was more like 4-5 days at a minimum. \nWhere exactly are you coming from? If a moderator didn&#39;t have power, \nwould that person really be a moderator? I&#39;m wrong quite often, and \nI have openly admitted it. There are however, occasions when I don&#39;t \nbelieve that I&#39;m wrong, and therefore I won&#39;t admit to being wrong.\n\n--------------------------\n\n*sigh* the criticism that comes with being a moderator is \nunquestionably considerable. Too bad I&#39;m not perfect.\n\n\n&gt; Whoah, way to point your finger in the wrong direction.  The only \n&gt; posts I made that had anything to do with the battle in the last \n&gt; couple of days were to clarify the weapon&#39;s function.  It&#39;s not \nlike \n&gt; I kept shooting!  Jeez, just because you&#39;re a mod doesn&#39;t mean you \n&gt; automatically know everything about a weapon someone else designed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not here to stand around and look pretty either.  If anyone \nneeds \n&gt; an attitude change, it&#39;s the people who expect the new guy to not \n&gt; know shit about how RPGs work.  I&#39;ve had a ton of writing and \n&gt; roleplaying experience, thank you very much, and I know what I&#39;m \n&gt; doing.\n&gt; \n&gt; You ought to be a little more prepared for those who show up with \na \n&gt; slew of ideas ready beforehand.  I&#39;m not saying all my ideas \nshould \n&gt; go through, I&#39;m saying I have them ready for when there&#39;s an \nopening.\n\n\n"}}
