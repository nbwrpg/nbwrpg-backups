There \nwas over 200 messages to read, and only one had something to do with \nmy chars, and that was only Drillbit asking Starscream how long to \ngo. And somebody said that there was a rule against building bases or \nsomething, but when I built the embassy nobody complained. And Koj, I \nknow that you got rid of the chip, but my character Prebon doesn&#39;t. \nHe&#39;s not done with you yet. Oh No. Not by a long shot. And Soulstice \nis right about KSL. All you do is complain if somebody does a little \nthing wrong. Half of your posts are telling somebody that they broke \nthe littlest of rules. You don&#39;t see any of the other moderators \ngoing after the rules like that. Too me it seems you find joy in \ntaking the fun out of other people&#39;s post. So why don&#39;t you just keep \nyour mouth shut and concentrate on your own stuff.)\n\nVulois\n\nVulois saw the look of joy come up on Battera&#39;s face, and than die \ndown. She must have been thinking something would go wrong. He felt \nlike that to, and he felt like he could not leave the Alliance for \nsome reason. He also thought that the farther they pursued this, the \nstronger those feelings would be. But they had to try.\n\n&quot;Would their be anyway we could extract the information from me?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream answered Drillbit.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know. I have to find him first.&quot; Just than his radar started \nbeeping, and Inferno came on the screen.\n\n&quot;Got him! Follow me!&quot;\n\nStarscream took off.\n\n(Is Inferno still talking with Darkmouse?)\n\n\n"}}
