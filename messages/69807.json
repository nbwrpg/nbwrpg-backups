He turns sharply to Kup.\n\n&quot;Then all the more reas=\r\non to return the favor.  Kup, when Rodimus was in his right mind, you did n=\r\not give up on his beliefs.  I respect you, I always will, but when it came =\r\nto me trying to suggest something out of the box, you called it wrecklessne=\r\nss and something that shouldn&#39;t be attempted.  Truth is, Hydras and Percept=\r\nor are onto our old school method of doing things, truth is, IT&#39;S TIME TO T=\r\nHINK OUTSIDE THE PROVERBIAL BOX!&quot;\n\nHe had never yelled at Kup, and most cer=\r\ntainly did not mean it, but something was building inside him.  Something h=\r\ne had not shown even to Kup in fear that he may disrespect his old friend. =\r\n But things were different, and in order to fight innovation one must embra=\r\nce it.  He was indeed ready to embrace innovation.  He paces vigorously as =\r\nthe energon flows into his system.\n\n&quot; Nothing is impossible Kup, nothing.  =\r\nI&#39;m most certainly not giving up on Rodimus or Nightlight.  And I&#39;m not goi=\r\nng to let Hydras get away with this!  It&#39;s time we showed them that the Aut=\r\nobots are not extinct yet!  IT&#39;S TIME TO TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!&quot;  \n\nHis vo=\r\nice at the last statement, mirrors that of old Optimus Prime, who always sa=\r\nid those words when it was time to go into battle.\n\nAll the time, his outbu=\r\nrst occurs right beside the fallen body of his old leader.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup:\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup took an Sleepy Eli=\r\nta and said softly &quot;I&#39;m close enought to Rodimus to assure that he wouldnt =\r\nbe easy to reprogram as Predacon in normal circuntances, but when the matri=\r\nx was captured... It&#39;s hard to explain... Nightlight jsut was a bait... it =\r\nisnt the frist time that hydras capture her.... When Elita was a baby, Hydr=\r\nas snatched her from inside the base... a maximal died tried to rescue her =\r\nbut we failed... she was reprogramed then and I should admit it, Perceptor =\r\ndid an excellent job&quot;said with bitterness Kup&quot;She almost died when we repro=\r\ngramed her back to her maximal original program&quot;and looking to elita  he ad=\r\nded &quot;After the matrix were captured, she again disappeared this time Hydras=\r\n used a posed maximal to lure her out our sight... We knew that she had dis=\r\napeared cause she always gives Elita her good night kiss, she never have mi=\r\nssed it... Rodimus ran outside the base looking for her and he disappeared =\r\ntoo; I guess that Hydras took advantage of Rodimus&#39;s emotional status to br=\r\neak him... We had just loose the battle and we didnt pay attention when the=\r\ny have vanished&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup Shook his head &quot;I told you, Tucson, once we get t=\r\nhem out side the BlackFortress wotn be easy to reprogram them back to Maxim=\r\nal... I almost Willing to force Perceptor to tell us what kind of locks he =\r\nhad done even it that mean to forget all Maximals and Autobots protocols&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Sandy \n&gt; Sent: Monday, March 15, 2010 9:18 PM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@=\r\nyahoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: Back to the Ark\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Tucson nodds a=\r\nnd opens an energy port leading directly into his left wrist. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, t=\r\nhat sounds good Lord Elder. Here, this will make it easy to administer the =\r\nenergon.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He takes a seat near everyone but especially near Elita. Ro=\r\ndimus and Nightlight were already taken from her and he was not about to le=\r\nt her fall into the same fate. Her sadness to him is a torture he felt she =\r\ndid not deserve. She had done nothing to no one and in return was suffering=\r\n a great deal. This angers him yet he tries desperately to hold back his el=\r\nevating temper. He cracks his knuckles to try and calm himself down althoug=\r\nh at this point, he didn&#39;t know if he could ever calm down.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;As if the=\r\n battle between us and Unicron wasn&#39;t enough. Now Hydras, Cyclonus and Scou=\r\nrge have to go on a meaningless power trip and torment innocent Autobots an=\r\nd Maximals without rime or reason. I know if Rodimus were in his right mind=\r\n, he would not tolerate it, and certainly not Optimus. As far as I heard fr=\r\nom what I learned while at the fortress, Cyclonus is feeding off the power =\r\nof the Matrix which is in Rodimus&#39;s body. That&#39;s what&#39;s making him stronger=\r\n. Well, guess what? I&#39;m prepared to cut that umbilcal cord no matter how mu=\r\nch it damages my own spark. I learned something about self worth. What am I=\r\n worth? How can I be worth something when there are lives just starting out=\r\n there that are more precious than my own? And how can I say I&#39;m worth some=\r\nthing when we have young aspiring Autobots and Maximals just starting their=\r\n careers as soldiers? They have their whole lives ahead of them, and by Pri=\r\nmus I&#39;m prepared to give back what&#39;s been taken from them, THEIR FREEDOM!&quot;\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
