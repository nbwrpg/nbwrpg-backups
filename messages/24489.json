In the mid \nof her leap, wings made of energon spread out from under her armor \nand caught her decent. She landed a little unsteadily, with a stunned \nlook in her optics. She looked over her shoulder. Wings. The sons of \nmaintenance bots built wings on her. \n\nShe stared straight at Omnious in bane. &quot;Slag you!&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Ominous held his chin, where she had kicked him.

Heres your first \nlesson...lets hope \n&gt; you wont need another one.&quot;\n&gt;     He raised both of his hands in fron of him, and shot out bolts \nof Energon \n&gt; at Quasar.
