Then, suddenly, everything was moving at\nlight speed. She was swooshing down long tunnels, lights flashing past\nand colors of all sorts.  She wondered if this  was what the edge of\ntime looked like. Then, she stopped. She was floating in midspace\ninside a giant computer.  It was like a hollow ball, only, with a\nmatrix core in the center of it all.  She floated around it. She heard\na voice, barely a whisper call her name and her new name. It came from\nthe matrix core.  She glided towards it. Just as she was about to take\na closer look, lightening flared out and grasped her. She would have\nscreamed, but she was seperated from her body and coudln&#39;t make a\nsound.  The lightening started to pull her into the matrix core. She\nstruggled and kicked and fought, but it pulled her inside.  Then\nblackness, nothing. No pain, no air, no fear, no happiness, nothing.\nSimple and complete nothing.  Then, she saw a light. It was faint, but\nit was the brightest thing she had ever seen in such blackness.  Then\na voice reached her audio receptors. It sounded like Perceptor.  She\nfelt herself floating towards the sound of Perceptor&#39;s voice. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Kestral, sounds nice for a maximal of course..&quot;and looking to the\nfemme he said &quot;now my future and tracherous maximal, just relax and\nlet me work....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He estarted to typed buttons and started to check the monitors about\nspark-download proces \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Dark Mouse \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Friday, May 20, 2005 1:59 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Reclusa\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Reclusa::\n&gt; \n&gt;   She had an indignant tone in her voice. &quot;I am perfectly happy with my\n&gt;   own name thank you very much.&quot;  Then logic over ran her regal attitude\n&gt;   protocol programs. &quot;BUt your right. I will need a new name. Hmm, what\n&gt;   about... &quot; She tried not to choke as she let the name escape from her\n&gt;   vocal systems. &quot;......Kestral.&quot;  She didn&#39;t like it, but it did sound\n&gt;   Maximal-ish. &quot;Yes, Kestral, a small winged bird of prey. Smallest of\n&gt;   the hawks. Perhaps that might work.&quot;  She let her optics glance at\n&gt;   Perceptor. She wondered if he didn&#39;t feel sick to his metabolic\n&gt;   processors as much as she did. &quot;Kestral. Kes for short.&quot;  She\n&gt;   shuttered. &quot;Ick, well, let&#39;s hurry up and get this over with. The less\n&gt;   time I have to be a Maximush the better.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
