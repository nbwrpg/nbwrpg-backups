If you want to control them, I do not mind \n=\r\ntheir appearance.))\n\n\nLord Elder&#39;s commands were carried out by the station=\r\n and the guns \nerupted into the air with a deadly symphony of wreckage! Fir=\r\nepower \nripped into the invaders as first the shuttle&#39;s batteries and then =\r\n\nthe Ark violently pulled sweeps from the skies! \n\nHowever much like the la=\r\nst battle the sweeps dispersed, making them \nmuch harder to hit. Using thei=\r\nr agility and speed they turned in the \nair, spinning as the weapons contin=\r\nued to pepper the skies with \nbullets and energy!\n\nLegacy for his part pull=\r\ned back, using the Ark as an additional \ndefence as he laid into the oncomi=\r\nng sweeps. Much like Lord Elder&#39;s \nattack, it was effective but the sweep d=\r\nisperesed, leaving him to \npick one or two out of the air at a time rather =\r\nthen destroying many \nat a time. \n\nAs Jhiaxus and Scorponok, Grimlock and H=\r\nydras and Rodimus all \napproached from their different vectors, they could =\r\nall see the grim \nvista of the sweeps, and the number of them was staggerin=\r\ng. At the \ncenter of all this Cyclonus floated a cold calm amidst the storm=\r\n of \nsweeps that floated around him. \n\nTo those who had been at the battle =\r\nabove Atlantis the sight brought \na darker reality: Although there were not=\r\n as many sweep here as there \nwere at Atlantis, with Cyclonus were several =\r\nother minions: Darkfate \nand Nightstrike as well as three others which were=\r\n unknown - A \nwarning that this battle may prove to be far more dangerous t=\r\nhen the \none before.\n \nAs Grimlock landed and attacked his breath weapon at=\r\ntack proved to be \neffective, striking down several sweeps and singed sever=\r\nal others as \nthey maneuvered out of his way. \n \nAs Hydras approached from =\r\nthe rear his guns opening up on the rear \nflank of the sweeps, they dispers=\r\ned into the skies as several of them \nwere brought down and many more came =\r\nin to take their places. \n\nAs the sweeps coiled around, absorbing the attac=\r\nks from the would-be \ndefenders, in unison they began to open fire on Ark a=\r\nnd Legacy as \nwell as Grimlock and the defending shuttle!\n\nAt same time min=\r\nions were receiving orders from Scourge who was \nhimself floating into posi=\r\ntion and was more then ready to prove \nhimself, &quot;Tumult, Nightstrike and Da=\r\nrkfate You are with me! We go to \ndestroy the ark, and TAKE the Matrix!&quot;\n\nT=\r\nhe answer from Tumult was quick, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; as he powered up his \nengines a=\r\nnd maneuvered himself into position near the top of the host.\n\nStrangely th=\r\ne response for the approaching Decepticons and Predicons \nwas a bit differe=\r\nnt - Although the Sweeps avoided combat, no combat  \nwas initiated. Instead=\r\n Hydras recieved a call: \n\n&quot;Hydras&quot; Cyclonus&#39; calm voice crackled over the =\r\ncommunication lines \nin an ancient Unicronian code. &quot;You were once Galvatro=\r\nn, I can feel \nhis essence within you, and I have felt it since you have ap=\r\nproached. \nI have given you and yours a stay of execution because of that \n=\r\nancient connection between us. Approach no farther and live, leave \nand you=\r\n will be rewarded when our work here is done.&quot;\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n"}}
