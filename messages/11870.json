His insides were \nmessed up.  Luckily not only was he a pyromaniac, he was \nintelligent.  A plate covering down there had been added to his tank \nmode to keep unfortunate mishaps like that from happening, though he \ndidn&#39;t have mobility.  \n\nHe transformed to robot mode, flame cannon in hand.  He fired off \nthree fireballs at Rodimus Prime.\n\n\n"}}
