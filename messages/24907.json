This bot was\n&gt; getting irritating and didn&#39;t know when to fall down.  He knew it would be\n&gt; dumb to try and pull his arm free, and he was racing to think of\nsomething.\n&gt; He saw a leg of Luna&#39;s moving to swipe at his face.  He followed it for a\n&gt; brief moment, firing a single optic blast at the incoming paw as it got\n&gt; closer, trying to stop it, or blow it up as an added bonus.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
