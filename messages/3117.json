He is not the Dinobot that betrayed Megatron. This creature \nthat stands in your midst is apparently a mere clone, perhaps a drone. Look \nhim, and look at me. I am the Dinobot that had followed Primal for the glory \nof victory for the Maximals. I have not returned to argue the fact that I am \ntrue.
