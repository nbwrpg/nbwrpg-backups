He wasn&#39;t \nhuman, he was a bot. At least she thought he was a bot. He looked \nmore like a bot than a human.\n\nShe jumps back as he bolts upright, relaxing when she sees that he \nwasn&#39;t bolting a her. Fenox looks down and reads the words he wrote.\n\n&quot;Oh!&quot; She exclaims as she finally understands what D had been trying \nto say. &quot;Well, whoever you came with were all killed in that crash. \nI&#39;m very surprised you survived.

D sat back. What to do?!\n&gt; Wait! He bolted upright, his ears straight in the air. Maybe he \ndidn&#39;t have \n&gt; to speak to them at all! His speech might be in need of work but \nhis writing \n&gt; was something that was perfect.\n&gt; D snapped his head down to look at the ground as he scribbled just \nwhat he \n&gt; wanted to say in the dirt of the island.\n&gt; She HAD to understand!\n&gt; After he was through D pointed to the words, looking from Fenox to \nthem and \n&gt; back again.\n&gt; On the ground he had wrote: Where are the humans I had come here \nwith?*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
