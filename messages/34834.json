Several laser blasts streak past \nhim, one hits his side armour, leaving a smoking groove. Mini \nrockets crash by him and into his top, shaking him and almost \nknocking out of flight. Astroblast swoops down towards Fireblade, \nand meets Switchblade there.\n\nSwitchblade smiles, still cloaked. He throws the remains of \nFireblade into the hatch, then hops in himself. He yells to \nAstroblast, &quot;Hey, &#39;Blast, we&#39;ve got another passenger waiting over \nthe hill, make sure to get him when you leave.&quot;\n\nAstroblast&#39;s rear thrusters launch again, as he curves around to \npick up the last target, Perceptor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMenasor leaps forward, Prowl&#39;s missiles smashing into his virtually \nunmolested chest armour, causing him to hesitate a little. \nIncarcinator&#39;s charges land behind him, the explosions throwing up \ndirt and ashes around Menasor&#39;s feet. Menasor lunges at Prowl, \ntrying to grab him in his large hands.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRippersnapper ducks under the missiles. He stops right in front of \nOrion. He suddenly leaps forward, at Orion&#39;s chest, trying to claw \nhim. (Alloran, is Orion as stupid as Rippersnapper? j/k Firing \nmissiles that would damage both bots... something that \nRippersnapper does. =)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLynxiz laughs at Grounded&#39;s words, &quot;I hope that I don&#39;t get gunned \ndown.&quot; She shivers and turns to Nightlight, &quot;Nightlight, you were \ngoing to show me to my quarters for my stay?&quot; \n\n"}}
