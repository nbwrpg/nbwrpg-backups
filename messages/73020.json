They have stone tools and weapons, and are all standing\naround a large statue of some sort.\n\nSlowly they start to chant and to walk around the statue, their voices\nrising and falling in some strange language as they wave various\nplants at the stone statue.\n\nThe statues themselves look like some sort of large insect, perhaps a\npreting mantis or some other type of insect. In fact the statues\nappear to be carved in the likeness of the PREDACON called BLIGHT!\n\nThe statue of BLIGHT looked to be farily well carved, includsing eye\nholes and intriccatly careved mandibles. Then the eye holes began to\nglow as its mandibles opened.\n\nAs this happned the proto humans stopped chanting as several members\nrobed in animal furs stepped foward and began to throw glowing rocks\ninto the madibles of the statue of BLIGHT!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
