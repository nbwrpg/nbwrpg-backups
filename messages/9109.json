She transformed \ninto wolf mode and picked up the rat.  she decided first to find \nScorponok and giv him the rat.  Then she would find the maximal who \nwas on the prowl. \n\nShe followed her nose and came to the clearing where DarkMouse and \nScorponok where at.\n&quot;Good, you finally caught her.  How&#39;s she doing?&quot;\nShe dropped the rat in Darkmouse&#39;s lap and turned to look at \nScorponok.  &quot;Look, I&#39;d love to stay and chat, but I have something I \nwould like to do.&quot;\n\nShe turned and ran off into to woods.\n\n\n"}}
