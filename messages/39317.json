Do that again, and you&#39;ll recieve the same\n&gt;pain ten times worse!  I&#39;ve been here longer than you, and I know more than\n&gt;you...\n&gt;\n&gt;Decadel rubbed the back of his head, then turned around to face AzureBlade.\n&gt;\n&gt;Decadel: Ok, I officially don&#39;t trust that guy, but you, AzureBlade, you&#39;re\n&gt;alright....Just DON&#39;T thump me in the back of the head, ya hear?\n&gt;\n&gt;Decadel liked Hugar&#39;s childish resort-to-violence approach to not getting\n&gt;his own way.  Sure, it was stupid, and intelligence was something that\n&gt;Decadel believed was the best quality of anybody, but the Terracons, his\n&gt;faction, would still need the brawns-over-brains type.\n&gt;\n&gt;Decadel: AzureBlade, wait here, I&#39;m gonna take this guy to the waiting\n&gt;room....\n&gt;\n&gt;Decadel walked past Hugar, purposely bumping into his side on the way, and\n&gt;Decadel walked off towards where he figured the waiting room was.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
