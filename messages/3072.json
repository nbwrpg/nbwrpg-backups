Seeing Breakdown and Hiss he sighed.\n&gt; -Predacons,- he thought, noticing their shape, size, and colors, -I guess\nthe\n&gt; Ark has been conqured-.  Raising his laser rifle, which came from\nsubspace,\n&gt; he took aim at Breakdown.\n&gt;\n&gt; --------\n&gt;\n&gt; Smokescreen came from the foilage, his electro-discharge rifle ready.\n&gt; Looking around he saw a few craters.  &quot;Rather deserted.&quot; Smokescreen\n&gt; activating his com to the giant ship.  &lt;This is the Maximal unit,\n&gt; Smokescreen, respond please&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -------\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramhorn jumped a little, hearing Smokescreen message suddenly.  &lt;This is\n&gt; Ramhorn, welcome, Smokescreen.  I guess you could say I&#39;m temporarily in\n&gt; command, defense wise at least.  Go to the door in front of you and enter.\nI\n&gt; will be there to great you shortly after&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -------\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;Alright...&gt; Smokescreen said slowly over his com, ending the comlink.\n&gt; Walking to the door in front of him, the massive orange-yellow door slid\n&gt; open, Smokescreen entering the doors shutting and sealing behind him.\n&gt;\n&gt; --------\n&gt;\n&gt; Beachcomber was about to pull the trigger, but decided not too.  There\ncould\n&gt; be mass reinforcements from the Ark if he attacked.  Jumping from the\n&gt; foilage, he slammed he rifle across Hiss&#39; face, sending the Predacon merc.\nto\n&gt; the ground, mech-fluid trickling down his face.\n&gt;\n&gt; Breakdown laughed, uppercutting, sending Beachcomber slamming to his back.\n&gt; &quot;Worthless Maximal.&quot; Breakdown said with a smile, jumping downwards at\n&gt; Beachcomber.  Beachcomber raised his feet, Breakdown landing on them,\n&gt; Beachcomber yelling out in pain as the Alliance member hung in the air\n&gt; momentarily, but with all his strength the Maximal sent Breakdown flying\ninto\n&gt; a tree behind him.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Turn your EGROUP into a GROUP BUYING GROUP!
