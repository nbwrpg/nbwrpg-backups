Tarantsulas was no where to be seen \nwhere to he looked. He forgot to notice that the night was still in \neffect. He may be away or asleep by now. He paused. Black Arachnia \nmay be asleep as well, and him being absent from her side. He \nwouldn&#39;t be so skittish if Hell Beast wasn&#39;t around. He had a feeling \nhe would kill her if he wasn&#39;t about to guard her other side. \n\nHe wasn&#39;t near tired, but he might as well check. He walked down the \ncorridors to Black Arachnia&#39;s quarters. He put a multi-fingered \nappendange on the door and called through it, wondering if she was \nthere, &quot;Sugar-bot?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
