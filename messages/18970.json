The lightening \nsindged her scales and the shots hit hard.  She transformed into bot \nmode and lay on the floor. She got up, shaking on her hands and \nknees. She looked \nup at the bots. She hissed loudly at them and then stood up.  She had \nto escape before they killed her.  She then she looked up and saw \nanother vent.  She drew her pistol and shot the vent cover off. She \nthen drew her cross bow out and shot it at the vent.  She pulled \nherself up with the pully mechanism and crawled into the vent shaft \nagain. She transformed into snake mode and slithered down the shaft, \nleaving a traiil of mech fluid behind her as she went.  She had burnt \nscales and holes from the shots.  She knew she wasn&#39;t going to make \nit long in this ship.  She turned the corner on the shaft.  She \nfinally came to the vent that went to the cargo bay.  She pushed the \nvent cover off and slithered out.  She didn&#39;t transform and hit the \nground with a thud in snake mode.  She could barely move.  She curled \nup her coils and stayed there near the cargo bay door way, waiting \nfor them to find her again. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Treadshot/Hurricane:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Treadshot pulls his arm away and fired 10 shots, and Hurricane \nfired 5 \n&gt; lightning bolts at Diamond::\n\n\n"}}
