Anyway, here is my comic relief character.\n\n::Woleritron::\n\n    The wolverine awoke early that morning to go out and hunt, little did he \nknow that there was something hunting him. The wolverine stalked quietly \nthrough the shrubbery, hunting a caribou. Then he got a whiff of something \nunnatural.\n    All of a sudden a metallic creature sprang from the trees. It grabbed the \nanimal, a strange process took place, especially for a Transformer. Instead \nof scanning the DNA of the animal this Transformer melded with it. There were \nside affects though. One being the temper that he had. After a few hours of \nmerging everything calmed down. The Transformer stood up in his new robot \nmode. He looked himself over. In between his fingers were silver studs. He \nmade a fist. from the studs three claws popped up, then he tried the other \nhand, the same thing happened.\n    &quot;Wolveritron, Beast Mode,&quot; The bot commanded. Nothing happened. \n&quot;Wolveritron, Pretty please Beast Mode?&quot;\n    Nothing again. He started in on the signal of the Maximals, they were in \nfor a big surprise.\n\n"}}
