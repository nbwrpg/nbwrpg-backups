As to the beast wars we shall see how long\nthe Militrons will participate in that. If we stay we\nshall see just who we side with.&quot;\n\n  Panzertron checked his ship&#39;s chrono, it wouldnt be\nlong before the Alliance leader showed up, in fact he\nshould be with in visual range of the Iron Fist if his\ncalculations where correct.\n\n  &quot; Main battery crews to thier stations,&quot; Panzertron\nsaid,&quot; Set course two-seven-one, increase speed to\nmaximium.&quot;\n\n  &quot;Gun crews to thier stations, speed 33 knots,&quot; one\nof the drones replied.\n\n   &quot;I&#39;m going to demonstarte the main battery for\nyou,&quot; Panzertron said. A small island came into view.\nIt wasn&#39;t very big, oval shaped and low to the water\nexcept for a moutian on one end. It was very far away.\n\n  &quot; Bring us about, fifteen degress, prepare to fire\nstarboard broadside,&quot; Panzertron ordered.\n\n   Perfectly the ship&#39;s bow swung one way and the main\nbattery turrets swung the other, all eight of the\nplasma rifles aiming toward the island.\n\n  &quot;Select mountain as target,&quot; Panzertron said,&quot; You\nmay fire when ready.&quot;\n\n   A short time later the eight plasma rifles\nthundered sending shearing red beams of energy\nslamming into the mountain. The mountain exploded into\nsmoke, dust and debris and no longer exisisted.\n\n &quot;They do more damage to ship&#39;s hulls then soild\nrock,&quot; Panzertron said,&quot; And can hit from quite away\naways. The only problem is they take a few seconds to\nbuild up thier charge again after each discharge.&quot;\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
