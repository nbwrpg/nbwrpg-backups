Such delights \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;never before paid attention to. Should they or should they not? They were after \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;all Decepticons... well, she was... he was supposedly Predacon... however, parts \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;of him once were Decepticon... so, she classified him as such. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;No, she wouldn&#39;t care any more, she would let such emotions show.. but only \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;to him. Towards others, she would appear the harsh, rough, battle hardened \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Decepticon. But to him... she would be that warrior mixed with the most rare soft &amp; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; gentle side towards only him. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;In his embrace, she nuzzled against his chest &amp; shoulder. As mind numbing &amp; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;strange as it was, she welcomed it now. &quot;Mmmm.... just... a moment away from \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;the strenous chores of being a Decepticon. It&#39;s best kept in grand company such \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;as yours.&quot; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Resting her head upon his chest, at the base of his neck, she turned serious. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;&quot;I have been waiting for this for many a millenia,&quot; her voice soft but \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;serious. &quot;I would do anything for you.&quot; &amp; she did... proving it over &amp; over. (As \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;this is done many times in other RPGs) \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Looking up at him with her crimson optics, her one hand came up to touch the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;side of his face that was Megatron, gently &amp; slowly. &quot;I do love you. Ever \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;since I first gazed upon you with my optics,&quot; she confessed. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;MSN Fotos: la forma m�s f�cil de compartir e imprimir fotos.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.msn.com/8HMBESMX/2746??PS=&quot;&gt;Haz clic aqu� &lt;/a&gt; Get 2 months FREE*. &lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
