He looks at the wall in front of him. It would classify as a small \nfield...\n\nDeathScythe pushes a button on the device, a beam emerging from the tip of it \nand going into the energy field.\n\nSeveral seconds later, DeathScythe was on the other side of the field, \nlooking around the containment room. He smiles. This was too easy. \nTransforming back into beast mode, the still cloaked hideous creature runs \noff silently down a corridor.\n\n"}}
