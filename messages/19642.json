She looked at him,&quot;No, \nDestructor is here, but out of the base.  He should be back soon. In \nthe mean time, can I offer you something to eat or drink? I&#39;m sure \nthat from your long journey, and would like to freshen up. I have a \nspare room that you may use. Please, feel free to stay as long as you \nlike. &quot; she stood up and looked at the floor. Somehow, deep in her \nspark, she knew what would happen. She didn&#39;t want to admit it, but \nsomewhere, somehow, she knew the answers. &quot;Please, later on, I will \nwish to speak to you. I will contact you when I need to talk to you \nagain.&quot; She walked out of the room and opened her link. &quot;Drillbit, \nplease see this guest to a spare room for the night. Thank you. When \nyou are finished, please see me. I will need to talk to you.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
