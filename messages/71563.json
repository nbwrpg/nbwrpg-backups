Remember, you will be on your own for some time at the&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\ndistance you are going. The Fuzors are already out on patrol and I&lt;br&gt;\nwi=\r\nll call them in as required, but if you run into more trouble than&lt;br&gt;\nyou =\r\ncan handle it will take some time for them to reach your&lt;br&gt;\nposition.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nHe paused thoughtfully, &quot;NIghtshift is still under repairs but should=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nbe finished soon. Lord Elder should be ready as well as a few others.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nWe will all be ready and standing as a buffer.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs LEO talked =\r\nWING CALIBER sent a communication link for NIGHTSHIFT to&lt;br&gt;\nreport to thei=\r\nr location once his repairs were complete, the same for&lt;br&gt;\nRAT TRAP and LO=\r\nRD ELDER. LEGACY was of course to remain where he was&lt;br&gt;\nas guardian of th=\r\ne Ark.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPreston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-55--747082273--\r\n\n"}}
