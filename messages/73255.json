Reasonably strong, but something that\nany of the MAXIMALS could either dig through or blow up given time.\n\nWINDLORD and PERCEPTOR determine much the same thing. The stone around\nthe gates can be dug through by PERCEPTOR easilly enough, or if they\nthey wanted to use firepower they should be able to break the lock\nwith a few well placed shots.\n\nAt the same time the piece of the dart that was still embedded in\nNIGHTSHIFT was begining to glow an odd silver color as NIGHTSHIFT lay\nunconscious.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
