Just a li=\r\nttle hint of advice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK and SKYSHADOW continue to wat=\r\nch each other for a long moment\n&gt; none of them moving, thier optics bright =\r\nand their weapons steady.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You know I know more about what&#39;s going on =\r\nhere than you.&quot; CRYOTEK\n&gt; said as watched SKYSHADOW warily. &quot;If we&#39;re going=\r\n to get out of here\n&gt; we need knowledge as much as firepower.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Fine!&quot;=\r\n SKYSHADOW said, &quot;You want to run the show, then run it.&quot; His\n&gt; words were =\r\ndark and deep. &quot;But will revisit this later, just you\n&gt; wait.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK=\r\n nodded although for a long moment neither of them dropped\n&gt; their weapons.=\r\n Then finally they both lowered them and for a moment it\n&gt; seemed as if the=\r\n Predacons breathed a sigh of relief.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking over at RAT TRAP and QUI=\r\nCKSTRIDE, &quot;Is that why you think that\n&gt; Hydras was taken, in addition to Cy=\r\nclonus and Scourge?&quot; He raised an\n&gt; optic ridge. &quot;There is another commonal=\r\nity that you have not yet\n&gt; considered.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME nodded as he was ca=\r\ntching on to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What! What?&quot; BANTOR said looking around as if he was=\r\n the only one who\n&gt; didn&#39;t catch it.\n&gt; \n&gt; SANTON leaned in, &quot;All of them we=\r\nre have some of Unicron built into\n&gt; them. Even Hydras is built from Galvat=\r\nron Unicron&#39;s former herald.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a surprised expression BANTOR nodde=\r\nd.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well we have lost our guide.&quot; LEO PRIME said looking down at the\n&gt;=\r\n destroyed tracker. &quot;so they couldn&#39;t all have been holograms either.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n NOCTORRO looked at LEO PRIME, &quot;Now which way?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; TERRORGATOR pointed, &quot;=\r\nThere?&quot; he said as he pointed at the caves.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a grunt from BAN=\r\nTOR, &quot;Yeah, but how do we know where it goes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME walked toward=\r\ns the caves. &quot;We don&#39;t, but I would think this\n&gt; is the same place Tuscon w=\r\nas taken.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile unknown to most some of the PREDACONS had taken i=\r\nt upon\n&gt; themselves to make other plans . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For the moment, up=\r\n in the trees, BLACKARACHNIA had managed to try and plant\n&gt; &gt; a powerful ho=\r\nming beacon tracking the IFF of Hydras &#39;before&#39; his capture,\n&gt; &gt; which each=\r\n PREDACON had been planted with.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hopefully being able to use it to =\r\ntrack HYDRAS even through the heavy\n&gt; &gt; jamming in the area.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; If these new beacons that BLACKARACHNIA was trying to plant were the\n&gt; eq=\r\nuivalent of digital bugle in power outputs, what she was getting\n&gt; back was=\r\n like &#39;triangles&#39;. It was heavily muted and only good for\n&gt; short range, pe=\r\nrhaps 40 or 50 meters. Actually better than what they\n&gt; were getting before=\r\n, which was virtually nothing past 10 meters.\n&gt; \n&gt; However having said that=\r\n there was still no trace of HYDRAS. If he was\n&gt; still alive, he was out of=\r\n sensor range.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For the moment, wtih transponders only =\r\nworking at close range, DINOBOT had\n&gt; &gt; vanished along with DRILL BIT into =\r\nthe tunnels in all of the chaos, probably\n&gt; &gt; unnoticed, wtih BLACKARACHNIA=\r\n hiopefully being able to at short range at\n&gt; &gt; least give them a heading t=\r\nhrough the comm jamming to track the tracer\n&gt; &gt; beacon upon HYDRAS, if poss=\r\nible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With WASPINATOR up in teh air hopefully assisting with provid=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; triangulation, with luck they mnight have a rough heading to break =\r\noff and\n&gt; &gt; begin tracking thier &#39;leader&#39; even as SKY SHADOW and CRYOTEK pu=\r\nt on a show.\n&gt; \n&gt; The tunnels appear to be going down, the ground sloping d=\r\nown almost\n&gt; sharply in spots. The tunnel walls are made completely of ston=\r\ne and\n&gt; rock and, at least at this point, look natural. There was still no\n=\r\n&gt; trace of HYDRAS as they went down. However the interesting thing was\n&gt; th=\r\nat the lower they went the shorter their transponder signal became.\n&gt; Whate=\r\nver it was they were going into, the interference on their\n&gt; com-links and =\r\ntransponders was getting stronger.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC - Entirely up to you if t=\r\nhis works for purposes you have SuperCyc, and\n&gt; &gt; feel free to have it not,=\r\n them be on a wild scraplet chase, or for thier\n&gt; &gt; sensors to not get ahol=\r\nd of anything at all or be able to communicater.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s all itnended as a=\r\nn attempt, anyways.

The Cons&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and Preds got plenty of that.  Notice how it =\r\ndidn&#39;t take any of us yet?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s like I dunno, but it&#39;s like it kno=\r\nws how we operate and what makes us&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tick.  I could be wrong, but t=\r\nhat&#39;s what it feels like..&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride nods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re right, it hasn&#39;t taken any of us Maximals yet.  It&#39;s like i=\r\nt knows&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; something.  Chaos..  It could be feeding off of chaos, and=\r\n that&#39;s one thing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; we don&#39;t have here.  Among us anyway.  Guys, I t=\r\nhink Rattrap&#39;s onto&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; something, if we keep our composure as we are,=\r\n and our commitment to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cooperation, whatever grabbed them won&#39;t gr=\r\nab us. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap looks to everyone.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; W=\r\ne gotta keep our cool, even if  it is gonna be difficult..&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; He looks over to Skyshadow and Cryotek.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If you guys =\r\nwanna avoid what happened ta your boss, ya better keep it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tagether=\r\n.  Just a little hint of advice.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCRYOTEK and=\r\n SKYSHADOW continue to watch each other for a long moment&lt;br&gt;\nnone of them =\r\nmoving, thier optics bright and their weapons steady.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;You know I =\r\nknow more about what&#39;s going on here than you.&quot; CRYOTEK&lt;br&gt;\nsaid as watched=\r\n SKYSHADOW warily. &quot;If we&#39;re going to get out of here&lt;br&gt;\nwe need knowledge=\r\n as much as firepower.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Fine!&quot; SKYSHADOW said, &quot;You want to run t=\r\nhe show, then run it.&quot; His&lt;br&gt;\nwords were dark and deep. &quot;But will revisit =\r\nthis later, just you&lt;br&gt;\nwait.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCRYOTEK nodded although for a long=\r\n moment neither of them dropped&lt;br&gt;\ntheir weapons. Then finally they both l=\r\nowered them and for a moment it&lt;br&gt;\nseemed as if the Predacons breathed a s=\r\nigh of relief.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLooking over at RAT TRAP and QUICKSTRIDE, &quot;Is that =\r\nwhy you think that&lt;br&gt;\nHydras was taken, in addition to Cyclonus and Scourg=\r\ne?&quot; He raised an&lt;br&gt;\noptic ridge. &quot;There is another commonality that you ha=\r\nve not yet&lt;br&gt;\nconsidered.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME nodded as he was catching on=\r\n to it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;What! What?&quot; BANTOR said looking around as if he was the =\r\nonly one who&lt;br&gt;\ndidn&#39;t catch it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSANTON leaned in, &quot;All of them w=\r\nere have some of Unicron built into&lt;br&gt;\nthem. Even Hydras is built from Gal=\r\nvatron Unicron&#39;s former herald.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWith a surprised expression BANTO=\r\nR nodded.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Well we have lost our guide.&quot; LEO PRIME said looking do=\r\nwn at the&lt;br&gt;\ndestroyed tracker. &quot;so they couldn&#39;t all have been holograms =\r\neither.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNOCTORRO looked at LEO PRIME, &quot;Now which way?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nT=\r\nERRORGATOR pointed, &quot;There?&quot; he said as he pointed at the caves.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nT=\r\nhere was a grunt from BANTOR, &quot;Yeah, but how do we know where it goes.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME walked towards the caves. &quot;We don&#39;t, but I would think this=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nis the same place Tuscon was taken.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMeanwhile unknown to mos=\r\nt some of the PREDACONS had taken it upon&lt;br&gt;\nthemselves to make other plan=\r\ns . . .&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; For the moment, up in the trees, BLACKARACHN=\r\nIA had managed to try and plant&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a powerful homing beacon tracking =\r\nthe IFF of Hydras &#39;before&#39; his capture,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; which each PREDACON had be=\r\nen planted with.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hopefully being able to use it to track =\r\nHYDRAS even through the heavy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; jamming in the area.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NE=\r\nW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf these new beacons that BLACKARACHNIA was trying to plant =\r\nwere the&lt;br&gt;\nequivalent of digital bugle in power outputs, what she was get=\r\nting&lt;br&gt;\nback was like &#39;triangles&#39;. It was heavily muted and only good for&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nshort range, perhaps 40 or 50 meters. Actually better than what they&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nwere getting before, which was virtually nothing past 10 meters.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nHowever having said that there was still no trace of HYDRAS. If he was&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nstill alive, he was out of sensor range.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; For the moment, wtih transponders only working at close range, D=\r\nINOBOT had&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; vanished along with DRILL BIT into the tunnels in all o=\r\nf the chaos, probably&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; unnoticed, wtih BLACKARACHNIA hiopefully bei=\r\nng able to at short range at&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; least give them a heading through the=\r\n comm jamming to track the tracer&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; beacon upon HYDRAS, if possible.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; With WASPINATOR up in teh air hopefully assisting with p=\r\nroviding&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; triangulation, with luck they mnight have a rough heading=\r\n to break off and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; begin tracking thier &#39;leader&#39; even as SKY SHADOW=\r\n and CRYOTEK put on a show.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe tunnels appear to be going down, t=\r\nhe ground sloping down almost&lt;br&gt;\nsharply in spots. The tunnel walls are ma=\r\nde completely of stone and&lt;br&gt;\nrock and, at least at this point, look natur=\r\nal. There was still no&lt;br&gt;\ntrace of HYDRAS as they went down. However the i=\r\nnteresting thing was&lt;br&gt;\nthat the lower they went the shorter their transpo=\r\nnder signal became.&lt;br&gt;\nWhatever it was they were going into, the interfere=\r\nnce on their&lt;br&gt;\ncom-links and transponders was getting stronger.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; OOC - Entirely up to you if this works for purposes you have =\r\nSuperCyc, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; feel free to have it not, them be on a wild scraplet=\r\n chase, or for thier&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sensors to not get ahold of anything at all o=\r\nr be able to communicater.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s all itnended as an attempt, anyway=\r\ns.
