He had flown in beast mode before,\n&gt; when he made his way to the CF, but that was only\n&gt; because he had to. He had never flown just to fly.\n&gt; To\n&gt; him, no feeling in the universe could compare. He\n&gt; couldnt understand how any bot with flying ability\n&gt; would rather fight than do this.If every bot could\n&gt; feel what he felt at this moment, he thought, then\n&gt; maybe the fighting would stop.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!\n&gt; Messenger.\n&gt; http://im.yahoo.com/\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
