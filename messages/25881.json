How did Magnus get inside the CF? And if he \nis, you do realize that most areas are restricted due to the lockdown, \nright? Oh, Happy B-Day Roborick! Sorry it&#39;s late, but I couldn&#39;t get on \nyesterday! I probably won&#39;t be able to post tomorrow, maybe late at night, \nbut no promises. IR, are you still posting with Diana? I haven&#39;t recieved \nanything new in a while^_^)\n\n\nHysteria/Tavatron\n\nHysteria:\n\nThe doors buckled and groaned with the blast. The horn missiles had \npenetrated the door, and due to it&#39;s weakened moleculer structure had \ncreated a rather good sized hole considering the density of the door:\n\nCF COMP: Penetration, main entrance doors.\n\nHysteria dropped what she was doing and brought up a hazy image of the \nblasted entry way on the console screen:\n\n&quot;Seal the door.&quot;\n\nCF COMP: Unable to comply. Seal has been penetrated.\n\nHysteria banged a fist against the console. So much for the lockdown. It was \nstill in effect everywhere else, but the door HAD been penetrated. Well, the \nshield was still active, though a little shaky it should hold. Plus the \nceasefire prevented the Alliance from blasting at the shields.\n\nTavatron:\n\nTavatron growled under her breath as she fought every primal instinct she \nhad to jump on Lion and rip him limb from limb. The waiting had made her \nanxious and extremely tempermental. It was bad enough she couldn&#39;t shoot \nanything, but to merely stand by while her commander was insulted was \nseriously pushing it. Something had better happen, and soon.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
