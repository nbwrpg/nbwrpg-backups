Even the large crater\nthat housed the main complex of buildings the once small group has\ngrown and connected, and they fairly glow with suppressed power. \n\nLarge engines moved drilling down to the lunar core to extract the\nenergy located there, as panes of reflective material are directed at\nthe sun to collect the solar power that shines through the openness of\nspace. \n\nWithin one of the buildings Cyclonus stood at the forefront of a vast\nchamber, its doors were standing open to the current darkness of space,\nstars winked and flickered in the distance. The walls of this chamber\nare constructed from metal and stone. Large lights lit the area\nbrightly from above and along the walls, the faintly crimson hue of the\nwalls giving this room a slightly eerie feel as the light spills out\ninto the open air.\n\nBut rather than looking at the chamber itself he was standing with his\narms clasped behind his back looking out of the skies as he\ncontemplated the up coming event, a satisfied look on his face. \n\nScourge walked up to stand next to him, &quot;All things are in readiness\nCyclonus.&quot;\n\nThe minion herald nodded, &quot;I have all the information that we need.&quot;\n\n&quot;What of the new ones that you created, will they be there as well?&quot;\nScourge asked as he stood next to his commander and friend.\n\nCyclonus shook his head slightly, &quot;Let us just say they have their own\nmission to fulfill.&quot; Cyclonus glanced at Scourge, &quot;If we need them, we\nwill have them in reserve.&quot;\n\nScourge nodded as he smiled eagerly. \n\nCyclonus turned to look at the chamber and the large numbers of sweeps\nthat were entering it and for the first time in quite sometime he\nsmiled. Without turning he spoke to Scourge, &quot;Give the order.&quot;\n\nScourge nodded and then stepped forward, &quot;MINIONS OF UNICRON!&quot;\n\nThe entire legion that paraded itself before them came to a stop, a\nvast company of sweeps turned to the front in anticipation. \n\n&quot;IT IS TIME TO TAKE TO THE AIR, TO ESTABLISH OURSELVES ON THIS PLANET\nBELOW, TO MAKE THEM FEEL OUR WEIGHT, OUR MIGHT, TO MAKE THEM FEEL\nFEAR!&quot;\n\nAs one the sweeps came to a ready position as the stowed their weapons.\n\n\n&quot;MINIONS . . . TRANSFORM!!&quot;\n\nWith a deafening sound all the sweeps shifted form as Scourge did the\nsame, hovering in mid air. &quot;MINIONS . . .  TO THE AIR . . .  AND ON ...\nTO ... VICTORYYYY!!!!&quot;\n\nWith that Scourge moved higher into the skies as the large numbers of\nsweeps headed into the blackness of space. \n\nCyclonus, stood on the floor as he watched them take to the air, his\nface beaming as he looked on. As the last one left the hanger and it\nall became quiet he too took to the air, transformed with a flare of\ntremendous power flew up and took his place at the head of the group. \n\nWith a massive burst of power the host took flight, left the moon, and\nlike some black arrow of death moved toward the earth!\n\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
