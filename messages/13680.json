Anyway, I&#39;ll use him \nin a bit.)\n\nVulois turned to Child.\n\n&quot;Good, now help me romove these computer boards. We are moving \neverything and I..&quot;\n\nA strange thought popped into Vulois&#39; head. A thought of confusion. \nThan Convix spoke.\n\nConfusion. The air one and the sea one are mislead about a meeting. \nCorrect this.\n\nVulois had been noticing lately that Convix had not been talking \nclearly the last few days. He probably knew why: It is stretching \nmost of it&#39;s power towards Child. Once the training begins, he&#39;ll \nneed a Convix too. He&#39;ll just have to figure this riddle out.\n\nThe air one and sea one, he thought. Who do I know who is...I know! \nBattera&#39;s a bat, so she must be air. And CyberSHARK! Okay, so their \nconfused. About a meeting? The Peace Talks! That&#39;s it!\n\n&quot;Hold on a second Child,&quot; and than something came over him. He hugged \nChild. &quot;I know it seems that I&#39;m being cruel. But you&#39;ve got to \nunderstand that it&#39;s for your good, my good and everyone on this \nplanet, and Cybertron&#39;s good.&quot; He walks away, and opens a comm to \nBattera and Cybershark.\n\n&quot;Guys, it&#39;s Vulois. I&#39;m picking up some confusion from you guys about \nthis peace talks. So let me just say some stuff, and than you can ask \nquestions. We&#39;re moving everything to our old Mountain Base. That is \nwhere we&#39;ll be holding our conference. I want you guys to keep \ntalking to the leaders, and than when you are finaly ready, come back \nto the mountain, not the embassy. We won&#39;t be leaving for a week, so \ndon&#39;t go now. Keep talking to the leaders. The reason I&#39;m moving is \nbecause of fear and attack. Plus we have 5 new guys to our team, that \nyou have to meet. Their&#39;s Child, and Windrazor and The Peace Angels. \nOh and...(Vulois pauses and thinks)...I don&#39;t know if you gys know, \nbut....Soundwave died. He was talking to Zardus, and he didn&#39;t want \nto come and so he killed him! He died valiently, in the service of \nour mission. He will always be remembered. And don&#39;t get discuraged \nabout Zardus. I&#39;m going to see him, with Child and Windrazor. Now, if \nyou have any questions, just ask.&quot;\n\n\nFliq\n\nFliq continued to look for Ramulus.\n\n&quot;Ramulus! Where&#39;d you get to? Don&#39;t tell me you got lost! Ramulus!!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
