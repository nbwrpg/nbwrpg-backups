That would be a problem for the \ntechbots not him, and the problem at hand had to be discussed first.\n\n&quot;I understand your precautions, I&#39;d probably do no less if the \nsituation were reversed.&quot; He knew better though. if the situation \nwere reversed a predicon would have blown them to bits by now and \ntaken the information. The spider was glad that the Maximals were \ndiplomatic creatures.\n\n&quot;If at all possible I would like you&#39;re science officer, your \ntactical officer, and every available Maximal leader in on our \nconference.\n\n(If your answers yes then arrange temporary quarters for Phobia \nsomewhere, if you don&#39;t trust him then I&#39;m sure you have room in the \nbrig until the meeting.)\n\n(If your answers no then)&quot;Do you at least have someone available with \nknowledge of temporal physics?&quot; Phobia asks, confident that the \nquestion just stumped Kluster. &quot;We will need them present, I&#39;m not \nall that great with history.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Zardus/Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus shakes his head. &quot;No questions.
