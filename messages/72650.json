I wil=\r\nl be\n&gt; posting my own answers as well in the next day or so :)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Prest=\r\non\n&gt;\n\n\nHey!  I&#39;ve been a Trasnformers fan since the mid-eighties, but was m=\r\nostly of the toys as a kid.  I remember my favorite toy was the old brick P=\r\nowermaster Prime and Predaking.  I was more of a cartoon fan and random iss=\r\nues of the comics, which I barely knew existed.\n\nI remembered in the mid ni=\r\nneties catching a random episode of Beast Wars on television (I think Call =\r\nof the Fuzors), and hadn&#39;t even realized Transformers was still around.\n\nI =\r\nbegan to peter into the fandom once I Found things like ATT (Alt-Toys-Trans=\r\nformers).  I watched most of Beast Machines, but only caught Beast Wars aft=\r\ner the fact.  I guess what really made me full blown &#39;into it&#39; again was Ro=\r\nbots in Disguise, which is still one of my favorite series.  \n\nMostly into =\r\nthe Marvel comics (primarily the Marvel UK ones), and I love Simon Furman&#39;s=\r\n work, and Budianski is awesome.  Not hugely into the Dreawmwave ones, and =\r\nthe IDW are hit and miss.  I rather like a lot of the Collector&#39;s Club thin=\r\ngs.\n\nI missed most of the Unicron Trilogy, have seen -all- of Animated, and=\r\n LOVE the ALlspark Almanacs.  I&#39;ve always been more into the fiction than t=\r\nhe toys, for whatever reason - probably it&#39;s easier to afford cartoon DVD&#39;s=\r\n than toys.  Love the live action movies as well.\n\nFavorite series is Trans=\r\nformers ANimated by far - love the toys, they have so much pesronality.\n\nUh=\r\nm, getting into RP&#39;ing..  My first Trasfnromers club I joined ~ 1999 or so,=\r\n got into a steady one around 2001 for those of you who know me in it (Tran=\r\nsformers the Fall of Night) and have been kicking around there since.  Spor=\r\nadically do Tabletop sessions and the occasional MUD, but that&#39;s about it a=\r\ns far as things go.\n\nAnyways, nice to meet you all here!  And you can tell =\r\nme when to start posting for &#39;In the Jungle&#39; again whenever the thread pick=\r\ns up, and will be on Wheelie as needed.\n\n\n"}}
