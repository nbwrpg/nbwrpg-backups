She took off in flight \nand flew off into the trees.  She returned a few moments later with a \nblue jay in her talons. She perched back at the same low branch that \nshe was on moments ago.  &quot;How about this instead of a rock?&quot; She let \ngo of the bird and let it fall near Lunarpine.\n&quot;One must be strong in order to fight.&quot;\nShe smiled and waited for him to eat the bird and then continue with \nthe game.  She really wanted to learn how to fight in hand to hand \ncombat, but not quite like this. But for now, this would suffice.\n\n\n"}}
