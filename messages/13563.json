She had just met him and he was \nshowing her great affections.  Not that she was complaining or didn&#39;t \nlike, far from it.  But since this was her first real contact with \nanother bot, she didn&#39;t know what to do.\n\n&quot;I..ah..I can..ah..hunt or...go with you to the...base..or..a..&quot; \n\nThen he kisses her again.  She was flattered, but didn&#39;t know how to \ndeal with this type of situation.  Combat, yes.  Fighting and \nstratagy, yes. Weapons, yes.  Kissing, not a chance.  There was never \na manual in her old barreks that was on this.\n\nShe felt something inside her race and pound. It was her spark.  It \nwas beating at what felt like light speed.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;         Dollen kept kissing GoldenEye, not wanting the kiss to \nstop.  But,\n&gt; then, another image of the beautiful fem bot streaked through his \nmind.  He\n&gt; stopped.\n&gt; \n&gt;             &quot;Hey, uh, maybe we should get back to base.  I can pass \non\n&gt; eating,&quot; he paused, and smiled, &quot;Or maybe, we should stay here for \na bit\n&gt; longer,&quot; He said and started kissing GoldenEye again.\n\n\n"}}
