She walked a little \ncloser. She kept checking the area for bots but saw none.  She used \nher sonar and discovered a bot in the area.  She was hoping it was \nmaximal.  She checked her scanner but it didn&#39;t register what the bot \nwas. &quot;Oh blast it all.&quot; she spoke aloud to herself.  She took out a \nsmall screw driver from her leg panel and worked on her scanner.  \nAfter working on it a bit, she checked again.  Her scanner was still \nmessing up. &quot; Oh, of all the times to have a malfunction.&quot;  she was \nmad at herself for letting this happen at such a crushal time.\nSHe knew there was another bot out there, but before she wanted to \ntalk to it, she had to make sure it was Maximal first.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Dachande85@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Wolveritron::\n&gt; \n&gt;     He didn&#39;t here a reply from the bot that had insulted him. He \nlooked \n&gt; around the Maximal Base and began scanning for any signals that \nwere not \n&gt; Maximal. He found one. He started to walk towards it, then thinking \nabout it \n&gt; he retracted his claws as to make it think he was going to help.\n&gt; \n&gt; (He&#39;s going after Battera)\n\n\n"}}
