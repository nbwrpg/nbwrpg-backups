Galvatron, fully healed, was\nplotting\n&gt; &gt; his next attack.  Then all of a sudden, a pod crashed near them.  It\n&gt; opened\n&gt; &gt; up and a massive(Optimal Optimus sized) robot stepped out.  One of the\n&gt; &gt; greatest Decepticon leaders ever, DEATHSAURUS!::\n&gt; &gt; Galvatron: Deathsaurus? but you were destroyed by Star Saber!\n&gt; &gt; Deathsaurus: Ah yes, Galvatron! My impudent successor. Do you call this\n&gt; hunk\n&gt; &gt; of junk a base?\n&gt; &gt; Galvatron: Why yes i do!  I lead a faction known as the Neocons.  Would\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; like to join?\n&gt; &gt; Deathsaurus: I&#39;ve got a better idea.  We fight for leadership!\n&gt; &gt; ::Galvatron needed no more hints.  He took a sword out of subspace, and\n&gt; &gt; Deathsaurus followed suit. They locked swords.  After a long time, the\n&gt; battle\n&gt; &gt; seemed to be nearly over::\n&gt; &gt; Deathsarus: You fought well(pant) Galvatron.\n&gt; &gt; Galvatron: As did you.\n&gt; &gt; Deathsaurus: Good bye, Galvatron........ Tigerbreast, Eaglebreast,\nattack!\n&gt; &gt; ::Tigerbreast and Eaglebreast deploy and rip Galvatron apart.  Megastorm\n&gt; &gt; sees::\n&gt; &gt; Megastorm: NOOOO! I was supposed to kill him!\n&gt; &gt; Deathsaurus: And i&#39;m supposed to kill you!\n&gt; &gt; ::He runs at him and slices his head off.  Mech fluid everywhere, the\n&gt; battle\n&gt; &gt; had ended.  The Aerocons, who had been watching in horror, found that\n&gt; &gt; Deathsaurus was there new leader!\n&gt; &gt; Deathsaurus:  From now on the Neocons will be led to glory and honor!\n&gt; under\n&gt; &gt; me!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: please put Galvatron and Megastorm on the deceased list, killed by\n&gt; &gt; Deathsaurus,.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
