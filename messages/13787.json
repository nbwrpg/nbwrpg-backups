He turns around and looks rather \ndispleaesed.\n    &quot;This vessle is really quite dangerous....I admit. Its automated, probly \nby an Artificial Intelligence Program. The only way to defeat it, would to be \nto transmit a virus into the protocol program of the A.I., and that is \nimpossible.&quot; He said smugly, as if he were going to leave them all to die.\n    Aracnia shook her head, &quot;So there nothing we can do?&quot; Her voice was \nfilled with hopelessness.\n    &quot;Well...further investigation of the Aliens might prove useful to there \ndemise. If you allow me, I would like access to all of the computers files.&quot; \nHe said turning back around to the computer.\n    Tarantulas shrugged his shoulders, and Aracnia looked to Darkmouse and \nQuickstrike. This was a hard call but she had to do it. &quot;Alright, you have my \npremission. But dont try anything....we outnumber you and your fraction.&quot;\n    Megatron narrowed his eyes and gave a chuckle as he went deeper into the \ncomputer files.\n\n    The Armada sailed across the vast darkness of the empty abyss that was \ndeep space. It had begun the journey from its home port to the distant, and \nrather unintelligent planet earth where the latest outpost had been placed. \nAnd now was destroyed.\n    The ship, measureing exactly one kilomiter in length and half a kilomiter \naround was a large, powerful ship with enugh firepower to turn a small moon \ninto ruble, let alone destroy a measly group of transformers who dar to \ndestroy one of the outposts.\n    Inside the ship were a series of endless computers and data tables. No \ncorridors, no rooms, nothing but data tables that held memory and everything \nthat ran the ship. The program, The Artificial Intelligence program, ran the \nship. It thrived in the main computer core and controled everything on the \nship, which actually was its body.\n    The A.I. was know as Apollo in the universal language that filled space. \nIt researched the beings know as Maximals and Predacons, knowing that \nMaximals were on the &#39;good&#39; side and the Predacons were on the &#39;bad&#39; side. \nBut that didnt matter. The ones on this planet would be destroyed and if they \nproved o be as weak and stupid as they seemed, Apollo would set a course for \nCybertron and destroy that as well. No need to have any competition for \nGalactic domination.\n    The vessle continued its course. In a few hours it would reach earth. For \nnow Applo enjoyed the view as pluto slowly came into sight.\n\n"}}
