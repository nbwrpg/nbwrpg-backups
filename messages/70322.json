Meanwhile stones and rocks of varying sizes began to fall. First\nit was grains of sand, then pebbles and then larger and larger pieces.\nTuscon continued to push forward, using his great size and agility to\nmove around what he could and to bull his way through what he\ncouldn&#39;t!\n\nFor the first few minutes it seemed as if a mountain was going to fall\non top of Tuscon and those along with him. After they had traveled\nseveral miles the only trembling got worse and worse, as the walls and\nfloor continued to shake and even split in spots.\n\n&gt;&gt;CRASH!!!&lt;&lt;\n\nTons of rock fell behind Tuscon, perhaps a mile or so back, falling\nbetween them and the area where the battle had taken place, making\nthat area totally impassable.\n\nHowever the area ahead was calm as they trembling stopped. A billowing\ncloud of dust came flowing up the tunnel from where the rock had fell,\nbut so far nothing dangerous was showing itself.\n\nAhead sensors could not detect any sign of Rodimus, however there was\nalso no other breaks or branches breaking off from their path. There\nwas only one direction Rodimus and his abductor could have gone -\nStraight ahead.\n\nThe air is in the tunnel was getting decidedly cooler as the group\ntraveled, and up ahead Perceptor could catch a slight scent of\nsomething mechanical. What ever it was out of range of sensors, but it\nwas up ahead and they were steadily approaching it!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
