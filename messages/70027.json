OHHHH SCRAP!&quot;\n\nHe sc=\r\nreeches loudly as he avoids another close call with a plasma blast.\n\n&quot;That =\r\nwas almost my left front tire, close one. Anyway, I really could use a hand=\r\n in here, I dunno how much longer my fuel reserves are gonna hold out. I&#39;m =\r\nat about a half a tank now, and the way I&#39;m gon&#39; here, that ain&#39;t gonna tak=\r\ne long ta go through... Gotta burn rubber, talk later, Nightshift out.&quot;\n\nOu=\r\ntside the fortress, Tucson Prime comes out of his trance. He holds his ches=\r\nt for just a moment.\n\n&quot;Sorry guys, I didn&#39;t mean to frighten you. I just go=\r\nt quite the wakeup call. We need to get into that fortress but first we nee=\r\nd to short out the control pannel that keeps it beneath that magma pool.&quot;\n\n=\r\nRat Trap shrugs. \n\n&quot;Lord Elder did mention somethn&#39; about blastn&#39; inta the =\r\npool, but we ain&#39;t got that kinda fire power on us.&quot;\n\nTuscon grins confiden=\r\ntly.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s all right, I do. Stand back, the first step to bringing light=\r\n to a black flame, is to create a backdraft. On second thought, I better do=\r\n this in vehicle mode. I can assure your saftey better than being in robot =\r\nmode.&quot;\n\nHe transforms into his missile truck mode, and opens his doors to h=\r\nis cab.\n\n&quot;Lord Elder, I&#39;m back, just needed to consult someone as to my nex=\r\nt move. It&#39;s my first day on the job as a Prime and I needed a little insid=\r\ne advice. And I got it. Kup, I also read you, and I&#39;m going to expidite thi=\r\ns mission a bit. It&#39;s dragged on far too long. Time for action not beating =\r\naround the rotary.&quot;\n\nHe lines himself up for the shot and aims both missile=\r\n carriers at the pool, targeting not in the center of the pool, but a sligh=\r\nt before getting to the middle of the magma chamber. Rat Trap and Quickstri=\r\nde buckle in, to anticipate the major kick back Tucson&#39;s missile launchers =\r\nmay have. Then, Tucson fires, as they kick back, causing him to lurch backw=\r\nard slightly as he gets used to firing them at the same time.\n\n&quot;Ughh, felt =\r\nthat.. Are you two okay?&quot;\n\nRat Trap is now on top of Quickstride, who is no=\r\nw looking to the control pannel.\n\n&quot;Umm, we&#39;re - okay.. Just a little - bit =\r\nshell shocked. Wowwww... Talk about kick back... It wasn&#39;t like ya didn&#39;t w=\r\narn us because ya did but we weren&#39;t expecting that...&quot;\n\nRat Trap rubs his =\r\nhead.\n\n&quot;Yeah, talk about the big bang theory.&quot;\n\nTucson rolls forward just a=\r\n slight.\n\n&quot; It even kicked me back a few feet. I have to learn to ground my=\r\n tires when I use those missiles. Sorry about that.&quot;\n\nRat Trap gets back in=\r\nto his seat and buckles up.\n\n&quot;So, how are we gonna get through this?\n\nTucso=\r\nn parks himself safely waiting for the results of his launch.\n\n&quot; We&#39;re goin=\r\ng to relight the dark flame. I have the power within me, the power of the M=\r\natrix. The dark flame, represents Rodimus, who&#39;s armor is black as pitch an=\r\nd flaming paint job dimmed to a drap pale color. That&#39;s the fire I need to =\r\nrekindle.&quot;\n\nRat Trap gasps as does Quickstride.\n\n&quot;But Wheels, that might th=\r\nat might do a number on ya.&quot;\n\nTuscon sighs.\n\n&quot; I know Rat Trap, it will. I&#39;=\r\nll still be a Prime no matter what happens, but if all goes well, we will g=\r\net Rodimus back and Cyclonus will pay for his deeds against Primus. It&#39;s wo=\r\nrth the risk my friends, it&#39;s worth the risk.&quot;\n\nRat Trap sheds a tear.\n\n&quot;Bu=\r\nt but what if it kills ya? What&#39;s Talon gonna do without ya? What am I gonn=\r\na do without ya? Wheels, you&#39;re the only real friend I ever did have. I don=\r\n&#39;t wanna lose ya.&quot;\n\nTucson could feel a tear drip on his dashboard. \n\n&quot; I p=\r\nromise you Rat Trap, neither Talon or you is going to lose me that easilly.=\r\n I may be out of commission for a few days, but it&#39;s not going to kill me. =\r\nRemember when we talked about the most powerful force in the universe? How =\r\nnothing could ever surpass that?&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot; I think so. Ya told m=\r\ne that love is a force no one can reckon with. Nothing breaks the bond of f=\r\nriendship no matter how powerful evil becomes. Love knows no boundaries and=\r\n is the only infinite force that keeps on living even when one has passed o=\r\nn long ago.&quot;\n\nTucson gently straps Rat Trap in more securely.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s righ=\r\nt Rat Trap. Remember that. It&#39;s our bond as friends that can never be broke=\r\nn. All of us, including Talon, Elita, Kup, Lord Elder, Depthcharge, Lord Pe=\r\nrseus, Legacy, Guardia, and Ravenchief have the power within ourselves not =\r\nbecause of tyranical strength, but because of that one thing that neither H=\r\nydras, Megatron or Galvatron ever had. And that was True Love. They rule wi=\r\nth force, not with compassion. Our heart is what is going to win us this ba=\r\nttle, our hearts are going to come together as one and we will save those t=\r\nhat need to be saved, and rekindle the lights that have nearly been blown o=\r\nut.&quot;\n\nHe starts up his engines.\n\n&quot; NOW, LET&#39;S DO THIS!

I have =\r\nthe power within me, the power of the Matrix. The dark \nflame, represents R=\r\nodimus, who&#39;s armor is black as pitch and flaming paint job \ndimmed to a dr=\r\nap pale color. That&#39;s the fire I need to rekindle.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rat \nTrap gasps =\r\nas does Quickstride.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;But Wheels, that might that might do a \nnumber=\r\n on ya.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tuscon sighs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; I know Rat Trap, it will. I&#39;ll \nstil=\r\nl be a Prime no matter what happens, but if all goes well, we will get \nRod=\r\nimus back and Cyclonus will pay for his deeds against Primus. It&#39;s worth th=\r\ne \nrisk my friends, it&#39;s worth the risk.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rat Trap sheds a tear.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&quot;But \nbut what if it kills ya? What&#39;s Talon gonna do without ya? What a=\r\nm I gonna do \nwithout ya? Wheels, you&#39;re the only real friend I ever did ha=\r\nve. I don&#39;t wanna \nlose ya.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tucson could feel a tear drip on his da=\r\nshboard. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; I \npromise you Rat Trap, neither Talon or you is going t=\r\no lose me that easilly. I \nmay be out of commission for a few days, but it&#39;=\r\ns not going to kill me. Remember \nwhen we talked about the most powerful fo=\r\nrce in the universe? How nothing could \never surpass that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rat Trap=\r\n nodds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; I think so. Ya told me that \nlove is a force no one can re=\r\nckon with. Nothing breaks the bond of friendship no \nmatter how powerful ev=\r\nil becomes. Love knows no boundaries and is the only \ninfinite force that k=\r\neeps on living even when one has passed on long \nago.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tucson gently=\r\n straps Rat Trap in more securely.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;That&#39;s \nright Rat Trap. Remember=\r\n that. It&#39;s our bond as friends that can never be \nbroken. All of us, inclu=\r\nding Talon, Elita, Kup, Lord Elder, Depthcharge, Lord \nPerseus, Legacy, Gua=\r\nrdia, and Ravenchief have the power within ourselves not \nbecause of tyrani=\r\ncal strength, but because of that one thing that neither \nHydras, Megatron =\r\nor Galvatron ever had. And that was True Love. They rule with \nforce, not w=\r\nith compassion. Our heart is what is going to win us this battle, \nour hear=\r\nts are going to come together as one and we will save those that need to \nb=\r\ne saved, and rekindle the lights that have nearly been blown out.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;H=\r\ne \nstarts up his engines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; NOW, LET&#39;S DO THIS!
