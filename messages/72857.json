An often enough\n&gt; circumstance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing up at TERRANOTRON, &quot;Me think that you should go.  He&#39;s my friend, I\n&gt; hope I know.  If I am the one who gets caught, for my sake you should not\n&gt; waste your own for naught.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Calling out again, boosting his vocalizer after he had given the Maximal who\n&gt; had warned him away, &quot;Me Wheelie Say Find Friends Today!&quot;  Letting it be\n&gt; known who he was, his vocalizer booming to announce his presence, for better\n&gt; or for worse now, waiting at the end of the bridge.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTERRANOTRON shrugged, &quot;Watch your tail.&quot; he said quietly as he flapped\nhis wings and launched himself into the air. &quot;Something is controlling\nhim, friend of no friend you are in danger.&quot; As moved upwards he\npointed at the bridge, &quot;if you need to run across it.&quot;\n\nAs the avian DINOBOT moved away GRIMLOCK burst through the foliage,\npractically knocking small trees aside and ripping up brush. He might\nbe in a smaller form now that he, like so many others had reduced\ntheir size across the centuries, but he was still strong and mighty\nand a true force to be reckoned with.\n\nAs GRIMLOCK&#39;s 12&#39; tall superbly armored Tyrannosaurus form made it\nself visible he roared, the report of it echoing through the trees and\nskyward. Birds flittered from the upper branches as animals scattered.\n\n&quot;Who dares be a friend of Grimlock?!&quot; GRIMLOCK bellowed as he looked\ndown at WHEELIE, his large jaws almost salivating. There was a crazed\nlook in his optics as his smaller arms flexed their hands. He may have\nlooked like the old GRIMLOCK, but he certainly wasn&#39;t acting quite\nlike him.\n\nBehind GRIMLOCK SNARL, SLUDGE and SLAG were no doubt making their\napproach from the sounds coming from the brush.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
