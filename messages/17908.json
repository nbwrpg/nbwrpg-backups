You go and get some rest. I&#39;ll keep an\n&gt; eye out here for you.&quot; she said in a cheerful tone.  She had a warm,\n&gt; genuine smile on her face.  She was just a naturally nice bot in\n&gt; general. She watched the scanners and jotted down the info that the\n&gt; scanner put out.\n&gt;\n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; She didn&#39;t respond.  She stayed inside her chamber and didn&#39;t try to\n&gt; make the connection to communicate wtih Veratis.  She cold barely\n&gt; hear him, like he was whispering at her. But she couldn&#39;t make it out.\n&gt; She was still a little hsaken from the power surge and didn&#39;t want to\n&gt; go through it again any time soon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk set up the lab equipment the best she could. Squizzy\n&gt; &gt; watching her didn&#39;t make her job any easier. Once set up she placed\n&gt; &gt; the somple of DNA from the bug she&#39;d found into a scanner. The bug\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; question was a scarab. She scanned the DNA into the computer. She\n&gt; &gt; added the DNA she&#39;d obtained when she&#39;d picked up Rat Trap. the\n&gt; &gt; computer scanned for similarities in the strutures. It would take\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; least an hour for the comparison to be completed.&quot;Watch this for me\n&gt; &gt; would you please, I&#39;m gonna get a little rest before my\n&gt; presentation\n&gt; &gt; to Zardus.&quot; She stepped into the corner and curled up. It wasn&#39;t\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; luxuries that she fealt she deserved but many places that Veratis\n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; them stop lacked suitable surroundings.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Veratis studied the scans from the Protoform which housed the spark\n&gt; &gt; of Shadow Wing. he thought it was time she was educated. The old\n&gt; &gt; science bot attached the receptors again and went into the\n&gt; protoforms\n&gt; &gt; mind. &quot;Hello Shadow Wing, how&#39;s my favorite patient today?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
