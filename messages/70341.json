His increase in speed was from a reasonable thirty miles=\r\n per hour up to about fifty where he finds that his resilliant armor serves=\r\n just as well if not better at the task of doubling as a battering ram.  Wi=\r\nth this he attempts to push forward, literally trying to throw his weight a=\r\nround.  His sonar was now picking up a ping in the tunnel. A very familliar=\r\n ping. \n\n&quot; Autobots, Maximals, I have a signal bouncing off my sonar detect=\r\nion systems.  If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d say they&#39;re comming from Rod=\r\nimus.  His alloys make a distinctive sound when they bounce off the sonar. =\r\n I&#39;m picking that up now.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot mans a computer inside Tucsons&#39; c=\r\nab.  She then looks to a radar screen with the object which the waves seem =\r\nto be bouncing off of.  She turns to Perceptor with a look of hope on her f=\r\nace.\n\n&quot;Perceptor, he&#39;s right.  It&#39;s Rodimus&#39;s signals coming through the ra=\r\ndar. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll find him, and we&#39;ll all be safe and sound as soon a=\r\ns we get everyone out of here.&quot;\n\nQuickstride is swift to join Tallon in fir=\r\ning off a few shots at the insects, and attempts to hit several of them.  A=\r\nll the while snorting loudly through nostrills.\n\n&quot; I can&#39;t wait to get out =\r\nof this roach motel!

With his warning shot made, he rolls forward on =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; his wheels with the light damage not effecting his engine nor his whe=\r\nels. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; He wasn&#39;t ready to quit, not by any means. Small damage were lik=\r\ne moon \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pebbles under his tires, simply roll with them and roll over t=\r\nhem.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The truck continues his relentless push forward.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;=\r\n Hit me all you want, I&#39;m not going anywhere except forward. We came \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nhere to retrieve our comrade, no matter what slag you throw at us. That \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; is all we want, nothing more nothing less.

Although Talon&#39;s shot misses\n&gt; &gt; its intended=\r\n target, it instead hitting high and wide, Legacy&#39;s shot\n&gt; &gt; finds its mark=\r\n hitting the insect square in the chest and sending it\n&gt; &gt; flying back into=\r\n the wall. It lands with a crunching sound and slides\n&gt; &gt; to the ground, it=\r\ns optics completely dull.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile the rest of the troopers surge =\r\nfoward! however due to the\n&gt; &gt; extensive armor plating of Tuscon and his gr=\r\nim determination, they\n&gt; &gt; push through with only a modicum of trouble. The=\r\n insects leap after\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon, but thier blades slide inaffectually along =\r\nhis armor, cutting\n&gt; &gt; only into his paint job, but little else. They are q=\r\nuickly left behind\n&gt; &gt; if Tuscon picks up any speed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The road ahead=\r\n looks clear. all the way to the main chamber about a\n&gt; &gt; half a mile away =\r\nwhere Rodimus and presumably where what the insectoid\n&gt; &gt; aliens called the=\r\n misstress resides.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The ground rumbled for a moment, and then a bla=\r\nst of cool air rolled\n&gt; &gt; down the tunnel, but all else was quiet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n(TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Sorry, I had to type this one out fast :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Presto=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
