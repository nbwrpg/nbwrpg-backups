Something sinister watches from nearby, four on two seemed fair, especially\n&gt; when one was already sniffing the Nebulan fuel. a hand went up directing a\n&gt; second, the second signaled the third, and then the fourth. insectlike wings\n&gt; spread from the leader and silently rose him above the others. the three on\n&gt; the ground now had a triangle formation around thier prey while the leader\n&gt; rose above them preventing any airborn escape.\n&gt; \n&gt; the one who&#39;d circled behind transformed to something similar to a double\n&gt; barrled tank with hoverwheels in the front and three sets of spiked treads\n&gt; in the back. four missles on each side of the dome on top readied for launch\n&gt; should the two fight in this direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Since this is Cybertron this will probably be thier only appearance in this\n&gt; story.)\n&gt; \n&gt; THE CYBRATS- young impetuous transformers with a streetgang mentality and a\n&gt;

cybertronic VTOL similar to a front half of a helecopter with buglike\n&gt; flapping wings instead of a propeller.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arty- muscular bot packing heavy artillary. transforms into tanklike object\n&gt; described above.\n&gt; \n&gt; Branding- the female flamethrower- transforms to a rectangular futuristic\n&gt; truck with a back capable of being used as a blast furnace.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogged- feral minded tooth and claw barbarian of the team, his idea of a\n&gt; good time is bite first and ask questions later,. transforms to four treaded\n&gt; terrain vehicle about the size of a snowmobile.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Jordan Guthrie &lt;gunthers8@...&gt;\n&gt;
