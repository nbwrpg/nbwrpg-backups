LOL Well there was no chance \nI \n&gt; wasn&#39;t gonna make it out.. but when they put the injections in, Mum \n&gt; sure thought so.. *wince, but laughs at her Mum* I thought she was \n&gt; more scared about it than I was. 7 injections in the right ear and \n&gt; about 5 in the other.. *sigh*\n&gt; \n&gt; But the numbing stuff (anisthetic.. spelling mistake, I&#39;m sure of \nit) \n&gt; is still working, so I&#39;m in a good mood. Apart from the fact that \nmy \n&gt; bandage looks like an onion wrapped around my head.. without the \n&gt; pointy bit at the top *_* And it&#39;ll be there for the next week. \nWAH!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks to Zardus, Carnage, Soulstice and Airshadow for wishing me \n&gt; well *_*\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay.. so.. talk to ya later!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Steph F.
