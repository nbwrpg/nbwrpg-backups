After that Perceptor \n&gt; activated Dark Rodimus and started to track the intruder. \n\nThe intruder looked up as his he noted changes in the readings, the ebb and flow of information. Then came the command through the system to sink the base underneath the magma of the volcano. \n\nWith a swiftness that would be surprising the shade pulled the memory module from the computer and slipped it into subspace. At the same time he sent a command to the spider-spy on Dark Rodimus, and for a brief moment the spy was jolted by a brief yet intense data burst as the information the spider had leanred was sent to him. Then with enviable computer savvy he counter-manded the command Hydras gave to have the base lower, telling it to instead drop its shielding and open the doors!\n\n(OOC: I am sure perceptor can stop that maybe?? but it should keep him busy for a moment hopefully.)\n\nWith a smile the intruder slipped into the shadows while cloaking himself in silence and stealth, and swiftly began moving up the corridores. Occasionally the intruder stopped and dropped small pods, each one sprouting legs and scuttling away, and then the intruder continued on. \n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
