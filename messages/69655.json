I nee=\r\nd you for \ntask&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The affect of the command was almost inst=\r\nant as Rodimus \nstepped back from Cyclonus and Scourge and looked over at P=\r\nerceptor. &quot;What&#39;cha \nneed Percy?&quot; Rodimus said to Perceptor, happy for the =\r\nmoment that it was \nPerceptor and Hydras giving orders and not Cyclonus and=\r\n his lap dog.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Cyclonus, seeing the break in the tension a=\r\nlso stepped back, pulling \nScourge back with him. &quot;There will be another ti=\r\nme Scourge.&quot; he said quietly, \n&quot;No need to fight this out here.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Scourge nodded, &quot;Yes, there \nwill be.&quot; he said darkly. His optics st=\r\nill watched Rodimus, his look almost \nhungry as he smiled evilly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; As the tensions between Cyclonus, \nScourge and Rodimus cooled Zarak=\r\n turned to look at Tuscon, wondering what \ninformation this bot could hold.=\r\n &quot;Come&quot; Zarak said to Darkhawk, &quot;Let&#39;s see what \nthis Auto . . . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *BEEP*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Zarak was caught in \nmid sentence by his s=\r\ncanner going off, the hand held one that he had been \nkeeping trained on Tu=\r\nscon. He glanced down at it, a curious look on his face. \nFor some reason i=\r\nt was registering a life sign where there had been none before. \nIt was loc=\r\nated somewhere near Tuscon&#39;s head.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Zarak stepped \nforward =\r\nto take a more careful scan . . .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (TAG)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nOOC: Yup, the same scanner he had been scanning him with a few posts \nago. =\r\nIt is still out and processing :) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n(Cyclo=\r\nnus/Scourge/&lt;WBR&gt;Rodimus/Zarak)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group ema=\r\nil --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0014_01CAB417.C6C30EC0--\r\n\n"}}
