The material was mostly scrap from the \npods that they had landed in, though some of it was functional. Two of the \nrobots stood guard while the others worked carefully.\n\nSeveral minutes passed before one of the robots jumped up with a triumphant \ncry. &quot;It works!&quot;\n\nThe others turned to him and looked at the device, which was now showing a \nbattle to the southeast. The biggest bot in the group smiled. &quot;Good job, \nRixer,&quot; he said to the other. Rixer smiled. He was the mechanic of the \ngroup, and could fix almost anything. The rest of the team consisted of \nBlyer, who was the areal fighter, Trattle, who transported the group around, \nForrior, who was the ground fighter, and Cledar, the commander of the group \nand the bot that had just spoken to Rixer. The five watched the scanners for \na while, and then it was decided to go investigate the battle. The scanners \ncouldn&#39;t report who was fighting, so they would have to see for themselves.\n\n&quot;Ok, let&#39;s go,&quot; Cledar said and looked to Trattle. The transporter \ntransformed into a large shuttle, and Cledar, Rixer, and Forrior climed in. \nTrattle took off and Blyer followed him in his jet mode. The five bots \nheaded for the battle they had picked up, the large Maximal symbols plainly \nvisible on the shuttle and the jet.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
