He could scarcelly make out three figures, two of them\ntrying to rip each other apart. He held out his gun, and blasted his\nsonic gun in the middle to split them up. &quot;Break it up.&quot; He grunted,\npointing his gun at the robot he didnt know. The robot recognized him,\nand stood up saluting. &quot;Pardon sir, unit Nightmare, requesting\nforgivness. I didnt know he was a friend of a Decepticon.&quot; Apeface\ngrunted, he didnt perticualarily like Quake, but he could be helpful.\nNightmare however would be great help. &quot;We will let you off Nightmare,\nif you join us.&quot; \n\nNightmare didnt move, he looked at Jagged. &quot;Only if he can come.&quot; as\nsaid, motioning to the broken form. &quot;Whatever, hurry.&quot; Apeface said,\nrunning out, and transforming into his jet mode, taking off. Quake\nfollowed, taking off the ground, grunting at the two punks. Nightmare\nwalked out solenmly. &quot;Well brother, looks like youll get your chance to\nserve the Decepticon empire.&quot; he said, transforming into a hover\nvehicle. Jagged got on, and they too took off.\n\n"}}
