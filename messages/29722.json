Perfect. \nThis was a very important discovery, one that he logged away into his data \nbanks.\nNue&#39;e looked edgy as she stood behind Perndabot, giving Biomass the look. \nThis could get ugly, and they were here to discover, not beat the crap out \nof them.\nShe reached up with a careful hand and moved to give a little tug on one of \nPerndabot&#39;s fingers to get his attention.*\n\n&quot; Um...excuse me?&quot;\n\n* Her voice was small, like her nature. She was very timmid and this was a \nbig step for her.*\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t mind him. He&#39;s always trying to show off infront of the ladies.&quot;\n\n* Her optics motioned from Perndabot to Swift, even though she was lying\nthrough her teeth. Biomass was doing this to see the personality of\nPerndabot so he could have something interesting to report.\nShe gives Biomass that look again, telling him to just go along with it.\nBiomass doesn&#39;t even aknowledge the look.*\n\n&quot; We&#39;ll see him now if he&#39;s not busy. Take us to him.&quot; he said, pushing his \nluck even further. He glances when he sees a movement in the corner of his \neye, noticing the autogun move towards them, looking back towards Perndabot \nwith an expression that said that he had seen the weapon and who it was\naiming at.\nBut Biomass also had a single sentance written in his expression as well, \nhis optics locked with Perndabots. &quot; Bring it on.&quot; And his look spoke true.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
