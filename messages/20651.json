His \nwrist comp beeps, the Iron Fist easily locating his cloaced \nsignature. The electricity dispensers powering up, the water around \nCybershark is filled with heavy shocks, energon nets moving around \nhim as well.\n\nZardus turns to Zergling as Demolition walks over to pick him up, \nHavoc launching off to follow Cybershark, locked on to his signature. \nAs soon as the bot left the sea, if the elecrticity and energon \ndidn&#39;t kill him....\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus frowns, walking up to Zergling. Cybershark had reprogrammed \nthe bot, that was obvious. He hears the bot&#39;s words before Zergling \nwent into stasis.\n\n&quot;No, not betray. Just fix,&quot; Zardus says to him, then looking at \nDemolition.\n\n&quot;Take him to the lab, my other self will know what to do.&quot;\n\nDemolition nods, walking off toward the Iron Fist.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dachande&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::CyberShark/Zergling::\n&gt; \n&gt;     CyberShark was hit by some blasts and turned to look at who was \nshooting.\n&gt;     &quot;Great,&quot; CyberShark said as he lifted Zergling in front of \nhim. &quot;Just great.&quot;\n&gt;     He threw Zergling who was still a little groggy. CyberShark \nthen turned toward the sea, running at full steam. He cloaked, he \ndidn&#39;t care anymore, guns were shooting at him, but after he cloaked \nthe guns couldn&#39;t find him. He jumped into the sea and started to \nswim deeped, transforming to Beast Mode as he did.\n&gt;     He turned on his propellor (A tail that splits into four \nblades) and took off under the water, toward somewhere that he might \nbe safe.\n\n\n"}}
