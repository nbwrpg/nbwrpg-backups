I will now \ntell my history here, for those who don&#39;t know me as well as others.  One \nday, a year and a half ago, i was on Ben Yee&#39;s message board.  I came across \na post talking about Neo beast Wars RPG.  I had been looking to join an RPG, \nbut none of them interested me, until NBW.  When i joined, it was just a \nmailing list.  Every day, people sent posts of the current list of members.  \nEventually, we became part of egroups (now Yahoogroups), and were able to \ngain a much larger amount of members.  When i joined, the council was \nYanshosh, Kslawdogg, JP3884, and Inferno371.  Soulstice was there too, then \nbeing called &quot;code,&quot; much to his disliking.  The Maximals were led by Liono \nPrime, the Predacons by Hellbeast.  The Alliance was there, but it was far \nsmaller.  And so i began my long involvement.  I saw the tide turn both ways \nin the war, and small custom factions spring up and then disapear.  I saw my \nfair share of idiots (ahh Icedemon), but there were also some great posters.  \nThere was Dachande who started the Destrons, Logo, who had the hottest female \ncharacters ever, my good friend shomin, with his psycho religiousness, \ncarnagedarkness, with (his/her? not sure) long, thinky posts with Dinobot, \nand many others.  And let&#39;s not forget Minime_316, this RPG&#39;s only tragedy.  \nFor those of you who don&#39;t know, Minime overdosed himself with pills.  To \nmake matters worse, that bastard JP beleived that the tragic email by his \nbrother was fake.  Oh, and KSL, im not angry that your characters murdered \nSoundwave, don&#39;t worry about it.  For those that didn&#39;t like me, well then \ngood for you, but for my friends here, feel free to talk to me whenever you \nwant.
