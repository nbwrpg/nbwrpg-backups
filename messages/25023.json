Just had a lot of really good ideas! ^..^\n\n\n\n* He was at the end of the chains which bound him to a wall, straining \nagainst them and putting as much strength into his back and legs to try and \nbreak them.\nThere was something in the sir which was warning him, something that smelled \nlike something bad was going to happen! And the more time went by the \nstronger that sense got.\nThe shackles around his wrists were biting deeply into the skin that was \nunder the gray and white fur which covered his entire body, the one around \nhis thickly furred neck choking slightly but unable to do any real damage \nthrough the hair.\nHis claws bit deeply into the metal floor and left scratched, scaring the \nsmooth surface. He growled and panted as he strained, his pawed hands \nclenched into fists.\nHis senses were going wild! They kept screaming at him to get away, just to \nleave this ship and run away as far as he could. Leave everything behind.\n\tA woman dressed in a white coat walked up to the alloyed door which was the \nonly way out of his cell, a notepad in her hand and pencil tucked behind her \near. She looked into the room through a thickly glassed window crossed with \nlittle wires, looking at him as he kept on working on the binds which held \nhim.\nBut he knew this woman, and unlike the other people who would just as easily \nstrap him to a table like so many times before, she was kind and gentle. \nAlways talking to him whenever she happened to pass his way.\nShe was the one that wrote down his actions when they were doing projects on \nhim, watching too see what his reactions would be to them. But he could tell \nthat she didn�t like the job.\n\tHis head lifted and he looked at her, leaning out at the very limit of the \nchains and putting all of his weight into pulling. He could tell that she \nwas concerned, because even though the alloyed door he could smell her.\nHis ears laid back flat against his head and he whined.\n\tThe woman sighed and leaned against the door, looking at him.* � You really \ndon�t like it in there, do you, D?�\n* He whined in response and pulled harder on the chains. He understood her \nwords and could even form a few of them, but other then that his language \nwas mainly based on howls and barks, growls and snarls.\nThey had made them, those people in the white coats. With wires and bones, \nmuscle and metal.\nThey had created a jeen which could combine organic with machine and they \nhad injected that into a living creature, and after painstaking work and \ntime HE was finally produced. Just what they had hoped.\nHe could walk on two legs and could walk on four, had a large mental \ncapacity and could learn easily and quickly. But he also had the strength of \na machine, his bones flecked with metal that made them harder to break. Just \nlike his muscles that were flecked too, and his mind. It was incredible!\nHe could store away images and then get them to come up on his vision \nwhenever he wanted them to! Even he was impressed with that!\n\tBut today, there was just something that was going to happen, maybe \nsomething that was going to go really wrong. He felt it, and he didn�t like \nit one bit!\nHe whined again as the ship seemed to tilt a little, making the woman \noutside of his door hang onto the handle to keep her balance. The pad in her \narms slipped and skittered down the hall.*\n� Whoa!�\n* He growled and shook, the chains rattling. The ship seemed to settle down \nand the woman patted at her hair to settle the strands which had escaped the \npins in it. She smiled through the window at him.*\n\n� Life�s full of surprises, huh?�\n\n* She then left the window where he could see her and disappeared, leaving \nhim to strain and fight the bonds which held him to a ship of danger.\nThe ship tilted and shook again, words blasting over a speaker system in the \nhalls.*\n\n� WARNING! SubGama has slipped into the mainstream of a  class D rift, all \npersonnel please prepare for turbulence!�\n\n* He shook again.\nRift! What was that, was it something to do with space? With the lights \noutside the windows?! What was it? What was going on?!\nAll of a sudden everything begin to glow a bright white, making it too hard \nfor his eyes to adjust so he had to close them.\nAnd that was all he knew last, but there was so much going on outside that \nwent by un-noticed by him.\n\t The entire ships systems had gone offline and the ship was spit out of the \nrift, sent tumbling towards some blue and green planet that seemed the only \nsolid thing in the black void of space.\nIt wasn�t long before the ship entered the weird planets� atmosphere, \nbecoming a red and melting fireball which lit up the sky. Almost all life \nsupport on the ship had ceased to function, but his chamber was luckily \nsealed by the woman and was operating perfectly. Where she was left out with \nthe rest, to share their fate.\n\tThe large scientific vessel thundered towards a piece of land at a slant, \nthe whole thing shaking and losing large bits a pieces of armor only for \nthem to drop towards a battle by the sea that it flew over. ( alliance \nbattle, not the CF.)\nThe ship skittered over the water for a second as it loses velocity, hitting \nthe beach and sending up a huge wall of sand. The impact digging it�s front \ninto the land while the back was lifted up, the weight of the back imploding \nit into the middle for a moment, hulls breaking in half before the ship \nrocked so that it was standing straight up into the air for a split second \nbefore toppling over. The broken back half of the ship was still carrying \nout the velocity of the impact and was sent sliding into a new forest, \nplowing trees and anything else in it�s way before finally coming to  \nshattered stop in pieces.\nChemical tanks had burst on impact and soon caught fire from the sparking \nwires of the ships systems, large explosions occurring in both halves of the \nvessel. Burning each piece to the ground, leaving nothing but charred metal \nand ash. The occasional burning body of one of the White Coats littering the \nground.\n\tHowever, there was also one body that lay across the ground which was not \nburning, instead limp as from the first second he had gone unconscious. No \nbroken bones and breathing in shallow breaths he simply lay there, the \nshackles and chains still around his wrists and neck.\nHis chamber had been ripped from the ship as it broke in half, carrying it \nalong with the back half until it had stopped and he was thrown through the \nwall and a bit into the forest.\nWhere he lay still, unmoving and unbeaten.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
