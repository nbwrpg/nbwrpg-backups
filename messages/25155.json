Oh, \nIR, Hysteria is loyal to Kluster, and I don&#39;t think she&#39;d ever met IR, so it \nwould probably help if she got a direct order from Kluster to escort the \nAlliance &#39;bots out. She is currently the only Maximal in the CF^_^ Oh, \nHotmail said my e-mails might be delayed, just so everybody knows:P)\n\nHysteria/Tavatron\n\nHysteria:\n\nThe shields buckled and finally failed under the strain of numerous weapons \nfire. Several missles struck the side of the damaged ship, leaving broken \narmor and charred metal in their wake. The EMP cannon sparked ocassionally \nfrom the numerous blasts it recieved, and appeared to be offline.\n\nTHe bridge doors buckled and groaned slightly from the barrage of close \nrange weapons fire. Two autoguns targetted the missles fired within the ship \ntoward the shields and fired. The main doorway still seemed to be weakening, \nbut if the threat was blasted it might explode.\n\nHysteria was still despretly trying to reroute engine power when she \nrecieved IR&#39;s message. Apparently her comm wasn&#39;t as damaged as she had \nthought. She returned IR&#39;s message with a comm of her own:\n\n&quot;I hope I&#39;m not out of line, but are you sure these &#39;bots can be trusted? \nAnd what does commander Kluster have to say about this, if you don&#39;t mind my \nasking.&quot;\n\nShe didn&#39;t know how much of her message would be recieved, but she did knoe \nshe&#39;d better get a response soon. She was ready to attempt powering up what \nreaminsed of the outer defenses and reactivating the shields if possible, \nall she needed was a few more clicks and she&#39;d be done. However, if IR&#39;s \ncommand was carried through, she would disengage the autoguns and escort the \n&#39;bots out of the base herself.\n\n*****\n\nTavatron:\n\nTavatron attempted to dodge Reflector&#39;s shots, but caught two in the right \nshoulder and one grazed her left side. She was about to return fire of her \nown, but recieved IR&#39;s message just moments before firing. She lowered her \nstaff, but still held it in a fighting position before her. Something about \nthis didn&#39;t seem right. She kept her eyes locked on Reflector, just in case.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
