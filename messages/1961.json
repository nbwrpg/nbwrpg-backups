Besides, if he wanted to carry Zenyak alone then she would let him.*\n\n&quot; Alright.&quot;\n\n\n*She soon began to follow Prowl towards the Maximal ship and then caught up to him, she looked around at the surrounding trees and shrubs. A second sigh escaped her lips. As she passed a pussy willow bush she pulled a off a small branch of the soft plants and then looked at it, with a tentative hand she brushed a figure lightly over the soft fuzz of the plant. It was SO soft!\nIron Raptor smiled a little at the feel of the objects in her grasp, nature could be wonderful and mysterious at the same time.\nShe looked up for a moment to avoid a stump but then looked back towards the plant when she had passed it safely, there were never plants such as these back on Sirose! She wondered why but then thought that this entire planet was different yet similar to her home world, bother were lush and covered with plants and animals but her planet was slightly different.\nAs this world had a regular day and night her&#39;s did not, there was never such a thing as true day on Sirose...just a dusk and then night. It was guessed by her that it was because Sirose was so far from the sun that it was never truly day there.\nIron Raptor then looked over at Prowl, she wondered where he had come from. Perhaps Cybertron like the others?\nShe was about to ask him but then decided not to, why would he answer such a stupid question like that when they needed to get the enemy back to base?\nIron Raptor shook her head at herself, dumb question, wrong time. She knew that she knew better then that!\nShe looked up at the sky and then back at the forest all around her, a strange yet beautiful planet had it&#39;s ups and downs.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
