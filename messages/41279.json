DevilDuer gets out of his chair, seeing Coput in stasis lock.\n\n&quot;This is all your fault,&quot; he blaims the bot as he grabs him, taking out a pistol and shooting the shuttle&#39;s window out, then jumping out of it with Coput, the two bots flying down toward the side of the Iron Fist.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGawd-bot smashes into the side of the Iron Fist, bouncing off and smashing into the ground. He jumps up. &quot;Oh yeah! Did you see what the immortal just did!&quot;\n\nGawd-bot glances up at the shuttle, his smile dissapearing. &quot;Uh oh...&quot; he says as the shuttle scrapes the side of the Iron Fist, a loud screeching sound originating from it before the shuttle passes and falls into the ocean.\n\n\n"}}
