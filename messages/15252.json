And you gotta\n&gt; settle down. This isn&#39;t permanent. It&#39;s just until KitKat gets\n&gt; repaired and we confront that bastard Megatron.&quot; Starscream looked\n&gt; around and gave a speech.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Now, I know I&#39;m not in command, but I&#39;ve got something to say. We\n&gt; all know where Meagtron is. Off somewhere with the other Preds,\n&gt; trying to unify all of us into a super group. He&#39;s been spending all\n&gt; his time with the others, while his loyal subjets he abandoned! He\n&gt; ran away, and left us to die by the hands of the Maximals! Going with\n&gt; Tarantulas will only play right into Megatron&#39;s hands, as if we\n&gt; forget him not fighting with us. So Phobia, this is your choice, but\n&gt; I plead with you. Take the Alliance help. Let us all turn our backs\n&gt; against Megatron. What has he got us? A blown up base. A destroyed\n&gt; spaceship. KitKat near death! Let us make our own base. Make an\n&gt; Alliance, with the Alliance. Beat Megatron to pods. Strenghten\n&gt; ourselves under KitKat, and never forgive him for what he has done!\n&gt; We have been fighting amongst ourselves. Four of us have already\n&gt; abandoned the group! If we go back to him, he&#39;ll take it as a sign\n&gt; that we don&#39;t care, and make us the low ranks. For the sake of all of\n&gt; us, let us go with the Alliance.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
