The Brotherhood already\n&gt; retreated back towards their base.  They&#39;re not close enough to fire upon\n&gt; targets or be fired upon themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; The fact of the matter, Icedemon, is Rattrap fired two shots at incoming\n&gt; missiles, then twenty-five shots at Unicron, all in the same post.  That&#39;s\na\n&gt; mode.  If he had two guns that&#39;s ok.  As for Unicron firing three\nmissiles,\n&gt; he has two weapons that can fire missiles making able to fire a max. of\nfour\n&gt; missiles.)\n&gt;\n&gt; (In other news three cheers for the Great One, THE ROCK, for beating down\n&gt; Kurt Angle and become the first six time WWF championship winner in WWF\n&gt; history!)\n&gt;\n&gt; Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark Claw/The Protectobots&#92;Shockwave:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Demon Wulf, though big, was able to fall to his left, the incoming shots\n&gt; coming from Cinder and Blades go past him and head for the missiles, the\none\n&gt; remaining impacting with his back and almost knocking him over, but he was\n&gt; relatively ok.\n&gt;\n&gt; Turning around, he raised a hand, a yellow orb with the power of a small\n&gt; grenade launching out at Endbringer.\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Flesh Ripper turned around, a black orb forming in his hand.  The Vok\nwarrior\n&gt; threw the ball of energy, using his mind to prematurely make it explode\nand\n&gt; intercept the four missiles heading for him.  He laughed, feeling several\n&gt; objects strike him but not doing any harm.  He turned, laughing at the\nspears\n&gt; at his feet.  &quot;You&#39;ll have to do better than that he said,&quot; kicking at the\n&gt; spears and sending two through the air at Aqua&#39;s sternum.  Turning his\nhead\n&gt; to the left he fired off fifteen rapid optic blasts at EndBringer.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark Claw detected a large object heading for him.  His first thought was\nit\n&gt; was some huge missile, but he detected the signature of a Maximal.\nDeciding\n&gt; not to wait to find out what it was exactly, he started up his engines and\n&gt; drove forward at top speed, a missile striking him (From Jen&#39;s char.) and\n&gt; making a slight crater in his armor but nothing to serious.  One missile\nport\n&gt; in his attack vehicle mode targeted the CF and launched two missiles at\nit.\n&gt;\n&gt; As he continued on a welding laser struck him but didn&#39;t penetrate his\narmor.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Hot Spot drove at top speed, at the current speed he knew he&#39;d hit that\nVok\n&gt; idiot.  But the Vok warrior was moving, and was now out of his way!\nAlmost\n&gt; absentmindedly while checking in on the other Protectobots, drove into\nthree\n&gt; missiles intended for Dark Wolf.\n&gt;\n&gt; The fourth and last in the row intended for the Vok war machine had\navoided\n&gt; the large object in its path and kept on going.  The force of the three\n&gt; explosions sent the fire truck flipping in Dark Wolf&#39;s general direction,\nand\n&gt; as the missile struck the back of the Vok and doing slight damage, Hot\nSpot\n&gt; slammed into the back of the tank, knocking it forward a few meters.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hot Spot tried to transform to biped mode but it was to painful.  This was\n&gt; not his week.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Groove looked to Hot Spot as he saw the crash and Flesh Ripper, and then\n&gt; fired a small amount of freezing gass towards Flesh Ripper&#39;s left knee\njoint.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Blades flew over towards Hot Spot and hovered above him, making deep scans\nto\n&gt; determine if his leader needed a CR immediately.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; First Aid saw that his welding laser didn&#39;t work, but didn&#39;t have much\ntime\n&gt; to think on it as a missile exploded into his back from a very close\nrange,\n&gt; sending First Aid flipping forward and crashing to his feet several feet\nfrom\n&gt; the source of the missile.\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Streetwise continued gaining speed, and was only a dozen meters from Demon\n&gt; Wulf, and the Vok hadn&#39;t noticed him.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Shockwave watched with joy as First Aid fell.  Not quite turning around,\nhe\n&gt; raised his left arm and fired off five rapid blasts, from the long barrel\n&gt; that was at the end of his arm where a hand should be, at Mantle&#39;s torso.\n&gt;\n&gt; Raising his right arm in which a white hand held a missile launcher, the\n&gt; robot fired off two rockets from his missile launcher at the Cybertronian\n&gt; Fire.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
