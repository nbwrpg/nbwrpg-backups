It had been pretty stupid \nto crash into that branch.. And to try to transform afterwords, too. \nBut he had been a bit dazed.\n\nProwl narrows his eyes. He would be more careful in the future.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m fine, let&#39;s hurry. This could be important,&quot; he says to Iron \nRaptor, his repair systems working.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike&#39;s eyes travel over Desmonus&#39; body as she stretches, \nReptilica&#39;s doing the same thing as the bot stands up. Bloodystrike \nnods.\n\n&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; he says, glancing at Reptilica with an annoyed look \non his face as the other says that he&#39;s fine too.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m BloodyStrike,&quot; BloodyStrike says to Desmonus, stretching out his \nhand for a hand shake.\n\n&quot;Name&#39;s Reptilica,&quot; Reptilica quickly adds after BloodyStrike, pushing \nhis friend&#39;s hand out of the way and offering his own. Bloodystrike \ngrowls.\n\n&quot;Reptilica has cleaning duty though, in the... Er... The CR chambers. \nHe has to leave now.&quot;\n\nReptilica shakes his head, narrowing his eyes at BloodyStrike, &quot;I \ndon&#39;t have cleaning duty! And the CRs arn&#39;t connected to this section, \nyou idiot.&quot;\n\nReptilica and BloodyStrike were two of the few bots who knew the \nAlliance base inside and out, other than Zardus. They had helped build \nit, and had supplied many of the materials from their own base.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; IR:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor watched as prowl transformed, but knew that it was \nuseless. \n&gt; His wing was bronken and as disoriented as Prowl was, he should have \nat \n&gt; least known that.\n&gt; She simply stands there and watches him transform back into robot \nmode, \n&gt; simply shaking her head and stepping a bit closer as he falls to his \nknees, \n&gt; lowering her head sne nudging him with her snout.\n&gt; Prowl wasn&#39;t looking well and she knew that he would be a while to \nrepair, \n&gt; but by the time they got to the Ark he should be fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; But she stands still while Prowl gets up and climbs up on her back, \nshifting \n&gt; her body to get use to the new weight. It wasn&#39;t much and it \nwouldn&#39;t slow \n&gt; her down, not a problem.\n&gt; Iron Raptor then beginst to move out of the forst and towards the \nplain \n&gt; again, taking the long way to the Ark.\n&gt; She would walk a bit while Prowl repaired a bit, making sure not to \njar him \n&gt; into pain or anything.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Now, Get repaired.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Desmonus:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Desmonus coughed a bit as she sat up, the strike against the wall \nnot \n&gt; really being what she would call the perfect ride.\n&gt; She flapped her wings a few times to settle them before she got to \nher feet, \n&gt; steadying herself against the wall as the base stablized.\n&gt; Brushing herself off she hardly noticed as BloodyStrike got to his \nfeet and \n&gt; looked her over, stretching a bit to work out the kinks in her \nstressed \n&gt; gears.\n&gt; This day was getting worse every moment.\n&gt; First starvation and now a head on colision with a pair of bots.\n&gt; Perfect.\n&gt; Desmonus looks up  in a bit of surprise as she hears BloodyStrike \nspeak, \n&gt; looking him over a bit and straightening her stance.\n&gt; Her amber optics narrowed before her senses cought the small of his \nmech \n&gt; fluid.\n&gt; She remembered that scent...but from where.\n&gt; Desmonus relaxed a bit as she stood against the \n\n\n"}}
