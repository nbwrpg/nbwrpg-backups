The Fuzor made a \nstrangled sound in the back of her throat, and when Carnage let go, \nso she scrambled backwards, getting as far away as possible. Or, \nuntil her back hit a tree trunk.\n\n&quot;Gods! I was only joking!&quot; She protested, her voice now slightly \nhoarse. She winced and rubbed her throat. Sheesh. &quot;Okay, Okay, I&#39;ll \ngo get the damn boulder..&quot;\n\nTeltoli stood up rather quickly, and took another glance at Carnage, \nthinking this had to be part of the training. Thinking back to the \nwords that Carnage had said when she was lucky she wasn&#39;t some Pred \nCommander, but a friend. &quot;Some friend..&quot; She muttered quietly to \nherself, so nobody else would hear. She felt strangely.. betrayed. \n\nSetting off into the air again, she was pleased to have some time to \nthink and be alone while she flew. Gosh, if Carnage was going to be \nthat rough, maybe she shouldn&#39;t have.. no! She was going to stick \nthrough the training, and she wasn&#39;t going to be a whinging brat! If \nshe wasn&#39;t to question orders, then she wouldn&#39;t question them. \n\n&quot;SilverWing&#39;s may be damn stubborn, but they always get the job \ndone!&quot;, That&#39;s what her Father had always said, and she was going to \nfollow that little gem of advice.\n\nAfter giving herself a mental sort out, she powered towards the swamp \nagain.\n\n&#39;Now, to find another boulder!&#39; She thought to herself, and used her \nscanners to find one. After a half minute, she was rather \ndissapointed she could find one the proper size. Looking towards the \nbog, she scanned in there.. and found one! Completely submerged, but \nit seemed the right size, and was the perfect shape. Teltoli smiled, \nand hunted out some vines again. \n\nKeeping her scanners on, she took a deep breath and walked into the \nbog, sumberging and closing her eyes. Her scanners told her where \neverything was without the benefit of eyesight. Managing to tie one \nvine around it, she swam back up to the top and broke the surface, \ntaking a deep lungful of air before going under and tieing two more \nvines. This repeated several times before she had seven vines wrapped \naround it, and a nice loop at the end so she could carry it.\n\nTeltoli climbed out of the bog, noticing with slight disgust that she \nwas covered with bog gunk. But she hauled the boulder out, knowing \nslightly more of what she was doing. The Fuzor grinned with \nsatisfaction and began hauling it towards the swamp again.\n\nThis time when she emerged from the trees, she had a slightly guilty \nlook on her face, as if whether deciding to apologize or just keep it \nto herself..\n\n\n"}}
