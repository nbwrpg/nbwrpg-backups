His eyes travel back to lock onto Biomass&#39;s \nface, seeing the expression in his eyes. Perndabot growls. He would \nlove to slag this bot, but his Maximal roots were holding him back. \nDespite his Alliance programming, there were still some small \nleftovers from Maximal behavior.\n\n&quot;You are lucky that the femm is here,&quot; he says to Biomass, &quot;Or else \nI&#39;d be slagging you right now.&quot;\n\nPerndabot makes no move to walk toward the Iron Fist, instead looking \nat Biomass and waiting for his reaction.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Biomass smiles to himself; so this bot had an attetude after all. \nPerfect.\n&gt; This was a very important discovery, one that he logged away into \nhis data \n&gt; banks.\n&gt; Nue&#39;e looked edgy as she stood behind Perndabot, giving Biomass the \nlook. \n&gt; This could get ugly, and they were here to discover, not beat the \ncrap out \n&gt; of them.\n&gt; She reached up with a careful hand and moved to give a little tug \non one of \n&gt; Perndabot&#39;s fingers to get his attention.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Um...excuse me?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Her voice was small, like her nature. She was very timmid and \nthis was a \n&gt; big step for her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t mind him. He&#39;s always trying to show off infront of the \nladies.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Her optics motioned from Perndabot to Swift, even though she was \nlying \n&gt; through her teeth. Biomass was doing this to see the personality of \n&gt; Perndabot so he could have something interesting to report.\n&gt; She gives Biomass that look again, telling him to just go along \nwith it.\n&gt; Biomass doesn&#39;t even aknowledge the look.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We&#39;ll see him now if he&#39;s not busy. Take us to him.&quot; he said, \npushing his \n&gt; luck even further. He glances when he sees a movement in the corner \nof his \n&gt; eye, noticing the autogun move towards them, looking back towards \nPerndabot\n&gt; with an expression that said that he had seen the weapon and who it \nwas\n&gt; aiming at.\n&gt; But Biomass also had a single sentance written in his expression as \nwell, \n&gt; his optics locked with Perndabots. &quot; Bring it on.&quot; And his look \nspoke true.*\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
