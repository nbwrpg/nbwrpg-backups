Most of us are finding it harder and harder to try \nand get enough time in just to feed ourselves.&quot;\n\n* Iron looked down at the ground as she walked, then looking up as soon as \nshe was only 6ft away from the bots in the first row.*\n\n&quot; But there&#39;s no breaks from that strain yet, I&#39;m afraid.  We&#39;re getting \nweaker, losing our edge. Even that Alliance can kick our asses and that&#39;s \nbad.&quot;\n\n* She took a breath.*\n\n&quot; And I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s our fighting that needs working on because it&#39;s \nnot.  Even as Arkness Prime I&#39;d find myself with a challenge just going up \nagainst some of you.  It&#39;s our form, our coperation.\nWe need stratagy, and we need attack plans.  And I know it&#39;s MY fault for \nnot doing that to begin with.&quot;\n\n* She uncrossed her arms.*\n\n&quot; And now it&#39;s all of YOU who&#39;s paying for my poor leadership.  But I wanna \nmake it up to all of you.&quot;\n\n* Iron cleared her throat.*\n\n&quot; For the next few mega-cycles we&#39;re going to drill.  And I&#39;ll be drilling \nright along with you all.  After all, this is a war, not a vacation.  But \nwhile we ALL work our asses off I&#39;ll be getting something ready that I&#39;m \nsure you&#39;ll all enjoy.&quot;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
