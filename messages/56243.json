Seated on the bed, with his arm around her \nshoulders, they talk quietly.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s nice that you&#39;ve gotten your memory back,&quot; Flicker tells her.\n\n&quot;Yeah.  We used to sit on the hill over the monastery, and watch the \nsunset.  That was where you kissed me for the first time.&quot;\n\nFlicker nods.  The kiss in and of itself had been ill-advised, \nconsidering Phoenix had still been under her vows to the Sisterhood \nat the time.  But that was a long time ago, before tragedy had \nseperated them.  The pair were finally reunited not too long ago, but \ncircumstance, duty, and Phoenix&#39;s battle with amnesia had conspired \nto keep them from each other.  No longer.\n\nPhoenix nestles herself a little deeper into her love&#39;s embrace as \nthey share a passionate kiss.  All her tormented past, her nightmares \nfrom captivity, melt away into simple joy.\n\n\n"}}
