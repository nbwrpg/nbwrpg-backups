The top half of Firearm \nfights to remain conscious, flying toward the CF as fast as he could.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing the ground rapidly approaching, Prowl releases Menasor&#39;s neck \nwith his front legs. Instead, he grabs Iron Raptor, making sure that \nhe had a secure grip on her with his front legs (if this isn&#39;t ok \nwith you, Megan, then its void), he grabbed her with his back legs as \nwell, lifting off Menasor and using his large wings to fly away from \nthe bot.\n\n(Rdahl, can you wait for Megan to post if my actions were ok or not \nbefore posting with Menasor?)\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Sorry\n&gt; \n&gt; Menasor notices his target getting up and leaving, he stops his \nclimb into\n&gt; the air, and halts for a moment, 600 feet high in the air. He aims \nhis huge\n&gt; Cyclone gun at Firearm. The huge barrel of the blaster locks onto \nthe\n&gt; target, and fires a huge torent of energy. Then after his shot, \nMenasor\n&gt; plunges downwards, at a huge speed, heading straight for the \nground. I he\n&gt; cant rid himself of his opponents, he will crash them.\n\n\n"}}
