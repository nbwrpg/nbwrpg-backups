Its a bit hard to type and \nconcentrate while your brother is attacking you.\n\n::Prowl/Reptilica/Other Bots::\n\nReptilica doesn&#39;t move as Dinobot tenses up, knowing that any move for the \nreptile would be suicide. He growls as the other decloak, the rest of the \nAlliance members in the room shifting their weapons. He growls at Tavatron as \nhe hears her words.\n\n&quot;Silence, femm!&quot; he yells, pointing his gun at her. He sighs as Prowl&#39;s thumb \ntwitches dangeroustly over the button, lowering the gun.\n\nReptilica looks back at Prowl.\n\n&quot;Allright, Maximal,&quot; he says, &quot;Give it to me and you have my word that no \nharm will come to you.&quot;\n\nProwl shakes his head, now confident that he had the support of the other \nMaximals there. &quot;As I said before, I&#39;ll give it to you at the edge of the \nclearing.&quot;\n\nReptilica growls, turning around to look at the other Alliance members. &quot;Move \naside. They&#39;re coming through.&quot;\n\nThe others look at him blankly, surprised that he was actually letting the \nMaximals out.\n\n&quot;You heard me! MOVE IT!&quot; Reptilica bellows, losing his temper and aiming his \ngun at Pyro. Pyro growls, aiming his own gun at Reptilica along with the \nother Oblitercons. Reptilica growls, lowering his gun. &quot;Just move it.&quot;\n\nPyro growls again, he and the other Alliance bots backing off into the \nhallway.\n\n&quot;You guys come within ten feet of any of us, and the place blows,&quot; Prowl says \narragontly, walking forward. It wasn&#39;t like him to talk like that, but he had \nto act it to look serious about blowing them all to scrap. Reptilica and the \nothers back up as Prowl aproaches, careful not to get near him.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Prowl says to the other Maximals as he continues to walk forward, \ndangeroustly holding his thumb over the button.\n\n"}}
