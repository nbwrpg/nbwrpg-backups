Fallen trees, charred rock,\n&gt; burning bushes scattered the field. &quot;To think this is why I left\n&gt; cybertron. Well this and a few outstanding depts.&quot; he thought as his\n&gt; hoverboard floated across the wasteland. &quot;I must remember the reason\n&gt; I&#39;m here.&quot; he paused as if to remind himself &quot;Till all are one.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Foxfingers scanned the area and monitored the communications from the\n&gt; battle. The preds seemed pinned at the cave with the maximals moving\n&gt; in on all sides.

A very good way to\n&gt; make\n&gt; &gt; a first impression, and collect DNA at the same time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He changed course and flew toward the battle, hoverboard flying at\n&gt; &gt; top speed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
