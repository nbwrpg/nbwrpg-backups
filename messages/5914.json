As to the beast wars we shall see how long\n&gt; the Militrons will participate in that. If we stay we\n&gt; shall see just who we side with.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   Panzertron checked his ship&#39;s chrono, it wouldnt be\n&gt; long before the Alliance leader showed up, in fact he\n&gt; should be with in visual range of the Iron Fist if his\n&gt; calculations where correct.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot; Main battery crews to thier stations,&quot; Panzertron\n&gt; said,&quot; Set course two-seven-one, increase speed to\n&gt; maximium.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Gun crews to thier stations, speed 33 knots,&quot; one\n&gt; of the drones replied.\n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;I&#39;m going to demonstarte the main battery for\n&gt; you,&quot; Panzertron said. A small island came into view.\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t very big, oval shaped and low to the water\n&gt; except for a moutian on one end. It was very far away.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot; Bring us about, fifteen degress, prepare to fire\n&gt; starboard broadside,&quot; Panzertron ordered.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Perfectly the ship&#39;s bow swung one way and the main\n&gt; battery turrets swung the other, all eight of the\n&gt; plasma rifles aiming toward the island.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Select mountain as target,&quot; Panzertron said,&quot; You\n&gt; may fire when ready.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;    A short time later the eight plasma rifles\n&gt; thundered sending shearing red beams of energy\n&gt; slamming into the mountain. The mountain exploded into\n&gt; smoke, dust and debris and no longer exisisted.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &quot;They do more damage to ship&#39;s hulls then soild\n&gt; rock,&quot; Panzertron said,&quot; And can hit from quite away\n&gt; aways. The only problem is they take a few seconds to\n&gt; build up thier charge again after each discharge.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
