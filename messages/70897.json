Straight Shot, Kup, I want you to position yourselv=\r\nes\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; best you can. Kup, take robot mode, Straight Shot, cross bow =\r\nmode, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; program your trajectory settings to long range. Be sure to =\r\nconceal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yourselves amply. Night Shift, I&#39;ll need you to remain in veh=\r\nicle mode,\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a quick getaway. Rodimus, Quickstride, it has now co=\r\nme to my attention\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unless a diversion is executed, Rat Trap an=\r\nd Windlord may not make it\n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the fortress safely.
