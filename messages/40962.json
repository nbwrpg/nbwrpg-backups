It is an inane poll, and I wouldnt even vote on it to see the\nresults. First of all, it is demeaning to whoever may lose even though\nit means Jack SHIT. The truth of the matter is that the poll you created\nis a relative question. RPGing is the same thing as anything else, &quot;to\neach his own&quot;. Some people will like my long discriptive posts, while\nothers will find it boring and a waste of time. Others will like posts\nthat are short and sweet, to the point, while the rest will feel they\nhave no substance. It really dosent matter. Also, this rpg is only as\ngood as it&#39;s worse player, so we are all affected by a bad post,\ntherefor should all be striving to get better. Tankor, please stop\nmaking these dumb polls, somebodies feelings might get hurt if people\nactually vote, and I find it mosly insulting that you would even waste\nyour time to write the stupid thing, which serves no purpose but to\nbelittle others.\n\n"}}
