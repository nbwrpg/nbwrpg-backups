She was to hurt in the spark.  \nShe \n&gt; dissapointed herself and worse, dissapointed him.  She wished she \nhad \n&gt; been scrapped by the pred.  \n&gt; She spoke softly, &quot; I can&#39;t transform into my beast mode.  I \ndamaged \n&gt; a wing. I can&#39;t fly for a while. Go one without me. I&#39;ll make it \nback \n&gt; to the base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She really didn&#39;t want him to go. But at the same time, she was \nvery \n&gt; ashamed of herself and her actions.  Once again, her emotions got \nher \n&gt; in trouble.  And now she worried that she might loose a friend as a \n&gt; result.\n\n\n"}}
