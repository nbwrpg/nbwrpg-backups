Bob is funny. Oh, and I&#39;ve been submiting a bunch of mine\n&gt; but the only problem with having all of these bots is that it&#39;s\n&gt; probably going to be a while before I get bios for them.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 21, 2001 9:22 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Characters\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It might be good if everyone that hasn&#39;t submitted all of their\n&gt; &gt; character profiles makes sure that they have SOMETHING up there for\n&gt; &gt; people to use as reference.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I suggest that if you don&#39;t have enough time to write the complete\n&gt; &gt; profile, then at least create a profile with your chars name, sex,\n&gt; &gt; faction, modes, a brief paragraph on what your bot looks like, a\n&gt; &gt; weapons array, and finally (optional) a short overview of your\n&gt; &gt; character&#39;s personality.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll include a short example with a fake bot (it will be obvious):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                            BOB\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Name: Bob\n&gt; &gt; Sex: Male\n&gt; &gt; Faction: Bob&#39;s Team\n&gt; &gt; Alternate Mode(s): Circus Clown\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Description:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bob, in robot mode, has a red torso, blue legs, white pelvis, and\n&gt; &gt; arms, and a red head. His eyes are blue, and he wears a small mask\n&gt; &gt; over his mouth. Most of the time he hunches over, and honks a little\n&gt; &gt; red horn at people. He has a small yellow flower about two inches\n&gt; &gt; squared on the left side of his chest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bob has several weapons. He has a automatic pie launcher,\n&gt; &gt; capable of making an interesting slat in the face of any\n&gt; &gt; unsuspecting person. His small chest flower squirts acid up to 5\n&gt; &gt; meters. Bob frequently uses his fists to do mock battle with other\n&gt; &gt; clowns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bob is a very outgoing bot. He likes to bug and tease other bots\n&gt; &gt; that he knows, and doesn&#39;t know. This trait has often gotten him\n&gt; &gt; into trouble, and once it got him beat up. He was in the CR for\n&gt; &gt; three days.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The above was an example, and a quick one at that. =P\n&gt; &gt; That or less (without the personality section) would do nicely on\n&gt; &gt; the page. PLEASE make your short character bio&#39;s as soon as\n&gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 19 May 2001, at 22:12, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Okay, I think I can go over and submit some stuff, but I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t be able to get the bios done anytime soon, sadly...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
