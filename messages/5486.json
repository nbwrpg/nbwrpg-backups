First of all, this bot came out of no\n&gt; where.  Second, then two other bot show up tring to slag all three of us.\n&gt; then Quickstrike gets injured after putting up one hell of a fight.  It\nwas\n&gt; all Stringtra could do by dragging Quickstrike to safety.  And I did my\nbest\n&gt; to cover them.  But I ran out of ammo.  We barely made it here as it was.&quot;\n&gt; She just stood there in front of Megatron with no fear in her eyes.\n&gt; &quot;Now, let me introduce myself.  I am KitKat, pack member and council.
