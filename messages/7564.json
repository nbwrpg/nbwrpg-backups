The TM3 bot Vulois, still believed to be \ndead by most, has decided to become an active role again.\n\n&quot;It is time I call upon my three!(He starts sending a personal \nmessage):\n\nSoundwave, Battera and Cybershark. It is I, Vulois. I am not dead. \nInfact I am very much alive! I need your help for a new project which \nwill help bring peace. I know you might not want to come, that&#39;s what \nThe Matrix said, especially you Cybershark since you love battle, but \nthis is of grave importance. I will not tell you what it is about now \nbecause you may not want to join me. If you do, than home in on my \nsignal and come here. Soundwave, I have known you the longest and I \nknow that meeting you was not a coincidence. Battera, I know you feel \ngulty for letting Terminess and I die, but if that didn&#39;t happen, I \nwould never have been trusted with this mission. Please come, all of \nyou.&quot;\n\nVulois sits and waits.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nA strange creature has pulled in front of The Cybertronian Fire\n(That&#39;s the new base, right?) It stares at it for awhile and marveles \nat it. It turns out that this is no centaur, but the great Maximal \nwarrior Brix.\n\n&quot;Are you ready?&quot;\n\n&lt;i&gt;Of course. If I wasn&#39;t ready for what would come after I wouldn&#39;t \nhave helped you. Bronco is under control. Just keep your rage in \ncheck and you will be fine.&lt;/i&gt;\n\n&quot;Thank you, Octociz, for all you have done.&quot;\n\nBrix/Octociz begin their final run towards the ship.\n\n\n\n"}}
