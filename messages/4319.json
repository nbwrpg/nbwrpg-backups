Looking around, he saw a somewhat \n&gt;small\n&gt;missile heading for the Ark.  He watched as it hit the Ark and explopded\n&gt;against the orangish craft&#39;s hull.  Activating his com as he saw two more\n&gt;missile explosions up on a cliff somewhat surrounding the Ark, he took out\n&gt;his electro-distruptor rifle.  &lt;Maximals!  We are under attack!  Perimeter\n&gt;guards, converge on my energy signature!&gt; Smokescreen yelled into the com,\n&gt;running as fast as he could for the cliff where the Predacons and Cyber \n&gt;Claw\n&gt;were.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Beachcomber felt the explosion of Injector&#39;s missile, not very much though.\n&gt;But his suspicious were confirmed by Smokescreen&#39;s transmission.  Raising \n&gt;his\n&gt;rifle, he charged out of the armory, heading for Smokescreen&#39;s signature.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
