This means \nthat if the scans I asked are positive, we will raid one of the base. \nOur objective here is not to eradicate our enemy, only to pinpoint \ntheir position, if they are truly here. However, if I am right, there \nshould be two bases. We will divide our group and raid both bases at \nthe same time.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nAt the same time, inside the base, the stasis pod was scanning through \nthe ship&#39;s computer for a beast mode. After only a few nano-cycles, it \nhad found one.\n\nPod computer: DNA sequencing initialized. Merging with protoform. \nTechno-organic technology detected. (and after a few moments...) \nProtoform merged. Welcome, new tri...\n\nThe door of the pod flew in the air along with most of the \nelectronics. Tendrils protruded form there, always going higher and \nhigher. A cruel laugh emerged from the pod, but it was a quiet kind of \nlaugh, not a loud one. The kind that the truly mad ones make. The low \nvoice only enhanced the effect.\n\n???????: Hehehe... I feel like slagging someone for my birthday! Let&#39;s \njust see where the new major took the whole bunch of us. (He opened a \ngeneral Tripredacus frequency) I&#39;m Burrock. Requesting orders and \npermission to slag.\n\nTyrael was not caught by surprise, he was even pleased at the first \nwords of the bot. He responded.\n\nTyrael: I am Major Tyrael. Join me at the base&#39;s entrance. As for the \nother request... This will come soon enough.\n\nBurrock: You won&#39;t be disappointed, man. Beast mode!\n\nThen, a large worm came out of the pod and started moving, quite fast \nfor his beast mode. Covered with a circuited skin, he easily found his \nway around. Th weird one thought of all the massacres he would have \nthe joy to cause and smile inside.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Shadow Star took a lizard mode, then activated a\n&gt; stasis pod and went to see Tyreal.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Tyrael thought for a moment. Of course, establishing\n&gt; &gt; a perimeter was a \n&gt; &gt; priority, but making certain that they were at the\n&gt; &gt; right place was \n&gt; &gt; more important.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael: Cancel your present orders. We have to know\n&gt; &gt; where we are \n&gt; &gt; first. Shadow Star, activate a stasis pod as soon as\n&gt; &gt; you have taken a \n&gt; &gt; beast mode. Once you are done, come and see me. Naga\n&gt; &gt; and Talon, check \n&gt; &gt; the long range scanners for any thermal sources\n&gt; &gt; other than geological. \n&gt; &gt; Try to see if you detect any energy signatures.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: I&#39;ll take the new bot, and anyone else who is\n&gt; &gt; interested by a \n&gt; &gt; new char, just let me know.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\n&gt; http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n\n"}}
