She \ndodges, but not fast enough; the attack clips her, sending the tiny \ntransformer spinning wildly out of control.  She changes over to \nrobot mode, rolling to dissipate some of the force of the impact as \nshe crashes.\n\nShe eventually stops rolling some distance away and lays still.  It&#39;s \nunclear whether she&#39;s been knocked out or if she&#39;s faking it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;deltazero1&quot; &lt;DeltaZero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;well i&#39;m sure i can help with that&quot; spike said rolling past them \n&gt; from behind and transforming to robot mode he stared at Vlad &quot;your \nas \n&gt; strange as the other 2 lifeforms i saw&quot; he said looking over him \nfrom \n&gt; head to toe &quot;yup you got to be a new kind of transform&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Talon glided down a few feet from spike and landed &quot;glad to see u \n&gt; again spike to bad u got careless again&quot; he said before \ntransforming \n&gt; to beast mode and fired a large spreed of his blue flame attack \ninto \n&gt; the air trying to turn the clocked transformer into a over sizes \n&gt; icecube\n\n\n"}}
