However perhaps due to shadows and\nfalling dirt, perhaps it looked smaller than it truly was.\n\nThe trip back to the ARK was fairly quick, seeing as it was only a few\nmiles away, everyone seemed to be inside, WOLFGANG was the only one\nout and he was on patrol duty. The sound ot TUCSON&#39;s roar echoed over\nthe landscape.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
