We&#39;re\nallied with them with a treaty. The NewComers have retreated and now there\nis only the ALLIANCE LEFT. Hold your fire.&quot;\n\n* Suddenly there was a huge thud behind her but off to the distance and she\nturned her head and looked, her eyes grew big and her jaw nearly dropped\nopen as she saw the huge Alliance weapon heading towards the Ark. Her head\nthen suddenly snapped towards Shadow Cat. *\n\n&quot; Get inside the base, NOW! And whatever happens do NOT fire on that huge\nbot heading towards us! We are supposed to have a treaty with them but thanx\nto a big mistake we have obviously pissed them off.BIG TIME! Now go! I&#39;ll\nhelp deal with this!&quot;\n\n* With that Iron Raptor then moved off towards Oblitertron, her steps a bit\nshaky but keeping her massive body above ground.her tail dragging. It wasn&#39;t\nlong before she suddenly came within 2 hundred meters of the huge robot and\nstopped, her head tilted a bit back so that she could look at the joined\nAlliance members. Her voice was a bit shaky as she then spoke but it was\nvery clear, the loss of mech fluid causing her voice too faultier. She then\nopens her com-link to all Maximal fequencies.*\n\n&quot; Attention Maximals, do NOT fire upon the approaching bot. We are with\ntreaty with the Alliance and we shall not fire. Those who do shall answer to\nme!&quot;\n\n* She then switches her com-link over to the Alliance members in which\nformed Oblitertron.*\n\n&quot; Attention, Dark One, Breakdown, Pyro, Hiss and Scavenger, it had obviously\ncome to light that us Maximals had made a mistake! We were not aware of the\ntreaty and for that we were blind to you.good intentions. I request that we\ndiscuss this like civilized bots and stop this violence.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then looked down at the ground, her systems faltering her not\nbeing able to maintain her Second Beast Mode. With a sigh she quickly\ntransformed into her robot mode, the gash on her side still there as she\nthen stood up straight to meet the glare of the huge bot. Her systems were\nnearly shaking with fright and the need to run as she saw the robot continue\ntowards the base and thus her position, but she then swallowed that fear and\nstood proud. *\n\n&quot; But, if you have to take out your anger on somebot then take it out on me!\nI&#39;m the one that shot you.or one of you. And it was a mistake, but if\nsomebot has to pay for that mistake and all of the others that had fired on\nyou then I&#39;ll pay! You have anger towards a mistake that I was a part of so\nstop firing on others and make the same mistake that I did.and fire on me.\nThe one whom deserves it!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor waited for Oblitertron to turn it&#39;s gun towards her and pull\nthe trigger, she was ready to die for her mistake.taking responsibility for\nher actions that she knew that she was guilty of. She would parish to save\nher Maximals from doom from a huge threat and she was proud to do so, if her\ndeath caused the bot to be satisfied then she would die. However, she braced\nherself for the impact of the blow, if she was going to die then she was\ngoing to be ready! *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\naddress on the Net!\nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
