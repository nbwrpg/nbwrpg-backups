It was the same tunnel that Perceptor, Tuscon abd\n&gt; the other Maximals had taken during their escape.\n&gt;\n&gt; The tunnel was much as they had seen it. The approximately 10 feet\n&gt; wide with a little variance here and there. As Hydras moves further\n&gt; into the tunnels the light quickly disappears, the only light comming\n&gt; from whatever light Hydras or one of the others turns on. There walls\n&gt; are generally smooth, although there are a few marks along the walls\n&gt; as if something large and heavy had been through here recently. On the\n&gt; floor are the tire prints of a large vehicle that had evidently\n&gt; traveled down the path. From the size of the prints the vehicle was\n&gt; almost as wide as the tunnel itself, leaving only a foot or two\n&gt; clearance on each side. That vehicle must have had an excellent\n&gt; driver.\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras traveled he got to one point where he can see the obvious\n&gt; sings of battle, and then he sees another, this one filled with far\n&gt; more firepower than the first.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally as Hydas continued his push foward, floowed still by Iguanus,\n&gt; Inferno and Fractyl, he can see up ahead the signs of a fire fight.\n&gt; Lights flash from up ahead, and the sounds of battle can be heard.\n&gt; Cyclonus&#39; signal is clearly in the midst of it, as well as those of\n&gt; Insecticon and Bruticus-X. Also, in the battle with Cyclonus, Hydras\n&gt; can pick up reading of some sort of strange almost alien type of\n&gt; creature, and the odd thing is that the signature has bits of Autobot\n&gt; elements in it as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; So far Deepstryke, Phobia and Nightrazor have not arrives as they are\n&gt; still somewhat further back down the tunnel behind Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
