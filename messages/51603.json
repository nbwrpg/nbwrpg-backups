After you&#39;ve done that, log\n&gt; in, and send me a \n&gt;     confirmation email to show that you&#39;ve signed\n&gt; up. After that, I&#39;ll \n&gt;     give you further training, and instructions.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;     That was post number 51315. You can go read it\n&gt; yourself if you like, \n&gt;     but regardless, you must do what I&#39;ve asked you\n&gt; to do. I don&#39;t know \n&gt;     for sure if you&#39;ve gotten any of the emails I&#39;ve\n&gt; sent you, but if \n&gt;     you haven&#39;t I really hope you get this one,\n&gt; cause otherwise one of \n&gt;     the moderators will be forced to moderate you\n&gt; until you start to \n&gt;     listen...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Eric Bischoff&quot;\n&gt; &lt;1641coburn@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;     &gt; OOC:  ELLEN RIVERS!
