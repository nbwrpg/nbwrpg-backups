She mentally scolded herself for doing so. She&#39;d learned to keep herself \nquiet near other bots. The only time she raised to voice that high was when \nshe was giving Megatron a piece of her mind. That exactly was one reason she \nwound up in the forest, hunted.\n\nShe watched Dinobot carefully, making sure he didn&#39;t escape from her sight. \nShe folded her arms and said gruffly, &quot;Tell me a little bit more about \nMegatron&#39;s situations. It seems to me times has definately changed. I have \nbeen on the run most of my life and I loose track of these things.&quot;\n\nIt was odd to her. Over many months, or many years (she lost track of the \ntime) Megatron had stopped sending his fliers after her, and the hunts had \nceased. Day after day, she had wondered when the hunts would resume and \nMegatron would try to blow her head off because of her treachery. She knew \nhe didn&#39;t take kindly to traitors, but that was she chance she took. She \ncouldn&#39;t stand him no longer.\n\nShe watched--almost waiting for him to turn his head from her and go about \nhis business, ignoring the sorry looking clone that was herself. Sometime \nDinobot was a heartless slag, but so was she. Perhaps she was even colder. \nShe would leave a wounded bot even if he had a chance, while Maximals had \ntheir morals and limits.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
