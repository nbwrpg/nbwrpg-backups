He and Nemesis had flown to \nthem from the alliance base. Flying in closer, he lands near them.\n\n&quot;Greetings,&quot; He says, &quot;I am Zardus, leader of the alliance.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl walks into the bridge. He was a mess. One of his wings was snapped out \nof it&#39;s socket and his leg was shredded. There were scraches and gashes all \nover his chest, stomach, and back, and one of his optics was cacked down the \nmiddle.\n\n&quot;The predacons are retreating,&quot; He says to Iron Raptor, &quot;I think we should \nlet them do so. We all need repairs.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nShredder sighs. He had sent out a distress call but no predacons had come to \nhis rescue. He looks up again at DeathStorm&#39;s gun pointed at his head. \nWithout warning, he lashes out with his foot, attempting to trip DeathStorm.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMosquitor opens his eyes as he hears Rampage&#39;s order to fall back. He tries \nto stand up, but his body was too damaged to respond.\n\n&quot;Beast Mode!&quot; He says. He flies away in his mosquito form.\n\n"}}
