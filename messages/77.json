The fog had thickened to the point where her beast mode \noptics could barely see.\n\n&quot;Maximize!&quot; Tavatron whispered. She transformed, careful not to disturb her \nnewly laid trail. Tavatron switched to infer-red mode and did a quick scan \nof the area. (with her eyes, not her scanners. that would be cheating.)\n\nTavatron kneeled beside the stream as she began to calculate how fast she \nwould need to run in order to clear it. She backed up a few yards then began \nto run. She jumped over the stream, barely clearing it.\n\nShe stood on the other side a moment, catching her breath. *The things I do \nto lay a false trail. At least he won&#39;t be able to follow my scent over the \nriver.* She thought to herself. Tavatron sniffed the air twice, then let \nloose a wild hunting howl.\n\n*You&#39;re in my world now, let&#39;s see how long you last.*\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Carnage darkness&quot; &lt;carnage_blood@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Sat, 15 Apr 2000 11:10:38 PDT\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The moon was high and that gave off just enough light to see by as \n&gt;Dinobot\n&gt;made his way through the forest. He could hear wild animal calls such as\n&gt;elk, moose, squirel and even a bear, filter in through the trees.\n&gt;A light mist had developed among the massive tree trunks, almost making \n&gt;this\n&gt;event seem like out of a horror movie and Tavatron and himself were the\n&gt;stars! However, horror was Dinobot&#39;s middle name.\n&gt;He was still following Tavatron&#39;s sent through the trees but it was\n&gt;beginning to get old, which meant that she was gaining ground and was far\n&gt;ahead of him.\n&gt;Dinobot kept a watch out, not only for Predacons but also for female bots\n&gt;who decided to circle around and get the drop on him.\n&gt;He snarled when he noticed that Tavatron&#39;s sent had suddenly disappeared,\n&gt;now it was down to the basics in order to track her down.\n&gt;Dinobot looked around and saw a bent twig, he walked over and sniffed at \n&gt;it.\n&gt;Tavatron!\n&gt;Dinobot snarled deeply, she wouldn&#39;t leave such an obvious sign to her\n&gt;passing unless...she was toying with him! She was playing a game, the\n&gt;title... Track Me If You Can!\n&gt;Soon the clues would become harder to recognise and eventually disappear,\n&gt;this was probably part of their practice battle.\n&gt;Dinobot looked up slowly and grinned to himself, he could play this game\n&gt;too!*\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
