Muttering to himself \nhe sat down at one of the tables.  &quot;Your lucky we were  Autobots, \nol&#39;timer.  You would have been dead the way you rampaged in \nhere. I think your only alive now because of the mercy Pacifix has.  \nAnd my trust does not come as easily as his.  &quot; He said this more \nof a reassurance to himself then anything else.\n\n"}}
