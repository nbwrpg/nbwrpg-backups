Silver Scout knew that for some\nreason Kit Kat had stopped. caution told her to stay back in concealment but\ncuriosity got the best of her. Even though the hall was well lit the wolf\ncontinued forward. The mutant wolf used her masking ability to bend the\nlight around her. This wouldn&#39;t protect her from the other wolf but it would\nmake her invisable to the optics of any other bot who happened by.\n\n----------------------------\n\nBlackFortress&#39; allarm started to ring, an stranger had come in\nBlackFortress (Silverscout).\n\nSilver Scout jumped, startled by the sudden noise. She moved closer to the\nwall as a precaution that bots may be patrolling the halls. Having someone\ntrip on her was the last thing the mutant wanted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n::KitKat2::\n\nShe heard the alarms.\n&quot;Yes, back up on the way!&quot; She opens the door and heads to where the bot\nwould be.\n\n Kit Kats scent was once again moving. this time though it was getting\nstronger. The other wolf was circling until reinforcements arrived. Silver\nScout crouched low ready to pounce if the need arose.\n\nDoors began to close around her. It was obvious that she was being herded\ntowardthe reinforcements. She was close enough to the others to hear voices.\n&quot;So they think I&#39;m that easy to catch do they?&quot; She thought snickering at\nthier overconfidence, &quot;We&#39;ll just have to see about that.&quot; The wolf creapt\ncloser remaining silent. The only one Silver Scout had to worry about was\nKit Kat so the mutant decided that she&#39;d be the first target. After that the\nothers would be easy pickings.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, May 16, 2001 5:26 AM\nSubject: Re: KitKat2\n\n\n&gt; ::KitKat2::\n&gt;\n&gt; Now in the base she picked up a scent that was out of place.\n&gt; &quot;KitKat, terorrize.&quot;\n&gt; She transformed to bot mode, and pulled a plasma rifle.\n&gt; She waited for the bot to come near her room.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
