He=\r\n still could move swiftly and dexterously, thanks to his ninjabot training.=\r\n If ever a time where it was needed it was now. He looks around quickly and=\r\n notices that a formation of old metal debris lying on rubble resembles a t=\r\neeter toter lever. which he knew he could use as a vaulting platform. It wo=\r\nuld just take a second individual to step on the other end to send him upwa=\r\nrd for his maneuver. He points to it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; See that? It resembles a catapo=\r\nult lever. One individual stands on one end, while the other jumps on the o=\r\nther end to send the first individual airbourne. From there, I&#39;m sure I can=\r\n make it to the bed. It&#39;s an old Ninjabot trick I learned during training. =\r\nAnd if I play my cards right, it&#39;ll be a maneuver they don&#39;t see comming.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; With that he draws his sword, keeping an eye on the insects.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nVe=\r\nstige nodded as he glanced at the piece of metal that lay on the\nfloor and =\r\nthen back at Tuscon. The piece of metal was actually armor\nplating that had=\r\n been part of the wall before the fire fight had\nstarted. Now it lay discar=\r\nded on the floor, laying haphazardly on top\nof debris, ready for Tuscon and=\r\n Vestige&#39;s use.\n\n&quot;I see.&quot; Vestige said said, his optics clear and focused. =\r\nTurning he\nlaunched a few more shots on the approaching insectoids, thier a=\r\nrmor\nabsorbing the brunt of his attacks, but even now begining to burn and\n=\r\nscorch. However Vestige took the moment to get into position.\n\nThe insects =\r\napproach Tuscon warily, thier multifaceted optics looking\nat his sword, thi=\r\ner tail mounted cannons oriented on it and him.\n\n&quot;You cannot succeed Autobo=\r\nt!&quot; Says the voice of the insecoids, &quot;We are\nthe hoard, surrender now.&quot;\n\nTh=\r\ne insectoids quickly begin to close on Tuscon&#39;s position, thier\ncannons pep=\r\npering the area around him with firepower and explosive\nordanaces!\n\n(TAG)\n\n=\r\nPreston\n\n"}}
