I just wrote this fan fic that Zardus will put on the site\nafter I send it to him tomorrow. But I wanted to share it with everyone\nnow, since its the only fan fic that I ever finished.\nSo please read this fic. It isn&#39;t too long. And tell me what you think.\nThanks!\n\n\nTITLE: The Chosen One (or The Touch)\nAuthor: RoboRick007\nStyle: Action, Adventure\nStarted: January 10, 2001\nNOTE: This is a quick fic that stars Hot Rod as the hero. (What did ya\nexpect?)\n\n`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\n      Two days, six hours, three minutes, and 28 seconds. Thats how long\nthe battle had been waging. The Maximal base, the Cybertronian Fire, had\nbeen blasted untill it was a scortched hollow scrap of metal. Many of\nthe Maximals greatest fighters had fallen. Zardus made his big push and\nthe Maximals wern&#39;t ready.\n\n      Hot Rod ran through the woods, getting as far away from the base\nas he could.(I know the CF is in open plane, but its my story.) He\npassed lifeless body after lifeless body. He looked down at hsi fallen\nfriends. Prowl, Kluster, Iron Raptor, even Angel Prime had been slayed.\nThe Maximal Matrix layed beside his body, powerless.\n\n      Several shots wizzed by his head, bringing him from his thoughts.\nHe kept running, looking over his shoulder. He saw Najah come out from\nsome brush. He spun around, shooting his last missile at the snake bot.\nHe smiled as Najah joined the scrap heap.\n\n      &quot;Tastes like chicken,&quot; he says to himself, as he keeps running.\n\n      Hot Rod hadn&#39;t seen Feline, scince the battle began. He hoped she\nwas ok. Even though she was Alliance, he lover her.\n\n      After two hours of running in circles he found the terminated body\nof Liono Prime. Even this bot who had left, and had been rejected by the\nMaximals had come to help. He noticed an object all to familiar in the\nhands of Liono. It was the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.\n\n      He was startled by the voices of Unitron, and Firestarter coming\nhis way. He quickly grabbed the Matrix. The power surged through his\nbody. His cirquits were alive with the power of the ages. His weapons\nreturned to full power, and all damage was erased. Rodimus Prime was\nback!\n\n      Unitron and Firestarter emerged from the trees, only to see a lone\nTransformer rocketing towards them. Rodimus performed a double cloths\nline, decapitating both bots. Just then Demoliton flyes over in plane\nmode. Rodimus sends a missile up, destroying the bot.\n\n      &quot;That&#39;ll keep them out of commision for a wile. Now for Zardus.\nVehical mode!&quot;\n\n      Rodimus Prime transformed to his truck mode.(I&#39;m not going to call\nit a Winabego.)\n\n      A rumble was heard at the Cybertronian Fire. Zardus turned only to\nsee several Alliance bots fly through the air, as a Cybertronian truck\nemerged from the woods.\n\n      &quot;What the hell?!&quot; Zardus yells in shock.\n\n      &quot;Rodimus Prime, MAXIMIZE!&quot; Rodimus says, giving his activation\ncode.\n\n      He transformes to bot mode, and stands in front of Zardus. He\npoints streight at him.\n\n      &quot;This is the end of the road, Zardus!&quot;\n\n      He then runs at Zardus, giving a series of kicks and punches.\nZardus drops to the ground unable to contend with the ex-Autobot. He\nthen picks up the Alliance commander, and sends him soaring off into the\nhorizen.\n\n      Rodimus then holds the Matrix out infront of him, and opens it.\n\n      &quot;Now light our darkest hour!&quot;\n\n      The power of the Matrix is released, and the Cybertronian Fire and\nthe Maximals are revived to life, and repaired.\n\n      With the Autobot Matrix, Rodimus Prime continued to lead the\nMaximals to a new age of victory, as the Neo Beast Wars waged on,\nwithout the Alliance.(Ok so that last part is unlikely.)\n\n"}}
