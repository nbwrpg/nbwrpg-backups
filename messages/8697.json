She looked about.  It still \nlooked like a nicely decorated cell to her.  She felt caged. She got \nup and walked around the room for a bit.  She decided to get to know \nthese bots a bit better.  Who knows, it might prove a useful \nconnection to have in the future.  She went to the door, but it \ndidn&#39;t open. She looked around and saw the panel on the side of the \ndoor. &quot;Ok, if your head wasn&#39;t attached, you&#39;d have flown off and \nleft it long ago.&quot; She pressed the button and the doors opened.  She \nwalked down the hall and looked about.  She was hoping to run into \nChardate.  She had a few questions and was hoping to get some answers.\n\n\n"}}
