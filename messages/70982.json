The situation has definitely angered=\r\n him somewhat, and true to his bio, it would be interesting to see how the =\r\npreds and cons react to his seemingly critical temperament.  Unlike Rodimus=\r\n, he has a lower tolerance for nonsense, which has now got him to do someth=\r\ning no one would ever think he&#39;d do.  And that&#39;s to request that Legacy be =\r\ncast out of the Ark, ordered not to return.  But he could also be wrong abo=\r\nut Legacy, and not all beings are perfect in judgement.  He has given the o=\r\nrder to cast him out, leaving that to Stanton, Bump and Perceptor.  Then ag=\r\nain, his temperament could also concern his comrades a bit.  After all, to =\r\nthem he is rather new, exept to Rodimus of course.  So could Tucson Prime a=\r\nctually have a tiny bit of darkness in him?  Just a slight?  And when he re=\r\nscued Rodimus from darkness, could he have brought something back with him?=\r\n  And if so, being who he is, he tries hard to surpress what is happening t=\r\no him, but is that working?  Just something to throw out into the mix.\n\n---=\r\n In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; O=\r\nOC: Just to be clear, Legacy is in the same room as Perceptor, Santon, Bump=\r\n\n&gt; and Nightlight.
