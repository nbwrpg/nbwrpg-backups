Take heart, this is for the best,=\r\n and I know it will help Rodimus immensely.

A good friend always knows what his comrade is thinking, and no mat=\r\nter how saddened one is, he can always feel good that he has friends standi=\r\nng beside him. It&#39;s very good to know I have you and the others for support=\r\n. I should consider myself very lucky to be a part of a powerful merger of =\r\nfactions. Now, Rodimus&#39;s health is declining, and I have more than enough s=\r\npark to share. I think it is time that you allow me to attempt a form of en=\r\nergy transfusion.
