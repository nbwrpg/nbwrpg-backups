In mere moments the magma would finally fail to contain it&#39;s explosive energies. He had that precious little time to find some other shaft in the tunnel to Rodimus Prime or risk being ejected from the tunnel and have to find some other route. But near the boiling surface of the molten rock he spotted another shaft, running perpendicular to this one. He ducked into it, then trained his fusion cannon and beam rifle on the tunnel now below him and fired, dropping more rock and metal onto the magma and melt it to at least give him ime to move freely. He then turned and continued down the new shaft, scanning for Rodimus&#39; energy signature.\n\n\nHeya: \n\nJust making sure I understand. Megatron went into a side tunnel, near the surface of the swiftly rising Magma. He then fired at the tunnel he just left, throwing debris into the magma to slow it? Is he sealing the tunnel he is in as well?\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
