I just came to \nsay I&#39;m leaving. I&#39;m going to Cybertron. I&#39;m passing the mission down \nto The Keepers. If you want, they will comfort you with open arms. \nBut you don&#39;t have to. You are free Battera. You can do what you want \nnow. You can settle down with Cybershark without worries. I just came \nto say good-bye.&quot; Vulois saw the new femme walk up. &quot;Who&#39;s your new \nfriend?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq rejoiced at the sound of battle.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re in Ramulus. Behind you 100%.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon whispered to Spears.\n\n\n***I don&#39;t trust him either. If it wasn&#39;t for the loyalty in his \nprogramming I would think he&#39;d kill me the first chance he gets. But \nhe won&#39;t turn on us unlesss he starts suspecting his past. And if he \ndoes that, we&#39;ll chip him. So just try not to get into anything with \nhim.***\n\nPrebon turned to the rest of the group.\n\n&quot;Savage and Trainers, go around the long way to the right so people \nwon&#39;t see us marching with you. And when you get close to the area, \nturn on your cloaking devices.&quot; The Trainers aboard Savage started \ndown their path, &quot;Slayer, take the long way to the left. That&#39;s where \nthe cliff is. Remember to turn on your cloak when you get up the \nridge. Spears and I will go directly to the spot. When we get close \nSpears make it look like you are fighting me. It has to be realistic. \nHopefully we&#39;ll get a map out of all this too. Now move out!&quot;\n\nPrebon started walking.\n\n\n"}}
