Maybe you should rename your character, unless he truly\n&gt; is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; member of the Tripreds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Actually the Tripredacus he might be refering to is the trio of\n&gt; predacon\n&gt; &gt; leaders on cybertron who hold the title: Tripredacus Council. Ravage\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; count as a Tripredacus Agent. :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can easily see where the confusion mounts... :o)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
