But she growled.\nThese Maximals weren&#39;t listening and now the Alliance making them and her\nlook bad. She sighed. What else was new?\nShe knew that it wasn&#39;t right to think that way, but they just weren&#39;t\nlistening!\nIron Raptor looked out across the field and saw more Maximals, ones which\nwere not coming to her. Here eyes narrowed.\nOpening a comm-link....*\n\n&quot; MAXIMALS!!!!!&quot;Her voice booming over the communicator.&quot; GET YOUR SKIT\nPLATES OVER HERE ON THE DUBBLE!!! I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re being shot at, just\ncease fire, quit thinking of yourself and get over here now!&quot;\n\n* She was slagging sick of their ignoring her, there were more important\nthing going on here then theyr stupid battle! Like a crew member&#39;s life!\nIron Raptor kept her eyes towards the battle field, ready to meet every\nMaximal that came eye to eye. She was not happy!\nBut the ones that had come she was proud of, those were the Maximals she was\nlooking forward to commanding in the future. And she knew, that inside of\neach Maximal, even the ones which had not some yet, there was loyalty\nwaiting to get out.\nIron Raptor sighed and thought to Prowl....&lt; What am I going to do? They\nwon&#39;t listen. When did they get like this?&gt;\nBut the Maximals weren&#39;t all that bad, and even she had faults. Her temper\nfor one, which was fairly pumped right now.\nIron Raptor stood facing the Maximals, glancing towards the ones that had\nalready come.\nThis battle was going to end one way or another, with or without the\nMaximals. She couldn&#39;t wait forever.*\n&lt; Come on, you guys! I know you can do better then this!&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
