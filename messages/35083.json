Or at least her spark.\nBy now she was feeling very tired and worn out, but there was no time to \nsleep when you&#39;re looking after over 20 Maximals.\nAnd though they could look after themselves, what sort of person would she \nbe if she didn&#39;t at least look out for them?\nThough those thoughts slipped her mind when she heard someone land near her, \nthen tuenrd to see that it was Prowl.\nA relieved smile crossed her lips at his greeting, leaning in against him at \nhis hug and kiss.\nIt was nice to have someone you could lean on, especially when you haven&#39;t \nrecovered from the wounds of war.*\n\n&quot; That would be a good idea.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
