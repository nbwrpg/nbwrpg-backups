He sat in\n&gt; front of a boulder, staring out into the distance. An auto-gun wasn&#39;t far\n&gt; from him. Megatron and Dark Mouse had done a good job making this cave\ninto\n&gt; a base, but it wasn&#39;t his type of place.\n&gt;\n&gt; He put his knees up and rested his arms across them. He was bored and the\n&gt; two bragging brothers weren&#39;t doing too much for him, except annoy him. He\n&gt; leaned his head back until the back of his head hit the long plate behind\n&gt; him. He needed something to do, but he couldn&#39;t leave the base.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Who invented Gatorade -- and what part did it play in\n&gt; winning the1967 Orange Bowl?
