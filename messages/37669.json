Yep, Michael Jackson, with a new album I believe is \ncalled &quot;Invincible&quot; that&#39;s supposed to be better than his &quot;Thriller&quot; album, \nwhich was pretty damn good and when he was black and didn&#39;t look like a chick)\n\nPresident Kaiser/Sequencer/Sinew/Captain Nemo:\n\n\n\nThe massive IGL flagship, the Otyebis, was now in Earth&#39;s atmosphere and \nrapidly descending downwards would would soon be known as Seattle, \nWashington, USA.  A major city built up quite a bit during a goldrush in \nAlaska, USA.  Travellers would stack up on supplies in the city and then try \ntheir luck in their greedy search of gold in Alaska.\n\nStill a dozen miles up in the air, it would take exactly fifteen cycles to \nreach the surface at the Otyebis&#39; current velocity.  It would be quite \nvisible given its size (a ship that&#39;s the size of three Iron Fist&#39;s combined \nand a little more), and with a Cybertronian&#39;s ability to magnify his/her \noptic view it would be even more visible.\n\n\nPresident Kaiser of the Intergalactic Gladiatorial League was on the bridge \nof the mighty craft.  He looked around at the bridge crew, all mostly \ndifferent species&#39; of organic creatures.  &quot;Captain Nemo, estimated time of \narrival?&quot;\n\n&quot;Approximately fifteen minutes, President.&quot; the feathered bird creature \nreplied.\n\n&quot;Very good.  And our trajectory is clear?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, sir, there are numerous hundred foot trees blocking our landing zone.&quot; \nSinew replied, out of his body armor but still fierce looking.  He walked \nover to the President and stood next to him. \n\n&quot;Clear them, Sinew.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;\n\nA few cannons extended from different places on the ship, several large \nfireballs shooting down at the surface, erupting in one huge flame, burning a \nlarge circle in the trees.  The area of the near perfect circle that had \nresulted in the weaponsfire was a few hundred feet larger than the actual \nOtyebis to give it some room when it landed.\n\nBack inside the bridge, Kaiser activated his comm. unit.  &quot;Vice-President \nSuka, assemble forty armed soldiers of your choice and have them split up and \nsecure all main entryways of the ship and put the Otyebis on yellow alert.&quot;\n\n"}}
