Shortly before he was going to turn he\n&gt; spoted\n&gt; &gt; a figure.  Probably and animal, but he wasn&#39;t\n&gt; sure.\n&gt; &gt; He went to robot mode and a laser sword poped out\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; his wrist compartment.  He dropped straight at\n&gt; &gt; Nightshade.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I had posted that when he was on the ground\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; Nightshade was trying to flank him he planted a\n&gt; &gt; grenade where he was likely to step on it as he\n&gt; moved.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: And Nightshade is a demolitions expert you\n&gt; think a dropped mine WHILE\n&gt; SHE&#39;S WATCHING YOU is gonna get her? Pffft.\n&gt; \n&gt; {Nightshade}\n&gt; \n&gt;     Nightshade sat back on her haunchs when the\n&gt; flyer turned and began to\n&gt; descend towards her, her eyes watching his movements\n&gt; casually not in the\n&gt; least bit worried about the sword he already had\n&gt; out. He was a maximal\n&gt; afterall, and attacking an unarmed unaggressive\n&gt; enemy was as impossible to\n&gt; their nature as was genocide.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Sitting back relaxed she waited for him to\n&gt; approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
