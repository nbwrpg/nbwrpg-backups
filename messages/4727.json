He knew what the process involved. \nBazooka pressed all the right buttons. The process would only take a few \nminutes. And it would include some new abilities. For Mantella there would be \nbetter weapon systems, an enhanced healing process, stronger claws and a \nsheild device.\n    Bobertron would get an entirely new beast mode, as he wanted. (I live \nnear him, he told me to.) He would get a new prehistoric mode, that of the \nmost terrifying sea creature to ever swim, a Megalodon. It was a sixty foot \nlong great white shark. It could easily kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex in it jaws. \nEven the Mosasaurus was afraid of it. He would also get a limited cloaking \nfeild, it would last for about 1 cycle.\n\n"}}
