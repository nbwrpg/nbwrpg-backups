Life was precious, and something one didn�t really appreciate until \nthey no longer had it. She planned on living a long time, however, and \nwasn�t about to dwell on what was yet to be.  As the sky became shrouded in \nfog Tavatron resettled herself so that her tail was no longer crumpled in a \nvery uncomfortable position beneath her. Slag it, that hurt. The one bad \nthing about having a tail was the inability to find a comfortable position \nwhen one was on their back. Well, it had always been a problem for her.\n\nDinobot had remained quiet for a while now, something she had grown used to. \nStill, something about his silence troubled the femme �bot. It was just a \nfeeling, one that wouldn�t stop nagging at her circuits. It figured that \ndespite her enjoyment of her current situation SOMETHING would start \nbothering her. It seemed she never got any peace. It was enough to make a \n�bot go mad. She had grown accustomed to the constant upheavals in her life, \nso this was nothing new.\n\nTavatron jumped at the sound of Dinobot�s voice. Who was he yelling at? She \nfollowed his gaze, trying to pinpoint some far off threat, but she found \nnothing. Was there something she had missed? Was someone following them? \nSuddenly she too was on her feet, the fact that they were quite a ways from \nthe ground didn�t sink in until she had already drawn her sword and scanned \nthe area as best she could. She then turned to face Dinobot, her sword \nlowering until the tip nearly touched Necromancer�s back. He was yelling at \nthe stars? Tavatron raised a questioning eye-ridge as she swiveled her ears \nforward, her expression one of mild curiosity and intense confusion. This \nwas completely unlike him. Had he gone mad from loss of fluid?\n\nFrom what she could tell this had something to do with his past, a thing he \nhad never really talked about with her. It was understandable, even she \ndidn�t like talking about what had been when there was still so much that \ncould be. Still, perhaps there was more to this than she thought. Dinobot \nreally did look upset. She would make it a point to ask him about it later, \nwhen they were safely on the ground and he was repaired. His current state \ncouldn�t be helping matters.\n\nTavatron nearly jumped as the massive dragon they were riding spoke. They \nwere landing?! She could worry about Dinobot later, right now she had to sit \ndown or else�\n\nNo sooner had Tavatron thought of the possibility of falling did Necromancer \nland. The force of the landing threw her from the Dragon�s back, and left \nher sprawled in the dirt a few feet from him. With a shake of her head and a \ngrowl of annoyance Tavatron got up and sheathed her sword. They were here, \nand Dinobot was still breathing. She thanked Necromancer for the ride before \nturning in Dinobot�s direction:\n\n&quot;Well, are you coming?&quot;\n\nShe had meant what she said in a very light-hearted sense. He no doubt had \nseen her fall, so she was trying to make the best of an embarrassing \nsituation.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
