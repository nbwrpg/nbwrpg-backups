However, there was a faction a long time ago in this RPG called the Energonians. They were energy beings much like yours, just they used energon energy instead of chaotican, and Zardus had a long rivalry with their leader (who happened to be one of the bots that helped Zardus and Wolfgang make the Alliance), so he knows how to handle energy beings.\n\nAnd the guy who controls Mustex: how&#39;d Mustex get onto Alliance Island? The shields were up.\n\n::Zardus/FZ/DevilDuer/Mosquitor::\n\nZardus frowns, thinking Frostbite&#39;s transmission over for a second and then replying. &quot;I would preffer meeting in neutral territory. Would the peninsula near my base be convenient for you?&quot;\n\nHe closes that link, and recieves Orchestra&#39;s transmission. &quot;This is Zardus, Alliance commander. I&#39;ll lower the shields so that you can get through. I&#39;ll be outside, we can meet there.&quot;\n\nHe walks toward the exit, looking at his wrist comp and tapping a few buttons, making a search for &quot;Infecticons&quot;. The search yields no matches. Zardus traces the Infecticon transmissions back to their origin, then makes a search for any bots that the Iron Fist&#39;s scanners detected traveling in that direction.\n\n&quot;Interesting...&quot; he says to himself, watching video footage of Vampiza flying over Alliance Island, surrounded by Chaotican energy. He zooms in, looking the bot over.\n\nUncanny resembalance to Energonians, he thinks to himself, activating his comm to Daemos: &quot;Daemos, can you report to my position as soon as possible? I need you to accompany me somewhere.&quot;\n\nZardus ends that transmission as well, exiting the base and seeing a bot firing. He frowns, tapping a few buttons to turn the autoguns off, and begin lowering the shields.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re either very brave or very stupid,&quot; he says, approaching the shields on the other side of which was Chaostaur (whatever his name is). &quot;Attacking a military installation single-handedly is a very suicidal task.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ nods, looking over the beasts once more.\n\n&quot;Yes. I must admit I wasn&#39;t expecting you to accomplish this.&quot;\n\nHe turns and walks toward the exit, the door opening. &quot;Would you like a shuttle to get back to wherever you are from, or would you rather fly by yourself?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer waits for Coput to get into the pilot seat, so that they can get going and he can get away from these weirdos. :-)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMosquitor is hit by Hurricane&#39;s shots (post 38120. Sorry for taking so long to reply), stumbling a bit.\n\n&quot;Traitor! Hell Beast will have your head!&quot; he yells and lunges at Hurricane again, swinging a large insect leg at him.\n\n\n"}}
