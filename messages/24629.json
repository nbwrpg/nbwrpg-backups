They also extend underwater). So, there would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no cover for your troops to hide, save underwater, where the Iron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fist also has defences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, keep in mind that Zardus had a lockdown on the area where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gotron shot at Lady Hawk, so she wouldn&#39;t be able to get out of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iron Fist.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, the Iron Fist is a giant battle cruiser, it&#39;d take a while to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; penetrate deep enough to take out the power source, provided you can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get through the shields.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Iron Fist/Zardus/DevilDuer/Havoc/Slayer/Lavacons::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Iron Fist&#39;s shields flashed to life as gunfire was detected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lasers and missiles hit against the shields, doing next to nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The defence systems respond, two signature-seeking missiles firing at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; each of the attackers, and three laser batteries opening fire as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Inside the Iron Fist, Zardus laughs as he sees the report of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attack. With nowhere to hide, these attackers wouldn&#39;t last long at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Nemesis, the Iron Fist is under attack,&quot; he says into his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comm, &quot;Finish up at the Cybertronian Fire as soon as you can. These\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attackers arn&#39;t any trouble at all, but there arn&#39;t many bots here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right now. Destroy the Maximals if you can, else get back here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With that, he set off down the hallway, toward the exit of the Iron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fist. While walking, he activated his comm, sending orders to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lavacons and DevilDuer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; DevilDuer arrived at the new pod, activating his comm. If he didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have his suit on, the pressure of the water would have crushed him in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seconds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;This is DevilDuer, an alliance bot. Please identify yourself,&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; says over the comm to the new bot, recieving the orders from Zardus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and keeping them in mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the Cybertronian Fire, the Lavacons recieve Zardus&#39;s orders,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; splitting up into seperate bots and boosting off toward the Iron Fist.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Havoc sighs, hearing the sounds of battle outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Guess we fight here instead of the CF,&quot; he says to Vlad,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transforming into robot mode and flying out of the Iron Fist. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fires two missiles at Slayer, who was just flying into sight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Slayer dives under two missiles, growling when several shots from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iron Fist hit him, leaving deep dents in his armor. This warship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seemed to have more power than the average ones. Slayer had flown\n&gt; &gt; &gt; behind Prebon&#39;s group and got here seconds after. He thought that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attacking a full fledged battle cruiser rather than picking on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crippled ship like they were going to was pretty stupid, but he kept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his oppinions to himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Slayer fires several shots at Havoc, but they don&#39;t penetrate the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shields.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Prebon sees the first set of bots rush out of the Iron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fist. &quot;ATTACK&quot; he yells pointing in the direction of the enemy. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; picked up his constrictor rifle and fired five shots at Sharpedge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He pulled the pin on a flash grenade and tossed it in front of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; counterattackers. The flash was harmless it was designed to disrupt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thier sight long enough to advance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hammer Ducks behind cover as the missles hit. He pops his head up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just on time to feel a series ofpistol shots hit him in the chest to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stomach region. He fell back behind the cover that had saved him from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the missles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blaze fired her disrupror again, this time at the area of the ship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that held the power unit. Without power the ship would be defenseless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bullit fired two missles from his wrist, and five imploder blasts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from his rifle at Godfather. The blasts would destroy a target from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the outside in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   From: Alloran2@a...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Sent: Tuesday, December 26, 2000 8:32 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: Washington crosses the Delaware\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   :::Sharpedge/Godfather:::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   ::they get out of the CR chambers::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Sharpedge: Damn, we were in there WAAY to long!
