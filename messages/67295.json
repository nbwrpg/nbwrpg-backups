I thought Doc and\nsomeone else where on the water, 100 feet or so below the railing where\nRodimus and Kup were standing? And if the is correct, is Doc firing at\nScourge who along with Cyclonus are moving towards Rodimus, but who are\nprobrably not visible to Doc, or is Doc firing on the few sweeps that\ncame to the water? Some of these have gone off in the direction Trelos\nwent, but a couple are veering towards Doc and who ever else is on the\nwater.\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
