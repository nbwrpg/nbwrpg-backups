Why is it that you always look \nfor some way to insult Legendary Nemasis when he&#39;s minding his own \nbusiness? You need your ass kicked, and that&#39;s the bottom line. \nWHAT!? That&#39;s the bottom line. WHAT!? It&#39;s where the name is signed \nat the bottom of the contract. WHAT!? It&#39;s over. You wonder why \npeople don&#39;t like you, especially Legendary Nemasis, well, it&#39;s \nprobably because you do your best to insult him every post, you need \nto know when to stop. You act like LN is the bad guy, when it&#39;s you \nwho won&#39;t end the war you disgusting little bitch. And I also \nbelieve that Legendary Nemasis was right. He had the character \nfirst, then it&#39;s his property, including the name, bottom line...\n\n\n"}}
