But he noticed Rumble \nhad \n&gt; fallen to the ground to his chagrin, and all he was going to do was \ncrash on \n&gt; top of Rumble, unless the target got out of the way.\n&gt; \n&gt; The roar of a helicopter&#39;s blades entered the area as an AH-46 \nApache Attack \n&gt; Helicopter arrived in the general vacinity.  But this was no \nordinary attack \n&gt; craft, it was an Autobot!  But he had not followed the same course \nof his \n&gt; brethren, he had circled around to come up behind the intruders!  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Look out behind ya!&quot; Blades&#39; voice eminated from the apache \ntowards the \n&gt; Decepticons, one of the cannons on the helicopter&#39;s nose firing off \ntwenty \n&gt; 30mm rounds at Soundwave&#39;s torso from behind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Streetwise&#39;s form twisted into a biped form, photon pistol in \nhand.  He \n&gt; surveyed the area, watching the backs of his fellow Autobots and \nMaximals as \n&gt; well as keeping an optic out for more &#39;Cons.\n&gt; \n&gt; First Aid stopped, but didn&#39;t transform.  He let his sensors search \nfor any \n&gt; injured allies.  &quot;Be careful!&quot; his voice warned to everyone else.\n\n\n"}}
