No one could keep=\r\n their mind of the battle which was going on just a few short miles away.\n\n=\r\n  Ravenchief glanced in the direction of the battle, but all he could see w=\r\nas the faint cloud of sweeps which surrounded the island.  They felt horrib=\r\nle that Rodimus and the Matrix were at stake, and there was nothing they co=\r\nuld do. \n\n  &quot;Perseus to all Maximals in Atlantis, I need to tend to our gue=\r\nst.  Please make yourselves useful to the work crews, its going to be a lon=\r\ng recovery.&quot; he said in a distant-sounding tone.\n\n  Perseus approached the =\r\nshield and glanced around the area for any enemies.  Salveo waited for the =\r\nsignal, then dropped the shield.  The doors opened and Perseus stepped insi=\r\nde; Guardia took this opportunity to go out before the shield came back up.=\r\n  A moment later the defenses were back in place. \n\n  Perseus walked down t=\r\nhe narrow corridor ramps, leading the the lowest level of the base.  At the=\r\n holding cells, he pushed a button on the panel next to battered blast door=\r\ns and it slid open, revealing the completely trashed holding cell and secur=\r\nity office.  He continued to the dimly lit secondary cell and knocked on th=\r\ne bars. \n\n  &quot;Blacknightmare?  I apologize for making you wait so long.
