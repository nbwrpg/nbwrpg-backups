The\nTransformers \nare in for much more than they have seen. I will be returning, at\nsome \npoint, once I have enough power. But until then I will use some of my \npower to alter the planet. Then Magmatron will own some of the\nplanet, \nthe parts I need.&quot;\n&gt;       Cybertron glowed a bright crimson red. The Citadel of Elders \nnow becomes Magmatrons layer. Some new characters will be appearing \nunder Magmatron&#39;s rule.\n&gt;       Unicron traveled back in time. He reached Past Earth. He was \nin the Neo Beast Wars near future. He placed a Time Gate on the\nplanet \nin a remote location. He then traveled a few days back.\n&gt;       He found Magmatron trying to move his base closer to the \nocean.\n&gt;       &quot;That&#39;s right, he needs salt water to survive. Well, that&#39;s\nno \nproblem,&quot; He said to himself. He talked to Magmatron.\n&gt;       &quot;My minion, the time has come for you to leave this planet \nbehind, you have greater goals. I will allow you time to decide who \nwill lead the Destron forces in your place.&quot;\n&gt;       &quot;It is decided, master,&quot; Magmatron called up. &quot;Shredder will \nlead the Destrons here on Earth.&quot;\n&gt;       &quot;Very well, I will transport you to Cybertron.&quot;\n&gt;       With that Magmatron was gone from Past Earth. The Gateway \nwould be discovered in a few days and more Transformers may travel \nthrough it.
