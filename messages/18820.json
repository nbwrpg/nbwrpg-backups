The ark has been destroyed. We have \nnot been destroyed but i dont know how. All I know is it must be rebuilt. My \ndestron friend Sphink has already contacted you. His destron forces have \nalready agreeded to help the maximals rebuild the ark. I fwe do so we will \nsave history and help us win over the maximals favor. I know you do not like \nthe maximals but if we are to take down the alliance we will need the \nmaximals. Now we will also need the help of your troops to rebuild the ark. \nMy spy..is Ultra Magnus. The former comander of the autobots. And he is ready \nto go under your command.&quot;\n\n"}}
