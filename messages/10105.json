He \ncould tell \n&gt; that she was sad, and he was a bit mad at himself for reacting that \nway. He \n&gt; sighs quietly. Why did he doubt that she was a sincere Maximal? He \ncould tell \n&gt; she had a good spark, and a good sence of humor. He had yet to see \nany \n&gt; Predacons with that quality. He walks closer to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey, when you&#39;re out of the CR chamber at the Ark, you want me to \ngive you a \n&gt; tour of our base?&quot; he asks, trying to change the subject. He was \nmad at \n&gt; himself for reacting as he did, and hoped that she wasn&#39;t mad at \nhim for it.\n\n\n"}}
