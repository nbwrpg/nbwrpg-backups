He was attacked both in \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; body and in his spark, even though his Lord was at the other end \nof \n&gt; &gt; the system. Tendrils of electricity shook him, causing \n&gt; interferences \n&gt; &gt; that could be picked up from Earth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the middle of his agony, he heard a thundrous voice inside his \n&gt; &gt; head.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unicron: Incompetent Minions! They have failed me. Now, \nBloodblade, \n&gt; &gt; it is your turn to go, but I have learned from this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When the pain stopped, he had forgotten who he was or who he \n&gt; served. \n&gt; &gt; He only remembered his name. He started spinning wildly as he \n&gt; entered \n&gt; &gt; high orbit and was attracted to the ground.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A few minutes later, he crashed loudly into the ground, exactly \nat \n&gt; &gt; the same distance from the three bases.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
