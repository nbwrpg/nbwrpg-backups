Does anyone e=\r\nlse know?  Has anyone even told Nightshift and Tucson?

HAH, THAT WAS JUST PAYBACK =\r\nFOR WHAT YOUR COMRADE DID TA THE GREATEST NINJABOT MASTER OF ALL TIME! IF I=\r\n HAD KNOWN THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE ADMITTED TA MY MISTAKE!  OHHH ARE YOU IN=\r\n SERIOUS SCRAP NOW BUDDY!  JUST WAIT UNTIL TUCSON IS NOTIFIED OF THIS! Then=\r\n again... Ohh boy, Leo, I - think you better be the one ta tell &#39;em...

BLACKARACHNIA still poised\n&gt; &gt; in th=\r\ne shadows of the trees, keeping locks on the numerous Maximals as VICE\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nGRIP had disengaged slightly, working over now with DRILL BIT in digging\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; underneath the ground and burrowing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; DINOBOT smirking, &quot;Why, is t=\r\naht not your own soldiers upon your orders who\n&gt; &gt; are continuosly harrassi=\r\nng us now?  Truly, I expected some semblance of\n&gt; &gt; dignity, at least from =\r\nthe Rodent.  Him I expected to have a smidgen of\n&gt; &gt; awareness of the crisi=\r\ns.  But, if he is quite happy to mock us when you have\n&gt; &gt; called us, then =\r\nI doubt there is any crisis at all if he&#39;s quite happy to\n&gt; &gt; instigate a f=\r\night and back up those who do.

He looked at DINOBOT, =\r\n&quot;You will\n&gt; keep your troops in line as well.&quot; He glanced up as the other\n&gt;=\r\n Predacons were moving in. He glanced over at HYDRAS, wondering when or\n&gt; e=\r\nven if the PREDACON leader would do anything about his troops.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;With m=\r\ne.&quot; LEO said with a dramatic flare worthy of a PRIME. He turned\n&gt; and walke=\r\nd back towards the center of the clearing where they had\n&gt; originally been =\r\nhaving the discussion with HYDRAS, perhaps distance\n&gt; would allow things to=\r\n simmer down.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME was having the distinct impression that this t=\r\nruce was not\n&gt; going to last, and he was not sure if he could hold it toget=\r\nher long\n&gt; enough to get to TUSCON. At least so long as HYDRAS refused to k=\r\neep\n&gt; his men in check.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
