Sever second later hearing another \ncommunication from their commander.\nHe was approaching her position, noticing faintly that Tavatron had beaten \nhim to it.\nAngel Prime&#39;s transmission had seemed like a challenge towards the commander \nand her abilities, and even though he didn&#39;t agree with the Maximals actions \nso far, he had to admit that in a sense their commander was weak. But only \nas far as compassion was concerned.\nSo what if they lost one? The remainder would go on to engage the enemy!\nHowever...the battle was already lost. It had been ever since Oblitertron \nhad formed and demolished a fair number of the Maximals.\nThe Cybertronian Fire was already in a wreck. There was a 90% chance of no \nvictory at this time.\nDinobot growled as he walked up to the crowd which had gathered around the \ncommander, glaring towards FZ and charging up his optic laser just in case.\nThere was an uneasy feeling in the air and it was either a sense of the \npeople around him or a feeling of his own. There was no telling with so many \nbots about him, even though they equaled less then 15.\nDinobot stopped and looked back across the field, already in the position in \nwhich he had been ordered to be in. By the commander&#39;s side. He glanced \ntowards Tavatron and saw her stance, ready for battle. He was also ready, \nbut was not so obvious.**\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
