He groans and \nstands up, looking around the group. He knew who he was and he knew \nwho they were, and he also knew why he was here. Stratus takes a few \nshaky steps, looking at Biomass.\n\nHe was about two feet shorter than Biomass, grey-white colored due to \nhis beast mode being a great white shark. There was a fin on his \nback, and one of his arms was his shark head, its eyes looking around \nthe room.\n\n&quot;Well, are we going to get going or are we just gonna stand here?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNeody also gains cinsciousness, sitting up in time to catch the end \nof Stratus&#39; comment. If he didn&#39;t feel so new to all this, he&#39;d tell \nStratus to shut up, but he was feeling slightly dizzy at the moment. \nNeody rubbs a hand on his forehead, trying to clear it. He frowns, \nlooking down at his hands and seeing that they were crab legs. There \nwas a missile launcher in the middle of each hand. He&#39;d be good for \nbattle, but not really for handling small objects.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA groan is heard from the last bot as he stands up and shakes his \nhead to clear it. He was Crater, the group&#39;s weapons expert. Two \nscabberds hung down from his waist, each containing a light blue \nsword. He was mostly blue, and was about a foot smaller than Biomass. \nHe had a large rifle in his back compartment, and several pistols in \nthigh and arm compartments. His optics could fire laser blasts, and \nhis beast mode tail was attached to his left shoulder, a missile \nlauncher on his right. His beast mode was a sting ray.\n\nCrater looks to Biomass for orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * His name was Biomass, and from what he remembered he was part of \na crew of \n&gt; 6.\n&gt; He sat on the floor with the rest of his crew, blinking a few times \nbefore \n&gt; looking around him and scanning the ship and his troops for the \nfirst time.\n&gt; He knew their mission, from the Great Ones:\n&gt; 1) Seek out the transformer races.\n&gt; 2) Play dumb, reporting that their ship just crashed, and mingle in \nwith \n&gt; them.\n&gt; 3) Study and document them, reporting back to this ship ever month \nor so.\n&gt; That was what his prime directive was.\n&gt; Him and the rest of the crew, that is. It was kinda weird, knowing \nthat you \n&gt; were put on this planet from a heigher power only to study a race \nthat they \n&gt; seeked to destroy. But he would and so would the rest of the crew.\n&gt; By now they each had their own beast mode as well, looking his over \nand \n&gt; smiling.\n&gt; This adventure was going to be fairly exciting, and that was good \nthinking \n&gt; for a person who was a hunk of stone less then 20 cycles ago.\n&gt; But enough about this, a feeling worming up on him that it was \nabout time \n&gt; that they got their skid-plates in gear.\n&gt; Biomass coughed slightly to clear his lungs as he got to his feet, \na little \n&gt; unsteadily since it was the first time EVER that he stood.\n&gt; As a 10 foot transformer, Biomass wasn&#39;t something to be taken \nlightly.\n&gt; And niether was his beast mode, which made up for his size.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the floor a slender form stired, sighing as she rose to a sit.\n&gt; From what she knew her name was Sublime, and she was the explorer \nfor the \n&gt; group. Like a scout, not to pit too fine a point on it.\n&gt; Her aqua green eyes searched the room until they fell on Biomass, \nwondering \n&gt; just what his beast mode was with those tenticles haning from his \nshoulders, \n&gt; making up some kind of gray cape.\n&gt; Her own beast mode was similar but more basic, but she did live the \n&gt; clear/blue jelly-like armor that fell from her hips like a skirt, \nfinding \n&gt; that the same things fell from her head like blue/clear hair...only \none \n&gt; piece.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On the other side of the room there was a sneeze, making both \nBiomass and \n&gt; Sublime look over.\n&gt; A skinny, also slender but not as much, woman sat up, sniffing \nslightly.\n&gt; This one was called Nue&#39;e.\n&gt; Her beast mode wasn&#39;t exactly easy to see, it was even harder to \nguess with \n&gt; the two pinkish white seashells covering her chest, her entire \narmor being a \n&gt; sort of off pink.\n&gt; She yawned slightly and looked over her shoulder at the two other \n&gt; transformers, pushing a set of actual glasses up the bridge of her \nnose.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
