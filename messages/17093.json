I am not pretending. I am working for the Allience under \nZardus now. And untill we win the war, Cybershark and I will continue \nto fight.&quot;  She stoppped and looked at him wide eyed. &quot;CYbertron? \nYour going to Cybertron? How? With whom? When?&quot; She sudenly realized \nthat she might be able to go home and get off this planet. Maybe even \ntake Cybershark with her. She smiled at the thought.\n\n::Spears::\n\nShe took Prebons&#39;s arm and walked out with him.  She felt uneasy \nabuot all this.  She wondered if Slayer would &quot;Accidentally&quot; line her \nup in his sights and killer when attacking Ramulus.  She knew she \nwould have to stick very close to Prebon in order to be safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; (Soundwave is alive? How did this happen?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois laughed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Stop pretending Battera. I know it&#39;s been awhile since we saw each \n&gt; other face to face, but you don&#39;t have to rub it in. I just came to \n&gt; say I&#39;m leaving. I&#39;m going to Cybertron. I&#39;m passing the mission \ndown \n&gt; to The Keepers. If you want, they will comfort you with open arms. \n&gt; But you don&#39;t have to. You are free Battera. You can do what you \nwant \n&gt; now. You can settle down with Cybershark without worries. I just \ncame \n&gt; to say good-bye.&quot; Vulois saw the new femme walk up. &quot;Who&#39;s your new \n&gt; friend?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix and Fliq rejoiced at the sound of battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re in Ramulus. Behind you 100%.&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon whispered to Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ***I don&#39;t trust him either. If it wasn&#39;t for the loyalty in his \n&gt; programming I would think he&#39;d kill me the first chance he gets. \nBut \n&gt; he won&#39;t turn on us unlesss he starts suspecting his past. And if \nhe \n&gt; does that, we&#39;ll chip him. So just try not to get into anything \nwith \n&gt; him.***\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon turned to the rest of the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Savage and Trainers, go around the long way to the right so people \n&gt; won&#39;t see us marching with you. And when you get close to the area, \n&gt; turn on your cloaking devices.&quot; The Trainers aboard Savage started \n&gt; down their path, &quot;Slayer, take the long way to the left. That&#39;s \nwhere \n&gt; the cliff is. Remember to turn on your cloak when you get up the \n&gt; ridge. Spears and I will go directly to the spot. When we get close \n&gt; Spears make it look like you are fighting me. It has to be \nrealistic. \n&gt; Hopefully we&#39;ll get a map out of all this too. Now move out!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon started walking.\n\n\n"}}
