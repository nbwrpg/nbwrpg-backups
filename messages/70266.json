As he does so he first replies to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;I copy=\r\n you Rodimus, I promise to protect Nightlight and I swear I will avenge the=\r\n wrong doing that Jhiaxus and Hydras have done to you.  But that time is no=\r\nt now.  May Primus guide you safely Rodimus, I salute you.  Tucson Prime, e=\r\nnding transmission.  Perceptor, Since I can&#39;t see, and elevations in temper=\r\nature are throwing off my thermal sensors, I&#39;ll need you to give me the dir=\r\nections verbally.  Night Shift, how are you holding out back there with Win=\r\ndlord?&quot;\n\nNight Shift keeps Windlord secure and safe from further injury.\n\n&quot;=\r\nOkay sir, He&#39;s stable.  Hey, I just got Legacy&#39;s transmission.  Quickstride=\r\n&#39;s down here too.  He got lured in by Deepstryke and the other seekers.&quot;\n\nT=\r\nucson Prime&#39;s temper was begining to be cut a bit short.  He was sick and t=\r\nired of Hydras&#39;s lackies trying to lure his comrades into dangerous situati=\r\nons.  Yet, he knew that he had the help of Perceptor who he was also helpin=\r\ng at the time.  Getting mad would solve nothing, but attempting to turn an =\r\nenemy into a comrade, would make a difference.  It wasn&#39;t for gaining the u=\r\npper hand, it was more for ensuring that those who wished for freedom, were=\r\n able to have it and lead a decent and content life.  It&#39;s what he wanted m=\r\nost of all for those who would have liked to have lived in a world where th=\r\ney could make their own choices.\n\n&quot; Don&#39;t worry Night Shift, averages even =\r\nout after a while.  And I have a feeling this one will surely even out for =\r\nus.&quot;\n\nHe keeps on his course and concentrates on getting everyone out safel=\r\ny.  Yet he found he could also converse with his passengers and keep an ear=\r\n out on the road ahead.\n\n&quot; Perceptor, after this ordeal, I know you said th=\r\nat the next time we meet we&#39;ll be enemies, and I do respect your choice but=\r\n I want you to know that wherever your choices lead you, I want you to know=\r\n that my doors are open if you wish to step into them.&quot;\n\nNight Shift could =\r\nalso see the sacrifice Perceptor had made for his leader and the others.  H=\r\ne also thought twice about the Predacon.\n\n&quot; He&#39;s right, No Predacon&#39;s ever =\r\nshown compassion for anyone, and what you just did, if that&#39;s not compassio=\r\nn I dunno what is.  Yeah, ya carry yourself like a baddie, but, deep down s=\r\nomeplace, deep down, there&#39;s a decent bot just waitn&#39; ta come out.  And we =\r\ndon&#39;t say that about every Predacon or Decepticon either.  And we could rea=\r\nlly use an A class intel specialist like you at the Ark.&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Now, don&#39;t force him if he doesn&#39;t want to. But the invitation is open i=\r\nf he wants to take it or not. Remember, Autobots don&#39;t force others into th=\r\neir way of life, they give an individual the chance to chose where they wis=\r\nh to be and respect their wishes.&quot;\n\nNight Shift sighs.\n\n&quot;As ya wish sir.&quot;\n\n=\r\nQuickstride knew when to turn tail, and this time, he does just as his gut =\r\nfeelings tell him to do.  Turn around and bolt as fast as his hooves could =\r\ntake him.\n\n&quot;On second thought Legacy&#39;s right!  I&#39;M OUTA HERE!&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nb=\r\nwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: R=\r\nODIMUS PRIME, CYCLONUS, SCOURGE, JHIAXUS, SCORPONOK, Tuscon,\n&gt; Nightshift, =\r\nDarkhawk, Perceptor\n&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Tunnels beneath the Black =\r\nFortress\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Uh, uh, I think Rodimus told ya to go back for a good rea=\r\nson Sir.

Ohh yeah, you&#39;re gonna be a legend, and I think Rodimus knows =\r\nit.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson Prime pauses for a moment, and then understands what Ni=\r\nght Shift was telling him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I just didn&#39;t think it would happen th=\r\nis soon Night Shift. You&#39;re right. We&#39;ll all leave together and get everyon=\r\ne back to the Ark.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As the Autobots, Maximals and Perceptor begin to m=\r\nake their way out\n&gt; Rodimus nodded, his armor once again that smooth black =\r\nand polished\n&gt; finish of Dark Rodimus, the cold white flames majestically a=\r\ncross his\n&gt; chest. However it was amber colored optics that looked up at Cy=\r\nclonus\n&gt; and Jhiaxus as they come down the tunnels toward him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, b=\r\nrothers, comrades it is time to end this.&quot; Rodimus said, his\n&gt; voice soundi=\r\nng strained.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus turned as if he were about to fire his weapons at=\r\n the\n&gt; retreating Tuscon and Perceptor, but instead sent a spread of rocket=\r\ns\n&gt; at the tunnel walls and ceiling!\n&gt; \n&gt; Explosively the walls collapsed, =\r\nbringing tons of rock down towards\n&gt; the floor, cutting off any chance of a=\r\nttack that Cyclonus and the\n&gt; others may had in Tuscon&#39;s direction!\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne last sounds that can be heard from the inside is Cyclonus as he\n&gt; said, &quot;=\r\nNow, what is . . .&quot; there is a pause and then Cyclonus&#39; voice,\n&gt; &quot;. . . RUN=\r\n FLEE NOW!&quot; and then Rodimus&#39; distinct laughter!\n&gt; \n&gt; A message comes to Pe=\r\nrceptor and Tuscon from Rodimus, &quot;Protect\n&gt; Nightlight! I have broken my pr=\r\nomise to her, but I think she&#39;ll know\n&gt; why.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Then the cave began to r=\r\numble as, on the other side of the newly\n&gt; fallen wall of stone and debris,=\r\n the explosive charge that Perceptor\n&gt; had left finished its count down! Th=\r\ne debris rumbled and shook as if\n&gt; it were about to erupt with something, b=\r\nut then it finally fell\n&gt; silent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Steam and the unique smell of sulfur=\r\n began to fill the air, venting\n&gt; from the other side of the fallen wall.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Meanwhile . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; Who: LEGACY, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA, Rat Trap, Quickst=\r\nride,\n&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Hallways\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In another part of the t=\r\nunnel system, Quick Stride, who was full of determination to get at Deepstr=\r\nyke and the other seekers, falls for the lure, as Rat Trap tries desperatel=\r\ny to go after him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Wait, I smell a rat, and it&#39;s not me! Don&#39;t fa=\r\nll for it Quickstride! IT&#39;S A TRAP! UGHHH THAT STUPID HORSE!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy c=\r\nontinued firing at the shield, his cannon attempting to bring\n&gt; it down wit=\r\nh a resonance burst!\n&gt; \n&gt; Deepstryke on the other hand chuckled as he lured=\r\n Quickstride back to\n&gt; an area where the Black Fortress&#39; autocannons were o=\r\nperative, and then\n&gt; he stopped, as the cannons oriented themselves on Quic=\r\nkstride.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ahh Maximal, and here is where your foray ends.&quot; Deepstryke =\r\nsaid\n&gt; coldly as his own cannons come online. &quot;It&#39;s a shame you fell for th=\r\nis\n&gt; so easily.&quot; Deepstryke said as he gloated. &quot;Fir . . . &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as h=\r\ne spoke the walls and floor began to shift and rumble as\n&gt; somewhere below =\r\nthe Fortress, Perceptor&#39;s explosion went off! The\n&gt; lights and power to the=\r\n auto cannons and the shield that Deepstryke\n&gt; had in place, separating Qui=\r\nckstride from the others shut off,\n&gt; plunging them all into a sudden darkne=\r\nss!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;WHAT?!? NO!&quot; Phobia said in surprise, although where she was exac=\r\ntly\n&gt; in the darkness was difficult to make out.\n&gt; \n&gt; A cannon blast lanced=\r\n out at Deepstryke, in this new darkness looking\n&gt; like lightning! Deepstry=\r\nke is knocked backwards as Legacy transmitted\n&gt; to Quickstride, &quot;Come. It i=\r\ns time to leave this place quickly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy&#39;s engines revved as he beg=\r\nan to back out and work his way\n&gt; towards the exit, although he kept his ca=\r\nnon oriented in Deepstryke&#39;s\n&gt; direction should he have to defend himself f=\r\nurther. His headlights\n&gt; came on, lighting up the tunnel ahead.\n&gt; \n&gt; So far=\r\n Phobia and Blackrazor were no where to be seen, although noise\n&gt; from Deep=\r\nstryke could be heard coming from somewhere in the darkness\n&gt; behind them.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
