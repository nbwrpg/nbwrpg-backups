She tried to catch her \nbreath.  She smiled and blushed. She whispered,&quot;whoah.....I \nmean...ah...&quot;  She looked at him and into his eyes. She shook her \nhead to clear it and then looked around to make sure no one else saw \nthem.  If someone had seen them, she would have to make a few changes \nin her plans, but nothing drastic.  She looked at him, she tried to \nspeak, but no words came out.  She closed her mouth and giggled \nslightly as if embarressed a bit.   She stood up and held his hand, \nstill blushing,&quot;I was wondering, could we go for a walk? I think I \nneed some air. Ah, Is it hot in here or is it just me?&quot; She fanned \nher face with her other hand. Making it look like she was trying to \ncool down. Still holding his hand, &quot; I&#39;m very sorry,I don&#39;t normally \ndo that with someone I just met. I mean I don&#39;t just and kiss total \nstrangers like that. I mean...&quot; she was acting flustered and \nnervouse.  &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  She looked at the doorway and saw no \none. Coast clear, she thought. She looked at Chordate,&quot;Uhm, how about \nthat walk?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
