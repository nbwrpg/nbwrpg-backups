He had to figure out a way to get Magmatr=\r\non to literally take a few hits but through indirect means.  He thinks to h=\r\nimself as to how to go about doing so.  But then, it comes to him.  The old=\r\n dragon must have had many friends among the Natural world, including the c=\r\navern where they were now.  \n\n&quot; When all else fails, turn to those who are =\r\nyour most trusted followers.  No matter their size, what lives among you in=\r\n Nature, can prove to be your greatest  comrades.  I get it now.   I know w=\r\nhat I must do.&quot;\n\nStraightshot stops the music, as she watches her brother l=\r\nift his head and begin to emit a soft rumble from his throat.  Yet the pitc=\r\nh of the sound is too high for normal ears, it is well received by throngs =\r\nof cave dwelling bats that swarm out in clouds of activity.  He hoped that =\r\nthey would be enough to throw Magmatron for a loop.\n\nQuickstride tries desp=\r\nerately to fend off the remaining Sharkitcons while Rattrap lends him a han=\r\nd in doing so.  It&#39;s at this time when bats cover the air around them.\n\n&quot; W=\r\nhoah!

Also the\n&gt; fact that TUSCON has al=\r\nready been damaged once by trying to deflect\n&gt; his plasma blast with his ar=\r\nm has helped immensly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agility takes power, that is a warrior&#39;s maxim.=\r\n The heavier you are,\n&gt; the more power it takes to propell yourself through=\r\n the air. It\n&gt; applied to TUSCON as much as it did to MAGMATRON. Although M=\r\nAGMATRON\n&gt; was signifigantly heavier than TUSCON, TUSCON was not light weig=\r\nht\n&gt; either. He was built to be a PRIME.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was two dragons fighting e=\r\nach other, one nearly twice as large as\n&gt; the other, both skilled and full =\r\nof their own anger and power! As much\n&gt; as TUSCON was relying on agility an=\r\nd training, it was obvious to\n&gt; onlookers that MAGMATRON was also well trai=\r\nned.\n&gt; \n&gt; A veteran of wars and battles that TUSCON had only seen in histor=\r\nical\n&gt; video, MAGMATRON was also well versed in many of the combat arts and=\r\n a\n&gt; master of several!\n&gt; \n&gt; In this draconic mode MAGMATRON was like some =\r\nchimeric dragon-like\n&gt; creature, his powerful forearms slashing out visciou=\r\nsly at TUSCON,\n&gt; ignoring the music and noise coming from the others!\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Quickstride looks around and reloads his cannon.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Wel=\r\nl that worked but there&#39;s still a long way ta go.  Time ta reload and\n&gt;&gt; ke=\r\nep shooting.  Sheesh, they even come outa the woodwork.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ney had almost literally swarmed with SHARKTICONS, although their\n&gt; numbers =\r\nhad been thinned out by at least half! Many of them were\n&gt; beginning to cir=\r\ncle towards the center of the cavern again as they\n&gt; regrouped around SKY B=\r\nYTE and the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; As QUICKSTRIDE was reloading several SHARKTICONS c=\r\name at him at once\n&gt; trying to catch him while he was distracted. The attac=\r\nk was not all\n&gt; that clever, but it did show a level of intellegence and gr=\r\nasp of the\n&gt; situation that the SHARKTICONS of old may not have grasped. Ho=\r\nwever\n&gt; these new ones seemed to be a bit more astute, even with their mast=\r\ner\n&gt; under attack and not able to give them more direct orders.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; DINOBOT&#39;s shot over was pure luck rather than skill, but he would t=\r\nake what\n&gt;&gt; he could get as his large tail blaster glowed, him trying to us=\r\ne it in close\n&gt;&gt; quarters to slash off the SHARKTICONS around and try to re=\r\ngain some room!\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; There was a groan from VICE GRIP.  Saved=\r\n by MAXIMALS.  What was prehistoric\n&gt;&gt; Earth coming to?  He took the opport=\r\nunity to throw off some of the\n&gt;&gt; SHARKTICONS on top of him, getting up, hi=\r\ns body sparking and heavily\n&gt;&gt; damaged.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Right in time to be sent spr=\r\nawling by the shockwave from the thrown\n&gt;&gt; explosive!\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; With =\r\nthe work of DINOBOT and the MAXIMAL FUZORS as well as RAT TRAP\n&gt; and QUICKS=\r\nTRIDE the SHARKTICONS were nearly spent!\n&gt; \n&gt; Except for the few still atta=\r\ncking QUICKSTRIDE most of them had\n&gt; clustered around SKYBYTE, there were p=\r\nerhaps 20 of them left as oppose\n&gt; to the horde of them seemed to almost bo=\r\nil into the room a few minutes\n&gt; ago . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; . . . could it really have =\r\nbeen so short of a time span? . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYBYTE&#39;s smile had little humor i=\r\nn it as he watched the scene.\n&gt; Instead it had hints of fear and, a loss of=\r\n the supreme confidence\n&gt; that he once had. His optics glanced across the S=\r\nHARKTICON carcasses\n&gt; that littered the floor.\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=9CATTACK!!!=E2=\r\n=80=9D He yelled out, forgetting about the poetry and the finesse\n&gt; of it a=\r\nll, and with that single word SKYBYTE sent his last remaining\n&gt; SHARKTICONS=\r\n into battle! Meanwhile he himself began back peddling\n&gt; towards MAGMATRON =\r\nwas battling TUSCON.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;RODIMUS!!!
