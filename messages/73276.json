Their only choice was to flee, and flee they did.\n\nEven BLACKARACHNIA, if she chose, would be in range for such a call as\nthe rest of the troop moved out.\n\nIt took them some time to retrace their steps and find their way back\nthrough the jungle paths and out.\n\nThe trip back was relatively uneventful. The Volcano behind them was\nquickly becoming a distant memory as they set their optics on getting\nhome, recharging, performing repairs on themselves and fowarding\nvaries nefarious schemes.\n\nJust as they were topping the last rise that would bring HYDRAS&#39; base\ninto view there was a crackle along the PREDACON encrypted channels.\n&quot;Welcom back.&quot; It was TARANTULUS&#39; voice. &quot;I am not detecting Hydras\namong you.&quot; There was a certain eagerness in his voice. &quot;Or Cryotek\nfor that matter.&quot;\n\nThere was a wicked chuckle, &quot;Have you done away with the trouble makers?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
