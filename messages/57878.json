As you can guess, the new council has discussed about a \nfew things. We will soon get to clear out the member list, but to \nmake up for the reduced number of member, we&#39;d like everyone to ask \nfriends to join. As I like to say, the more, the merrier! Also, we \ntalked about this:\n\n- There will be a fourth faction that will come in the game. The \nmembers will decide among suggested concepts and ultimately, one \nfaction will be brought into play. The concept had to include the \nalliegeance (if to any other group), the goals, the typical attitude \nand the general functions of the typical members. Also, such concepts \nwill be made for the four major factions and the minor ones.\n\n- As it was hinted previously, the council might start designing plot \nlines that will require active participation from the members. These \nplotlines would be designed to keep the players on the edge and be \nready for anything... However, we will need your accord for that. \nWhat do you think of it?\n\nSince we don&#39;t have a ready message board on the website, we&#39;ll allow \npeople to speak their mind on this board. For the faction \nsuggestions, though, create a separate post, please.\n\n\n\n"}}
