When a Cybertronian \ngets\n&gt; to make his choice, it makes all those millenia of fighting, worth \nit.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;  The thoughts rolled through his head. The light in the middle of \nthe\n&gt; room showcased his ideas. Perceptor looked up from his work, in \nfront of\n&gt; him were four Autobot shells newly created where to be implanted \nwith\n&gt; sparks. It was a time for great joy, as this would signal the first\n&gt; online of an Autobot, who did not need to ingage in war, if they did \nnot\n&gt; want to. The creation Matrix had been brought out of the main \nsecurity\n&gt; system for this joyous ocation. Even though Optimus Prime had died\n&gt; fighting Galvatron, his dream for peace, and a new breed of Sentient\n&gt; Autobots was to live on. Perceptor turned to look around, Ironhide, \nwhom\n&gt; the matrix had recently brought back to life, along with Prowl, the\n&gt; Protectobots and Red Alert had brought it in safely. Although they \nwere\n&gt; in an era of peace, there were still small bands of Decepticons on \nthe\n&gt; loose, and the lose of the Matrix could mean the restart of the \ngreat\n&gt; war. Perceptor had a sigh of relief, as the dreaded thought left his\n&gt; mind, Motormaster had been put behind bars. Shockwave had disapeared \nfor\n&gt; a very long time, Scorponok was disabled, Starscreams&#39; ghost gone, \nand\n&gt; Megatron. Perceptor shuddered. One creature, would always be known, \nfor\n&gt; restarting, the great war, and invigorating the Decepticons, into a \nnew\n&gt; age of violence and destruction. All of that was hopefully behind \nthem. \n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to the rest of his staff. First Aid, Grappled and Hoist \nhad\n&gt; all helped create bodies for these new Autobots, and they were \nanxious\n&gt; to see them at work, and many of the other Autobots were simply here\n&gt; because this was something they fought for. Except Grimlock, \nPerceptor\n&gt; was right, he would have problems adapting to a life without \nconflict,\n&gt; as the massive warrior leaned against a wall alone, brooding. \nPerceptor\n&gt; shook his head, and addressed the Autobots.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Fellow Autobots, today is a speacial day, where Optimus Prime&#39;s \ndream\n&gt; will be realised.&quot; Perceptor said joyfully. Bumbelbee and Gears \nlooked\n&gt; up, suprisingly enough Gears had a smile on his face, that is until \nJazz\n&gt; and Cliffjumper screeched into the lab, both transforming. He turned \nhis\n&gt; head. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Your late.&quot; he whispered, but spat the words like a knife. Jazz \ncould\n&gt; only smile, about to laugh, but Cliffjumper shot back a nasty look, \nand\n&gt; pushed his way forward. Perceptor continued.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Today, four Autobots will come on line, and will be given the \nchoice,\n&gt; of weither or not to join the diminished Autobot army. This will be \na\n&gt; first in over 20 million years.&quot; Perceptor gleamed. He was going to \nmake\n&gt; Scientific history. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ahhh, quit talking and get this show on the road.&quot; Ironhide \nbursted,\n&gt; hardly able to hold down his anticipation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor frowned, but quickly began to smile again, this day could \nnot\n&gt; be ruined. &quot;Then if First Aid will assist me.&quot; Perceptor asked, as \nhe\n&gt; jumped up, transforming and shrinking into his Microscope mode, \nlanding\n&gt; on a platform just above one of the Autobots heads. First Aid \nplanted a\n&gt; small chip in the Microscope, and it Perceptor implanted it in the \nfirst\n&gt; robot. The robots eyes opened, and Perceptor beamed again. \n&quot;Autobots,\n&gt; meet Flask.&quot; he said, as the newly born Autobot looked around\n&gt; hesitantly. The large sea of face was a little overwhelming, but \nsoon\n&gt; enough, the smiles on Autobot veterans made him feel at ease. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;H..High everyone.&quot; he said smilling sheepishly. The platform \nPerceptor\n&gt; was on came to life, and shifted to the next Autobot shell, a much\n&gt; smaller robot, as the precedure was duplicated. &quot;Meet, Crossroads.&quot;\n&gt; Perceptor chimed again, as Crossroads simply looked the crowd over, \nthen\n&gt; looked like he was taking it all in, and analyzing the data.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cliffjumper nudged Ironhide, &quot;I wish Prime could see this.&quot; he said, \nas\n&gt; Ironhide added, \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeahhh, this would have made him bust.&quot; Ironhide said, with \nfondness in\n&gt; his voice. &quot;I wonder what these two will choose to do with their \nlives.&quot;\n&gt; T\n\n\n"}}
