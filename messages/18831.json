I just need to talk to you about \nwhat&#39;s going on.&quot; She motioned for him to take a seat in a chair next \nto her&#39;s.  She got up, closed the door to her room, sono one else \nwould hear her, and say back down.  &quot;&quot;Well, here&#39;s the update. I \ntalked to Aracnia, and instead of her giving her group up and giving \nme command.  We will create the new Predacon Counsil.  And now I have \nfound out that the Ark, the maximal ship, has now been destroyed.  So \nour future is now up in the air.  I will send Destructor and a few \nothers to help with the reconstruction of the base. Normally I \nwouldn&#39;t help the maximals, but if I didn&#39;t, then I don&#39;t know how \nmuch longer you,&quot; she smiled at him,&quot; or the others would survive.  \nBut at the same time, we won&#39;t just give our help either.  Once the \nark is rebuilt, then  as payback, I shall have the maximals aid us in \nhunting down Megatron and destroying him.&quot;  she took a deep sigh.&quot;and \nI&#39;m keeping you here. I...I can&#39;t let you go.  I know it&#39;s not what a \npredacon leader would do if she was thinking correctly, but, I can&#39;t \nrisk all my best soulders.  And I...I can&#39;t risk you.&quot;  she looked \ndown and sighed. She was having trouble now.  She knew that having \nDrillbit so close to her like this clouded her judgement of command.  \nShe would have to have him under another, just for command purposes. \nBut then again, she wanted to be close to him. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He heard her response, and walked to her room. He opened the door \nand\n&gt; stood there.\n&gt; &quot;Hello, buetiful.&quot; He walked up to her, and gave her a light kiss.\n&gt; &quot;Looks like commands getting to you. You should rest.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
