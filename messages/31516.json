He knew by now the shields were up and the shots wouldn&#39;t\nhurt anything but if there were other attackers it was up to him to prove\nhis faith by defending the Maximals in any way he could.   His distraction\nnearly cost him as Zoes shots struck him.(What type of weapon is Zoe\nuseing?) The scales on his face protected him but the shots reminded him of\nwhat the cost of distraction was.\n\nHe lifted his mighty foot and stomped on the ground sending a shockwave in\nthe direction of  Zoe and Slayer. His whole body was a physical weapon and\nhe knew how to use it well.\n\nHe&#39;d lied about being a leader but knew that the faction at the Black\nFortress was behind his decision for the sideing between the two teams\n&quot;MegaTON to Black Fortress, I need any available Predacons to assist me at\nthe Cybertronian Fire.&quot; he shouted. In his mind he could handle this alone,\nhe was after all the &quot;invincible&quot; fighting machine. He just figured that a\nshow of force from the Predacon side would be more convincing.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, March 31, 2001 11:09 PM\nSubject: Re: Megatons chance for glory.\n\n\n&gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt;\n&gt; Slayer jumps back, but Megaton&#39;s teeth still dig into his armor a little,\ntearing out some plates as he pulls back.
