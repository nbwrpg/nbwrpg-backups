Go&quot;\n\n\n&gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus listened to Optimus. He was out of the times.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: It&#39;s a different era Optimus. Maximals, \nPredacons, and the \n&gt; &gt; Tripredacus are the main factions. Autobots and Decepticons, \nsuch as the three \n&gt; &gt; of us, are ancient.\n&gt; &gt; When optimus talked of crushing enemies, Rodimus knew something \nwas wrong.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Listen to yourself, Optimus. You never taught me \nto &quot;crush&quot; \n&gt; &gt; enemies. You taught me to do what was right.\n&gt; &gt; When Optimus mentioned Magnus, Rodimus became angered. He knew \nit was a lie. \n&gt; &gt; Magnus had been killed by him.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus watched as Optimus flew off.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: I guess thats it. When the three of us meet next, \nyou know it&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; be war.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus transformes to car mode and heads back for the base.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime(via comm): Yggdrasil, I&#39;m done with Optimus. \nWhat&#39;s going on at \n&gt; &gt; the base?\n&gt; &gt;  thedachande1985 &lt;thedachande1985@y...&gt; wrote:::Optimus Prime:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;      He stood up, ready to see his old &quot;friends&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;      &quot;Welcome, Rodimus,&quot; He said, &quot;Welcome..Hydra. I see that \nthings \n&gt; &gt; have changed in my absence. But, no more worries, things will be \nput \n&gt; &gt; to rights.\n&gt; &gt;      &quot;Which is what I have come here to discuss, All these \npathetic, \n&gt; &gt; weak factions. Where are the Autobots and Decepticons of old? \nFrom \n&gt; &gt; what I have learned in the data disks, that I stole, there are \nmany \n&gt; &gt; smaller factions here. The NWO? The Tripreds, even the Maximals \nand \n&gt; &gt; Predacons; what are all these things?\n&gt; &gt;      &quot;You two are the leaders of some prominent groups, Rodimus, \nyou \n&gt; &gt; act as though I taught you nothing,&quot; He walked over to him, and \n&gt; &gt; placed his hand on his shoulder, as he had left his gun on a \nripped \n&gt; &gt; apart stump. Secretly he had placed a bug on his shoulder, very \ntiny, \n&gt; &gt; about the size of a freckle. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you crushed those that \nseek \n&gt; &gt; to rip your faction apart?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;      He let go and walked to Hydra, &quot;And you, although part of \nyou \n&gt; &gt; may have killed me long ago, you have fallen from your vaunted \nseat. \n&gt; &gt; You have had to merge with the new Megatron. Galvatron not \nenough for \n&gt; &gt; you?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;      Prime held Hydra&#39;s upper arm, and placed a bug on it.\n&gt; &gt;      Then he turned and walked away, back to where he had \nbegun. &quot;I \n&gt; &gt; have crossed galaxies to put things to right here,&quot; He bent down \nto \n&gt; &gt; grab his gun, which he promptly attached to his leg.\n&gt; &gt;      &quot;You are both free to go,&quot; He said, then smiled at \nRodimus, &quot;Oh \n&gt; &gt; yes, one last thing...You both remember Magnus, right? Well, he \ngave \n&gt; &gt; his life to bring me back, and look at how well his wish was \ngranted!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;      He transformed into his truck mode and lifted off, flying \nright \n&gt; &gt; over Rodimus&#39;s and Hydra&#39;s head.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (OOC: The bugs are simple tracers, they won&#39;t do much more than \n&gt; &gt; say &quot;Hey! Rodimus/Hydra is here!&quot; Detected easily enough, with \nthe \n&gt; &gt; right equipment, which most bases would have. Removal is easy \ntoo.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
