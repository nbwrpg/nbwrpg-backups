He hadn&#39;t \nheard, seen, or picked up any signals entering the atmosphere, \nand he can&#39;t remember anybots named Wingspan. It does occur to \nhim that he hadn&#39;t been created for long before he&#39;d been launched \noff planet, and he hadn&#39;t gotten to meet all of the Decepticons. He \ncontinues trying to fix the central console in the base. He thinks to \nhimself, &lt;I&#39;ll run a traceroute program on this frequence, and locate \nthe bot, when I get the console fixed.&gt; He sends an encrypted \ncommlink to all Decepticons, who he knows are a part of the \nfaction, &quot;Decepticons, do NOT respond to that unknown message \nfrom a bot calling himself/herself &#39;Wingspan&#39;, I&#39;d like confirm his \nvalidity, with Lord Megatron&#39;s permission of course.&quot; He frowns, \nMegatron was still suspicious from the Motormaster incident, this \nmight help smooth things over a bit. He continues working on the \nconsole, he is almost finished.\n\n\nOn 12 Jun 2001, at 19:43, LurkerAbyss wrote:\n\n&gt; ::Hakibuscon::\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hakibuscon approached the Decepticon base with caution,\n&gt;     transforming to robot mode.
