Let them think \nthat they can get away with trying to extract pleasures from me. Not even \nknowing that all I&#39;m here for now is for a meal. But I can play their little \ngames, let them think they have the upper hand.\nAs long as I can feed without threat of the supply running it ...all is \nwell.\nBut she smiled at Bloodystrikes words and leaned towards him just a little.*\n\n&quot; Hmm...yes, a good idea indeed. Lead on, Reptilica.&quot;\n\n* And with that she simply follwed the males, her stomach growling in \nanticipation all the way.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
