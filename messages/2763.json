He had attacked me earlier, him \nwinning the fight.  Upon Suukie&#39;s arrival, Suukie ignored the pleads, gripped \nStinkbomb by the throat, then threw him back to the ground.  Stinkbomb then \nopened fire, obviously confused, unfortunately so did Stuukie, and they both \nfell.  I then left to the CR chambers, crawling.  When I got out and got some \nweapons from the armory just in case, I came to find Suukie opening fire on \nan unconscious Stinkbomb.  Afraid for my friend&#39;s life, I opened fire on \nSuukie, who had somehow been repaired from powerful laser blasts to the head, \nthen that weirdo,&quot; he said, referring to Plintissa, &quot;came in and &quot;rescued&quot; \nhim.  Helping him escape justice.  Justice not being killing him, I was \ntrying to knock him down so I could try and restrain him.  And I&#39;m sorry if I \ngot confused, but  when arriving here, there weapons drawn, and facing you, \nand that other person, I jumped to the conclusion you two were under attack, \nma&#39;am.&quot; he said, pointing to Zenyak (not knowing he was a Predacon), still a \nlittle amazed at the ginormous beast mode.  \n\n\n"}}
