We have been covered by\nsome sort of explosion!&quot; A strident voice came over the com systems.\n\nThe voice over the link was OPTIMUS PRIMAL\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a grunt from DINOBOT.  &quot;No.&quot;  he paused, then again went to\n&gt; consider.  &quot;let the Autobots and Maximals deal wtih it.&quot;  THen another\n&gt; thought.  &quot;Set off the explosives you hvae on top of the ones that alreayd\n&gt; went off.  That will bury them extgra well and give us more time for our\n&gt; assignment.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In total fairness, setting off an explosion even when one had already gone\n&gt; off was totally acceptable tactical procedure.  They had the bombs, why not\n&gt; use them?\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a pause from the the communication, &quot;Who is that giving us\ncommands there?&quot; RIPPERSNAPPER said to HUN-GRR via comlink. &quot;That\nsounds like Dinobot. But I heard he was dead.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah.&quot; BLOT&#39;s voice came over. &quot;Didn&#39;t Megatron kill him . . . twice?&quot;\n\nHUN-GRR looked completely baffled as he struggled to figure out\nsomething to say. Obviously something wasn&#39;t right.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
