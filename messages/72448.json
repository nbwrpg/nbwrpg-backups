It was not much, but it would do in a pin=\r\nch.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I have the co-ordinates.&quot; SANTON said as he held up the devic=\r\ne. At a&lt;br&gt;\nnod from LEO he began to read them, &quot;320.25 by 7218.60 Vector 1=\r\n87.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nHis words were cool and calm as he read them off.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Everyo=\r\nne have them?&quot; LEO said as he looked around. &quot;You fliers are&lt;br&gt;\ngoing to h=\r\nave to stay in the air, while we ground pounders are going&lt;br&gt;\nto be here i=\r\nnside the jungle. We will be heading for the same&lt;br&gt;\nlocation.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nL=\r\nEO PRIME straightened, &quot;Maximals, MAXIMIZE!&quot; he said as he shifed&lt;br&gt;\ninto =\r\nhis beast mode, that of a yellow and brown lion, his roar echoing&lt;br&gt;\nacros=\r\ns the jungle, and at the same time the Fuzors, SANTON and WING&lt;br&gt;\nCALIBER =\r\nchanged form as well.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Noctorro, Airhammer, Wing Caliber try to ke=\r\nep an optic on us from the&lt;br&gt;\nair, but if you loose sight of us, get to th=\r\nat location and try to&lt;br&gt;\nfree the others. You know the mission. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nLEO PRIME&#39;s voice was nothing if not deep and more resonant. &quot;Any&lt;br&gt;\nfur=\r\nther and we will loose communications. Does anyone have any other&lt;br&gt;\nquest=\r\nions before we head in?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSKY SHADOW had watched silent all this in=\r\n silence, his optics on&lt;br&gt;\nHYDRAS and LEO PRIME. He did said nothing to LE=\r\nO, instead he whispered&lt;br&gt;\nhis own orders into his radio, his voice whispe=\r\nr silent, his own&lt;br&gt;\nrations carefully stowed away.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nPreston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-25--886219575--\r\n\n"}}
