Four legs could carry faster than eight. As he \narrived, he transformed to robot mode, and looked around and the \nbattle. He couldn&#39;t count how many there were. He found his own spot \nnear Dark Mouse, who he finnally got to.\n\n\nTerrorsaur soared above, not absolutely clear what the battle was \nfor, but battle was battle, and it had to be fought. He was Predacon. \nFighting was his obligation. He transformed to robot mode and readied \nhis gun.\n\n\n"}}
