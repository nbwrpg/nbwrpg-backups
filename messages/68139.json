Attempting to utilize his stealth shielding against the internal weapons systems, he appeared as almost invisible to them, only his need for speed alowing them time for the occasional lock on him!\n\nMeanwhile at the nexus center where he had been the computer, as per his last instruction it continued in a cycle the command to open the base doors and raise the base out of the magma, even as Perceptor gave the orders to the contrary. Hopefully that would slow down his pursuers and give him time to escape!\n\nFinally he arrived at the shuttle bay, the place he had arrived from, he stopped to look around carefully. High up in the room his initial small spider spy he had placed here before he left positioned itself on the main doors, hopefully hidden from view.\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  \nFind them fast with Yahoo!
