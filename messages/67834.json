He\n&gt; &gt; spoke with them, listened to them. They had =\r\nbeen ravaged by the\n&gt; &gt; uprising the Iron Skulls had lead and viewed Jotunn=\r\n&#39;s demotion as a\n&gt; &gt; candy punishment. The perpetrators, the soldiers thems=\r\nelves, had\n&gt; &gt; barely been chastised for that, and resentment was strong be=\r\ncause of\n&gt; &gt; this inaction among the surviving population.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He agree=\r\nd with them, and told them they should get even in one way or\n&gt; &gt; another. =\r\nLike a prophet, people took him to heart and remembered him.\n&gt; &gt; He was hop=\r\ne for the wounded, the hope of recovery and vengeance.
