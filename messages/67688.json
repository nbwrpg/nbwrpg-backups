One of\nthem is looking towards the distant city as they speak amongst\nthemselves. \n\n&quot;All of you know what to do. I don&#39;t have to reiterate it here.&quot; the\ntallest of the figures spoke, his form strong and resolute. &quot;Find out\nwhat you can about the target, relay it to the others and prepare to\nacquire it on my command.&quot;\n\n&quot;What about the cybers in there?&quot; says a strong female voice, who&#39;s \nwhisper still had to be stiffled. &quot;Won&#39;t they object to us?&quot;\n\n&quot;Unlikely.&quot;  a deep blue armored figure spoke up, his military bearing\nobvious both in his voice and stance as he crouched in the shadows\nlooking at the distant city in view-finders, &quot;We have no rank or\ninsignia, and our identities are largely unknown. Infiltration should\nnot be difficult.&quot;\n\n&quot;*If* our intell is even correct.&quot; Spoke up another female voice. She\nshifted position and for a moment the shadows parted to reveal a\nportion  her crimson armor before the darkness enfolded her again. &quot;It\nis old now.&quot;\n\n&quot;That it what we are here to find out.&quot; says the first voice, gruff and\ncommanding, quite obviously their leader. &quot;Get in, find out what we can\nfind and get out. Nothing more and nothing less.&quot; He turned to look at\nthe others. &quot;Any questions?&quot;\n\nSilence answered his question.\n\n&quot;Good.&quot; He activated his com panel and opened an encrypted channel,\n&quot;How is the terrain, is everything in readiness?&quot;\n\n------------------\n\nFrom his position much nearer to the quarry a dark figure looked from\nthe shadows, his shielding protecting him from the prying optic as well\nas the errant sensor. &quot;Prepare yourselves.&quot; his whisper silent voice\nemanated over the channels. He paused and looked around one last time,\npassive scanners seeking anything out of the ordinary ....\n\n\nOOC: Is there anything we should know about the Bushido base before\nentering???\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
