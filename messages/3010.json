It crashes \nthrough many trees and comes to rest against a large tree.  The bot inside \nstarts to stir.  The hatch opens and a bot slowly emerges from the pod.  She \nin her Kodiak Bear form slowly climbs out of the pod and stands on all fours \nnext to the pod.  She looks around and sees the damage done to the forest by \nthe pod landing.  She sees the green trees and blue skys above her.  She \nsniffs the air and smells the forest and the sweetness in the flowers that \ngrow along the path. She smiles and thinks how she was lucky to land in such \na wonderful place.  Then suddenly she feels weak.  Her legs give out from \nunder her and she collapses.  She looks over and sees darkness creeping in \non her.  She goes unconsious.*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
