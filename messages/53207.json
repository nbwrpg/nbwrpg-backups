Trying diplomacy.\n\nGesper: Are you nuts?!? Since when have you been a diplomat?!?!\n\nHad he been there, she would have knocked him unconscious. He was\nlucky this time.\n\nBelthassan: All right, but keep it very, very soft.\n\nMelchana: Roger. Kick monkey for me.\n\nShe jumped down to the metallic floor and landed with a little noise.\n\nMelchana: Hey, you can show up. I know you&#39;re there. I&#39;m not here to\nhurt you unless you ask for it.\n\nThere was a reason Gesper and Belthassan had been reluctant to let her\nplay the diplomat. She was a hunter before anything and she knew it.\nShe was better with her claws than with her tongue.\n\n\n&gt; Stopping dead in her tracks, she heard something. Being a Decepticon\nRecon \n&gt; agent didn&#39;t mean for her to take any little thing lightly. \n&gt; \n&gt; She listened, her hearing different than what she was used to. She\nwas able \n&gt; to .. smell, as well. Odd,.. another thing she was not used to. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cautiously, she stepped forward very slowly with each step. She\ncould tell \n&gt; something was nearby. Her clear blue eyes glanced about. Taking one\nstep at a \n&gt; time, slowly. She would be on alert, ready to defend or attack if\nshe were \n&gt; jumped. She cursed being in this form. In her warrior form, she was\ndangerous \n&gt; enough & could lay waste nearly anything that was within her path.\n\n\n"}}
