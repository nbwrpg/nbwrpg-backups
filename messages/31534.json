He\n&gt; curled his wings around himself deflecting the first series to strike him.\n&gt; Knowing that most projectile weapons were useless against his scaled hide he\n&gt; took most of the abuse\n&gt; \n&gt; Groove raised his photon pistol, firing off two bolts at Megaton&#39;s torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; Two more shots struck him from the direction of the CF. &quot;Well now isn&#39;t this\n&gt; just wonderfull first the Maximals want a ceasefire and now they&#39;re ending\n&gt; it.&quot; He thinks assuming that it was friendly fire. This was one of the\n&gt; shortest ceasefires in Transformer history. . He could feal the abuse\n&gt; wearing on his scales so he transformed to his T-rex form shrinking down\n&gt; allowing the remaining dozen or so of Scattershots  armor piercers travell\n&gt; toward Slayer and Zoe next to him.\n\n\n"}}
