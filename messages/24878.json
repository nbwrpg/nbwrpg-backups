He \ncomes upon a battle.  He saw the bot who smelled of evil (Galvatron) fire on \nanother bot whom he recognized as Megatron (He&#39;s a hermit but not entirely \nuninformed.)  &quot;No matter,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;I will have to stop him \nanyway.&quot;  He flies into the battle stopping a short distance away from \nGalvatron.  &quot;Are you ready to die oh unholy one?  I hope so.&quot;  He raises both \nof his hands over his head accumulating energy from the air around him.  The \nenergy coalesces into two large balls at the ends of each of his hands.  He \nlaunches both upwards into the air ground.  They stop above Galvatron and \nflatten into disks.  The disks rotate around each other over Galvatron slowly \nbecoming one disk.  Enertron screams &quot;MAY THE WRATH OF THE HEAVENS STRIKE YOU \nDOWN!!!!!&quot;  He lowers his hands bringing a cylinder of destructive energy \ndown from the disks.\n\n"}}
