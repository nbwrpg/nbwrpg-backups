He hoped someone would \nanswer. He stood in the forest hoping to get the attention of someone. (Just \nso you guys know he&#39;s not bigger than a normal sized Transformer, he&#39;s like \nfirst season Primal big.) He transformed into Ground assault mode and went \naround to see where the doors are, soon he found them. He Transformed back to \nRobot mode and walked up to the doors.\n    The doors scanned him and then they opened as if they recognized him! He \ncouldn&#39;t understand this at all, he had never been here before why would they \nrecognize him. Now thinking this was some form of trap he backed away, very \nslowly. \n    He pressed a button on his arm. &quot;Umm...If any Maximals pick this up \nplease come and find me, my name is...&quot; What is my name? He couldn&#39;t \nremember, the only thing he could think of was Prim-He couldn&#39;t remember the \nrest, but looking at this place and how primal it is he decided to be Primal \nfor the time being.\n    &quot;My name is Primal,&quot; He said into the comm. Now he waited for a Maximal \nto pick it up and come and find him.\n\n"}}
