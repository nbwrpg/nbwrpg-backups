She was a tall, black and silver bot. She had a silver mouth plate that went from below her eyes to above her chin that went to a sharp point in the center. She had red glowing eyes and a slim face. On her shoulders was her horse head from her beast mode set in halves. She had black fur around her torso and upper legs. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She knelt down to look at Quickstrike. He was an odd looking thing. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;I don&#39;t like his eyes, &lt;/EM&gt;she said. &lt;EM&gt;There&#39;s something going on inside. &lt;/EM&gt;She titled her head left and right, staring at him. His little face was motionless. His eyes kept staring down at the ground.&nbsp; Wildfire jerked her head to KitKat. &lt;EM&gt;Show me what happened. You can replay what you saw in that cave. Do that for me. I may be able to show you what&#39;s happened to him. Just image it in your mind. I will catch it.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;From: logomorph@... &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Date: Fri, 28 Jul 2000 18:23:56 -0000 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;::KitKat:: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&quot;We came from a cave in the forest. Quckstrike and Stringtra were &lt;BR&gt;&gt;there. Rowdy and I found Stringtra being held out of a pond in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt;cave, by a strange, long and skinny tentical like arm. It let her go &lt;BR&gt;&gt;and we started snooping around. Terrorsaur and Drillbit dug and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;found a chamber inside the cave. A strange wolf like bot was &lt;BR&gt;&gt;standing there.&quot; She looked at the CR chamber. Maybe that&#39;s what it &lt;BR&gt;&gt;is. You see, the creature had Quickstrike held down by wires, cords &lt;BR&gt;&gt;and such. But I have no idea what happened to him before we got &lt;BR&gt;&gt;there.&quot; She whimpered, &quot;I just hope he turns out OK.&quot; She layed down &lt;BR&gt;&gt;on the floor and licked her paw. She would wait to use the CR after &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Quickstrike was out. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
