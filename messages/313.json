He made a promise to himself \nthat when he got back and after the battle he would try and catch up on his \nsleep, if he had time.\nDinobot looked back at Tavatron, she looked mostly recovered and he knew \nthat she could now climb the cliffs.\nHis own repairs had been completed before the command from Liono and he was \nnow ready for battle.\nDinobot then began to walk towards the cliffs, he looked over his shoulder \nat Tavatron but turned back towards the cliffs.
