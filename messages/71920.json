He was like VICE GRIP, massive and tall=\r\n, but not as tall as\n&gt; HYDRAS or CRYOTEK.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Predacons.&quot; CRYTOEK said as=\r\n he stepped up to look at them much like\n&gt; an artist gazing with pride on h=\r\nis won work. &quot;Scan him carefully Vice\n&gt; Grip and Dinobot, you will that thi=\r\ns Hydras bears Megatron&#39;s spark.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nOOC - this post is being done =\r\nunder the assumption that since Hydras is the combined spark of Beast Wars =\r\nMegatron and Galvatron, it would not explicitly register as Megatron&#39;s, but=\r\n different.  And since VICE GRIP is not a technician nor does he have a lar=\r\nge scale sensor net, I&#39;m assuming he won&#39;t be able to tell such a delicate =\r\nscan.  If I&#39;m incorrectin assuming this, just say so and before responding =\r\nto the post I will consider it &#39;voided&#39; and as such will rewrite at a later=\r\n date!  So, just say so if I misresponded and I&#39;ll assume the post didn&#39;t h=\r\nappen and will rewrite!\n\n&lt;IN CHARACTER&gt;\n\nAt this point, DINOBOT merely smir=\r\nked over at HYDRAS, &quot;Yes, I suppose one would say you are Megatron.&quot;\n\nAnd t=\r\nhen VICE GRIP brought out his scanners, hissing over at INFERNO, &quot;I know no=\r\nt who you are, but on CYBERTRON we Predacons fought for the destruction of =\r\nthe system, and the Megatron I knew would be LOATHE to make himself the roy=\r\nalty!&quot;  A bit far off, perhaps.\n\nAt this point, VICE GRIP went over to poin=\r\nt his scanners at HYDRAS, but his records of MEGATRON being two time travel=\r\ns, two spark bindings, and the numerous other alterations MEGATRON had unde=\r\nrgonpe in the BEAST WARS made MEGATRON&#39;s far different than the leader&#39;s sp=\r\nark he had instilled on Cybertron.\n\nVICE GRIP hissed, &quot;It reads FALSE.  Now=\r\n, I suggest you explain what MAXIMAL trick this is before I am forced to ge=\r\nt angry wtih you all.&quot;\n\nDINOBOT casually walking over towards VICE GRIP, &quot;S=\r\nhall I deal with the bufoon for you, LORD HYDRAS?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
