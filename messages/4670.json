She liked the evening time \nand enjoyed flying at night.  With her owl mode, it yearned to fly at night. \n  She spotted movement in the trees and used ehr telescopic vision.  She saw \nwhat looked like a wolf.  She flew downward and landed on a brach above the \ncreature.\n&quot;Hello and how are you on this fine night? You look lost, need help in \nfinding your way?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n------Original Message-------------\n&gt;From: cyberwolf4@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: The great North\n\n&gt;Lunarpine stares at the stars above in the moonlit sky.

As a wolf he yearns for\n&gt;companionship, for the hunt. Here he sits, a lone wolf in search of a\n&gt;pack. A lost beast willing to sell his spark for some answers.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
