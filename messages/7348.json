Megatron is the leader of our pack. There are is a \nmouse who runs the computer. You&#39;ll like her. Quickstrike has a girl \nnamed Stringtra. She&#39;s a nice girl.  There a few bots however that \nI&#39;d keep a sharp eye out for.  They are brothers. They talk a good \nfight, but it&#39;s all talk so as I&#39;ve seen.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to put to \nmuch info out for this new wolf.  He may have been a friend of \nQUickstrike&#39;s, but she was still a little wary of the newcomer.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Rowdy Wolf:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf galloped at a pace that was smooth for him. He tried to \nkeep up \n&gt; with KitKat the best his short-legged beast mode would. Dire wolves \nweren&#39;t \n&gt; the fastest, but he was skilled on stealth. He used it several \ntimes when he \n&gt; hunted out in the plains.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Is there something I should know when I arrive?&quot; he asked \nKitKat. &quot;Perhaps \n&gt; a certain situation?
