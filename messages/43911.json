He smothely floated in front of SKullgrin,\n&gt; facing the assault warrior. &quot;Return to base Skullgrin, but be careful.&quot;\n&gt; He then turned and began to soar towards the battlefield again, keeping\n&gt; his optics straight on Triggerhappy. &quot;Firestrike, are you all right?&quot; He\n&gt; asked the perplexing Decepticon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
