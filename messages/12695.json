He pours a beer on his head. Blender laughs and\n&gt; pours a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beer on Rizopas&#39; head. He looks around to make sure nobody is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; watching them. Stronghold leans up against a tree, making funny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sounds and peeling an apple down to nothing with his finger!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Land Mine and Time Bomb leave the base in shame, why did this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always happen to them? Whatever, they had to find KitKat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;KitKat left because of us, I know it!&quot; Land Mine said. She was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crying again.

Blender and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stronghold stood up, Rizopas stood up and walked in front of them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Time Bomb and Land Mine both stared helplessly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ilike Rizopas alot more than I liked Arrow, so let&#39;s let\n&gt; Rizopas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; live!&quot; Blender suggested to Stronghold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, we just kill the 2 pansies!&quot; Stronghold said, pointing at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Time Bomb and Land Mine.
