And Tucson&#39;s strategy is derived from a TF Cybertro=\r\nn episode where in order to defeat Unicron, Optimus and Galvatron realized =\r\nthey needed to team up to defeat him.  Till All Are One, was the theme of t=\r\nheir. battle and thus Tucson has also come to a similar conclusion.  It app=\r\nears insane but it was something that had to be done despite the concern an=\r\nd dislike of the strategy.  It wasn&#39;t an easy decision to make but Tucson s=\r\nhowed a great courage in doing things off the beaten path.  It&#39;s very obvio=\r\nus that Rodimus is showing his weakness of self doubt which he&#39;s projecting=\r\n off of Tucson, who will have no part of such negativity.  It&#39;s not that he=\r\n hates Rodimus it&#39;s the fact that he knows Rodimus can overcome his apprehe=\r\nnsions if he puts his mind to it.  So of course Tucson will sort of give hi=\r\nm a swift nip at his backside in order to get his message across to Rodimus=\r\n.  \n\nBut he too has a weakness, his beastly temper which he has had through=\r\nout his life.  The temper of a creature who&#39;s breath can melt mountains, su=\r\npposedly.  The dragon was sort of Tucson&#39;s birth sign and it was no surpris=\r\ne that he would become one later on in life.  \n\nSo it appears the two Prime=\r\ns are at their greatest test.  They must both help each other to overcome a=\r\n lack of self confidence and learn to do things off the beaten path and at =\r\nthe same time, learn to quell a temper who&#39;s effects could have highly dest=\r\nructive consequences.  Good thing Leo Prime came into the picture because a=\r\ns Rodimus and Tucson learn their hardest lessons he is there to keep things=\r\n stable between the factions.\n\nSo this is getting very interesting indeed. =\r\n It may take a while but eventually things will work out for everyone.\n\nPer=\r\npetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Aug 11, 2011, at 7:48 AM, Su=\r\nper Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; OOC: He was passing bene=\r\nath Waspinator, on his way toward the dinosaurs.\n&gt; &gt; Sorry about the mixup.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: No problem.
