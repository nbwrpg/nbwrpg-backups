Come back to base and we can talk about this,\nthere&#39;s no reason that you should be turning yourself in to the Preds...is\nthere?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She growled as she left her intercom open for Plintissa to answer, oh\nplease don&#39;t let her say that she had betrayed them or worse!\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed with concern, she hadn&#39;t known Plintissa for long but\nshe knew enough to hope that she hadn&#39;t betrayed them.
