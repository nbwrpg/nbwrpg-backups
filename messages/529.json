They were \nthe autobots on the Ark (with the matrix and everything :), the maximal&#39;s \nonly weak poing. :) She smiles. If they didn&#39;t have to worry about them, \nthey could all fight much better. She smiles again. :)\n\nShe presses several buttons on her wrist and the platform starts humming. \nShe pushes several more buttons and the autobots dissapear. :)\n\nShe grins and turns around. Only she would know where the bots are and only \nshe knew how to get them back. She walks back up to Tygerhawk. &quot;Ok, now \nwe&#39;re all ready.&quot; She says, smiling.  :):)\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
