Perhaps I have missed a\npost or two, but I thought Remus was still back at Maximal HQ? I am not\nsaying he cannot be here, but I just want to be sure I know what\nhappened so I can post the proper responses for the sweeps and such he\nflew through, from the looks of it without stopping. I would think he\nwould have to be moving quite fast to know what Rodimus and Cyclonus\nwhere up to and be able to react with the speed that he did. Remember\nCyclonus has only come to the water front last post - perhaps in the\nlast minute or so. Before that Cyclonus was in combat with Ravenchief,\nmoving swiftly across the city. Again I am just trying to be sure of\nthe details before I post a response.\n\nThanks\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n--- Nic &lt;warriorazure@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; After Rodimus had spoken, a rain of laserfire swept at Cyclonus. A\n&gt; moment later, Remus calmly arrived at the scene and interposed\n&gt; himself\n&gt; between the leader and the hunter. He said nothing, but his eyes\n&gt; shone\n&gt; an unearthly yellow-gold color.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
