Not as big as the Iron Fist....nothing \nwas as big as that monstrasity. This ship was just big, and credited with its \nbulk size to its many victories, that is before it became grounded on \nprehistoric earth.\n    &quot;The dissection of the engines will be difficult. We wont be needing them \nwhere were going. Ive already drawn up the plans for the Marine Thrust \nSystem, with its speed we should make excellent surprize time.&quot; Tarantulas \nsaid, holding the blue prints of the Sub as the other two looked on.\n    Hell Beast noted, &quot;Also, we wont need half the rooms and equitment in the \nship. Once we move all that out it will give us a chance to make the Sub \nmanuverable. Labs, holding cells, computer systems.....all that can be placed \nin storage at Kitkats base.&quot;\n    Tarantulas nodded. With that gone, it would be smaller. And with the new \nwepon implacements installed, it would be a half bad fighter. What most \npleased him were the Torpedo Launchers that were in the works. Even Megatron \nsaid how fantastic they were.\n    &quot;Hehehe, yes. Lets begin the dissection. The shuttle is on its way.&quot; The \nspider said, turning skyward to the long shuttle, designed for hauling heavy \nequitment, came into view.\n\n    Rampage gazed outward across the ocean waves. The sparks from the welder \nburned a little, but the breeze eased his sting. The platform was nearing \ncompletion. He stopped and looked behinde him at the platform.\n    A large grey metal platform jetted out of the beach and shollow ocean \nport. They had slapped it together for the construction of the submarine. \nInferno and Tankkor paced back and forth, double checking the work the had \njust done. According to the plan, the shuttle would land soon.\n    &quot;Inferno, stop dawdling and make sure you have all the bolts tightened. \nClear?&quot; He boasted from his upper position. Inferno looked up, and did as he \nwas told.\n    Once agian, he turned to the waves and the blue sky. Off in the distance \nlay kitkats base and a hive of angry, vengeful, and egar Predacons that were \ngoing to win this thing.\n\n"}}
