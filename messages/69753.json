He wished he still had his o=\r\nptical sensors working because a drive through wilderness wasn&#39;t a drive un=\r\nless you could fully take in the scenery.  But now was not the time for wis=\r\nhful thinking.  \n\n&quot; That&#39;s why I wanted to wait until I arrive at the Ark K=\r\nup.  I&#39;d like you and Elita to be there when I tell you the news.  Tell Eli=\r\nta that I won&#39;t let her down.  No matter what happens, she&#39;s got me on her =\r\nside too. She&#39;ll remember me, old slow poke.&quot;  \n\nUpon hearing Elita in the =\r\nbackground, Tucson&#39;s heart sinks as he bares to think what he has to tell h=\r\ner.  For a moment he goes silent. \n\n&quot; My - estimated time of arrival will b=\r\ne two hours and thirty minutes Kup. I&#39;ll talk to you all when I get there. =\r\n Elita, if you can hear me, old Slow Poke says hi and he&#39;ll see you real so=\r\non.&quot;\n\nHe breaks the contact just before his voice breaks somewhat.  It was =\r\nhard to tell that he was feeling a great sadness in his vehicle mode, yet i=\r\nt was there.\n\n&quot; Primus, how on Cybertron am I going to tell her the news wh=\r\nen I know how sensitive Elita can be?  Lord Elder, if anything could hurt m=\r\ne a great deal, it&#39;s giving a child the terrible news that both her parents=\r\n were abducted by Predacons and Decepticons and turned against their factio=\r\nns.  Slag it!  Why didn&#39;t I succeede the first time?! Now I have to go back=\r\n there and tell them I failed in bringing Rodimus and Nightlight back to th=\r\nem.  It hurts Lord Elder, it really, really hurts.&quot;  \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;choose your words wisely=\r\n, my friend&quot; said Kup by comlink &quot;Elita is watting news for her parets and.=\r\n..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;uncle Kup????&quot;said a tiny background vioce &quot;who is it, Uncle? is =\r\nlord  Elder?

He wasn&#39;t much for burning ru=\r\nbber needlessly, and always took caution instead of wrecklesness when it ca=\r\nme to his driving habits. Right down to signalling a right turn when it cam=\r\ne time to turn right, and keeping his speed at a reasonable clip. When he f=\r\neels the ground beneath his tires become rough, he shifts into manual gear =\r\nto activate his all wheel drive system, and is careful to take it easy thro=\r\nugh rocky river beds. Water splashes up over his cab, as does mud. But it d=\r\noesn&#39;t bother him in the least.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I wish I could say enjoy the ride, m=\r\naybe one of these days I can. According to my transmitter, we&#39;re quite a bi=\r\nt a way from the Ark.. Estimated arrival time says about three hours... I w=\r\nish I could get there sooner but if I go too fast, I&#39;ll kick up dust, and t=\r\nhat&#39;s a dead giveaway. This way, if I stick to moist ground for most of the=\r\n journey, and if I can help it, through grassy plains, I may be able to avo=\r\nid being seen. So far I think sticking to water ways is best. No dust, no p=\r\nrints, no scent, no can track.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He continues to buffer his and Lord El=\r\nder&#39;s signatures so is to appear that they are not even enroute to the Ark.=\r\n While he travels, he taps into the Ark&#39;s com link.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Kup, I&#39;m sorry I=\r\n didn&#39;t answer your question earlier, I&#39;d rather tell you in person to not =\r\nrisk any information getting in the wrong hands. The less info we put out i=\r\nn the open the better. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carrol=\r\nl &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Gazoontite.

We can cover more ground that=\r\n way. Plus, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve done any form of off road driving =\r\nand if we keep off the main roadways, no one will ever suspect that we&#39;ve g=\r\none back to the Ark instead of taking the bait.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Elder =\r\nlooked at the shuttle thoughtfully, resting a hand on it. &quot;Hmmm&quot;\n&gt; &gt; he sai=\r\nd finally, &quot;That might not be a bad idea.&quot; He depressed a few\n&gt; &gt; controls,=\r\n trying to lock it down. Of course no lock is perfect.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He looked b=\r\nack at Tuscon, who had transformed into his vehicular mode already.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; He transforms into his SUV mode and opens his door to Lord Elder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;So who wants shotgun?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With one last look back at the shut=\r\ntle Elder slid into the proffered\n&gt; &gt; door that Tuscon held open. &quot;Let&#39;s go=\r\n. We have a lot of things ahead\n&gt; &gt; of us.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Don&#39;t forget, thi=\r\ns is millions of years into Earth&#39;s past.
