No one joined this RPG to read tons of insults and \ncomplaints coming back and forth. Thecode, KSLawdogg has a point. Your emails \nhave had moding in them recently, and saying that you will ignore damage is \nalso moding.\n\nPlease email me with further complaints.\n\nTo everyone else: Wrestling chars are not against the rules of everything. \nWrestling is just a form of combat. Once again, ignoring damage would be \nmoding. If Thecode wants to have wrestling chars, he can, just as long as he \nfixes his moding.\n\n"}}
