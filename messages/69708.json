All is in readiness.&quot;\nWith a deft touch Lord Elder laid in the coordinates and entered the\nsecurity codes that would open the doors to the outside world.\n\nWith a huge click and rumble the Ark doors slowly slid open to allow\nsunlight and various bits of debris to enter into the room. For a\nmoment the outer shield flickered as it opened a hole, just large\nenough for the shuttle to pass through, one that would close as they\nexited it.\n\nLord Elder looked over at Quickstride, &quot;Take us out young Maximal. Let\nus see how much of a distraction we can be. When we get there we can\nfire on the base, hopefully that will give Rat Trap and the Autobot\nTuscon and window of opportunity to escape.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: Feel free to utilize the shuttle if you folks can&#39;t wait till Monday :)\n\nPreston\n(Lord Elder)\n\n"}}
