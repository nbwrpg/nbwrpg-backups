The fangs were less than a few inches \nfrom peicing his neck. He had a urge to kill him there and now, but \nhe wanted revenge to be fun.\n\nHe walked in the base, with the female raptor reluctantly following. \nHe went to the CR room, throwing Rattrap into a chamber. \n\n&quot;Ah&#39;ll deal wit&#39; ya later,&quot; he said low, and closed it. He walked \nback out, leading the way through the corridors, to Black Arachnia&#39;s \nlocation.\n\n&quot;Who is your leader again?&quot; the female raptor asked.\n\n&quot;Black Arachnia,&quot; he replied. &quot;Ah&#39;m &#39;er second in commmand.&quot; He \nfaintly heard her say something, but couldn&#39;t make it out. He turned \none more corridor and called out, &quot;Hey sugar-bot, ya oughta hear \nthis. That bot out there wasn&#39;t Dinobot--&quot;\n\nThe giant female behind him snarled ferociously, just enough to sound \nlike she was going to attack him. He spun around.\n\n\n"}}
