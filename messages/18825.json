He angrily pushed through the flames, not\ncaring about his well being, he was going to smash this bot! He pushed\nthrough the burnign agonizing flames and moved close to Pyro, firing off a\nlarge missile from his back (Like Bonecrusher) at Pyro.\n\n&gt; Hiss fired off three fusion blasts at Stronghold&#39;s left knee from his\ncannon.\n\nStronghold never ecen knew it because of the burning flames, but the fusion\nblasts smashed into his leg.\n\n&gt; Scavenger fired 25 explosive shells from his rifle at Shapredge.  Turning\nto\n&gt; see the grenades, he jumped to the side, doing a cartwheel as the grenades\n&gt; explode.  He lifts his left arm, blocking all the shrapnel and laughing.\n\nRizopas throws a charge to each side of Scavenger, hoping that he&#39;d run into\none if he tried to escape, since he couldn&#39;t fly.\n\n&gt; Dark Claw fired off two more missiles from his attack vehicle mode at the\n&gt; Mafia base.  He would put the squeeze on that pathetic base.\n\nBase damage: The base is struck but nothing much happens, but the last small\nautoguns fall off, only 2 large autoguns remain, but they fire at the\nAlliance.\n\n\n"}}
