Bots like him were exatly what had kept the Maximals back\n&gt; throughout the Beast Wars. While leaders were considered weak, they\n&gt; were hampered by the bots that spoke out against them, and could do\n&gt; nothing but indeed be weak. Prowl could feel the dissapointment from\n&gt; Iron Raptor, and hear her thoughts, and that didn&#39;t improve the\n&gt; situation.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Don&#39;t worry, my love, you&#39;re faring better than Liono did. They can\n&gt; yell at you, but they are under your command, and as long as you make\n&gt; good decisions, they will remain so.- He replied to her, looking at\n&gt; the Maximals. He watched several of them report in, and then looked\n&gt; at FZ. There was little doubt why the Alliance had gotten the upper\n&gt; hand in the war: the Maximals were slow to rally.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster approached Iron Raptor, saluting with his one remaining hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Kluster reporting, Ma&#39;am!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Behind him, a battered Grimmler also saluted. &quot;Grimmler reporting.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; A nearly-dead Proto stumbled into the cluster of Maximals, also\n&gt; saluting. &quot;Proto reporting, commander.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Firearm walked back to the Maximals around IR, also saluting\n&gt; her. &quot;Firearm here.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; FZ looked over at the Maximals, shaking his head. It was no wonder\n&gt; they had failed to defend themselves at this battle, not with them\n&gt; being so divided. He watched calmly as one of their number began\n&gt; preparing for an attack.\n&gt;\n&gt; FZ activated his comm to Iron Raptor&#39;s frequency. &quot;You do realize\n&gt; that if your troops continue to fire, mine will be forced to destroy\n&gt; your base?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Closing the link to IR, he opened one to Deemos. &quot;Deemos, would you\n&gt; mind telling the Chosen Ones to stand down? The battle is over, we\n&gt; have won, and I&#39;m negotiating us getting some troops back from this.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Closing that connection, he looked around, waiting.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
