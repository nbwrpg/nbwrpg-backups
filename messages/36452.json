The ship then flys above the Destrocons and \n3 laser cannons lock onto each of them. Inside the ship the floor \nopens and Gemini 1 and two step out and hover in the air between the \nshield and the ship. The scorpion tank then aims at the Destrocons \nwith all of its weapons.\n\nSkywarp: &quot;These &quot;trainers&quot; belong to us. Get in our way and you die.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
