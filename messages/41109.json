(with the exception of Cyberwolf I guess) Well... \nI think one of the biggest reasons is that you can&#39;t, CAN&#39;T, \nunderstand instructions, it just doesn&#39;t seem possible. I asked you \nto hold the posting with the Rocak, but nope, you posted. I asked \nyou to refrain from posting with OOC messages, and that there is a \nmessage board at the site, but nope, you just keep posting with \nOOC&#39;s. I asked you a simple question about your email address a \nwhile ago, and you insulted me. Do you really want to make \nfriends?

Nodding to Axis, the\n&gt; &gt; thanks him, and proceeds to make her way between missile craters and\n&gt; &gt; other obstacles on the battle charred ground in front \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; the Chivitron base. Heading towards Windlord, she waves to try to\n&gt; &gt; get his attention.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lokk stops and turns slightly to regard Grounded, his face grimly\n&gt; &gt; showing agreement. &quot;Yeah... that will be ugly... ugly be necessary.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He keeps heading back to the base, his path taking him towards\n&gt; &gt; Windlord.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Dewboy, your poll (the one below) needs to be altered. First\n&gt; &gt; off, Zardus doesn&#39;t alter or delete biased polls that aren&#39;t \n&gt; offensive. \n&gt; &gt; Secondly, he doesn&#39;t alter, and hasn&#39;t altered, biased polls so \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; represent the opposite bias (though i believe that it depends on\n&gt; &gt; who&#39;s point of view you are coming from.). If the poll isn&#39;t \n&gt; offensive, \n&gt; &gt; then Zardus most likely won&#39;t delete it. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Next thing. Did you read all of my post entitled &quot;Dewboy&quot; (post #\n&gt; &gt; 41061)? If so, I will ask you again, did you read all of my post\n&gt; &gt; entitled &quot;Dewboy&quot; (post # 41061)? If you still answer Yes, then I\n&gt; &gt; will ask you for the last time, did you read all of my post \n&gt; entitled \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Dewboy&quot; (post # 41061)? Since you posted for your characters \n&gt; &gt; finding the Rocak ship, the answer to my question is obviously no.\n&gt; &gt; Now you&#39;re going to have to hold (this time, don&#39;t actually post)\n&gt; &gt; your posts regarding the Rocak ship. Then you must send the council\n&gt; &gt; a detailed list of weapons, capabilities, size and \n&gt; capacity. \n&gt; &gt; Ok? =)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Last thing... Ok, I&#39;m done for now, until I think of something else \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; say. =P\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On 30 Jul 2001, at 11:19, nbwrpg@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Enter your vote today!
