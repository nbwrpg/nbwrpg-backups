Nobot messed with an\n&gt; assassin without some kind of reaction in store for them, and 9 out of 10\n&gt; chances it wasn&#39;t going to be a pleasant one!*\n&gt;\n&gt; ****************************************************************\n&gt;\n&gt; * Dinobot growled at Tavatron as she had walked away and towards the Ark,\n&gt; when she had looked at him the second time he knew that she had found\n&gt; something in him. Something...more.\n&gt; He reached down and collected his rifle, at least it was\nundamaged...unlike\n&gt; himself!\n&gt; Dinobot sighed and soon caught up to Tavatron, he slapped her in the back\n&gt; with his tail for her remark.\n&gt; He growled deeply...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Indeed, that IS a promise...smart alec!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * He then looked back towards the Maximals ship, it almost seemed to grow\n&gt; quiet now. The reason...he knew not.\n&gt; Dinobot looked down at the rifle in his hands but then wrenched as a sharp\n&gt; pain suddenly caught him by surprise, it seemed to be coming from the\nexact\n&gt; place in which Scourge had kicked him!\n&gt; He placed a clawed hand on his stomach, it was more tender then he had\nfirst\n&gt; thought. It almost seemed to start as a dull pain but then worked it&#39;s way\n&gt; into a feeling of utter excitation, as much as he was damaged he never\nwould\n&gt; have guessed that it was this much!\n&gt; But Dinobot wasn&#39;t one to cry out in pain at a mere glance, he could take\n&gt; it...for as long as he needed to!\n&gt; He breathed in deeply but even that brought discomfort, he then began to\n&gt; slow his breathing to a shallow intake...his chest barely expanding as he\n&gt; took in a little air at a time.\n&gt; Dinobot flexed his free hand and shrugged that shoulder, he was stiff and\n&gt; sore...not to mention the lack of food and rest.\n&gt; He snarled as the pain in his stomach first came to a tearful climax but\n&gt; then sighed as it almost seemed to fade away into nothing but what it was\n&gt; before...a dull pain. He would have started repairs...if he hadn&#39;t spent\n&gt; most of that energy repairing Tavatron...a small price to pay for the life\n&gt; of a fellow warrior.\n&gt; Dinobot glanced over at her, she had seemed to made a full recovery. That\n&gt; was good and it made this battle a little bit less hectic, just what an\n&gt; under-powered warrior needed after a battle and a secondary repair.\n&gt; He looked then at the Ark, but the battle was only a small thing...it was\n&gt; the war itself that mattered.\n&gt; Dinobot snarled and clenched his fist, the pain was back and with a\n&gt; vengeance...but that was not what mattered now. It was the survival of the\n&gt; Maximals and the survival of this planet that truly mattered!\n&gt; This was just a small battle...one that only made up a piece of the great\n&gt; war!*\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; You have a voice mail message waiting for you at iHello.com:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3555/10/_/_/_/957594036/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
