So we broke off - \nformed our own society, our own way of life.  Naturally, the \naforementioned councils branded us as criminals the instant they \nlearned what we&#39;d done.  But it was too late, and we started picking \nup recruits from all over the place.  We got established as more than \njust a fringe group when we latched onto an old pleasure cruiser and \nretrofitted it to this - the Rogue Star.&quot;  She indicates their \ncurrent surroundings.  &quot;We travelled far and wide, limited only by \nour own imaginations when we chose our destinations.  We met several \nalien races, and managed to incorporate their technology into what we \nalready had.  One of these called themselves the Shyft - that&#39;s where \nwe got our lovely little dissapearing act.  Now, how about you - I \nimagine there&#39;s more to your story then just coming here out of thin \nair looking for a friend.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yggdrasil follows and seats himself on the rather small chair.
