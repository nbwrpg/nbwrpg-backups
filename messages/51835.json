None of the \n&gt; characteristics, no faction, nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Yggdrasil was worried about the number of bases. Five?!? There \n&gt; were supposed to be only Maximals and Predacons here!

Computer, aim pod launcher on these \ncoordinates. \n&gt; Launch 15 seconds after my mark.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before anything else, he relayed a remote detonator for the ship&#39;s \n&gt; laser to his comm system. He then got in the assault pod and had it \n&gt; moved in the launch tube.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: Start launch sequence now!\n&gt; \n&gt; Fifteen seconds later, he was hurled down at sound-breaking speed...\n&gt; \n&gt; ...only two klicks away from Rogues&#39; ship.\n\n\n"}}
