(It&#39;s a habit of hers not to use her comm under normal \ncircumstances; telepathy is much more difficult to eavesdrop on.)\n\nThe Seeker increases her speed to maximum and soon reaches \nheadquarters.  If it&#39;s that important, then she has no wish to \ndelay.  Still, the whispering voices remain at the back of her mind, \nand that bothers her.  If there is indeed someone on this world with \nthat kind of power, it is of grave concern to everyone involved.\n\nChanging to robot mode, she walks inside, wondering what her \nunpredictable commander was up to now.\n\n(OOC: Lurker, before you get any ideas, this has nothing to do with \nSkullertron.  Her mental powers are every bit as potent and refined \nas his, and she could block out his influence at will.)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Galvatron was startled by the entrance of his mind. &quot;No there is \nno time for \n&gt; that now. We will investigate it later.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
