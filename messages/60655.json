Each wore a hood making them \nindistinguish=\r\nable.  On his left sat Deus, a heartless opportunist; \nin front of him sat =\r\nEx, a female bot who wished more than anything \nto know what the future hel=\r\nd; and to his right was his most fearsome \nally Machina, a warrior who want=\r\ned merely to live forever, and was \nwilling to do whatever it took to break=\r\n the prophesy that doomed the \nthree of them.\n\nSeer, however, was under no =\r\nsuch restraint.  He could not die, but \nnor could he leave his palace.  In =\r\nit destiny energy flowed through \nhim, he knew all possible pasts and prese=\r\nnts, and most futures, and \nexisted in all he could see.  Deus shuffled ner=\r\nvously, he was \nplanning a betrayal, and he knew Seer knew it, but he also =\r\nknew that \nhis betrayal was too small to bother with in retrospect of what =\r\nSeer \nwas trying to accomplish.  Deus&#39; companion would die, but he would \nl=\r\nive=85for now.\n\n\t&quot;The timelines are shifting wildly out of control,&quot; Seer \n=\r\nsaid, opening the meeting.\n\n\t&quot;Yes, but is it worth the risk to intervene an=\r\nd try and stop \nit,&quot; said Machina.  He had never been able to see beyond ri=\r\nsks, that \nwas why he was destined to fail at his overall purpose.\n\n\t&quot;We   =\r\nwill not stop it.  Because of this=85Neo Beast War the \npotential pasts and=\r\n presents are multiplying along with the future, \nbut we must gain more des=\r\ntiny potential in order to control it.  \nSome presents are shifting away, b=\r\necoming obscure.  Thankfully this \ncourse of events has provided us with an=\r\n ample source of potential.  \nAll actions in a past so distant are magnifie=\r\nd in the present.  By \nstealing the potential of even one bot who vaguely r=\r\nesembles a hero \nor villain we could very well achieve the equivalent of de=\r\nstroying \nOptimus Prime.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Master, I volunteer for this service,&quot; said Ex=\r\n.\n\n\t&quot;No!&quot; cut in Deus, &quot;I-I mean in such a time period the \ndestiny energy =\r\ncould magnify the potential for the prophesy of our \ndemise being fulfilled=\r\n.  We must send someone else.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Who else could be entrusted with such a t=\r\nask?&quot; asked \nMachina.\n\n\t&quot;I will personally vouch for Fortuneteller,&quot; said D=\r\neus with \nconfidence.  All three of the other bots at the meeting burst int=\r\no \nlaughter.\n\n\t&quot;You would send one of our lowest level deviners?&quot; asked Ex.=\r\n\n\n\t&quot;And your lover at that,&quot; said Machina.\n\n\tSeer laughed for a moment with=\r\n them, but then considered the \nidea.  He called on his prescience, and saw=\r\n the potential for his \nown ends.  Fortuneteller might think she was workin=\r\ng for Deus, but \nhe knew he could make her do whatever he wanted in the end=\r\n with a \nfew of Deus&#39; screams if she refused to comply with his will.  &quot;Ver=\r\ny \nwell!  She will go, and she will remember her prophesy `So long as \nyou =\r\npay the Seer&#39;s price, no Transmetal will take your life.&#39;  Now \nlet us sele=\r\nct the target we can gain the most by destroying.&quot;\n\n\n\tDeus kissed her, and =\r\nran his fingers through her hair.  &quot;I \nam yours,&quot; she said, &quot;what do you wi=\r\nsh me to do.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Go to Earth.  Bring me the destiny potential of the bot yo=\r\nu \nhave been ordered to kill.  Say he died before you got to him.  Only \nyo=\r\nu, I, and Seer will know.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;But Seer is the one who wants the destiny pot=\r\nential.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Yes, but he knows everything we&#39;ve done against him, and \nhasn&#39;=\r\nt acted.  Obviously we&#39;re necessary to avoid some future he \nwould prefer n=\r\not to face.  We just need to keep working.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;But I would break my prophes=\r\ny, and lose my inability to be \nkilled by transmetals.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Isn&#39;t it worth i=\r\nt?  Isn&#39;t it worth it for me?&quot;  He kissed \nher again.\n\n\t&quot;Yes, my love.  Yes=\r\n is it.&quot;\n\nOOC: O.k., I need a volunteer for Fortuneteller&#39;s quarry.\n\n\n"}}
