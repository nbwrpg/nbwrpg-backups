As it \ncrawls to 49,6 celsius to 49,7 and then to 49,8, the robot inside \nstarts to move. An arm, then a foot. Then the chest. And the head.\n\nThe eyes. They both open, revealing a ravenous and murderous fury.\n\nThe mouth. A feral growl echoes through the whole base.\n\nThe claws. Striking hard and fast, they bump and destroy the door.\n\nThe legs. The beast jumps onto CR chamber number 2 and perches itself \nthere.\n\nHis breath is quick, his teeth are bared, his fur is standing straight \non his body. He looks around, not distracted by the alarm caused by \nhis exit.\n\nBlackfang lives again...\n\n\n"}}
