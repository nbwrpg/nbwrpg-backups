Inside, Shadow Star\n&gt; deactivated 5 of the 6 \n&gt; cannons and their power went directly into the\n&gt; shields.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadow Star: The cannons are all down except one,\n&gt; Sir. The shields are \n&gt; now at 200% of their normal capacity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Perfect. Now, everybody hangs on to\n&gt; something.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ship started to enter the transwarp passage. It\n&gt; shook heavily and \n&gt; started to revolve on itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael fell on the ground, but managed to transform\n&gt; to phoenix mode \n&gt; and to fly in the air. Shadow Star grabbed a bar and\n&gt; twisted it due to \n&gt; the speed of the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;deltazero1&quot; &lt;DeltaZero1@h...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;ok sir&quot; talon said as he turned to face it and\n&gt; drove into the hole \n&gt; &gt; and out of sight\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
