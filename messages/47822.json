We\n&gt; steal the energon shelding device they&#39;ll inevitably have to use and\n&gt; force them to stay in Beast Mode constantly.  Then while they sleep\n&gt; the Beast Modes will take over leaving them helpless and at our\n&gt; mercy.  We can then use parts from there ship to repair our own and\n&gt; get the Pit out of here.\n&gt;\n\n{Talos}\nDeck 2, CR Chamber\n\nTalos considered Sunhawks words motioning him to relax. &quot;First we have to\nfind the stolen ship and deal with the predicons, as is we need some recon.\nSince the sensors are up at least for a certain range we should be able to\nspot any forces en route if they&#39;re within weapons fire range. Do some recon\noutside, recruit another bot or two if you need, try and find a good\nlocation for construction of a sensor enhancement tower, the longer sight\nand comm range we have the more secure our position will be.&quot;\n\n    Turning he adjusted the comm for a ship wide broadcast and finding\nrepairs already showing a noticeable improvement in the operations,\n&quot;Excellent work people, we have some scanning ability, comms should be\nrepaired fully soon and then we can get back to our primary mission. When\nfinished with your current activities report to the mess hall, I&#39;m sure you\ncould all use some energon and rest. That is all...&quot;\n\n    Looking back at Sunhawk, &quot;And you have your new orders lieutenant, a\nprime spot for the signal enhancer is extremely important. Hop to.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
