That was all that mattered.\n\nFinally, backing up until she was past Prowl, she charged the door and felt \nit snapp.\nBoth her and the door caved in on the other side, bracing herself as they \nboth landed with a loud metallic sounding thud.\nShe was free!!\n\nThen, without a second thought she charged into the hall and then looked \ndown it, most of the shadows hiding her appearence.\nHer breath was quick but she wasn&#39;t tired, still knowing that she had the \nrest of the ship to get through before she was completly free.\n\nWith a heave of her muscles and started at a dead run down the hall, taking \nbits from her memory to find the way out...which wasn&#39;t far at this pace.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
