Demise and EndBringer go into stasis lock, the rest of them\nstaying concious and beginning to get up.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNeody watches the base explode, his link with his two pods that he&#39;d\nsent being severed as they were vaporized. The ground under his feet\nshakes, making him fall backwards.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCrater dives down on the ground as the Trainer base explodes, debris\nflying over him, lots of it digging painfully into his back, severing\nhis spine. The damage war repairabe, though.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSlayer growls, turning around as Ignatius calls him a coward to see\nthe other Trainer being pummeled heavily by weaponfire. He sighs and\nflies down toward him, transforming into beast mode and concentrating\non approaching him so he could grab him with his feet.\n\n\n"}}
