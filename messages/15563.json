I assumed it would be the \nleast part with quills. But forget it.)\n\nTrainers\n\nWhen Prebon attempted to throw Spears into the way of the missles, \nQuills shot all over his body. This was luck however, because this \ncaused him to fall down and the missles to zoom over his body and \nexplode away. The removed most of the quills from his face, however \npainfully, and stared down Spears.\n\n&quot;Not a good thing to do. Now you are going to have a terrbile fate. \nTrainers! Become Tamron!\n\nIgnatius, Hammer and Bullet left there battle and ran over to Prebon. \nBlaze hissed at Snow Cat as she clawed at her, but was able to sink \nher teeth into Snow Cat&#39;s shoulder. She withdrew and went over to the \nothers.\n\n&quot;Now,&quot; said Prebon, &quot;You shall be with us forever!&quot;\n\nThe Trainers started to merge, to become one. When it was all over, \nthey were the great Tamron! They pulled out their great weapon, Tamer.\n\n&quot;I have seen pictures of you in Savage&#39;s memories,&quot; said Tamron, &quot;So \nI suppose you wondered how we go thim under control. It&#39;s simple. \nUsing this baby right here, we implanted a micro chip in him. Once it \nhits the surface, it auto-matically takes effect, making him a slave. \nNow yo probably think I&#39;m dumb for telling you all about this \nmachine. It doesn&#39;t matter. You will now be one of us!&quot;\n\nTamron shot a micro chip at Spears.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois lead Child into a small, way off room, where he sat him down \non a rock beside him. He put his hands on his face.\n\n&quot;Close your eyes, Child. You are now going to experience more joy and \npower than most people can ever dream of.&quot;\n\nVulois began channeling energy into Child.\n\n\n"}}
