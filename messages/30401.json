She found her way to \nthe bridge and looked around.  She noticed the communication consoles \nand security stations.  She saw the armorment data logs and supply \nlistings.  She smiled and started to study them.  If she was now \nunder command of Zardus, then she might was well be the best soldier \nhe ever had. And to be the best, one had to know everything about \nwhere they were, what was going on and how to best deal with \nsituations.  She was already a good leader, but now was her time to \nfollow another leader.  She studied and took notes on all she read.  \nAfter she felt like she had enough information for one day, she \nopened her commlink, &quot;Zardus, this is KitKat3, requesting an \nasignment.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
