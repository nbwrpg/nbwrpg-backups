If he is going to rescue him he knew he had t=\r\no be careful as to how to approach the situation.  He looks up at the rail =\r\ncar, and then to the insectile creatures with a calculating expression.  He=\r\n wasn&#39;t about to tell them what he was up to.  And like a true ninjabot, he=\r\n crouches, builds up the energy in his legs, and then springs up with kinet=\r\nic force, to attempt to grab onto the rail car to get him at least away fro=\r\nm the creatures to where he could plan his next move. \n\n&quot;Not on my watch.&quot;\n=\r\n\nIs the only word wispered from Tucson&#39;s mouth. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;ve al=\r\nready lost him twice, I will NOT lose him a third time!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tu=\r\nscon&#39;s voice bounces erilly off the different buildings, distorted\n&gt; and ch=\r\nanged somehow and then reflected back. Quite clearly Tuscon\n&gt; could hear hi=\r\ns own voice coming back, &quot;LOST . . . LOST . . . Lost . .\n&gt; . Lost . . . los=\r\nt . . . &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He narrows his eyes, and in a running start he =\r\ntransforms into truck mode, and rolls his tires swiftly over the ground,kic=\r\nking up dust beneath them. He was adament about reaching Rodimus and was no=\r\nt about to let anything get in his way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus, if you can hear m=\r\ne, keep talking to me. If we keep in touch with each other it will be easie=\r\nr to be reunited. Where are you? And what direction are you headed?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;=\r\nNew&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no response from Rodimus from radio or otherwise to Tusc=\r\non&#39;s\n&gt; call. All that he can hear is the background static of the\n&gt; communi=\r\ncation open lines.\n&gt; \n&gt; However he does hear something, a strange femenine =\r\nvoice that comes\n&gt; simultaniously over his radio and somehow from the air a=\r\nround him. One\n&gt; that sounds distinctly alien and yet all too familiar at t=\r\nhe same\n&gt; time. &quot;He is no longer yours. You are too late . . . . .&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ev=\r\nen as the voice was speaking a door on one of the manufacturing\n&gt; plants be=\r\neped. Under normal conditions the sound would have been so\n&gt; small so as to=\r\n go unoticed, but here on this silent and unmoving\n&gt; street the sound was a=\r\nlmost strident as with a rumble the door began\n&gt; to raise, revealing inky b=\r\nlackness inside.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; . . . . . I have given you his carapase,&quot; The voice=\r\n continued, &quot;but\n&gt; his spark belongs to the horde . . . . .&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; From the =\r\nshadows within three insect or spider like creatures stepped\n&gt; out, their c=\r\nlawed feet making high pitched scratching noises on the\n&gt; steel of the stre=\r\net. They looked like wicked, mishappen spiders with\n&gt; long claw like append=\r\nages. Thier bodies were all well armored colored\n&gt; in reds, yellows, and bl=\r\nacks - looking distinctly like Rodimus&#39;\n&gt; colors, even if a bit backwards a=\r\nnd darker. Each one stood twice as\n&gt; tall as Tuscon himself when in robot m=\r\node and much wider.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; . . . . . And now, so will yours!&quot; The voice fin=\r\nished and lapsed\n&gt; into silence.\n&gt; \n&gt; The creatures looked around as if sni=\r\nffing the air as they slowly\n&gt; began to orient on Tuscon!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Tu=\r\nsonc&#39;s radar gave him, not quite a ping, but a &#39;pull&#39;.\n&gt; Something that he =\r\ncouldn&#39;t quite make out was almost calling him.\n&gt; Above him, perhaps 50 fee=\r\nt in the air, an automatic magna-railcar\n&gt; moved along its track that would=\r\n take it through and eventually around\n&gt; the city. The hum of its supsensor=\r\n beams breaking the silence that\n&gt; lives on the open street. It was from th=\r\nere that the pull seemed to\n&gt; resonate.\n&gt; \n&gt; The insects so far seemed to b=\r\ne only noting Tuscon as the three began\n&gt; moving with surprising speed in h=\r\nis direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
