While he didn&#39;t have all the details\nregarding BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s skills and abilities, he could easily see\nfrom her acrobatics that she was quite skilled in hand to hand, the\nvery things she was seeking to engage him in.\n\nHowever he was no slouch either - he wasn&#39;t called KILLER PUNCH for no\nreason! As she came into closer range he pulled out a weapon that\nlooked to be a strange cross between a sword and an axe and held the\nlarge weapon in his right hand, while in his left he had a a shield\nlike device that resembled a dinosaur&#39;s head, most like the one from\nhis beast mode.\n\nIts shield quality of the beast head could be readily seen as he used\nit to deflect BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s attacks. He might be heavily armored and\nslower than the spider based Predacon, but he was seemingly well\ntrained himself.\n\nKILLER PUCH brought the sword/axe over his head and brought it down in\na deceptively clumsy attack. To the uninitiated it might look clumsy,\nbut to the expert it was a tactically designed feint that could become\ndeadly thrust or parry!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n\n\nOn 2/23/12, adamsafran &lt;adamsafran@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BAZOOKA, who had just regained complete control of his leg and hip\n&gt;&gt; actuators looked up at BLACKARACHNIA. He had just enough time to\n&gt;&gt; register her attack! He open his mouth in protest as one of her darts\n&gt;&gt; hit him and sent him sliding to the ground in a heap!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; GUILEDART turned to look at the BLACKARACHNIA as well and was caught\n&gt;&gt; full in the chest as well, the dart sliding in where his armor was\n&gt;&gt; weak. GUILEDART&#39;s optics flickered once and then a second time and\n&gt;&gt; then he too joined his companion on the ground.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However KILLPUNCH was nothing if not paranoid and he was fully\n&gt;&gt; expecting an attack of this sort. He merly turned to one side and used\n&gt;&gt; the device he had in his hand to smack away BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s dart,\n&gt;&gt; sending it flying into a tree - the tree immidiatly begining to wilt.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Sooo!&quot; He said as he turned back to orient on the large ebony colored\n&gt;&gt; spider. &quot;We let you live and you decide to attack us?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He smiled as twin blasters flipped open from his shoulders. &quot;Consider\n&gt;&gt; this an end to our ceasefire!&quot; He began sending round after round of\n&gt;&gt; energized &#39;bullets&#39; at BLACKARACHNIA!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Two of the &#39;unknown&#39; PREDACONS down, hopefully for the count as she leapt\n&gt; over to the side as her tree disintegrated, in robot mode now as she went to\n&gt; charge in towards KILLPUNCH acrobatically flipping to hopefully avoid most\n&gt; of his blasts, trying to get up ot hand tohadn range!\n&gt;\n&gt; BLACKARACHNIA was an incredibly deadly martial artist, who in the old days\n&gt; had been able to hold her own with most of the veteran BEAST WARRIORS!\n&gt; Trying to strike over from the side, using her gymnastics abilities to avoid\n&gt; his strikes, trying to outmaneuver the bulkier adversary to try and hti him\n&gt; over the joints again and again to try and cripple his limbs!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
