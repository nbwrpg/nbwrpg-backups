But didn&#39;t know what to do after that. This was just \nsomething beyond her programming.  She blushed and couldn&#39;t stop.  She felt \nbad because she wanted to make her commander happy. But beyond a kiss, her \nprogramming was incomplete.\n\n\n--------------Original Msseage---------\nFrom:   &lt;crow_lord@h...&gt;\nDate: Mon Jun 26, 2000 2:56pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nScorponok\n\nScorponok smiled at Darkmouse.
