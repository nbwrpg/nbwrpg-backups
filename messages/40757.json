As\n&gt;   she enters the CR room, she spots Burning Hammer on the ground\n&gt;   unconcious, &quot;Burning Hammer? Uhh, hello?&quot; She puts Trinity into an\n&gt;   empty (obviously =P) CR chamber, and starts the process knowing that\n&gt;   the small bot will be done soon. Then she turns to BH, &quot;Hmmm, you\n&gt;   don&#39;t look so good...&quot; She kneels beside him, and examines him,\n&gt;   looking for a reason for his unconcious state.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Meanwhile, outside the Chivitron base, Lokk is still hiding behind\n&gt;   the hill. He spots Windlord fighting close combat with Vampiza, and\n&gt;   grumbles, not wanting to shoot and damage his fellow Chivitron. He\n&gt;   picks out Apewing, and his twin chainguns unload half a clip each,\n&gt;   hoping to surprise the bot.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Axis peeks his head over the pod, and spots Speed Viper. He fires a\n&gt;   laser blast, then arcs a missile at the bot. Then he crouches back\n&gt;   behind the pod.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   On 22 Jul 2001, at 18:02, Roland the Last Gunslinger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; OOC: Mmmmmm YOU KNOW WHAT? ME TOO! WCW AND ECW!
