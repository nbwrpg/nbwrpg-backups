When I rule the world I&#39;ll \nabolish death or something (unless, of course, for those rebellious fools who \nwill dare to stand up to me).\n\nAbout the messed up order email things, I&#39;ve also been getting my emails in \nfunny order. If anyone else is experiencing this problem, you can go to the \nsite (http://nbwrpg.tripod.com) and click on &#39;messages&#39;, or just go to \nhttp://egroups.com/messages/nbwrpg. The messages will be in order there.\n\n::Prowl::\n\nProwl&#39;s eyes widen as Iron Raptor sets his broken wing, sending a jolt of \npain through his systems, the fact that she was leaning on his broken ribs \nnot helping too much to relieve it. He grins rather painfully at her joke, \nbeing too damaged and worn-out to think of a reply.\n\nProwl nods as Iron Raptor suggests to get repaired, taking a few steps as she \ntugs on his hand, and falling to his knees in pain as his broken ribs rub \nagainst each other. Shakily, he stands up, using Iron Raptor for support and \nholding his side with his other hand.\n\n&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s get to the CR chamber,&quot; he says through clenched teeth (due to \npain) to Iron Raptor, turning to look at Octociz.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll be ok,&quot; he says to the new maximal, &quot;Go see if any of the others need \nhelp.&quot;\n\nHis optics widen as he hears an explosion behind him, spinning around quickly \nand ignoring the pain in his side to see Nemesis&#39; missile hit the rock he had \nbeen leaning on moments earlier. He looks up at the sky to see the alliance \nmember leaving.\n\nProwl looks back at Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s go.&quot;\n\n"}}
