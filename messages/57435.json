Her\nblack scaly body was like a bad omen for the defenders. She turned her\nhead and saw Perceptor... Pathetic fool, she thought. Then, she\nfocused her mind on him and stirred up all the fears he had deep down,\nbut mostly the feeling of despair that comes before death.\n\nShe closed in and readied her talons...\n\nTyrael, though, shot once at Maxima then went for Hydras at a stunning\nspeed. He did not seem like it, but he matched his enemy on all\npoints. He intended for Hydras to know he was out for him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt; In a message dated 7/1/03 6:37:58 PM Central Daylight Time, \n&gt; airly2002@h... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Tripedocus want play with us, my dear&quot;hissed Hidras &quot;And I&#39;m willing \n&gt; &gt; to play with them&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Following Perceptor out to join the others, she heard Hydras.

Then turning her attention to the oncoming fire taking cover. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BlackStorm took a weapon and  left the base, looking for a target. \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor did the same\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As soon as, BlackStorm left the base, Hydras took a weapon and said \n&gt; &gt; cooly to Maximna &quot;Do you remember your commands about BlackStorm, my \n&gt; &gt; dear?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at him briefly. &quot;Yes.
