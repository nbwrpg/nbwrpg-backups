In the distance the Maximal ship also made its way to the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; location as well, it&#39;s boosters lighting up the swiftly darkning\n&gt; &gt; skie=\r\ns. It is only a few moments before it also arrives and lands, its\n&gt; &gt; landi=\r\nng thrusters blowing aside vegatation and debris and its landing\n&gt; &gt; gear d=\r\nesends.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The area is open all the way around and it is situated at =\r\nthe top of a\n&gt; &gt; hill, one that allows anyone standing upon it the ability =\r\nto see\n&gt; &gt; anyone coming from any direction. The Maximal ship has landed on=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; far side of that hill, a ramp extends, allowing the Maximals to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; disembark shold they choose to do so.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
