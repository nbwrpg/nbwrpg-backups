He followed her outside, &quot;He\nmade the right decision, your abilities give you an advantage we could never\nhave.&quot; He knew that she&#39;d never led before, but now she had an edge. If\nshe&#39;d stop thinking like a recon bot. &quot;I&#39;ll be at your side when the time\ncomes. I&#39;ve got confidence in you.&quot; he smiled and pet het along her back.\nShe was no longer a typical recon bot she was now a prototype for Veratis&#39;\nnew life. She is now stronger than she was, faster than she was, and even\nmore powerfull than she was. If she got her confidence up she&#39;d be able to\nlead as well as the rest.\n\nOOC did I tell you that Icebirds function happens to be mutant commander?\n\nBIC Veratis radiod ahead to the compartment where the maximal transport pod\nwas kept.&quot; Razor Claw, Ice, and Lunarpine will be there shortly.&quot;\n\nFoxfingers tinkered with the control settings. He knew better than to take\nchances of showing his face at the CF again without good reason. He&#39;d stolen\nfrom them and he was sure that they wouldn&#39;t be happy about it.\nHe completed the preflight checklist and doublechecked the coordinates, &quot;All\nset, they can lift off whenever they&#39;re ready.&quot;\n\nRazor Claw was outfitted with a DNA collector. The device was a probe\nextending from the hand, attached internally to a power supply box equipped\nwith transmitter, the information from anybody he touched would be sent\ndirectly back to Veratis. The plan was brilliant.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 27, 2000 1:34 PM\nSubject: (ALL MAXIMALS READ) Re: Why attack? / Maximal Meeting\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked at Veratis. She knew what he was thinking.  He was right,\n&gt; She could sent out commander faster with thought. She nodded. &quot;I\n&gt; won&#39;t say a word about who I am.&quot; she smiled. She was glad at the\n&gt; chance to see her old friends again. Even if she couldn&#39;t tell them\n&gt; who she really was. She looked at Lunarpine and RazorClaw.  I&#39;ll do\n&gt; my best.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She took the DNA collector and put it in her hip compartment.  She\n&gt; transformed into polar bear mode and walked out of the room. She was\n&gt; staring to get nervous. She had never been a leader. She didn&#39;t have\n&gt; what it took to be a leader. She was a recon bot. Not a leader of a\n&gt; team. She sighted. Why couldn&#39;t Veratis have picked another bot who\n&gt; had experience in this, like Lunarpine or RazorClaw, she thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked down the hall and stopped near the entrance. She wasn&#39;t\n&gt; really ready for this. But she didn&#39;t want to tell the others that.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers still has his comm programed for Maximal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers listens curiously as the call to report to the CF comes\n&gt; through.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Veratis, I know you&#39;re busy but I thought you might want to hear\n&gt; this.&quot; He\n&gt; &gt; replays the message for the four bots in the classroom, &quot;Give you\n&gt; any\n&gt; &gt; ideas?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Veratis stretches his back, slightly extending his bat wings. &quot;I\n&gt; think we\n&gt; &gt; should be included in this meeting, it&#39;ll give us the chance to get\n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; aquainted with our new associates.&quot; He tries not to think to\n&gt; heavily on the\n&gt; &gt; subject knowing that strong emotions could be read by Ice. &quot;I think\n&gt; it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; time to give you a field test.&quot; He looks over the three in the\n&gt; classroom\n&gt; &gt; surveying his possabilities. &quot;Ice, I&#39;m putting you in charge, don&#39;t\n&gt; tell\n&gt; &gt; them who you were or where you came from, I still don&#39;t fully trust\n&gt; anyone\n&gt; &gt; with my technology.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine stood up as if to voice his objections when Veratis cut\n&gt; him off in\n&gt; &gt; mid thought, &quot;Ice can pick things up in thier minds before they can\n&gt; react to\n&gt; &gt; it.&quot; Still seeing the need to justify his decision he continues &quot;Her\n&gt; &gt; telepathy can relay orders faster than either of you can call them\n&gt; out, and\n&gt; &gt; She will be able to cover your backs more efficiently than you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine didn&#39;t have to say a word, he knew that Veratis didn&#39;t\n&gt; mean\n&gt; &gt; &quot;could&quot; The old science bot was right when he assumed that\n&gt; Lunarpine might\n&gt; &gt; hesitate to cover Razor Claw. That one revelation put the choice\n&gt; into a new\n&gt; &gt; light. The wolf knew that Veratis had made the only logical\n&gt; decision.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Razor Claw stood and faced the old bot, &quot;What is  my role in this\n&gt; mission?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He had no knowlege of the Maximal units so he didn&#39;t know what he\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; offer the team.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You have the strength they might need if they get into a messy\n&gt; situation.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He checked what limited information he had on the new member of the\n&gt; team,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m placing you as Ice&#39;s bodygaurd, your shield can protect her if\n&gt; there&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; trouble.:&quot; He again checked his notes, &quot;You will all de given a  DNA\n&gt; &gt; recorder. Any bot you will come in contact with will be sent back\n&gt; to me.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve set the devices on a changing frequency to make it harder to\n&gt; trace.&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; looked to Ice again, &quot;Try to protect my prototype, I&#39;d like her\n&gt; returned in\n&gt; &gt; one piece.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
