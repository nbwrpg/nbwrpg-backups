Sure they can \n&gt; make a bot feel better when they are sick, but they also go boom \n&gt; really big. I don&#39;t want them to go boom.

Oh yeah, they can make a small little genayde and \n&gt; make the little boom be as big as a huge Warf head. I was told it \ncan \n&gt; make the boom so big it can make a whole base become trash.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
