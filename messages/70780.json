He was not aware of it, but his paternal instinct was \n&gt; now beginning to set in.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; With your father&#39;s help, and the assistance of the Maximals and \n&gt; Autobots, we&#39;re going to teach Hydras a lesson about stealing something \n&gt; that isn&#39;t his to begin with.

Hydras has gone too far and has paid no price for his actions. \n&gt; Those days are over.  He may think he has won, but this battle has not \n&gt; even started.  And I&#39;m NOT walking away without a fight.  Not this time. \n&gt; And not ever again.  He&#39;s done far too much damage and has even attempted \n&gt; to fracture a family, and emotionally harming an innocent child, by taking \n&gt; away the ones she loves the most.  That is my final straw.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks up to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; With a name like yours, it was bound ta come ta this sooner or later. \n&gt; You didn&#39;t get that name for nothing.  Even when you weren&#39;t a Prime, you \n&gt; were still as tough as nails, even if you weren&#39;t the largest Autobot on \n&gt; the team.  Rodimus is lucky ta have ya fighting beside him as a Prime. \n&gt; Now with the two of you putting your feet down, you&#39;ll have him running in \n&gt; the opposite direction with his tail between his legs, literally. And \n&gt; Rodimus, now that I think of it, As I do for Tucson, my weapon alt modes \n&gt; will also work for you in the event that Tucson is unfit to wield me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;She&#39;s right.  If anything happens to me, you are the one chosen to wield \n&gt; Straight Shot.  She will not let you down, her aim is impecable, and she \n&gt; never misses her target.

He&#39;s trying very hard to become one of us, but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there are a few of our comrades who do not have as much faith as we do.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Faith is important if we&#39;re going to combat Hydras.  We&#39;ll need it, and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you have that faith, so do I.  Come, I think it&#39;s time we had a talk \n&gt;&gt; &gt; with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the other Autobots and Maximals.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He gently carries Elita in his arm, and walks back into the room where \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kup\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and the others are.  His expression was quite serious at this point, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; yet\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not one that would indicate anger so to speak.

Faith.  We have that with each other, but when it comes to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; those\n&gt;&gt; &gt; who are trying to turn over a new leaf, I see a lack of it.  I can not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; stress enough on the importance of all around faith in each other.  If \n&gt;&gt; &gt; we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; do not have that, we are not ready to confront our worst enemy. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus\n&gt;&gt; &gt; would surely agree with me, that faith is of the essence, because at\n&gt;&gt; &gt; first, I too was distrustful of Rodimus once he had been freed of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; shell program.  But now I see where that distrust would have gotten me,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and I too had to come around and give faith a chance.  I know we can do\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that, we&#39;re Autobots and Maximals.  We believe in each other, and now,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; among us, is a Predacon who has shown great courage by helping us here\n&gt;&gt; &gt; now.  Please, do not let distrust weaken your faith.  It&#39;s what Hydras\n&gt;&gt; &gt; would want, to see us fall and I&#39;m not about to let that happen, and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; neither should any of you.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He stands tall, holding Elita in his arm.

Before I was rendered blind, we&#39;d do many\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; missions side by side.  Of course, him being Hot Rod, a sports \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; vehcile\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me, an average compact SUV, off roading vehicle, with no interest in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; speed, we&#39;d often kid each other about speed versus rugged \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; durability\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; over\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; off road terrain.  One day, we were driving toward a mission to stop\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Galvatron&#39;s path of destruction, when our path got blasted by \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unknown\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; enemy fire.  We knew we couldn&#39;t let a rock slide stop us, and we\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I knew I could&#39;ve just drove over it, and gotten to the other side \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problem. But Rodimus wasn&#39;t built for that in his alt form.  We \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; never\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; left\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; each other&#39;s side that day.  We found a way to get around that \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; obsticle\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; together, even though we had conflicting ideas on how to do it, but,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; eventually we did compromise and we thwarted Galvatron with the aid \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other Autobots.  Sometimes opposites work well together, and Rodimus\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; proved it that day.  I guess that&#39;s what drove me to rescue him. I\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t think of how I would manage, if I had not had him by my \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; side.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He gently rubs Elita&#39;s shoulders.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I wish I could remember what happened to Bumblebee and Spike, and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kremzeem, but after I was rendered off line for several vorns, I \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lost a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; good portion of my memory. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Like Rodimus, Tucson&#39;s gentile embrace takes on a paternal aspect. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; holds Elita as if she were his own.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; And don&#39;t you worry about your mother, Stanton will find a way to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bring\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; her back, I&#39;m sure of it.  But you also have to keep that hope alive \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your heart.  The more hope, the more chances of her healing.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson was now swapping his status to a more parental role.  It felt\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; good\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to be with Elita, and right at this moment, he wasn&#39;t about to trade\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; joy with anything else.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Elita:ow\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Elita took Tucson&#39;s Hand as a lost child seeking  a friend, she was \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; her\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; robot mode that had a strong look of Nightlight with the golden-red\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; colors\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Mom told me that story... and other ones...

But\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; most\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all Optimus, our paths appear to be the same, our values, our\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; courage,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; our strength and our faith in those around us. Are our origins\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; alike?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If so, is there a direction I should be going toward?

If anyone would know these answers, you\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He puts a tiny orb of his own spark into a container, and \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gives\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an offering to Optimus Prime.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The body and form of Optimus Prime remained absolutely still, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was no discernable movement from him, no spark of energy, no \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sign\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; recognition of any type. It could be that the Matrix energy that\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; had\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; been animate before has been temporarily used up, or perhaps the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; situation now was not sufficiently critical so as to call it \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; into\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; being. In either case Optimus prime looked, for all intents and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; purposes, as dead as any robot can appear and still be awaiting \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rebirth in another few million years.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
