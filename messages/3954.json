The last few days had been very stressful \non him and his team, they all needed a break. Unfortunetly, in war there were \nno breaks. :::\n\n::: A beep came from the door. It opened and in filed Marine, Gremlin, \nPheniox, and Transanulas. They entered and made themselfs comfortable in a \nsmall sitting area. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast rose with his drink and joined them. The motioned to the Dat \npads on a small table. They each picked them up and read the memo on them. :::\n\n::: Marine, the giant turtle bot who had apponited himself with the rank of \nGeneral, spoke first. ::: Commander Hell Beast, when is this project to be \ncompleted?\n\n::: Before Hell Beast could answer, Transanulas interrupted ::: It cant be \ndone! Its an insane plan!\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Spider, be quiet!\n\n::: He picked up a Dat pad and read what he had downloaded there earlier ---\n\n    Project Disrupt\nSelected Individuals: Team Leader- General Marine\nMain Technical officer- Transanulas\nAssistant Technical Officer - Pheniox\nDefense Officer- Gremlin\n\nOutline-\nProject Disrupt&#39; main goal is to disrupt and stop all communications of the \nNewmcomers. A tower sending out Eneron radiation on radio signals on the \nNewcomers communications band. With there communications placed on a halt, \nthey will have to manually deliver messages to each other and will not be \nable to over hear or spy on Predacon, Maximal, or Allience transmissions.\n\nSetup:\nUnder General Marines command, Transanulas and Pheniox will construct a tower \nwithin the winding caves of the great canyon. Gremlin will supply the defense \nsystems, which will include generator shielding, handheld pistols, and a \nsingle rechargable assult canon. \nConstruction will take three days and will be tested on the fourth. By the \nfith day the Disrupt Project will be in full swing and the tower will be \nrunning ull power. \n\nPersonal Note:\n&quot; Predacons, we wil lcrush the Newcomers and rape them of there resources. \nLet nothing stop you from building this tower. We will succeed. &quot;\n\n::: Hell Beast smiled at his work. Transanulas still had his doubts, but \neveryone else seems very optimistic. They left and began to pack. Later on \nHell Beast watched them go taking the supplies with them. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Marine looked at the construction site. It was deep within a cave and had \none small entrance which Gremlin was guarding with his generator shileding. \nTransanulas and Pheniox had begun the construction of the base, and for now \nMarine stood waiting for the first attack wich was inevitable. :::\n\n"}}
