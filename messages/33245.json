He stumbled back quite far actually, 5 steps \nis kinda far for a gestalt to stumble back from a normal heighted \nwarrior&#39;s perspective.  Abominus snarled meanly at Galaxor, then \nfired 2 beams from the lazer from his lower chest.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;        Surgital heard the lightning bolt, and quickly turned around \nand side-stepped just in time to avoid the lightning bolt by a speck \nor two.  Then, Surgital converted his hand into a saw blade again, \nand this time shot the saw blade at Lavatron&#39;s head.  (BTW, the blade \nwas shot vertical, so moving to the side gives a better chance of \ndodging it.)\n\n\n"}}
