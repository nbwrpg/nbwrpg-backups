I have a mission for him. I want \nhim, Venomus, and Solo to go to a disclosed location and retrive...well, I&#39;ll \nhave to tell him when he gets here with the others. Atma and Pursuedo will \nremain here with the rest of us in case of attack, but Aerostreak, Grappler, \nand Guantix will be dispatched if aid is needed.&quot; She said.\n\n"}}
