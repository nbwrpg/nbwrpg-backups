My name is Cerberus.&quot;\n     &quot;Hey, you kinda look like...Tom Selek,&quot; NightBlade said.\n     &quot;Umm..yes, that&#39;s nice,&quot; Carberus said. &quot;In anycase I am \noffering you a position in my Coalition. Right now my main goal is to \nassassinate Magmatron, the leader of the Destrons.&quot;\n     &quot;I&#39;ve heard of him,&quot; NightBlade said, she liked Cerberus, he \nseemed a good leader. She would aid him as long as it was \nuseful. &quot;I&#39;m in, does it matter that I&#39;m a....(She thought about the \nthree factions she knew about and choose)a Maximal?&quot;\n     &quot;Not to me,&quot; Cerberus said. &quot;We are a coalition, anybody can \njoin as long as they don&#39;t want Magmatron alive.&quot;\n\n     Dachande jumped from a tree and decloaked then. &quot;You want to \ndestroy Magmatron?&quot;\n     &quot;Yes, do you?&quot; Cerberus replied.\n     &quot;Good,&quot; Dachande said. \n     &quot;I know you, your Dachande, right?&quot; Cerberus said.\n     &quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Dachande said.\n     &quot;What happened to you?&quot; Cerberus said, &quot;You seem to have no \nbeast mode.&quot;\n     &quot;I&#39;ve had a change,&quot; Dachande said, eyes glowing. &quot;For the \nbetter.&quot;\n     &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; NightBlade said.\n     &quot;I&#39;m sure it is,&quot; Dachande said smugly. &quot;If you&#39;ll excuse me, \nI&#39;m going to find someone.&quot;\n     He turned and walked away, fading into cloak as he did.\n\n\nMagmatron:\n\n     &quot;The rest of you,&quot; Magmatron said to th remaining troops. &quot;Get \nwhatever you need now, we will reconvien in three hours and discuss a \nbase to attack.&quot;\n     Magmatron left the office and went into his private room, nobody \ncould enter without asking permission first. He commed \nGuiledart, &quot;You have 1/2 and hour to have a report on your progress \nof the machine to be on my desk.&quot; He closed the comm.\n     He turned to look at a screen, it was of NightBlade&#39;s optics, \nfor the bug he had installed on her accesssed her optics and hearing. \nHe heard the entire conversation.\n     &quot;Hmmm....so, Cerberus had recruited Dachande and NightBlade into \nhis little quest, goodie goodie.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
