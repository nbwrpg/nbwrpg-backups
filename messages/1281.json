She grunts in pain and looks up at the\nbodies of Ramhorn and Stinkbomb, lying out cold on the ground. Teltoli pulls\nherself up and walks over to Stinkbomb, deciding he is the lightest, and\nstarts to drag him across the battleground. She certainly couldn&#39;t drag a\nrhino!\n&gt;\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t resist taking a parting shot at Injector with her gun, but by\nthen she was too far away to hit and she knew it..\n&gt;\n&gt; (Attn to the creater of Stinkbomb and Ramhorn: I hope I&#39;m not moding, just\ntrying to help! Tell me if you want to leave them there or anything...)\n&gt;\n&gt; ----\n&gt;\n&gt; Kit dodges the kick from Sinesis and tackles him low in the stomach,\ndriving him to the ground. She pulls out a blade and tries to pull it up to\nhis neck..\n&gt; ______________________________________________\n&gt; FREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\n&gt; Sign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; eGroups members: $60 in FREE calls!
