Lets begin this discussion. Firstly, we need to\ncooperate\n&gt; fully with each other, otherwise we will get no where and this will all be\n&gt; for nothing.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Megatron ::: Indeed, this is a very important matter.\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Ominous Prime was in the middle of his first objective. He was going\nto\n&gt; kill Hell Beast. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Ominous tinkered with a Cyberbee, an old modle but still useful. He\n&gt; planted it with an energon virus. It would exploded and infect anybot\nwithin\n&gt; a hundred meters of it. They would die slowly, very painfully. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Ra ::: And your going to kill Hell Beast with that...thing?\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Ominous ::: Yes, and then his team will fight over the next leader and\n&gt; the Predacons will fall.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Ra ::: How much longer?\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Ominous hooked a wire to the bomb within, and the bee shot up and\ndarted\n&gt; out of the ship. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Set ::: That was fast....\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Ominous ::: It goes up to 90 MPH.
