He transformed to his \n&gt; sturdy looking robot mode and looked around. The air was clear and \n&gt; fresh. This was a virgin planet, untouched by the ravages of \n&gt; civilization... yet. The Cybertronians posed a great threat to \nthat. \n&gt; It had to be dealt with.\n&gt; \n&gt; That would be Lunekill&#39;s job. For now, he wanted to examine the \n&gt; Energon&#39;s quality. He lifted his fist in the air and took his \n&gt; momentum. He punched through the rocks and straight into a \ndeposit. \n&gt; Then, he grasped a big chunk of crystaline energon and took it \nout. \n&gt; Appraising it like a jewel-crafter looking at a finely cut \ndiamond, \n&gt; he lifted it to his mouth and engulfed it whole.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reaction was instantaneous and astonishing. It coursed through \n&gt; him as a power surge, making him feel like a powerhouse. Oh, did \nhe \n&gt; love this sensation of power! It was the first time he had ever \n&gt; experienced something as strong as this! It did not stop here, \n&gt; though, as he would have expected. The surge built in him until he \n&gt; could no longer hold it back, then, with a crackling of static \n&gt; electricity, he literally blew the top of the mountain off. He \ncould \n&gt; no longer control his power surge! His feelings were amplified \n&gt; tenfolds. He was enraged!\n&gt; \n&gt; No use for Lunekill, the Cybertronians would have to die now!\n&gt; \n&gt; He flew away and, sensing a group of Predacons, stopped. He lifted \na \n&gt; double pulse gun and fired, again and again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rockseeker: Die, you oversized crawlers!\n\n\n"}}
