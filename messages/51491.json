The message was relayed as soon as it was in range.\n\nSitting in a large chair on the bridge, the large bot that seemed \ncovered with spikes was massaging his forehead, eyes closed.\n\nYggdrasil Prime: Man, Talos, what have ya gotten into this time?\n\nHe spoke of his younger cousin that had ventured after Megatron.\n\nHe had just been ordered to go and get him back to Cybertron.\nOr to pick up what was left of the Maximal crew.\n\nHe activated the commline to the planet.\n\nYggdrasil Prime: Botanica, you there? Yggie on the line.\n\nBotanica: Yes, I read you. What is it?\n\nYggdrasil: Just received new orders. Maximal Iron Squad has to leave \nreally soon. Get them for me, please.\n\nBotanica: Yes, sir. What about the scientist group I lead?\n\nYggdrasil: Take only orders that come from Cybertron. It&#39;ll be safer \nfor you this way. Yggdrasil Prime out.\n\nThus, Botanica sent a message on planet for every member of the Iron \nSquand to meet up on the small station.\n\nOOC: There. Anyone is welcome. Just know that they are a special ops \nunit and they&#39;re Maximal &quot;assasins&quot;.\n\n\n"}}
