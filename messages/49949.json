Most animals didn&#39;t want to bother a \nmoderately large black bear, and Scryed didn&#39;t really want to be \nbothrered that much. She was enjoying the peacefulness of the \nsurroundings.\n\n&quot;Drat,&quot; she mumbles to herself as she steps into a muddy puddle \nwhich was hidden by some light brush, and that seemed to be created \nby a small brook which was slowly filling a small pool farther down \nthe valley. &lt;I&#39;d better get back soon, I&#39;m a little late for my \npatrol report, as uneventful as it was.&gt; Picking up her pace, the \nbear-bot trotted along carefully and emerged from the end of the \nvalley into sight of the Maximal Base.\n\nMoments later,\n\nScryed entered the base, and headed to the control room, looking for \nTalos as she wasn&#39;t aware that Talos was not in charge.\n\n\n"}}
