There was something out there, he knew it. If it was \nanother like the dire wolf, he would fight for his life and make sure \nit would end up like him.\n\nHe kept the reaper, and used it like a walking stick to test out the \ndeepness of the snow. At morning, the presence got stronger. It was \nreal and a living thing. \n\nPrimus! And a bot!\n\nQuickstrike turned to his defensive aggression. He saw a dark, large \nfigure slowly approaching through the snow. It spoke to him to run \nand escape, because she---she could deal with it. It was a deadly \nwolf she was looking for---Rowdy Wolf.\n\nShe sent images through his mind, something that spooked him, and \nsent his dizzy spells spiraling wildly. He nearly lost his balance.\n\nShe uged him to know who he was. When he did, she send madness \nthrough the air. He was the snake-bot with the herum to her when she \nfirst came around. He shot back weakly that he was not just a snake, \nhe was more than one ferious beast. There was no way she knew him. He \nshot back that he was a high rank, with only one female that was his \nmate and leader. \n\nShe remembered him as the snake bot with a screaming past. She sent \nback the image of the dragon that was Megatron.\n\n&quot;Shut up!&quot; he screamed. He tried to blank out his mind, to stop her. \n\nSooner or later, the bot approached him. It was a black horse-bot. \nHer name was Wildfire. Her mane was tangled and sticky from sap. She \nwas looking for Rowdy Wolf to kill him, but he beat her to it. \n\nThey spoke to each other without speaking. It was something that \nQuickstrike thought he could never do. It was something Tarantulas \ncould do, but he was actually speaking telepathicly with the help of \nthis horse-bot.\n\nHe touched her shoulder, then that was when the world came to him. \nNew feelings and sensations went through his mind and body. Wildfire \nbecame his link to the world.\n\n\n"}}
