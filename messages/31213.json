They&#39;ll need to get in and hit them \nfast.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a hard hitting blow, just enough to startle a \nfew and pull them away from the base.&quot;\n\n    &quot;We&#39;ve done some preliminary scans and there are defenses scattered \noutside.  These include stasis mines, armor piercing dart throwers, and laser \nturrets.  The most dangerous of these is the stasis mines because we can&#39;t \nafford to lose anyone.  The base itself is presumably shielded but the scans \nwere inconclusive.&quot;\n\n    &quot;I recommend having the detachment you loan us lure them into a trap of a \nfew of your stronger bots.  We&#39;d set and bait the trap ourselves but we&#39;re \nsomewhat lacking in numbers due to certain, recent events.&quot;\n\n    &quot;Once the detachment is on it&#39;s way away from the base, our troops will \nmove in and pick up the fight.  We shouldn&#39;t need any more help if the feint \nis effective.&quot;  Cygnar looked among the commanders and grinned sardonically.  \n&quot;By now I&#39;m sure you&#39;re wondering what&#39;s in it for your groups.  We have \nsomething to prove but you have no such need.  I offer my skills to you at \nany time you need a battle planned.  And, of the bots we are able to disable, \nhalf will be yours to reprogram and use as you please.  So does my plan meet \nwith your approval.&quot;\n\n"}}
