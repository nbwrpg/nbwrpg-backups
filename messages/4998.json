She hobbled to a tree near Quickstrike and crouched behind it. She \ntransformed into bot mode.\n&quot;OK pal, what now? I&#39;m hit and you don&#39;t look so good either.  That leg \nlooks preety bad.  Want to stand and fight or shoot our way out of this one? \n  If you can run, I&#39;ll cover you, but you got to take me with you.  I&#39;m \nleaking mech fluid and I could use a CR chamber about now.&quot;  She looked at \nhis leg.  &quot;On second thought, I&#39;ll let you have dibs on the chamber. But I \nget it after you.&quot;\n\nShe drew an energon rifle and returned fire.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll help you if you help me. Oh and by the way, I&#39;m KitKat. Pleased to \nmeet you.&quot;\n\nShe fired again at the spotted bot.\n\n------------------Original Message-----------\n\nFrom: Talon Harvilicz  &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\nDate: Tue Jun 27, 2000 2:39am\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\nQuickstrike/Cheetor:\n\nQuickstrike was surprised to see another bot coming out of the forest, going\nfor the Maximal. She sounded Predacon, thank Primus. He gave her quick eye\ncontact. She ran at the spot where Cheetor was twice. The third time, he saw\nhim rush out. He heard him growl, throwing his legs out to run. That was\nCheetor? But that thing was nothing but a pile of fur and spots.\n\n&quot;What in tarnation?&quot;\n\nBut after a few seconds some of it made some sense. Before the youth had a\nflight mode, being all metal, he was once a pure cheetah.\n\nHe ran after him. He fired at the youth, at his flank. But the shot went\npast him.\n\nHe saw the youth spin around and transform. He withdrew a gun and fired at\nthem. He fired at KitKat, then three times at himself. Quickstrike nearly\nstumbled. He almost lost his leg from the shot, but he managed to dash to a\ntree.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
