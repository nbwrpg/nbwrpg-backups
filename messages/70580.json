His optics are dim his mouth hangs open and\nslack. It is as if his spark has been snuffed out, erradicated. Then\nTuscon connected to him by port and flooded him with energies!\n\nVestige&#39;s optics brightened as his whole body began to glow while\ninside the cab, much like the glow that Tuscon himself was radiating\nin the other world. However where Tuscon&#39;s was a soft glow, this one\nwas like a cleansing fire, one that rushed out from Vestige&#39;s chest\nand optics and erupted explosively into the room.\n\nThe larger female insectoid that had been approaching Tuscon was\nknocked back and sent sprawling across the room, the other female\ninsectoids two hissed in anger and looked over at Tuscon. However\nthier anger quickly became fear as the tendrils that had been holding\nTuscon at bay were suddenly burnt away.\n\nInside Tuscon&#39;s cab Vesige smiled as he sat up, looking as if many\nyears had been taken from his frame. If he looked old and decrepid\nbefore, now he was looking much younger, more vibrant as he sat up\nproperly in Tuscon&#39;s chair, the reds and yellows of his armor\nreflecting the fiery light from the room.\n\nMeanwhile the two humanoid insectoids shifted into a spider/scorpion\nmode and began to rush at Tuscon, even as behind them the figure on\nthe bed began to stir and shift.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
