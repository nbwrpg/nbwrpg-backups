Be ready,&quot; Slayer replies to Ignatis, suddenly turning to \nhead right toward the bots following him. He sets his jets on maximum \nburn, zoomning over the Predacons&#39; heads and firing two signature \nseeking missiles when he was right above them, and then slowing down \nslightly so that they could keep up. He was heading toward Ignatis&#39;s \nposition.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ignatius detected enemy fire from long range. The eagle went into a\n&gt; powerdive avoiding the shots. &quot;So that&#39;s the game. I&#39;ll teach them \nmy\n&gt; rules.&quot; he fired two wing missles at Attila and five bursts from his \neyes at\n&gt; Luzbel. He stayed close to the water trying to use the water to \nconfuse the\n&gt; sensors. He knew that the closer he got the more likely he&#39;d be \ndetected and\n&gt; attacked.\n&gt; \n&gt; The call to retreat came through from Slayer. &quot;We can&#39;t retreat yet, \nI&#39;m\n&gt; barely warmed up.&quot; he wanted to rescue the leader even though he \nknew that\n&gt; Prebon had made a strategic mistake (To put it lightly) attacking \nthe Iron\n&gt; fist. He vowed allegiance to his leader and intended to follow it \nthrough to\n&gt; the end.\n&gt; \n&gt; Long range scanners showed Slayer going the opposite direction. He \nswitched\n&gt; frequencies and called Slayer again. &quot;Lead them back toward me, I&#39;ll \nlay\n&gt; down coverfire.&quot; Ignatius wasn&#39;t facing fire from the fortress so he \nknew\n&gt; that he was out of range. He transformed to robot mode and dove into \nthe\n&gt; water. he set all operating functions on minimal hoping thier \nattension\n&gt; would\n\n\n"}}
