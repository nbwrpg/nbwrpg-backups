Okay Wing Caliber, first t=\r\nhings first, we need ta snip the cable that runs from the battery pack to t=\r\nhe explosive compound, which is the blue and white wire I&#39;m pointing to, on=\r\n my left.  That will cut the power off to the main explosive.  After that, =\r\nthe counter will mean nothing, unless of course that slag ball managed to d=\r\no a bypass on it..  Let&#39;s see...  Checking for a... Son of a...  SLAG!  The=\r\nre is a bypass on this. I hate that.  I know how ta do this but it&#39;s a pain=\r\n in the aft ta do it.  Okay, here goes nothing..
