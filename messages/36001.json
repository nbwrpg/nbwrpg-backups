The echo of metal and crackling energy filled the air.\nSwitchblade turned sideways so he was even with Grimlock. his right arm was\npositioned to his side as a defensive maneuver, his left blade was drawn\nback much like a scorpions tale waiting for an opening to strike. The Cybrat\nleader feighned a quick jab toward the Dinobots chest and quickly followed\nwith an uppercut toward the mechanical crotch area attempting to slice\nGrimlock in half.\n\nMachine gun shots from Jet Lee (Close enough) filled the air causing a\nseries of dents to form from Switchblades left leg up to his thigh. The\nimpact hadn&#39;t penetrated his shell yet but Switchblade knew that if he took\nhis concentration off of his airborn opponent he&#39;d be cut into so many\nlittle pieces that all the kings horses and all the kings men couldn&#39;t put\nhim together again.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: robertdahl &lt;rdahl@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, May 29, 2001 4:39 PM\nSubject: Re: Head to head, the way I like it.\n\n\n&gt; Grimlock saw Switchblade leap towards him. He drew out his energo sword\n&gt; with his free hand, and kept going his full speed, straight for him, not\n&gt; wavering at all. If he wasnt wearing a faceplate, he would have been\n&gt; smilling in the midst of this battle.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
