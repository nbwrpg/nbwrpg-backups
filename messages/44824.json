In other situations she would&#39;ve \nstepped in but\n&gt; the mutant was still weak from her mind wars with Surgital. \ntransforming to\n&gt; her robot mode she extended the owl wings on her back and flew \nskyward. The\n&gt; Maximals were capable of handling themselves. Her former friends \ndidn&#39;t need\n&gt; her anymore.
