Vulois goes to investigate, but he \nfoinds he&#39;s been locked in!\n\n&quot;Someone just heard our conversation! Computer, open door code Vulois \nAlpha 3!\n\nComputer: Sorry, no such authorization code for low ranking Predacon \nbot Vulois.\n\n&quot;WHAT!?! Oh, that lying little...... He didn&#39;t do anything! We have \nto get out that door and find whoever heard our conversation!\n\nVulois turned to Tank mode and loaded up a missle.\n\n&quot;No!&quot; shouted Terminess, &quot;We can&#39;t blow the door open. We have to \npick it.&quot;\n\nTermines pulled out a kit from her arm(much like the one Rat Trap \nused in the episode where he faked being a Pred) and waved it over \nthe door. It made some funny sounds, and than opened.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;\n\nVulois and Terminess ran out of the room. Vulois called back to \nBattera\n\n&#39;If you want to go home, you&#39;ll follow us!&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
