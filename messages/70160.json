Does Darkhawk have a reason to hates you? Have you done\n&gt;&gt; something to him?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Perceptor spoke Rodimus barely heard him. It was as if inside his head \n&gt; voices were talking. The word faliure echoing through his systems. Some \n&gt; voices seemed to be whispering into his ears while others were yelling at \n&gt; the top of thier lungs. Some where reminding him of his failure - his \n&gt; failure to protect Nightlight, his failure to defeat Cyclonus, and his \n&gt; failure to keep the power of the matrix.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yet despite all of that, he could now hear voices of hope, of redemption, \n&gt; of a returning to his former glory!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I will not allow anyone to come to harm because of my own failure!&quot; \n&gt; Rodims said again, but this time he continued, &quot;Because I will no longer \n&gt; allow my failure to consume me!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It was a profound statement of some internal conviction he felt. Meanwhile \n&gt; some internal warmth stealed over his internal systems, as the fire that \n&gt; had been cold and black for so long was now burning a bright firey red as \n&gt; a power that he had almost forgotten about once again flooded him.\n&gt;\n&gt; When Rodimus looked back at Perceptor again, it was not through the \n&gt; crimson optics of a Decepticon or Predacon, but the clear yellow ones of \n&gt; an Autobot, one that had once been given the task to lead the Autobots \n&gt; through thier darkest hour, only to be consumed by it, but now through the \n&gt; hope and efforts of others had risen once again.\n&gt;\n&gt; With a swift movement the reborn RODIMUS PRIME attempted to shove \n&gt; Perceptor back. Then without out even looking to see if he had been \n&gt; successful he leaped over to the cell block control panel and entered the \n&gt; command that would open all the cells and release the prisoners!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;RISE AUTOBOTS AND MAXIMALS!&quot; Rodimus said both out loud and over the \n&gt; Maximal and Autobot frequencies, &quot;THE TIME HAS COME TO FIGHT FOR OUR \n&gt; FREEDOM! ARISE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Airly, its up to you how successful that was :)\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
