And then, I&#39;ll extinguish his spark.&quot; She \ngently rubbed the scar that ran from her forehead down to her \ncheek. &quot;I owe him big time.&quot;  She turned and walked into her room.  \nShe looked around the room. It was lavishly furnished, well, \ncomparatively speaking. She was used to caves, old wrecks and holes \nin the ground. This was like a 20 star hotel on Cybertron. She \ntransformed into bot mode and walked over to a pluch chair. She sat \ndown and folded her hands behind her head. Giving out a sigh of \nrelief and enjoyment,&quot;Ahhhhh, this is the life. I should have done \nthis a long time ago. this sure beats the hole in the ground that \nI&#39;ve been occuping lately.&quot; she smiled and closed her optics. She \nenjoyed being able to relax and not worry about getting shot for \nonce.  She opened her optics and smiled. &quot;Yeah, this is the way a \nmouse should live.&quot;\nShe wondered what was going to happen and how she was going to get \nback at Megaton. Such things like revenge needed careful plotting. \nAnd that required energy she didn&#39;t have right then. She relaxed and \nslowly started to fall asleep in the chair.  \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  He laughed. &quot;The decepticons our my major worry.
