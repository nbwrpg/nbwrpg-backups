Her \nthoughts were running away with her. &quot;No, listen to me. I don&#39;t need \nrest.  I need to find out how to destroy the clones. Before it&#39;s to \nlate.&quot; She looked at Drillbit. &quot;Listen to me. What if Megatron could \nclone more of there like himself.&quot; She looked at Destructor.  &quot;think \nabout it. An army of Megatrons. I can&#39;t sleep and let this \npossability exist. No, I must finish this work.&quot;\n\nShe was scared about this possability, and she didn&#39;t care if it \nshowed.  She didn&#39;t want an all out clone war to break out.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;    &quot;Destructor turned and snarled at Drillbit. &quot;We were just \ndicussing the \n&gt; mission.
