Perceptor&#39;s \nmessage bellowed \n&gt; and he saw the anger in Rodimus&#39;s eyes..&quot;Yes Prime do it use your \nanger I love \n&gt; it!&quot; As Rodimus lept off at incredible speed He shot fire from his \nmouth,the \n&gt; two tails lashing out toslice open the bot, his eyes shot out the \nlasers and \n&gt; his shoulder blasters rang out 15 shots all right onto the coming \nRodimus.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: I hope you dont mind a little CC. I posted for a little \ndamage to Hydras, \n&gt; &gt; but nothing critical.\n&gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus brought his arms down in a &quot;x&quot; formation, forcing the \nswords, and \n&gt; &gt; Hydras&#39; arms down. Rodimus then grabbed Hydras around the wrist \nwith his left \n&gt; &gt; hand. He dug his saw which was in the place of his right hand, \ndown into Hydras&#39; \n&gt; &gt; arm. With his balance on his left arm, Roddy flipped both legs \nup to double \n&gt; &gt; dropkick Hydras. After hitting this he back flips away and to \nhis feet.\n&gt; &gt; Just then Perceptor is heard over the comm system.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus stands motionless, and optics look empty, like all hope \nhad been lost. \n&gt; &gt; But then...\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Enough of this! Maximals, kill these bastards in \ncold fluid!\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; face shows nothing but hate. He grits his teeth \ntogether, while letting \n&gt; &gt; out an yell that could destroy an audio receptor. He is almost \nfomeing at the \n&gt; &gt; mouth, with the mixed mech fluids that leak from it. The anger \ncauses his &gt; normally blue optic sensors to turn a crimson red. His \ngaze locked on Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus empties his mouth, spitting all the energon and other \nmech fluids from \n&gt; &gt; his mouth at Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: On this day, Galvatron, I&#39;ll finally KILL \nYOU!!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus transformes to car mode and fires his propulsion \nrockets. Full power all \n&gt; &gt; at once, sending Rodimus Prime at Hydras&#39; gut at an airborn \n300mph!\n&gt; &gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; &gt; At the Maximal base Kup was about to take Elita from Cam...\n&gt; &gt; Kup: Give her here...\n&gt; &gt; When Perceptos message came over the comm sytem as well as a \npicture on all of \n&gt; &gt; the monitors.\n&gt; &gt; Kup: By primus no... How could they?! She was a mother, a good \nbot, she didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; deserve this. They targeted her just to get at Rodimus...\n&gt; &gt; Kup drops to the floor.\n&gt; &gt; Kup: Cam, you may have to help with that baby more if you can. \nHer father is the \n&gt; &gt; commander, and she just lost her mother...\n&gt; &gt; Kup looks up at the picture of Perceptor on the monitor.\n&gt; &gt; Kup: Rodimus will lose all control now. I fear that are leader \nis gone, and a &gt; killing machine is in his place. I actually pitty \nthose Predacons now, for what \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus will do to them. May primus have pitty on their sparks...\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I hope I really showed the emotion I meant to in this post. \nThe hatred, the \n&gt; &gt; sarrow, all of it.\n&gt; &gt;  airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:Perceptor:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;To all maxiamls, and specially to you...
