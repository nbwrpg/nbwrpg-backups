Though, the Fertile \nCrescent (where it is thought that man began), is not in Africa.  It is in \nthe Middle East.  I may be mistaken about that.  In the cartoons, nothing was \ntold to pinpoint the exact location of the Transformers (though Megatron did \nattack New York and nearly attacked Seattle).  BUT, in the comics the \nAutobots and Decepticons crashed in Mt. St. Hillary, a volcano in Oregon.  \nBut you may think that&#39;s impossible, but it&#39;s not.  Humans existed far beyond \n40K years (by 40K BC there were an estimated 10,000 Humans on the planet).\n\n"}}
