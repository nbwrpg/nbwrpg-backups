Every single predacon will do it&quot;\n\nCyclonus, and at a gesture from him Scourge as well followed Hydras\nand the Autobots down the halls towards the holding cells, his optics\nglancing at each of the prisoners in turn.\n\nThe walk itself was generally uneventful. There were a few jabs from\nthe Decepticon and predacon escorts here and there and a few misteps\nand quips from the prisoners, but for the most part went without\nincident.\n\nAs they walked Cyclonus hung back slightly as he held conversations\nwith different ones on his radio. At some points he seemed to be\ntalking with Jhiaxus and/or Scorponok, but at other times he was\ntalking with others whos names were not given in conversation. His\nvoice was low, but it was obvious he was giving orders of different\ntypes.\n\nAs they arrived at the main cell block area, thick heavy doors rumbled\nas magnalocks disengaged and the doors slid open. It was obvious that\nthey were heavy, and designed to hold back a hoard of Dinobots!\n\nThe room itself while large was generally spartan, with only a few\nsecurity screens positioned around a central control panel and sitting\narea for anyone that wanted to act as a guard. The walls were\ngenerally gunmetal grey thick pieces of bulkhead, that at first glance\nlooked impervious to the most firepower. There did not appear to be\nany easily accessed vent shafts here for anything larger then an earth\ninsect, and no obvious power leads or electrical conduits, except to\nthe central panels in the center of the room. Even the light poanels\nthat came the room illuminated were recessed into the walls and\nceiling and were covered by transparent material which was not quite\nglass.\n\nAround the room were the doors to the indicidual cells, each cell\ncould have bars slide over its entrance, a full security door, a force\nfield or a combination of any of the three. Off to one side another\ndoor led to a room that Tuscon was already familiar with - the\ninterrogation room.\n\nCyclonus walked over to the control panel as he prepared to open\ndifferent cells, &quot;At your command Hydras.&quot; he said, waiting for Hydras\nto choose which cells he wanted the prisoners in.\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: I went ahead and described the room since Hydras has been having\nCyclonus do security upgrades. :)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
