And you \nwant to put that in me? Oh no...No way. I am not going to run the \nrisk of infecting...&quot; she stopped as the protoform shivered.  It was \ncoming out of stasis lock.  She woke up and opened her eyes.  She \ntook a deep breath and felt the air fill her lungs.  She just layed \nthere, breathing and with her eyes open. She thought, &quot;Veratis, what \ndid you do to me?&quot; She could tell that Veratis was nervious, and that \nwasn&#39;t helping her own fears any.  She felt herself shake, she felt \ncold.  The white fur was still growing and the wings on her back were \ndeveloping into huge wings with white feathers.  She could feel her \nskin crawl as it developed and started to form over her protoform.\nShe tried not to cry, but she couldn&#39;t understand what or why this \nwas happening toher.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Veratis didn&#39;t know what to expect, he didn&#39;t expect yes from \nShadow \n&gt; Wing that much was for sure. &quot;The last time I used the virus was on \n&gt; insecticons. It nullified thier ability to communicate. The virus \n&gt; eventually spread until they were wiped out.&quot; he wasn&#39;t afraid for \n&gt; her at the moment, he was afraid of the effects that would occur if \n&gt; it spread through her telepathy.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If I give you a small dose it should weaken your telepathy, I just \n&gt; don&#39;t know what other effects it may have.&quot;\n&gt;  He didn&#39;t have to say it but the biggest thought going through his \n&gt; mind was that he&#39;d never used the virus on a protoform.\n\n\n\n"}}
