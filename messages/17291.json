That&#39;s how they kept \nSquizzy were she was all this time.\n\n\n::Spears::\n\nShe kissed him back.  She couldn&#39;t help but smile. &quot;Ramulus is a \nstrong leader.  His followers would follow him to the pit if he asked \nthem to.  He&#39;s very smart and not easily fooled. But does have a \nweakness. He cares. He cares about those who has served with him.&quot; \nShe smiled at Prebon. &quot;Just tell me when you want me to scream.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Vulois couldn&#39;t wait like this. He got out of his CR Chamber and \n&gt; looked around. He wanted someone to notice him so they would change \n&gt; his programming. He had to become part of the the Alliance if he \n&gt; wanted to free Battera and Cybershark. He walked down the hall, not \n&gt; caring if hew as picked up by any cameras. He went down to the \n&gt; quarters section, thinking some bots must be there. The ones he \nfound \n&gt; were the unexpected ones. He saw Cybershark standing there, talking \n&gt; to someone in their quarters. He was going to go up to him and \ndemand \n&gt; to be made Alliance. He got a bit closer and over-heard his \n&gt; conversation. He wanted to escape! Maybe he wasn&#39;t under there \n&gt; influence after all! He had to take a chance. He went up to him, \nand \n&gt; saw that it was Battera he was talking too.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Cybershark. It&#39;s me, Vulois. I think I can help get you out of \nhere!&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix and Fliq follow the others.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Prebon\n&gt; \n&gt; (I gave him a cloaking device, whether he uses it is up to you.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon acknowledges Slayer, and looks up to the top of the cliff \nand \n&gt; sees him. He turns to Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What a marvelous day we are going to have, eh love.&quot; He kissed \n&gt; her, &quot;Tell me, what were your impressions of Ramulus when you met \n&gt; him?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (Dcoburn, I need you to respond to Gotron and than to Starscream. \nAnd \n&gt; by the way, how was your Friday off? That&#39;s right! Oh yeah, take \n&gt; that! Big four day weeked for us! Canadian Thanksgiving! So beats \n&gt; your scrawny three day weekend for your silly Columbus Day!)\n\n\n"}}
