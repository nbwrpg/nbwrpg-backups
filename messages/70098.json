Especially when it came from Hydras \n&gt; or the other Predacons and Decepticons.  He then realized by the feel of \n&gt; his restraints, that yes, they were next to near impossible from escape. \n&gt; To break them was not an option, but, perhaps Ninjabot training could come \n&gt; in handy as far as finding ways around the loop holes.  He could sense \n&gt; that the more he expanded his hydraulics on his wrists and ankles, the \n&gt; tigher and less comfortable they were on him.  Meditation again would come \n&gt; in handy.  The more he relaxed, the more limber his body would become. \n&gt; Perhaps even limber enough to give him more room to move in his tight \n&gt; quarters.  Yet he was still waiting to hear Rodimus&#39;s reply to his \n&gt; question.  When the answer doesn&#39;t come, he realizes that he&#39;d have to get \n&gt; through to him a different way.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I remember the battle, although it was a bitter memory. We were \n&gt; desperately fighting against Hydras, me myself, barely able to fend off \n&gt; the Predacons, but I did.  Then, it started to happen.  Things were \n&gt; getting out of control real fast and there were no more Autobots with \n&gt; considerable speed available, for diversionary tactics.  In that time, I \n&gt; was open to assist, and then everything was happening at once. You were \n&gt; being chased, along with windlord and Nightlight.  Being who I am, and who \n&gt; I was at the time, to me, there was no such thing as failure.  So, I \n&gt; transformed into vehicle mode, and I went as fast as my wheels could take \n&gt; me, although not very fast to your standards, but to mine it was far \n&gt; beyond my usual caliber.  I yelled out your name, and I told you to hold \n&gt; on because I was comming to help you.  I was able to divert the attention \n&gt; away from you and direct it my way.  What I didn&#39;t see comming was an \n&gt; energy blast that hit me square in my directory, causing me to fall into \n&gt; immediate stasis, and before I knew it, everything went black, and after \n&gt; that, nothing.  I lost everything.  My sight, and even a good portion of \n&gt; my memory.  But most of all, I lost the leader that I respected loyally, \n&gt; and two of my most valuable comrades.  I lost you all because of me, and \n&gt; you think I&#39;m happy with that?  I&#39;m not.  Because of me you are now how \n&gt; you are, and I&#39;ll have that guilt with me for as long as I live.   But I&#39;m \n&gt; learning to move on Rodimus, as painful it is for me to remember the past, \n&gt; I&#39;m moving on.  And I believe I can help you do the same, if - you can \n&gt; trust me.  Hydras would never promise you the support only a fellow \n&gt; Autobot can offer, and he would never accept failure as a learning \n&gt; experience.  But to me, Failure is just a nother step toward self \n&gt; improvement.  You fall, you get back up, and you roll again.  You look \n&gt; back at what you did wrong and you correct it.  It&#39;s all right to make \n&gt; mistakes Rodimus, Primus knows I&#39;ve made more than my fair share already.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He hoped that his approach would possibly break some ground beneath them.\n&gt;\n&gt; In another cell in the fortress, Night Shift remains calm knowing that \n&gt; Tucson Prime wasn&#39;t really about to give into Hydras.  A new plan was in \n&gt; action and all he had to do was wait.  Although, getting out of the \n&gt; handcuffs was also on his mind.  He didn&#39;t much care for them, since they \n&gt; were irritating the metal around his wrists.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Slag these things itch like mad.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He tries to scratch the itchiness that the cuffs cause him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside the fortress, Rat Trap observes Phobia&#39;s reaction to Quickstride&#39;s \n&gt; noxious gas explusion.  He sees how euphoric it makes her.  With his ratty \n&gt; little mind, he gets an idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmmmm....  I think someone&#39;s gettn a buzz off of your fumes Quickstride. \n&gt; Although I dunno what&#39;s so great about it, because it smells worse than a \n&gt; rotting carcass.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride&#39;s ears flicker back and forth.  He slows from a gallop, to a \n&gt; canter and eases himself from trot to walk, turning around to watch the \n&gt; Decepticons heading toward the black fortress.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmmm.... Really?  Gettn&#39; a buzz off my aft gas huh?  Which one?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap looks around in the sky.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well, the redn&#39; white one that just acted a little goofy up there.. \n&gt; That&#39;s the one.  I dunno who that Decepticreep is, but definitely got \n&gt; tipsy off that gas.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride finds more bean pods and stuffs his mouth with them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If that&#39;s the case, then, when in doubt... Stink&#39;em out.  C&#39;mon Rat Trap, \n&gt; we&#39;re gon&#39; back.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap gasps.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;ARE YOU OUTA YOUR DIRECTORY?!  CAN WE SAY SLAGGED IN SECONDS, YA OVER \n&gt; RATED JACKAFT?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride looks to Rat Trap.  He swallows a whole bunch of bean pods \n&gt; down.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Maybe I am.  Trust me, the more I eat, the better this&#39;ll get&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; He then trots back toward the fortress, turns his rump around, lifts his \n&gt; tail and breaks the wind around him, sending another gassy cloud of fumes \n&gt; through the wind.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ohh yeahhh, nice&#39;n stinky..   Let&#39;s see if they&#39;ll buy the bait.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; HYdras/Perceptor/Darkhawk:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;I hope that you feel confortable Tucson Prime&quot;said with irony the \n&gt;&gt; Predacon\n&gt;&gt; leader&quot;You will spent here a lot time... till I decide what to do with\n&gt;&gt; you...

There was very little movement for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tuscon, although he could probably find a few micrometers if he tried.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;This is treated Cybertronian metal, you might find this a little more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; difficult to break.&quot; Scorponok said as he stepped back to admire his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; handy work. He with a single movement he pulled one of the manacle\n&gt;&gt; &gt; locks a little harder, as if to make sure that there would be no\n&gt;&gt; &gt; escape for Tuscon.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Difficult, yes impossible.&quot; Scorponok folded his arms over his chest\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as he looked back at Hydras for his orders.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
