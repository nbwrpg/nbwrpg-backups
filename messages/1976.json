It was strange and it baffled her as to why the Alliance wanted it so badly, perhaps it contained important info on new programs or then next attack on the Maximals from them? Carnage had no clue as to why they would give it to Teltoli and then ask for it back but it had to be something, she looked the disc over again but then held it out to Teltoli to take back.\nAll she knew was that it was important and they had to keep it.*\n\n&quot; You know, I have no clue as to what it is but I can bet that it&#39;s important. Hang onto it.&quot;\n\n* Just then the thought occurred to her, what if the Alliance came to find it and if Teltoli didn&#39;t give it back they would torture her! That was a thought that she didn&#39;t want to think about but it was very well possible, and she knew what it would be like.\nCarnage looked at the disc in her outstretched hand then at Teltoli, she didn&#39;t want her friend to be hurt over some stupid disc that the Alliance wanted! She could handle torture and still be able to keep the disc from those bots, but could Teltoli?*\n\n&quot; Unless you want me to take care of it?&quot;\n\n* That question had meaning and concern behind it, the answer may even mean the difference between life and death...for Teltoli.*\n\n*************************************\n\n* Dinobot had kept his eyes on the floor as Tavatron had passed him and walked out the door, he didn&#39;t want her to look at him that way again and find something else then what he was. It was to unnerving for him and it made him uncomfortable.\nHe sensed her pass through the door and exit the base, it was then that he stepped through the door as well and let it close behind him.\nDinobot then looked up and around the surroundings, his stomach growling a again and causing him to do the same thing...only louder! He saw Tavatron jog a little ways ahead but then slow to a walk, perhaps a wise thing to save energy for the real hunt but perhaps not.\nHe looked around for any Predacons that might decide that Tavatron and himself might be easy targets, there were none but even if there were underestimation of a target could be deadly! He looked down at his clawed hands and snarled, very deadly!\nDinobot then began to move off in Tavatron&#39;s direction, within a few clicks he caught up to her but remained a step or two behind to keep an extra scanner out for danger.\nTavatron had reported that she knew of a suitable hunting ground but had seemed a little nervous when she had spoke of it, such nervousness could jeopardize their hunt and the cost would be an empty stomach.\nHe growled, then he would have to resort to those disgusting food cubes!\nDinobot snarled and shook his head in disgust, even the mutilated bodies of bots weren&#39;t half as gross as those base made food cubes! Or so was his opinion.\nDinobot looked down at Tavatron but then back ahead of them, he knew that natural instincts of a wolf was to travel in packs and run down their prey.\nHe knew that there wasn&#39;t a pack but that shouldn&#39;t change anything, they could run down a meal easily with just the two of them. Or so he hoped.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
