It&#39;s in case someone gets ambitious\n&gt; while they think the crew is distarcted with your\n&gt; presence. I just had every compartment sealed leading\n&gt; below decks.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;  &quot; Will that stop them?&quot; Megatron asked.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Of course,&quot; Panzertron said,&quot; Every door is locked\n&gt; with a duracypertrioum lock. It&#39;s unhackable with out\n&gt; setting off the ship&#39;s alarms. Each door is a meter\n&gt; thick, so they won&#39;t blast through them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   Megatron nodded,&quot; Seems you like precaution.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;More then you know,&quot; Panzertron said. He waved his\n&gt; hand around thie bridge,&quot; This ship is secure against\n&gt; anything, given time. Anyone attacking will have only\n&gt; minicylces to make sure it works before the ship\n&gt; defenses kick in. Unless of course the oppoents of\n&gt; this world are very creative.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Don&#39;t be over confident,&quot; Megatron said,&quot; The\n&gt; opponets of this world are creative.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -OOC- Panzertron is boasting about his ship. Like the\n&gt; &quot;Super-battleships&quot; of WW2 the Iron Fist isn&#39;t\n&gt; perfect.-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
