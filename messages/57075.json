He transformed to dragon mode and a cloud of frost \nshot out\n&gt; &gt; from his armor plates. He looked around, but saw no one.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: Hello? Is there anyone here?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hearing a voice, it sounded like something from a human fantasy \nfairy or some \n&gt; strange special effect to her. Her audion receptors were clouded \nby the \n&gt; strange energetic waters. Her optics tried to locate the voice. \n&gt; \n&gt; But, with a step from the waterfall, it seemed as though she were \nlike some \n&gt; spirit that just appeared from the water, her form shimmering from \nthe energy \n&gt; water & the sun. Her crimson optics glowed as she caught the sight \nof the blue \n&gt; dragon before her on the edge of the lagoon. She stood there, \njust... watching \n&gt; him. Cocking her head to the side. She seemed... innocent at the \nmoment. \n&gt; But... lost. \n&gt; \n&gt; Standing on the stones a moment, her feathery mane whipped around \nher by the \n&gt; turbulence in the air caused by the waterfall & wind. her wings \nwere heavily \n&gt; damaged, but her form seemed to be healing. A gift from the waters \nof this \n&gt; strange lagoon. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her crimson optics gazed at the blue dragon as she stood there as \nthough she \n&gt; were standing on the water itself. Her form still shimmering.\n\n\n"}}
