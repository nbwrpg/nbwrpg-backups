Then Kup&#39;s attention was to Nighlight, she started to be conceous \nand that worries him; she weakly tried to push Kup away.

That&#39;s a promise.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap thumbs up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;CR Chamber&#39;s ready for Windlord.   Okay buddy, when you wake up, you&#39;re \n&gt; gonna feel right at home.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot knew she had to meet up with Kup quickly.  And she knew that \n&gt; she had no vehicle mode or air craft mode to transform into.  Just her \n&gt; luck, she was not far from where Quickstride was, as he was with Legacy \n&gt; and the others.  Quickstride lifts his head and spots her.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Guys, look, it&#39;s another Autobot.  She looks like she&#39;s waving toward \n&gt; me.  Legacy, I&#39;m gonna go see what she needs.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He canters up to Straight Shot and stops to offer his back. She smiles.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I thought I recognized ya.  Quickstride, right?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s me.  Hop on, where to?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She hops onto his back, and grips his long, copper mane.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I need ta get back ta the Ark, ta meet up with Kup, he has something \n&gt; Tucson needs and that I&#39;m gonna bring to him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks to her.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Say no more we&#39;re there.  Hold on, my gait isn&#39;t exactly the smoothest.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She holds on as he bolts toward the Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Tucson Prime manages to get Talon&#39;s message.  He was happy to \n&gt; hear her voice.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Strange day this is turning out to be isn&#39;t it Talon?  I&#39;ll remain put \n&gt; so you can find me easilly.  Legacy has just located me along with \n&gt; Perceptor.  I&#39;m in one piece, but I&#39;m not so sure about Rodimus. I hope \n&gt; he&#39;s all right.  Anyway, I&#39;ll look forward to a little down time with you \n&gt; as soon as this is behind us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns to Perceptor.  Again more gears turn.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Perceptor, I&#39;d like to thank you for your help and your willingness to \n&gt; return where you felt most intimidated.  To me, that is not the way of a \n&gt; Predacon, but the valor of a Maximal.  And no, it&#39;s NOT an insult, it&#39;s a \n&gt; complement.  I&#39;m sorry you have not had the experience of having a formal \n&gt; complement, and I promise you what I say I mean.  Your help is valuable \n&gt; and I can not put a price on it.  Speaking of your help...  Did - you by \n&gt; chance create the shell program?  If so, perhaps you know of a way to \n&gt; reverse it.  Anything you can help us we&#39;ll gladly take, and we will \n&gt; protect you if need be, from Hydras.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime unlike Hydras, didn&#39;t need the power of oppression to win his \n&gt; comrades, and he knew that he couldn&#39;t force anyone to do anything they \n&gt; didn&#39;t want to do.  And he always expected himself to return the favors \n&gt; that are given to him. Perceptor&#39;s help was valuable he knew he&#39;d have \n&gt; quite a debt to pay to him once everything was said and done.  He holds \n&gt; out a hand to Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Legacy, please note that from this day forth, although Perceptor is of a \n&gt; different faction, he has helped us greatly.  Therefore, we must always \n&gt; keep our doors open to him if he needs our help and our protection.  Enemy \n&gt; or not, he has risked his own spark to help us and that is something we \n&gt; must all honor.  Perceptor, I would personaly like to shake your hand in a \n&gt; show of peace and Neutrality.  You&#39;ve earned my respect as a comrade and \n&gt; shown us selflessness and the ability to cooperate with the opposite \n&gt; faction.  The choice is yours Perceptor, and I respect what you choose.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Who: LEGACY, Tuscon, Perceptor\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor looking to Legacy said, &quot;i dont know you, but I&#39;m going to go \n&gt;&gt; &gt; down\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and bring the primes back, or at least one of them&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy nodded, &quot;Come, we must do all that we can to secure the primes.\n&gt;&gt; Without them then all is lost.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is a short moment before Legacy and hopefully Perceptor are able to\n&gt;&gt; catch up with Tuscon at the edge of the tunnel. His side is much\n&gt;&gt; easier to penetrate as the sides are more sloping, as if made for a\n&gt;&gt; vehicle to drive up from.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Steam is venting from the tunnel entrance making it very difficult to\n&gt;&gt; see as apparently water and magma are meeting violently somewhere much\n&gt;&gt; further inside this tunnel.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ahead of Tuscon very little can be discerned as the steam seems to\n&gt;&gt; billow out like smoke, but up ahead what sounds like metal scraping on\n&gt;&gt; stone can be heard as if something is being dragged, but quickly\n&gt;&gt; enough the sound stops.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
