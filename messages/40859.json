I do agree that missiles\nshouldnt be fired, but they do have a much more advanced technology than\nwe do, so we dont know for sure. I do know that a transformers body is\nable to stabalize pressures, as they were doing it in a comic book\nissue, but it is very energy costly, and as soon as their energy runs\nout, they would begin to get crushed. That isnt the end all of the\ndiscussion, just what I thought. Remember, the Autobots and Decepticons\nwere blasting missiles at each other underwater in two different\nepisodes (Atlantis Arise, The Ultimate Doom part 1), suggesting that\nmaybe their artilary can stand up to pressures.\n\n"}}
