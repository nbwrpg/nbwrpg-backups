He was bigger, stronger, \nand more deadly as a fighter than she was, but for some strange reason, she \ndidn&#39;t fear him.  She looked at him for a moment.  As a wolf, he was a great \ncredit to his kind. She was still wary of him thought, after all, they had \njust met.  She looked at him as he asked his question.\n&quot;I&#39;m not sure who will meet us there.  It depends on what is happeneing when \nwe get there.  I have been out of contact with the arc for a while I&#39;m not \nsure who will greet us.&quot;\nShe flew next to him.\n\n\n----Original message-----\nFrom:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\nDate: Fri Jun 30, 2000 5:51pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\nLunarpine transformed back to wolf and followed his new freind, His\nbot said to trust her as a fellow maximal, but his wolf instincts\nviewed her as competition. In the wild a wolf and owl compete for the\nsame food. he hoped that would be different with the maximals. He\ndidn&#39;t want to hurt her, even to survive.\nLunarpine shook his head, trying to seperate the logic and instincts\nburied in his head. To justify both he asked two questions.\n&quot;Shadow Wing where are we going and who will greet us when we\narrive?\n(side question- how are we getting across the ocean from canada to\nTibet?)\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
