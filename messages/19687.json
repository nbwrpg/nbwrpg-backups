Foxfingers plan had worked, unfortunately he was out \nof \n&gt; &gt; chips. He held still as he could hoping the autoguns would think \nhe \n&gt; &gt; was destroyed. He knew Darkmouse knew he was alive so it wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; long till she corrected them. He had two options, either escape \nor \n&gt; &gt; find a place on the ship that didn&#39;t have autoguns. If he left \nthe \n&gt; &gt; outside guns would reduce him to slag. He scanned the ship and \n&gt; found \n&gt; &gt; an area of the ship without guns. He stayed close to the wall \n&gt; &gt; sneaking under a few cameras. He slowly worked his way to the \nsafe \n&gt; &gt; spot.
