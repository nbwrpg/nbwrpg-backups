A bot had appeared out of no where, and had opened fire on \nWarMachine. Visuals reported that eight other bots were moving behind \nthe base, but they were obviouslty illusions, since they didn&#39;t \nregister on scanners.\n\n&quot;Come with me,&quot; he says to Najah, walking out of the lan and running \nof down a hallway.\n\n&quot;Alliance troops,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;The base is under attack \nby one bot. More may be cloaked. If you&#39;ll be defending the base, \ndon&#39;t let any of them past you. Some of the bots are holograms, so \nuse your scanners.&quot;\n\nHe orders the Alliance base&#39;s computer to begin a cloak scan, the \nscanners getting to work as he heads for the exit.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRecieving Zardus&#39; transmission, Reptilica sighs, jumping to his feet \nand pulling out his gun.\n\nHe runs out of the bridge, heading for the exit\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica passes Bloodystrike as Bloodystrike recieves Zardus&#39; \ntransmission. The Alliance bot spins around, following Reptilica.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Alliance base detects weapon fire, the autoguns firing at Inu.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWarMachine roars as lances strike him in the back, spinning around to \nfire missiles at Inu from his shoulder missile launchers. His good \narm was now charred from the blast, the hand disabled.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;RYO D&quot; &lt;striderzero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Koj::\n&gt; Koj watch WarMachine thinking come on stupid alittle closer.Koj \nwaits as \n&gt; WarMachine reaches for the pod waiting till he gets a firm grip on \nit.
