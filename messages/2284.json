She had taken his hand and stood up as well but had growled deeply as Annihalator had suddenly come onto the scene and threatened them. Couldn&#39;t they get any peace?! First the call from Liono, which was logical but annoying and now this?! She saw Prowl fire an acid pellet at the invading bot before he could respond but then snapper her head towards Killer as he had come up on the other side of them. She bared her teeth at him as she snarled, she was in just the mood to kick a little bot butt!\nIron Raptor took a step towards him but then stopped, not daring to get any closer. He had no idea what he was getting into, did he? She heard his words that if they put their weapons away they wouldn&#39;t get hurt, to bad the same rule didn&#39;t apply to him!*\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve had enough of this!!!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor looked back at Prowl to see how he was doing but then snapped her attention back towards Killer, she straightened her stance*\n\n&quot; Second Beast Mode!!&quot;\n\n* It wasn&#39;t long until she was in her 2 story black form and baring down on Killer, the trees pressed against her sides but they wouldn&#39;t stop her.\nWith a roar/snarl she hunkered down as like a cat stalking it&#39;s prey and then sprang forward with her front limbs out stretched to catch Killer if he suddenly decided to run.\nShe was sick of this war and she was sick of being interrupted! She had her own life and if she had to kill an enemy to live it then so be it!\nHer jaws were open and with the power behind them to crush alloy then bared down on Killer. Her front claws slammed into the ground on each side of him, dirt spraying into the air around the enemy at impact.\nWith a heave she brought her shoulders forwards, bringing her neck and head snapping forward and towards the target...killer&#39;s torso.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
