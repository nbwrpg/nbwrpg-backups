He still heard\nthe weapons fire and exploding shells. He still could\nnot remember a thing, but had noticed the brave bots\ndefending that ship, willing to give up their lives\nfor what they believed in. He hoped he had been one of\nthem. Something was drawing him back there. He\ntransformed back to robot mode. He was still in pain,\nbut he began to walk back to the battle.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
