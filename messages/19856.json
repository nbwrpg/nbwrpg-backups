But it was all so sudden and almost scared the slag out of her.\nHere she was now, standing upright in this new mode but what was she...this \nwas some sort of creature which she had never seen before.\nBut as she CR room doors opened she looked at her reflection in the shiny \nsurface, and jumped back in surprise. What she had seen was the face of a \nnightmare, something out of a horror film thought up in a sick bot&#39;s \nimagination!\nShe stepped back from the doors, her voice barely a whisper.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m a monster....&quot;\n\n* And she was, something that could rip apart a bot in seconds and still \nfeel no wavering about the action.\nShe didn&#39;t even know if she could ever accept her name again, hear it from \nothers mouths...knowing that she was this.\nShe looked down at her claws again, finding them so alien she thought that \nshe could be looking through something elses eyes, something bent on \nkilling.\nBut even if she accepted this form, she couldn&#39;t go back into the CR \nroom...where her hightened senses relayed that Tavatron was in there...and \nDinobot had regained a bit of conciousness.\nShe couldn&#39;t let them see her like this, like a monster.\n\nHer breathing was iragular and she forgot about the throbing pain in her \nshoulder, wondering just if her activation mode would work.\nHer voice again quiet.*\n\n&quot; Iron Raptor Maximize!&quot;\n\n* Nothing happened, her muscles tensed.*\n\n&quot; Maximize!!&quot;\n\n* Still nothing.*\n\n&quot; MAXIMIZE GODDAM YOU!!!&quot;\n\n* There was a faint clicking sound within her circuits this time...but \nnothing other then that occured.\nCould her activation sequence have been damaged...or was this mode \npermanent?\nShe remembered she had transformed the last time this had happen, when she \nhad been pained.\nBut this time it wasn&#39;t working in the slightest.\nThough, all she knew was that she wasn&#39;t going into that CR room unless she \nwas physically dragged in there, and that was all she knew for sure.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
