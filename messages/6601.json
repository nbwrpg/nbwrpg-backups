He was actually enjoying this long \nrange \n&gt; trip. He was cold, but that was all. He still had his air \nsuperiority. He \n&gt; was almost past the last marker that strange little Fuzor gave him. \nAnd \n&gt; after that, he would find Rowdy Wolf.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowing he said he would fire on him didn&#39;t make him feel safe, but \nhe was \n&gt; quite a marksman himself. He was fast and skilled.\n&gt; \n&gt; He had a feeling that he was being followed. He turned his head, \nseeing only \n&gt; a small dot on the ground. He used his scanners to find out who it \nwas, and \n&gt; found out that it was only KitKat, one of the Predacons.\n&gt; \n&gt; He opened his comm-link to her. &quot;What are you doing out here? Did \nsomebody \n&gt; send you?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
