Scourge just stepped away f=\r\nrom the opening that Windlord\n&gt; &gt; fired out from and let the shots go harml=\r\nessly into a bulkhead,\n&gt; &gt; scorching it only slightly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However that=\r\n slight amount of time allowed Windlord and Rat Trap time\n&gt; &gt; to scurry fur=\r\nther into their crawl space and find an interior bulkhead\n&gt; &gt; to hide behin=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Scrap!&quot; Scourge&#39;s voice said from the outside.

In the darkness th=\r\neir shapes\n&gt; &gt; could only be barely made out, but they looked like black me=\r\ntallic\n&gt; &gt; spiders, Hydras&#39; wall guardians!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (OOC: Rat Trap may reco=\r\ngnize them from last time.

He gives Quickstride a quizzical look as the\n&gt; &gt; equine Maximal sniffed=\r\n him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (OOC: Quickstride&#39;s sniff reveals nothing wrong.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He =\r\nwas about to let Quickstride in on what he had planned when Uproar\n&gt; &gt; appe=\r\nared. Rodimus appears taken aback though by Uproar&#39;s conclusion\n&gt; &gt; that it=\r\n was Legacy that had turned evil. While Rodimus didn&#39;t know\n&gt; &gt; that much a=\r\nbout Legacy, having only seen him briefly while being\n&gt; &gt; rescued and repai=\r\nred, there was nothing to hint that this attack was\n&gt; &gt; Legacy&#39;s doing. He =\r\nwas about to say something when Uproar ran towards\n&gt; &gt; the Ark to be let in=\r\n . . .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;KRACK POW&lt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Uproar ran towards the Ark, what seem=\r\ned like a round bolt of\n&gt; &gt; lightening appeared, sending Uproar flying seve=\r\nral yards through the\n&gt; &gt; air, to land heavily on the ground! Evidently the=\r\n Ark shielding was\n&gt; &gt; still in place, and it was not allowing anyone in.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus frowned, &quot;Uproar! Get over here! If we are going to get back=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; in, then we need to work together. That shield is supposed to hold off=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; all the Predacon forces. We are not going to get in by brute force.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Rodimus talked three other Maximals seemed to almost materialize\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; out of the underbrush, such was their skills at camouflage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The=\r\n first was Wing Caliber, (See: http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Skywarp ) an\n&gt; &gt; old =\r\nMaximal stratagist and military teacher, who from the brownish\n&gt; &gt; feathers=\r\n along his frame turned into some sort of eagle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The next was Leo I=\r\nI,\n&gt; &gt; (http://en.academic.ru/pictures/enwiki/76/Lioconvoy_gathering.jpg )\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the adopted son of Lio Convoy, and who looked much like him, and who\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; had obviously picked up many of his mannerisms. His body was\n&gt; &gt; powerful=\r\nly built and heavily armored. He looked to turn into a lion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The th=\r\nird was Ramulus (http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ramulus) who had like\n&gt; &gt; the other=\r\ns been on patrol for a while, surveying the area and trying\n&gt; &gt; to keep it =\r\nfree from Predacon invasion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They also come up beside Rodimus, Leo =\r\nII, obviously the leader of the\n&gt; &gt; other two, &quot;What now sir?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodi=\r\nmus looked at Quickstride and Uproar, &quot;Well let&#39;s get out of\n&gt; &gt; sight, and=\r\n then we can discuss it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile Inside the Ark:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Percept=\r\nor had received Tuscon&#39;s message and sent attempted to send a\n&gt; &gt; message t=\r\no Lord elder, however at the moment there was no answer from\n&gt; &gt; the elder =\r\nMaximal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the same time Legacy was still standing in the med lab =\r\nalong with\n&gt; &gt; the others, his single optic glowing in the darkness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;It would seem that Nightlight&#39;s vital systems are being held at\n&gt; &gt; mini=\r\nmal levels.&quot; Legacy said as he directed his gaze to the wall panel\n&gt; &gt; near=\r\nest Nightlight. A small light blinked, indicating her spark was\n&gt; &gt; still o=\r\nnline, but that there was not enough power to reboot her\n&gt; &gt; systems.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; He turned to look at the others, his face glowing in the darkness, lit\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; by his own optic, and the glowing bar on his chest plate. He raised\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhis right hand in the air, the one with the arm cannon on it and begin\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nto emit light from it, much like a flash light or a beacon so that the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nroom was illuminated. He casually looked around, &quot;Perhaps we could\n&gt; &gt; loca=\r\nte a back out or reserve power system . . . &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy paused as Tusc=\r\non&#39;s message came in. He turned to look at\n&gt; &gt; Santon, Bump and Perceptor, =\r\na look of disbelief momentarily flashing\n&gt; &gt; across his face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legac=\r\ny straightened as his cold voice comes across the channel, &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; will not =\r\ncomply with your command. I have been tasked with  . . . .\n&gt; &gt; &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt; =\r\n . . . the protection of the Ark as well as that of the\n&gt; &gt; Matrix. I will =\r\nnot knowingly leave the Ark undefended or the Matrix in\n&gt; &gt; the hands of an=\r\nother.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy turned to look at his console as he understoodf what=\r\n happened.\n&gt; &gt; Communications had been cut part way through his message. He=\r\n turned to\n&gt; &gt; look at the others, his single optic cold, &quot;It is illogical =\r\nto believe\n&gt; &gt; that I would attempt to harm the Ark or allow anyone to take=\r\n it from\n&gt; &gt; the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Plea=\r\nse keep in mind that radio/video communications from the\n&gt; &gt; battle field a=\r\nround the Black Tower have been severed for the Maximals\n&gt; &gt; and Autobots. =\r\nThose at the Ark however are free to communicate with\n&gt; &gt; each other if the=\r\ny choose.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sandy&#39;s Message: (Message #70992)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson now reci=\r\neves Notcorro&#39;s message. He thinks of a way to signal him\n&gt; &gt; without drawi=\r\nng attention to himself or the others. It was critical. He\n&gt; &gt; keeps\n&gt; &gt; hi=\r\ns weapons down, and sends an encrypted message back to Noctorro.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; =\r\nYou&#39;re right, I&#39;m not exactly perfect, and help would gladly be\n&gt; &gt; appreci=\r\nated.\n&gt; &gt; I have an idea.

I will continue to hold my \n&gt; &gt; position\n&gt; &gt; here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift and Straight Shot keep quiet. They could tell Tucson was in=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; thought,\n&gt; &gt; and somehow thinking up a strategy to get them out of the=\r\nir bind. He now \n&gt; &gt; had\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; send a message to Legacy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Lega=\r\ncy, if you can hear me, I strongly suggest that you heed my demands \n&gt; &gt; an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; vacate immediately. You are endangering the lives of Nightlight and t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; others,\n&gt; &gt; and those who endanger my comrades, deserve not to be am=\r\nong them. \n&gt; &gt; Although,\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; will be willing to meet with you private=\r\nly in a remote location of your\n&gt; &gt; choice.\n&gt; &gt; But not now. Now is not the=\r\n time. Heed my words now and things will not be\n&gt; &gt; difficult.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bac=\r\nk at the Ark, Uproar hears Rodimus, and trots over to him, looking a \n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nit\n&gt; &gt; confused. Quickstride looks over to him as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Sorry for=\r\n the fuss, hey, what&#39;s go&#39;n on? Why won&#39;t the Ark open for us?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Qui=\r\nckstride looks over to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Legacy is holding the Ark hostage, I t=\r\nhink, or at least that&#39;s what I got\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; the last message from Lord=\r\n Elder.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar looks to the Ark and back at Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Whew=\r\n, I&#39;m glad you stopped me, Sir. No tell&#39;n what kind of attack I\n&gt; &gt; could&#39;v=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; met up with. Okay, I&#39;m definitely in on helping you out. But how are =\r\nwe\n&gt; &gt; gonna\n&gt; &gt; get the Ark back without getting blown ta scrap?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nQuickstride looks to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, what he said, how are we gonna=\r\n get outa this mess? This is \n&gt; &gt; something\n&gt; &gt; neither one of us has ever =\r\nencountered.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yaho=\r\no!
