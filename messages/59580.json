Just a couple of important facts to bear in\nmind-\n1. Shadowcaster was so good at keeping himself and his\n1 man warr hidden during the great War that he became\na Cybertronian Urban myth if you will.\n\n2. Shadowcaster is Rattrap&#39;s son\n\n3. Tankorr I suggest you check out the post &#39;A hero\nreborn to get the right perspective on how the other\ncharacters who were in the Beast Wars feel about\nShadowcaster. The short version is that during the\nbeast wars he went a little nuts- nothing insane, but\nhe used maximal and predacon alike in an obsessive\nattempt at revenge at Megatron for killing Rattrap&#39;s\nmother and his mate.  After a major defeat by\nMegatron, he decided that the only way to defeat him\nwas to gain strength from the matrix of leadership,\nwhich reformatted him into a TM3 and the former\nleaders inside the matrix made his lay his ghosts to\nrest and he became an heroic Guardian to the Maximals,\nvaliantly sacrificing himself defending the Ark\nagainst the attack by Megatron using the Nemesis. As\nfar as all the characters knew, he&#39;s dead. In fact the\nonly reason that he&#39;s back alive is because Primus\nremoved his spark from the matrix and rebuilt his TM3\nbody so he could be one of his champions against\nUnicron.\n\nHope that puts things in perspective guys.\n\nhttp://personals.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
