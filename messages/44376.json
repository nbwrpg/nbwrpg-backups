But forget it for now, your fight has\nimploded.\n\n(Megatron tried desperatly to get up, and strangle the ignorant robot,\nbut moving caused his joints to tear, and they would need a second to\nreajust. Then the stun gun hit him, and caused him to roll over. He\nbegan to lose conciousness, his eyes dimming. &quot;n..no.&quot; He whispered.\n&quot;Emergency....protocall.&quot; He commanded. Then his computer hummed to\nlife, &quot;Agnolidged.&quot; Megatron&#39;s eyes faded, but the computer countinued\nto work. &quot;All remaining energy to failsafe&#39;s.&quot; Megatron&#39;s body began to\ntwitch involountarily, and then began to shrink, transforming into his\nsmaller gun mode. Luckily he had, because the enrgy wave then hit,\nsending the gun spiralling away. Thanks to his smaller mass though it\ncaused less dammage then ussual.\n\nSpasstik stopped his barrage, when he received a message from Soundwave\nwho was monitoring the battle. He began to bound towards the Welker\nfirearm.)\n\nThe Welker firearm being Megatron. Basically gunther was right, only he\nsaid Rampage instead of Spasstik.\n\n"}}
