He started wondering\nwhere he was. Looking through the ferroglass cockpit, he saw.\n\n???: That is Pluto?! It&#39;s so small! Much more than Olaf Eriksson told\nme...\n\nOlaf Eriksson was a human spacepilot he had met on his exile on Earth.\nAfter the Tripredacus took Cybertron, the remaining Maximal and\nPredacon defenders fled to Earth. Of course, the friction between the\ntwo groups was enourmous, but he had decided to be a mediator, as he\nwas a descendant of both. However, he had been deemed the only one\ncapable of going on this mission. He had dutifully accepted, but it\nhad been paining to leave Earth.\n\n???: Two more days...

He had felt that the Dark One&#39;s spark\n&gt; was not his own and that he could try to intervene in it, but it\n&gt; seemed too risky. The Tripredacus had made him strong, too strong even\n&gt; for them to resist. He would find him instantly if he went for direct\n&gt; spark contact.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another option was to tear his spark out of his chest. He knew his\n&gt; plasma blades could do this, but it was up to him to decide...\n\n\n"}}
