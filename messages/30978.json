She stretched her wings and \nfelt the wind under her wings.  She closed her eyes as she went \nhigher into the air.  She used her sonar to navigate.  It never \nfailed her before, why would it now?  She kept her face into the wind \nand enjoyed the freedom of it all.  She used her sonar again, this \ntime there was somethig right infront of her.  She opened her eyes \njust intime to see a blurr of color.  She hit something face first at \nfull speed.(Starscream)  Stunned, she started to fall to the earth, \n1500 feet below. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Starscream walks out of the base, deciding he needs a good fly to \nclear his \n&gt; head. he opens his comm::\n&gt; Starscream: Drillbit, im going for a fly, ill be back in a few.\n&gt; ::He flies around aimlessly, just trying to think::\n\n\n\n"}}
