To start out,\n&gt; read one of your recent post:\n&gt;\n&gt; ...they walked off together, coming to the Maximal base, and using a\n&gt; new device stolen from somewhere to dig under and into the\n&gt; Ark.......they destroyed all of the autoguns, becoming decently\n&gt; damaged in the process...they smiled at each other and searched until\n&gt; they found the secret location of the Autobots...\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, now: the fact that Plintissa and Sinesis used &#39;a new device\n&gt; stolen from somewhere to dig under the Ark&#39; and destroyed all the\n&gt; autoguns in one e-mail is severe moding in the first place. You\n&gt; didn&#39;t give anyone else a chance to respond. If you would have,\n&gt; though, your little mission would have been impossible due to the\n&gt; dozen or so maximals in the Ark at this point. Second, if you would\n&gt; remember, Blue Stinger got the Autobots out of the Ark, so finding\n&gt; them there would be phisically impossible. Over all, if you would\n&gt; have done this properly, you&#39;d be stopped by the shields, slagged by\n&gt; the autoguns, and chased off by the maximals that were there.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; BeMANY, where eGroups members SAVE on long distance.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4121/10/_/_/_/958514485/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
