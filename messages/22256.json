But she doubted it.\nShe rolls her eyes as she gets Prowls thoughts, not his reply. But the ones \nwhich he had looked over her body before she had transformed.\nMen!  ;)\n\nBut the beast in her mind almost seemed to urge her on, wanting her to make \nthe first move instead of talking this out.\nThough, she simply brushed it aside as easily as an after thought, the beast \nobviously offended but still there.\nHer mind snapping out at it: &quot; This is MY mind now and if you don&#39;t like it \nyou can gladly leave. You won&#39;t be missed!&quot;\nThe creature simply gave her a look as if it were calling her a bitch right \nout, then settled down.\nBut then the creature turnes on Prowls thoughts as they filter into Iron \nRaptors mind, basically growling at him and asking him how he could put up \nwith her.\n\nIron Raptor simply ignores the creature, turning her attention towards \nShadow again, the wind picking up and making the cape shift and blow around \nher. Her hair shifting about her head as the sun grew higher in the sky.\nSuddenly hearing Klusters transmission in her head, wondering just how many \ntimes he had broudcasted this until she heard the word three.\nTHREE! And the Maximals still weren&#39;t there yet!?\nThis was the first time that she had heard this, so at least she had an \nexcuse. But the others.\nIron Raptor sighed.\nEnough with this Shadow...she had Maximals to rally!\n\nIron Raptor looked towards Prowl as he contacted her through his mind, still \nfinding this all so new. Thinking how all of this had happened so quickly.\nSlumping slightly in her armor.*\n\n&lt; Yeah. I heard. Boy! Is everyone in for a few surprises...providing that \nthey ever get to base.&gt;\n\n* But then she, somehow, found the command to her new com-link and opened it \nto all the Maximal frequencies. Making her voice very clear and with \ncommand.*\n\n&quot; All Maximals, this is Iron Raptor. You&#39;ve all already been given the \ncommand to return to base. Respond to it. There is no excuse acceptable for \nnot doing so unless there is battle or you can give me a better one.\nNow, please return to base!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then deactivated the comm and looked at Prowl.*\n\n&lt; Let&#39;s get going.&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
