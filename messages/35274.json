The mutant saw a flaw to her tactics, she \nhad just\n&gt; pinned herself between Kit Kat and the other Predacons.(remember \nRobo\n&gt; whatever shots miss Silver Scout are headed towards Kit Kat2)\n&gt; \n&gt; Bullet crossed his arms deflecting the shot. his arm singed from \nthe impact.\n&gt; &quot;Be more carefull with that thing would you?&quot; he shouted toward Kit \nKat.\n&gt; There were to many bots in the halls to be endangered by friendly \nfire.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blaze aimed her disruptor, firing at the intruder three times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Silver Scout moved quickly as she could trying to avoid any further \ndamage.\n&gt; To many shots flew through the hallway to tell who was fireing or \nwhen.\n&gt; Blacknightmares stun blasts weakened her, Blazes disruptor \nscrambled her\n&gt; circuitry, and Enders sidearms pierced her organics causing more of \nthe\n&gt; strange red energeon to flow from her form.
