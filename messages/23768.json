Please keep that in mind for next time.\n\n::FZ/Lavacons/Perndabot/Repressor/Rex/Proto/Firearm/Kluster::\n\nAstral looks at FZ as he recieves Dark One&#39;s transmission. &quot;Is that a \nvalid order, sir?&quot;\n\nFZ turns his head to look at him. &quot;No,&quot; he replies. The Lavacons look \nat FZ in surprise.\n\n&quot;Attack the Cybertronian Fire, yes,&quot; FZ says in Zardus&#39; voice, now \ntransmitting to the entire Alliance force there, &quot;But if you see Iron \nRaptor, kill her. SHe&#39;s useless.&quot;\n\nThe Iron Fist&#39;s computer, acting as part of FZ&#39;s brain, was matching \nFeline&#39;s info of the CF with general information of Maximal battle \ncruisers. The codes probably wouldn&#39;t have gotten through to Iron \nRaptor. The Maximals were useless except for Kluster and Chordate. \nThose two held all the keys.\n\n&quot;THe only two Maximals we want are Chordate and Kluster. If you see \nthose two, capture them,&quot; he continues his orders, flying forward and \npulling out a missile launcher. FZ, while identical to Zardus, had a \ndifferent array of weapons. He fires. The missile glows blue as it \nheads for the shields. A shot hits it, but reflects off the glowing \nblue energy cover. It hits and explodes, sending a blue flare of \nenergy through the shields.\n\n&quot;Kill everyone else,&quot; he continues his orders, &quot;Gestalts, do not form \nyet. You&#39;d be too easy a target for the defences and for the emeny. \nWait untill they are weakened.&quot;\n\nHe ducks under autogun fire, firing two more missiles at the shields.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAstral nods at FZ&#39;s orders. &quot;You heard &#39;im!&quot; he says to his team, the \nfive flying toward the Cybertronian Fire.\n\nThey spread out, ducking under autogun shots and firing back with \ntheir rifles. THey were all using energy weapons now, trying to take \nout the shields.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRex joggs up behind the Alliance forces, panting. His jetpack had \ntaken too much damage to keep flying from the earlier battle. He aims \nat FZ&#39;s back, but is thrown to the ground by several laser shots.\n\nRepressor flies up behind him. &quot;Ha, nice try!&quot; Repressor opens fire, \nmore shots streaming toward Rex.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProto launches into the air, opening fire on Dark One. He aims his \nrapid-fire rifle carefully as he fires.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler takes aim, firing a shot at Perndabot. He growls as the \nAlliance bot ducks under the shot and fires back with two missiles. \nThe missiles hit the shields and explode.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Slag!&quot; Kluster exclaims, watching the energy readings from weapons \nhitting the shields. His eyes widen as he sees a reading from a new \nweapon. He&#39;d never seen something like it before. It seemed to be a \nmissile, but it sucked energy when it hit.\n\nHe swears. It had done quite a bit of damage to the shields, same \nwith the other Alliance attacks.\n\n&quot;Those Alliance bots are way smarter than the Preds,&quot; he notes to no \none in particular. He looks at Chordate, &quot;I&#39;m rerouting all \nunneccessary energy to the shields and weapons. We don&#39;t need lights, \nfood, or holorooms for now. Everything&#39;s going to defences. Well, and \nCRs.&quot;\n\nHe taps in a sequence on the keyboard, the lights on the bridge going \nout. It remains lit by glowing computer screens.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm stops a mile away from the Cybertronian Fire, his scanners \ndetecting gunfire.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s an attack,&quot; he says to Iris, &quot;Think you can do any good in \nbattle?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Unitron, Your bots are at the CF now, right?
