He was always a klutz, \nno matter how hard he tried he always ended up falling down or running into \nsomething. Huh, some warrior he&#39;ll be.

The sand stuck in his feathers \nwasn&#39;t helping matters either.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
