Friends find, look beh=\r\nind!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; PROFILE:  An Autobot by the name of Wheelie grew up on a=\r\n crashed ship,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; surviving for an unkonwn period of time on Quintessa.=\r\n  Found by \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Autobots\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; during the first Unicron crisis, he soon=\r\n joined them and was a stalwart\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; part\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of their forces going al=\r\non gwith the first Maximal Imperium after the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; war.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A loner o=\r\nften forming strong bonds adn freindships and with a unique \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sort\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; personality from his time spent in isolation and having to f=\r\night to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; survive,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie is often accompanied by his scrounge=\r\nr friend Gnaw, operating \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; local groups that cna tolerate=\r\n his infmay as he moves on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ABILITIES:  A permanent glitch in=\r\n his vocal processor developed by his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; long\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; period in isolatio=\r\nn upon Quintessa, Wheelie&#39;s vocalizer tends to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; vocalize\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; ways in whatever linguistic dialect that are often translated as \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &#39;rhymes&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; These tend to be high pitched, grating, and annoying, =\r\nand prolonged\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; exposure\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is held to be extremely damaging to on=\r\ne&#39;s circuits, much like Cosmic \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Rust\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and Fire Suppressant Foa=\r\nm.  As such, the sight (or sound) of Wheelie on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; battlefie=\r\nld is often enough to drive many Predacons or Decepticons to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; flee\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; and abandon the area.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie is armed with a small ene=\r\nrgon slingshot with a close range high\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; capacity load that is capable=\r\n of inflicting significant damage on \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; larger\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Cybertronians.  =\r\nHis small alt mode of a Cybertronian racer has a top \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; speed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; o=\r\nf 180 kilometers per hour and a range of over three thousand \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; kilome=\r\nters.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie himself is heavily energon efficient, even by Maximal =\r\nstandard,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; his bodyframe is capable of extended independen=\r\nt functioning without\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; refueling or repairs (which is the way many Ma=\r\nximals would profess to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; it), and is quite simplistic to=\r\n maintain that even Wheelie can keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; himself\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; basically functi=\r\nonal without medical supervision.  His small bodyframe \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; al=\r\nso quite agile and difficult to hit, combined with his long vorns \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; s=\r\npent\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; surviving have made him quite surprisingly adept at e=\r\nscape and evasion,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; guerilla operations, and reconaissance in urban o=\r\nr organic areas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Weaknesses:  Wheelie has much of a re=\r\nputation, deserved or not, among\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Autobots and Decepticons.  While he=\r\n can count some as staunch friends, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ability to seemingly=\r\n inflict insanity to those in constant presence of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; chatt=\r\nering has made many Autobots and Maximals wish to avoid prolonged\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in=\r\nteractions with him, and can lead to his constant solo operations in \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; field without backup.  This has also lead to a constant but\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unsubstantiated\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; threats of violence to be inflicted upon him by=\r\n his own faction, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; depending\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; on how casual the company is.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie&#39;s form, while agile, is very small and very vulnerable,=\r\n and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lacks\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; power.  He is weak physically, and his primary we=\r\napon (an energon\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; slingshot)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; has a very limited range, and eve=\r\nn low powered energy weapons can \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; inflict\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; significant damage =\r\nupon him.  In a hand to hand fight he is seriously\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; vulnerable to dam=\r\nage and can take few hits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; History:  Wheelie spent unk=\r\nnown thousands of vorns as the only survivor \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; crashed ship upon Quintessa, where upon his rescue he became a stalwart=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; part\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of the AUtobot forces, most often operating on long ran=\r\nge reconaissance\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; missions or as backup to his friends.  After the Au=\r\ntobot/Decepticon War\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ended, and many of his friends went into retire=\r\nment, Wheelie was not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; upgraded along with teh initial wave of Maxima=\r\nl upgrading, preferring \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; keep his original body as a memor=\r\ny to those whom had been lost in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; war.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Pending the=\r\n end of the war, Wheelie&#39;s whereabouts became much fo a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mystery,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; with various stories at any point theorizing he had been killed in a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; back\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; alley by Autobot/Decepticons (most often accompanied by &#39;=\r\nI&#39;LL DRINK TO\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; THAT!&#39; in Maccadam&#39;s) to that he was working with th M=\r\naximal Security\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Administration.  One theroy even stated that he had =\r\nbeen part of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Maximal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Experimentation Program that had pro=\r\nduced Protoform X, simply stating \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; he was what had drive=\r\nn the unit that would eventually call itself \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Rampage\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; total sociopathy and nihilism simply from being locked in a cell for \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiments!  Many would explain their decline to believe i=\r\nn Primus by\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; saying &#39;He made that guy, didn&#39;t he?&#39; and gesture to the=\r\n MiniBot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (Un)fortunately, Wheelie has been still functioning=\r\n over the era, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; living\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Cybertron, often going on tr=\r\nips to search the galaxy and find more\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; information.  While there, he=\r\n would spend much of his time in Little \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Iacon\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; remiscing of t=\r\nhe old days.  Upon attemptimg to join a craft, according \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nscuttleaft a Maximal hit upon the idea of sending him along with Leo&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; reinforcement crew to Earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Further scuttleaft was hoping=\r\n that by sending him several tens of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thousands\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of vorns back =\r\nin time and to active military conflict would &#39;get the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; little\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n cans to be recycled&#39;, but were never actively confirmed as transfer \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; orders\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; were sent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
