Iron Fist defends itself\n\n\n&gt; ::Zardus/Breakdown/Scavanger/Hiss/Reptilica/Bloodystrike/Perndabot::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus reaches for his weapon as Panzertron explains about the alarms, but\n&gt; remembers that he had checked his weapons in. Zardus&#39; eyes narrow as he\nlooks\n&gt; at the monitor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I may be of some help here...&quot; he says to Panzertron, activating his\n&gt; comm-link.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Dark One, some destrons are attacking the Iron Fist. Can you take your\ngroup\n&gt; and attack at their base?&quot; he says into the device.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well,&quot; Dark One&#39;s voice replies, sounding like was carrying something,\n&quot;Me\n&gt; and Pyro are kinda dragging the prisoners to the torture chambers.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus&#39; eyes widen, &quot;Any reason?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Maximals are apparently more suicidal than we had thought. Tigerhawk\ntried\n&gt; to rescue them. Alone. Now we&#39;re showing them what happens from that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Good. In that case....&quot; Zardus pauses, looking down at his wrist comp,\n&gt; checking the locations of all Alliance bots. He switches his comm-link to\n&gt; transmit to all Alliance members, &quot;Reptilica, Bloodystrike, Hiss,\nScavanger,\n&gt; Breakdown, and Scattershot, please pay a little visit to our destron\nfriends.\n&gt; Attack their base untill they are forced to retreat from the Iron Fist,\nthen\n&gt; back down.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Breakdown, Scavanger, Hiss and Scattershot set off for the Destron base,\n&gt; leaving their repairs on the base unfinished.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Perndabot&#39;s eyes winden as BrightBlade answers. &quot;A stealth mission?!\nYou&#39;re\n&gt; planning to infultrate a fully functional ship that is surrounded by miles\nof\n&gt; grasland. That&#39;s sui-&quot; he&#39;s interrupted by Bloodystrike walking up to him,\n&gt; failing to see Gangon&#39;s spark.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bloodystrike looks up at Perndabot craining his neck up to look at the\nother\n&gt; bot. &quot;Hear that?,&quot; he asks, refferring to Zardus&#39; transmission, &quot;Ya mind\n&gt; tossin&#39; me Reptilica?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perndabot growls, easily tossing Reptilica to Bloodystrike. Bloodystrike\n&gt; quickly runs off, dragging Reptilica toward the Destron base. He&#39;d wake up\non\n&gt; the way, Bloodystrike figures, jumping over a bush.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perndabot looks back at BrightBlade, his eyes sliding down her body, but\nthen\n&gt; to the spark in front of her. &quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; he asks, taking out his gun\njust\n&gt; in case.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Wish you had something rad to add to your email?\n&gt; We do at www.supersig.com.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6807/13/_/_/_/963607095/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
