We all know the rpg seems to bog down\n&gt; these days. Rauq, \n&gt; Rudra and I will do something about it, and changes,\n&gt; hopefully for the \n&gt; better, will come sooner or later. \n&gt;   However, the council may be an important part of\n&gt; the rpg, but they \n&gt; are merely players amongst others. For this reason,\n&gt; it is important \n&gt; for everyone to reply to the posts concerning their\n&gt; characters AS \n&gt; OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. I do not ask ten posts daily, but\n&gt; maybe posting \n&gt; every two days would be a good start. With the end\n&gt; of the school year, \n&gt; I know everyone will not always be posting ready. I\n&gt; can understand \n&gt; that.\n&gt;   Also, LN gave me and Rauq a lot to think about.\n&gt; His arguments had a \n&gt; lot of interest, in my opinion, and they could serve\n&gt; for ameliorating \n&gt; the game. If you have suggestions that you feel\n&gt; could help us in that \n&gt; sense, please, do like LN (well, except dropping all\n&gt; chars, lol!) and \n&gt; give us feedbacks about the way you feel in this\n&gt; rpg. This council, \n&gt; after all, is here for the players and as players as\n&gt; well. If everyone \n&gt; gets really into it, we can and we will make this a\n&gt; lot better.\n&gt;   Rudra, Rauq, tell me if I screwed up. BTW, Rudra,\n&gt; I&#39;ll send some \n&gt; stuff to you so you can get back in the train.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
