Her data banks were \nrunning on high, transfering the information to Vulios.  She dreamed \nthat she was walking down a path in the forest.  She saw Cybershark \nstanding there.  He stood there, then turned and walked away.  She \nShe ran after him, calling to him.  She was about to catch up to him, \nwhen he dissappeared.  She called out,&quot;CyberShark!&quot;  But heard only \nher own echo bouncing around in the forest.  \n\nShe muttered in her sleep,&quot;CyberShark...&quot;\n\nShe then turned and saw Vulios.  She called out to him too, but he \ndissappeared into the mist of the forest.  She turned and saw Hell \nBeast there, right next to her.  She screamed and tried to run, but \nhe reached out and caught her.  The next thing she knew, she had a \ncollar around her neck.  And Hell Beast was holding the leash that \nconnected to her collar.  She was sitting next to Hell Beast as he \nsat on a throne made of transformer parts.  She was a prisoner, her \nworst nightmare was unfolding before her.  She was forsed to look on \nas Hell Beast had CyberShark and Vulois in cages, dangling over a pit \nof molten lava. She pleaded and begged, but Hell Beast just laughed.  \nHell Beast told her that for her leaving him in the first place, it \nwould cost her the lives of her friends.  She tried to fly up, but \nHell Beast pulled on the leash and she fell to the ground, in front \nof Hell Beast.   She pleaded again for the life of her friends.  She \nlooked at Cybershark.  She looked, and he was staring back at her.  \nShe blinked and then instead of cybershark, it was a dead, decaying \nform of him.  THe same with Vulios.  She saw thier rotting corpses in \nthe cages with Hell Beast tugging  on her leash, and laughing at her.\nShe started to cry at the site of her dead friends. \n\nShe started to cry in her sleep.\n\n\n"}}
