Sure they have alway=\r\ns\n&gt; been aggressive and stubborn and rebellious, but they always seemed to\n=\r\n&gt; stop just short of outright attacking, at least with the Autobots.\n&gt; \n&gt; B=\r\nut then again not much was heard from them once the great wars were\n&gt; over =\r\nand the peace accord set in. Most people may have thought they\n&gt; went their=\r\n own way, perhaps to fight wars elsewhere in the galaxy, or\n&gt; perhaps they =\r\nfinally learned the ways of peace. There were many\n&gt; Autobots who were unab=\r\nle to stop their violent ways after the war had\n&gt; ended, and had to taken i=\r\nn by the Peace Keepers to be re-educated. But\n&gt; surely GRIMLOCK and his men=\r\n were not among those, no never them. Their\n&gt; contribution to the war had b=\r\neen too great, too important, their\n&gt; legacy to important.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, not the=\r\n Dinobots . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS looked at WHEELIE and nodded. &quot;If those other one=\r\ns were not your\n&gt; friends, then who are they?&quot; The question somewhat rhetor=\r\nical as he\n&gt; ruminated over the question.\n&gt; \n&gt; DARKHOOF looked confused, &quot;T=\r\nhey had the symbol that the other one\n&gt; described.&quot; He said pointing at the=\r\n door, behind which RODIMUS was\n&gt; laying.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a friendly smile f=\r\nrom UNUS as he put a comforting hand on\n&gt; DARKHOOF, &quot;If they were not indiv=\r\niduals that this one has met, they\n&gt; can still be part of his people.&quot; He n=\r\nodded to him, &quot;I am sure you did\n&gt; rightly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; DARKHOOF nodded a smile o=\r\nn his face again. He seemed young, if he were\n&gt; human he would probrably be=\r\n in his late teens somewhere, perhaps his\n&gt; early twenties. Young and impre=\r\nssionable, full of hope.\n&gt; \n&gt; And the hope is dimmed.\n&gt; \n&gt; DARKHOOF paused =\r\nfor a moment and then looked at UNUS and then the\n&gt; others like ASTRA, FIRE=\r\nHORN and then his optics coming to rest on\n&gt; WHEELIE. &quot;I left Raintree to w=\r\natch after I left. She is really good at\n&gt; that.&quot; He said, a small selfcons=\r\ncious smile on his face for a moment\n&gt; before he continued. &quot;Your friends .=\r\n . . I mean the others with that\n&gt; symbol that we were told to watch for, t=\r\nhe wheeled vehicle.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He paused, &quot;Raintree said one of them called him =\r\nNightshift was\n&gt; heavilly damaged, another, the commander she thinks was al=\r\nso damaged\n&gt; heavily, but they escaped to their shuttle.&quot; DARKHOOF looked u=\r\np at\n&gt; UNUS, &quot;Swoop was chasing them at the end as they took off. The shutt=\r\nle\n&gt; took heavy damage from Grimlock and Slag.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What of the other, th=\r\ne dragon.&quot; UNUS said gently.\n&gt; \n&gt; DARKHOOF paused for a moment, obviously i=\r\nn communication with\n&gt; RAINTREE, &quot;She says that he was weakened by his batt=\r\nle with Grimlock\n&gt; and his men and was taken away by some of Magamtron&#39;s fo=\r\nrces, led by\n&gt; Guiledart.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS nodded sagely. &quot;That is not good, that=\r\n is not good at all.&quot; He\n&gt; looked over at WHEELIE, &quot;Are there any more of y=\r\nour kind here? Perhaps\n&gt; you warn them of what is going on?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Which is =\r\nofcourse an interesting proposition, except that despite the\n&gt; fact that th=\r\ne Cornu appear to be communicating, the Maximal (and\n&gt; Predacon) radio&#39;s st=\r\nill appear to still be down.\n\n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nWHEELIE was lost over in co=\r\nntemplation.  The DINOBOTS had never been openly hostile to other Autobots,=\r\n and thsi would have transferred over to MAXIMALS as well in theory.  But h=\r\ne had not heard from his friends mostly since the end of the GREAT WAR.  Wh=\r\nat had changed in that period of time that had shifted?  From the mere snip=\r\npets of stories he had heard, it did not sound as if the DINOBOTS had been =\r\nreprogramed in any such way.\n\nMuch less literally a full scale assault over=\r\n upon a shuttle, an act which he could not fathom them doing.  Either they =\r\nwere not control of their own shells, they were merely lookalikes in some w=\r\nay..  Or something horrible had happened the likes of which he could not ia=\r\nmgine.\n\nGetting static over from his communicator and not able to pick up a=\r\nnything beyond visual range on his scanners, he could not leave here to sea=\r\nrch for anyone without the possibility of going through thousands of kilome=\r\nters of rainforest in random directions with no guarantee of finding anyone=\r\n.\n\nWHEELIE paused quietly, and as he lsitened to the two, he took out a sma=\r\nll datapadd, and on it he began taking notes.  Of MAGMATRON, of SABREBACK. =\r\n Of this small outpost out in the middle of nowhere.  Of the incapacitated =\r\nRODIMUS.  Of the escapees who were hiding.  Writing it to try and make it m=\r\nake sense.  Using an old Quintesson binary sequencing which was obvious eno=\r\nugh to anyone who knew the language, but he didn&#39;t expect many Maximals of =\r\nthis era who were not historians to have had any encounters with it, which =\r\nmade it safe enough to record his thoughts in.\n\nGlancing over at the group =\r\nas they came out, he said simply, &quot;We wait.  Eventually, things will abate.=\r\n&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
