He activates his\n&gt; comm-link, sending a transmission to all Alliance troops in the area (I\nthink\n&gt; that&#39;s all of them but Feline, Skulletron, and Perndabot).\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Alliance bots,&quot; the transmission reads, &quot;There is a battle against the\n&gt; Maximals several clicks northeast of the base. Stranato, Inzola, Burning\n&gt; Hammer, can you back the Alliance troops up? Starscream, I&#39;d apreciate if\nyou\n&gt; help to. I&#39;ll send the Oblitercons to help against Megatron later on.\nGotron,\n&gt; please go and help Wheeljack retrieve a probe? After you two have it\nsecure\n&gt; in the base, you go to the battle. Wheeljack should stay and run a few\ntests\n&gt; on it. I&#39;ll be arriving at the fight shortly.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns around as he ends the transmission, looking at Sickle and\nmotioning\n&gt; for him to follow as he heads out of the bridge. &quot;Do you know if you can\n&gt; fight at all?&quot; he asks him, glancing back over his shoulder.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Dark One recieves Zardus&#39; orders, looking back at Squizzy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hurry,&quot; he says, &quot;Let&#39;s get to the CR chambers. I need to get back to the\n&gt; battle.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer barely jumps out of the way of the shots, hearing Zardus&#39;\n&gt; transmission with relief. Soon, there would be reinforcements. That would\nbe\n&gt; very welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; He fires another shot as his stun gun finally runs out of energy,\nDevilDuer\n&gt; quickly swapping it for a small rifle and firing again at Astral.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scavenger ducks as he hears a yell behind him, an optic blast grazing his\n&gt; shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; He spins around, a rocket launcher apearing in his hand from subspace,\nfiring\n&gt; two rockets at Fenox.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Pyro smiles evilly at Giplash, jumping back and standing ready.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Very well. I can kill you that way too,&quot; he says, one hand moving behind\nhis\n&gt; back, the other holding his sword steady.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Breakdown shakes as shots from the pistol hit him, the artillery cannon\n&gt; spinning around.\n&gt;\n&gt; The heavily armored wheels start to turn, sending him driving toward\n&gt; Starlight, firing a rocket at her from the cannon.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Hiss yells as a beam hits him in the stomach, sending him spinning down to\n&gt; the ground. He stops himself a few feet above the tress, burning pain\ncoming\n&gt; from his abdomen.\n&gt;\n&gt; Transforming into his much smaller gun mode, Hiss flies up again, firing\nshot\n&gt; after shot at Recklessa.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
