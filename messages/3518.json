So they decide to retreat back to the base. Triceradon transforms to beastmode and charges away. Stegotron follows right behind him. Ultracon takes up the rear and fires his gun at the Predacons making sure they didn&#39;t follow them. \nnbwrpg@egroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ultracon must have hit Double Punch because he could hear his voice. Two missiles hit him in the back knocked him to the ground. He got back up slowly and fired again at where he thought Double Punch was.\n&gt; Triceradon tried to block as many of Bumblebee&#39;s missiles as he could with his shield, but hit him in the chest and knocked him on his butt. He got back up,(more slowly this time) and went bezerk with his guns firing all around him at anybody.\n&gt; Stegotron just barely dodged the missiles comming at him but the ion disk from Manterror sliced right through his left arm. \n&gt; Stegotron: Slaggin Predacons!!! \n&gt; Ticeradon:Predacon Scum!!! \n&gt; nbwrpg@egroups.com wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Double Punch/Bumblebee/Injector/Manterror:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Double Punch slammed into a tree, Beeline exploding. �&quot;Slaggin&#39; Maxis.&quot; he \n&gt; &gt; said, firing two missiles at Ultracon&#39;s back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bumblebee yelped as he moved to the left, letting the grenade hit a tree, \n&gt; &gt; bark and metal cutting into his face. �Raising both stinger missile \n&gt; &gt; launchers, he pulled the trigger for each three times, six stinger missiles \n&gt; &gt; heading for Triceradon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Injector yelled as he saw the rock he was behind chip away rapidly. �Crawling \n&gt; &gt; to the left, he took aim, firing three stinger missiles at Stegotron&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; abdomen.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Manterror looked up, seeing the other Predacons fighting. �Raising an arm, \n&gt; &gt; keeping an eye on Ramulus, he fired an ion disk at Stegotron&#39;s left arm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------\n&gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://home.netscape.com/webmail/\n&gt; \n\n----------\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://home.netscape.com/webmail/\n\n"}}
