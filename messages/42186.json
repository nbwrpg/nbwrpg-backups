I was with Prebon when we left Predacon\njuristiction but unfortunately I became the first casualty. Judging by\nIgnatius&#39; memory and the last recorded records I guess things aren&#39;t going\nwell for us.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile not very far away Prebon watches infrared scans of the two\nTrainers. Something seemed familiar about them. The Eagle had been in his\ndream but the other one was unknown. &quot;I knew him once, or at least a unit\nlike him.&quot; he tried to focus but his memories betrayed him.  Scanning the\nbox he found something even more peculiar. His own signature resinated from\nthe bots recognition program. Thinking back as far as he could remember\nsomething clicked. A message flashed through his mind, his body locked in\nplace, &quot;Prebon, I&#39;m sure you know me. If this message is being played your\ncircuitry has either been damaged or altered. A backup program can be\ninitiated simple by saying my name. If you haven&#39;t figured it out yet, I AM\nPREBON&quot;\n\nThe trainer units functions became unlocked as he realized what the Preds\nhad done to him. &quot;They will pay for what they&#39;ve done, so swears PREBON&quot; As\nhis name is spoken the backup memory was activated reloading everything that\nhad happened to him up to the point he&#39;d been overpowered at the Black\nfortress. Now revitalized he had a score to settle.\n\nActivateing his jetpack he flew toward the box. &quot;Stand down Trainers, your\ncommander has spoken.&quot;\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 22, 2001 11:58 PM\nSubject: Re: OOC: / Slayer\n\n\n&gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt;\n&gt; Slayer raises an eyebrow at Ignatius&#39;s last statement,unsure what the bot\nwas trying to say.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asks, frowning and looking at the contents of the\nbox.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ignatius scanned the box, it responded by downloading the index of the\n&gt; &gt; boxxes contents.
