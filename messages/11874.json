He hoped that they would accept his offer.\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; Decadel picked up a transmission from another bot just as he was about to\n&gt; walk into the base.  He looked back and saw Hakibuscon.  He walked over to\n&gt; Hakibuscon.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Listen you, this better not be a trick!  I will take you to the leader,\n&gt; and she can listen to your deal!&quot; He said as he grabbed Hakibuscon, and\n&gt; walked into the base with his gun pointed at Hakibuscon&#39;s head.  He\nbrought\n&gt; Hakibuscon to where Blackarachnia was.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Your honor, I have brought this bot to you, he wants to make a deal with\n&gt; us,&quot; Decadel said and shoved Hakibuscon towards Blackarachnia, then walked\n&gt; off and tried to find Paralysis, so he could get assigned some quarters.\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; Hakibuscon looked at Blackarachnia.  He had seen her before, when he was\n&gt; spying on a Predacon base.  Yes, these guys were Predacons alright.  He\n&gt; stared at Blackarachnia, and tried to keep his fear hidden.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;My name is Hakibuscon.  I have traveled far, and I need you to help me,\n&gt; by sheltering me here.  Also, if you don&#39;t mind, could I have some\n&gt; weaponry?  I lost all of my other weapons in a little accident.  If you do\n&gt; this, I will help you fight against those idiotic Maximals you are trying\n&gt; to destroy,&quot; He said, although doubted they&#39;d let him stay, as Predacons\n&gt; were cold-hearted.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
