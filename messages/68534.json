A\nslight energy signature told him the the Maximals were already in route\nas well. It would be a race to the finish.\n\nReaching out a clawed hand Vorpral opened a communication channel,\n&quot;Krytek, how are the experiments proceeding.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sir.&quot; came the swift reply. &quot;The experiment is a 87% completion. All\nresults appear positive.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good. Keep me advised. Vorpal out.&quot; He chuckled again, perhaps that\nintruder would serve a useful pupose after all. Soon he would have his\nown set of warriors stronger and more resilient then sweeps - then\nperhaps Unicron would not need Cyclonus. Vorpral brooded darkly. But\nthen again there are always good uses to put wariors to. \n\nVorpal finally turned to the image of Unicron that had been standing\ninert in the center of his throne room. While Vorpal was ever loyal to\nthe dark diety, having him sit there so close was always unerving. \n\n&quot;Lord Unicron.&quot; Vorpal spoke finally to the image of Unicron, &quot;All is\nnearing readiness. The Maximals are without the Matrix and the Pedicons\nare about to be other wise engaged and the original holder of the\nMatrix will be destroyed.&quot; Vorpal chuckled, &quot;What is your desire lord?&quot;\n\n((OOC: Airly I sent you some Private Email))\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nYou rock.
