She couldn&#39;t understand why \nthey all wanted to have a peace all of a sudden.  She had always \nthought that with this many maximals and predacons in such close \nquarters, they would have an all out fight. But yet, no one fired a \nsingle shot.  This whole situation made her very nervous.  She looked \nup at Destructor.  He had said he would help protect her, but had the \nclassic question running through her mind.  If he&#39;s protecting her, \nwho&#39;s protecting him?\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Magnus nodded. I know but it is the best we can do. Also ask your \nleader if \n&gt; he isinterested in this peace between these factions.&quot; he walked \nover to the \n&gt; ash that once was the ark. He looked for any salvagable material.\n\n\n"}}
