She had one bot with his hand in the \npod trying to reach her(Koj) several bots fighting and yelling(Hell \nBeast, Taransulus) and now this bot.  She didn&#39;t know who they were \nor waht they wanted from her.  The stories that her father and mother \ntold her about strange bots were going through her mind.  She was \nstarting to get scared.  She crouched against the padding on the \ninside of the pod and growled. &quot;Who are you bots? I don&#39;t want any \ntrouble. And if you know what&#39;s best for you, you&#39;d better tell me \nwho you are and what you want.&quot; She was trying her best to act brave \nand fearless, but her little legs trembled under her.  She roared \nout, which wasn&#39;t that impressive either, showing off her large saber \ntooth fangs. &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to hurt you, so you&#39;d better speak \nup.&quot; trying to sound threatening. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Jason Lind&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Arcangel\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; he saw a stasis pod with a kitten on it sp he knew it had to be a \nchild. he \n&gt; walked over and heard the baby talking about her parents.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Arcangel:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;[this is to Logomorph new char.] hello could I help you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; he did not want to hurt it or put terror in its life but he was \nhalf on \n&gt; fire. then he thought that this will make a good one.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
