And as for another idea, I am\n&gt; currently working on one with \n&gt; Rauq.  Another thing this RPG needs is some good\n&gt; strict rules and someone to \n&gt; enforce them. Say I was just joining, seeing someone\n&gt; fire 40 shots and \n&gt; someone dodge them really turns me off and think the\n&gt;  RPG is a waste of my \n&gt; time because just from those posts I believe most of\n&gt; the people have to be \n&gt; moding. thats on example but I know things are\n&gt; trying to be changed by rauq \n&gt; and azure.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
