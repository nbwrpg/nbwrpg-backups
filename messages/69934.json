He was ecst=\r\natic about the change, yet he couldn&#39;t quite express that joy in front of H=\r\nydras, Cyclonus, Scorponok, or Rodimus, in fear of exposing his true factio=\r\nn.  Instead he makes a rather angry scowl.\n\n&quot;Slag!  Son of a Glitch! How&#39;d =\r\nhe do that?!  I swear I kicked his aft from here ta the next galaxy, I don&#39;=\r\nt get it!  Look, I dunno how he did that, and when he did it, but he just s=\r\nnatched up the power from Prime&#39;s matrix!  Should&#39;ve expected it though, se=\r\nen&#39; he&#39;s actually related ta the bot.  Okay, so what I got ta tell ya is I =\r\nthink he&#39;s plann&#39;n an all out assault on you guys, like tryn&#39; ta take this =\r\nplace for the Maximals and Autobots.  Wants ta level the fortress ta the gr=\r\nound.  What I think we gotta do is beat &#39;em at his own game.  And he knows =\r\nwe&#39;re gonna try&#39;n get at the Ark, and if we go there, we&#39;re done for.  See?=\r\n It&#39;s not easy gettn&#39; around the guy because he ain&#39;t your average scrap he=\r\nap.  He don&#39;t think like an average Autobot.  So, if I were you guys, that =\r\nshell program you got gon&#39; on, I think ya better have a bot make a backup o=\r\nf that&#39;n hold onto it.  Because he&#39;s gonna try&#39;n blow this place sky high, =\r\nand everything with it.  And as far as I know he&#39;ll be barrelln&#39; in here wi=\r\nth the rest of his posse any time now.&quot;\n\nOf course he was telling them a co=\r\nmplete lie, hoping they&#39;d buy it.  His tone shows no indication of telling =\r\na fib.  Inside he was hoping that his idea mixed with Tucson&#39;s would take h=\r\nold.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Speak&quot;said the male to Cyclonus\n&gt; \n&gt; Next to Hydras a small v=\r\niew screen came to life and began to show a\n&gt; short clip of a large truck l=\r\nike vehicle that was leaving the Ark,\n&gt; bearing a distinctive likeness to O=\r\nptimus Prime, almost like a cross\n&gt; between his Earthen mode and his origin=\r\nal cybertronian mode. There was\n&gt; the cab front and the trailer on back, th=\r\ne trailer sporting two large\n&gt; and fearsome looking missiles. The truck loo=\r\nked powerful enough and\n&gt; regugged enough to roll over the most inhospitabl=\r\ne terrain without\n&gt; slowing. It was currently moving at a sedate 55 mph.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;From the reading I am getting that is . . . or was . . . Tuscon.&quot;\n&gt; Cyc=\r\nlonus paused to let the import of his next words to sink in, &quot;I\n&gt; believe t=\r\nhey have found a way to utilize the Matrix.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
