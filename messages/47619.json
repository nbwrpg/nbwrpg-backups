(20 feet being the bumble bee sizes/wheelie sizes\nwhich were far from the norm ;) but still compared to bumble bee they&#39;d be\nmidgets...and i know the cassette bots were smaller still...actually that&#39;s\nwhat BW/BM reminds me of...all the transformers have changed into the\ncassette transformers !)\n\n\n"}}
