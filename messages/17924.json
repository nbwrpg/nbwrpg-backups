She \ntried to reach out again and make a connection, but this time, she \nwas more careful in where she tried to connect to.   She found the \nconsole screen again and made her words appear on the screen.\n&quot;Hello?&quot;\nShe started to feel something strange. But couldn&#39;t make out the \ncause. Then she tried to reastablish all the connections she had made \nearlier, but very carefully and one at a time. She found them all in \na few short minutes and was once again, moving the protoform&#39;s arm \nup. The arm raised straight up into the air and clentched a fist. She \ngot excited again. She wasn&#39;t able to move the hand like that before \nand was overwhelmingly happy about her achievement.  She tried to \nmake the other hand move,  it did, it clenched up as well. She typed \nup the words on the screen,&quot;YAAHHOOOO! I did it! I did it!&quot;\n\nBut making the form move was like controling a crane arm.  She was \ncontroling it, but is didn&#39;t feel like it was her arm, or apart of \nher.  More like controling a joy stick which operated the arm.  It \nwasn&#39;t apart of her. But if she has some control, then that meant she \nmay not be totally helpless after all.  She lowered the arm and tried \nsomething different.  She tried to raise the head.  It came up about \ntwo inches off the table, the rested back down.  She didn&#39;t want to \nstop. She was like a child with a new toy. She was having fun. \n\n\n"}}
