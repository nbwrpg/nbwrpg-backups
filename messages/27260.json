Please, for your safety, do not try to cross the \nfield\n&gt; prematurely. First we would like you, for our safety, to leave your \nweapons\n&gt; on the outside surface of the defense field - they will remain \nsuspended\n&gt; there until you return. After you have done so, a five meter by \nfive meter\n&gt; opening will appear. Please then proceed to the camp site on the \nnorthern\n&gt; most point of the south island, we will do business there.&quot; End \ntransmission\n\n\n"}}
