He then\n&gt; looked to the rest of his comerades, the confidence returning to his\n&gt; face, so as not to show the others his moment of weakness. &quot;We do as he\n&gt; says.&quot; Hook told Scrapper, leaping into the air, &quot;Constructicons,\n&gt; transform, phase one.&quot; he said, as he shifted in midair, his arms\n&gt; hooking in, his legs turning over, and his torso extending from his\n&gt; body, as his crane became apparant. He shrieked a loud cry of pain in\n&gt; his transformation, and landed on the ground in truck mode, creating a\n&gt; large thud from his mechanical weight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scrapper knelt down onto his hands, as they too transformed, as he\n&gt; lowered to the ground in his steam shoovel mode, followed by Bonecrusher\n&gt; and Scavanger who also shifted. Longhaul and Mixmaster then finished\n&gt; their transformations as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hook drove out to the front, very slowly, &quot;Transform phase two.&quot; he\n&gt; shouted, as Scavanger and Mixmaster both drove up, and transformed,\n&gt; their, Scavanger shifting to stand up on his shovel, as Mixmaster did\n&gt; the same, as they both shimmered in their transformations. Longhaul&#39;s\n&gt; truck form took off from the ground, and shifted in mid air, connecting\n&gt; to the two legs to form an impressive lower body, as he two shimmered.\n&gt; Hook followed, barrely making it to the body, and connectin as the chest\n&gt; part, and shimmering as well. Bonecrusher and Scavanger followed,\n&gt; hooking on the the sides of Hook, and begin to shimmer, but strangely\n&gt; Bonecrusher quickly stops shimmering, and falls off in a loud klang, as\n&gt; the rest of Devastator begins to crumble as well, (Okay, you guys can\n&gt; post now :).\n&gt; \n&gt; Hooks lands on his side, transforming, and screams clutching his\n&gt; shoulder.\n\n\n"}}
