This happened a lot when she was first created, had to learn to \ncontrol that beast of a mode.\nIt had taken her YEARS to master it and now, since she had been reborn in \nthis new body, it was beginning to push its luck.\nThe damage she had obtained from Vehement hadn�t helped either.  She�d had a \nbit of trouble avoiding the signature seeking shots and one had actually got \nher, which hadn�t left any wound but too a good hunk out of her armor and \nknocked the breath from her lungs.\nBut now the voice echoed in her mind while she blinked past the ash and \ntried to look towards the CF.\nThe shield were still holding she noticed, but even her scanners were \ndetecting that they wouldn�t last forever.\nAnd while she thought of that, the voice began yammering.*\n\nSBM: �  Don�t think that, just because you escaped me once by dying that you \ncan just believe that I never existed. As long as that spark beats within \nthat chest I�ll be there, like a the darker part of your own shadow.�\n\n* Iron Raptor glanced around the battlefield, groaning when she scanned a \ngustalt forming.\nJust what she needed.\nShe coughed from the thick air and felt her opened side sting, the area \naround the wound becoming numb from the loss of mech fluid there.\nIt was prying at her mind, clawing it�s way towards her main systems so that \nit could load itself into them and become something of what it was before. \nBut it sensed something was there, maybe the Matrix. Puzzling it and making \nit look the situation over again until it discovered it�s power.*\n\nSBM: � This could be useful�.�\n\n* Without warning it seemed to turn and coil around the power of the Matrix \nthat beat deep inside of her spark, harnessing the power and using that to \nrebuild it�s program.\nIt didn�t hurt and she wasn�t too worried about it, but it wasn�t comforting \nto know that a nightmare could start any day now like before.\nBut�finally�..*\n\nSBM: � Now, do it!�\n\n* She couldn�t help herself.*\n\n� ULTRA BEAST MODE!!!�\n\n* In her mind, white light spilled in and blinded everything, all awearness \nof the outside world disappeared.\nThe sword dropped from her grasp, falling to the ground with a clang seconds \nbefore the trasnformation. The image of the giant beast seemed to come \nstraight from her back before the sheere size of it blocked out her small \nimage, the image of the beast solidifying with a roar that almost deafened \nall the noise of the battle. Echoing out towards every being.\nIt�s horrid mouth closed, the entire form standing 20 ft, towering over the \nheads of the normal transformers on the field.\nAll traces of the fembot were gone, the black form of the Nostelga standing \nin her place.\nThe transformation was complete. However, as her form had disappeared, her \nmind ruled that of the creatures.\nBut, not like before, not, instead of flesh there was armor, full ultrametal \narmor.\nThe BEAST was BACK!*\n\n\n\n* Iris moved in through the fog, keeping her eyes peeled for any target that \nmight come into range.\nHer shoulder was badly torn from the missile sent by Reflector before, the \narmor peeled back and mech-fluid oozing from the wound.  But she kept a \nstiff upper lip.\nHer rifle loaded for another round, she continued to stalk the ash until a \nsound reached her scanners.\nIris�s eyes snapped open and she stared out into the field�where a nightmare \nwas waiting.\n&lt; Oh�no�.&gt;\nHad the beast survived?*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
