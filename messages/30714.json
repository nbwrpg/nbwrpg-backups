Or anything else.

Why do bots leave in the \n&gt; first place? Why can&#39;t they just stay here forever?&quot;  She swatted \nher \n&gt; paw at a weed sticking up out of the ground,&quot;I don&#39;t like the \nMatrix. \n&gt; It&#39;s mean. Worse than that spider bot I met once. I don&#39;t get it. \nMom \n&gt; and Dad were Maximals.  So does the Matrix only take Maximals?  And \n&gt; if I&#39;m a predacon, then that means I won&#39;t see my mommy and daddy \n&gt; ever again huh?&quot;  She sniffled. &quot;It&#39;s just not fair and I don&#39;t \nlike \n&gt; it.
