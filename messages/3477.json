This was too much. He jumps up, flipping in the air, and landing\n&gt;in front of DarkMouse in time for Hell Beast&#39;s shot and several others to \n&gt;hit\n&gt;him.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s get out of here!&quot; He yells to the maximals around him, offering\n&gt;DarkMouse a hand to help her stand up.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;Striker rolls behind another tree as missiles shred the one he was behind. \n&gt;He\n&gt;jumps out from behind it, his wolf beast form jumping across the \n&gt;battlefield\n&gt;to land near Ramhorn, grabbing him by an arm and dragging him off a bit.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Yes, let&#39;s do,&quot; he replies to Ramulus as he sees the predacons arrive.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
