His Chaingun blew up the \nMissle, before it made contact. Rhinox then looked at Key. &quot;Damn I \nneed to get her to a cr chamber.&quot; Rhinox looked up and saw Koga&#39;s \nMissle, but it was to late. There was only one chance. Rhinox jumped \ntowards the missle.....\n\nThe missle exploded against Rhinox&#39;s right arm. His Chain Gun was \ndestroyed in the explosin, as was his right arm. &quot;Ahhhhhhhhh.&quot; Rhinox \nwas now injured, without any wepon&#39;s. &quot;Slag, just Slag.&quot; Rhinox\nturned \nand ran to Key. He quickly grabed Key with his Left hand. He turned \naround with glee as he saw that a row of 3 autoguns have just came up \nbehind Anubis. &quot;He should be bust with that, I need to get to the CR \nchambers.&quot; Rhinox ran toward the ark with key in his left arm.\n\n\n"}}
