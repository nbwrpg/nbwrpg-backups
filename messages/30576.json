She stood there with a stunned look on her face. &quot;You, your \nall alive? By the matrix, I don&#39;t know how, but your alive!&quot;  She ran \nup and put her arms around Drillbit. &quot;I missed you. I thought you \nwere dead or something.&quot;  She kissed him without hesitation. \nThen she heard the alarms and looked at the others. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;\nShe looked at Starscream and Killfest.  &quot;Who&#39;s in charge since I \nleft?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::KitKat2::\nShe sat down at the entrance to the Allience base.  She didn&#39;t know \nwhere she was, but she could smell her own scent all around. &quot;I don&#39;t \nremember being here,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;Perhaps this was where \nDarkMouse fixed me up at.&quot;  She scratched at the door. &quot;Hey, jokes \nover, you can let me in now. Drillbit? DarkMouse? GoldenEye? \nStarscream? Killfest? OK, this isn&#39;t funny anymore.  I know you have \na holoprojector on the front door now. Come on guys, play time&#39;s \nover. Let me in.&quot; She sat back down and waited for someone to let her \nin. \n\n\n"}}
