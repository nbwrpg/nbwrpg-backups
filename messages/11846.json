He turned, firing off an explosive shell \nfrom his artillery mode at the Rodimus Prime look alike.\n\n---\n\nScavenger continued driving for the Ark, re-firing on Rodimus Prime with 25 \nshells from his machien guns, and three laser blasts from his laser cannon.\n\n---\n\nDark One made another pass, this time opening fire with 20 rapid laser blasts \ndown at Spears, laughing at how clever he was.\n\n"}}
