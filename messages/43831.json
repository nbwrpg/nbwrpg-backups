I am likely the only hope you have of \nwinning \n&gt; whatever war might be raging on this poor excuse for a plnet.\n&gt; \n&gt; He could tell the evil was comming from a few bots.

This is the first one. \n&gt; It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brings \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question of: What did they do with the second blank \n&gt; &gt; after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reviving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Optimus Primal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all this time the blank protoform still sits \nthere \n&gt; &gt; &gt; where \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals have left it.

Then from deep in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dark \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; force, the Inferno himself arises to claim the body. A \n&gt; new \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spark \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forms \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in it, Pure Black. Then the Maximal chip starts to \nwork. \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Inferno overrides it, but not totally. The spark \n&gt; turns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; blood \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; red. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A new bot arises. He is engulfed in flame. He turns \ninto \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fairly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handsome, red eyed, muscular bot, of pure evil. He can \n&gt; sense \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with black hearts on this planet.
