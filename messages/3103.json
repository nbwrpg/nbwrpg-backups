He then turned his attentions towards the stranger with an expression on his face that could only mean one thing, either it gave an explination that made sense or he would simply rip it apart! He remembered the incident in his past where Megatron had once cloned him in hope if infultrating the base and thus taking the ship from the Maximals. But obviously Megatron�s plan had been foiled when he had arrived and then found out about the clone�this ending it�s artificial life!                                                                                                                                                                        Dinobot then growled but almost one that seemed to sound more amused the threatening, he had also remembered that he didn�t have to attend dinner that night by cause of an earlier�snack.\nHe kept his arms crossed as he stood there and glared at the stranger, he knew who he was and he had the spark signature to prove it, but obviously nobot else could catch onto that fact. So it was obvious that another solution had to be thought up and quickly before his fellow Maximals began believing this fraud and then turning against him, the situation such as that something that he hoped would be avoidable.\nBut the fact still remained that this bot impersonating him was, indeed, a female and it surprised him that no bot else could tell that fact, the scent of it clearly giving her away.\nBut then a thought suddenly came to his mind as his thoughts then turned, quite suddenly, into how he had been perfectly able bodied when he had transformed into robot mode, leaving the injured beast mode to repair as he was in his second state�the thought was simply this, the result of that absent thought: if the stranger transformed into their robot mode as well it would then prove that they were not him and just an impersonator�the answer was pure and simple.\nDinobot growled as he then focused again on Cyber Claw, it was time to end this little game once and for all.*\n\n� If you are, indeed, whom you claim to be then you shall not mind proving it.�\n\nHe then looked over at Tavatron without turning his head, the look in his optics almost seeming to say, �We got them now!� but he then looked back towards Cyber Claw and took a step towards her, the posture and tensing of his muscles clearly presenting confidence in himself but also had a deadly grace to it�his tail swinging behind him but careful not to hit Tavatron. Almost coming up right beside Striker he almost seemed to ignore the Maximal�s status and authority as he kept his optics on the stranger, without looking at Striker but speaking to him he growled�*\n\n� Then there is only one clear way to end this argument that is only a severe waste of time, if this soldier is really who they claim to be then they must transform. Thus putting this dispute to rest.�\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
