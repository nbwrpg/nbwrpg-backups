I originally thought that, each\nindiv=\r\nidual in any setting having their own idea about how things\nshould be, it m=\r\nade sense that not all Maximals and not all Predacons\nwould quite get along=\r\n together. Pacificus think it&#39;s better to do the\ncience and aim for peace t=\r\nhrough that rather than policing the world\nas the Silver Wings do. It&#39;s jus=\r\nt that kind of logic and I think it\nshows more accurately the different sha=\r\ndes of gray there.

The Autobots\n&gt; have the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basic ethos of &quot;Peace is =\r\nthe right of all sentient beings&quot; while the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Decepticons are about &quot;Pe=\r\nace through tyranny!&quot; or &quot;Might makes\n&gt; right!&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However there are va=\r\nriations on each theme.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you look at the Wiki site (which I e=\r\nncourage you to do) under the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; subsection summary and setting which ki=\r\nnd of gives you a break down.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I have grafted these from the si=\r\nte. please read them there in their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entirety)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You have at=\r\n least two versions of predacon : BUSHIDO PREDACONS who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that =\r\npreserving the peace will allow them to grow strong for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the little wh=\r\nile they still have before the Minions start an all-out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; war. their le=\r\nader is Spire. And IRON SKULL PREDACONS who believe\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals are=\r\n weak and they would rather take over the lead from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals and =\r\nact right now. Their leader is Jotunn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You also have at least t=\r\nwo versions of Maximal: PACIFICUS\nMAXIMALSwho\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that peace is t=\r\nhe only way everybody can focus on the\nefforts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; against the Minions. T=\r\nheir leader is Perseus. While you also\nhave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SILVER WINGS MAXIMALS=\r\n who are convinced that the Predacons are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; preparing a revolution and =\r\nthat they want to prepare a strike\nagainst\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them. They think they shou=\r\nld take them all out before things get\n&gt; rough.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Their leader is Razor=\r\nwing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then there are THE WATCHERS who look to me to still be Ma=\r\nximals but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take in members from other factions like Predacons. This f=\r\naction is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dedicated to the monitoring of the Minions. They are crafty=\r\n and\nswift,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and they are renowned Minion-killers at times. Their skil=\r\nls also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; include diplomacy, however, as members of any factions can jo=\r\nin the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Watchers. Their leader is Elder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then there are th=\r\ne Minions of Unicron, generally called either\nMinions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or Unicronians.=\r\n Their apparent goal is to turn the Earth into a ripe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feeding ground =\r\nfor Unicron. Unicron realizing that the energon\npresent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Earth was =\r\ntoo powerful for him to absorb right away, left minions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; behind to kee=\r\np an eye on Earth until the crystals were ripe for his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taking. (Remem=\r\nber how the crystals originally interfered with\nMaximals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; & Predacons,=\r\n and they couldn&#39;t stay in robot mode?) Up until\n&gt; recently a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of=\r\n Cold War was raging between the Unicronians and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cybertronians ho=\r\nwever with the arrival of Cyclonus, Scourge and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sweeps, and the a=\r\nddition of several new warriors this cold war\n&gt; &gt; &gt; threatens to explode in=\r\nto something more. They are led by Vorpal, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful villain who&#39;s f=\r\null abilities have yet to be revealed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this helps, and I=\r\n am sure the others will give\ncorrections and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expansions as well.
