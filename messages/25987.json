He sent an arm forward in a fist, \nslamming into the armor.  With his other hand he grabbed the beaten chest \nplalte and tore downward, ripping off a piece.\n\nThrowing the piece at the shields, he sent a hand inside, barely able to fit \nand ripped around.  His optics glowed darker as his hand clasped around \nsomething.  He pulled out feriously, turning his back to the slumped over \nSmokescreen as he looked at the shape that was in his hand.  Opening his \nmech-fluid covered hand he saw a perfect black sphere in his hand.  It was \nabout the size of a human tennis ball, which was very small compared to the \nsixteen foot high Vehement.\n\n&quot;Excellent.&quot; he smiled, the sphere disappearing into his subspace pocket.  \nHis left hand took the shape of a barrel and he raised it at the hole in the \nCF, knowing the shields were still up.\n\nHe activated a comm. link on all Maximal frequencies.  He had what he came \nfor, he was eager to get on with his holy mission.  \n\n&quot;This is Vehement, leader of the faction called the Brotherhood.  If the \nshields are not lowered in five cycles my forces and I will take them down by \nforce.  When the shields are lowered and we leave, I expect not to be fired \nupon.  If I am fired upon, we will kill whoever shot at me.  Comply in the \ntime alotted.&quot;\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher could hear Vehement and smiled, turning around to point the rifle \ndown at the general group of people gathered around Future Zardus and Iron \nRaptor.\n\nReflector kept his aim on the shields, ready to open fire with everything he \ngot (which wasn&#39;t much).\n\n"}}
