This is a Beast Wars RPG, not Buffy \nor something, and it will stay a Beast Wars RPG. Soulstice and Benny \nHillo, I&#39;d appreciate it if you forgot about the mystical stuff and \nRPed robots, not gods.\n\nAlso, all the damage dodging and ignoring in this battle at the \nChivtron base is getting waay too much. Start posting damage properly \nfrom now on please. Energon does hurt all bots, unless they are in \nbeast mode, so you guys might wanna start posting for that. No bots \nare being built by God or the devil in this RPG, so lets not start \nRPing that way. Thanx.\n\n\n"}}
