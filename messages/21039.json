I&#39;ll do it.&quot;  He reaches to his chest \nto extend a \n&gt; cable.  This would have worked except that he was used to having a \nchest only \n&gt; in robot mode.  Thus the cable didn&#39;t extend.  &quot;Argh. blast it!&quot;  \nHe once \n&gt; again pulled his wings in and transformed into his robot mode, with \nthe jet \n&gt; black wings.  &quot;Finally.&quot;  He opened a plate in his chest extending \nthe \n&gt; expected cable this time.  &quot;Trinity.  Attach this cable to \nNightlight for \n&gt; me.&quot;  He tosses the end to her.\n\n\n"}}
