Her optics shined at him,\nknowing that a spider&#39;s gaze can instill different responces. This\ngaze was to instill a loyalty responce from him. Though she had no\nintentions of taking over, she still wanted a few bots she could count\non to be there for her if needed. &quot;I require rest now. I need to let\nmy power cells recharge. We can make all the changes later on.
