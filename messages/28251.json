It was kinda weird, knowing that you \nwere put on this planet from a heigher power only to study a race that they \nseeked to destroy. But he would and so would the rest of the crew.\nBy now they each had their own beast mode as well, looking his over and \nsmiling.\nThis adventure was going to be fairly exciting, and that was good thinking \nfor a person who was a hunk of stone less then 20 cycles ago.\nBut enough about this, a feeling worming up on him that it was about time \nthat they got their skid-plates in gear.\nBiomass coughed slightly to clear his lungs as he got to his feet, a little \nunsteadily since it was the first time EVER that he stood.\nAs a 10 foot transformer, Biomass wasn&#39;t something to be taken lightly.\nAnd niether was his beast mode, which made up for his size.\n\nOn the floor a slender form stired, sighing as she rose to a sit.\nFrom what she knew her name was Sublime, and she was the explorer for the \ngroup. Like a scout, not to pit too fine a point on it.\nHer aqua green eyes searched the room until they fell on Biomass, wondering \njust what his beast mode was with those tenticles haning from his shoulders, \nmaking up some kind of gray cape.\nHer own beast mode was similar but more basic, but she did live the \nclear/blue jelly-like armor that fell from her hips like a skirt, finding \nthat the same things fell from her head like blue/clear hair...only one \npiece.\n\n\nOn the other side of the room there was a sneeze, making both Biomass and \nSublime look over.\nA skinny, also slender but not as much, woman sat up, sniffing slightly.\nThis one was called Nue&#39;e.\nHer beast mode wasn&#39;t exactly easy to see, it was even harder to guess with \nthe two pinkish white seashells covering her chest, her entire armor being a \nsort of off pink.\nShe yawned slightly and looked over her shoulder at the two other \ntransformers, pushing a set of actual glasses up the bridge of her nose.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
