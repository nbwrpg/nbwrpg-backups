Speaking with such a famous bot is\nan honour. Can you send the coordinates of your base so I might better\nget there?\n\nHe transformed to dragon-jet mode. He was a transmetal bot and his\nclimatic adaptation made him only slicker. In his present mode, he\nlooked like a jet fighter covered with icicles. The nose section,\nhowever, was mounted at the end of a long metallic neck and consisted\nof a ice blue dragon head.\n\nHe started circling above the frozen mass on which he had landed and\nfought the wind to remain airborne. Soon, he would leave this place.\n\nSoon, he would start looking for Prime.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; Rodimus nods at the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: I&#39;m glad I have a top notch team hre to come up with\nthis stuff.

This means that a\n&gt; cop file of the programming from Nightlight&#39;s spark is within me, and\n&gt; I in her as well. If we were connected with a computer running file\n&gt; transfers between us, we could upload the old programming to her\n&gt; spark.
