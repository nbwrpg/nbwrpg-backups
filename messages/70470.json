He understood that this was critical,=\r\n and doesn&#39;t hesitate to follow his advice.\n\n&quot;Of course Stanton, parden my =\r\nintrusion.  I&#39;ll be in the ovbservation room. If you need to perform any en=\r\nergy transfusions I will be happy to volunteer as your donor.&quot;\n\nHe now leav=\r\nes with Talon and Perceptor.  Deep down he was furious at what Hydras had u=\r\nltimately put Rodimus through.  If it weren&#39;t for Hydras, Rodimus would hav=\r\ne never been trapped beneath those tunnels, or have become a meal for the g=\r\niant insectoids which had feasted on his own energy.  He was also furious f=\r\nor the suffering which Nightlight, Windlord and Perceptor had been put thro=\r\nugh.  He did not want those actions to go unpunished.  After all, he was a =\r\nPrime.  And as a Prime he swore to protect those under his comradeship.  He=\r\n becomes deeply intrenched in thought, hoping that no one would read his mi=\r\nnd, and find out what was eating at him, since his expression could fortell=\r\n a bit of anger, not at his comrades but at someone else.  As deep as the h=\r\natred that the Autobots had for the Decepticons vorns ago.  This was that k=\r\nind of hatred.  He thinks deeply to himself.\n\n&quot; So now that the Autobots ar=\r\ne few in numbers, you think you can just take over this universe as if you =\r\nwere an unstoppable deity.  You&#39;ve harmed far too many of those I care for.=\r\n  And what you&#39;ve done to Rodimus, Nightlight, Windlord and Perceptor, are =\r\ninexcuseable.  You have no right to the power you seek, and I will see to i=\r\nt that you never get your hands on it.  You think you are powerful just bec=\r\nause you have Megatron and Galvatron&#39;s strength within your spark?  That me=\r\nans nothing because you haven&#39;t got what truely matters, and that kind of p=\r\nower is not given, it&#39;s earned.  I will face you Hydras, I swear by the nam=\r\ne of Primus himself, I will face you.&quot;\n\nNot one word comes out of Tucson&#39;s =\r\nmouth, yet he begins to crack his knuckles audibly as he always does when l=\r\nosing his temper.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyc=\r\nlonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson now transformed into robot mode, =\r\ntakes a seat next to Rodimus&#39;s bedside, and prepares to sit it out for a lo=\r\nng time, not moving from his spot. If anything else he was there for suppor=\r\nt. He had hoped by doing so, Rodimus&#39;s condition may change gradually. Yet =\r\nhe had time to respond to Perceptor and Kup as they were leaving.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\n Do what you can to help Nightlight. I&#39;ll stay with Rodimus to be sure he r=\r\nemains stable.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In his larger body frame, it was a bit hard for him=\r\n to make himself comfortable yet, to him comfort was the last thing on his =\r\nmind. He knew he needed Rodimus not only as a comrade, but as a friend. It =\r\nwas the one thing that Hydras didn&#39;t have and a power he&#39;d never experience=\r\n. The power of friendship.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Hopefully you can hear me Rodimus. I p=\r\nromise you as an Autobot and a Prime, that I will NEVER give up fighting un=\r\nitl the day comes when the wars finally cease. After the wars, restoration =\r\nis in order. But if we&#39;re going to achieve these goals, the leaders of the =\r\nAutobots and the Maximals must come together as a whole and only then can w=\r\ne restore order on this planet. There&#39;s just one problem, you&#39;ve slipped aw=\r\nay on us, unintentionally of course, but without you we&#39;re not as powerful =\r\nas we can be. But with you we can give this planet what it desperately need=\r\ns, new hope and the promise of new life. Never give up your drive to restor=\r\ne order, for it&#39;s a drive that we all share and treasure and a drive that n=\r\no evil force can ever bring down.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Tuscon entered the ch=\r\namber where Rodimus Prime is laying he can\n&gt; also see the familliar form of=\r\n  Lagacy as he stood to the side of\n&gt; Rodimus as he looked over several of =\r\nthe sensors that were oriented on\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; prone form lying on the bed.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; However also in the room was Bump who while smaller than Legacy  but\n&gt; =\r\nhe looked no less formidable in his durably contructed crimson colored\n&gt; ar=\r\nmor and silver-grey chest plate plating. His beast mode was\n&gt; probrably som=\r\ne sort of reptile, an armadillo perhaps judging from\n&gt; hints around his for=\r\nm. He glanced up as Tuscon entered a scalpel in\n&gt; his hand as it hummed wit=\r\nh power.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also was the rather large form of Santon the Maximal Doctor. =\r\nHe stood\n&gt; as tall as the Massive Legacy, his armor was thick and heavy and=\r\n was\n&gt; colored primarilly in various shades of greys although his chest\n&gt; t=\r\nhights and biceps were red. As with many Maximals it was easy to\n&gt; determin=\r\ne his beast mode was that of an elephant from the large tusks\n&gt; that extend=\r\ned from his helm.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He sits up trying to get in a com=\r\nfortable position.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Then there&#39;s this little matter of Hydras.. Un=\r\nfortunately he reminds me of good old Megatron and Galvitron... If we&#39;re go=\r\ning to overthrow him, we have to work together. That won&#39;t be easy, but I k=\r\nnow we can do it. If anyone should be wanting to thwart him, it&#39;s you. He d=\r\nid the most injustice to you, and by right, you have presidence as to how h=\r\nis fate should ultimately wind up. Then, Cyclonus. I&#39;ll deal with him. Litt=\r\nle by little we should free this planet. And little by little we can watch =\r\nit flourish.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon looked up, it was obvious that he =\r\nwas not happy with yet\n&gt; another intrusion on what could turn out to be an =\r\nincredibly delicate\n&gt; operation. &quot;Tuscon Prime.&quot; Santon said, his voice car=\r\nrying the full\n&gt; weight of acting chief medical officer, &quot;I will have to as=\r\nk you and\n&gt; any others who wish to watch to wait in the observation room.&quot; =\r\nSanton\n&gt; pointed to the room easily visable on the other side of clear\n&gt; pl=\r\nexiglass. He looked back at Rodimus as he heard a beep from one of\n&gt; the se=\r\nnsors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy spoke up from his position, &quot;It would appear that his li=\r\nfe\n&gt; signs are begining to decline, if we are to begin, now would be the\n&gt; =\r\nbest time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bump glanced looked at the others in the area his look obv=\r\nious, leave\n&gt; so that they could begin.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;TAG&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
