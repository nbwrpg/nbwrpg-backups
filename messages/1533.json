Sorry for the inconvience.)\n\nTavatron stirred as Dinobot&#39;s hand hovered closer and closer to her cheek. When he failed to touch her Tavatron&#39;s optics opened slightly, an odd feeling of security and safety about her. As her mind drifted between the realms of sleep and consciousness she spied Dinobot laying a few feet from her. Or... \n\nTavatron groaned, she was so tired! She was seeing things again, images from a past best forgotten. With much effort she barely opened her optics again. Her mind was fuzzy, as was her vision. Her mind began to wander as she drifted back to sleep. She took one last look at Dinobot...\n\nOnly she didn&#39;t see Dinobot. Her mind drifted into the past, traveling stellercycles back to a time she had repressed. Instead of Dinobot she saw her friend, the one that had died all those stellercycles ago. \n\nTavatron smiled, she silently transformed and curled up next to what she thought was her old friend, her tail barely touching his. She felt a feeling of comfort and security envelope her, one she hadn&#39;t felt in a long time. Tavatron sighed as she whispered a final good-bye to her past, prepared to embrace the future. \n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
