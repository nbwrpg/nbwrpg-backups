And don&#39;t worry, I make lots of mistakes when I&#39;m \ntired too.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Malice snored audibly, but not loudly.  He would occasionally roll \nonto one side, but generally slept well.  A few megacycles later, his \nalarm went off, and he grundgingly crawled out of his hammock.  He \nslowly made his way to the mess hall to find a cup of energon.  He \nnoticed it was exceedingly quiet.  That was due to the fact that he \nwas oblivious to everyone else until he had at least one glass of \nrefined energon.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
