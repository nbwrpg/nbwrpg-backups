Several bots seemed to be in conflict\n&gt; over...no it couldn&#39;t be. This couldn&#39;t be earth could it and that...That\n&gt; could not be the ark of legend!\n&gt;\n&gt;     Transforming Xiane stood upon the hill a good distance from the battle\n&gt; but began to run, he wasn&#39;t sure who was good or who was in the wrong but\nif\n&gt; that was the ark it must be protected.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Tearing up the ground as he ran he drew one object then another. In\nhis\n&gt; right fist he clenched a bladeless hilt, with a flick of a button his\n&gt; energon sword flared to life, humming warmly in his fingers. The other\n&gt; object was much like a door sheild yet the main face of it was empty until\n&gt; it too was turned on, an energy sheild filling the gaps to provide\n&gt; protection.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Xiane arrived just as Spears was blasted from her spot behind the\nmetal\n&gt; plate, kneeling down he examined the bot. &quot;Hail to thee m&#39;lady, it seems I\n&gt; find myself on a battlefeild yet know not the very sides I face.

She glided in right between\n&gt; &gt; the shots. They miss her by centimeters.

He was now upside down, facing Shadow Wing.  He opened\n&gt; &gt; fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a barrage of 5 rapid laser bolts, not wanting to use up to\n&gt; &gt; much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy to take out such a simple target.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
