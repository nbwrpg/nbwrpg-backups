Sure that the Alliance was going to kill her one way or another.\nShe could have sworn that she could have fainted with relief and utter surprise, not expecting to hear Prowl�s voice but surprised beyond belief that he was nowhere to me see.\nIron Raptor looked around frantically for the source of Prowl�s voice, waiting to see him anywhere in the room.\nWhere was he?!\nWhere could he be?\nWas his voice just something that her mind heard on it�s own because it was something that she longed to hear?\nWas it some cruel joke that the Alliance was playing with her to try and get her off guard?\nWhat was going on?!!\nA million questions raced through her mind as she searched the room, her spark sinking deeply when she still couldn�t seem to find him.\nBut then she suddenly got the shock of her life when she suddenly felt something touch her arm, giving out a cry of surprise and jumping back, her back hitting the wall with a loud thud.\nSomething was going on here, something that she couldn�t see OR explain.\nIron Raptor felt her spark beat like it was pumping fluid through her body a million times a second. Her breathing hard as she had plastered herself to the wall, staring right in front of herself for a moment before recovering and slowly leaning away from the wall.\nWhile recovering she then remembered feeling something very similar to the touch she had just felt, some sort of comforting feeling that she knew well.
