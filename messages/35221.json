His eyes are blue, and he wears a small\n&gt; mask over his mouth. Most of the time he hunches over, and honks\n&gt; a little red horn at people. He has a small yellow flower about two\n&gt; inches squared on the left side of his chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bob has several weapons. He has a automatic pie launcher,\n&gt; capable of making an interesting slat in the face of any\n&gt; unsuspecting person. His small chest flower squirts acid up to 5\n&gt; meters. Bob frequently uses his fists to do mock battle with other\n&gt; clowns.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bob is a very outgoing bot. He likes to bug and tease other bots\n&gt; that he knows, and doesn&#39;t know. This trait has often gotten him\n&gt; into trouble, and once it got him beat up. He was in the CR for\n&gt; three days.\n&gt;\n&gt; The above was an example, and a quick one at that. =P\n&gt; That or less (without the personality section) would do nicely on\n&gt; the page. PLEASE make your short character bio&#39;s as soon as\n&gt; possible.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 19 May 2001, at 22:12, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Okay, I think I can go over and submit some stuff, but I won&#39;t be\n&gt; &gt; able to get the bios done anytime soon, sadly...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
