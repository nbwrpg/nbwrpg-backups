(Talking about my hands)\n\n::::\n\nThe drunk opens his mouth to reply to Repungus when the sword in his hand starts talking to him. His eyes widen slightly, his mind making a mental note to quit drinking, but he doesn&#39;t lose his grip on the sword.\n\n&quot;Err, did that sword just talk to me?&quot; he asks Repungus in a voice clearly belonging to a fighter, his missile launcher firing another missile at the rubble. He holds the sword and shield steady though, keeping his scanners locked on Branded.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- Pacifix / Crossroads / Swoop ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix keeps trying to remove the metallic rubble that recently fell \n&gt; on him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Crossroads fits perfectly into new bot&#39;s hands. &quot;Hello, I&#39;m \n&gt; Crossroads. The weapon and shield are a plasma sword and \n&gt; shield. They are both light and you should have no problem using \n&gt; them to defeat enemies. The plasma blade will become surrounded \n&gt; in miniature bluish flames when you begin to use it. When \n&gt; damaging enemies, it causes blade damage plus the bluish flames \n&gt; will stick to the damaged area, and cause excruciating pain, \n&gt; without inflicting more damage. The shield has a moderate ability \n&gt; to absorbe heat. Use them wisely, for your sake and mine.&quot; He \n&gt; chuckles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swoop dodges weapon fire and the collapsing ceiling, then leaps \n&gt; into flight. He circles wildly around the small room, looking for a \n&gt; new target, but not wanting to hurt any friends.\n\n\n"}}
