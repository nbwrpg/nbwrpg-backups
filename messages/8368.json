He called to the bot who was helping them.\n\n&quot;Did you hear that? We have to go! Maximals are in trouble!&quot;\n\nOctociz/Brix stromed out of the ship and galloped towards where the \ntransmission occured at high speed. Out of the corner of their eye, \nthey thought they saw two bots: One who looked like a giant bat, and \nanother which looked something like a wolf, but not quite. It didn&#39;t \nmatter thought. They had to get to the battle field and fast! They \njust hoped that Maximal had held on!\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nVulois was putting on finishing touches on the embassy. He still had \nno clue how to contact the smaller groupes, and with all this \nbusiness about kidnapping, he didn&#39;t know the chances of having \nsuccess with the big groupes. He just hoped that his friends had not \ngotten into trouble. He then started to cry and smile at the same \ntime, realizing that they were not his assistants, but his friends. \nAnd they were going to do this, one way or another. He hoped that \nthis place would be a sanctuary for all those bots terrified of their \ngroupes; that wanted peace. Because this place was going to give them \nall what he had promised Battera when he was stuck in that Predacon \nrafter, and she was hunting him: They were going to get as many bots \nas they could, and than go home.\n\nVulois returned to his work.\n\n\n"}}
