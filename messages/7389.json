It was nearly \npitch black at the end of it. He activated his infra red vision to make it \neasier to see. The farther it walked down, the more confusing it got. It \nlooked like it went at a dead end.\n\nHe stopped and tilted his head, musing at what was behind his optics. Below \nhim, he heard the slight trickle of water. He looked down and saw at least \nan inch of water touching his feet, enough to make the ridges on the bottom \nof his feet disappear. He thought there must be a water source within the \ncave.\n\nJust as he was about to step ahead, he went down. It felt like the ground \nhad collapsed--with the splash. The puddle of water that filled the hold \narea turned into a pool. Quickstrike twisted and turned, trying to find what \nway was up.\n\nHe righted himself and tried his luck. His head surfaced, coughing from \nsurprise. After he got a breath, he felt something pull at him. There was a \ntug, then a violent yank. He was again pulled underwater. But this time he \ncouldn&#39;t fight to get back up to the surface. Something had his leg, pulling \nhim.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
