At first examination they see its\n&gt; smack in the middle of the jungle, and then see a small round door in the\n&gt; ground.\n&gt;     &quot;What in the world is this? Paralysis, go in and look around.&quot; Aracnia\n&gt; said as she looked at the mysterious symbol on the door.\n&gt;     Paralysis did as he was told, undid the loid, and climed down a dark\n&gt; ladder. He reached the bottom to find a long corridor with doors on both\n&gt; sides. At the end of the hall way was a triangle shaped room. Scattered\nabout\n&gt; where skeletons of someking of aliens with four arms.\n&gt;     He entered the triangle room and realized that this must have been\n&gt; somekind of early alien settlement and observation station. It was big\nenough\n&gt; to serve there needs, and was deep underground.\n&gt;     He climbed back up and reported to Aracnia.\n&gt;\n&gt;     &quot;Interesting. Alright, everyone, were moving in! Tarantulas and\nParalysis\n&gt; will begin construction on autoguns and a sheild generator. The rest of\nyou\n&gt; keep watch. When Quickstrike gets here we will begin a further exploration\nof\n&gt; the bunker.&quot; She commanded.\n&gt;     With that the groups broke off and began there projects. The Maximal\n&gt; prisoners  were tied to a thick tree with energon bands. Soon they would\nbe\n&gt; moved in and the Predacon Bunker would be operational.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
