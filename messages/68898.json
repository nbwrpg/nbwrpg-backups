As \nthe disintegration beams from the sweeps reach the last few mete=\r\nrs to \nthe ark they impact and are rebuffed by some sort of powerful force =\r\n\nshield, leaving the ark unscathed. \n\n&quot;DESTROY THE LEADERSHIP AND THE SWEEP=\r\nS WILL FALL&quot; A familiar voice \nsounds across Lord Elder&#39;s radio. \n\n&quot;I HAVE =\r\nTAPPED ARK ENERGY STORES, AND HAVE SUFFICIENT ENERGY RESERVES \nNOW TO MAINT=\r\nAIN THIS SHIELDING FOR A SHORT PERIOD.&quot; \n\nCannon fire from Legacy brightene=\r\nd the skies for a moment as it \npasses through his own shielding and destro=\r\nyed a sweep craft that \nventured too close. &quot;IF THE ARK IS DAMAGED BEYOND A=\r\n CERTAIN POINT WE \nMAY LOOSE EVERYTHING EVEN IF WE RETAIN THE MATRIX.&quot;\n\nAs =\r\nScorponok stood to his full height sweeps seemed to swarm on him \nfrom seve=\r\nral different directions, several of them cut down almost \nimmediately by h=\r\nis machine gun batteries. With a swipe of his mighty \npincer Scorponok is a=\r\nbly to capture a sweep, his claw biting deeply \ninto its armor. \n\nAs Scorpo=\r\nnok looked around he can clearly see 9 more sweeps around \nhim, several of =\r\nthem orienting on him and fire a deadly barrage of \nlaser fire at him!\n\n&gt; J=\r\nhiaxus pulls up high and tries to drop more cluster bombs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jhiaxus: So =\r\nmany of them! How do we dog such an enemy?!\n\nMyrmidon chuckled darkly, &quot;Whe=\r\nn a predator takes on a prey more \nnumerous and nearly as powerful as he, t=\r\nhen he must choose his victim \ncarefully.&quot;\n\nMyrmidon, still in star-fighter=\r\n mode shifted angles and launched \nrockets at the sweeps, adding to the clu=\r\nster bombs Jhiaxus already \nhad in the air. Several sweeps exploded as othe=\r\nrs veered off. \n\n&quot;It may be wise for all of us to co-ordinate our attacks. =\r\nWith two of \nus here and others in other places, these minions can separate=\r\n us and \npick us off at their leisure.&quot;\n\nEven as he spoke, several sweeps f=\r\nired strafing shots at the two \naerial Decepticons!\n\nAs Hydras, Perceptor a=\r\nnd Darkhawk opened fire against the sweeps the \nreactions was swift and dir=\r\nect! 15 sweeps separated themselves from \nthe host and moved at Hydras and =\r\nhis crew as fusion grenades flew \nthrough the air at them!\n\n&gt; Hydras shoute=\r\nd by com link &quot;PREDACONS AND DECEPTICONS! !! PROTECT \nTHE \n&gt; ARK!!!&quot;\n\n&quot;WILL=\r\n YOU SHUT UP!!!!!!&quot; came an unfamiliar female voice boomed \nloudly over Hyd=\r\nras&#39; channel! (OOC: Decibel) &quot;You could have been one \nof us, but now you w=\r\nill be cannon fodder! *DIE!!*&quot;\n\nTwin sonic missiles streak towards Hydras&#39; =\r\nshuttle, even as a high \npitched scream can be heard over the radio, effect=\r\nively squelching \ncommunications. \n\n((OOC: Anyone communicating into or out=\r\n from the area near Hydras, \nPerceptor and Darkhawk (might cover Scorpi, My=\r\nrmidon and Jhiaxus as \nwell =96 not sure how close together they are) will =\r\nonly hear a high \npitched shriek))\n\nCyclonus frowned inwardly as he saw his=\r\n attack thwarted by Rodimus. \nWith a quick boost of power Cyclonus banked a=\r\nround in an attempt to \nline up another shot. Using his superior speed over=\r\n Rodimus he \nmaneuvered to dodge the weapons fire, but clearly underestimat=\r\ned his \nfoe! The first shot missed - as it was designed to do, the bright \n=\r\nlights distracting and partially blinding him! The blindness allows \nthe se=\r\ncond one to hit him in the under plating knocking him to the \nside as he be=\r\ngan to fall from the air. \n\nIn a desperate maneuver Cyclonus shifted to his=\r\n robot form as he \ncrashed on the ground, his legs barely getting beneath h=\r\nim before he \nhits absorbing the impact. \n\nA lesser robot would have taken =\r\nsevere damage, and as it is Cyclonus&#39; \narmor is dented from his unexpected =\r\nlanding, but Cyclonus quickly \nstands his face cool and calm as he observed=\r\n his opponent. \n\n&quot;It would seem your recent um modifications have not dulle=\r\nd your \nedge.&quot; Cyclonus&#39; voice echoed across to Rodimus, &quot;Good!&quot; \n\nWith a q=\r\nuick movement Cyclonus fired twined laser cannons at Rodimus \nas he smiled;=\r\n it was good to have a worthy opponent!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
