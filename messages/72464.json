I just made a block buster chicken soup from\n&gt; scratch to bring to my friend&#39;s mom who was also  not feeling well.  And if\n&gt; you have someone to make it for you, here&#39;s what you do.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ingredients:  One whole chicken, three to four onions, a handful of parsley,\n&gt; five of six carrots, several stalks of celery, and a pinch of salt,\n&gt; according to your taste.\n&gt;\n&gt; Put the whole chicken in a large soup pot, and pour just enough water over\n&gt; the chicken to cover it.  Then add onions, carrots, celery and then season\n&gt; with salt according to your own taste.  Start the soup on high until it\n&gt; begins to boil, then lower to a slow to steady simmer for two to three hours\n&gt; or until the legs of the chicken are loose.  * Just lift the chicken out of\n&gt; the pot with a pair of tongs and jiggle the legs* .  Once the legs are\n&gt; loose, you&#39;re ready to take the meat and veggies out of the soup.  First\n&gt; discard the parsley, which is only there for flavor, then in a sparate\n&gt; mixing bowl, you add the veggies and on a platter you put the chicken.\n&gt; Allow meat and veggies to cool and then start by cutting the veggies into\n&gt; bite sized pieces and put them back into the broth of the soup.  Then you\n&gt; take the chicken off the bones, discard skin, fat and bones, and shred the\n&gt; meat into bite sized pieces and put that back into the soup.  Once this is\n&gt; done, turn off the heat and allow the soup to cool. Once it cools down the\n&gt; fat will rise to the top and it will solidify.  When you&#39;re ready to eat it,\n&gt; just skim the top of the soup and remove the fat.  Heat to desired\n&gt; temperature slowly and boil up your favorite pasta and most importantly,\n&gt; ENJOY.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is our family recipe that comes straight from Florence, Italy.  Trust\n&gt; me, you&#39;ll love it.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;adamsafran&quot; &lt;adamsafran@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OOC - Sorry for the lack of posting, running a fever and so I fear I won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; be super active until it passes.
