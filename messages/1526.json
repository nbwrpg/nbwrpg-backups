It looked like a dot to\nthe\n&gt; naked eye, but it was actually a stasis pod, containing a protoform and a\n&gt; spark.  The pod made a rough landing about ten miles from the lava zone.\n&gt; The scanner activated and began scanning for compatable life forms.\n&gt;\n&gt; It didn&#39;t find any.  The scanner tried again and again but it didn&#39;t find\n&gt; anything, not even a skeleton.  So, it resulted to an alternate method:\n&gt; Going into its memory banks, it searched for records of animals relating\nto\n&gt; the planet that the scanner thought it was on.  It finally found one and\n&gt; integrated it into the protoform.\n&gt;\n&gt; The pod door opened and a figure stepped out.  Then the figure sunk to his\n&gt; knees because the energon was getting to him.  He quickly transformed into\n&gt; beast mode and went off to search for where he was.\n&gt;\n&gt; He finally came upon a lake.  He looked at his reflection in the water.\nHe\n&gt; was a white horse with a yellow horn on top.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What am I?&quot;  He asked noone in particular.\n&gt; ______________________________________________\n&gt; FREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\n&gt; Sign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; 72% off on Name brand Watches!\n&gt; Come and buy today and get free shipping!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4011/10/_/_/_/958368034/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
