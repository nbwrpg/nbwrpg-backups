His optics\nflickered, but he obviously was not fully conscious or aware.\n\nSTAMPY continued to lay still, his vitals at a low ebb.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson narrows his brow with a coy smirk, and transforms back into his\n&gt; beast mode.   Yet he remains on two hind legs.  His body perfectly\n&gt; balanced and his stance nimble as that of a master ninja.  His long tail\n&gt; remains coiled neatly behind him, never getting in his way of his feet.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Rodimus, what am I going to do with you?  Well then, if you think you\n&gt; can beat me then why haven&#39;t you made your move?  Oh that&#39;s right, your\n&gt; puppet master won&#39;t let you.  If you think you&#39;re all that, come on, try\n&gt; me, I&#39;m wide open.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs soon as the shield dropped the SHARKTICONS began to open fire -\nlaser rifles spewing out energy in all directions!\n\nThe FUZORS on both sides were the first ones to come under their fire,\ntheir cutting blasts causing them to have to veer off!\n\nThen the other Dinosaur soldiers that MAGMATRON was deploying began to\nwade into the battle, their laser cannons also sweeping across the\nPREDACONS and MAXIMALS!\n\nMAGMATRON stepped foward, &quot;If you are so eager to fight someone, fight\nME!&quot; He said. With the infusion of power he had received, he had\ngrown, his optics dark yet somehow still crimson. Standing at about 20\nfeet tall he dwarfed everyone in the room!\n\nLEO PRIME and BIG CONVOY also were running up beside TUSCON.\n\n&quot;Our first priority is saving Optimus and destroying this place!&quot; LEO\nPRIME said.\n\nBIG CONVOY grunted, &quot;And then we can avenge our men!&quot; He also saw\nSHARPEDGE and STAMPY on the ground along with NIGHTLIGHT.\n\nWith a casual movement MAGMATRON pointed at TUSCON and then opened his\nhand, sending a large sweeping stream of plasma at the all three -\nTUSCON, LEO and CONVOY!\n\nMeanwhile CRYOTEK ignored the battle at large and flew at SABERBACK\nand OPTIMUS PRIME, the later of whom still hung suspended over the\nlarge pit, his armor as black as pitch, seemingly burned by that black\nfire.\n\nSABERBACK was standing on a bridge that spanned the pit looking up at\nOPTIMUS as CRYOTEK flew over!\n\nCRYOTEK had some sort of dagger in his hand, it looked to made of crystal!\n\nOOC: As a note - Optimus has been shrunk like everyone else, he is\nroughly 15&#39;+ tall or so\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
