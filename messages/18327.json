Wondering just what those fools were \ntrying to do, attacking a force such as the Alliance and actually hoping \nthey&#39;de win?\nHowever, although she would love to join in on the fun, she knew that she \nwas far to weak to be any use to her master and his crew. However, as she \nscanned the field outdoors she made notes on whom her prey would be, but \neven as she looked her stomach rumbled.\nDesmonus sighed and turned her senses away from the battle, knowing that it \nwould only tempt her to join in in order to feed...and ruin her cover.\nShe couldn&#39;t let the others know, know that her only food source was \nmech-fluid. If they found out they could kill her, or never go near her and \nnever give her the chance to actually feed upon something.\nSo, it would remain her little secret.\nDesmonus hissed quietly as she turned from the scene and glided effertlessly \ninto the shadows, waiting for the battle to cease...and her feast to begin.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
