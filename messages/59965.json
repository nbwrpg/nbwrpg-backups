With steely determination, he forced\nhis focus into a tight path, carreening his way down,\nback past previous leaders who blurred past him like\ntrees travelled past on a Terran highway.   Finally he\nfound what he was looking for, Primus himself, or at\nleast part of him.\n\n&quot;Welcome my child, it seems the connection to the\nMatrix I left within you worked perfectly. We haven&#39;t\nmuch time left- the future hinges upon you. I know\nyour fears, and what you are thinking, and the answers\nto both are yes. I will open up a spark channel\nbetween you and I. Remember that even though you are\nmy eyes, my ears, my voice and my hand, I am always\nwatching over you.  I give you the choice of warrios,\nboth Autobot and Decepticon to recruit, in their\noriginal forms to combat the oncoming menace. Any who\nwish to remain with you after the conflict here on\nthis ancient Terra must be reformatted. Now just name\nthe warriors you wish to recruit and they will be\nyours.&quot;\n\nOOC: To be continued in Sparks of Destiny\n\nhttp://greetings.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
