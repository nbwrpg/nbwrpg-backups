He opened up a comm. link with Wolfgang.  &quot;This is Dark One, head of \nthe Oblitercon gestalt team.  I and my team will meet you.&quot;\n\nThe five robots headed for Wolfgang&#39;s position.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer paced back and forth in his quarters, troubled by the \ntransmission.  He looked to Scatterblaster.  &quot;Scattershot--&quot;\n\n&quot;Scatterblaster!  How many times do -- what is it?  No, I won&#39;t tell him!  \nJust shut up!&quot;\n\n&quot;Are...you talking to me?&quot;\n\n&quot;Uhhh...&quot; Scatterblaster looked around and tapped his head.  &quot;Possibly.&quot;\n\n&quot;O...kay.  Anyway, ScatterBLASTER, it seems Wolfgang is back.  That means he \nsomehow broke out of his cage and mutinied.  Computer, where is Zardus?&quot;\n\n&quot;ZARDUS IS NOT ONBOARD THE SHIP.&quot;\n\n&quot;Is he dead?&quot;\n\n&quot;NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where the slag is he, Nemesis?  And who&#39;s Wolfgang?&quot;\n\n&quot;He was here before your time.&quot;\n\n&quot;Obviously!&quot; Scatterblaster yelled, jumping up and slamming a foot down.  &quot;If \nhe weren&#39;t before my time I wouldn&#39;t have asked!&quot;\n\n&quot;Alright!&quot; Nemesis yelled, shoving Scatterblaster.  But Scatterblaster sent a \npunch and it knocked Nemesis halfway across his own quarters.  &quot;When the slag \ndid you get a punch like that?&quot;\n\n&quot;No idea.  So who&#39;s Wolfgang!&quot;\n\nThe former co-commander of the Alliance, a voice said in Scatterblaster&#39;s \nhead.  &quot;I said shut up!&quot; he yelled in reply.\n\n&quot;Do you want me to tell you or what?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes!&quot;\n\n&quot;He was co-commander of the Alliance.  When Zardus went out to do something I \nwas left in charge and Wolfgang used that time to try and mutiny, but I was \nable to hold him off until Zardus&#39; return and he was imprisoned.  But now \nZardus is gone again and he&#39;s trying to make himself ruler of an even great \nAlliance!  He must be stopped!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeeeeessss...First we should find out who&#39;s with him.  Computer, scan the \narea of Wolfgang&#39;s current location.  Who, except him, is with him?&quot;\n\n&quot;UNITS DARK ONE, BREAKDOWN, PYRO, HISS, AND SCAVENGER.&quot; (Computer hasn&#39;t been \nupdated :)\n\n&quot;The Oblitercons!  I never trusted those mercenary gestalts!&quot; Nemesis yelled. \n &quot;Computer, long range scan, report any detection of Zardus.&quot;\n\n&quot;ENERGY SIGNATURE OF ZARDUS DETECTED AT LOCATIONS APHLA-CENTAURI 24, 24&quot;\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;\n\n&quot;But what if Wolfgang has control of the island? Then we might be destroyed \nlike swiss cheese in a blender!&quot;\n\n&quot;I know!  It&#39;s a catastrophic event.  We should go to the signature and \nrescue Zardus.&quot;\n\n&quot;For the glory of the Alliance!&quot;\n\nThe Alliance will die.\n\n&quot;No it won&#39;t!&quot; Scatterblaster screamed.\n\n&quot;Voices again?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, mine stopped.  It&#39;s been real boring every since.&quot; Nemesis said as he \nlead Scatterblaster out of his quarters and headed for the nearest exit.  &quot;I \nreally miss them.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
