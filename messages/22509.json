I&#39;m going back to the Maximals. But I promis you I will be\nback for you. I&#39;m not going to give up on you.\nI am leaving you one of my medals. Something for you to remember, or\nhelp to remember me by. I&#39;ll be back. I love you.\n\n                                Omae Wa Korosu- I love you\n                                           -Hot Rod\n\nHe took the letter to her room. He pulled out what looked like &#39;wings&#39;\nmedals that Navy pilots get. In the center was the Autobot symbol, with\nthe wings going to either side. He wrapped it in the letter, and sliped\nit under her door.\n\nHe quickly made his way out of the base, transformed, and headed towards\nthe CF.\n\n"}}
