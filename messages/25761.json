Her eyes flickered towards Carnage, and she tilted her \nhead to one side, wondering why she would ask such a thing. \nNevertheless, she answered anyway.\n\n&quot;I guess up until I joined the Army and was sent on different \nmissions, I was being pulled in two different directions. One was my \nMother, who wanted me to become a noble person at heart, and teach me \npeace and never to harm another person, even if they were attacking \nyou&quot;\n\nThe Fuzor shook her head in disbelief of her Mother. &quot;She said that a \nviolent life is stained, even if it is long. She said.. well she said \na lot of things. About peace, and how if you harmed another, even \nyour attacker, you were dulled somehow. Like if a tree chops wood, it \ncommits &#39;violence&#39;, but the edge of the ax gets dulled&quot; She shrugged.\n\n&quot;And my Father said that I should become a fighter, to serve \nCybertron with my last breath. As a kid, I didn&#39;t really wanna die \nfor anything&quot; Teltoli snorted, sounding a bit like a chuckle. &quot;And \nthey both started to train me, I guess. One day I was being taught \nproper manners, the other I had to forget all those manners and fight \nwith a sword I could hardly pick up&quot;\n\nShe walked in silence for a few seconds, sighing quietly. &quot;And then, \nwhen I turned into a teenager, I was to be engaged to this guy that I \ndidn&#39;t even know. He was a proper Noble, but way too posh for my \nliking. He was all like &#39;Oh Teltoli, we were meant to be together!&#39; \nand all of this. Very uncomfortable..&quot; Teltoli rolled her eyes.\n\n&quot;But once I joined the Army, that got rid of him *and* the manners my \nMother taught me.. and here I am&quot; She finished the last bit by \nspreading her arms wide, and smiling slightly.\n\n&quot;How did you end up on this planet anyway.. I don&#39;t think you ever \ntold me?&quot;\n\nThe Fuzor plucked a long leaf and its stalk from a plant, and began \nknocking other leaves aside with it. &#39;Just like a kid..&#39; Her mind \nmocked and she scowled, suddenly throwing the leaf away.\n\n\n"}}
