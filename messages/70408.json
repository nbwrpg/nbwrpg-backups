He quickly called up a few displays as\n&gt; the valley mine appeared on the screen. It was the city as shown from\n&gt; a distance, obviously some sort of long range snap shot of it. The\n&gt; pitucture showed the drab colored buildings, the haze of pollution\n&gt; that seemed to settle over the city like some sort of sickening brown\n&gt; and black fog.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I am not picking up readings of anyone in the same room with it.&quot;\n&gt; Fractyl said distractedly as he continued to look, &quot;but since more\n&gt; than a few of them posses the same signature masking technology as we\n&gt; do, they could be just hiding their signatures from us.&quot; Fractyl\n&gt; shrugged as he continued, &quot;The signature is coming from some sort of\n&gt; warehouse, so I would think that there would be some sort of defenses\n&gt; online as the valley mine is not the safest place to be.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Iguanus nodded, &quot;Yep. That&#39;s what I&#39;d do, mask your signature, cover\n&gt; the place so you can&#39;t tell who&#39;s who or even where.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Inferno stood next to Hydras as he also looked at the readouts, &quot;If\n&gt; that spark is what you want lord sire&quot; Inferno said, &quot;Then with you at\n&gt; the lead NOTHING can stand in our way!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Fractyl just glanced back at Hydras, waiting for his next command.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
