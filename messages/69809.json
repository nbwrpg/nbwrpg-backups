He would get depressed when he\nf=\r\nailed. Even if he won the battle, he would sometimes find things that\nhe mi=\r\nssed.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes Tuscon&quot; the whispered voice continued. &quot;Do not tie your sense =\r\nof\nself to your successes, but to your efforts to achieve that success.\nWho=\r\n you are defines your value, not what you have you have achieved.&quot;\n\nAnother=\r\n whispered voice, also presumably from the Matrix inside\nOptimus, &quot;Tell me =\r\nsomething Tuscon, we are not biological creatures\nbut technological, yet yo=\r\nu are blind, why have you chosen to remain\nso? could it be because you choo=\r\nse to remember the pain of loss or\nfailure?&quot;\n\nAnother voice whispered to Tu=\r\nscon, this one sounding a little like\nOptimus himself, &quot;Do not make the mis=\r\ntake that Rodimus has made. He\nlost the energy matrix and himself in that l=\r\noss. He will need your\nhelp to remember his own value. Only then can the po=\r\nwer of the matrix\nhelp him.
