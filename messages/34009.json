The char\nregulations apply on the 12th (so you guys have 6 days to kill off any\nadditional chars you have). The other rules come in effect NOW.\nEveryone, go read the rules! We&#39;ll be hunting down and punishing\nviolators like crazy, so be sure to follow them :-)\n\nAll you peeps who were complainin&#39; about the char limit, we made a\nslight exception for you, though it&#39;s hard work. Anyways, check it\nout, read carefully, and obey.\n\n\nPS. Anyone who is not planning to have more than 16 chars, this battle\nis a good opportunity to get a few of them killed.\n\n\n"}}
