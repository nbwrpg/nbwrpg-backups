Scrap&#39;s advanced repair \nsystem was working on the missile damage that Vicir and Slasys had \nsustained.\n\nBoth jet&#39;s turrets turned around, firing shots at the missiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        The shields weaked only for a moment, but quickly re-gained \n&gt; stabibility and went back to 100% strength. The EMP canon targeted \n&gt; Destructer, Galvatron, and the others sending 15 seeking blasts \nafter them.\n&gt;        Tarantulas watched them as the Autoguns shot at the jets \nover head. He \n&gt; turned to Klash who activated two side missles turrets. mounted \nbehinde the \n&gt; shields, and ordred 5 missles to each enemy. The missles locked \nonto the \n&gt; spicific spraks and ran thier course of destruction.\n\n\n"}}
