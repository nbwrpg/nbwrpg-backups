Not where the main battle had been of the boarding\n&gt; action so long ago, but over within one of the secondary barracks units.\n&gt;\n&gt; As Rodimus came in, he would see Wheelie staring up silently over at a small\n&gt; plaque, upon which showed Cybertron, and in the Autobot language of the\n&gt; era...  &lt;Remembrance&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Rodimus came on in, Wheelie quietly said, &quot;I guess we know what we have\n&gt; to do.  We fight for them, and for you.  We fight for what will come to be,\n&gt; but for the past we cannot see.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing oer at the bridge, where the bodies of those who would fight...\n&gt; And those who would die, when things came to pass, &quot;Is there any way to let\n&gt; them know?  When thier time will come to go?  The future is at stake..  But\n&gt; have we not yet changed enough to remake?  To let them know when their time\n&gt; is due..  So they can make amends for you?  To perhaps change what will\n&gt; come..  Have we not already done so much to overcome?  To those who will\n&gt; never get a cahnce to say goodbye..  Do we not owe it to them to give a try?\n&gt;  But things have already been done enough.  We can&#39;t throw it off the cuff.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nA look of saddness passes through RODIMUS&#39; optics as he watches\nWHEELIE and then the other larger Autobots and Decepticons who lay\nstrewn all about. He looked very small as compared to his much larger\nbrethren who lay &#39;dead&#39; on the floor, since he, like everyone else\nhere was nearly the size of a human in his robot mode.\n\n&quot;I wish we could give them some note, some piece of knowledge that\nwould help them make choices and perhaps even make a difference.&quot;\n\nRODIMUS came and stood next to WHEELIE. &quot;I can&#39;t pretend to know all\nthe ins and outs of all the temporal stuff.&quot; he said, his voice one of\na soldier rather than a technician or theoritician.\n\n&quot;If you want all the answers as to what and why, Legacy would\nprobrably have all the answers.&quot; RODIMUS said thoughtfully as he gazed\nabout again. &quot;But I do believe that that mech came from a future where\nthings were changed and the destruction that followed. He was their\nlast ditch effort to fix it.&quot;\n\nRODIMUS shook his head as he looked back at WHEELIE, &quot;I don&#39;t want to\nface a future like that.&quot; He clapped WHEELIE on the shoulder in a\nfriendly gesture, &quot;But if you could, what kind of message would you\nsend them?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
