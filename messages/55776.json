The Maximals and Predacons were arguing yet\nagain when the Tripreds arrived. They had been lurking in the ranks of\nthe Preds and had waited the right moment to strike. Even with both\nthe Maximal and Predacon armies, we were not able to resist them long.\nWe were cornered in Katatronia City. We decided to retreat so that we\ncould better resist them. We embarked on a ship, Maximals and\nPredacons, and departed for Earth. There, we established the Survivor\nCouncil.\n\nHe paused, letting the implications sink in.\n\nAzureBlade: However, just a few weeks ago, we learned of Prime&#39;s\nreconstruction and of the the Tripredacus plan. The Council sent me\nafter him because of my neutrality. I am as much a Predacon as I am a\nMaximal. My role here is to contain or destroy Prime. He has become a\nthreat no one can afford to ignore, not even the Tripreds. We have to\nthwart his plans.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; Kup leads AzureBlade into his office.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: Have a seat.
