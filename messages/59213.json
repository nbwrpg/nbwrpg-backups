After\n&gt;being on a fringe world out post the entire Great War, he was able to\n&gt;travel and stay on Cybertron.  He was there for the Great Upgrade,\n&gt;when he met a femme named Organics.  Both were working at the same\n&gt;prison, both wardens, so they developed a bond that went beyond\n&gt;professional.  For reasons unknown, Organics disappeared suddenly,\n&gt;leaving Neutronics in agony.  He then became restless and became a\n&gt;bounty hunter, upgrading his power effecentcy close to Devcon, the\n&gt;great Autobot bounty hunter.  After years spent in such life he\n&gt;changed his name and alt. form for something more suitable.  Malice\n&gt;spends time now hunting a bounty, working on his swords or rifle.  Or\n&gt;practicing his hunting skills, becoming a ruthless hunter.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Messenger : discutez en direct avec vos amis !  \nhttp://messenger.fr.msn.ca/\n\n\n"}}
