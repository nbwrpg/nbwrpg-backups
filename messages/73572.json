I find that rather strange that you know me, =\r\nseeing that the old dragon had no mention of another, yet alone another who=\r\n can converse in my language.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He ge=\r\nts up, and stands rather stiffly. He&#39;s swift to shift his weight around, an=\r\nd put himself in front of the mouth of the cave.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m sorry, but my child is about to be born and I wish no ha=\r\nrm to come to it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Super Cyclonu=\r\ns &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; As TUCSON waited for his child to be born a winged shape appeared in&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the air flying nearly soundlessly.
