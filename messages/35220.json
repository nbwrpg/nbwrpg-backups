Though, it should have been.  And now, with the Deceptacon&#39;s leaders retreat, the battle had eased into a solemn stop. Leaving Maximal soldiers to repair much like himself.    Dinobot was slower then the rest to approach the limitations of the new Maximal city; his own damages the cause.  A simple loss on mech-fluid made him lightheaded and if his movement was too sudden a painful thudding developed behind his left optic laser. Not all that comfortable, yet nothing that was impossible to handle. He stopped all approaches to the city just outside of it, however, not to look over and marvel at it&#39;s size. Energy levels were depleted, repair was still required.  Liquids would need to be consumed to regain the level in mech-fluid, and solid food would help regain his strength. Yet, one thing at a time. Repair first.\r\nThe shielded plate which protected his spark slid back to let escape the greenish glow of his valued spark, and the coils that held repairing abilities soon began to work on the hole that was ripped into his stomach.  However, to remain outside while repairing would be foolish, so as an extra-added field of security he converted into beast mode while his spark repaired his battle mode. Without that mode in perfect condition, the use of battle would be lost. And with a quicker pace he entered the city.\r\nNow, with repair under way, there were the other two needs of his body to tend to. Food and drink.**\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
