He decided to listen in on them\nvia his com-link. After opening his com-link he and\nShadow Cat heard Dark Mouses Request for help, but\ndidn&#39;t hear a reply. Shadow Cat looked at Snow Tech.*\n\n &quot; We should help if no one else will, I mean, we\ncan&#39;t just let an injured bot lie there!&quot;\n\n * Snow Tech nodded,*\n\n &quot; Yeah, the service around here is crappy, so we\nmight as well do something to pass the time while\nInny, Er, has her fun.&quot;\n\n * And so, with that agreement, they headed for the\nsignal, which was dangerously close to the Predacon\nbase.*\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
