You&#39;d \nprobably need a blank protoform or a stolen one. Somehow I bet the \ntwo halves of the &quot;parental unit&#39;s&quot; genes would make the spark. There \nmight be more than one way to make a transformer.)\n\n\nQuickstrike:\n\n\n\n\nQuickstrike glared at Black Arachnia, his optics wide and still to a \nspeechless stare. He locked his crimson optics onto hers. She sounded \npretty serious. \n\nHe slowly snapped out of his stunned stare and blinked. Deep down, he \nwas spooked. But the fact of her pregnant may have saved her life. \n\nHe lightly nodded to her and put his cobra hand over her back. He \nlooked at Hell Beast&#39;s direction.\n\n&quot;What are we gonna do wit&#39; him?&quot; He frowned. &quot;Ah wanna kill &#39;im.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
