Okay, here goes.\nOkay, I got it.  Okay, get ready.  Okay, I say okay a lot.  Okay?  Okay!\nOkay, here goes.  Okay, I said thay already, so I&#39;ll just say it all now.\nDamn, I&#39;m serious, I cant stop saying okay!  DAMN!  *slaps self silly for 45\nminutes straight!*  Whew, oka--THERE I GO AGAIN!   *holds breath for 20\nminutes.....nearly dies*  No more okays!  Okay?  Doh!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   See, Skulletron had a special mental ability, he had the ability to\nconnect his mind with others&#39; minds, and see what they are thinking, without\nthem knowing.  They wouldn&#39;t know that he connected with their minds unless\nhe told them, or they figured out some other way like that.  And, here&#39;s the\npart that his ability is all about, or that he has mostly used it for.  Some\nof his victims have been Zardus(by request), and two other characters named\nGa-I forget, and BrightBlade.  And also, Skulletron used it,(sorry I did\nthat without notice guys, who remember that!) to sort of gain access to\neverything, codes, cameras, on the CF.  And now, I&#39;m gonna use it again, on\nMotormaster!  Muahaha!  Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not THAT devastating...Unless I\nmade Skulle-er-Slaughter, make Motormaster commit suicide(or convince him.)\nSee, he can display images and sounds to try and change one&#39;s emotions and\nfeelings about something or somebody.  He made two people fall in love by\ndisplaying images of hearts around one person, and stuff.  And, when Zardus\nasked him to, Skulletron eventually made Zardus give off a little giggle, by\ndisplaying (corny) humorous things.  Now, in my next post, tell what\nMotormaster feels.....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
