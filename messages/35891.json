(and I started posting again for my\n&gt; characters that were already there). =P I will say that I disagree\n&gt; with the Cybrats being able to find the Autobot hidden launch site\n&gt; so easily, or smell its fuel for that matter, it was supposed to be\n&gt; top secret. =|\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC2: Jordan, since Icedemon has decided to part with the rpg,\n&gt; that means that one of your characters will end up as second in\n&gt; command. I suggest Crotale, and he would come in after the\n&gt; Autobots crash on the planet, if they ever launch. *kidney shot to\n&gt; CyberwolF* =P\n&gt;\n&gt; On 29 May 2001, at 0:33, CYBERWOLF4 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t worry R the Cybrats are street punks on Cybertron, they&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; either be dead (I didn&#39;t expect a fight with the Dinobots) or crawl\n&gt; &gt; back into thier hole either with thier prize or to lick thier wounds.\n&gt; &gt; (If I would&#39;ve thought about it sooner I would&#39;ve changed the name but\n&gt; &gt; I threw them in on the spur of the moment.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
