I=\r\nt is common knowledge that sweeps, as a group,\nhave about the best tracking=\r\n gear among the Decepticon/predacon forces, and\nthey themselves are designe=\r\nd as scouring vehicles whos focus is to find and\nlocate survivors or runawa=\r\nys.\n\nHere is an excerpt on Scourge&#39;s profile, which also applies a lesser e=\r\nxtent\nthe sweeps . . .\n\n&quot;Scourge is possessed of scanning and locating equi=\r\npment, which can detect\nmachine or human presence even if it is as small as=\r\n an amoeba in the ocean\nor a wind-up toy in the Sahara desert. &quot;\n\nI just wa=\r\nnted to give you some insight as to the sweeps as an FYI. The\nsweeps cannot=\r\n SEE the Maximals under the cover of the forest that they are\nin, but then =\r\nagain Night Shift and Rat Trap cannot see if the Sweeps have\nleft either.

It is c=\r\nommon knowledge that sweeps, as a group, have about the best tracking gear =\r\namong the Decepticon/predacon forces, and they themselves are designed as s=\r\ncouring vehicles whos focus is to find and locate survivors or runaways.&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic sans ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic sans ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;Here is an=A0excerpt on Scourge=\r\n&#39;s profile, which=A0also applies=A0a lesser extent the sweeps . . .&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;courier new,monospace&quot;&gt;&quot;Sc=\r\nourge is possessed of scanning and locating equipment, which can detect mac=\r\nhine or human presence even if it is as small as an amoeba in the ocean or =\r\na wind-up toy in the Sahara desert. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D=\r\n&quot;comic sans ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic sans m=\r\ns,sans-serif&quot;&gt;I just wanted to give you some insight as to the sweeps as an=\r\n FYI. The sweeps cannot SEE the Maximals under the cover of the forest that=\r\n they are in, but then again Night Shift and Rat Trap cannot see if the Swe=\r\neps have left either. However as any Maximal might note, it would be danger=\r\nous to assume that they have lost complete track of them, especially since =\r\nthe sweeps cannot themselves be scanned.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\nPreston&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0On Tue, Mar 29, 2011 at=\r\n 12:22 PM, Sandy &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@...&quot;&gt;magicquartz@y=\r\nahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; =A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Out of the frying pan and into the fire. Night Shift slows=\r\n himself down considerably now navigating through harsh terrain. High beams=\r\n are put on as he slows his roll down to a crawl, and then stops.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot; I could continue but I&#39;d rather not risk =\r\nthe tires. I only got one spare left. Time for robot mode little buddy.&quo=\r\nt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Rat Trap gets out, as Night Shift takes =\r\nto robot mode.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot;I just thought of some=\r\nthn&#39;.. Cheetor, we dunno whatever happened ta him.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Night Shift looks to him.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;=\r\n &quot;You&#39;re right, we don&#39;t.

Besides, those airheads probab=\r\nly think we&#39;ve gotten wrecked big time. So why not continue the illusio=\r\nn?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Rat Trap grins.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot;Oooh yeah, good thinkn&#39;. I dunno if I like this pla=\r\nce, but it&#39;s better than havn&#39; those airheads blastn&#39; the fuzz =\r\noff my tail end.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Together they walk i=\r\nnto the dense overgrowth, exploring its parameters with what little light c=\r\nomes from Night Shift&#39;s high beams.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Ins=\r\nide the Ark, Tucson makes his way toward Rodimus&#39;s position, while keep=\r\ning close tabs on the signal he&#39;s able to work with, as faint as it is.=\r\n He also picks up on Rodimus as he now approaches him quietly.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot; I take it you&#39;ve picked up on Nightrazor&#3=\r\n9;s trail. Well, he&#39;s checked himself in but he won&#39;t check himself=\r\n out. His signatures are fluctuating, which means he&#39;s trying to recali=\r\nbrate his systems. Hense he&#39;s also distracted. Good time to apprehend h=\r\nim. All right, I&#39;m going in, but before I do, I used my last pair of st=\r\nasis cuffs, would you by chance have another I could borrow?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Straight Shot now transforms into her robot mode.&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot; So what happens after you cuff &#39;=\r\nem?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Tucson looks to her.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll have Stanton and bump disable his cloak=\r\ning abilities, and his weaponry, by removing the cards that enable them. We=\r\n&#39;ll secure those cards in the vault under maximum security. Then, we wi=\r\nll bring him back online, and hopefully get some answers out of him. After =\r\nthat though, he remains in our custody under Maximum security. When all is =\r\nsaid and done, Rodimus, I&#39;d like to meet with you and the rest, as to h=\r\now we&#39;re going to deal with Nightrazor appropriately.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Straight Shot nodds.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot;Sounds good ta me. That should make Hydras squirm.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Outside, Uproar and Quickstride notice that things are =\r\nturning difficult for Leo and the other maximals. Uproar gets into robot mo=\r\nde, as he looks to Quickstride who does the same thing.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Uproar ejects his claws to full length, and glances over to hi=\r\ns comrade.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot; You go for Waspinator, I&=\r\n#39;ll go for Cyclonus.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Quickstride e=\r\nyes him.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot; Right, I&#39;ve always want=\r\ned ta give that bug a good swatting. Now&#39;s my chance.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; They knock fists together and then split up to deal wi=\r\nth their intended opponents.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Uproar growls =\r\nas he addresses Cyclonus while leaping into the air on strong legs.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot;BANZAIIII!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&gt; He raises his left arm to attempt a powerful claw swipe.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Quickstride calibrates his large blast cannon=\r\n, and takes careful aim at Waspinator. He chuckles under his breath.&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot; Bye bye BUGGIE!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; His finger pulls back on the trigger, as he now attempts to sho=\r\not Waspinator down.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Airshadow Nightstar &=\r\nlt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; Hydra=\r\ns/windlord/Kup/Elita/Talon/Perceptor:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;Nightrazor, LEAVE THAT PLACE INMEDEATLY&quot;said Hydras by coml=\r\nink whine he fire back to Bantos and Torca&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; *********************************&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; Windlord k=\r\neep the fire in Deepstrike while Kup continue to shooting Scourge and the s=\r\nweeps, he had a hard time doing that.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; ***********&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; Elita hide behin=\r\nd Ramulus but still she was peeking trying to find out who were the fallen =\r\nones...&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; ****************&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&gt; &gt; Talon held a moan and waited patiently that all is over.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; ************&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor continue working fast trying to seal all acces t=\r\no the sleeping Autobots and decepticons &quot;Legacy, we must find the way =\r\nto seal the ARK!!! we have to keep out Hydras of the ark&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Super Cyclonus&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, March 28, 2011 10:35 AM&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; To: &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: BATTLE at the Ark!&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; The battle around the Ark continues to rage as massive amounts of f=\r\nirepower are thrown from both the Maximal aide as well as the Predacon!&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Outside the Ark, Rat Trap clings to Night =\r\nShift with his dear life, fearing that their distraction may not be enough =\r\nto foil the sweeps.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;snip/cut/=\r\npaste&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Night Shift turns =\r\noff the beaten path, and heads down a rather steep slope, as his tires roll=\r\n over rough terrain, heading right for a patch of heavy vegitation. His sus=\r\npension system is now put to the test as he rolls along without a worry in =\r\nthe world, knowing that perhaps this would prove difficult for a sweep to f=\r\nollow him in such thick brush cover.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, hopefully this will get those air heads off our =\r\ntail pipe.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; As the duo put the pedal to the metal=\r\n and fly over the rough terrain they are able to flee into the under the co=\r\nver of a dense canopy of an ancient forest. The path that Nightshift has ch=\r\nosen is extremely rough hewn, driving over large stones and thickly gnarled=\r\n roots. However as they flee further into it, it gets darker and darker sin=\r\nce much of the sun is blocked out from over head. For the moment there is n=\r\no visible sign of the sweeps, only dense foliage and the animals that are f=\r\nleeing at the sight and sound of the large vehicle that is moving through!&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Back at the Ark, Tucson realizes that =\r\nhe&#39;s lost Nightrazor for the moment, and decides not to try a shot at h=\r\nim. Instead, he concentrates and decides it&#39;s best to just follow him. =\r\nYet he wanted Nightrazor to know he was there. But without a fix on him, he=\r\n had to start from scratch.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He turns on the PA on his gauntlett.&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Don&#39;t make this ha=\r\nrder than it has to be, Nightrazor.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; There is no =\r\nanswer from Nightrazor, there was only the buzzing sounds of shorted relays=\r\n that are attempting to reset themselves. Straight Shot can sometimes see t=\r\nhe flicker of lights as the Ark attempted to right itself with preceptor an=\r\nd legacy&#39;s help, but so far they are unsuccessful.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He narrows his optics.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Rodimus, I need you to concentrate your vigil over =\r\nthe sleeping Autobots!

If one Autobot is touched,=\r\n do not hesitate to do the same to a Decepticon!

Hooves are geat de=\r\nfense weapons, &#39;specially when ya wanna strike a bot below the belt, if=\r\n ya know what I mean, Torca.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; He charges in beast mode toward his enemys, at a strong trot and heft=\r\ny snort.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; As =\r\nQuickstride and Leo II come running out of the Ark, the door of which was b=\r\neginning to lower, they could both see Hydras, followed by Cyclonus, Infern=\r\no and Waspinator flying directly at it! Powerful blasts from the Predacons,=\r\n although carefully aimed so as to only hit Leo, Quickstride and Torca who =\r\nwas rushing over to try to hold the door, made if difficult to run across t=\r\nhe field of fire!&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Windlord Opened fire against Deepstrike trying to impeding his entrance to=\r\n the Ark.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kup cursed an=\r\nd keep firing at Scourge and the sweeps.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; Scourge was t=\r\nruly a menace in the air, using his agility to out maneuver the more landbo=\r\nund Autobot. Kup was able to hit Scourge with a few glancing blows, but Sco=\r\nurge was made of sterner stuff, and continued to rain down fire on Kup.&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; Deepstryke on the other hand was bu=\r\nilt like a tank. He was definitely NOT built for manuverablity, but he was =\r\nheavily armored. Like a cross between a gun emplacement and a satellite Dee=\r\npstryke took a few hits from Windlord, but he kept returning fire with his =\r\npowerful and precise cannons. However for the moment Windlord seemed to be =\r\nsuccessful in keeping Deepstryke from following Hydras towards the Ark!&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He [Tuscon] slams a foot down hard, and a=\r\nt the same time, lets loose another round of formidable sonar waves.&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; There was no sound or movement in or near the room with Tusc=\r\non and Straight Shot, however there was a new wave of sparks that ran throu=\r\ngh the Ark&#39;s systems as once again Tuscon&#39;s wave wreaks havoc.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; There is no sign of the intruder wit=\r\nh Tuscon, however a weak signal does appear in the front chamber, the very =\r\nsame chamber that held the font door, as well as the fallen Autobots and De=\r\ncepticons! It would seem that the intruder has used his time wisely and was=\r\n attempting to make a fast get away!&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Meanwhile Hydras received a message from Deepstryke, &quot;Sir. I am d=\r\netecting a wave harmonic affect emanating from within the Ark.&quot; Deepst=\r\nryke was of course talking about the wave Tuscon was emimitting. &quot;Shal=\r\nl I attempt to counter it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Meanwhile back inside the Ark:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Elita squeezed Ramulu&#39;s hand and asaid quietly &quot;I want my momm=\r\nie... I want her back&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; as well as my dad&quot;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I will get you to her as soon as I can. Come.&quot;=\r\n Romulus said. His voice was guff, unused to speaking to young Autobots. Tu=\r\nrning to look around for a moment he glanced back at Elita. &quot;We have t=\r\no get you to safety. &quot;Stay behind me.&quot; He took off at a slow jog =\r\ndown one of the side hallways, occasionally looking back to be sure that El=\r\nita was keeping up.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; Then Romulus=\r\n stopped as he came to be standing over two dark shapes lying on the floor.=\r\n &quot;Oh dear Primus!&quot; he said. He looked back at Elita, shock and fe=\r\nar in his optics, &quot;Stay back. You don&#39;t need to see this.&quot;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--20cf307d03e27b923b049fb761de--\r\n\n"}}
