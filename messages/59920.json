Telemetry... online. Targetting... \n&gt; online. Artillery... online. Retalian ready for battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Retalian, the super gun, was now ready. Dreadplague leaped right \n&gt; next to the control panel and locked visually to the small \nsatellite\n&gt; that the Minions had left.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dreadplague: Retalian, confirm lock and fire! Destroy that \nslaggin&#39; \n&gt; scrap!\n&gt; \n&gt; Retalian: Lock confirmed. Powering up... firing.\n&gt; \n&gt; A powerful detonation rocked the crater and sent the transformers \nin \n&gt; it falling down as Retalian recoiled nearly to the bottom of the \n&gt; crater. The shot was mighty and savage.\n&gt; \n&gt; In space, the satellite was utterly blow apart. Not even melting \n&gt; remains were left.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dreadplague: Yes! We&#39;ve done it!\n&gt; \n&gt; Immediatly, static confirmed that communications were back.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, long range radars also detected something huge in the \n&gt; Moon&#39;s orbit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron had arrived.\n\n\n"}}
