Lunarpine\n&gt; had always told her that she had the passion to\n&gt; become a strong warrior. Her headache died as she\n&gt; ceased useing her mental abilities helping her see\n&gt; straight. The mutant looked around the battlefield\n&gt; for another target. The battle was far from over and\n&gt; even though Prowl had come forward to take command\n&gt; she still fealt the need to apear to be a strong\n&gt; leader. The mutant owl flew toward the ground trying\n&gt; to regain her composure when the Earth below began\n&gt; to spin sending Ice into an instant state of\n&gt; virtigo. She blinked and shook her head trying to\n&gt; shake off the feeling of dizzyness. Unsuccessfull\n&gt; the owl plumetet into a tailspin causing her speed\n&gt; to increase. She tried to transform but her mind was\n&gt; to jumbled by the effort to think straight. With a\n&gt; hard crash she &quot;landed&quot; on her head and blacked out.\n&gt; Her internal systems would eventually heal her but\n&gt; until they did she&#39;d remain in a deep sleep.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Michael Coburn \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Friday, November 02, 2001 8:44 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Another female loseing her mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   OOC:  My last post for Surgital was having him\n&gt; leave and head back to the Decepticon base...\n&gt;     ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;     From: CYBERWOLF4 \n&gt;     To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;     Sent: Friday, November 02, 2001 9:13 AM\n&gt;     Subject: Re: Another female loseing her mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     OOC:  My \n&gt;        This is the last post I can find for the mind\n&gt; battle.

He was down on his knees, which made small\n&gt; craters in the ground, and holding his fists, trying\n&gt; to shake it off.  \n&gt; \n&gt;       Ice fealt satisfaction in her latest\n&gt; acomplishment. It wasn&#39;t every day a single bot\n&gt; forces a gestault to it&#39;s knees. mentally she tried\n&gt; to reach out to any Maximal that could hear her\n&gt; thoughts. The mutant forced herself through the pain\n&gt; and tried to direct the order to attack while the\n&gt; giant was down. When this battle was over she knew\n&gt; she&#39;d need either an asprin or a labotamy to stop\n&gt; the pain.\n&gt;         ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;         From: CYBERWOLF4 \n&gt;         To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;         Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 12:57 PM\n&gt;         Subject: Another female loseing her mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Surgitals flashback was sent into Ices mind,\n&gt; she saw everything as if it was happening to her.\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s not happening to me, it&#39;s not me.&quot; she kept\n&gt; telling herself as blade after blade struck her\n&gt; mental form. Trying desperately to control her\n&gt; thoughts she shouted another command. &quot;SEPERATE&quot;\n&gt;          \n&gt;         Her owl form spun out of control as she hit\n&gt; the ground. Seeing that form cut and beaten she\n&gt; transformed to her mutant robot mode. Her bearlike\n&gt; paws covered her head as a migrane began to form.\n&gt; She tried to be the good leader but her sanity would\n&gt; soon fade if her mind didn&#39;t leave Surgital. \n&gt;           ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;           From: Samir Duran \n&gt;           To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;           Sent: Tuesday, October 09, 2001 4:15 PM\n&gt;           Subject: The Cybers Will Never Rule since\n&gt; Tankor sucks when it comes to spelling and using\n&gt; capitals\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;          \n&gt; ::Triggerhappy/Skullgrin/Jume/Whee/Surgital::\n&gt;            \n&gt;           Triggerhappy&#39;s finger moved to pull the\n&gt; trigger.  Hell Drak&#39;s eyes were closed tight,\n&gt; waiting for death.  But nothing happened.  She\n&gt; opened her eyes.  Triggerhappy was hit, and fell to\n&gt; his knees, mouth wide open, shocked, and in pain.  \n&gt;            \n&gt;           &quot;You.....&quot; Triggerhappy stopped to gasped\n&gt; for air, &quot;Pile of.......&quot;\n&gt;            \n&gt;           Triggerhappy fell down on his face, so he\n&gt; was laying on the ground.  Where his face was, a\n&gt; puddle of mechfluid appeared, and mechfluids started\n&gt; spilling from where he had been hit.  The punctures\n&gt; in his metal started to turn into cracks, and\n&gt; mechfluid came out.\n&gt;            \n&gt;           Skullgrin, Jume, and Whee watched as\n&gt; Triggerhappy had been supposedly defeated.\n&gt;            \n&gt;           &quot;NO!  MY DECEPTIPAL!&quot; Skullgrin shouted.\n&gt;            \n&gt;           Skullgrin transformed into Pretender mode,\n&gt; and had his massive, freaky club.  He ran at\n&gt; AzureBlade and threw a lethal blow to AzureBlade&#39;s\n&gt; head.  Jume and Whee fired at AzureBlade.\n&gt;            \n&gt;           &quot;No!  Watch out!&quot; Hell Drak yelled.\n&gt;            \n&gt;           A light came into her optics, and then she\n&gt; quickly got up and dove at AzureBlade, trying to\n&gt; take him down, but out of the way of damage...\n&gt;           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;           Surgital suddenly felt something from Ice.\n&gt;  The mind thing.  Pain.  \n&gt;            \n&gt;           &quot;No........not this.......I thought I had\n&gt; forgot about this!&quot; Surgital said, but which Bodicon\n&gt; was saying it, nobody knew.\n&gt;            \n&gt;           Surgital didn&#39;t feel physical pain, but a\n&gt; flashback showed up, and would be visible in the\n&gt; minds of both Ice and all the Bodicons.  It was a\n&gt; flashback from Decapitron!  \n&gt;            \n&gt;           Flashback:  Decapitron was tied to a\n&gt; conveyer belt, with some sort of energon rope.  He\n&gt; was horrified, and was screaming for help.  Then, he\n&gt; went forward, and a bunch of saws and stuff came\n&gt; down!  They started cutting at Decapitron.  All he\n&gt; could do was scream in sheer pain.  Each saw blade\n&gt; had the Autobot symbol engraved on it.  Decapitron,\n&gt; still tied onto the conveyer belt, was now heading\n&gt; into a large box thing.  On the way, a heavy thing\n&gt; with an Autobot symbol came down and sort of crushed\n&gt; Decapitron&#39;s head.  Then, Decapitron went into the\n&gt; box thing, which also had an Autobot symbol, and\n&gt; then the doors of the box shut, and then Decapitron\n&gt; was stuck, and he was getting beaten and battered. \n&gt; After the 10 minute torture process was done in the\n&gt; box, Decapitron kept going.  Mechfluid and oil and\n&gt; stuff were pouring like mad, and he was mangled and\n&gt; dislocated and stuff.  Finally, he was at the end,\n&gt; and was dumped off of the conveyer belt and onto the\n&gt; ground.  The last thing he had seen back then when\n&gt; that happened, was Autobots around him, laughing\n&gt; sinisterly with evil eyes and faces.  \n&gt;           *Flashback Ends*\n&gt;            \n&gt;           Surgital was still...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;           Your use of Yahoo!
