He knew where he dropped his gun \nbut didn&#39;t dare try for it, that was probably the first thing his \nopponent would try to avoid.\n\nHis sense of smell was the main advantage that he had, he knew the \nopponent was closeing fast and had a powerful weapon. But if it was a \ntypical predacon it would try for an up close and personal kill. Just \nso it could gloat.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::DeathScythe::\n&gt; \n&gt; DeathScythe smiles as he sees Lunarpine fly back and drop his \nrilfe.
