If somebody could write up a summary for me, I would be forever in their\ndebt.\n\nThank you.\n\nInferno731@... wrote:\n\n&gt; teleportation is not illegal it only is if you constantly use it. there are\n&gt; enough non-fan created characters that can do it. just use it wisely\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Failed tests, classes skipped, forgotten locker combinations.\n&gt; Remember the good &#39;ol days\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/7076/13/_/_/_/964285980/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
