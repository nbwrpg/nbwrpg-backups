He watched the Oblitercons as they \ngrumbled, not happy about finding out they&#39;d just been assigned as Nemesis&#39; \nbody guards.  But they were soon silenced by a pay increase of liquid energon.\n\nNemesis had received reports from a dozen Alliance members and he expected \nmore, but he wasn&#39;t about to sit on his skidplate and do nothing.  Action was \nneeded.  He seemed to be a little out of the loop though.  He activated his \nwide broadcast to all Alliance members.\n\n&quot;This is your leader, Nemesis Enforcer, shiny Nemesis, mighty Nemesis.  \nThis...spy...mission will be put on hold until I know more info.  So \nWheeljack I&#39;ll be on my way to have a little convo. with you.  Keep reporting \nin, all Alliance members, if you haven&#39;t done so already.  Maintain your \npositions, defenses on Alliance Island will be put on full alert.&quot;  The \nleader of the Alliance said, giving a nod to Punch and then the Oblitercons \nas Dark One and Pyro stepped in front of him to lead the way as they headed \ntowards the laboratory, Mortar, Hiss, and Scrounge leading the behind of the \ngroup.\n\nPunch pressed a few buttons, weapons all over the Alliance Island activating \nand weapons coming online.  Sensors powered up fully, sweeping over every \ninch there range allowed.\n\n---\n\nJaws just continued swimming, almost always on patrol anyway.\n\n===\n\nScatterblaster kind of ignored Nemesis&#39; transmission, sitting in his \ncharacter and waxing his armor as it had grown in size.\n\n"}}
