He sat in \nfront of a boulder, staring out into the distance. An auto-gun wasn&#39;t far \nfrom him.

He was bored and the \ntwo bragging brothers weren&#39;t doing too much for him, except annoy him. He \nleaned his head back until the back of his head hit the long plate behind \nhim. He needed something to do, but he couldn&#39;t leave the base.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
