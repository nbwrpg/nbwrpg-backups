I&#39;m not that bad. But this one in my dream, he\n&gt; was huge. And ugly. He was really big. He had a huge lizard head. Big\n&gt; teeth that dripped drool all over as he walked. He had tiny little\n&gt; forearms with sharp claws. He had two big legs that he walked on and\n&gt; a long scaley tail.(She&#39;s describing T-Rex Megatron, but had never\n&gt; seen him before.) And he had big red glowing eyes. But I got away\n&gt; from him in my dream. I out ran him.&quot; she said smiling.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Aerotaur says that when things are right, we will find ArchAngle and\n&gt; he&#39;ll fix me up. But I don&#39;t know how he&#39;ll fix me.
