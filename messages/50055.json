She was willing to know more of him, after he had left the true \nWolves.\n\nKatya: Tell me, Ragnar, how was it with Phelan? And what happened in \nthe Arc-Royal Defense Cordon?\n\nRagnar smiled: Well, it has been a job to keep the Jade Falcons back \nas we could from the cordon. The Kell Hounds did help a lot, and their \nmech facilities helped us to rebuild a rather strong touman. Then, I \nwas captured by the Bears...\n\nKatya: Ah yes! I remember Bjorn Jorgensson saying once you were a key \nelement for the Ghost Bears. What then?\n\nRagnar thought for a moment.\n\nRagnar: Bjorn is a man I can call my friend, a soldier I can call a \ntrue warrior, and a politician of the kind of the Kerenskys! He \ntrusted me, pushed me back to the warrior&#39;s way and eventually gave me \ncommand of the Rasalhague Bears. I never actually dreamt of commanding \nwarriors of my former nation among the Clans...\n\nKatya remembered the time he was a wolf. A young and bright freeborn \nwarrior of kind of Phelan Kell. He would have been bloodnamed too if \nhe had proved to have common genetic material with clan bloodlines.\n\nHer mind drifted and she looked at the sky. Her warden tendencies \nnever prevented her to rise in a crusader clan, but she did not like \nthe idea that she would not be totally able to prevent Vlad Ward to \nconquer the Inner Sphere.\n\nShe saw something in the sky and magnified to see enough of it. \nUnfortunately, she still could not make out what it was.\n\nKatya: There is something coming. It seems metallic and it is coming \nfast.\n\nRagnar: Then we prepare...\n\nBoth transformed, once more becoming the war machines they guised as, \nready to fight if need be.\n\n\n"}}
