I am now in charge of updating the website.\n&gt; Just to clear a \n&gt; few things up, the site is: \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.nbwrpg.com/~rauq/\n&gt; \n&gt; It can also be reached by typing\n&gt; http://www.nbwrpg.com/ but NOT by \n&gt; typing http://www.nbwrpg.com/~zardus/ k? (going to\n&gt; the /~zardus/ \n&gt; extension won&#39;t get you to the page that&#39;s being\n&gt; updated, it&#39;ll get \n&gt; you to the back up page.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The events page is majorly in need of an update. I\n&gt; changed a few \n&gt; things already, but I haven&#39;t been reading all of\n&gt; the posts, so I&#39;m \n&gt; not exactly sure what&#39;s happening with each faction\n&gt; right now. I \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t mind at all if people were to email me with\n&gt; Base Locations, \n&gt; Faction happenings, Battles, Treaties, and\n&gt; Relationships.\n&gt; \n&gt; The characters page is also now up to date with\n&gt; current times.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nCheck out Yahoo!
