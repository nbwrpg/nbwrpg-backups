Telling him that you don&#39;t like it, with a\n&gt; bunch of \n&gt; senseless slander isn&#39;t going to make him post the\n&gt; way you&#39;d like \n&gt; him to post.\n&gt; \n&gt; Narrator, keep ooc comments out of your posting, if\n&gt; you want to say \n&gt; something, say it and no pot shots. And I find it\n&gt; really hard to \n&gt; believe that you managed to put &#39;piece of dog shit&#39;\n&gt; and &#39;grow up&#39; in \n&gt; the same context.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone wants to grow up, then they should shut up\n&gt; about this \n&gt; stupid arguement, and get back to role playing.\n&gt; Nothing anyone can \n&gt; say now short of an appologies and &#39;I&#39;m being\n&gt; quiet&#39;, can show me \n&gt; that anyone is growing up.\n&gt; \n&gt; *preps for backlash*\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; BULL-FUCKING-SHIT YOU HAVE.
