How dare she even speak his name with such \ncarelessness!\nCarnage stopped and waited for the clone to walk ahead then brought her jaws \ndown on the tip of it&#39;s tail, it was just a quick snap...just enough to draw \nmech fluid and hurt just enough for the clone to get her  point.If Cyber \nClaw was going to travel with them then she had to get one thing straight!*\n\n&quot; You shut your trap! If I ever..ever hear you speak about my friend like \nthat again I&#39;ll tear you limb from  limb! You understand me? Weather you \nthink I can do it or not! So if you want to travel with my friend and I it \nwould advise that you drop this &#39; I can do anything since I look like \nDinobot&#39; slag!&quot;\n\n* Carnage then walked up beside Cyber Claw and looked at her through the \nside of her eye, then turned her attention to the road ahead.\nThis clone was pushing her luck!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
