He gets\n&gt; right to work on trying to restore functionability to the control pannel.\n&gt; At the same time, he looks for his special audio player to try and get some\n&gt; music going, but realizes he hasn&#39;t got it anymore.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Aw slag, no digital radio.  I forgot, gave that up when I gave up the\n&gt; wheels.  If I&#39;m gonna do some serious work, I need some tunes ta work by.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks around, and finds a pannel that resembles a radio recieving\n&gt; station.  He then cracks his knuckles and gets to work on restoring it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Let&#39;s see if this will work. &quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nActually the work goes rather quickly as the parts, although extremely\nadvanced, are also built to be user friendly. Slipping a circuit board\nhere, sliding out one from there, replacing a processor or two and a\nbit of quick soldering has the board that NIGHTSHIFT is working on in\ngood shape.\n\nIn fact as NIGHTSHIFT is sliding his last piece into place PROWL is\ndoing much the same thing.\n\n&quot;Okay!&quot; PROWL said as he spoke into his radio. &quot;Give us some power.&quot;\n\nIt took a moment and then there was a thrumming of power through the\ncommunication boards. There was a single spark then then the lights\nflickered and went green, it was working again.\n\nPROWL stepped over and activated a switch and the boards began to\nlight up as the back up antenna went into operation.\n\n&quot;Have we got it?&quot; POLAR CLAW said as he came from the lower levels.\n\nThe lights on the boards registered a signal being sent from the tower\nto the satellite up in space, it registered the satellites computers,\nthere was an acknowledgement, a request for data . . . .\n\n               . . . &quot;Uh oh&quot; WOLFGANG said as he saw the response. . . .\n\n                       . . . . there was no returning other response\nfrom the satellite uplink , no data returned.\n\n&quot;Could it be the satellite?&quot; WOLFGANG said with a shrug.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
