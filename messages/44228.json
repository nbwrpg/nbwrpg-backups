Each saw blade had the Autobot symbol eng=\r\nraved on it.  Decapitron, still tied onto the conveyer belt, was now headin=\r\ng into a large box thing.  On the way, a heavy thing with an Autobot symbol=\r\n came down and sort of crushed Decapitron&#39;s head.  Then, Decapitron went in=\r\nto the box thing, which also had an Autobot symbol, and then the doors of t=\r\nhe box shut, and then Decapitron was stuck, and he was getting beaten and b=\r\nattered.  After the 10 minute torture process was done in the box, Decapitr=\r\non kept going.  Mechfluid and oil and stuff were pouring like mad, and he w=\r\nas mangled and dislocated and stuff.  Finally, he was at the end, and was d=\r\numped off of the conveyer belt and onto the ground.  The last thing he had =\r\nseen back then when that happened, was Autobots around him, laughing sinist=\r\nerly with evil eyes and faces.  \n      *Flashback Ends*\n       \n      Surgi=\r\ntal was still...\n\n\n      Your use of Yahoo!
