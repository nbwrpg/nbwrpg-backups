It should contain the name of your faction and hopefully some \npics or something. You can look around at other ads on the web and \nget a good design. Please do NOT send ads in .bmp format, send them \nin either .jpg or .gif. BMP files take up too much space to load \nquickly. If your life depends on sending your ad as a BMP file, go \nahead and send it, and I&#39;ll just convert it to GIF on my comp.\n\nFaction description page: Allright, first of all, let me explain some \nstuff. When you guys send your faction descriptions, you should send \nanything associated with it as well (background music, background \ngrafics, etc..) as email attachments. If you guys don&#39;t send \nbackground stuff in then I will use the default (the TF background \nand no music). Also, you should specify exactly what color you want \nthe text to be, or it will be the default yellow. If you know HTML, \ngo ahead and make an HTML page and send it to me.\n\nA few guidelines for the faction page: Don&#39;t insult any factions or \nbots on it! Facts (like battle results and stuff) are fine, but no \nputting down other factions. Your faction page should include a \ndescription of your faction, its location, what it does, and I \nstrongly recommend a detailed description of the base (if you got \npics of it, send it to me over email). I would also put in the name \nof the commander and the email address of that bot&#39;s owner.\n\nPlease remember that this is mainly to make new members aware of the \nfactions so that they could decide who to join. This might be kinda a \nwaste of time for commanders of factions that don&#39;t accept new bots.\n\n\nAs for my side of this whole project, it isn&#39;t going too great. I&#39;ll \nget they system working eventually, but till then, DON&#39;T send me the \nad stuff, store it on your comps.\n\n\n"}}
