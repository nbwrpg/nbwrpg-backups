The trainers autoguns were hurting thier target\nbut it seemed to have the bad habit of regenerating before the guns could do\nany serious damage. There seemed only one way to handle an opponent this\npowerfull. Out near the now destroyed minefield a small round launcher arose\nfrom the sand. It fired three disks toward the opponent. The launcher didn&#39;t\nhave enough power to reach Hellpeon so the disks fell harmlessly to the\nground below the attacker.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Legendarynemasis@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, June 12, 2001 12:50 PM\nSubject: Re: Say Welcome to Grizzltron\n\n\nOOC: Whee Cyberwolf, did you respond to both attacks on the trainers\nbase shields from Hellpeon yet?
