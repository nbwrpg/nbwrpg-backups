Her breath \npuffs a swirling frosty mist into the crisp icy air. She stretches and \nlooks around for signs of other robots. &quot;Termitron, you see \nanything?&quot; Without really waiting for an answer, she continues \nlooking without much success. Her head tilts to look up at the \nridges surrounding the Valley, her nose twitches as she picks up \nthe scent of a deer, but she shurgs and continues. &quot;Termitron, we&#39;ll \ngo to that peak over there and take a look around,&quot; she points to a \nlarge mountain that protrudes nearly to the cloud line. &quot;We might \nbe able to see something from there. I think I&#39;ll try a commlink \nbroadcast but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get much in this valley, we&#39;re too \nsurrounded with obstructions... on the top maybe..&quot; She finishes, \nthe last part to herself. She starts plodding on to the peak, her fur \ntuffted ears perked and listening to see if Termitron follows.\n\n"}}
