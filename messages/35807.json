It certainly looks like Slaughter is between a boulder and a\n&gt; very hard place.  Since just entering the Decepticon base, he&#39;s went from\n&gt; the frying pan into the fire!  I lost Skulletron once, I won&#39;t have him\n&gt; ressurected into Slaughter and be lost again!\n&gt;\n&gt; IC:  Slaughter was getting desperately hungry, and had to eat soon or he\n&gt; would die, but he also had to avoid being blown to pieces.  Many\nprojectile\n&gt; explosives were being shot at him.  Slaughter was hit by 15 rifle shots\nfrom\n&gt; FireStrike, and this time only a few bits of flesh flew off, but slime\nstill\n&gt; flew everywhere like normal.  Slaughter got away from Stratus.  He\nforward,\n&gt; but high enough, and stuck his pincirs into the ceiling, then acted like\n&gt; their was sticky things on his hands, and quickly went across the ceiling,\n&gt; avoiding the mega missile, and the rockets, and all shots that were headed\n&gt; at him(sorry for missing all those shots, but I didn&#39;t want my new\nfavourite\n&gt; character to die!)\n&gt;\n&gt;     Slaughter jumped down from the ceiling, onto the floor again.\n&gt;\n&gt;      &quot;HUNGRY!!!&quot; Was the only thing Slaughter seemed to be, and be able to\n&gt; say.\n&gt;\n&gt;       Slaughter lunged at Shokaract, opening his jaw to try and take a\nbite\n&gt; out of Shokaract.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
