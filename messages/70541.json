I was caught in a compromising situation and I was\n&gt;&gt; forced to swich sides and now with the blessing of Tucson, I joined to\n&gt;&gt; Maximals&quot;said Dryly Perceptor while Kup looked his friends and nodded \n&gt;&gt; with\n&gt;&gt; his head and the predacon said&quot;Now I undoing all what i did&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elita carfully watched hdden behind a corder while Kup proceed to \n&gt;&gt; reprogram\n&gt;&gt; Windlord\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Torca nodded once, his large horns looking almost like a large crown,\n&gt; and giving is movements an almost regal look as he accepted what\n&gt; Perceptor said. &quot;It would seem that a great many things have happened\n&gt; since I have been gone.&quot; He said his tone low and deep, giving nothing\n&gt; away about whether he agreed with the decision to allow Perceptor in\n&gt; or not. Instead he looked over at the reprogramming of Windlord.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bantor, who stood just behind his commander grimmaced slightly, or\n&gt; perhaps it was a smile, it was difficult to tell with him sometimes.\n&gt; &quot;It is good that you have recovered Windlord. He was a valued\n&gt; warrior.&quot; He glanced over at Perceptor, a quizzical look on his face,\n&gt; but he glanced away. It is obviouis that it would take time for\n&gt; different ones to get used to Perceptor&#39;s presence, but for the moment\n&gt; Bantor was not attacking him - and for Bantor that was saying a lot!\n&gt;\n&gt; Torca nodded once more as he turned to leave, &quot;I must check in with\n&gt; Silverbolt. I left him charge of the Fuzors until I returned.&quot; He\n&gt; looked back at the others, &quot;But there are things that we all must\n&gt; discuss when I return.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
