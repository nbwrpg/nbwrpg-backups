It&#39;s \ndestributing rust particals as it is carried on the wind currents \nwhich just happen to be blowing towards the maximal base. The dust \ntrail left will not do anything since it&#39;s not coming in contact with \nmetal.  Now if another bot comes in contact with the cloud ie fly \nthrough it or an infected bot, ie hand to hand combat contact, then \nthe other bot is infected. YES, it&#39;s very contagios. SO BEWARE BOTS! \nTOUCH NOT UNLESS THEE WANT TO BE TOUCHED...BY DEATH!\n\n\n\n"}}
