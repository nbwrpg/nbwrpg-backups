As much as I want to be \n&gt; one, it is beyond my capablilties.&quot;  She sighed and hung her \n&gt; shoulders and head down. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for everthing that I did. I \nnever \n&gt; meant to get anyone in trouble.  I didn&#39;t mean for you to come out \n&gt; here and risk your life for me.  Even if that Pred had come back, I \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want you to get in harms way for me. I&#39;m not worth it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She checked her internal systems and found her wing had healed \n&gt; itself.  She transformed into her owl mode. &quot;I can fly again. I wil \n&gt; follow you back to the base.&quot; she said in a low, soft voice. She \nfelt \n&gt; like she made another mistake and was about o make another one by \n&gt; following him back to the base.  But part of her spark told her to \n&gt; follow Lunarpine back to the base.\n\n\n"}}
