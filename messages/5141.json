I, am Optimus Prime.  I...can&#39;t tell you what the \nMatrix is.  No one can.  You have to see it for yourself.&quot;\n\n&quot;How do I see it?  I thought it was all mystical and such.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh...good point.  Well, I guess you&#39;re screwed!&quot; he chuckled.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t believe in fairy tales!&quot; Serpentor yelled, running forward.\n\nOptimus Prime lifted jumped into the air, time seeming to freeze around him, \nhis foot snapping forward, sending Serpentor slamming backwards, clanging \nagainst the dark ground.\n\nSerpentor felt a dozen body blows, followed by a kick of some sort.  He got \nup slowly.  He hadn&#39;t seen any of the causes of the pain.  Optimus Prime one \nmore seemed to be the only thing not being frozen in time, but Serpentor \nsuddenly leapt forward, tackling Optimus Prime, punching him repeatedly until \nhis  face plate snapped halfway off.\n\n-=Serpentor.  I, amd the Matrix.  You have a higher calling!  The fool, \nVulois, has been smoking something and thinks CyberTRON should be organic, \nand that I told him to do that.  Yu, and three others must stop him and his \ncadre of blasphemers=-\n\n&quot;I thought it was two?  Scattershot, Nemesis Enforcer, and myself?&quot;\n\n-=And Shockw...how the slag did you know?!=-\n\n&quot;I am one with my inner peace.&quot;\n\n-=Get out of my site!=-\n\n(other than to get maybe a cheap laugh, reading after this has no real value \nother than learning what I really act like)\n\nSerpentor appeared in a room, the walls padded, and Zardus, Fidget, Hell \nBeast, Joseph Stalin, Mr. Floppy, and William Shatner were all in there, \nbinded by straight jackets, except for Serpentor.\n\n&quot;Come, Comrade Zardus!  Unbind me and we may rebuild the Soviet Union, your \nRussian ancestors will be proud!&quot; Stalin said, straining against the jacket.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not Russian you fool!  I&#39;m not even human!  What&#39;s the Soviet Union?&quot;\n\n&quot;The Soviet Union, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!  READ A BOOK!&quot; \nHell Beast snapped at Zardus.\n\n&quot;Come on, Hell Beast, I&#39;ll whip-smack you like a little girl!&quot; the straight \njackets came off each of the robots.  \n\nHell Beast got up, Zardus poking his eyes with two fingers.  &quot;Cheater!&quot; Hell \nBeast yelled, Zardus laughing manically, taking out a baseball bat and \nbeating Hell Beast&#39;s head to a pupl.  &quot;DIE DIE DIE!  I will now rule the \nPredacon Empire!&quot;\n\n&quot;It...is...the...Predacon...Alliance...not...Empire!  You...are... a \nfool...Zardus.  I...should...lead the Predacons...to...victory!&quot; William \nShatner cried, quickly simmering down after the baseball bat slammed into his \nhead a dozen times.\n\nA tooth was knocked loose, piercing Stalin&#39;s jugular vein, killing the \nex-leader of the Red Menace.\n\n&quot;Oh, my god, you killed Stalin!  Why am I here?  All you did was kill me!  \nLEAVE ME ALONE YOU PSYCHO!&quot; Fidget yelled, Serpentor taking Zardus&#39; bat and \nbeating on Fidget for a dozen minutes or so with the baseball bat.  &quot;Don&#39;t \ntalk back to the law!&quot;\n\n&quot;Excellent, Scattershot!  Let us conquer Cybertron now!&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not Scattershot.  SCATTERSHOT IS CRAZY, I&#39;M NOT CRAZY!&quot; Serpentor \nyelled, punching Zardus, a gold club in his hands.  Swinging the golf club \nhard, it connected with Zardus&#39; head, sending the Predacon leader slamming \ninto the metal door headfirst, falling to the ground a vegetable humming  \n&quot;Row, row, row your boat.&quot;\n\nSerpentor raised his arms in triumph.  &quot;All hail Emperor Serpentor!  Long \nlive the-UGH!&quot; Serpentor fell to his knees, a sword in his back, falling to \nhis chest, dead.\n\nMr. Floppy, the grey bunny from &quot;Unhappily Everafter&quot;, jumped on his back.\n\n&quot;Hey!  What&#39;d I tell you?  Ze bunnies always win!  And...Drew Barrymore...if \nyou&#39;re watching...I&#39;m just gonna let you know I&#39;ll be sparing you from the \nwrath of the Bunny Khan!  AHAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot; \n\nSerpentor&#39;s optics slid open, seeing Anubis place him in a CR chamber.\n\n&quot;Sweet dreams, Serpentor!&quot;\n\n&quot;No.......no.....more.......dreams.....&quot; Serpentor said in an inaudible \nwhispered, trying to scream as he couldn&#39;t see anything but the light from \nhis optic sensors.\n\n"}}
