She knew that she was outnumbered\nand overpowered. She&#39;d let her gaurd down one to many times. Now was the\ntime for the tough act. &quot;Squizzy wanted credit for my expriments, I had to\ndo to her before she did to me.&quot; She squirmed a little moire trying to get\nat least her wings uncramped. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;d have done the same if someone\nwanted to steal your technology.&quot;  Lady Hawk was playing on Zardus&#39; logic to\nescape this situation. &quot;I came to you alone and with technology that could\nhelp you in your goals.&quot; Logic dictated that she&#39;d be stupid to challenge\nthe alliance one on all. &quot;Now that I&#39;ve answered you would you release me\nand at least grant me the dignitty of walking on my own two feet?&quot;\n\n\n----- &quot;But you have two wingssss to fly too... &quot;Replied Najah, nd he asked\nt Zardus &quot;Excusssss me Ssssir... if the birdie try to fly over the\ncage, can I kill her????&quot;\n\nAgain Lady Hawk looked to logic for an answer. &quot;I&#39;m a hawk, of course I can\nfly&quot; She was really feeling offended now.\n\n\nZardus nods, &quot;Of course. But she wont try to escape, not if she wants\nto live.&quot;, &quot;Correct?&quot;\n\nLady hawk thought the question was redundant. &quot; Wher would I go?&quot; She knew\nthat at 100 percent she could probably outfly any member of the alliance.\nBut with her injuries she&#39;d either be caught or lead them back to Veratis.\n\n\n\nOriginal Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 06, 2000 5:24 PM\nSubject: Re: Najah bites at Lady Hawk\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m running into some trouble in my personal life right now, so I might\nhave\n&gt; a bit of an irregular posting rate.

Zardus looks back to Lady Hawk, &quot;Now, what were you doing to\n&gt; Squizzy?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Havoc stops, nearing the flying portions of the Alliance base. For some\n&gt; reason they had slowed, continuing ahead slowly. He activates his internal\n&gt; computers, tapping into the computer of one of the shuttles.\n&gt;\n&gt; He nods, looking through the info he got back. The cargo section was a bit\n&gt; too heavy for the shuttle carrying it, so they had to slow for now.\nAnother\n&gt; shuttle from the Iron Fist was on its way to soon help.\n&gt;\n&gt; He sighs, flying ahead to the Iron Fist.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
