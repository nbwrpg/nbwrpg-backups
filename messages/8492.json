Warlock!! You put me into a huge sleep. If you were physical \nI would kill you!\n\n I&#39;m not, but I know someone who is. Get to your feet Bronco, and \ndefeat the enemy.\n\nBronco stumbled to hsi feet, his rage blinding him. He saw the bot he \nfighting against with his back turned, busy with another bot. This is \nthe best chance he&#39;ll get. He quietly crept up on the bot(Chordan) \nand placed his Rocket Launchers right up against his back. No warning \nthis time.\n\nBronco pulled the triggers as fast as his battle worn fingers could.\n\n\n"}}
