It was \nall done internally and silently.\n\n::Striker::\n\nStriker&#39;s eyes narrow as he looks at Prebon, wondering what Prebon was \ntalking about. He hadn&#39;t said a word aloud to his computer. He frowns at \nPrebon&#39;s threat about Spears, almost having second thoughts about his plans.\n\nBut Prebon wouldn&#39;t kill Spears, he was almost sure of that. If Prebon killed \nSpears, then either Striker or Prebon would also die, probably in a duel. \nThen, either Prebon would have no hostages and the Maximals will be free to \nattack and crush, or he&#39;d be dead. Either way, he loses.\n\nActivating his link again, he sends all that his scanners had worked out \nabout the chip to the CF, looking at Prebon through the rectangular hole in \nthe door. With another silent command, his emotion circuits go offline. \nPrebon might make some very personal threats, Striker couldn&#39;t afford to go \nweak. Besides, he was sure Prebon wouldn&#39;t kill his hostages.\n\n&quot;If you kill Spears, you&#39;ll have no hostages,&quot; Striker says, in a calm voice, \nsurprizingly devoid of emotion, &quot;The Maximals would be free to crush you. And \nas the biggest faction on the planet, they wouldn&#39;t have any trouble doing \nso. If you free Spears and let us go, I can bring you Ramulus.&quot;\n\n"}}
