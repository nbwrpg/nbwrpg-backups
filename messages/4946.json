She went behind a tree\n&gt; to catch her breath.  She looked and saw Quickstrike tackle the cheeta.\nShe\n&gt; jumped out from the tree and at the fuzor.  Her teeth bared and her claws\n&gt; ready to tear into him.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------\n&gt; Quickstrike/Cheetor:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike pressed his shoulder tightly to the tree. He kept his eye on\nthe\n&gt; Maximal. Cheetor shot at him twice. The Fuzor ducked over. The side of the\n&gt; tree shattered, and the hit almost got his shoulder. He could see the kid\n&gt; was scared. If there was a way he could get around to him and hit him with\n&gt; venom he might be able to end this faster.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike dashed to another tree, to his right. Cheetor kept firing. He\n&gt; even screamed at one point. Quickstrike paused, watching him. He decided\nto\n&gt; take a risk. This was one Maximal. There were at least three Predacons in\n&gt; the area, even if two were female. He never misjudged the opposite sex.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Kid,&quot; he called out and fired at Cheetor. A second later, as Cheetor was\n&gt; dodging and wincing, Quickstrike charged out. He ran as fast as his legs\n&gt; would carry him. His feet made too much noise to be able to sneak up on\nhim.\n&gt; He plan was to catch him by surprise.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Maximal picked himself up and fired as he kept moving. He was only a\nfew\n&gt; feet away. A shot hit his foot, sending him down, but at the same time,\n&gt; Quickstrike grabbed him, and dug the long fangs into his side.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!\n&gt; 1.
