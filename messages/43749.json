The=\r\n score is \n&gt; 106 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Ballers and 102 for the Gorrilaz. =\r\n The story so far has \nbeen \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play by Gorzo.  Gorzo, A rook=\r\nie from Crystal University is 30 \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; 34 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shots made.  10 3-=\r\npointers and 15 dunks for a total of 50 \n&gt; &gt; points.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But can the =\r\nlast rank Gorrilaz with the help of Gorzo beat \nthe \n&gt; &gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ran=\r\nk Ballers?  Lets go down to the court to see what \nhappens.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Court Side Announcer:  Hello, we have 20 secounds left in the \n&gt; &gt; game=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Gorrilaz are passing in the ball as we speak.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A bot wearing a jersey that says &quot;Bentals&quot; passes the ball in \nt=\r\no \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bot wearing a jersey thats says &quot;Gorzo&quot;.  Gorzo Dribbles =\r\nthe \n&gt; ball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down the court and passes it to a bot with a jersey th=\r\nat \n&gt; &gt; says &quot;Bob&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bob then passes it to Bentals and Bent=\r\nals passes it a bot \nwith \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jersey that says &quot;Micko&quot;.  Mick=\r\no passes the ball to Bentals \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bentals passes it to Gorzo.  Gor=\r\nzo steps up to the 3-point \nline \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jumps up making it look =\r\nlike a jump shot.  At the last second \nhe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passes it to a jumping b=\r\not, which is by the goal, whose \njersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned then sl=\r\nams the ball for an Alley-op(SP?).  \n&gt; &gt; Bots \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a different jer=\r\nsey grab the ball.  The bots jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reads &quot;Feller&quot;.  Feller passes=\r\n the ball in to a bot with a \n&gt; jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which read &quot;Rauq&quot;.  (Time t=\r\no make Rauq look Stupid.)  Rauq \n&gt; starts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dribbiling the ball down=\r\n court when he trips over his own \nfeet. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ball leaves =\r\nhis hands and rolls into Gorzo hands.  Gorzo, who \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standing beh=\r\nind the 3-point line and takes a jump shot.  The \n&gt; ball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sails int=\r\no the hoop as the Buzzers sounds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Court Side Announcer:  H=\r\nOLY RUST POCKET, THE GORRILAZ WIN 107-\n&gt; &gt; 106.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; THE GORRILAZ WIN!=\r\n!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;5 Years Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Bot that was w=\r\nearing the Gorzo jersey 5 years earlier was \nin \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small 2 per=\r\nson shuttle.  He is Flying around Earth.  All of a \n&gt; &gt; sudden \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n right wing catches on fire and falls down towards Earth \nas \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; shuttle falls down with the wing.  The shuttle lands near Mid-\n&gt; &gt; Afri=\r\nca \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about 10 miles from where Dewboys Characters are.\n\n\n"}}
