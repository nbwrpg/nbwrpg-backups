She had barely noticed the arrival of the other Maximals, but \nwas quite relieved by their presence. The odds were starting to even out, \ngiving them a better chance of making it out alive.\n\nTavatron pratically roared in anger as she charged Scavenger, firing her \noptic lasers as she ran. With amaxing speed she vanquished what little space \nthere was between, sheathing her sword and drawing her staff in the process. \nWith a slight twist she had unsheathed the energon blades, spinning the \nstaff so that the uppermost blade came down and hopefully through \nScavenger&#39;s  cannon. She knew slicing it in two would be difficult, but she \nwould settle for penetration of any sort if it meant she would be able to \nincapacite his weapon.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
