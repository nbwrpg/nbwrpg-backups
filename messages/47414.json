He wanted to tell her something, so, still in \n&gt; &gt; flight, he reversed on his back, goes a bit lower and under \nMistra.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: This was a natural thing. But... there is something \nyou \n&gt; &gt; must know... about who I am... and what I feel like...\n&gt; &gt; I noticed you looked puzzled when I mentionned my brother, so I \ntake \n&gt; &gt; it you do not know him. He and I were created by maximal \nscientists to \n&gt; &gt; have sparks as unbreakable as that of Starscream, the legendary \n&gt; &gt; immortal Decepticon. However, X turned... wrong. He began \nrampaging \n&gt; &gt; and eventually destroyed Colony Omicron. I was part of the team \nwho \n&gt; &gt; caught him, but I went berserk and killed my commander. We were \nboth \n&gt; &gt; sentenced to be marooned by the Axalon, and I woke up here, on \nEarth. \n&gt; &gt; I am constantly avoiding to fight because of this. I am trying to \n&gt; &gt; attone for my sins, and I hope that one day, I will be forgiven.\n&gt; &gt; As for what pushed me to rescue you... I can feel the emotions of \n&gt; &gt; sparks, and when I saw yours... (There seems to be a lump in his \n&gt; &gt; throat) I found it beautiful! I did not want to mention it in \nfront of \n&gt; &gt; Kali... Mistra, I think I fell in love with you...&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Mistra&#39;s eyes softened as he told of his brother and past. Her ears \nwent back \n&gt; &quot;That...was horrible of them to do. The way you say it, you weren&#39;t \nin \n&gt; control when that happened. So one should blame you for something \nlike \n&gt; that...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; His final comment surprised her. More than a bit. Her cheeks would \nhave \n&gt; become tinted red, had she been capable of such a thing as blushing. \nAfter a \n&gt; moment, she smiled somewhat &quot;Azure...&quot; Another moment of silence \npassed \n&gt; before she spoke again &quot;I...can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve yet reached that \npoint. \n&gt; But...&quot; Her smile grew somewhat &quot;As long as we&#39;re being honest...I \nthink I&#39;m \n&gt; falling in love with you...&quot;\n\n\n"}}
