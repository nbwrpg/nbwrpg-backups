She knew they \nmissed each other, and he took her death very hard. But, now that the alarm \nwas screaming it ment the ship was under attack, agian!\n    She entered the bridge, and on the main viewscreen saw Atma cleaning the \nhull with some neanderthalic bots. Intersting....\n    &quot;Paralysis, Thunder Hammer! Get outside and help Atma! Im going to \ninitiate base defences and will join you.&quot; She commaded, taking the command \nchair and grabbing the key board.\n    \n    Paralysis nodded to Black Aracnia&#39;s command and looked to Decadel. He \ntook out his pistol and loaded it. &quot;So, are you ready for your first fight?&quot;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n    Aerostreak, Grappler, Gunatix, Paddletail, Auarious, and Nighteyes had \nbeen piled on the small raft for days. The ocean was brutal, but finally it \nspit them out the snady beach of the mainland.\n    &quot;Ah, this is the mainland!&quot; Aerostreak commented as he got off the raft. \nFollowing him were the others, and the Maximals in vine chains.\n    &quot;Now onto the Predacons! With our Maximal prisoners we will be welcomed \nwith open arms!&quot; Gunatix said.\n    The six bots began to make the journey to the Predacon base where they \nwould help in the battle agianst the Maximals.\n\n    Adrax looked across the vast white strech of the artic. He loved this \nview. And right now nothing in the world could bother him. He was safe, no \none ever came out here, into the cold, and this lair was amred and a natural \nfortress.\n    &quot;I think it would be wise if I were to go to the Predacons and explain \nour stnace in this war.&quot; Adrax said to Autofire.\n    Autofire had been modifying the wepons all the past week. He wated to be \nready for a bttle if one occured. &quot;Very well. I will stay here and watch the \nbase.&quot;\n    Adrax nodded, transformed into his demonic beast mode, and took to the \nwhite sky heading for the Predacon base.\n\n"}}
