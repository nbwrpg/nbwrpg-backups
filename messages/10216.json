He relives his entire life in an instant.  \nHe remembers that he had betrayed someone in his life.  Megatron.  He \nremembers that Astrotrain needed to &quot;jettison some weight&quot;.  He chose between \nloyalty to his commander and his own selfish needs, he chose himself.  Was \nthat why Galvatron forced him into stasis?  Then he sees a bot, a child, not \nmuch more than 5 steller cycles old.  Who was this stange bot?  He opens his \neyes, to see the same child standing over him, with a shield over them::\nSoundwave: Am I dead?\n\n"}}
