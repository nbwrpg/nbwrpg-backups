Other way to defend themselves would be inserting a stealth program \nthat will mask their signatures from every one, just like the device that I \ngave Nightlight to hide for Maximals... and unluky... for Hydras, it had the \nside effect to hide her for Predacons too.

Elita&#39;s protection was just as imperative as her mothers.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re right Perceptor. But the final decision should be up to Rodimus. \n&gt; Of\n&gt; course, if I were Elita&#39;s father, I&#39;d agree to it readilly.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus looked over at Tuscon, not quite sure what to make of that\ncomment. For one person to say what they would do in another&#39;s\nsituation is almost like to telling them they should do it, and to not\ndo it is unreasonable. Who is any one to tell a parent how to raise or\nprotect thier children, especially one who is not a parent?\n\nPutting that thought off for the moment he turned to Perceptor, &quot;What\ndo you mean this stealth program that would allow her to hide her\nsignature and even change it?&quot; There was a definite note of concern in\nhis voice. &quot;It can&#39;t be that easy to just switch signatures back and\nforth, if it were, wouldn&#39;t we would all be doing it?&quot; He frowned\nwondering just how Perceptor was going to come up with all of this. He\nrespected Perceptor as a scientist, but he was also protective of his\ndaughter.\n\nMeanwhile in the background Legacy watched Perceptor, his single optic\nfocused on the ex-Predacon, his thoughts are unknown, hidden as they\nwere behind his cold unmoving faceplate.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
