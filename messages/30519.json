They are his now, and together,\nthey will conquer this world, he thinks to himself. He gets off of\nAstroblast and Drag Strip, and motion for them to follow, and he flies off\nthe cliff, and lands in the middle of the Decepticons. &quot;Motormaster, Status\nreport&quot; he blurts without emotion.\n\nMotormaster walks towards the group. &quot;Mighty Megatron, our ship has a full\nstack of Energon cubes for our disposal. Scourge, Cyclonus, Triggerhappy,\nand the Terrorcons and Skullgrin are now part of the Decepticon troops,\nloyal to you. That is Switchblade&quot; he says, pointing to the small robot,\nand then pointing to the Bodicons finishes, &quot;and those are the Bodicons.&quot;\n\nMegatron bends down, and picks up his fusion cannon. While hooking it back\nup to his arm he starts. &quot;Yes, I remember Cyclonus and Scourge, I saw you\nwork through Galvatron&#39;s eyes. You were loyal to him, can I count on that\nkind of loyalty ?&quot; he asks.\n\n\n\n"}}
