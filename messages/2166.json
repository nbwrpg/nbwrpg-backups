Talking about them would just make it worse and right now she didn&#39;t even want to think about them!*\n\n&quot; There&#39;s nothing to talk about.&quot;\n\n* The truth was that she really didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with those old memories, but that was exotically what they were. Memories. Nothing real and nothing a bot could touch, images of the past that remained in the past. Nothing could bring them back to life, even though some of them she longed to bring to life.\nCarnage sighed.
