Her eyes watching and marking\nwell their route. She honestly wondered what Megatron wanted on this mud\nball of a planet, there had to be more exciting and profitable places to\ncrash a stolen maximal frigate, so why here?\n\n    History wasn&#39;t her strong suit but she heard enough boasting and\nbragging to know this planet was a key one in the line of Megatron but why\nthis time? Something had to be here that would benefit him and if it would\nbenefit he, then it stood to reason she should lay her hands on it first.\n\n    Smiling as she eyed Warheads back she saw where the lines were being\ndrawn, the weak were already bending over backwards for their &quot;leader&quot; and\nwould likely make their own plays in due course. The bot had questioned her\ntrue predicon heritage. Heh if only the tin plated fool knew, course he\nwouldn&#39;t til she killed him, but he&#39;d know the truth of the matter.\n\n    She grinned, she was as devious as the rest but then she has had\ncenturies to perfect it. She&#39;d dance the line and play these power hungry\nfools off each other, all to her gain. As it should be.\n\n\n"}}
