He&#39;d gave more power to \nstronger beings than his current servants, but he wasn&#39;t nearly as powerful \nas he had been.  For now.  /ARISE MY DARK WARRIORS.  LET MY GIFT AID YOU ON \nYOUR CELESTIAL PATH/\n\nThere was still a slight pain from the ancient being speaking, though not \nnearly as much.  Vehement stepped forward, looking pretty much the same \nexcept for a large black cannon attached to his right arm.\n\n&quot;Mighty Unicron, what do you require of us?  We are yours to command from now \nto eternity.&quot;\n\n/WE MUST MAKE A TEST OF YOUR NEW ABILITIES/\n\nGathering enough of courage that had never been in him as far as Reflector \ncould remember, he stepped forward.  The Brotherhood member waited for a \nsilent second, and spoke.  &quot;Chaos-Bringer, may I suggest an attack of some \nsort?&quot;\n\n/OF COURSE/\n\n&quot;A strike against an already wounded enemy to keep risk away?&quot;\n\n/YES.  NOW GO/ As soon ast he booming voice had spoke the three upgraded \nBrotherhood members took flight back the way they had came.\n\n"}}
