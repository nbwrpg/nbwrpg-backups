The only thing that she could do was combine the \nalliance DNA and\n&gt; hope for a more controllable creature. &quot;You will of course provide \nsome\n&gt; security to watch the results.&quot; Lady Hawk was hesitant about the \nexperiment\n&gt; but she knew that this was exactly the reason Veratis had taught \nher.\n\n\n"}}
