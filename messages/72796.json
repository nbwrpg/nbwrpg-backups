He was not\n&gt; about to quit now, or at any time.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m sure. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson states as he gets back into robot mode.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ve seen something similar to this in training with Master Yoketron.  It\n&gt; was one of his more difficult excercises.  It taught me further into the art\n&gt; of balance and dexterity, simply by using my skills at a more conscious\n&gt; level.  I know we&#39;ll need that now. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He slowly walks a step further in and looks around.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I can go first and map a safe route for the rest of you.  Just follow my\n&gt; lead and a scratch mark I will leave on various surfaces to show you the\n&gt; safest way through.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He finds his first step and tests the ground, before marking it for the rest\n&gt; of the team.  Three claw marks drawn in a symbol makes the way to safer\n&gt; grounds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; All right, Mach Kick&#39;s right, we better be on our way.  Careful, just\n&gt; follow me and you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBIG CONVOY nodded, &quot;But don&#39;t let over confidence get the better of\nyou. Just because you can fly doen&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be brought down.&quot;\n\nHefting his weapon CONVOY motioned for BREAK and MACK KICK to follow\nhim as he followed TUSCON. &quot;Single file now and by the numbers, we\ndon&#39;t have a second time for this one.&quot;\n\nThe others nodded as they fell in step and began to move.\n\nThe ground for TUSCON quickly sloped down as once again he made his\nway. As it was once before all communication systems were down and\neven IFF sensors were muffled as parts of them required a low level\nform of radio transmission, if only passive a one. There was no way to\ntransmit data on radio wave.\n\nAs he moved the cave was lit by glowing phosphorescent rocks of some\nsort sitting in the roof of the cave, their lights creating an odd\nscintillating color as they bounced off some of the more reflective\nsurfaces of other stones.\n\nAhead of him the cave tunnel he was in continued to drop and oddly\nenough his sensor range was actually getting smaller and shorter as he\nmoved. His senses worked just fine, but radar and sonar were getting\nshorter and shorter pings as if something was interfering.\n\nHowever he was beginning to pick up a low level hum.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
