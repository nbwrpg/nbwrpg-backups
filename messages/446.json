She nodded to Cyber Claw then turned \nto Teltoli, and smiled.*\n\nCarnage: &quot; Now, let&#39;s get you home.&quot;\n\n*Teltoli eyed Cyber Claw but sighed, she really had no choice but to trust \nthis new bot. She nodded and launched herself into the air, she beat her \nwings and caught a thermal. Teltoli made sure that she kept a distance away \nfrom Cyber Claw, just to be safe!\nCarnage sighed and transformed into her Beast Mode, if this clone could get \nher to the Maximal base then she could leave Teltoli in good hands and go \noff to give Megatron a piece of her mind!\nShe looked up and opened her com-link to Cyber Claw...*\n\n&quot;Glad to see that you changed your mind, obviously we share more then the \npassion to rip Megatron&#39;s head from his body.&quot;\n\n* Carnage began to run towards the direction that she knew the Maximal base \nlied in, she sighed. There was so much that she could tell Cyber Claw about \nthe horrors of her childhood, about how her own body had been altered \nthrough torture that was meant to discipline. Her vertebral spikes for one, \nshe had not been born with them.\nIt was unfair that a clone, let alone a bot even had to put up with the same \ntorture.\nCarnage thought, perhaps this bot was just alone or misunderstood.\nShe sighed, the least she could do was let Cyber Claw know her name.\nCarnage reopened her com-link...*\n\n&quot; The name&#39;s...Carnage.*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
