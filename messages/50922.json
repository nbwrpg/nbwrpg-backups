I have been in the group for a bit now, and just \ndeciding when to come in.  I am a long time TF fan, since way back in \nG1 days.  Also, I broke into PBeM role playing about a year ago, and \nit&#39;s one of my hobbies.  Anyway, I have finally made my decision.  \nDue to being a former WCW(a wrestling company) in 1996, I have \ndecided I will join the New World Order.  I will make characters for \nother groups soon though.  Seeing as how they like to base their \ncharacters on wrestlers, I will stick with the trend.  I&#39;m not sure \nhow many characters we are allowed to have, but it looks like some \npeople have a small handful, so I will just start off with three.  \nSavage, Wrath and Crush, if you will.\n\n\n"}}
