He was more damaged then \nshe, but he was the one carrying Jackle. When the ship crashed, alot of the \ncrew was destroyed on impact. They were the only survivours.\n    &quot;Come on...I think were in range now to contact Commander Hell Beast. \nLets try.&quot; She ordered, making herslef the unofficial leader of the threesome.\n    Marine dropped Jackle. He was the biggest of the three. Also the \nstrongest. The turtle bot picked up and communicator and turned it on. \n&quot;Commander Hell Beast, this is Lt. Marine of Predacon Black Opp&#39;s. We are 24 \nkilometers away from your position to the west, and badly damaged. Please \nsend an escourt to pick us up.&quot;\n    Pheniox nodded and plopped down in the snow. He would get the message, \nand they would be rescued.\n\n    Hell Beast couldnt have been more surprized. He ordered Aquarious to take \na shuttle with a CR chamber to thier location. His original team was all \nhere...he felt so much more the Predacon Commander of the past.\n\n"}}
