Other times the head would still be functioning (in\n&gt; one case\n&gt; &gt; waspinators body got trash compacted and another TOTALLY dis-\n&gt; assembled) and\n&gt; &gt; be able to direct parts of the body to do whatever (ie waspinators\n&gt; head\n&gt; &gt; crawling around by being attached to the wrist of a hand)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Basically even without a head Inferno/warhead aren&#39;t going to die,\n&gt; dunno\n&gt; &gt; where you guys got this silly notion stasis lock = death for bots.\n&gt; Remember\n&gt; &gt; on the show Black arachnia went into extreme stasis lock and shut\n&gt; &gt; down....they tossed her in the CR chamber and she woke up (it was\n&gt; the big\n&gt; &gt; romeo/juliet speech episode done by silverbolt). However again the\n&gt; degree of\n&gt; &gt; damage a bot can take before they die varied. WAspinator could be\n&gt; utterly\n&gt; &gt; torn apart yet drag himself around to a CR chamber...dinobot gets\n&gt; beat on\n&gt; &gt; for a day and literally dies.\n&gt; OOC:\n&gt; I think Dinobot died because of the cybervenom, first from\n&gt; Taranchulus then from Quickstrike. But what part do you need to bring\n&gt; to the CR chambor to heal them?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
