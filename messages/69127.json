I h=\r\nave my own business to run as well as a lot \nof other RL things to deal wit=\r\nh. I&#39;m a mighty busy woman. However, I \nalways take the time to deal with a=\r\nll my Online accounts. If I joined \nsomething, I make a commitment to at le=\r\nast be a part of it even if it \nis notification of others. Only time I real=\r\nly wasn&#39;t able to do any \nof this was when I had no power due to storms or =\r\nwhen the flooding \nhere happened back in June which generally took a LOT of=\r\n my time. But \nat least I made an effort to let folks know I hadn&#39;t forgott=\r\nen about \nthem and tried to stay in communication with them. It&#39;s generally=\r\n \nbeing curteous to the other person. I hate being a b****, but that&#39;s \none=\r\n thing that annoys me when I&#39;m left in the dark. Cause honestly, \nI&#39;ve bett=\r\ner things to do than to constantly check online here. Not \nwhen I have tons=\r\n of paperwork to deal with. So, please, Robert... \ndon&#39;t take offense. I&#39;m =\r\njust letting know where I stand. \n\nAnd likewise with everyone else. if I am=\r\n unable to be around, I will \npost something OOC. If I don&#39;t post a thing, =\r\nthen you know something \nis wrong with me. Guaranteed. \n\nOk, my rant is ove=\r\nr with. \nI REALLY want to have some fun with the lot of ye. And do greatly =\r\n\nlook forward to it. Truly and sincerely. \n\n\n~Lady B\n\n\n"}}
