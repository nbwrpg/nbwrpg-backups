I do remember the last thing before you though, \nMegatron,\n&gt; Waspinator, Terrasaur and I were in this ship&quot; as he says that he \nturns to\n&gt; see the ship that was shredded by Tigerhawk&#39;s arrival &quot;but it wasnt \nin\n&gt; ruins, anyways Megatron had just finally finished of that slagging \nwaste of\n&gt; fur Optimus Primal, and the alien planet smasher, when an incoming \nquantum\n&gt; surge knocke me into Terrasaur and into the lava&quot; then thoughtfully\n&gt; Scorponok looks around &quot; I had this strange felling in me as if I \nwas\n&gt; changing, but I never died.
