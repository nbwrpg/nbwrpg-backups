And \nfor this whole no OOC messages thing, it does take up alot of space, \nbut I still think that if you combine them with a post, than it would \nbe alot less jumked-up space. As for the whole new RPG thing, it will \nwork out great with my chars. Vulois&#39; whole mission is to get back to \nCybertron to save everyone from a huge nebula. In a few months Vulois \nwill join this RPG, and that&#39;s when the nebula will come.)\n\nFliq was about to turn to the Ark, when Bronco stirred and got up.

He screamed.\n\n&quot;Somebody.....somebody, please get him off of me......I can hold on \nmuch longer.....&quot;\n\nFliq went into stasis lock as Bronco contiuned his relentless attack.\n\n\n"}}
