Sinister ground his teeth,\nmaking pieces of his teeth fly everywhere.\n\n&quot;No dentist would work on his teeth!&quot; Sinesis joked to Dark Mouse. Sinister\ndidn&#39;t trust Dark Mouse, so he kept his sword by his side at all times.\nSinesis elboed Dark Mouse a few times, not hard, but just nudges to get her\nattention. Sinesis laughed and pointed at Sinister.\n\n&quot;Aren&#39;t siblings just boobs?&quot; Sinesis said. Sinister was swiping at a bee,\ntrying to catch it. Sinister transformed to Beast Mode and laughed as the\nbee landed on a flower.\n\n&quot;Bees eat flowers!
