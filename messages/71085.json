In the\n&gt; &gt; midsts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the wav=\r\ne, he picks up a blip. He detects the intruder inside, and\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n that wave, pinpoints his location. Yet, he wasn&#39;t about to tell anyone\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;d be up to next. With transmission still underway, he appr=\r\noaches the\n&gt; &gt; ark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calmly, with an alert stride to his walk. The on=\r\nly one who would know\n&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;d be up to, would be Legacy.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Legacy, my sonar systems have picked up the intruder. =\r\nI know of\n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; location and I&#39;m very sure I can keep up with him=\r\n, if I continue to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transmit. Can you give me access into the Ark at=\r\n this time?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;One moment.&quot; Le=\r\ngacy replied over the radio to Tuscon, and then the\n&gt; &gt; front\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; door =\r\nto the Ark began to slowly slide open. &quot;You should have complete\n&gt; &gt; access=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the Ark, as does everyone else.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Tuscon =\r\nmoved forward though low energy reserve alarm signals began\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ngo off in Tuson&#39;s head. His wounds, his own energy loss over his trip\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finally beginning to catch up with him. While his wounds were b=\r\nound so\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaked no further energy, he had yet to get to a rec=\r\nharging chamber,\n&gt; &gt; and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tremendous amounts of energy that he w=\r\nas putting out to maintain his\n&gt; &gt; wave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was further depleting his a=\r\nlready low energy reserves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Owww.. That wave is really hurting my relays.. W=\r\nait a sec, my\n&gt; &gt; radars\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are picking up activity all over the place=\r\n. We need ta amplify that\n&gt; &gt; wave of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yours.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Tucson looks down to her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m at full power alr=\r\neady Straight Shot. Unless of course, Legacy\n&gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rig up an ampl=\r\nifier within the Ark to supplement my sonar attack.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ll ask. Legacy, this is S=\r\ntraight Shot, I&#39;m asking a favor on\n&gt; &gt; Tucsons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behalf. His waves a=\r\nre strong enough to pick up enemy forces in wide\n&gt; &gt; range,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but he =\r\nwants to take it up a notch and see if he can immobilize them at\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; further range. Kind of put them in a stall for now. Can you set up an\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; amplifier signal to merge with Tucson&#39;s sonar system? It would be\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; greatly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appreciated.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Legacy&#39;s cold voice can be heard over Tuscon&#39;s radio, &quot;Many of the\n&gt; &gt; A=\r\nrk&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; systems are also being affected by the wave you are transmitti=\r\nng. At\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment Perceptor and I are minimizing the damage by =\r\nreallocating power\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down systems to the few that are still =\r\nrunning. I have no resources\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; available to comply with your request.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Outside the Ark, Nigh=\r\nt Shift catches something on his radar, and\n&gt; &gt; begins\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to pick up a=\r\n little speed, buzzing a bit ahead of Kup, like a hunting\n&gt; &gt; dog\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; f=\r\nixated on it&#39;s target.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Hello, I got somethn&#39;! IT&#39;=\r\nS A PRED SIGNATURE! Ohhh yeah, we&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; far from our targets K=\r\nup, I can feel &#39;em!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rat Trap too, senses them.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;He&#39;s right! I got the pred signature and it&#39;s locked&#39;=\r\nn loaded!\n&gt; &gt; Ohhh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wheels was right! He was right! They&#39;re still he=\r\nre!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rat Trap gets a hold of Rodimus and the others=\r\n at the Ark.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;This is Rat Trap ta base! Ya won&#39;t be=\r\nlieve it, but Wheels was\n&gt; &gt; right on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the money this time! They&#39;re =\r\nout here, and I bet they&#39;re around the\n&gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parameters too! Ke=\r\nep your sensors out for &#39;em, &#39;cause ya never know\n&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those cr=\r\neeps are gonna be up to.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Back at the Ark, outside,=\r\n Tucson holds for word, but with sonars at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full blast, he picks up =\r\nactivity happening all around the Ark. He\n&gt; &gt; narrows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his optics da=\r\nngerously.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Ohh, so that&#39;s it? Hide and seek... Be=\r\nen there, done that a\n&gt; &gt; million\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times. Signal&#39;s faint, but I know=\r\n you&#39;re out there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Keep in mind, it was=\r\n ONLY the intruder inside the Ark who&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; stealth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shielding went =\r\ndown. Blackrazor has an active shield that was disrupted\n&gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tus=\r\ncon&#39;s wave. The Sweep&#39;s stealth is of a different sort and at the\n&gt; &gt; momen=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is unaffected by it. However that is water under the bridge with\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; unfolding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; As the Maximals creep forward in an attempt to locate the Predacons,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Hydras chooses this moment to attack!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ATTACK TH=\r\nE MAXIMALS!!!!!&quot;Hydras yelled &quot;dont touch the ark but\n&gt; &gt; ATTACK\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TH=\r\nE MAXIMALS!!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Six sweeps fly into the air=\r\n, followed by their leader Scourge! As\n&gt; &gt; soon as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they leave the v=\r\nicinity of Hydras, the Predacon leader looses the\n&gt; &gt; advantage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of =\r\ntheir stealth and immediately begins showing up on Maximal radar\n&gt; &gt; screen=\r\ns!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However the sweeps still maintain their stealth, and only those =\r\nwho can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically see them are aware of them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWith a viciousness all their own, they begin to open fire on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ma=\r\nximals!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tuscon receives a call from Legacy, &quot;Tuscon, I =\r\nam receiving readings\n&gt; &gt; of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single Predacon in your area, his IF=\r\nF signal identifying him as\n&gt; &gt; Hydras.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although there was a certa=\r\nin level of urgency in his voice, Legacy was\n&gt; &gt; still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calm and res=\r\nerved as he made his tranmission.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nack inside the Ark the intruder frowned as he realized that his bomb\n&gt; &gt; ha=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not gone off. With a whispered curse he continued to try to adapt=\r\n his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stealth shielding to Tuscon&#39;s wave. With a worried look he beg=\r\nan to run\n&gt; &gt; down\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hall, if he couldn&#39;t sneak out, he would BLA=\r\nST his way out!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
