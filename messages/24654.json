He&#39;d lost a hold of his rifle, but \ngot a giant fist around Oblitertron&#39;s neck, squeezing as hard as he could \nwhile his other fist started socking his opponent in the a forehead \nrepeatedly.\n\n---\n\nDark Wolf turned away from the smoldering remains of the missile launcher he \nhad destroyed (in previous post), and raised an arm, a bolt of laser energy \nerupting from the palm of his hand at Silverbolt, the Maximal&#39;s movement \ncatching his attention.\n\n---\n\nSixshot tried to maneuver, firing three optic blasts, only one intercepting \nan oncoming missile, the other of Sky Lynx&#39;s missile exploding against his \nchest, sending him flipping backwards in the sky.  He cursed, regaining his \nhover, and fired off three blasts from both of his hypersonic concussion \nblasters at Sky Lynx.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch watched Beeline for a moment as it intercepted the missiles.  He \nran to the left as hard as he could, the charges missing him, but three shots \nstriking him in the right shoulder.  He raised both arms, launching two \nenergy-signature seeking missilesf rom his left pincher at Torca, and another \ntwo at Ratchet from the other.\n\n---\n\nInjector raised his stinger, hovering in his beast mode, firing down two \nstinger missiles at Grimmler.\n\n---\n\nManterror raised his left arm, firing off four ion disks, intercepting the \noncoming missile with one and five shots with the second, the two others \ngoing for Ratchet.\n\nThe ten shots struck Manterror&#39;s armored exo-skeleton and he let out a \nbarrage of curses, lowering his right arm and firing off three ion disks down \nat Chordate.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee flew down, avoiding eight shots and a tusk missile, the rest of the \nshots sent him spinning through the air.\n\n---\n\n\n"}}
