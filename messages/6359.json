She ran past a few \nlakes and stopped at one.  It had a little snow on the edges of the \nlake.  The water looked cool and clear.  She ran up the shore line \nand dove in.  She felt the cold water against her skin.  See swam \nalong the shore enjoying the outdoors again.  This was her element.  \nThis was her place.  She felt at home here.  She walked out of the \nlake and shook herself off.  She layed down in the sun on a soft \npatch of grass.  She looked up at the sky and realixed it had been a \nwhile since she checked in.  She opened up her commlink.\n\n&quot;Hey Quickstike, Wish you were here.  This place is great.  The \nscenery is beautiful here.  Kind of makes one glad to be functional. \nI&#39;ll return back to base shortly.&quot; She closed her link and relaxed in \nthe grass.  This was the matrix out here.\n\n\n"}}
