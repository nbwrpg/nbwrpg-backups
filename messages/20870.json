He was just a little more concerned about\na hole in his chest and the mech fluid he&#39;d lost in the battle with Slayer.\n\nVeratis stepped back at Ice&#39;s first movement toward him. He was but a morsel\nto her now, Her thoughts came to him and he saw the truth about her\nfeelings. he extended a hand and patted her on the top of the head. &quot;No harm\nwas done this time, the virus was contained on time.&quot; he turned back to the\nscans &quot;Until we get the virus entirely out of your system you&#39;re still under\nquarentine, the only contact you should have is with me or Lunarpine.&quot; He\nknew that if her control over her telepathic abilities was that fragile\nshe&#39;d know the reasons behind it.\n\nLunarpine grinned a devilish grin at her thoughts to him. She didn&#39;t have to\ntell him her fealings for him, he suspected they hadn&#39;t changed. &quot;I know\nWing me too.&quot; he said leaving Veratis out of the loop.\n\nVeratis studied the makeup of the DNA strands. She was a bear, there was no\nsign of the Owl DNA. Then it hit him like a brick, the DNA strands were\nintertwined around her techno core. &quot;Try and transform and see what\nhappens.&quot; He told her as he tried to put together the last couple pieces of\nher existence. If his hypothesis (OOH Big word.) was correct there was more\nto her than meets the eye.(Little transformers pun intended.)\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, November 14, 2000 6:03 AM\nSubject: Re: Ice\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked down at Lunarpine. She had a slight smile slip across her\n&gt; he face. She cold still read his mind even though he tried to hide\n&gt; his thoughts. She was pleased that he liked her new form.\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked at Veratis as he scanned her. She ws glad that the virus\n&gt; wasn&#39;t going to kill her or get her killed. &quot;That is good news. But\n&gt; what happens now?&quot;\n&gt; She read his thoughts and the smile on her face dissappeared. She\n&gt; could read the anger in his mind. She lower her body down and changed\n&gt; into full bear mode. She took a step closer to Veratis. She put her\n&gt; thoughts in his head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t think that I was hurting\n&gt; you. I was more afraid of what Lunarpine thought and didn&#39;t want to\n&gt; face that. I didn&#39;t think I could spread the virus as I was. I didn&#39;t\n&gt; know it could have the effect that it could have. Or that it was\n&gt; putting anything it touched in jeopardy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She nuzzled her huge head against Veratis shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I\n&gt; won&#39;t do it again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She turned and faced Lunarpine. She smiled again and filled his head\n&gt; with thought of how much she cared for him and how much she had\n&gt; missed him.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
