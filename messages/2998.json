I do agree with Inferno, though, the whole council should\ndecide\n&gt; before booting someone.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thecode, Inferno, JP, and KSLawdogg, if you guys could tell me when you\nare\n&gt; available for a chat session, we could meet and give Thecode the benefit\nof a\n&gt; doubt, and perhaps let him and us explain a few things.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thecode, if you could send me an email about who exactly I did nothing\nabout\n&gt; that moded, I&#39;ll see if I missed something or if you have the wrong\n&gt; definition of moding.\n&gt;\n&gt; And finally, please send further arguments over private email, no one\nwants\n&gt; to read tons of arguments.
