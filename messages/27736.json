There was something important\n&gt;about it, but he couldn&#39;t quite remember.\n\nWildrider transforms after this miss, and Cannonballs, as he was expecting\nthe missile fire. He lands on the ground, and is propelled forward by the\nexplosion of the missiles beside him. He gets up, and whatever was left of\nhis dangeling wires from his head had fallen off. His exostructure was\nrippe apart, all that was left was the insides of the right side, his left\nside of his face was not badly damaged. He starts to laugh deeply, and\nturns into a cackle. &quot;Ha ha ha, me a Predacon, thats rich Maximal, ha ha,&quot;\nwith that he raises his scatterblaster rifle and pulls the trigger twice,\nsending 16 lasers a ripping the air where Prowl is.\n\n\n\n"}}
