Cyclonus always\nmade an excellent second in command. Ever uncomfortable with command\nof his own, he was content to follow orders and implement the will of\nothers. Such was his strength as well as his weakness in the ever\ncomplex web of trecherey and lies amidst the Predacons. &quot;I will send\nout a few drones to investigate.&quot;\n\nWith that Cyclonus closed the connection, leaving Hydras to his own\nthoughts. He was the leader of the only active faction of the\nPredacons at the moment, or was he? With Cryotek active and who knows\nwho else, there could be other games afoot.\n\nIn the meantime the Maximals seemed just as tired and banged up as he\nand his team were and both would need time to recover. The minions\nappeared to be in a battle with the Insectile creatures, but without\nmore information it would be difficult to move foward.\n\nWhat would Hydras do? What would be next? Only time would tell.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
