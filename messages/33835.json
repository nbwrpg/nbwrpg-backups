As you can see, I&#39;m just not getting enough time to \n&gt; check and reply! I&#39;m so sorry, I wish I could stay, but I can&#39;t. :(\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone that wants to keep in touch with me, my mail is \n&gt; steph_teltoli@y... , Yahoo Messenger ID: steph_teltoli, and I \n&gt; welcome anyone that wants to have a chat. Just tell me who you are, \n&gt; and that you&#39;re from the NBW. *_*\n&gt; \n&gt; Carnage, I&#39;m sorry I have to leave right in the middle of the \n&gt; storyline, you&#39;re a great RPGer, and the time I&#39;ve had RPGing with \n&gt; you has been wonderful. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Steph Faith Geeves\n&gt; aka\n&gt; Teltoli SilverWing\n\n\n"}}
