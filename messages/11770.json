I&#39;m just \ngonna do a quick thing on Fliq and Bronco.)\n\nNow that they have Fliq&#39;s permission, they headed straight for The \nArk&#39;s scanning systems. They tried to use them, but to no avail.\n\n&quot;Damn Preds,&quot; said Bronco, &quot;I can&#39;t wait until this thing is rebuilt. \nWhat do we do now?&quot;\n\n&quot;When we scanned from the Cybertronian Fire, it said that all the \ndebris was in the next sector over. We&#39;ll just go there and cover the \narea with our short range sensors.&quot;\n\nFliq and Bronco changed to Bot mode, and took off with their jets \nblazing.)\n\n(See you all tomorrow.)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
