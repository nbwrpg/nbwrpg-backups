She slapped his hand hard and got \n&gt; loose.  She knew he could kill her if she tried to run. So for now, \n&gt; she&#39;d have to stay put in order to survive. &quot;Get your slimey claws \n&gt; off of me you...you...what ever you are. First off, you don&#39;t go \n&gt; touching me. Second, I understand I&#39;m stuck here with you and that \nI \n&gt; don&#39;t have much choice in the matter, but you can act more polite \n&gt; about giving me orders. Third, what are you going to do with me now \n&gt; that you have me? I mean, I can&#39;t run, you&#39;ll just kill me. So what \n&gt; are your intentions?&quot; as she put her sidearm away. For now, she&#39;d \n&gt; have to go along with things and just wait for  her chance to \nescape.\n&gt; &quot;Now then, what are we going to do? Go back to your little hole in \n&gt; the sewer and stay there untill you give who ever your demands?&quot;Her \n&gt; tone wasn&#39;t sarcastic, but more matter of fact.  She wasn&#39;t rude in \n&gt; her tone or posture. But she was assertive. She showed no fear \n&gt; towards them at all. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Attilla/Luzbel:::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Attilla and Luzbel looked each other a nano, after that Luzbel \n&gt; &gt; said &quot;We haven&#39;t attacked you , other bots have done it... now&quot; \n&gt; said \n&gt; &gt; the male while he grabbed her &quot;Now listen me you&#39;re prisioner of \n&gt; war, \n&gt; &gt; unless you want end roasted you will come with us!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Panzer::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She started to wake up. Her vision was returning.  She slowly \n&gt; &gt; opened \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her optics and notice two very large figures standing over \nher.  \n&gt; &gt; She \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rubbed her optics with her paws and looked at them again. Her \n&gt; &gt; vision \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was clear now. She saw the two dragons from earlier.  She tried \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; jump to her feet, but her hind feet didn&#39;t want to co-operate. \n&gt; She \n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformed into bot mode and stood there, on shakey legs. &quot;Who \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you? Why did you attack me? I didn&#39;t attack you? You know, that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t very nice.&quot;  She drew her sidearm, but kept it at her \n&gt; side. \n&gt; &gt; If \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they hadn&#39;t killed her by now, then they must have a reason for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; keeping her alive. &quot;Would you please explain to me what is \ngoing \n&gt; &gt; on?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
