Someone really dosent like me up there!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Winter. Hell Beast hated the season of white death as much as he hated \nthe Maximals. The white shroud would envelop the valley, and that was not \ngood news for any Predacon, be they in the Predacons, Newcomers, or Megatrons \nlittle group. With the dark colored armor the predacons had, they would surly \nstick out in the whiteness of nature in the next few months. And, the snow \nwas beginning to fall. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast, his breath visable, turned to adress his crew ::: Predacons, \nit is with deep remorse that I must say we are in Winter. It is going to be \nalot harder for us, because of our armor color. But I think we will endure \nwhatever comes our way.\n\n::: Gremlin ::: Yes, but we failed at the destruction of the Ark.\n\n::: Hell Beast :: No, if we had destroyed it the Autobots would have lost the \nwar. The Decepticons would then rule the Galaxy, and Predacons would have \nnever been created.\n\n::: Transanulas ::: Those sound like the words of a traitor.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Youre one to talk about traitors, achacnid. \n\n::: Transanulas looked down and said nothing. The other predacons listened. \n:::\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: So, what do we do now?\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: We continue as we did before. Nothing changes.\n\n::: Marine, in the back holding a sack, ::: Do you want the materials we \nsalvaged from the maximal base?\n\n::: Hell Beast nodded. Marine spilled the contents onto a table. They were \nnothing really they could use at all. But Hell Beast commended Maine for his \nintuition to get them. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast turned to look out the window, the meeting was at an end. All \nthe Predacons returned to there posts, except for Jackle and Inferno who went \nout on a perimiter patrol. :::\n\n::: Standing there, thinking about Vuloris, Battera, Megatron, Koga Shuko. \n...Hell Beast sighed. Things would get better. After all, his fraction was \nthe biggest and most powerful in the Beast Wars. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Pheniox, bring Rat Trap up here. I have an idea.\n\n::: pheniox nodded, and after a brief pause she brought the vermine to the \nbridge. ::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Ah, Rat Trap. Looking well.\n\n::: Rat Trap ::: Ah, can it Hell Beast! You havent fed me in days!\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Yes, well....can you blame me?\n\n::: Rat Trap ::: Yeah, for alot of stuff!\n\n::: Hell Beast smiled ::: I have a job for you. If you refuse, you will die. \nIf you accept, I will grant you your freedom. Clear?\n\n::: Rat Trap ::: Im listening...\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Excellent.\n\n"}}
