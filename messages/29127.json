The \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;reason none of my characters have Bios is because for a while me \r\n&gt;and friend \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;have be reading books on animation and studying it in my art \r\n&gt;class. So I \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;going to Try ((Try Being the key word)) to animate a 3 minute \r\n&gt;short for my \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;bios one for each characters. But to see if this works the way I \r\n&gt;want I&#39;m \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;going to try to do a general music video for the Neo Beast Wars. \r\n&gt;This is \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;long time taking process which means with day school, night \r\n&gt;school, work, \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;and mischief, the two of us will be working on this in our spare \r\n&gt;time. But \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;before I start I want to ask permission to animate and draw your \r\n&gt;characters \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;for the general Music Video. The characters that get picked we \r\n&gt;will be \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;listed and we are picking by the Bios you posted on the Web site \r\n&gt;if your bio \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;reads well enough to draw you then your character may get picked. \r\n&gt;If you \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;don&#39;t want to be drawn say so and you will not be picked. \r\n&gt;Characters that \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;are drawn will be drawn in a drawn by Gene in Transformers G1 \r\n&gt;style or with \r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;strong anime edge by me.

And \r\n&gt;they are:\r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; Maximal Blossom\r\n&gt;&gt; gender:female\r\n&gt;&gt; alternate form:pink and white car \r\n&gt;&gt; Backround:She and Dinobot have known each other since they were \r\n&gt;kids and in the process fallen in love with other. They now have a \r\n&gt;son name Buddy.She&#39;s also good friends with Rinox,and Optimus. \r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; Maximal Butterfreak\r\n&gt;&gt; gender:female\r\n&gt;&gt; beast form:butterfly\r\n&gt;&gt; Backround:Dinobots &#39;sister&#39;. When Butterfreak was still a protoform \r\n&gt;her original spark faded &#39;cause of a mis-fired blast. Dinobot was the \r\n&gt;only one on the scene,and so he willing gave half his spark to her. \r\n&gt;So the two are in a way brother and sister because of the spark they \r\n&gt;now share.   \r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; Maximal Buddy \r\n&gt;&gt; gender:male\r\n&gt;&gt; Alternate form(s):grey and white car and helicopter\r\n&gt;&gt; backround:the off spring of Blossom and Dinobot. Buddy wanted a bat \r\n&gt;beast form but his father disagreed saying it would be too dagerous. \r\n&gt;Born during the beast wars (first season near the end) Buddy wanted \r\n&gt;at first to grow up like any other normal kid but was stuck where he \r\n&gt;was. After the beast wars had ended Buddy got the chance to know \r\n&gt;Cybertron,unlike earth which he calls home.\r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; ________________________________________________________________\r\n&gt;&gt; Get Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at \r\n&gt;http://www.AnimeNation.com\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
