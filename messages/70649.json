He sighs, while directing his head over to Rodimus, while \n&gt; listening to see if he&#39;s coming around as well.  He slowly draws his right \n&gt; knee up onto the bench, and then slowly sits up.  The voices a mere \n&gt; memory, as he tries to concentrate on Rodimus&#39;s condition.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; R - Rodimus?  Stanton? How - how is Rodimus?  Did - it work?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap watches from the other side, looking rather excited as does \n&gt; Straight Shot.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Guys, guys, look!  Rodimus is commn&#39; around!  He did it, Wheels did it!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot smiles as she points to inside the room, with Elita still in \n&gt; her arms.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;See?!  What&#39;d I tell ya?!  Look, your dad&#39;s comming around, he&#39;s gonna be \n&gt; okay!  WHOOHOO!  Way ta go Tucson!\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift jumps for joy as does Quickstride.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Now that&#39;s what I&#39;m talkn&#39; about!  I knew he&#39;d kick aft in there!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks into the room, and notices an expression on Tucson&#39;s \n&gt; face, which gave an air of concern.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmm, Tucson still looks as if he&#39;s prepared to fend something off, like \n&gt; as if something may be watching him..  I wonder what it is...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Power continued to flow from Tuscon into the figure beneath him, a\n&gt;&gt; pulsing flow of energy moving from Tuscon&#39;s chest, down his arm and\n&gt;&gt; into the figure on the bed. Meanwhile the insectoids continued thier\n&gt;&gt; relentless attacks, on both Vestige and Tuscon!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Suddenly the door slammed open, the sounds of buzzing insects could be\n&gt;&gt; heard, as a swarm of them flew into the room. Blue ones, red ones,\n&gt;&gt; silver ones, black ones, each of all shapes and sizes. However in the\n&gt;&gt; midst of that a female walked, the insects flying around her obeying\n&gt;&gt; her and yet giving her a wide birth at the same time. She was tall,\n&gt;&gt; taller than any of the insects, her movements smooth and flowing. She\n&gt;&gt; was black and red with large insect like wings sitting on her back,\n&gt;&gt; designed something like seeker wings on a transformer. Her limbs were\n&gt;&gt; supple and femine, but there was no mistaking the strength and power\n&gt;&gt; that was held within them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Tuscon, Tuscon.&quot; She said as she turned her gaze upon him, her eyes\n&gt;&gt; were crimson multifaceted eyes. &quot;You believe that your leader was the\n&gt;&gt; what we wanted?&quot; She tilted her head, &quot;Ahh&quot; she said as just just\n&gt;&gt; understanding it, &quot;It is that singular thinking you have.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; She chuckled as she looked over at Vesige, the insects were swarming\n&gt;&gt; over him, causing him to falter under thier onslaught. &quot;You have\n&gt;&gt; gotten this far only because I we have allowed it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At a gesture from the larger female the swarm of insects that were\n&gt;&gt; attacking Tuscon and Vestige leaped into the air and began to hover\n&gt;&gt; aroud the cieling of the room as the room itself began to warp and\n&gt;&gt; spin as if the very world around him was changing, altering, or\n&gt;&gt; perhaps returning to normal.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The last whisper of a voice, &quot;Perhaps you gave us exactly what we\n&gt;&gt; wanted . . . &quot; then there is laughter.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The world goes black . . . and then Tuscon is aware of the medbay as\n&gt;&gt; his systems come back online. He can hear the voice of Santon, &quot;It is\n&gt;&gt; done. Rodimus is comming out of it and Tuscon&#39;s systems are comming\n&gt;&gt; back to normal levels. We have done it, they are safe.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A quiet laughter plays in Tuscon&#39;s head, or perhaps just a memeory of\n&gt;&gt; it, but it falls silent as the real world beckons for Tuscon&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; attention.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
