He knew by now the shields were up and the shots wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; hurt anything but if there were other attackers it was up to him to prove\n&gt; his faith by defending the Maximals in any way he could.   His distraction\n&gt; nearly cost him as Zoes shots struck him.(What type of weapon is Zoe\n&gt; useing?) The scales on his face protected him but the shots reminded him of\n&gt; what the cost of distraction was.\n&gt; \n&gt; He lifted his mighty foot and stomped on the ground sending a shockwave in\n&gt; the direction of  Zoe and Slayer. His whole body was a physical weapon and\n&gt; he knew how to use it well.\n&gt; \n&gt; He&#39;d lied about being a leader but knew that the faction at the Black\n&gt; Fortress was behind his decision for the sideing between the two teams\n&gt; &quot;MegaTON to Black Fortress, I need any available Predacons to assist me at\n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire.&quot; he shouted. In his mind he could handle this alone,\n&gt; he was after all the &quot;invincible&quot; fighting machine. He just figured that a\n&gt; show of force from the Predacon side would be more convincing.\n\n\n"}}
