Just her\n&gt;&gt; &gt; luck, she was not far from where Quickstride was, as he was with Legacy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and the others.  Quickstride lifts his head and spots her.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Guys, look, it&#39;s another Autobot.  She looks like she&#39;s waving toward\n&gt;&gt; &gt; me.

I&#39;ll remain \n&gt;&gt; &gt; put\n&gt;&gt; &gt; so you can find me easilly.  Legacy has just located me along with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor.  I&#39;m in one piece, but I&#39;m not so sure about Rodimus. I hope\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he&#39;s all right.  Anyway, I&#39;ll look forward to a little down time with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as soon as this is behind us.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He turns to Perceptor.  Again more gears turn.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Perceptor, I&#39;d like to thank you for your help and your willingness \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; return where you felt most intimidated.  To me, that is not the way of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Predacon, but the valor of a Maximal.  And no, it&#39;s NOT an insult, it&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; complement.  I&#39;m sorry you have not had the experience of having a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; formal\n&gt;&gt; &gt; complement, and I promise you what I say I mean.  Your help is valuable\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and I can not put a price on it.  Speaking of your help...  Did - you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; by\n&gt;&gt; &gt; chance create the shell program?  If so, perhaps you know of a way to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; reverse it.  Anything you can help us we&#39;ll gladly take, and we will\n&gt;&gt; &gt; protect you if need be, from Hydras.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson Prime unlike Hydras, didn&#39;t need the power of oppression to win \n&gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; comrades, and he knew that he couldn&#39;t force anyone to do anything they\n&gt;&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t want to do.  And he always expected himself to return the favors\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that are given to him. Perceptor&#39;s help was valuable he knew he&#39;d have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; quite a debt to pay to him once everything was said and done.  He holds\n&gt;&gt; &gt; out a hand to Perceptor.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Legacy, please note that from this day forth, although Perceptor is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; of a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; different faction, he has helped us greatly.  Therefore, we must always\n&gt;&gt; &gt; keep our doors open to him if he needs our help and our protection. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Enemy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or not, he has risked his own spark to help us and that is something we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; must all honor.  Perceptor, I would personaly like to shake your hand \n&gt;&gt; &gt; in a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; show of peace and Neutrality.  You&#39;ve earned my respect as a comrade \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; shown us selflessness and the ability to cooperate with the opposite\n&gt;&gt; &gt; faction.  The choice is yours Perceptor, and I respect what you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; choose.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Who: LEGACY, Tuscon, Perceptor\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor looking to Legacy said, &quot;i dont know you, but I&#39;m going to \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; go\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; down\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and bring the primes back, or at least one of them&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Legacy nodded, &quot;Come, we must do all that we can to secure the primes.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Without them then all is lost.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is a short moment before Legacy and hopefully Perceptor are able to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; catch up with Tuscon at the edge of the tunnel.
