That movie came along about 12 years maybe \n&gt;longer than that crappy show BM. Come to think of it, BW was nothing \n&gt;impressive either. You lack any real sense whatsoever and should be put \n&gt;down...\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: dewboy30816\n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, March 04, 2002 7:39 AM\n&gt;   Subject: OOC: G1\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   I figure after 2 days of not posting I can have 1 OOC.  Yesterday I\n&gt;   got Transformers the movie and after watching it 3 times I came to\n&gt;   the conclusion IT&#39;S AN INSULT TO EVERYTHING BM AND BW!  The Autos and\n&gt;   Decepts were suppose to be smarter than there descendants, but\n&gt;   Megatron had to use the Trgan Horse tactic that&#39;s been outdated for\n&gt;   2,000 years on Earth and the Decepts should have radioed a need for\n&gt;   repairs and NOT stood close to the hole.  How dumb can they be.  Also\n&gt;   the Autos tried to get the Dinobots in the shuttle first even though\n&gt;   they were the strongest fighters and should have been last.  In fact\n&gt;   I think they were the only ones doing in damage in the later fight\n&gt;   against Unicron.  And why were they so happy at the end when they had\n&gt;   used up the Matrix&#39;s energy and basically destroyed their own version\n&gt;   of heaven?  I prefer BM standards where the Matrix is everywhere and\n&gt;   eternal.  And just to be annoying can I have Spike?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
