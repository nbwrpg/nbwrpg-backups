Just saying to the \nguard that he was going to stay.\nShe almost smiled at the thought.\nThen he would get carted away towards his parents with the appointment to \nplay later.\n\nDiana only shook her head and sighed. Boys!\nShe took another step towards Rion and then another until she was standing \nright in front of him. Looking right into his eyes, hers hard as when she \nuse to play fight with him.\nDiana lifted a paw and poked it at Rions stomach.*\n\n&quot; You look like a giant pin cushen.
