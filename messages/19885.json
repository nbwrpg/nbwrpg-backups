He looked around. He saw the entire outside of \nthe ark had been completed. He saw Magnus come up behind him. He must have \nfollowed him and not noticed. He looked at Magnus. &quot;Let us finish our plans.&quot; \nhe said it quitly enough so no one else would here. He then turned back to \nthe working bots..&quot;Bots here me. The alliance is destroying time. He showed a \nhologram which was huge. It showed a picture of the alliance leader Zardus(if \nthis is wrong correct me.) &quot;If we allow them to continue my world will be \ndestroyed. In my future there is peace and prosperty. Until there was a time \nripe. Suddenly  all the maximals turned into drones. Mindless metal \nskeletons. I was able to escape through a vortex. If zardus is allowed to \nlive then we shall all parish. Including everyone on cybertron.&quot;\n  He sent a coded mess to destructor.. &quot;I have told them. I do not know if \nthey bielieve me. But hopefully they will aid us.&quot;\n   Magnus looked at the hologram. &quot;Maximals...Destrons Predacons...let us \njoin forces once more. So that we may save all of time.&quot;\n\n"}}
