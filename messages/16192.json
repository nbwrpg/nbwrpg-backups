I&#39;ll leave flying to those with \nthe wings. I prefer to keep my paws on the ground. But then again, A \nbird&#39;s eye view is helpfull once in a while.&quot; She smiled and \nchuckled. &quot;I take it you won&#39;t be returning to where ever you just \ncame from soon?&quot; She couln&#39;e help but have a little fun, even at his \nexpence.  After the loss of two bots and the fight they just had, she \nneeded to laugh.  She smiled,&quot;But, on another note, we need to get \nour comrads back. I want to help.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Ok, I just read 150 emails, so if I get something wrong here, \nplease correct \n&gt; me.\n&gt; \n&gt; And Skulletron, its not ok. You can&#39;t post people being knocked \nout, even for \n&gt; a little while. I don&#39;t know if you wanna rewrite your post, but \nI&#39;m going to \n&gt; respond to before Skulletron ran off. And if you&#39;re going to run \nout of the \n&gt; bridge, let me respond before you go somewhere in one post. The \ndefences \n&gt; would be firing at you continuoustly.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/Ramulus/Shredder/Striker/Proto/Chordate/Smokescreen::\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside the room, Zardus turns to Sickle, frowning when he saw it \nas a fish.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m Zardus, Alliance commander,&quot; he says to the fish, wondering if \nhis \n&gt; circuits were breaking down, &quot;You are?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus looks down at SnowCat, grinning as color returns to his \nface.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You try flying up there, see how you feel!&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Shredder walks out of the Destron bace and looks at the two new \nbots, \n&gt; sighing. This was getting on his nerves, the constant interruptions.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Who are you two?&quot; he asks, looking them over.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Striker paced back and forth in his cell. He had to warn the \nMaximals, he \n&gt; just had to! He growls, trying to think of a way. He hoped that \nRamulus would \n&gt; be smart enough to see through the trap, and to be carefull.\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker frowns at the door, starting to think of something.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Proto looks up at Necromancer. Proto&#39;s chest was melted and leaking \nmechfluid \n&gt; at a quick rate, his left foot looked like it had been slammed with \nsomething \n&gt; big, and there was gashes all over his arms from tree branches.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey, would you mind giving me a lift too?&quot; he asks. He hated \nrequesting \n&gt; help, but there was no way he&#39;d make it 1000 miles back to base.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Chordate throws himself to the left, Skulletron&#39;s shot shooting off \nhis ear \n&gt; and leaving a leaking, melted spot in his cranium. He jumps \nforward, feeling \n&gt; a bit dizzy, and spins around, firing two shots at Skulletron.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Smokescreen enters the bridge, instantly pulling out his gun as he \nsees the \n&gt; battle. He runs inside, firing at Skulletron.\n\n\n"}}
