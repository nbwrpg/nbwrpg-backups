Is this all his race was,? based on his limited \nknowledge of war and survival Lunarpine knew that one thing is true. \nIn war there are no friends, only interests. If this is true then why \nwas she being so nice?\n\nLunarpine took a quick glance behind him, will his new home be this \nway or is there more to his type of beings than he realized.\n\n&quot;I guess you should call for a ride, Your friends wouldn&#39;t know my \nvoice.&quot;Lets go.....&quot;Lunarpine trembled at the thought of leaving this \nplace for a new life in a strange land,....&quot;Home&quot;.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (Oh darn, and I was looking forward to a cruise on the Titanic.

As long as it&#39;s not aboard the Titanic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine continued to look at Shadow Wing, was it because of her\n&gt; beautiful white feathers, or because of the animal she represented.\n&gt; Either way she was out of his class. (science joke.) They shared \nthis\n&gt; world, this land, this night, and most importantly, this journey.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;tell me again Shadow Wing, why are you helping me?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
