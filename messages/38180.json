We&#39;ve changed\n&gt;the way this will run a little from last election, but it about 90% the\n&gt;same. The new council will come into effect July 2, two months\n&gt;after the first election. We require the following things from\n&gt;canidates and supporters:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) If you wish to run:\n&gt;\tYou must find three people who support your running for\n&gt;\tcouncil.\n&gt;\n&gt;2) Email the council with those three supporters. Copy-paste the\n&gt;\tfollowing into the send field:\n&gt;\n&gt;rauq@..., yanshosh@..., TMRattrap@...,\n&gt;Alloran2@...\n&gt;\n&gt;3) Make sure the people who you mark down as supporters email\n&gt;\tthe council as well saying that they support you, and anyone\n&gt;\telse that they are supporting.\n&gt;\n&gt;4) If you&#39;re running, you can only support two people. If you&#39;re not\n&gt;\trunning, you can support three people.\n&gt;\n&gt;5) If you send $20 to each current council member, we will hook\n&gt;\tyou up. =) (wellll, maybe not... but please do send us\n&gt;\tmoney!)\n&gt;\n&gt;A slight difference from last election. This time we will elect two\n&gt;new council members (instead of three). One council memeber\n&gt;(other than Yanshosh) will remain on the council. That member will\n&gt;be chosen through a second poll.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\t~NBWRPG Council\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
