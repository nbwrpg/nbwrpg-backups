He thought for a moment. &quot;Spinister, \ncontact SLugslinger and Needlenose, have them attach wires from our \nship to the Autobot ship. The cut the engine. No matter where they go \nwe will follow.  Nightmare, get all injured and in stasis lock into \nsafe compartments. We will need them. Quake, you help Nightmare.\n\nQuake turned and looked at Havotron then Nightmare and spit a drip of \noil in disgust.\n\n&quot;NOW!!!&quot; Havotron ordered.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Slugslinger also begins to sputter, his engines not roaring anymore.\n&gt; &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Caliburst asked nervously notting the energy \nmeters\n&gt; dropping. \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside Spinister looks around at the stumbling troops, then to \nHavotron\n&gt; for Direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightmare tries his best not to falter, and stay at his ready \nposition\n&gt; next to Havotron, like a model soldier. Jagged however stumbles, and\n&gt; then trips over Apeface as he lands face first, in stasis lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; Apeface also falls over, trying to grab something to stabalize, but\n&gt; fails as he falls onto his back, transforming to ape mode, as his \nhead\n&gt; detaches, and transforms into a little robot, backflipping and \nlanding.\n&gt; Spasma then turns towards the post Hook left empty. As a scientist \nhe\n&gt; was over curious at what was happening. He leapt up onto the chair, \nbut\n&gt; since he couldnt see, he then leapt to the consol, and looked at the\n&gt; readings. &quot;Sir, this isn&#39;t good, as it is our ship may stall, in\n&gt; outerspace.&quot; He says in a worried tone.\n\n\n"}}
