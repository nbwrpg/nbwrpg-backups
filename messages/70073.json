Yet he looks \nat Sco=\r\nrponok after hearing what Tucson Prime said and how he was viewing the \nsit=\r\nuation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Okay, yeah, things went South. Big dea=\r\nl, \nhappens all the time.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson then looks to =\r\nCyclonus, \nyes, he had looked as he had before he had lost his sight. It di=\r\ndn&#39;t surprise \nhim though. He had see and been through worse.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m \nsorry Cyclonus, there are no secrets to share with you=\r\n. I have not the answers \nfor the power that has been given to me, because =\r\nI myself don&#39;t know \nthem.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He lastly turns to H=\r\nydras. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Rat Trap and Quickstride pose no thre=\r\nat to you Hydras. They have \nnot entered your base, and done nothing to get=\r\n you angry. So to that question, I \nhave to say... LEAVE THEM OUT OF THIS. =\r\nI am the one who made the mistake, and \nit&#39;s me you want, not them. So, I&#39;m=\r\n here aren&#39;t I? You have me and now you have \nnothing to fear from the outs=\r\nide world, because your main threat is now in your \npossession. Think about=\r\n it, what can they do? They&#39;re no threat to you at \nall.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift nodds in agreement to his \ncommander&#39;s statement. Tuc=\r\nson looks to all his comrades before having to be \nseparated from them.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Kup, I did not intend to put \nyour spark in danger=\r\n, and for that I am deeply sorry. Stay strong my friend, \nthis isn&#39;t foreve=\r\nr. And whatever happens, happens. My heart goes out to Elita \nand one day, =\r\nhopefully, she will never have to worry about anything ever \nagain.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He puts a hand on Night Shift&#39;s \nshoulder.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Night Shift, we&#39;re going to be separated \nfrom each other=\r\n. Again, this wouldn&#39;t be happening if I hadn&#39;t ran that red \nlight. I prom=\r\nise you I will make it up to you but not sure as of how I will do \nit just =\r\nyet.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Night Shift nodds.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;Heey, it&#39;s cool, it&#39;s cool, we all mess up sometimes, like ya \nsaid. =\r\nNo worries boss bot, we&#39;ll get through this, like we always do. I&#39;ll be \nok=\r\nay, I promise.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; They shake hands as they wait t=\r\no \nbe separated from each other.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Outside the for=\r\ntress, \nRat Trap senses something is a miss when it takes far too long for =\r\nanyone to \ncome out. Quickstride looks down to him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &quot; \nQuickstride, it&#39;s been a really long time and no word from Wheels or=\r\n the others. \nSomethn&#39;s wrong.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride nodd=\r\ns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, something really stinks around here d=\r\noesn&#39;t it, and it&#39;s \nnot me this time, because I haven&#39;t had any bean pods =\r\nlately.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap swallows hard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; He told us ta \nwait out here. But he also told us that if he=\r\n didn&#39;t come out right away, ta \ncall for backup. Lord Elder, it&#39;s me, Rat =\r\nTrap. Wheels hasn&#39;t come out with the \nother guys yet, and it&#39;s been a very=\r\n long time. Something&#39;s wrong. I think we \nneed backup sir.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; His voice falters a bit, as he \nwipes off a tear with his rode=\r\nnt paw.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Aww Wheels, \nwhy&#39;dya have ta go&#39;n do th=\r\nat for? You&#39;re the only real friend I&#39;ll ever \nhave.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Quickstride could see what was happening. He \nputs his nose down to h=\r\nis rodent comrade.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Hey, \nhe&#39;ll be okay, he pro=\r\nbably ran inta a snag. He&#39;ll be fine, he&#39;s pretty buff now \nRat Trap. Don&#39;t=\r\n worry, I bet he&#39;s got somethn&#39; up his manifold. It&#39;s just gonna \ntake a wh=\r\nile, that&#39;s all.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap composes himself \nand=\r\n scrambles up onto Quickstride&#39;&lt;WBR&gt;s back.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;We =\r\n\nbetter find someplace ta hide.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride loo=\r\nks \naround and finds a bit of thick greenery near the black fortress. He tr=\r\nots \ntoward it, vanishing into the vegitation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nThis \nshould be okay for now. Well, until Hydras sends his goons out ta fin=\r\nd us which \nis probably what&#39;ll happen.... Ooohh, bean pods...&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nAgain he thinks of nothing but food and begins to munch on=\r\n the bean pods. Rat \nTrap looks onto the fortress hoping that Tucson Prime =\r\nhad a plan in place to get \neveryone out of there in one piece.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; --- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, \n&lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\nKup/Perceprtor/&lt;WBR&gt;Darkhawk/&lt;WBR&gt;Nightlight/&lt;WBR&gt;hydras&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kup looked with sandess At Rodimus and nightlight, he =\r\nhad \nfailed... miserly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; failed to his friend and Elita.

He \nlooked=\r\n at Nightshift, &quot;Is this what you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meant by get it?&quot; =\r\n\nhe said, the sarcasm thick in his voice. &quot;I think we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; got \nit then, yes we did.&quot; he chuckled at his own joke.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As all this was going on the doors slid open =\r\nand \nCyclonus stood there,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weapon drawns and optics =\r\ndarting \naround the room. The cyclonus that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stood th=\r\nere, while \nfamiliar to most, was very different from the last&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; time \nTuscon had seen him before he lost his sight. This Cyclonu=\r\ns was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; little taller and sleeker, even in his robo=\r\nt mode his lined and \nform&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bespoke speed and aerodyn=\r\namics. He seemd larger and \nmore imposing than&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when =\r\nhe last stood before him, his \narmor thicker and more resilliant&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; than when he was a \nsimple lacky for Galvatron.

He has the security \n=\r\nsection secured.&quot; He turned&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his gaze on Tuscon, &quot;We =\r\nwill \nhave to have it analyzed to see what ever&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defe=\r\nnce to it \ncan be mounted. It seemed to have a more pronounced&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \naffect on your Decepticon and predacon forces.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; OOC: The \nchanges I described are for Tuscon&#39;s benefit as well as =\r\nthose&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; who have not seen him a long while.
