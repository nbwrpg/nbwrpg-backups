A tiny drop of mech fluid \ndripped from his hand. he caught it and squeezed it as if it were one \nof his enemies. &quot;We need Slayers knowledge of the Maximals if we are \nto defeat them.&quot;\n\nA bald Eagle flew low to avoid Maximal scanners. He was close to the \nark and knew they wouldn&#39;t be happy to see him. he swooped low and \nlocated the nearly frozen Slayer in stasis lock. Slayer was missing a \nlimb as well as most of his mech fluid. Ignatius quickly transformed \nand put his arms around Slayer. he lifted the injured bots head and \nchecked it&#39;s status. The rescuer transformed and once again an eagle \nfloated above the ground. the great bird grabbed its prey and started \nflying back to the Trainers secret hideout.\n\n\n"}}
