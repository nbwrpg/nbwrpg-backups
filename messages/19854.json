The two \nattackers were impressive to watch. The Alliance obviously had some \nvery skillful adversaries. This could work to her advantage. She \ntransformed to her half Hawk mode to get a better view. her third eye \nconstantly changed to get a good look at the attackers. She found a \nspectrum which gave her a shadowy view of Inu and Koj, They flew with \ngrace and form like few she ever remembered. Her obligation told her \nto report the frequency but she had no true loyalty toward the \nalliance or it&#39;s second rate megalomaniac in charge. She just sat \nback and watched the action unfold not having any intention of \ninterfering unless the battle came to her.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; \n&gt; She walked out and stood near Zardus. &quot;How many do you think there \n&gt; are?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I hate operas.

Jumping back as the shields reactivate, Zardus, \n&gt; along \n&gt; &gt; with the autoguns, fires at the trees that manage to get through, \n&gt; ice \n&gt; &gt; and wood chunks showering him, but nothing major. He takes a step \n&gt; &gt; back to keep his balance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Behind him, Reptilica gives a pained yelp as he is hit by a large \n&gt; &gt; wood piece, sending him falling backwards into the Alliance base. \n&gt; &gt; Bloodystrike ducks behind the door as he sees the wood flying at \n&gt; him, \n&gt; &gt; evading it and watching some of it land on Reptilica. He ducks \nhis \n&gt; &gt; head out of the doorway, firing at Inu.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; DevilDuer looks up into the vent, watching Diamond slither away. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; was kinda glad she had joined, or else Vamprah might have gotten \n&gt; &gt; away.
