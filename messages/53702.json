Padding to the door, she carefully went inside \n&gt;the\n&gt;Base.\n&gt;\n&gt;Twisting around, watching the door as it closed. Her optics glanced about \n&gt;in\n&gt;the dim light. Waiting for her escort. She smirked. How familiar this was. \n&gt;A\n&gt;few times that this had happened... similar to the first time she met\n&gt;Megatron. Was at the Citadel, Megatron was meeting Gamma.\n&gt;\n&gt;Her curioustiy mounted, actually eager to meet this...
