Pacifix \nout.&quot; Pacifix pauses a moment to reflect, then stands. He looks into \nthe monitors, and frowns, &lt;Where&#39;s Crossroads, he should be done \nshowing Gesper around by now.

He&#39;s probably contacted the Shadow Destiny by \nnow.&quot; As the continue down the corridor, he shrugs, &quot;I wonder how \nFiredrill&#39;s doing.

He acts there as our \n&gt; ambassador. Being a techno-organic is being both a machine and an \n&gt; animal, but it is more than that. It is hard to explain though. I \nhall \n&gt; explain it to you later, as well as the mission. For now... (he \nenters \n&gt; the storage room) let me introduce Tankor and Melchana.\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Daemos: I understand, Pacifix. Here is our base&#39;s location. We will \n&gt; hold the shield down for your arrival.\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Gesper: I wonder if Pacifix has gotten any news from the Shadow \n&gt; Destiny. What do you think, Crossroads?\n\n\n"}}
