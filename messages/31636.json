As he fell towards first aid, one head snarled, and\nthe other spoke, &quot;We&#39;ll rip out your slagging fuel pump, and EAT IT&quot;, both\nmouths wide opend, he decended on his foe.\n\nHeadstrong got his legs taken out from under him, by the force of the shot\nto the torso. He tried to roll away from the searing blast of flame from\nHot Spot, but was not very successful. He stood up, his front all charred,\nand he pulled out his sword, and Plasma blaster. As soon as he thouched his\nsword, his figuere became hollow, and four more joined it, standing side by\nside. &quot;SNORT* Lucky shot Autobot, but you won&#39;t *Snort* do it again&quot; he\nsaid, firing three large burst of light balls from his gun.\n\nTantrum landed near Rampage, and Transformed. &quot;Here, refuel&quot; he said, as\none of his tanks opened for Rampage to dring from. While he did this he\nfired on Groove with his horns.\n\n\n\n"}}
