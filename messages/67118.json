From here it is easy for\nHydras to see that although Myrmidon may resemble an\neagle, at close range the mechanical nature of his\nform is noticable. However despite what optic sensors\nmay say, standard and long range sensors continue to\npick him up as a standard eagle of large size.\nMyrmidon flaps after Hydras, even though the booster\npack on his back gives evidence of probrably greater\npossible speeds if he chose to use them. \n\nOOC: Myrmidon resembles real animals perhaps a little\nbetter then the G1 Predacons did, and in fact he looks\nmuch like them. (It almost looks as if he was made -\nat least partially - in thier image.) His Eagle, Bull\nand Lion modes are much like Divebomb, Tantrum (Minus\nthe tanks) and Razorclaw, and his robot mode is\nsomething like Predaking, although modified slightly\nand scaled down to size. While in animal forms he\n&#39;appears&#39; to sensors to be just an animal of that\ntype, although anyone getting a close enough look\ncould obviously see the difference. \n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n \n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nCatch up on fall&#39;s hot new shows on Yahoo!
