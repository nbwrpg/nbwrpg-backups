The transmission Zardus had sent a while ago was being \nplayed back on one of the other terminals.\n\nKluster frowns, listening to it. He tapps a few buttons, bringing up a \nscan to confirm Zardus&#39; words. There was indeed Predacon activity...\n\nHe gets up. &quot;Allright, the Maximals need to meet,&quot; he says to \nShredder, walking out of the bridge with Shredder following him. He \nactivates his comm-link, sending a transmission to all Maximals.\n\n&quot;All Maximals, report to the Cybertronian Fire conference room \nimmediately. There are some issues that need to be discussed.&quot;\n\nKluster enters the conference room, Shredder motioning for Ramjet to \nfollow and then entering behind him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm recieves Kluster&#39;s transmission as he is walking out of \nSpears&#39; room.\n\n&quot;Want to go report to the meeting first? Or should we get this over \nwith?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRex looks around as he hears Kluster&#39;s transmission, looking at \nWhistler.\n\n&quot;Kluster wants the Maximals to meet in the conference room. You&#39;re a \nMaximal, right?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProto and Grimmler get out of their CR chambers, setting of for the \nconference room.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Spears::\n&gt; \n&gt; She nods and wal\n\n\n"}}
