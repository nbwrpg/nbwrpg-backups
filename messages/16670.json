Man, a giant robot.\n\n       Astral flew up into the air, as did Fenox.\n\n       &quot;Oblitertron, I&#39;ve faced gestalts like you before, you scum!!!!!\nWe&#39;ll take you down!!!!&quot; Then, Fenox tapped Astral&#39;s shoulder.  He turned.\n\n      &quot;Ah.....Zardus, is it???  Alliance commander???  You think you can\nbeat us????  Well, let me tell you something.  I didn&#39;t come here, to fight.\nI came here, to carry out an experiment.  But if I must fight, then, so help\nme Matrix, I&#39;ll fight.  As long as I, Admiral of the Lavacons, Astral, live,\nNOBODY IS TAKING ME DOWN!!!!  AND NOT TONIGHT!!!!!!&quot; He said, and then\nnodded at everybody.\n\n     Fenox sent a transmission to the others on the ground.\n\n      &quot;Ok, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s the only way, team!!!&quot; He said.\n\n    They all replied with a positive answer and then, everyone said all\ntogether, &quot;LAVA AND FIRE UNITE!!!!!!!!!!  BURN!!!!!!  LET THE DARKNESS\nCONTROL THE HEAT!!!!&quot; Then, suddenly, things started happening.\n\n       The Lavacons&#39; bodies started changing a bit(ok, a lot).  Their optics\nwent redder, and not just firey red, the normal way, they were evillish red.\nAnd, all of their bodies changed from burning reds and oranges, to evil,\nevil, blacks and reds.  An evil grin spread across each one&#39;s face, being\nshown only by the fire in each one&#39;s mouth.\n\n      Astral, or, what was Astral, said, &quot;HHHHAAAHHHHAAAA!!!!!!!\nMUAHAHA!!!!  Oblitertron.....Oh, stupid Oblitertron!!!!  Stupid\nZardus!!!!!!!  AHAH!!!  Now, you&#39;ve caused us to reach one of our superior\nforms!!!!!  HAHAHA!!!!!!  Now, we are the Dark Lavacons!!!!!\nHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HAAAAHAAAHAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!\nOHHAAAA!!!!!&quot; He laughed, evilishly.\n\n          &quot;Come on Dark Lavacons, while we crush these Alliance fools, we\ncan have fun at the same time!!!&quot; Astral said, laughing.\n\n      Recklessa was even more dangerous now.  She grabbed her gatling guns\nand fired around the area, burning all the trees and stuff down.\n\n       Griplash grabbed his sword, and cut through trees, destroying stuff.\n\n     Starlight cackled as she shot her crossbow everywhere, making the\nground go on fire.\n\n     Fenox fired his optic lazers at Zardus, except, being a Dark Lavacon,\nFenox didn&#39;t put any major effort into it, no feel.  Just fired it for the\nhell of destroying things.\n\n       Astral laughed so evil, as he was in the air, firing flame rockets\neverywhere in sight.\n\n        The Dark Lavacons are completely evil, the only thing they want to\ndo is destroy things, they will even shoot at eachother, the shooter not\ncaring, and the one getting hit not carring.  DESTROY is their main theme.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Skulletron::\n\n       Skulletron suddenly started to wake up.  Uggh, where was he??(He&#39;s in\na CR right???)  Ah ha, he was in a CR Chamber.  He wanted to get out, he\nbetter be careful.  He stepped out of the CR, and started running, to\nFeline&#39;s workshop(or where ever the hell she was).\n\n     He looked at Hot Rod, then at Feline.\n\n     &quot;Fe...Fe..Line......Feline........Man, am I GLAD to see you!!!  Help\nme!!!!  QUICK!!!!  What do I do....These Maxi&#39;s will be all over me now, I\nran as fast as I possibly could to get here, to hide.  Cover me??&quot; Then,\nSkulletron looked at Hot Rod again.\n\n     &quot;Wow, Hot Rod, lookin&#39; good!!!&quot; He commented.\n\n\n"}}
