Naturally Hotrod couldn&#39;t\nstop them, but even though Drillbit would die Arcee\nwould barely be breathing and she would escape with\nHotrod yatta yatta yatta and they would live happily\never after, except for being hunted by Maximal and\nPredicon alike for the rest of the rpg, the end, but I\nguess that can&#39;t happen now.\n\n--- Jonathan &lt;jhogan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hot Rod quickly left, running out of the base, and\n&gt; transforming to car mode. He headed for the battle\n&gt; at maximum speed.\n&gt; \n&gt; {Talos & Grimlock}\n&gt; \n&gt;     The mammoth and robotic t-rex hadn&#39;t gotten too\n&gt; far yet, both their alternate forms built to be\n&gt; rather hardy and strong, not overly quick. It wasn&#39;t\n&gt; any big suprise to see the dust cloud that heralded\n&gt; Hot Rod&#39;s movements gaining on them. Focusing on the\n&gt; sight ahead Talos hoped Sunhawk had at least taken a\n&gt; few bots to keep Megatron busy.\n&gt; \n&gt; {Nightshade}\n&gt; \n&gt;     The fem bot sat back on her bunk estimating Hot\n&gt; Rod&#39;s old quickness and the layout of the maximal\n&gt; ship. Once she was sure he had enough time to exit\n&gt; the ship she extended her arm, flipping up a part of\n&gt; her wrist exposing a small series of tools. Moving\n&gt; to the door she began working the seal to free\n&gt; herself from her quarters. Sorry Hot Rod, she\n&gt; thought, I had your ideals once and could trust in\n&gt; others good side...but that was a long time ago.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Shaking her head Nightshade  grimaced picking\n&gt; the magnetic seal on the door quietly...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo!
