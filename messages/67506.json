Keeping as safe distance he stared at\n&gt; Cyclonus with stange mix of rage and serenity in his eyes. \n&gt; \n&gt; Remus was speaking calmly and firmly : Then ... WHaT? yOu wilL.. gIVe\n&gt; ...ThE... MATRIX... tO uniCroN... aNd BE... PrAISEd... LiKE... thE\n&gt; gOOd... DoGs... THat you... ArE? dO YOU... reaLLy... Think... He\n&gt; is...\n&gt; GoINg to...

YOU... \n&gt; \n&gt; Remus waited for there reaction ready for any possibility.\n\nAs Remus approached where Cyclonus stood, it was a strange scene that\npresented itself - Sweeps swirled in the skies and others emerged out\nof a deep cave. There is the smell of newly turned earth as if some\ndigging has been done recently. It is also obvious that Cyclonus is\nbenefiting from the Matrix, his optics glowing as he radiated some new\npower, and most horrifying of all, there was no hint of the earlier\ndamage he had recieved in his battle with Rodimus.  \n\nCyclonus stood before five cybertronian forms, warriors from their\nbuild and weapon distribution.

Silence would be your ally now.&quot;\n\n\nAs Cyclonus spoke several Sweeps in robot mode stepped up to Remus from\nthe sides and rear, weapons trained on him, they reach out to hold him\nin place. At the same time Cyclonus turned away from Remus to gaze upon\nthe forms before him. \n\n�I did not allow your presence here to bandy useless words with you.�\nCyclonus� voice is clear and powerful as he directed his words to\nRemus, �No doubt you have reported our position to your comrades, but\nit is of no consequence, they will arrive too late.� Cyclonus gestured\nat the warriors before him, �However you will be able to report this to\nyour superiors. Let them know the gift they have given us.�\n\nCyclonus stood still for a moment as more Sweeps stepped to Remus� side\nto hold him in place. Then as if in an exhalation Cyclonus began\nbathing each of the forms in a scintillating cacophony of power,\nvaguely reminiscent of the power so recently shared between he and\nRodimus, but darker and more sinister.
