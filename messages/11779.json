She had been there all this \ntime and no one had threadened her like the wolverine had.  he was \nabout to kill her.  She now felt threatened by him being in the same \nbase as she.  She felt she had to leave the base and very soon, or it \ncould cost her her life. She looked down and didn&#39;t want to make eye \ncontact with this maximal. She had no friends on the base save \nFirearm.  She couldn&#39;t expect him to neglect his duties to just watch \nover her.  She knew her time here was about to end, one way or \nanother.\n\n\n"}}
