My name is Wheeljack, and I came here to join the\nAlliance.  The one named Nemesis Enforcer let me in.  I know your names\nbecause I have a gadget in my arm that can give me a list of my comrades\nonly.  I built it in myself.  Anyway, this weapon, the inflator, is a deadly\nthing to have, best used in the hands of someone with expertise\nmarksmanship.  It is too dangerous to put in the hands of a badly skilled\nbot.  It fires energy that inflates anything touched.  You must shoot it\nmultiple times, and eventually they will burst open.  Or, I added a\nsecondary function that fires a large amount of the energy, and either\ninstantly explodes the victim, or puts them at the point where one more shot\nwill blow them to pieces, or get popped by a pointy object.  I made this\nthing also by myself!!!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
