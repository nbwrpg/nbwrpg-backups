The problem is that the pod enters at\n&gt; a high degree and starts to burn up beyond any pods melting point. The\n&gt; computers fry and somehow the pod survived but badly burnt. As it\n&gt; hurled toward Earth somewhere in the Western Rockies of North America.\n&gt; It streaked through the sky as a hurling ball of fire and landed\n&gt; strike in the middle of a dense forest destroying everything around it\n&gt; for miles. The bots stasis pod went in search for a body but because\n&gt; of the extensive damages it entered Emergency Life Mode and found the\n&gt; closest thing for a body........\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
