However, with this passenger on his nose, he paid her vocal \nwords no mind.\nThis had to be, not the most uncomfortable situation but the most strange \nand unexpected he had ever lived through. Shaking his head momentarily to \nsee if it had loosened its hold enough to be moved off. But it seemed to be \nno use and he snarled in frustration.\nOf all the things, which must occur, something that he would never recall \nfor fear of losing face and dishonor himself by it&#39;s telling.\nDinobot continued to glare at the black ball before lowing his head enough \nso that his transmetal claws might get a chance to grab a hold of it and \nremove it, with or without injury. He still didn&#39;t know if it was alive or \nnot. But it was coming off either way as far as his concerns went.\nHe snarled as he heard Tavatron&#39;s voice become closer to him, snapping his \nhead up towards her and growling deeply with growing aggression. He was \nembarrassed by this situation and a known way to cover that up was an \nattitude. This was foolish and of all the transformers in the world it had \nto occur to him?!\nDinobot shifted and snarled, his tail thrashing slightly behind him as he \nglared at Tavatron, it obvious from his expression that if she laughed she \njust might get a nice swipe up side the head. To him this was NOT funny in \nthe slightest and the fast this fur ball was removed the sooner he could \nground it into the dust and regain his posture.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
