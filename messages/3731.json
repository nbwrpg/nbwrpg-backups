He dropped Dark Mouse and screamed. He went to drag himself. \nHe was so close to the base. He reached towards Dark Mouse. He rolled to his \nknees in great pain. He lifted his left foot, trying to stand, but up fell \nback onto his chest.\n\nHe looked back to see Ramulus and Ramhorn. He groaned, then commanded, \n&quot;Auto-guns--&quot; He ducked as he saw three bright balls of fire from a auto-gun \nfire at Ramhorn.\n\nHe rolled his head. &quot;Get &#39;er inside!&quot; he said to Double Punch. &quot;Don&#39;t stall, \ndon&#39;t let them Maxie&#39;s get &#39;er.&quot; After that, he lifted his chest. &quot;Beast \nmode.&quot; He transformed. His lumbering claws were a mess, one twisted and both \nsinged. &quot;Flank me, dang it!&quot; he called to Scorponok. &quot;Flank me!&quot; He \nskittered to the ramp of the ship.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
