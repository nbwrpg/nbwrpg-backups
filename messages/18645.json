He looks down as he sees an \nexplosion, his eyes widening as he sees it was Feline blowing up.\n\n&quot;Kill that bot!&quot; he growls into his comm-link, pointing at Grenade as he \nfires two dozen shots at him, reaching into a storage compartment for another \ngun.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike flies up, missiles slamming into the tree behind him. He turns \naway from Sharpedge as he hears Zardus&#39; command, aiming at Grenade and firing \ntwo dozen shots at him, pulling out another gun, holding it in his other arm \nand aiming it as well.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica dives, getting out of the way of most of the shots, a few hitting \nhim, making dents and cracks in his armor.\n\nHe looks down at Grenade as he hears Zardus&#39; orders, firing two missiles and \n20 shots down at him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc dives, stray shots passing him as he flies at Grenade on Zardus&#39; \norders, sending a bomb and a barrauge of rapid laser shots flying at the bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRepressor flies forward, getting a lock on Grenade. He didn&#39;t know why Zardus \nwanted that bot particularly dead, but he didn&#39;t really care.\n\nTwo missiles fly out at Grenade, along with dozens of machine gun shots.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer walks out of the Alliance base, nearly jumping as he hears an \nexplosion nearby, along with a hissing sound as something hits the shields. \nHe spins halfway around, seeing the shuttle. Taking out his gun, he joggs up \nto it, his scanners searching it for any translife.\n\nHe gets closer to the shuttle, looking at it. He wasn&#39;t really fond of the \nshuttle display that was beginning to form around the Alliance base, this one \nnow there in addition to the one from the Iron Fist.\n\n"}}
