I dunno if I&#39;m right but, without the Protohumans, there w=\r\nouldn&#39;t be an ecosystem.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He then st=\r\nops, and spots a Protohuman fishing in a far part of the pool.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Psst, over there, there&#39;s one now. Looks like =\r\nhe&#39;s gathering food. Hmm, I wonder how these fishies taste... If they eat t=\r\nhem, then they gotta be good.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He pu=\r\nts his paw into the water to snatch a minnow but comes up with a crayfish p=\r\ninching his left paw.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Ow, ow, owww=\r\nw.... What the scrap?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He shakes it =\r\nback into the pool.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Didn&#39;t see tha=\r\nt Comm&#39;n. Sorry, my bad. Okay this time I am gonna &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; catc=\r\nh a fish.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He quietly puts his paw i=\r\nn the water and this time he scores himself a fish.  He sniffs it and then =\r\ngathers it into his jaws, munching it like a true feline.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Mmm, not bad. I can see why they fish for these. Th=\r\ney taste good and there&#39;s lots of them.&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; He then remains still to watch the Protohuman fishing. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Local artist who specializes in illustration, usi=\r\nng traditional and digital media. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n also specialize in hand made crafts.
