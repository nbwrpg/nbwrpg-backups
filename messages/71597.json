In the Beast Wars\ncartoon some characters were bigger than others. I think Basic was\nabout 5 feet tall or so while Ultra topped out at about 10.5 feet\ntall. No one is really tall in Beast Wars except compared to each\nother. Yes, Unicron is an obvious exception :)\n\nPrimal stood at about 10 feet tall and Megatron stood at 10.5 Leo\nPrime was about 10 feet as well. Cheetor at about 7.5 and Rat Trap at\nabout 5. There is a video game that gives stats for a few characters\nthat I am going by as well as some of the web sites.\n\nSo the imported characters can have heights based on that. I would\nassume that Tuscon, Rodimus and Hydras would all be about the same\nheight as their counter parts. Tuscon and Rodimus should be about the\nsame as Leo Prime and Optimus Primal, while Hydras should be about the\nsame height as Megatron.\n\nAny ways it gives us something to think about :)\n\n- Preston\n\n\n\nOn 8/10/11, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well as Cyclonus show me, the current rules said that the character should\n&gt; be Predacon/maximal Sinze, so why not to shrink all toons to a\n&gt; minimal/maximal sinze with some exceptions.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Sandy Panico\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 09, 2011 8:06 PM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: How tall is your character?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Everything you&#39;ve got there makes sense to me, nice job\n&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Aug 9, 2011, at 8:02 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   In an effort to streamline a bit and to bring us more in line with the\n&gt;   predominantly Beast Wars style of the game that is a question I am\n&gt;   putting out there.\n&gt;\n&gt;   WHAT SIZE IS YOUR CCHARACTER\n&gt;\n&gt;   Beast Wars pretty much had the sizes: Basic, Deluxe, Mega, Ultra\n&gt;\n&gt;   For the characters that are part of the Beast Wars line we already can\n&gt;   get the sizes, but for those who have made up characters or who have\n&gt;   imported them from other realms, how big are they?\n&gt;\n&gt;   Yeah I know that sizes tended to fluxuate somewhat, but I am looking\n&gt;   to get somewhat standard if I can.\n&gt;\n&gt;   To help I have put a list in the files section listing the sizes of\n&gt;   different ones. I know it may not list EVERY character, but it hits\n&gt;   most. And generally a mega is bigger than a Deluxe and a Deluxe bigger\n&gt;   than a basic although there may be some exceptions. I do believe Rat\n&gt;   Trap made it to Deluxe as a TM, but never got any taller.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I can start:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Rodimus Prime, being a Prime should be the same size as Optimus which\n&gt;   would make him an Ultra.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Cyclonus I would make the same size, since at times he was drawn as\n&gt;   big or even bigger than Galvatron and comparable to Ultra Magnus. So\n&gt;   he would be leader sized.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Scourge is somewhat smaller and would be a Mega\n&gt;   Deepstryke would be a mega\n&gt;   Phobia and Black Razor would be Deluxes.\n&gt;   Lord Elder, as he is based on K9 would be a Deluxe.\n&gt;\n&gt;   As suggestions:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Tuscon = Ultra\n&gt;   Hydras = Ultra\n&gt;   Nightshift = Mega or more likely Deluxe\n&gt;   Straight Shot = Basic\n&gt;   Quickstride = Deluxe\n&gt;\n&gt;   What are your thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt;   - Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
