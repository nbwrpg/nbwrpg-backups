She couldn&#39;t\n&gt; help it.  She stared at the Dracona.  She mumbled something about how\n&gt; this looked so familiar.  She turned and went to seek Scorponok&#39;s\n&gt; help.  He knew the answers to the questions brewing in her mind.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Find long lost high school friends:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/7080/13/_/_/_/964119918/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
