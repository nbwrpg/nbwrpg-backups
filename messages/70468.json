If anything else he was there for support. He had hoped by doing \n&gt;&gt; so, Rodimus&#39;s condition may change gradually. Yet he had time to respond \n&gt;&gt; to Perceptor and Kup as they were leaving.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Do what you can to help Nightlight. I&#39;ll stay with Rodimus to be sure \n&gt;&gt; he remains stable.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In his larger body frame, it was a bit hard for him to make himself \n&gt;&gt; comfortable yet, to him comfort was the last thing on his mind. He knew \n&gt;&gt; he needed Rodimus not only as a comrade, but as a friend. It was the one \n&gt;&gt; thing that Hydras didn&#39;t have and a power he&#39;d never experience. The \n&gt;&gt; power of friendship.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Hopefully you can hear me Rodimus. I promise you as an Autobot and a \n&gt;&gt; Prime, that I will NEVER give up fighting unitl the day comes when the \n&gt;&gt; wars finally cease. After the wars, restoration is in order. But if we&#39;re \n&gt;&gt; going to achieve these goals, the leaders of the Autobots and the \n&gt;&gt; Maximals must come together as a whole and only then can we restore order \n&gt;&gt; on this planet. There&#39;s just one problem, you&#39;ve slipped away on us, \n&gt;&gt; unintentionally of course, but without you we&#39;re not as powerful as we \n&gt;&gt; can be. But with you we can give this planet what it desperately needs, \n&gt;&gt; new hope and the promise of new life. Never give up your drive to restore \n&gt;&gt; order, for it&#39;s a drive that we all share and treasure and a drive that \n&gt;&gt; no evil force can ever bring down.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Tuscon entered the chamber where Rodimus Prime is laying he can\n&gt; also see the familliar form of  Lagacy as he stood to the side of\n&gt; Rodimus as he looked over several of the sensors that were oriented on\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; prone form lying on the bed.\n&gt;\n&gt; However also in the room was Bump who while smaller than Legacy  but\n&gt; he looked no less formidable in his durably contructed crimson colored\n&gt; armor and silver-grey chest plate plating. His beast mode was\n&gt; probrably some sort of reptile, an armadillo perhaps judging from\n&gt; hints around his form. He glanced up as Tuscon entered a scalpel in\n&gt; his hand as it hummed with power.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also was the rather large form of Santon the Maximal Doctor. He stood\n&gt; as tall as the Massive Legacy, his armor was thick and heavy and was\n&gt; colored primarilly in various shades of greys although his chest\n&gt; thights and biceps were red. As with many Maximals it was easy to\n&gt; determine his beast mode was that of an elephant from the large tusks\n&gt; that extended from his helm.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He sits up trying to get in a comfortable position.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Then there&#39;s this little matter of Hydras.. Unfortunately he reminds me \n&gt;&gt; of good old Megatron and Galvitron... If we&#39;re going to overthrow him, we \n&gt;&gt; have to work together. That won&#39;t be easy, but I know we can do it. If \n&gt;&gt; anyone should be wanting to thwart him, it&#39;s you. He did the most \n&gt;&gt; injustice to you, and by right, you have presidence as to how his fate \n&gt;&gt; should ultimately wind up. Then, Cyclonus. I&#39;ll deal with him. Little by \n&gt;&gt; little we should free this planet. And little by little we can watch it \n&gt;&gt; flourish.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon looked up, it was obvious that he was not happy with yet\n&gt; another intrusion on what could turn out to be an incredibly delicate\n&gt; operation. &quot;Tuscon Prime.&quot; Santon said, his voice carrying the full\n&gt; weight of acting chief medical officer, &quot;I will have to ask you and\n&gt; any others who wish to watch to wait in the observation room.&quot; Santon\n&gt; pointed to the room easily visable on the other side of clear\n&gt; plexiglass. He looked back at Rodimus as he heard a beep from one of\n&gt; the sensors.\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy spoke up from his position, &quot;It would appear that his life\n&gt; signs are begining to decline, if we are to begin, now would be the\n&gt; best time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bump glanced looked at the others in the area his look obvious, leave\n&gt; so that they could begin.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;TAG&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
