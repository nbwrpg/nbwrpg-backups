Just like with\n&gt; hellbeast there is nothing he can do to me besides kill me and make story\n&gt; even greater cause I believe in myself and believe in my dreams and that&#39;s\n&gt; all that really matters. When I do go it alone as long as I live everyday\nof\n&gt; my life to the fullest then there really is happy ever after out there for\n&gt; me. ::equips weapons:: But now I have to prove that. Can you help\ntigerhawk\n&gt; and Grimlock.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tigerhawk: ::drops to one knee:: i can&#39;t take much more of this grimlock\n&gt; hurry up and waste him\n&gt;\n&gt; Liono: Leaves a Note in Keys chamber I&#39;m going to take to hellbeast one\nlast\n&gt; time ::Beastmode exits maximals base heading towards the preds main base::\n&gt; I&#39;m going to beat him no elements no tricks the council will not be please\nif\n&gt; I hold up to him it will disgrace him in front of them.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Remember four years of good friends, bad clothes, explosive chemistry\n&gt; experiments.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4051/10/_/_/_/958615631/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
