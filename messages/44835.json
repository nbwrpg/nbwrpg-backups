Also, mixing \n&gt; Transformers with Animorphs wouldn&#39;t be a good idea.\n&gt;  It would be fun \n&gt; probably, but Transformers would kick their arses\n&gt; easy.  Oh, Andalite&#39;s have \n&gt; tailblades.  Heh, let&#39;s see how well they do against\n&gt; several feet thick of \n&gt; Cybertronian armor and a big laser rifle.)\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
