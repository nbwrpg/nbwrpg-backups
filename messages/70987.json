Insecticon, Bruticus-X, and Iguanus moved in almost eagerly to p=\r\nick up the mighty weapons that Tuscon has dropped, while Inferno, the self =\r\nproclaimed bodyguard of Hydras watched Tuscon carefully, his optic ready to=\r\n spot treachery.\n\nQuietly a short message is sent to Tuscon, =93Tuscon.=94 =\r\nThe deep voice of Noctorro, the leader of the Maximal Fuzors can be heard, =\r\n=93My team is here. Rodimus sent us to aid you. None too soon it would seem=\r\n.=94 Noctorro=92s words are grim, a soldier=92s humor in them. =93We await =\r\nyour signal.=94\n\nAt the same time Injector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, and Quic=\r\nkstrike move to do the same with Kup, Nightshift, Straightshot, Talon and t=\r\nhe others. Skyshadow, the leader of the Predacon Fuzors just watches with a=\r\n gloating look on his face, it is almost as if he wants them to attack and =\r\nkeep the battle going.\n\nMeanwhile Phobia and several sweeps keep an eye on =\r\nthings from the air, while Terrorsaur and Waspinator landed, ready to help =\r\nout as needed.\n\nAt the same time Legacy processed Tuscon=92s command for hi=\r\nm to leave the Ark. There was a long pause, and then the temporal guardian=\r\n=92s cold voice comes across the channel, =93I will not comply with your co=\r\nmmand. I have been tasked with the . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;\n\nDeepstryke transmits =\r\nto Hydras, =93Hydras. I am picking up an encrypted transmissions to and fro=\r\nm Tuscon, he is attempting to communicate with the others. I am generating =\r\na radio dampening field now in this area. Only the Predacons will be able t=\r\no transmit.=94\n\n\nMeanwhile inside the Black Tower:\n\nWindlord=92s attempt to=\r\n open fire on the Scourge was met with a measure of futility. Scourge just =\r\nstepped away from the opening that Windlord fired out from and let the shot=\r\ns go harmlessly into a bulkhead, scorching it only slightly.\n\nHowever that =\r\nslight amount of time allowed Windlord and Rat Trap time to scurry further =\r\ninto their crawl space and find an interior bulkhead to hide behind.\n\n=93Sc=\r\nrap!=94 Scourge=92s voice said from the outside. There was a pause and then=\r\n, =93Cyclonus, they have fled into the walls.=94\n\nThere was another pause, =\r\nand then Scourge chuckled, =93Of course. I will be ready for them.=94\n\nFrom=\r\n further inside the crawl space the sounds of chittering could be heard, an=\r\nd then several groups of optics could be seen in the distance coming toward=\r\ns Rat Trap and Windlord. In the darkness their shapes could only be barely =\r\nmade out, but they looked like black metallic spiders, Hydras=92 wall guard=\r\nians!\n\n(OOC: Rat Trap may recognize them from last time. Also keep in mind =\r\nthat Rat Trap and Windlord should be in beast mode. They would have to be t=\r\no fit inside the crawl space. In the toon the Beast Modes did not have offe=\r\nnsive weaponry, except for teeth and claws)\n\nOutside the Ark:\n\nRodimus was =\r\npositioned in a small grove of trees, ducking down behind several large roc=\r\nks. He gives Quickstride a quizzical look as the equine Maximal sniffed him=\r\n.\n\n(OOC: Quickstride=92s sniff reveals nothing wrong.)\n\nHe was about to let=\r\n Quickstride in on what he had planned when Uproar appeared. Rodimus appear=\r\ns taken aback though by Uproar=92s conclusion that it was Legacy that had t=\r\nurned evil. While Rodimus didn=92t know that much about Legacy, having only=\r\n seen him briefly while being rescued and repaired, there was nothing to hi=\r\nnt that this attack was Legacy=92s doing. He was about to say something whe=\r\nn Uproar ran towards the Ark to be let in . . .\n\n&gt;KRACK POW&lt;  \n\nAs Uproar r=\r\nan towards the Ark, what seemed like a round bolt of lightening appeared, s=\r\nending Uproar flying several yards through the air, to land heavily on the =\r\nground! Evidently the Ark shielding was still in place, and it was not allo=\r\nwing anyone in.\n\nRodimus frowned, =93Uproar! Get over here! If we are going=\r\n to get back in, then we need to work together. That shield is supposed to =\r\nhold off all the Predacon forces. We are not going to get in by brute force=\r\n.=94\n\nAs Rodimus talked three other Maximals seemed to almost materialize o=\r\nut of the underbrush, such was their skills at camouflage.\n\nThe first was W=\r\ning Caliber, (See: http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Skywarp ) an old Maximal stratagi=\r\nst and military teacher, who from the brownish feathers along his frame tur=\r\nned into some sort of eagle.  \n\nThe next was Leo II, (http://en.academic.ru=\r\n/pictures/enwiki/76/Lioconvoy_gathering.jpg ) the adopted son of Lio Convoy=\r\n, and who looked much like him, and who had obviously picked up many of his=\r\n mannerisms. His body was powerfully built and heavily armored. He looked t=\r\no turn into a lion.  \n\nThe third was Ramulus (http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ramulu=\r\ns) who had like the others been on patrol for a while, surveying the area a=\r\nnd trying to keep it free from Predacon invasion.\n\nThey also come up beside=\r\n Rodimus, Leo II, obviously the leader of the other two, =93What now sir?=\r\n=94\n\nRodimus looked at Quickstride and Uproar, =93Well let=92s get out of s=\r\night, and then we can discuss it.=94\n\nMeanwhile Inside the Ark:\n\nPerceptor =\r\nhad received Tuscon=92s message and sent attempted to send a message to Lor=\r\nd elder, however at the moment there was no answer from the elder Maximal.\n=\r\n\nAt the same time Legacy was still standing in the med lab along with the o=\r\nthers, his single optic glowing in the darkness.\n\n=93It would seem that Nig=\r\nhtlight=92s vital systems are being held at minimal levels.=94 Legacy said =\r\nas he directed his gaze to the wall panel nearest Nightlight. A small light=\r\n blinked, indicating her spark was still online, but that there was not eno=\r\nugh power to reboot her systems.\n\nHe turned to look at the others, his face=\r\n glowing in the darkness, lit by his own optic, and the glowing bar on his =\r\nchest plate. He raised his right hand in the air, the one with the arm cann=\r\non on it and begin to emit light from it, much like a flash light or a beac=\r\non so that the room was illuminated. He casually looked around, =93Perhaps =\r\nwe could locate a back out or reserve power system . . . =93\n\nLegacy paused=\r\n as Tuscon=92s message came in. He turned to look at Santon, Bump and Perce=\r\nptor, a look of disbelief momentarily flashing across his face.\n\nLegacy str=\r\naightened as his cold voice comes across the channel, =93I will not comply =\r\nwith your command. I have been tasked with  . . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;  . . . the =\r\nprotection of the Ark as well as that of the Matrix. I will not knowingly l=\r\neave the Ark undefended or the Matrix in the hands of another.=94\n\nLegacy t=\r\nurned to look at his console as he understoodf what happened. Communication=\r\ns had been cut part way through his message. He turned to look at the other=\r\ns, his single optic cold, =93It is illogical to believe that I would attemp=\r\nt to harm the Ark or allow anyone to take it from the Maximals.=94\n\n(TAG)\n\n=\r\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_000B_01CBB9D5.380E3960\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n\n/* start of attachment style */\n=\r\n       .ygrp-photo-title{\n         clear: both;\n         font-size: smaller=\r\n;\n         height: 15px;\n         overflow: hidden;\n         text-align: ce=\r\nnter;\n         width: 75px;\n       }\n       div.ygrp-photo{\n         backgr=\r\nound-position: center;\n         background-repeat: no-repeat;\n         back=\r\nground-color: white;\n         border: 1px solid black;\n         height: 62p=\r\nx;\n         width: 62px;\n       }\n\n       div.photo-title \n         a,\n    =\r\n     div.photo-title a:active,\n         div.photo-title a:hover,\n         d=\r\niv.photo-title a:visited {\n           text-decoration: none; \n       }\n\n   =\r\n    div.attach-table div.attach-row {\n         clear: both;\n       }\n\n     =\r\n  div.attach-table div.attach-row div {\n         float: left;\n         /* m=\r\nargin: 2px;*/\n       }\n\n       p {\n         clear: both;\n         padding: =\r\n15px 0 3px 0;\n\t overflow: hidden;\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file {\n        =\r\n width: 30px;\n         valign: middle;\n       }\n       div.attach-table div=\r\n.attach-row div div a {\n         text-decoration: none;\n       }\n\n       di=\r\nv.attach-table div.attach-row div div span {\n         font-weight: normal;\n=\r\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file-title {\n         font-weight: bold;\n       }=\r\n\n /* end of attachment style */\n        --&gt;\n        &lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=\r\n=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp {\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n  font-family: A=\r\nrial;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp hr {\n  border: 1px =\r\nsolid #d8d8d8;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {\n  color: #628c2a;\n  font-size: 85%;\n  fon=\r\nt-weight: 700;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n =\r\n margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n  padding: 0 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad p=\r\n {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a {\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: n=\r\none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Perceptor/Ku=\r\np/Windlord:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=93I have an idea to let our frien=\r\nds escape BlackFortress area... and PErhaps \nreboot Nightlight, alltough i =\r\ndont know how much of her former self is \nretained=94said&nbsp; Perceptor t=\r\no Rodimus in a heavely encripted message=94But we \nhave to let Tucson know,=\r\n what Legacy=92s sittuation really is and this has been an \nunfortunate mis=\r\nunderstanding...
