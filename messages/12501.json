(I know I&#39;m\nmodeing\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; making suggestions ooc and I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m in no hurry to see those\n&gt; two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; die just yet.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now back to the action\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine&#39;s next view is a light flashing before him, he could feel a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comfortable warmth there. All around him he could see visions of\n&gt; warriors,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals Predacons, And a few symbols he didn&#39;t recognize. He&#39;d heard\n\n&gt; bots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speak of this place before when they were brought back from beyond, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somehow knew where he was he just didn&#39;t know how he got there or why\nhe\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine thought his punishment for his failures would surely be the\n&gt; pit,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the clincher would be his failure to save Shadow Wing. Now he knew\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was to late. Now he knew that he&#39;d cost himself his own life for a\n&gt; &gt; worthless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gesture.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He sensed somehow that every bot around him knew his thoughts, his\n&gt; fears,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his emotions. Somehow he could sense thiers too. warriors of the\nhighest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quality, sciencebots destroyed before thier greatest achievements\ncould\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; created, Predacons who fought valiantly to save lives instead of\n&gt; &gt; extinguish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A ball of light approached him and took shape a youthfull bot, an\nimage\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t seem to belong here was now before him. Lunarpine opened his\n&gt; mouth\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speak but quickly learned it wasn&#39;t necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The new bots voice consumed him &quot;I was Piston of a group from the last\n&gt; &gt; great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; war, I was a new recruit for a unit called the Misfits of Cyberton I\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been selected for your adjustment.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine,s confusion was the normal response for a bot struck down\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unexpectadely. The voices seemed to laugh. again he attempted to\n&gt; &gt; communicate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this time with his thoughts. &quot;How&#39;d I get here? and why are you\n&gt; adjusting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me?(Please this is a spiritual moment avoid any lewd comments.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Piston glanced back &quot;I&#39;m the rogue of the group, the young stubborn\none.\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; died in a battle with a technowizzard in the swamps of paradrose. My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; adjustor was a rogue too, are you sensing a pattern?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I&#39;ll continue in another post shortly so you people don&#39;t get eye\n&gt; strain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reading this.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, August 17, 2000 3:23 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Don&#39;t die yet Wing!!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If no one object, and this is subject to change, but is it OK if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine takes her spark out and keeps it in his body in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compartment or something and have it conneccted to his power supply?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can&#39;t post for her while she is in this state, but he can buildher\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a new body in time, This is just an ida so let me know.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Logo Morph, under normal circumstances I would say to let her die,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;ve lost too many characters already, don&#39;t let Shadow Wing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; die!...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
