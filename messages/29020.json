But she was willing to take this time to help \nProwl get his feet under him and hoped he would forgive her for breaking his \nwing in SBM.\nShe could tell that he was pretty shaken up and she rubbed his side a bit.\n&lt; Looks like you got one when I got mine back, babe.&quot;\nShe smiled at him all the same.\nIt was a powerful mode and she was sure that if he could just get controle \nof it he&#39;d be something to be feared in battles, and her thoughts relayed \nthat too.\n&lt; Think you can stay awake?&gt;\nIron Raptor didn&#39;t really want him sleeping but she could take a mega cycle \nor two for him to rest and relax in his quarters before she got him down to \nwork on what she had in mind.\nIt was about the right time to get down to his plan.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
