I\n&gt; almost shoot you when you found me in that panic room... I w=\r\nas really scared\n&gt; while we are under attack...&quot; then her face turned grin,=\r\n but after few\n&gt; seconds she was smiling again.

Just like mine and we will look like a twins.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nNightlight smiled, she really wished a beast mode more her old one than a\n&gt;=\r\n new one.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS smiled at is wife, feeling encouraged by the stre=\r\nngth she was\ngaining and the emotions that were playing across her face. Ev=\r\nen her\nresponses wee the same old NIGHTLIGHT, and that was music to his aud=\r\nio\nsensors as he heard them.\n\nHe could see by the look on her face her unea=\r\nse at choosing a new\nbeast mode. =93It=92s okay.=94 He said as he squeezed =\r\nher hand. =93You can\nchoose that later, as you get stronger. We can choose =\r\nthe one that\nbest suits =96you-.=94 Rodimus said emphasizing that word =91y=\r\nou=92 wanting\nher to know that the choice was completely hers what she want=\r\ned to do.\n=93We can remake your old one, or make a new one.=94\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Kup nodded and went to medical bay, he came  in and smiled watchting at\n&gt; =\r\nNightlight. She seemed to have a marvelous recuperation; Elita looked at\n&gt; =\r\nwhere Kup was and widely smiled and happyly said &quot;Uncle Kup!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup&#39;s w=\r\nidely smile and huged the childbot and looking at the mother said\n&gt; &quot;how do=\r\n you feel? &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m much better&quot;answered Nighlight with a smile\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Take=\r\n it easy, girl&quot;said Kup who felt a stab of guilt cause he had shooted a\n&gt; t=\r\nranquilizer dart when she was running away of maximals, but his mind\n&gt; remi=\r\nnds him that It was for a good cause &quot;You need to take things easy for a\n&gt; =\r\nwhile&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight nodded, and then Kup looked at Rodimus and said &quot;Lord=\r\n Elder needs\n&gt; to see us in the meeting room, all the maximals leaders have=\r\n to be sumoned\n&gt; to an important meeting&quot;.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nNodding RODIMUS looked u=\r\np at KUP, knowing as he did that the old mech\nhadn=92t come in here just to=\r\n see them. He could tell by his stance that\nthere was something else at pla=\r\ny. When he spoke he could only feel it\ndeep in his processor.\n\nHe looked ba=\r\nck down at NIGHTLIGHT and ELITA, =93I have to go now, but I\nwill be back as=\r\n soon as I can.=94 His smile was slightly melancholy.\n=93The medics should =\r\nbe about repaired. Perhaps they will come in here\nsoon to check up on you.=\r\n=94\n\nRODIMUS hugged his wife and then hugged his daughter. =93Take care of\n=\r\nyour mommy while I see what this is all about.=94 He said to ELITA\ntousling=\r\n her hair as he did so. =93I promise I won=92t leave without\ntelling you.=\r\n=94\n\nHe looked over at KUP, =93Let=92s go.=94\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord noded=\r\n and opened his comlink to Lord Perseus &quot;Lord PErseus, I&#39;m\n&gt; speaking in th=\r\ne behalf of Lord Elder and he want to meet you here in the\n&gt; Ark.

She knew where to find him, and sh=\r\ne readilly raises her hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I can do that, I know where he is.  I won&#39;=\r\nt take long, I promise.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She saunters off to find Tucson, but finds tha=\r\nt the room has a private code\n&gt; on it.  She narrows an eye in thought and d=\r\necides to give him a text message\n&gt; which she knew would go through to him.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lord Elder needs you in the ready room ASAP.  Something&#39;s up.  Straig=\r\nht\n&gt; Shot.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson gets the message in an audio fashion.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I copy t=\r\nhat Straight Shot.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted Talon.\n&gt; Here, come=\r\n with me, I think it&#39;s important and I feel that Lord Elder needs\n&gt; to meet=\r\n with all of us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gets to his feet, and offers his hand to Talon, to=\r\n help her up as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon smiled and she accepted Tucson&#39;s =\r\nhelp and followed him while she said\n&gt; &quot;We will do something, it&#39;s somethin=\r\ng that could be done&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWhile WINDLORD was waiting for the response f=\r\nrom LORD PERSEUS and\nSTRAIGHT SHOT was delivering her message to TUSCON the=\r\ny all received a\nmessage from LEGACY that he required them to prepare the m=\r\nain bay near\nthe entrance of the ARK, but still on the inside. They would t=\r\nalk to\neveryone there.\n\nIt would in approximately 1 Earth hour.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Perceptor looking to Uproar and Quickstride said &quot;Now what?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nNow =\r\nit would be up to the Maximals and Autobots to wait for the next\nhour and s=\r\nee what the meeting would be about. Would there be changes\ncoming. LEO II, =\r\nWING SABER had only just arrived recently as well as\nthe medics and the Fuz=\r\nors. What message did these new warriors bring\nto the fold and what would i=\r\nt mean for the team that had already been\nhere.\n\nIn one Earth hour they wou=\r\nld soon find out.\n\nOOC: I should be posting the meeting either this weekend=\r\n or on Monday\nif everything goes right.
