Pacifix walked outside, and stretched\n&gt; knowing that this would be his last day on the planet he had called\n&gt; home for so many years. &quot;Ok.&quot; He opened an encrypted commlink\n&gt; to all Autobots who were going on the mission.

He aririve at the entrance, and hops into it,\n&gt; appearing at the bottom. He walks around the ship, finds a crate to\n&gt; site on, moves it to the large open area which Pacifix would\n&gt; probably use for his farwell speech.
