In fact Rodimus&#39; form cannot be truly seen, as he&#39;s covered\n&gt; head to foot in them, however every scan confirms that he is indeed in\n&gt; there somewhere. Scans also reveal that although he is healthy, he is\n&gt; undergoiong his own ordeal, something left over from the insects. Time\n&gt; is of the essence to get him back and repaired.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the party makes it way back to the Ark they can hear several\n&gt; explosions behind them, the walls rumbling around them but so far\n&gt; nothing seems to inhibit their travel.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile back at the Ark Lord Elder was there at the headquarters,\n&gt; apparently he had not taken any time for rest or even to eat, instead\n&gt; he manned the communicatyion station waiting for any word.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We read you Tuscon!&quot; Elder said as the call came in. &quot;We will have\n&gt; medical staff standing by when you get here.&quot; Elder manipulated a few\n&gt; controls as he spoke, &quot;and the shield is up and waiting for your\n&gt; entrance.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder turned back to Kup and just smiled broadly, &quot;They&#39;re alive!&quot; he\n&gt; said, nearly leaping out his chair with happniness.\n&gt; \n&gt; It takes Tuscon hours of driving, but finally Tuscon arrives at an\n&gt; opening, a final break in the long monotony of near featureless\n&gt; smoothly tunneled walls. They at long last arrive at an opening to a\n&gt; rather deep pit.\n&gt; \n&gt; The pit is very deep and very dark and it seems to go on for a very\n&gt; long time. It is roughly 8-10 feet and looking down it runs nearly\n&gt; straight down into the depths of the earth; even with artificial\n&gt; light, its end point cannot be seen as it continued into the darkness\n&gt; below. However looking up, several hundred feet up a tiny pinprick of\n&gt; light can be seen, it is the surface! However to reach the top one\n&gt; would need to be able to fly or have extremely good climbing\n&gt; abilities, as there are no hand holds and not even a single plant\n&gt; breaks the surface of the walls lining this area, the sides are\n&gt; extremely smooth and sheer,\n&gt; almost as if someone had cut it with some sort of high energy beam. .\n&gt; \n&gt; From beneath Tuscon&#39;s position heat and noxious fumes rise from below,\n&gt; clearly show the danger of failing to climb or fly properly and\n&gt; plunging into the super heated depths. It would be a grizzly end\n&gt; indeed.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
