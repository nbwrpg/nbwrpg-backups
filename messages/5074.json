I meant sword, Tav left her staff somewhere on the battlefield when Obliteratron attacked.)\n\nTavatron&#39;s optics narrowed to slits as she drew her sword and tried to pinpoint the origin of the sound. Her head snapped to the right as Zardus emerged from the surrounding brush. She followed his every movement with her narrowed optics, her grip about her sword tightening as she prepared to strike. A low growl formed deep in her throat:\n\n&quot;Zardus...&quot; \n\nShe snarled as the leader of the Alliance stopped walking and stood before them. Tavatron drew her sword back, prepared to lunge at the Alliance leader, but stopped once she discovered he was not alone. Her body tensed when she felt the cold tip of a rifle pressing against the back of her neck. She hated guns, that being the main reason why she didn&#39;t carry one. Right now, however, she would gladly trade her drill sword for a good plasma rifle.\n \nHer own safety was of unimportance. Getting Iron Raptor back to base intact and unharmed was first priority. She had been critically wounded before, she would survive, as she always had. However, this time she didn&#39;t have Dinobot to back her up. She was starting to wish she had waited for him to rise before setting out on this mission. No matter, he wasn&#39;t here and she was.\n\nTavatron aknowledged Iron Raptor&#39;s look by sheathing her sword and resuming an emotionless expression. She showed no fear or anger, she simply stood there, awaiting Iron Raptor&#39;s orders. She was about to protest when Iron Raptor took an extremely bold step towards the leader of the Alliance, but remained silent. Tavatron watched as Iron Raptor shouldered past Zardus and simply walked away. \n\nTavatron stood there a moment, unsure of what to do. A warrior didn&#39;t run from battle, even when the odds were against her. Still, remaining could prove as fatal a decision as walking away. Tavatron sighed inwardly, her expression remaining cold and unconcerned. She followed closely behind Iron Raptor, pushing past Zardus and hopefully out of a potentially deadly situation.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
