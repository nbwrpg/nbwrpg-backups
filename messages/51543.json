Empath&#39;s powers, if you care to read her bio, \nare grounded in science; the Soul Orb just blasted them to insane \nlevels.  The boost will be lost the moment she loses the Orb (as I had \nintended to begin with).\n\nI do have a slight beef with the &quot;no mind control&quot; clause: besides \nmaking for an excellent sub-story as the victim struggles against his \nor her controller, such a precaution is largely unnecessary with the \npower-draining effect implemented in other sections of the ruling.  \nThe constant battle and resulting power requirements would \nautomatically force such an effect to be short-term in nature - \nprobably a maximum time frame measured in hours.  (Single-digit at \nthat.)\n\nAnd another thing, largely unrelated to the ruling: For the UMPTEEN \nMILLIONTH TIME, the Soul Orbs affect different bots in different ways. \n Empath got her telepathic powers increased because that was her \ndefining characteristic.  PLEASE quit assuming that anyone else would \nhave that exact reaction!  Phoenix, for one, if and when she comes in \ncontact with one of these condensed balls of Vok souls (which is what \nthey are), will have a completely different fate.\n\n\n"}}
