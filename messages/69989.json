His resemblence to Tucson&#39;s=\r\n \nold form was impecable, yet the only thing that separated him from Tucson=\r\n was \nhis black paint job and his accent. He had been manufactured using th=\r\ne same \nspecs and the same programming. Hopefully his configurations would =\r\nnot be found \nout.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; What?
