She sounded Predacon, thank Primus. He gave her quick eye\n&gt; contact. She ran at the spot where Cheetor was twice. The third time, he\nsaw\n&gt; him rush out. He heard him growl, throwing his legs out to run. That was\n&gt; Cheetor? But that thing was nothing but a pile of fur and spots.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What in tarnation?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; But after a few seconds some of it made some sense. Before the youth had a\n&gt; flight mode, being all metal, he was once a pure cheetah.\n&gt;\n&gt; He ran after him. He fired at the youth, at his flank. But the shot went\n&gt; past him.\n&gt;\n&gt; He saw the youth spin around and transform. He withdrew a gun and fired at\n&gt; them. He fired at KitKat, then three times at himself. Quickstrike nearly\n&gt; stumbled. He almost lost his leg from the shot, but he managed to dash to\na\n&gt; tree.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Worldwide Calling with Firetalk!\n&gt; Click Here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5481/13/_/_/_/962073600/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
