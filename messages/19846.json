He knew Striker well \nenough to\n&gt; &gt; hold his own in a fight, there was a good chance that Slayer \nfought with\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; same style. Slayer still didn&#39;t know that the wolf he was \nfighting was the\n&gt; &gt; once lesser wolf named Lunarpine, and now Slayer was going to \nlearn that\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine was more than more than meets the eye.\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 31, 2000 5:37 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Yanosh don&#39;t leave me hangin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Slayer laughs, watching Lunarping fall to the ground.

Lunarpine crossed his claws again \nblocking the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lasers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Slayer fired at him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I agree, you are like the Pit, you keep going on without \nend. but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about your talking I&#39;m still waiting for you to atack.

A second missle struck him in the shoulder \ncausing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a gaping\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rip in his frame.
