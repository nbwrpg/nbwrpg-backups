Those blasted Maximals, don&#39;t they know we&#39;re \non their side!&quot; Dark One yelled.  &quot;Transform!&quot; he commanded.\n\n\nBreakdown transformed into his artillery cannon mode, Pyro to his tank mode, \nand Hiss to his gun mode, Dark One catching him and taking aim with it.  \n&quot;Fire!&quot; he yelled, pulling the trigger of Hiss&#39;s mode, firing three powerful \nplasma blasts off at Iron Raptor since she was so big and it was so hard to \nhit people with a pistol without a scope at his distance.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown&#39;s internal computers found the target.  Assuring him of the target, \nhe fired an explosive shell 3 ft high and 2 ft wide off at Dinobot, even \nthough Zardus was near him.\n\n---\n\nPyro swtiched his weapon.  Firing two missiles from the missile launchers in \nhis tank form.  He still had the damage he had sustained in this mode, and it \nhurt like the Pit!  One missile flew off at Dinobot, the other at Iron Raptor \nin her gargantuan form, Pyro not sure who to shoot.  So many targets, he \nmight as well take the big one.  \n\n---\n\nAnubis and Hades leapt into the air.  Anubis transformed into a left arm, \ngoing into the air, while Hades turned into a leg, a left leg, heading into \nthe air.  \n  \n\n====\n\n\nBumblebee yelled, the shots slamming him through a branch, though he was able \nto keep himself in the air.  Firing four missiles off at Ursa Major (two from \neach launcher), he fired two optic blasts off at Dark Mouse, deciding he \nshouldn&#39;t do that anymore, since he needed all the firepower he could muster \nwith those Maxis around.\n\n---\n\nInjector, got back up, firing a single stinger missile off at Ramulus.\n\n"}}
