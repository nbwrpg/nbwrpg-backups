She didn&#39;t look at him the entire trip.  She was \nthinking about how Vulois would react when he saw her again.  He might pull \na lazar out on her, try to cut her throat, of gun her down.\nShe really didn&#39;t want to see him.  She was too ashamed.  She kept flying, \nbut kept her head down.\n\n----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: Dachande85@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;::CyberShark::\n&gt;\n&gt;     He Transformed into Flight Mode and began to lead the way. They had to\n&gt;cover miles and miles before they would reach him. He didn&#39;t want to fly to\n&gt;fast incase of loosing her along the way so they flew at a steady pace.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
