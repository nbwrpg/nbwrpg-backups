I say the pressure of leadership was\n&gt; too great fro him so he went AWOL. He is just out\n&gt; there, somewhere. This leaves the possibility for a\n&gt; return. Since he can&#39;t be found Hot Rod will go to\n&gt; the bridge and make the announcement.\n&gt; That is, if everyone is ok with Hot Rod as\n&gt; Commander. Kup of course would keep Hot Rod in line,\n&gt; just as he did in the movie and 3rd season.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh and you are quite right about Kup&#39;s speech, Dewy.\n&gt; \n&gt; IC: ::Kup::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well I cant pretend to know much about the Vok,\n&gt; lad. I am glad to know that someone is backing us\n&gt; though.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup turns towards the door.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do you know where Hot Rod is? I have some rather\n&gt; disturbing news for him.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
