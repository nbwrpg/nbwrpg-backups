The sky was \nbrilliant oranges and reds.  She got up, tansformed into bot mode and \nset about making her ship a little more livable.  She found her small \ntool kit and started working on fixing the emergency power cells, but \nthey were too far damaged.  She did find her distress beacon.  She \npressed it and hoped someday, someone might find her. It gave out a \ngeneral MAYDAY. But no allience signals. \n\nShe cleaned up most of the rubble and made a pile of scrap outside \nthe ship.  Next, she went to the console.  Th best she could manage \nwas fixing her chair.  She sat in it and propped her feet up. She put \nher hands behind her head and leaned back.  \n&quot;Yeah, it won&#39;t be so bad here. A few curtains, a little paint, this \nmight be down right cozy.&quot;  with sarcasm dripping off her tongue.\n\n\n"}}
