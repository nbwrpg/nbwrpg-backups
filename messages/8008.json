I don&#39;t think teleporting \nlong distances is legal, but short distances (as Logo said, 50 feet or so), \nis fine. Just remember that teleporting ussually takes alot of energy (most \nof the toys and fan-created characters I&#39;ve seen that can teleport go into \nstasis lock after the procedure), so don&#39;t overdo it.\n\n::Prowl::\n\nProwl nearly loses his balance as Iron Raptor throws her arms around him. His \narm goes around her waist, Prowl not minding that she was holding him rather \nhard. He smiles as she replies, sliding his other arm around her. He presses \nIron Raptor to himself, relieved to once again hold her in his arms.\n\nProwl leans his head forward, locking his lips with Iron Raptor&#39;s. A relieved \nshudder runs through him as he feels her lips on his, and her body being \npressed to him. He raises his head, looking down at Iron Raptor.\n\nProwl grins. &quot;I take my eyes off you for a minute, and you go and get \nyourself kidnapped!&quot; he says jokingly, looking into her optics, love for her \nmixed with relief at the fact that he had rescued her in his.\n\n"}}
