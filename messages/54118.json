She really had not seen the organic animals. Her \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;programming, spirit, or whatever you called it, was what made her... as well \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;as what all she had gone through. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Glancing down at her paw/hand in his, then looking back up at him. Many \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;things rushed through her meta processor, but nothing of compassion or the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;sort. She was oblivious to it.. or so she thought. Never was it something \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;that she allowed. She had to make herself as meriless, cunning, ruthless, \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;fierce, .... unfeeling... as possible just to be the Decepticon she was. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;But, it was Megatron who stirred something in her. A fire, not of the sort of \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;desire that she thought, but a passion to win, to continue to dominate, to \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;conquer.... as well as ... something else? \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;If so, she never allowed it. She couldn&#39;t. But... now... this techno organic \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;form was stirring emotions she had subdued so well. It was hard to control \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;them. She only gazed at him, like in a trance. She somehow could feel the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;part that was once Megatron in him.... it called out to her like a beating \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;drum. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;&quot;Decepticons must be merciless. It is our destiny to conquer.&quot; She told him \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;with such confindence in her feline voice. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;MSN Fotos: la forma m�s f�cil de compartir e imprimir fotos.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.msn.com/8HMBESMX/2752&quot;&gt;Haz clic aqu� &lt;/a&gt; Get 2 months FREE*. &lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
