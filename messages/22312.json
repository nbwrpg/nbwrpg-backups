This was pissing him off. Activating\n&gt; the comm, one more time, he sends a transmission to ALL MAXIMALS.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;All Maximals, this is the third call to the meeting at the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire. Get to the conference room immediately.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl glances at Iron Raptor as he hears her thoughts. He didn&#39;t mean\n&gt; to imply that she was weak by protecting her.\n&gt;\n&gt; -I didn&#39;t say you were weak, love- he replies through thought,\n&gt; looking over at her as she stepped up. His eyes slid over her form,\n&gt; her curves showing through nicely. Prowl jerks his eyes back to\n&gt; shadown, but then frowns as he hears Iron Raptor&#39;s thoughts. The\n&gt; mixed beast mode wasn&#39;t gone?\n&gt;\n&gt; Iris had said that the merge would take care of the problem. But what\n&gt; if it hadn&#39;t? What if Iron Raptor could still get stuck in that form?\n&gt; Prowl shakes his head. It wasn&#39;t very likely. It was only a thought,\n&gt; after all.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks back at Iron Raptor as she yells the command, watching her\n&gt; go into the &#39;battle mode&#39;, or at least that&#39;s what he thought it was.\n&gt; He smiles as he looks her over. Her curves still showed through. She\n&gt; looked like a warrior now that she stood as tall as Prowl, but she\n&gt; was still definetly feminine. Prowl smiles. He wouldn&#39;t mind finding\n&gt; out how it felt to kiss her in that mode...\n&gt;\n&gt; Kluster&#39;s transmission sounds in Prowl&#39;s head, distracting him from\n&gt; Iron Raptor&#39;s words to Shadow. This mode obvioustly had a comm-link.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Kluster&#39;s calling all Maximals to a meeting, love- he says to her\n&gt; using his thoughts -We should get over to the Cybertronian Fire-\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * Iron Raptor snappes her head towards the new voice just as Prowl\n&gt; frowns,\n&gt; &gt; not seeing the bot right away but making sense of what feeling she\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; recieving from Prowls mind, only amplafying it with her own senses.\n&gt; &gt; But where Prowl thought that this bot was not friendly, she left\n&gt; room for\n&gt; &gt; the slight chance that he just might be. But that was the way she\n&gt; had always\n&gt; &gt; thought.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But then her eyes turned to Prowl just as some idea poped into his\n&gt; head,\n&gt; &gt; reading or more like FEELING the words with which to speak before\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; emerged out of his mouth.\n&gt; &gt; Forgetting about the heavy wings at her back.\n&gt; &gt; Though, watching and feeling in wonder as she watched the results\n&gt; of that\n&gt; &gt; one word.\n&gt; &gt; It was a battle mode!!\n&gt; &gt; Only with a new command and new results!!\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor watched as armor split to be replaced by another coat\n&gt; of it,\n&gt; &gt; only silver and by the sense of it...far more stronger.\n&gt; &gt; It even went beyond the limits of Transmetal 2s!\n&gt; &gt; Wow!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But once the transformation was through and the newly armored Prowl\n&gt; stood\n&gt; &gt; between her and the new visitor her mind had only one thing to\n&gt; think of at\n&gt; &gt; that moment, and her thoughts were directed right towards Prowl.**\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt; Oh no you don&#39;t! I can protect myself! What sort of weakling do\n&gt; you think\n&gt; &gt; I am?!&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * And with that she stepped towards the new bot, thanking tha\n&gt; Matrix above\n&gt; &gt; that her hair covered her, still, naked form. But not for long.\n&gt; &gt; Basically the same thing had happened to Prowl as had happened to\n&gt; her, they\n&gt; &gt; had both fused and her scanners indicated that she was now...part\n&gt; snow owl.\n&gt; &gt; That was where the wings had come from.\n&gt; &gt; So, not that Prowl and herself were fused physically and mentally,\n&gt; sharing\n&gt; &gt; everything, then the only conclusion was that she would have\n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; towards a similar battle mode...and perhaps the same baqttle\n&gt; activation\n&gt; &gt; code.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor stood ready, her crystal blue eyes fixed on the new\n&gt; bot, knowing\n&gt; &gt; for a fact that he had no chance against just one of them.\n&gt; &gt; But there was also something in the back of her mind, something\n&gt; that was\n&gt; &gt; trying to get out. A thought suddenly entering her mind.\n&gt; &gt; What had really happened about that nightmarish beast mode? Had it\n&gt; been\n&gt; &gt; wiped out completely? Or simply deactivated?\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor focused on that tingling in the back of her mind,\n&gt; suddenly\n&gt; &gt; seeing something that almost made her jump back.\n&gt; &gt; It was there! It was still there! She could see it in her mind.\n&gt; &gt; On all fours, acidic saliva dripping from it&#39;s bared fangs as it\n&gt; hunched its\n&gt; &gt; soulder. Black exo-armor covering it&#39;s body, shining in some inner\n&gt; light.\n&gt; &gt; Eyes trained forward...almost as it just like...hers....\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptors eyes grew big; it was...under controle? No!\n&gt; Waiting...waiting\n&gt; &gt; to break free? No...ready to pounce? Yes! Ready for action!\n&gt; &gt; Just...like...HER! It was listening! Actually listening!\n&gt; &gt; The image in her mind then pawed the black ground...suddenly\n&gt; &gt; feeling...seeing it&#39;s toughts!\n&gt; &gt; Blood, carnage...death! Mutilation!!\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s all she could feel from it!\n&gt; &gt; No...it wasn&#39;t really under controle...just not wanting to fight\n&gt; right now.\n&gt; &gt; But Iron Raptor then shook her head a bit, suddenly knowing that it\n&gt; wanted.\n&gt; &gt; For her to transform and at least release a bit of it, to fight.\n&gt; &gt; Well, the first request she could do!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor then stepped in front of Prowl, the wind picking up and\n&gt; &gt; fluttering her hair a little, but not enough to show anything.\n&gt; &gt; She took in a deep breath, closing her optics for a moment and\n&gt; finding her\n&gt; &gt; still point, all going dark around her other then the wind and the\n&gt; sound of\n&gt; &gt; her own sparkbeat. Concintrating on that beat she opened her eyes,\n&gt; gaze\n&gt; &gt; straight.*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Iron Raptor, ULATRMETAL!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * With that she moved to her toes and whirled in a full circle, her\n&gt; mine and\n&gt; &gt; thus her eyes seeing nothing but blackness at first but then a\n&gt; light\n&gt; &gt; surrounding her.\n&gt; &gt; Her hair seeming to sparkle as it flowed around her as she moved,\n&gt; her wings\n&gt; &gt; stretching wide before suddenly seeming to bust out as small\n&gt; sparkling\n&gt; &gt; snow-flakes.\n&gt; &gt; From the center of her back then seemed to sprout out of her flesh\n&gt; two\n&gt; &gt; pieces of fluid black armor, so dark that even the light seemed to\n&gt; be drawn\n&gt; &gt; into them.\n&gt; &gt; Those two pieces appeared just under her arms and stretched to her\n&gt; waist as\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor lifted her arms over her head, snapping her head\n&gt; towards her\n&gt; &gt; upraised hands as the pieces then wrapped and molded themselves\n&gt; around her\n&gt; &gt; chest, slamming together at the center of her torso.\n&gt; &gt; Then, just as suddenly as before, two pieces of armor sprouted from\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; small of her back this time, coming around to mold themselves to\n&gt; her pelvice\n&gt; &gt; and thighs. Slamming together with a metallic ring at her groin and\n&gt; front\n&gt; &gt; thighs.\n&gt; &gt; Same with her lower legs, another metallic ring sent clear through\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; darkness as, they too, came together.\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor finally lowered her arms, her eyes closed as her head\n&gt; became\n&gt; &gt; straight, armor also covering her arms up to her wrists, ending in\n&gt; a point\n&gt; &gt; above her hand.\n&gt; &gt; Suddenly two large shoulder-plates appeared begind her, slamming\n&gt; down on her\n&gt; &gt; soulders, the tips reaching even toller then her head. Two large\n&gt; diamond\n&gt; &gt; shaped rubies in the center of each.\n&gt; &gt; From there a line of spiked armor as thin as a belt wrapped around\n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; waist, a large piece of armor suddenlu developing and closing the\n&gt; betl as it\n&gt; &gt; fell over her groin area.\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor then opened her eyes as, in a flash of red, a large and\n&gt; long\n&gt; &gt; cape fell down towards her heals from the back of each shoulder-\n&gt; plate. Armor\n&gt; &gt; then coming from the back of her heals and extending down, covering\n&gt; her feet\n&gt; &gt; and ending in long sharp, silver raptor claws. The armor so long\n&gt; what it\n&gt; &gt; looked as if she stood on her tip-toes, yet only raising her height\n&gt; a few\n&gt; &gt; inches. Only looking like a pair of TMed raptor feet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptors mind then suddenly cleared in a flash, the blue\n&gt; morning sky\n&gt; &gt; coming into view, a flock of large crows liting into the air as her\n&gt; eyes\n&gt; &gt; then turned on the new bot, Shadow.\n&gt; &gt; Gazing towards him in her new armor, her body looking as if more\n&gt; like a\n&gt; &gt; knight then Prowl. ( for anyone who&#39;s seen the anime Escaflowne,\n&gt; her armor\n&gt; &gt; is a bit like that. hehehe. If you don&#39;t know what Escaflowne is\n&gt; then just\n&gt; &gt; fo to Ask Jeeves and type in Where can I find pictures of\n&gt; Escaflowne, and\n&gt; &gt; just look around on the sides that come up. The pica are really\n&gt; cool!)\n&gt; &gt; But she stood squarly, her body looking muck more bulkyier then\n&gt; before, but\n&gt; &gt; her head remained the same. Silver hair still falling loose from\n&gt; her head\n&gt; &gt; but now behind her back.\n&gt; &gt; Her face calm as she stood beside Prowl, now the same size as him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor  looked at Shadow, stepping towards him, the sound of\n&gt; gears\n&gt; &gt; moving and hydrolics working sounding out.*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Pay no attention to him.... As commander of the Maximals, I ask\n&gt; who you\n&gt; &gt; are any why you threaten us so?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will post IRs weapons as I use her more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; _______________\n&gt; &gt; Get more from the Web.
