Her programs knew that making him choose one over the\nother would be a bad thing to do. She hoped in her spark that in the\nfuture, very soon in the future, that her spark would let go of him.\nBut for now it wanted him more than anything. And the mere mention of\nhim even wanting another made her circuit boards fry.  She forced\nherself to smile and tried to be happy in the moment. &quot;Alright.&quot;  She\nlightly punched his shoulder. &quot;TAG! Race you there.&quot;  And she took off\nrunning. In mid stride she transformed back into wolf mode and ran as\nfast as she could, feeling the wind on her faceplates. &quot;Come on slow\npoke, keep up!&quot; she yelled back at him laughing. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt;  \n&gt; He smiled to her explaination, spending one on one time was always\ngood.  He was stopped in mid thought when she leaned in and planted a\nkiss on his cheek.  She apologized, but there was no need, other than\nshe could not totally commit herself to loving him.  He placed his\nhands on her shoulders, his own spark a bit unsteady.  He leaned in\nand kissed her lips lightly, his faceplates trying to articulate it\ncorrectly for her.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Nothing to apologize for.  It&#39;s okay, I like speading time alone\nwith you too.  I know I should between you two, but I&#39;m not sure it\nwould be such a great idea.  But please don&#39;t fight with her, don&#39;t\nfight about me, it would hurt me deeply.  Maybe I can sort things out\nand make a choice, but for now, let&#39;s just worry about work space\nromance, hm?&quot; he ended with a wink and a slight smile.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But he did mean it, if they forced him to choose... it might end\nbadly for all of them.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
