He saw Battera near \nthe chamber. Curious bot. Won&#39;t wait for anything. He said to her.\n\n&quot;Come with me to Terminess&#39; lab. I&#39;ll tell you the plan there.\n\nVulois than sent a message to Soundwave.\n\n&quot;Join us at Terminess&#39; lab. I will tell you all there.&quot;\n\nVulois took off towards the lab.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTerminess was estatic. She had found her pod, and was going to be able to \nmake a ship out of it!\n\n&quot;YES! Now I can go home and re-take possesion of my gang.&quot;\n\nShe quickly hitched the pod to her back and started towards the Pred base.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nBronco smiled and sent a message back to Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;Killing me doesn&#39;t matter. If I die in battle, it is honourable. I have \nnothing left to live for. Also, if you go on a rampage, your judgement will \nbe impaired, leaving the Maximals without a competent leader and open for \ndestruction. I will give you one more mega-cycle. But since you still lack \nthings, You will only get a certain part.&quot;\n\nBronco pulls out a strange device he built. He puts it straight to Octociz&#39; \nchest, and begins to pull on the handle. Octociz screams and screams, and \nfinaly goes offline. Inside the machine, is the lifeforce of Octociz: His \nSpark.\n\n&quot;You have one meag-cycle, Iron Raptor, And no funny stuff. This machine is \nnow Octociz&#39; life machine. If I remove his spark from it, within 5 cycles he \nwould die. So keep it to a minimum. Just you, no weapons. See you in one \nmega-cycle.&quot;\n\nBronco kicks the empty shell of Octociz into the sea, where it will be \nburied with the Axalon forever. Bronco laughed.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
