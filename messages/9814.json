He was in\n&gt; bad shape.\n&gt;\n&gt; A whineing sound came from the pod, DNA scan complete, no compatable\n&gt; lifeforms. Protoform not systemized for replication.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Of course it&#39;s not, it&#39;s splattered all over the ground.&quot; Lunarpine\n&gt; was tired of hearing the pods scanner so he raised his hand and\n&gt; slapped the control.\n&gt;\n&gt; Malfunction\n&gt;\n&gt; BOOM\n&gt;\n&gt; The control panel exploded sending him about 30 feet through the air,\n&gt; crashing through the tall grass to the hard ground below.

The wolfbot hooked himself up hopeing that the pod had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough energy to sustain him. He hoped that the pod would emit a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; strong enough reading to attract Maximals.
