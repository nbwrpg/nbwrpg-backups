He wasn&#39;t\nfully functional yet. he was beginning to wonder if giving her this body was\na mistake. She was the bear but it was him that was fealing grumpy at the\nmoment. He stepped to the replicator and created a reboost compound (Roboyic\ncoffee) he sucked it down and proceeded to the lab. He stepped in and saw\nthe mess that the drones had created. &quot;Should I even bother to ask what went\non in here?&quot; He saw the two drones on the floor. &quot;Never mind, I don&#39;t want\nto know.&quot; He proceeded to the computer to see what the scans for the night\nhad read. &quot;It seems you had a strong ECG reading for the night.&quot; Again the\nold science bot checked the mess in the room. &quot;Which would explain this\nmess.&quot; He checked all the readings multiple times to be sure of the results.\n&quot;It seems the virus is out of your system, you&#39;re free to go outside\nwhenever you like. &quot;Preferably ASAP.&quot; his thoughts weren&#39;t easy to hide as\nhe started programming the other drones to clean up the mess.\n\nAfter his job was complete he decided that since he was already awake he&#39;d\ncheck the DNA that foxfingers hsd brought back. he had a grizzly bear, a\nwolf, and an extremely powerful raptor. those deffinitely had\npossabilities.The Dragon cells were an odd addition and (Whatever Tavatron\nturned into) could be set aside for now. He decided to start with the\nraptor. he programmed another protoform and began the procedure. He tried to\ndeprogram the parts of the DNA that were Transmetal2 technology. As an\nexperiment he injected the virus once again. If Primes prophecy was to\nbecome a reality he&#39;d need to make creatures to fit the description. &quot;All\nwould become one&quot; and Translife and organics would join.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, November 21, 2000 6:44 AM\nSubject: IceBird\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; As she woke up, the drones stopped moving and fell to the floor.
