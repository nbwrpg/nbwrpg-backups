He was just a bundle of\n&gt;bot\n&gt; &gt; underneath the blanket. He shook his head and stretched his legs out. He\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t realize it at first, but he almost kicked Stingtra. She sat up,\n&gt; &gt; looking at her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Morning,&quot; he said to her half unconsciously.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He striped the blanket off of himself and looked at the interior of the\n&gt; &gt; cave. It was daylight, so that meant there was more planing (if Megatron\n&gt; &gt; wanted it that way)to do. He saw Dark Mouse at the console. He need to\n&gt;talk\n&gt; &gt; to her. The new flier, Terrorsaur was just taking off from his perch \n&gt;that\n&gt; &gt; was a mound of stalactmite. He stood up and walked towards Dark Mouse. \n&gt;He\n&gt; &gt; stood behind her and put his cobra hand on her shoulder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ah want ya show me how this computer works.&quot; he said to her.\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Life&#39;s too short to send boring email.
