She started \nmuttering in her sleep, &quot;Prebon...Striker....Slayer...&quot;\nThe chips had fought with her programs and were starting to make a \nnew format for her. The chips had found a way to make the programs co-\nexist in her circuits and programs. \n\nA small ribbon of smoke escaped from her head armor. \n\nSome of her internal circuits were fried.  But most were still intact \nand running.  Her main maximal program was in a, now seperate, \noperating program. Her new trainer program was functioning on it&#39;s \nown in another seperate program.  Most of her logic circuits had \nsustained a lot of damage and some were still smoldering.  Her \nmaximal program was strong, but the trainer program was equally \nstrong.  She now had to programs fighting for control.  \n\nHer fist clenched up and her optics flickered as the programs fought \ninside her. \n\n\n"}}
