She looked back and saw the strange blue thing still behind her. Teltoli wondered what it was.. almost to the point where it was getting annoying. She heard low murmers coming from the bush, and two pairs of eyes on her.\n\nShe throws her hands up in exasperation, and turns to use her zoom-up vision at this bot. Her scanners identified that it was Alliance. And had an almost dragon like form. \n\nShe didn&#39;t trust those Alliance guys.. they were too shifty.. but she hoped the bot would come out soon and state his business if he wanted anything to do with her..\n\n------Original Message------\nFrom: &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: May 19, 2000 5:10:49 AM GMT\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nPlintissa:\n\n&quot;yeah, well i intend to collect a good deal of members..hopefully...sorry\nyou can&#39;t join.....&quot; she said, catching the piece of metal....... &quot;just\nchuck a bunch of that stuff up here, i&#39;ll put it all on....&quot; she said......\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Teltoli SilverFlight&quot; &lt;teltoli@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, May 19, 2000 12:53 AM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; *Teltoli sighs as she hears Plintissa asking if she was going to join*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No, I am not going to join, sorry.
