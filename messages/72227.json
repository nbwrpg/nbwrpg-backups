Tucson=\r\n has a really big heart and to me, he IS A LEADER.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere was a small smile on WINGCALIBER&#39;s face as he listened. &quot;I can=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nremember when LEO PRIME was young, back when he found by his father,&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nwho was back then LIO PRIME.&quot; There was a slight shrug, &quot;Back then the&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nLeo we know was just known as Leo jr.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSANTON nodded as he sat =\r\ndown his pack and came over as well. &quot;Yes, Leo&lt;br&gt;\njr was much like Tuscon,=\r\n young, exuberant, full of energy and even&lt;br&gt;\ncompassion.&quot; SANTON looked w=\r\nhistful as he thought of the past.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;He was much like that.&quot; WINGCA=\r\nLIBER said as he spoke again. &quot;But that&lt;br&gt;\nwas many years and many battles=\r\n ago. Since then he has become a prime,&lt;br&gt;\nand the old Lio Prime became Li=\r\no Convoy and eventually Leo himself&lt;br&gt;\nbecame a Prime.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere was=\r\n a compassionate look from SANTON, &quot;He is going through the&lt;br&gt;\nnatural gro=\r\nwing pains of a leader.&quot; He nodded, &quot;Tuscon is a new Prime&lt;br&gt;\nand has been=\r\n a warrior for most of that time, he has not felt the&lt;br&gt;\nstings of betraya=\r\nl yet from the Predacons that Leo has.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWINGCALIBER nodded, &quot;Do no=\r\nt judge him so harshly because he doesn&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\ntrust the Predacons. I have w=\r\natched him grow as a warrior and a&lt;br&gt;\nleader, and I have seen the forces t=\r\nhat have shaped him.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSANTON grunted, &quot;Most leaders, most Primes s=\r\ntart off much the way&lt;br&gt;\nTuscon is now, full of life and full of trust. &quot; =\r\nHe nodded, &quot;I have&lt;br&gt;\nserved under a few myself. but if not careful the we=\r\night of having men&lt;br&gt;\ndie under your command, the weight of having to make=\r\n the choices that&lt;br&gt;\nwould send men to their deaths can be a burden that c=\r\nhanges you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nGesturing at the door that RAT TRAP and STRAIGHT SHOT=\r\n had just come&lt;br&gt;\nthrough, &quot;He is a different leader than Tuscon because h=\r\ne has been&lt;br&gt;\nthrough different things, but that doesn&#39;t make him a bad le=\r\nader, only&lt;br&gt;\ndifferent. Perhaps Tuscon would have made ultimately differe=\r\nnt&lt;br&gt;\nchoices, but that is the job of a leader, to make those hard choices=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\ndespite what everyone else wants . . . despite what he may himself&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nwant to do.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe words of SANTON and WINGCALIBER are not harsh or=\r\n accusatory, but&lt;br&gt;\nreasoning and questioning, asking STRAIGHT SHOT and RA=\r\nT TRAP to do the&lt;br&gt;\nvery things they are asking of LEO PRIME, to trust, ev=\r\nen when it&lt;br&gt;\ndoesn&#39;t always make sense to.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPresto=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b=\r\nlockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-15-733793787--\r\n\n"}}
