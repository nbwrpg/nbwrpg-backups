As soon as I \nfind a scanner I�ll try and get a pic posted. This post was kindof rushed, \nsorry^_^)\n\nTavatron knew deep down that something was wrong, but currently she was too \nrelieved to be back at base to notice. She had pushed the feeling into the \nvery recesses of her mind. Why dwell on the past when the immediate future \nseemed so clear? They were back at base, and as far as she knew they had \nplenty of time to get Dinobot into an �R chamber. There was still the matter \nof her own injuries, but they were nothing compared to his.  She intended to \nhelp in any way possible, but with her limited knowledge it seemed highly \nunlikely she could do anything but get him to the CR room.\n\nTavatron stopped short as a sudden movement followed by the sound of Dinobot \ntransforming sent a chill down her spine. She automatically turned to face \nthe wounded warrior, only to watch him drop to his knees and lose what \nlittle remained of his fluid. What could have possibly gone wrong? \nEverything had seemed fine only moments ago. Tavatron growled softly as she \nthought, trying to figure out what to do. It figured he wouldn�t let on just \nhow injured he was. He had always been too proud a warrior to let anybot \nknow just how damaged he truly was. As she continued to ponder his current \nstate textual images of possible solutions and probable outcomes sped \nthrough her internal comp:\n\nI-COMP: Insufficient data� unable to assess problem with unit Dinobot.\n\nThe last sentence flashed before her optics for what seemed like an \neternity. How was it not possible to assess his damage? Her computer was \nlimited, but something like this should only take a few nanoseconds to \nanalyze. What was she missing? With a frustrated growl Tavatron turned to \nface Dinobot, only to have her vision suddenly blur as her internal screen \nreceived a message from an unknown sender. The message must have been from \nsomeone nearby, or else it would have come in over her com.\n\nI-COMP: New data� Reassessing prior findings.\n\nThe message was garbled and difficult to understand. It would take at least \n14 cycles for her internal comp to analyze it at its current rate. Dinobot \nmay not have that kind of time:\n\n&quot;Internal computer, increase speed.&quot;\n\nI-COMP: Danger of further injury to internal systems.\n\n&quot;Increase speed of unit Dinobot�s injuries!&quot;\n\nI-COMP: Increasing.\n\nTavatron watched as Dinobot slumped to the floor in stasis lock. She turned \nto the only other �bot present (Foxfingers), and did the only thing she \ncould think of at the moment, ask for help:\n\n&quot;What�s wrong with him?&quot;\n\nBefore he could reply Tavatron contacted IR and told her of their current \nsituation. She then turned expectantly to the small fox �bot before her, \nwaiting for his answer.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
