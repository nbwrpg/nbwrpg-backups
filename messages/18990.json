We both know that my weapon is superior to yours, and that I shall\nbe\n&gt; the victor...while you get a one way tickey to the Pit!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; : But even though her trigger finger was getting edgy, she heard this\n&gt; Maximal out. Though, she had to admit...it was boring!\n&gt; She sighed, cocking her gun.:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m TRYING to escape. What&#39;s it look like?!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; : But then she smiled.:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; And the only reason I used that bomb on that Maximal was because,\n&gt; surprisingly enough, I had no intention on killing him. He saved my life,\n&gt; and for that I spared him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; : BrightBlade eased her grip on her gun.:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Unlike you...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; : Her voice calm and emotionless as she suddenly shifted her aim towards\n&gt; Klants chest-plate and fired, moving to the side so that Klant&#39;s charge\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t touch her.:\n&gt;\n&gt; **********************************\n&gt;\n&gt; : Rage shifted under the weight of the great tree which had fallen on her,\n&gt; the sudden icy feeling around her skill melting in the afternoon sun to\nthe\n&gt; pont of movement.\n&gt; But it was still in her mind, she had to get away!\n&gt;\n&gt; With a large heave of her great body she mannaged to wriggle out from\nunder\n&gt; the fallen tree, staggering to her feet.\n&gt; She was still wounded and bleeding, in pain and generally cranky. But she\n&gt; still was going to get away if it killed her, which she would try to\navoide.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rage growled plaintively as she began to slowly move off into the woods\nand\n&gt; away from the Alliance base, her vision a bit blured and her steps\nunsure.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
