I&#39;m kind of sick (stuffy nose, \nsore throat, painful coughing, it won&#39;t stop!  Five days now!).  Also, for \nthe next dozen or so hours, I&#39;m going to be Christmas shopping.  I&#39;ve noticed \na few things in the battle that were posted by Maxis and will help me OH so \nmuch.  I&#39;m glad the Maxis are so desperate.\n\nAlso, Iron Raptor, the Alliance will never fall, and you have surprise?  I \nhave a surprise.  Oh, yes.  I have a surprise!  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\nJOKER&#39;S ON THE REBOUND BABY!\n\nSorry, couldn&#39;t help it.  But seriously, I&#39;ll be gone for the next dozen \nhours in malls, stores, and other places like that.  I don&#39;t like it, since I \nneed liquid every ten minutes to keep my throat from completely drying up.  \nBut, if I don&#39;t shop now, it probably won&#39;t happen.  So, season&#39;s greetings \nfrom Oblitertron.  When he&#39;s done with all of you, he&#39;ll make your lifeless \nMaximal corpses into one ginormous Christmas card :)\n\n\nLord Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\nPS: I&#39;m not cocky, the Alliance never loses, AHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Unless Yan is a \ncoward and back--what are you doing Chyort?  No, no, NOOOOOOOOO--!!!\n(Sorry, have problems with a certain Russian psychic warrior, I&#39;ll be back in \na dozen hours when the doctors reattach my eye balls into my sockets.  \nYanshoshage knows what I be talking about)\n\n"}}
