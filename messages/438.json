She walked out of her quarters and down to the \nbridge, that was when she walked up to Tigerhawk...*\n\n&quot; Plintissa&#39;s in trouble, facing 3 Preds by herself. I&#39;m going to lighten up \nher load, be back before the Preds attack, alright? Just thought you&#39;d like \nto know, bye!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor growled as she came to the base doors and opened them, there \nwas another transformer that had answered Plintissa&#39;s plea for \nassistance...but who?\nWell, at least the fight wouldn&#39;t just be 2 against 3 like she feared it \nwould.\nShe closed the door behind her and looked out into the distance, she had \nlocated Plintissa on her scanners when she had answered but it was a good \ndistance away from her.*\n\n&quot;Beast Mode!&quot;\n\n* Now transformed she ran off in the direction that her systems showed that \nPlintissa was located, she reopened her comlink as she ran...*\n\n&quot; Plintissa, I&#39;m on my way.
