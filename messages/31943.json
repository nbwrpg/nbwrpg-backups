He hears the command from Halucigen.\nThe control bug was beginning to wear off, but it still had some\neffect.\n\nProwl lands on the ground, seeing Iron Raptor walking toward\nFireblade. He tilts his head. The beast side of him was curious in\nseeing another beast like it, as they wern&#39;t common at all. Forgetting\nabout his &#39;orders&#39;, he walks off toward Iron Raptor, reaching her and\nsniffing at her privates, much like a dog does to get to know another\ndog.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Hey Yan, your weight has nothing to do with how fast you \n&gt; fall, it depends on how big you are (in other words, bigger=slower \n&gt; due to air resistance) =P\n\n\n"}}
