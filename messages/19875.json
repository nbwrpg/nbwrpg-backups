I can FEEL it, living, like \ncrawling like a slimy mass in the back of my mind!! Maybe...Iris will know. \nShe was part of my programming for years, she HAS to know something about \nthis!&quot;\n\n* And with that she whipped around, and started down the hall at a dead run, \ngoing down to all fors in mid-stride to increase her speed.\nIron Raptor disappeared down the hall before she could give Prowl the chance \nto chase after her. But she called back, her rough voice echoing over the \nwalls.*\n\n&quot; Stay here, that&#39;s an order!&quot;\n\n* There was no sign of Striker and she somehow knew that he wasn&#39;t going to \nbe seen around the Maximals anymore, so the only bot Prowl had left to take \norders from was either Kluster or herself. And even though she was unable to \ntransform, that didn&#39;t mean that she was removed of her command.\n\nShe ran down the halls as fast as she could, her claws pounding away at the \narmored floor as she headed for the back exit, her intended \ndestination...the Ark.*\n\n__________________________IRIS\n\n* There was something wrong besides the fact that the Ark was almost \ncompletely gone, something...black. Like a gathering of stormy clouds on the \nedge of a blue sky.\nHowever...this was something seriouse. But she knew what it was without even \nhaving to guess.\nThey had merged, her beast modes...and they were refusing to let the logic \ntake complete control...not allowing her to TF into robot mode.\nAnd she was on her way to the Ark, for the answer to the question Iris knew \nshe would ask.\nAnd the strange thing was, Iris knew that this would happen, it was only a \nmatter of time.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
