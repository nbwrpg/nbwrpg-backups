He growled, baring his pure white teeth and turned to them. \nHe \n&gt; let the connected chains on his clash sword go limp, to it&#39;s whip \n&gt; mode. He raised his arm and struck it at one. He turned and struck \n&gt; another off-line. \n&gt; \n&gt; They weren&#39;t all off-line. He withdrew his gun and fired at the \nrest, \n&gt; smashing the autoguns. He turned his head back to the hallway, \nwhere \n&gt; he saw Apocolypse. He growled down at him. He reverted his clash \n&gt; sword back to its tightly connected mode, where the bladed chains \n&gt; curved upward.\n&gt; \n&gt; He snarled at him and charged.\n\n\n"}}
