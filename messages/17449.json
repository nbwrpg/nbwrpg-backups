Her circuits started up \nand power flowed through her.  Her body twitched and jumped as it \nstarted to come on line.  Her programs that still were active started \nto react to the new board.  The board, had wiped out her memory \ncompletely.  But her back up memory chips uploaded her bio-techno \nengineering, programming skills and repair abilities. She clentch her \nfist and then relaxed her hand.  She slowly opened her eyes and \nlooked around.  She saw Zardus and then looked around the room \nagain.  &quot;What&#39;s going on? Who are you? Where am I?&quot;  then she closed \nher eyes and realized what she couldn&#39;t remember. &quot;Who am I?\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Yo, KSL, the bot in the CR chambers is Voluis.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus lets go of the main proccessor, flipping a switch to \nactivate it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hopefully this will work..&quot; he says, watching a console and \nSquizzy \n&gt; carefully.\n\n\n"}}
