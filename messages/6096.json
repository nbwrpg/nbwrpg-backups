Puts a CD in the computer record this fight\nI\n&gt; &gt; need to gather all the data on the other fighter.&quot;  Tigerhawk Spins\naround\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; the command chair &quot;Heres the plan in 2 steps. &quot;Tigerhawk Pulls up layout\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; Zardus ship. &quot;odds are that the alliances holding cell are here a red\n&gt; light\n&gt; &gt; goes off in the center of the ship.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Step.1 Autoguns and shields.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Me and the Radicons can generate a high enough energy level to Draw off\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; autoguns. While Archangel will break through the shields&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tigerhawk Tosses a weird shaped grenade to Archangel &quot;this Pure Water a\n&gt; &gt; device which a hole in the shield pure water is water with the\n&gt; electrolytes\n&gt; &gt; removed so it cannot carry electricity and a shield energy is mostly\n&gt; &gt; electricity so it will give you some time to get in.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Step.2  Split into teams and search the ship.\n&gt; &gt; Get Iron and hall ass back here and get ready to defend against a\ncounter\n&gt; &gt; attack. Hands all the people going a holocube\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This our chance to get the preds and alliance fighting each cube will\n&gt; make\n&gt; &gt; us look like a pred of your choice. Tigerhawk turns on his cube and\nlooks\n&gt; &gt; like hellbeast.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Computer &quot;pred  alert pred alert autoguns online.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tigerhawk cut off the cube &quot;It will mask out energy signals.
