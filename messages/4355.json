The reason why her voice did so was not known to him, his mind to warped from the pain and too tired to confirm the question just slipped back into the shadows of his mind.\nWith the slight ease of pain he removed his claw from his palm, his own mech fluid running down the smooth surface to drip off of the tip and eventually mark it�s place upon the ground. The fact that he was covered in fluid not phasing him a bit but leaving dark splotches upon the ground as he passed, not even having enough sense left to care that he had lost over 45% of his fluids already.\nDinobot closed his optics for a moment to steady his systems for a weak scan, the fuzzy and flickering screens revealing that his repair system was now operational and his body needing major reconstruction due to the damage.\nHe sighed with a bit of strain in his voice and a bit of annoyance as well, never before had he ever been so damaged except for when he had been wounded years ago in some hominid valley�in which he had died from.\nBut thanks to his Transmetal 2 form he was no able to sustain damage he never even dreamed that he could live through�within reason of course.\nHe then re-opened his optics but was not surprised to see the Ark doors right in front of them, then glad that now he would be able to repair without any interruptions or intrusions.\nThe groan from Tavatron almost seemed to create another sense of hostile regret in the air, obviously sensed by him despite his damages. He never did like to see the bad tempered side of the female warrior but as she put up with him he was inclined to put up with her, a mutual understanding between two soldiers stuck in the same war.\nThe words from Tavatron�s throat brought him back into the realm of the conscious as he then heard her thank him for saving her life, lost in thinking about how long the Beast Wars would last until one victor survived and whom that victor would be before hearing the sound of her voice.\nDinobot growled at the slight show of sentiment but then dismissed it, apparently that was her way of simply say that he had done a good job in assuring that she survived�hoping that she would do the same for him of the rolls were reversed. But he simply listened to her sentence before it ended and left nothing but the sound of their steps on the base floor�having moved inside when Tavatron had opened the door for both of them. He began to feel light headed and tired, the obvious signs of lose of fluids�and the extensive damage.\nBut even that feeling did not stop him from simply nodding slightly before his internal systems warned him that it would be best to transform into beast mode before continuing, then stopping in his tracks as a wave of dizziness passed over him with a wave of nausea as well.\nWith the intake of a deep breath he forced the sickening feeling back down into his stomach where it had developed and loosened his grip on Tavatron�s shoulder-plate.\nHis voice a bit strained and quiet as he spoke�*\n\n� I would�expect nothing more then the�same from you.�\n\n* His circuits gave a second warning as he soon began to feel his equilibrium failing (balance) and hung his head, now leaning against Tavatron more then ever.\nDinobot knew that he would rather convert into beast mode then go into one of those CR chambers again, they seeming to cause nothing more then threatening nightmares in which he had no escape from until the repair was complete�something in which he did not enjoy.\nCommon sense told him that transforming into his beast mode and resting fully would slowly regenerate his systems, that factor much more appealing to him since he could wake up from any nightmares in which haunted his sleep.\nWith a second and more heavy sigh Dinobot then let go of Tavatron completely, standing unsteadily on his own as he prepared for the painful transformation into a more comfortable mode.\nA snarl of pain was heard just as he gave the activation code to convert but nothing more then silence when he had then fully transformed.\nNow in his steel beast mode the pain lessened even further and a breath of slight relief was heard from his snout, with a more steady foot he then stepped forwards but the nausea, dizziness, and exhaustion was still there.\nDinobot looked over towards Tavatron, seeing her damage he then pointed to her side as he then sensed the internal damage with his beast senses. *\n\n� It may not be my place to say so�but it may be wise�for you to do the same as I.�\n\n* In other words, he was saying that she was wiser to transform then to let the damage stay and continue to pain. But she may have already thought of that but had not done it.\nBut then with a tired and rather sluggish movement he then began to move off towards a secluded part of the ship where he knew that there would be no intrusions if his systems were so bent on sleeping. It would be wise for Tavatron to do the same but it was up to her, besides, all he was going to do was sleep.\nDinobot moved out of the same room as the CR chambers and rounded a corner, then suddenly coming across a vent that happened to be turned on and expelling warm air he began to move off towards it. His systems were cold due to the temp lose caused by the lose of fluid and he needed to gain that warmth back, his body just beginning to shiver on it�s own as he reached the vent and then settled down in front of it. His body simply flopping down in front of the vent, not caring to curl up for more warmth�just plain tired.\nWith the exiting of a final deep breath Dinobot then closed his eyes and laid there, the silent shivers still convulsing through his body at a regular basis. The vent was helping but it was not enough, now too deep in sleep to worry about it.\n If anything�he needed to be warm! *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
