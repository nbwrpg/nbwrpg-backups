In our fandom of Transformers and wrestling. You are\nthe only person who agreed with me on everything to do with wrestling.\nThank you for your compliments on my RPGing skills, and for your support\nin the Council election. I&#39;ll miss your contributions to NBW. I intend\nto stay in contact. I&#39;ll email you after RAW. Good bye!\n\n&gt; Vincent Price wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Ah, OOC, I&#39;m as formal as ever. Well? Surprised by the title?\n&gt; Well, I guess that it had to come to this eventually. I know I&#39;ve said\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll be with this RPG through thick and thin!&quot; but then I thought\n&gt; about it and realized what I had said and wondered...Why? Why should I\n&gt; stay in an RPG that I just do not find as fun as I used to. Why should\n&gt; I stay in an RPG when I&#39;m not even interested in Transformer&#39;s\n&gt; anymore, unless their G1. And why should I stay with an RPG like NBW\n&gt; when I have as much fun as I do in my own RPG,\n&gt; http://www.dbzsf.vze.com &lt;Shameless self promotion. I know nobody will\n&gt; miss me, probably, because nobody ever really liked my posts. So, like\n&gt; Alloran, and Zardus, and Jer, and Lurker, and many other greats before\n&gt; me, I&#39;m retiring. Sorry it had to come to this. Let&#39;s see here, what\n&gt; should I say in my speech? Well, here it comes.\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, thank you Alloran. You were what kept me in NBW over the\n&gt; times, and all, and you were always fair to me and even became my\n&gt; friend when I yelled out a horrible &quot;SCREW YOU!&quot; Which was just wrong\n&gt; of me, it really was. Alloran, I treasured the times we used to make\n&gt; fun of Liono and the things we used to say about JP! Oh, man! I had\n&gt; fun, true fun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lurker, you are one of my greatest friends, too. At first I didn&#39;t\n&gt; understand you, but then I realized that we were so much alike that we\n&gt; were meant to be friends. It&#39;s a twist of fate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jer, you da man! There, in your own words, even, Jer. You sure did\n&gt; make me feel bad for not talking to you in a while when you put me at\n&gt; the top of your mail. Well, you are one of the ELITE man. Seriously.\n&gt; It&#39;s great to be your friend. JUME!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff, you were one of the greatest moderators this RPG has ever seen.\n&gt; Your brand of fairness and punishment is unrivaled by any of the voted\n&gt; on Moderators. You were also a good friend, and I also had fun talking\n&gt; with you.\n&gt; \n&gt; RoboRick, you are similar to me in several ways. Except your RPGing\n&gt; skills were never as crappy as mine started out as. HAW! But really,\n&gt; it&#39;s fun talking to you and if you win your bid for Council Member,\n&gt; well, congratulations, you deserve it. You are a good RPGer, and I\n&gt; hope that you have fun while I&#39;m gone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus, you, I&#39;ve had a very unusual relationship with. I first really\n&gt; met you when you called me an idiot for having Sinesis sweep up  your\n&gt; guy, who was it? I can&#39;t remember now, but the point is, that we soon\n&gt; became friends. If it was not for Zardus, I would never be the RPGer I\n&gt; am today, he showed me the way to do things, and I&#39;ll never go back to\n&gt; the ALL CAPS NO SPACES NO PARAGRAPHS NO SENSE guy I was before. I\n&gt; mean, I could only think about myself until I received the ultimate\n&gt; tutor in Zardus. Besides that, Zardus was always fair to me, helping\n&gt; me out when I had problems with other RPGers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyberwolf, Airly, you 2 are cool with me. Cyberwolf takes the RPG very\n&gt; seriously, and is a great RPGer. Airly, you&#39;ve been great, a good\n&gt; friend. I&#39;m sure the 2 of you can keep NBW alive in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; Logo: I don&#39;t really know what to say, besides that you were a great\n&gt; friend. I&#39;m sorry I never got one of my characters in a relationship\n&gt; with one of yours. Truly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, Minime_316. Thanks. RIP my friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I guess that&#39;s it. Anyone who wishes to keep in contact with me\n&gt; can e-mail me at my god awful e-mail address, thecode@... Now,\n&gt; for a list! A list of every character I&#39;ve ever had in this RPG!
