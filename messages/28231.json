The armor \ncould take alot more than just that.\n\nHis shoulder missile launcher fires two energy seeking missiles at \nVehement, his EMP rifle firing three shots.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven took all three blasts, nearly falling backwards but regaining \nhis balance. He sets one of his missile launchers to seeking, firing \ntwo normal missiles from one gun and two energy seeking missiles from \nthe other, all at Sun Crusher.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer lands on the ground, the missiles flying over his head. He \ngrowls, two missile launchers flipping out of his shoulders and \naiming at Reflector. They both fire two missiles, the missiles \nlocking onto Reflector&#39;s propulsion system and flying toward it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm&#39;s jetpack takes him out of the way of Menasor&#39;s attack, the \nMaximal looking down at the stump of his leg and evaluating the \nmechfluid loss.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ smiles, looking behind him. Unicron seemed to be distracted by \nother bots. He spins around, firing two of his missiles (the energy-\ndraining ones) at Unicron.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster gets up, coughing again. The stinkin&#39; ash wasn&#39;t good for his \nlungs. He aims his missile launcher, firing two missiles at Menasor&#39;s \nhead, the only object he could easily see through the still-thich ash \naround the area where the shuttle had hit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (Icedemon, you posted that your shot exploded and formed a bubble \naround me, \n&gt; that is moding.  You had Rattrap fire two shots, and then 25 rapid \nshots.  \n&gt; That is a total of 27 shots, two shots over the limit)\n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron/Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector/Shockwave/Demon Wulf/Dark \nClaw/Flesh\n&gt; Ripper/Streetwise/Groove:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron saw a bolt coming, and fired off two optic blasts before it \nwas \n&gt; several feet away from Angel Prime.  Flying up quickly, he avoided \nmost of \n&gt; the shots fired on him but two plasma charges hit him square in the \nchest \n&gt; knocking him back a foot in mid air, the robot only laughing.\n&gt; \n&gt; He fired off five rapid optic blasts at Rattrap and raised both \narms, \n&gt; launching an energy-signature seeking missile at Starwind from one, \nand a \n&gt; missile of the same type at Angel Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement dodged the EMP blasts and a missile, the other exploding \nagainst his \n&gt; chest armor but not piercing it.  He sighed as his chest singed \npainfully, \n&gt; raising an arm and launching an energy-signature seeking missile at \nKillfest, \n&gt; followed by a single optic blast.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher gained altitude rapidly, escaping two missiles, the ion \ndisks, \n&gt; and the fireballs, two optic blasts intercepting one missile, the \nother \n&gt; knocking Sun Crusher backwards in the air a few feet.  He raised a \nwrist, the \n&gt; cannon attached to it firin three fusion blasts at Greven.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector watched Endbringer land and jump into the air in \nReflector&#39;s \n&gt; direction, but didn&#39;t even get close since Reflector was around a \nhundred \n&gt; feet up.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;These heathens grow dumber by the day.&quot; he laughed, raising a \nwrist and \n&gt; firing down two missiles at the Predacon scum.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf almost fell because of Streetwise&#39;s precise shots, but \nhe growled \n&gt; and fired off three optic blasts at the Maximal&#39;s sternum.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper felt the blasts strike and laughed at Groove, forming \nan orb of \n&gt; energy in his left palm with the equal power of a grenade and \nthrowing it at \n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw felt a fireball strike him, but in his heavily armored \nmode it \n&gt; didn&#39;t do any harsh damage.  He launched four missiles off at the \nCF.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Streetwise yelled out, the grenade-like orb sending him flying back \nin the \n&gt; air and crashing to his back, a small hole in his cheset armor.  He \ncoughed \n&gt; up some mech-fluid and began gathering strength to get up, until \nthe rapid \n&gt; blasts from Shockwave pierced into his already wounded chest.  \nGetting up \n&gt; wasn&#39;t on his mind for now.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; The force of the optic blasts twirled Groove, who let out a sigh of \nanger and \n&gt; ducked down, firing of two photon blasts at Demon Wulf&#39;s right knee \njoint, \n&gt; and three optic blasts up at Shockwave.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave rolled in the air, avoiding the laser blasts, and \nlaunched two \n&gt; missiles down at the Cybertronian Fire, soon followed by twenty-\nfive rapid \n&gt; laser blasts.\n\n\n"}}
