That will put our numbers under, though. Man, \nI don&#39;t know why everyone who can&#39;t find a use for a char, wants them \nkilled. You just wait around and leave them alone until an \nopportunity rises. Look at what Logo did with Goldeneye. She had been \nsitting on the shelf for weeks, and suddenly Dollen appears and she&#39;s \nright back into it with a great storyline. If she had killed \nGoldeneye, none of it would&#39;ve happened! Oh, and Robo, can I use K9&#39;s \nscrap pieces? I have an idea for them.\n\nTrainers\n\nPrebon smiled as he kissed Spears.\n\n&quot;How about me go outside and throw a little victory party, just the \ntwo of us?&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Hammer laughed rejoicely(is that a word?) to himself. He \nsent a message to Prebon.\n\n&quot;Sir, that Maxi won&#39;t be following us any more. He didn&#39;t even last a \nproper fight.&quot;\n\nHe walked over to the rubble of what was left.\n\n&quot;Hey...with proper adjustments, this could just work for Bullet&#39;s \nplan! I&#39;ve got to get these back to base!&quot;\n\n(I won&#39;t continue till Robo gives the okay.)\n\n\n"}}
