She turned over \nand transformed into wolf mode in her sleep.  She moaned and muttered \nin her sleep, tossed and turned as her mind reeled in visions that \nwould make Unicron scared. \n\nShe finally woke up and got out of bed.  She stretched her front paws \nout and arched her back.  She walked out of her room and was about to \ngo to the mess hall. She stopped dead in her tracks as her optics \nwidened with the a thought. &quot;I didn&#39;t go to bed last night. I was in \nthe lab. How in the pit did I make it to my room if I never left the \nlab?&quot;  She went back to her room. She could sniff the scent of Malice \nstill lingering on the side of the bed where he brushed up putting \nher on it. She grinned and starting back to the mess hall. &quot;Uh huh, \nyeah, he&#39;s a softy alright. But I won&#39;t let him know that I know \nthat.&quot;  She muttered to herself.  She went to the mess hall and \ntransformed into bot mode. She got herself some hot energon and sat \ndown at a table, trying to wake up.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice was jolted awake from Campflage&#39;s sream, and fell off his \nbed with a very loud thud.  He picked himself up off the floor and \nstood up too fast, stumbled a second, then went out the door.  He \nwent looking for Camoflage, but was unsucessful.  He then found \nWolfblade fast asleep at a work bench.  He picked her up and took her \nto his quarters.  He set he on the bed and retrieved the generator \nshe was working on.  He set it on the night stand, and went to the \ncargo bay.  He found a cargo net strong enough to support his \nweight.  He took it back to his quarters, string it up as a hammock, \ngrabbed the alarm clock, climbed into the hammock, hit the lights, \nand went to sleep.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:Wolfblade:\n&gt; She yawned and kept working.  Her energy levels were dropping and \nshe \n&gt; would need to sleep soon. Still, she faught it off and kept \nworking. \n&gt; After a bit, she went to the other bench and grabbed a stool to sit \n&gt; on. She sat down and kept working. In a few hours, she was leaning \n&gt; over the magnet, sound asleep. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Malice yawned and patted Wolfblade on her shoulder.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;See you in a few cycles.  If you do get tired, talk to Kup or \n&gt; someone, they should set you up with a room.  Goodnight.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Malice walked down some halls and found his way to his temporary \n&gt; quarters.  He opened the door and stepped in.  He sat down on the \n&gt; edge of the bed, and sat quiet for a moment.  then he pulled the \n&gt; energon storage and put it on top of the locker.  He opened the \n&gt; locker and snapped off another chunk of energon.  He leaned back on \n&gt; the bed, crunching on the energon.  He finished it, found an alarm \n&gt; clock, set it, and went to sleep.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She worked trying to put together the magnet and improve it to \nwork \n&gt; &gt; for it&#39;s purpose. &quot;No thanks. I&#39;m not tired. I have work to \ndo.&quot;Her \n&gt; &gt; voice was short and curt.  She then looked up at Malice and said \nin \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; softer tone, &quot;I can&#39;t blame you. I&#39;d have done the same thing. I \n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t admit it though.&quot;  She looked back at the table and \n&gt; resumed \n&gt; &gt; her work. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
