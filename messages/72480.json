They were confisca=\r\ncted from me when I was brought here.  &quot;\n\nHe gives a careful listen to ever=\r\nything around him and then turns his attentions back to his comrades.\n\n&quot;  R=\r\nemember, please leave Rodimus up to me, and be sure you escape safely.  He&#39;=\r\ns my responsibility, and I have to deal with him myself.  I trust he is wel=\r\nl trained but perhaps not as in depth as I was.  He will cheat in ways you =\r\nmay find unfathomable.  I have prepared for the unexpected and know how to =\r\nconfront it.  Now, let&#39;s do this while we still can.&quot;\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tuc=\r\nson looks to Night Viper with a somewhat commanding stare.  Of course it\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; was all in jest but he couldn&#39;t help play the part of a formidable predat=\r\nor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Excuse me Night Viper but, do you always talk to a Prime in t=\r\nhat manner?\n&gt; &gt; FYI , my full name is TUCSON PRIME, not tall and scaly.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; He gives him the draconic grin .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Just so you know for futur=\r\ne reference.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; NIGHT VIPER spins around to face TUSCON, he had not been=\r\n talking to\n&gt; him at the time but about him, but the point stood. &quot;Yes sir,=\r\n your\n&gt; Primeship, of course.&quot; He saluted him with a smile. &quot;It won&#39;t happe=\r\nn\n&gt; again suh!&quot; He said.\n&gt; \n&gt; About that time BIG CONVOY came out of the tu=\r\nnnel that exited high up\n&gt; on the hallway&#39;s wall. He landed on the floor, w=\r\nhile not nearly as\n&gt; gracefully as that of NIGHT VIPER and perhaps TUSCON, =\r\nbut his bulk\n&gt; made little noise as it came down. More of a combat landing,=\r\n but it\n&gt; was solid enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking around he glanced at the scene, LO=\r\nNG RACK and the rest loking\n&gt; at TUSCON PRIME and NIGHT VIPER, the latter s=\r\ntanding at attention\n&gt; saluting the former. He shook his head, &quot;You got the=\r\n stash ready?&quot; He\n&gt; said looking over at LONGRACK.\n&gt; \n&gt; The tall yet slimly=\r\n built second officer nodded, &quot;Of course, right\n&gt; here boss.&quot; He said, hold=\r\ning out a rather large case to him. He nodded\n&gt; over at TUSCON, &quot;What about=\r\n the Prime?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll handle it.&quot; CONVOY said as he turned to look at TUS=\r\nCON.\n&gt; \n&gt; Openeing the case there were two missile racks which he carefully=\r\n slid\n&gt; on each shoulder, increasing his bulk for a moment before they fold=\r\ned\n&gt; into his shoulders, and he picked up a rather large looking cannon and=\r\n\n&gt; hefted it experimantally. He nodded, satisfied.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tuscon Prime.&quot; BIG=\r\n CONVOY said, emphasising the &#39;Prime&#39; part of\n&gt; TUSCON&#39;s name presumably fo=\r\nr the benfit of the others, &quot;You need any\n&gt; sort of weaponry or armaments b=\r\nefore we move on?&quot; He glanced up at the\n&gt; grating they had just come out of=\r\n, he closed it with the tip of his\n&gt; cannon.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I would suspect they wil=\r\nl soon discover our ruse.&quot; He looked at\n&gt; TUSCON directly, &quot;I need to know =\r\nif you&#39;re ready? This is going to get\n&gt; really messy really fast.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TA=\r\nG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
