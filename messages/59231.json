He decided to go to Earth in person, Matrix \nor no Matrix. With the energon of that world, he would be able to \nempower his Minions and create a Gestalt-sized army to rule the \nuniverse.\n\nHis reactors began throbbing mutely, but soon, he advanced, his \nthousands of minions following around him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Bloodblade, orbiting Earth disguised as a pod, got a confirmation \n&gt; that Rockseeker and Lunekill were both terminated. Reluctantly, he \n&gt; decided to warn his Master.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bloodblade: Master Unicron, Rockseeeker and Lunekill have just been \n&gt; terminated.\n&gt; \n&gt; The response was immediate and terrible. He was attacked both in \nhis \n&gt; body and in his spark, even though his Lord was at the other end of \n&gt; the system. Tendrils of electricity shook him, causing \ninterferences \n&gt; that could be picked up from Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the middle of his agony, he heard a thundrous voice inside his \n&gt; head.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron: Incompetent Minions! They have failed me. Now, Bloodblade, \n&gt; it is your turn to go, but I have learned from this.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the pain stopped, he had forgotten who he was or who he \nserved. \n&gt; He only remembered his name. He started spinning wildly as he \nentered \n&gt; high orbit and was attracted to the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few minutes later, he crashed loudly into the ground, exactly at \n&gt; the same distance from the three bases.\n\n\n"}}
