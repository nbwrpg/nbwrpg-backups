That was\nthe end of a tyrant. Phobias logic circuits stepped in, if Megatron was that\nweak he would have been wiped out sooner. Regaurdless to say, This megatron\nwas gone, Inferno and company were defeated, it was a victory.\n\nHe looked toward KitKat,&quot; If Megatron lives we need to act before he can\ncounter, if he&#39;s dead there will be at least a dozen Preds coming after the\nbot that destroyed him. Either way we don&#39;t have time to waste, we have to\nact now.&quot;  He says exploiting the opportunity to achieve his goals.\n\n . &quot;KitKat, Destructor has a base with the technology to run the tests you\nneed, send Drillbit back to run the tests while we advance.&quot; One bot\nwouldn&#39;t make a difference in the battles to come, and with Drillbit out of\nthe way there wouldn&#39;t be anything holding KitKat back.\n\nHellbeast arrived on the scene, Phobia was glad that none of them were\nseriously hurt in the battle, they might need thier strength. he stepped\ntoward Hellbeast, &quot;Why may I ask are you so intent on collecting a sample?&quot;\nthere had to be a reason that he himself would go, instead of sending a\nlackey.\n\n(Speaking of Lackeys) WAspinator arrived following HellBeast toward the\nbody. Now Phobia knew something was amiss. The tyrant had just been\neliminated and now everyone was ariving for body parts. Phobia decided to\nmake an example of someone to show that KitKat&#39;s faction was not to be taken\nlightly, he looked Waspinator in the eye and fired optic blasts from all\neight eyes.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, October 10, 2000 5:20 AM\nSubject: Re: time to attack\n\n\n&gt; OK, I ,by the grace of the matrix, got my home comupter working for\n&gt; the moment.

She threw it and watched it come to\n&gt; rest right between Megatron&#39;s feet.  She then smiled and looked at\n&gt; Phobia. &quot;RUN!
