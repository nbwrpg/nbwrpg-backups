Peeking his head out he looked down the face\nof\n&gt; the outside base and dug his claws in slowly scaling downwards towards the\n&gt; ground far below.

Smiling he continued on down the ground almost within\nleaping range as his metallic claws dug into the plating of the ships hull,\nhis eyes cautious and always watching, it wouldn&#39;t do for a turret to spring\nout and start firing and be caught unawares.\n\n    Only a few more feet then he could transform and head north, from his\ninternal scanners he watched the cluster of signatures around this place and\nnoted more active signals back at the ruins of the Maximal City. First down,\nhe chided himself, then switch codes and go meet your maximal &quot;brothers&quot;.\nThe feral grin returned to his face plate and he couldn&#39;t suppress the\nchuckle. Hopefully they&#39;d prove a bit more difficult than this base...\n\n\n"}}
