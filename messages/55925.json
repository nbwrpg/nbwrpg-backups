She \nwas using her hightened hearing and sonic wave hear what was being \nsaid about the room. So far, other than Flicker showing her no trust, \nwhich was expected from a pred, she didn&#39;t find a clue to \nNightlight&#39;s where abouts. She wasn&#39;t going ot give up yet. She \nlooked at Flicker. &quot;So how many of us are there. I over heard some \nbots talking earlier about getting the slag kicked out of them from \nthe maximals in a previous battle. I hope this will not be the case \nin the future? I do not wish to be imprisioned again by those weak \nsparked, waste of metal fools.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
