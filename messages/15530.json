He leaps \noff \n&gt; the beast, and most of the shots hit his thick hide. He yells in \n&gt; pain. Prebon calls to everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright, order time! Ignatius, you take bot one(Bluestreak, see \n&gt; Alloran this time I remembered). Bullet, bot two!(Andromena) \nHammer, \n&gt; bot three!(Ratchet) Blaze, take the other cat.(Logo&#39;s ice cat, \nforget \n&gt; name) I&#39;ll take the porcupine.(Spears)&quot; Prebon looked around for \nbots \n&gt; that Savage could take. Than he spotted him. The bot that Savage \nhated\n&gt; (Striker).\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Savage! There he is! Attack him!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Savage stampeded towards Striker, firing two fireballs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignatius landed infront of Bluestreak\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;See ya....Ignatius transform!&quot; The eagle went to bot mode and \nfired \n&gt; off two plasma shots at Bluestreak.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bullet, already transformed, landed infront of Andromena. Never one \n&gt; for words, Bullet simply drew his gaitling gun and fired 150 shots.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hammer, Prebon&#39;s second-in-command, ran up to Ratchet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You know...there&#39;s a reason they call me Hammer....(No, not \nbecause \n&gt; he has a hammer)&quot; Hammer leaped into the air and came down with a \n&gt; kick to Ratchet&#39;s chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blaze transformed to meet the snow cat.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Cat fight....&quot; She pulled out the flame thrower and started to \nburn \n&gt; the leopard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon gazed into Spears&#39; eyes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You should feel honoured. You and your friends will be the very \n&gt; first bots on this planet defeated by the Trainers!&quot; He opened his \n&gt; palm blasters and fired 3 shots at Spears.\n\n\n"}}
