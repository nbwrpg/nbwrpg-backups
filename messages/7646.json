She lifted \nthe ball out and then began to continue towards the new Maximal base, \nholding the ball in her hands in front of her stomach. *\n\n� That should be a bit better.�\n\n* She then heard Perndabot, thinking about his question very carefully. He \nwas too big to get inside the base undetected, maybe a lookout�or cover for \nher escape if something happened.\nBrightBlade smiled at her last thought, back up would be perfect for him.\nShe then looked behind her just in time to see Perndabot duck and avoid \nanother tree, noting that she was probably a fairly noticeable distraction.\nBrightBlade chuckled as she then turned back to face ahead of her. *\n\n� I�ll go in alone while you wait as back up outside for when I exit.

And Perndabot would come right in handy \nif it came to that.*\n\n� That�s if you�don�t mind?�\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
