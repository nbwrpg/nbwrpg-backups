He listens intently \nto Ironhide&#39;s speech. He is silent as he takes in the unsettling \ninformation. He approaches the Speakers podium, clears his throat \nand begins his speech, &quot;I, I am ready to accept your charge to me. \nI feel that I have trained long for this task, and will strive to \ncomplete it as diplomatically as possible,&quot; he sighs, &quot;but I doubt \nthat the possibility of a quiet end will ever occur.&quot; He pauses for \nmeasure, &quot;I have almost completed the selectioning process. I \nhave chosen up till this time: Jazz, JetV, Crossroads, Trailblazer, \nMetalwarhawk, Gold bug, and just recently, Artemis. All of these \nbots I feel are suited for the mission, and their skills would be vital \nto our success. Do any council members disagree with my \nchoices?&quot; Pacifix steps down to await the Council.\n\n\n\n\nOn 15 May 2001, at 18:51, robertdahl wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Okay everyone, I am really letting the creative juices flow here.\n&gt; If some of this dosent work with your characters or stories in the\n&gt; RPG, just say that it is a different time than which your character\n&gt; came from. :) Also all the Autobots in this scene have been remade\n&gt; smaller for fuel reasons. Also for a note, Ironhide has been remade\n&gt; from the Matrix, and due to his history, he is one of the main\n&gt; characters.  Here we go.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; The massive iron doors Pacifix walks up too open up, the gears\n&gt; grinding, and it leads into an enormous chambre, well light by energon\n&gt; powered lights. The room is a large dome, with many chairs and tables\n&gt; where a hundred Autobots sit. Most of the Autobots were given this\n&gt; high privelage for the name they made during one of the great wars.\n&gt; Painted all over are the symbols of Maximal, Predacon, and Autobot. In\n&gt; the centre, over the highest stand, is a large image of the Autobots\n&gt; greatest Hero, Optimus Prime. All along the walls there are pictures\n&gt; of legends who have ceased to exist, and died for the cause. Brawn&#39;s\n&gt; face is at one end, Ratchet and Prowl at another, Ironhide at one\n&gt; corner, surrounded by many Autobots that preexist them. One though,\n&gt; that is very famous, Alpha Trion. In the centre of all the podiums is\n&gt; an energon fountain. It harmoneusly gushes a soft pink energy, that\n&gt; gives the room a light pink colour.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a large hush over the crowd, as a red old Autobot, at the top\n&gt; and centre of the room stands up. He then begins to speak, and the\n&gt; other Autobots follow his every word. &quot;Greetings Pacifix&quot; he says in a\n&gt; rough deep voice. The Autobot Ironhide&#39;s voice can be heard by all. He\n&gt; speaks with wisdom, and kind words. To his right and left, standing\n&gt; behind him are Sunstreaker and Sideswipe, his body guards. To his\n&gt; right sitting down is his peer, the old Autobot known as Kup, who\n&gt; watches all of this with an unussually sense of calmness. Beside him\n&gt; is the once human, now robot Spike. A few more recognizable Autobots\n&gt; sit around. &quot;As you know&quot; Ironhide continues, &quot;We have finally\n&gt; achieved what we set out to millions of years ago. Peace&quot; he says,\n&gt; every robot in the room nodding at the last word. &quot;But it is an uneasy\n&gt; peace, for even though we have all but stopped the Decepticons, we\n&gt; have reasons to believe their decendants, the Predacons, do not follow\n&gt; this peace willfully&quot; he says in a grave tone. &quot;We even have strong\n&gt; evidence that points to the fact that they have released Decepticon\n&gt; war Criminals from confinment, to try to change time on the planet\n&gt; Earth&quot; he says, thinking back to that time, four million years ago,\n&gt; when the Ark, and Nemesis crash landed on the planet, bringing to it\n&gt; their million year Strugle. He remembers the battles they had there,\n&gt; and how it helped turn the tide of War for the Autobots. &quot;We sent a\n&gt; scouting ship to earth already, with two Autobot Veterans. They have\n&gt; not made contact with us however, and their ship is not emmiting a\n&gt; signal. We fear the Predacons may be on to us. That is why we have\n&gt; summoned you Pacifix. The Predacons will not notice if a rookie\n&gt; commander goes missing, but we have reason to believe you are the\n&gt; perfect leader for this mission. We also know that one of your friends\n&gt; was in that scout ship, and understand you will most likely want to\n&gt; retrieve him. We have faith in your Pacifist reasoning, and think you\n&gt; would best represent us. We have already selected a few Autobot\n&gt; veterans to go with you, and we understand you are also putting a crew\n&gt; of you own together&quot; Ironhide says, pausing for Pacifix to respond.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
