Problem is \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; my personal point of view, that regarding that she&#39;s \n&gt; reprogramed... \n&gt; &gt; she won&#39;t came here voluntary, even perhaps she would try to \n&gt; resist \n&gt; &gt; and fight...

That lead us to other point: \n&gt; &gt; after the capture, what should we do?
