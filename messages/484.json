But she endures it, knowing Carnage wouldn&#39;t want her to get in a scrap with this new clone that was tagging along with them. She looks up at the clone, deciding to call it just plain &#39;Raptor&#39;. Some hidden flare of anger rises, and grows within her. It had started ever since she had seen the fight between them. It had nearly fried her spark just to watch them fight, when she had wanted so badly to rip the Rator apart!* \n\n*Teltoli raises her upper lip in a half snarl and walks over to stand a few feet away from the Raptor*\n\n&quot;Listen, Raptor, the name&#39;s Teltoli, not Maximal. And I am *not* a pet! I may have been quiet for the past few cycles but I was since I didn&#39;t trust you! I may have just arrived on this planet, and I might have had a way easier life than you, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t tell an enemy when I see one!&quot;\n\n*She finishes, breathing hard, and her glittering green eyes alight with anger. Teltoli is almost hoping for a fight. Unusual. Some small part of her mind is surprised at her, she had never been this angry, or not that she could remember. Her memory chip had been knocked out when she landed, erasing everything from her memory. She stands and waits for a response..*\n\n- Teltoli\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
