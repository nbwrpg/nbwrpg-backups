You know you can&#39;t win.*\n\nThe deranged laughter of Tavatron&#39;s darker counterpart resounded through her \naching circuits. There was no escaping it. The rage and anger that \naccompanied each inner breath taunted and teased her as if she were a \nstarving dog. There were times when she yearned for the death and \ndestruction of her former days as an assassin. The praise and fear that \nfollowed her as a younger Predacon had often times been more satisfying than \nthe slow, uncalculated methods of battle as a Maximal. The hot wind that \nblew at her back merely enforced what she already knew. She was not going to \nwin this fight. Tavatron growled softly, her voice was strained and speech a \nluxary she would not be able to afford much longer:\n\n&quot;I-- am fine.&quot;\n\nTavatron pulled herself to her feet. They nearly fell out from beneath her, \nbut she was able to catch herself in time and lean on her staff for \nadditional support. The sensation of dizziness and need to grasp the ground \njust to know she wasn&#39;t falling had passed, but would continue to plague her \nuntil this slagging program was eliminated:\n\n*What are you thinking?*\n\nWas it possible? Had she finally succeeded where all the scientists and \nprogramming specialists had failed? *She* was unable to access part of her \nnueral net. The triumphant sensation of knowing there was still one part of \nher mind that was her own rekindled the dying flame of Tavatron&#39;s hope:\n\n*You&#39;re hiding something. I want to know what! TELL ME!!*\n\nTavatron pulled herself to her feet, thus ceasing her pathetic leaning on \nher staff. She wasn&#39;t some weakling that needed to be nursed back to health. \nShe was a Predacon warrior, and would NOT be defeated by some fiteen year \nold piece of programming. The cool confidence that once surrounded *her* had \nbegun to melt, and with it what little resolve and patience remained:\n\n*TELL ME!!!*\n\nTavtron grimaced and stumbled from the force of such a loud, unescapable \nsound. It was one thing to hear a voice from the outside, to be able to run \nfrom it, even filter through it until only a low hum remained. It was quite \na different experience when that voice was loud enough to fill the halls of \nthe CF, yet contained inside one&#39;s head:\n\n*I&#39;m not a voice. You know that. I&#39;ve got a name.*\n\nTavatron licked her canines as her gaze drifted away from Dinobot and into \nthe distance:\n\n&quot;Shut up...&quot;\n\nHer voice dropped to an inaudible whisper, then again, nothing she ever said \nor did could be hidden from *her*.\n\n&quot;...Tav.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
