Could you at least try, and \nI mean BOTH OF YOU, to calm down a bit and both stop moding? The game \nisn&#39;t who started first, it&#39;s who will be moderated because of all the \npressure the other players are putting on the council! I mean can&#39;t \nyou at least keep your war to private email? I like to see development \nin the storyline, yet you two only seem to bash as hard as you can on \neach other&#39;s char! I am no council member, but I am so fucking tired \nof you two playing against each other and not alongside! And your \nconstant reactions to your comments just make it worse! This message \nis also meant to advise other players thinking that this is getting \nout of hand to take up responsibilities and protest against it. You do \nnot have to do it publicly, but act in some way!\n\nbtw: sorry bout my language...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: If hes locked in a stasis pod he cant. bee then he is fully \noffline \n&gt; unless someone activates his pod.
