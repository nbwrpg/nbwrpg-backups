The ship was\n&gt; &gt; carrying far more passengers than it was designed to, There were 5\n&gt; &gt; seats occupied, three crew quarters, and the cargo bay holding the\n&gt; &gt; escaping predacons.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now came the decision he&#39;d been dreading. &quot;Relay power from the CR\n&gt; &gt; chamber to the engines.&quot; Phobia just hoped that nobody was damaged\n&gt; &gt; critically.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The ship flew skyward as the Predacon cave exploded. Sparks \nerupted\n&gt; &gt; from systems around the bridge. The takeoff saved them from \nfurther\n&gt; &gt; harm. The landing however would be a little tricky.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There happy now?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think my last post may have been unclear.
