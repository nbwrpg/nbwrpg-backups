Smokescreen picks\nher up, and runs off at full speed, both him and Spears cloaked.\n\nRamulus looks over to Prebon and Koj. They had Spears, or almost at \nleast, now they just had to get Striker. Ramulus nearly yelps in \nsurprize as a shot hits him in the back, the Maximal stumbling \nforward, his chest wound almost repaired by his T2 body.\n \n&quot;Big mistake to uncloak, Maximal,&quot; a familiar voice sounds behind \nRamulus. He spins around, his eyes widening when he sees Slayer \nstanding there, also uncloaked.\n\n&quot;Striker! There you are, let&#39;s get out of here!&quot;\n\nSlayer frowns. &quot;I&#39;m afraid you have the wrong bot, Maximal. I am here \nto kill you.&quot;\n\nRamulus sighs, dodging a shot from Slayer. He was starting to get \nannoyed at these chips. The Maximal takes careful aim, firing the \nanti-chip weapon and hitting Slayer in the head.\n\n&quot;There,&quot; he says as Slayer stumbles backwards, Ramulus walking up to \nhim, &quot;Now lets get out of h-&quot;\n\nRamulus is sent flying backwards by a punch from Slayer, swearing as \nhe flips, but managing to land on his feet. He frowns, his scanners \nnot detecting any foreign chip inside Slayer.

She dropped her spears \n&gt; and clutched at her shoulder, putting her hand over the chip. She \n&gt; fell to her knees and screamed out. Her eyes flashed and she fell\nto \n&gt; the ground, going into stasis lock.  The two programs were \ncancelling \n&gt; each other out and shorting out her circuits.
