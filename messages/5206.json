The Radicons, Plintissa, Dracona,=\r\n and Artist all entered the Poeple&#39;s base through the secret passage way, t=\r\nhe computer reconizing them as friends. Train Wreck and Airbomber stepped i=\r\nnto a door.\n\n      &quot;Hey, Stranato, look at this! It&#39;s amazing!&quot; Train Wreck=\r\n called out. Arrow steps out of the CR Chamber all healed up.\n\n      &quot;Yeah,=\r\n it&#39;s got lots of beer and cigars in here, too! and it&#39;s big enough to put =\r\na table in to play cards!

Plintissa =\r\nsealed the door magnetically upon order from Train Wreck, the Radicons were=\r\n locked inside the room to sort out their problems.

Stranato looked at him li=\r\nke he was going to kill him.

Arrow stood up again, and started pa=\r\ncing the room. Stronghold and Blender started to look in cracks in the wall=\r\n for something to drink, despite plenty of water in this room. Train Wreck =\r\nwas discussing something with Arrow and Airbomber, and Stronghold and Blend=\r\ner joined them before long.\n\n      &quot;Say, you guys, it&#39;s really lonely sitti=\r\nng here with nothing to do, and--&quot;\n\n      &quot;Shut up and get your ass over he=\r\nre!
