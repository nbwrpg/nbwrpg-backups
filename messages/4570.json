She gave him a look that said, � And what do you think YOU�RE doing?!� but then shook her head with a quiet laugh and then looked at Plintissa as she came up beside her.\nIron Raptor looked at Plintissa and Dracona, then noting that it seemed that Dracona was very good with gadgets. She would be a fair help in the repair�of course so would be Plintissa. She gestured towards the west point of the Ark with her free hand, the other wrapping around Prowl�s own waist. *\n\n� The west quadrant of the ship is fairly damaged, we need all the help that we can get to repair it.�\n\n* She then looked towards Prowl and then turned her head to look at the two fembots. *\n\n� That�s where WE come in. I need you two to begin reconstruction on the main console, and just as a warning: Don�t mess with the programming otherwise you�ll both have to deal with Iris. OK?�\n\n* She didn�t mean to sound mean if she did but she had to put caution before total trust. With that said she then looked back towards Prowl but then saw something in his expression that looked a little like concern, but not for her�something else. Her own expression was puzzled. Her question of why he was concerned was answered when she heard the charges as well, his own words also verifying that. Iron Raptor marveled in how well Prowl could kiss as their lips met but then reluctantly let go of him as he did her and moved off towards the Ark�s exit, being apart from him never did feel very natural to her.\nAll of a sudden her com-link came alive with Striker�s voice, suddenly puzzled about what he could possibly mean. Then she suddenly remembered the transmission she had gotten just as Prowl had come up and held her, then forgetting it and concentration on the feel of his arm around her.  Her cheeks blushed a little purple (red and blue make purple, red being the blush and blue being her skin/armor), taking her mind off the important things really wasn�t a smart thing to do�though it was her who had taken her mind off of it.\nThe transmission had been serious and she then looked at Plintissa and Dracona. *\n\n� You two go and help repair the base, I have something to deal with.�\n\n* With that she walked off towards the bridge and sees Striker as she enters into the room, a determined but concerned look on her face as she approached a console and activated it. With a fizz the screen came to life, giving a small profile on the bot Octociz but not enough info to go on. She growled and then switched the screen to a more detailed surrounding of the Ark to assess the damage while she thought about the transmission from Bronco. *\n\n� Good, the enemy�s retreating�but the base is still damaged extensively.�\n\n* She looked up at Striker, she almost had no clue as to what to do. There was a bot out there with the need to kill another if they didn�t meet its� needs, it was something that she wasn�t trained for but it was too late for that. There was a problem at hand and she had to deal with it, just another part of being left in charge.\nIron Raptor then deactivated the scan and then looked up at Striker, he was a commander for a lot longer then she has been�what would he do?\nBut then it came to her; it was up to HER to decide what they were gunna do.\nShe then looked around at the bridge but then eased herself down into a near by chair and leaned back, crossing her legs and closing her optics in thought. She had to either give Bronco what he wanted or figure out a way to get Octociz away from him. The bot�s termination was not acceptable! Many ideas ran through her mind, giving Bronco faulty equipment and make him think that it was functional, while then stealing away with Octociz. Maybe working out some other deal for something that wasn�t needed as much, the parts in which he asked for were needed to repair the ship. A tracking comp was all right, that couldn�t be so bad�but not one of their best. But he would have to give them Octociz before he ever got the tracker or what ever else he had asked for. As long as they got him first they would give him the equipment�they were not liars and cheats�and she for one kept her word.\nWith a growl she opened her com-link to Bronco, the opening her optics but kept leaning back against the chair. *\n\n� Bronco! This is Iron Raptor, Maximal third-in-command and acting commander. I�ve received your transmission and I�ll meet you on the cliff. I will be unarmed, I suggest you will be without weapons as well. See you in 5 mega-cycles.�\n\n* With that she then deactivated her communicator and then looked over at Striker, with a simple and calm expression she waved towards him. *\n\n� Care to join me? I might need back up if things go�wrong.�\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
