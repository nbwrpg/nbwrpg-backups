He looked quite peaceful laying there, ye=\r\nt, he appeared to be stirring somewhat. \n\n&quot;Wait a minute, he&#39;s stirring, th=\r\nat means he&#39;s coming around.  That can&#39;t be, he&#39;s supposed to rest for a lo=\r\nnger period of time than that.  What the pit&#39;s bringing him out of... I bet=\r\n he didn&#39;t turn off his com link, that&#39;s what.  C&#39;mon Elita, we better go s=\r\nee why your Uncle Tucson is cutting his stasis time a little short.&quot;\n\nTucso=\r\nn opens his eyes, and with a quiet sigh, he sits up on the table.\nStraight =\r\nShot eyes him and clears her throat.\n\n&quot;Ahem!  You do realize you have not r=\r\nested for the ample amount of time it takes to repair your systems right?&quot;\n=\r\n\nHe nodds.\n\n&quot; I know.  And you&#39;re right, I left my com link on.  I&#39;m all ri=\r\nght though, I think I&#39;ve rested for a reasonable amount of time, just enoug=\r\nh to get through our next crisis.  With most of our comrades in stasis, Rod=\r\nimus is going to need substantial assistance&quot;\n\nHe now gets on his feet.  St=\r\nraight Shot tries to stop him.\n\n&quot;Wait, maybe it&#39;s not such a hot idea.  You=\r\n need your rest.&quot;\n\nTucson smiles.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, really.  Is that Elita wi=\r\nth you? I can hear her.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot chuckles.\n\n&quot;Nothing gets past your =\r\naudio sensors.  It sure is.  Lemme guess, you wanna hold her right?&quot;\n\nHe no=\r\ndds.  And is soon given Elita as he holds her gently in his own arms.  Stra=\r\night Shot smiles as he holds her.  He sits back down with Straight Shot.\n\n&quot;=\r\nYou know, I think you and Talon would make excellent parents.&quot;\n\nTucson smil=\r\nes as he gets up again, and slowly walks out of the room with Straight Shot=\r\n beside him, holding Elita in his arms. \n\n&quot; We&#39;ll see about that..  Right n=\r\now I think she would really like to see her father.  Uncle Tucson can&#39;t tak=\r\ne all the attention away from your dad.&quot;\n\nHe gently rubs her head, and ente=\r\nrs the room where Rodimus is.\n\n&quot; I know what you&#39;ll tell me, and you&#39;re rig=\r\nht, I shouldn&#39;t be out of stasis just yet, but, I couldn&#39;t help thinking ab=\r\nout what would happen if I wasn&#39;t there to lend you support.  Oh, and I tho=\r\nught you might want to say hello to Elita.&quot;\n\nHe smiles as he holds her clos=\r\ne to Rodimus, waiting for him to hold her.\n  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@...=\r\nm, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PErceptor =\r\nscanned Nighlight and said &quot;Her body is all right, she can\n&gt; fuction by her=\r\nself as soon as we bring her back her coma... it&#39;s the mind\n&gt; that worry me=\r\n&quot;and add dryly&quot;this will be your part of the job, Rodimus: when\n&gt; I remove =\r\nthe stasis, she will awake and you will be there... I want to check\n&gt; her r=\r\neaction to... Someone that she is attached of; if all works all right,\n&gt; sh=\r\ne will remember you and we can evaluate her mind... In the worse case\n&gt; sce=\r\nnario, we have to subdue her and set her in statis one more time...

H=\r\ne sat down next to Nightlight, placing\n&gt; his hands on one of hers, taking i=\r\nt into his own.\n&gt; \n&gt; His face was both sad and yet concerned. Would she kno=\r\nw him or remember him?\n&gt; It was as if an eternity had passed since they had=\r\n really been able to spend\n&gt; any time together. The last time he had seen h=\r\ner she really had not\n&gt; remembered him, at least not completely. He wondere=\r\nd now if he would be any\n&gt; help at all. But he knew that no matter what, he=\r\n would be here for her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride heads to Rodimus b=\r\nut is careful not to be too noisy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sir, Straight Shot and I are wo=\r\nrking in Tucson&#39;s lab now, and before we\n&gt; can start, we need to get a geog=\r\nraphical layout of the surrounding\n&gt; parameter. It appears we need a high p=\r\neak of some sort to carry the weight\n&gt; of the wind mill structure. It would=\r\n hide the device from harm, and\n&gt; basically keep the environment the same w=\r\nithout harming it. I&#39;m going to\n&gt; send some mini probes out there to photog=\r\nraph the area. Once I get those\n&gt; back, I&#39;ll be able to draw up something.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: Please keep in mind that Tuscon&#39;s old lab and Wheeljack&#39;s r=\r\noom will be\n&gt; sized for full sized TF&#39;s. Tuscon and the rest have all been =\r\nresized /\n&gt; reformatted for BW&#39;s sized characters. They will be much too sm=\r\nall for most\n&gt; of the tools to be used easily.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus nod=\r\nded to Straight Shot but continued to look at Nightlight. &quot;Do\n&gt; what you ca=\r\nn.&quot; He said to her. &quot;Check with Legacy if you need any\n&gt; assistance.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nA call came in over his radio from Night Shift, and he sent back a quick\n&gt; =\r\nresponse. He glanced over at Ramulus, &quot;Nightshift and Rat Trap are looking\n=\r\n&gt; for Cheetor. See who is available to give them a hand.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus nodd=\r\ned as he turned to leave the room. He glanced at Straight shot .\n&gt; . .\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Rodimus on the other hand looked at Perceptor and nodded, &quot;I am ready. He\n=\r\n&gt; turned to face his wife again, all thoughts of the missions and the Ark a=\r\ns\n&gt; he was concerned for her.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
