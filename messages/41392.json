Rumble looked away from the retreating Havotron with\ndisapointment. He spat on the ground. &quot;Awwww, I was hopping to fight\nSoundwave. We&#39;ve been inactive to long.&quot; The punk whined.\n\nSpasstik had other things to worry about, as the wolf like robot began\ngrowling in the opposite direction. The Constructicons were too close\nfor his likes, and he was ready to lunge, if he had to to protect\nSoundwave, so he just began to pace, never leaving Soundwave&#39;s side, or\ntaking his eyes off of the green robots.\n\nOOC:\n\nThank you everyone wno voted for me, and for everyone who put the effort\ninto running. I think this RPG is something truly speaciale, as we have\na large group of very talented players, and if we continue to just have\nfun, and be friendly to each other, this game can only improve. Thank\nyou for the kind words Alloran, and if anyone has any ideas on new\nrules, new concepts, or anything that might make this game better,\nplease tell the council. I don&#39;t think we were elected just so the game\nis played our way, we should all compromise, so everyone is happy. Oh,\nand thanks Yan, for finally seeing it as time to conclude the poll.\n\n"}}
