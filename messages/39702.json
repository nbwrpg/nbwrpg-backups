Their double-bladed swords\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slice the air. It is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sparring, but one mistake still means death. Stallex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is by far the more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; talented fighter, but he can not match his father in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; strength and speed, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex continues pushing Stallex back. Mustex gets a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good blow to Stallex&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chest. Stallex buckles under the pain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Why did you stop?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex:It hurts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Don&#39;t stop. If you don&#39;t give into the pain it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will hurt 10 times\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more. If you give into the pain you&#39;re enemy will see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it hurts 100 times\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more. I&#39;ve seen alot of bots fall from that mistake.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alot of bots wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have bothered teaching you that. Now back to beast\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mode.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex:Beast Mode!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Beast Mode!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex:Internal repairs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �They begin to run off. The two horses run quickly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; over the desert.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex:What&#39;s our next mission.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Yours is in &quot;Training City&quot;. There&#39;s a monkey\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there named Rhesus. He&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an old friend and he can teach you about stealth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex:What about you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:I have a plan to take out the &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s a 1 bot job.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex:You know how dangerous that is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Yes but �it&#39;s even harder for 2 bots to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; infiltrate. I have a shot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alone though.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex:O.k., but come back alive. I want to be the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one to beat you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �They run off on their way to Egypt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.Mustex and Stallex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Location:Training City,Egypt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Status:Preparation\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �Mustex and Stallex walk into a room. Rhesus is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting at a desk with his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back to them. He is leaning over some circuits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; examining them. Mustex has his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hands behind his back and is wearing his poker face.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He knows the following\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conversation will be a simple matter of wearing down\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus who is completely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oblivious to them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Rhesus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �Rhesus jumps. Mustex walks around in front of him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Still wasting precious Maximal computer space\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on your own private\n&gt; &gt; &gt; casino my,my,my. Stallex go start training with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; drones,Rhesus will be with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you soon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �Stallex walks out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:Ahh,my good friend. So the &quot;Carnitrons&quot; rise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again. I can hear the cry\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Carnitrons Carnivate&quot;. We were the only sensible\n&gt; &gt; &gt; group. We had a simple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; motto of &quot;stay alive&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Shutup! If we were so great then why did I lead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; us to get ambushed by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;Alliance&quot; for our first battle. As I recall 5 of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the 7 of us were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; damaged beyond repair. Now I see that anything except\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a 2-way war leads to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extra senseless casulties. That&#39;s why I intend to make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone pick Maximal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or Predicon. All you can think about is revenge on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Alliance&quot;,and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rebirth of a lost cause. All I want is these parts and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a transport.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �Mustex hands Rhesus a paper. Rhesus looks upset as he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reads it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:Where am I going to get a D.N.A. simulator.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:You&#39;re a bigger fool than I thought if you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think I don&#39;t know where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fox Fingers got his.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:Even so it will take me several weeks, but pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could speed me up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Did I mention I&#39;m planning to take out the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Iron Fist&quot; the Alliance\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be permantly crippled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:Well in that case just let me step into the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; next toom to get what you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; need. So,we can finally get revenge for Croctas,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kangato, Tigecs, Socrow, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my lovely Monkessa. I&#39;ve just finished about half a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dozen special\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hover-cycles. They should do fine for you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Oh, and by the way I told my son you&#39;d train\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:Small price to pay. Does he know about the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Carnitrons&quot; yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Not a clue.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t snich &#39;till you come to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your senses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �Rhesus hands Mustex a large box of parts and walks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; away to train Stallex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3.Mustex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Location:Training City,Egypt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Status:Traveling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Destination:Alliance Island,Spain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ETA:5 hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:Come back alive. You know I can&#39;t restart the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Carnitrons&quot; without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:You&#39;re not going to resart them with or without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhesus:I&#39;ll take good care of the kid... Uh,that is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; until you get back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:bye\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �Mustex jumps onto his waiting hover-cycle and races\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4.Mustex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Location:Alliance Island, Spain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Status:Infiltration\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �Mustex looks at the newly completed drone in front of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him. He activates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the D.N.A. simulator. The drone takes on his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appearance. He is positioned 500\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yards from the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; so the Alliance won&#39;t risk\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an attack unless he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gets closer. He activates another pocket sized drone.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It begins its mission\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to plant a device he had built 100 yards from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; base, 40 feet under. When\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his monitor says the drone is done he calls out the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; code that will activate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the drones programming.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Beast Mode!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �Mustex turns on his jammer and attaches it to his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; belt. The drone begins\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transmitting a Maximal �frequency,goes to Beast\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mode,and bounds for the base.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex keeps low to the ground so he won&#39;t be spotted.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The auto-guns begin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; firing, but no transformers come out. The horse jumps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; away from every shot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He stops at 100 yards away.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Drone:Mustex Maximize!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �The drone transforms and begins firing arrows at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shield of the base. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dodges all the beams,but only has enough power at this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of level for 15\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes. Fortunately,he doesn&#39;t need that long. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; main turrets fireand take\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him out. The shields flicker from power loss,but stay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intact. Mustex then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; smiles when his monitor shows the pocket sized drone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the pocket sized drone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has reached the surface. He activates the device and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it transmites a Maximal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frequency. The drone then starts firing. It has enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power for 6 shots. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Alliance&quot; is beginning to sweat. The main turret\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fires again and the shield\n&gt; &gt; &gt; goes down. Mustex deactivates th device and charges.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Beast Mode!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �As he charges he scans the base. The shields will be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down for the next hour.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It will be down for the next hour. It will take him 10\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes to navigate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the corridors to his destination and 10 minutes to get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back. He will go in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the �one way they won&#39;t expect,The Front Door, 10\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yards away he transforms.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex:Mustex Maximize!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �Mustex draws a cyber arrow and blows the door open.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Using his frequency\n&gt; &gt; &gt; jammer as cover he sneaks to his destination. He walks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into the Energon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; storage room. The Energon will magnify the explosion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the small explosive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he made. He walks over to a computer console and hooks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it up to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Alliance&quot; network. If a remote connection is placed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on it it will blow from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 connections to the network. It can detect the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Energon and will blow if much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is removed. It can detect the energon in the room and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will blow if to much is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; removed. It takes 20 minutes to diffuse and it would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be set for 15. There is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no deactivation code. The full blast could probably\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not be contained. Even if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the explosive is covered an electronic signal will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ignite the energon. He set\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it and ran out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; � � � � � � CHECK!
