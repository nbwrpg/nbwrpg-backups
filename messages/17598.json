She didn&#39;t know if she \nhad caused the surge or not.  The surge not only startled her, but \ncaused her some pain in her spark. She stopped trying to move her new \nprotoform.  She retracted all her connection and withdrew into her \nchamber.  Knowing that Veratis would find out about the power surge, \nshe pullled back her last connect to the monitor.  She didn&#39;t want to \nmake Veratis angry with her.  Her life more or less rested in his \nhands and getting him upset at her wasn&#39;t a smart idea.  \n\nVeratis was a great mystery to her.  He had gone through and survived \nagainst all odds.  What had her wondering was how this bot could \nstill have the kind, curious, caring spark of a maximal after all \nthat had happened to him. She wondered, once she got a form and could \ntalk again, would he be willing to teach her what he knew?  From what \nhe said about how long he had lived, that could be one heck of a long \nschooling session.  She thought and wondered if Lunarpine would be \nwilling to learn as much as she was willing to learn.  She would have \nsmiled at the thought of how he had taught her. She remembered how \nLunarpine had got her in the field, and then again in the forest.  he \nshowed her that she wasn&#39;t the warrior that she thought she was. She \nremembered fighting with Lunarpine and putting him in the cr, when \nhis optics had been damaged.  She remembered that final fight, where \nshe lost her form and almost her life.  She remembered no longer \nbeing able to see or hear Lunarpine, but being able to feel his \npresance and knowing he was there.  \n\nBut now, after the power surge, she stayed inside her chamber and \ndidn&#39;t try to connect to anything.  She withdrew and didn&#39;t venture \nout past her small, power connects feeding her spark.  She didn&#39;t \nknow how the surdge happened.  But she didn&#39;t want to anger Veratis \nand didn&#39;t want any more pain.  \n\n\n"}}
