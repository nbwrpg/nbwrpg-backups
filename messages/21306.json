I mean, characters like that that can just \nbe \n&gt; manufactured continuously?  I&#39;m not sure, though.\n\n_Until I know Yanshosh let me use 8... but If I&#39;m cheatig I cn fix it \nand Alliance can destroy it in this fight. But I must clear that the \neight probes that I use are the same than let me stole my first \nmxinal&#39;s pod.\n\n&gt; And then, I&#39;m confused about Airly&#39;s attacks with her characters. \nAirly, \n&gt; please have your squads and such fire independently.  I don&#39;t know \nwho is in \n&gt; the Amazon Squad, or who&#39;s in Dragon&#39;s team.  Or who a &quot;repli-like \nshape&quot; is. \n&gt;  You&#39;re gonna have to be a tad more specific.\n\nSorry I&#39;ll be more especific the reptil-like shpe is Darkfate in \ntecnicolor and his beast mode is a dragon with five heads. and Okie \nI&#39;ll gave st my wariors a name and best mode sorry again... &#39;beacuse \nIt&#39;s hard to quit at old write habbits like I wrote my fns fiction...\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I need Yanshosh to get online so I can discuss this and other \nstuff with \n&gt; him.  But, I&#39;ve gotta leave in two hours, because I&#39;m going bowling \nand \n&gt; seeing &quot;Little Nicky&quot; with an older brother of mine.  That may take \n3-4 \n&gt; hours.  Then when I get home I have to move a ton of wood around my \nhouse, \n&gt; which will take a couple hours.  Then I&#39;m going to have to fight \nwith my \n&gt; brother for control of an online server!  So, sorry, there&#39;s going \nto be a \n&gt; mass delay on my part.  I got to get ready now.  \n&gt; \n&gt; So, I&#39;m going to have to ask that the battle be paused.  Though, \nI&#39;ve never \n&gt; seen a battle paused.  So, I&#39;m asking that you LEAVE Vehement and \nhis base \n&gt; out of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because I&#39;ll just be dumping all of my characters on Yan if he \ndoesn&#39;t help \n&gt; sort this crap out.  But, Vehement is a new character full of \nagendas, same \n&gt; with his two minions, and I can&#39;t give them to Yan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to write another e-mail to Yan \ntelling him \n&gt; what all my characters do)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Unitron\n&gt; KSLawDogg@c...\n\n\n"}}
