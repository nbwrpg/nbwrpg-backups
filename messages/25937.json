It was only a cease \nfire?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tarantopulous pondered this. After all, as soon as the\n&gt; &gt; Maximals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their guy back, then they could fire again, right? They \nwere\n&gt; &gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; making things harder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tarantopulous (To Kluster): Sir, they are all still \nfiring.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suicide. You have shown me the light, and I am most \ncertain\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are killing  themselves! I can&#39;t take this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With that, Tarantopulous ran from the battle, catching \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attention of Deemos on his way...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
