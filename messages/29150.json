The shuttle itself was being fired on...and\nboy was it taking damage. \n\nThe odd thing was...it also had the Decepticon emblem.\nThen a large explosion.\n\nThe Stabilizers were hit....and it was going down. The\npilot of the fleeing Decepticon shuttle guided it into\nthe atmosphere, hoping to at least survive a crash\nlanding long enough to make a last stand.\n\nIt was beginning to burn up in the atmosphere, headed\nfor land...Central Africa.\n\nThe plummet took forever. To the naked eye, the\ncrashing shuttle appeared as a comet, falling to Earth\nin a burning fireball...\n\nuntil it crashed hard in Central Africa. It skidded\nnearly a mile before crashing to a stop. It was a\nmiracle that the craft was still relatively in one\npiece...albiet shredded to ribbons.\n\nTwo minutes later, the other Decepticon shuttle\nlanded. Out came Scud (black) and Razor (dark red),\ntwo Jet-class Decepticons disembarked, ready to finish\nthe job.\n\nThey blasted open the cockpit, to find no one there.\n\n&quot;Oh Strafe...STRA-AFE! Come out come out wherever you\nare!&quot; Scud shouted in an echoing, insane voice.\n\nRazor was looking around, scanning the immediate area.\n\nRazor laughed, &quot;Come on, you traitor. Come out so we\ncan take your head back to Cybertron!&quot;\n\nNothing.\n\nThen a sound from the sky...\n\nWhat appeared to be a dark blue F-22 Raptor did a full\nStuka dive bombing run, blasting away with twin laser\nblasters mounted under the wings. The strafing run\ntook Razor from behind. Scud never had a chance.\n\n...and fell, blasted like crazy.\n\nRazor, however was able to dodge the strafing run. As\nthe jet passed by, it transformed into a robot and\nlanded, the twin blasters forming a double-barreled\nlaser cannon. He was sleek, streamlined \n\n(here&#39;s a pic of an F-22 Raptor. Would house a VERY\ncool-looking transformer. Top view:\nhttp://www.f-22raptor.com/images/photos/gal_34_b.jpg \n\nBottom View:\nhttp://www.f-22raptor.com/images/photos/gal_38_b.jpg)\n\n\nRazor smiled. &quot;There you are.&quot;\n\nIt resembled the classic Western showdown.\n\nRazor and Strafe raised their weapons at the same\ntime, both firing and scrambling at the same time.\nStrafe rolled on the ground and came up shooting...\n\nSo did Razor. \n\nStrafe retreated to the crashed shuttle, which was\nexperiencing a reactor leak. \n\nRazor got an idea. He fired a continuous barrage into\nthe exposed and damaged reactor of the Decepticon\nshuttle...\n\nKa-boom!\n\nNothing but blinding light and smoke.\n\nRazor laughed.\n\n&quot;Dodge that, traitor.&quot;\n\nThe smoke took awhile to clear, and Razor turned\ntowards his shuttle...\n\n...To look down a double barrelled blaster\ncannon....belonging to the Decepticon named Strafe, of\ncourse.\n\n&quot;Dodge this.&quot; Strafe said, the voice reverbing like a\nyounger version of Megatron&#39;s.\n\nBLAM!\n\nRazor&#39;s head had been literally blown off. The\ndecapitated Razor fell lifeless to the ground. The\nother Decepticon who had killed him, Strafe, activated\nan internal distress beacon, collapsing to the ground\nin Stasis Lock, using his last ounce of strength.\n\nSomeone would find him, and whether it be Autobot or\nDecepticon, he&#39;d either be saved or executed...\n\nOf course, when whoever found him saw the logos on his\nshoulders, he would probably be killed on the spot,\nlest his rescuer be a trigger-happy Autobot or Maximal\nwanting to bag himself a Decepticon. His last thought\nbefore going into stasis lock?\n\nThe Decepticons wanted him dead, the Autobots hated\nhim...he was screwed either way.\n\n\n(tag like, umm...anyone I guess. Strafe&#39;s open to\nfind.)\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo! Mail. \nhttp://personal.mail.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
