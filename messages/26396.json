It didn&#39;t affect his plans. The Vok\n&gt; being, however, hears and pays interest, looking through the planet.\n&gt; Optimus Prime was back, but the Optimus Prime on the Ark was still\n&gt; there. This one must have come from the future.\n&gt;\n&gt; Near him, Astral looks very surprised, but says nothing since his\n&gt; commander didn&#39;t.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &quot;What in the pit is that?!&quot; Repressor exclaims as the voice reaches\n&gt; him and Perndabot. They and FZ were just entering the CR room of the\n&gt; Iron Fist.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s nothing important. Simply an announcement,&quot; FZ replies, his\n&gt; mind instructed by Zardus&#39;. Repressor and Perndabot nod doubtfully.\n&gt; All three bots enter CR tanks.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Recklessa, in a CR tank, doesn&#39;t hear the voice. Griplash, also in\n&gt; one, fails to hear it as well.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Starlight stops her decent as she hears the voice, listening for a\n&gt; second but hearing nothing more. She shruggs it off, opening fire on\n&gt; Prebon with her rifle.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Fenox&#39;s head jerks up as she hears the words. She looks at D,\n&gt; alarmed. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; In the Alliance base, a door slides open and Reptilica and\n&gt; Bloodystrike emerge. The voice had woken them from their slumber that\n&gt; had been forced by Desmonus after she had almost drained them of\n&gt; mechfluid, but they hadn&#39;t heard it. They also didn&#39;t remember\n&gt; Desmonus drinking either of their mechfluid.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both bots set off for the bridge of the Iron Fist.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dachande&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Dark Prime--&gt;Optimus Prime::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     He had been wandering for days, not caring if he returned to\n&gt; Nod. Suddenly he got a feeling that something wasn&#39;t right in the\n&gt; Universe. There were too many evils, and and age old riverly could\n&gt; not be brought to a close.\n&gt; &gt;     Galvatron was alive. Optimus Prime was stuck within the\n&gt; Evilness of Dark Prime. They would not be able to fight both being\n&gt; evil. Primus needed to be sated.\n&gt; &gt;     The Time Gateway (remember that?) Glowed with a firey reddness.\n&gt; The source of Prime&#39;s evil and his lust for the power of Cronus was\n&gt; seated there. The Gateway exploded, shattering into thousands of\n&gt; peices.\n&gt; &gt;     Dark Prime fell to his knees. His body was wracked with pain.\n&gt; His chest panel opened of it&#39;s own will (well, not really) and the\n&gt; Autobot Matrix emerged. It floated out from Prime&#39;s chest and then it\n&gt; opened. Releasing all of Prime&#39;s goodness back into him, but leaving\n&gt; just enough evil to get the job done. Prime&#39;s body went through a\n&gt; change as well, from his knees to his feet became Blue, his upper\n&gt; legs became white, his arms and chest became the familiar Prime Red.\n&gt; His mouth plate became silver, along with much of his face, the\n&gt; helmet that surrounded it bacame blue, his hands also became Blue.\n&gt; &gt;     As the Matrix went back into his chest a giant light emitted\n&gt; from him, it covered the entire planet (got permission) everything on\n&gt; the planet saw this light.\n&gt; &gt;     A voice boomed over the planet, all bots could hear this as\n&gt; well, no matter where they were. The voice said, &quot;Arise, Optimus\n&gt; Prime.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;     Dark Prime had died, Optimus Prime was reborn, with a new drive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (Please add Dark Prime to the Matrix)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
