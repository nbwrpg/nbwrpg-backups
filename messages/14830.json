But this is the only way. \nIf I put the bomb anywhere else, it will only destroy a section of \nthe ship, and some could live. On the engine, it would set off a \nchain reaction making the entire ship go up. And if I leave, they&#39;ll \nknow about it and look for it. Believe me sir, if there was anyway I \ncould get out of this I would. But it&#39;s the only way to ensure entire \nPredacon destruction. Good-bye Lord Deemos.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
