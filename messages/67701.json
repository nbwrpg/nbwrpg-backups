A\n&gt; ways outside town.  They would also know maximals and preds converged\n&gt; on the area.  (this is like 3 months ago in game time...)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure who gets to do this, Airly, Nic and I have been sharing\n&gt; this area.  I can describe the site though since the fight was in\n&gt; Airly and my posts.\n\nAny one who can give a description would be great! At the moment I\nbelieve my team is just looking for evidence as to Blacknightmare&#39;s\nlocation. Its funny my characters know more then me as a player does.\nPerhaps any obvious witnesses would be helpful?? I may need some\nhelpful steering, and I will see if i can locate the old posts sometime\nsoon.\n\nThanks\nPreston\n\nPreston\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
