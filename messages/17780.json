He flapped his wings, looking around. He drifted over to a \nboulder that would hold him, waiting for something to happen that \ncould be useful to his mind, to dim his boredom.\n\nAll since his time on-line, he wasn&#39;t used to his full advantage. He \nknew there was much more that a Predacon could experience. Certainly \na bot like him. He needed a challenge.\n\n\n"}}
