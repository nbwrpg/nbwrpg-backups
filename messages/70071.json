To you it may seem like failure, to me, yes, it was a m=\r\nistake but also a learning experience. Learn not to go too fast, yet make d=\r\necisions carefully. So, yes, I configuratively got a flat tire along the wa=\r\ny. But tires can be changed and after that, it&#39;s back on the road like noth=\r\ning happened. Of course to you, it&#39;s like a perpetual road block. There, yo=\r\nu have my answer. Nothing more.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He quietly follows orders by discardi=\r\nng his weaponry.

He somehow felt that if he came with the=\r\n bare minimal he wouldn&#39;t lose much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Night Shift also discards his rif=\r\nfle without revolt. Yet he looks at Scorponok after hearing what Tucson Pri=\r\nme said and how he was viewing the situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Okay, yeah, things wen=\r\nt South. Big deal, happens all the time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson then looks to Cyclonu=\r\ns, yes, he had looked as he had before he had lost his sight. It didn&#39;t sur=\r\nprise him though. He had see and been through worse.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m sorry Cyclo=\r\nnus, there are no secrets to share with you. I have not the answers for the=\r\n power that has been given to me, because I myself don&#39;t know them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; H=\r\ne lastly turns to Hydras. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Rat Trap and Quickstride pose no threat t=\r\no you Hydras.

You have me and now you have nothing to fear from the outside worl=\r\nd, because your main threat is now in your possession. Think about it, what=\r\n can they do? They&#39;re no threat to you at all.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Night Shift nodds in a=\r\ngreement to his commander&#39;s statement.

Ooohh, bean pods...&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Again he thinks of nothing but food and begins to munch on the bean pod=\r\ns.

As Rodimus taunts him, he simply ignores him,=\r\n \nnot uttering one word about it for a moment or so, and he also had Hydras=\r\n \nbreathing down his neck configuratively. Still he keeps calm throughout, =\r\nand \nfirst directs his attention to Rodimus.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Failure? Hmm=\r\n, Rodimus \nI don&#39;t know. To you it may seem like failure, to me, yes, it wa=\r\ns a mistake but \nalso a learning experience. Learn not to go too fast, yet =\r\nmake decisions \ncarefully. So, yes, I configuratively got a flat tire along=\r\n the way. But tires \ncan be changed and after that, it&#39;s back on the road l=\r\nike nothing happened. Of \ncourse to you, it&#39;s like a perpetual road block. =\r\nThere, you have my answer. \nNothing more.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He quietly foll=\r\nows orders by discarding his \nweaponry. Having left his cross bow behind, h=\r\ne merely gives up an old sword and \nspear, as his weapons. He somehow felt =\r\nthat if he came with the bare minimal he \nwouldn&#39;t lose much.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Night Shift also discards his riffle \nwithout revolt.

Big deal, happ=\r\nens all the time.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tucson then looks to \nCyclonus, yes, he=\r\n had looked as he had before he had lost his sight.

I have not the answers \nfo=\r\nr the power that has been given to me, because I myself don&#39;t know \nthem.&quot;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He lastly turns to Hydras. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot; Rat Trap \na=\r\nnd Quickstride pose no threat to you Hydras. They have not entered your bas=\r\ne, \nand done nothing to get you angry. So to that question, I have to say..=\r\n. LEAVE \nTHEM OUT OF THIS. I am the one who made the mistake, and it&#39;s me y=\r\nou want, not \nthem. So, I&#39;m here aren&#39;t I? You have me and now you have not=\r\nhing to fear from \nthe outside world, because your main threat is now in yo=\r\nur possession. Think \nabout it, what can they do? They&#39;re no threat to you =\r\nat all.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nNight Shift nodds in agreement to his commander&#39;=\r\ns statement.

You&#39;re the only real friend I&#39;ll ever \nhave=\r\n.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quickstride could see what was happening.

He looked at Nightshift, &quot;Is this what \n=\r\nyou&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; meant by get it?&quot; he said, the sarcasm thick in his v=\r\noice. \n&quot;I think we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; got it then, yes we did.&quot; he chuckled =\r\nat his own \njoke.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As all this was going=\r\n on the doors \nslid open and Cyclonus stood there,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; weapon=\r\n drawns and optics \ndarting around the room. The cyclonus that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; stood there, while \nfamiliar to most, was very different from the las=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; time Tuscon \nhad seen him before he lost his sight. Thi=\r\ns Cyclonus was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nlittle taller and sleeker, even in his =\r\nrobot mode his lined and form&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; bespoke speed and aerodyna=\r\nmics.

It \nis as if he had&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; grown into something more than what he was, \neven his spark no =\r\nlonger&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; registered as pure Decepticon, there \nwas that asp=\r\nect that was always&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Unicronian, however on his \nchest was=\r\n emblazed the purple symbol of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Decepticon \nforces.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Upon seeing the turn of events \nCyclonus =\r\nnodded satisfactorilly as he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; turned to Hydras, &quot;What \neve=\r\nr wave that was from Tuscon awakened&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jhiaxus from stassis=\r\n. \nHe has the security section secured.&quot; He turned&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his ga=\r\nze on \nTuscon, &quot;We will have to have it analyzed to see what ever&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; \ndefence to it can be mounted.
