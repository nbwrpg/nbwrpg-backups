He didn&#39;t know what it was, but his keen eye sight \ntold him Megatron&#39;s plan worked.\n\nHe mused. Where exactly was Megatron going with this? He took off \nfrom his perch and let the currents lift him into the sky. He circled \nthe area, then flew off from the cave&#39;s south side. \n\nHe wasn&#39;t sure where the clones and Inferno were going. He landed on \na high rise, and opened his comm-link to the Predacon ship to test \nsomething. He said nothing into it, just let it go into the incoming \ntransmittion mode. \n\n\n"}}
