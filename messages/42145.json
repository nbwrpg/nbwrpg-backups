The combatants could easily attempt to leave if \nthey wanted.\n\nOver the loudspeaker of this small arena, the official begins.  &quot;This match \nbetween Hot Rod and Dragonfly is non-lethal.  The loser will be whoever \nyields first.  Begin the battle!&quot;\n\n(I will take WarBarge&#39;s character until he returns from his vacation)\n\n"}}
