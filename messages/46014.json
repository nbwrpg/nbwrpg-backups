I agree, the end of \nNBWRPG is here, it was well while it lasted, but it is time to move \non.  I can say that if we don&#39;t change something, I will be quiting \nthe rpg for good.  I would love to move this along, to start again \nsomewhere else where we don&#39;t have useless story&#39;s with dead \nends.  If your with me, good on you, if not, I hope that in the end \nthis rpg will work out cuz i will not be here.\n\n"}}
