She couldn&#39;t.  She had \nnamed Ramulus as the leader for he was the only leader she knew of.  \nShe hoped that Striker would name the same bot.\n\nShe looked at Striker and let her eyes talk for her. Her eyes \nexpressed the feelings that she had for him.

He peered \nin \n&gt; the hole.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ah, you are awake! And I should have remembered to pull out your \n&gt; transformation circuts. You would&#39;ve have gotten out of your \nchains. \n&gt; I hope you like my new army member. Isn&#39;t she just precious? \n&gt; Fortunatly for you yo won&#39;t have to stay here long, unless my pan \n&gt; goes ill. If it does than you stay forever. Spears has already told \n&gt; me the answer to this question, but maybe she is low ranking and \n&gt; doesn&#39;t know the real answer. So I will ask you, and if you do not \n&gt; give me the correct answer I will terminate Spears. Who is the \n&gt; Maximal leader?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright, nic job Ramulus! But here we go...coming in back to \n&gt; Earth!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix was able to pull the bottom up at the last second, letting the \n&gt; shuttle hit the ground evenly. I tall shook, neraly throwing the \ntwo \n&gt; soldiers out of their chairs. It went along the ground for a bit \n&gt; until finaly stopping just infront of the group. Brix Fliq and \n&gt; Ramulus had returned to Earth! Brix and Fliq got out of the shuttle \n&gt; to greet the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey guys! We come bearing new computer boards and new hull. So \n&gt; what&#39;s this problem we have?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
