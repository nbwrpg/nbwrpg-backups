He can&#39;t do it for much longer, they are getting \nmore accurate. Than he hears the small whisper come from the batt \nPred. He responds in a secret Predacon frequency.\n\n&quot;I would love to come down right now, but you see I&#39;m being fired \nupon. If you really want to go home, try to talk Hell Beast into \nthinking about my offer.&quot;\n\nVulois pulls out his other blaster. This could get ugly. He shouts \ndown again to Hell Beast.\n\n&quot;What do you have to lose? If you don&#39;t take my offer, I&#39;m going to \ncome down and start attacking wildly. Of course I will die, but I \ncould severly damage the ship and take a few Preds with me. That puts \nyou at a major disadvantage. If you take my offer though, all you \nhave to do is give my friend and I a little promotion and you will \nhave the most advanced technology on this planet, putting you at a \ngreat spot to win the Neo Beast Wars. This is the last time I will \noffer, or I&#39;m going to come down and reak Havoc on this base. Also \nI&#39;ll press this litle button on this machine, and whipe the memory of \none of your preds, whoever it may be. Than it might decide to trot \noff and start anew, and than you&#39;re down another Pred. What&#39;ll it be?&quot;\n\nVulois sits back to let Hell Beast think about it, but than an \nemergency comes up. His regular scanners are telling him that some \nMaximals are taking the driver! He sends a signal to Soundwave.\n\n&quot;Please, Soundwave, do everything in your power to keep that driver. \nYour new body can take the maximals. This whole deal depends on it!\n\nThan Vulois sends another secret message to the bat Pred.\n\n&quot;Forget what I told you before. I need you to sneak out of the base \nand focus on the spark of Soundwave, another Pred. Some maximals are \ntrying to take our ticket home! I need you to go help Soundwave \nprotect it.&quot;\n\nVulois sits back, with his blasters out. It&#39;s Hell Beast&#39;s move.\n\n\n"}}
