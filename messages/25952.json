I don&#39;t think I sent it in attachment form =), \ndo all of my messages come like that? About a quarter or less of \nthe messages I get say attachment but open as a normal \nmessage, i was just ignoring the attachment mark. Also do Killfest, \nEndBringer, Demise, and Greven fly? I think i know why it came as \nan attachement, i was doing some tests and if i change the bold, \nitalics, and underline settings it changes my test into an \nattachment.\n\n\nAstroblast thinks for a moment, taking in all of that information, \n&quot;Your information is useful, and to continue with this I think that \nMotormaster must be here. Besides, you haven&#39;t met him yet.&quot; He \nthen turns away, opens a comlink to Motormaster, and says, \n&quot;Motormaster, your presence is requested at the following \ncoordinates ......., where are you now?&quot; Then he turns back to \nKillfest, &quot;Alright, while we wait for Motormaster&#39;s response, what \nfaction appears to be the strongest right now?&quot;\n\n\n\nOn 21 Jan 2001, at 7:30, Yanshosh@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Astroblast is ok, rAuq, but please don&#39;t send posts as email \n&gt; attachments next time (you might not have sent it as an email \n&gt; attachment, but eGroups could have mistaken it for one or something).\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Killfest::\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest nods, opening his mouth to answer Astroblast&#39;s questions as \n&gt; the bot asks them, but interrupted every time by a new question. He \n&gt; finally closes his mouth, waiting for Astroblast to talk himself out. \n&gt; When the bot finishes, Killfest replies.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Base locations, numbers, and other recorded info can be found back \n&gt; at base,&quot; he says, stretching out a hand, palm up. &quot;I can, however, \n&gt; give you a slight overview of the locations, and the numbers of \n&gt; Predacon troops.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; His palm lights up in several locations, a hologram of Earth apearing \n&gt; below it. &quot;This is prehistoric earth, as you had said. There are \n&gt; roughly half a dozen major factions existing on the planet, some \n&gt; stronger than others.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The hologram of earth spins, showing a volcano in Greece. &quot;First of \n&gt; all, this is the base of my faction of the Predacons. Three groups, \n&gt; led by me, DrillBit, and Darkfate, are allied and reside in this \n&gt; base. The other faction of Predacons is led by Megatron, and their \n&gt; base is located in the arctics.&quot; The hologram spins again, showing \n&gt; the location of Megatron&#39;s base.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The two factions closest to being Predacon are the Destrons and the \n&gt; Alliance.&quot; Killfest was now reciting what he had read from the \n&gt; computer at the Council base before it was destroyed, and he hoped \n&gt; the information was accurate. &quot;The Destron base is located roughly on \n&gt; the other side of the planet from us, on a different continuent.&quot; His \n&gt; hologram once again spins, showing what would one day be called Mt. \n&gt; Katahdin, located in northern Maine. &quot;The Alliance base is located \n&gt; quite a bit closer, on the same continuent as us.&quot; Now the hologram \n&gt; spins to show an island three miles off of the south coast of \n&gt; Spain. &quot;Last, and quite possibly least, are the Maximals. Their base \n&gt; is located in the continent south of us, on the western part of that \n&gt; continuent.&quot; The hologram spins to show the deserts of Africa, \n&gt; highliting a spot on the west side of it. Killfest turns the hologram \n&gt; off. &quot;To the best of my knowledge, the other factions don&#39;t have a \n&gt; fixed base, but they&#39;re there. For the numbers, we&#39;d have to return \n&gt; to base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He pauses, waiting for questions from Astroblast.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
