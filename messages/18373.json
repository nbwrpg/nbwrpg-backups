Her body landed with a thud on the ground.  \n\nHer trainer program and maximal program were starting to fight head \nto head again. Her circuits started to smolder and she groaned as she \nlay there.   A small ribbon of smoke escaped from her neck panel and \nhead gear. She slowly opened her optics, turning head slightly she \nlooked up at the sky.  &quot;What is going on?&quot; she whispered as she \nslipped into the blackness.  Her optics flickered as her programs \nwent bazerk.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Slayer/Firearm/Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Slayer nods, walking out of the base and flying up to Savage. He \n&gt; didn&#39;t want to retrieve Spears, but if his master commanded, it had \n&gt; to be done...\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am ready, Master,&quot; he says to Prebon, hovering near him.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Firearm swears, activating his comm-link as Spears yells into hers \n&gt; again. &quot;Cybertronian Fire,&quot; he says into it, &quot;We&#39;re gonna have a \n&gt; battle at the Ark very soon. I suggest sending reinforcememnts. But \n&gt; tell them to stop by the lab and get the weapon and chip Ramulus \n&gt; made, they&#39;ll need &#39;em. Tell them to install the chip. Heck, I&#39;ll \n&gt; send you some info.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He glides in toward Spears. This needed to stop. Setting his arm \n&gt; weapon to lowest power, Firearm fires four shots at Spears, \n&gt; attempting to stun her. But Firearm was a bot designed for battle, \n&gt; the lowest setting on his weapon was pretty high. While he fires, \nhis \n&gt; comp sends Kluster the info.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster looks at the scanners of the Cybertronian Fire, recieving \n&gt; Firearm&#39;s transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All available Maximals,&quot; he says through the intercom, &quot;The Ark \n&gt; might be attacked soon. Everyone&#39;s welcome to go defend it, but a \n&gt; chip is neccessary for the battle. THe enemy has a mind controll \n&gt; device, the chip will counter it. There&#39;s also a weapon that will \n&gt; destroy the mind controll chip that their weapon fires. If you stop \n&gt; by the lab, there should be some there. Install the chip into your \n&gt; systems, and grab the weapon. Then head off to the Ark.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Trainers!
