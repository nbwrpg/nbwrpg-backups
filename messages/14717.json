It&#39;s getting out that&#39;s the \nproblem. We could wander this mountain for years. But incase we don&#39;t \nget out, there&#39;s something I need to do.&quot;\n\nVulois stopped and opened up his comm.\n\n&quot;Battera.....It&#39;s Vulois. I&#39;ve tried moving the embassy to this \nmountain, but I think we&#39;ve taken a wrong turn and are lost. We may \nnever get out. If we make it, we&#39;ll call again, but for now there&#39;s \nsomething I need to tell you. You&#39;ve always been the one for peace, \neven when I was scheming. In away this os your mission. Whoever heard \nof Preds wanting peace, eh?(chuckles hopelessly). So, since you have \nbeen with me so long, if I don&#39;t make it, I want you to lead the \ngroup. To host the conference back at the embassy. Don&#39;t do anything \nnow, we might still make it. But if you don&#39;t here from us again in \ntwo days, assume command. We&#39;re going to far out of range now, so you \nwon&#39;t be able to contact us. Good-bye Battera. You&#39;ve been a good \nfriend.&quot;\n\nVulois continues down the tunnel.\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream/Gotron\n\nStarscream and Gotron continue to fight inside the cave, when the \nmessage from KitKat comes through. Realization dawns on the two bots.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re Alliance?&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re Predacon?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes! We&#39;re allies. Quickly, we must get out before it explodes!&quot;\n\nStarscream and Gotron heads to the door, but from all their fire \npower, the part infront of the door collapses, leaving them trapped \nin. Starscream contacts Phobia&#39;s ship.\n\n&quot;Hello? Anyone? This is the Predacon Starscream(at this point Gotron \nstares in wonder and mutters &quot;Starscream?&quot; and another Alliance bot. \nWhat&#39;s your name?(&quot;Gotron.&quot;)Gotron&#39;s his name. Please, we are trapped \ninside the Pred cave. We need assistane now. The door is caved-in. \nPlease, just shoot it open with the ships lasers or something. We beg \nfor help!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nSavage\n\nSavage dodges a few of the shots, but some hit him in the tail. \nSavage is enraged, and swings his massive spikey tail right at Spears \nand Striker.\n\n\n\n"}}
