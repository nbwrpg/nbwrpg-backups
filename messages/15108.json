This was crazy! KitKat \n&gt; and him needed serious attention. They had no base. They had no \n&gt; supplies, and now the other Preds were trying to get them to join \n&gt; them. The old assimillation technique. We&#39;d probably be made low \n&gt; ranking officers. And where was their all might leader Megatron at \n&gt; this time? Off chasing some unknown aliens whil his crew was getting \n&gt; blown to bits! Starscream looked from KitKat, to Tarantulas, and than \n&gt; to Drillbit.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Look at her! She&#39;s in no position to be making command decisions! \n&gt; Look at the pain she&#39;s in!&quot; Starscream looked at her caringly, &quot;I \n&gt; think the damage might be much worse than I thought. She might have \n&gt; broken a big vital system inside her body. If we don&#39;t get help soon \n&gt; she might die. One of us has to relieve her of command.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
