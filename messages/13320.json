He continued to wiped at the water on his \nshoulders,\n&gt; &gt; thinking it was still on him. He looked at himself, seeing that \nthe\n&gt; &gt; acid was no longer eating at his armor. He began to calm down.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He looked at KitKat. He then turned his head as AirBomber ran out \nof\n&gt; &gt; the Predacon cave. The acid rain was still going on outside, and \nit\n&gt; &gt; looked like it would last for a while.
