He looked\n&gt; down at the information he had received and blinked. &quot;Sir.&quot; Fractyl\n&gt; said, his voice low and apologetic, &quot;um the readings we got?&quot; He\n&gt; glanced down at the listing again and then back up at Hydras, &quot;They\n&gt; are coming from far north of us, from Pentatron, the mining city.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Iguanus blinked, obviously he had not expected that, &quot;What??&quot; he said\n&gt; stepping over to Fractyl jerking the pager from him and looking at it\n&gt; himself. Fractyl stumbled back, obviously upset by Iguanus&#39; actions,\n&gt; He sent him a hurt and betrayed look but Iguanus paid him little\n&gt; attention.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iguanus looked up at Hydras, &quot;Hmph, this can&#39;t be good.&quot; He handed the\n&gt; pager over to Hydras for his inspection.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
