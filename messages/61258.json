Yes sir!  Malice and I decided that it\n&gt; might be a good idea \n&gt; &gt; to have a back plan to the cannon already in\n&gt; construction.  We plan \n&gt; &gt; to use a high mass object and collapse it&#39;s\n&gt; gravity, turning it \n&gt; into \n&gt; &gt; a black hole.  We wanted to launch it in an area\n&gt; of spatial \n&gt; &gt; instability.  Once the black hole had served it&#39;s\n&gt; purpose, we \n&gt; planned \n&gt; &gt; to open a time rift and send it through.
