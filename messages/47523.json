Her name is Mistra. I would like the \n&gt; assistance of some who is skilled with engineering.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;AzureBlade was glad. He set his feelings apart for now. They \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to get to the base first, and then, maybe, think of the \n&gt; future. A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; beep in his HUD indicated the city&#39;s proximity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; AzureBlade: I detect the base. We should see it... now! Do you \nsee \n&gt; &gt; &gt; those golden towers?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mistra looked ahead, straining to see the base...and spotted the \n&gt; glittering \n&gt; &gt; golden towers ahead of them. &quot;I can see it!&quot; she replied, almost \n&gt; cheerfully. \n&gt; &gt; Now she&#39;d find out just who she was...they&#39;d be able to help her!\n\n\n"}}
