There has been no attempt by\n&gt; them to take over, in fact there has been no communication from them.&quot;\n&gt; Cyclonus frowned as he continued, &quot;From my last scan it would seem\n&gt; that Perceptor has left with the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus looked around the room, nodding in satisfaction as he looked\n&gt; at it, it was almost as if he were looking at it for the first time,\n&gt; or at least for the first time in some time. He looked back at Hydras,\n&gt; &quot;I have been working to reopen some of the Predacon stasis pods that\n&gt; had held damaged soldiers, as well as there have been several that\n&gt; have returned since you were sleeping.&quot; Cyclonus gestured at the room,\n&gt; &quot;Fractyl has been instrumental in repairing much of the damage to the\n&gt; base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus looked troubled, &quot;But Scourge is still missing. I have not\n&gt; heard from him either since I sent him after the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
