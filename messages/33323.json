They spread out and \neach took a side of the Cybertronian Fire. Within several seconds their good \naim had taken out all the missiles heading for the ship except for two which \nwere too small, and an orb which went unnoticed. Satisfied at their success, \nthey continued to stand watch over the ship. With them around, firing \nmissiles at it would be hopeless! :)\n\n\n\nCledar and Forrior saw all the firepower being fired and identified all the \nextra targets. Cledar smiled and took careful aim with his cannon, firing \nanother large stream of plasma at Vehement. Furrior changed his target, \nfiring at Unicron this time. The blasts were probably too big to avoid, and \nthey were as strong as Megatron&#39;s cannon in G1.\n\n\n\nRixer fired two more missiles as he continued running toward Predator, \nseveral plasma shots following behind them to hit the Predacon too.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
