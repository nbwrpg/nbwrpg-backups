Oh no sister. \nCount me out.  If I go back to Megatron, I&#39;m scrap.  If or when that \nship gets here, I&#39;m scrap.  But if I got a choice, I&#39;d rather take my \nchances with the aliens.

She stood there and shook.  Her body was flooded by the \nremembering of her dream when she was returning to life.

Automated?&quot; She \nstammered.\n&gt;     &quot;Yes! Apprently this was a outpost to begin colonization and \nthen the \n&gt; beast wars started. Then it became an observation post until an \nearthquake \n&gt; destroyed the bunker and killed the aliens. If anything happned the \nwarship \n&gt; would come to obliterate us so they could colonize the planet!&quot; \nTarantulas \n&gt; screamed.\n&gt;     &quot;That means that we have only....&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;Only a few days before the Armada arrives and destroys us all! \nI suggest \n&gt; we do something!!!!&quot; He hissed.\n&gt;     Aracnia, for the first time in her rulership felt utterly \nincompetent. \n&gt; She turned to Quickstrike, who, for some reason, she felt was the \nonly person \n&gt; whou could help her right now.\n\n\n"}}
