It was a mass of\ncomputer banks and relays, observation rooms, medical beds and a host\nof other things. Cyclonus took a moment to look around, Rodimus\ncomming in right behind him.\n\nRodimus glowered, obviously unhappy about being here, and being\nordered about by Cyclonus, his fists were balled and his stride was\nagressive and quick.\n\nCyclonus looked over at him, his optics never really leaving the more\nexcitable mech. &quot;I have given you all that you need to know about the\nArk.&quot; Cyclonus said, his voice calm and unruffled, sounding like he\nwas talking about the weather rather than worrying about wether\nRodimus would attack him or not. &quot;I&#39;m sure Hydras could use you in the\nsecurity section with him.&quot;\n\nRodimus nodded, &quot;Yes, RIGHT!&quot; he said as he glanced around the room,\nas if he didn&#39;t quite trust Cyclonus. &quot;But if you betray us, then you\nwill have to answer to ME!&quot; He said, his voice all agression and anger\nagain.\n\nCyclonus turned to face Rodimus fully, &quot;Of course.&quot; he said, his face\nstill calm, although there was a trace of something that flitted\nacross his face for a moment - anger? annoyance? humor? It was\ndifficult to tell. &quot;I would expect nothing less of you.&quot; Cyclonus said\nas he pointedly turned his back to Rodimus, a dismissal of a sort.\n\nRodimus just glared at Cyclonus, and for a long moment considered\ntaking out his gun and just blasting the ex-minion in the back. But\nfinally he just shook his head and left the room, the door slamming\nshut behind him.\n\nCylonus just shook his head, a slight smile appearing on his face,\n&quot;Perhaps there is hope for the boy yet.&quot; he said as he began work on\nupgrading the security of the room.\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
