Have you all dropped off the edge of \nCybertron?\n\nIC: : : Darkangel/DeathStar : :\n\nDarkangel was waiting for a reply from Tripredacus command when his \noptics move to Dreadplague. Was there something there? He was \nstudying her when he heard a voice comm over subspace.\n\nTripredacus Command, Cybertron: We have recieved your request agent \nDrakangel. We are currently scrambling support troops. Your personal \nrequest has already been met. Air Commander DeathStar is leaving as \nwe speak. Tripredacus Command, over and out.\n\nOn the surface of Cybertron a rather large group of Tripredacus \nflyers is assembled. Addressing the group is a large black bot, who \nlooks to have an alt mode of a star fighter.\n\nDeathStar: ... With that, I will be leaving you. General Arnot will \ntake over. I will be going to Earth to deal with our friends problems \nin these... Beast Wars. I bid you farewell my troops. Vehical mode!\n\nDeathStar transformes to his star fighter mode and blasts off towards \nthe transwarp rift, leaving Cybertron behind.\n\nBack on Cybertron, General Arnot has started to speak, when suddenly, \nan explosion shakes the area, terminating him. The flyers scramble.\n\nRandom Tripred Flyer #1: What in the name of Primus is going on?\n\nRandom Tripred Flyer #2: It&#39;s an attack! Must be the n....\n\nBefore the transformer can finish his sentence he is crushed as a \nblack and silver Earth semi-truck drives over him. Soon after, a \nblack and yellow Earth jet fires it&#39;s weapons, clearing the area, \nbefore landing next to the truck. The attacking vehicals transform to \ntheir robot modes.\n\nDiesel: So much for the recon mission, eh, Razor?\n\nRazor: Yeah, but it was more fun to blow them too bits, Diesel.\n\nA clicking of weapons being primed, attracts Razor and Diesel&#39;s \nattention again.\n\nRandom Tripred Flyer #3: Not all of us...\n\nRazor draws his plasma rifle from subspace as Diesel ignites his \nlaser rod sword.\n\nRazor: Diesel, old buddy, I think you may want to contact the rest of \nthe nWo...\n\nOOC: I just thought that showing the nWo doing what I had them leave \nEarth for, fighting the Tripredacus, would be cool. I&#39;m not \nreclaiming those chars or restarting the nWo.\n\n\n"}}
