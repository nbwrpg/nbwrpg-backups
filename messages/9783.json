I think is the first club I&#39;ve ever been too \nwhere a new post is put in every 30 seconds, which is great for \nmember imput. We are the friendliest, cheeriest bunch around. We&#39;re \nnot greedy or anything about winning, it&#39;s just Transformer Fun. I \njust wanna say thanks for making me a part of this.\n\nAnyway, our club is turning a whole year old. Also, we&#39;re coming up \nto the 10,000th message since using egroupes. And since that was only \na few months ago, it&#39;s a great feet. So what I was thinking was that \nwe should do somethimg to get together. You know, have everyone meet \nat the chatroom and talk about transformer stuff. It&#39;d be great! Tell \nme what you think about it.\n\n\n"}}
