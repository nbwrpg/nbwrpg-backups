Activating\n&gt; his com, he spoke to Zardus.  &lt;Zardus, this is Nemesis Enforcer, I&#39;m\nseeing\n&gt; that that weirdo Dracona has built himself a small base.  I&#39;m going to\ncrush\n&gt; it with Oblitertron.  I&#39;ll bring a head or something.\n&gt;\n&gt; Koga Shuko and CO stepped out of the bushes, Nemesis and them speaking\n&gt; (deciding to ally for the moment, Koga wanting the energy from Plintissa&#39;s\n&gt; base, and Nemesis not sure if he really minded, so they agree on a\ntemporary\n&gt; Alliance).\n&gt;\n&gt; Breakdown, Hiss, and Scavneger circled around, meeting up with the other\n&gt; side.  Everyone getting their most destructive weapons and reloading\nweapons,\n&gt; they attacked:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer yelled really loud:  &quot;ALL NON-DRACONA AFFILIATED PEOPLE,\n&gt; LEAVE, OR DIE, THIS BASE AND ITS FOLLOWERS WILL BE CRUSHED BY THE\nALLIANCE,\n&gt; BY ORDER OF THE HIGH-KING ZARDUS!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Koga Shuko, Anubis, Hades, and Unitron, with reloaded missile launchers,\neach\n&gt; fired a rocket off at the People&#39;s base.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer raised his own missile launcher, firing a rocket off at\nthe\n&gt; People&#39;s base.\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot lifted off into the air, throwing two charges set to explode\non\n&gt; impact off at the People&#39;s base.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark One fired off 25 explosive rounds at the People&#39;s base (from left to\n&gt; right along the base), leaping into the air.\n&gt;\n&gt; Breakdown fired off two grenades from his grenade launcher, leaping off\nafter\n&gt; Dark One.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pyro fired off two bursts of &#39;explosive&#39; flames, still in dragon mode,\n&gt; flapping his leathery wings after Dark One.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hiss fired off three fusion blasts at the People&#39;s base, leaping into the\n&gt; air, tossing a charge set to explode on impact off at the enemy base.\n&gt;\n&gt; Scavenger raised his missile launcher, getting down on one knee, firing\noff a\n&gt; rocket at the enemy base, lifting off into the air with a jump.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; (The next time they form, it will be much more descriptive)\n&gt;\n&gt;     Forming the head, shoulders, and torso (chest and abdomen and hip)),\nDark\n&gt; One began to fall to the ground, Breakdown transforming into an arm,\n&gt; attatching as the right arm, Pyro doing the same, only attatching as the\nleft\n&gt; arm.  Hiss transformed into a leg, attatching to the right side of the hip\nas\n&gt; the right leg, Scavenger attatching as the left leg.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Slamming to the ground, was a extremely heavy 45 ft tall gestalt,\n&gt; slamming a fist to itself, Nemesis almost falling, but regaining his\nbalance,\n&gt; a little marvelled.\n&gt;\n&gt; Koga Shuko sighed.  &quot;My technology, used for a group of lowly\n&gt; mercenaries...still this will be intersting to watch.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Oblitertron, the newly formed gestalt, yelled loudly, slamming another\n&gt; fist against his chest.  &quot;I live for obliteration!&quot; he yelled, pulling out\na\n&gt; huge sword from subspace (whatever the length of a sword is for say a 7 ft\n&gt; tall person is, it&#39;s the same for the 45 foot tall one, only for its\nsize).\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/10/_/_/_/959394045/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
