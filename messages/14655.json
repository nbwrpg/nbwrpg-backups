He really didn&#39;t like this bot. Not at \nall.\n\nThe Alliance bot lowers altitude, flying behind Deemos, and shooting two \nmissiles at the Maximal&#39;s back. It was no concern to Reptilica whether Psuedo \nwould be hit or not, because Psuedo wasn&#39;t an Alliance bot, but if Deemos \nblocked with Psuedo, he&#39;d be caught in the blast also.\n\nHaving fired the two missiles, Reptilica flies back up, seeing the Predacons \nretreating. He opens his comm-link. &quot;Hey, Preds,&quot; he says into it, sending it \non a Predacon frequency, &quot;What are you doing? Zardus didn&#39;t send us here to \nwhoop these Maxi&#39;s singlehandedly, ya know, ya gotta help.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike flies in behind Stronghold, DevilDuer coming up behind Blender. \nThe two Alliance bots open fire on the two Maximals, aiming for their heads.\n\n"}}
