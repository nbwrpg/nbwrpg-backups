Then, there was the void inside, in his spark. At the \n&gt; focus of both voids, there was the flaming wreck of the ship, \n&gt; bringing flashes in space and twinges in Templar&#39;s mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Templar: Why am I still living, while you, dear friend, are dead? \n&gt; Their is no more purpose left to me now, no reasons...\n&gt; \n&gt; The escape pod drifted aimlessly until a small piece of debris \n&gt; violently hit it. The propulsors let go of a silvery-white steam \nand \n&gt; started spinning very fast. Templar tried to force the controls to \n&gt; obey him, but he started welcoming this instant as the one \n&gt; preceeding his death.\n&gt; \n&gt; Templar: There it is, dear friend... I will join you nonetheless...\n&gt; \n&gt; He tried to stay conscious long enough to greet Death with arms \nwide \n&gt; open, but passed away before. However, the pod managed to place \n&gt; itself in Earth&#39;s orbit and to send out a wide range SOS signal. \nThe \n&gt; maximal origin of the message did betray its user, though.\n\n\n"}}
