First, she straightened her legs, \nthen she transformed, her pincer-tail forming her left arm, her \nmachine gun moving to her right. Her thrusters aligned in her back and \nher head popped up from her chest. Her white, blue and yellow colors \nshone in the sunlight. She finally spoke up.\n\nMeteara: Magnificient! This was a worthy demonstration! Perhaps even \nworthy of some beings more powerful than the Cybertronians! \nNow, I need to discuss with the one who is in charge of this group. \nThere are great things going on, and I need the cooperation of anyone \nwho can help me.\n\n\n"}}
