If Kups \nobservations are true then Her behavior could be a risk for herself and \nothers; we couldnt afford sedate her again I dont know how much her health \ncould stand it; If she Remembers you, you be able to calm her down enough to \navoid any umpleasant situation cause she has strong emotional attachments \nwith you and the other being that has stronger attachment is your Daughter \nand it&#39;s too young to put her in a risk... Speaking about risks, do you know \nif she still has my blaster?

Bump, for his small size was strong,\n&gt; easilly lifting the female onto the bed. He carefully placed her down\n&gt; on her back on the bed and then began to manipulate controls on the\n&gt; side of it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Twin scanners began to move across Nightlight, beepiing as they did\n&gt; so. &quot;The initial scan has begun.&quot; Bump said as he watched the results\n&gt; from his screen, Legacy moved to stand behind him, his single optic\n&gt; watching the screen carefully as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
