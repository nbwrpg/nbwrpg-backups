There&#39;s a legen=\r\nd that goes with them..  I remember it, but it&#39;s been a long time since I r=\r\nead up on it..  I found a pictograph of this legend, when I was on Atlantis=\r\n, and when I had spare time to restore old artifacts..  I think I found som=\r\ne sort of stone that was probably used for primative lithography...  Since =\r\nI was blind, I read it by feeling the indentations in the stone slates, tha=\r\nt I had found.  They were well carved...  Ahh, yes, I remember it.  Just ca=\r\nme to me now.  When you cut off a hydra&#39;s head, several more grow back in i=\r\nts place.  So striking his heads is out of the question.  But in this scrip=\r\nture there was a way to slay the hydra..  Yes, you strike its body with fir=\r\ne.  Once the body is stricken,even though the fire is something they breath=\r\ne, it can also be detrimental to them.  I don&#39;t know if it will work on Hyd=\r\nras Rodimus but if we can strike his body with the power of the Matrix that=\r\n we both hold within us, we may just be able to strike Hydras.  But I&#39;m not=\r\n completely sure of this.  It&#39;s only a legend on stone.&quot;\n\nNightshift moves =\r\nin on Darkwhawk and puts his knowledge of the Martial Arts to work for him.=\r\n  He side steps him in true Mantice fashion, and tries to confuse him and c=\r\natch a moment of pure distraction to use to his advantage.\n\n&quot; I got this gu=\r\nys.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Tucson Prime does get Legacy&#39;s message.  He replies.\n\n&quot; Th=\r\nis is Tucson Prime, I read you Legacy.  We have managed to round everyone u=\r\np, but we&#39;re still trying to apprehend Darkhawk.  Night Shift is attempting=\r\n that now.  Legacy, while I have your attention, I need to confirm some int=\r\nel with you, regarding an ancient legend about the mythical Hydra.  From wh=\r\nat I&#39;ve read, a hydra can not be killed by decapitation, which only promote=\r\ns the growth of multiple heads at one time.  Yet, in this legend, it gives =\r\nthe clue on how to slay the beast.  Direct fire is the only way to slay a h=\r\nydra.  Can this knowledge be adapted and utilized as a weapon against Hydra=\r\ns?  Can Rodimus and I use the powers within us to subdue him as this legend=\r\n fortells?  I wish to confirm this before I proceede.&quot;\n\nOutside, Rat Trap a=\r\nnd Quickstride also get the transmission.\n\n&quot;This is Rat Trap, I read ya Leg=\r\nacy, Quickstride&#39;n I are on standby out here, just in case they need a litt=\r\nle distraction and some backup.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston =\r\nCarroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: RODIMUS PRIME, SCOURGE, SCORPON=\r\nOK, CYCLONUS, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA,\n&gt; Kup, Tuscon, Nightshift, Darkhawk\n&gt; Loc=\r\nation: Black Fortress - Hallways\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson looks to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;R=\r\nodimus, Change of plan.
