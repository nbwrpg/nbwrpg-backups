She knew that showing such emotion wasn&#39;t easy for him, and she appreciated it. Tavatron&#39;s expression then became overcast as she remembered her friend. \n\nHe and Dinobot were so much alike! Perhaps that was why she had felt such a need to talk with Dinobot that first day. Suddenly Tavatron&#39;s expression became one of concern and worry as Dinobot began to waver and fall:\n\n&quot;Dinobot!&quot; Tavatron tried to help Dinobot stand but he was too heavy. Tavatron relunctantly let him fall to the ground. For a second she stood there in shock, then her survival instincts kicked in. \n\nTavatron kneeled at Dinobot&#39;s side. She tried to lift him, but to no avail. Tavatron was beginning to panic. She wan&#39;t going to let Dinobot die! She didn&#39;t want to lose another friend! \n\nTavatron wrapped her arms araound Dinobot&#39;s upper-body and began to drag him towards the ark. It was a slow and meticulous process, but eventually she was able to get him inside. Tavatron looked around the bridge and spied an empty CR chamber. \n\nWith much effort she dragged Dinobot across the bridge and deposited him in an open &#39;R chamber. She watched as the hatch closed, silently praying that he would be alright. Tavatron rested her head on her knees as she sat beside the &#39;R chamber. Her eyes slowly closed, she hadn&#39;t realized how tired she actually was. Tavatron fell into a deep slumber as she waited for Dinobot to emerge from the &#39;R chamber.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
