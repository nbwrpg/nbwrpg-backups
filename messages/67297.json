Unfortunately no one \n was \n &gt;  &gt;  there to notice.\n &gt;  &gt;  \n &gt;  &gt;  On the grounds of Atlantis the pursuit of Trelos continues as \n &gt;  several \n &gt;  &gt;  Maximals attempt to retrieve the rather elusive Predacon from \n his \n &gt;  &gt;  newest hiding spot, underwater. One boat is on the water \n &gt;  obviously \n &gt;  &gt;  searching, while a floating car hovers over the waters doing \n its \n &gt;  own \n &gt;  &gt;  search.

He is pointing at \n it. \n &gt;  And \n &gt;  &gt;  even as he is doing this he notes something strange coming \n from \n &gt;  &gt;  behind the eagle. The sky for a moment seems to flash and \n ripple, \n &gt;  &gt;  almost like lightning, and yet there is a slight rotation to \n the \n &gt;  &gt;  flashes. \n &gt;  &gt;  \n &gt;  &gt;  In the skies above the eagle looks down noting Rodimus \n pointing \n &gt;  at \n &gt;  &gt;  him, and he begins to drop out of the skies moving out over \n open \n &gt;  &gt;  water, preparing either to flee, or do a strafing run. In \n either \n &gt;  case \n &gt;  &gt;  he is totally unaware of what is transpiring over his head.\n &gt;  &gt;  \n &gt;  &gt;  On the grounds below Rodimus can see what is coming as his \n &gt;  enhanced \n &gt;  &gt;  vision sees two very tiny dots spiraling out from the rippling \n &gt;  &gt;  flashes. At the same time Klaxons begin to go off as base \n &gt;  computers \n &gt;  &gt;  do actually recognize this threat: MISSILES!\n &gt;  &gt;  \n &gt;  &gt;  Erupting out of the skies, twin missiles streak across the \n skies, \n &gt;  &gt;  vortexes of flames spiraling after them like crimson, cone \n shaped \n &gt;  &gt;  contrails. They slam into communication towers, and the towers \n as \n &gt;  &gt;  well as a few outlying buildings burst into flames. \n &gt;  &gt;  \n &gt;  &gt;  In the background, almost unnoticed, a Myrmidon spirals out of \n &gt;  the \n &gt;  &gt;  skies, the recipient of several laser blasts. Small gouts of \n &gt;  flames \n &gt;  &gt;  flowing from him even as he impacts the water. Myrmidon sinks \n &gt;  beneath \n &gt;  &gt;  the waves.\n &gt;  &gt;  \n &gt;  &gt;  And flying from amidst this bombardment Cyclonus rises high \n into \n &gt;  the \n &gt;  &gt;  air.\n &gt;  &gt;  \n &gt;  &gt;  &quot;The days you have known are over.

One boat is on the water &lt;br&gt; &gt;  obviously &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  searching, while a floating car hovers over the waters doing &lt;br&gt; its &lt;br&gt; &gt;  own &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  search. Meanwhile Rodimus has noted a rather odd dot in the &lt;br&gt; &gt;  skies, &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  one that he can see to be a Predacon eagle. He is pointing at &lt;br&gt; it. &lt;br&gt; &gt;  And &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  even as he is doing this he notes something strange coming &lt;br&gt; from &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  behind the eagle. The sky for a moment seems to flash and &lt;br&gt; ripple, &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  almost like lightning, and yet there\n is a slight rotation to &lt;br&gt; the &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  flashes. &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  In the skies above the eagle looks down noting Rodimus &lt;br&gt; pointing &lt;br&gt; &gt;  at &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  him, and he begins to drop out of the skies moving out over &lt;br&gt; open &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  water, preparing either to flee, or do a strafing run. In &lt;br&gt; either &lt;br&gt; &gt;  case &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  he is totally unaware of what is transpiring over his head.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  On the grounds below Rodimus can see what is coming as his &lt;br&gt; &gt;  enhanced &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  vision sees two very tiny dots spiraling out from the rippling &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  flashes. At the same time Klaxons begin to go off as base &lt;br&gt; &gt;  computers &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  do actually recognize this threat: MISSILES!&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  Erupting out of the skies, twin missiles streak across the &lt;br&gt; skies, &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  vortexes of flames spiraling after them like crimson, cone &lt;br&gt; shaped\n &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  contrails. They slam into communication towers, and the towers &lt;br&gt; as &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  well as a few outlying buildings burst into flames. &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  In the background, almost unnoticed, a Myrmidon spirals out of &lt;br&gt; &gt;  the &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  skies, the recipient of several laser blasts. Small gouts of &lt;br&gt; &gt;  flames &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  flowing from him even as he impacts the water. Myrmidon sinks &lt;br&gt; &gt;  beneath &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  the waves.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  And flying from amidst this bombardment Cyclonus rises high &lt;br&gt; into &lt;br&gt; &gt;  the &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  air.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &quot;The days you have known are over. All that you have belongs &lt;br&gt; to &lt;br&gt; &gt;  us! &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  Resist and be destroyed!! THE MINIONS OF UNICRON HAVE COME!&quot;&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  Even Cyclonus spoke sweeps arrive seeming to almost darken the &lt;br&gt; &gt;  skies &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  for a momsnt, disintegrator\n blasts providing bright flashes of &lt;br&gt; &gt;  light &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  as they bath Atlantis and the Maximal base in war.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  OOC: I am sure other Maximal and Predacon bases/HQ&#39;s will note &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  something similar to what the Maximal base in Atlantis noted, &lt;br&gt; &gt;  feel &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  free for anyone to jump in, if it makes sense. &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  The only thing of note is that the Sweeps and Scourge cannot &lt;br&gt; be &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  locked on to with sensors (check out their profiles on wiki). &lt;br&gt; &gt;  That &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  should not affect most of you very much, since most of you &lt;br&gt; shoot &lt;br&gt; &gt;  by &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  sight anyways, unless you are using base sensors or some &lt;br&gt; remote &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  sensing capability. &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  Also any Minions that chose to come with are in this group as &lt;br&gt; &gt; \n well.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;      &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;                                &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  ____________&lt;wbr&gt;_________&lt;wbr&gt;_________&lt;wbr&gt;_________&lt;wbr&gt;_________&lt;wbr&gt;__&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt; Do You Yahoo!?&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt; Tired of spam?
