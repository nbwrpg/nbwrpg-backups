But I ordered everyong to forget this and go to the meeting. \nBut, might as well let him get here, then we can all go back to base.&gt;\n\n* Iron Raptor then looked down at her friends again, all in one large heap. \nShe simply sighed, still noticing the small fuzz-ball under her fingers.\nShe looked ShadowCat and SnowTech over, they hadn&#39;t seemed to change from \nthe last time she had seen them.\nBut...she had changed...quite a bit.\nIron Raptor looked at the moving mass of arms and legs for a moment more \nbefore bending over and looking down at them, simply letting the small \ncat/bot go and leting her hands rest on her knees.*\n\n&quot; So, what brings you two here?&quot;\n\n* Since they couldn&#39;t hear her thoughts, verbal communication was needed. \nThough, she really didn&#39;t mind.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
