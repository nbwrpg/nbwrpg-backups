He can try to circle arou=\r\nnd, but that is a big circle.\n\n  &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &quot; Look, below us. THAT has=\r\n no right happening. Hydras has gone too far,\n  &gt; and it&#39;s time he was put =\r\nin his place!&quot;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; With a roar of sheer rage, he turns on the surroundi=\r\nng Predacons releasing a\n  &gt; powerful stream of fire, flames a bright hue o=\r\nf red, yellow and blue.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &quot; Now let&#39;s show Hydras what happens when h=\r\ne preys on innocent creatures!&quot;\n\n  &lt;NEW&gt;\n\n  What stands before TUSCON is ne=\r\narly ALL the Predacon forces. The\n  Fuzors SKYSHADOW, INJECTOR and BUZZCLAW=\r\n seemed to be keeping watch\n  with CYCLONUS flhing lead along with SCOURGE =\r\nand several sweeps.\n\n  DEEPSTRYKE floats high in the air as PHOBIA and BLAC=\r\nK RAZOR circle\n  about. as well as WASPINATOR who buzzes about angrilly as =\r\nhe watched.\n\n  They are all flying above miles and miles and miles of burni=\r\nng\n  dinosaurs. Beast and reptiles of all sorts! What sorts they were it is=\r\n\n  difficult to tell, being as they are on fire as the Maximals approach.\n =\r\n The stench is hideous, and most of the trees and surrounding scrub is\n  bu=\r\nrning along with the reptiles, the preds are darting all around the\n  super=\r\n large burning pyre.\n\n  That is until TUSCON starts firing.\n\n  &gt; &lt;OLD Strai=\r\nght Shot & Talon&gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; As Straight Shot rides with Talon, she picks up o=\r\nn Tucson&#39;s location and\n  &gt; from a far, realizes what is now transpiring be=\r\ntween him and Hydras! Still\n  &gt; in cross bow mode, she calibrates her syste=\r\nms and weight distribution to fit\n  &gt; Talon&#39;s configurations, for optimal r=\r\nesults.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &quot; Hydras! Ohhh I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s gonna face off with him=\r\n again! He\n  &gt; doesn&#39;t realize that he needs help! Wait, Ohh good, he&#39;s not=\r\n alone, Rodimus\n  &gt; is with him. But still, it doesn&#39;t hurt ta lend him a h=\r\nand. I better let\n  &gt; Leo Prime in on this, he&#39;s probably wondering why Tuc=\r\nson isn&#39;t contacting\n  &gt; him, which is something he&#39;s notorious for doing. =\r\n&quot;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; She opens her link to Leo Prime.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &quot; Leo Prime, it&#39;s me, St=\r\nraight Shot. Talon and I are reaching Tucson&#39;s\n  &gt; location shortly and I&#39;m=\r\n sure he hasn&#39;t contacted you yet. He&#39;s with\n  &gt; Rodimus and now he&#39;s facin=\r\ng off with Hydras. A lotta fire just got deployed\n  &gt; and I&#39;m definitely su=\r\nre it wasn&#39;t from Hydras. Tucson&#39;s in a really bad\n  &gt; mood, and I think it=\r\n&#39;s about ta get worse.&quot;\n\n  &lt;NEW&gt;\n\n  &quot;This is Leo. Judging from your locatio=\r\nn we are at least several hours\n  from you, and that that is for those of u=\r\ns who can fly. You had better\n  get Tuscon reigned in until we can get ther=\r\ne. Leo Prime. Out.&quot;\n\n  &gt; &lt;OLD - Straight Shot, Talon & Hydras&gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Much=\r\n to Straight Shot&#39;s suspicion, Tucson does indeed have the look of an\n  &gt; e=\r\nnraged predator on his draconic face. What he wouldn&#39;t do to be able to\n  &gt;=\r\n sink his sharp claws into Hydras, tearing at his armor until there was\n  &gt;=\r\n nothing left. Yet he holds enough restraint to hold back from doing so, fo=\r\nr\n  &gt; the time being.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &quot; Many innocent creatures who were native to =\r\nthis planet have lost their\n  &gt; lives needlessly, no thanks to you and your=\r\n reign of greed and destruction.\n  &gt; This is NOT our planet and we have NO =\r\nright taking away what belongs here!\n  &gt; That is what brings me here, Hydra=\r\ns! This planet deserves freedom and I am\n  &gt; here to make sure it gets it!&quot;=\r\n\n  &gt;\n  &gt; He exclaims with a loud draconic roar, as smoke seeps out of his f=\r\nlaring\n  &gt; nostrils as do a couple of white hot flames.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; With Rodimu=\r\ns still on his back, Tucson circles Hydras as the never ending\n  &gt; coils of=\r\n his long tail creates a ring around the enemy.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &quot;Rodimus, this is a=\r\nlso your chance to take back something that was taken\n  &gt; from you. No hold=\r\ns barred, do what you feel is the right thing, and what\n  &gt; you feel in you=\r\nr spark is rightful to your cause. I will follow suit. We\n  &gt; will fight as=\r\n one, and as one we will serve judgement to those who deserve\n  &gt; it. &quot;\n  &gt;=\r\n\n  &gt; He remains in his circling pattern, waiting for Rodimus to direct him,=\r\n in\n  &gt; hopes to help build his confidence as an Autobot Commander. At the =\r\nsame\n  &gt; time, Tucson had to learn to control his greatest weakness, his\n  =\r\n&gt; uncontrollable temper which left unchecked, had the potential to turn him=\r\n\n  &gt; into an extremely dangerous individual. Now that he takes on the role =\r\nof a\n  &gt; powerful creature, it would prove hard to quell the fire that burn=\r\ns deep\n  &gt; within his spark. He hoped that this partnership would help keep=\r\n the\n  &gt; balance between the both of them. They would need that more than e=\r\nver if\n  &gt; they have hopes of stopping Hydras for good.\n  &gt;\n\n  &lt;NEW&gt;\n\n  &quot;Tu=\r\nscon!&quot; RODIMUS imperiously said from TUSCON&#39;s back. &quot;That&#39;s alot of\n  Preda=\r\ncons out there. Unless you have some back up out here that I\n  don&#39;t know a=\r\nbout we are a long way from home.&quot; RODIMUS looked around,\n  &quot;I see Cyclonus=\r\n, have you seen Hydras yet?&quot;\n\n  It was not fear that moved RODIMUS in all t=\r\nhis, but a warrior&#39;s\n  caution. Even the most fearless of warriors had to k=\r\nnow when the odds\n  were stacked against them, and when they had even a sno=\r\nwball&#39;s chance\n  of winning a fight. As RODIMUS pulled out his rifle and ta=\r\nrgeted the\n  Predacons, he could not help wondering if he fires will it get=\r\n them\n  all killed, and if TUSCON wanted to them to go down in some blaze o=\r\nf\n  glory. Even two primes cannot stand up to the entire Predacon forces!\n\n=\r\n  CYCLONUS and HYDRAS were by themsevles their equals and at the moment\n  H=\r\nYDRAS was not visible, which made the situation even more dangerous.\n  And =\r\nthat was not counting all the other Predacons just waiting to blow\n  them o=\r\nut of the air.\n\n  &quot;What are you doing here.&quot; CYCLONUS&#39; voice came over the =\r\ncomlink over\n  a general frequency. &quot;We have no quarel with you this night.=\r\n Continue\n  firing on us and we will wipe you from the skies.&quot;\n\n  There was=\r\n a wicked chuckle from SKYSHADOW, &quot;I don&#39;t think these two\n  would try to t=\r\nake on the entire Predacon army. Maybe they came to be\n  the dino beasts al=\r\nong with us?&quot;\n\n  &quot;He is full of enough hot air.&quot; SCOURGE said, sounding alm=\r\nost eager to\n  fight. &quot;Maybe he can put it to some good use.&quot; SCOURGE&#39;s swe=\r\neps began\n  to circle outwards their weapons charging but not yet firing.\n\n=\r\n  &quot;Finish burning the dinosaurs.&quot; CYCLONUS barked to the other Predacons\n  =\r\nwho seemed to be approaching. &quot;Make sure none of the crazed beasts\n  rises =\r\nagain.&quot;\n\n  CYCLONUS, SCOURGE and the sweeps slid foward, &quot;We will deal with=\r\n these\n  intruders.&quot; DEEPSTRYKE PHOBIA and BLACK RAZOR slid in behind them.=\r\n\n\n  DEEPSTRYKE sent HYDRAS a message alerting him to TUSCON&#39;s and RODIMUS&#39;\n=\r\n  appearance and the approach of a flying Maximal.

I would im=\r\nagine that Tuscon is about the same size as&lt;BR&gt;Optimus \n  Primal, who is ap=\r\nproximately 10 feet tall. Since Maximals&lt;BR&gt;don;t size change \n  all that m=\r\nuch, the dragon mode should also be about&lt;BR&gt;10 feet long, with the \n  tail=\r\n maybe giving him another 3 - 5 feet or&lt;BR&gt;length and the wings perhaps \n  =\r\nalmost the same width. he would not&lt;BR&gt;feasibly be able to surround the Pre=\r\nds, \n  especailly as far out as they&lt;BR&gt;are spaced. He can try to circle ar=\r\nound, but \n  that is a big circle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot; Look, below \n  us. THAT has no right happening. Hydras has gone too far,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; and it&#39;s \n  time he was put in his place!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; With a r=\r\noar of sheer rage, he \n  turns on the surrounding Predacons releasing a&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; powerful stream of \n  fire, flames a bright hue of red, yellow and blu=\r\ne.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot; Now let&#39;s \n  show Hydras what happens when he preys on=\r\n innocent \n  creatures!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What stands before TUSCO=\r\nN is nearly ALL \n  the Predacon forces. The&lt;BR&gt;Fuzors SKYSHADOW, INJECTOR a=\r\nnd BUZZCLAW seemed to \n  be keeping watch&lt;BR&gt;with CYCLONUS flhing lead alon=\r\ng with SCOURGE and several \n  sweeps.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;DEEPSTRYKE floats high in the =\r\nair as PHOBIA and BLACK RAZOR \n  circle&lt;BR&gt;about. as well as WASPINATOR who=\r\n buzzes about angrilly as he \n  watched.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They are all flying above m=\r\niles and miles and miles of \n  burning&lt;BR&gt;dinosaurs. Beast and reptiles of =\r\nall sorts! What sorts they were it \n  is&lt;BR&gt;difficult to tell, being as the=\r\ny are on fire as the Maximals \n  approach.&lt;BR&gt;The stench is hideous, and mo=\r\nst of the trees and surrounding \n  scrub is&lt;BR&gt;burning along with the repti=\r\nles, the preds are darting all around \n  the&lt;BR&gt;super large burning pyre.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That is until TUSCON starts \n  firing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD Straight S=\r\nhot &amp; Talon&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As \n  Straight Shot rides with Talon, s=\r\nhe picks up on Tucson&#39;s location and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  from a far, realizes what i=\r\ns now transpiring between him and Hydras! \n  Still&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in cross bow mod=\r\ne, she calibrates her systems and weight \n  distribution to fit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tal=\r\non&#39;s configurations, for optimal \n  results.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot; Hydras! Ohhh=\r\n I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s gonna face off \n  with him again! He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t =\r\nrealize that he needs help! Wait, Ohh good, \n  he&#39;s not alone, Rodimus&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; is with him. But still, it doesn&#39;t hurt ta \n  lend him a hand. I better=\r\n let&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Leo Prime in on this, he&#39;s probably \n  wondering why Tucson is=\r\nn&#39;t contacting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him, which is something he&#39;s \n  notorious for doing.=\r\n &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; She opens her link to Leo \n  Prime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot; Le=\r\no Prime, it&#39;s me, Straight Shot. Talon and I are \n  reaching Tucson&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; location shortly and I&#39;m sure he hasn&#39;t contacted \n  you yet. He&#39;s with&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Rodimus and now he&#39;s facing off with Hydras. A \n  lotta fire just g=\r\not deployed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and I&#39;m definitely sure it wasn&#39;t from \n  Hydras. Tucso=\r\nn&#39;s in a really bad&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mood, and I think it&#39;s about ta get \n  worse.&quot;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;This is Leo. Judging from your location we \n  ar=\r\ne at least several hours&lt;BR&gt;from you, and that that is for those of us who =\r\n\n  can fly. You had better&lt;BR&gt;get Tuscon reigned in until we can get there.=\r\n Leo \n  Prime. Out.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Straight Shot, Talon &amp; \n  Hy=\r\ndras&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Much to Straight Shot&#39;s suspicion, Tucson does \n  =\r\nindeed have the look of an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; enraged predator on his draconic face. W=\r\nhat \n  he wouldn&#39;t do to be able to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sink his sharp claws into Hydra=\r\ns, tearing \n  at his armor until there was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; nothing left. Yet he hol=\r\nds enough \n  restraint to hold back from doing so, for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the time \n  =\r\nbeing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot; Many innocent creatures who were native to this \n =\r\n planet have lost their&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lives needlessly, no thanks to you and your=\r\n \n  reign of greed and destruction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This is NOT our planet and we h=\r\nave NO \n  right taking away what belongs here!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; That is what brings =\r\nme here, \n  Hydras! This planet deserves freedom and I am&lt;BR&gt;&gt; here to m=\r\nake sure it \n  gets it!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He exclaims with a loud draconic r=\r\noar, as smoke \n  seeps out of his flaring&lt;BR&gt;&gt; nostrils as do a couple o=\r\nf white hot \n  flames.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; With Rodimus still on his back, Tucs=\r\non circles Hydras \n  as the never ending&lt;BR&gt;&gt; coils of his long tail cre=\r\nates a ring around the \n  enemy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Rodimus, this is also you=\r\nr chance to take back \n  something that was taken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; from you. No hold=\r\ns barred, do what you feel \n  is the right thing, and what&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you feel=\r\n in your spark is rightful to \n  your cause. I will follow suit. We&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n will fight as one, and as one we \n  will serve judgement to those who dese=\r\nrve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it. &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He \n  remains in his circling pattern, wa=\r\niting for Rodimus to direct him, in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  hopes to help build his conf=\r\nidence as an Autobot Commander. At the \n  same&lt;BR&gt;&gt; time, Tucson had to =\r\nlearn to control his greatest weakness, \n  his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; uncontrollable tempe=\r\nr which left unchecked, had the potential to \n  turn him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; into an ex=\r\ntremely dangerous individual. Now that he takes on \n  the role of a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n powerful creature, it would prove hard to quell the fire \n  that burns dee=\r\np&lt;BR&gt;&gt; within his spark. He hoped that this partnership would \n  help ke=\r\nep the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; balance between the both of them. They would need that \n  mo=\r\nre than ever if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; they have hopes of stopping Hydras for \n  good.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Tuscon!&quot; RODIMUS imperiously said \n  from T=\r\nUSCON&#39;s back. &quot;That&#39;s alot of&lt;BR&gt;Predacons out there. Unless you have \n  so=\r\nme back up out here that I&lt;BR&gt;don&#39;t know about we are a long way from home.=\r\n&quot; \n  RODIMUS looked around,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;I see Cyclonus, have you seen Hydras \n  yet=\r\n?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was not fear that moved RODIMUS in all this, but a \n  warrior&#39;=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;caution. Even the most fearless of warriors had to know when the \n  od=\r\nds&lt;BR&gt;were stacked against them, and when they had even a snowball&#39;s \n  cha=\r\nnce&lt;BR&gt;of winning a fight. As RODIMUS pulled out his rifle and targeted \n  =\r\nthe&lt;BR&gt;Predacons, he could not help wondering if he fires will it get \n  th=\r\nem&lt;BR&gt;all killed, and if TUSCON wanted to them to go down in some blaze \n  =\r\nof&lt;BR&gt;glory. Even two primes cannot stand up to the entire Predacon \n  forc=\r\nes!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;CYCLONUS and HYDRAS were by themsevles their equals and at the \n=\r\n  moment&lt;BR&gt;HYDRAS was not visible, which made the situation even more \n  d=\r\nangerous.&lt;BR&gt;And that was not counting all the other Predacons just waiting=\r\n \n  to blow&lt;BR&gt;them out of the air.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;What are you doing here.&quot; CYCLO=\r\nNUS&#39; \n  voice came over the comlink over&lt;BR&gt;a general frequency. &quot;We have n=\r\no quarel \n  with you this night. Continue&lt;BR&gt;firing on us and we will wipe =\r\nyou from the \n  skies.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There was a wicked chuckle from SKYSHADOW, &quot;=\r\nI don&#39;t think these \n  two&lt;BR&gt;would try to take on the entire Predacon army=\r\n. Maybe they came to \n  be&lt;BR&gt;the dino beasts along with us?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;He is=\r\n full of enough hot air.&quot; \n  SCOURGE said, sounding almost eager to&lt;BR&gt;figh=\r\nt. &quot;Maybe he can put it to some \n  good use.&quot; SCOURGE&#39;s sweeps began&lt;BR&gt;to =\r\ncircle outwards their weapons charging \n  but not yet firing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Finis=\r\nh burning the dinosaurs.&quot; CYCLONUS barked to \n  the other Predacons&lt;BR&gt;who =\r\nseemed to be approaching. &quot;Make sure none of the \n  crazed beasts&lt;BR&gt;rises =\r\nagain.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;CYCLONUS, SCOURGE and the sweeps slid \n  foward, &quot;We will de=\r\nal with these&lt;BR&gt;intruders.&quot; DEEPSTRYKE PHOBIA and BLACK \n  RAZOR slid in b=\r\nehind them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;DEEPSTRYKE sent HYDRAS a message alerting \n  him to TUSC=\r\nON&#39;s and RODIMUS&#39;&lt;BR&gt;appearance and the approach of a flying \n  Maximal.
