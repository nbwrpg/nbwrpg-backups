She remembered why she ran \nin the first place and wanted to cange into a maximal.  It was \nbecause she found out how cold the predacon spark really was.  She \ncouldn&#39;t stay here and feel apart of the predacon team.  She was \npredacon now.  She felt her spark tearing in two.  She held down her \nemotions and swallowed her pride.  They had just retrieved her and \nwould be watching her.  She would bide her time and wait until the \ntime was right. But that time wasn&#39;t now. Later. It would be later.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
