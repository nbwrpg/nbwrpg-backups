He was a very\n&gt; good person to RP with, one of the best in fact. I will surely miss\n&gt; him.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will also participate in the day of silence, and I&#39;ll put a\n&gt; memorial on the Members page. However, I didn&#39;t know Minime\n&gt; personally, I only RPed with him, so I will need some help making the\n&gt; memorial.\n&gt;\n&gt; He left me Fliq when he left NBW, and I never really got to RPing him\n&gt; (Fliq), but I will start now and RP him alot. I hope Minime is in a\n&gt; better place now.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
