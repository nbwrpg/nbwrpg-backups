There has only been one person ever kicked out of \nNBW, and he was kicked out because he couldn&#39;t comprehend the concept \nof people having their own characters. If you guys sent insultive \nemails for no reason, I would be a bit ticked off, but this has \nreason and its understandable.\n\nAlso keep in mind that no moderator (except for me, but that&#39;s \nbecause I manage the NBWRPG eGroups list) can kick anyone out without \nthe aproval of the other moderators. So ticking one person off \nwouldn&#39;t be enough to get you booted.\n\nMy point is: its all fine and well if you&#39;re talking someone off when \nyou have a reason, and if you&#39;re not using offensive language *glares \nat Robo*, but the &quot;if this gets me kicked out&quot; parts are probably the \nmost annoying.\n\nAlso, I know you guys had reason and that&#39;s why I&#39;m calm right now, \nbut please keep down all the major insults. If this ends up with a \nflame war over the posting board, I&#39;m gonna have to start moderating \npeople. If you guys get replies to your anti-JP posts, reply to those \nreplies privately. Thanx.\n\n\n"}}
