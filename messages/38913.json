You\n&gt;don&#39;t just sound misenformed but like a sheep baaaaing the normal\n&gt;opinion out loud. The Americans had nothing to do with our independance,\n&gt;it was all the British decission, either do some research or stop\n&gt;running your mouth.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
