With a few deft touches Cyclonus sent off\na few orders as he glanced up and looked at the female as she sat on\nthe stairs in front of the throne.\n\n&quot;Greetings.&quot; he said to the female as he walked over to her. &quot;I know\nthat this has been a trying time for you.&quot; Cyclonus said, his voice\nand movements elegant, strong and yet graceful. Cyclonus stood tall\nand robust, his armor shined purple and white, glinting slightly in\nthe relfected light of the room. He was like a powerful knight of some\ngreat reknowned speaking to a fair princesses.\n\nCyclonus folded one hand behind his back as he reached down with\nother, bowing his head slightly in an almost courtly gesture. His\nfingers were strong yet somehow gentle as sought to grasp the Lady&#39;s\nhand and help her to her feet. Tilting his head up and to the side\nslightly Cyclonus looked at her, his penatrating gaze staring into\nhers, &quot;What is your name?&quot; he said.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
