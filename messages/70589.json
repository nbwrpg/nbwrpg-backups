The exchange of energy was mysteriously not taxing on Tucson as =\r\nit would have been if he had transfered his own spark energy into his chest=\r\n. This was a power that was saved for many years in the hopes that one day,=\r\n it&#39;s energy would be needed for a greater purpose. This was that day. And =\r\nas Vestige came alive, his heart felt all the more energized as it filled e=\r\nndlessly with the joy of hope he had for his new friend.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I hope never=\r\n to lose you my friend, you&#39;ve helped me in more ways than I can describe. =\r\nYou&#39;ve given me new found hope that adversity can be overcome, and now I pa=\r\nss on that power of hope to you. We can do this, we will awaken Rodimus and=\r\n through our compassion for each other, we may just be able to exterminate =\r\nthis enemy for good.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nVesitige nodded, for once his movements were =\r\nnot the movements of an\nold machine but one that was new and vibrant, as if=\r\n he stepped off the\nassembly line. Vestige slid out of Tuscon&#39;s cab and sto=\r\nod beside him,\nhis body seemingly larger and more imposing. He turned to lo=\r\nok at\nTuscon, a familiar rougish look on his features, similar to one that\n=\r\nRodimus may have worn at different times. &quot;Yes it is time.&quot; His voice\ngrim =\r\nand determined.\n\nWith a deft movement and while being careful to keep his a=\r\nttacks away\nfrom the figure on the table, he laid down some cover fire betw=\r\neen he\nand the approaching insectoid alien creatures to give Tuscon time to=\r\n\ntransform or to do whatever thought he had in mind.\n\nMeanwhile the figure =\r\non the table continued to stir, it was as if it\nwas fighting something. It =\r\nwas only then that it became obvious that\nit was being held down by straps =\r\nor tendrils. The figure&#39;s movements\nwere steadily getting weaker as it atte=\r\nmpted to fight its way out.\n\nAs all this was happening a persistant buzzing=\r\n and even a rumbling\ncould be heard in the background. It would seem that t=\r\nhe attacks had\nbeen noticed and something was comming!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
