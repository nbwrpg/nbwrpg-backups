That too is turning out\n&gt; to be a challenge for him,=\r\n because Ratchet may have been the chief CMO, but\n&gt; never a Prime.  Tucson,=\r\n who is very much like Ratchet, is a Prime who is\n&gt; having to work with tem=\r\nperament issues as well as the issues impacting\n&gt; everyone else.\n&gt;\n&gt; When R=\r\nodimus started sassing the Preds while on Tucson&#39;s back, Tucson was\n&gt; tryin=\r\ng desperately to form an alliance and was not in the mood for snide\n&gt; comme=\r\nntary.  His reaction was similar to how Ratchet might have commented on\n&gt; i=\r\nt.  Good thing Rodimus didn&#39;t get the classic &quot; Give me one good reason why=\r\n\n&gt; I shouldn&#39;t reformat your hard drive and turn you into a garbage scow!&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; But when Tucson lost his temper Rodimus may have picked up on his voice\n&gt;=\r\n pattern which sounds EXACTLY like Ratchet when he lost his temper.  I don&#39;=\r\nt\n&gt; recall Rodimus&#39;s relationship with Ratchet but he could probably get an=\r\n idea\n&gt; that Tucson is from the same mold as the old CMO.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually o=\r\nn the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sep 18, 2011, at 7:13 AM, Super Cycl=\r\nonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Good, wonderful, excellent!=\r\n I have no problems with that!\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope to post later today or tommorrow.=\r\n It has been a busy weekend.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Sep 17, 2011 at 7:32=\r\n PM, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; **\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, his r=\r\noar is the equivalent of what one would feel after the initial\n&gt;&gt; boom of a=\r\n thunderhead .

I could see the ground thing in that&lt;br&gt;much like a loud sound could=\r\n rattle your chest, like at a conscert and&lt;br&gt;you can feel the beat in your=\r\n chest. But what do you mean by flashes&lt;br&gt;of lightning?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Just makin=\r\ng sure I have a clear understanding before I have a clear&lt;br&gt;understanding.=\r\n Tuscon&#39;s sonic roar could be as loud as thunder and&lt;br&gt;even perhaps so=\r\nund like it, but would not be thunder in the sense of&lt;br&gt;\nbeing part of the=\r\n weather patterns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For instance nearby thunder can range as loud as =\r\n120 Db. For&lt;br&gt;references: This is roughly the equivalent to being within 2=\r\n00 feet of&lt;br&gt;a jet aircraft during take-off or about 3 feet from an auto h=\r\norn. A&lt;br&gt;\nchain saw is rated around 100 decibels. A sound of 140 decibels =\r\nis&lt;br&gt;painfully loud. [Note each 10 decibel increase in noise level seems&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;twice as loud.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would imagine that Tuscon is probrably like Braw=\r\nl in this matter,&lt;br&gt;\nbut more effective in its use, meaning he can hit at =\r\nalmost 300 Db if&lt;br&gt;conscentrated into a blast, probrably 200 in a cone and=\r\n 150 in a wave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;300 (BEAM) can blow out metal and concrete and such =\r\nlike. Basically as&lt;br&gt;\npowerful as any blast Megatron, Gavatron, Optimus Pr=\r\nime, Rodimus or&lt;br&gt;any other leader type can deliver. It is just created fr=\r\nom Sonic&lt;br&gt;energies rather than more conventional energies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;200 (CO=\r\nNE) Could concievably kill a human and probrably cause serious&lt;br&gt;\ndamage o=\r\nn some of the sensative inner workings of a transformer. Could&lt;br&gt;do things=\r\n like blow out glass and other unprotected crystalized&lt;br&gt;materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;150 (CIRCLE) Painfully loud and POSSIBLY stunning affects.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Here is=\r\n a list of Db counts. I cannot say I would follow it&lt;br&gt;religiously, since =\r\nthis is a Scifi settings and the transformers are&lt;br&gt;not human, but it woul=\r\nd give you an idea and could spark creativity.&lt;br&gt;However some things may n=\r\not work exactly as planned. So if you are&lt;br&gt;\ngoing to try something specia=\r\nl, PLEASE talk it over with me first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.makeitlo=\r\nuder.com/Decibel%20Level%20Chart.txt&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://www.makeitlouder.com/Decibel%20Level%20Chart.txt&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://www.makeitlouder.com/Decibel%20Level%20Chart.txt&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot;&gt;http://www.makeitlouder.com/Decibel%20Level%20Chart.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;I hope all this gives food for thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Preston&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 9/17=\r\n/11, Sandy Panico &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;magicquartz@...=\r\nm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps just the lightning flashes would suff=\r\nice.
