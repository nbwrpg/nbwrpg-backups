He could hear that there was s=\r\nomeone near him, and slowly he rolls right up to Talon and remains in his S=\r\nUV mode.  He wanted to know why there was such a gathering of Maximals.  Ev=\r\nen though he could not see anyone or anything he could hear that there was =\r\na large gathering at the tower.  Sensing someone next to him, he puts himse=\r\nlf in park so is not to roll accidentally on someone&#39;s foot or paw, as the =\r\ncase may be.  \n\n&quot; There seems to be a large gathering of some sort.

He suspaces his cross =\r\nbow over his shoulder, as the mechanisms over his back latch it in place. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sounds like this could be important. I better try to get to the tower=\r\n, and see what the transmission is about. Sorry cross bow, you&#39;ll have to w=\r\nait a while&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; With his sight impaired, he turns to his sonar system at=\r\nop his helmet, and throws off a sonar wave, which he hoped would bounce off=\r\n the tower, and back to him, giving Tucson the exact coordinates in which t=\r\no follow. He also knew that being on wheels would be faster than trying to =\r\ngo there on foot. Metal plates soon shift and within moments he is transfor=\r\nmed into his vehicular mode.

It had taken three weeks to clear the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nrubble and begin rebuilding; the Maximal base however, was a total\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lo=\r\nss: only the lower level remained, which merely contained a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed=\r\n ractor system and the prison cells, which concievably be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; modified to=\r\n be used by the loca police.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;So you&#39;ll be leaving us?&quot; asked t=\r\nhe mayor, already knowing the answer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yes.
