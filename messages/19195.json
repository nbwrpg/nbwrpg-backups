He roars, falling to the ground, but firing \nmore missiles at Shokaract.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Yikes, a few months ago, when I had a 6 bot gestalt, I was \naccused of\n&gt; moding by Unitron (No offene) for breaking the giant bot rule. Ouch.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: Shokaract was covered with a cloud of smoke. The smoke clears.\n&gt; Shokaract is still standing, he looks up at WarMachine, the horns \non pne\n&gt; side of his head dangling.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shokaract: Uhh, you do not know my power.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shokaract had been charging some negative energy to use through the \nMatrix\n&gt; of Conquest, and he decided now was the time to use it. It had the \npower to\n&gt; make one large blast be the power of 10 Large blasts, but he could \nonly use\n&gt; one before having to recharge. Shokaract pulls the energy into his \nhands,\n&gt; making him glow and making rocks around him melt as they were \ncaught in it.\n&gt; He fired the single blast, it moved very quickly towards WarMachine,\n&gt; Shokaract intending them to split apart again...\n\n\n"}}
