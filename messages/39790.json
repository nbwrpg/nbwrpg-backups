He looked up and saw two birds peacefully fly by.\n&quot;YUCK.&quot; Apeface said, more brutish than normal. &quot;This planet more gross\nthan me remember.&quot; he finished, as his surroundings began to change. The\ntree easily gave way to Tremor&#39;s huge form, and began to topple. Apeface\nmeerly crouched down, his hinges making a loud noise, and then used his\npowerful legs, to spring to another tree, as he held on with both feet\nand a hand, he looked down. &quot;Watch it.&quot; He hollard, as he let himself\nslide down the tree. He landed on the ground, beside Tremor. Spasma\nopened up a line to the D.E.D ship. \n\n&quot;Spasma to Scrapper, Spasma to Scrapper.&quot; he began, but got frustrated.\n&quot;Our commlinks are being jammed, by some type of energon, only the ships\nis powerful enough to travel these long distances.&quot; he finished, looking\ndown to Apeface. Apeface looked annoyed.\n\n&quot;Fine.&quot; He blurted. &quot;We head back to base, you keep searching.&quot; he told\nTremor, as he leapt off of the ground, and transformed. Spasma leapt\noff, long enough to land in the cockpit. The ships engines then roared\nto life, as he headed back towards MT. Fuji.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nNightmare finished his salute to Havotron, then walked towards the\nchamber, and opened it up. Nothing. For the first time, Nightmare showed\nemotion, he was confused. &quot;Computer, what happened to unit Spinister?&quot;\nhe asked.\n\nBehind Havotron, however, a low exchange of oxygen, could be heard.\n&quot;Spinister, reporting.&quot; the voice whispered, almost to quietly for\nHavotron to hear.\n\n"}}
