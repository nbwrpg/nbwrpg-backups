She sneered, exposing the jagged teeth at the upper side of her mouth. She couldn&#39;t take the time to dodge as Megatron grabbed her by her throat, clamping the teeth of his plasma blaster on her. \n&lt;P&gt;&quot;I am most displeased with you, Cyber Claw, y-yes.&quot; he said. Cyber Claw squinted at him, with no big struggle. &quot;I gave you an order, but you ignored it!&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;Cyber Claw gasped. &quot;I couldn&#39;t&#39; do it, Megatron,&quot; she said. &quot;He is my species.&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;Megatron sneer back. &quot;I heard you before. But honestly, my dear Cyber Claw &lt;EM&gt;I don&#39;t care&lt;/EM&gt;! You are a Predacon, he is a Maximal! I made you on his DNA---&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;&quot;I was curious,&quot; Cyber Claw said. &quot;He is my species. It was only instinct to be curious of my own species.&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;&quot;Instinct? The clone before you had no instinct of his species. He took orders.&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;Cyber Claw threw his arm off of her. &quot;He was a drone!&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;&quot;And so are you!&quot; Megatron shouted back. &quot;You are mine, therefore you follow my orders and never question me! Terrorsaur follows my orders, Scorpinok follows my orders, Waspinator follows my orders---&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;&quot;They are nothing compared to me!&quot; Cyber Claw shouted. &quot;I am smarter and more powerful than they are!&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;&quot;Oh, but you must keep in mind, that I am your superior,&quot; Megatron said. &quot;You don&#39;t question my orders! I let you off on the first time, but this one you won&#39;t be so lucky.&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;&quot;The Inferno with your orders!&quot; Cyber Claw shouted. &quot;You are a fool! You could have dealt with Optimus Primal, but instead you came and attacked me! What does that prove of your &lt;EM&gt;great &lt;/EM&gt;leadership? Nothing! Your nothing but slag sucking, alien loving, Maximal killing, velociraptor obsessed, self talking, teeth picking, station thieving, can&#39;t fix a ship worth a scrap pile,&quot; she took a breath. &quot;Son of a maintenance bot!&quot; \n&lt;P&gt;There was&nbsp; a long pause, then Megatron fired. \n&lt;P&gt; \n&lt;P&gt;Cyber Claw jerked awake from her memory, hearing something from her tail. She looked over and saw the raptor she meet in the edge of her forest. &quot;You!&quot; she screamed. She leaped up, crashing through the leaves and branches. She slashed her inner toe claw at her neck.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
