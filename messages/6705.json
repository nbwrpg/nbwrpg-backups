Simply give me what I want.&quot;\n\nThe Maximal captain shakes his head. &quot;Us Maximals don&#39;t give in to that. I \nsuggest you retreat. You&#39;re outnumbered three to one.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then you die,&quot; DeathScythe says, his voice no more than a whisper.\n\nSeveral seconds pass, feeling like hours to the four bots.\n\nWithout warning, DeathScythe jumps forward, his fist slamming into the head \nof one of the Maximals, knocking him unconscious. The other two jump at him, \nDeathScythe ducking, the other two slamming into each other. With an upward \npunch, he sends the Maximals flying into opposite sides of the room.\n\nThe captain stands up, the other Maximal obvioustly knocked unconscious. \nDeathScythe grins.\n\n&quot;So... The heroic Maximals try a three on one battle. How pathetic!&quot; \nDeathScythe&#39;s grin broadens, the assassin reaching behind him. The Maximal \ncommander jumps forward, swinging a fist at DeathScythe.\n\nDeathScythe sidesteps, the hand behind his back producing a dagger, which he \nstabs downward into the Maximal&#39;s neck. The captain&#39;s eyes widen, his body \nflying into a comp console, the console exploding.\n\nThe ship that they were all in goes into a spin, dipping down toward a blue \nplanet. DeathScythe is thrown against the wall, going unconscious.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe impact as the ship hits down in Africa is tremendous. The systems of the \nship blink out, the DNA replicator the only one left online, but barely.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDeathScythe opens his eyes.\n\n&quot;I see you&#39;re awake.&quot;\n\nThe assassin looks over at the source of the voice, his eyes widening. The \nbot standing in front of him was the Maximal captain, holding his own head in \nhis arms.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you to wake up,&quot; says the captain&#39;s head.\n\n&quot;W-w-w-w-w-w,&quot; DeathScythe mumbles, trying to form words, &quot;W-what happened to \nyour head?&quot;\n\n&quot;My head?&quot; the head frowns, then suddenly opens its mouth, &quot;Oh! My head! Oh, \nyou knocked it off in that fight.&quot;\n\nDeathScythe shakes his head. &quot;No I didn&#39;t, I stabbed you in the neck with a \ndagger.&quot;\n\n&quot;Are you sure?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\nThe head frowns, &quot;Oh, you must be right.&quot;\n\nThe captain lifts his head to his shoulders, the wound healing. He then takes \nout a dagger and stabs it into his own neck. &quot;That better?&quot;\n\nEyes widened in astonishment, DeathScythe nods.\n\n&quot;Good. Follow me.&quot;\n\nSilently, DeathScythe stands up, walking after the Maximal captain. The \nhallway they were walking down looked strange, circular, and dripping with \nsomething.\n\n&quot;Where are we?&quot;\n\n&quot;In me.&quot;\n\n&quot;What??&quot; DeathScythe stops, looking at the Maximal.\n\n&quot;In me,&quot; the captain says patiently, &quot;I think we&#39;re in my abdomen.&quot;\n\n&quot;No we&#39;re not. You&#39;re right there. I can&#39;t be inside you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure you can, just shut up and follow.&quot;\n\nDeathScythe growls. This Maximal was pissing him off. The assassin swings his \nfist at the Maximals&#39;s head.\n\nThe fist passes through the head, the Maximal turning around.\n\n&quot;That was rude,&quot; he says simply.\n\nDeathScythe blinks. He had been expecting the Maximal to get hit and fall \nunconscious. &quot;What was?&quot;\n\n&quot;Pointing that spoon at me.&quot;\n\n&quot;What spoon?&quot;\n\n&quot;The one in your left hand.&quot;\n\nDeathScythe looks down at his left hand, surprised to see a small silver \nspoon in it.\n\n&quot;Um........&quot; he says, continuing to follow the Maximal. He was now completely \nconfused, &quot;Are you sure we&#39;re inside you?&quot;\n\nThe Maximal turns around with an annoyed look on his face, &quot;Look, this is my \ndream, and whatever I say goes!&quot;\n\nDeathScythe&#39;s mouth opens, trying to say something, but to confused to decide \nwhat to say. &quot;Your dream?!&quot; he finally blurts out, &quot;If this is a dream, it&#39;s \nmy dream!&quot;\n\nDeathScythe lifts his left hand, about to throw the spoon at the Maximal, \nwhen he discoveres the spoon missing.\n\n&quot;YOU STOLE IT!&quot; he yells at the Maximal.\n\nThe Maximal captain turns around, &quot;Stole what?&quot;\n\n&quot;The spoon I had in my hand!&quot; yells an enraged DeathScythe.\n\n&quot;You didn&#39;t,&quot; the captain says calmly.\n\nDeathScythe blinks. &quot;Didn&#39;t what?&quot;\n\n&quot;Have a spoon in your hand.&quot;\n\n&quot;I did?&quot;\n\n&quot;No.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh,&quot; DeathStorm says, blinking a few times to get his thoughts in order, but \nto no avail. DeathStorm finally cracks, losing his temper, he lets out an \ninsane yell. &quot;ENOUGH!!!&quot; DeathScythe yells, reaching for his gun.\n\nHe blinks as he looks down at what he though was the gun, suddenly realizing \nthat it was a bot&#39;s arm.\n\n&quot;Wha-who-who-wh-what is this?&quot; he asks, his eyes wide.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s an arm.&quot;\n\n&quot;I KNOW IT&#39;S AN ARM, YOU DIMWIT,&quot; DeathScythe yells on the top of his, &quot;BUT \nWHOSE SLAGGIN&#39; ARM IS THIS?!!!!&quot;\n\n&quot;Mine,&quot; the Maximal says calmly, turning around, &quot;Can I have it back?&quot;\n\nDeathScythe looks at the Maximal in disbelief. His eyes go to the Maximal&#39;s \nstump of an arm, where seconds before there appeared to be a fully functional \nlimb. Looking back up to the captain&#39;s face, DeathScythe notices that the \nknife in the Maximal&#39;s shoulder has turned into a small silver spoon.\n\n&quot;YOU SLAG! YOU TOOK IT!!!!!&quot; he screams, jumping at the Maximal and swinging \nthe arm. &quot;DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!&quot; he keeps yelling, whacking the Maximal with \nthe bot&#39;s own arm.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Replication complete.&quot;\n\nDeathScythe opens his eyes. He was on his back, laying on cold ground. Above \nhim was the night sky. DeathScythe turns his head, looking at a metal plate \nof the ship.\n\n&quot;AHHH!!&quot; he jumps up, ready for battle against the hellish spawn he saw in \nthe reflection. He blinks, realizing that the hellish spawn was himself.\n\nDeathScythe smiles, admiring his new beast mode in the mirror. Either the \nship was hit pretty bad, or this was one psycho planet. DeathScythe looked \nlike all the animals on earth put together. His hind legs were that of a \nwolf, only much larger, so they could work together with his front legs, \nlooking almost like a gurrila&#39;s hands, but ending in two mismatched hooves. \nHis tail was a snake&#39;s tail, ending with a scorpion stinger.\n\nDeathSythe back was covered by both fur, hide, and scales, different patches \nof covering for different spots. Out of the middle of his back stuck out two \nwings, in strange angles. From the angles of the wings, it was obvious that \nthey were useless in flight, just there for apearence. In between the wings, \na shark fin sticks out, leaning slightly to the left. His underbelly was \ncovered with scales, fur sticking through them. Out of his sides stuck \nvarious fish fins, creating something like side teeth for the assassin.\n\nHis snout was hideous. From the middle of what looked like a T-rex&#39;s face, a \nrhino horn stuck out. Where the snout would be there was a bump, a seemingly \nhuman nose emerging from it. Under that was another bump, the mouth gaping \nits horrid collection of teeth, taken from various species on the planet.\n\n&quot;DeathScythe, ASSASSINATE!!!!&quot;\n\nDeathScythe transforms into robot mode, looking again at the plate. He was \nalmost as hideous as he was in beast mode. His wolf hind-legs served as his \nfeet, an extra pair of arms coming out to serve as his robot arms, leaving \ntwo hooves sticking out behind his back. Out of his shoulder stuck several \nfish fins, the other one carrying the shark fin. His whole body was random \npatches of different skins, hides, fur, and scales. Out of his back stuck his \nbeast mode head, grinning its collection of teeth. His wings were folded over \nhis back, providing a cape to hide his second head, making it look like a \nhump on his back. His robot head remained unchanged, still the evil mercyless \nface of an assassin.\n\nDeathScythe smiles. He looked horrid. He looked like a freak. He could pass \nas something from the pit itself! He rather liked it.\n\nDeathScythe looks at the other bots near the ship, all of them dead. He grins \nevilly as he looks at the captain. &quot;Thought you could confuse me, eh?&quot;\n\nHe walks over to the captain, kicking him before turning to disapear into the \nwoods.\n\n"}}
