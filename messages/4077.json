You have six broken ribs and if not treated can puncture you spark in no time...killing you.&quot;\n\n* She then looked over his shoulder and saw his damaged wing, the hole in it now seen by her and then knowing why they had crashed. Iron Raptor reached back to take his wing in her hands but it was far enough back that she literally had to lean on him just to reach the wing, once in her grasp she then saw that it was snapped in the same joint as before but then snapped it back into place. Thinking about how he should get that joint reinforced so that this wouldn&#39;t happen again. As she leaned against him and looking at his wing she answered his question.*\n\n&quot; No, I&#39;m no better then you. Just as damaged and just as sore, seems to be the latest trend these days.&quot;\n\n* Once she then smoother out the joint she then leaned back and looked him straight in the optics, smiling when she suddenly thought that he really was handsome and was the right bot for her but how he could also be a real klutz sometimes. But then again, she was no queen of grace either.\nIron Raptor then wiped away a bit of mech fluid from her cheek, knowing that the battle was over but feeling the need that they all needed a CR chamber.\nShe took his hand in hers and faced the Ark, the obvious sing that they needed to get going.*\n\n&quot; The battle&#39;s over and the Alliance is gone, let&#39;s go and get repaired now, huh?&quot;\n\n* With that she then opened her com-link to all Maximals frequencies, it was time to pack it in if Liono hadn&#39;t already given the order.*\n\n&quot;Attention all Maximals, the battle is now over...head back to base and get yourselves repaired.&quot;\n\n* With that she then looked towards the base but then back at Prowl, giving a little tug on his hand for them to get a move on.*\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
