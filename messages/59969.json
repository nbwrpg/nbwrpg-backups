Her optics flashed and glowed brightly for a \nmoment and then returned to normal. &quot;Hmm, not bad at all.&quot;  She \nsmiled and remained sitting in a proper fashion.  What she wasn&#39;t \ngoing to do was give him the satisfaction of knowing the that the \ndrink overpowered some of her systems enough so that she couldn&#39;t \nstand up. As long as she remained sitting for a bit untill her \nsystems returned to normal, she could pull it off. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice was a little suprised.  He sniffed the mixing glass he had, \nand didn&#39;t find anything wrong.  So he tasted it and found the \nproblem.  \n&gt; &quot;Oh my, I thought I was forgetting something.&quot;\n&gt; He dove into a spare part compartment on his person and produced a \n20 oz bottle of glowing liquid.  \n&gt; &quot;Sol&#39;lodnium Vodka, I always forget I have this, every time.&quot;\n&gt; He dumped half of the high energy, high alcohol content drink into \nthe mixing glass, and served the improved booze to Wolfblade and \nhimself.  He drank his, and all he got was a nasty eye twitch.\n&gt; &quot;Give yours a try.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She smiled and lifted the glass. &quot;Hmm, strong enough to take the \nhull \n&gt; off a stasis pod huh? Doubtfull it will even raise the fur on my \n&gt; tail.&quot;  She downed the drink in one gulp. She looked at Malice with \na \n&gt; smirk, &quot;well, that was tastey and rather....Hurg!&quot;  She dropped the \n&gt; glass on the floor and it shattered on the floor. Her optics \nflashed \n&gt; and stayed on a very bright solid color.  She sat stright up and \n&gt; started shake in her chair. More like vibrate in the chair. She \n&gt; studdered out, &quot;W....w...wh...what.....i...in....in \n&gt; the....the...pit...pit?&quot;  She transformed into wolf mode and back \nto \n&gt; bot mode and didn&#39;t even disturb the chair she was sitting in.  The \n&gt; rush stoppped as abruptly as it started. Her optics went back to \n&gt; normal and she sat looking at Malice. Her tone of voice was calm \nand \n&gt; relaxed. &quot;Hmm, not bad. But kind of lacking in, oh I don&#39;t know, \n&gt; spunk. Got anything else up your sleeve?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am Des Wraith, the Archfiend of Flames.  I have slaughtered \nthousands of demons who opposed me and will keep doing so.
