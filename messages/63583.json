Hurt you, a=\r\nnd hurt me too.  It&#39;s not going to be easy, but it is necessary.  It&#39;s for =\r\nyour betterment.  I&#39;m sorry, but I cannot love both you and Wolfblade as I =\r\nhave tried.  It simply will not work.  It was wrong of me to force you into=\r\n this arrangement, and I&#39;m sorry for that.  I have thought long and hard ov=\r\ner this, and I have come to the conclusion I love Wolfblade more, enough to=\r\n spend the rest of my life with her.  I still love you, Blacknightmare, but=\r\n not romantically.  You helped save me from Unicron, for that I am eternall=\r\ny grateful.  Please, do not be angry or upset, don&#39;t leave in pain.  Stay w=\r\nith us, you&#39;re a close friend, it would kill me from the inside out if you =\r\nleft and got injured or killed.  You have the chance to move on now, to fin=\r\nd someone more worthy than me for your romantic desires.  I&#39;ve killed more =\r\nthan I care to remember, for many millions of years.  You don&#39;t want to be =\r\naround me all the time anyway.  You have a new life, go and live it, explor=\r\ne every possibility, I wish not to hinder you.
