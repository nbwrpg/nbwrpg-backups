It was just a way to get on the boys&#39; nerves.  Just \nbecause our master made us all doesn&#39;t mean we have to like them.  \nBoys are toys,&quot; the sweep commander said as she looked over her \nshoulder at the monitor.  A few more minutes, then she could make \nthe magic work on the sleeping monster.  Hellplague suddenly threw \nan arm around around Blacknightmare&#39;s shoulders.\n&gt; &quot;Sisters need to stay together.  Come on, we can start on his \nbrainwashing, then when we&#39;re done we can transfer it into him.&quot;\n&gt; Hellplague walked to the console and began typing.\n&gt; &quot;Obey Unicron, Hellplague, and Blacknightmare above all else.  \nDestroy all who oppose Unicron.  Obey your masters without \nquestion.  Anything else before I put it with the rest of the \nbrainwash program?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNightmare:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Are you shure that you like share this pet with me, \n&gt; Hellplague????&quot;said the femme&quot;I thought that you hated me&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;If I can&#39;t scan him externally, then I&#39;ll access his data \n&gt; network.  That way I can actvate him and brainwash him while he is \n&gt; offline.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The probe was replaced with a multi interface data link.  It \nmoved \n&gt; down into the gel and opened his chest panel.  The t- rex head on \n&gt; his chest lifted and opened, revealing the curcuitry inside.  The \n&gt; interface connected and Hellplague went to the computer again.  \nShe \n&gt; began accessing his core memory, as well as his software.  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;OOOOh, someone has put heavy restrictions on him.  He is \nactually \n&gt; more powerful than what we saw!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She set the computer to work, trying to unlock the restrictions \non \n&gt; his power absorbtion, his EPS grid, and his anti grav core.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It will take a few minutes, but once the computer is done, we \ncan \n&gt; begin the brainwashing proceedure.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; he swep commander walked over to the table and stuck one hand \ninto \n&gt; the gel.  She carressed the seemingly soft face of the bounty \n&gt; hunter, and grinned more.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I always wanted an obediant pet.  If you want, we may share \nhim, \n&gt; just us two?&quot; Hellplague said with her grin plastered on her face.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Friends.
