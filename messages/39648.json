The first being you posted for a \n&gt; factions defenses and such when that is not allowed. You can make \n&gt; things from a base pop up and fire at your char. Next the Alliance \n&gt; base or the Infecticon base would have detected Mustex long before he \n&gt; got on the island. Having your one bot single hadndidly dismantel the \n&gt; Alliance base is heavy godmoding and such. Ugh I wish the council was \n&gt; here right now but most of it is gone... Perhaps we should all make a \n&gt; temporary council until everyone gets back? Rauq gets back this \n&gt; sunbday but alot can happen in one day, such as Kyles post.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Eh?

I got my ass handed to me for months because people \n&gt; &gt; disrespected me after I did something similar. Your post was very \n&gt; &gt; well written, but not fair to the other RPGers...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; � ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; � From: Takashi Owa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; � To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt; &gt; &gt; � Sent: Friday, July 13, 2001 10:01 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; � Subject: Re: Iron Fist\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; � (Ok, I&#39;m no Council member, but Kyle Stewart, that is a mass, \n&gt; &gt; mass \n&gt; &gt; &gt; � moding e-mail. �Where the hell&#39;s the Council? �Shouldn&#39;t you \n&gt; guys \n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; � watching for this stuff, eh?)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; � �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; � Your use of Yahoo!
