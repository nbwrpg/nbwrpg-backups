His former friends, campanions, allys.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::K-9::\n&gt;\n&gt; He didn&#39;t wait for permission. He walked around the CF, and found the\n&gt; room where Prowl and Iron Rapter were in.\n&gt; &quot;Hello, where could I find the commander?&quot; He asks.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt;\n&gt; DrillBit glanced back at Phobia.\n&gt; &quot;Hey, welcome back.&quot; He says. He turned his head back to the new\n&gt; arrival.\n&gt; &quot;So, whats your name?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: like Zardus, I&#39;m not one for speeches. Also, I have only been here\n&gt; for two months, so I havn&#39;t seen all the changes of the RPG. But I am\n&gt; going to try and say something, so here goes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most RPGs do not make it over 20 members, and only last a few months.\n&gt; Here we are, one year, and nearly 50 members. Over the summer, we\n&gt; averaged a post every 30 seconds. What does this all mean? It means that\n&gt; Neo Beast Wars RPG is the greatist Transformers RPG, if not the greatist\n&gt; RPG there is. Lets all work to make it even better.\n&gt; HAPPY BIRTHDAY NBWRPG!!!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
