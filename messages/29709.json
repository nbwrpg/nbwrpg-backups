Did he think it was smart to test their defences (weapons)?!\nShe nearly shreiks as she hears the click of the launchers trigger, feeling \nBiomass stumble back a few steps and nearly stepping on her in the process.\nBiomass recovers his own balence and looks down at his chest-plate, a large, \ngaping  uneven hol where the missiles had impacted with him. Mech-fluid \noozzing from the top of the hole and pouring down his stomach.\nIt was fairly impressive damage, but when he turned his head towards \nPerndabot there was only a smile there, laugher ripping from his throat.*\n\n&quot; You&#39;re more feminin then they are!&quot; he gestures to Nue&#39;e who was visably \nshaking and to Swift.\nBiomass takes another step back and moves his cape to slide ofer her \nshoulder and cover half his chest and the damage.*\n\n&quot; To hide behind your weapon like the pansy that you are!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
