From what I&#39;ve seen, your attitude serves no purpose but \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; piss bots off. That&#39;s dangerous. You dont need enemies within \n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; own faction.

Artificial programs are crap. We are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformers, we are more advanced then that. Instead of being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; programmed like simple computers, we should learn are skills \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves. He walks out of the room, opening his comm.
