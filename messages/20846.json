Do you want him to drop me?!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor sighed as she looked back over her shoulder.*\n\n&quot; It&#39;s beginning to look like a fairly attractive action right about \nnow....&quot;\n\n* And with that she simply turned back around, taking what comfort she could \nat the feeling of Prowl relaxing on her back as he was.\n\nThe area around them seemed to open up into a wide plain, seeing small herds \nof grass grazing animals off in the distance, slightly wondering if this was \nthe right place in which Iris wanted to stop.\nAnd her question was comfirmed.*\n\nIRIS:&quot; Stop! We&#39;re here. You ready, Birdman?&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor came to a stop and rolled her shoulder in its socket, grinding \nher teeth at the aching pain she felt in the joint.\nShe shook herself hard, even though Prowl was still on her back holding \nIris.\nShe just didn&#39;t like the feeling of someone on her back.\nHow horses stood it during the time of humans was completely beyond her.*\n\n&quot; Is it a good idea to do this with both of us injured? Couldn&#39;t it cause \nproblems?&quot;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
