We \nfound a\n&gt; female bot laying near the shuttle. She says she lost her beast \nmode. I\n&gt; don&#39;t know how but it appears her skin came off. I&#39;m quite \nconfused. She&#39;s\n&gt; in the shuttle with us right now. Can you bring us back in? I think \nyou\n&gt; check this out.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; (Armada awaits an answer from Reptilica.)\n\n\n"}}
