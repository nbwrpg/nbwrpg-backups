He was \nletting a Predacon out of the ship, after she had plenty of time to scan, and \nplant bugs in the bridge and in her quarters. As he follows her, he taps his \nwrist, as screen poping up as his wrist computer activates. Tapping a few \nbuttons, he activates a complete scan of the ship, to check for any foreign \nobjects.\n\nRex walks faster, coming up to Battera. &quot;Is there any reason for this walk or \ndo you just like to move about?&quot; he asks her, trying to sound friendly.\n\n"}}
