It \ncaught him off-guard with a small jolt. He was skittish with his odd \ndamage that didn&#39;t repair right, not wanting anyone near him, because \nif they knew what was going on, they would have him killed. Damaged, \nincapable bots were to be killed. It was a Predacon tradition.\n\n&quot;Huh? What?&quot; He looked around, with his vision a little better. He \nsat up, on his side. \n\n\n\n\n\nQuasar looked out towards the horizon, her optics following tracks \nmade by Tankor. Quite a few bots went with him. She turned and went \nback inside the ice cave, claimed by her Predacon group. She made \nsure the door behind her was closed tightly. \n\n&quot;Where did tank boy and the others go?&quot; Not many were left. \n\n\n"}}
