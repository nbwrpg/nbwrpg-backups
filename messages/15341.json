She flew down to him and hovered on the\n&gt; breese. &quot;What is going on?  are you going on a mission of some sort?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         Dollen grumbled.  He looked at Reptilica, and then at\n&gt; Starscream, and then at Phobia.  When he looked at Phobia he\n&gt; sneered.  Then he looked up at GoldenEye, flying off.  He was going\n&gt; insane!!!  He couldn&#39;t take it anymore!!  Suddenly, his mind was\n&gt; blinded, by images of the beautiful bot he thought he was over.  He\n&gt; held his head in his hands, and fell down on his knees.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      &quot;Uggghh, who are you!!!!!!  What do you want!!!!!!  I don&#39;t\n&gt; like you, stop this!!&quot; He mumbled.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       He kept repeating to himself, &quot;I don&#39;t like you, I don&#39;t like\n&gt; you, I don&#39;t like you......&quot; He kept saying to himself, his voice\n&gt; drifting off into the air.  Then he suddenly saw, in his mind, all of\n&gt; the Predacons.  He was looking up at them.  They were laughing at\n&gt; him, laughing hysterically.  Then he saw GoldenEye, making out with\n&gt; another bot.  Suddenly, all the bots there started saying, &quot;Reject!!\n&gt; A Reject!  A Reject!!  Nothing but a reject!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      &quot;Nooooo, noooo!!!!!  Go away!!!!  It&#39;s not true!!\n&gt; NOOOOO!!!!,&quot; Then, his mind snapped back to where he was, what was\n&gt; going on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      &quot;I can&#39;t take this anymore!!!!!  I&#39;m sorry, fellow team mates,\n&gt; I have to get away.  I can&#39;t do this anymore!!  I need some time to\n&gt; cool off, when you see GoldenEye again, tell her I am gone, but I\n&gt; still want to be there for her,&quot; And with that, he turned, and walked\n&gt; away, into the shadows, and he couldn&#39;t be seen anymore.\n&gt; Unfortunately for him, he still had Phobia&#39;s baby implanted on him.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
