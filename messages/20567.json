Excellent ideas... The shields don&#39;t go down to the sea \nbottom, no. They stop at sea level.&quot;\n\nHe looks over at the CR tank as it raises FZ (future Zardus)&#39;s body, \nnow fully repaired. He hooks up some wires, tapping a few keys on a \nconsole to start up a program.\n\n&quot;The Iron Fist has materials and torpedos in store, as does the \nAlliance base, and I&#39;m sure we can find mines as well.&quot;\n\nHe frowns, tapping a few more keys to bypass the security systems on \nhis future self&#39;s internal system&#39;s. FZ&#39;s systems were almost \nidentical to Zardus&#39; own, so Zardus had very little trouble getting \naround them.\n\n&quot;We can use the Alliance base&#39;s shields to project underwater,&quot; he \ncontinues his reply to Nemesis, &quot;But in order to do that, we should \nhave the Alliance base as close to the surrounding waters as \npossible. Perhaps underground?&quot; \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer/Scattershot:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer was deep in thought as he rode a thermal, his eyes \nbarely \n&gt; able to take the light.  His animal form was nocturnal, and didn&#39;t \nlike \n&gt; bright lights!  And that damn star (the Sun) was blazing right into \nhis \n&gt; sensetive optic sensors.  When he got back to base, he&#39;d have to do \nsomething \n&gt; about them.\n&gt; \n&gt; He thought a little longer, two thirds of the way to the Iron Fist \nand \n&gt; relocated Alliance Base.  He looked to his right at Scattershot, \nwho was \n&gt; chasing a fish near the surface of the water.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis sighed at the bald eagle, opening a comlink to Zardus.\n&gt; &quot;Zardus, it&#39;s Nemesis Enforcer.  I&#39;ve been thinking about things, \nand I think \n&gt; we need to make a few modifications to the defenses of the island.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;First, I was wondering if the shields which cover the island go \nall the way \n&gt; down to the bottom of the sea bed?  If not, people could swim under \nthe \n&gt; shields and gain access, possible.  Now, to combat that \npossibility, I was \n&gt; thinking making it possible for the shields touch down to the sea \nbed.  Also, \n&gt; we could have underwater mines and torpedo tubes underwater.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis awaited for a response, raising in altitude twenty feet, \nnot wanting \n&gt; Scattershot to hear him.\n\n\n"}}
