Not liking to \nlet them go, he notes that the Autobots will have to be prepared for \nthem next time. He ponders his decision for a minute then come \nback to the present. &quot;CLIFFJUMPER!&quot; He yells, heading over. \nStrafe and the other technobots are close behind.\n\nSwoop circles over head, a worried look on his robotic dinosaur \nface. &quot;Me Swoop worried about Cliffjumper.&quot; (lol)\n\nCrossroads drags himself off the wall, a little dazed, and tries to \nfocus on his surroundings.\n\n&gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  \n\nAstroblast frowns as he awaits further updates from Abominus and \nStratus... well, scratch Abominus.

What is your progress.&quot;\n\nAbominus, deep underwater, just understands Stratus&#39; commands. \n&quot;Abominus.... fo.... foll.... crussshhhh....&quot; He swims towards \nStratus, heading in the intended direction.\n\n&gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  \n\nSwitchblade ignores Ragnus for a while, then he shakes slightly as \nas several missiles smash into the top of the ship, charring the \nmedium armour plating. &quot;Wha?&quot; He exclaims, &quot;An attack?&quot; He \ngrumbles to himeself for a second, the turns to the other bot, &quot;Bah, \ngo out there are play with--&quot; He checks the scanners, and they \npick up a jet, &quot;The jet outside. We need to get the ship down to \nJamaica, and they aren&#39;t helping. I&#39;ll keep them busy with the \nlimited weapons we have on the top of the ship while you get out \nthere.&quot; As he finishes, a missiles pod, and two autoguns fold out of \nthe side of the ship. The autoguns send a barrage of thiry bullets, \nand the missiles pod launches two missile, both at the incomming \njet.\n\n&gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  &gt;|&lt;  \n\nLynxiz checks out the deadend battle field in front of the chivitron \nbase. She opens a commlink to Windlord, &quot;Windlord. This is \nLynxiz. I&#39;m going to return to the Maximals. I&#39;ll probably return to \nvisit soon.&quot; She waits for a reply.\n\nLokk and Axis shrug as they regard Seekker. Axis chuckles to \nhimself, and enters the Chvitron base to replenish his energy and \nmissiles. Lokk follows him, looking for bullets.\n\n"}}
