It is a metallic silver/white \n&gt; &gt; &gt; colo=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt;      But enough of the space shuttle, inside the unique s=\r\npaceship \n&gt; &gt; &gt; were two individuals.  They were both silver metallic.  Ove=\r\nr \n&gt; their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; metallic though was more metallic but this is where the t=\r\nwo \n&gt; &gt; &gt; individuals looked different.  One was a shinny red metallic and =\r\n\n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other was a shinny blue metallic.  So for now they shall be k=\r\nnown \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Red and Blue.  Red was studying a map of the world known =\r\nas \n&gt; Earth.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blue was sitting in the pilot&#39;s chair but instead of c=\r\narefully \n&gt; &gt; &gt; planning the course he had his legs up on the controls and =\r\nwas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; twiddinling his thumbs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;      &quot;Hey Brother,&quot; Red sai=\r\nd as he turned and faced his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; comrade, &quot;What the Grease Bolting are y=\r\nou doing!  Why aren&#39;t you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; planning our landing!  I don&#39;t want to cra=\r\nsh.  Plan ahead.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;Plan Ahead?  Yeah right!&quot;  Blue said =\r\nas he let out a small \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chuckle, &quot;You are suppose to move with the flo=\r\nw.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;We need a landing vector!&quot;  Red yells.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n       &quot;YOU NEED a tic-tack!&quot;  Blue yells back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Poor Poo=\r\nr Blue, if only he listen to his brother.  But he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; decided to not lis=\r\nten to his brother and decided to go with the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; flow.  Well now they a=\r\nre flowing on the mountains of the Northern \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Continent where they cra=\r\nshed.  Their exact location of the crash \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (using the map on the=\r\n events page) as far east of the Predacon \n&gt; base \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as possible and ab=\r\nout an inch up.
