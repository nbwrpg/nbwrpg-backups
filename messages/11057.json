The Militron ship and it&#39;s drones had been busy since thier \nlanding some time back. The massive Iron Fist rode at anchor in the \nmiddle of the lagoon, surroundd by a series of nets desgined to keep \nunwanted divers away from the more vunerable engines, the only \nfunctioning engines on the planet. Panzertron knew those engines were \nvluable, but due to the lack of replacment parts the engines were \nonly being used to power the newly completed base. They had spare \nparts but some couldn&#39;t be replicated in the field.\n\n  From the Ironfist a bridge ran to the shore, the bridge allowed \neasy access between ship and shore, as well as the power conduits. \nThe conduits, in thier armored tubing lead into a tunnel that lead \ninto the moutain. The entire island was dotted with weapon \nimplacments, jamming and scanning towers, as well as search lights.\nTo accomadate a bigger area, much of what was built here was taken \nfrom the IF&#39;s own stores, thou when hollowing out the island&#39;s \nmoutain it turned out to be rich in minerals, so a processing plant \nwas built using the spare reactor housing from the battlecruiser.\n\n  The drones of the ship had proven of little value beging of limited \nrange until a shore computer was brought online that extended the \nrange the droids could operate. New droids had to be built that could \nhandle the different conditions of the base and that took time as \nwell, trying to use exsisiting parts to build a new desgined droid.\n\n  Major Panzertron smiled, &quot;Project Atlantis is complete.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
