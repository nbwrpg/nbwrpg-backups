If he could find the Ark here maybe \nhe could convince Optimus Prime of his innocence and be granted \namnasty for his crimes.\n\nSunhawk:  By the way like I said before the Preds framed me for \nmurder and treason I was a lutenient.  Do you plan to give me that \nrank back or am I just a private again.  Of course I&#39;m sure they \nalerted every outpost this side of the Sharkticons planet of who I \nwas and what I&#39;d supposedly done as soon as I escaped from prison.\n\nHe tried to bring the backup systems on line.\n\nSunhawk: You do realize most of this stuff was obsolete 6 months ago \ndon&#39;t you?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Condor: Condor appeared in brigde and said to Maximal \nleader &quot;Condor reports, sir...

Looking over Condor and Siref. &quot;Stand easy \nSiref, well as you can see we&#39;ve crashed. I&#39;ve got some bots...&quot; \nLooking pointedly at Sunhawk, indicating he should get to work on \nhelping Hot Rod, &quot;... working on repairs, others are going to go \nthrough the ship and see who&#39;s still functioning.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     As Sunhawk got to work after discharging himself of weapons he \nanswered, &quot;That&#39;s why I want sensors up, Maximal command seemed to \nthink a group of Predicons were headed back to ancient Earth, I \nsuspect that&#39;s where we&#39;ve crashed but I can&#39;t be sure, never been to \nthe place myself. Once we have external sensors working again we can \nfind out if this is the right planet and if so where we&#39;ve been \nforced to land.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Moving to a locker in the floor by one of the chairs he \nextracts a small repair kit and opens the computers panel shifting \nunder the console to get at the wiring. &quot;Siref and Condor you two \nshould check out the thruster section of the ship, see if anything \ncan be salvaged, if anyone needs assistance to the CR chambers on \ndeck two get them there first, by all reports the thrusters are just \nso much slag...&quot; Turning back to his work Talos begins rejoining the \nconnections under the computer panel using a small hand torch to fuse \nthe bypassed lines together to make the connection stable before \ntrying the computer once more.\n\n\n"}}
