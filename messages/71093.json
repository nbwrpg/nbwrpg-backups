Tucson is able to fire and hit targets in=\r\n pure darkness, seeing that he is blind and has adapted to his disability, =\r\nsimply by sharpening up his other senses.  Hearing, touch smell, and if nee=\r\nd be, taste.  It&#39;s up to you wether or not that arrow hits Nightrazor in th=\r\ne knee or not.   The reason for this shot, is to disable but not destroy.  =\r\nHe wants him for questioning, and feels he can get a lot of intel out of hi=\r\nm.  Then it will be up to everyone to decide which fate is best for Nightra=\r\nzor. Rodimus will also have a say in what happens, as well as Lord Elder an=\r\nd everyone else.  Tucson would like nothing more than to take out Nightrazo=\r\nr, but being an Autobot, he feels that is not the answer to everyone&#39;s prob=\r\nlems.  Nor does he have it in his spark to do such a thing.  If a decision =\r\nis to be made, he feels that he must do so in an intelligent and fair manne=\r\nr and to do this, means he has to consult others for advice.

He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; uses sharp hearing to pick up the smallest of sounds, even those dee=\r\nmed\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be completely silent. He pays close attention to how the=\r\n ground seems\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vibrate under his feet, giving him indication =\r\nthat although hidden, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell where his opponent was.=\r\n He slowly brings Straight Shot around.\n&gt; &gt; With\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of his arms in=\r\njured, he had to do things in reverse. With the good\n&gt; &gt; arm,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; hold the weight of his weapon, and with the bad arm, pull the trigger.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had often practiced alternating between his hands, and was gl=\r\nad he had\n&gt; &gt; done\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so. Being ambidextrous was an attribute.=\r\n He loads an arrow specifically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; designed to be barbed and most diff=\r\nicult to remove. He knew that it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better just to disable his ene=\r\nmy rather than destroy him. He needed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nightrazor for questioning. M=\r\nost effective area of targeting, would be\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knee joint Imbed =\r\nthe arrow in a joint and his opponent would find it\n&gt; &gt; most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diffic=\r\nult to abmulate, yet it would not kill or destroy him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now =\r\nwithin striking distance, as determined by his sonar sensors, he\n&gt; &gt; sends\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out short pulse emissions to pinpoint his area of targeting. His\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; reading is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quick, yet, anything could happen at this poin=\r\nt. He aims, and attempts\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; launch an arrow deep into his enemy=\r\n&#39;s knee, if his calculations were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Steady =\r\nStraight Shot.

He had dealt with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nintruders of the dark many times, and being visually impaired, he\n&gt; &gt; knew\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to unlock their secrets of steath.

I\n&gt; &gt; sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n enemy is much like myself, and instead of putting Uproar and Leo ll\n&gt; &gt; in=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; danger, I will take on the intruder personally. =\r\nHe has crossed the\n&gt; &gt; line\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my envronment, and it&#39;s ti=\r\nme he pays the price by someone who is as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; versed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in steal=\r\nth as he is.
