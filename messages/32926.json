he muttered, ignoring the fact that =\r\nmost of \n  the attackers on the &lt;BR&gt;CF were slowly beginning to retreat, hi=\r\nmself \n  included.&nbsp; He fired off ten &lt;BR&gt;rapid optic blasts at Hot Rod=\r\n&#39;s left knee \n  joint.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Firestarter let out a yell and lau=\r\nnched two flares \n  which exploded and blocked &lt;BR&gt;all weapons fire heading=\r\n for him.&nbsp; He \n  armed two missiles, launching them at &lt;BR&gt;Iron Raptor=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Burn in hell, \n  Maximal scum.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Scattershot fle=\r\nw higher and higher, holding a \n  large bomb.&nbsp; He planned on &lt;BR&gt;&quot;acci=\r\ndentally&quot; dropping it on the \n  Maximals.&nbsp; He burst into evil laughter=\r\n at &lt;BR&gt;the thought, dropping it \n  down towards an NDE member and a fighti=\r\nng Alliance &lt;BR&gt;member.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Works \n  either wa--OH MY GENTILE JESUS!&quot; h=\r\ne screamed, his optics enhancing and &lt;BR&gt;he \n  now learned he had dropped t=\r\nhe bomb down towards Nemesis Enforcer and \n  &lt;BR&gt;Serpentor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Good jo=\r\nb, Zardus!&quot; he yelled, looking around \n  nervously.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Doubl=\r\ne Punch was struck with all three charges, \n  his exo-skeleton almost &lt;BR&gt;g=\r\niving away.&nbsp; Crashing to the ground he let \n  out a small whine.&nbsp;=\r\n Getting up &lt;BR&gt;slowly, his modifications were \n  complete.&nbsp; He painfu=\r\nlly raised his tail, &lt;BR&gt;seeing the outline of \n  Scyther.&nbsp; He fired a=\r\n smal spray of acid at the \n  outline.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Injector took an a=\r\nim with both launchers at the \n  unsuspecting Dark One and &lt;BR&gt;downed Break=\r\ndown, but a dozen shots struck him \n  and knocked him back.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Pieces =\r\nof slag!&quot; he yelled at the site of his \n  cracked exo-skeleton.&nbsp; He &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;raised his left arm, firing off two stinger \n  missiles SharpClaws and tw=\r\no from &lt;BR&gt;the other at \n  Underground.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manterror hit the=\r\n ground after shots impacted \n  with him.&nbsp; He let out a yell of &lt;BR&gt;ra=\r\nge as he jumped to his \n  feet.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vehement looked to one mi=\r\nssile, firing off two optic \n  blasts at it, and turned &lt;BR&gt;to the other, f=\r\niring off two rapid optic blasts \n  at it, seeing from the corner &lt;BR&gt;of hi=\r\ns optics their explosions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He \n  raised his left arm, firing two mis=\r\nsiles at Hot Rod, and from the other \n  &lt;BR&gt;firing two missiles at the Cybe=\r\nrtronian Fire.&nbsp; Twenty five shots \n  struck &lt;BR&gt;Vehement dead on and s=\r\nent him flying out of control \n  downward.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reflector rais=\r\ned both arms, firing two missiles \n  each that prematurely &lt;BR&gt;exploded and=\r\n took out all shots heading for \n  him.&nbsp; He couldn&#39;t see through the &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;flames of his resulting defense, \n  and so waited until he could see a t=\r\narget to \n  &lt;BR&gt;attack.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Serpentor had gotten the upperhan=\r\nd and continued \n  to pummel Nemesis&#39; face &lt;BR&gt;until he heard a faint whist=\r\nling sound.&nbsp; \n  Looking up he saw an object about &lt;BR&gt;the size of thre=\r\ne charges.&nbsp; \n  &quot;Right...&quot; he said, jumping back and transforming &lt;BR&gt;t=\r\no his snake mode and \n  slithering away, noticing the slow retreat.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n---&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bomb struck \n  a few feet away from Nemesis Enforcer, sendin=\r\ng him flying &lt;BR&gt;through the air \n  without the use of his engines or wings=\r\n, his body burned and &lt;BR&gt;scarred, the \n  robot himself screaming.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\n/TT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;TT&gt;Your \n  use of Yahoo!
