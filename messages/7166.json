It was composed of Gremlin, Jackle, and Transanulas. Not very \npowerful...but hopefully Megatron would do what he said he would. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Alright, so far Inferno and his team have done a farely \nwell job of rouseing the Maximals. All we have to do is finish them.\n\n::: Hell Beast charged forward, flanked by the spider, jackle, and \ndinosaur. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron slams his fist down. Ra and Waspinator looked at him with great \nperplexedy. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Wheres Scorpinox, Darkmouse, Quickstrike, Kitkat, and the \nother one?!!\n\n::: Ra and Waspinator shrugged. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Damn it! Both of you stay here, I have to help Hell Beast \nwith someting rather important.\n\n::: Ra ::: Shall I contact the Newcomers?\n\n::: Megatron ::: Have the wasp do it. Set can hel out Hell Beast.\n\n::: He departs in flight mode. and Waspinator contacts Set. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~`\n\n::: Set awoke from a slumber he couldnt account for. He didnt know how long \nhe had been out, or why. He got up and saw a flashing light on his consol. \nAnswering it he saw the face of Waspinator. :::\n\n::: Set, still groggy. ::: What do you want?\n\n::: Waspinator ::: Megatron wants kittybot to help Hell Beast.\n\n::: Set ::: I am in no state to assist in any battle. But, Ill see what I can \ndo.\n\n::: He turns off the messager and enters the corridor. Over the main \nannouncement system he calls for Shuko. :::\n\n"}}
