All it took was a well placed shot and he \nwould soon have an open chest cavity, his internals would then be \nvulnerable.\nDinobot glared at Sineses, no bot would get past him as long as he was \nalive!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
