She blinked and rubbed her optics. Her optics were \ncoming into focus when the little girl said she was a maximal. She \njumped out of the Cr chamber,  jumping over Cam&#39;s head and lands on \nall four paws, looking at the child. &quot;Your a maximal?&quot; She looked \naround and her optics landed on Blackfang. She stared at him for a \nmoment. &quot;If your a maximal, then why are my commands, still intact? \nTERRORIZE!&quot;  And transforms into bot mode. Her black matte body, \nsleek and slender. Her wolf tail flowing behind her. Her red optics \nbright and vibrant. Her stood there,looking at Blackfang, then to \nCam, and back to Blackfang. &quot;Why am I here?&quot; Her face showing no \nfear, but puzzlement. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you kill me? Or let me die?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
