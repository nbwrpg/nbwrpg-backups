He shifted himself around to look\n&gt; down, and he could see what was happening. &quot;Frag!&quot; he said as he saw\n&gt; the tell tale signs of blindness coming from Tuscon, especially\n&gt; blindness without his head mounted sonar devices.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kicking off from the side, Rodimus used his grappling line as a\n&gt; repelling rope and slid all the way back down and retracted the line,\n&gt; as he pulled his weapon out with one smooth move, &quot;Perceptor, stand\n&gt; down we don&#39;t have any time for this!&quot; he said, his voice all\n&gt; business.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The distinctive wine of a weapon powered to full strength could be\n&gt; clearly heard from Rodimus as he glanced at Darkhwak and Tuscon while\n&gt; keeping his weapon firmly trained on Perceptor, &quot;There&#39;s GOT to be\n&gt; another way out of here!&quot; Rodimus said in frustration. &quot;If only we had\n&gt; that Sonar.&quot; Rodimus said under his breath as he thought furiously.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Leagcy!&quot; Rodimus said over the radio, &quot;After the last battle of the\n&gt; Minion invasion I believe that Scorponok and others, inclusing a few\n&gt; Autobots were able to escape through a tunnel that Scorponok dug. Did\n&gt; that reach all the way here?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No.&quot; Legacy&#39;s cold voice intoned. &quot;According to the record of the\n&gt; same ordeal that Kup gave us, they came up several hundred meters in\n&gt; front of the pool of lava.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy paused as his own formidable scanners went to work, analyzing\n&gt; the underground network of tunnels. &quot;However there is a tunnel 11.57\n&gt; meters beyond that wall.&quot; A beam of light shot out from Legacy and hit\n&gt; the wall, displaying the location. &quot;For the moment it appears to be\n&gt; unused, and the tempature is currently just within tolerable range for\n&gt; a Cybertronian to use for a limited duration. However I would not\n&gt; recommend the use of explosive ordinance to excavate the tunnel since\n&gt; the room itself is generally unstable and too large of a disturbance\n&gt; could open open up fissures that could quickly flood the room with\n&gt; molten rock.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus nodded, &quot;That&#39;s just what I wanted to hear.&quot; he said as a\n&gt; smile appeared on his face, as his amber colored optics fixed on\n&gt; Perceptor. &quot;I have no interest in using explosives on the wall, not\n&gt; when we have someone here who can perform that task so much more\n&gt; efficiently!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Then I would suggest that you expidite matters, it will only be a\n&gt; short while until Hydras and his subjects find another way to attack\n&gt; us.&quot; Legacy turned his sensors to attempting to track the Decepticons\n&gt; and Predacons.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Summary: Rodimus jumps back down, and learns from Legacy that there\n&gt; is another possible way out, but they will need Perceptor&#39;s talent for\n&gt; digging to utilize it. Legacy scans for any approaching enemy units.)\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
