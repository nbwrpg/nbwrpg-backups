The \nbattle in which HotRod is in, it is too far away. Besides, how would \nSkulletron know about HotRod being hurt if they are still inside the \nship?  But HotRod could be brought into the ship in damaged condition \nafter the fight.  SO Feline would still be able to reek havoc after \nhe is brought back to the ship.)\n\n::Feline::\n\nShe smiled at the thought of destroying the maximals from within.  \nThey would never expect a friend to turn on them like that.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Skulletron/Necromancer::\n&gt; \n&gt;       Skulletron looked at Feline.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Hey, beautiful, we&#39;ll go get that fool Hot Rod.  Be careful, \nI think we might see some fireworks if we don&#39;t stay hidden,&quot; He said.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;         Necromancer saw Breakdown coming at him.  He ran towards \nthe Oblitercon, and then did a somersault over him.  He ran up to a \ntree, and then did a flying kick right through the tree.  Necromancer \nquickly picked up the tree, struggling not to drop it.  He used all \nhis might to lift it up, and TRY to drop it on top of Breakdown\n\n\n"}}
