It was opening under its own power, but he was far too\nimpatient for that.  The door, now detached from its hinges, was\nthrown six meters from the chamber against the wall impacting the wall\nbefore falling to rest on the floor and causing enough noise that it\ncould be heard throughout the base.\n\nHe stepped out of the chamber, for a moment forgetting his\nsurroundings.  He was overcome with a surge of energon for a brief\nmoment, then returned to a normal defensive posture, realizing he was\nnot in a jail cell.\n\nOn 1/13/08, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Lord Jhiaxus::\n&gt;\n&gt;   Jhiaxus: You mean this isn&#39;t the right cell?
