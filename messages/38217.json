Since DrillBit is in battle, I leave him \nto\n&gt; Yan. Also Hot Rod and Epyon, but Yan, keep Hot Rod training. if it \nends,\n&gt; have him train for the IGL. Same with Epyon when he is done watching\n&gt; Eyebright. Since KitKat2 is sleeping we will just leave her alone.\n&gt; Thanks! I will still be posting for most of the day though.\n\n\n"}}
