No one joined this RPG to read tons of insults\nand\n&gt; complaints coming back and forth. Thecode, KSLawdogg has a point. Your\nemails\n&gt; have had moding in them recently, and saying that you will ignore damage\nis\n&gt; also moding.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please email me with further complaints.\n&gt;\n&gt; To everyone else: Wrestling chars are not against the rules of everything.\n&gt; Wrestling is just a form of combat. Once again, ignoring damage would be\n&gt; moding. If Thecode wants to have wrestling chars, he can, just as long as\nhe\n&gt; fixes his moding.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Find long lost high school friends:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4056/10/_/_/_/959388769/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
