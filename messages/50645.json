To him, it was\n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasting words that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could be best kept. It was alien to him to be\n&gt; called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so familiarly. He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; did not feel comfortable with it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He turned back to the others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vlad: WHAT SAY YOU WARRIORS? SHOULD YOU GO ON\n&gt; AND\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CLUB YOURSELVES \n&gt; &gt; &gt; POINTLESSLY OR FIND OUT WHY YOU FIGHT?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ????::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s a good idea Vlady...&quot;said the femme\n&gt; &quot;Can I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tell you Vlady?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As nearly as he could tell, Vlad saw no one\n&gt; move\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after the initial \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exchange. He thought of his options. He\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; start firing, but he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not decided which group was the best to go\n&gt; with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Those Rogues were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; greater in number, but that did not prove\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything. Ice Hellion \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Warriors were many, and their prowess in\n&gt; combat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; did not reflect \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Tripredacus, on the other hand, seemed\n&gt; less\n&gt; &gt; &gt; organized, even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they seemed better armed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His declaration of being the object of the\n&gt; trial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of possession \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motivate them, but he harbored no illusions.\n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was a human, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unknown \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to these machines. He had not proven\n&gt; himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but was confident he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be of some use.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then, there was this female robot. He did\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know who she was or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which team she was in, but it seemed as\n&gt; though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she had a clear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mission, maybe even unknown to her. There\n&gt; had to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be a way he could \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bring her with him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In all these options, running was not\n&gt; present.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It was the cowards \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out, and Wolf Warriors were not cowards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or... yes...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He fired his two missile racks in the air\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forty tiny \n&gt; &gt; &gt; explosions \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peppered the sky. He intended to make a\n&gt; show.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vlad: I AM KHAN VLADIMIR WARD OF CLAN WOLF.\n&gt; I DO\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NOT KNOW WHO YOU \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ARE, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BUT I RECOGNIZE YOUR VALUE AS WARRIORS.
