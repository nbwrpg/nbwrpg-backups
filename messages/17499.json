He&#39;d played his pieces\nand sacrificed a few pawns, but his play was paying off. Now his Queen was\nin play, soon all his pieces would be in play and the opposing King would\ndie.\n\nKit Kat asked about scanners.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think scanners would work. If you didn&#39;t want to be found would you\nstay where scanners could locate you?&quot; he turned to Drillbit and Destructor.\n&quot;Megatron is a cunning resourcefull Predacon, odds are that he&#39;s found more\nfollowers.\n If we defeat him in front of his followers they&#39;ll lose faith in thier\nleader.&quot;\n\nHe listens in on the conversation between KitKat and DrillBit.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re not acting like Maximals, we&#39;re ddoing the Predacon thing and saving\nour own tail plates.&quot; the closer they got to the old cave the more he\nwondered about what Megatron was thinking. probably something like he should\ncover his back and make certain that the only ones who know he betrayed his\nfaction should be eliminated before words of his treachery get to the\nPredacons under his command. he wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the sky opened up\nand swallowed them under his command.\n\nSubject: Re: Standing Down\n\n\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt;\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t help but smile at Phobia. &quot;No.  I have no problem\n&gt; turning him into scrap. He left us to die. Now it&#39;s time to repay him\n&gt; for whst he did. I was loyal to him, and he deserted us. No, he\n&gt; deserves to die. Let&#39;s go to the old cave, then find Megatron. It&#39;a\n&gt; payback time.&quot;   She transfomed into wolf mode and looked up at\n&gt; Phobia. &quot;I&#39;ll be ok. I&#39;ll not die before my revenge is taken.&quot;  She\n&gt; opened her link. &quot;Drillbit, Phobia and I are getting ready to leave\n&gt; for the old cave to meet the others there. Please come with us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She closed her link and looked at Phobia,&quot;Don&#39;t tell Drillbit this,\n&gt; but if I get captured, kill me and put him in charge. i don&#39;t want to\n&gt; be used against my group. Got that Phobia? No leverage for our\n&gt; enemies.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Phobia looked to the sky as if it had all the right answers, the\n&gt; sky stared\n&gt; &gt; back mockingly not revealing it&#39;s vast knowlege. &quot;You&#39;re the wolf,\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; should be able to find his scent.&quot; he stood at the edge of a sloping\n&gt; &gt; landscape looking out to the horizon. &quot;The Alliance and Starscream\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; meeting us at the old cave.&quot; How&#39;re you holding up?&quot; he placed a\n&gt; hand on her\n&gt; &gt; chin &quot;Any second thoughts about destroying the piece of slag?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
