So =\r\nhe is going to proceed with his plans. \n\nAt this point, even with all the c=\r\nhanges Hydras would Definitly \nrecognize Cyclonus as his former servant whe=\r\nn he was still Galvatron. \n\nBTW what shape is the Black Fortress in? If the=\r\nre are repair drones \non it, would it be in any shape to sink under molten =\r\nrock? In either \ncase, I had no intentions of destroying you guys, just sha=\r\nking things \nup :) I figured this way would work better.\n\nAirly, it&#39;s up to=\r\n you what you want to happen in Atlantis, I hesitate \nto play in that area =\r\nonly because it belongs to another player . . . \nalthough if that Kraftlos =\r\ndoesn&#39;t return soon, perhaps he won&#39;t mind \nme NPC&#39;ing a few militia if you=\r\n need it??\n\nAny questions or comments please feel free to comment on or off=\r\n list.\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n"}}
