Never in his life had he feared losing control as h=\r\ne did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: I am honestly unsure how many of the Dragon=\r\n Corp there are, nor\n&gt; &gt; thier speed capabilities. Also I can only assume t=\r\nhat since no one\n&gt; &gt; responded before when I was verifying positions, every=\r\none save for\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus, Scourge, Rodimus, Remus, and the sweeps was stil=\r\nl at\nAtlantis\n&gt; &gt; during the battle??? Which would mean that all would have=\r\n some\ndistance\n&gt; &gt; to make up before they would catch up with Cyc. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Also I am having to assume that Cyclonus and crew are being shot at\n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nEFORE they fade from visual range, but they are moving fast. Cyc is\n&gt; &gt; not=\r\n going to hang around. So please consider my responses an amending\n&gt; &gt; of m=\r\ny last post.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the air, the fading from view b=\r\nut not quite gone Cyclonus is moving\n&gt; &gt; swiftly through the air. His body =\r\nis digesting the new power it has\n&gt; &gt; recieved and is enjoying it. Power fl=\r\nows through his circuits as his\n&gt; &gt; own systems merge with the now corrupte=\r\nd power of the matrix. His form\n&gt; &gt; seems to radiate a new power, his fusio=\r\nn powered engines thrusting him\n&gt; &gt; foward at amazing speeds. He knew he wo=\r\nuld be able to hold this new\n&gt; &gt; power, his instructions from Unicron had s=\r\naid as much, but the sheer\n&gt; &gt; power was almost intoxicating. Internally he=\r\n smiled.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was then that bullets from a gatling gun caught up wit=\r\nh him,\nlightly\n&gt; &gt; scored his armor and then fell behind as the Cyclonus wh=\r\nipped foward!\n&gt; &gt; It was not that the guns lacked power, but simply the spe=\r\ned that these\n&gt; &gt; ships were flying and the distance they were away, by the=\r\n time the\n&gt; &gt; bullets caught up they were as pebbles striking titanium shie=\r\nlds. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Howerever Cyclonus did have a response as twin missiles erru=\r\npted from\n&gt; &gt; beneath his wings. For a moment the missiles seemed to hover =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; as they changed direction orienting on thier target. Then they burst\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; into explosive movement, glowing with encapselated power. Rather then\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; missiles with flame behind them as Cyclonus&#39; missiles looked before,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthey were now like twin suns as they fairly irradiated power and\n&gt; &gt; destru=\r\nction as they moved toward the source of the bullets: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the miss=\r\niles streak passed, the sweeps fall in behind Cyclonus and\n&gt; &gt; Scourge, for=\r\nming a protective shield as they pick up speed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For the moment Rem=\r\nus is ignored as the Unicronians moved foward,\n&gt; &gt; picking up speed!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; _______________________________=\r\n___________________________\n&gt; &gt; Be a better pen pal. \n&gt; &gt; Text or chat with=\r\n friends inside Yahoo!
