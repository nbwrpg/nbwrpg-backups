The ships&#39;s computer came to his mind. He still had time to mess with it. He could still trick Hell Beast. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He got up and walked to the command room. He paused, putting an odd digit on the metal slab door. What if it happened again? What if he and the others would be on the run again, him severly damaged. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rattrap first? No, he had to try it. He opened the door and went inside. His arm was tense as he locked the door. He turned to the command chair. He reached behind his back, and from behind his armor, he pulled out several disks. They were the files of the &lt;EM&gt;Darkside&lt;/EM&gt;. He left one here. Primus. He thought Hell Beast had it. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
