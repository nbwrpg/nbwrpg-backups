It was actually a welcomed development, as he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; had become quite accustomed to being sightless. He could hear and sense\n&gt;&gt; &gt; things with much more clarity then he was able to sense with even with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; optics. His transmitter kicks in as a sonar system once more. It had \n&gt;&gt; &gt; been\n&gt;&gt; &gt; programed as such, but now, only used as a listening device. It gives \n&gt;&gt; &gt; him\n&gt;&gt; &gt; information about his surroundings and with his thermal sensory board, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; gets a general idea on what the room is like. Room enough for only one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; bot. It was hot, but being silver in color, he&#39;s able to deflect a good\n&gt;&gt; &gt; portion of that heat away from his body. Yet, he remains placid to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; avoid\n&gt;&gt; &gt; overheating. He knew that fighting would only make things worse for his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; systems. Instead of giving a show of protest, he decides to get himself\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in a near meditative state, relaxing his entire body so is not to cause\n&gt;&gt; &gt; strain on his system. He had learned quite a bit about meditation from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ninjabot training, and found it rather beneficial when encountered in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; times of great stress. He could hear things outside, and realized he \n&gt;&gt; &gt; had\n&gt;&gt; &gt; contact ability with Rodimus. All the while, even though he didn&#39;t show\n&gt;&gt; &gt; signs of strategizing, he silently assembles a plan to himself as to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; how\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he was going to get out of his next predicament. Phase one was already \n&gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; place. It was time for phase two. Getting captured was not part of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; plan at first, but then in all respects he could see the advantages of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; being caught. He had close contact with Rodimus and this was a perfect\n&gt;&gt; &gt; opportunity to turn things around without really raising suspicions. As\n&gt;&gt; &gt; soon as he had something in mind, he casually turns his head in \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; direction, following the mild sonar signal he bounces off, which hones \n&gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; on Rodimus without actually having any effects on anyone.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Tell me Rodimus, have you ever once been appreciated for all the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; effort\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you&#39;ve given to Hydras? From the sounds of things I don&#39;t think you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt; &gt; even recognized for your attributes.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In Night Shift&#39;s cell, Night Shift also uses a very meditative state, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; avoid getting himself overheated. He had learned that in tight\n&gt;&gt; &gt; situations, meditation was the best medicine. After a few moments of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; meditation, he casually looks around. The more relaxed his body was, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; less stress he places on his system. And the less stress he puts on his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; system, the less he felt tortured.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Not exactly my type of architecture but at least we&#39;re gettn&#39; some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; energon down here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He grins to himself.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s right, the less agression we show the more frustrated our \n&gt;&gt; &gt; guards\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will be. These guys expect us ta put up a fuss, yeah, well, I ain&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; &gt; gonna\n&gt;&gt; &gt; buy inta that. And I know Tucson Prime ain&#39;t either. I just hope Kup\n&gt;&gt; &gt; catches onta this&#39;n does the same... Poor guy, I don&#39;t wanna see him \n&gt;&gt; &gt; get\n&gt;&gt; &gt; overheated.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Outside the fortress, Rat Trap spots the oncomming objects, and holds \n&gt;&gt; &gt; on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; tight to Quickstride&#39;s mane.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;We got tailgaters!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride quickens his gallop and tries to step it up. At the same \n&gt;&gt; &gt; time,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; his stomach rumbles, as it feels as if it&#39;s getting just a bit bloated.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He had overdosed on the bean pods, and now his system was about to pay \n&gt;&gt; &gt; for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Uh ohh.. Rat trap, Umm.. You - better cover your nose.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap looks down to him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m tryn&#39; ta hold on for dear life here! Why&#39;dya want me ta do that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for?!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride&#39;s hooves almost appear not to touch the ground as he really\n&gt;&gt; &gt; accelerates in his gallop.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Because in a fraction of a nanosecond, things are NOT going to smell \n&gt;&gt; &gt; too\n&gt;&gt; &gt; good around here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap does as told.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;You&#39;re right, that ain&#39;t such a bad idea!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; No sooner does he cover his nose, Quickstride releases a large cloud of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; noxious fumes from his tail end which aleviates his bloat, enabling him \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; pick up his pace. A green cloud wafts upward.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; OOC: The bean pods I&#39;m reffering to were in Beast Wars, and had this\n&gt;&gt; &gt; effect on Rhinox who ate a considerable amount of these gassy pods in a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; particularly funny episode.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Who: CYCLONUS, Nightlight\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Throne Room\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s Great&quot;hissed the male by comlink&quot;As soon as they arrive pass\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; them to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the throne Room, When i finsh here I&#39;l go there&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Understood.&quot; Cyclonus said.

Cyclonus stood tall\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and robust, his armor shined purple and white, glinting slightly in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the relfected light of the room. He was like a powerful knight of some\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; great reknowned speaking to a fair princesses.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cyclonus folded one hand behind his back as he reached down with\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; other, bowing his head slightly in an almost courtly gesture. His\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fingers were strong yet somehow gentle as sought to grasp the Lady&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hand and help her to her feet. Tilting his head up and to the side\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; slightly Cyclonus looked at her, his penatrating gaze staring into\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hers, &quot;What is your name?&quot; he said.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
