Sure, I think I will go in for a little \nrecharge, Sir. Ow, now they hurt.&quot;\n\nWith a salute to Rodimus Uproar retires to the CR chambers to get some much \nneeded rest.\n\nMeanwhile, Straight Shot and Quickstride look to each other and then to \nRodimus.  Straight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot; I have some training in basic structural repair Sir.  Tucson taught me a \nfew things, but nothing too advanced.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds as well.\n\n&quot; I learned a bit of security system programming, plus intermediate \nstructural repair, and forcefield technology. And there&#39;s one more that&#39;s at \nthe top of my directory.. Ahh, that&#39;s right, I&#39;m also well versed in \nweaponry research and development.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot chimes in.\n\n&quot;Oh yeah, ditto, that&#39;s actually one of my finest attributes.  If we&#39;re \ngonna repair the Ark, we might wanna upgrade the weaponry system and \nsecurity shell.&quot;\n\nQuickstride ponders for a moment.\n\n&quot;And we&#39;ll wanna get some backup generators online too.  It&#39;ll come in handy \nbecause forcefields do take up a lot of power... Then there&#39;s the question \nof the power source...  The way it is now, we might not have enough ta go \non, and it would be nice ta fix that and sort of use something that isn&#39;t \ngonna harm the planet, but we wouldn&#39;t have ta worry about running dry.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks out the window of the Ark.\n\n&quot;I noticed there&#39;s some wind flowing through on this planet.. I&#39; wondering \nif we could harness that and use that for an alternate power source..&quot;\n\nQuickstride raises an optic.\n\n&quot;Oh yeahh...  Rodimus, Sir, with your permission we&#39;d like to construct a \nwindmill turbine to help us produce our own alternate energy source.  This \nway, we don&#39;t harm the planet and we gather our own energy without robbing \nit from the environment.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;then all members of the maximals should be healed and then we can start\n&gt; to insolate the ark&quot;said dryly Perceptor&quot;Do you have medical skill?? we \n&gt; will\n&gt; need that to reactivate Nightlight, and heal the medics...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy turned to look back at Perceptor, &quot;Affirmative. I have the complete\n&gt; the complete medical training from both Maximal and Predacon experts. I \n&gt; also\n&gt; possess the complete technical specifications of each and every unit up \n&gt; and\n&gt; to this point.&quot; There was no pride in Legacy&#39;s words, no hubris, only a \n&gt; cold\n&gt; recitation of facts.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson gives a casual smile to Rodimus. It was like old times. They had\n&gt; fought hard together before and now, with Rodimus back safely he was \n&gt; assured\n&gt; that there would be nothing that would stand in the way of their \n&gt; friendship.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus smiled back at Tuscon, a smile akin more to his days as Hot Rod \n&gt; when\n&gt; he had not a care in the world and no more responsibility than he cared to\n&gt; take on.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I want you to know that this time, Rodimus, I won&#39;t let anyone or\n&gt; anything stand in the way of our comradship. I learned a great deal the \n&gt; day\n&gt; I was taken off line. I learned to watch my back at all times, and never \n&gt; to\n&gt; let my guard down. So if anyone dares to cross our line again, there will \n&gt; be\n&gt; a serious lesson to be learned. But, that lesson is twice learned when it\n&gt; comes from two Primes instead of just one. As soon as I&#39;m fully \n&gt; operational,\n&gt; of course, I - think it would benefit all of us, if we had a more\n&gt; substantial base of operations.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks over to them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Heeey, sorta like Metroplex in the past.. Of course, there aren&#39;t any\n&gt; transformers that size anymore huh?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s right. But it doesn&#39;t mean it has to stop us from creating a \n&gt; &gt; base\n&gt; of operations. I&#39;d like to also preserve the land in it&#39;s purity. Perhaps\n&gt; create something that intergrates with the environment. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride listens in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, sort of an organic base but sort of not. Kind of.. Ya know, that\n&gt; might be doable. Maximal bases are like that, and I&#39;m sure we can find\n&gt; materials for it without upsetting anything or anyone. And we can always\n&gt; power the base with solar pannels, so that way we don&#39;t drain the planet \n&gt; of\n&gt; it&#39;s natural resources. And if we need to create a fuel source, why not go\n&gt; botanical? Non chemical means no pollution.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson chuckles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I like the sound of that. But first, I think we have more important\n&gt; issues to deal with. Hydras.. For now, the Ark alone will have to do, but \n&gt; in\n&gt; time, we can think of expanding our base of operations, perhaps convert it\n&gt; to residential quarters, where we can be assured safety. Again, this will\n&gt; have to come in time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He staggers somewhat, and points to the CR Chambers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I - better not waste any more time getting to the CR chambers.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;All right old friend.&quot; Rodimus said, &quot;We can talk about that later, but \n&gt; we\n&gt; had better get you moving now.&quot; Rodimus gently but firmly urges Tuscon to\n&gt; the recharging chamber.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He slowly makes his way over to the CR chambers, and makes it to a large\n&gt; booth, where he sits down and then lies back. With a sigh, it&#39;s not long\n&gt; before he goes into a sleep mode. At last, he listens to his systems and\n&gt; settles down for a much deserved recharge.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus helped Tuscon to the recharging chamber and settled him in. As it\n&gt; started to hum and the indicator lights began to show a nice even recharge\n&gt; the Autobot commander turned back to the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You look like you could use some time in the recharge chamber as well.&quot;\n&gt; Rodimus said to Uproar as he noting the dings and dents he had, especially\n&gt; the one he received when trying to take on Cyclonus and falling out of the\n&gt; air.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Legacy, Perceptor, I will need the two of you to begin work on repairing\n&gt; the rest of our medical staff. From what Ramulus has sent to me they are\n&gt; both now in the medical bay awaiting you two.&quot; Rodimus&#39; voice was calm and\n&gt; no non sense as he looked over the group.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Straight Shot, Quickstride, what sort of technical or building training \n&gt; do\n&gt; either of you have?&quot; Rodimus glanced around the Ark meaningfully. &quot;We \n&gt; canot\n&gt; completely fix the Ark, but repairing some of the major breaches will \n&gt; allow\n&gt; us to keep the Predacons out the next time they attack.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus smiled ruefully as he rubbed a small dent on his head, &quot;Hopefully\n&gt; that will not be anytime soon.&quot; It would seem that sometime soon Rodimus\n&gt; would need his time to repair – but not before he got the ball rolling.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
