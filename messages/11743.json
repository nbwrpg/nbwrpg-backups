The Maximals had been \nplaced in the Brig, seperate from each other until the Widow decided there \nfate.\n    After a short while, Aracnia walked inside, bowcaster in claw, and wiped \nthe dirst from her black and yellow armor. &quot;Well, hello everyone.&quot;\n    Aerostreak stood. &quot;Commader Black Aracnia, I am Aerostreak, and these are \nmy partners, Gunatix and Grappler. We came a long distance to find you.&quot;\n    Black Aracnia nodded, and noted that Grappler was a red Tarantula. SHe \nmade her way closer, and then remembered Adrax. &quot;So, why have you come Adrax?&quot;\n    Adrax growled, &quot;We wil ltalk later, behinde closed doors. For now I will \nshow myself to quarters and rest.&quot;\n    He stomper past her and out the door, leaveing her alone with the new \nadditions to the Predacon force. She looked them over and decided they should \nhave a lesson or two in basic training. Paralysis could do that. For now she \nwould assign them rooms and have...Quickstrike brief them on the status of \nwar.\n    &quot;Please, follow me. We have lots to discuss.&quot; She said, leading them to \nthere rooms. Afterwards she would check on Darkmouse.\n\n"}}
