Remember awhile back I wanted to host a chat with\n&gt; everyone to celebrate the anniversary? Well, I was thinking we could\n&gt; use the chat here at egroups cause the one at the sigh isn&#39;t very\n&gt; good. But the thing is, and don&#39;t get your hopes up because it isn&#39;t\n&gt; official, that II could get Bob Skir, one of the writers and\n&gt; Producers of Beast Wars, to join us at the chat! What do you all\n&gt; think?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ignatius\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No, nothing. You aren&#39;t doing anything wrong. It&#39;t just\n&gt; that...sometimes Prebon might be hard to please. He could ask a lot\n&gt; of you. Are you prepared for that?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
