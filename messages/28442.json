Looking around the battle, Mantle saw the other Maximals \nfighting. From the look of their base, things weren&#39;t good. He looked down \nat his team, sending a message to their minds:\n\n&quot;You guys go ahead, I&#39;ll battle from here.&quot; He looks up in time to see a big \nrobot reaching for something that looked like a bunch of metal. His mind \nprobed out, seeing that it was a robot. Mantle was a bit surprised at all \nthe rage that he could feel around him, as well as the pain and suffering, \nbut he was used to it by now. On his first several battles it surprised him, \nthough, and made him a bit less good of a leader untill he got used to it. \nBut he was used to it now, and no one was going to push the Maximals around \nwhile he was on this planet!\n\nMantle concentrated hard, making his mind reach out across the battlefield. \nHe flexed his mind and Firearm&#39;s body rose from the shields, avoiding \nMenasor&#39;s grab. Mantle slowly lowered to the ground, his teeth clenched. One \nof the setbacks of his ability to use his mind to directly influence robots \nwas that it created a temporary link between those robots and himself. In \nthis case, Mantle could feel the pain that Firearm was feeling, and it was \nalmost too much. But he held on, flipping Firearm through the air with his \nmind. Sweat poured down his forehead as he made Firearm&#39;s body quickly fly \nthrough the air toward the Element.\n\nThrough nearly closed eyes, Mantle could see the rest of his team emerging \nfrom the shield, still firing. He saw that Cinder was looking through the \nbattle, searching for the bot she had been worrying about as she fired more \nat Deamon Wulf. His eyes drifted to the rest of his family, seeing Rocky \nfire two more missiles at Dark Claw. Aqua nearly tripped over the uneven \nground, causing one of his spears to dig into the earth, but the next three \nwere aimed exactly at Flesh Ripper&#39;s head. Above him, Mist gained altitude, \nfiring charges at Menasor&#39;s hand.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
