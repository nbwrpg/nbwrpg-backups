He tried to think of Zyber&#39;s question. It was so \nhard to remember. He crouched and set his arm full of firewood down. He set \na few thin pieces in the fireplace, then placed more thicker ones on it.\n\n&quot;I do not remember,&quot; he said as he worked. &quot;It has been many countless days \nand nights since I came on-line. All I knew that I was alone. No one came \nand told me where I belong, so I ventured out of my own, and found this cave \nas my home. I guard it. I didn&#39;t know others like me existed.&quot;\n\nHe slid back the furs on his lower arm and revealed the bare silver forearm. \nHe extended it and fired a hot shot lazer into the pile of wood. He watched \nas a flame developed and engulfed the bottom of it. He slid the furs back \nover his arm.\n\n&quot;Would you join me by the fire? It has been some time since I had fair \ncompany. We could talk.&quot;\n\n\n&gt;From: Iron Raptor &lt;ironraptor13@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: 28 May 2000 14:10:20 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* A small smile developed on Zyber&#39;s face as she head Rowdy, she nodded and \n&gt;then looked back at the furs as they began to dry. She would collect them \n&gt;later once they were less damp, that would also give her time to visit with \n&gt;Rowdy as she had originally intended.\n&gt;She then looked back at Rowdy Wolf and slowly began to move into him cave \n&gt;again, she thought it wise not to even mention Striker&#39;s visit. It was a \n&gt;time to relax, not  a time to argue.\n&gt;She saw the clod spot beside the fire pit and then thought about how long \n&gt;it had been since another bot had sat there, obviously not for a while.\n&gt;Zyber walked over to that empty spot and sat down, she looked back over at \n&gt;Rowdy.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; If I may ask, how long have you been here?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;____________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt;address on the Net!\n&gt;http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt;Want to make new friends all over the world?
