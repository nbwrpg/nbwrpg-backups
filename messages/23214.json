Obviously uncomfortable.\nVlad sat back on his heels and looked down at her, patting her head before \nreturning his optics to the darkness beyond the pod.**\n\n� Don�t worry. There has to be someone here�but I�m not going to wait all \nday to find out.�\n\n** And with that Vlad stood up as tall as he could in the pod and began to \nwork on the hatch, hearing a hiss of air as the seal broke and felt cool \ndrops of water splatter onto his face as the hatch lifted. Peeking his head \nup and out of the clear sphere as he pushed the hatch back, smelling the \nfamiliar scent of metal and rust.\nIt was a ship of some sort he was in, peering through the darkness to see \nthe slight outlines of a door on the other side of the room.\nVlad then looked down to see some sort of bot laying on the floor by the \npod, one he remembered as the one whom had dragged him into this ship. But \nVlad only regarded him as nothing, hauling himself out of the pod and \nfeeling it roll under his weight. The hatch moving until its� edge was only \na few inches off the ground. Vlad catching himself with his feet.\nChesta easily jumped out and shook herself, then settling down at an easy \nslump as Vlads� feet.\nVlad sighed and looked around the dark room, eventually walking over to the \ndoor and running his fingers over it, stepping back as the door opened and \nfiltered in light. His optics blinded by the light.*\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
