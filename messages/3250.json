Liono is in \ncontrol of the Ark as far as I know, and I KNOW he put all of the People&#39;s \ngroup on enemy.  So you can&#39;t just waltz right in.  If your guys want to be \nMaximal, work it out with Liono.  He doesn&#39;t seem to want to be allies with \nyour People&#39;s Group, and he&#39;s set the defenses to monitor you as enemy.  So \nif you come in range, you will be shot and you wouldn&#39;t be let inside unless \nsomeone opened them.  That&#39;s all I know.  Discuss it with Liono, not myself)\n\n"}}
