She followed orders from \nAracnia, but she hated being this close to Megatron.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron looked to Quickstrike. He hated the little worm. Ever \nscince he \n&gt; joined with Aracnia he had changed. The loyal little expendable \nsoldier he \n&gt; once knew was dead....this new Quickstrike was intelligent. And a \nsoldier \n&gt; with intelligence often caused trouble.\n&gt;     &quot;Its bots like you, roach, that are making the Predacon reunion \nso \n&gt; difficult! I only want to help, you only want to cause trouble. How \nyo came \n&gt; to be Sub-Commander is beyond my comprehension. Yes.&quot; Megatron said \nas he \n&gt; looked down from atop rampages shoulders.\n&gt;     Rampage entered the clearing that contained the ship. He could \nsee \n&gt; Inferno, Tarantulas, Aerostreak, Tankkor, Paralysis, and Black \nAracnia \n&gt; standing waiting for them. Most of them withdrew there guns at the \nsight of \n&gt; Megatron.\n&gt;     &quot;What do you think your doing?!?!?! That is the traitor!&quot; \nInferno yelled, \n&gt; going into a fighting stance, his body ridged and flexed.\n&gt;     Megatron frowned. &quot;Tut tut my fellow commrads....I want to help \nyo-\n&gt;     Before he could get another word out, Inferno blasted his head \noff of his \n&gt; body and sent in falling to the ground. Rampage then dropped his \nbody.\n&gt;     &quot;Take him inside. we can remove his arms and legs...that way he \nwont hurt \n&gt; anything, or anyone. Come on troops, lets move in.&quot; Aracnia said \nushering in \n&gt; her troops. \n&gt;     &quot;Anything wrong Quickstuff?&quot; She asked kindly, smileing....for \nonce.\n\n\n"}}
