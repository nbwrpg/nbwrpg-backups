Should you\n&gt; win, you would \n&gt; prove that you are a better warrior than your\n&gt; officer, thus proving \n&gt; him wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; She paused, then started moving back to the base.\n&gt; She waved him to \n&gt; follow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: Now about the Kerenskys... They are the\n&gt; founders of all Clans, \n&gt; the makers of our society and one of the most, if\n&gt; not the most revered \n&gt; Bloodline among all Clans. Some of us maintain that\n&gt; our duty as \n&gt; Warriors is to protect the Inner Sphere. We oppose\n&gt; the Crusaders \n&gt; saying it is a desecrated place and that it deserves\n&gt; only to be \n&gt; conquered and brought back up into a stronger Clan\n&gt; society. It is all \n&gt; interpretation of the words of Nicholas Kerensky,\n&gt; the first Ilkhan, \n&gt; and it has led many to die, both among and outside\n&gt; the Clans.\n&gt; \n&gt; She closed her eyes remembered all too well the two\n&gt; days she had spent \n&gt; evading the massive ComGuard battlemechs at the\n&gt; Great battle of \n&gt; Tukkayid. She had seen friends die there, and she\n&gt; felt that it was \n&gt; foolish for such a waste as the invasion.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Owlhawk:  I assume it means to challenge him in\n&gt; &gt; combat, but I don&#39;t know who Kerensky is.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya glared at the bot straight in his eyes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Noble intention about the animals, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; following orders is not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the only thing that makes a warrior. Remember, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told you that we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; abhor waste. Destroying a forest is the kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing that debalances \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a world&#39;s environment needlessly. A military\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compound can be built on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rock farther away. In that situation, when you\n&gt; feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your officer&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; orders betray the spirits of Kerensky, you can\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; youmust challenge \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him to a Trial.

She was not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instinctively\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harsh or cruel, but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her tone showed that she was to be listened\n&gt; to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Owlhawk may be a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior, but she was more. She was a Wolf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and she had to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; break him from the tactics and habits he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make him into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Neg. A Clan warrior that is not\n&gt; prepared,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentally or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically is as good as the freebirth scum\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; populating the bandit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste. You must learn to be ready at all\n&gt; times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She eased her tone. She had rebuked him, and\n&gt; now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instruct him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: The Clan rituals have two goals; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one is honor. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forces meeting in a Trial meet in a circle\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equals. This way, we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight zellbringen, single combat. I admit\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessity may prevent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us from always achieving single combat, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; honor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does not diminish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this way. The second reason for Trials is\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevents waste. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Clans have survived their birthing because\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reduced wastes of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all kind to a minimum. Remember that.
