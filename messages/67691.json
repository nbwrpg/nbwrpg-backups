Why are they here again?\n\nOn 1/11/08, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; At the outskirts of the Valley Mine several unknown figures stand\n&gt; hidden amidst stones and rocks, far down the dried up river bed. One of\n&gt; them is looking towards the distant city as they speak amongst\n&gt; themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;All of you know what to do. I don&#39;t have to reiterate it here.&quot; the\n&gt; tallest of the figures spoke, his form strong and resolute. &quot;Find out\n&gt; what you can about the target, relay it to the others and prepare to\n&gt; acquire it on my command.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What about the cybers in there?&quot; says a strong female voice, who&#39;s\n&gt; whisper still had to be stiffled. &quot;Won&#39;t they object to us?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Unlikely.&quot;  a deep blue armored figure spoke up, his military bearing\n&gt; obvious both in his voice and stance as he crouched in the shadows\n&gt; looking at the distant city in view-finders, &quot;We have no rank or\n&gt; insignia, and our identities are largely unknown. Infiltration should\n&gt; not be difficult.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;*If* our intell is even correct.&quot; Spoke up another female voice. She\n&gt; shifted position and for a moment the shadows parted to reveal a\n&gt; portion  her crimson armor before the darkness enfolded her again. &quot;It\n&gt; is old now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That it what we are here to find out.&quot; says the first voice, gruff and\n&gt; commanding, quite obviously their leader. &quot;Get in, find out what we can\n&gt; find and get out. Nothing more and nothing less.&quot; He turned to look at\n&gt; the others. &quot;Any questions?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Silence answered his question.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Good.&quot; He activated his com panel and opened an encrypted channel,\n&gt; &quot;How is the terrain, is everything in readiness?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; From his position much nearer to the quarry a dark figure looked from\n&gt; the shadows, his shielding protecting him from the prying optic as well\n&gt; as the errant sensor. &quot;Prepare yourselves.&quot; his whisper silent voice\n&gt; emanated over the channels. He paused and looked around one last time,\n&gt; passive scanners seeking anything out of the ordinary ....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Is there anything we should know about the Bushido base before\n&gt; entering???\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and\n&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
