But now, we \nneed to get \n&gt; down to the business at hand.  We all have our separate reasons for \nbeing \n&gt; here.  You, Rodimus want Galvatron dead.  And, you, Tyrael, want \nMegatron \n&gt; dead.  I want them separated.  I would prefer Galvatron not die, but \nI am ... \n&gt; flexible in that regard.&quot;  He looks between the two of them.  &quot;We \nmust \n&gt; organize our forces quickly.  And effectively.  Are there any others \nyou \n&gt; think should participate in this attack?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
