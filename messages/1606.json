Jackle swung around, \npistol in hand, and began firing at Killer. He only got two random shots off \nbefore Set fired a blast into his shoulder, sending him sprawling to the \nfloor. :::\n\n::: Set ::: They will live. Im glad you were there, Killer. If you werent, I \nmight have had a problem.\n\n::: He glances at the two fallen bots. :::\n\n::: Set ::: Place them in a holding cell. I will contact there base and tel \nlthem we are holding them hostage. Prehaps we can get some much needed \nequitment from them.\n\n::: He leaves the room only to be his by a smoking drone. It hists him and \nhits the floor. :::\n\n::: Set ::: What the hell is this now?\n\n::: Megatron ::: I am Megatr-\n\n::: the drone goes offline. :::\n\n::: Set ::: Megatron?! Imagine that....\n\n::: He pickes up the bot and goes into a storage room. Two other bots were in \nthere cleaning. :::\n\n::: Set ::: You two, do we have any protforms or and blanks?\n\n::: Bot ::: I do belive we have four remaining.\n\n::: Set ::: Four?! Out of-\n\n::: He shook his head ::: Very well. Transfer the spark of this drone into a \nprotoform, now.\n\n::: The bots did as they were told. In a moment or two, Megatron raised out \nof the coffin like stasis pod in a blank protoform. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: By the pit! Its about time.\n\n::: Set ::: You dont look like Megatron....\n\n::: Megatron ::: Give me the transmetal 2 tech box and I will fix that.\n\n::: Set ::: And I should help you because...?\n\n::: Megatron ::: We both want to see the Maximals, Allience, and Predacons \ndead. We can work togrether, in a coalalition.\n\n::: Set smiles ::: Riiight. A coalition.\n\n::: Megatron ::: Well?\n\n::: Set ::: Ill see what I can do. For now, you wil lremain in a holding cell.\n\n::: Megatron ::: What? You can do tha-\n\n::: Set left the room, with Megatron cursing at the two bots who were going \nto put him in his cage. In a protoform he was still defenseless. And what \nabout the tech box? Transmetal 2? Interesting....it required a bit of \nreasearch, but Set would have it, and with it he would control Megatron. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Pheniox ::: There is still no word from Hell Beast. Rampage, Inferno, and \nTankkor have been gone forever...and Rattrap along with Transanulas are still \nin our custody.\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Well, Gremlin is still here.\n\n::: Pheniox shot back ::: Thats comfortimg.\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: So, should we take command?\n\n::: Pheniox ::: I see no other option at the moment. And i was the general of \nthe largest anti-maximla resistance group ever...\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Then by all means, lead us.\n\n::: Pheniox took to the command chair :::\n\n::: On a Predacon Transmission she said ::: All Predacons. Please report. I \nhave taken command for the moment. Commander Hell Beast is missing, belived \nto be at the newly crashed ship. I reccomend all  Predacons withdraw from \nthere current missions and attempt to take control of the new ship. Please \nrespond at once.\n\n"}}
