He had been too excited to feel her fear, but that \nwasn&#39;t what was getting him down. What was getting him down was that \nshe said she no longer trusted him.\n\n-Its ok,- he thinks to her, about to add on to that when Shadow Cat \narrives. He glances at Iron Raptor, raising an eyebrow.\n\n-An old friend?- he thinks to her, knowing that Shadow Cat couldn&#39;t \nhear the thought. This new way of communication between him and Iron \nRaptor could come in very handy...\n\nHis scanners pick up Angel Prime heading for his location.\n\n-Arcangel is heading for us,- he thinks to Iron Raptor, -Or someone \nthat registers very closely to Arcangel&#39;s sign\n\n\n"}}
