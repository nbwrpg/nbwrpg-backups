He growls, looking at \nSlayer, the two bots aproaching each other again.\n\n&quot;Ready for death, Maximal?&quot; Slayer says, stepping back to keep his \nbalance as laser hits him in the shoulder. His rocket launchers take \naim again, firing a rocket at SnowCat as he watches Ramulus \ncarefully. He wanted a good battle with this Maximal, the femm was \njust a distraction. He growls as a dagger digs into his back, firing \noff a rocket at BlueStreak.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; SnowCat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She saw the rockets coming and jumped infront of Ramulus.  \nRemembered \n&gt; how he had saved her life, now it was time to repay the favor.  She \n&gt; stood in front of him, watching the rockets home in.  Both hit her \nin \n&gt; her side and she was flung over Ramulus and several yards away from \n&gt; him.  She layed on her side, lots of wires were exposed.  She \ngroaned \n&gt; and stood up slowly on all fours. She glares at Striker and fired \n&gt; both optic lazars at him.  She then started to jog over to Ramulus, \n&gt; still firing on Striker. \n\n\n"}}
