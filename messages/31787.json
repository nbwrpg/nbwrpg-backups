Today was the day, 1 year ago, that i joined this RPG.  I had been do=\r\ning \n  searches all over the internet for RPGs, but none really caught my e=\r\nye until \n  i saw the link- Neo Beast Wars RPG. I decided id like to check =\r\nit out, and \n  fell in love as soon as i read the story and looked at the c=\r\nharacters.  I \n  knew i must join immeadiately, so i used an old favorite c=\r\nharacter, Torca.   \n  My profile was an immeadiate mode, and i was pretty s=\r\ntupid when i was new.  I \n  remember my first post like it was yesterday.  =\r\nTorca burst into the Predacon \n  base and put his gun up to Quickstrike and=\r\n tried to eliminate his spark.   \n  Talon got really pissed at me.  But soo=\r\nn i started to catch on, and created \n  stronger characters and some good s=\r\ntories.  In my time here in the RPG, i saw \n  many changes.  I&#39;ve seen ultr=\r\na-powerful groups rise and fall, extremely \n  talented RPers come and go(no=\r\nt to mention a lot of idiots), and built \n  firendships with members.  Id l=\r\nike to thank Soulstice for his friendship and \n  partnership, Zardus for pu=\r\ntting up with me through my early times, and \n  everyone else that ive had =\r\nthe pleasure(or displeasure) of RPing with, and i \n  hope my next year here=\r\n will be even better.
