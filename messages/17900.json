Rather upset he tries again and \nbecomes a bird.  He finally reverts to his combined form and realizes he has \nweapons in this form.  He decides to try for robot mode later and arms \nhimself.  He draws a bow and arrow and launches one arrow into Whistler&#39;s \nother shoulder (the one previously undamaged) disabling his weapons and \nsending him into stasis lock.  He fires another two arrows.  One aimed \ndirectly at Dinotron&#39;s head the other at Rust&#39;s head.  His shots fired he \nasks &quot;Why are you fighting?&quot;\n\n"}}
