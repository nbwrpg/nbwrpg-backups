Good chance he&#39;s s=\r\ntill in a sour mood.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He gets up and continues to escort Wheelie t=\r\no Tucson&#39;s quarters.  They come to a waiting area teaming with many masterf=\r\nully restored Cybertronian artafacts personally restored by Tucson himself.=\r\n  One such piece, an ancient cross bow lies displayed within a glass case. =\r\n The lighting in the room reflects off the weapon&#39;s frame.  Uproar stops to=\r\n admire it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Wow....  I&#39;ve never seen this before, look at it, Tu=\r\ncson actually restored this a long time ago.  And over to the left, an anci=\r\nent Cybertronian time piece.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He then points to other artifacts in=\r\n the room.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; He restored all these things.

It would be wrong to intake, without his permission, or =\r\nhis walls they would break.  This is where he sets his spark, to go in with=\r\nout his duress would be to set it apart.  Thank you for your time, but I sh=\r\nan&#39;t wish to go in with just thine.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, as he left, giving a salute=\r\n, going to transform to his small racer mode and began to dart along the co=\r\nrridors of the Autobase.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
