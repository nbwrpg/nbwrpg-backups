I&#39;m assisting the Maxies in Relay as per&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  emergency protocols and I&#39;m directing the defenses against that&lt;br&gt; brute.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  I require further instructions and backups, my Lord.\n Oh, and&lt;br&gt; just how&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  large is that coming Pred force?&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  He ducked as something blew up nearby.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  --- In &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.&lt;wbr&gt;com&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@&lt;wbr&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt;&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; ::Lord Elder::&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Deep within The Watcher headquarters signals go off, waking the&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  Watcher leader.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Elder: What in the hell?&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; He checks the monitoring systems that The Watchers have set up&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  around the planet.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Elder: One of the Predacon camps looks like their mobalizing to&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  attack Relay. Wonderful. Sometimes I think The Minions are easier to&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  deal... What&#39;s this?&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Elder\n locks onto a new signature.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Elder: It&#39;s Decepticon, but not a normal Con signal. Something&lt;br&gt; new.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  Something different.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; He opens a comm to his men.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Elder: Watchers: I believe a new twist in these Beast Wars has&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  happened. I want Watchers at Relay ASAP. Do not get involved&lt;br&gt; unless I&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  order it but I want to study the battle there. Right now the Silver&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  Wing Maximals are dealing with some kind of new Decepticon but it&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  appears that Predacons are moving to attack as well.
