Sky Shadow you are in Charge;\n&gt;&gt; Fractyl and Iguanus will go with you, if you have another bot that think\n&gt;&gt; that could be useful as scientis or warrior feel free to take him or her\n&gt;&gt; with you, but I recomend a small force and Cyclonus and Tarantulas will\n&gt;&gt; remain in the base. Your isntructions are check the area and inform me\n&gt;&gt; before take the protophorm. Tarantulas, you will Assist Cyclonus with\n&gt;&gt; remodeling the base... &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sky Shadow turned to face Hydras and nodded, &quot;Yes sir.&quot; he said as he\n&gt; bowed before him, his bulky form still somehow graceful as he moved,\n&gt; his jaws speading into a triumphant grin, &quot;It will be as you command.\n&gt; I believe that Iguanus and Fractyl will be sufficient.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Taratulus looked almost stunned for a moment before he scowled, &quot;Work\n&gt; with Cyclonus? He doesn&#39;t know the difference between a steel and tar\n&gt; fumes.&quot; the Predacon mumbled to himself. He looked up at Hydras as if\n&gt; wondering if he heard him, &quot;Yes sir.&quot; he said fiinally before he\n&gt; lapsed into a brooding silence.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus was still in the medical bay but he had been monitoring the\n&gt; conversation from there in case anything needed his input, &quot;Sir.&quot;\n&gt; Cyclonus said over loudspeaker to Hydras, &quot;Fractyl is finishing up his\n&gt; work on Scourge and will be ready to report to Sky Shadow within the\n&gt; next 2400 astro seconds.&quot; (20 minutes)\n&gt;\n&gt; The rest of the Predacons, the fuzors, Inferno, Waspinator, and\n&gt; Terrorsaur began to mill around a bit, &quot;So when will we be able to\n&gt; kick some Maximal Keesters?&quot; Quickstike said to Hydras, &quot;My foot is\n&gt; just itchin to be planted in a Maximal&#39;s hindplate!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; That got a chuckle from a few of the others. Yes, they were always\n&gt; willing to get into a battle when they could.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
