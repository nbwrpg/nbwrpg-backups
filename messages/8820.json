She looked at all the damage \nthat the ship has sustained.  She shook her head.  She wondered how \nthey would ever manage to repair this much damage to the once great \nship.\n\nShe turned the corner and saw Lunarpine laying on the floor all \ncurled up.  He looked like he was lost in thought.  She stood there a \nmoment looking at him.  She always thought of him a majestic and \nregal creature.  She smiled while looking at him.  No matter what, \nshe always felt safe with him.  Even when they sparred or just \ntalked. She loved being around him.  She found that she couldn&#39;t help \nherself but care for him.\n\nShe looked at him and noticed something else.  She thought he looked \nlonely.  Not for friends or anything, but the companionship of anther \nwolf.  She knew how he felt.  She too missed the commpany of other \nowls.  \n\nShe turned and walked away.  She hoped that he had not noticed her.  \nShe wanted to help him. She looked down at her body and thought a \nmoment. Then a huge smile appeared on her face.\nShe ran down the hall and into the repair bay.  If her landing pod \ncould change her form into an owl, why not into a wolf.  She about \nthe repair bay looking for an old pod with a form scanner still in \noperational order.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine curled up in the engine room, The Arks frame full of \nholes \n&gt; there too, much like the rest of the ship. He didn&#39;t know how the \n&gt; Maximals would set the timeline straight, but everything must have \n&gt; turned out right, he still existed. \n&gt; \n&gt; It was later in the day, the sun wasn&#39;t beating down as much. He \nwas \n&gt; lonely. A lone wolf in a pack, a duck without a flocking group to \n&gt; join. (It&#39;s a comparison, he didn&#39;t accualy turn into a duck.) He \n&gt; remembered his first day as a wolf, the pack recognized him as \nalien \n&gt; to thier group and chased him off.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Theres gotta be others&quot; he said out loud to himself remembering \n&gt; Striker. If Striker existed then why not other wolves? If not for \nhis \n&gt; pledge of loyalty as it was, to Ramulus he&#39;d set out right now to \n&gt; find his answers. Duty came first, before friendship, before \n&gt; information, even before his own personal feelings.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She stepped out of the chamber.
