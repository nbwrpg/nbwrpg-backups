Will Hydras and his team be taking any\n&gt; precautions as far as security, or is everyone just sorta traveling in\n&gt; disorganized pack? Is everyone going with Hydras or are some staying\n&gt; behind? Will Hydras be doing anything with the shuttle like leaving a\n&gt; gaurd with it, sending it back to base or whatever?\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, and as a note - you can do as you like, but keep in mind that the\n&gt; ground here is fairly open and barren, which means very few places to\n&gt; hide unless someone has some sort of invisibility or something.\n&gt;\n&gt; I look forward to your reply :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
