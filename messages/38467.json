It stood somewhat\nhunched on\n&gt; &gt; two feet, it&#39;s oblong head forward to maintain balance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the right a snake alien made from Najahs cobra DNA coiled about five\nfeet\n&gt; &gt; tall. Its forked toung dripping deadly venom suitable for melting it&#39;s\nprey\n&gt; &gt; before digesting it. It uncoiled pushing itself to it&#39;s full length of\n&gt; &gt; aproximately fifteen feet. A dark green crossbread of it&#39;s serpentine\nscales\n&gt; &gt; and the aliens armored almost shelllike skin reflected the light of the\n&gt; &gt; room. It flexxed a hood about six feet in diameter. &quot;An impresive sight\nif I\n&gt; &gt; may be so modest.&quot; Lady Hawk was torn by her accomplishment. She was\n&gt; &gt; fearfull for what these crossbreeds were to be used for, but she\ncouldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; help to feel a small bit of pride based on the life she had just\ncreated.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
