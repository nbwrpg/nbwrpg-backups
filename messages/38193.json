A reply message was \nsent.\n\n&quot;Greetings unidentified beings.  Thank you for inquiring about joining in our \ncombat trials.  There are two leagues possible to join.    The Regular, and \nthe Gestalt.  The regular will consist of normal combatants with numerous one \non one battles until there is a final one on one battle to determine the IGL \nChampion of the Regular League.  The victor will receive five protoforms and \nequipment to mold them into anything they desire, including a gestalt team.&quot;\n\n&quot;No doubt that would help any faction begin rising to power.  And for the \nGestalt League, all gestalt teams may fight one one, as in one gestalt team \nagainst the other.  These &#39;one&#39; on &#39;one&#39; matches will continue until there \nare only two teams left and the victor of that final bout will be IGL \nChampions of the Gestalt League.  They will receive armor modifications, 200 \nkilos of liquid energon, and if they fight well enough a protoform and \nequipment for them to do with as they wish.&quot;\n\n&quot;Normally the bouts are not fights to the deaths, but upon request and \nagreement from the combatants this kind of match can occur (if you have any \nspare chars. you need to kill off, hint, hint).  A faction may enter as many \nwarriors into each league as wanted.  In example, one faction could enter \ntwenty-five robots into a league.  Or if they had four gestalt teams, they \ncould enter them into the league.  Although, they would have to fight each \nother as if they were enemies.&quot;\n\n&quot;We hope this has answered any question and await your reply of what your \nfaction is and who from that faction will be entering which leagues.  Thank \nyou.&quot;\n\n"}}
