No one else \nhad \n&gt; offered to lead the Alliance, so it was all Nemesis&#39; turn.  As it \nwas \n&gt; destined.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pressing a few buttons on the armrest of the throne, he had opened \na comlink \n&gt; on all Alliance radio frequencies, all of them secure and hard, if \nnot \n&gt; impossible to crack.  Powerful satellites from the Iron Fist \nbroadcasted \n&gt; Nemesis&#39; new orders through Alliance domain and beyond.  From \nAlliance Island \n&gt; off the coast of Spain to the other side of the globe.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This is Nemesis Enforcer.  Zardus, Future Zardus, and Wolfgang are \nnowhere \n&gt; to be found and therefore that leaves a window of opportunity for \nthe next in \n&gt; line, me.  Some may be thinking &#39;Wait, I&#39;m more powerful, smart, \nand \n&gt; qualified than Nemeis.&#39; Well my friends, those people are morons \nand great \n&gt; whomping bobula, will die if they mess with me.\n&gt; \n&gt; First order of business, revolt and in fighting in the Alliance \nwill not be \n&gt; tolerated.  If anyone attempts to overthrow my regime, they will be \nexecuted \n&gt; painfully.  I have much of the Alliance systems hacked and under my \ncontrol \n&gt; alone.  With the dispersment of the top three Alliance members  the \nAlliance \n&gt; ranks are in chaos.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Therefore, all Alliance remembers are now required to radio in \nwith their \n&gt; names, locations, and what they are currently doing.  Please be \nprompt.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other side of the Alliance Island in the salt water, Jaws \nswam idly in \n&gt; his great white shark mode, when receiving a transmission from the \nnewly \n&gt; self-appointed leader of the Alliance.   He sent a response.  &quot;This \nis Jaws \n&gt; outside of the Alliance base.  I&#39;m patrolling waters, over.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the original Alliance base, the Oblitercons sat idly in the \nmess hall, \n&gt; each receiving the transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Dark One and the rest of the Oblitercons here in the Alliance base \nhanging \n&gt; out in the messhall.
