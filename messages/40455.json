However, there was a faction a long time ago in \nthis RPG called the Energonians. They were energy beings much like \nyours, just they used energon energy instead of chaotican, and Zardus \nhad a long rivalry with their leader (who happened to be one of the \nbots that helped Zardus and Wolfgang make the Alliance), so he knows \nhow to handle energy beings.\n&gt; \n&gt; And the guy who controls Mustex: how&#39;d Mustex get onto Alliance \nIsland? The shields were up.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/FZ/DevilDuer/Mosquitor::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus frowns, thinking Frostbite&#39;s transmission over for a second \nand then replying. &quot;I would preffer meeting in neutral territory. \nWould the peninsula near my base be convenient for you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He closes that link, and recieves Orchestra&#39;s transmission. &quot;This \nis Zardus, Alliance commander. I&#39;ll lower the shields so that you can \nget through. I&#39;ll be outside, we can meet there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He walks toward the exit, looking at his wrist comp and tapping a \nfew buttons, making a search for &quot;Infecticons&quot;. The search yields no \nmatches. Zardus traces the Infecticon transmissions back to their \norigin, then makes a search for any bots that the Iron Fist&#39;s \nscanners detected traveling in that direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Interesting...&quot; he says to himself, watching video footage of \nVampiza flying over Alliance Island, surrounded by Chaotican energy. \nHe zooms in, looking the bot over.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uncanny resembalance to Energonians, he thinks to himself, \nactivating his comm to Daemos: &quot;Daemos, can you report to my position \nas soon as possible? I need you to accompany me somewhere.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus ends that transmission as well, exiting the base and seeing \na bot firing. He frowns, tapping a few buttons to turn the autoguns \noff, and begin lowering the shields.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re either very brave or very stupid,&quot; he says, approaching the \nshields on the other side of which was Chaostaur (whatever his name \nis). &quot;Attacking a military installation single-handedly is a very \nsuicidal task.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; FZ nods, looking over the beasts once more.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes. I must admit I wasn&#39;t expecting you to accomplish this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns and walks toward the exit, the door opening. &quot;Would you \nlike a shuttle to get back to wherever you are from, or would you \nrather fly by yourself?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer waits for Coput to get into the pilot seat, so that they \ncan get going and he can get away from these weirdos. :-)\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Mosquitor is hit by Hurricane&#39;s shots (post 38120. Sorry for taking \nso long to reply), stumbling a bit.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Traitor! Hell Beast will have your head!&quot; he yells and lunges at \nHurricane again, swinging a large insect leg at him.\n\n\n"}}
