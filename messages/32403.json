She\nstood up and \n&gt; stretched.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Where am I?&quot; She said to herself as she looked around the forest.\nThe last \n&gt; thing she remembered was being put in a pod and sent off. Animals\nmade noise \n&gt; around her, making her uncomfortable. She was not a social robot, so\nbeing \n&gt; around alot of beings usually made her uncomfortable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Antagony looked down at herself and saw that she was a dark purple,\nwith \n&gt; skin-tight armor plates attached onto her body. Her armor did a good\njob at \n&gt; showing off her curves. She couldn&#39;t tell exactly what she looked\nlike since \n&gt; she didn&#39;t have a mirror, but what she saw was good. She looked up\nto see if \n&gt; anyone was coming.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
