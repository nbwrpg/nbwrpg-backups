Although its quarry had \nescaped the energy storm&#39;s wrath, Rogue Star had not.  Now most of \nits crew was in a comatose state, and repairs were sorely needed.  \nAfter examining the situation, the conscious Rogues chose to land on \nthe most suitable landmass - the large northern continent.  And so \nthe Rogue Star, hidden under its powerful cloaking device, began to \ndescend ...\n\nMeanwhile, in the storage room that doubled as her sleeping quarters, \nanother transformer was busy moping.  There wasn&#39;t much else to do.  \nA prisoner by another name, Phoenix hated the Rogues and all that \nthey stood for, but was too terrified to do anything about it.  She&#39;d \nbeen conditioned over the course of nine stellar cycles to cower away \nfrom them.\n\nNot to mention, she hated violence in any form even more than she \ndespised her captors.  Phoenix had no idea where her strong beliefs \ncame from, but she knew it had to have something to do with the \nmemory engrams the Rogues had destroyed before her eyes, in the \nearliest event she could recall clearly.\n\n\n"}}
