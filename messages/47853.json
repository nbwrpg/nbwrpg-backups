It felt kinda wierd \nentering it when he wasn&#39;t damaged. After exiting he was in the body \nof a large seagull. He went to robot mode sence he couldn&#39;t walk to \nfast on the ground in that mode. While looking along at the damaged \ncraft he made his way to the bridge then waited for further orders.\n\n\n"}}
