Early humans have next to no \ncomprehension of their own anatomy. If Denzabar here was programmed \nto think he&#39;s human, there&#39;s little hope that he understands why he&#39;s \ndifferent, and even less to make him understand now and here who he \nis. However, if he can act as our representative to the human clans \nof the region, that would help us. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Gimliyotoden@a... wrote:\n&gt; The Caveman stared with a dazed look on his face.
