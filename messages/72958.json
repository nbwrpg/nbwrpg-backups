However there =\r\nwas\n&gt; another faction that could not be forgotten - UNICRON. His minions ha=\r\nd\n&gt; been left here either on the EARTH or on its moon. Whether MAGMATRON\n&gt; =\r\nand his cohorts were part of this UNICRON faction or working for\n&gt; themselv=\r\nes was still unknown.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; DINOBOT glanced over to CRYOTEK then as he hea=\r\nrd the sounds coming from down\n&gt; &gt; the tunnel.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe time for intr=\r\nospetion and meta-awareness and contemplation had ended now as the tunnel c=\r\nollapse raced after the PREDAONS and MAXIMALS in full force as they tried t=\r\no trample and run over one naother!\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson turns to Leo.  He narr=\r\nows a brow in concentration as they move deeper\n&gt; &gt; into the tunnel.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot; Maybe not a clone, but perhaps an illusion brought on by Magmatron or h=\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; minions.  The rumor itself....  That could be an illusion to turn us=\r\n against\n&gt; &gt; ourselves so that way our efforts would diminish to the point =\r\nof surrender.\n&gt; &gt; DAMMIT WHY DIDN&#39;T I CATCH THAT SOONER!  &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He stop=\r\ns short, digging his claws into the ground as he swings his body\n&gt; &gt; around=\r\n and stares angrily at the darkness of the tunnels.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; MAGMATRON!  I=\r\nF ITS A FIGHT YOU WANT TAKE IT UP WITH ME AND LEAVE MY\n&gt; &gt; COMRADES OUT OF =\r\nIT!  I DARE YOU!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As TUSCON&#39;s voice echoed down the tunnels=\r\n that is when the PREDACONS\n&gt; came bowling over the MAXIMALS in an effort t=\r\no escape!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The PREDACONS seemed to have the lead in thi=\r\nngs now, having taken the first\n&gt; &gt; moments to race ahead into the tunenls =\r\nas sounds of crumbling rock filled\n&gt; &gt; after them, trying to shove their wa=\r\ny up to the front of the ongoing\n&gt; &gt; collapse!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What followed was al=\r\nmost like a clip of the Junkeon inspired Benny Hill show\n&gt; &gt; as they all fe=\r\nll over one another to get ahead!\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If the PREDACONS were see=\r\nking to get ahead, the MAXIMALS were doing\n&gt; much the same thing as behind =\r\nthem the walls rumbled and the entire\n&gt; tunnel shook as everyone continued =\r\nrunning down through a long and\n&gt; twisted path.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally with a large c=\r\nrash that shook the tunnel the ceiling fell\n&gt; along with tons of rocks and =\r\nearth, totally sealing the passage behind\n&gt; the MAXIMALS and PREDACONS.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t like this.&quot; LEO PRIME said as he stood up in the darkness,\n&gt; &quot;It=\r\n is like we are being herded.\n&gt; \n&gt; WING CALIBER nodded, &quot;The question is to=\r\n where, and for what purpose?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As the dust cleared it was obvious that=\r\n the path was sealed behind\n&gt; them for almost the entire length of it. If t=\r\nhey were going to get out\n&gt; the only way was to dig through tons of earth a=\r\nnd rock or continue\n&gt; down the path.\n&gt; \n&gt; TORCA, the MAXIMAL FUZOR commande=\r\nr looked around, temporally locking\n&gt; gazes with SKYSHADOW his PREDACON cou=\r\nnterpart as various MAXIMALS and\n&gt; PREDACONS began to shine lights to illum=\r\ninate the tunnel.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; TORCA said, &quot;But for the moment it w=\r\nould seem that we\n&gt; can only go further in.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Interestingly, further do=\r\nwn the tunnel there was some sort of\n&gt; flickering light. It was very dim, b=\r\nut it was like fire light or\n&gt; energy of some sort.\n&gt; \n&gt; From the dimness o=\r\nf this light it was obviously still some distance away.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe PREDACO=\r\nNS, at least some of them, seemed to not care WHERE Tehy were going, or tha=\r\nt they were being HERDED, moreso that they just avoided going down over lik=\r\ne WASPINATOR!\n\nMeanwhile, up above the ground, there was a TREMOR in the AL=\r\nLSPARK.\n\nWASPINATOR went, still flying around and puttering, his mandibles =\r\ndeep voer in a rather juicy, sugary fruit of which he had found and eaten d=\r\nozens of, &quot;Wazzpinator not know verre everytone izz..
