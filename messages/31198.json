He opened his\n&gt; mind to\n&gt; &gt; return his thoughts to her. &quot;I&#39;m alright Wing that monstrosity\n&gt; didn&#39;t do\n&gt; &gt; anything to me that a little time in beast mode didn&#39;t handle.&quot; He\n&gt; still had\n&gt; &gt; a crick in his back, probably from landing wrong when Megaton had\n&gt; hit him.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;How about we try to slip out of here before the Maximals start\n&gt; asking\n&gt; &gt; questions we don&#39;t want to answer?&quot; He thought feeling ill at ease\n&gt; about the\n&gt; &gt; facts Megaton had blurted out about Veratis. Lunarpine owed him a\n&gt; dept that\n&gt; &gt; he wasn&#39;t wanting to explain to anyone, he fealt in his spark that\n&gt; it was\n&gt; &gt; his best option, it was his ONLY option.\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 27, 2001 11:24 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Ice\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She woke up in the CR tank and the images she had been projecting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stopped.  She opened the door and stepped out.  Something didn&#39;t\n&gt; make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sence to her. If she just got out of the CR unit, then why&#39;d she\n&gt; feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so tired.  She looked around and transformed into griffin mode.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Standing on all fours, she stretched her wings. Her shoulder felt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; great, her wounds were nicely healed, but she had a few new scars\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; proudly wear.  She opened up her mind to Lunarpine. &quot;How are you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling? Have you had your turn in the CR yet?&quot; Then she\n&gt; remembered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his remark about her wieght. She smirked and chuckled to herself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She thought to herself, I&#39;ll get him for that one, he&#39;ll never\n&gt; see it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coming.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Despite it all, she cared for Lunarpine with all her spark. If she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; let anything happen to him, she&#39;d rip her spark out and give it to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Veratis on an energon platter.  It was her love for him that kept\n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alive while her spark sat in a jar in Veratis&#39; lab. And she wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going to give him up now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
