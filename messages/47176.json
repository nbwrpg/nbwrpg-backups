Or am I keeping order, and trying to stop mass ooC\n&gt; posts? Clearly moderating the next person who made an offending post\n&gt; worked for the moment. Since you have an email address (obviously),\n&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure you are capable of emailing privately, and thus\n&gt; not &quot;be an ass&quot; over the group. =)\n&gt;\n&gt; The council has long threatened to moderate people for posting too\n&gt; many OOC&#39;s. We chose not to do that because it disrupts the flow of\n&gt; the RPG. We&#39;ve been patient and lenient, but something needs to be\n&gt; done. And something was done. You are entitled to your opinion, but\n&gt; generally speaking, why should we listen to you? You rarely post,\n&gt; and when you have posted, they were ooC&#39;s. In fact, only TWO POSTS\n&gt; of your last SEVENTEEN were IC. I&#39;d say that you are no more helping\n&gt; the problem than Narrator was. Although I regret what I did,\n&gt; necessity brings action.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, as I mentioned, you have a private email and so do I. So, if\n&gt; you wish to discuss whether what I did was correct or incorrect\n&gt; email me. And DON&#39;T email the group. That&#39;s what the messageboard on\n&gt; the website is for.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; &lt;1641coburn@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC:  Really, rauq, you don&#39;t need to try and show off and be\n&gt; Mr.&quot;I&#39;m a\n&gt; &gt; council member so I have to be an ass&quot; over the group.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
