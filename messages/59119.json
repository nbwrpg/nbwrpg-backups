She sighed and felt her \ntemper rising.  She went outside through the ripped out back half of \nthe ship.  She looked around at the forest that she had crashed in.  \nShe heard a noise in the forest, coming towards her.  She transformed \ninto fire lizard.  She stood only 6 feet tall, wing span of 15 feet.  \nPlasma fire breath and lazars in the optics.  Her skin was a shiney \nemerald green.  The horns on her head gave her a crowned look.  She \nlooked around at what was coming her way.  It was a strange looking \nanimal that broke through the woods. She saw a small brown animal, \nwith two floppy antennas sticking out of it&#39;s head. A small ball of \nfluff at one end, and a twitchy nose on the front side. It jumped and \nhopped around the bottom of the forest. It stopped, looked at her, \nthen disappeared under the bushes. \n\nShe sighed and lowered her dragon head. &quot;Well, perhaps I&#39;ll find life \nforms that aren&#39;t so afraid of me.&quot;  She went back inside the ship, \nand layed down in fire lizard form.  Her head rested on her paws.  \nShe glanced up towards the sky and hoped she would see something that \nwould mean there was life out there. However, with her energy levels \nspent, she fell asleep. \n\n\n"}}
