It \nreared up, swung its leg that KitKat was on, and launched her across the \nsection.\n\nRowdy Wolf fired his rifle at the wolf-bot. He heard the shot ricochet \ninside of its shoulder. It turned its head to Rowdy Wolf, with two beady red \neyes glaring at him. He froze for a second, then came to again. &quot;Get out of \nhere! Go!&quot; He waved his arm in the air. &quot;Slag it, run!&quot; he shouted a the \nothers. He fired again, onto the Metal Beast&#39;s leg as he stomped towards \nhim.\n\nTerrorsaur didn&#39;t seem like he was going to stay. He paced in mid-air, \ntrying to study the Vok creation. He flew over top of Stingtra&#39;s head. He \nflew down and slashed at the wires that connected to Quickstrike&#39;s head.\n\n&quot;Blow the cavern!&quot; he shouted. He flew to the side and turned his shoulder \ncannons at the wall of the cavern. He fired multile times.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
