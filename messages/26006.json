Well - distressing to me \nanyway. (LOL) Tomorrow, I&#39;m going in for an operation that&#39;ll last \nabout an hour.. I think. ^_^\n\nSooo I&#39;m probably not gonna be on the computer tomorrow, or maybe the \nnext day, I&#39;m not sure. It all depends if I&#39;m stubborn enough, or \njust going into withdrawl on the Internet. *grin* \n\nEither that or I&#39;ll be so crabby with this big bandage round my head \nthat I won&#39;t want to talk to anyone anyway.. \n\nCarnage, feel free to act Teltoli as you see fit.. ^_^\n\nOkay... so wish me luck on the operation, and hopefully I&#39;ll be able \nto talk to you soon! :)\n\n\nSteph F.
