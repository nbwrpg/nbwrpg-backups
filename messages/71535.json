It was all about speed, precision, balance, \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; discipline, grace, and of course effectiveness.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; He could see pot=\r\nential in her and turns his head in both Nightlight and \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Bumps directio=\r\nn.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; Bump&#39;s right, that&#39;s somethn&#39; ya gotta learn, but I see a lot=\r\nta potential \n&gt;&gt;&gt; for train&#39;n ya as a Ninjabot. You got the right moves, mo=\r\ndy, and grace, and \n&gt;&gt;&gt; once you&#39;re trained, there&#39;s gonna be no stopp&#39;n yo=\r\nu Nightlight. Master \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yokitron once said, that a student often shows po=\r\ntential even if they don&#39;t      \n&gt;&gt;&gt; realize it themselves. Now, that&#39;s tot=\r\nally up to you if ya want the \n&gt;&gt;&gt; training, just see me after we get repai=\r\nred, and I&#39;ll set up a training \n&gt;&gt;&gt; program for ya. Hmm, maybe Rodimus mig=\r\nht wanna join in on it too.. It&#39;s a \n&gt;&gt;&gt; perfect opportunity for both of yo=\r\nu ta get some extra training under your \n&gt;&gt;&gt; belts.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; He positions =\r\nhimself again.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; It would really help both of you out a lot, see&#39;n=\r\n what Hydras managed ta \n&gt;&gt;&gt; pull on ya in the past. The reason why it didn=\r\n&#39;t work on Tucson or me, is \n&gt;&gt;&gt; that Master Yokitron&#39;s training sorta prep=\r\nared us spiritually for what could \n&gt;&gt;&gt; come down the pike. Clear minds emp=\r\nty of thoughts are less likely ta get \n&gt;&gt;&gt; infected by negative influences,=\r\n simply because there&#39;s no thought energy ta \n&gt;&gt;&gt; hold onto. Clear mind, cl=\r\near soul, clear spark. Bad stuff just goes in one \n&gt;&gt;&gt; way, and out the oth=\r\ner. You guys had a lot on your minds when Hydras took \n&gt;&gt;&gt; you. And that co=\r\nuldn&#39;t be helped, but now it can be. I bet my spark plugs \n&gt;&gt;&gt; that if you =\r\nand Rodimus train with me, I can get both of ya up ta our level \n&gt;&gt;&gt; and th=\r\nat&#39;ll make you a pair of the strongest Autobots this side of the \n&gt;&gt;&gt; galax=\r\ny, but not the type of strength most warriors perceive. This type of \n&gt;&gt;&gt; s=\r\ntrength is the strength of spirit, inner peace, and harmony. A perfect \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n balance between spark, soul, and mind. And yeah, there&#39;s a lotta dexterity=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt; aquired in Ninjabot training, the type of dexterity that makes even T=\r\nucson \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Prime a bit different then the traditional Autobot Commander. It=\r\n&#39;s a \n&gt;&gt;&gt; difference Hydras has no inclination how ta fend off. THAT&#39;S the =\r\ndirection \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Tucson is gonna take, and if you guys were trained in our ar=\r\nt, so more power \n&gt;&gt;&gt; to ya.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; He then looks to Bump, as the repair=\r\n bench does its job to repair the \n&gt;&gt;&gt; internal damages done to him.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Speakn&#39; of performance, that reminds me...

It was all \n    about speed, precision, balance, =\r\n&lt;br&gt;discipline, grace, and of course \n    effectiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He could se=\r\ne potential in her and turns his head in \n    both Nightlight and &lt;br&gt;Bumps=\r\n direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; Bump&#39;s right, that&#39;s \n    somethn&#39; ya gotta learn, but=\r\n I see a lotta potential &lt;br&gt;for train&#39;n ya as a \n    Ninjabot. You got the=\r\n right moves, mody, and grace, and &lt;br&gt;once you&#39;re \n    trained, there&#39;s go=\r\nnna be no stopp&#39;n you Nightlight. Master &lt;br&gt;Yokitron \n    once said, that =\r\na student often shows potential even if they don&#39;t \n    &lt;br&gt;realize it them=\r\nselves. Now, that&#39;s totally up to you if ya want the \n    &lt;br&gt;training, jus=\r\nt see me after we get repaired, and I&#39;ll set up a training \n    &lt;br&gt;program=\r\n for ya. Hmm, maybe Rodimus might wanna join in on it too.. It&#39;s \n    a &lt;br=\r\n&gt;perfect opportunity for both of you ta get some extra training under \n    =\r\nyour &lt;br&gt;belts.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He positions himself again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; It would reall=\r\ny \n    help both of you out a lot, see&#39;n what Hydras managed ta &lt;br&gt;pull on=\r\n ya in \n    the past. The reason why it didn&#39;t work on Tucson or me, is &lt;br=\r\n&gt;that Master \n    Yokitron&#39;s training sorta prepared us spiritually for wha=\r\nt could &lt;br&gt;come \n    down the pike. Clear minds empty of thoughts are less=\r\n likely ta get \n    &lt;br&gt;infected by negative influences, simply because the=\r\nre&#39;s no thought \n    energy ta &lt;br&gt;hold onto. Clear mind, clear soul, clear=\r\n spark. Bad stuff just \n    goes in one &lt;br&gt;way, and out the other. You guy=\r\ns had a lot on your minds \n    when Hydras took &lt;br&gt;you. And that couldn&#39;t =\r\nbe helped, but now it can be. I \n    bet my spark plugs &lt;br&gt;that if you and=\r\n Rodimus train with me, I can get both \n    of ya up ta our level &lt;br&gt;and t=\r\nhat&#39;ll make you a pair of the strongest \n    Autobots this side of the &lt;br&gt;=\r\ngalaxy, but not the type of strength most \n    warriors perceive. This type=\r\n of &lt;br&gt;strength is the strength of spirit, \n    inner peace, and harmony. =\r\nA perfect &lt;br&gt;balance between spark, soul, and \n    mind. And yeah, there&#39;s=\r\n a lotta dexterity &lt;br&gt;aquired in Ninjabot training, \n    the type of dexte=\r\nrity that makes even Tucson &lt;br&gt;Prime a bit different then \n    the traditi=\r\nonal Autobot Commander. It&#39;s a &lt;br&gt;difference Hydras has no \n    inclinatio=\r\nn how ta fend off. THAT&#39;S the direction &lt;br&gt;Tucson is gonna take, \n    and =\r\nif you guys were trained in our art, so more power &lt;br&gt;to ya.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He \n =\r\n   then looks to Bump, as the repair bench does its job to repair the \n    =\r\n&lt;br&gt;internal damages done to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; Speakn&#39; of performance, that \n  =\r\n  reminds me... I need new hydraulic shock &lt;br&gt;absorbers, timing belt, and =\r\nI \n    know my struts need work, new tires, body &lt;br&gt;work, and Ty Rods fixe=\r\nd. Oh \n    yeah, need a new front and back end alignment &lt;br&gt;too.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T=\r\no repair the \n    damgages to his alt form, he now transforms into his vehi=\r\ncle &lt;br&gt;mode, to \n    prepare for the rest of his repairs. He also notices =\r\na busted &lt;br&gt;headlight \n    on the left side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Scrap, throw in a new=\r\n headlight for the left side, \n    new bumpers, front, &lt;br&gt;back, side, and =\r\nawww slag, transmission&#39;s actn&#39; up. \n    Probably because I &lt;br&gt;smacked tha=\r\nt tree real hard in alt form.
