He now stood 15 \nfeet\n&gt; tall. The body was a suped up version of his old one. The Maximal on\n&gt; board computer had been taken out. A old Autobot transformation cog \nhad\n&gt; been installed. His weapons were now useing lasers instead of plasma\n&gt; charges. He had mini rockets installed in launchers on his back. \nAnd the\n&gt; Maximal symbol on his chest was gone. In its place the symbol he \nwore\n&gt; for so many years... the Autobot one.\n&gt; Hot Rod was once again an Autobot.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I have included a pic of his new look.\n\n\n"}}
