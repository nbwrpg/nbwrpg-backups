He almost exclaims in triumph as the\n&gt; monitoring systems in the room activate, clearly showing Unitron,\n&gt; Firestarter, Sixshot, Ares, Serpentor, Double Punch, Injector,\n&gt; Manterror, and Bumblebee and playing back whatever they were saying.\n&gt; Zardus doubted that the bots would notice that the monitoring systems\n&gt; were back online, so he simply sat back, listening. No one was going\n&gt; to keep anything from him in his own base.\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus leans forward and taps a few keys.
