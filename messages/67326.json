You ignored the fire from the turrets on the front\n&gt; gate\n&gt; (which is facing toward the ocean, away from the city where the\n&gt; battle is\n&gt; happening) and from Guardia who is in the small bunker beside the\n&gt; gate\n&gt; behind a thick metal half-wall.  (fire can come out of the shield,\n&gt; but not\n&gt; vice versa).\n\nOOC: Actually as I said they are just firing from above, and not from\nthe front, and they are hitting the shielding I thought. Perhaps I miss\nworded. But I can ajust it if so. However I did miss the person leaving\nthe gates - I&#39;m not always paying the proper attention - sorry. It is\nobvious to anyone in the base that the Sweeps are not trying to get in,\nonly to keep the base &#39;covered&#39;.
