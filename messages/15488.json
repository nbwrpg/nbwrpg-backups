I have a \n&gt; plan.&quot;  She smiled and whispered into his ear,&quot;we have the opertunity \n&gt; to destroy from within.  They will be bringing back two bots from the \n&gt; field, badly wounded.  We could program them to serve Zardus and \n&gt; cause chaos from within.&quot;  She kissed his cheek and smiled as they \n&gt; walked. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Skulletron::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Skulletron grinned.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        &quot;I&#39;ve already seen every area of the ship, but I haven&#39;t \n&gt; been to\n&gt; &gt; them.  I have access to all of the Cybertronian Fire.  I also have \n&gt; knowledge\n&gt; &gt; of the bot&#39;s names.  In fact, right now, I could incinerate all the \n&gt; Maximals\n&gt; &gt; here by changing the autogun settings, if I felt like it.  But, \n&gt; there&#39;s no\n&gt; &gt; need for anyone to die on this mission.  Here, we&#39;ll tour the ship \n&gt; together,\n&gt; &gt; and I&#39;ll try to patch some information back to the Alliance base, \n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; Zardus.
