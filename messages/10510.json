Each got into one, grumbling about not getting to rip out any \nMaximal sparks from their dirty Maximal bodies.\n\n----\n\nDark One flipped out of his CR chamber, landing on the ground evenly on both \nmechanical feet.  Stretching, he yelled out.  \n\nUsing his internal scanning equipment to pinpoint an energy-signature, Dark \nOne walked for a few cycles, seeing a large door to a room.  Letting the door \nslide open as his motion was detected, Dark One walked in.\n\nSeeing Feline all over Zardus, Dark One smiled.  &quot;Oh, you&#39;re busy.  Well, \nI&#39;ll talk now, not later.&quot;\n\nWalking over to Zardus, Dark One pushed at Feline hard, attempting to knock \nher back.\n\n&quot;Requesting orders.&quot;\n\n"}}
