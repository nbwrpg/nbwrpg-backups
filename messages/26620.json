In reality her paw only moved a few \ninches or so along the ground, but the small sound stopped and \nTeltoli relaxed.\n\nFiguring that she was now awake, she sighed and cracked open one eye \nto see the dawn coming up, and groaned even louder in dissapointment. \nIt was only the beginnings of dawn! The Fuzor then opened both eyes \nand assumed that she was to get up then. The few minutes earlier had \nbeen done on pure instinct.\n\nShe slowly sat up, fluffing her wings up from where they had been \ncrushed against the ground. The Fuzor looked around and saw that \nCarnage was no where to be seen.\n\nScanning around the forest, her scanners picked up that Carnage was \nsomewhere near, merely sitting. Teltoli lowered her brows in \nconfusion, but shrugged and looked around at the scenery.\n\nEverything looked.. fresher, if that was possible. Morning dew \nglistened from the rays of light that were just beginning to come up, \nmist travelling slowly across the ground with oh-so-slight winds. A \nsmile crept across her face. Definatly better than Cybertron mornings.\n\nLooking up to see a rather tall tree beside her, under which the boar \nhad been buried, she grinned and unsheathed her claws. Part of her \nform was a panther, and they were natural tree climbers! Putting one \npaw on the wood, she felt her sharp claws dig in and gain a grip, so \nshe quickly climbed up the tree, using all four paws. Getting up to \nthe lowest, but sturdiest branch, she lay down in typical panther \nfashion and let her wings hang down. \n\nTeltoli looked in the direction that her scanners said Carnage was, \nand wondered if her friend was getting ready for the training, or \ndeciding what she would do. She grinned a little and started to relax \nher own mind, almost a form of meditaton, but still alert.\n\n\n"}}
