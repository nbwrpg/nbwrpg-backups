It was \nvery apperant that something was bugging him and he wasn&#39;t going to \nsay anything about it now.  She let go of his hand and transformed \ninto eagle mode and flew up. She was about 20 feet in the air and \nstayed at that hieght.  She gave and eagle cry and circled \nDollen, &quot;When you want to talk, I&#39;ll be here.&quot;  She then flew slowly \ntowards the base were KitKat was gathering the others. She flew so \nshe would be just ahead of Dollen, but slow enough that he could keep \nup.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (Okay, sorry about moding with Skulletron, it&#39;s just that I am \ntotally PISSED at something..............Personal matters........And, \nhere&#39;s a reply to Gotron and Starscream)\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Skulletron::\n&gt; \n&gt;          Skulletron starts to walk around the Maximal base, ready \nfor anybody who wanted to take him on.

I have no \ntime to waste talking about this right now!&quot; He said.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Dollen had never been this angry before.
