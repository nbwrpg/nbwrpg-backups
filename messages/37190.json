No \namtter how great a warrior he was, that fusion cannon did it&#39;s \njob. &quot;I respect your wishes&quot; deciding to leave of master to show his \ndisaproval. The shots hit him in the side again forcing him to step \nback. Small hole smoked then began to leak Mech-fluid, &quot;But&quot; he \ngrowled, &quot;i want whatever is rest of this tin can.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megatron leapt out of the way of the rocket. &quot;Come now my dear\n&gt; Firestrike. I apreaciate your servitude as the next leader. You are\n&gt; hardly a Junkyard dog, I see much potential in you, to even take my\n&gt; place at some time, and you are a soldier, who deserves to rule.&quot; He\n&gt; then turned his voice to a more serious tone. &quot;But this is a fight I\n&gt; must take, by myself. Do not interfere.&quot; On his last sentence, \nMegatron\n&gt; added an edge to his voice, to prove how serious he was.\n&gt; \n&gt; He then turned to Unitron, &quot;You however, have no future out of \nbeing my\n&gt; personal throne.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
