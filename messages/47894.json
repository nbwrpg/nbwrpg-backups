The\n&gt; voice sounded much like Sunhawks&#39; but with the communications \nsystem rather\n&gt; fritzy he couldn&#39;t hear the complete message. Tapping the wall \ncommunicator\n&gt; he messaged the bridge, &quot;Talos here, how is repairs coming on the\n&gt; communications systems up there, try and get the incoming signal \nfrom\n&gt; Sunhawk cleared up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Shutting down both comms he went back to work helping to make \nthe mess\n&gt; hall a place to relax, after todays events he was sure the crew \nwould need\n&gt; some down time.
