If we can not=\r\n reach them, then we might have to resort to other measures.&quot;\n\nIn another r=\r\noom, Straight Shot could hear that Tucson had calmed down somewhat.  She si=\r\nghs in relief, as does Quickstride.\n\n&quot;That was close.  I&#39;m glad we weren&#39;t =\r\nin the same room with him.&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks over to her.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve known =\r\nhim for a long time, how bad can he get?&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to him, whil=\r\ne cuddling Elita.\n\n&quot; Let&#39;s just say that Legacy was really lucky he didn&#39;t =\r\ndecide to throw a punch at him.  One time, Tucson got into a real ugly figh=\r\nt with a rookie Decepticon and he literally beat the guy up into scrap meta=\r\nl. He took a few dents but nothing major..  But the look on his face, no on=\r\ne not even a fellow Autobot would dare insult him after witnessing what he =\r\nhad done.  But he&#39;s never laid a hand on an Autobot, which actually has sto=\r\npped him from doing the same to Legacy.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds.\n\n&quot;He came clos=\r\ne this time.  I&#39;d hate ta be on the receiving end of those fists.&quot;\n\nStraigh=\r\nt Shot peers into the room where Rodimus sits with Nightlight.\n\n&quot; Before Ro=\r\ndimus snapped out of that dark phase of his, I don&#39;t think Tucson would hav=\r\ne hesitated to smash him to smitherines also, if he couldn&#39;t find a way to =\r\nhelp him. I&#39;m glad he held it together and brought Rodimus back safely.&quot;\n\nQ=\r\nuickstride listens on.\n\n&quot; So that&#39;s why you really stick close ta the big g=\r\nuy.  If he didn&#39;t have you ta even out his temper, Primus knows what he&#39;d b=\r\ne capable of.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot; It&#39;s his weakness, he&#39;s got the sho=\r\nrtest temper of any Autobot, asside from Ratchet, who was well known for hi=\r\ns short fuse.  You could&#39;ve sworn those guys were related in some way.  Act=\r\nually, Tucson did intern with him for a while, and was the only Autobot who=\r\n actually got along nicely with the old Medic.  When he was a rookie, he wa=\r\ns always willing to learn, and he always followed Ratchet&#39;s instructions to=\r\n the letter, before he got his optic sensors damaged of course.&quot;\n\nQuickstri=\r\nde shifts positions on a chair.\n\n&quot;Wow, he actually worked with Cybertron&#39;s =\r\nfinest Medic.  That&#39;s impressive.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot; He interned wit=\r\nh him for a while, to aquire some mechanical training.  And at the same tim=\r\ne, he trained with Master Yokitron and also did field work with Hound on oc=\r\ncasion.  He wanted to learn as much as he could, and he did.  He learned a =\r\nlot of skills.  He also took up mechanics with Wheel Jack and did rather we=\r\nll there too.  That&#39;s where he aquired his restoration skills, which was to=\r\n him his all time favorite past time.  I think he really misses those days,=\r\n where he got to learn so much from everyone.  But the one thing he never g=\r\not to do, was to learn the wisdom that Optimus Prime was most legendary for=\r\n.  I think that&#39;s what&#39;s bothering him the most Quickstride.&quot;\n\nWithout furt=\r\nher word, Tucson quietly walks over to the body of Optimus Prime, and just =\r\nstands beside him.  It would appear that Straight Shot was right.  He had l=\r\nearned so much, but missed the opportunity to learn the wisdom he feared he=\r\n was missing.  He kneels in front of the sleeping Autobot Commander.\n\n&quot; Onc=\r\ne again I almost made a costly mistake.  I learned so much from my comrades=\r\n and I&#39;m grateful for the knowledge they&#39;ve given me, but still, Optimus, I=\r\n wish I could have learned your wisdom.  I could really use it now.  So muc=\r\nh happening at once and I don&#39;t know where to begin doing something about i=\r\nt.  I should know these things by now, that&#39;s why I was given the power of =\r\nleadership.  I can&#39;t let them down, not this time.  My comrades have seen e=\r\nnough grief, they don&#39;t need any more of it.  Now I wish we did have time t=\r\no work together, one on one.  That way I would be prepared for what comes n=\r\next.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor::\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor looked at tucson and said coldy &quot;that&#39;=\r\ns a strategy that we cannot \n&gt; afford, but&quot;he added with another tone&quot;We ca=\r\nn ask to pacificus Maximals to \n&gt; join us... and fuse both factions, that w=\r\nill give us enough streght to face \n&gt; hydras and whoever dares to challenge=\r\n us...

He did not like his tone of voice, a=\r\nnd \n&gt; felt that his explanation could have been a little less brash.  Espec=\r\nially \n&gt; when you&#39;re addressing a Prime officer.

He&#39;s \n&gt; like Ratchet, but kind of thre=\r\ne times worse.  If he wants ta turn a bot inta \n&gt; scrap metal, he&#39;ll do it.=\r\n  It&#39;s happened before..  Umm, maybe I shouldn&#39;t - \n&gt; have mentioned that h=\r\nuh?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstride now hears Tucson raising his voice, and looks up to h=\r\nim.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Uh ohh..  Something tells me we better take cover.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It was a=\r\npparent in the clenching of his fists, that Tucson was quite ready \n&gt; to de=\r\nfend his arguements in any means possible.  It was what he did when he \n&gt; o=\r\nften lost his temper.  Straight Shot takes the brave step to try and calm \n=\r\n&gt; him down.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey, maybe you guys can work something out?  You&#39;re right=\r\n, we do need help \n&gt; but Legacy&#39;s right too.  It might upset the time balan=\r\nce if we attempt ta \n&gt; wake up the Ark too soon.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson turns to her.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Remember what Master Yokitron told us vorns ago?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She nodds.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;Yes, sometimes the unthinkable must be the thinkable.  It was his way =\r\nof \n&gt; saying that in desperate times, desperate measures can not be avoided=\r\n.

We need help, and maybe it isn&#39;t time to wake up Optimus Prime,=\r\n \n&gt; but we must try and revive others to assist us in battle.
