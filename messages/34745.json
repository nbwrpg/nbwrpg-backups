This wasnt eh Iron Raptor he had seen over the\nvideo screen, and he knew the Matrix was at work. How many times must it\nmeddle in their affairs, he then had a look of shock on his face as the\nlightning closed around him, and shrunk into him. He quickly fired a\nblast of his raw fusion energy downwards, and the crossfire hit,\nemmiting a large light of energy as the two forces met. Then it cleared,\nand Megatron was left floating there, covering his face, smoke lifting\noff of his body. \n\nAs his arms moved away to reveal his face, it had a grimace on it of\npure anger. He landed on the ground a few meters away from this new\nPrime. He pointed accusingly, &quot;YOU, you are pathetic for challenging me.\nMegatron DOES NOT YIELD TO KNOW ONE&quot; he screamed, his rage apparent.\n&quot;HOW DARE YOU. I AM OLDER THAN YOUR CREATOR, I AM MEGATRON. Do you have\nany idea how many holders of the matrix I have crushed in my 20 million\nyear life time? DO YOU&quot; he screamed, furious at the audacity of this\nrookie Prime. &quot;HOW DARE YOU&quot;\n\n"}}
