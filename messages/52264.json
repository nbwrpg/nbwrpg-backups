She stalks out of the \nroom \n&gt; and down the hall, coming to a stop only when she reaches the main \n&gt; entry hatch, where the other Rogues - except Riekan and Jayde - \nhave \n&gt; already gathered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those two soon show up as well, Jayde having to jog a little to \nkeep \n&gt; up with Riekan&#39;s much longer strides.  Devilcat smiles as he sees \nthe \n&gt; group fully assembled.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Rogue leader quickly outlines his plan. &quot;Here&#39;s the bit.  \nTorin, \n&gt; you and Jayde keep an eye on the ship - and our &#39;guest&#39;.&quot;  Jayde \n&gt; pouts at being left behind; Devilcat ignores it and continues \n&gt; on.  &quot;If you want, you can work on those jammer beacons.  In the \n&gt; meantime, things are coming to a head at the Predacon base.  \nHydras \n&gt; has asked for support in his much-anticipated clash with the \nMaximals \n&gt; and their allies; I don&#39;t intend to disappoint him.  Gatara, Fury, \n&gt; Noir, Riekan, it&#39;s time to cloak and fly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that, the fuzor leads his war-party outside and to the air.  \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Cloaking in transit is pretty much standard procedure for the \n&gt; Rogues.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: It&#39;s okay\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: This means I&#39;m not invited, right?
