First this bot drops by and says that he\nhas to protect Teltoli, then these other two bots come along and a shoot out\nbreaks out, then they all disappear! This either had a good plan behind it\nor it was all very stupid!\n&gt; She looked at the smooth surface of the lake as it reflected her image\nback to her, what had just happened was very strange. She shrugged, but life\nwent on.\n&gt; Carnage turned to Teltoli but didn&#39;t say anything, she also looked Tritan\nover for strength...sizeing him up.\n&gt; She growled, for some reason she just didn&#39;t seem to like him. He was an\nAlliance member for one thing and frankly that was all she needed, she\ndidn&#39;t give a nano if he said that he wasn&#39;t like the others the fact still\nremained.\n&gt; Carnage crossed her arms and looked over at Teltoli, she gave her a look\nthat mainly said that words were words and nothing more, don&#39;t trust\neverybot!*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
