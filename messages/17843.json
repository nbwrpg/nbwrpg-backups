Striker attacked Ramulus?&quot;  She looked at them both and then \nat the floor. She put her hands to her head,&quot;What happened? Why can&#39;t \nI remember?&quot; \nShe shook her head and felt a surge go trhough her programs. The \ntrainer program had taken over the maximal program temporarily. The \nsurge made her tremble slightly as a side affect of the surge. \n\nShe looked up at Smokescreen.  &quot;I think I remember now. Yeah, the \ntrainers did do something to Striker.  He was chipped and taken to \nthe lab. But, I can&#39;t remember much before or after that.&quot; her \ntrainer side wanted to guide them in a direction that would throw \nthem off as far as trying to help Slayer. She started to smile when \nthe surge hit again and her maximal program took over again. The \nsurge hit her and she trembled slightly.\n\nShe shook her head and held her hand up to the side of her head. Her \nmaximal side wasn&#39;t aware of what her Trainer side did.\nShe looked up at Firearm and Smokescreen. She stood up and looked at \nthem. &quot;Uh, well, how can I help out? You said that Ramulus as hurt? \nLet&#39;s get him to a CR before he gets injured any further.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Smokescreen/Firearm::\n&gt; \n&gt; Smokescreen shruggs. &quot;I have no idea further than the fact that you \n&gt; were taken over. But I&#39;m also curious about Striker...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Smokescreen looks at Firearm questioningly. Firearm raises an \n&gt; eyebrow, looking at the two bots.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t know much either. He flew into the battlefield, \nnearly \n&gt; killed Ramulus, made a big mess of the ground with a dozen or so \n&gt; missiles, killed a Maximal warrior, called himself Slayer, and flew \n&gt; off with the rest of the Trainers. Other than that, I&#39;m as clueless \n&gt; as you guys.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
