Oh before he gets up, think you could blast the rock that&#39;s over him for=\r\n me?  If ya get what I&#39;m getting at.&quot;\n\nShe points to a large structure of r=\r\nock that&#39;s over the cave.\n\nMeanwhile, Quickstride was getting tired of the =\r\nSharkitcons and gets into robot mode bearing his over the shoulder blast ca=\r\nnnon.\n\n&quot; Okay, that&#39;s it, it&#39;s fish frying time!  Heads up Rattrap!&quot;\n\nRattr=\r\nap quickly scoots out of Quickstrides way.\n\n&quot; FIRE IN THE HOLE!&quot;\n\nQuickstri=\r\nde now attempts to take out a large group of Sharkticons with a shot from t=\r\nhe blast cannon.\n\nTucson concentrates and remains focused as he continues t=\r\no match Magmatrons moves simply to defend himself against his onslaught.  H=\r\ne knew his sword was not big as Magmatrons nor was it made to handle its po=\r\nwer.  Knowing that, he opts not to use the sword.    Narrowing a brow in th=\r\nought he quickly goes from robot to beast mode, landing on his hind feet an=\r\nd using his front legs as arms and hands.     \n\nThe sword may not have the =\r\nstrength nor the size but he knew his tail could be strong and long enough =\r\nof a weapon for him.  With surprising grace he whirls the tail masterfully =\r\ninto a coil and slaps at Magmatrons sword to attempt a tail block by slappi=\r\nng it with the side of the skinnier part of his long tail with a forceful s=\r\nwipe.  His long neck coils back like that of a serpent ready to strike.  Ye=\r\nt he remains calm without any explosive temperamental outbursts.\n\n&quot; A worth=\r\ny opponent indeed.  But can you face me in  your own beast mode as I am fac=\r\ning you in mine?  You seem attached to your robot mode, Magmatron, is there=\r\n something you&#39;re not telling me, about your level of expertise?  Or is it =\r\nthat because you are contrived of a mixture of creatures that are not known=\r\n for combative agility?  As you can well imagine, a dragon faces similar we=\r\naknesses.  And you may ask yourself why would a dragon take on a posture th=\r\nat would expose him to injury?  Or is it that the dragon may have learned t=\r\no adapt to such weaknesses?  Now I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a very charismatic individ=\r\nual but, are you witty enough to step outside the box?  Let&#39;s see if you ar=\r\ne.  Come on then, I&#39;m sure a beast of your caliber can make short work of a=\r\n smaller mountain dragon.  Show me what you&#39;re really made of, transform, a=\r\nnd face me in your beast mode!  I dare you to do the unusual!&quot;\nLocal artist=\r\n who specializes in illustration, using traditional and digital media.  \n\nI=\r\n also specialize in hand made crafts.

While doing so he\n&gt;&gt; soars over the larger warrior wi=\r\nth great agility.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; MAGMATRON laughed, =E2=80=9CAhh yes, you =\r\nare full of all the platitudes of\n&gt; your mentor!=E2=80=9D He slapped away t=\r\nhe stalactite with his blade sending\n&gt; the pointed piece of rock spinning t=\r\nhrough the air and then crashing\n&gt; to the side falling to the ground in pie=\r\nces.\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=9CBut don=E2=80=99t you see I have size AND cunning!=E2=80=\r\n=99 He laughed again as he\n&gt; leaped into the air, matching TUSCON flip for =\r\nflip and landing on the\n&gt; ground next to him and again slashing out with hi=\r\ns sword, this time in\n&gt; a far more expert manner!\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Nightl=\r\night mad an effort to move but she fell more exausted. she didnt know\n&gt;&gt; ho=\r\nw longer she could resist without fell in stasis, she feared that because\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; she didnt have a chance to get out of her enemies hands.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; night=\r\nlight made a quick movement and tunr off the cover diver that disguide\n&gt;&gt; h=\r\ner signature, now any alli could have the chance to track her if Saberback\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; takes her prisioner\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; At the moment no one is paying much =\r\nattention to NIGHTLIGHT as\n&gt; everyone around her is apparently engaged in c=\r\nombat!

Firing his hea=\r\nvy tail cannon at\n&gt;&gt; them, trying to use their numbers agaisnt them!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n All the while, wondering if SKYBYTE was acting as their field general, or\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; there was something amiss here and something he was misreading, but for =\r\nnow\n&gt;&gt; focused on thinning the herd!\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The =E2=80=98herd=E2=\r\n=80=99 was indeed continuing to thin as the SHARKTICONS fought to\n&gt; swirl b=\r\nack in the direction of SKYBYTE, who at the moment did appear\n&gt; to be orche=\r\nstrating events. The blasts from DINOBOT were eating into\n&gt; their numbers a=\r\ns more and more of them were falling to the ground; But\n&gt; not only from his=\r\n blasts but also from the MAXIMAL FUZORS as they also\n&gt; leapt into the fray=\r\n, teeth, claw and talon slicing into the\n&gt; SHARKTICONS as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the=\r\n middle of all of this SKYBYTE stood smiling now as he watched\n&gt; the battle=\r\n progress. Several SHARKTICONS landed next to him acting as\n&gt; a set of body=\r\nguards. Lifting up his arms he directed others to\n&gt; continue their attacks =\r\nagainst DINOBOT and the others as well.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Of course, VICE =\r\nGRIP went down over in the huge pile.  His superior strength\n&gt;&gt; and skill w=\r\ner eonly good..  To a point.  As the huge pile went on top of\n&gt;&gt; him, his h=\r\neavy armor was dented, rended, stirpped away as the PREDACON\n&gt;&gt; WARRIOR tri=\r\ned to smash, split, bash, blast, and blitz his way up through the\n&gt;&gt; pile, =\r\nbut he seemed to be piled even deeper now.\n&gt; \n&gt; There looked to be a small =\r\nstorm over VICE GRIP as they piled. There\n&gt; was confusion over him as the S=\r\nHARKTICONS were falling into a frenzy\n&gt; of sorts! Teeth and powerful jaws w=\r\nere gnashing at him as they\n&gt; attempted to rend his armor plates from his c=\r\nhassis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile at the dead center of the room was the pit over whic=\r\nh the\n&gt; still silent form of OPTIMUS PRIME still hung by chains that stretc=\r\nhed\n&gt; high over head and fastened to the ceiling of the chamber somewhere.\n=\r\n&gt; The pit itself was perhaps 40 feet wide traversed by a small yet\n&gt; sturdy=\r\n stone bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time DARK RODIMUS and RODIMUS had fought th=\r\neir way onto\n&gt; the bridge, both of them looking banged up, their armor pitt=\r\ned,\n&gt; dented, scratched and blasted. Yet neither of them seemed to notice i=\r\nt\n&gt; as they pummeled at each other!\n&gt; \n&gt; Beneath the bridge smoke began to =\r\nrise as red, yellow and orange\n&gt; flames licked their way up out of the pit =\r\nthemselves and began to\n&gt; dance beneath it.\n&gt; \n&gt; From a few meters away SAB=\r\nERBACK paused in his conflict with\n&gt; STRAIGHTSHOT and more recently TORCA a=\r\ns if he felt something. He\n&gt; glanced over at OPTIMUS PRIME, =E2=80=9CNO!=E2=\r\n=80=9D He said. =E2=80=9CIt cannot be!=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; Hanging from the chain=\r\ns, his body now black and seared, OPTIMUS\n&gt; PRIME=E2=80=99s optics flickere=\r\nd once and then came back on line.
