Megatron looked up into the beasts face.\n&quot;Fight on Skullgrin, destroy these metal mongrels.&quot;  Then the water\npressure also streamed into him, (but I think it would hit Prowl as\nwell, cause you are on me, it might even protect me, so i will let you\npost first robo)\n\nRumble had no idea of the Autobot rushing him, and the heavy impact sent\na creak through his armor as he yellped in pain. He lay twitching for a\nmoment underneath the protectobot, then slowly tried to grab his pistol\nwhich was a few feet away from him.\n\nSoundwave also had no idea of the attack from the Protectobots, luckily\nBlade let him know what was happening, as his finely tuned sound\nreceiving devices picked up Blade&#39;s taunts before hand, he flew out of\nthe way, into the sky, and looked down. He pushed a button on his\nshoulder, which caused an invisible jamming wave to emminate. (This will\njam any radio communications within the battlefield, other then to him)\nbut as soon as he hit the button, Alpha&#39;s firepower suprised him,\nknocking him out of the sky.\n\nSpasstik saw Soundwave blasted, and in mid air quickly changed his\ncoarse, landing on the ground gracefully, now lunging towards Alpha\nDolphey. He hissed in rage, and opened his maw, letting loose a sonic\nhowl, blasting the high frequency sound wave at the Maximal.\n\n"}}
