He couldn&#39;t breed? He didn&#39;t know that, but then his TM2 \nbody was fairly new. Listening to the part about Dinobot, he thinks \nback to the rescue mission he and Dinobot launched to get Iron Raptor \nand Tavatron back from the Alliance. He catches Iron Raptor&#39;s look \nafter Iris asks for his opinion, getting the point and keeping his \nmouth shut.\n\nProwl snaps his head toward Iris at her next statement, an irrational \nwave of jealousy passing through him. Dinobot catching Iron Raptor&#39;s \neye? For a second his mind denies the fact that Iris had said that, \nbut hers and Iron Raptor&#39;s exchange after that confirmed Iris&#39; \nstatement. Iron Raptor was in fact looking up info on Dinobot.\n\nBut so what, Prowl thinks, As Iron Raptor said, she looked up info on \nthe bots under her command. But Prowl somehow didn&#39;t think she looked \nup info on Ramulus or Striker or the other Maximals as well. Iris had \nsaid that Iron Raptor and Dinobot were the same species, perhaps Iron \nRaptor did have an eye for Dinobot after all.\n\nIt would make sence. Prowl didn&#39;t remember Dinobot ever crashing \nthrough several trees and nearly killing himself in the proccess. He \nknew that he probably wouldn&#39;t stand a chance against Dinobot in a \nfight, either. But he hoped Iron Raptor had fallen in love with him \nfor Prowl himself, not for his abilities, or physical appearance.\n\nHe returns Iron Raptor&#39;s amused look with one not amused at all, \ntrying to keep all the emotions surging through him out of his \nappearance, but not completely succeding. Suddenly, the thought of \nDinobot being captured back on that rescue mission didn&#39;t look too \nbad. Prowl tore his mind away from the thought, but then found \nhimself thinking of what Iron Raptor might have replied if Iris had \nbeen allowed to finish her last statement.\n\n&quot;Ok,&quot; he says as he pushes the thoughts out of his head, trying to \nkeep his voice cheerful and failing miserably, &quot;Lets get this spark \nmerge done and over with.&quot;\n\nHis systems were searching through his datatracks to see how to \naccomplish the procedure Iris had explained with the greatest \nproficiency.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
