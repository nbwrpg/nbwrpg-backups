She \n&gt; had to admit if nothing else that he was rather a unique creature, \nlooking \n&gt; as if he had scanned every animal, fish, insect, and bird on the \nplanet when \n&gt; he had landed.\n&gt; But even if he was not quite praportioned right, he was still a \nrather nice \n&gt; bot none the less.\n&gt; She smiles as he answeres her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; That is good. I was not sure whether or not that salve would work \non a bot \n&gt; with as much power as you. I have only used it on myself before.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *Zyber lay back down onto her stomach as she watched Blaster look \ninto the \n&gt; fire and then turn his eyes back at her, though watching every one \nof his \n&gt; moves.\n&gt; She was way to trustworthy, she knew that. And she trusted \nsometimes when it \n&gt; could be the worst thing for her.\n&gt; But she simply nodded as he thanked her for saving his life, but \nthen looked \n&gt; at him point blank when he asked for her to fill in more \ninformation for her \n&gt; on tis planet.\n&gt; However, that was information with which she could give.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; There is a bit.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Through her scouting and such she had come to know quite a bit, \nbut why \n&gt; this Blaster would want to know was beyond her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; There is a new Maximal ship, the Cybertronian Fire. Which is \nlocated in \n&gt; the plains of Africa.\n&gt; There is a new leader for the Predacons.\n&gt; Other then that there are other battles but nothing too seriouse.\n&gt; Iron Raptor is leading the Maximals.\n&gt; The winds are changing and the herds are moving south, leaving \nalmost no \n&gt; food in the north here.\n&gt; The enire planet is changing in fact, climate, sea level. But \nnothing out of \n&gt; the ordinery.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Zyber then stretched again and yawned a bit.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Is there anything specific you would like to know?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
