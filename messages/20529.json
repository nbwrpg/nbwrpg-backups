No, they would assuredly have someone to work on \nthe computer, it wouldn&#39;t happen, but just to make sure, Deemos could \noffer one of his computer workers, it could do nothing but help.\n\nCut to Serge, finally digging up the battered and bruised Grenade and \nKracken, and called Deemos. Deemos sent coordinates through commlink \nto Serge and Serge started to travel, heading in the direction they \nwere traveling almost, that way he could get to the Alliance base \neven as it moves, he takes Grenade, Kracken, unconcious and also \nBeholder&#39;s pieces, and heads to the Alliance base...\n\n\n"}}
