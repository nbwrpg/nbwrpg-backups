She then looks to Lord Elder and the\n&gt; others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Yeah I miss the old Perceptor too, we were just getting ta know him when\n&gt; everything went South.  Tucson and I would often run errands between\n&gt; Ratchet, Wheeljack and then Perceptor too.  So one day we delivered an item\n&gt; to him and we got really curious about the work he was doing.  It just so\n&gt; happened to be a similar project that Tucson was working on restoring but\n&gt; was missing some intel on it.  It was an old Cybertronian star chart and he\n&gt; immediately identified the intel Perceptor had on it.  Perceptor was so\n&gt; excited when Tucson ran back to him with the artifact, and that&#39;s when our\n&gt; friendship came about.  And then Perceptor started teaching us a lot of\n&gt; interesting facts and problem solving techniques.  One of them being how ta\n&gt; solve a puzzle using a scientific process of elimination. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap grins with enthusiasm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I love that stuff!  Okay so let&#39;s see, Unicronian, strategic, strong,\n&gt; dictator.  If not Unicron than someone who is kinda second in line.   Okay I\n&gt; know I paid attention in history class and, the only mug I know who fits all\n&gt; those categories is...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot gasps, and covers her mouth.  The answer hitting her over the\n&gt; head quite hard.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Oh scrap.  I studied history too, and I know who you might think it is. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They both look to Lord Elder and at the same time..\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; MAGMATRON.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap swallows hard.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Sir I really hope we&#39;re wrong about this.  Because if he came back, we are\n&gt; so in deep slag.   But everything about the way things are going really\n&gt; points in that direction.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to the sky and then back to Lord Elder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Master Yokitron said that one day the ultimate challenge would come, and\n&gt; we would be ready ta face it.  When the will and determination of friends\n&gt; and comrades joins forces against an impossible foe, thunder would sound and\n&gt; lightning will be seen in the skies above.  And Magma will harden to the\n&gt; might of the rain that follows in thunder&#39;s wake.  Guys, I think this is\n&gt; that time.  We are the storm and together we can do this .  Tucson is\n&gt; probably out there already, fighting the battle of his life in the name of\n&gt; freedom.  We can&#39;t let him do it alone.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a soft and good natured chuckle from LORD ELDER, &quot;Don&#39;t jump\nfoward too fast. If you think back to your studies Magmatron had an\ninterest in the Angolmois energy, which is derived from Unicron, but\nbeing a servant of Unicron himself?&quot; ELDER shook his head, &quot;No I can&#39;t\nsee that.&quot;\n\n&quot;That would be a most astute supposition.&quot; LEGACY said as he entered\nthe chamber, his single optic seeming to scan the room as much as look\naround.\n\nAnyone looking at LEGACY might notice that he, like many of the\nMaximals of late, had undergone some changes of his own. While he had\nnot grown any taller, he did seem more massive, the spread of his\nshoulders being wider and broader. He looked somehting like SHOCKWAVE,\nbut from his back there reached coiled tentacles which he could use to\nmanipulate objects as well as his hands. His right hand still ended in\na massive cannon mount, one that was, at the moment, powered down as\nhe was among friends.\n\nOOC: New Legacy:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/54620451/pic/2146411075/view\n\nLEGACY turned to examine each person in the room before returning his\npowerful gaze to STRAIGHTSHOT and LORD ELDER, &quot;The energies that I\nhave examined from the reports is not pure Unicronian energy but\nenergy derived from a similar source.\n\nNOTE: When I give historical &#39;facts&#39; they are as historical as our\ncharacters are aware of them. When I have a character give an opinion,\nit is just that, an answer based on their limited knowledge. I just\nthought I would point that out. Please do not assume that opinions are\n100% true, since there are things that these characters do not know.\nAlthough characters Like Legacy are right MOST of the time :)\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
