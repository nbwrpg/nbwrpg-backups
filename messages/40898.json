Darkwing finally stood awakening from his dark \n&gt; slumber, looking around and seeing Firestrike staring right back at \n&gt; him.  Darkwing took a step back towards Dreadwind, as Firestrike \n&gt; pulled out his sword.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;AAAHH GO!&quot;  Darkwing cried out as he jumped into the air \n&gt; transforming into his jet mode, as DReadwind followed in suit.  The \n&gt; two combined making a super jet, and blasting off at incredible \n&gt; speeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Havotron and the rest of D.E.D flew forward as the screaming jet \n&gt; whipped past them.  &quot;What the slag&quot; Havotron said.  &quot;Dreadwing, \n&gt; get over here&quot; he yelled.\n&gt; \n&gt; The jet pulled at fast turn coming back to Havotron, not saying a \n&gt; word.  As the group arrived at where the Dark Avian used to be, \n&gt; Havotron landed, followed by Dreadwind and Darkwing, now \n&gt; seperated, Needlenose, and Scrapper, and hopefully the rest of the \n&gt; D.E.D members.\n&gt; \n&gt; When he landed he looked around, seeing a few select \n&gt; Decepticons, but no base.  &quot;What is this Deception, future \n&gt; followers of the Great Havotron.&quot; he yelled out.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Firestrike stepped forward.  &quot;What do you mean, what Deception, \n&gt; oh great Havotron&quot; he said very mockingly.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Where is Megatron&quot; Havotron replied pointing his unfiltered-energy \n&gt; cannon at FireStrike.  Not recieving a reply fast enough a blast of \n&gt; pure , dangerous energy, blasted out of the cannon nailing \n&gt; FireStrike, sending him flying at the ground, hundred of meters \n&gt; away, once again, awakeining the other side of FireStrike.  &quot;Stupid \n&gt; Megatron, once again he sends us out to get killed while he runs.  \n&gt; But I will win, and show the others that my leadership qualities are \n&gt; better then the Megatron ancient styles&quot;\n\n\n"}}
