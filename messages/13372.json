A sweeping probe \nshows great potential for organic life on the planet.\n\nThe three sections take a direct course for the planet, staying in a \nperfect triangular formation. A voice from the right front asks &quot;Are \nyou sure you want this planet father?&quot;\n\nFrom the larger rear piece a voice is heard to reply &quot;Yes daughter \nthis planet will be the perfect place for my experiments.&quot;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
