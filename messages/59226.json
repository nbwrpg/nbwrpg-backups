Reluctantly, he \ndecided to warn his Master.\n\nBloodblade: Master Unicron, Rockseeeker and Lunekill have just been \nterminated.\n\nThe response was immediate and terrible. He was attacked both in his \nbody and in his spark, even though his Lord was at the other end of \nthe system. Tendrils of electricity shook him, causing interferences \nthat could be picked up from Earth.\n\nIn the middle of his agony, he heard a thundrous voice inside his \nhead.\n\nUnicron: Incompetent Minions! They have failed me. Now, Bloodblade, \nit is your turn to go, but I have learned from this.\n\nWhen the pain stopped, he had forgotten who he was or who he served. \nHe only remembered his name. He started spinning wildly as he entered \nhigh orbit and was attracted to the ground.\n\nA few minutes later, he crashed loudly into the ground, exactly at \nthe same distance from the three bases.\n\n\n"}}
