Spare diodes and servos where placed on\nshelves along the wall on one side, while on the other was a large\ncomputer work station that looked as if it had been cobbled together.\nPart of it had cables that were running to the CR chamber in the room.\n\nTARANTULUS cackled to himself as the timer on the CR chamber was\nfinishing its count down and then finally beeped indicating it was\n&#39;done&#39;. With a deft movement he pressed a button on a nearby console\nand the door of the chamber hissed and clicked and slowly began to\nopen.\n\n&quot;Awaken my sweet.&quot; TARANTULUS said as he waited for the result. &quot;Return to me.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
