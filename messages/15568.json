She realed around and \nclawed at Blaze again.\n\n::Spears:;\nShe ducked and looket at Tamron.  She grabbed the side of her neck as \nthe chip hit her. She shook and realed around.  She transformed into \nbot mode and screamed. She fell to her knees and tried to fight the \nprogramming, but to no avail.  She stood up and looked at Tamron.  \nHer body shook slightly as she still tried to fight the program, but \nshe was now under the Trainers control. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; When Prebon attempted to throw Spears into the way of the missles, \n&gt; Quills shot all over his body. This was luck however, because this \n&gt; caused him to fall down and the missles to zoom over his body and \n&gt; explode away. The removed most of the quills from his face, however \n&gt; painfully, and stared down Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Not a good thing to do. Now you are going to have a terrbile fate. \n&gt; Trainers! Become Tamron!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignatius, Hammer and Bullet left there battle and ran over to \nPrebon. \n&gt; Blaze hissed at Snow Cat as she clawed at her, but was able to sink \n&gt; her teeth into Snow Cat&#39;s shoulder. She withdrew and went over to \nthe \n&gt; others.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now,&quot; said Prebon, &quot;You shall be with us forever!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Trainers started to merge, to become one. When it was all over, \n&gt; they were the great Tamron! They pulled out their great weapon, \nTamer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I have seen pictures of you in Savage&#39;s memories,&quot; said \nTamron, &quot;So \n&gt; I suppose you wondered how we go thim under control. It&#39;s simple. \n&gt; Using this baby right here, we implanted a micro chip in him. Once \nit \n&gt; hits the surface, it auto-matically takes effect, making him a \nslave. \n&gt; Now yo probably think I&#39;m dumb for telling you all about this \n&gt; machine. It doesn&#39;t matter. You will now be one of us!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tamron shot a micro chip at Spears.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois lead Child into a small, way off room, where he sat him down \n&gt; on a rock beside him. He put his hands on his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Close your eyes, Child. You are now going to experience more joy \nand \n&gt; power than most people can ever dream of.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois began channeling energy into Child.\n\n\n"}}
