They were now flying over the shore and \nit was time that she relieved the bot of her heavy load, she looked down at \nthe sand and sighed...she let go.\nCarnage absorbed the impact of her drop with the muscles of her legs and \ntail, she then looked back up at the flying Fuzor...big drop!\nShe sighed and looked at the ground beneath her feet, it was a wonderful \nsight!\nCarnage then looked back towards the swimming clone and sighed again...*\n\n&quot; Come on, we only have a few clicks to cover before we reach the Maximals.&quot;\n\n* It was then that she continued her journey to get Teltoli to a home that \nshe could be somewhat safe in.\nCarnage snarled, and soon after that she would have to track down Megs and \nkill him, but that one question continued to bother her...what would she do \nafter that?*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
