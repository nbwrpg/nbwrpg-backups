I simply want to be on good terms.&quot; He said smilling a broad\nelequant smile. &quot;And I wanted to give you the best greeting I could.&quot; as he\nfinished this sentence, he carefully and slowly moved towards a button on\nhis computer. He pressed it, sending the signal to Autofire. &quot;You&#39;ve\nalready met Motormaster&quot; he said pointing to the grim looking Stunticon\ncomander, &quot;I simply wish you to meet some more of my soldiers. Please, show\nthem the same kind of courtious, I showed you.&quot; he with a highly sarcastic\ntone.\n\n\n\n"}}
