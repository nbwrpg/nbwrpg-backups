It is your job to escort \n&gt; the clone on a recon mission which vectors nearest to the Maximal \n&gt; base. I&#39;m sure their sensors will pick you up. It will be your job \n&gt; to make sure the clone gets into their hands safely, and I don&#39;t \n&gt; mean just hand it to them. Make it real, trick them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh, and one more thing.&quot; Hydras&#39;s hand slides into his arm and a \n&gt; spiked semi-sphere forms around his hand - Hydras Fusion Cannon - \n&gt; and points it at the new but old Predacon.
