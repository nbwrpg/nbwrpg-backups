I\n&gt; have suspected something like that when I=\r\n found pod.&quot; He was talking\n&gt; about ANTAGONY. &quot;She had a temporal signature=\r\n unlike anything I have\n&gt; ever detected.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So that means that you beli=\r\neve me?&quot; TARANTULUS said as he regained\n&gt; some of his composure.\n&gt; \n&gt; There=\r\n was a dark smile from CRYOTEK, &quot;Of course I do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Then we can get loo=\r\nking for . . &quot; ANTAGONY said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; . . .

The move over was a classic Metallikido char=\r\nge, his long blade arm up and over his head then for a powerful downward sw=\r\ning.\n\nBut, the swing would be a decoy, intent on drawing ANTAGONY&#39;s guard u=\r\npwards, where the true blow would land - in this case, a powerful forward k=\r\nick!\n\nAnd if she was moving to dodge the kick then or would try and evade t=\r\no the side, then power would change over to the sweep of the clawed tail-sw=\r\nord to use it&#39;s superior range and buzzsaw properties to lash out at her wh=\r\nile she was on the defensive!\n\nAs well as with a slight backup motion now w=\r\nhere if he was engaged in grappling her at close range or she would try and=\r\n match him strength for strength of trying to shoot his otpic blasts into h=\r\ner face!\n\n\n"}}
