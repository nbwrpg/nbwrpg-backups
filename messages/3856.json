A shadow passes \nover him as Zardus walks up behind him. Ramulus spins around, looking up at \nthe Alliance leader.\n\n&quot;Your fellow maximals are not following the treaty, maximal,&quot; Zardus says, \npointing to the battle between Dark One, Hiss, and the Maximals.\n\nRamulus looks at where Zardus was pointing. He nods, &quot;Let&#39;s go resolve it.&quot;\n\nThe two bots walk up to the scirmish.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAnnihilator opens his optics, looking as Zardus and Ramulus make their way to \nDark One, Hiss, and the maximals. He takes out a rifle, aiming it carefully.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Maximals, stand down,&quot; Ramulus says at the same time Zardus orders the \nAlliance troops to hold their fire, &quot;We are allied with the Alliance.&quot;\n\nA shot from Annihilator sends Ramulus flying forward, a sparking hole in his \nback. Reacting instantly, Zardus turns, opening fire with his automatic on \nAnnihilator.\n\nScreaming as many shots dig into his chest, Annihilator flies backwards into \na boulder, going unconscious.\n\nZardus holds his finger on the trigges even after Annihilator faints, \nriddling the newcomer&#39;s body with holes.\n\n&quot;I weev thelf, juko.&quot; Annihilator says into his comm-link, mech fluid flowing \nfrom his mouth as his systems go into stasis lock.\n\nZardus turns back to the group, still holding his gun dangeroustly.\n\n&quot;Now,&quot; he says as Ramulus stands up, using the wall of the Ark for support, \n&quot;We are trying to help you fight off these newcomers. It would be apreciated \nif you wouldn&#39;t fire on us.&quot;\n\n"}}
