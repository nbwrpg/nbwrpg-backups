Something went wrong with Stallex&#39;s protoform turning him \ninto a baby transformer. This may seem like a bad break, but the \ndevelopment period is making him quit powerful. Mustex secretly \nimplanted a copy of his datatracks into Stallex that will surface \nwhen Stallex finds out his father died. This way if Stallex likes \ntheir minds can merge (in Stallex&#39;s body) increasing his \nintellegence, and power(like with optimal optimace except they will \nbecome one spark instead of 2). \n\n\n"}}
