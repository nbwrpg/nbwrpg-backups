With very little visual data and a short path of left=\r\n over destruction, Tucson asses his situation and his options.  He knew if =\r\nhe remained in beast form maneuvering in this jungle would be next to near =\r\nimpossible, especially the way his wings functioned while airborne.  There =\r\nwas just no room for large wingspans.  Plus landing on all fours would furt=\r\nher upset the forest floor and the creatures that resided there.  The prese=\r\nnce of a dragon would send the creatures off in a panic.  Out of considerat=\r\nion for the animals he hovers in mid air while...\n\n&quot; TUCSON MAXIMIZE!&quot;\n\nIn =\r\nmid air he transforms into his robot mode and decides to use his skills in =\r\ndexterity and acrobatics, to get to the ground without upsetting anything o=\r\nr anyone.   \n\nWings fold tightly into his aerodynamic, cylindrical body as =\r\nhe now positions himself in a perfect, vertical dive with arms stretched ou=\r\nt in front of him.  He makes an impressive free fall dive maneuver and grac=\r\nefully makes his descent to the ground below.  \n\nAs he nears a large tree, =\r\nhis outstretched arms allow him to catch a giant branch with both hands as =\r\nhe swings off it like a skilled gymnast .  After a spin or two, to build hi=\r\ns momentum, he vaults to a lower branch and continues to do so until he fin=\r\nally touches down for a flawless landing as he uses his arms for balance.  =\r\nLeaf litter falls in his wake as he first looks around to get his bearings.=\r\n  \n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Aug 29, 2011, at 4:37=\r\n PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; The JUNGLE as every=\r\none pretty much called it was huge! Thousands of\n&gt; acres all around with tr=\r\nees reaching up over one hundred feet into the\n&gt; air like tall green spires=\r\n reaching ever higher into the skies,\n&gt; supported by thick powerful trunks =\r\nand supporting power of the\n&gt; neighboring trees.\n&gt; \n&gt; At first travel was e=\r\nasy as WHEELIE followed a trail of devastation\n&gt; and deforestation. It was =\r\nas if a stampede of hundreds of large\n&gt; animals fled the jungle, crashing i=\r\nnto trees and stripping foliage as\n&gt; they traveled. The result of which was=\r\n a wide open and relatively\n&gt; smooth open path of travel several miles into=\r\n the immense wooded area.\n&gt; But as time passed and the miles built upon the=\r\nmselves the impact of\n&gt; the animal&#39;s passing become less and less noticeabl=\r\ne, the area itself\n&gt; becoming ever darker from the trees high over head and=\r\n the thick\n&gt; growth of brush. The ground was becoming more and more uneven =\r\nas tree\n&gt; roots grew into the pathway. What was once a brightly lit area wa=\r\ns now\n&gt; much darker, looking like deep evening, even though the noonday sun=\r\n\n&gt; burned brightly over head, blocked by thge lush canopy of trees, that\n&gt; =\r\nonly occasionally let in shafts of sunlight light to break open the\n&gt; growi=\r\nng darkness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even the smell of things was beginning to change. The ear=\r\nth smell of\n&gt; decomposing leaves and animal waste could be smelled. Not nec=\r\nessarily\n&gt; a bad smell, but one that reminded you of the richness of the so=\r\nil\n&gt; that was being moved across.\n&gt; \n&gt; WHEELIE employing all the skills and=\r\n experience at his disposal was\n&gt; able to make his way in through the uneve=\r\nn and sometimes broken\n&gt; ground, the jungle floor was perhaps among the mos=\r\nt inhospitable to\n&gt; wheeled vehicles that most of the Earth at this time ha=\r\nd to offer.\n&gt; Lattice works of roots and foliage got caught in tires, the b=\r\nrush\n&gt; having the annoying habit of blocking sight and hiding nasty ravines=\r\n\n&gt; and holes and twisted turns. Branches and roots jutted out at strange\n&gt; =\r\nangles threatening to stab into more sensative and vulnerable\n&gt; undersides =\r\nand tires.\n&gt; \n&gt; The sounds of the jungle was all around WHEELIE, animals ch=\r\nattered at\n&gt; him from the ground, as others hanging high in the trees looke=\r\nd down\n&gt; at the strange orange conveyance that dared travel through demesne=\r\n.\n&gt; There were signs of life all around him - The catcalls of other\n&gt; anima=\r\nls, even a few roars in the distance of large predatory beasts.\n&gt; Trees and=\r\n branches moved strangely as if something indiscernible was\n&gt; moving among =\r\nthem even if the author of the movement could not itself\n&gt; be readily seen.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Then there was the eerie feeling of being watched. It was a feeling\n&gt;=\r\n that settled upon someone slowly at first. Perhaps a sound that didn=E2=80=\r\n=99t\n&gt; repeat itself or a movement than stopped when you did. Maybe it was\n=\r\n&gt; just a gut feeling that somewhere out in the density of the foliage,\n&gt; in=\r\n the darkest shadows something was out there, and it was peering at\n&gt; you, =\r\nconsidering you.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was into this maze of tree and wood, sounds and sm=\r\nells that WHEELIE\n&gt; was driving, covered in muck and weaving past trees tha=\r\nt were as large\n&gt; around as he was long. And yet despite all of that, there=\r\n was a\n&gt; strange sort of barely discernable path that led further and furth=\r\ner\n&gt; into the jungle interior, meandering at times and yet always present.\n=\r\n&gt; .\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: For anyone that wants to fly in, you will find that you canno=\r\nt\n&gt; see the jungle floor, at least the section that Wheelie is in. You can\n=\r\n&gt; see the devastation that he followed in, but after a few miles it\n&gt; fades=\r\n and the jungle growth takes over. Any smells or sounds he would\n&gt; give off=\r\n would be muffled by the dense foliage and the ambient sounds\n&gt; and smells =\r\nof the jungle. In short he would be nearly impossible to\n&gt; find anyone on t=\r\nhe forest floor from the air unless you find one of\n&gt; the infrequent cleari=\r\nngs. If you need a more aerial description of the\n&gt; place I can describe th=\r\nat in a different post.
