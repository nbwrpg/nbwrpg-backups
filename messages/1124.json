With she ran off down the hallway and into the battle. The first enemy she sees is ZARDUS, so she runs a few quick paces and fires 3 shots of a flamethrower in quick succesion, aimed at his chest*\n\n-----------\n\n*Kit looks outraged as Sinester runs from her, shouting after him in a mocking voice* &quot;Coward!! I&#39;ll get you later!&quot;\n\n*She transformed back into otter mode, and swam the lake, coming to shore. With a quick shake she dried herself off and pricked her ears up. She heard battle sounds, and a slow grin crossed over her face*\n\n*Kit transformed into robot mode and held out a lethal looking gun. And with that she raced closer to the fight (at the Ark)*\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
