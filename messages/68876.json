But this is no normal storm, \nbut one of =\r\ndarkness and fear and power.\n\nAt the ark Lord Elder struggled desperately t=\r\no get the ark ready for \nthe coming wave, as the forces from Hydras&#39; base -=\r\n who only hours \nbefore were fighting amongst themselves - have now joined =\r\nforces in a \ndesperate gamut to protect the ark, their past and their futur=\r\ne.\n\nMeanwhile the dark specters of destruction have grown from the tiny \nmo=\r\ntes on the edge of the horizon to shades of fury that bore down on \nthe see=\r\nmingly defenseless ark. Like huge misshapen hornets from some \ndark and ang=\r\nry hive, the great host of minions close in as weapons \nbegan to charge, th=\r\ne collective wine of it the harbinger of the \ndestruction to come. \n\nSomewh=\r\nere inside the dark mass, their king and commander ordered the \nchaos that =\r\nswarmed through the air, his powerful sensors sweeping \nahead of them, sear=\r\nching for someone he has yet to find! Nightrazor, \nNightstrike and Darkfate=\r\n closed in to the ranks as well, falling in \nbehind Cyclonus, Tumult and De=\r\ncibel, even as in the distance Scourge \nwas quickly falling into his place.=\r\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the horizon and closing fast are the hodgepodge \nalliance o=\r\nf the Maximals and Decepticons, Autobots and Decepticons as \nthey fought fo=\r\nr every ounce of speed to keep up with the advancing \nminions!\n\nYet at the =\r\nark, standing like some lone sentinel, Legacy in his tank \nmode stood facin=\r\ng the initial onslaught of the minions. With a \nstalwart resolution his shi=\r\neld absorbed the initial blasts as he \nbraced the opening foray, buying pre=\r\ncious seconds for the valiant \nMaximals who sought to reactivate the ark&#39;s =\r\ndefenses and the enduring \nfighters who closed in from their flight from th=\r\ne black fortress!\n\nThe war of the Ark had begun, woe to those caught in its=\r\n wake!\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n"}}
