It lay \nthere while she tried a new connection to it&#39;s optics.  She went \nthrough the optic connections from where she was up through the \ncentral brain stem and routed through the cranial connections to the \noptics.  This time, it started to work.  She could see, like looking \nthrough extremely blurry bionoculars.  She found the small connection \nto the vocal box inside the protoform&#39;s throat.  She tried to make it \nspeak, but only a few squeeks and some hushed  muttering came out.  \nIt was going to take time to get the voice to work, but she had \nnothing but time on her hands as far as she was concerned.\n\n\n"}}
