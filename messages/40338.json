I decided to speed things along a bit with the \nsentencing so I brought in the hologram sim thing blacky would have \nhad to fight if she chose the bamphomet choice. So shes now going to \nhave to fight a simulated version of the guy undersized.\n\nBlight burst out in laughter as Shivas threat was recieved. He held \nhis stomach as he pounded his fist on the console in front of him and \nthen looked back up.\n\nBlight: &quot;oh? You were serious. Well come and get Darkfate and your \nwretched little blacknightmare you fool! You will never get to even \nset foot into this facility! I dare you to come here. It is about \ntime I did have some fun on this world and blasting you filthy \nPredacons to bits will suffice quite nicely.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile back where Blacknightmare is the shots hit the holo \nhellpeon but do little to it. It then is about to attack her once \nagain when it dissapears, leaving blacknightmare alone. However this \nrelief will have been short lived as suddenly in its place stood \nanother Simulation type being thing. One that was the same hologram \nas before which I revealed OOC as a hologram of the bamphomet.\n\n????: &quot;No matter what happens now... you die... I created this test \nto wipe out the weak, and to fully make sure I only recieved the \nstrong, those who made the wrong choice would have to face me. The \ntest is over and your fate remains unchanged. This program shall give \nyou dose of reality of what your people stand against. Come now and \ndie.&quot;\n\nAnd with that the simulation of the being who is known to this RPG \nsince the real one spoke once but was in another form... Suddenly \ndashes off to the side of Blacknightmare at speeds unparalleled to \nanything she had scene so far. And just as quick a lance double \nbladed lance type thing appeared in its hand. The being then leaped \nhigh into the air and then flew straight down at an angle slashing at \nBlacknightmare with each side as it then outstretched its hand to \nsend a massive ray of pure chaochitan energy at Blacknightmare, the \nbeam was as big as herself.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Shivah:\n&gt; \n&gt; Shivah opened his comm link to all BlackFortress&#39; members and  \n&gt; said &quot;Come back to BlackFortress... I have an important anoucement \nto \n&gt; you&quot;\n\n\n"}}
