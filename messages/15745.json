Simply stating the \nfacts.And I understand your mistake. And, I never realized that you shot at \nDinobot, CODE, however, it&#39;s too late to post them now.)\n\n* Dinobot&#39;s breathing was quick and uneven, the pain in both his side and \nchest the most extreme he had ever felt.\nThe armor which had covered his side and half his chest was now completely \ngone, the volnerable circuits belieth covered in a constantly flowing sheet \nof mech-fluid.\nHis head still bowed and the sight in his left optic gone, he simply kneeled \nthere and collected himself. Actually forced to push back the incredable \npain from his wounds with only his will power, his back becoming slick with \nthe sweat it took to keep the pain tollerable.\nHe just KNEW that he wouldn&#39;t be able to make it back to the CF in one \npiece, the hint of battle always in his mind the second he had stopped in \nthis clearing.\nNo matter how peaceful, no matter how quant, the thought was always there.\nDinobot missed the sounds of Prowls beating feet as the Maximal ran up to \nhim, his optics clenched shut and his teeth bared and jaw clenched.\nHowever, as he opened his optics he finally heard Prowl&#39;s words, turning his \nhead towards the Maximal very slowly while taking in a long and very painful \nbreath.\nBut Prowl was on his blind side, and even turning his head to see the comrad \nsent a splitting pain down his spine.\nA snarl trickled through his clenched teeth as he turned his head towards \nthe ground once again, bowing his head while he coll,ected enough energy to \ndo exactly the last thing he wanted to do right that moment.\nWith more will power then he knew he stood, grunting as he straightened out \nhis knees and alighned his spine so that he was standing upright.\nIf he would have had any shade of real color, he would have just pailed. The \npain had increased, and if he was any less a man he would have whimpered in \npain.\nHowever, he simply swallowed that whimper and looked towards Prowl with his \ngood optic.*\n\n&quot; I can make it...on...my own.&quot;\n\n* He then looked out around the clearing, noticing that it was now \ncompletely dystroyed! All of it, completely gone! There were charge craters \nevery where, and downed trees, mech-fluid.\nThis glade was no longer the peaceful dwelling in which Tavatron and himself \nhad relaxed in only 40 cycles ago. Now, now it was a battlefield.\nDinobot growled, it sounding a little wet thanks to the mech-fluid which was \nnow working it&#39;s way up his throat.\nHe spat the fluid from his throat as another thought entered his mind: \nTavatron.\nWhere was she, and was she injured?\nThe area on which his good optic looked over didn&#39;t hold her within it&#39;s \nsight, so that meant that she would have to be on his blind side.\nAll that mattered to him was getting her back to the CF and away from Harm, \nthey also had no way of defeating the Alliance giant...so the battle was \nlost on their part.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
