She nodded to Starstorm.\n&gt;  &quot;Hello. I am KitKat. Newly joined to the ranks.&quot;\n&gt; She noticed the femme bot look at her with a touch of distaste. \nShe \n&gt; didn&#39;t care. She wasn&#39;t here to find a mate. She was out to fight \n&gt; for the faction she was now apart of.  She didn&#39;t care if this \nfemme \n&gt; didn&#39;t like her.  She only cared that this bot would show her the \n&gt; respect she deserved.  She had killed many bots in her time. And \n&gt; having one less bot on the planet didn&#39;t bother her.  Even if it \nwas \n&gt; one of her own.  For now, she would watch and learn about this new \n&gt; group. Besides, she didn&#39;t think this bot mattered much in the \n&gt; leading ranks. She was only concerned with how Hydrus saw her. She \n&gt; wanted to lead. Not play games with bots who had soft sparks. She \n&gt; turned and noticed another bot looking at her with google optics.  \n&gt; She shook her head. What has happened to the predacon empire since \n&gt; her last battle?  She felt her spark fall slightly. then her spark \n&gt; lifted. It occured to her that it would not be hard to gain power \nin \n&gt; the ranks if the others were all that softed sparked. \n&gt; She put her hand on her hip and swished her wolf tail. She looked \nup \n&gt; at Perceptor,\n&gt; &quot;Perhaps if it&#39;s not to much trouble, I would like to see the \nprints \n&gt; for this base. If I am to be effective here, I must first now my \nown \n&gt; ground. A wolf knows thier own backyard better than anyone. If ths \n&gt; is to be my new base of operations, I would like to be familiar \nwith \n&gt; the layout of my new home.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor/Starstorm:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;What is he watcing of that femme?, I&#39;m most beauty&quot;thought \n&gt; &gt; Starstorm, and said &quot;Who&#39;s that femme, Preceptor?
