There were thermal readings that were fluxuating that\n&gt; indicated movement.  He frowns at the thought of having to be ambushed.  A\n&gt; low growl escapes his throat, and clenched fang like teeth become apparent\n&gt; on his face.  He was ready to fight if need be.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Careful, not too fast, everyone.  There is definitely movement of the\n&gt; sentient kind.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe climb down continued, down past more levels of cells and room,\nmost of which could not be scanned properly due to the armor plating\nbetween them and the room itself. The trio must have traversed 10\nlevels or more before finally coming to a stop over a grating at the\nbottom which opened out into a hallway.\n\nNIGHT VIPER was the first one at the bottom and he took a moment to\nlook. Carefully he looked through the greating first and then with a\ncareful movement he pulled it back, the movement surprisingly quiet.\n\nand then . . .\n\n&quot;It took you long enough!&quot; came a fierce whisper from the hallway, it\nwas BREAK&#39;s voice.\n\n&quot;Quiet!&quot; LONGRACK said as he stepped out of the shadows as well, his\nvoice very quiet as he spoke. &quot;Its good you guys got here, I was\nbegining to worry about you.&quot;\n\nBehind LONGRACK and BREAK three more individuals stepped out, it was\nSTAMPY and MACH KICK and SHARP EDGE.\n\nNIGHT VIPER leaped to the floor, twisting in mid-air and landing\nagilly and soundlessly. &quot;We had to wait for tall and scaly over &#39;ere\nto make up his mind if he was comin&#39; or not.&quot; He hooked a thumb at\nTUSCON.\n\nLONG RACK looked up, &quot;Ahh I see. He&#39;s with us then.&quot;\n\nNIGHT VIPER nodded. &quot;Big&#39;s behind him.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
