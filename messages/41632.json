She had dug deep inside \nthe earth. And there she had remained all this time.  Her santuary \naway from the war. After the fight with a rattlesnake that nearly \ncost her her life, and the death of her beloved leader, she needed to \nfind a place to rest. Away from the war that had been brewing up on \nthe surface. Now, she lay curled up in her den, under the ground. \nSound asleep and snoozing peacefully.  Her whiskers twitched and her \nhead nudged against her paw.  She slowly opened her eyes and yawned.  \n&quot;Ooohhhhh, ouch.&quot; she groaned softly to herself. &quot;Nothing like waking \nup to cramps after a long nap.&quot; Her body felt stiff from such a long \nperiod of time without activity.  She was in mouse mode and stretched \nher small body, trying to get out the kinks. The only light in her \nden was the light coming from her own optics. But being a mouse, she \ncould see in near pitch black.  &quot;Oh my,&quot; she said as she put her paw \nto her belly,&quot;I guess I need something to eat.&quot;  She checked her  \nsmall energon compartment. It was empty. She sighed heavily.  &quot;Well, \nif I&#39;m out of food, I have to go forage. But that means,&quot; she \nswallowed hard,&quot; I have to go up onto the surface.&quot; She looked down \nand shook her head. &quot;Well, I knew I would have to go up sooner or \nlater. Well, here&#39;s nothing.&quot;  She started dig her way towards the \nsurface.  She broke ground and saw the sun. She had to cover her eyes \nas the bright light shined down on her.  She crawled up and \ntransformed into bot mode. She dusted herself off and looked around. \n&quot;Whoah!&quot;  She looked around and saw that things had changed since she \nwent into hybernation.  She wondered how much things has changed \nsince she left.  When she started her her slumber, she had burried \nherself a few miles south of the base that KitKat had been leader in. \nNow, things have changed.  She needed to see what was out there. She \nstarted walking to the old base to see what she would find.  She \nwalked in bot mode, but kept out of sight, just in case things \nweren&#39;t going well for the preds. \n\nOOC: OK, I need help, like an update on what&#39;s new here folks. I&#39;m \nback for a while. So, I could use some help here. Oh, I&#39;m only \nplaying DarkMouse. So those who have my other chars need to still \nkeep them. Sorry, but with my limited time on line, I can only work \none char at the moment. Sorry about that. \n\n\n"}}
