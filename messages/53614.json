He glances around for a \n&gt; &gt; suitable workstation and settles on a nearby table.  Putting his \n&gt; &gt; burden down nearby, he turns to Maxima.  &quot;If you&#39;ll just lie down \n&gt; &gt; over here, we can get started.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She nodded, padding over to the table he indicated. Slid upon it & \nlaid down, \n&gt; just like she had done for millions of years for updates & repairs. \nVery use \n&gt; to this. But she found it a little difficult to trust \nthis &#39;Autobot&#39; as she \n&gt; called him, since he did remind her of the enemy she fought long \nago. But,.. \n&gt; he was her chance of restoring herself. Unless she took all the raw \nmaterials \n&gt; & slipped away to the Ark. \n&gt; \n&gt; The ark. She found it hard to believe that no one knew where it \nwas. Fools, \n&gt; it&#39;s all in the records. even she knew where it was. She had been \nthere a \n&gt; couple times, long ago to destroy the Autobots, waging a \nconfrontation at the \n&gt; Ark. \n&gt; \n&gt; all the more that she had to get to the Ark to protect it. Not so \nmuch as for \n&gt; the Autobots inside, but her comrades, the Decepticons. If anyone \nwere to be \n&gt; so foolish enough to attempt to destroy it, they would change all \nthat was \n&gt; now, all the future.\n\nOOC: Uh, that&#39;s an issue for the council to decide.  There&#39;s a rule \nagainst making your chars too big.  Anyway, average G1 size is closer \nto 20 feet tall than 40.  You&#39;re talking about a character nearly the \nsize of some gestalts.\n\n&quot;Okay, here goes ...&quot;  Wheeljack reaches over and sedates her, then \nstarts to work.  Installing new parts is generally time-consuming, \nbut the Autobot makes relatively short work of it.  After a few hours \nof welding, digging, and installing the necessary subroutines for the \ntransformation to work, he feels his patient is ready to face the \nworld, and reactivates her.  &quot;There you are.  How do you feel?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
