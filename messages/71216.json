What was he feeling?  What was his spark tell=\r\ning him? After thinking for a moment, it comes to him quickly.  A stern loo=\r\nk comes upon his face plate.  One that stands more determined than ever to =\r\nput a foot down and turn the tables once and for all, in the favor of the i=\r\nnnocent and the oppressed.\n\n&quot; The Decepticons and the Predacons have had th=\r\ne upper hand far too long.  And now, we have trouble comming from the Unicr=\r\nonians as well.  This planet, everything and everyone who has been innocent=\r\nly caught in our cross fire, deserves to have their world back the way it w=\r\nas before it became corrupted by Hydras, Cyclonus and the Unicronians.  Too=\r\n much wrong has been committed, and I feel it&#39;s time something substantial =\r\nwas done about it.&quot;\n\nHe pauses for a moment.\n\n&quot; My spark is telling me that=\r\n there is a fight ahead of us.  One we can NOT afford to lose.  And in orde=\r\nr to win this fight, it will take more than just a hand full of good warrio=\r\nrs to win it.  Rodimus, I feel it&#39;s time our Autobot Companions had a chanc=\r\ne to have their voices heard once again, and show the Decepticons, and Pred=\r\nacons that we are by no means defeated permanently.  But to have their voic=\r\nes heard, they must be awakened.&quot;\n\nWith his words, the light inside his che=\r\nst, begins to pulsate once more.  This time quite a bit brighter than the l=\r\nast time it pulsated. By some strange instinct, it points him in the direct=\r\nion of where the Autobots were sleeping.  Slowly he makes his way toward th=\r\nem.\n\n&quot;Of course, Rodimus, you were right to question me. I feel it, what ne=\r\neds to be done.. The answers are within me, it was just a matter of finding=\r\n them. &quot;\n\nHe kneels next to the body of Optimus Prime, as a strong desire t=\r\no do so, compells him to place a hand upon his chest, where his Matrix lays=\r\n dorment.  He did not know what to expect but something was telling him to =\r\ndo exactly what he was doing.\n\n&quot;I - think I may have something that belongs=\r\n to you.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight:\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightlight made another attempt to woke up, =\r\nand with a big esfort she semi-opened her eyed &quot;Ro... dimus?&quot;she said in a =\r\nvery low voice while she fight to be wake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor watched carfully =\r\nin a screen outside the room\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Super Cyclonus \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, Ma=\r\ny 24, 2011 1:29 PM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: the ARK to =\r\nawaken from sleep!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight&#39;s hand weakly c=\r\nlosed holding Rodimu&#39;s, It was acounsious act?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She slowly started t=\r\no move, then she opened her eyes and smiled when she\n&gt; &gt; looked a familiar =\r\nface... A face that she knew who were but her confused\n&gt; &gt; mind couldnt foc=\r\nus enough to give it a name. Then she closed her eyes once\n&gt; &gt; more, her mi=\r\nnd was between the awake and the sleep state.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus just =\r\nsmiled as he held Nightlight&#39;s hand, his optics glowing brightly. There wer=\r\ne so many other things going on around him, a planet to protect, battles to=\r\n be fought, but at this moment in time there was only one thing =96 one bei=\r\nng: Nightlight. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He now walks toward a computer consol=\r\ne, with a resolute expression.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; From what I&#39;ve been receiving, sin=\r\nce I left my com link operative during\n&gt; &gt; stasis, and was able to hear fra=\r\ngments of it, during that time, we seem to\n&gt; &gt; have an insecticon pressense=\r\n in a far quadrant of the area&#39;s parameters. I\n&gt; &gt; am also aware that Night=\r\n Shift is now on the search with Rat Trap, to find\n&gt; &gt; Cheetor. His intenti=\r\nons were in the right place, but like me, he tends to\n&gt; &gt; bite off more tha=\r\nn he can chew. And I think we&#39;ve all been doing that a\n&gt; &gt; little bit latel=\r\ny. Our forces are not as numberous as the opposing side,\n&gt; &gt; and perhaps it=\r\n would help if our forces were expanded somehow. The Autobots\n&gt; &gt; in the Ar=\r\nk are not due to awaken too soon, but it would benefit us if they\n&gt; &gt; would=\r\n. The Maximals can not protect this planet by themselves, and it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; time=\r\n I made sure they get the help they need. There must be a way we can\n&gt; &gt; aw=\r\naken the Ark..&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well? Why don=\r\n&#39;t you guys consult the Matrix? I bet it would know, and\n&gt; &gt; give you guys =\r\nthe guidence you need ta answer your questions. After all,\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re both =\r\nPrimes, right?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson raises a brow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;She&#39;s right. Perhaps=\r\n it&#39;s time we did consult the Matrix, Together.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus ha=\r\nd not truly been paying attention to Tuscon and the others. He was not igno=\r\nring them or angry with them so much as his attention was focused on someth=\r\ning of far more importance. \n&gt; \n&gt; However at the mention of the Matrix his =\r\noptics blinked. &quot;You want to consult the matrix?&quot; Rodimus said. &quot;Its wisdom=\r\n beats inside our chest with every actuation of our energon pump.&quot; Rodimus =\r\ncontinued to speak, even though his optics were looking upon Nightlight. &quot;C=\r\nonsult it if you like, but tell me Tuscon, what is inside you, what is your=\r\n heart telling you to do?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor started to move q=\r\nuietly towards Rodimus and said &quot;She should see\n&gt; &gt; me here, not for now. I=\r\n&#39;m a... bad memory and that could affect her. Take\n&gt; &gt; this&quot; he handled a s=\r\nmall gadget&quot;this will render her unconseus in case that\n&gt; &gt; things turns ug=\r\nly. I&#39;ll be watching in the screen outside the room.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor mov=\r\ned out and motioned the others to follow him , just before to\n&gt; &gt; leave the=\r\n room he moves close to Tucsona and said &quot;I have something to tell\n&gt; &gt; you.=\r\n.. but in private&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then Perceptor leaves the room and waited for Ro=\r\ndimus and Tucson.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus nodded, &quot;I understand Perceptor.&quot;=\r\n Rodimus said quietly. He took the device that preceptor handed him and the=\r\nn looked back at his wife, wondering how she would wake up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignoring t=\r\nhe rest again he smiled back down at Nightlight, &quot;Come my love, wake up, wa=\r\nke up to me.&quot; He called to her softly. \n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
