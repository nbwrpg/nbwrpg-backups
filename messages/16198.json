Her mind reeled in blurr of dreams \nand memories.  She mumbled in her sleep,&quot;nooo, get to out.&quot;\n\nShe turned and twitched in her sleep.  She winced as she turned  in \nher sleep.  Her ribs still hurt and would take a while to heal.\n\nShe dreamed of Drillbit&#39;s proposal to her.  She whispered in her \nsleep,&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\nShe then dreamed of killing Megatron for deserting his group to die. \nShe dreamed that she had him cornered and shot at him with her optic \nlazars.  She shot at him again and again.  She saw his lifeless body \nthere and she smiled. &quot;You stay a leader by sticking with your team, \nnot just leave them to die.&quot;  She chuckled in her sleep a little at \nthe thought of getting even with Megatron.\n\n\n"}}
