As he neared another hallway the door slid shut behind him blocking his\nway. He moved to his left toward another hall but again a door slid shut so\nhe couldn&#39;t go anywhere. &quot;Actions like this make me think you don&#39;t trust\nme.&quot; the drones trying to grab him clinched it. &quot;Uh guys, you don&#39;t have to\nshow me out, I can find my own way.&quot; One drone grabbed him, then the next,\nin a short time he was held aloft so he couldn&#39;t move. &quot;I guess you want me\nto hang around for a while.&quot;\n\nRazor Claw looked to Ender knowing how bored the other bot had fealt.\nInaction to a Predacon was a fate worse than death. &quot;If you want action then\nstand behind me, when the door opens there will probably be a batallion of\nPreds on the other side waiting to frag us, They&#39;ll be in for a surprise\nwhen we escape without a scratch.&quot;\n\nOutside the door Bullet stood poised with his weapon aimed toward the door\nready for it to open so he could finally slag something.\n\nLunarpine heard Shivah use the word Traitor to describe Megaton. &quot;So the\nscums no longer here after all.&quot; he thought. The wolfbot was now starting to\nsmile &quot;Bring the prisoners outside and we&#39;ll have a nice little chat about\nour mutual dislike for the monster.&quot; He knew that if they found a mutual\nagreement that there was a chance everybody could get out of this without\nany further damage.\n\nBlaze and Silver Scout continued wandering through the halls until they\nfinally reached the exit. Blaze opened her wrist compartment and plugged a\nfew wires into the door. &quot;You ready to go?&quot; Blaze asked partially depressed\nthat it had come to this.&quot;Hopefully your friend outside will have enough\nantidote for both of us.&quot; Silver Scout tilted her head appearing to be hurt\nby Blazes comment She had thought she&#39;d found a friend but instead Blaze was\nonly in it for the cure.Her trust of the tigress was spoiled. The wolf had\nno choice though, she&#39;d have to trust the other bot at least until they were\noutside.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@...&gt;\nTo: Neo Beast Wars RPG &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, September 11, 2001 4:27 PM\nSubject: Re: Foxfingers\n\n\n&gt; ::KitKat2::\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Thats true, but you are still intruding in our base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
