He didn&#39;t mean to go\nagainst her wishes like that, he just wanted the Maximals to live.\nProwl nods and steps back.\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; he says. It wouldn&#39;t be good to stay here right now\nanyways. He would try to talk to her when she calms down. Prowl\nreluctantly turns around, but doesn&#39;t fly off yet, hesistating and\nlooking back at Iron Raptor.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Her eyes were empty when they turned and looked at Prowl, nothing\nleft in \n&gt; them.
