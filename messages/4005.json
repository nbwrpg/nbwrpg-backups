He \nlooks up just in time to see Oblitertron&#39;s optic shot heading for him.\n\nHe takes in a sharp breath as the optic blast him in the wing, leaving a hole \nin it and sending him and Iron Raptor into a spiral, slowly losing altitude. \nHe growls, straightening his damaged wing as far as he can to rebalance \nhimself, slightly regaining the glide but still losing altitude.\n\n&quot;Hang on,&quot; he says to Iron Raptor through clenched theeth, &quot;This is going to \nbe a bumpy landing.&quot;\n\n"}}
