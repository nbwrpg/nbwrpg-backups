He \nwas starting to lose ammunition.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf opened his mouth, firing off a fireball from his mouth at Doom Ice.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper let the missile knock him to his skid plate.  He merely let out \na hoarse laugh, firing off five rapid optic blasts off at Gigas&#39; chest.\n\n---\n\nAres was hit with the four missiles from Serge, sending him rolling off to \nthe side with dents and holes in his armor.\n\n---\n\nSixshot in the air saw Serge open fire and take out Ares.  Activating his \ntargeting computer, he fired down two missiles at Serge.  Ares wasn&#39;t as \nstrong as Sixshot, but if things got bad in the Alliance, the STAG would need \nall the help he could get.\n\n---\n\nUnitron turned the cannon to target Rizopas, firing off a single energy blast \nin his tank mode at Rizopas.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor arrived on scene, seeing a few autoguns fire on him.  Ignoring the \nshells that were almost piercing his armor, he raised his plasma launcher, \nfiring off a blast at Doom Ice.  (NOTE: Plasma launcher is same as bazooka, \nonly plasma energy instead of large explosive shell)\n\n---\n\nMinion cursed as weapons fire knocked him back.  Getting up, he fired off 10 \nrapid optic blasts at Doom Ice.\n\n---\n\nChaos transformed to his missile trailer mode, firing off two missiles at the \nMafia base.\n\n"}}
