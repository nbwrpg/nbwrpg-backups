We will all turn our cloaks off, and \n&gt; distract the Maximals by drawing them outside for a battle. \n&gt; Meanwhile, you will still have your cloak on, and will enter the \nbase \n&gt; through a large panel that is missing on the other side of the ship \n&gt; because of previous battles. When you find Spears, slap this cloak \non \n&gt; her and run back to base. We&#39;ll keep the battle up until you are at \n&gt; the base. Put Spears in a holding cell until I get there, and if \nshe \n&gt; wakes tell her the Maximals did something evil to her and we must \nfix \n&gt; it. Everyone understand? Good. We begin in 10 cycles. Everyone load \n&gt; up!\n\n\n"}}
