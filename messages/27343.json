That girl would have to learn.     Blood was all part of war, they sort of went hand in hand. And Carnage intended on teaching Teltoli this...the hard way, by spilling some of her own. That was how she had learned, and the hard way was the way the fuzor fembot was going to be taught from the very beginning.\r\nLife seldomely gave second chances and knowing the hard knocks of life could make sure that a person knew enough so that they didn&#39;t need a second chance. That was when they were considered professionals.  However, the flap of wings caused her to lose her thoughts and watch Teltoli lift off into the air in search for the bog and the things she needed, sure that she would use her scanners to locate the swamp which was all part of her home. From the edge of this forest on was her territory, even though she lived still a days walk from this position.  But the scanners would have to be forgotten from this afternoon on, since it would be way too easy to do what Carnage had in mind for Teltoli&#39;s trial, certain hell for the next 2 or 3 days.\r\nSeveral cycles after Teltoli had disappeared Carnage began wrapping up the pieces she was taking home again, watching as the air warmed and small flies came in and began buzzing around the pile of guts she had left from the sow.     It was a real shame that the boar had bloated and had to be thrown out, since it was a nice solid meat but ruined by water. It was the fat that did it all. The fat would expand and send a chemical into the meat to make it turn sour after being wet, soaking in the moisture and destroying a perfectly good meal.\r\nCarnage growled at the thought, tying the bundle up quickly and then setting it aside before reaching for another and piling a number of bones into the second. Not pleased at all by what she had been forced to do, throw a meal away that she had run down and used priceless energy to slay. But that was the way life played out for those who live by its rules, and those who could not follow them died.\r\nShe looked up when she heard bushes rustle about half an hour later, her scanners picking up the signature of Teltoli before she broke from the forest cover with a rock wrapped in vines behind her. So�the little kitten had done it. Smiling, she notices the bog gunk all the way up to her waist and elbows. And it�seemed not to be all that much of an easy task. Perfect.  But Carnage�s smile only widened when she heard Teltoli�s question, getting to her feet and walking over to the boulder, looking it over. ** � That�s for me to know and for you to find out later.�  ** Running a hand over it�s slimy surface she saw it�s angles and depth with scanners, finding that it was something with more holes in it then she needed. Too many holes could make the stone cracked when heated�but the pockets might hold heat nicely and keep it warm long after the source of the heat had been extinguished. But��she wasn�t going to tell Teltoli that.\r\nCarnage shook her head.** � It�s not good enough. I need you to go and get me another one. But leave this hear, I can use it for something else.�  ** She was going to reach down to get the boulder but Teltoli�s rear was stationed rather firmly upon it, the female raptor giving Teltoli a little shove so that she�d get the idea and get off. But chuckling when she heard just how winded the fuzor was.** �Oh no. You�ve got to get to the moss now while the dew�s still on it. No time to catch your breath.�  ** There was no time to get your breath back in war, but Teltoli would have enough time to regain it while she ate later.**\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
