Atma as second in command. Good one! As I recall JP said\n&gt; Quickstrike was going to be second in command.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike made his way down to a corridor where there were multible\ndoors\n&gt; that lead to the quarters. As he recalled there were at least two\ncorridors\n&gt; with quarters. Not all rooms where quarters as he found out. He didn&#39;t\nwant\n&gt; to have her too close to his quarters.\n&gt;\n&gt; He kept walking down. He decided a quarters for Dark Mouse would be all\n&gt; right, but not so close to his. She may just tag along too much, but he\n&gt; could help her out since she wasn&#39;t at her best.\n&gt;\n&gt; He checked a door at the right side of the corridor. It was unlocked so he\n&gt; pressed a botton on the side that made the door slide open. He was just in\n&gt; luck. It was an empty quarters and it had good enough room for Dark Mouse.\n&gt; These sets of quarters that the Trypicon had were huge compared to the\n&gt; Darkside&#39;s, and he liked it. He looked around it fully and nodded in\n&gt; approval. He walked out and closed it behind him. He walked back to the\nlab\n&gt; room where Dark Mouse and Black Arachnia were. He leaned against the frame\n&gt; of the door and waited for Black Arachnia to finish with Dark Mouse.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
