She smiled \nat Drillbit. &quot;I&#39;ll, I&quot;ll be OK.  Make sure the others get to the CR.  \nI&quot;ll go in last.&quot; as she looked at her leg hanging by a few wires.\n\nShe looked at Tesifier with Land Mine&#39;s spark. She had Drillbit \nremove the memroies of Land Mine from her memory banks so she didn&#39;t \nknow who Testifire was talking about.  She nodded and looked at the \nspark. &quot;See is Phobia has any spare parts to make that spark a body.  \nWe will need that bot in battle later on.&quot; She leaned against \nDrillbit and closed her eyes.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Technosis stirs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ha!
