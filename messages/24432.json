He looks up and \nsees the tornado heading for him. Lighting hits him and is absorbed, \nbut Lavatron steps back from Shadow Cat and tripps.\n\nHe falls backwards, his bulk heading for Snow Tech.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I wont be able to post for about two weeks. I am going to my Aunts \nand they \n&gt; don&#39;t have internet. i&#39;ll try to, but i doubt it. Sorry. you can go \non with \n&gt; out me though. I&#39;ll catch up!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Snow Tech looks at the bolt of electricity fired at him. He knew \nit would \n&gt; be too late to get away, so he just stared at it with wide eye&#39;s. \nAnd, \n&gt; before it hit him, he said the one thing he could think of.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Oh S@#$!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * The lightning shot through him, making his fur seemingly explode \noff his \n&gt; body. The fur that was left on him, curled really tightly to his \nbody, \n&gt; making him look like a french-poodle. He bounced around and \nstuttering.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; d-dd-d-dd-dd-d-ddd-d!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *He jittered into the bush again, falling on his ass. It would be \nup to \n&gt; Shadow Cat now.*\n&gt; \n&gt; * Shadow Cat was flying high above the battle, oblivious to every \nthing till \n&gt; two missles flew past her and exploded. She growled. This was \ngetting \n&gt; annoying. She lifted her arms to the sky and called with all her \nmight for \n&gt; the great forces of the air, her eyes turning a bright purple. the \nwind \n&gt; began to pick-up around her and the clouds darkened. Electricity \ncrackled \n&gt; and roared towards her at her call. It condensed around her body, \nhugging \n&gt; her like a lover might, until she was the lightning herself. She \nshaped \n&gt; herself into a torpedo shape and shot down towards the pred. No way \nwas she \n&gt; going to miss this time!*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
