Our \noriginal mission was to find and arrest him.  But another group of \nPredacons turned up led by Galvatron - the mutated nutcase that \nUnicron made of the original Megatron.  He&#39;d been reformatted to a \nPred himself and the two got into a fight.  There was an accident, \nand the two fused.  Boom!  Instant super-robot!  And Hydras is, from \nwhat I&#39;ve seen, even crazier than his component parts.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
