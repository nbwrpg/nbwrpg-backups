The trainers came\n&gt; and attacked us while you were gone.  They took Striker and Spears\n&gt; with them. Striker was damaged and unconsious.  Spears was turned\n&gt; into a slave by some chip.&quot;  She looked at the others who steppped\n&gt; off the shuttle.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry to have to tell you like this, but we\n&gt; need to plan to get them back some how.&quot;  She winced at her shoulder,\n&gt; still dripping fluid.  She looked up at Ramulus, hoping he would have\n&gt; an answer.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Striker/Ramulus::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Striker looks back at Prebon, his eyes hostile. He glanced at\n&gt; &gt; Spears,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wondering who she could have named. She hadn&#39;t been on the planet\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too long, so she probably didn&#39;t know who was the Maximal leader,\n&gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he was sure he had met at least a few high officials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing was for sure in Striker&#39;s mind, whoever the Maximal\n&gt; &gt; leader\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was would probably be this team&#39;s next target. He couldn&#39;t let\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen. Setting his scanners to give him info on the chip in\n&gt; &gt; Spears&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; head, Striker looks back at Prebon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Who should he name? Someone that Spears might have also named,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; someone who was experienced, someone like.....\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ramulus,&quot; Striker says, &quot;And if you let Spears and me go, I can\n&gt; &gt; lead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you right to him. Or him to you, whichever you preffer.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus lets out a breath of relief as the shuttle lands safely,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nearly jumping out of his seat as the belt releases. He makes his\n&gt; &gt; way\n&gt; &gt; &gt; outside, looking lovingly around at nature, even if nature was a\n&gt; &gt; bit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; charred and cratered. This is where he belonged, not on some moon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He looks back at the Maximals, waiting for them to say something.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
