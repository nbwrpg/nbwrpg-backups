Tucson was one of those =\r\nstudents\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worthy of such an ancient art. He performs the maneuver in d=\r\nraconic form,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as he gracefully twists his body around to attempt to m=\r\neet the blast with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his blocking maneuver. He spins swiftly on one foo=\r\nt, as his tail coils\n&gt; &gt; &gt; around his body as part of the block. He hoped i=\r\nt would help, his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comrades were depending on him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It woul=\r\nd almost appear that Master Yoketron was alive and well inside\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: I am unsure what Tuscon is using to actually block the Plas=\r\nma\n&gt; &gt; blast coming from Magmatron?

It has the capacity to litera=\r\nlly\n&gt; &gt; melt the hardest metals and evaporate the lesser ones. It was this\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; that TUSCON was trying to block, the searing hot material spraying\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nacross him!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LEO PRIME leaped back well aware of the lethal propert=\r\nies of plasma!\n&gt; &gt; His movements were agile and well coordinated as he land=\r\ned in a squat\n&gt; &gt; his weapons out and firing at the much larger MAGMATRON!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIG CONVOY grunted as the Plasma caught him in the chest knocking =\r\nhim\n&gt; &gt; backwards through the air and sent him slamming into the ground, hi=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; broad chest black and burnt, smoke rising from its surface!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;Is that all you&#39;ve got?&quot; CONVOY chuckled as he struggled to sit up\n&gt; &gt; and=\r\n then coughed up a dark fluid.

There is no one here\n&gt; &gt; to protect you from my breath! from my f=\r\ninal attack!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With a final beat of his wing he looked as if he wer=\r\ne taking a breath,\n&gt; &gt; the very air becoming frosty and cold as he smiled a=\r\nt the blackened\n&gt; &gt; form of OPTIMUS PRIME . . . when a cannon blast erupted=\r\n across the\n&gt; &gt; room lighting it up for a moment and struck CRYOTEK full on=\r\n in the\n&gt; &gt; chest!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;KRACKTHOOM!!&lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Not while there is a=\r\n amp left in my spark chamber will you touch the\n&gt; &gt; frame of Optimus ever =\r\nagain!&quot; said a familiar voice, one that caused\n&gt; &gt; DARK RODIMUS and even MA=\r\nGMATRON to pause and look over.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The voice was that of RODIMUS PRIM=\r\nE, standing resplendently on the\n&gt; &gt; other side of the room, smoke rising f=\r\nrom the business end of his\n&gt; &gt; weapon.\n&gt; &gt; CRYOTEK landed in a heap on the=\r\n far side of the battle, his wings\n&gt; &gt; burnt and tangled.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Around R=\r\nODIMUS were standing four strange looking figures, three male\n&gt; &gt; and one f=\r\nemale.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/306782857=\r\n/pic/1443963172/view\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
