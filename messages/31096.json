Even though Prowl had changed since \nMantle last saw him, Mantle could still recognize him through telepathy. He \nstretched out a hand for a handshake.\n\n&quot;Hello Prowl.&quot; He said. &quot;Its been a while since we lost communication with \nyou and Striker.&quot;\n\nMantle knew that Cinder was standing behind him, and he could feel in his \nmind that her spark was beating like mad. But he could understand. After \nmonths of worrying, Cinder finally found the bot she&#39;d been worrying about. \nTo her, the fact that the rest of the team was gone wasn&#39;t as bad as it \nwould have been if Prowl had died too. Aqua was holding Cinder by the \nshoulders, something that Mantle was thankful for since it prevented her \nfrom running up to Prowl.\n\n\n\nRubble arrived at the CR room of the Element and sat down, waiting for \nFirearm to get repaired. (sorry this is short, i gotta go!)\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
