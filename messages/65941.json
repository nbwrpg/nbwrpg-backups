After \nfew minutes a=\r\nn alarm appeared in the CR&#39;s main screen:\n\nWarning:\n\nFollow signature has b=\r\need reconized as enemie one.

He opened the door \nwide\n&gt; and walked back over to Blacknigh=\r\ntmare.  He rolled her onto her\n&gt; stomach and with a laser knife opened her =\r\nupper torso from the \nback to\n&gt; get access to the spark container.  He turn=\r\ned around and got a can \nof\n&gt; lead spray and used to to seal all of the cra=\r\ncks in the container \nto\n&gt; prevent electromagnetic waves from the CR Chambe=\r\nr from damaging the\n&gt; spark.  With that done he hastily closed and sealed h=\r\ner back.  He\n&gt; lifted her and loaded her into the CR Chamber.  After it did=\r\n a \nbrief\n&gt; scan he pressed a button confirmed it and it began an extensive=\r\n \nrepair\n&gt; process.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright, all we can do now is wait and hope.&quot; He =\r\nsaid turning to \nthe\n&gt; others in the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I made of half the med=\r\nical procedures but at last it sounded \ncool.\n\n\n\n"}}
