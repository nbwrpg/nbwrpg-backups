He activates his comm-link.\n\n&quot;I suggest you lower your shields before my troops have to take them \ndown with force. As soon as my troops are out, we&#39;ll depart and leave \nthe Maximal hostage to you,&quot; he says to Iron Raptor, waiting for the \nshields to be lowered.\n\n(Only Iron Raptor (with the codes Kluster gave her), Kluster, \nHysteria, Firearm, and Chordate have the ability to lower the CF&#39;s \nshields).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;FIRE FOX&quot; &lt;firefox_y2k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (I&#39;m a little curious as well. How did Magnus get inside the CF? \nAnd if he \n&gt; is, you do realize that most areas are restricted due to the \nlockdown, \n&gt; right? Oh, Happy B-Day Roborick! Sorry it&#39;s late, but I couldn&#39;t \nget on \n&gt; yesterday! I probably won&#39;t be able to post tomorrow, maybe late at \nnight, \n&gt; but no promises. IR, are you still posting with Diana?

The horn missiles had \n&gt; penetrated the door, and due to it&#39;s weakened moleculer structure \nhad \n&gt; created a rather good sized hole considering the density of the \ndoor:\n&gt; \n&gt; CF COMP: Penetration, main entrance doors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria dropped what she was doing and brought up a hazy image of \nthe \n&gt; blasted entry way on the console screen:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Seal the door.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; CF COMP: Unable to comply. Seal has been penetrated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria banged a fist against the console. So much for the \nlockdown. It was \n&gt; still in effect everywhere else, but the door HAD been penetrated. \nWell, the \n&gt; shield was still active, though a little shaky it should hold. Plus \nthe \n&gt; ceasefire prevented the Alliance from blasting at the shields.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron:\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron growled under her breath as she fought every primal \ninstinct she \n&gt; had to jump on Lion and rip him limb from limb. The waiting had \nmade her \n&gt; anxious and extremely tempermental.
