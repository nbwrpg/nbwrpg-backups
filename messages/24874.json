With one eye gone, and n=\r\now a middle finger snapped off \n  somewhere, and a portion of his hip to ac=\r\ncompany it, he was leaking mech. \n        He held out his Tailgun, and fire=\r\nd 15 shots after Killfest. Some aimed \n  for him legs, others at his chest,=\r\n and three for his face. Megatron was going \n  to damage this bot, there wa=\r\ns no escaping it.
