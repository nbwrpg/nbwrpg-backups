She spins, and it glances off of her \nshoulder plating. Lynxiz begins to fall, and is forced to break her \nfall by placing her hands on the ground, and pushing herself back \nup into a standing stance. She backs off slightly, keeping her eye \non Stranato. She circles, snarling and holding her left upper chest \nwound, taking a defensive stance. She prepares to either attack or \ndodge.\n\n\nOn 22 May 2001, at 16:16, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n\n&gt; The rifle was knocked from Stranato&#39;s hand and his left arm was\n&gt; slashed.
