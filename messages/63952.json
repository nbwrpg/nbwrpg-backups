The waters\n&gt;   were black at night, but calm.  The sand under her feet still felt\n&gt;   warm from the day&#39;s heat.  Trees swayed in the light breeze that blew\n&gt;   off the ocean.  She looked around the beautiful place.  She was alone,\n&gt;   but it didn&#39;t seem to matter. She felt happy just being there. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt;     a..
