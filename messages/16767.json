Li=\r\nfe was precious, and something one didn&#39;t really \nappreciate until \n&gt; they =\r\nno longer had it. She planned on living a long time, however, \nand \n&gt; wasn&#39;=\r\nt about to dwell on what was yet to be.  As the sky became \nshrouded in \n&gt; =\r\nfog Tavatron resettled herself so that her tail was no longer \ncrumpled in =\r\na \n&gt; very uncomfortable position beneath her. Slag it, that hurt. The \none =\r\nbad \n&gt; thing about having a tail was the inability to find a comfortable \np=\r\nosition \n&gt; when one was on their back. Well, it had always been a problem f=\r\nor \nher.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dinobot had remained quiet for a while now, something she had=\r\n grown \nused to. \n&gt; Still, something about his silence troubled the femme `=\r\nbot. It\nwas \njust a \n&gt; feeling, one that wouldn&#39;t stop nagging at her circu=\r\nits. It\nfigured \nthat \n&gt; despite her enjoyment of her current situation SOM=\r\nETHING would \nstart \n&gt; bothering her. It seemed she never got any peace. It=\r\n was enough to \nmake a \n&gt; `bot go mad. She had grown accustomed to the cons=\r\ntant upheavals\nin \nher life, \n&gt; so this was nothing new.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron jump=\r\ned at the sound of Dinobot&#39;s voice. Who was he\nyelling \nat? She \n&gt; followed=\r\n his gaze, trying to pinpoint some far off threat, but she \nfound \n&gt; nothin=\r\ng. Was there something she had missed? Was someone following \nthem? \n&gt; Sudd=\r\nenly she too was on her feet, the fact that they were quite a \nways from \n&gt;=\r\n the ground didn&#39;t sink in until she had already drawn her sword\nand \nscann=\r\ned \n&gt; the area as best she could. She then turned to face Dinobot, her \nswo=\r\nrd \n&gt; lowering until the tip nearly touched Necromancer&#39;s back. He\nwas \nyel=\r\nling at \n&gt; the stars? Tavatron raised a questioning eye-ridge as she swivel=\r\ned \nher ears \n&gt; forward, her expression one of mild curiosity and intense \n=\r\nconfusion. This \n&gt; was completely unlike him. Had he gone mad from loss of =\r\nfluid?\n&gt; \n&gt; From what she could tell this had something to do with his past=\r\n, a \nthing he \n&gt; had never really talked about with her. It was understanda=\r\nble, even \nshe \n&gt; didn&#39;t like talking about what had been when there was st=\r\nill so \nmuch that \n&gt; could be. Still, perhaps there was more to this than s=\r\nhe thought. \nDinobot \n&gt; really did look upset. She would make it a point to=\r\n ask him about \nit later, \n&gt; when they were safely on the ground and he was=\r\n repaired. His \ncurrent state \n&gt; couldn&#39;t be helping matters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron=\r\n nearly jumped as the massive dragon they were riding \nspoke. They \n&gt; were =\r\nlanding?! She could worry about Dinobot later, right now she \nhad to sit \n&gt;=\r\n down or else=85\n&gt; \n&gt; No sooner had Tavatron thought of the possibility of =\r\nfalling did \nNecromancer \n&gt; land. The force of the landing threw her from t=\r\nhe Dragon&#39;s\nback, \nand left \n&gt; her sprawled in the dirt a few feet from him=\r\n. With a shake of her \nhead and a \n&gt; growl of annoyance Tavatron got up and=\r\n sheathed her sword. They \nwere here, \n&gt; and Dinobot was still breathing. S=\r\nhe thanked Necromancer for the \nride before \n&gt; turning in Dinobot&#39;s directi=\r\non:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well, are you coming?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She had meant what she said in a very=\r\n light-hearted sense. He no \ndoubt had \n&gt; seen her fall, so she was trying =\r\nto make the best of an \nembarrassing \n&gt; situation.\n&gt; \n_____________________=\r\n_________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, F=\r\nree E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share informat=\r\nion about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.ms=\r\nn.com.\n\n\n"}}
