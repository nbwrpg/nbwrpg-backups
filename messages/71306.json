Can be one of the reinforcements and such sent in.\n\nWHEELIE\n=\r\n\nFaction: Autobot/Maximal\n\nQUOTE:  Look there, over there!  Friends find, l=\r\nook behind!\n\nPROFILE:  An Autobot by the name of Wheelie grew up on a crash=\r\ned ship, surviving for an unkonwn period of time on Quintessa.  Found by Au=\r\ntobots during the first Unicron crisis, he soon joined them and was a stalw=\r\nart part of their forces going alon gwith the first Maximal Imperium after =\r\nthe war.  A loner often forming strong bonds adn freindships and with a uni=\r\nque sort of personality from his time spent in isolation and having to figh=\r\nt to survive, Wheelie is often accompanied by his scrounger friend Gnaw, op=\r\nerating with local groups that cna tolerate his infmay as he moves on.\n\nABI=\r\nLITIES:  A permanent glitch in his vocal processor developed by his long pe=\r\nriod in isolation upon Quintessa, Wheelie&#39;s vocalizer tends to vocalize in =\r\nways in whatever linguistic dialect that are often translated as &#39;rhymes&#39;. =\r\n These tend to be high pitched, grating, and annoying, and prolonged exposu=\r\nre is held to be extremely damaging to one&#39;s circuits, much like Cosmic Rus=\r\nt and Fire Suppressant Foam.  As such, the sight (or sound) of Wheelie on t=\r\nhe battlefield is often enough to drive many Predacons or Decepticons to fl=\r\nee and abandon the area.\n\nWheelie is armed with a small energon slingshot w=\r\nith a close range high capacity load that is capable of inflicting signific=\r\nant damage on larger Cybertronians.  His small alt mode of a Cybertronian r=\r\nacer has a top speed of 180 kilometers per hour and a range of over three t=\r\nhousand kilometers.  Wheelie himself is heavily energon efficient, even by =\r\nMaximal standard, and his bodyframe is capable of extended independent func=\r\ntioning without refueling or repairs (which is the way many Maximals would =\r\nprofess to like it), and is quite simplistic to maintain that even Wheelie =\r\ncan keep himself basically functional without medical supervision.  His sma=\r\nll bodyframe is also quite agile and difficult to hit, combined with his lo=\r\nng vorns spent of surviving have made him quite surprisingly adept at escap=\r\ne and evasion, guerilla operations, and reconaissance in urban or organic a=\r\nreas.\n\n\nWeaknesses:  Wheelie has much of a reputation, deserved or not, amo=\r\nng Autobots and Decepticons.  While he can count some as staunch friends, h=\r\nis ability to seemingly inflict insanity to those in constant presence of h=\r\nis chattering has made many Autobots and Maximals wish to avoid prolonged i=\r\nnteractions with him, and can lead to his constant solo operations in the f=\r\nield without backup.  This has also lead to a constant but unsubstantiated =\r\nthreats of violence to be inflicted upon him by his own faction, depending =\r\non how casual the company is.\n\nWheelie&#39;s form, while agile, is very small a=\r\nnd very vulnerable, and lacks power.  He is weak physically, and his primar=\r\ny weapon (an energon slingshot) has a very limited range, and even low powe=\r\nred energy weapons can inflict significant damage upon him.  In a hand to h=\r\nand fight he is seriously vulnerable to damage and can take few hits.\n\n\nHis=\r\ntory:  Wheelie spent unknown thousands of vorns as the only survivor of a c=\r\nrashed ship upon Quintessa, where upon his rescue he became a stalwart part=\r\n of the AUtobot forces, most often operating on long range reconaissance mi=\r\nssions or as backup to his friends.  After the Autobot/Decepticon War ended=\r\n, and many of his friends went into retirement, Wheelie was not upgraded al=\r\nong with teh initial wave of Maximal upgrading, preferring to keep his orig=\r\ninal body as a memory to those whom had been lost in the war.\n\nPending the =\r\nend of the war, Wheelie&#39;s whereabouts became much fo a mystery, with variou=\r\ns stories at any point theorizing he had been killed in a back alley by Aut=\r\nobot/Decepticons (most often accompanied by &#39;I&#39;LL DRINK TO THAT!&#39; in Maccad=\r\nam&#39;s) to that he was working with th Maximal Security Administration.  One =\r\ntheroy even stated that he had been part of the Maximal Experimentation Pro=\r\ngram that had produced Protoform X, simply stating that he was what had dri=\r\nven the unit that would eventually call itself Rampage to total sociopathy =\r\nand nihilism simply from being locked in a cell for the experiments!  Many =\r\nwould explain their decline to believe in Primus by saying &#39;He made that gu=\r\ny, didn&#39;t he?&#39; and gesture to the MiniBot.\n\n(Un)fortunately, Wheelie has be=\r\nen still functioning over the era, living on Cybertron, often going on trip=\r\ns to search the galaxy and find more information.  While there, he would sp=\r\nend much of his time in Little Iacon remiscing of the old days.  Upon attem=\r\nptimg to join a craft, according to scuttleaft a Maximal hit upon the idea =\r\nof sending him along with Leo&#39;s reinforcement crew to Earth.\n\nFurther scutt=\r\nleaft was hoping that by sending him several tens of thousands of vorns bac=\r\nk in time and to active military conflict would &#39;get the little cans to be =\r\nrecycled&#39;, but were never actively confirmed as transfer orders were sent.\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
