She smiled. She took\na few steps closer to him. &quot;Very well, follow.&quot; She turned and\nmotioned with her foreleg, for him to come along. Her clone stood\nthere.  It followed behind FoxFinger. KitKat smiled at the fox. &quot;Now\nthen, why did you break in here? But I must give you credit, you are\na good burgler. You burgle well.&quot;  She tried to put her paw on his\nshoulder. &quot;You know, if you ever decide to you want some action, or\njust a change of pace, please stop by again.&quot; She just barely touched\nhis shoulder. She pulled her paw away, but left a very tiny tracking\ndevice on his shoulder.\n\n Foxfingers Grabbed KitKats wrist as she touched his shoulder drawing a DNA\nsample from the Pred as he did. He gently pushed it aside trying not to show\nto agressive of tendancies. &quot;Don&#39;t touch me without having those paws\nsterilized first.&quot; he didn&#39;t trust the Pred, there was no profit in trust,\nbut there was more to it than that. he didn&#39;t know if it was his programming\nor something more but he deffinitely did not trust her. He heard Bludgeon\nchuckle in the background as she touched him. Hethought Bludgeon was\nlaughing at his wit and let it pass. He asked himself three questions (No\nnone of them are if he feals lucky.) 1 Why would this Predacon release him\nknowing that he has cell samples from Megatrons clone?  2 &quot;What does Kit Kat\nhave to gain by letting him go?&quot; and 3 &quot;Why does she keep asking the same\nquestion about why he was here when he&#39;d already answered her.&quot; He had one\nanswer for all three, She was stalling for time until either she found a way\nto contain him or she was planning to track him. For all he knew she could\nhave already slipped a tracking device on him.\n\nHe looked at her frame, she was slightly bigger than him but he thought he\ncould still beat her in a fair fight. But she had three others to back her\nup where he was alone. &quot;You offered me a deal to join you, What do I gain by\nthis deal?&quot; Now he was weighing his options and stalling for time.\n\n\n\nKitKat leads Foxfingers toward the exit when they&#39;re intercepted by Koj and\nInu\n\n\n ::Koj::\n&gt; Koj lands next to Firefox &quot;Fox were with you on this no matter what\nhappens\n&gt; Maximals got to stick together!&quot; Koj ports shoot the halfs of the Fang.\nKoj\n&gt; grabs them and snaps the Lance together.Koj takes a 50/50 stance. His\n&gt; shoulder plates lift up to reveal the twin tekno Fusion Cannons as they\n&gt; start to power up.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Inu::\n&gt; Inu size gives him a disadvantge to move but in a closed area his breath\nis\n&gt; more deadly due to limited dodging space.&quot;3 Vs. a Army why can&#39;t we ever\n&gt; escape these odds!&quot;\n\nFoxfingers sees that he was wrong the whole time. He thought that he was the\nonly Maximal there and that the thought of destruction of the base would\ndamage more Preds. Now he sees the pointlessness of his gamble. Three lives\nlost on both sides would only cause death not victory.\n\n&quot;OK this has just become interesting,&quot; Foxfingers states ducking behind his\nnew protectors. He switches his visual to infra red and looks himself over.\nHe spots the tracking device on his shoulder. His mind floods with sneaky\nideas for the tracking device. He decides to leave it there for now as a\ncard to be discarded if his bluff folds. &quot;Easy boys&quot; he tells the two bots\nin front of him, &quot;The situations under control for now, lets not do anything\nto cause an eruption.&quot; He places a hand on the shoulder of each of the other\nMaximals (Koj&#39;s left and Inu&#39;s right.) drawing a cell sample from each. He\nrecognized them from the CF but was never formally introduced.\nriginal Message -----\nFrom: RYO D &lt;striderzero1@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, November 10, 2000 4:49 AM\nSubject: Firefox calm down.\n\n\n &gt; ::Koj::\n&gt; Koj fires off his jets trying to catch up with Firefox. &quot;Inu Come!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Inu::\n&gt; Inu stands up and takes after &quot;Takes off&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Koj::\n&gt; Koj lands next to Firefox &quot;Fox were with you on this no matter what\nhappens\n&gt; Maximals got to stick together!&quot; Koj ports shoot the halfs of the Fang.\nKoj\n&gt; grabs them and snaps the Lance together.Koj takes a 50/50 stance.
