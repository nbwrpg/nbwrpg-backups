You two! (points to Sinesis and\n&gt; Sinister) Go and get a lift, she will need to be moved to the lab and\n&gt; strapped down to a table.  She won&#39;t wake up for hours.  But when she\n&gt; does, she will be a handfull.  Let&#39;s get moved.&quot;  She loked at the\n&gt; pair again. &quot;Go and get me that lift. Now!&quot;\n&gt; She really didn&#39;t like giving orders, but Quickstrike had left her in\n&gt; charge.  She was trying to please Megatron by offering him a prize,\n&gt; this new bot.  But something in her felt wrong.  She looked at\n&gt; Dracona and saw part of herself laying there.  She didn&#39;t know why,\n&gt; but seeing the bot lay there brought lost images from her past back\n&gt; to her.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Life&#39;s too short to send boring email.
