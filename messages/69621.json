And for the first time, even though he could not see from hi=\r\ns eyes, it appears that he looks Rodimus in the eyes, as Optimus would have=\r\n done with Megatron many years ago.  His expression stoic, as was Optimus P=\r\nrime, and then out of nowhere he gives his reply.\n\n&quot; It doesn&#39;t have to com=\r\ne to this, Rodimus, but you leave me with no choice.  One shall rise, and o=\r\nne shall fall.&quot;  \n\nHis voice had always sounded like Optimus when he was hi=\r\ns age.  But now, at this moment, it sounded more and more like the legendar=\r\ny Autobot leader.   Now something inside him was coming alive.  A spirit th=\r\nat he had kept deep down within him and now it was emerging. He did not cow=\r\ner in shock at the thought of going toe to toe with Rodimus, although not t=\r\nhrilled with the idea, as Optimus would have felt the same way, going again=\r\nst one of his own, but he knew it had to be done.  Perhaps it was the first=\r\n step in hopefully recovering his lost leader.\n\n&quot; It&#39;s clear to me that you=\r\n have chosen the same path Megatron chose years ago.  A path that lead to h=\r\nis demise.  So, if this is the path you wish to take, then I fight you as a=\r\nn enemy.&quot;\n\nHis eyes do not narrow in rage, but take on a look of concentrat=\r\nion.  He&#39;d need it if he was going to go against Rodimus.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m ready.&quot;\n\n\n=\r\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&quot; Nothing comes easy, and I&#39;m aware of that. I&#39;m not here to take th=\r\ne easy way out. I said I&#39;d do anything it took to restore my leader, and I =\r\nam willing to stand by my pledge, no matter the cost to my own spark.
