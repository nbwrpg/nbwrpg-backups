I have a mission for you,&quot; he says, &quot;Are you in good enough\n&gt; condition to do some killing?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; A surge of electricity went through the bot that used to be Striker as\nBlaze\n&gt; flipped the switch. His optic sensors activated, the cealing coming into\n&gt; focus. Running through his data-tracks, the bot found out as much as it\ncould\n&gt; about himself.\n&gt;\n&gt; His name was Slayer. He was a ruthless killer, superior to all but his\n&gt; master, Prebon. Slayer slowly sat up, his head turning to look all the\nbots\n&gt; over. Inferior, Slayer thought as he scanned every face in the room,\nuntill\n&gt; he came to Prebon&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt; Slowly, Slayer got off the table, standing up on the floor next to it. He\n&gt; looked at Prebon, hardly bothering to pay any attention to the other bots.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Master,&quot; Slayer said, bowing his head to Prebon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
