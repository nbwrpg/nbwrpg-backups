And I&#39;m glad to know someone likes Tazz, \n&gt; Soulstice. Who do you think hit Stone Cold? It thinks it&#39;s either \n&gt; Billy Gunn, Tazz or Test.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois&#39; temper was getting to hot. Convix tried to calm him down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Control! You must control!\n&gt; \n&gt; But they are destroying peace!\n&gt; \n&gt; You can&#39;t kill them. Not yet atleast. But make the pain surge in \n&gt; them. Remember, when a bot tried to attack the Embassy. You fed the \n&gt; pain into his circuts of a death on Cybertron. Do it to all of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; All of them?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. I can help you.\n&gt; \n&gt; All right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois focused, using his energy to make a psycic link between him \n&gt; and the minds of his enemies. He tapped into the part of their body \n&gt; that registered pain. He messed with it, putting on the max right \n&gt; before death. He gave them an image with it. Everyone on Cybertron \n&gt; living peacefuly, as techno-organic creatures. Except for them. \nThey \n&gt; would burn in the Pitt forever, always experiencing torture.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Feel the pain that stands in th way of peace!&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; As he walked ot the cargo room, Prebon answered Slayer&#39;s question.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Who is she? Wouldn&#39;t you like to know. But no more speaking of the \n&gt; past. It&#39;s an order.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; But than, at the cargo room, he saw the hatred that was building \n&gt; between them. And then he realized it: Slayer isn&#39;t only different \n&gt; than Striker, he is the exact opposite. He loves what Striker \nhates, \n&gt; such as death and hatred. He hates what Striker loves: Spears. He \nhad to stop this.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Spears! Slayer! Enough! We are on this team together, and I will \nnot \n&gt; have this! If you have a problem with one another, you will deal \nwith \n&gt; it on your own time, and not through a way that would damage my top \n&gt; two recruits. Now, Slayer, try the suit on. It&#39;s made from a dead \n&gt; Maximal. Spears, come with me. We must talk.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Spears went just outside the cargo room.\n\n\n"}}
