The \npain was blinding. She lost her sence of where or what was happening. \nShe followed her program and tried to fly higher. They had already \nmanaged to reach 700 feet in a short time. Her huge wings flapped \nhard as she flew almost straight up with her burden of the other \nbot.  She climbed to almost 1000 feet when she could no longer \nstruggle with her load or against the pain and let him fall.\n\nHer body seemed slightly releived to no longer half to fly with that \nmuch weight. But the blast had done damage. Her wings started to \ntighten up and she too, started to fall. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : SharpClaw : :\n&gt; SharpClaw allowed himself to be captured in Battera&#39;s claw.
