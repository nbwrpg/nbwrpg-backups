He checks the computer again,\n&gt; seeing that Ignatius was awake.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ignatius, this is Slayer,&quot; he says into the comm to the fellow\n&gt; Trainer, &quot;We were defeated at the Iron Fist.

His wounds were\nhealing\n&gt; &gt; successfully and he&#39;d soon be ready to fight. He looked outside seeing\nthe\n&gt; &gt; other three chambers were empty. The Eaglebot stretched his wings far as\nhe\n&gt; &gt; could inside the cramped tank. He didn&#39;t know what happened he just knew\n&gt; &gt; that things were either better than he thought or as bad as he had\nfeared.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Computer, who is present in this base?&quot; he asked softly almost hoping\nit\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t respond.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Slayer is scanning on the bridge.&quot; it responded in an echoing mettalic\ntone\n&gt; &gt; fit for the voice of a hollow unfealing machine.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
