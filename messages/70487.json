I know I will be able to do this, and if any harm comes to me, then no=\r\nthing will be held against any of you but myself.  I will take full blame f=\r\nor what happens.  In Primus&#39;s speed my friends, in Primus&#39;s speed.  Good wi=\r\nll prevail, and the light will remain forever lit.  Now, let&#39;s do this befo=\r\nre we lose him.&quot;\n\nHe lies still to await hookup.\n\nOutside in the observatio=\r\nn room, it doesn&#39;t take Straight Shot long to see what is going on.  But de=\r\nep down she knew he was doing the right thing, she felt it too.  Night Shif=\r\nt could also feel what his comrade was up to, and a feeling of absolute pos=\r\nitivity comes over him as well.  Quickstride, however has the same feelings=\r\n as Noctorro and Bump.  But Rat Trap holds onto the positivity that Straigh=\r\nt Shot and Night Shift share as well as Silverbolt.\n\n&quot; I know wheels, he&#39;s =\r\ngonna make it, I know he is.  Somethn&#39; inside me tells me so and that doesn=\r\n&#39;t happen too often.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to him, and holds his hand.\n\n&quot;Yo=\r\nu feel it too, so do I.  He can do this, I know he can.  Silverbolt&#39;s right=\r\n, he can do this. We have to believe he can. It&#39;s our belief in him that&#39;s =\r\ngonna make him pull through.&quot;\n\nNight Shift keeps a finger crossed as he sta=\r\nnds next to Silverbolt.\n\n&quot;You feel it too, huh Silverbolt.  That deep down =\r\nfeeling that no matter what happens, good is gonna prevail.  It&#39;s real guys=\r\n, it&#39;s real.  Tucson Prime&#39;s got somethn&#39; inside him that I can&#39;t explain b=\r\nut it&#39;s there and it&#39;s gonna work.&quot;\n\nRat Trap chimes in.\n\n&quot; Just think, we&#39;=\r\nll have two Primes plus Lord Elder, and Lord Perseus on our side.  That&#39;s r=\r\neally gonna put a damper on lizard lip&#39;s day.  Ohh yeah, when we&#39;re all bac=\r\nk tagether, look out, because that golden age is just a few shots away.&quot;\n\nS=\r\ntraight Shot listens to him.\n\n&quot; And then maybe, just maybe we&#39;ll have somet=\r\nhing to celebrate.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;superc=\r\nyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He gently rubs her hands and then turn=\r\ns to the door, and turns an ear over to the others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but=\r\n I&#39;m the only one who can enter the room. Take heart, this is for the best,=\r\n and I know it will help Rodimus immensely. Something inside me is telling =\r\nme so.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He enters the room and gets his bearings so is not to knock=\r\n anything over or trip over anyone. His sensors quickly leading him to Rodi=\r\nmus as he finds his way over to where he lies. He then nods to Stanton and =\r\nthe others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;All right, tell me what I have to do and I will do it.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turns his head toward Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hang in there Rodimus,=\r\n I&#39;m comming. I promised to save you and I will save you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAs Tuscon entered the room Santon stepped out and guided him over\n&gt; towards=\r\n the bed. At the same time Legacy slid over another operating\n&gt; bed so that=\r\n it lay next to Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bump, who was still continuing to work freed =\r\nanother small portion of\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; frame and he quickly attached power all=\r\nocation cables to the\n&gt; spot.\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon nodded, satisfied at Bump&#39;s progr=\r\ness and then turned back to\n&gt; Tuscon, &quot;Rodimus&#39; life signs are beginning to=\r\n fail. We will need you\n&gt; to continue giving your unique spark energy to hi=\r\nm. This would give us\n&gt; more time to complete this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bump looked up fr=\r\nom his position over Rodimus, &quot;The problem is we\n&gt; don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;=\r\ns draining him, and we don&#39;t know what risk\n&gt; there is to you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon=\r\n looked back at Tuscon, &quot;He&#39;s right. If you don&#39;t want to do\n&gt; this, we wil=\r\nl understand. But if you do, then lie back and I will\n&gt; connect you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n*    *     *     *     *\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile in the observation room Silverbolt =\r\nstood once again silently\n&gt; observing Rodimus, his own optics dark and worr=\r\nied as Airhammer and\n&gt; Noctorro stood next to him. &quot;Have no fear Lady Talon=\r\n.&quot; Silverbolt\n&gt; said, his voice confident, &quot;The valiant Tuscon Prime will p=\r\nrevail.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; While Silverbolt seemed confident and assured, Airhammer and =\r\nNoctorro\n&gt; seemed to wear more worried expressions.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
