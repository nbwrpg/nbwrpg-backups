It wasn&#39;t the cold wasteland of snow and ice that she was \nnormally use to but the lack of prey had drove her to hunt in the warmer \nclimates.\nShe climbed down from the rock outlook and trotted out into the long \ngrasses, there was prey near by and she could smell it!\nZyber put her snout to the ground and began to follow the scent of wild \ngame, it didn&#39;t take her long to find a herd of gazelle that suited her \nliking.\nShe crouched down in the long grass and strained her muscles to get ready \nand run, she knew that these herbavor were fast!\nZyber was just about to pounce when she heard it...music.\nHe straightened up and looked around, it wasn&#39;t long until she saw what had \ncaused that lovely music...a bot!\nShe looked at the bot with her ears erect and forward, completely visible in \nthe long grass.\nThe gazelle saw the predator in the long grass and galloped away, leaving \nthe white wolf to stare in the other direction.*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
