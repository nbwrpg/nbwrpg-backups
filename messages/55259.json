Please, I am still \nfunctional. \n&gt; You will get me if you are in need of help.&quot; With that, she made \nher \n&gt; way to the CR chamber. Once there in the chamber room, she climbed \nin \n&gt; and let the maintenance bots help heal her wounds.\n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; She growled, hopped, jumped, leaped, ducked, rolled and twisted out \n&gt; of the way of Windlords shots. She sneered and fired her own \n25shotws \n&gt; back at them. She looked t Desctructor,&quot;I think we should find \ncover \n&gt; soon. Or else we will start to look like swiss energon.&quot; She looked \n&gt; at Rodimus, &quot;Can we get around to thier soft spot and attack from \n&gt; another location that might do more damage?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Windlord/Elita:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Elita saw Cam cry and licked her as if she tried to confort her, \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; Windlrd took the baby in arms and rock her.
