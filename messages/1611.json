He \nlanded on his chest, supported by his arms. He groaned in pain and squinted \nhis brightly glowing crimson eyes. He stared down at the ground, trying to \nthink how he was going to get himself out of this. How he was going to get \nhis repairs. He could always sneek himself into the Predacons base. The ship \nwould never warn Hell Beast and his troops that he was coming.\n\nHe turned himself on his back and looked at his horrific leg. He tilted his \nhead back until it almost touched the plate behind him. He was about to \nscream, but he forced himself not to. He couldn&#39;t warn anybody that he was \nhere. He was alone again, scared, wounded, and skittish on who would come to \nkill him. The pain on his body made him feel like he would pass out. He dug \nthe fangs on this left hand into the ground. He uttered a strange sound that \nsounded like a growl.\n\nWhy did that slag have to shoot his leg? Why couldn&#39;t he have gone for \nsomething else?\n\nSomebody help, he called out into his mind, but knew no one could hear him. \nBut maybe the clone of Tarantsulus could. So he called out into the ambient \nof his mind: Transulas, get yer keister out here!\n\nHe stayed by the trees, knowing if he was out in the open he would be \nkilled.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
