The pod\nstayed in statis mode for all this time. Now, as the programs dictate,\nthe bot awakens.  \n\nThe optics flicker. The hydrolics in the joints move.  The spark pumps\nmech fluid.  Power levels rise and programs reactive.  The life of the\nbot restarts and the Matrix wills another to join the fight of the\nuniverse for the universe. \n\nThe pod opens. A hand reaches up and lightly clasps the rim.  Sitting\nup, the bot looks about.  Blue sky, white clouds float over head.  The\nsun shines down warmth and light.  A gentle breeze caresses the face\nplates of the bot. A scent on the wind, barely noticible, but there\nall the same.  Causion stirs in the mind of the bot.  Optics focus,\nautio sencors adjust to listen for the slightest noise.  The bot\nstands up, not a sound is made.  She stands in white and gold\ntransmetal skin.  Her form small, yet powerful.  She looks up again. \nWith a sigh, transforms into BARN OWL form and takes to the skies. Not\na sound is made as she changes her shape.  She rises to just above the\ntree tops and slowly surveys her new home.  \n\nShe lets her talons spread as she glides down silently and perches on\na tree branch high in the trees.   She looks about her and wonders how\nshe came to be here.  She checks her programs, all seem to be\nfunctional except her mission logs where wiped out during her\ntransport.  On her left ankle, she could see a symbol. It was Maximal.\n But she knew not what it meant.  She searched her memory banks for\nher identity in hopes it would give her a clue as to why she was\nthere.  Her name, was &quot;SILENCE&quot;.   Her programmed instincts told her\nto seek out other maximals. Other than that, she knew not what to do.  \n\nShe spread her soft white wings and let her body take to the wind. \nHer form glided effortlessly back towards the pod.  She landed on the\nedge and with her beak, she hit the homing beacon on the pod.  A\nmaximal signal would be sent out. With luck, they would find her soon.\n With that accomplished, she flew up back into the trees and hid.  She\nknew that if maximals could find her signal, others might too.  She\nhid herself in the trees, but kept a sharp owl eye on the pod.  \nShe waited, she watched, in perfect...silence. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
