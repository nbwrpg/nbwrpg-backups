Five bots attacked the Iron \nFist and didn&#39;t put on a scratch, but over 30 bots attacked the CF. \nIts reasonable that they would do better.\n\nAnd you&#39;ve only been in the RPG for a fraction of the time it was \ngoing. The Alliance had had many defeats before, but less than the \nother factions because they don&#39;t have as much direct fighting. If \nthe Trainers would have attacked with over 30 bots, there would be no \ndoubt that the Alliance base would be either theirs or destroyed \nright now (more likely destroyed).\n\nNow, about Unitron and Firestarter: The hull was breached after the \nlockdown by Oblitertron, and the hole happened to lead into the \nbridge. Unitron and Firestarter entered that hole before Hysteria had \na chance to put a lockdown on the bridge and cover the hole with \nblast panels. She did that, however, and the hole is no longer an \nentrance. Unitron and Firestarter cleared the internal autoguns in \nthe bridge, which wasn&#39;t a hard task due to all the damage in the \nbridge, the bridge lockdown, and the lack of power that the CF is \nexperiencing. Vehement also helped them.\n\nInstead of complaining about the Alliance winning, people should be \nimproving the Maximals. I&#39;m as sick of this battle as everyone else, \nand I was leaving the Maximals alone, but (no offence), you decided \nto attack and continue the battle. So don&#39;t complain and do RP, \nbecause you brought this upon yourself.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Jason  lind&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; [ok I have a couple things to say. you all keep saying the ship is \non \n&gt; lockdown right then how the hell is Unitron and firestarter are \n&gt; inside.also if they are inside wouldn&#39;t the defense grid inside the \n&gt; CF would come online. also from the shields and autoguns outside \n&gt; would not be destroyed so easily. also no matter what the alliance \ndo \n&gt; they always get there way. How is that? I am not the only one \n&gt; thinking this. when the Ironfist was attacked not even a scrath was \n&gt; left on it. but when the alliance attacks everything gets blown up. \n&gt; whats up with that?]\n\n\n"}}
