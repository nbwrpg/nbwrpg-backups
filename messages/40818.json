He pulled up and changed his course,\n&gt;heading for Asia and his velocity increasing.\n&gt;\n&gt;He sent out a comm. to everyone who had fought along with the Neo Cons and\n&gt;the Neo Decepticons as well.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;This is Shockwave, we have done sufficient damage here, to continue would \n&gt;be\n&gt;a meaningless waste of resources.  Change your courses to the Ramora and\n&gt;increase your velocities.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Several shots dug into Unitron&#39;s frame, damaging it even worse.  This woke\n&gt;him up in time to hear Shockwave&#39;s retreat.  He painfully transformed into\n&gt;his space fighter mode, launching off towards the Ramora, not even stopping\n&gt;to take a few pot shots since he was eager to flee.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Firestarter executed the perfect barrel roll, the fusion blast flying under\n&gt;him, the shock wave of the blast lightly shaking Firestarter.  He launched\n&gt;off twenty rapid laser blasts at Forrior, changing his heading for Asia.\n&gt;&quot;Next time you Autobot wanna bes!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Two laser blasts and weapons fire form a proton cannon flew past the STAG \n&gt;as\n&gt;he performed a few aerial maneuvers, but it left himself open to catch a\n&gt;dozen bullets in the underbelly of his mode.  He transformed to his biped\n&gt;mode to keep from leaking to much mech-fluid.  He fired off a few optic\n&gt;blasts down at Starstomp, heading for Asia as he was ordered.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
