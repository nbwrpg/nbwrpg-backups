Come here !&quot; and looking at Leo Prime said &quot;If you\n&gt; excuse me few moments Leo Prime, I have to... exchange some words with Sky\n&gt; Shadow&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; the male moved some feet away and waited for Sky Shadow\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a grunt from LEO PRIME as he turned away, &quot;Make it quick.&quot;\nHe said, &quot;We have a mission to get to.&quot; He began to walk towards the\nfront of the group, his feline tail flicking in the air.\n\nMeanwhile SKYSHADOW glanced at HYDRAS and then walked over to him.\n&quot;What is it sir?&quot; He said, his voice full of innocence. &quot;I thought you\nwere ready to begin.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, DINOBOT and CRYOTEK were obviously escorting HYDRAS, and it\n&gt; was unknown to DINOBOT if LEO PRIME had managed to detect the two stealthed\n&gt; PREDACON units of VICE GRIP and BLACKARACHNIA.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pausing then, and taking note of the MAXIMAL AERIAL ESCORTS.  While the\n&gt; escort of MAXIMALS was too heavy for a plotted assassination attempt, but\n&gt; with communications seemingly down according to what was being said over the\n&gt; area, if the MAXIMAL LEADER LEO PRIME could be split apart from his escorts,\n&gt; then perhpas he could be overwhelmed..  AT the ver least, an amusing thing\n&gt; to contemplate.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, in the trees BLACKARACHNIA kept her myriad optics in her spider\n&gt; mode peeled, glancing up at the aerial Maximals while she languidly thought\n&gt; about how she could disable thier wingspans.  But, quite simply they were\n&gt; too BIG for her to take out even from ambush and with luck on her side and\n&gt; cut off from support.  LEO PRIME had chosen his backup well, and there would\n&gt; be nos neak strike.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just what would they find over out there, and what would they be going after\n&gt; now?  SHe would watch and wait carefully before revealing herself.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
