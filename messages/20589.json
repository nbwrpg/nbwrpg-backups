Netscape hasn&#39;t been very nice to me lately, \nbut everything seems alright now^_^)\n\nWhen Tavatron touched the energy coil a flood of thoughts and scattered \nmemories filtered through her I-Comp. Most of them were lost, but a select \nfew remained. Dinobot was upset about something, but what it was puzzled \nher. She was there, by his side, still�\n\nThen it dawned on her. He knew she had left. Tavatron hung her head as she \nsighed. There was so much about him she did not know, so much she had yet to \nunderstand. She had failed him when it had been her turn to stand by his \nside, both as a friend and a fellow warrior. She had acted cowardly, and \ndone the only thing she knew how to do whenever something like this had \nhappened. She panicked. If there had been something, anything she could have \ndone she would have.\n\nThe thought never occurred to her that the wolf �bot�s mere presence could \nhave been enough. Last time she had kept running, this time she came back. \nPerhaps if he would just ask her WHY she had left� no, deep down she knew he \ndidn�t want an explanation, and she really didn�t want to give one. He was \nconcerned with what she had done, not with why she had done it.\n\nThere was no excuse that could possibly make amends for what she had done. \nHer actions, however, did not warrant an attack on her honor. She was tired; \nexhausted both mentally and physically. It took her several moments to just \nprocess what he had said. So, in his eyes she was no longer a warrior? This \none phrase cut her more deeply than an energon blade ever could. Whether or \nnot he had meant it to mean just that did not concern her. She had taken it \nto mean he thought even less than what she thought of herself right now.\n\nShe wanted to yell, but couldn�t think of anything to say that wouldn�t end \nup with them impaled on each other�s swords/claws. The room seemed to dim \nslightly as Tavatron raised her head. The look that met her tired gaze was \nall she needed to confirm what she already thought. She had lost his \nrespect. Very well, if he no longer saw her as a warrior than why should he \nconcern himself with her welfare any longer? Dinobot had no idea just how \nmuch damage that one phrase, tone, and look had just done. Perhaps this was \nwhat he wanted. Tavatron stood at attention, her arms plastered to her \nsides. Her eyes were level, gazing directly forward. Her voice never wavered \nas she spoke in a monotonous, steady pitch. A voice she used only when \naddressing those above her, or when she thought it best not to let her real \nemotions show:\n\n&quot;I apologize for my earlier behavior. I assure you it will not happen \nagain.&quot;\n\nHe no longer had respect for her, so why should she address him as if they \nwere friends? It was amazing how quickly he could change his attitude toward \nothers, and expect the rest of the world to change with him. He acted as if \nhe were the only one suffering; the only one who had ever lost something \nthey truly cared about. Well, if he ever did care about her at least now he \nwouldn�t have to worry about losing this fem �bot anymore. She had tried her \nbest. She had tried to be nice, compassionate, even at times more like him. \nAll she ever got in return was the occasional glare of disapproval. At times \nhe had opened himself up to her, but it was too little too late. She was \ntired. Tired of trying to change what obviously was set in its ways:\n\n&quot;Beast mode.&quot;\n\nPart of her wanted to stay, to argue this out, but he had crossed the line.\n\n*I thought I knew him better�*\n\nTavatron thought solemnly as she turned to look behind her. The icy glare \nthat she gave him was enough to chill the warmest of fires. Then again, his \nspark was coated in ice, so why should he even care?\n\n*I guess I was wrong.*\n\nTavatron trotted out of the CR room, her head held level with the rest of \nher body. Once she was sure she was out of his sight she broke into a jog \nthen a wild run. She needed time to think. She needed to collect her \nthoughts, and figure out what had just happened. If he followed her�\n\nNo, he wouldn�t. That would mean he�d have to apologize for what had been \nsaid. He had made it clear she was at fault, so why should he apologize? \nTavatron bolted through the CF�s entrance, her mind racing. She eventually \nstopped running, finding herself where she had been only hours ago. The \nstump of the tree she had cut down while practicing seemed to taunt her, \njust daring her to continue her solo battling. Tavatron continued forward at \na steady pace until she came to a cliff overlooking a vast forest.\n\nShe was a good ways from the CF now, but that was partially due to the fact \nshe had been running at top speed. Her spark was racing and her legs sore \nfrom the run. Tavatron ignored all of this as she sat on her haunches, \nraised her muzzle heavenward and howled. It was a long, mournful howl, one \neven she didn�t know the meaning of. It surprised her that such a sound \ncould originate from her hollow throat. But it did, and in essence it was \nthe epitome of everything she had been feeling. All her sorrow, anger and \nhurt was summed up in one, plaintive howl.\n\nThe sound carried on the wind until it eventually died out. There was no \nreply, nor had she expected any. Tavatron lay her head down upon crossed \npaws as she watched the trees below her blow gently in the wind. This was \nexactly the kind of solitude and self-pity that got her stranded on this \nrock. However, Dinobot wouldn�t know that now, would he? He was too involved \nwith his own problems. Perhaps she had acted a little rash, but if she meant \nanything to him at all he would come after her. But Tavatron knew better. He \nwouldn�t come. Why should he? She had abandoned him, twice. Only this time \nshe wasn�t afraid, just disappointed.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
