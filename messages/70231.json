More and more he felt most confiden=\r\nt in Rodimus&#39;s abilities to return to his leadership duties.  He had held b=\r\nack hoping Rodimus would make the right decision, to his assurance he had. =\r\n He nodds in agreement of getting out of there, and also respects Perceptor=\r\n&#39;s wish to have his feedom of choice.  And then he gets the all clear from =\r\nDark Hawk to help him.  Tucson Prime kneels down and gently picks him up, a=\r\nnd carefully, without hurting him, places the stasis cuffs on Darkhawk. \n\n&quot;=\r\n All right, Dark Hawk is sedated and securred.  The way you&#39;re speaking of =\r\nPerceptor better be a safe route. I don&#39;t wish to endanger the lives of any=\r\none, especially Darkhawk who is seriously injured.  If you deviate from thi=\r\ns route you speak of, you&#39;ll have me to answer to.  And believe me, you do =\r\nnot want to catch me in a bad mood.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right Mr.=\r\n Shadey, he don&#39;t take no nonsense from anyone.  Now, let&#39;s make it outa he=\r\nre in one piece while we still can&quot;.\n\nTucson directs an ear toward Rodimus.=\r\n\n\n&quot; Good work Rodimus.  Your decisions would have also been mine.  I now be=\r\nlieve that soon enough you will be able to assume leadership duties.&quot;\n\nOuts=\r\nide, with Straight Shot&#39;s coming online once more, Rat Trap senses another =\r\nAutobot signature appearing on his list of active Maximals and Autobots.  H=\r\ne looks to Legacy.\n\n&quot; Legacy, correct me if I&#39;m wrong but my energy signatu=\r\nre reading&#39;s just picked up the pressense of another Autobot.  Hmm, wonder =\r\nwho it is...&quot;\n\nHe pulls of a profiler on his gauntlett device, and drums up=\r\n Straight Shot.\n\n&quot;Ooooh Primus, things are gonna get interestn&#39; at the Ark.=\r\n  It&#39;s another femme bot, and this one&#39;s got some spunk.. And a fist full o=\r\nf arrows...  Umm, wouldn&#39;t wanna insult her that&#39;s for sure...&quot;\n\nAt the Ark=\r\n..  \n\nStraight Shot manages to find a supply of energon and gets herself en=\r\nough to get back on her feet.  She sips on it slowly as she now gains more =\r\nstrength throughout her body.  She walks over to Elita.  It had been a long=\r\n time since she had seen her last.  She was elated to see how much she had =\r\ngrown and shows her elation through a smile.\n\n&quot; Elita, it&#39;s been a long tim=\r\ne, I missed you.&quot;\n\nShe then looks to Lord Elder.  She had met him at one ti=\r\nme, but did not get the chance to really know him.\n\n&quot;Lord Elder, Right?  It=\r\n&#39;s been a long time, and I think we were introduced a while ago, but, maybe=\r\n ya don&#39;t remember who I am.  If not, I&#39;m Straight Shot, Tucson&#39;s half sist=\r\ner and his all time favorite weapon of choice.  But we&#39;re not cheating, he =\r\ndoes all the aiming and firing when he uses me.  Oh, yeah, ya might not kno=\r\nw that part. My alt modes are Cross Bow and regular bow.  So, um, speakn&#39; o=\r\nf my half brother..  He is okay right?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;=\r\nairly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup/Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;ME!!! an autobot????&quot;laughte=\r\nd Perceptor as if had heard a Joke&quot;If as \n&gt; Predacon I felt bored sometimes=\r\n... as Autobot, I would be a thousand more&quot; \n&gt; then he said gloomy and caml=\r\ny walked towards the tunnel that he cames \n&gt; from&quot;Yes, you and Nightlight w=\r\nere a refreshing change for me...
