However, there were some MAJOR holes there, so I\n&gt; had it taken down and I modified it. Turns out the Chivs are in the\n&gt; Rockies. I&#39;m not even going to guess how an elephant could get there.\n&gt; Just not realistic, yes? So I&#39;m going to post the modified version me\n&gt; and Mr. Rauq (THANK GOD FOR HIM!) came up with. I&#39;ll be there to help\n&gt; out the Chivi&#39;s in no time flat... couple of posts.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
