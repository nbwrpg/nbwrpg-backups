Plintissa\n&gt; &gt; gasped and looked around, no Suukie in sight.\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa walked over and\n&gt; &gt; grabbed the note off of Stronghold, who never ceased\n&gt; &gt; his card game.\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa read it and found that Suukie was at the\n&gt; &gt; Predacon base to prove\n&gt; &gt; himself because he had been a burden the time he was\n&gt; &gt; repairing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;All right, troops! line up!&quot; Plintissa ordered.\n&gt; &gt; Dracona walked into line,\n&gt; &gt; and then Airbomber, then Stranato, then Train Wreck,\n&gt; &gt; then Arrow, and then,\n&gt; &gt; with a little persuasion, Scamrock and Stronghold.\n&gt; &gt; Sinesis and Sinister came\n&gt; &gt; walking up, looking angrier than ever before!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Panthyria, you can help us if you wish to, we need\n&gt; &gt; help, we have to go to\n&gt; &gt; the Pred base and battle the Predacons, Suukie is\n&gt; &gt; there and he&#39;s going to be\n&gt; &gt; killed if we don&#39;t do anything, so lets MOVE IT!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa ordered.
