However, since his brain \nactivity was slowly returning it would send a shock through his systems to \nreactivate them, an overhaul.\n\nBut, even with his brain inoperative, his consciousness was still intacked \nand completely functional:\n\nThere was nothing but darkness from what he could tell, eventually testing \nthe blackness by trying to see if he could see his hand in front of his \nface�he couldn�t.\nHe looked all about him, but it was all as pitch black as molten tar.\nBut then, all of a sudden and completely out of nowhere he heard a scream. \nOne so loud and bloody piercing that he had to cover his receptacles in \norder to keep them from cracking and deactivating.\nAs soon as she scream died away he cautiously removed his hands from the \nside of his head and looked around slightly, wondering where that scream had \ncome from and who or what had caused it.\nBut there was still nothing other then the darkness surrounding him, \nsuffocating him like a wool blanked covering a new born child�s face.\nHowever, a fear slowly crept into his spark, threatening to cease it�s \nbeating pulse. He recognizes the sound of that cream, or what he had been \nable to hear of it. It was Tavatrons.\nBut where was she�where was HE?\nPerhaps if he could somehow figure out where he was, he could find a way to \nget out of there and locate Tavatron? But first he had to find out \nwhere,�there� was.\n\nDinobot was just about to begin to wander around when there was a sudden \nflash of light, causing him to stumble and fall onto his back. Instinctively \ncovering his optics with a hand and keeping still. A roaring filled his \nsense as he lay there, waiting for everything to stop so he could at least \nsee what was doing on�but the light kept his optics closed and protected \nfrom what was happening around him.\nBut then, all in one breath�it all stopped. The spinning, the roar, the \nlight just�all ceased to be.\nDinobot let out the breath he had been holding in one long sigh, slowly \nremoving his hand from his face and opening his optics tentatively�and \nalmost gasped at what he saw.\nMillions upon millions of stars!\nAll sparking like a billion diamonds lying on a black velvet cloth, each \nvarying from the size of a large diode to that of the smallest dot, barely \nvisible.\nAll there, right infant of him, or�above him.\n\nThere was a sudden slight tickling sensation along every side of his body as \nhe felt a cool breeze sweep over his exostructure, turning hie head to see \njust what it is�only for his optics to turn and see the long green grass \nthe�surrounded him?\nDinobot sat up slowly and surveyed the land around him, surprised to see \nhimself sitting in a fast field of waving grass, African trees outlining a \nforest edge in the far distance and a small herd of zebra just before the \ntrees.\nHe felt his stomach clench and growl loudly as he counted the number of \nplain creatures, turning his head to look down as he gave it a small pat to \nkeep it quite�but his hand froze before he could do so�his optics widening \nin surprise.\nThis wasn�t what he was use to seeing�well�not from what he remembered \nbefore he was damaged and had blacked.\nInstead of a silver outline structure and clawed transmetal hands�there he \nsaw the three fingered and two thumbed hand of his old organic mode, his \nchest the flattened head of the brown and black velociraptor instead of the \nfamiliar red and silver.\nHis optics turned and looked down the remainder of his body, seeing that it \nwas the same past mode as he remembered. And as he felt slightly alien in \nthe transmetal 2 body�he felt truly at home in this one.\nWith a relaxing sigh he stretched his arms and felt the organic muscle move \nunderneath the synthetic skin, then with a heave he pulled himself to his \nfeet and stretched again, enjoying every bit of it.\nIn all his life, he would have never guessed he would be so glad to be back \nin this rusting, battle scared, war toned body of his again�but he was. And \nit felt great!\n\nHis stomach rumbled once again but the craving of water to quench a growing \nthirst stung his throat first, his optics quickly finding a watering hole \nthat happened to be rather close to the herd of zebra as well.\nWith words he knew more well then the wheel of time he transformed into hie \nBeast Mode, feeling even stronger muscles clench at his legs and arms.\nNow, this was more then he could have ever asked for.\nStarting towards the clear water a mile or two away he thought of just how \nthis was so different then that transmetal body, how it felt so much better \nto feel warm and hard muscle work your joints instead of the wires and main \nturbines of the TM2 mode.\n\nHowever, even as he made his way towards the watering hole he suddenly heard \nthe same scream as he had heard before, before all of the commotion had \noccurred and he had ended up here�in this wonderful place. He had almost \nforgotten that he was to seek her out, and that was just what he was going \nto do now�slag the water. He had to find Tavatron!\n\nDinobot growled deeply in his organic throat as he then switched course and \nsoon found himself at a full run towards the direction that the scream had \ncome from.\nIt wasn�t long before he came over a grassy ridge and finally saw her, \nstrapped to a long wooden pole , not moving at all.\nHe quickly transformed into robot mode and got down the small his as fast as \nhe could without falling, finally reaching its base and looking around. Now, \nsomebot had to have put her up there, and they could be around there still.\nBut he proceeded, still wondering just who had put her up and tied her upon \nthe wooden stake.\nJust as he approached the stake the image of Tavatron raised her head \nslightly and looked at him, not a speck of emotion on her face.**\n\n� Who did this?�\n\n** The image looked at him with optics that suddenly looked weak and \npitiful, and if he had been any less a cold slag he would have hugged her \nand hoped that she would cheer up. However, the words the came from her \nthroat chilled him.**\n\n� You did��\n\n** Dinobot looked confused for a moment, wondering if she had just been \ndelirious from lack of sleep or something to that effect, knowing that the \nbags under her optics was more then just appearance.\nHe reached over to try and see if he could rip off one of the ropes which \nheld her to the stake when a soft voice spoke up, it seeming to come from \neverywhere at once.**\n\nV: � You hid your feelings for her, you refuse to admit that there is at \nleast one bot in the universe that cares for you.�\n\n** Dinobot took his hands away from the ropes as he turned around and looked \nall about him, trying to see if he could somehow locate the source of the \nvoice�but he could not. It spoke again.**\n\nV: � Your lack of self freedom binds her to one level of your mind, making \nit almost impossible for you to feel more for her other then simple \nfriendship.�\n\n** Then, all of a sudden everything went up in a blaze as bright and fierce \nas any inferno straight out of the pits of hell. Everything disappearing \ninstead of the rising flames.\nDinobot shielded his optics from the light a sudden searing pain splitting \nthrough his entire body, the scene around him wavering for a moment, until \nfinally everything went back to the blackness with which he had first \nknown�only his own voice ringing back in the darkness.**\n\n� There is no reason�what is blind cannot see��..�\n\n**( Back in the CR room) His body suddenly convulsed quickly, his transmetal \n2 claws digging into the metal surface of the table�and kept digging even \nafter the remainder of the body lay still.\nA sudden blurt from his internal computer ringing across the room.**\n\nI COMP: Neural activity has increased to precisely 78%. Mech-fluid level now \nat 83%. Repair system activated�\n\n** And with that his spark cavity opened to reveal a rapidly beating spark�a \ngreen light soon forming within its depths and a few repair coils exiting to \nwrap themselves around Dinobots chest, beginning the slow process of \nrepairs.\nHowever, with a muffled groan due to the tubes down his throat, Dinobot \nopened his optics slightly, though still not able to see through them quite \nyet.\nBut then his stomach heaved a bit, finding himself weakly choking on the \ntubes as he tried to bring in a breath on his own. Still not fully awake.**\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
