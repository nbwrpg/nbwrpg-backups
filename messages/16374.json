We have a five bot group right now, Destructor \n&gt; makes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; six, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dollen and GoldenEye will be back soon theres eight add the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alliance \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forces and we&#39;ll have a small army working with us, and \nthen, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; followers will join us or fall before us, and Megatron will \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first victim.&quot; Phobias eyes lit up at the prospect of being \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behind the bot who joined the forces of Predacon and \n&gt; Alliance, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the unknown shadow that the great leaders throughout \nhistory \n&gt; &gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cast. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She thought about the situation.

And \nwhy \n&gt; &gt; did \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; help us? No Pred would just help and expect nothing in \n&gt; &gt; return. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if Megatron is without followers, who does that leave us \n&gt; &gt; with? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heard that most of our groups is gone.&quot;  She looked down \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sighed. &quot;I know that I can only trust you and Drillbit \n&gt; right \n&gt; &gt; &gt; now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She looked up at Phobia.  &quot;I think it would be best if we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; takled \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this Desctuctor.
