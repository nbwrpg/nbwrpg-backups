She was extremely \nmad at herself for not realizing. For letting her soft side undermine \nher better judgement. For thinking that there ever was such a thing \nas friends and true loyal followers. She looked at Destructor. &quot;Do \nthe backround on the others. I want everything checked.  I may not be \nperfect, but I won&#39;t make the same mistake twice.&quot;  She looked at \nDeath. &quot;Kill the little things. Kill then make sure they do not come \nback. Get rid of each and every one of those spiders.&quot; Her voice \nfilled with anger, hatred and hurt.  She felt completely betrayed.  \nShe didn&#39;t ever want that feeling again.  And from now on, she wasn&#39;t \ngoing to take chances. She looked at Destructor. &quot;Please show me what \nyou had accomplished with the replicators.
