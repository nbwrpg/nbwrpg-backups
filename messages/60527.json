Not in pain, but rage.  Her arms were not severed, but just \nas useless.  They hung limply at her sides, as she fell back, two \nSweeps came and picked up their master.  Another came and picked up \nthe critically damaged Organics.  The Sweeps carried them into the \nair and hung, as a Sweep attempted to repair Hellplague&#39;s arms.\n\nOrganics nearly passed out as Proto launched his ambush.  Though he \nsucceeded in disabling Hellplague, an edge of th metal sheet dug deep \ninto Organics&#39; back, disabling her wings and limited the use of her \nlegs.  The Sweep who retrieved her roughly grabbed her about he waist \nand jerked her with it.  \n\nNecross rushed up and and opened fire with his acid blaster and \nmissile blaster.\n\nMalice let a low gowl slip fom his throat.  \n&quot;If only I had Sunstorm or other Seekers..!  This has gone on far too \nlong!&quot;\nMalice turned his hateful glare to those who did not move.\n&quot;Stay back cowards!  Interfer, and I send you to the Allspark!&quot;\nHe then marched forward, Chaos Breaker ready, and charged the \nminions, Proto, and the Sweeps, not caring who was in his way.  All \nthat mattered was the safe return of his sister Organics.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, aerosmith4e@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Proto&#39;s liquid form had been following cracks and sensing his \ntaget until he was there. Without sound or warning his body became \nsharp metal sheet expanding 12 feet upwards right directly under the \narmpits of the minion.\n&gt; &gt; Malice/ Organics/ Hellplague/ Splattercannon:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bounty hunter dis engaged the cannon and returned it to it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; sword state.  He held it at the ready and slowly approached the \n&gt; &gt; hostage takers.  His body continued to glow brightly, even though \na \n&gt; &gt; signifigant amount of power went into his cannon blast.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;Just hurry up and help!&gt; Organics thought as Nightlight \n&gt; &gt; acknowlegded.  She was injured, in enemy hands, and now almost \n&gt; &gt; unconscious.  Hellplague had her off the ground, her feet mere \n&gt; &gt; inches from the dirt.  Malice was on his steady advance, and \nstopped \n&gt; &gt; standing next to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Sweep commander sneered as Malice approached.  She tightened \nher \n&gt; &gt; hold on Organics&#39; neck, causing her more discomfort.  \n&gt; &gt; &lt;Soon, Unicron will have the Matrix Bearer, a new follower, and I \n&gt; &gt; will have my lizard as a pet.&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague chuckled, and leered down at Malice.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, come here.  Bow down before me, worship me, and I might \nspare \n&gt; &gt; your sister.  Become my servant, and all will be forgiven.&quot; she \n&gt; &gt; laughed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Splattercannon took position behind the hostage takers, holding \nhis \n&gt; &gt; gatling rifle ready to waste anyone who moved without permission.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight/BlackNightmare/Hydras/Windlord/Rodimus:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord still was aimed to HellPlague&#39;s head and readi to take \n&gt; &gt; any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chance to save Organics.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; **********\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus opened a com lin to Proto and said &quot;What ever you will \ndo \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to hurt her&quot; after the com lik was closed he looked \nat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; HellPlague and tried to find out quickly what to do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *********\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BlackNightmare was pleased with the idea of hostage and \nsaid &quot;Then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we have to give this little gift to Unicron... perhaps he could \n&gt; &gt; give \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her a perfect use...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightstrike whispered &quot;Why not take Prime???? it&#39;s most wort \nthan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this one and it seems that he&#39;s most than willing to be a \n&gt; &gt; voluntary \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hostage...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; **********\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras picked up the com link and looking to MAxima said &quot;Come \nlil \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one... we will have some fun after all&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And leaves the base\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; **********\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nigthlight/Sedna picked up the com link and send aencoded \nmessage \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Organics &quot;Hold on...
