Her mind was dreaming of past times. In her sleep, \nshe muttered, &quot; No, I don&#39;t want to go mommy. I can fight. I won&#39;t \nget rust sickness. Honest, I can stay, please let me stay mommy.&quot;  \nShe whimpered a bit and calmed down. \n\n\nWolfblade::\nShe moved and rolled onto her back to see what had scratched her. It \nwas Elita. She gently put her arm around the little sleeping bot and \nsighed. SHe very gently stroked Elita&#39;s head and shoulders and \nwondered how long the little bot had been there.  She thought to \nherself, Why do kids come around bots who have little to no \nexperience with kids? I wonder if they do it on purpose just to raise \na bot&#39;s oil pressure.\nShe turned her head to see that Malice had a little one sleeping at \nhis side as well.  She wondered why the kids came to his room to \nsleep. THen something else occured to her. If kids could sneek in to \nthis place, how easy would it be for an enemiy to sneek in and kill \nthem. Especially when they were sleeping. This thought disturbed her \nenough to not let her fall back to sleep. She would wait for the kids \nto wake up, then address the matter with Malice. \n\n\n"}}
