Well now, seeing as how the RPG seems incapcitated \nand \n&gt; dewboy \n&gt; &gt; is back in some shape or form, and also because people have been \n&gt; asking where \n&gt; &gt; I am. I think its time to return to the RPing in NBWRPG. \nHowever... \n&gt; first \n&gt; &gt; things first... Dewboy shut the hell up. You got banned for not \n&gt; following \n&gt; &gt; rules, just having chars pop up any which way, doing things \nwithout \n&gt; asking \n&gt; &gt; the council, and above all else just plain being a complete \nidiot. \n&gt; Noone \n&gt; &gt; cares about mustex or stallex and what their supposeblys going to \n&gt; do, and \n&gt; &gt; noone cares about Rhesus who doesn&#39;t exist since he never \nappeared \n&gt; and even \n&gt; &gt; the council said he didn&#39;t. Whee another thing now, my next post \nis \n&gt; going to \n&gt; &gt; be evil... very very very evil.... Airly if you don&#39;t like what \nis \n&gt; going to \n&gt; &gt; happen in it to blacknightmare, too bad. You got her into whats \n&gt; going to \n&gt; &gt; happen and you understood it when I told you OOC and went along \nwith \n&gt; it. Oh \n&gt; &gt; and the next post is going to be so very evil... very very \nevil... \n&gt; oh \n&gt; &gt; yeah.... since the infecticons and Vile Force havent been heard \nfrom \n&gt; in god \n&gt; &gt; knows when, I think I have some time to work with... yessss....\n\n\n"}}
