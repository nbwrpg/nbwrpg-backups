To start out, \nread one of your recent post:\n\n...they walked off together, coming to the Maximal base, and using a \nnew device stolen from somewhere to dig under and into the \nArk.......they destroyed all of the autoguns, becoming decently \ndamaged in the process...they smiled at each other and searched until \nthey found the secret location of the Autobots...\n\nOk, now: the fact that Plintissa and Sinesis used &#39;a new device  \nstolen from somewhere to dig under the Ark&#39; and destroyed all the \nautoguns in one e-mail is severe moding in the first place. You \ndidn&#39;t give anyone else a chance to respond. If you would have, \nthough, your little mission would have been impossible due to the \ndozen or so maximals in the Ark at this point. Second, if you would \nremember, Blue Stinger got the Autobots out of the Ark, so finding \nthem there would be phisically impossible. Over all, if you would \nhave done this properly, you&#39;d be stopped by the shields, slagged by \nthe autoguns, and chased off by the maximals that were there.\n\n\n"}}
