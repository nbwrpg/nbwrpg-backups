Ignatius put Spears in one CR Chamber,\n&gt; and than put himself in another. Prebon laid Striker on a table. He\n&gt; called to Blaze.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Where are Bullet and Hammer?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They are in the cargo room, building a new war suit.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oh. You knw how to do this though, right?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yeah, I did it a few times before I met you, and the only time I\n&gt; didn&#39;t when I was in your command was for Bullet. He didn&#39;t see your\n&gt; vision.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Good. It&#39;s time for Striker here to join us. I want all his programs\n&gt; revised so that he gives all loyalty to me. And when that&#39;s done, put\n&gt; him n the CR. He&#39;ll need massive repairs.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Blaze got to work re-programming Striker, while Prebon ent and looked\n&gt; out the main screen. He would have to revise his plan. He would have\n&gt; to find another way to control the Maximals. When Ramulus comes, they\n&gt; would ambush him and kill him. Than, with the Maximals all confused\n&gt; and scared, they would attack, with their new warrior Striker had the\n&gt; lead. They would be no match for this surprise attack, and they would\n&gt; fall, and they would all be re-programmed or given the chip. Either\n&gt; way, Prebon wins. He let out a maniacal laugh and walked away.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gotcha!&quot; he said to Zardus, as he went to jet mode and targeted\n&gt; Astral. He went up into the air, and than dived straight down with\n&gt; his lasers firing at Astral.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Gotron\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Alright! Come on, let&#39;s get moving.&quot; Gotron started galloping\n&gt; towards the Probe.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois took a small vile of liquid that was sitting on a shelf. He\n&gt; poured it on Eagle Eye&#39;s body, and the body began to melt and merge\n&gt; with the rock.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It is sad. Their will be no Matrix for Eagle Eye. His spark was\n&gt; destroyed when he touched the evil Serpent AngelNemesis. But atleast\n&gt; his body can merge with this world, that he tried to bring peace too.\n&gt; How many of my friends will have to be lost before my mission is\n&gt; complete? HOW MANY!?!&quot; Vulois left the room and entered his, locking\n&gt; the door.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix and Fliq inserted their chips and looked at the group.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Alright!
