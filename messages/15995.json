Watching Spears kiss him must be \nmaking Striker lose all hopee. Prebon eally had no interest in Spears \nbecause he had a bot back home, but he would do anything to see bots \nsuffer. And on top of that, Spears didn&#39;t even realize that she was \nhurting Striker.\n\n&quot;Yes, let us go to the bridge, so we can map out how to get Ramulus.&quot;\n\nHe kissed her on the cheek, laughin on the inside about Striker, took \nher by the arm and started walking towards the bridge.\n\n\n"}}
