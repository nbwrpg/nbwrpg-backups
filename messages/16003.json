His side was leaking mechfluid from the attack, but it was nothing his \ninternal repairs couldn&#39;t handle. He growls as he wathces Spears and Prebon \nwalk away, his mind working over what Prebon had said.\n\nHe looks up at the camera, frowning. His scanners had completed their scan on \nthe chip, all he had to do was get the info to the Maximals. He frowns, \nthinking of Prebon&#39;s promise to clear his memory. There was no way he was \ngoing to forget Spears, not without going to the Matrix and back first.\n\n&quot;Computer,&quot; he silently orders his internal systems, &quot;If I go unconscious, \nself destruct, no countdown.&quot;\n\nStriker looks back at the door, trying to think of a plan to escape, and save \nSpears as well.\n\n"}}
