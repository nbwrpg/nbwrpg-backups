The \n&gt; fact that he cared deeply for Rodimus and was willing to even work with \n&gt; the Autobots and Maximals to try and retrieve him.  Even in the throws of \n&gt; confrontation, she couldn&#39;t help but put a gentile hand on his shoulder, \n&gt; being careful not to be too rough.  She gives him a re assuring smile.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry Perceptor, where there&#39;s a will there&#39;s a way.

Being a large truck, Tucson \n&gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; far too heavy to go too fast in such a short length of time, so 0 to 60\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sounds just about right.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson didn&#39;t care about surface or internal damage at this time, he \n&gt;&gt; &gt; was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; far more concerned about keeping his comrades safe from harm. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride\n&gt;&gt; &gt; quickly goes top side to see if Talon needs assistance as Straight Shot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; quickly attends to Perceptor.  Both of which find themselves attempting \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ward off the enemy with either arrow or high powered gun fire.  The\n&gt;&gt; &gt; insects atop Tucson were posing a major threat to Legacy and Talon, as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride tries desperately to back them up, shooting repeatedly to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attempt to get the enemy off Tucson&#39;s trailer before they did any harm \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; his comrades.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Woahh, a little more pest control than I bargained for! Legacy, Talon,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you two okay?!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot too, finds herself firing off arrows just to try and slow\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the insect beings down, while she desperately tries to help Perceptor.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; That does it!  I wish these ugly bugs would turn around and get\n&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves caught in a spider web!  Hang in there Perceptor, I got your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; back!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson was becomming more and more annoyed by the insects.  Something \n&gt;&gt; &gt; had\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to be done before they destroyed his comrades.  He felt it was HIS\n&gt;&gt; &gt; responsibility to see to the welfare of his fellow Autobots and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Maximals.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He was the one in charge of their well being.  He hoped by attempting a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sonar blast attack, he could immoblize the bug brigade.  It would be a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; bold move on his part, and this he knew would hurt Perceptor immensely,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; since he was a predacon.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Perceptor, I need you to turn off your audio sensors for a short time.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m going to attempt a sonar blast which I hope will slow things down \n&gt;&gt; &gt; for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; us enough to get to Rodimus.  That way I know I will not harm you when \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; do emit this attack. Straight Shot, when I&#39;m through doing that, tap \n&gt;&gt; &gt; him\n&gt;&gt; &gt; on the shoulder to let him know it&#39;s safe to turn them back on.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; She nodds.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Roger that Tucson Prime.  Okay Perceptor, to be on the safe side, it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; best if you shut down your audio sensors now.  I&#39;ll tap you on the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; shoulder when we&#39;re all finished.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;supercyclonus&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry, the image did not come through right. let me post it here \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; directly\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on the website, it might come through better. :)??\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; * = Wall of tunnel\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (1-7) numbers are insect troopers (1&2 are actually on Tuscon)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; S=Straight shot (Inside Tuscon&#39;s Cab)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Q=Quickstride (Inside Tuscon&#39;s Cab)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; T=Talon (On top of Tuscon)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Legacy (On Top of Tuscon)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; P=Perceptor (Driver&#39;s side rear)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *     1  2     *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *     ____     *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *  4   SQ   3  *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *  6    T   5  *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *       L   7  *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *    P ___     *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
