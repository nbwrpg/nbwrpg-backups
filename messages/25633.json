The hole in the \nbridge has been sealed by plating due to the lockdown.\n\n2) There are no defenses left. The majority, if not all of the autoguns have \nbeen destroyed, the EMP cannon is falling apart, and anything else you can \nthink of has probably been blasted by the Alliance.\n\n3) Hysteria, Smokescreen, and a few other Allinace &#39;bots are the only ones \ninside the CF. NO OTHER &#39;BOTS CAN ENTER OR EXIT UNLESS HYSTERIA DISENGAGES \nTHE LOCKDOWN. You need the codes AND access to a console in order to \ndisengage the lockdown, as far as I know anyway.\n\nThat&#39;s about it. If I forgot anything or overstepped my bounds please let me \nknow. I hope this e-mail reaches everyone, oh, and Ks, I didn&#39;t read any new \ne-mails about Firestarter or Unitron firing inside the base, but e-groups \nmay not have delivered them to me. The e-mail I recieved was the one were \nSmokescreen first appears and Unitron is talking about his horn missiles^_^ \nI apologize if this seems a little odd, but four hours of testing will do \nthat to you&gt;.&lt; Hope you did better than I did on my tests Yan!)\n\nHysteria:\n\nHysteria finally stoppped fiddling with the shield&#39;s fluctuating power \nlevels and starts concentrating on the CF&#39;s main entry way. She had been \nslowly collecting data on the horn missiles since she first discovered them \nburrowing deeper into the doors. They were weakening the molecular structure \nof the door, and seemed to be set to explode by a remote detonation:\n\n&quot;If I blast them they&#39;ll probably explode, and there&#39;s no way I can garuntee \nthey won&#39;t take the shields with them.&quot;\n\nHysteria tapped a few keys on the larger console, still pondering the \nmissiles that continued to burrow deeper into the door.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
