A character that \nshould bring all our forces together against a common foe. I&#39;ll be \nposting tomorrow morning and tomorrow night to decide who gets the \nhonors. So Without further ado I Give you The Bird\n\nA Prison ship lands somewhere near Turkey. It scanned the planet as \nit came to rest and found a compatable life form. Bounty stepped \nbefore a reflective surface toadmire himself. He transformed into a \nplump juicy turkey. &quot;Is this the mighty beast this planet has to \noffer?&quot; He pecked at the surface scratching it mutating his \nreflection. He stepped outside to begin his search. He scanned the \narea. &quot;These bots are definitely guilty of illegal time altering and \ntemporal shifting. Additional charges for murder, deletion, planetary \ngrowth interference, and littering. Most of the charges are minor but \nlittering can&#39;t be allowed on any planet. For this the penalty is \nDeath.&quot; the enraged prison bot charged off to find the criminals \nresponsible for the crimes. &quot;This planet is a real Cornicopia of \ncrime, I may have to pick them up by the necks, spin them around \nuntil they no longer function then serve them up on a silver platter \nwith all the sides before the judge.&quot; He was ticked at the \nlawbreakers on the planet for interupting him in the middle of dinner \nwhile he sat watching the annual cyber-ball game on his holoset. &quot;The \njudge will say thanks while giving them them life, roasting in thier \nown juices. Then whatever,s leftover he&#39;ll sanwich in an airtight \nspace, maybe even freeze them for a while. Any way he looks at it \nit&#39;ll be a day to remember.\n\nOK, enough bad puns, who wants a piece of this turkey?\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
