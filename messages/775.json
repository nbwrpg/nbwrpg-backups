* As Dinobot continued to fire at the back of Megatron he noticed Sineses\n&gt; pin down Suukie and quickly looked at the Predacon&#39;s neck, with split\nsecond\n&gt; timing he targeted with his optic site and fired at the attacking Pred.\nEven\n&gt; though Suukie had fired upon Tavatron and himself he owed the little bot\nhis\n&gt; life, he was the kind of bot  to repay his debts.\n&gt; Dinobot continued his assault upon his former commander as he fired at\n&gt;
