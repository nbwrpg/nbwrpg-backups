If you don&#39;t believe\n&gt; then how can you ever aspire with what matters most?  A leader without a\n&gt; heart is as good as if there wasn&#39;t one ta begin with.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She turns to do as ordered, as does Rattrap.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; My brother might make mistakes but he has something well worth the\n&gt; compensation.  He has a heart and a big one. If you got ta really know him\n&gt; you would see that too.   Cmon Rattrap, we better get going.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME&#39;s optics were the one&#39;s of a soldier&#39;s as he looked at\nSTRAIGHT SHOT as he watched her leave. &quot;Such faith she has in her\nbrother.&quot; he said quietly to LORD ELDER.\n\nELDER nodded, &quot;She has a point. It may be that soome of the Predacons\nmay learn to change, Blackarachnia did for a while.&quot;\n\nThere was a grim smile, &quot;Yes, but where is she now? We haven&#39;t seen\nher in years.&quot; He looked at ELDER, &quot;Go look after them, i am sure\nthere is some grumbling.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from ELDER as he turned and began walking towards the\ndocking bay, his optics dim in thought.\n\n********\n\nAs RAT TRAP and STRAIGHT SHOT make their way to the docking bay\nWINGCALIBER and SANTON were already there, standing by the main door\ntalking among themsleves until they noticed the other Maximals\napproaching.\n\n&quot;So, what is going on?&quot; SANTON said, definitely curious about what was\nhappening. &quot;All we got was the mesage to report here.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
