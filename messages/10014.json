We are still short handed, what do we do if the \nother preds attack us.  We&#39;d be outnumbered 3 to 1.  I don&#39;t like \nthose odds.&quot;\n\nShe was mad at Megatron for sending them into a death trap like \nthat.  She wondered what was going on in Megatron&#39;s mind.  Was he \ncrazy? Had his logic circiuts gone haywire?  She couldn&#39;t help but \nwonder.\n\n\n"}}
