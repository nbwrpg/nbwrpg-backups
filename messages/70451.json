Cyclonus&#39; striking form is\nstanding in the middle of it, his weapons lashing out. Even though he\nseemed to firing rapidly in several different directions it is obvious\nthat he is being careful not to hit anything that would bring the\ntunnel down on top of them.\n\nWhat Cyclonus is fighting was strange. It looked like some sort of\ninsect like creature, like a cross between a spider and a Mantis. It\nhad 10 legs, 6 for walking and 4 that ended in long sharp mantis like\nclaws. However instead of a living chitinous shell, it was encased in\nyellow, red and orange armor, which looked disturbingly similar to\nRodimus&#39; armor style. They were rocket launchers and laser cannons\nsitting on their frames, showing that they were definitely designed\nfor war!\n\nFortunately there was only one left, but there were several others\njust like it laying on the ground, as was Bruticus-X, Insecticon and\nScourge. Cyclonus himself looked heavily damaged as he battled on, the\nlook on his face said he was resigned to whatever fate this battle had\nin store for him.\n\n&quot;We are the horde.&quot; the creature said as it raised its arms at\nCyclonus, its claws out, &quot;You cannot resist us. You will become one\nwith us, your technological distinctiveness with strengthen the hive.&quot;\n\n&quot;You are not warrior, you are slaves to a beast! I shall give you what\nyou do not deserve, a warrior&#39;s death!&quot; With that he fired, causing\nthe creature to back up a step and then the fighting continued.\n\n*     *     *    *\n\n&quot;What is that Lord Sire?&quot; Inferno whispered to Hydras they crept up\nbeside Hydras as they all could now see and hear what was going on.\n\nIguanus grunted slightly as he readied his weapon, &quot;There&#39;s only one,\nit shouldn&#39;t be too hard.&quot;\n\nFractyl said nothing as he hung to the rear, not all that comfortable\nwith battle, but still ready to carry out Hydras&#39; orders. But even he\nthought Iguanus was too sure of himself. If it was tough for Cyclonus,\nthe creature had to be pretty strong.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
