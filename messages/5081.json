Her ears pulled back and\nstill\n&gt; ready to fight, she backed up a few feet.  She was brave, but not stupid\nto\n&gt; take on two bots at once.  Well, not when she was dmamaged.  She stopped\n&gt; growling.\n&gt; &quot;Now will someone tell me what that spotted thing was.  I smelt Maximal\nfrom\n&gt; it. That&#39;s why I attacked.  Who are you two? Whom do you serve?&quot;\n&gt; She didn&#39;t really care who they worked for.  All she really wanted was to\n&gt; use a CR chamber for a bit and be on her way.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Worldwide Calling with Firetalk!\n&gt; Click Here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5481/13/_/_/_/962174420/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
