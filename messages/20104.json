The struggled with \nthe wires at was rigged up into the detionators attached to them. He \nconnected the wires in beast mode, which didn&#39;t make this any more \neasier. His bulky claws made operations like this difficult. He \nworked on it for a while, getting frustrated at some points.\n\nAfter finishing with the lining down the corridors, he went to the \nengine room. He set up a few connected detionators there. Once the \ncontroler was pressed, they would all detionate in unison. \n\nHe transformed to robot mode, taking a look around first. He opened \nhis comm-link to Black Arachnia. &quot;All finished. What now, sugar-bot?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
