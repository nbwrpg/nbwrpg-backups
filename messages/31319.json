Unfortunately,\n&gt;most of\n&gt;&gt; the Maximals I have met so far have not given me a great feeling\n&gt;about\n&gt;&gt; their cause&quot;. Then the CR chamber opens, and Beachcomber and\n&gt;Firedrill jump\n&gt;&gt; to their feet to meet their long time partner.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The small red robot swaggers out off the chamber, &quot;ohhhhh my akin\n&gt;head&quot; he\n&gt;&gt; musters. &quot;Cliffjumper, your alive&quot; blurts out Firedrill in\n&gt;happiness, but\n&gt;&gt; realises now that all of his partners are up, that they need to do\n&gt;&gt; something. &quot;Come on Cliffjumper, Beachcomber, it&#39;s time for us to\n&gt;take\n&gt;&gt; charge&quot;. They then start heading off in a random direction, since\n&gt;they dont\n&gt;&gt; know their whareabouts. They lucky pass by the control room Iron\n&gt;Raptor is\n&gt;&gt; in.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
