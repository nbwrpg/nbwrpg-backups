He didn&#39;t appreciate anyone but Zardus \nordering him around.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll go see him when I say we do.&quot; He says, an autogun swirling \nslightly, having all three of the bots there in its sights for a \nsecond, as if to reinforce Perndabot&#39;s words, though it was just doing \na routine sweep.\n\nHe looks at Swyft. If the femm responded, he would take her to Zardus \nas well. If not, he would just take these two.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Biomass lifted a brow as Perndabot answered him, thinking that \nthis bot \n&gt; was obviously some kind of dolt compaired to the rest of his crew, \neven \n&gt; they, he could bet, knew more about this ship and their commander \nthen he \n&gt; did.\n&gt; Biomass stepped closer to Perndabot.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Then take us to him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Biomass was pushing his luck with a big bot like Perndabot, but he \nwanted \n&gt; to know just how far he could take this guy before he got \naggressive.\n&gt; Biomass wasn&#39;t a small bot and he was only 5 ft smaller then this \none, a \n&gt; fight could be interesting but for the moment he was trying to place \nhis \n&gt; authority as quickly as he could in this faction.*\n&gt; \n&gt; * Nue&#39;e looked at Biomass with a look that told him not to push his \nluck.*\n&gt; \n&gt; .......................................\n&gt; \n&gt; * Tremmer, being blind, doesn&#39;t see Grimmler motion for him to \nfollow but \n&gt; his nose picked up the scent of the Maximal moving away and decides \nto \n&gt; follow all the same. Moving to four legs he starts moving towards \nhim, his \n&gt; nose always to the ground to make sure that he could smell if \nsomething was \n&gt; ahead of him so he wouldn&#39;t run into it.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Maximals ain&#39;t ever had it easy, kid.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Tremmer walked up so that he was right along side Grimmler.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Never will.
