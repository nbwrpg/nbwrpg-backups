He just sat down in his own chair as he looked\n&gt; at her, shaking his head, &quot;No lady Nightlight, I am not asking for you\n&gt; to fight.&quot; Although he didn&#39;t smile so much, his tone was light and\n&gt; easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I have some friends who are coming to meet Hydras, and I wanted you\n&gt; here to meet them with me.&quot; Cyclonus shrugged slighty, but even his\n&gt; shrug was somehow genteel and courtly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus&#39; communicator beeped. &quot;Ahh, they have arrived.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus stood and walked over to a control panel, one that would\n&gt; allow him to open the front door. &quot;They will be here shortly. You can\n&gt; aid me in showing them hospitality as we await Hydras.&quot; he said.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
