She wouldn&#39;t let anyone else call her \nthat, or they&#39;d find thier head on thier lap, severed from thier body.\n&quot;Well, the scanners show that there is a massive attack on the \nmaximal base CybertronFire. From the signature readings, it looks \nlike there are a few good predacons out there that we might want to \nenlist. Or have us join them.  After all, the more we are means the \nmore we have to stomp the maximals with right? So, whatcha want to do \nthere commander?&quot; she said, looking at Drillbit with a evil grin. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He got up and walked with her.\n&gt; &quot;You bet we will, love.
