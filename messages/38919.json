I am quite happy and like\n&gt;the USA&#39;s citizens. I disagree with many forms of &quot;Agreements&quot; made\n&gt;between them, and with the government in USA, but I won&#39;t hold that\n&gt;against the people of it. It&#39;s not wrong, I just disagree.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
