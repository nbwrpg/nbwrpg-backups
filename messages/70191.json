Nightlight moaned with pain.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras and Perceptor Screamed in pain.\n\nRodimus Prime looked over at Tuscon and then at the others as the wave\nof sensation swept over him. He could see the jerks of pain from\nScorponok and Darkhawk as they fell down in pain, while the Autobots\nand Maximals seemed to be struggling to hold back the laughter, and\nthen he felt it too. it was a wave of warmth that seemed to vibrate at\nhis relays, causing him to jerk slightly as he smiled and held himself\nsilent.\n\nHowever something was different with Scourge. He felt the wave pass\nover him, and like a wave of pain he staggered back a step, but it was\nnot enough to bring him to his knees.\n\nScorponok glanced at Scourge with pain filled optics, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you in pain?&quot;\n\nScourge glanced at him and then back at the Autobots, &quot;Because I am\nnot built as a Decepticon but Unicronian, we are superior.&quot;\n\nScourge tapped his radio as he held up his weapon defensively,\nrealizing that at the moment it was only he against the Autobots as\nhis &#39;back up&#39; was on the ground. &quot;Sir!&quot; Scourge sent to Hydras and\nCyclonus, &quot;Tuscon is doing that wave thing again.&quot;\n\n******************************************************\nWho: CYCLONUS, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA, NIGHTRAZOR, Hydras, Perceptor\nLocation: Black Fortress - Hallways\n\nNot far away, Cyclonus got the call and looked down as Hydras and\nPerceptor were also down in pain, &quot;We are having the same effect\nhere.&quot; Cyclonus said, as he like the other Unicronian based\ntransformers could feel the wave, but its affects were far less\npronounced and a lot easier to ignore.\n\nPhobia looked at Hydras as she spoke to the others, &quot;I thought Hydras\nwas Galvatron also? His Unicronian design should protect him like us?&quot;\nshe looked confused and almost genuinely concerned.\n\nCyclonus nodded, &quot;He is, but I believe that in taking on the Megatron\nSpark and his more . . . um . . . terrestrial form, that he has become\nmore Decepticon than we.&quot;\n\nCyclonus gestured at Nightrazor, &quot;Use your noise cancellation field to\nnegate this until we can figure out a better solution.&quot;\n\nNightrazor nodded as he began to cancel out the effects of the sonar.\nAs sonar is basically an operation of sound, Nightrazor begins\ngenerating a type of white noise to directly cancel out its affects.\nThis is typically used to keep his movements quiet or to catch a foe\nat unawares, however this application of it was easily within his\ncapabilities.\n\nCyclonus nodded as he gestured to the others, &quot;Nightrazor, stay with\nPerceptor and Hydras, it may take them a few moments to recover, and\nthey may need your field until this ends.&quot;\n\nNightrazor nodded as he stood close to Hydras and Perceptor, tying to\nkeep the field up.\n\nCyclonus straightened, &quot;Computer!&quot; he said as he looked around.\n\n&quot;Working.&quot; said the cool computer voice.\n\n&quot;Open fire on all Maximal and Autobot energy signatures.&quot;\n\n&quot;Acknowledged.&quot; the computer voice came back, as internal gun units\nonce again oriented on the Maximal and Autobot group and opened up\nagain on Tuscon and his group!\n\n&quot;Come!&quot; Cyclonus said to Phobia and Deepstryke, &quot;It is time to end\nthis. Hydras will join us when he recovers.&quot;\n\nCyclonus, Deepstryke and Phobia jogged down the hall towards the\nAutobots and Maximals leaving Hydras and Perceptor to recover under\nthe protection of Nightrazor&#39;s field.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
