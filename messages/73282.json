He knew he would return for Talon but first he had to rescue his\n&gt; best friend from his situation.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; nightlight finally woke up and saw that she was being carried by a giant bird.\n&gt; By a second she felt like a Hatchling or a little chick\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus??? is it really you????&quot; said Nightlight surpriced by his new beast form\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS smiled down at NIGHTLIGHT as he shifted to his robotic form\nand landed carrying NIGHTLIGHT in his arms. &quot;Yes it is truely me.&quot;\n\nRODIMUS landed at the entrance to the ARK as he watched the others\nmake their way back. RODIMUS stood much taller and broader than\nbefore, his robot mode having changed almost as much as his beastmode\nhad done. He now stood at nearly 15 feet tall and looked much\ndifferent than before.\n\nThe dark figure of LEGACY walked up to RODIMUS, &quot;I can see that you\nhave underwent changes.&quot; He said in cold factual tones.\n\nRODIMUS smiled grimly at LEGACY, &quot;More than you know.&quot; He looked at\nthe other MAXIMALS as they came in but kept his voice low, pitched\njust for LEGACY to hear, although it is possible that NIGHTLIGHT might\nnear it too. &quot;We will need to speak when this is over. You and some of\nthe others.&quot;\n\nLEGACY nodded, &quot;I had expected as much.&quot;\n\nTurning back to NIGHTLIGHT there was a smile from RODIMUS, &quot;I have\nseen the MATRIX, and it tells me that there are more changes coming.&quot;\nHe said grimly both to LEGACY ads well as NIGHTLIGHT.\n\nLEGACY nodded, &quot;You have passed beyond my knowledge of the future to\nbe of assistance.&quot; The dark figure said, a hint of sadness in his cold\ntones. &quot;But what little I know confirms that something is on the\nhorizon.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
