Veratis brought you\n&gt; here for a reason. I am not sure what that reason is, but it must be\n&gt; good if he wanted you here. You showed yourself to be a good warrior.\n&gt; I shall be honored to fight along side you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked as FoxFingers stormed off. She chuckled. &quot;Lunarpine, must\n&gt; you tease him so? After all, he&#39;s only a little guy. We have to help\n&gt; protect him.&quot;  She walked over and transformed into bot mode. She\n&gt; leaned down and kissed Lunarpine on the cheek. &quot;I&#39;d have done the\n&gt; same for you, you know. And thank you for letting me fight on this\n&gt; one. It felt good to &#39;stretch my wings again&#39;, so to speak.&quot;\n&gt; She smiled warmly at him.\n&gt;\n&gt; She turned to Veratis.&quot;Class? What class?
