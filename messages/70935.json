But he could see that it would be difficult to \nachieve, but was still determined to carry out his promise.  He keeps an \nattentive ear out on the situation, while trying to get a silent com over to \nWindlord, Rat Trap, Kup, Straight Shot, and the others.  He starts by \ncontacting Kup and his team.\n\n&quot; Tucson to Kup, over.  The enemy seems to be gaining ground but it could be \nsome time before they reach us.  That could give you and your team time to \nmobilize and divise a strategy that best fits your needs.  I&#39;m fully \nconfident in your abilities to assemble a plan, and any imput you can give \nus is valuable.  But be careful, they could sneak up on us at any time.&quot;\n\nNight Shift now helps Talon, by sticking close to her, as he too fires \nrounds but keeps a shield over Talon and himself.\n\n&quot; I got your back Talon, ain&#39;t gonna let no preds or cons take any pop shots \nat any of us!&quot;\n\nTucson now contacts Rat Trap and Windlord.\n\n&quot; Tucson to Rat Trap and Windlord, over.  What&#39;s your position?&quot;\n\nRat Trap responds.\n\n&quot;Umm, we didn&#39;t exactly get inta the fortress Wheels... We&#39;re tryn&#39; but the \nonly hole we could find was a crevace in the wall.&quot;\n\nTucson responds.\n\n&quot; As long as you&#39;re both safe, that&#39;s all that counts.&quot;\n\nRat Trap sighs.\n\n&quot;Ain&#39;t good enough Wheels, I want this ta work, not fail.  The only way ta \nget in is ta blast this wall, but that&#39;ll start a riot for sure, and we \ndon&#39;t wanna do that.&quot;\n\nTucson thinks for a moment.\n\n&quot;Hmmm...  You&#39;re right about the shots, we wouldn&#39;t want to do that...  But \na chemical agent, similar to acid, may be able to burn a way into that wall, \nwithout making any noise or disruptive movement..&quot;\n\nRat Trap raises an optic.\n\n&quot;Ohhh yeahhhh, an acidic compound... Like the stuff in batteries..  Lemme \nsee what I got under my fur, I know I kept some goodies under here....&quot;\n\nHe digs into his fur, and grins.\n\n&quot;Bingo..  I found this while scrounging one day...  An old battery cell I \npicked up somewhere..  All we gotta do is open this up, get to the acidic \nchamber, and see if that eats through the wall.  Windlord, got anything \nsharp ta cut inta this?&quot;\n\nBack at the ark, Quickstride is taken aback by what is happening to him.\n\n&quot;What the?  Rodimus, is it me or did everything just go dark?  I don&#39;t like \nthis...  Watch your back sir, This isn&#39;t good, whatever it is.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The firepower reaching into the air is quite heavy! The skies are\n&gt; fairly lit with smoke, fire and bright lights as the Maximals and\n&gt; Autobots attempt to defend themselves and their position. EMP rounds,\n&gt; while missing their intended targets still disrupt the sweeps\n&gt; targeting locks for a moment a send their radar systems into temporary\n&gt; shut down. This allows Talon&#39;s weapons fire to find a home, brining\n&gt; down yet another sweep, leaving two of them in the air overhead.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile Tuscon is able to get an assessment of the situation as\n&gt; there are currently no combatants on the ground. The sweeps are down\n&gt; to two now, well under half the number they started out with. However\n&gt; he can see in the distance there are more sweeps rising from an open\n&gt; door at the tower, and there are others as well. He still can get a\n&gt; bead on the sweeps, but the others rising up he had met before â€“ the\n&gt; soldiers Cyclonus had brought the tower when Tuscon was trying to\n&gt; fight his way out. However as the tower is still many kilometers away\n&gt; it will take a little bit of time for them to reach his position.\n&gt;\n&gt; ***************************************************************************\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile at the tower itself Rat Trap and Windlord are unable to find\n&gt; a true &#39;hole&#39; in the tower itself. There does not appear to be any\n&gt; open vents or handy cracks that lead thier way in. All the vents are\n&gt; currently closed, firmly and securely, and they would need to be,\n&gt; after all this is a tower designed to descend into liquid rock.\n&gt; However they are able to find a spot where the walls on the upper\n&gt; tower jut out slightly, a small crevass. However it is very small, and\n&gt; it in no way leads into the tower itself, but it is merely a small\n&gt; cubby hole type structure.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only way discernable into the tower itself, short of blowing a\n&gt; hole in the wall, and judgingh by the material of the wall this would\n&gt; take a lot of firepower, the only way in is the large door that the\n&gt; soldiers had just left from - the door that is even now continuing to\n&gt; close.\n&gt;\n&gt; ***************************************************************************\n&gt;\n&gt; At the Ark there is no answer to Quickstride&#39;s challenge. The air that\n&gt; had rippled before stopped, or atleast it was no longer visible to\n&gt; him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What do you see?&quot; Rodimus&#39; voice comes over the speaker. &quot;My sensors\n&gt; aren&#39;t picking up anyth . . .&quot; Rodimus&#39; voice goes silent as the world\n&gt; around Quickstride goes completely dark. He cannot see anything, not\n&gt; even his hand in front of his face, nor can he hear anything, not even\n&gt; the sound of his own voice. It is like his audio and visual sensors\n&gt; have gone offline.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
