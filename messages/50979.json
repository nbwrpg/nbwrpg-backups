She doesn&#39;t take a direct course \nfor her objective just yet, favoring an oblique approach.  (For those \nof you who don&#39;t know such obscure words, &quot;oblique&quot; refers to a \nmoderately shallow arc.)\n\nOOC: For those who went into the &quot;New Ideas&quot; discussion topic on the \nsite, this is my Soul Orb concept.  For those who never saw it, let&#39;s \njust say these are Vok artifacts with great powers for those lucky \nfew capable of activating them: Meteara, Owlhawk, Empath, Rodimus \nPrime, Skulletron, and Phoenix.  More names may be added to this \nlist, eventually.  They need to have a notable quirk, and not just in \nbodily construction or personality.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Cygnar::\n&gt;        He glares at Galvatron angrily but nods his acquiescence.  \n&quot;Because \n&gt; you have commanded it, it shall be done.&quot;  He performs the \nCybertronian \n&gt; equivalent of clenching his jaw and looks to Empath.  &quot;Shall we go \nnow?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
