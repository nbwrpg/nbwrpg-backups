GET OUT=\r\nA HERE IF YA KNOW THAT&#39;S\n&gt; &gt; GOOD FOR YA!  &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; QUICKSTRIDE&#39;s =\r\nhooves are used to good affect as two of the hordes of\n&gt; SHARKTICONS are ta=\r\nken out, the hard surface of his hooves penetrating\n&gt; their armor and into =\r\ntheir internal structures. Both of them fall to\n&gt; the ground, their systems=\r\n failing as they did so.\n&gt; \n&gt; However there are more right behind, ever rea=\r\ndy to take the place of\n&gt; their fallen comrades. Horseflies may indeed be a=\r\nn applicable\n&gt; illustration of their attack method, if Horseflies were as l=\r\narge as\n&gt; you were and had large teeth that could easily penetrate your arm=\r\nor as\n&gt; well. However just like the proverbial horsefly they were easy to\n&gt;=\r\n kill, but unfortunately there are always more!\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same RAT TRAP i=\r\ns also facing his share of these creaturs as\n&gt; they were able to fly and sw=\r\noop and maneuver in ways that they never\n&gt; seemed to be able to do before.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; DINOBOT paused.  The SHARKTICONS seemed to be barely s=\r\nentient, but reliant\n&gt; &gt; upon a general to give them orders ni battle and d=\r\nirect them.  However, the\n&gt; &gt; GENERAL seemed to be content to hold back, an=\r\nd fighting him directly would\n&gt; &gt; require simultaneously engaging him AND h=\r\nis forces.  The DINOBOT of old\n&gt; &gt; would have relished such a challenge, bu=\r\nt for this new incarnation, &#39;honor&#39;\n&gt; &gt; was the last thing on his processor=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Going to try and engage the SHARKTICONS group by gruop, attemptin=\r\ng to thin\n&gt; &gt; down thier numbers with hit and run tactics, counting that th=\r\ne groups would\n&gt; &gt; be trying to pursue them to just overwhelm with numbers,=\r\n and thus running\n&gt; &gt; into one another and messing up their formations with=\r\n each hit and run\n&gt; &gt; attack of his own, trying to thin the herd.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; DINOBOT is reasonably astute in his assessment of the situation, at\n=\r\n&gt; least as far as he could see it. SKYBYTE did seem to be giving them\n&gt; gen=\r\neral direction and impetus. While he was not controlling them by\n&gt; remote c=\r\nontrol or on an individual basis, he was acting as a guiding\n&gt; force in mat=\r\nters, directing them to where the MAXIMAL and PREDACON\n&gt; forces were the we=\r\nakest and exploiting what he could.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using his superior speed and armor=\r\n DINOBOT is able to begin the act of\n&gt; thinning their number as his hit and=\r\n run tactics are beginning to have\n&gt; an impact on the SHARKTICONS!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nOLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, VICE GRIP was of a different mindset, just going to=\r\n charge in\n&gt; &gt; directly over towards SKYBYTE!  Of course, this would lead h=\r\nis charge right\n&gt; &gt; through the main cluster of SHARKTICONS, and give them =\r\na golden opportunity\n&gt; &gt; to dogpile (or sharkpile) on him..\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYBYTE bl=\r\ninked as he noted VICE GRIP moving straight through the\n&gt; SHARKTICONS comin=\r\ng straight at him. In a quick move he has the\n&gt; SHARKTICONS converge on his=\r\n position in an effort to pile up on the\n&gt; approaching VICE GRIP!\n&gt; \n&gt; Howe=\r\nver that maneuver also has the affect of further thinning out the\n&gt; ranks a=\r\ns they focused on the center. It is at that point that the\n&gt; MAXIMAL FUZORS=\r\n begin to act, their teeth and claws ripping through the\n&gt; SHARKTICONS, spr=\r\neading out and attacking left and right creating an\n&gt; explosion of confusio=\r\nn that SKYBYTE was having trouble directing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile=\r\n, Tucson continues to step forth to face Magmatron.  With no fear,\n&gt; &gt; just=\r\n the courage he was programmed with, he takes a brave step forward.  He\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n holds his hand back to Leo and Big Convoy.  It was clear that he wanted to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; fight him on his own, knowing that it was his idea to come this far an=\r\nd he\n&gt; &gt; alone had to complete the journey.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Leo, Convoy, help Opt=\r\nimus, I will deal with Magmatron.  I started this\n&gt; &gt; journey, now I must c=\r\nomplete it.    Very well Magmatron you have your\n&gt; &gt; battle. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He t=\r\nakes his Martial Arts stance, and prepares to go one on one with\n&gt; &gt; Magmat=\r\nron.  And hopefully win back what the Silver Dragon had fought for so\n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nany years .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME and BIG CONVOY nod, &quot;Be careful. . . he is pr=\r\nobrably the\n&gt; most dangerous foe here and I would guess the most dangerous =\r\none you\n&gt; have ever met.&quot; They quickly take off towards OPTIMUS!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanw=\r\nhile MAGMATRON smiled, &quot;So you sent off your backup? How unwise\n&gt; of you.&quot; =\r\nHe chuckled as he looked down at TUSCON as MAGMATRON stood at\n&gt; nearly twic=\r\ne TUSCON&#39;s height. &quot;I have been fighting since long before\n&gt; you were a pul=\r\nse in you your creation matrix&#39;s thought process.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked at TUSCON=\r\n, &quot;You believe that you have skills.&quot; MAGMATRON&#39;s\n&gt; chuckle was becoming op=\r\nen derisive laughter, &quot;You don&#39;t realize just\n&gt; how little you have.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nWith a forward sweep he slashed forward with a sword that was about\n&gt; the s=\r\name size as TUSCON himself!\n&gt; \n&gt; In the background DARK RODIMUS and RODIMUS=\r\n were still in battle\n&gt; pushing themselves to the limit as each kick and pu=\r\nnch was met with an\n&gt; equally skilled counter attack.\n&gt; \n&gt; Guard, Perry, Th=\r\nrust!\n&gt; \n&gt; Their steps taking them ever closer to the form of OPTIMUS who h=\r\nung\n&gt; over the pit!\n&gt; \n&gt; However at the same time SKYSHADOW and his FUZORS =\r\nhad fought their way\n&gt; through the crowd of SHARKTICONS and were also makin=\r\ng their own way to\n&gt; OPTIMUS, their optics looking at him greedily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me=\r\nanwhile in the far corner, against the wall, away from the battle at\n&gt; larg=\r\ne, the dark form of CRYOTEK was beginning to stir and his cold\n&gt; crimson op=\r\ntics snapped back as he head rose and looked around. He\n&gt; looked at OPTIMUS=\r\n PRIME as he started to rise.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
