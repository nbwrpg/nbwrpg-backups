On another portion of the ship, two small portions open up \nbefore two odd looking ships seemingly flying like a vertical like \nexit and fire out into the ocean. Each then flys off towards the \nsurface before they break through and the bottom folds out into \nwings. Each one passenger ship then speeds off towards the location \nof the IGL transmission.\n\n\n"}}
