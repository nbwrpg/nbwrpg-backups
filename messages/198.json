Failure \nwas not an option!\nIt was large but easily hidden in the early morning shadows but it&#39;s grey \nand black hide, it&#39;s massive head close to the ground and it&#39;s tail half in \nthe air for balance.\nAs it crept a few steppes closer it could smell a tinge of something in the \nair, it closely resembled the smell of blood but had an acrid odder to it, \nlittle did the predator know but that was the smell of mech-fluid.\nIt stalked closer then stopped, it&#39;s sighted prey only a 12 feet away and it \ntensed it&#39;s muscles.\nStanding 10:2 at full height it hid itself the best it could, but soon it \nwould have to hide no longer!*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
