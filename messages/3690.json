Gould&quot; &lt;black_panther_kitten@...&gt;\r\n\r\n\nShadow Cat rolled out of the way of a few of Ares&#39;\ncharges but was hit in the back by a stray shot,\narching her back in pain as she yells out...dropping\nto her knees.\nSnow Tech looked over at his sister as he heard her\nyell, his optics growling wide as he saw her fall. He\nsnapped his head towards Ares and raised his lightning\ngun towards the enemy, with a raged cry he pressed his\nfinger to the trigger and didn&#39;t let up until over a\ndozen shots left the berral. With that done he then\nrushed over to Shadow Cat and helped her to her feet,\nactually being calmed by the fact that the damage\nwasn&#39;t that bad. He made a weird face towards his\nsister despite the moment, making him look like some \n&#39; know it all &#39;.\n\n&quot; I remember that, once upon a time, somebot told me\nthat only powder puffs cried out in pain, obviously I\nhave to start calling you Fluffy from now on, huh?&quot;\n\n He smiled at her even when she pushed him away and\npicked her splatter gun up from the ground, he was\nalways a joker but he could pick the worst times to\ncome up with a pun.\nShadow Cat looked up at Ares and growled at him but\nthen something caught her attention, it sounded like\nthunder but as she looked there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the\nsky. Then it hit her, a rocket!\nShe looked around and finally saw the deadly weapon\nheading for Snow Tech and herself, she glanced over at\nhim with urgency and then jumped out of the\nway...taking him with her.\nBoth Shadow Cat and Snow Tech hit the ground at the\nsame time as an explosion from the rocked impacting\nsent a termer through the ground.\nSnow Tech rubbed his head as he sat up and then\nwhacked his sis in the shoulder.\n\n&quot; Ow! Next time warn me when we&#39;re gunna take a dirt\ndive, huh?!&quot;\n\nWith that he then stood up and was about to help\nShadow Cat to her feet as well but then noticed that\nshe was already standing and firing off towards Koga\nShuko.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages with Yahoo!
