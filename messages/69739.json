Anyway, you can count on us Lord Elder.

We&#39;ll have to m=\r\nove fast though, Lord Perseus probably needs us ASAP.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap opens t=\r\nhe hatch door while on Quickstride&#39;s back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Wish us luck guys.

We can cover more ground that way. Plus, it&#39;s be=\r\nen a while since I&#39;ve done any form of off road driving and if we keep off =\r\nthe main roadways, no one will ever suspect that we&#39;ve gone back to the Ark=\r\n instead of taking the bait.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n\nElder looked at the shuttle thoughtfully,=\r\n resting a hand on it. &quot;Hmmm&quot;\nhe said finally, &quot;That might not be a bad ide=\r\na.&quot; He depressed a few\ncontrols, trying to lock it down. Of course no lock =\r\nis perfect.\n\nHe looked back at Tuscon, who had transformed into his vehicul=\r\nar mode already.\n\n&gt; He transforms into his SUV mode and opens his door to L=\r\nord Elder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So who wants shotgun?&quot;\n\nWith one last look back at the shut=\r\ntle Elder slid into the proffered\ndoor that Tuscon held open. &quot;Let&#39;s go. We=\r\n have a lot of things ahead\nof us.&quot;\n\nOOC: Don&#39;t forget, this is millions of=\r\n years into Earth&#39;s past. Not\nonly are there no roads, but everything is co=\r\nmpletely wild, and you\nget to contend with things like Dinosaurs along the =\r\nway! :)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
