And yes, Disagreeance is=\r\n a word.\n\n    Deemos: No, you said &quot;We cannot allow this other club to gain=\r\n the upper hand,&quot; apparently if there is this &quot;other&quot; club, this is a club.=\r\n\n\n    Leader: See here--\n\n    Deemos: I was the one who held a council.

You don&#39;t =\r\nknow what violence is. I am the epitome of violence. The innovator. The onl=\r\ny individuals I&#39;ve seen you destroy are your own comrades.

Send me to the great junkyard in the sky?\n\n    Member: Junkyard?\n\n=\r\n    Leader: Enough of this, get him!\n\n    Deemos stands up. A member sittin=\r\ng right next to him stands up as well, but he&#39;s too slow and too dumb. Deem=\r\nos puts a pistol to his mid section quickly and fires. Several bolts rip th=\r\nrough the robot, creating several flashes and one hole leading all the way =\r\nthrough. The unlucky one falls to the ground. Deemos&#39; trigger finger quickl=\r\ny flicks a switch on the utility pistol as he swivels it around towards ano=\r\nther member who was raising a rifle. Deemos moves forward a single step and=\r\n barely dodges a shot heading his way. He fires the pistol and a barrage of=\r\n 5 inch long steel nails are fired at rapid speed, piercing the head of the=\r\n attackee and tearing off large chunks. Deemos quickly spins around, flicki=\r\nng a switch once more and he fires. Several shots hit the robot who had fir=\r\ned at him, cutting down the bot who shocked at Deemos&#39; speed and severing o=\r\nne of his arms and his head. The cut down fellow&#39;s head rolled across the f=\r\nloor as the body dropped.\n\n    Leader: Idiots!\n\n    Deemos quickly fired a =\r\nfew pellets on the ground, which erupted into tall flames. He was hidden fr=\r\nom sight. A shot emerges from behind the flames, passing Deemos&#39; head by in=\r\nches.\n\n    Leader: Did you hear that?

He listens to the code carefully then plays it back=\r\n again. He plays it back a third time.\n\n    Deemos: Hmm. Maybe. This sounds=\r\n like the old code.\n\n    He activates his jets and flies, planning to answe=\r\nr this message addressing him and the the one that he knew well back on Ear=\r\nth, Arrow.

A member sitting right next to him \n    stands up as well, but=\r\n he&#39;s too slow and too dumb. Deemos puts a pistol to \n    his mid section q=\r\nuickly and fires. Several bolts rip through the robot, \n    creating severa=\r\nl flashes and one hole leading all the way through. The \n    unlucky one fa=\r\nlls to the ground. Deemos&#39; trigger finger quickly flicks a \n    switch on t=\r\nhe utility pistol as he swivels it around towards another member \n    who w=\r\nas raising a rifle. Deemos moves forward a single step and barely \n    dodg=\r\nes a shot heading his way. He fires the pistol and a barrage of 5 inch \n   =\r\n long steel nails are fired at rapid speed, piercing the head of the attack=\r\nee \n    and tearing off large chunks. Deemos quickly spins around, flicking=\r\n a switch \n    once more and he fires. Several shots hit the robot who had =\r\nfired at him, \n    cutting down the bot who shocked at Deemos&#39; speed and se=\r\nvering one of his \n    arms and his head. The cut down fellow&#39;s head rolled=\r\n across the floor as the \n    body dropped.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Leader: Idiots!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Dee=\r\nmos quickly fired a few pellets on the ground, which \n    erupted into tall=\r\n flames.
