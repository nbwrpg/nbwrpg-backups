So far as the Maxis and Preds not being evolved \nfrom the Autos and Decepts because they&#39;re smaller and weaker.  Well \nwe&#39;re weaker than our ancestors and our arcitects can&#39;t reproduce the \ngreat pyramids no matter how hard they try.  That&#39;s 1 theory of \nEvolution.  Another states whoevers more sexually attractive will \ngenetically survive.  You&#39;re not abot so don&#39;t say the Insecticons \nwouldn&#39;t have been good bedmates because opinions might vary even \nthough the Insecticons were small and weak.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Hollywood Narrator&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Off scale? I&#39;m not sure what that means, but it&#39;s probably an \nincorrect statement. G1 had bloopers, but none as bad as Beast Wars \nmaking Rattrap in the wrong form during Dinobot&#39;s cremation.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, you have every transformer to ever exist? Ironic, I have a \nmonster truck in my back yard that can actually transform into \nUnicron and you can ride around in him into outer space and even land \non the moon like Neil Armstrong didn&#39;t! WHOOPEE!\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, the Transmetal on the Transmetals is plastic. Easily \ndamaged plastic. The only advantage it have over G1&#39;s metal is that \nit&#39;s less expensive. Well, it doesn&#39;t hurt as much when you drop it \non your toe, too.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wish I knew everything about G1. I do however, think I know \nenough to know what I&#39;m talking about...\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Hottie4u2have1@a... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, March 07, 2002 6:37 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: G1\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ok its like this guys G1 i thought was the best transformers even \nif it was \n&gt;   off scale more then the others but i think most of the characters \nin G1 was \n&gt;   cool especially since i have every transformer made so far yes \nfrom the \n&gt;   beginning and the new ones of transformers in disguise.I have 4 \nof each one \n&gt;   and i kept 2 in boxes  put 1 up 4 a model of each one and then 1 \nof each 2 \n&gt;   mess around with and the odd thing is im a girl yes a girl.My \nbrothers also \n&gt;   have transformers but was never really a fan till Beast Wars.I \nhave japanese \n&gt;   version of the shows and movies and the US version of them.\n&gt;   I&#39;d just like to say im glad that i really didnt have to get \ninvolved in this \n&gt;   fight.But i wanted to say one thing stop making stupid OOC posts \nplease its \n&gt;   no need to fight about the way it was are its flaws its sorta old \nand i dont \n&gt;   like the complaints that somepeople are making.No names said \nthough.So I \n&gt;   think I&#39;m done with this post.Oh except can my character be the \nleader of the \n&gt;   Autobots please?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
