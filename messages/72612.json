He rolls over onto his stomach and reads the message.  A\n&gt; reflection on the screen shows a pair of cat like eyes and a muzzle full of\n&gt; whiskers.  He then looks at a pair of large black paws with thick paw pads.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Sweet, that wasn&#39;t a dream after all.  He did it, Holy Slag, he did it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gets up on his paws and climbs down off the bench.  Slowly he skulks into\n&gt; the room where he had been instructed to go.  He quietly pads up behind Lord\n&gt; Elder and puts a gentile paw on his shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Guess who.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nELDER turned as NIGHTSHIFT came into the room, &quot;Ah, I see you were\nable to get your new beast mode.&quot; The smile on his face a bit forced\nas if he had much on his mind but was still making an effort to be\ncivil, &quot;Is it to your liking?&quot;\n\nAs ELDER spoke others were filing into the room as well. POLAR CLAW,\nRAMULUS, WOLFGANG and PROWL all of them looking as good as new after\nthat recent battle with the DINOBOTS.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
