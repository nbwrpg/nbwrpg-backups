Megatron... Do you know where Organis or Windlord are?&quot;\nMegatron Revi=\r\nved:  &quot;I think they are still out.  they went for some private time and I h=\r\nave not heard from them since.&quot;\n Malice:  &quot;&#39;Private time&#39;?&quot;\nKup: &quot;What do y=\r\nou mean????&quot;\n Megatron Revived:  &quot;Well, they like each other.  They hold ha=\r\nnds and such, I could only assume that is what it was.&quot;\n Kup: &quot;&quot;Where was t=\r\nhe last place where you saw them?&quot;\nMegatron Revived:  &quot;A few hundred meters=\r\n to the east, by a big tree.  Do you think they were captured or something?=\r\n&quot;\nKup: &quot;My scans reports that thier signatures had vanished....&quot;replied wor=\r\nried the male&quot;No one is around base&quot;\n Malice:  The bounty hunter growlled, =\r\nthen let out a roar.  &quot;NO!  DAMMIT!  The other minions must have gotten the=\r\nm!  Damn that blasted clone!  He must be behind this!&quot;\nKup/elita: Elita who=\r\n was deeply slept, woke up scared ans started to cry aloud, Kup tried to ca=\r\nml her down and looking to Malice said  &quot;Good job Malice, after hours tryin=\r\ng to slept  her you had awakened her in less than a minute...&quot;\nMalice:  &quot;Er=\r\nr, sorry.  It&#39;s Injustice, I&#39;m sure that spineless little lizard has someth=\r\ning to do with this.&quot;\nKup: &quot;Who&#39;s that Injustice??&quot;\nMalice:  &quot;I was cloned,=\r\n and that maniac clone is Injustice.  He&#39;s got a lot of issues, and hates m=\r\ny guts.  He&#39;ll do anything to tick me off.&quot;\nKup: &quot;We should find out, first=\r\n what happened with Organcis and Windlord... &quot;replied the male&quot;I suggest to=\r\n explore the area were they where&quot;\nMalice:  &quot;Maybe, but we should see Rodim=\r\nus first.  We have a few things to discuss.&quot;\nKup:&quot;Every second are vital...=\r\n&quot;replied the male&quot;It&#39;s about your friend, isn&#39;t?&quot;\nMalice:  &quot;Yes, amoung oth=\r\ner things.  But I think Megatron should go looking for them, he&#39;s more know=\r\nledgeable about them and how they are together than me.  I might hurt their=\r\n feeligs somehow.&quot;\n Kup:&quot;Then megatron... can you go to the area and look f=\r\nor any proof about what had happened... I&#39;ll keep contact by complink, and =\r\nperhaps int hat way we can solve this mistery&quot;\nMegatron Revived:  &quot;(sigh)..=\r\n. fine.  I&#39;ll try to find where I left them and start from there.&quot;  The lar=\r\nger bot turned and headed back out of the base, in the direction he left hi=\r\ns sister and her lover.\nKup/elita: Elita still sobbed and tembled, while Ku=\r\np huged her in order to calm her down&quot;Well Malice... you and your friend mu=\r\nst be tired...
