How could he be so\nlucky, did Havotron know they were fighting rookies? This was going to\nbe an easy way to notch his belt. He let out a sick cackle with Tremor,\nas he walked towards Jet V, &quot;Can you believe it, they sent rookies to\nfight us.&quot; he said in astonishment. One of his eyes narrowed as he aimed\nhis gun down into Jet V&#39;s face. &quot;Looks like you won&#39;t make the big\n100000 Autobrat.&quot; he said disgustingly. Just before he could pull the\ntrigger however, an engine roared behind him, and Cliffjumper rammed\ninto his midback at a smooth 200 mph, causing SLugslinger to crumple up\nforward, and fire randomly into the air.\n\n"}}
