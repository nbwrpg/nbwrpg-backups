She leaned her aching body, and looked around. She held her head \nin relief that she wasn&#39;t dead. Her piercing red eyes check every corner of \nher dark forest, to make sure the two dinosaurs hadn&#39;t followed her.\n\nThis is bad news, she was found out, and it meant she had to move---again. \nMegatron was probably still hunting her. Didn&#39;t that bot ever quit? She was \njust one---but she did serve as a threat. She didn&#39;t care about him anymore. \nShe wanted to kill him for the abuses he put her against. And when he wanted \nher to destory Dinobot when she was just curious about him. That was the \ndownfall of her freedom. Mingling with a Maximal was wrong. And it nearly \ncaused her her life.\n\nShe transformed to her beast mode. She snarled at her wounds she recived \nfrom the battle. This was bad. Wounds in the wild while you were alone \nwasn&#39;t good. Because here, there were no CR chambers. She wasn&#39;t expecting \nthe big fight. She just wanted to scare the other raptor away.\n\nWho was she? She couldn&#39;t tell. She hadn&#39;t the time or temper to ask.\n\nCyber Claw nosed at the wounds on her side and back. It would heal on its \nown if she allowed it, and took it easy. But things weren&#39;t easy if you were \nhunted by your leader.\n\nThe giant raptor tilted her head up to the trees and mused to herself. She \nwould have to move on within a few cycles---or else die.\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
