Well if this was\n&gt; about a year and a half ago I wouldn&#39;t be able to\n&gt; blow up anything there. Georgia being the home of\n&gt; the late WCW then. And with Augusta being the home\n&gt; of the great Hulk Hogan. But since WCW no longer\n&gt; exists and Hogan lives in Flordia now, there is\n&gt; nothing important there. I can just blow up the\n&gt; whole state!!!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmmm, this a big post for a stupid joke with Dewy\n&gt; like this.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
