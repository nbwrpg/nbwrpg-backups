She went and looked. Another drone was near \nby.  She saw it was about 60 yards away. She crouched down, just like \nBlackfang did.  She crawled up really slowly to the drone. She \ncrawled up right under the drone. She went to pounce and banged her \nhead on the underside of the drone and fell the the ground.  She \nwhimpered a bit and rubbed her head with her paw. &quot;Ohhwwwwiieee, that \nhurrrtt.&quot; with a whine and a whimper.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blackfang saw that the puppy bot was going full frontal at the \ndrones.\n&gt; She would get bored soon if she went on like this. He transformed to\n&gt; wolf mode and met her near a tree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: You&#39;re enthusiastic, but you have to be careful too. Let \nme\n&gt; show you how to do this great, okay?\n&gt; \n&gt; He squatted his large shape near the ground and advanced slowly\n&gt; through the bushed. There was a drones mere meters away. He moved\n&gt; slowly, silently, until he was just under the drone, on the other \nside\n&gt; of a shrub. Then, he jumped. Quick as a bullet, he leapt just over \nthe\n&gt; drones and brought all his weight down on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: I know you can do just as good. It might take time, but I\n&gt; know you can do it! Now it&#39;s your turn.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
