She\n&gt; tried to reach out again and make a connection, but this time, she\n&gt; was more careful in where she tried to connect to.   She found the\n&gt; console screen again and made her words appear on the screen.\n&gt; &quot;Hello?&quot;\n&gt; She started to feel something strange. But couldn&#39;t make out the\n&gt; cause. Then she tried to reastablish all the connections she had made\n&gt; earlier, but very carefully and one at a time. She found them all in\n&gt; a few short minutes and was once again, moving the protoform&#39;s arm\n&gt; up. The arm raised straight up into the air and clentched a fist. She\n&gt; got excited again. She wasn&#39;t able to move the hand like that before\n&gt; and was overwhelmingly happy about her achievement.  She tried to\n&gt; make the other hand move,  it did, it clenched up as well. She typed\n&gt; up the words on the screen,&quot;YAAHHOOOO! I did it! I did it!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; But making the form move was like controling a crane arm.  She was\n&gt; controling it, but is didn&#39;t feel like it was her arm, or apart of\n&gt; her.  More like controling a joy stick which operated the arm.  It\n&gt; wasn&#39;t apart of her. But if she has some control, then that meant she\n&gt; may not be totally helpless after all.  She lowered the arm and tried\n&gt; something different.  She tried to raise the head.  It came up about\n&gt; two inches off the table, the rested back down.  She didn&#39;t want to\n&gt; stop. She was like a child with a new toy. She was having fun.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
