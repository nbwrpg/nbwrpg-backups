Every moment in the chamber reminded him \nof that and the only thought going through him was the yearning for \nrevenge.\n\nThe newcomers seemed to be honoring thier end of the ceasefire or \nanother attack would have been launched. The Ark was short handed and \nhe was out of battle for a while, the war was looking more bleak by \nthe moment.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; How cheap, a Maximal lying about a battle!\n&gt; \n \n\n\n"}}
