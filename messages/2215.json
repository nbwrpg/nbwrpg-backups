She looked around a bit and decided that she liked this place, not a bot within miles and no battles to interrupt.\nShe felt another wave of comfort as he kissed her again and then leaned back, holding her to him.\nIron Raptor shook her head at his question, a soft chuckle rising from her. With the hand on his shoulder she pulled him a little closer to her, leaning in closely she said in a soft voice.*\n\n&quot; Here...&quot;\n\n* And with that she kissed him gently but then a bit firmer, it was her turn to teach the teacher. So to speak.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
