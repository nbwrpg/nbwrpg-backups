The Hellgate is right above them \nbut they need help fast to get out of the water.\n\nMelchana looks around, trying to find some kind of vine. She sees the \ncrane, but it is not long enough to get them.\n\nMelchana: AAAAAARGHH! Stupid technological ship! You can&#39;t find a vine \nwhen you need one!\n\nJetstorm is panicked. He was not prepared for this.\n\nJetstorm: Melchana! Why don&#39;t you do something?\n\nMelchana: And why are you not doing anything, Nutbrain?\n\nDaemos: Jetstorm, for the Matrix&#39;s sake! You&#39;re a hawk! Fly down there \nand pick them up!\n\nJetstorm: Y... Yeah... That&#39;s right... I can fly...\n\nHe transforms to hawk mode and flies down.\n\nJetstorm: Bel! Hold on to my talons!\n\nBelthassan: Finally! (He spits some water out) It was time one of you \nacted!\n\nThe waves were strong and violent. Belthassan had to use great stamina \nto keep his head out. He made a sweep with his hand to grab the talon, \nbut missed it widely. Still holding his brother, he moved his legs and \nswam nearer. The second pass succeeded, and Jetstorm used his large \nwings to get back and into the ship.\n\nAs soon as they were inside, Daemos closed the doors.\n\nMelchana: Anachronox, help me get them to regenerative units! It won&#39;t \nget them to full health, but it will at least get them back in some \nsort of shape!\n\n\n"}}
