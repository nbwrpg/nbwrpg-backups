All she wanted \nto do was to talk to Quickstrike and find out what happened.  He \ndidn&#39;t answer his commlink, and se had to find out what happened to \ncommander.  She was more loyal to Quickstrike than Megatron.  She \nwould follow Quickstrike to the inferno and back without a second \nthought.  Her programming demanded that she follow her commander.\n\n\n"}}
