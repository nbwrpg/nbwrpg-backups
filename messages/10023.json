Zardus made this ship, \nso he&#39;s got total controll, don&#39;t try to take it from him.&quot;\n\nBloodystrike looks at Skulletron, noting that the bot&#39;s hand is near his gun. \n&quot;The interior defences don&#39;t like weapon fire. Detection of any could cause a \nfew blast panels to trap you in a hallway, and the autoguns to finish you \noff, so be careful.&quot;\n\nBloodystrike looks around. &quot;That&#39;s about it for the bridge. Where do you want \nto go next? Torture chambers, the lab, the brig, weapon storage?&quot;\n\n"}}
