You see, the Maximals are getting ready for the \nPredicon attack and are in no position to fight. They are weak at this point. \nThat&#39;s where we come in. We will make a hit-and-run attack on the Maximals. \nWe will be in and out so fast they won&#39;t know what hit &#39;um. We cannot stay \nlong for they have more attack power. This will startle them and leave them \nopen for the Predicon attack. I&#39;ll contact Hellbeast and ask for some men. \n\n:: Activates comlink to Hellbeast&#39;s transmission. Wolfgang informs Hellbeast \nof the plan. ::\n\n"}}
