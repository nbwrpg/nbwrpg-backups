He isn&#39;t knocked out anymore.\n\n::Prowl/Zardus/Zenyak/Shredder::\n\nProwl catches his breath as Iron Raptor brushes against his shoulder, his \nwitty responce dying on his lips.\n\nHe shakes his head to clear it of the feeling that he was falling. What was \ngoing on? He was in a dangerous situation and yet he couldn&#39;t concentrate! He \nclenches his teeth.\n\nProwl keeps moving stealthily through the forest, trying to figure out what \nwas wrong with him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus walks into the bridge of the alliance base, fully healead and \nfunctional. He looks at the scanners, noticing the new maximal ship, and also \nthe newly arrived maximal and predacon signatures (The dinobots at the \ngestalt group).\n\nHis eyes narrow as he looks at the scanners again. He raises his comm-link to \nhis mouth. &quot;Nemesis, as soon as you are repaired, please join me at the \nbridge.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZenyak opens his eyes. He was laying on his stomach in a pile of seaweed. He \ngets up, rubbing his head.\n\n&quot;Computer, how long was I out?&quot;\n\nAfter several seconds of computation, his internal computer reports that an \nestimate was not possible. He growls and looks down at his wounds. Striker \nhad busted him up pretty good, he had to admit that.\n\n&quot;Slagging maximal,&quot; He grumbles to himself as he walks off through the forest.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nShredder looks at the predacon base. He chuckles. If he could get in, he \ncould do quite alot of damage. And the computer wouldn&#39;t recognize him as an \nenemy, thanks to Quickstrike. Due to a malfunction in his comm-link, he \ndidn&#39;t hear Quickstrike&#39;s last message, not knowing that the autoguns indeed \nhad different orders.\n\nHe walks on, confident, when an autogun swirls around, aiming at his chest. \nShredder&#39;s eyes widen.\n\nIn several seconds, he is laying on the wreck of a tree that he was blow into \nby the autogun.\n\nHe gets up, a severe pain present in his chest. He looks at the predacon base \nand puts his comm-link to his mouth.\n\n&quot;Quickstrike, disable the autoguns, I need to get in!&quot;\n\n"}}
