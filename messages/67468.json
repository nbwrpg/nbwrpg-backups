The electrical pulse strikes the area where Rodimus\n&gt; was lifting off and the surge shocks Rodimus. The energy travels\n&gt; through his systems and Rodimus cries out in pain and drops to his\n&gt; knees. Smoke is coming from his armor in multiple places. Rodimus\n&gt; looks down exhausted. His energon reserves are nearly spent.\n\nCyclonus hovers before the apparently exahausted Rodimus Prime, his\nhand cannons and shoulder mounted oxidation cannons ready to fire. Yet\neven as he about to fire something appears in his optics, perhaps\nrespect for a fallen warrior, perhaps something else entirely. Whatever\nit is, despite his own battle damage and energy loss, he pauses to\nspeak, &quot;You have lost Rodimus Prime.&quot; \n\nHe again focuses his hand cannons on Rodimus even as his shoulder\ncannons shut down, his hand cannons turn black again as they prepare to\nfire ...\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus)\n\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
