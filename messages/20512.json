She was hurt bad and from\nwhat he was told she&#39;d only open the wounds even more by putting pressure on\nit. He opened a comm, &quot;Ice, it&#39;s Lunarpine You are endangering yourself and\npossibly this entire planet.&quot; He hoped she could hear him but from what\nVeratis had told him her link might have been affected by the virus. He had\nto find her and fast. He sent a series of clean up drones ahead to see if\nthey could find her from the air. No effect was achieved. The scanners\nreported various life forms around.\n\nVeratis opened his comm trying to help with the search. &quot;She&#39;s at the end of\nscanner range. If she gets much further I won&#39;t be able to follow her.&quot; The\nconcern in his voice showed that he would not let this planet die because of\nhim.

She lifted her head and looked\n&gt; around. Her shoulder was becoming extremly painful. She winced and\n&gt; layed her head back down. She was thinking about how Lunarpine had\n&gt; reacted to her. She was certain that he wasn&#39;t happy with her new\n&gt; form. She sighed and stood up. She smelled that scent again. She\n&gt; looked and saw a form coming towards her. She didn&#39;t think anything\n&gt; of it and kept walking. Leaving a puddle of blood in the snow where\n&gt; she had layed down at. Her bandaged was soaked and was falling off.\n&gt; She shrugged her shoulder and let out a pained roar. THe bandage fell\n&gt; to the ground and she sniffed it. It smelled aweful and acidy.\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked on, as the snow fell to the ground a little harder.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Wolf::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; An organic arctic wolf made its way over the cold snow, sniffing\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; food.
