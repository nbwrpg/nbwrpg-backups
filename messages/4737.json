Where was all the glory? Where was all the Maximals \nto slag?!\nShe looked down halls as she passed them, thinking about how she&#39;d like \nGangon to be walking beside her. She smiled at that thought. Him with all \nhis comments about her pretty he thought she was, his crazy antics that made \nher laugh on the inside but she never showed.\nHe was a funny bot...but she had grown to like him...even a bit more then \nshe let on.\nIn plain...you could ALMOST say that she loved him.\nBrightBlade sighed again, but with him not with her at the moment she was \nstill bored out of her tree!\nWell, she could always ask if Hell Beast had anything he wanted her to do.\nShe opened her com-link to his frequency.\n\n&quot; This is BrightBlade. Is there anything in which you require me to do for \nyou, My Lord?&quot;\n\nShe quietly waited for a responce.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nRage growled as she looked between the trees and spoted the enemy ship, the \nhuge metal thing in which stank of steel!\nShe looked it over from her vantage point, how strange and ugly it was!\nShe then saw something walk out of it, it was another of those raptor \nthings! The things that tastes just as bad as the things they lived in \nsmelled!\nRage shook her head at remembering the taste, something she never wanted to \nsink her teeth into again!\nShe stayed where she was and watched, there was no point in giving away her \nposition when she didn&#39;t want to.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
