He was just a bundle of bot \nunderneath the blanket. He shook his head and stretched his legs out. He \ndidn&#39;t realize it at first, but he almost kicked Stingtra. She sat up, \nlooking at her.\n\n&quot;Morning,&quot; he said to her half unconsciously.\n\nHe striped the blanket off of himself and looked at the interior of the \ncave. It was daylight, so that meant there was more planing (if Megatron \nwanted it that way)to do. He saw Dark Mouse at the console. He need to talk \nto her. The new flier, Terrorsaur was just taking off from his perch that \nwas a mound of stalactmite. He stood up and walked towards Dark Mouse. He \nstood behind her and put his cobra hand on her shoulder.\n\n&quot;Ah want ya show me how this computer works.&quot; he said to her.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
