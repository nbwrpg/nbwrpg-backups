And the strange aspect of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that was the fact I just simp=\r\nly had a knack for solving complex strategies.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; He then thinks of Optimus Primal, and how they could determine his=\r\n last&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; location.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Mat=\r\nhematics, it has everything to do with numbers. The geographic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; coordinates, they lead to areas of latitude and longitude. Now, to fi=\r\nnd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Primal, he must have informed someone as to where he w=\r\nas going. We chart&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the distance between here and the inte=\r\nnded destination, and map out various&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; routes leading to t=\r\nhat location. You will come up with several different&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sce=\r\nnarios but, they will all point to one area of bilocation. We then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; factor in his rate of speed he was traveling at, including the ti=\r\nme he left&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; here, and the time it takes to reach the final=\r\n destination. Then, determine&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the time of his last transm=\r\nission and that will indicate how far he got and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; where he=\r\n could possibly be now. I know it sounds complicated, but it worked&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; on Cybertron, so let&#39;s see if that will work here.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;One thing I have fou=\r\nnd Tuscon is that often times one cannot solve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; every mystery w=\r\nhile sitting at the drawing board.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Manipulating=\r\n the console LEO attempted to locate the information. &quot;The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; las=\r\nt record of Optimus Primal . . . and at that point he was Optimal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Optimus, was at the Base of the Pacifist Maximals the Atlantis base.&quot;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; He paused and read further. &quot;An interesting point that was regi=\r\nstered&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; at that point was that thee was an Optimal Optimus Prim=\r\ne as well as an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Optimus Primal?&quot; LEO looked confused, then nod=\r\nded, &quot;There was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; meeting trying to determine if one was a min=\r\nion or not.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (OOC: See messages in Dec 2005 for =\r\nreference to what I&#39;m talking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; about. Tuscon was not here at th=\r\nat point, but the data logs are still&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; present)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; He paused, &quot;I don&#39;t see if anything was truely resolved on that=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; issue.&quot; Pausing again, &quot;Infact Primal disappears soon after t=\r\nhat with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; no other references given.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; (TAG)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Yahoo!
