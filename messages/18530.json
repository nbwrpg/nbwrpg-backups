What was happening? Phobia \nwas killed, and now an Alliance? Why would Black Arachnia do this? \nShe had her own group to rule and was a power here. She must have \nsome alterior motive. He would be the one keeping the close eye on \nthis Cyber Claw, and Black Arachnia. If any of them did something \nthat looked remotly like Treason, they are as good as dead.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon watched Slayer go off, or tried to because he was in cloak, \nwhen suddenly the moniter on the Tamer went off. Something was wrong. \nIt wasn&#39;t that he was getting no readings. If that happened than the \nchip would have been removed. Now the readings were changing every \nmili-second, like they had been scrambled. But there was no sign of \nany sort of device like that on the Ark.\n\n&quot;Damn it! They must have moved her,&quot; he said, sending a comm to \nSlayer, &quot;Come back. They have moved her. We must re-think our \nstrategy.&quot; Prebon pondered a bit, but than sent a message back.\n\n&quot;Stay there, actually. Blaze is going to come out yo you with the \nextra cloaking device. I want you to sneak up and place it on the \nWolf bot, and than knock him out, but don&#39;t kill him. We&#39;ll take him \nback to base and probe his memory for where they took her.&quot;\n\nBlaze hit her jet pack and tried to find Slayer.\n\n\n"}}
