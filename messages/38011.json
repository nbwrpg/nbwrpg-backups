He opened a comm link to all Decepticons. &quot;Stunticons,\n&gt; Terrorcons, report outside. Astrotrain and Cyclonus come as well.&quot; \nHe\n&gt; closed the comm-link, and looked at Blindfear, Nightstrike and\n&gt; Firestrike. &quot;You three, begin loading the ship full of energon.&quot; He\n&gt; turned to Shockwave. &quot;I assume you would like him repaired?.&quot; \nMegatron\n&gt; said, pointing at Unitron.\n\n\n"}}
