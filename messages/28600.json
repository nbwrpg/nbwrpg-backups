Her \nunique brain cleared of all though except for the kitten. In her mind she \nvisualized it, it&#39;s fur, it&#39;s large eyes, small paws and sharp claws. The \nsound of it&#39;s voice and everything else she knew about it. Then, she asked \nthat black void a question.*\n\n&lt;What is it?&gt;\n\n* Suddenly, she knew and her mind rushed to fill itself back up with the \nknowledge she gained during her life, blocking out the blackness. But she \nhad gained something more than an anwser during her medatation. She had \nglimpsed the battle field and the people in it. She saw Iron Raptor and \nProwl fighting, and knew why. It scared her in a way. She hadn&#39;t asked for \nthis information. What was happening to her?*\n\n&quot; Snow tech, it&#39;s the same as the white kitten, just female, and black.*\n\n* She cocked her head to one side and looked at Snow Tech*\n\n&quot; I saw Iron raptor in my medatation, but the other kitten wasn&#39;t there. \nWhere is it?&quot;\n\n* And like a prayer, her question was awnsered. The small kitten fell from \nthe sky above, striking her on the head and making her crash to the ground \nin a cloud of dust.*\n\n&quot; Wufff!!!!????!!!!&quot;\n\n* Snow Tech looked down at the twitching figure of his sister and cocked an \neyebrow.*\n\n&quot; Does THAT awnser your question?&quot;\n\n* He was anwsered with a groan and a dirty look.*\n\n&quot; Y..EES.....&quot;\n\n* He smiled and looked at the two kittens, who at the moment, where playing \ntag around Shadow cat&#39;s fallen body. He smiled and clasped his hands*\n\n&quot; Awwwwww!! They like eachother!&quot;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
