Then, without a second thought he left.*\n\n&quot; What&#39;s this?&quot;\n\n* She more or less spoke to herself but loud enough for anyone else to hear. \nJust what was she supposed to do woth it?\nIron Raptor wasn&#39;t really a Maximal, just her programming, so she had no \nclue at just what Angel Prime had dumped into her hands before disappearing.\nBut then suddenly Liono caught her attention and she simply kept her hands \naround whatever this thing was. Though from Liono&#39;s tome he almost seemed to \nbe mocking her and her authority. Even though he had been her commander \nbefore she didn&#39;t like him judging her worthyness to the commanding \nposition.\nIron Raptor looked Liono over before looking him straight in the face, her \nvoice just as low but with a firm grip to it.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m not opening jack squat until I know what&#39;s happening with that \nAlliance.&quot;\n\n* This was no time to give in at anyone until she knew what was going on.*\n\n&quot; There&#39;s a cease fire here and the longer it goes on the longer I&#39;m keeping \nthe CF on Lock Down. Understand?&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then leaned back and looked over her shoulder at the \nmurrmering voices of the Maximals.*\n\n&quot; Hopefully the Alliance will get in gear so we can get this over and done \nwith. We have more important things to do then waste our time with this, but \nwe have to wait unless we want the CF to look like the Ark.&quot;\n\n* She narrowed her eyes and looked towards Prowl, mainly because he was the \nclosest one to her. &lt; Who&#39;s still firing?&gt;*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
