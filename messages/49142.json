Controlling proto-humans isnt going\n&gt; to happen. The council\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; not put extremely important NPCs into the hands of\n&gt; players. In BW the\n&gt; &gt; Maximals interacted very little with the humans\n&gt; and thus that should be\n&gt; &gt; respected and shown in here. The protohumans would\n&gt; also get crushed in\n&gt; combat\n&gt; &gt; with TFs they lack the know how to do so. While\n&gt; controling humans persay\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t a bad idea, it still isn&#39;t that good of one\n&gt; especially when you are\n&gt; &gt; talking about human ancestors. After all you have\n&gt; to look at this from a\n&gt; &gt; logical point of view, just how many transformers\n&gt; are going to be\n&gt; attracted\n&gt; &gt; to primitive earth. We&#39;ve had 5 or 6 factions\n&gt; already crashland onto the\n&gt; &gt; planet, that in itself defys some rational\n&gt; thought. Yes back stories are\n&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; for them but sometimes its just enough. The RPG\n&gt; really doesn&#39;t need any\n&gt; &gt; wholey new factions to get it running again. It\n&gt; just needs a spark, an\n&gt; &gt; element of chaos if you will. So far everything\n&gt; that has appeared and\n&gt; &gt; happened has been pretty much voted on by the\n&gt; players, that just makes it\n&gt; &gt; boring. Once in a while something needs to happen\n&gt; that the players no\n&gt; nothing\n&gt; &gt; about. Better RPing skills are built that way. As\n&gt; for the quintesson\n&gt; &gt; question, they were always around as far as the\n&gt; fandom know. They made the\n&gt; &gt; transformers and in the continuity as far as my\n&gt; knowledge goes the gobots\n&gt; &gt; were never recognized, although it is possible\n&gt; that they were or could\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; been since in Five Faces of Darkness it begins\n&gt; with a galactic olympics,\n&gt; &gt; however they were also not able to identify one of\n&gt; the attackers that got\n&gt; &gt; caught so it also shows that at the time not\n&gt; everything was known. Anyway\n&gt; &gt; thats my 2 cents for now. Flame me if you want but\n&gt; this has been my\n&gt; unbiased\n&gt; &gt; opinion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
