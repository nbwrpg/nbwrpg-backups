Here he was, a well \nseasoned warrior who was stuck at home base with nothing to do.  She \nfelt sorry for him.  He wanted to see some action.  And quite \nfrankly, so did she.  She was bored as well.  She wanted to fight.  \nHer spark lived for fighting.  She loved bringing down an enemy and \nchewing on his remains.  But she was stuck at home base to with \nnothing to do.  She moved over and sat next to Quickstrike.\n\n&quot;Ok Boss-bot. Now what? Megatron and that mouse aren&#39;t back yet.  Do \nyou want to go on patrol of do some recon? If we are lucky, we will \nfind some bot lurking around to scrap.&quot; She had a slight smile on her \nface.  She was trying to comeup with anything to cure the boredom.\n\n\n"}}
