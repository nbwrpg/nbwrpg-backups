For a second, \nProwl didn&#39;t know who the face belonged to, or where he was, but it \neventually came flooding back to him.\n\nHe was in the Cybertronian Fire, the ship serving as the Maximal base. He had \nbeen severely injured in a battle somewhere... Yes, that must have been the \nreason he felt like his limbs was about to fall off. His optics come fully \nonline, or as fully as his damage can let them, and he finally recognizes the \nface.\n\nIt was Iron Raptor&#39;s, the love of his life. For a second, Prowl wondered why \nshe seemed to be crying, but then realized that it was probably about him.\n\n&quot;Am... Am I alive?&quot; he says, trying to sit up but wincing with pain as his \ntorso acomplishes nothing but a slight jerk.\n\n"}}
