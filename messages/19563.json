You picked a pretty bad time to do \nthis, though, not too many people are gonna be able to sneak up on \nthe Alliance base right now, or for a while yet. But, we&#39;ll see who \ngloats in the end (I don&#39;t like gloating so its either gonna be you \nor no one).\n\nFriendly tip to everyone: Don&#39;t leave your comp cases open and \nunattended if you have animals with claws/teeth in the house. I just \nreplaced my video card and half the wires in my comp.\n\n\n::DevilDuer/Zardus/WarMachine/Reptilica/Bloodystrike/Perndabot::\n\nDevilDuer checks his internal scanners as Diamond walks out of the \nroom, keeping track of her. He still didn&#39;t completely trust her.\n\nHe looks back at Vamprah, speaking up as she moves in her \nsleep. &quot;Hey, wake up,&quot; he says, ready to fight just in case, &quot;Rest \ntime&#39;s over.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus frowns, looking at the battle ground, only two Mafia members \nand another bot fighting against the Alliance. He turns around, \nflying off toward the Alliance base.\n\n&quot;Destroy their ship and then return to base,&quot; he says into his comm-\nlink to the Alliance members there, &quot;We will change locations soon.&quot;\n\n&quot;Come with me,&quot; he says to Najah as he flies by him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWarMachine stumbles back as shots hit him, returning fire at \nShokaract and Surge, several dozen laser shots and a few missiles \nflying at the two.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike catches up to Life, breathing heavily. &quot;Het, slow down \nhere,&quot; he says, &quot;WHat are you looking for?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica lands at the Alliance base, entering it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot laughs to himself as Klant leaves, obvioustly mistaking him \nfor a Maximal.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; he says to BrightBlade, walking out of the room.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; ::Vamprah::\n&gt; \n&gt; Vamprah was deeply sleep, when DevilDuel opened th cr&#39;s door. Her \n&gt; body agited quikly as if his precence was a menace but soon her \n&gt; breathing was getting calmyly and her movements relaxed, as if she \n&gt; were in a safe place. The expresion of her face was almost pacefuly \n&gt; and her movement were slow.\n&gt; \n&gt; She seemed that she was taking a nap. Anyone could guess the fierce \n&gt; fighting that minutes before she had been.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vamprah moved slowly as if she tried to find a confortable position \n&gt; to sleep.\n&gt; \n&gt; (NOte to Airshdow: If it&#39;s possible sleep confotable in that place)\n\n\n"}}
