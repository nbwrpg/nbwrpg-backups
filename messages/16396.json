There\nare\n&gt; quite a few people in the RPG who are set severely against that. If,\nhowever,\n&gt; no one has any problem with it, I&#39;ll repeal my decition.\n&gt;\n&gt; As to Bob Skir, I can&#39;t believe this is actually happening! I didn&#39;t think\n&gt; that we were this important! He&#39;s welcome to email me, but how do we know\nits\n&gt; the real him?\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Ramulus::\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus spins around, his hand on his gun as he looks at the trainers. His\n&gt; eyes narrow as he sees Spears in their grip.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus takes a few steps forward, watching the enemy carefully. He\nreaches\n&gt; into a compartment with his free arm, bringing out a device.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I have a holo-map right here,&quot; he yells over to them, holding up the\ndevice,\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll exchange it for Spears. I&#39;ll still meet you for Striker, though, if\nyou\n&gt; wish. You can return him to me then.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
