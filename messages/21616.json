Phobias former ship would be a good example, it was\ndesigned to hold up to 5 bots comfortably but had room for more. It had\nshielding that could be knocked out by a series of missles. (Nobody tried to\ndestroy it until the preds tried thier dramatic escape. Mini slipped a bot\ninto the ship when  I wasn&#39;t paying attention to the posts. It had forward\nguns that had to take time to recharge after firing depending on the force\nof the blast. (An easy target from all sides except the front. I set the\nlimitations within reason, I feal that other ships should be allowed\ndepending on limitations. All ships can be destroyed if the right weapon is\nused.\n\nPhobias ship was allowed for months until it was destroyed, other ships\nshould be allowed too.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 20, 2000 4:28 PM\nSubject: Re: MeowMix\n\n\n&gt; Allright, three men it is. And I formed up an official sounding rule\n&gt; (a variation of the original):\n&gt;\n&gt; Since there have been no mobile bases in the Beast Wars, and also\n&gt; since mobile bases give an unfair tactical advantage (and often lead\n&gt; to moding), mobile bases (any mobile craft other than a transport\n&gt; pod, one-person transport ship, or something to that extent is\n&gt; considered a base and is subject to this rule) are not allowed.\n&gt; Allowed vehicles are small (up to three bot) transports, with no\n&gt; onboard weapons, shields, or CR chambers. If you arrive on the planet\n&gt; in a ship not abiding to these rules, it must be grounded where it\n&gt; lands, and may not be moved.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; How does that sound?
