He sensed\nAstral firing again. he wasn&#39;t worried about him, the trainer leaders armor\nseemed to be holding well against the shots from Astrals rifle. Prebon fired\nhis rifle again destroying the second missle. His backpack was starting to\nsmoke from the way he was pushing for speed.

Shots ricochet off his armor as he gained speed in his\n&gt; &gt; attempt to keep up with Fenox. out of the corner of his optics he\n&gt; saw\n&gt; &gt; charges coming his way. the first of which caught him off gaurd\n&gt; &gt; exploding and forceing him to change direction.he grabbed the\n&gt; second\n&gt; &gt; one and redirected it down at Astral. the third one scored a solid\n&gt; &gt; hit causing a rupture in the back of his armor. he aimed his\n&gt; &gt; constrictor rifle up at Starlight and fired a beam that would knock\n&gt; &gt; the target out of the fight.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You fools are nothing more than a design flaw, I am the advanced\n&gt; &gt; model on this world.&quot; He yells as the chase continued.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
