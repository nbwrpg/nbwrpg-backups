He was tired and alone, as\n&gt; well as angry. For a few minutes, he lost interest in everything.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Quickstrike, Terrorize!&quot; he commanded his activation code. He quickly\n&gt; transformed to his robot mode, twisting his body parts around. His claws\n&gt; widened until they were flat, and he cried out as he put pressure on his\n&gt; legs. He stumbled forward and found himself on the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; He grunted and used his awkward hands and arms to lift himself up. He was\n&gt; actually risking alot in this mode. He could be more easier detected.\n&gt;\n&gt; He sat up, and rolled his trunk, groaning loudly, a little too loudly than\n&gt; he wanted. His leg hurt, badly. Transulas did a good job with wrapping his\n&gt; leg up, but all it did was keep his leg from bending and causing him more\n&gt; pain. He slowly stood, up and tried his luck on his leg, but only managed\nto\n&gt; get anywhere. He stumbled to the side, and fell across a log. His legs\n&gt; kicked up. His left leg remained elevated into the air.\n&gt;\n&gt; He groaned and tilted his head up. He slowly sat up, sitting on the log he\n&gt; fell over.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Dang.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked over and saw a small cluster of downed branches. He picked one\nup,\n&gt; and saw it wasn&#39;t the right form. He reached over again and pulled up a\n&gt; longer, sturdier branch. It would make for a fair walking stick. He could\n&gt; use it for balance if it didn&#39;t break.\n&gt;\n&gt; He then opened his comm-link to Megatron&#39;s troops. &quot;Anyone out there?\nAnyone\n&gt; at all?&quot;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *--- FREE VOICEMAIL FOR YOUR HOME PHONE! ---*\n&gt; With eVoice Now you can keep in touch with clients, vendors, co-workers,\n&gt; friends and family ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.
