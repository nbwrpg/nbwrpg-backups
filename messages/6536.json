She \nkept seeing Blur glancing over her.  She though he resembled an \namorous male lion in the mating season.  And she knew that she wasn&#39;t \nin heat. \nShe just kept looking at the table and looking about the room for any \nsign of trouble.  She felt uncomfortable inside the ship. She was \nused to open and spacious plains.  Not the confines of the ship&#39;s \nwalls. She wanted to go back outside.  But she had to finish this out.\nSHe sat back in her corner and watched the room.  Only now she \nwatched Phobia and Blurr.  She wondered wen the lion became the zebra.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Cheetors Revenge &lt;Cheetor_2002@j...&gt; wrote:\n Blur was quietly following Kluster and the other Maximals.  His mind \nwas on something different however.  He couldn&#39;t help but look at the \nlion bot.  She was, in his visual receptors, beautiful.  He forced \nhimself to talk slowly.  &quot;So, Now that we&#39;re sittinghere.  What is \nthe reason for this meeting?&quot;  He glanced back at the lioness. \n \n\n\n\n"}}
