I have\nsent . . . others to examine the ship, the possible base.&quot; There was\nanother chuckle, &quot;I believe they wanted the base more than you did.\nAlthough I do believe that they have ran into a bit of resistance.&quot;\n\nCyclonus&#39; voice cut in, &quot;Sir. Terrorsaur, one of your soldiers is not\nwith us.&quot; There was a pause as if Cyclonus was confiring with someone\nelse. &quot;The reports are saying that he has been missing since we came\nfrom your old base. When most of us left, it seems that somehow he did\nnot make the trip.&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s gone sir.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
