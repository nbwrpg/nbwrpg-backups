This is an excellent \nstronghold. \n&gt; The engin room...if they want to keep any kind of power I suggest \nthey \n&gt; surrender to us. But for now I want to talk to Killfest and \nDrillbit.&quot; \n&gt; Megatron said as he gazed into a monitor.\n&gt;        Paralysis brought up a visual comm and gave the go sign to \nMegatron. \n&gt; &quot;Killfest, you digusting a loathsome vermine, I dont know what \nyoure trying \n&gt; to pull but If you dont get out of my ship, not only will I cut all \npower off \n&gt; to you and your men, including the inviormental controls, I will \nflood the \n&gt; bridge and corridors with the exhust from the Transwarp engins. \nTrue, \n&gt; transformers dont need to breath, but you know as well as I do that \nit will \n&gt; strip your armor off in a matter of seconeds, leaving you a \npathetic pile of \n&gt; scrap where your spark will fizzle out.&quot; He smiled even more, &quot;And \nfrom here \n&gt; I also have access into the mainframe computer, so this whole \nlockdown thing \n&gt; isnt going to last for to long. I expect a message from you in no \nless than \n&gt; 30 minutes. If you dont respond I will flood this ship. Commander \nMegatron \n&gt; out.&quot; He said finally and turned off the visual link.\n&gt;        &quot;Very well done Megatron. Rampage, go and begin to churn the \nexhust \n&gt; from the engines, I want to expell it at a moments notice. As for \nthe rest of \n&gt; you, be wary, they will most likely try to get inside here, even \nthough there \n&gt; is a lockdown.&quot; Hell Beast said making himslef comfortable.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tarantulas sped through the corridors as fast as his vhicle \nmode would \n&gt; allow. The internal autoguns did fire apon him, but the shots that \ndid hit \n&gt; him did little to slow him down. The mech he was bleeding was a \nsmall wound \n&gt; that could actually be delt with manually.\n&gt;        Reaching his destination he transformed and ducked under the \n&gt; crossfire. Taking out a lockpick he carefully inserted it into the \ndoor tech \n&gt; lock and poped it open after a few minuted off password tag. He \nstepped \n&gt; inside and locked it agian behinde him. He walked over to the pod \nwhere the \n&gt; remains of Kitkat lay. The bitch was getting payback.\n&gt;        After ripping the wires from the pod, the ones responsable \nfor keeping \n&gt; the cloning process going, he ripped open the lid, took the \nremains, and \n&gt; chucked them over his shoulder. He turned and left the lab, the \ndoors open \n&gt; this time, and raced down that hallway, taking a hit in the \nshoulder that \n&gt; hindered him but a minute.\n&gt;        Apon reaching the engin room doors, rather large, thick \ndoors, he saw \n&gt; Inferno waiting to let him in. He pushed through and the heavy iron \ndoors \n&gt; shut quickly, air tight. He saw his fellow commrads around him as \nhe dumped \n&gt; her reamins on the floor.\n&gt;        &quot;Well done arachnid!&quot; Megatron said as he came closer. &quot;If \nthey want \n&gt; her back, they will negotiate. Otherwise Were going to pump he \npreety little \n&gt; corpse with enough ammo to make her look like she went through the \nexhaust \n&gt; process. Which, we might do anywas. Hahaha.&quot; He mused to himslef as \nhe poked \n&gt; her with his tail cannon gun.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Black Aracnia looked to Quasar. They were only down the hall \nfrom the \n&gt; rebels. If they found her and her daughter, you could bet she would \nlive very \n&gt; much longer.\n&gt;        &quot;Quasar, transform into beast mode and go into the hallwasy. \nI want \n&gt; you to run as fast as you can to the engin room. Thats the only \nroom as \n&gt; important as the bridge and I can bet Megatron is holding up there. \nTake \n&gt; these directions if you get lost. Im going to find Quickstrike.&quot; \nShe said, \n&gt; her eyes beginning to fill with tears from the worry she was \nunder. &quot;Just \n&gt; promise me you wont stop for anything, because if you do youre as \ngood as \n&gt; dead.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        The Predacons, under Megatron, were armed, and had been \nwaiting to \n&gt; fight for a long while. Kitkats plan to attack the Allience had \ntaken to \n&gt; long, thus the high tension they were having now. Once these rebel \nPredacons \n&gt; were delt with Megatron planned on making a few alliences of his \nown. But for \n&gt; now, Killfest, Drillbit, and that little bitch Darkmouse were the \ntop targets \n&gt; on his agenda.\n\n\n"}}
