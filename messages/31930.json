Well, at least it&#39;s never boring.&gt;\nShe lifted her head and blinked, shaking her head, deciding to set her rage \nupon the first thing she saw, which was...Divebomb!\nHowever, by the time her scanners had locked him into targeting she was \nalready running past bodies of the enemy and friend, her arms tucked close \nto her chest.\nShe was almost to him before letting out a screech/hiss between her teeth, \nthe scream evening out into a bellow, bearing her teeth...both sets.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
