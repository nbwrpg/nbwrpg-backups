It seemed so familiar to me, yet so \ndifferent.&quot; Primal Said. Just then he fainted. He was having another vision.\n    This time he was fighting someone, but he didn&#39;t reconize him. He had a \nwound in his side that went through. Then he started to talk.\n    &quot;I thought you were made of strener stuff,&quot; He said to the figure on the \nground. Suddenly Hot Rod, in a different body ran and grabbed the figure \nlying on the ground. Primal was shot and fell. His vision zoomed to another \nplace entirely. The place was filled with Sparks. He was in the Matrix, again.\n    He saw the Spark of Optimus Prime float to the Matrix to find peace, for \nit had been fighting for sometime now. He saw Cybertron, it was beautiful, \nand peaceful, no hate, no fighting. Then he saw that all change. The \nCybertron he came from was very different then this one. He went into the \npast and saw something he had seen before. The Dark God Unicron came forth, \nwith a Drake flying in front of it. Unicron started to change Cybertron to \nfit his vision of it.\n    He slowly awoke from the vision. He saw Hot Rod and Striker. &quot;How long \nhave I been out?&quot;\n\n"}}
