Phobia had deceived and swindled the \nDestrucon leader and he knew one day he&#39;d have slag to pay. Unless he \nhad a scape goat, or at least a scape panther to take the blow for \nhim. On this planet he needed all the shields he could find.\n\nPhobia to Pantor, if you&#39;re familiar with the Destrucon map of this \nplanet meet me at coordinates 9211-8 (What will one day be southern \nJapan.) If youcan arrange transportation. Keep radio silence from \nhere on out.\n\nAfter broadcasting the message to Pantor, he set communications to a \ngroup of Predicons he&#39;d detected near the Arks location. With the \npress of a button he repeated the comunication to them.\n\n(Megatron, Hellbeast, this means you.)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, ddsg sdgfd &lt;earth2025abc@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Pohbia i wish to join you.
