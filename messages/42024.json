Her \nblack matte body finish wouldn&#39;t shine, so it wouldn&#39;t attract \nattention.  In panther mode,she layed as close to the ground as \npossable and stayed perfectly still. If she could avoid a \nconfrontation, she would. With luck, they would mistake her for a \nshadow and move on.  If not, she&#39;d fight to the death.  One thing she \ncouldn&#39;t stand, was preds. She&#39;d normally fight a pred and win. But, \nout numbered, she was at a disadvantage. Best thing to do was wait \nand see what happened. \n\n\n"}}
