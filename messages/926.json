I \ndeleted the message before I could grasp the name. And I was mistaken, it \nwas acid. Sorry. But the affects are still the same.)\n\n* Dinobot snarled at Mosquitor&#39;s cry of rage, as far as he was concerned \nnobot could just expect to harm another and expect him to just stand and \nwatch! Even if it meant being pelted with acid!\nHe looked the Predacon straight in the optic and bared his teeth...*\n\n&quot; As long as I am functional I will strive to rid the universe of scum like \nyou!&quot;\n\n* Even though the drops of acid upon his chest sent waves of pain through \nhis body he stood tall and proud, and he would continue to do so either \nuntil this war had ended or his spark had ceased to exist.\nIt was then that the second wave of acid hit him, Dinobot snarled as the \npain intensified but still stood his ground, thankful that it wasn&#39;t \nTavatron who felt this excruciating pain!\nDinobot wiped the acid from his chest-plate but where it had hit his armor \nwas weakening, he knew that if anything he had to protect Tavatron from this \nstuff and try and keep his spark from being hit at the same time.\nNot an easy task!\nDinobot snarled and roared as he targeted and shot at Mosquitor with both \nhis optic laser and the rifle, he would not give up...no matter the cost!*\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
