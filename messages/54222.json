The elder male \nmeets her gaze and the pair of them stand there for just a moment, \nlooking at each other.  Then Skyblaze walks over and gently takes \nPhoenix in his arms.  With the tenderness one would show a young \nchild, he traces his finger along the charred lines of the nWo brand \non her chestplate.  As he touches the damaged areas, they glow and \nheal as if she&#39;d never been touched by the torch.\n\n&quot;Bless you, child,&quot; he says to her, quietly.  &quot;I was beginning to \nthink I&#39;d never find you.&quot;\n\nIn the back of Phoenix&#39;s mind, memories stir.  Her link to the \ncollective mind of her people restores itself, and she finally \nrediscovers her true identity.  &quot;Father ...&quot; she whispers, and the \ntwo of them hug each other tightly, parent and child reunited at last.\n\nOOC: Awwww ... okay, so it&#39;s a bit mushy.  A LOT mushy.  Yadda, \nyadda, put away the hankies and respond.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hollywood Narrator&quot; \n&lt;hollywood.narrator@v...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The second pod had cracked open near the nWo&#39;s base.
