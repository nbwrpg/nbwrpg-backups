This isn&#39;t what she had in mind. The most \nshe expected is that he would deflect it. Not fire it back! she watched as \nthe bolt came towrds her, she was not worried. Electric energy did her no \nharm, she was a part of it as much as it was a part of her. But she did not \nwant them to know that. She placed her open hands in front of her and \n&quot;caught&quot; the bolt as it came at her. Again she gathered it up, but she knew \nit would be usless to fire it back. So, instead, she gathered it up and \nstored it in her porpultion systems. She turned them on and flew off with \nher extra boost of speed. She swooped down and caught SNow Tech around the \nwaist and again flew up into the clouds, hoping they would provide some \ncover from the Pred.*\n\n&quot; Snow Tech, you need to use your ice beam to freeze his feet, so he can&#39;t \nmove. I&#39;ll see what i can do from there. Oh, and i hope you can fly&quot;\n\n* Shadow Cat then let go of his waist, letting him fall to earth. Snow Tech \nscreamed, closed his eyes and spread his wings. He didn&#39;t know how to fly, \nbut he could glide. He soared downward for a good five seconds before he \nrelized that he wasn&#39;t falling, but flying. Of sorts. He glided into a small \nstand of brush, landing akwardly, but he managed to untangle himself before \nanyone could notice. He krept out of the bush, and creeped up on the large \nPred. He called up all the Winter energy he could, and filed it into his \nblaster. When that was done, he pointed the gun not at it&#39;s head, but it&#39;s \nfeet.*\n\n&quot; This aught to stall him for a bit!&quot;\n\n* And he fired a wide beam, making sure that it would hit it&#39;s feet-up.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
