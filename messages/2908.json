Of course her troops would spare Iron Raptor, however,\nbut\n&gt; &gt; she walked to the base to say goodbye to her old friend Iron Raptor. She\n&gt; &gt; passed Ramhorn on the bridge, looking at him she laughed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Little Ramhorn, Maximal worshipper!&quot; Plintissa said. Plintissa walked\n&gt; away\n&gt; &gt; from the base, deciding to tell Iron Raptor goodbye over commlink.\n&gt; Plintissa\n&gt; &gt; and Dracona walked out and sat in the meadow. Plintissa called out to\n&gt; Liono\n&gt; &gt; on her commlink.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Liono, I don&#39;t give a damn about your troops. It&#39;s time for some\n&gt; maiming.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa said. Dracona pulled out a heavy blaster rifle from her Cyber\n&gt; &gt; storage compartment and handed it to Plintissa. Plintissa locked it onto\n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; arm and smileed. Dracona locked onto her arm an ion disk launcher.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Let&#39;s get ready to rumble!&quot; Plintissa yelled out. Plintissa leapt on\ntop\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; a rock, Sinesis and Sinister standing behind her with Dracona. Plintissa\n&gt; &gt; called Iron Raptor on her commlink.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor, this is Plintissa, sorry but goodbye, I can not be your\n&gt; friend\n&gt; &gt; anymore, all because i&#39;m not wanted here anymore.
