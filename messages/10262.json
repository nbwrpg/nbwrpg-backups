Skulletron fired a shot from his Seeker Missile gun\nthat hit the hologram right in the temple.  The hologram&#39;s head went flying\noff of its body.  The hologram was still fighting, but was covered in\nholographic mech fluid and it was stumbling.  Skulletron put his gun back\nand did a flying karate kick that sent the bot flying.  Then he backed up\naway from the bot laying helplessly on the ground and fired another seeker\nmissile at it.  Amazingly, the holographic bot pulled out a ray gun and\nfired it at the missile, and the missile blew up in the middle of the room.\n\n\t&quot;Your good.  Very good.  Very good at getting me to show off my real\npower!&quot; Skulletron said.\n\n\tSkulletron went into beast mode and stared at the headless bot.  Then\nSkulletron started laughing to what seemed like death.  Then the bot&#39;s body\nstarted rolling around on the ground and kicking its legs insanely.  The\nbot&#39;s head started laughing so hard that it could drive the most funniest\nclown insane. \n\n\tThe head started speaking while laughing, &quot;That would be sooo funny if, ah\nha ha ha!!!!  It would be funny if someone just decided to self destruct\nthemselves just because, haaaa ha haaa!!!  Just because someone called them\ndumb!  Oh ya, haaaaaaaaaa haaaaaaa haaa ha ha!!!!  That would be like\nlaying a mine down on his head, just like this sort of!&quot; The bot pulled out\na timed mine and sat it on his body and then on his head.  \n\n\t&quot;And then just, aahhhhh haaa!!!  Then blow up&quot;!  BANG!!!!!\n\nSkulletron was knocked back by the blast.  \n\n\t&quot;I have the ability to change bot&#39;s emotions!  That is my true power!&quot;\n\n"}}
