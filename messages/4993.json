Sidestepping, letting the \nrest of the laser fire go by, he fired an optic blast at Striker.\n\nHades raised his laser rifle, firing four bolts, two at Rhinox&#39;s back, then \nlower at his skid plates.\n\nUnitron raised his rifles, firing three bolts from each, three heading for \nRhinox, the rest heading for Beachcomber.\n\nKoga Shuko fired four optic blasts, one at each rocket.  He braced himself, \nthe shockwave nearly tumbling him over.  He fired a rocket off at Sniper&#39;s \npelvis.\n\nSixshot transformed into his space fighter mode, lifting off into the air and \ngaining altitude.\n\n---\n\nBeachcomber yelled, rolling to the left, one ion disk missing, the other \ncutting into his right side.\n\n---  \n\n\n"}}
