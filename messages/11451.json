He saw many things, \nwhich will help him along the way. But one thing he saw, made him \nburst into tears. He saw Soundwave&#39;s death about a mega-cycle before \nit was supposed to happen. The convix spoke to him while he was \nseeing this image.\n\n&quot;You can save him. This hasn&#39;t happened yet, but it will soon. You \ncan go and save him, but if you do, than this information you are \nlearning will be erased and you not be able to get it back again, and \nyou will be unable to save Cybertron. This is to teach you that \nsacrifices must be made sometimes for the greater good. It isn&#39;t \neasy, and I don&#39;t like it, but it may soon be neccesary. So what do \nyou choose?&quot;\n\n&quot;Soundwave.......he was the first. When I first came here, when I was \nVulois the evil Predacon, he was the first to come with me, and join \nmy cause. Sure, it was different then, but he still trusted me. And \nnow I have to let hime die?!? I can&#39;t......but I must. Cybertron is \nat stake, at Soundwave would want me to continue. I choose the \ninformation.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Vulois.....&quot;\n\nRemembering this made Vulois feel the lowest low. By now Soundwave \nmust be dead. Days have gone by. He only hopes that he won&#39;t have to \ndo the same for Cybershark and Battera. Or for anyone else.....Wait a \nminute!\n\nVulois went to his feet. Maybe all is not lost! Child! The one he \npormised to train! With his help is the only way Cybertron can be \nsaved. And when he&#39;s up there on Cybertron, in front of The Matrix, \nhe can retrieve Soundwave&#39;s spark! Salvation could still be at hand! \nHe contacted HeraldAngle.\n\n&quot;Herald, this is Vulois, from the emissary. I am ready to train your \nson now. Bring him to me.&quot;\n\nVulois was about to ease up, when he saw something out the window: A \nbot(Windrazor), wanting to come in. He went out to him.\n\n&quot;What are you doing out here? Come in come in, and tell me why you \nare here.&quot;\n\n(Can anyone can tell me if my other chars, Fliq and Bronco, made it \nback to The Ark with Ramulus? Thanx!)\n\n\n"}}
