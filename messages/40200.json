He was\npoised with his only weapon, a reflective staff. The 2 small cannons\nfired and he deflected both shots. Then his incredible senses\ndetected a slight soundless shift in the metal beneath his feet. He\nquickly turned,hurled the staff at the source,and jumped away from the\nnext 2 beams. He then stared astonished as Mustex caught the staff in\nmid flight.\nRhesus:Computer,deactivate firing pattern. You&#39;ve improved.\nMustex:Shutup. I&#39;m here to ask for your help. I need to find the\nMutants. I need Veratis to pinpoint how Stallex started as a baby and\nworked his way up to this age. With Veratis&#39; access to protoforms\nmaybe I can force him to create dozens of new Maximal babies.\nRhesus:No.\nMustex:Come on. You weren&#39;t always a piece of slime. Do you remember \nwhy you\ncarry that staff.\nRhesus:No.\nMustex:Well I do, because you have to much honor to carry a blaster.\nRhesus:Go away.\nMustex:Fine then! Maybe my best friend died with the other Carnitrons.\nRhesus:I always told you times change.\nMustex:Finish your own quote, but warriors never do!\n\n I have no intentions of vastly using Rhesus. He&#39;s just another Trump \ncard\nfor Mustex(the first being Stallex). He&#39;ll probably just jump out from\nbehind a boulder and save Mustex or Stallex&#39;s circuits.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
