One is that my dad is visiting and I have to \nshow him around town and stuff so I hardly have any time to be on the \ncomputer at all, much less update the site, and two is that I still \nneed to write them.\n\n::The Galactors::\n\nBoth jets turned, flying away from the base as fast as the could. The \nVycir/Slasys jet managed to evade the four EMP blasts, spinning \nwildly in the air to do so. It turns, firing three more shots at the \nshields.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing that the missiles wern&#39;t working, the Supernova/Scrap/Flare \njet activates its one non-explosive weapon, firing one large plasma \nshot at the shields of the base.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;       Yan, is there a reason the Galactors arent on the site?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        Tarantulas sees the jets coming on his viewscreen. The radar \npicks up \n&gt; the missles shot by Supernove instantly and responded with four \nquick laser \n&gt; blasts from the turrets. The missles exploded before reaching the \nshield, \n&gt; sending debris flying this way and that.\n&gt;        The Vycir/Slasys&#39; laser fire battered the shield, but didnt \ndrain to \n&gt; much power. The EMP canon released five silvery blasts swirling at \nhigh speed \n&gt; towrds the jet.\n&gt;        &quot;A joint attack heh?&quot; Tarantulas says to himself in almost a \nchuckle. \n&gt; &quot;Let them try! This base will stop them all. The Iron Fist couldnt \npenetrate \n&gt; this base.&quot; He sent word to Hell Beast of Zardus&#39; plans.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Nighteyes and Craken continue to monitor the frequency \npatterens and \n&gt; radio traffic of the Black Fortress, and recive Zardus&#39; \ntransmission. &quot;Looks \n&gt; like Zardus has an agenda.&quot; She says, looking at Craken.\n&gt;        &quot;Our base will hold itself well. Bots like Zardus can only \nsend \n&gt; obsticles. It is us who must over come them.&quot; He replied. His white \neyes were \n&gt; distant somehow.\n\n\n"}}
