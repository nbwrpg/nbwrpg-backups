He looked at \nthe half moon and opened his fluidy jaw.\n\n&quot;Howwwwwwlllllll&quot;\n\nHe pressed on with the thought of what he&#39;d do when he met up with \nthe Pred that did this to him. &quot;I have your scent monster&quot; the words \nechoed through his mind. The wolf had another reason for survival, \nrevenge.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine remained in wolf mode as he limped along. he could feel \n&gt; pressure on his internal damage. Slowly he worked his way back \n&gt; towards the Ark, He knew he had to make it back to the ship, he \n&gt; couldn&#39;t die in such a stupid pigheaded way. He&#39;d promised Shadow \n&gt; Wing that he&#39;d protect her, The wolf had to make it back. He took \nno \n&gt; pride in his stupidity and he knew that Shadow Wing wouldn&#39;t let \nhim \n&gt; forget it.&quot;Maybe death would be preferable.&quot; he thought, he \nlaughed, \n&gt; pain shot through his receptors. He wasn&#39;t far from Maximal \nscanners \n&gt; now and it wouldn&#39;t be long until they could find him. The \nscavengers \n&gt; circled above him, he could hear the preditors in the distance, but \n&gt; this wolf wasn&#39;t on the menu.\n&gt; \n&gt; He had promises to keep\n&gt; \n&gt; And miles to go before he sleeps.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Gold star for anyone who can say where I paraphrased.)\n\n\n"}}
