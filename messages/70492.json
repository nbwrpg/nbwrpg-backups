Although he could not see him, he could sense his pressense. He then tur=\r\nns his head back to lie back and as he does so, he closes his eyes, to reac=\r\nh deep down into that special place in his spark, the one he could feel for=\r\n Talon, and everyone else, the one that lead him back to Rodimus instead of=\r\n abandoning him in the dark insectile pit.  It may not have been the Matrix=\r\n, but it was something of his own accord.   Yet, he takes a moment to slip =\r\nback into a trance like state, to consult the matrix power within him.\n\n&quot; P=\r\nrimus, I could not leave Rodimus abandoned in the dark pits of the Black Fo=\r\nrtress, even though he had told me to do so.  It is not his time, and I wil=\r\nl not see him die needlessly.  Give me the strength to  reach Rodimus, and =\r\nbring him back into the light, where he belongs.  I know I can do this, I h=\r\nave to do this, in your honor I will never give up on my bretheren.&quot;\n\nOutsi=\r\nde the observation room, Night Shift stands close to Silverbolt, with the s=\r\name kind of hope and faith as his comrade.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re right Silverbolt, we c=\r\nan do this, we have what it takes ta overcome the worst and give it our bes=\r\nt.  We&#39;ve got somethn&#39; Hydras will never have, somethn&#39; we got gon&#39; on righ=\r\nt here, and somethn&#39; that ain&#39;t shot out of some fancy plasma weapon.&quot;\n\nStr=\r\naight Shot now consoles Noctorro.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re worried that Tucson might not c=\r\nome out of it, I can&#39;t blame you for being worried because this is a really=\r\n risky step he&#39;s taking.  But I can tell ya that, Night Shift&#39;s right. We g=\r\not something that beats the most powerful weapon in the universe, and Hydra=\r\ns doesn&#39;t have it.  It&#39;s something we all share, something deep down inside=\r\n us.  And unless you know what compassion is, you&#39;ll never have that specia=\r\nl power.&quot;\n\nShe gently puts a hand on Noctoro&#39;s leg.\n\nYou got that special p=\r\nower, I know you do.  He&#39;ll make it, you&#39;ll see, Tucson Prime will make it.=\r\n\n\nRat Trap keeps his hopes up and eyes on what happens inside the room.\n\n&quot; =\r\nWe just gotta hold onta hope guys, we just gotta.  I know I will. &quot;\n\nStraig=\r\nht Shot ponders things for a moment.  She could feel something deep down in=\r\nside of her, and she felt that she needed to share that with others.  So, s=\r\nhe gives her hand to Perceptor at first, and another to Rat Trap, who smile=\r\ns back.  He then turns and gives Night Shift his hand, as Night Shift smile=\r\ns, and then gives Silverbolt his.\n\n&quot; I think I know where she&#39;s gon&#39; with t=\r\nhis..  We gotta pull tagether guys.  Our hope in our leader is what&#39;s gonna=\r\n pull him through. After all, didn&#39;t someone say till all are one at some p=\r\noint or other?  Well, this is where we get ta test that out.  Who&#39;s with us=\r\n?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson lies on the bed, and waits for Stanton to hook h=\r\nim up to connect him to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I promised to save him Stanton, I=\r\n will not go back on my word. I know I will be able to do this, and if any =\r\nharm comes to me, then nothing will be held against any of you but myself. =\r\nI will take full blame for what happens. In Primus&#39;s speed my friends, in P=\r\nrimus&#39;s speed. Good will prevail, and the light will remain forever lit. No=\r\nw, let&#39;s do this before we lose him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He lies still to await hookup=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon nodded as he he gestured for Legacy to begin conne=\r\ncting Tuscon\n&gt; to Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This is alien technology that is affecting=\r\n Rodimus.&quot; Bump spoke up\n&gt; from his position next to Tuscon. &quot;We do not kno=\r\nw what will happen or\n&gt; how this will affect you or Rodimus. Be very carefu=\r\nl.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon pointed to a seperate scanning module, &quot;We will be watching=\r\n\n&gt; your spark signature as well. If it should dip into critical levels we\n&gt;=\r\n shall pull you out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;He is ready.&quot; Legacy said as he connected two t=\r\nhick cables and\n&gt; several smaller ones to Tuscon&#39;s power module.\n&gt; \n&gt; Santo=\r\nn nodded again, &quot;Begin.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *    *    *    *    *\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Outsi=\r\nde in the observation room, it doesn&#39;t take Straight Shot long to see what =\r\nis going on. But deep down she knew he was doing the right thing, she felt =\r\nit too. Night Shift could also feel what his comrade was up to, and a feeli=\r\nng of absolute positivity comes over him as well. Quickstride, however has =\r\nthe same feelings as Noctorro and Bump. But Rat Trap holds onto the positiv=\r\nity that Straight Shot and Night Shift share as well as Silverbolt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot; I know wheels, he&#39;s gonna make it, I know he is. Somethn&#39; inside me tell=\r\ns me so and that doesn&#39;t happen too often.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to =\r\nhim, and holds his hand.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You feel it too, so do I. He can do this,=\r\n I know he can. Silverbolt&#39;s right, he can do this. We have to believe he c=\r\nan. It&#39;s our belief in him that&#39;s gonna make him pull through.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nig=\r\nht Shift keeps a finger crossed as he stands next to Silverbolt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Y=\r\nou feel it too, huh Silverbolt. That deep down feeling that no matter what =\r\nhappens, good is gonna prevail. It&#39;s real guys, it&#39;s real. Tucson Prime&#39;s g=\r\not somethn&#39; inside him that I can&#39;t explain but it&#39;s there and it&#39;s gonna w=\r\nork.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap chimes in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Just think, we&#39;ll have two Prim=\r\nes plus Lord Elder, and Lord Perseus on our side. That&#39;s really gonna put a=\r\n damper on lizard lip&#39;s day. Ohh yeah, when we&#39;re all back tagether, look o=\r\nut, because that golden age is just a few shots away.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Sho=\r\nt listens to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; And then maybe, just maybe we&#39;ll have something=\r\n to celebrate.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Silverbolt continued to watch the operation=\r\n through the glass, his\n&gt; face lightly reflected in the glass was thoughtfu=\r\nl as his optics took\n&gt; in the scene. &quot;We will be victorious, because have t=\r\no be.&quot; he said as\n&gt; his own hand clamped down. He was a soldier, a knight, =\r\nwho was ready\n&gt; to do battle, and yet there was nothing to battle. He felt =\r\nhelpless.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet none of that was on his face as he looked back, &quot;Sometim=\r\nes all we\n&gt; have is hope.&quot; he said his voice confident. &quot;No doubt Hydras is=\r\n also\n&gt; using this time to consoldate his black army for what ever evil sch=\r\neme\n&gt; he has in mind.&quot; He smiled, &quot;But we shall be ready for him, with all\n=\r\n&gt; of our combined might.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked back at the operation as Tuscon wa=\r\ns being connected, &quot;We\n&gt; will be waiting for you when you return.&quot; he said,=\r\n his voice low.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
