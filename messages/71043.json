Usually quite light hearted, Quickstri=\r\nde appears a bit nervous as does his friend, who&#39;s fur ripples with anxiety=\r\n.  He could sense a trap in the making.  His tail hangs low, while body lan=\r\nguage suggests &quot; I know something is wrong, just a matter of time before it=\r\n shows it&#39;s ugly head&quot; kind of pose.  Quickstride snorts.\n\n&quot; Something tell=\r\ns me our problems aren&#39;t quite over with.. Maybe we should get inta robot m=\r\node for this.&quot;\n\nUproar nodds.\n\n&quot;Yeah, well, us anyway, because we&#39;re not tr=\r\nansmetal.  We&#39;re far better off in robot mode, effective wise.  That&#39;s wher=\r\ne we can acess our weaponry.&quot;\n\nThey get into robot mode, as Quickstride hol=\r\nds a large cannon over one of his shoulders, while Uproar draws a katanna f=\r\nrom a scabbard behind his right shoulder.\n\n&quot;Ninjas huh?  I think I can get =\r\naround Ninjas if I have to.&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks to him.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t get cocky, =\r\nUproar.  Something tells me this is someone we haven&#39;t got a clue as ta how=\r\n ta deal with &#39;em.&quot;\n\nOn the way back to the ark, Tucson desperately tries t=\r\no access the power to at least drive himself back to base, yet, finds that =\r\nhis engine will not restart.\n\n&quot; Hmm?  Have - no battery power.&quot;\n\nRat Trap n=\r\nodds.\n\n&quot; I bet Lizard Lips severed one of the wires that connects ta your b=\r\nattery.  Lemme check.&quot;\n\nHe scampers to the engine, via the glove compartmen=\r\nt, and finds the trouble.\n\n&quot;I was right, kind of.  Your wiring&#39;s totally fr=\r\nied big guy.  Ouch a rama...  Battery&#39;s okay, alternator&#39;s good..  Woahh, h=\r\nello, severed fuel line spotted.  Must&#39;ve missed that one when I patched up=\r\n that last battery fluid line.  No wonder, you&#39;re outa fuel and ya got no p=\r\nower gon&#39; ta the battery.&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n\n&quot; I have to be more careful.&quot;\n\nR=\r\nat Trap returns to the cab as he gives his large friend that &quot;I told you so=\r\n&quot; kind of expression.\n\n&quot;Yeah, well, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been tryn&#39; ta tell ya=\r\n Wheels.  From now on, you&#39;re gonna listen ta us right?&quot;\n\nTucson replies wi=\r\nth a slight groan.\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot;\n\nHe now turns his com link on to Rodimus.\n=\r\n\n&quot;Rodimus, this is Tucson, I need to know the status of the situation at th=\r\ne Ark, over.&quot;\n\nNight Shift continues to towe along with Bantor and the othe=\r\nrs.\n\n&quot;Hey, don&#39;t even think of playn&#39; hero again Tucson!  You&#39;re not in the=\r\n best of condition!  Can&#39;t even start your engine let alone gon&#39; inta activ=\r\ne duty.  Hey, Talon, make sure he doesn&#39;t try anythn&#39; risky. Knowing him, i=\r\nf he can walk, he&#39;ll attempt it.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyc=\r\nlonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; INSIDE THE SHIELD!\n&gt; \n&gt; The trip insid=\r\ne the shield was quick as the device the Rodimus was carrying\n&gt; seemed to o=\r\npen a door in it, forcing energy away, redirecting it in a\n&gt; strange way aw=\r\nay from one section. As each of the maximal&#39;s jumped through\n&gt; there was a =\r\ncrackle of energy and as the last one entered the shield snapped\n&gt; closed w=\r\nith a loud pop, leaving an angry buzzing sound behind!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That gimmick n=\r\not going to work again.&quot; Rodimus quipped as he looked back to\n&gt; make sure t=\r\nhat everyone was alright.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Exclaims Quickstride as Upro=\r\nar sniffs around, padding about\n&gt; &gt; the Ark, as if smelling something stran=\r\nge. He paces back and forth.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t like this, I&#39;m smelling somet=\r\nhing strange, something\n&gt; &gt; unidentified..&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He points with his paw,=\r\n to let Rodimus know where the scent is\n&gt; &gt; coming from.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;In there,=\r\n that direction.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride sniffs as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ohh boy, ohh=\r\n yeah, I smell it too. Doesn&#39;t smell good at all..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wing Ca=\r\nliber looked slightly confused, as he shook his head &quot;A ninja,\n&gt; leaving be=\r\nhind an easy scent, that doesn&#39;t sound right.&quot; His voice was just\n&gt; above a=\r\n whisper.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus, the Maximal Scout and survivalist grunted as he kep=\r\nt his voice low\n&gt; as well. &quot;I used to do that too, lay down false scents an=\r\nd trails.&quot; He\n&gt; looked around for a moment, his optics narrow and watchful,=\r\n &quot;Be ready for\n&gt; anything. It could be a trap.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus nodded as he w=\r\naved for them to be as quiet as possible and to follow\n&gt; him as he led them=\r\n quickly towards the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; As they stepped into the main chamber Rodium=\r\nus quickly began looking over\n&gt; the inert bodies of Optimus and Megatron as=\r\n well as the other Autobots and\n&gt; Decepticons who were lying here, waiting =\r\nfor the reawakening a few million\n&gt; years from now. So far there didn&#39;t see=\r\nm to be any damage or any sign of\n&gt; disturbance, but they had little time f=\r\nor a thorough search.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a few hand gestures Wing Caliber and Leo II=\r\n indicated they were going\n&gt; to the bridge. There was an answering one from=\r\n Rodimus as he and Ramulus\n&gt; were going to head to the med bay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Leo II=\r\n motioned for Uproar and Quickstride to follow him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Outside the [Tower], Tucson could feel the explosion, as it rocks him\n&gt; so=\r\nmewhat, almost losing stability on his wheels. He quickly rights himself\n&gt; =\r\nwith a bit of a struggle.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;SNIP . . . &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson sighs.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I - can not ask for a better group of comrades. What I ever wanted=\r\n is\n&gt; right here, with - all of you. And - if we don&#39;t always win the battl=\r\ne, - it\n&gt; - wasn&#39;t meant to be. Absolute - power can never replace what I h=\r\nave which I\n&gt; - consider most valuable. There is no price that can overshad=\r\now what we\n&gt; share. And - there never will be.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He thinks for a mom=\r\nent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Something, that - Hydras nor Megatron, could ever appreciate.=\r\n I - suppose\n&gt; that is why Hydras is never satisfied with what he has. He -=\r\n always has to\n&gt; have more power, more dominence, more destructive oppressi=\r\non. I will - not\n&gt; feed into his hunger for such things. Tables will turn, =\r\nit - will just take\n&gt; time, my friends... It - will just take time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; His engine cuts out once again. Night Shift takes up his harness once\n&gt; m=\r\nore.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I knew it, good thing we&#39;re still around.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ba=\r\nntor nodded at the request for him to hook back up to Tuscon. He did not\n&gt; =\r\nseem to be `happy&#39; to help pull the large Autobot, but at a look from Torca=\r\n\n&gt; he got in position.\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca on the other hand continued to walk ahead=\r\n of the group, his gait while\n&gt; seemingly slow, was long and steady and was=\r\n able to cover a lot of ground in\n&gt; a relatively short period of time.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The ground beneath the Maximals rumbled ominously a few times, but did\n&gt; n=\r\nothing else as they walked. Occasionally insects and birds made themselves\n=\r\n&gt; heard as the team made their way through the thick foliage and underbrush=\r\n of\n&gt; the wild lands between them and the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It feels like we are b=\r\neing watched.&quot; Bantor said under his breath as he\n&gt; walked infront of Tusco=\r\nn oulling on the harness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca lowered his head, &quot;I feel it too. Ther=\r\ne is something out here, and I\n&gt; hope it&#39;s friendly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Perceptor sat down far away the group and said with an unusual\n&gt; &gt; not o=\r\nf sadness in his voice &quot;One minute in silence for my\n&gt; &gt; Greatest Creation =\r\nof all: The Black Fortress...
