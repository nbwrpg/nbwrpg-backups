It&#39;s going to help you with your aim in battle and give \nyour systems a power boost while fighting.  This should only take a \nminute.&quot;  She installed a small chip into KitKat3&#39;s cyberbrain stem \nand closed the panel.  Now KitKat3 would recieve messages from Zardus \nand follow his orders without the commlink. &quot;Your all done&quot;\n\nKitKat3::\n&quot;Wow, that was fast. OK, well, I&#39;m off. Take care. And keep that CR \ntank ready just in case.&quot;  She left the lab and headed for the \nentrance. \n----------------------\nDiamond::\nShe frowned. She didn&#39;t want to scout anything.

Can you return to the Pack and unite them back up? They \nhave \n&gt; missed your leadership. However, first report to Squizzy, she has \nan \n&gt; upgrade for you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He then sends a message to Squizzy, which read: &quot;Squizzy, KitKat is \n&gt; on her way over to you. Install something in her that will make her \n&gt; listen to me, then send her on her way.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; FZ recieves Diamond&#39;s message, replying. &quot;Hmm.

It was one of the toughest training programs \nthe \n&gt; &gt; center had.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She walked out of the training center two hours later, covered in \n&gt; &gt; bruises and mechfluid.  She looked like the pit, but she felt a \nlot \n&gt; &gt; better.  She walked down the halls, leaving a small trail of \n&gt; fluid.  \n&gt; &gt; She made it to her quarters and got cleaned up.  She smiled, &quot;I \n&gt; think \n&gt; &gt; thingsss will work out jussst fine.&quot;  She called up FZ,&quot; Oh great \n&gt; &gt; leader, what do you have for Diamond to accomplisssh today?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She knew that you caught more flies with honey than with vinagar, \n&gt; so \n&gt; &gt; she used a sweet tongue to get FZ to give her a job to do. She \n&gt; wanted \n&gt; &gt; to kill a maximal. She killed one pred leader, now she wanted \n&gt; another \n&gt; &gt; victim to play with.\n\n\n"}}
