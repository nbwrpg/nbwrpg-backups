St. Hillary in\n&gt; the names of the inhabitants, and that it is night out.\n\nOOC: It is not mobile, but it is not yet quite burried completely and\nso one can be sitting on top of it and looking at the stars. And it is\non Earth.\n\n&gt; &lt;IC&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; IIT was much later, or perhaps much sooner, but Wheelie sat outside.\n&gt;\n&gt; Looking up at the heavens, or what they would be in several thousand years\n&gt; known.\n&gt;\n&gt; His astrography program trying to map them, where they were now in relation\n&gt; to the past, where his programs of the future would tell him what was, what\n&gt; would be.\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing up at the planet at the time known as Quintessa, where even now he\n&gt; (or himself of the age) would be in hiding, fighting Sharkticons to stay\n&gt; alive, Wheelie just remembered.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thinking to that time however much later, he just sat back, glancing at hte\n&gt; heavens.  The small Mini-Car, Autobot Survivor, watched up.  The past was\n&gt; changing.  Gazing at the moon, the small circle of debris still perhaps\n&gt; surrounding the planet from the aborted Vok planetkiller..  Would the\n&gt; chnages they did here change his fate?  Would he still meet Rodimus andm be\n&gt; rescued?  Or had things already gone beyond that?\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTimes were changing, that was for sure. Whether they were changed\nbeyond fixing, it was difficult to know. If they had changed so far\nwould Wheelie still exist or would he simply pop and fall out of the\ntime stream discarded because his fate and movement along the time\nline changed? Would it be the same for any of them?\n\nThe giant shape of TUSCON with RODIMUS on his back had passed by\nseveral hours ago. So far the ones that were with WHEELIE, LEO PRIME,\nSANTON, WING CALIBER still seemed to be going on as he knew them -\ntime itself still seemed to be moveing inexorably foward without\nfaltering, just as solid as the Ark he was sitting upon.\n\nCould things have already changed? Could the things that WHEELIE\nbelived to be true, the things that seemed to be an indelible part of\nhis history be false - already having falling victim to the changes in\nthe time stream? Again hard to know.\n\nAbove WHEELIE bats took off on the nightly feeding from nearby caves,\nfloating on the hot breezes that blew off the sandy deserts that were\nstill far to their south. Hardy bushes and grasses swayed gentley to\nand fro, struggling to grow in ground that had been scorched by\nbattles large and small that had been fought in and around the Ark.\n\nWhat was it all for? Had they lost the battle already? Was this the\nbattle they were suppose to be fighting?\n\nWho can say.\n\nIn the distance a night owl snagged one of the bats and flew higher\ninto the  air, its tastey meal still struggling in its claws.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
