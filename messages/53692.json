This bot is Blue.  He quickly looks around and notices that\n&gt;some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bots standing around surveying the damage.  He quickly pulls out\n&gt;a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Plasma Pistol and aims it at the closest bot.  He slowly pulls\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trigger and a plasma Pistol is shot.  But it wasn&#39;t Blue&#39;s Plasma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pistol because Blue was the one that was shot.  Blue fell to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ground grasping his back where smoke was rising.  Smoke was also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rising from a plasma pistol.  It was Red&#39;s Pistol.  Red put his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pistol away and looked around\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;Stupid Epimetheus,&quot;  Red said as he turns to address the\n&gt;bots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; around them, &quot;I am Prometheus, who are you?&quot;\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Fotos: la forma m�s f�cil de compartir e imprimir fotos.  \nhttp://photos.msn.es/support/worldwide.aspx\n\n\n"}}
