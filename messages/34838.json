Several laser blasts streak past\n&gt; him, one hits his side armour, leaving a smoking groove. Mini\n&gt; rockets crash by him and into his top, shaking him and almost\n&gt; knocking out of flight. Astroblast swoops down towards Fireblade,\n&gt; and meets Switchblade there.\n&gt;\n&gt; Switchblade smiles, still cloaked. He throws the remains of\n&gt; Fireblade into the hatch, then hops in himself. He yells to\n&gt; Astroblast, &quot;Hey, &#39;Blast, we&#39;ve got another passenger waiting over\n&gt; the hill, make sure to get him when you leave.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Astroblast&#39;s rear thrusters launch again, as he curves around to\n&gt; pick up the last target, Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Menasor leaps forward, Prowl&#39;s missiles smashing into his virtually\n&gt; unmolested chest armour, causing him to hesitate a little.\n&gt; Incarcinator&#39;s charges land behind him, the explosions throwing up\n&gt; dirt and ashes around Menasor&#39;s feet. Menasor lunges at Prowl,\n&gt; trying to grab him in his large hands.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Rippersnapper ducks under the missiles. He stops right in front of\n&gt; Orion. He suddenly leaps forward, at Orion&#39;s chest, trying to claw\n&gt; him. (Alloran, is Orion as stupid as Rippersnapper? j/k Firing\n&gt; missiles that would damage both bots... something that\n&gt; Rippersnapper does. =)\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Lynxiz laughs at Grounded&#39;s words, &quot;I hope that I don&#39;t get gunned\n&gt; down.&quot; She shivers and turns to Nightlight, &quot;Nightlight, you were\n&gt; going to show me to my quarters for my stay?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
