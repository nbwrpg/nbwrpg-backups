The force of the blow knocks him backwards a step, and \nalmost sets him off balance, and denting his heavy barricade mode \narmour. He steps back again, and levels his freeze cannons at \nArty&#39;s shoulders in an attempt to stop the bot from moving his arms \nat the shoulder. He fires twice with each arm freeze cannon for the \njoints.\n\nCrossroads notices the strength advantage that the new bot \nfighting with them has, and yells to the bot, (the bum) &quot;Hey large \nnew bot, (he describes the bot, kinda like &quot;hey you over there with \nthe red shirt&quot; &#39;cept I don&#39;t know what the bot really looks like =P), \nCATCH!&quot; he transforms into plasma shield and sword mode, \nlaunching himself at the bum, hilt and handle ready to be grabbed. \n(Yan, if bum doesn&#39;t want Crossroads, he&#39;ll just transform again =)\n\n\nOn 30 May 2001, at 8:10, CYBERWOLF4 wrote:\n\n&gt; Air to ground, I was thinking Anti-Gravity. Anyways\n&gt; \n&gt; Arty allows Pacifix to get close enough to grab him. With a vicious\n&gt; jab with his open hand he lands a crashing blow to Pacifix&#39;s chest\n&gt; region. (I think grabbing range would be considered point blank the\n&gt; effects of the blow is entirely up to you.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Artemis was ready to fight and fired 25 times against Arty\n&gt; \n&gt; Arty suddenly fealt a series of shots striking him, his thick hide\n&gt; protected him from the light artillery making it feel like nothing\n&gt; more than a nuisance.(Since Pacifix is so close he&#39;d be in the line of\n&gt; fire too.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Slags flames heated up the battlefield again causing the tunnel to\n&gt; feel like a blast furnace. He tried to grab Pacifix and use him as a\n&gt; shield knowing that the Triceratops would have to stop his attack if\n&gt; one of his side was between them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Branding used her good barrel to launch a wave of flames toward Swoop\n&gt; detonating the missles. The room shook, if the battle continued the\n&gt; roof would surely colapse and bury them all.\n\n\n"}}
