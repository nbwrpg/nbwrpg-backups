If we harness enough energy, and \nwe catch him off guard, we could shove him back through the rift.  \nThen all we would have to do is seal the instablility.&quot;\n&gt; He was worked up, the plan would work... if a few things happened \nright.  One, securing a large enough energy supply for Malice, two, a \nway to get energy to Malice, and three, get energy from said bounty \nhunter to the repulser.\n&gt; &quot;Please! We have to try this!
