It was as if by \nshutting them she could shut out the world, or so she hoped. She \nwasn&#39;t afraid of the Alliance, or what they were capable of. They\nwere cowards. Tavatron sighed softly, the sound of her spark humming \nin her ears. The sound of her own spark had always relaxed her, now \nmore than ever. Tavarton turned her head so she could face Darkone, a \npure rage filling her when she laid eyes on one of her captors. She \nspoke in a tone filled with a degree of rage and hate, but she\nrefused to scream, not even in anger. She didn&#39;t want to appear \ndesperate in the face of the enemy:\n\n&quot;You are pathetic. The Alliance, all of you, are a joke.&quot;\n\nTavatron chuckled softly as she resumed her blank stare at the bare \nceiling:\n\n&quot;I am not afraid of you.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
