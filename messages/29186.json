Its been \n&gt; a while since he&#39;d seen such a wreckage, probably\n&gt; not since his ship \n&gt; had crashed on the moon. He cautiously approaches,\n&gt; looking around the \n&gt; wreck, and the one good shuttle, to see if there was\n&gt; anyone \n&gt; functional. His hand remained close to his gun.\n\nThe only things around were one crashed and shot up\nDecepticon shuttle, a second, fully functional\nDecepticon shuttle sitting by it and three\nDecepticons.\n\nOne lying dead, looking like it had been shot up...\n\nAnother also dead. Its head appeared to have been\nblown off...\n\nAnd another, also motionless but in Stasis Lock.\nHeavily damaged but repairable. \n\nSOMETHING had happened here.\n\n**Strafe**\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
