It belonged to a transformer named\nRiptide.  Originally a Maximal, Riptide was framed by a long time enemy\nbecause of jelousy of his enormous power.  The Cybertron Committee of\nJustice sentenced Riptide to be cast out of Cybertronian space\ntraveling in a stasis pod(much like Rampage).  While traveling in the\nspace/time continueum, his pod crashed on Prehistoric Earth.  When he\nawakened he had a new Pirahnna body and no memories of what happened on\nCybertron or what and where Cybertron is.  Not even knowing what\nfaction he belonged to, he fled to the waters where he tries to find\nout who/what/when/where he is and how he got here...\nOoc: By the way, he is a Maximal still.\nRiptide\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
