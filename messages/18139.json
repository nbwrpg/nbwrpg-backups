He growls, his jetpack powering down as he drops toward Blender, \nslashing his sword at the bot&#39;s back as he lands.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA shot hits Bloodystrike in the chest, sending him flying backwards before \nregaining stability.\n\nHe aims carefully at Shockaract, firing off two missiles. He frowns as he \nnotices a femm laying in stasis lock on the ground (Vamprah), gliding in and \nlanding near her.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica opens his eyes, going out of stasis lock. He was drenched with mech \nfluid, but he was still somewhat functional.\n\nA stray blast nearly hits him in the head, Reptilica realizing that he was in \na battle. He gets up, running for the shuttle in which he had brought the Vok.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer watches Najah eat a small mammal, smiling as the bot asks where the \nbattle is.\n\n&quot;Right this way, follow me!&quot; he says, taking off at a run toward the Alliance \nbase.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc shakes slightly as shots hit his armor, regaining stability as he \nclimbs up in the air after dropping a bomb.\n\n&quot;Agreed,&quot; he replies to Demolition, then switching his comm-link to transmit \nto all the Warmachines, &quot;Time show these bot that battle with us means death. \nWarmachines, UNITE!&quot;\n\nWith those words, Havoc transforms into a huge torso, waiting for the other \nWarmachines to transform into the other bodyparts.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHearing Havoc&#39;s command, Repressor transforms into a leg, hatching onto \nHavoc. He feels himself lose control as Havoc&#39;s mind takes over his circuits, \nwaiting for the others to combine.\n\n"}}
