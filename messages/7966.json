I agree. You saw the \ncapabilities of my ship during your battle when I tried to break up \nyour battle. I barely scratched this planet and didn&#39;t even come \nclose to my target. With such weapons do I honestly pose a threat to \nyou or your mighty warship? I am far to intelligent to attempt such a \nsuicidal attack when I&#39;m fighting for survival. I&#39;m setting a course, \nsend me accurate coordinates for your landing bay.\n\n&quot;Computer, mask all incoming transmissions from my babies.
