But Phobia made \n&gt; sence.  She didn&#39;t want anything to comprimise her situation. She \n&gt; nodded,&quot;I will do as you suggest reluctantly. But you are right. My \n&gt; love for him could be used against me and my position comprimised.  \n&gt; yes, I will give you command over Drillbit. But be aware that I \nwill \n&gt; override any command that will needlessly put his or anyone&#39;s lives \n&gt; in danger.  War and taking nessassary risks is one thing, but just \nto \n&gt; throw them into a metal cruncher is another.&quot; She looked at Phobia \n&gt; with a solom look. &quot;I want to fight this war and win with minimal \n&gt; losses.
