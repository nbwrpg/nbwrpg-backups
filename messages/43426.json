Well now, seeing as how the RPG seems incapcitated and \ndewboy \n&gt; is back in some shape or form, and also because people have been \nasking where \n&gt; I am. I think its time to return to the RPing in NBWRPG. However... \nfirst \n&gt; things first... Dewboy shut the hell up. You got banned for not \nfollowing \n&gt; rules, just having chars pop up any which way, doing things without \nasking \n&gt; the council, and above all else just plain being a complete idiot. \nNoone \n&gt; cares about mustex or stallex and what their supposeblys going to \ndo, and \n&gt; noone cares about Rhesus who doesn&#39;t exist since he never appeared \nand even \n&gt; the council said he didn&#39;t. Whee another thing now, my next post is \ngoing to \n&gt; be evil... very very very evil.... Airly if you don&#39;t like what is \ngoing to \n&gt; happen in it to blacknightmare, too bad. You got her into whats \ngoing to \n&gt; happen and you understood it when I told you OOC and went along with \nit. Oh \n&gt; and the next post is going to be so very evil... very very evil... \noh \n&gt; yeah.... since the infecticons and Vile Force havent been heard from \nin god \n&gt; knows when, I think I have some time to work with... yessss....\n\n\n"}}
