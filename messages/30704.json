The enraged bull \nfigured these\n&gt; were warning shots since nobody could be that bad a shot. He \nslammed on the\n&gt; breaks stopping immediately.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blaze finally caught up to where Drillbit was at, She had to warn \nthe other\n&gt; bot that Bullet stopping wasn&#39;t a good thing. &quot;You might want to \nstart\n&gt; running.&quot;She suggested,  &quot;Bullet isn&#39;t going to stop just because \nyou say\n&gt; so.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The bull turned around this time looking at Drillbit and Blaze, he \nlowered\n&gt; his head, stomped a few times, snorted and began another charge.
