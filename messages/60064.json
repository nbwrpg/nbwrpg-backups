Malice and Wolfblade are playin one hell \nof a drinking game that I am about to wrap up as soon as she gets \nback.  Then I&#39;ll head for the cannon, link up, and boost it.  \nMeanwhile, shadowess will probably launch our back up to keep Unicron \nfrom moving.  Not even he can defy a black hole right by a sub space \ninstability.  Then we can intro my second char Organics and Malice&#39;s \nhistory.  But more on that later.  I&#39;ll have to wait for Shadowss to \nget back then I&#39;ll jump on getting to the gun. \n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:IT?S ANYBODY HERE?????????\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo!
