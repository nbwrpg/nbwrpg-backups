Her logic had not completely returned to \nrealize \n&gt; just what had happened to her yet, but she knew that Prowl wasn&#39;t \nout to get \n&gt; her and was more concerned about her then himself.\n&gt; There was a large lump on her shoulder, where the synthetic bone \nnow stuck \n&gt; out.\n&gt; \n&gt; She stopped les then a meter away from Prowl and simply bowed her \nhead, a \n&gt; tired expression on her face. She was hurt, tired and confused.*\n\n\n"}}
