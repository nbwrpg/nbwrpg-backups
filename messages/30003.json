He was\n&gt; &gt;confused and made a mental note to ask Veratis what had happened. Somehow\n&gt; &gt;he\n&gt; &gt;knew that he still had his raptor mode but didn&#39;t want to waste the\n&gt; &gt;opportunity to learn about his new form.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;A little outside Maximal scanners the chat between Lunarpine and Megaton\n&gt; &gt;continued, Megaton sensed Lunarpines lothing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;You fear my size?&quot; The dragon spread his wings again, stretching them to\n&gt; &gt;the peak of thier width. &quot;Maybe I can make you feal more comfortable.&quot; He\n&gt; &gt;quickly transformed to his warped robot/ T-rex/ Dragon form shrinking\ndown.\n&gt; &gt;Even in this mode he was about 4 feet taller than Lunarpine and still\nfealt\n&gt; &gt;superior.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Lunarpine stood up straight as he could trying pathetically to look\nbigger\n&gt; &gt;than he was. &quot;I&#39;ve beaten bigger bots than you.&quot;The wolfbot boasted\n&gt; &gt;attempting to impress the other bot.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Megaton raised his T-rex legs to full extension making him 18- 19 feet.\n&gt; &gt;This\n&gt; &gt;severely limited his mobility and coordination but the cocky mutant was\n&gt; &gt;sure\n&gt; &gt;he could recover fast enough to destroy the smaller bot before any\nserious\n&gt; &gt;damage was done.\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
