The lights flicker once, \nthen \n&gt; become a dull glow. She sighed, this was going to be fun. She sat \nbeside the \n&gt; main console and tried a few keys. Everything sparked, including \nthe keys \n&gt; she touched:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You said it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She turned to Firearm as she spoke, shaking her hand as a little \nsmoke rose \n&gt; from it. That was the second time this ship had shocked her. She \ngroaned and \n&gt; went to sit beside one of the active consoles. A sketchy image of \nthe CF&#39;s \n&gt; current status appeared before her. This was going to take forever. \nThe \n&gt; voice that boomed over her comm, however, snapped her out of \nwhatever state \n&gt; she just happened to be in. Optimus was back? The Neo Beast Wars \nhad just \n&gt; gotten a little more interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; *****\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron:\n&gt; \n&gt; The voice that had been speaking to her grew silent, only to be \nreplaced by \n&gt; another. Optimus was alive? Tavatron stopped walking and gazed \nacross the \n&gt; open plain. This was something she hadn&#39;t expected. Perhaps that \nwas the \n&gt; disturbance she had sensed:\n&gt; \n&gt; *Guess again wolf.*\n&gt; \n&gt; The voice was back, and seemed to have no intention of giving her \nany peace. \n&gt; A hundred melancholy and then destructive emotions stormed her \nsenses. If \n&gt; she could, she would have ripped her own spark from her chest just \nto shut \n&gt; it up:\n&gt; \n&gt; *Come now, that&#39;s no way to greet an old friend.*\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron growled beneath her breath, Dinobot&#39;s current predicament \ncatching \n&gt; her attention a few yards away. She smiled to herself, of all \nthe &#39;bots the \n&gt; creature had chose to land on... she couldn&#39;t help but chuckle \nsoftly. It \n&gt; was a rather amusing site:\n&gt; \n&gt; *Ah, so THAT&#39;s him. Not much of a warrior if you ask me.*\n&gt; \n&gt; What little remained of Tavatron&#39;s patience vanished two seconds \nafter the \n&gt; voice had begun speaking about Dinobot. How could *she* know about \nhim?! It \n&gt; was impossible, even if *she* had been laying dormant all these \nyears--\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I said shut-up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; To any &#39;bot within hearing distance she may have started sounding a \nlittle \n&gt; crazy, but Tavatron didn&#39;t care about that right now. The voice in \nher head, \n&gt; given enough time, would drive her crazy if she didn&#39;t shut it up \nsoon. \n&gt; Tavatron walked toward Dinobot, ignoring the voice as it rambled on \nabout \n&gt; some long forgotten military protocols. Dinobot wasn&#39;t coming \ninside, well, \n&gt; her injuries could wait. She wanted to see where he was going:\n&gt; \n&gt; [To DB] &quot;Calm down, or it will just hold on tighter.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *Ha, you&#39;ve always had the worst taste in friends.*\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron ignored the voice as she tried to remove the small furry \ncreature \n&gt; from Dinobot&#39;s head.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
