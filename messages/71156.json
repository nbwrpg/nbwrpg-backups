You can&#39;t save everyone all the time, T=\r\nucson, it&#39;s impossible. But look at all the good you&#39;ve already achieved.  =\r\nPerceptor is here with us now, and having a better life thanks to you and R=\r\nodimus, Nightlight, and Windlord are back with us again, thanks to your eff=\r\norts.

You went out there and you showed Hydras a thi=\r\nng or two when you strategically got our comrades out of his clutches.  Wit=\r\nhout your strategies we wouldn&#39;t have everyone back with us.&quot;\n\nStraight Sho=\r\nt nodds.\n\n&quot;Yeah, ya might not have defeated hydras in a one on one, but you=\r\n did show him a thing or two when you stepped up to the plate, and coordina=\r\nted the rescue efforts.  I don&#39;t think they saw that one comming.&quot;\n\nTucson&#39;=\r\ns grin grows.\n\n&quot; Hmm, then I - suppose as soon as I&#39;m well enough, we - sho=\r\nuld try and think ahead and - hopefully plan our precautionary measures aga=\r\ninst - future attacks.&quot;\n\nThat made Straight Shot smile.

C&#39;mon Tucson, Rodimus and =\r\nLegacy are right, you need ta\n&gt; take care of yourself! I know what happened=\r\n in the past was hard for you ta\n&gt; take, but that wasn&#39;t your fault!  You g=\r\not struck from behind by Cyclonus,\n&gt; and there was no way of predicting tha=\r\nt!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson sighs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I - could have prevented it though.  And I - c=\r\nan&#39;t - let it happen again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot could see that Tucson did n=\r\need help urgently.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Legacy, please get Tucson ta the CR Chambers ASAP.=\r\n  And make sure he\n&gt; actually takes your advice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson couldn&#39;t say =\r\nanything else.  He knew his little sister was right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot loo=\r\nks to Rodimus now knowing why Tucson was acting as he was.\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t out =\r\nof revenge, it was out of compassion, and guilt.  But a guilt\n&gt; he did not =\r\ndeserve to carry.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; He feels really bad about what happened..  He thin=\r\nks that your\n&gt; disappearence and abduction was his fault.  In all truths it=\r\n was no one&#39;s\n&gt; fault but Hydras&#39;s.  Before he became a Prime, he really to=\r\nok his job\n&gt; seriously and still does but back then, for an Autobot, he was=\r\n all\n&gt; dedication and didn&#39;t care what kind of consequences he&#39;d face while=\r\n going\n&gt; above and beyond the call of duty.  All he cares about is his comr=\r\nades, and\n&gt; even back then, his loyalty was soley for you and the others.  =\r\nHe was always\n&gt; so proud to be working with you, and would do anything to u=\r\nphold the level\n&gt; of heroism that&#39;s always expected of Autobot and Maximal =\r\nkind.  Then, that\n&gt; day, the time you were taken from us..  That was the da=\r\ny he was trying to\n&gt; divert enemy attentions away from you by doing what wa=\r\ns highly\n&gt; uncharacteristic of himself.  Decoy work was always deemed for t=\r\nhose who\n&gt; were natural built speedsters, but he&#39;s no speedster.  When he c=\r\nhose his\n&gt; form, he chose the working class vehicle, which is known more fo=\r\nr strength\n&gt; and durability than speed. But out of desperation to try and s=\r\nave you, he\n&gt; did what he normally didn&#39;t do, and then, that&#39;s when he got =\r\nshot by\n&gt; Cyclonus. It took him off line instantly.  He doesn&#39;t remember an=\r\nything\n&gt; after that.  I was taken off line at the same time, but, I did sta=\r\ny\n&gt; conscious enough to see the blast. Shortly after he went off line, I di=\r\nd.\n&gt; But strange, I remember more than he does.  And that&#39;s why he&#39;s acting=\r\n as he\n&gt; is.
