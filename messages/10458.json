We could really use some help from fellow maximals if any wants to.\nnbwrpg@egroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hell BEast no longer participates in the Neo Beast Wars RPG. If your going to \n&gt; attack the Predacon base, I suggest you turn around and go home because im \n&gt; tired and Im not going to take any crap from the likes of you. Sorry it has \n&gt; to be this way, but, I didnt have a good day.\n&gt; -JP\n&gt; \n\n----------\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://home.netscape.com/webmail/\n\n"}}
