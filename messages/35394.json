Well, Sky Lynx got smashed by Abominus.\n&gt; Sideswipe: Yeah. I miss him already.\n&gt; Orion: He may have been arrogant, but he was a good warrior. hey, wait a \n&gt; minute, where are Torca and Klant?\n&gt; Ratchet: I overheard them talking about leaving.  I guess they did. Hope they \n&gt; end up okay.\n&gt; Sideswipe: I got a question for you Firearm.  When the war is over, how are \n&gt; going to fix things? I mean, in our time here, we&#39;ve screwed up so much.  \n&gt; Just me and Ratchet being here is a paradox, and there are other former \n&gt; Autobots and Decepticons here too. Then there&#39;s the Ark. Liono Prime had \n&gt; better know what he is doing.\n\n\n"}}
