Her \n&gt; skin was silver and black. Her face was oval and delicate.Her lips \n&gt; thin and her nose was thin too. In the middle of her fore head was a \n&gt; blue jewel. Her eyes were closed and it seemed that she was trying \nto \n&gt; woke up. She was using a feline-like helmet and her face was more \n&gt; human than feline.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her body was like BW&#39;s Silverbolt but more delicate.\n\n\n"}}
