He nods gently to the Protohuman and accepts his offering=\r\n with a gentile touch of his nose on the man&#39;s shoulder. He allows him to s=\r\ntroke his snout as some sort of good luck ritual. The man bows in graciousn=\r\ness to Tucson&#39;s gesture of kindness and leaves him be with Talon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m not so sure what all of that meant bu=\r\nt, whatever it was, it was a very kind gesture on his part.

Yes, they have seen him before. To them he is a guardian, and the m=\r\nore offerings they gave him, he would return their kind gestures by offerin=\r\ng his protection. But there is more to these paintings.. A strange mysterio=\r\nus figure, with an aura around it.. To me it seems evil. Another idol, some=\r\none else to worship. .. People portrayed in black and white.. White, meanin=\r\ng those who look to the Silver Dragon and black to those who worship the in=\r\ntimidating idol.. I&#39;ve seen ancient pictographs before on Cybertron, and th=\r\nese are different but in the same format. Talon if the dragon is a physical=\r\n being, then this dark idol must be as well.

It was clear that the Silver Dragon was a source of comfort to th=\r\nese creatures, but that was about to change once he and Talon left for Cybe=\r\nrtron. It was a massive guilt slammed upon his heart. Yet how could he get =\r\nthe animals to understand that he had to leave them in such a short time? H=\r\ne was now their guardian and they were looking up to him for protection. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Talon, these creatures re=\r\nmember the old dragon that sought to their protection and realize that I ha=\r\nve taken his place.

He watches attentively and at tha=\r\nt moment, the creature lifts its head. It was another dragon. Yet this one =\r\nwas a bit smaller than he was, but the same coloration. He takes note of it=\r\ns slender shape. It was female. She looks to him as he looks to her. She sl=\r\nowly approaches him and they look gently to each other like brother and sis=\r\nter.

Talon, s=\r\no will I. But that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t try to recreate a little portion o=\r\nf life on our own planet. This seed we were given, it needs soil, water, li=\r\nght and something to plant it in. Perhaps we can find a place where there i=\r\ns an abundance of soil and take that with us. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Just as he spoke, a Protohuman, carrying an offering of fish, kneels=\r\n down before Tucson and Talon. Tucson looks to the offering. It was a most =\r\ngenerous portion of fish. Yet now he could not eat it, but he knew Talon wo=\r\nuld need nourishment. He nods gently to the Protohuman and accepts his offe=\r\nring with a gentile touch of his nose on the man&#39;s shoulder. He allows him =\r\nto stroke his snout as some sort of good luck ritual. The man bows in graci=\r\nousness to Tucson&#39;s gesture of kindness and leaves him be with Talon.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m not so sure what all of that meant but, =\r\nwhatever it was, it was a very kind gesture on his part. I wonder if these =\r\npeople had any interaction with the old Silver Dragon.. &quot; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It isn&#39;t long before others come to offer more gifts to h=\r\nim and Talon. One of the Protohumans points to a painting on a rock, with w=\r\nhite portraying silver, in a primitive image of a large reptile with outstr=\r\netched wings.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Oh, I see now.. Yes, they=\r\n have seen him before. To them he is a guardian, and the more offerings the=\r\ny gave him, he would return their kind gestures by offering his protection.=\r\n But there is more to these paintings.. A strange mysterious figure, with a=\r\nn aura around it.. To me it seems evil. Another idol, someone else to worsh=\r\nip. .. People portrayed in black and white.. White, meaning those who look =\r\nto the Silver Dragon and black to those who worship the intimidating idol..=\r\n I&#39;ve seen ancient pictographs before on Cybertron, and these are different=\r\n but in the same format. Talon if the dragon is a physical being, then this=\r\n dark idol must be as well.

He watches attentively and at that moment, the creature lifts its head=\r\n. It was another dragon. Yet this one was a bit smaller than he was, but th=\r\ne same coloration. He takes note of its slender shape. It was female. She l=\r\nooks to him as he looks to her. She slowly approaches him and they look gen=\r\ntly to each other like brother and sister. In draconic vocalization, Tucson=\r\n explains who he is and his dilemma. She intern rumbles back and bows her h=\r\nead. She nods as he does.
