Telling him dangle in \nmid-air for a second before putting him in her arms and stroking him for a \nmoment. She was going to hold onto him until everything was cleared up, just \nto keep him safe.\nShe heard FZ announce that they were leaving and the stress in her shoulders \nrelaxed and she gave a little sigh of relief.\nNow they would have time to recover and repair...and repair a lot! The CF \nwas a wreck, and so were most of the Maximals.\nIron Raptor looked at Shadow Cat as she spoke, cocking an eye brow.*\n\n&quot; What?&quot;\n\n* With her thoughts on the battle and Alliance she had hardly heard Shadow \nCat.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
