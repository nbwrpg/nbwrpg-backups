She felt her spark jump \naround. She was overjoyed to see him. She was his wounds and looked \nat his face. She wanted to help him, but Veratis was right, he needed \nthe CR.  She looked at him, she waited for him to either tell her he \nmissed her and didn&#39;t care about her new form, or to spit at her and \ntell her to leave him alone.  She knew she sould read his thoughts, \nbut chose not to.  She was more afraid of what he was thinking than \nanything. Her spark dropped as he looked at her, then walked into the \nCR.  She lowered her head and sighed. &quot;Yeah...see you when you get \nout of there.&quot; her voice soft and meloncolly. She looked at the blood \non the floor and sighed.  Her shoudlers were sore, and not healing \nfast enough. She walked to a corner of the room and layed down. She \nrested her head on her front bear paws.  She closed her eyes and \nsoftly cried. She knew that he now hated her and her new form.  She \nwasn&#39;t the Shadow Wing he had left behind. She was now Ice.  She \nhadn&#39;t read his mind because she was to afraid to hear his thoughts \non what he thought about her new form.  She though about how he acted \nwhen he got back. He didn&#39;t rush up to her. He didn&#39;t even really \nlook at her.  He just shrugged it off.  She sighed and knew that \nmaybe, he had found another bot in his travels.  Or he got tried of \nher. She couldn&#39;t blame him. But her spark felt like it was breaking \nnone the less.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis walked behind Shadow Wing and bandaged the wounds on her \nshoulders,\n&gt; he was worried that her repair systems still hadn&#39;t taken care of \nthe\n&gt; damage. Normally the wounds would have been healed soon as they \nopened. &quot;You\n&gt; are correct child, I will need a name to call you. Subject just \nseems to\n&gt; improper when it involves a living um being.&quot; the word creature \ncame to mind\n&gt; but sounded almost insulting. &quot;I will call you &quot;Ice&quot; for now until \na more\n&gt; suitable name comes up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The computer beeped signifying the door opening under a recognizable\n&gt; signature. Veratis thought nothing of it. Lady Hawk, and Foxfingers \nshould\n&gt; be returning any time now. He hadn&#39;t heard from either one in a \nwhile and\n&gt; was beginning to worry. He put his mind at ease by deciding that \nthey must\n&gt; be caught up in all the excitement of this amazing new world.\n&gt; \n&gt; A large figure entered the room and stayed to the Shadows. &quot;I leave \nfor a\n&gt; few days and this is what happens? Do I have to watch you every \nmoment? Good\n&gt; to see you&#39;re up and about Wing.&quot; Lunarpine stepped forward in half \nwolf\n&gt; form carrying the sample of DNA from Shadow Wings grave sight. &quot;I \nguess you\n&gt; won&#39;t need this after all.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Veratis half smiled. The rejection to the bear DNA was causing the\n&gt; degeneration, now that they had the right sample he might be able to\n&gt; stabilize her. &quot;I hate to say it but you&#39;ll need to spend a few \nmore hours\n&gt; in the CR.&quot; he turns back to Lunarpine, &quot;And you, I give you a \nsimple task\n&gt; and a new body and you turn it into a war. I&#39;ll see you both in a \nwhile.&quot;\n&gt; He adjusted the intake valve on the chamber with the owl DNA \nknowing he\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have to explain to &quot;Ice&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine stepped into another chamber looking one last time at \nShadow Wings\n&gt; new form. He wanted to throw his arms around her but figured it&#39;d \nhurt to\n&gt; much. A bear hug and his wounds would make him regret \nsurviving. &quot;I&#39;ll see\n&gt; you soon&quot; he said to both Veratis and Wing as the door closed.\n\n\n\n"}}
