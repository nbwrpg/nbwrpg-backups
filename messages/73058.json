He takes a deep breath.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; One of you is real but one of you isn&#39;t .  The real Rodimus was given a\n&gt; gift by the old Silver Dragon who lived in the cave above the Ark.  Could\n&gt; you now show me that gift?  That is the real Rodimus Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; He could barely move but he was determined to put the matter to rest.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;No!&quot; DARK RODIMUS said as he looked at the burnt form of TUSCON and\nthen back at the newly revealed RODIMUS PRIME, &quot;I am the Real RODIMUS\nPRIME!&quot;\n\nDARK RODIMUS opened his chest plate and inside was a glowing object,\ngleaming with black light and purple highlights.

She felt like a\n&gt; fool.\n\nDARK RODIMUS looked at NIGHTLIGHT, fear, anger, loss and betrayal\nwarring across his face plate. &quot;Nightlight!&quot; He said to her, &quot;Tell\nthis . . . this imposter that *I* am the *REAL* RODIMUS!&quot;\n\nRODIMUS PRIME looked at NIGHTLIGHT and then at DARK RODIMUS, &quot;You have\nhurt her!&quot; He said. &quot;You will pay!&quot;\n\nBoth RORDIMUS&#39; began to run at each other, the doors of thier chests\nclosing as they they prepare for battle!\n\nMeanwhile the female figure that was with RODIMUS vanished from sight\nand appeared next to TUSCON she was dark with blue and orange\nhighlights. &quot;You are wounded.&quot; She said. &quot;We need to get you out of\nhere.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile all around them a battle was raging!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
