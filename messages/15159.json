The red and brown \nbot reaches into a pack he carries with him and pulls out a \nminicomputer. Foxfingers taps in the information he sees and a \npicture of a ship very similar appears on the screen.\n\nPictures flickered across the screen, basic information on the \nwarship in front of him was now at his disposal. The computer \nreported the ship as one of the many cruisers designed for \nexploration then turned into a warship when the Predacons came to \npower.\n\nHe opens a commlink with the ship &quot;Um Hello my names Foxfingers I&#39;m a \nmaximal like you,&quot; he pointed to the emblem on his chest, even \nscarred as it was it was still visable. &quot;Could someone give me some \ninformation on where we are and why theres so much activity on this \nplanet?&quot; His leader didn&#39;t have that information yet if FoxFingers \nwas successful he soon would.\n\n\n"}}
