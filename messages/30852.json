She flew high into the sky, soaring upon the warm breeze.  She \nwas quickly insane.  She had hoped for more than just watching the \ndust settle on the armory shelves.  She decided to see what else was \nout there.  She went over the mountains and headed across the \nocean. &quot;Who knows, with my dumb luck, I&#39;ll get caught in a hurricane \nand lost at sea.  Well, if I can get that lucky.&quot;\nShe stretched her wings out fully and passed over the lazy waves of \nthe sea.  After for what seemed like hours, she thought she saw \nsomething on the horizen.  An island perhaps.  She headed for it and \nroad the wind currents towards the island.  \n\n\n"}}
