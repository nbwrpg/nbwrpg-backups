As they near=\r\n him, he rears up, extends his enormous wings and beats them with powerful =\r\nthrusts, hoping to create enough wind resistance to keep them at bay.  His =\r\ntail whips around in powerful coils as he prepares to catch one of them wit=\r\nh a constrictor grip, in an attempt to slow them down.   He sees something =\r\nvery familiar about them, yet having had a portion of his memory erased whe=\r\nn Cyclonus struck him vorns ago, he could not really be sure he was seeing =\r\nwho he thought he was seeing.  His expression changes, as anger is replaced=\r\n by confusion and anticipation.  \n\n&quot; Grimlock?  Wait!  Is your name Grimloc=\r\nk?&quot;   \n\nTucson shows the leader his Maximal faction symbol, and a small Aut=\r\nobot symbol located on his left front haunch.\n\n&quot; I am Tucson Prime, formall=\r\ny Tucson!  You might have known me in my Autobot alt form!  But I assure yo=\r\nu that I&#39;m not lying!   I once worked for Optimus Prime!  &quot;\n\nHe hoped that =\r\nGrimlock would sort of remember who he was.  He then takes a submissive sta=\r\nnce, showing that he means no harm.\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly=\r\n busy. \n\nOn Sep 1, 2011, at 12:30 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@gmail.c=\r\nom&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tucson takes a brave stance as the four large s=\r\nhapes come near him.  There\n&gt;&gt; would be no scaring him off as he stomps a f=\r\noot down hard with a loud growl\n&gt;&gt; and a snarl on his muzzle.  He meant bus=\r\niness.  He was going to protect the\n&gt;&gt; jungle come what may.   Yet there we=\r\nre a few curious animals who did seem\n&gt;&gt; comfortable having him there.  One=\r\n of them being a falcon, and a cougar.\n&gt;&gt; They clear the area to give Tucso=\r\nn room to assert his dominance among the\n&gt;&gt; jungle creatures.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Don&#39;=\r\nt worry, I will protect you and your jungle.  No hand will lay harm\n&gt;&gt; here=\r\n, I assure you.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He gives a loud warning roar to the approaching fig=\r\nures.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; A loud answering roar could be heard in the distance =\r\nas the shapes\n&gt; speed up their approach!\n&gt; \n&gt; The other animals that were w=\r\nith TUSCON quickly scatter, all too ready\n&gt; to leave him alone with whateve=\r\nr was coming to face him. The clearing\n&gt; TUSCON is standing in is approxima=\r\ntely 30=E2=80=99 wide with little or no tree\n&gt; cover and whatever birds tha=\r\nt have been in the tree tops flap their\n&gt; wings and take to the skies in an=\r\n outpouring of fear. The trees\n&gt; themselves rustle as animals of all sorts =\r\nvacate! As they do so the\n&gt; sound of the approaching shapes got steadily lo=\r\nuder. Trees crack,\n&gt; brush is uprooted, and the heavy thud of feet moving s=\r\nwiftly through\n&gt; the jungle could be clearly heard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Out of the trees f=\r\nour shapes come lumbering through into the clearing\n&gt; with TUSCON, another =\r\nloud roar accompanying their arrival!\n&gt; \n&gt; The first to be seen is a large =\r\nTyrannosaurus Rex, standing at 10 and\n&gt; massively built he is as fully as l=\r\narge and massive as TUSCON himself,\n&gt; it takes only a moment to recognize h=\r\nim. His colors are different,\n&gt; instead of the silver and grey paint job of=\r\n former times he is black,\n&gt; gold and chrome. Other then that he looks exac=\r\ntly like a transmetal\n&gt; version of GRIMLOCK!\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind him came a Tricera=\r\ntops, an Apatosaurus and a Stegosaurus all in\n&gt; the same sort of black, gol=\r\nd and chrome transmetal motif lumber\n&gt; forward, their heavy weight smashing=\r\n through anything in their path:\n&gt; SLAG, SLUDGE and SNARL all of them as la=\r\nrge as GRIMLOCK!\n&gt; \n&gt; With no words save a savage growl GRIMLOCK ran at TUS=\r\nCON his jaws open\n&gt; wide, black teeth ready to rip and shred as the other t=\r\nhree transmetal\n&gt; dinosaurs spread out hoping to get a bite as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; (=\r\nTAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo! =\r\nGroups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
