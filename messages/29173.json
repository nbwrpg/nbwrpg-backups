Its been \na while since he&#39;d seen such a wreckage, probably not since his ship \nhad crashed on the moon. He cautiously approaches, looking around the \nwreck, and the one good shuttle, to see if there was anyone \nfunctional. His hand remained close to his gun.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Fliq::\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq drags Battera and Dachande into the Cybertronian Fire, putting \n&gt; them in CR chambers and then walking back out. He stretches, feeling \n&gt; his back joints crack back into place. He sees a small flying object \n&gt; out of the corner of his eyes and turns his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq&#39;s eyes widened as he saw what looked like a comet. Briefly he \n&gt; wondered if any of his old crew had made it from the moon, but that \n&gt; thought was immediately nulled. He had been back at the moon, and \nhad \n&gt; found nothing but remains. But still...\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq transforms into fox mode and takes off at a run, heading for \n&gt; where the &#39;comet&#39; would land.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kevin Ramsey &lt;kramsey20@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; He thought he&#39;d evaded them, then as he passed Mars,\n&gt; &gt; the Decepticon shuttle came out from behind Phobos.\n&gt; &gt; Inside, Scud and Razor fired gleefully at the fleeing\n&gt; &gt; shuttle. The shuttle itself was being fired on...and\n&gt; &gt; boy was it taking damage. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The odd thing was...it also had the Decepticon emblem.\n&gt; &gt; Then a large explosion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Stabilizers were hit....and it was going down. The\n&gt; &gt; pilot of the fleeing Decepticon shuttle guided it into\n&gt; &gt; the atmosphere, hoping to at least survive a crash\n&gt; &gt; landing long enough to make a last stand.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was beginning to burn up in the atmosphere, headed\n&gt; &gt; for land...Central Africa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The plummet took forever. To the naked eye, the\n&gt; &gt; crashing shuttle appeared as a comet, falling to Earth\n&gt; &gt; in a burning fireball...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; until it crashed hard in Central Africa. It skidded\n&gt; &gt; nearly a mile before crashing to a stop. It was a\n&gt; &gt; miracle that the craft was still relatively in one\n&gt; &gt; piece...albiet shredded to ribbons.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Two minutes later, the other Decepticon shuttle\n&gt; &gt; landed. Out came Scud (black) and Razor (dark red),\n&gt; &gt; two Jet-class Decepticons disembarked, ready to finish\n&gt; &gt; the job.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They blasted open the cockpit, to find no one there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh Strafe...STRA-AFE! Come out come out wherever you\n&gt; &gt; are!&quot; Scud shouted in an echoing, insane voice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Razor was looking around, scanning the immediate area.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Razor laughed, &quot;Come on, you traitor. Come out so we\n&gt; &gt; can take your head back to Cybertron!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nothing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then a sound from the sky...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What appeared to be a dark blue F-22 Raptor did a full\n&gt; &gt; Stuka dive bombing run, blasting away with twin laser\n&gt; &gt; blasters mounted under the wings. The strafing run\n&gt; &gt; took Razor from behind. Scud never had a chance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ...and fell, blasted like crazy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Razor, however was able to dodge the strafing run. As\n&gt; &gt; the jet passed by, it transformed into a robot and\n&gt; &gt; landed, the twin blasters forming a double-barreled\n&gt; &gt; laser cannon. He was sleek, streamlined \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (here&#39;s a pic of an F-22 Raptor. Would house a VERY\n&gt; &gt; cool-looking transformer.

He fired a continuous barrage into\n&gt; &gt; the exposed and damaged reactor of the Decepticon\n&gt; &gt; shuttle...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ka-boom!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nothing but blinding light and smoke.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Razor laughed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Dodge that, traitor.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The smoke took awhile to clear, and Razor turned\n&gt; &gt; towards his shuttle...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ...To look down a double barrelled blaster\n&gt; &gt; cannon....belonging to the Decepticon named Strafe, of\n&gt; &gt; course.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Dodge this.&quot; Strafe said, the voice reverbing like a\n&gt; &gt; younger version of Megatron&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BLAM!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Razor&#39;s head had been literally blown off. The\n&gt; &gt; decapitated Razor fell lifeless to the ground. The\n&gt; &gt; other Decepticon who had killed him, Strafe, activated\n&gt; &gt; an internal distress beacon, collapsing to the ground\n&gt; &gt; in Stasis Lock, using his last ounce of strength.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Someone would find him, and whether it be Autobot or\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon, he&#39;d either be saved or executed...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course, when whoever found him saw the logos on his\n&gt; &gt; shoulders, he would probably be killed on the spot,\n&gt; &gt; lest his rescuer be a trigger-happy Autobot or Maximal\n&gt; &gt; wanting to bag himself a Decepticon. His last thought\n&gt; &gt; before going into stasis lock?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Decepticons wanted him dead, the Autobots hated\n&gt; &gt; him...he was screwed either way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (tag like, umm...anyone I guess. Strafe&#39;s open to\n&gt; &gt; find.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
