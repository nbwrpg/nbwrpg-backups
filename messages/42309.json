If Ice hadn&#39;t stepped\nbetween them the blast would have hit him. He reached to draw his\nweapon when Ice rose her wings blocking his shot. &quot;Get down!,&quot; he\nyelled trying to take aim at the insane bot.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;None of that in here.&quot; Ice yelled equally demanding, &quot;This is a\nplace of peace and it&#39;ll stay that way.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Grizzltron wasn&#39;t very happy that thier chat was inturupted. He\nfealt outnumbered and outgunned. His firepower was the only thing\nseperating him and the odds. Veratis wrapped his large bat wings\naround the bear bot and used his unseemingly strength to hold\nGrizzltrons arms at his sides. &quot;I already warned you once that that\nwill not be permitted in my home.&quot; The old scientist bit down on the\nother bots shoulder draining enough energy to weaken him enough to\nforce him into a CR chamber.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That should give him some time to cool down.&quot; Veratis says\ntransforming back to his robot mode. &quot;Now then Mustex was it? Take\nIce with you and bring your &quot;son&quot; to me and I&#39;ll take good care of\nhim.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ice didn&#39;t want to go that way, she wanted to return to Lunarpine\nand the others. She thought about thier times together and had to go\nwith Mustex, She remembered all the times she&#39;d tried to help her\nlove and ended up getting herself hurt and in one case nearly lost\nher spark. This time she&#39;d trust him to get the job done without\nworrying about her.\n\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
