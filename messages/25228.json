I just want to go on record saying I\ndo\n&gt; not think that of anyone, especially Yan, Ks, Jp, etc. They&#39;re the\nbackbone\n&gt; of NBW, without them there wouldn&#39;t even be a NBW RPG.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Hysteria/Tavatron\n&gt;\n&gt; Hysteria:\n&gt;\n&gt; There, now all she needed to do was enter the final code and the shields\n&gt; would reactivate and whatever outer weapons remained would power up. Well,\n&gt; either that or the engine core would explode. She opened a comm to IR:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Uh, commander I suppose, should I attempt to repower the shields or allow\n&gt; the two aproaching Alliance &#39;bots to enter the bridge?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The scanners had picked up two new &#39;bots flying straight for the CF&#39;s\n&gt; exposed bridge. She had to do something, but if she was ordered to do\n&gt; nothing... well, all she could do was hope it wouldn&#39;t come to that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron:\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron&#39;s scanners registered Dinobot nearby, only a few meters away in\n&gt; fact, but she did nothing to acknowledge his presence other than continue\n&gt; backing up toward Iron Raptor. Now was not the time for plesantries.\n&gt; Something was obviously amiss here. The Alliance did not give up so\nreadily,\n&gt; of that she was sure. She stood her ground beside Iron Raptor, her staff\n&gt; still held beside her. She turned to face FZ and despretely tried to fight\n&gt; the urge to rip him apart. (Nuthin&#39; personal, just some anti-FZ feelings\nfor\n&gt; ya^_^)\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
