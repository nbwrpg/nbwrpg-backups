The other Predacons looked ready to fight as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile the other soldiers that had come with Tankor were silent and\n&gt; motionless, looking little more than drone waiting for his command.\n&gt; Yet their large weapon mounts were mute testimony as to what would\n&gt; happen should Hydras refuse to comply or his soldiers choose to fight.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tankor&#39;s ignored Inferno as he watched Hydras, although one of the\n&gt; other tanks reoriented its weapon to cover Inferno.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
