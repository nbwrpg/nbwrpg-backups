(Who&#39;s at\nthe meeting so far?) he entered followed by Ice and Razor Claw. Ice\ntransformed to her robot mode, a bots head on a furry body with claws and\nPolar bear legs. she couldn&#39;t fully transform, this was as close as she\ncould come. &quot;I never imagined there were so many of us&quot;She thought as they\nentered\n\nRazor Claw transformed to bot mode and looked around. it was hard for him to\nfathom that one day he might be linked to one of these bots. If Veratis&#39;\ndreams came true there wouldn&#39;t be any factions, there would be only one.(No\nhighlander reference intended.) He glanced around the room, all the bots\nlooked more like targets than allies to him.\n\n&quot;Razor Claw calm down, we&#39;re not here to fight, we&#39;re here because they need\nus, and we need them.&quot; she telepathically tried to calm him but his emotions\nwere filled with fear and hatred for every bot in the room. A veritable fuse\nwaiting to reach the firecracker, all he needed was an excuse to get set\noff.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;cyberwolf4@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, December 04, 2000 1:17 PM\nSubject: to the meeting\n\n\n&gt; Sorry, forgot to switch topics--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot;\n&gt; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ice, Lunarpine, and Razor Claw aproached the Cybertronian Fire,\n&gt; Lunarpine\n&gt; &gt; used his form for the scanners to react to. since it worked at the\n&gt; ark he\n&gt; &gt; figured it might work here. Ice and Razor Claw remained in beast\n&gt; mode both\n&gt; &gt; hoping no trouble arose.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The door slid open recognizing his Maximal signature. Ice opened\n&gt; her mind to\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine &quot;Be careful my love, I don&#39;t want anything to happen to\n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt; beautiful pelt.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ll take that as an order&quot; Replied Lunarpine mentally back to Ice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ice looked around, &quot;Any idea where the conference rooms are?&quot; she\n&gt; asked out\n&gt; &gt; loud, hoping open communication wouldn&#39;t arouse any suspicion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sorry Ice, I&#39;ve only been here once.&quot; Lunarpine sniffed the\n&gt; air, &quot;I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; getting a bunch of scents this way, if we follow them it should\n&gt; lead us to\n&gt; &gt; the meeting.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Then let&#39;s go, we haven&#39;t flown all this way to stand here\n&gt; talking.&quot; Ice\n&gt; &gt; could sound more confident now that she was on friendly ground. She\n&gt; &gt; remembered this place from when it had first crashed, the only time\n&gt; she&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; ever visited. She smelled the air, she too could sense the crowd of\n&gt; bots.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Razor Claw stood almost bolt upright as his eyes swept the ship, he\n&gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; like being here. even though he was no longer Predacon he still\n&gt; fealt as if\n&gt; &gt; he were in enemy territory. &quot;Settle down, you&#39;re with friends.&quot; Ice\n&gt; told him\n&gt; &gt; mentally hoping to settle his nerves. she&#39;d known since they\n&gt; entered Maximal\n&gt; &gt; airspace that he was nervous about the mission. He acted ready to\n&gt; snap, she\n&gt; &gt; hoped that he&#39;d be able to hold his temper until they were far away.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
