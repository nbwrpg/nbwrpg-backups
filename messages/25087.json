I&#39;m glad your feeling better Yan^_^ \nOh, and Ks, just to make sure you know, the bridge is still under lockdown. \nAbsolutely no computers or access panels are visible or accessible[sp]. \nSorry this is so long, but it&#39;s either type this or do homework...)\n\nHysteria/Tavatron\n\nTavatron sent a sickle shaped wave of energy at Manterror. Iron Raptor could \ntake care of herself, as she had already proven. Kluster, however, seemed in \nneed of assistance.\n\n*****\n\nHysteria:\n\nHysteria cringed slightly as she slowly pulled herself into a sitting \nposition. Her armor was charred, and her gears groaned and sparked everytime \nshe moved. Right now, however, her condition was of little importance. The \nAlliance &#39;bots were slowly nearing the bridge. It was under lockdown, but \nshe had no knowledge of their weaponry or technical abilities. The \nflamethrowers that had been firing at Unitron and Firestarter had exploded.\n\nHysteria&#39;s laptop was in small pieces scattered throughout the ventilation \nshaft. Her interface cord, however, was still operational. She plugged it in \nto the nearest access panel and checked the status of the CF. The shields \nwere at 45% and something was happening to the doors. Further inspection \nrevealed a weakening of their molecular level. She didn&#39;t know whether to \nblast it or just leave them alone for the time being.\n\nShe chose to ignore them and worry about more pressing matters, such as \nFirestarter and Unitron. Firestarter&#39;s missiles dented the thick door \nbarring his entrence, and left a large black mark where they struck. \nHysteria&#39;s scanners indicated that in the Brig four &#39;bots were attempting \nescape. She charged the undamaged autoguns on the far wall and fired \nmultiple rounds at Demolition and anyone else who happened to be out of \ntheir cell:\n\n&quot;This isn&#39;t going to work!&quot;\n\nThe shields were already fluctuating and more weapon&#39;s fire was heading \ntheir way. After the final missile struck the shield read 20% and failing. \nOne more blast like the last one and the shields would be nonexistant, \nagain.\n\nCF Comp: *Alert! Weapon&#39;s fire detected within proximity of unit Hysteria*\n\nHysteria quickly fired a blast from her left wrist cannon at the oncoming \nmissile. The resounding blast shook the vent and sent Hysteria tumbling down \nan access shaft. She landed hard in another part of the ship after falling \nabout 100 nearly vertical feet, taking a few involuntary turns, and nearly \ncrashing in to the vent walls:\n\n&quot;*groan* Where the slag am I?&quot;\n\nA pulsating sound to her right was all she needed to hear to know she was in \nthe CF&#39;s engine room. Hysteria looked up at the massive propulsion system of \nthe mighty ship. Maybe, just maybe...\n\nHysteria jumped to her feet, ignoring the pain that shot through her body. \nShe limped/ran to the large console beside the engine. Since it was located \nin the heart of the ship the engine room was virtually undamaged. If she \ncould reroute the power from the propulsion system it would be enough to \npower the shields and the EMP cannon! But it would also destroy any chance \nthey had of getting off the planet. She couldn&#39;t contact Kluster because of \ndamage sustained by her comm. She had no choice. Hysteria typed in several \npasswords, her fingers flying across the console as she feverishly worked to \nsave what little remained of the CF.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
