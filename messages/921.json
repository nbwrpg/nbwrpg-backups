That question raced through her mind as she laied \non her back, but she knew that if Gangon fought now it would be the end of \nher days as well.\nBrightBlade slowly reached up and pulled the staff from her chest as she \nactivated her com-link to Gangon...*\n\n&quot; Gangon...pull me to safety and we can both rest together. Then we can get \nthese...Maximal bastards where it really hurts!&quot;\n\n* She then rested her head on the ground, hoping that Gangon would hear \nher.*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
