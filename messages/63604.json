I have killed in most cruel ways, I may not be much better than Unicron.  But I want you to be safe, that is why you must keep your distance from me.  Wolfblade understands the risks better, and I would not be able to hurt her as easily.  I will tell you what I will tell her.  Stay away from me when I am angry or going to fight.
