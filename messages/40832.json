I am starting to work on the shield. Once \ncompleted, it will be able to protect us even from underground assaults. I \nexpect to be done in about twenty megacycles.\n\nMelchana:\nI am having some trouble with the power diversion core. In fact, the \ngenerator rejects any energy input into it. I request a training break \nbefore this machine makes me slag it to pieces with my blades!\n\nBelthassan:\nRequest accepted. (He knew the short temper of his sister, and he had known \nbots who had gotten on her nerves too long and too hard...)\nGesper, once you are done, get to the control room, I want your advice on \nthe strategic emplacements near the base.\n\nGesper:\nI read you. You think the cliffs to the west are going to pose a problem?\n\nBelthassan:\nMaybe... that&#39;s why I need you. Belthassan out. Computer, redirect any \nincoming messages to the planning room.\n\nThe computer acknowledged the demand as the Polar bear leader of the elite \nTripredacus force went back to the strategic planning room.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
