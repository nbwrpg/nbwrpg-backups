He decided that true courtship was best kept for \nwhen he could finally see her as he hoped to see her, with his own eyes. \nYet, at this moment he was very happy.  Just to have someone in his life was \na gift enough for him.\n\n&quot; When I first came back online, I thought there may have been a power \noutage in the med bay.  Then I was told it was no loss of power.  The medics \ntold me that the cranial shot I sustained was the culprit for my visual \nimpairment and that they weren&#39;t positive, but thought the damgage could be \nreversed.  After that, I recovered from other physical damages, but got used \nto being blind.  Other senses compensated for that and I just accepted it \nfor what it was.  Then an Autobot engineer came up with the idea of fitting \nme with a sonar system, and it worked.  I suppose I won&#39;t be needing it \nanymore once the repairs are complete.  That&#39;s - if it can be repaired.&quot;\n\nHe sighs.\n\n&quot; I knew it would take a long time, so I procrastinated and things got out \nof hand during the wars against the predicons and Decepticons, so I put that \non hold for a while, until we found a moment of calm.  So much for that. \nNow that Hydras and the Decepticons are at full force, and us with just a \nsmall handful of warriors, I fear that a full sense of calm won&#39;t be \nachieved.  It&#39;s up to Rodimus, Lord Elder and myself to get us to that \npoint.  I know we can do it, and if I&#39;m going to pull my weight in this war, \nI have to have all my senses online, including my sight.&quot;\n\nHis crystal blue optics although dimmed, shimmer like aquamarines against \nthe sun, as the light of the room catches them. Only until his sight is \nreturned, would they once again be iluminated with the same light as the \noptics of all the others.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes&quot;whispered Talon&quot;It&#39;s time &quot; and she Give him a deep and sweet Kiss\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message----- \n&gt; From: Sandy\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, June 12, 2011 4:40 PM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: the ARK to awaken from sleep!\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: This one&#39;s for Airshadow.\n&gt;\n&gt; BIC:\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson returns her kisses with some of his own, and then holds her gently \n&gt; in\n&gt; his arms.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What I wouldn&#39;t do to be able to see you with my own eyes, and finally \n&gt; have\n&gt; my optical sensors repaired permanently.

He had even leaned back a little to allow the two to hug and\n&gt; &gt; show affection. That is until ELITA&#39;s last statement and he could see\n&gt; &gt; the look on NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Smiling warmly and nodding RODIMUS took NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s hand. &quot;Yes,\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor has been instrumental in your recovery.&quot; Leaning back in he\n&gt; &gt; continued to smile at her, hoping to wipe away her fears if he could.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;From what we can tell, Perceptor has joined the Maximals.&quot; RODIMUS\n&gt; &gt; rubbed ELITA&#39;s head giving her reassurance and affection as well.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Just like our daughter here has said.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ******************************************\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor walked close to  Lord Elder and shook his head  and said \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; highly unlikely that that happens &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Outside, Uproar catches up to Lord Elder, as he observes the private\n&gt; &gt; &gt; code\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on  Tuscons door.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Wow, so, I guess Tucson and Talon are kinda gonna be like Rodimus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight.  I wonder if Tucson will ya know..  Have a family of his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some day?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ELDER looked away from the door, his optics reddening slightly. If he\n&gt; &gt; were human it might even seem like a blush. &quot;Who can say Uproar, who\n&gt; &gt; can say? I would imagine that that is something that we may all want\n&gt; &gt; to do at some point.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; TORCA and NOCTORRO walked with ELDER as well, their large forms\n&gt; &gt; swaying as they walked, the sound of their footsteps large and heavy\n&gt; &gt; as their metal booted feet hit the deck plating.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We still must talk.&quot; TORCA said looking at ELDER, his tone somber and\n&gt; &gt; resigned. NOCTORRO was tapping out a small message as they talked, but\n&gt; &gt; he looked up and nodded in agreement as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ELDER nodded as he glanced at TORCA and then at the others. &quot;Uproar,\n&gt; &gt; why don&#39;t you show Perceptor around the base and help him get settled\n&gt; &gt; in, I would imagine he will need to find some quarters and perhaps a\n&gt; &gt; recharging chamber coded to his requirements.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ******************************************\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moving to Legacy&#39;s quarters, Straight Shot thinks for a moment before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying anything, which was her best of traits.  Once she had an idea \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what she wanted to say, she looks up to Legacy, with an air of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sincerity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always had for everyone, including her brother.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Thanks, for letting me talk to you, I appreciate it.  I just wanted \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ya know that I think my brother doesn&#39;t quite understand where you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coming from and maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s so critical of your actions. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always been like that, not just around you, but with me too, and yeah,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes it gets on my nerves.  But with things as they are, and what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened ta him in the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s put up such a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; defense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and why he&#39;s so determined ta think off the pavement.  And maybe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed with mine too, at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Honestly though, how do you feel about his thinking outside the box? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a reason why you&#39;d rather not go that way?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For a moment LEGACY looked confused, his single crimson optic boring\n&gt; &gt; into STRAIGHT SHOT as his mind ran over what she said.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I do not understand all of the colloquialisms than you have\n&gt; &gt; utilized.&quot; He said at last, &quot;But I ascertain that you are attempting\n&gt; &gt; to explain your sibling&#39;s actions to me and inquiring as to why I will\n&gt; &gt; not allow Tuscon to disturb Optimus Prime&#39;s chassis.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEGACY&#39;s optic flickered for a moment. &quot;I appreciate your intent.&quot; He\n&gt; &gt; said his words clear and well articulated. &quot;But I do not require an\n&gt; &gt; explanation, since I have taken no offense to his actions; to do so\n&gt; &gt; would be an inefficient use of my time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;However to answer your question I will replay something for you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Turning to the screen that was standing behind LEGACY he fired a beam\n&gt; &gt; of energy at it. But instead of it exploding into shards of glass and\n&gt; &gt; debris it simply changed to show a mountainous scene, a volcano, and\n&gt; &gt; then the volcano exploding to reveal the Ark. It was obvious from the\n&gt; &gt; motion that the events were being speeded up for ease of viewing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Soon after it happened a small satellite like device rose up from the\n&gt; &gt; Ark and began to travel away from it and after a while return. After\n&gt; &gt; another short moment, short because of the speeded up play back,\n&gt; &gt; MEGATRON flew out along with STARSCREAM, SOUNDWAVE and a few other\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon seekers, obviously having been repaired by the device. They\n&gt; &gt; all land on a cliff and look back at the Ark, and STARSCREAM fires a\n&gt; &gt; blast at the Ark and they all fly off.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Inside the Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMUS PRIME is\n&gt; &gt; also is knocked into the beam and his repair process begins.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (OOC: This is the scene from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the bots and\n&gt; &gt; cons fell to earth and 4 million years had passed.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The scene fades to black.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;These sequence of cannot be disrupted.&quot; LEGACY intoned coldly.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Without the Autobots none of you would be here.&quot; LEGACY turned back\n&gt; &gt; to face STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;And without the Decepticon&#39;s attack on the Ark\n&gt; &gt; the Autobots will not survive.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEGACY folded his arms behind his back, &quot;There can be no disruption of\n&gt; &gt; the time flow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was a small beep on LEGACY&#39;s panel causing him to look over at\n&gt; &gt; it. &quot;Interesting.&quot; He said curiously. &quot;It would seem that I am\n&gt; &gt; required on the bridge.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
