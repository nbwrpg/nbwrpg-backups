He slows the EMP grenades with his mind,\nmaking them fall down toward the ground before they exploded, Prowl\nout of their range. His mind gives him the warning of an approaching\nbot seconds before he hears the scream, Prowl twisting in the air and\nbarely avoiding the vulture. He powers his boosters, trying to get\naway.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; The new bot that had been flyng at top speed for a while since his\n&gt; crash in the Sahera came close to the battle at the CF.
