He is not an enemy. I am afraid, \n&gt; &gt; Pacifix, that he is right. Our renewal chamber reformatted him in \n&gt; &gt; order to repair him, but he has lost his ancient self in the \n&gt; process. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Belthassan: That is true. I found him first. He seems to have no \n&gt; &gt; memories of his life before that of Anachronox...\n\n\n"}}
