But the hatred and anger in\nher optics would not subside. &quot;Rodimus, as a new member in all this, I\nwill follow the orders of my superior officer as is it so written in\nmy programs. But, I have no program that will make me trust a\nDecepticon or Predacon, not an Insecticon or Destructicon.  I will not\ntrust any of them. No matter how you order me to do so.....&quot; she\nturned and looked at Rodimus to emphisize this one word, &quot;Sir.&quot;  SHe\nthen looked at Megatron. She took a few paces forward so he was right\nin front of her. &quot;I have no interest in your story. I do not care what\nhas happened. I will word with you as I am ordered. I will do what my\ncommands are. But I will not like you, trust you or serve you.I may be\nsmaller and lighter than you. I may not have fire power or as many\nfighting programs. But I also will not let you make a move without me\nwatching you. I will make sure I know where you are at all times. Per\norders is seems we will have to work together, but I do not like it.\nAnd I don&#39;t like you. &quot;Her words like ice and sharp as razors.   With\nher voice synthisizer grinding under her breath, &quot;decepticon.&quot;  And\nwith that, she started to walk out of the room. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rodimus:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Reason number one, he had been with us for a large time, and I\nhaven&#39;t any complain about him&quot;said camly Rodimus&quot; Second, his brother\nand sister are loyal maximals and I haven&#39;t any complain neither;\nThird, he can tell ya by himself his story&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
