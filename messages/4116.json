They were fading but not as fast as he had first thought, but that also was what was so painful�slow dying systems were always that way. But as he kneeled he knew that he would need another step of dire will power to even stand up let alone walk, this was one of his weakest times and he was none too happy about it.\nWith a low growl he lifted his head and looked straight ahead of himself, his own vision blurry but enough so that he knew that the battle was over.\nHis breathing was very shallow and still raspy if not more, his spark beating slowly and seeming to almost completely quite at times�but it held on.\nDinobot tried to rise from his kneel but it was very difficult and painful, his first attempt failed and he sank back down to touch his knee to the dirt.  His second was more strained due to the stress it took to try and rise the first time but it was no better�not even raising 3 inches from the ground before sinking back. His body was wasted and he knew it, trying to stand would only tire him out to the point that he would no longer have the strength to even keep his basic functions active. Again he kneeled and hung his head, the thought of perhaps resting a bit to build up more energy passing through his mind. But Tavatron had told him to rise and he had tried, his systems were just too far gone to obey the command to move any longer�his systems were slowly dying. She had told him to rise�but he could not.\nThe concern in her voice bothered him, why should she be so worried about him? So what if she saw him as he friend, friends could be replaced for new ones�while the memory of the lost one was still present it could still easily be forgotten. He knew, Tavatron wasn�t the only one in which had lost friends but thanks to his cold sparkedness he had continued with nothing more then a pause�but that was just him.\nDinobot growled, there was no hope in the Pit that he could stand and he knew it, his structure basically frozen in a kneel in which he was in. A sudden spasm of pain pouring in through his back and shoulder, a small shower of sparks erupting from the circuits protruding from his shoulder. He clenched his teeth and bit back a yell of pain as the aching soon swamped over the raw pain and soon became a numb feeling, the more he stayed still the worse it seemed to become. As much as he knew that he could now stand he still had to try; the very existence of his spark depended on it!\nTaking in a few deep breaths to brace his structure for the massive pain ahead he tried to concentrate, focusing on his warrior diciplin to guide him through the onslaught of agony that would soon erupt from every circuit.\nWith the intake on the last breath he then bunched his metallic muscles underneath himself and struggled to rise from his position, even more mech fluid flowing from his wounds as his spark sped up and so did the fluid�s flow.\nAlmost falling back to his knees Dinobot strengthened his will power and forced his systems to move, finally coming to a stand that was not the steadiest but kept him on his feet. But walking would be another story, as much as he hated to admit it he could not walk on his own, yet.\nWhile he had been kneeling his repair system had been gaining power and was now to the point that it could help heal him, not enough power to heal his entire body but enough to make walking less of a strain.\nThe chamber in which his spark was held opened to reveal his very life source; green coils in which was his repair system slithered out and began to work on the worst of the damage.\nAlthough his body was slowly repairing Dinobot nearly dropped to his knees again, his legs almost on the verge of giving out.\nWithin moments the coils retreated back into his chest and his cavity covered and protected again, his systems a little more on the functioning side but not to the point of painless movement.\nWith a sigh he then stood up a bit more steady, taking none to assured steps towards the base just to test the extent of the repair. Then stopping and looking around a bit just to get his barring but then looking back towards Tavatron, she was worried about him and he knew it but there was no real reason to be. As long as he had the will to fight he had the will to live as well and there was no reason for concern. With that he then turned back towards the base, his voice a bit strained from the pain but nothing more�*\n\n� I am not one so easily�vanquished. Concern is not needed.�\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
