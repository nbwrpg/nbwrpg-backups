He remembered passing out.\n\nLunarpine was in some kind of chamber similar to a stasis pod he glared out\nthe glasslike front trying to focus his eyes. he heard the gurgleing bubbles\nof the tank around him. H tried to smell the air but only got a nostril of\nthe strange fluid he was being bathed in. His eyes slowly focussed on an\nimage outside the chamber,\n\nVeratis stood outside at a control pannel looking at the status of his new\nguinee pig (Figure of speach, he didn&#39;t really turn Lunarpine into a guinee\npig.) &quot;Ah you&#39;re awake then it would seem I was successful.&quot; The scientist\nlooked his subject up and down.\n\n&quot;If I get out of here I&#39;m going to shred you  so bad that it&#39;ll take a\nmaster welder to reassemble you.&quot; Lunarpine thought, knowing he couldn&#39;t\nspeak through the liquid.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s not a nice thing to think about the bot who just improved you.&quot; The\nscience bot somehow knew what Lunarpine was thinking and Lunarpine just\nrealized he could hear Veratis through the noisy liquid. &quot;It would appear\nyou&#39;ve been hiding things from me. Now is that any way to treat a gracious\nhost?&quot;\n\nLunarpine didn&#39;t understand any of this but he had to find out. &quot;How do you\nknow what I&#39;m thinking? Curiosity killed the cat, Lunarpine is a wolf so he\nwas safe.\n\n&quot;I rerouted your thought patterns through this computer, I did the same with\nmy own so you could understand me.&quot; Veratis seemed sure of himself and his\nwacky experiments but he didn&#39;t seem to be gloating. &quot;Now that I answered\nthat question it&#39;s my turn.&quot; His grin showed that he had the upper hand and\nhe knew it. &quot;Who&#39;s Shadow Wing, I got a distinct image while you were\nabsent.&quot;\n\nThe look on Lunarpines face told Veratis all he needed to know.\n\n\n\n"}}
