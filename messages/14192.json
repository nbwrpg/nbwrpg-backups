She \nwent intot he computer room and found him yelling at Waspinator.  She \nsmiled, she never did like that insect of a bot.  She looked at \nMegatron.  She took a deep breath and walked towards Megatron.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Aracnia was glad to have Darkmouse back, but she was right \nabout the \n&gt; Aliens. It would be best right now if everyone got into the bunker \nbefore the \n&gt; Armada sent someone or something else. Besides it was begginning to \nrain and \n&gt; thunder.\n&gt;     &quot;Everyone! Listen! I need to very brave bots to go and find \nMegatron, \n&gt; arrest him, and bring him back here!&quot; She looked into the faces of \nher \n&gt; troops. &quot;He knows vital information about the Aliens, and Im afraid \nhe is \n&gt; going to use it agianst ALL of us.&quot; She said still holding a \nsmoking \n&gt; bowcaster.\n&gt;     Megatron was the only one to come in contact with the Aliens. \nHe fled and \n&gt; was gone from scans. Knowing him, he was probly trying to contact \nthem \n&gt; himself. And that wasnt good.\n&gt;     She continued, &quot;If Im right, then were all in troble. He is \nsure to cause \n&gt; us all great pain. We nedd two of the best warriors. I want \nDarkmouse to go \n&gt; because she has energon flowing within her, and that should sustain \nher \n&gt; through great damage...&quot;\n&gt;     Aracnia looked longingly at the mouse.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron was indeed planning on contacting the Aliens, but the \nnoise out \n&gt; side, along with the battle, was ruining his plans. For the most \npart all he \n&gt; knew was that a small army had come to destroy his troops, and he \nlost 2 \n&gt; already and had a remaining four, including Waspinator.\n&gt;     Waspinator was nervous, he paced and fluttered here and there. \nOne minute \n&gt; he wanted to fight, the next minute he was terrified. Megatron saw \nthis and \n&gt; was ready to bash his face in.\n&gt;     &quot;Get outside now! I want the invaders crushed!&quot; Megatron \nroared, slamming \n&gt; the bug into a few nearby computeres.\n&gt;     Waspinator sprung up and jetted over to KitKat and covered her \nin the \n&gt; crossfire. Megatron returned to his work.\n&gt;     Soon, he hoped, he would be in contact with Apollo agian. But \nthis time \n&gt; he would be ready. Because this time he held a wepon that would not \nonly \n&gt; threaten Apollo, but his whole damned species as well.\n\n\n"}}
