She looked out and saw the expansion \nof the forest open up in front of her.  She wondered how she and \nLunarpine would ever make things work.  One minute, they were \nlaughing and having fun.  And the next, trying to bite each other&#39;s \nheads off.  She knew that in the wild, wolves and owls mated for \nlife.  But how one Cybertron would she make things work for her and \nLunarpine, she had no idea.  She looked and saw the clouds moving \nquickly across the sky.  \n\nShe looked down and saw a rabbit hopping long the forest floor.\nShe shook her head, she wasn&#39;t in the mood to hunt. She knew \nLunarpine needed to be in the company of other wolves.  She too, \nlonged for the company of other owls.  She was willing to give that \nup for him.  But she knew that he would never give up being a wolf \nfor her.  She would have to learn to just accept things as they were \nnot what she wished they would be.  She felt, somewhere in her spark, \nthat someday she might have to give up and let her wild wolf go free.\nShe somehow knew that that day would eventually come.  She let a tear \nroll off her cheek and down her beak.  &quot;Wolves belong in the wild and \nneed to be free. If need be, I&#39;ll give you that freedom Lunarpine.&quot; \nshe said to herself.  \n\n\n"}}
