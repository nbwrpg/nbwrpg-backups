She keeps going, then \nsuddenly the ground drops and she falls down a hillside.  Bumping \ninto trees and rocks on the way down.  She gets back up and stumbles \nforward again trying to get away from the other bots.  She stops by a \nsmall stream and kneals down for a drink of cool water.  the water \nfelt good doing down.  She took her paw and splashed some cool water \non her face.  She heard noises behind her and got back up.  Still a \nlittle light headed, she kept going through the trees.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, crow_lord@h... wrote:\n&gt; Scopronok\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Scopronok fired a missle off in the direction of the incoming \nfire. \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll send cyberbee after her.&quot; He says that as he launches \nCyberBee \n&gt; after Darkmouse.
