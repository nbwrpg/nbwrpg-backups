My paint jobs baking in this heat!&quot; he complained as he squatted \ndown in Blue Flame&#39;s shadow to try and get out of the sun.\n\nAlthough Diesel Runner squinted out into the distance, her hands on her \nhips. &quot; Maybe they&#39;re not coming.&quot;\n\nSand Storm looked up at her with a flabbergasted expression from watching a \nlady bug crawl over his foot. &quot; You can&#39;t be serious. They HAVE to!&quot; he \nwhimpered.\nBut Blue Flame only shrugged as he looked down at the little dune buggy. \nKind of feeling sorry for the little guy.\nHe didn&#39;t want to be stranded here any more then Sand Storm did. But there \nwas nothing they could do about it. They were stuck here.\nAlthough...by the way Dark Cloud acted all calm and collected, it didn&#39;t \nseem to make any difference to HIM.\nBlue Flame sighed as he let his shoulder-plates sag as the heat even began \nto bother him too.\nThey were getting low on energy again...but at that thought he glanced over \nat their fearless leader.\nD.R. seemed to be going as strong as ever, even though she hadn&#39;t energized \nwith the rest of them before they&#39;d dealt with that core.\nHow did she do it?\n\n&quot;Well, if they&#39;re not here in fifteen minuets, who ever they are...we&#39;re \ngoing to go and see if we can find a place to spend the night.&quot; the fembot \nannounced before turning to her crew. &quot; I&#39;m not going to wait forever for \nanyone.&quot;\nAnd frankly, this heat was getting to her too.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
