He spent most of his time in \nhiding ashamed of his beast mode.  He is forced to live with his deformed \nbeast mode.  It is that of a dragon.  It is not a large, fierce dragon, \nhowever.  It is a small pup of a dragon that was scanned.  Thus he lives with \na beast mode of minimal size and no power.  He makes up for that with \nincredible speed and a powerful robot mode.  In robot mode he can control \nenergy to the point where he can emit beams of pure energy from his hands.  \nHe also has the ability to craft blades of pure energy in an instant.  The \nblades disperse as soon as he releases them and are thus no threat to him.\n\n    He wandered away from where he had been living.  He happened to live in \nan area that was rarely visited by other bots to better his hiding.  Because \nof this the puny dragon was startled to see a very large and vaguely \ndragon-like bot flying towards him in the air.  He sniffed the air.  His eyes \nbulged.  &quot;I recognize that scent.  It is the stench of evil.  But how can I \nknow that?&quot;  He raises his arms above his head and lets out a primeval \nscream.  He floats upward without having to use his puny wings.\n\n    Floating in the air his tiny limbs begin to glow.  As they pulse with \niridescent light he pulls in his arms and legs only to fling them back out \nwith a burst of energy.  Humanoid arms appear with the dragon&#39;s arms as a \nloose gray shirt covering his upper body.  Soon he pulls his legs in and \nflings them out as well.  This time the dragon&#39;s legs form loose pants the \ndeep blue shade of the night sky.\n\n    Again he flings back his head.  This time when he opens his mouth the jaw \ndrops forming a chin guard.  Two scarlet fangs rise from this along his face \nto end in points at his cheekbones.  Two smaller fangs of a deep crimson \nreach from the top of the dragons jaw to the central top of his eye sockets.\n\n    His previously rudimentary wings surge with power.  They slowly bulge and \nburst into large scaled wings.  With his transformation into his robot mode \nsuccessful, Enertron flaps his large wings and flies toward the large evil he \ncould smell from the ground.\n\n"}}
