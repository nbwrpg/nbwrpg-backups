He sighs, \nmaking no move to respond to her kiss, but leaning back and looking \ninto her eyes.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he says, holding back from calling her &#39;love&#39;. He wasn&#39;t \nsure if she still wanted him to call her that. He could feel emotions \ncoming from her, but he couldn&#39;t make them out.\n\n&quot;I .. I don&#39;t know,&quot; he replies to her words after she kissed him. He \nwas still mad at himself, and probably would be for the rest of his \nlife. Maybe it would have been better if Obitertron had killed him \nback at the last battle, instead of smashing him into near death, \nmaybe it would be better for Iron Raptor if Prowl was killed in the \nnext battle...\n\nBut no, Prowl knew that if either one of them died now, the other \nwould as well, it was part of his deal with the Matrix.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll leave if you wish,&quot; he says, not knowing why the words came out \nof his mouth, &quot;You&#39;d be better off with someone else.&quot;\n\n&#39;Like Dinobot&#39;, he finished to himself, wishing that he had not \nthought that as he realizes how much better the reptile could have \ndone this procedure.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
