I am Star Colonel Ragnar of Clan Ghost Bear, Commander of the \n1st Rasalhague Bears, an veteran Cluster in the elite Alpha Galaxy. As \nI was taken as a bondsman by the Ghost Bears, I tested out again \nonly three months after my capture with three kills in my initial \ntrial of position. I have fought Clans Wolf, Jade Falcon, Smoke Jaguar \nand mauled all of them. I believe I am worthy. Two mere soldiers are \nno match for me, quiaff?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Empath states as she glides into the room, acting as if \n&gt; reformatted Decepticons come through here every day.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ragnar let go of a hearty laugh.
