That \nwould also be another matter she would be forced to worry about, which she \nwas.\nBut, then as she sighed again, a sudden and sharp pain seemed to rip from \nher spark cavity and seemed to spread over all of her limbs.\nShe drew in a quick breath and quickly uncrossed her arms, thinking that it \nmight ease the pain and let a little more are into her lungs.\nBut even just as her arms fell at her sides the pain receeded and finally \nleft, leaving her with a constant ache all over her body.\nIron Raptor swallowed hard and closed her optics for a moment, wondering \njust what that pain could ever be.\nShe wasn&#39;t damaged and her circuits were just fine.\nThen...what could it possably be?\nIron Raptor opened her optics then, lifting her hand to her face only to \nstop and watch it before it reached her cheek.\nIt was tremmbling, her hand.\nShe growled and closed that hand into a fist, leaving it on her lap as she \nsimply sat on the table edge.\nIt was all so strange, and she couldn&#39;t explain it at all.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n* Iris&#39;s program indicated that somebot had asked for her assistance.*\n\n&quot; Scanns? Verify the reason why you have requested such things, please.&quot;\n\n* She waited calmly for an answer...but she wasn&#39;t about to give info to \njust anyone for any reason.*\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n* Zyber entered the smaller cave in the rear of her own, the one which \nhoused the stasis locked bot.\nIt was a shame that he was unconciouse, she would at least have liked to get \na name out of him.\nBut, she was content enough to treat him without being on the basis of a \nname, just as long as he got well enough later to tell it to her.\nZyber walked up to the edge of her fur covered bed and set what she had \nbrought with her beside it.\nA bason of water and a few dried herbs from her storage space, a little bit \nof salve that she used on her own bumps and scrapes a few times a while ago \nand a drinking cup.\nFirst she took the bason full of water and simply placed the herbs into it, \nthen setting the large bowl onto a small rach set above the fire that she \nhad riged earlier.\nThis would make a strong tea which would actually begin to warm up and \nrepair the small systems that might be damaged, making it so that this new \nbot could heal on his own. With a bit of her help of course.\nAfter tending to the tea she then picked up the small rock jar with the \nsalve and walked over to the head of the bed, taking a fair sized wad of it \nonto her index and middle finger.\nWith practiced ease she rubbed the herbal salve onto the stasis locked bot&#39;s \nchest, knowing that it would desalve into the armor and actually begin to \nclear the lungs. And, if she was lucku, wake him up as well.\nShe rubbed in the salve until it had turned translicent, then simply wiped \nthe remainder on her fingers off onto a piece of fur and thenwalked over to \nthe tea again.\nWith a sigh Zyber sat down in front of the fire and leaned her back against \nthe footboard.\nAll she could do now was wait and see if everything would work, and hope \nthat the boit wouldn&#39;t be hostile when he awoke.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
