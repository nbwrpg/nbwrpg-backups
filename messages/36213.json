His massive \ngattaling\n&gt; gun blazing.\n\nInside the Violator, Skywarp, Gemini 1, and Destruction arrive on the \nbridge and immediately go to their stations. Gemini 1 laughs as he \nwatches on a vid screen Cygnar and Drillbit coming out of a hole \nbehind the trainers shields.\n\nGemini 1: &quot;This is so going to piss those two guys off...&quot;\n\nGemini 1 laughs evily as he presses a few buttons and 4 panels on the \nship open up and four odd looking laser cannons rise from them. \nQuickly each locks onto Cygnar and Drillbit. The first two then open \nfire on Drillbit and the other two open fire on cygnar. As each beam \ntravels towards its intended target they reach the trainers shield, \nwhich would by any means would have stopped the beams from reaching \ntheir intended targets. However these were no ordinary laser cannons, \nand these were no ordinary laser beams, instead of being stopped by \nthe shields, the 4 beams passed harmlessly through them showing no \nsigns of slowing down.\n\nGemini 1: &quot;Gotta love Multiphase laser cannons...&quot;\n\n\n"}}
