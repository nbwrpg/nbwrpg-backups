She saw one bot throw grenades at two other bots below \nher.\n\nShe spread her wings and prepared for battle.\n\n&quot;Blast this goody-goody programming of mine.  This isn&#39;t my fight.

He looks at her\n&gt;dumbfounded. He watches her as she walks away. Rhinox mumbles to\n&gt;himself. &quot;How am I to fight with no wepons?&quot; Rhinox looks at Key&#39;s CR\n&gt;Chamber. &quot;Good she&#39;s about to get out. I better get in one.&quot; Rhinox\n&gt;sees that there is an autogun in the roof. &quot;Autogun, Fire on all\n&gt;Non-Maximals when they come through the door.&quot; Rhinox open the CR\n&gt;Chamber he&#39;s about to get in. &quot;Ohhh and if any Non-Maximal does come\n&gt;in open up my CR Chamber.&quot; Rhinox steps inot the CR Chamber, and\n&gt;Starts to heal himself.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Sniper looks around for some one to attack. He sees the target, Zeus.\n&gt;He pulls out a another rifle and sets it to rapid fire. He runs at\n&gt;Zeus firing 50 lasers from his 2 rifles and 3 optic blast.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;BH/BlastRage\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;BH looks at Prowl. &quot;Die Maximal.&quot; He fires his 2 Semi-automatics at\n&gt;Prowl, producing 50 Lasers and he fired 2 Optic Blast.\n&gt;\n&gt;BlastRage fire 10x more Gernades at SnowTech and ShadowCat. &quot;Stupid\n&gt;maximals, standing together.&quot; He fires 5 optic Blast at the base.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
