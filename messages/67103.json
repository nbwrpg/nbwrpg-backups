Oddly enough though his\nwords contain nothing of the false provado, abject\nfear, or whining ingratiation of a newly created\nPredacon. Instead it contains only the calm confidence\nof a soldier with a hint of arrogance, some of which\nbecomes a little more pronouced with his next four\nwords: &quot;I await your orders.&quot; \n\nOOC: Keep in mind, Myrmidon is speaking accross the\nold Beast wars Predacon channels. ANY of the Predacons\nmay be able to hear him if they choose to. \n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nNeed a vacation?
