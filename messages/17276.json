All posts with Skulletron&#39;s escape and replies to it \nare now VOID!\n\nDcoburn, your post was extreme moding.\n  1. You didn&#39;t let any Maximals respond before getting away from one \nof the most secure bases on the planet IN ONE POST! There are \nautodefences inside and outside the ship, and you have to let \neveryone respond to an escaping prisoner.\n  2. You went from the Cybertronian Fire to the Alliance base in ONE \nPOST. The Cybertronian Fire is very far away, especially on foot. \n\nIf I see another post like this, I will moderate the sender without \nwarning. This might seem a bit harsh, but I&#39;ve just failed an English \ntest and am not in the mood to enforce the f***ing rules.\n\nAlso, now that posts like this are starting to come in, I&#39;m going to \nfocus harder on the &#39;letting people reply&#39; rule. Things like breaking \ninto/out of a base, or shooting through a 20 foot thick wall, are \njust irrational to do it in one post, SO DON&#39;T DO THEM! This is a \nrule, and has been a rule for a long time now, but lately people have \nbeen breaking it.\n\nThis really is nothing new, just RP well and let the people involved \nreply. Just like it has been for the last year or so in this RPG.\n\n\n\nAnd, Alloran, Soundwave wasn&#39;t killed for parts, its just that events \nturned out this way, and his body happens to be in the lab.\n\n\n"}}
