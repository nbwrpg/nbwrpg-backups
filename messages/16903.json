She had a \npelt drapped over her back. Artifical skin and metal weren&#39;t well at \nkeeping the heat in. She traveled miles from Africa where she had \nbeen put on-line, to a cold, bitter land of ice and snow. It was the \nonly place she found safe away from her own kind. But as always, she \ncouldn&#39;t escape her memories. Her treachery. \n\nShe walked on, her temperature core working at their most. He claws \nslipped over a sheet of ice below the snow, stumbling slightly. After \ntwo more steps, the ice collapsed, dropping the velociraptor several \nfeet down a pit. She landed on her side, with a fur pelt over head \nhead. She snarled.\n\nHe lurched to her feet and tossed her head about until she threw the \npelt off. He looked around. She found herself in an underground ice \ncavern. She bared her teeth and looked up. That was simple. She had a \nflight mode. She could always fly out.\n\nBut why not explore? She may find something interesting. She walked \ndown the crevasse, watching the blue and white glistening ice and \nsnow.\n\nShe went on until she came across erected stalactmites of ice. She \nsaw it as rather beautiful. She walked to them, looking at her \ndistorted reflection. She tilted her head. A light flickered inside \nthe ice stalactmite. She bared her teeth at it. \n\nA male voice echoed through the cavern. Cyber Claw hissed and jumped. \nShe thrashed her tail feriously. It wasn&#39;t of the Predacon language \nnor the Maximal language.\n\nShe transformed to robot mode, and withdrew her fighting staff. She \nwaited for something to happen, and it did. Something busted out of \nthe icy ground and grabbed her ankles. She looked down. There were \nfour wires. She hissed at them and activated her flight mode. The \nwires held onto her. \n\nThe wires suddenly threw her, further down the cavern. She shook her \nhead, her face held in a harsh glare like her male double. Again, the \nwires broke out from the ice and grabbed her. She tried to fly again, \nbut it pulled her. It pulled her into the next section.\n\n\n"}}
