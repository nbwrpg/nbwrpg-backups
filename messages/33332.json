Of course you \ndo! Okay! Anyway, first of all, this is the main chamber, it serves \nwell because it&#39;s main. It&#39;s where you are when you first walk in, \nit&#39;s where you are when you see the door! It&#39;s where we go sometime \nto leave the base, it&#39;s also where we go after we come in! It&#39;s got \nall these cool computers and stuff, and tables and that and it&#39;s \nwhere we are right now! Isn&#39;t that a coincidence? Well, anyway, it&#39;s \na nice room maybe a little too dusty but then again maybe not and \nit&#39;s a good room because it has lots of room, and it leads into all \nof the other rooms, it&#39;s also one of the biggest rooms, which is \ngood, because everyone might try to come in at the same time, and if \nthey do and the room is really tiny then everyone will be crowded and \nthe base might explode. Also, it&#39;s big because something might happen \nlike someone breaks in, and there might be a shootout and everyone \nwill get shot if there isn&#39;t much room, did I mention that? I don&#39;t \nthink I did, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I know I&#39;m not wrong \nbecause I&#39;m right. Anyway, I&#39;m Squawktalk and you are? I mean what&#39;s \nyour name, I&#39;m not calling you Squawktalk, that would be silly, \nwouldn&#39;t it? I hope you have a nice name, you probably do, but I \nstill hope, because hoping can get you stuff sometimes, and anyway, \nit&#39;s fun, so about your name, it should be nice because my name is \ncool and I met you, didn&#39;t I? Anyhow, what I was trying to say is \nthat maybe we&#39;ve spent too long in this room, want to go to the next \nroom? It would be good because then we won&#39;t be in this room and \nwe&#39;ll be in the next one instead and I can talk to you in there just \nhurry up and don&#39;t take forever, okay?...\n\n\n"}}
