She knew \nhe was back in the realm of the living.  She smiled again.  She knew \nthat he was alright and functioning again. She felt happy knowing \nthat they were still together in some way. It gave her hope that one \nday, she would be joined with him again. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine opened his eyes, a blueish haze seemed to surround him he \nfealt\n&gt; odd and a little sick. He remembered passing out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine was in some kind of chamber similar to a stasis pod he \nglared out\n&gt; the glasslike front trying to focus his eyes. he heard the \ngurgleing bubbles\n&gt; of the tank around him. H tried to smell the air but only got a \nnostril of\n&gt; the strange fluid he was being bathed in. His eyes slowly focussed \non an\n&gt; image outside the chamber,\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis stood outside at a control pannel looking at the status of \nhis new\n&gt; guinee pig (Figure of speach, he didn&#39;t really turn Lunarpine into \na guinee\n&gt; pig.) &quot;Ah you&#39;re awake then it would seem I was successful.&quot; The \nscientist\n&gt; looked his subject up and down.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If I get out of here I&#39;m going to shred you  so bad that it&#39;ll \ntake a\n&gt; master welder to reassemble you.&quot; Lunarpine thought, knowing he \ncouldn&#39;t\n&gt; speak through the liquid.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s not a nice thing to think about the bot who just improved \nyou.&quot; The\n&gt; science bot somehow knew what Lunarpine was thinking and Lunarpine \njust\n&gt; realized he could hear Veratis through the noisy liquid. &quot;It would \nappear\n&gt; you&#39;ve been hiding things from me. Now is that any way to treat a \ngracious\n&gt; host?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine didn&#39;t understand any of this but he had to find \nout. &quot;How do you\n&gt; know what I&#39;m thinking? Curiosity killed the cat, Lunarpine is a \nwolf so he\n&gt; was safe.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I rerouted your thought patterns through this computer, I did the \nsame with\n&gt; my own so you could understand me.&quot; Veratis seemed sure of himself \nand his\n&gt; wacky experiments but he didn&#39;t seem to be gloating. &quot;Now that I \nanswered\n&gt; that question it&#39;s my turn.&quot; His grin showed that he had the upper \nhand and\n&gt; he knew it. &quot;Who&#39;s Shadow Wing, I got a distinct image while you \nwere\n&gt; absent.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The look on Lunarpines face told Veratis all he needed to know.\n\n\n"}}
