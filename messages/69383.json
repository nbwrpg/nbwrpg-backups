What they want is to destroy\n&gt; us, and they will follow us wherever we decide to have our base.

Knowing that their only hope of survival was\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; safely crash land, the pilot picked an open area of ocean and tried to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; approach at a safe angle to slow itself enough to keep the ship intact.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Lord Perseus and his crew walked along the bridge that crossed the gap\n&gt; &gt;&gt; between the part of the island where the hangers were located and the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; peninsula area where the base sat. Suddenly the sky became dark and a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rumbling noise could be heard, growing louder and louder. He looked up\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; see almost the whole sky occupied by a massive starship seemly heading\n&gt; &gt;&gt; straight for the island. The Atlantis emergency alarm started to sound\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; civilians rushed to their shelters.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Everyone! To the base! Hurry!&quot; ordered Perseus breaking out into a run.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The rumbling sound continued to get louder. As Perseus and his crew\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reached\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the base door, it was quickly opened for them then shut behind them. He\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ordered everyone to move the lower level of the base. As the ship passed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; over the island, the sound grew so loud that the ground shook and weaker\n&gt; &gt;&gt; parts of buildings started to crumble, as in an earthquake. The ship\n&gt; &gt;&gt; traveled for another three miles before it touched down in the deep\n&gt; ocean\n&gt; &gt;&gt; waters. The force of the impact sent the ship hundreds of feet below the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; surface and it continued to sink until coming to rest on the top of an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; underwater mountain. The mass of water displaced by the ship started a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; massive tsunami-like wave, going out in all directions.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The ground began to shake again and the lights flickered inside the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Maximal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; base.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Sir, what&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing the last heavy door to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; underground section of the base.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The lights continued to flicker, then went out.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; At that moment the ten-story-high wall of water struck Atlantis from the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; east, picking up all the boats in the harbor and tossing them onto the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; land.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The parts of the docks that were not made of concrete were pushed up and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; destroyed. A moment later the water hit the buildings in the lower wharf\n&gt; &gt;&gt; area and they immediately collapsed under the intense weight of water.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Likewise the metal dome that made up the upper story of the Maximal base\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; immediately ripped from its foundations and carried away, along with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; everything in the command center, the armory, mess hall, and the main\n&gt; bank\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of CR chambers were also picked up and carried away.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The lower floor of the base had a large metal slab to protect it from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bombing, and as the water continued to pour over it, everything on the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upper\n&gt; &gt;&gt; floors was ripped away, leaving a clean plate of metal sitting at the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bottom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the crater that was the base. The buildings along the center of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; town\n&gt; &gt;&gt; were a little sturdier and remained standing, though heavily damaged.\n&gt; The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hanger and all the craft in it were picked up and thrown into the ocean.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As the water came to tower it filled up the deep trench around the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; structure\n&gt; &gt;&gt; then the wall hit it, wrapping it entirely except for the top five\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stories,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; damaging supports, breaking out all the windows and destroying the\n&gt; bridges\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that allowed access to the tower. The wave then continued across the\n&gt; rest\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the island, destroying buildings and carrying away the mass of\n&gt; debris,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and then all was eerily quiet.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--0016e6475cfc2535c4046b58d448\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nOOC: did you message get cut off?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Sat,=\r\n May 30, 2009 at 9:23 AM,  &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:airly200=\r\n2@...&quot;&gt;airly2002@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); ma=\r\nrgin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; padding-top: 15px; backgroun=\r\nd-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot; bgcolor=3D&quot;#ffffff&quot; name=3D&quot;Compose message a=\r\nrea&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Talon:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font s=\r\nize=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&quot;So are we m&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nfamily: Tahoma; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: norm=\r\nal; font-size: 10pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stre=\r\ntch: normal;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background: rgb(245, 245, 245)=\r\n none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-backgro=\r\nund-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a title=3D&quot;kraftlos@...&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:kraftlos@gma=\r\nil.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kraftlos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sent:&lt;/b&gt; Sunday, May=\r\n 10, 2009 10:36 PM&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;To:&lt;/b&gt; =\r\n&lt;a title=3D&quot;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject:&lt;/b&gt; Re=\r\n: The Crash Landing and Aftermath&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Salveo landed their last re=\r\nmaining shuttle atop the metal slab that&lt;br&gt;once \nwas the Maximal Base.

Knowing that their only \nhope of survival w=\r\nas to&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; safely crash land, the pilot picked an open \narea of ocea=\r\nn and tried to&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; approach at a safe angle to slow itself \nenough =\r\nto keep the ship intact.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus and his \ncrew=\r\n walked along the bridge that crossed the gap&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; between the part =\r\n\nof the island where the hangers were located and the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; peninsula=\r\n area \nwhere the base sat. Suddenly the sky became dark and a&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; r=\r\numbling \nnoise could be heard, growing louder and louder. He looked up to&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt;&gt; see \nalmost the whole sky occupied by a massive starship seemly =\r\nheading&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; \nstraight for the island. The Atlantis emergency alarm =\r\nstarted to sound \nand&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; civilians rushed to their shelters.&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&quot;Everyone! To the base! Hurry!&quot; ordered Perse=\r\nus breaking out into a \nrun.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; The rumbling sound con=\r\ntinued to get louder. As \nPerseus and his crew&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; reached&lt;br&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; the base door, it was \nquickly opened for them then shut behind them. H=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; ordered everyone \nto move the lower level of the base. As the=\r\n ship passed&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; over the \nisland, the sound grew so loud that the =\r\nground shook and weaker&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; \nparts of buildings started to crumble,=\r\n as in an earthquake. The ship&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; \ntraveled for another three mile=\r\ns before it touched down in the deep \nocean&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; waters. The force o=\r\nf the impact sent the ship hundreds of feet \nbelow the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; surface =\r\nand it continued to sink until coming to rest on \nthe top of an&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n underwater mountain. The mass of water displaced by \nthe ship started a&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; massive tsunami-like wave, going out in all \ndirections.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; The ground began to shake again and the \nlights flickered i=\r\nnside the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; Maximal&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; \nbase.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; &q=\r\nuot;Sir, what&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing \nthe last heav=\r\ny door to&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; underground section of the \nbase.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; The lights continued to flicker, then went \nout.&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; At that moment the ten-story-high wall of water \nstruck =\r\nAtlantis from the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; east, picking up all the boats in the \nharbor=\r\n and tossing them onto the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; land.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; The parts of the \n=\r\ndocks that were not made of concrete were pushed up and&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; destroy=\r\ned. A \nmoment later the water hit the buildings in the lower wharf&lt;br&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; area and \nthey immediately collapsed under the intense weight of water.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; \nLikewise the metal dome that made up the upper story of the M=\r\naximal \nbase&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; was&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately ripped from its founda=\r\ntions and \ncarried away, along with&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; everything in the command c=\r\nenter, the \narmory, mess hall, and the main bank&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; of CR chambers=\r\n were also picked \nup and carried away.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; The lower f=\r\nloor of the base had a \nlarge metal slab to protect it from&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; bom=\r\nbing, and as the water \ncontinued to pour over it, everything on the&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; upper&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; \nfloors was ripped away, leaving a clean plate of m=\r\netal sitting at \nthe&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; bottom&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; of the crater that was =\r\nthe base. The \nbuildings along the center of the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; town&lt;br&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; were a little \nsturdier and remained standing, though heavily damaged. T=\r\nhe&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; hanger \nand all the craft in it were picked up and thrown in=\r\nto the \nocean.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; As the water came to tower it filled=\r\n up the deep \ntrench around the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; structure&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; then the =\r\nwall hit it, \nwrapping it entirely except for the top five&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; stor=\r\nies,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; \ndamaging supports, breaking out all the windows and destr=\r\noying the \nbridges&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; that allowed access to the tower. The wave t=\r\nhen continued \nacross the rest&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; of the island, destroying buildi=\r\nngs and carrying \naway the mass of debris,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; and then all was eer=\r\nily \nquiet.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n    \n    \n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;div=\r\n width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color: white; clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blo=\r\nckquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016e6475cfc2535c4046b58d448--\r\n\n"}}
