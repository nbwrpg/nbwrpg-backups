Though she felt love for \nhim, even though this city made her feel useless.\n&lt; Wars aren&#39;t suposed to be happy. They don&#39;t care about feelings, just as \nlong as one side trys to win over the other.&gt;\nSo, in short, war stepped on a lot of peoples toes.*\n\n&quot; Just ignore her.&quot;\n\n* Iron set a hand on Prowls arm and looked into his eyes, putting on a \nsmile.*\n\n&quot; And tell me who this Cyndro is.&quot;\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
