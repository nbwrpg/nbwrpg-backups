You don&#39;t have to read it unless you\n&gt; want to be bored. =P (or interested, if you like physics and stuff.)\n&gt;\n&gt; The boulder would land first, but not because it weighs more,\n&gt; because the feather float, it catches air. If it couldn&#39;t catch air, and\n&gt; therefore couldn&#39;t float, then they would both land at the same time.\n&gt; Ever watch Bill Nye: Science Guy? Wait.... lemme think about\n&gt; this.  Weight is mass multiplied by gravity, therefore force. Force\n&gt; doesn&#39;t affect velocity.\n&gt; The equation you would have needed to use to calculate how\n&gt; fast the objects are traveling is Ep + Ek = Ep + Ek (Ek=kinetic\n&gt; energy, and Ep=potential energy).\n&gt; Ek on the left side would cancel, because v=0 (v=velocity). The\n&gt; Ep on the right side would also cancel out, since h=0 (h=height).\n&gt; That leaves Ep=Ek. Ep=mgh, and Ek=0.5mv^2. (the &quot; ^ &quot; sign\n&gt; represents &quot;to the power of&quot;).\n&gt; Then you&#39;d have mgh=0.5mv^2. Mass cancels, making leaving\n&gt; us with gh=0.5v^2.\n&gt; Thus, I conclude that mass doesn&#39;t affect how fast you fall, only\n&gt; how high you are at the start.\n&gt;\n&gt; PS: weight is a force, in newtons. Mass is usually in kilograms, or\n&gt; pounds etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 5 Apr 2001, at 15:42, dcoburn wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Hehe, rAuq, weight does effect how fast you fall.
