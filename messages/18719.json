All sorts of Maximals were out fighting now. They had to be \n&gt; dealt with. He told the Trainers to lower themselves down so they \n&gt; were out fo range of Koj&#39;s jamming and scanned them. Most of them \n&gt; didn&#39;t have chips implanted in them. Time for new recruits. \nSecretly, \n&gt; Prebon gave the order to form the gestault Tamron, and he gave \norders.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Slayer, forget putting the wolf in stasis. Kill him. Savage, take \n&gt; out the Ark. If we can&#39;t win, we will destroy history!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tamron moved along towards the new bots. He fired two rockets \naround \n&gt; the area, and than launched two chips towards Maximals without the \n&gt; chip(Sky Lynx and Trinity) Savage flew up into the air and fired \ntwo \n&gt; fireballs down onto the main structure of the Ark.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix and Fliq were installing computer boards on the Ark when they \n&gt; heard the battle outside. They ran out and saw two fireballs come \n&gt; down on the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Savage.....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; They both begna firing at where they thought the dragon was.\n\n\n"}}
