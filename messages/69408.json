Your autob=\r\not character\n&gt; &gt; shouldnt be a problem; if I had to guess, maybe half our c=\r\nharacters have\n&gt; &gt; vehicle transformations, so you&#39;ll fit in. :D\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; The wiki is a little out of date, but you might want to check it out,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n especially the pages about the different locations.
