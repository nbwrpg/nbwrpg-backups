He \nholds his \n&gt; fire, growling. Striker&#39;s jetpack raises him into the air, the \nMaximal \n&gt; looking at Rush. He wished Ramulus were here, the ram was much \nbetter at \n&gt; negotiation than him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Allright, let her go and you can go peacefully,&quot; he says to Rush \nand the \n&gt; others, &quot;If you kill her, we&#39;ll be forced to attack you.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus, Brix, and Fliq stop as something flies overhead, their \nscanners \n&gt; picking up a non-Maximal signature. Ramulus frowns.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Can you guys get these pods back to the Ark?&quot; he asks Brix and \nFliq, the \n&gt; other two nodding.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Allright,&quot; Ramulus says, transforming into his beast mode, &quot;I&#39;ll \nsee you \n&gt; back at base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He gallops into the fores, following the flying bot (DeathScythe). \nBrix and \n&gt; Fliq continue on toward the Ark.\n\n\n"}}
