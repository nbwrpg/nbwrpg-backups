You could be a very valuable asset to the \nPredacon team. Your large, strong, well armed, and Im assuming you must be \nsomewhat intelligent to even think about trying to usurp me.&quot;\n    Waspinator and Aerostreak raised thier weapons as well, armed for killing \nthe imposter.\n    &quot;So, what do you say? Will you join us or will you force me and my troops \nto blow you bit by imposterous bit?&quot; He said, raising one eye brow to the \ndragon. \n\n"}}
