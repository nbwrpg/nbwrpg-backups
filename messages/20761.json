Killfest ducked under a shot, firing back at the \nbot that had fired and killing him with a well placed shot through \nthe spark. He looked around and saw burning buildings, dead bodies, \nand scattered metal pieces everywhere.\n\nThis was just a normal attack on a normal space colony, like so many \nthat he had led in the past. There was nothing different about it ... \nexcept for the fact that it marked the day of his defeat.\n\nKillfest was the leader of a fairly large group of terrorists. They \ntraveled through the vastness of space, pilfering, sacking, and \nrazing many a peaceful colony, selling scrapp and weapons to other \nvarious terrorists. It was an easy life, especially when a group was \nas equipped for fighting as Killfest&#39;s.\n\nThe terrorist leader jumped backwards as a bot&#39;s body flew past him. \nHe got a glance of it before it landed in the ruins of a collapsed \nbuilding, seeing that it was missing its head. That was the work of \nScyther, one of the bots in Killfest&#39;s group. Scyther was experienced \nin undercover missions, possessing the ability to alter his robot \nmode, changing his appearance completely and making him virtually \nunrecognizable. That, along with cloaking, spark signature masking, \nand several other abilities, made him the perfect spy, and an \nexcellent assassin. Killfest glanced over to where the bot had come \nflying from, watching Scyther slash off the head of another bot. \n\nScyther preferred disabling opponents through decapitation and then \nstabbing them cleanly through the spark instead of splattering their \nguts everywhere. Killfest had always preferred to mutilate his \nenemies, but it was a matter of personal preference.\n\nSeeing a group of enemy bots banded together and firing, Killfest \nstretched out his arms, pointing his fists at them. Two large guns \nemerged out of both his huge wrists, firing four blue beams at the \nground near the bots. The beams hit the ground at precisely the same \nspot, making a grenade-sized explosion that sent the bots flying in \ndifferent directions.\n\nA loud scream of rage came from behind him, followed by multiple \nexplosions. Killfest ducked as a mutilated bot flew over his head. He \nglanced up at it, actually able to see through it from the damage \ndone to its torso.\n\nEndBringer, Killfest thought to himself as he fired a pair of optic \nlasers at a random enemy, blowing off its head. EndBringer was \nanother bot under Killfest&#39;s command. Unlike, Scyther, EndBringer had \nno liking for a clean kill. Instead, he enjoyed mutilating his \nopponent as much as possible, leaving the body in pieces, and often \ncompletely unrecognizable as an ex-transformer.\n\nKillfest glanced behind him at the form of the half-insane bot, \nseeing a few of the colony defenders ganging up on him. He watched \nwith an evil smile on his face as one of the attackers jumped at \nEndBringer, flying back as one of EndBringer&#39;s four tentacles \ncontacted with him, sending electricity through him.\n\nTurning back to the battle yet again, a missile launcher flipped over \nKillfest&#39;s shoulder as he saw a bot rushing at him. The bot jumped, \nbut was blown to pieces by a missile before he ever hit Killfest. An \near splitting scream flew across the battlefield, the terrorist \nleader chuckling as he heard it.\n\nDemise. Killfest glanced to his left, seeing the bot holding an enemy \nin one of his huge clawed, arms, a cable connecting the held bot to \nDemise&#39;s mouth. That was Demise&#39;s own special attack. The chord that \nhe launched from his mouth latched on to the victim bot, hacking into \ntheir neural circuitry and sending unbearable waves of pain through \nthem. Other than that, Demise had very weak optic lasers as his only \nother long-range weapon, his hands being too large and accuard to \nhold anything else. Demise threw his now-twitching victim aside, \nswiping his claws at another attacker. Behind Killfest, a bot ran up, \njumping at him.\n\nKillfest roared as a pair of hands wrapped around his neck, the bot \nobviously attempting to tackle him to the ground from behind.\n\nKillfest was much too large for that.\n\nReaching behind him and simply grabbing the bot&#39;s back, Killfest \nswung the attacker over his shoulder, bringing up his knee and \nslamming the bot onto it. Sickening cracks sounded from the bot&#39;s \ntorso, Killfest dropping him to the ground.\n\nKillfest turned his head as another scream reaches his ears, quickly \nturning into a wet-sounding gurgling. He chuckled, watching a huge \nbot drop the crushed body of another one of the defenders onto the \nground. The defender&#39;s torso was crushed, his head and limbs sticking \nout in strange angles. The huge bot was Greven, another member of \nKillfest&#39;s team. It was usually Greven and EndBringer who caused most \nof the gore on the battlefield, being the two most violent bots on \nthe team. Greven grabbed another bot, smashing a fist through its \nchest.\n\nA shot hit the terrorist leader in the back, Killfest turning around \nand frowning. He was seeing something that usually didn&#39;t happen on \nthese raids. A colony defender was holding off a whole group of \nterrorists, about five or six of them. The bot was fairly large, but \nthen the terrorists were trained killers..\n\nThe terrorist leader took a step forward as one of the terrorists \njumped forward at the bot, a large shot blowing the terrorist back. \nThe bot jumped back from another terrorist, the large cannon that was \nattached instead of his left arm smoking.\n\nGrowling, Killfest took off at a jog toward the bot, the other \nterrorists around the defender making it impossible to aim. He \nwatched the bot jump up, his jetpack blazing. He fired a few blue \noptic shots, but failed to hit. He growled louder as the defender \ntransformed into a tank and fell to the ground, crushing three of the \nterrorists under his wheels.\n\nThat was enough. Reaching into a storage compartment, the terrorist \narmed an EMP rifle. Aiming it at the enemy bot, he fired three times.\n\nEnergy waves flickered over the tank&#39;s armor as all three of the EMP \nshots hit him, disabling circuits as they contacted. Continuing to \nmove for a few seconds, the bot finally stopped after running over \nthe remains of another one of the colony defenders.\n\nKillfest growled, looking at the tank and then glancing into the \ndistance, looking at the other side of the colony. He smiled, \nwatching a wave of destruction come toward his group. That was \nCrovax, his second in command, leading the other half of Killfest&#39;s \ngroup through the other side of the colony.\n\nA few hours later, the terrorists were gathered in a basement, \ncounting their gains and losses. The bot Killfest had stunned was \nstrapped to the table, now awake, swearing and yelling for them to \nlet him go and fight him. He was too strong for metal bonds, so they \nhad to use energon ones.\n\nSuddenly, the door blew in, a group of Maximals rushing in, weapons \nleveled at the chests of the terrorists.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re under arrest,&quot; one of them said, looking in disgust \nKillfest, &quot;Charged with murder. You can give us your weapons and go \npeacefully, or we can blast you to little pieces and take you back to \nCybertron that way.&quot;\n\nKillfest laughed, &quot;Maximals are putting me under arrest? How about we \nuse your pieces for scrap!&quot;\n\nThe terrorist leader brought up his EMP rifle, firing a shot at \nKluster&#39;s chest. The Maximal ducked, firing back at Killfest. For the \nnext several seconds, the room was filled with gunfire, objects \nexploding and bots screaming. Killfest spun around after ducking a \nshot, his eyes widening as he saw the colony defender&#39;s cannon aimed \nat him. The table had obviously been shot during the battle. Without \ntime to respond, Killfest was hit by an explosion, the room going \nblack....\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNow, a little while later, Killfest flies through space in a prison \npod, remembering that battle. After it, the Maximals had taken the \nsurvivors of the group to trial, and sentenced most of them to death. \nHe could still remember the day that his own sentence was carried \nout....\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHe and the others in his group that weren&#39;t sentenced to death had \nbeen marched out to the spaceports, a crowd gathering to watch. Their \nsentence was to be put in a pod, and sent out on a charted route that \nwould pass no major sectors, to fly through the vacuum of space \nforever.\n\nThe other members of his group that had escaped death were Scyther, \nEndBringer, Demise, and Greven. They were not any worse than the \nothers, in fact quite the opposite. Scyther didn&#39;t have any sort of \nrecord, as a bot like him was impossible to track. EndBringer, \nDemise, and Greven were brushed off by the record keepers as insane \nhomicidal bots, and Killfest himself was very careful to conceal his \ntracks. Due to lack of evidence, the Maximals had been forced to let \nthem live.\n\nThe Maximal commander that had captured Killfest stood in the crowd, \nwatching, his team around him. The Maximal commander&#39;s name was \nKluster, and his team included Rex, Proto, Grimmler, and recently, \nFirearm, who was the bot that had caused Killfest&#39;s defeat.\n\nKillfest and the other terrorists were put in stasis pods, and then \nlaunched out to space. The crowd began to disperse, but one bot \nstayed hidden from view on the roof of a building, watching the pods \nturn into small dots in the distance, the light of their escort&#39;s \nengine disappearing from view.\n\nThis bot&#39;s name was Hunter. He was a bot whose desire to destroy \nKillfest outmatched his desire to survive. Killfest had taken all \nthat was dear to Hunter on one raid on one colony, killing the only \nfemm Hunter had ever loved. Hunter had been left alive by accident, \nand he had sworn to rid the world of the terror Killfest had caused. \nHis whole life had been dedicated to that since the moment he had \ndiscovered who had led the attack on his colony.\n\nGlancing down at the planned route of the pods, a document that he \nhad &#39;borrowed&#39; from the Maximal elders, he growls to himself. The \nMaximals might see it fit to escort the pods to a few lightyears away \nand then trust them to follow their course from there, but Hunter \ndidn&#39;t. He would follow Killfest&#39;s pod, and make sure that it didn&#39;t \nwaver from its track.\n\nHunter was a loyal Maximal, and only respect for Maximal law \nprevented him for blowing Killfest&#39;s pod to smithereens as soon as it \nwas out of scanning range from Cybertron. If the pod wavered at all \nfrom its course, though...\n\nHunter turned, walking back to his small ship and lifting off, \nfollowing the pods.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFlying through space in his pod that served as a prison, Killfest&#39;s \nthoughts dwell on that period in his life, his defeat. He clenches \nhis fists in the pod, being able to stay conscious even through all \nthe precautions. He had tracked his progress all the way from \nCybertron, and he knew where he was. \n\nHe also knew what had happened to his crew. They had been sent off \nalong with him, but as soon as the escort left the pods, a ship had \ncome out of transwarp, and when it was gone, so were the other pods, \nand Killfest had been left alone.\n\nHe&#39;d had plenty of time to think. Playing over the final battle again \nand again, the face of that your colony defender had become the \nobject of his hatred. To him, it meant defeat, weakness, everything \nthat may have caused his downfall.\n\nKillfest clenches his fists tighter as the pod comes across some \nturbulence, being diverted from its path by a transwarp portal. If \nonly he got to see that bot again...\n\n\n\n"}}
