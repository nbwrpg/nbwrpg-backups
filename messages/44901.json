We&#39;ll play around with the story alittle. It all happened \non Cybertropolis, a moon of Cybertron. A clone of Megatron was \nplanning to take over the rest of the planet. Offically everyone there \ndied from the virus. Really, Cheetor inherited the ability to reformat \n(along with leadership), but after reimboding and reformating all the \nsparks they were abducted and are undergoing tests to get them out of \ntheir &quot;inferior&quot; state. Most of they tests revolve around the key to \nVector Sigma so many are dieing. The Malacons evolved from a few \nescapees. CAN YOU DEAL WITH THAT EDITED PLOT!!!!?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; I just want this rpg to say it happened. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s in the \n&gt; future, the past, OR ON AN OUTPOST THE MAXIMALS AND MEGATRON MISTOOK \n&gt; FOR THE FULL SCALE CYBERTRON (ya know that didn&#39;t look like enogh \n&gt; sparks Megatron was absorbing to be all of Cybertron).\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; But I doubt the way that post worked would denig any of yours \nwould \n&gt; &gt; it. I made BM out to be basically a state secret everyone knows \n&gt; about, \n&gt; &gt; but makes a point of not mentioning (or rather it&#39;s considered a \n&gt; &gt; historical side note). And that would basically be writting a book \n&gt; &gt; which would be fine except I&#39;m already writting a 3 part series \n(if \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; can get it published) I call &quot;Gundam Omega&quot;. It takes place in the \n&gt; &gt; year Martian Century 80. It involves the war between the Martian \n&gt; group \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Red Sphere&quot; and the now militaristic &quot;Earth Sphere United \nNations&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dewboy you cant post for the RPGs cybertron. YOu can post for \nyour \n&gt; &gt; alternate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dimension one. You want to make a cybertron based off BM? Go \n&gt; &gt; somewhere else \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and do it, then you&#39;ll be in charge. Just because you want your \n&gt; way \n&gt; &gt; doesnt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean your going to get it, so long as people oppose the idea of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; techno \n&gt; &gt; &gt; organic cybertron it will ntoi work. And notte Dewboy, you arent \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; only one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ot have posed from Cybertron others ahvbe. KSL has, I have, \nHugar \n&gt; &gt; has. yan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has. And none of those were trechnoorganic. so Dewboy TOUGH!\n\n\n"}}
