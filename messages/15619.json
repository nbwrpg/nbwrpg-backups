He&#39;d already gone through the pain of failing her now \nthis madbot&#39;s reminding him. He punched the front of his cylindrical \n(I like big words) prison trying to escape. His hand ached as it \nstruck the immovable surface. He glanced down at the hand. It was the \nhand that he used to strike with but it wasn&#39;t his. Lunarpine&#39;s \nsenses flooded with the realization of what had happened in his \nstasis lock. Not only did he get experimented on, he&#39;d switched \nbodies which meant he no longer carried Shadow Wings Spark with \nhim. &quot;You monster&quot; he howled ferociously glaring at the bot who&#39;d \nchanged him.\n\n&quot;So it finally sunk through your thick skull.&quot; Veratis answered &quot;But \nyou still haven&#39;t answered my question.&quot; Veratis turned his back to \nLunarpine as if to taunt him &quot;I&#39;ll wager a guess that you two were \nclose, and that hers is the second spark in your old body. Am I \nright?&quot;\n\nLunarpine didn&#39;t have to answer, Veratis had pieced together the \nequation nicely and both of them knew it. &quot;Yes, You&#39;re right she was \ndear to me.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good now that you&#39;re being so talkative you may ask a question.&quot; \nVeratis was back to his kind self showing courtesy even with \nLunarpine his prisoner instead of his guest.\n\n&quot;Where&#39;s my old body?&quot; Lunarpine asked, without power her Spark would \nsurely leave the body.\n&quot;It&#39;s been...&quot;Veratis paused trying to find the right words &quot;Taken \ncare of.&quot; There was no easy way to tell someone that thier old body \nwas chopped up into samples.&quot;But I placed the other spark in a safe \nplace. I can help you my friend but you have to tell me exactly what \nI ask for.&quot; Again he had Lunarpines hands tied.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She felt her smile fade as Lunarpine&#39;s image disappeared.  She knew \n&gt; he was back in the realm of the living.  She smiled again.  She \nknew \n&gt; that he was alright and functioning again. She felt happy knowing \n&gt; that they were still together in some way. It gave her hope that \none \n&gt; day, she would be joined with him again. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine opened his eyes, a blueish haze seemed to surround him \nhe \n&gt; fealt\n&gt; &gt; odd and a little sick. He remembered passing out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine was in some kind of chamber similar to a stasis pod he \n&gt; glared out\n&gt; &gt; the glasslike front trying to focus his eyes. he heard the \n&gt; gurgleing bubbles\n&gt; &gt; of the tank around him. H tried to smell the air but only got a \n&gt; nostril of\n&gt; &gt; the strange fluid he was being bathed in. His eyes slowly \nfocussed \n&gt; on an\n&gt; &gt; image outside the chamber,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Veratis stood outside at a control pannel looking at the status \nof \n&gt; his new\n&gt; &gt; guinee pig (Figure of speach, he didn&#39;t really turn Lunarpine \ninto \n&gt; a guinee\n&gt; &gt; pig.) &quot;Ah you&#39;re awake then it would seem I was successful.&quot; The \n&gt; scientist\n&gt; &gt; looked his subject up and down.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;If I get out of here I&#39;m going to shred you  so bad that it&#39;ll \n&gt; take a\n&gt; &gt; master welder to reassemble you.&quot; Lunarpine thought, knowing he \n&gt; couldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; speak through the liquid.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s not a nice thing to think about the bot who just improved \n&gt; you.&quot; The\n&gt; &gt; science bot somehow knew what Lunarpine was thinking and \nLunarpine \n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; realized he could hear Veratis through the noisy liquid. &quot;It \nwould \n&gt; appear\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ve been hiding things from me. Now is that any way to treat a \n&gt; gracious\n&gt; &gt; host?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine didn&#39;t understand any of this but he had to find \n&gt; out. &quot;How do you\n&gt; &gt; know what I&#39;m thinking? Curiosity killed the cat, Lunarpine is a \n&gt; wolf so he\n&gt; &gt; was safe.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I rerouted your thought patterns through this computer, I did \nthe \n&gt; same with\n&gt; &gt; my own so you could understand me.&quot; Veratis seemed sure of \nhimself \n&gt; and his\n&gt; &gt; wacky experiments but he didn&#39;t seem to be gloating. &quot;Now that I \n&gt; answered\n&gt; &gt; that question it&#39;s my turn.&quot; His grin showed that he had the \nupper \n&gt; hand and\n&gt; &gt; he knew it. &quot;Who&#39;s Shadow Wing, I got a distinct image while you \n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; absent.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The look on Lunarpines face told Veratis all he needed to know.\n\n\n"}}
