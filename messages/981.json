You are a Maximal & so am I.  Although I don&#39;t have any interes=\r\nt getting involved with your little war, I am aware of what the presence of=\r\n transformers on the Ark means to the timeline.  The last Beast War almost =\r\nsaw the alteration of our timeline & I cannot allow you bots to wage your w=\r\nar in here.  I have 3 Sentinel drones on the way here as we speak.  They ha=\r\nve orders to post postions outside the Ark & fire upon any Predicons that s=\r\nhow their ugly mugs.  Although I don&#39;t share your beliefs as far as the BEa=\r\nst Wars goes, I am aware that the Predicons will do whatever it takes to wi=\r\nn, even alter the timeline.  I do not like the fact that the Maximals are i=\r\nn here too but I know their motives are not to alter the timeline.  It&#39;s up=\r\n to you Maximal, we can go ahead & slag each other to molten metal or we ca=\r\nn hook up, find your comerades, & slag the remaining Preds in here.  It&#39;s u=\r\np to you!&quot;\nAs Fracturcon waits for Sniper to make his choice, he readies hi=\r\ns missiles for launch.
