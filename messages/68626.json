Quickly it shifted form and looked upward, its form and visage\n&gt; disturbingly familiar to those who know their history. The cyclopean\n&gt; gaze, the right arm sporting dual mounted cannons, the left arm that\n&gt; IS a cannon. Despite the color changes it looked like SHOCKBLAST!! \n&gt; \n&gt; Who ever it is, it stood below them, and began to fire upwards at the\n&gt; incoming minion!\n\nQuickly the remaining three minions scatter!\n\nPhobia shoots into the air and rolls to one side flying protectivly\nover where Deepstryke fell, her movements swift and sure, but there is\na slight note of panic in them!\n\nTumult and Decibel on the other hand streak in flying right at the\nblack and crimson figure, a full spread of missiles launching from each\nof them. \n\nThier missiles land with stupifying power and the ground cracks as\nmultiple explosions pit thier force against it.  Yet out of the fire\nand smoke the black tank moves seeming only a little worse for wear. A\nfew dents seem to crack its once perfect shell, but it niether slows no\nstops its own awesome assult. \n\nA rear mounted turret spun and oriented on Decibel as twin searing\nbeams cut through the air and into her rear stabilizer struts, she\ncried out agony!\n\nMeanwhile the main cannon lined up on Tummult and disgorged an energy\nblast that seemed to heat the air as it passed! The flier was a little\ntoo nimble for the new commer and was able to evade it, just barely. \n\n&quot;Who are you?&quot; Phobia&#39;s powerful voice spoke dangerously from her\nprotective postion over Deepstryke. &quot;You attack us at your peril!&quot; She\nwas worried, her scanners were picking up niether Predicon or Maximal\nsignatures. She assumed robot mode her cannons ready to fire!\n\n&quot;I AM LEGACY . . . &quot; Came the cold reply from below, &quot; . . . AND YOU DO\nNOT POSSESS THE POWER TO DEFEAT ME.&quot;\n\n&quot;You are wrong!&quot; Phobia let loose with a powerful wave of energy\nblasts, designed destabilize ones fear centers. &quot;FEAR ME!&quot;\n\nThe blast hit the newcommer, the one revealed as Legacy near dead\ncenter, and he didn&#39;t slow. &quot;FEAR IS IRRELIVENT. YOU ARE AN ABNORMALITY\nAND YOU WILL BE TERMINATED!&quot; The cold and relentless voice spoke from\nbelow. \n\nCannon blasts from Legacy drove Phobia to look for cover as they came\ndangerously close to shering off her shoulders!\n\nOOC: I am not sure what Darkfate or Nightstrike are doing, so I\ncouldn&#39;t post a response to them. \n\nOOC: Also I am sure if the Maxi&#39;s are approaching they should clearly\nbe able to see the battle. Deepstryke&#39;s down, Phobia&#39;s protecting him,\nTumult and Decibel is in the thick of fighting a black and red\nfuturistic hover tank of good size. I will be posting him soon on the\nwiki site. \n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion & Legacy)\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
