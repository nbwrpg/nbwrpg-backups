In a timid voice,&quot;You will send others \nwith me to retrieve your friend?&quot;  She looked down and thought about \nthis.  She would have the protection she would need incase of \ntrouble.  And the other bots would help with the bots if they were \nfound in stasis lock.\n\nShe looked back up at Iron Raptor, &quot;If he isn&#39;t in stasis, he won&#39;t \nattack will he?&quot;  She stayed still and looked at the holoprojector.\nShe saw Dinobot as a big male and a possable threat to her.\n\nShe turned and looked at Prowl and shrank back in her seat.  She \nwrapped her tail around her waist and looked down.  \n\n&quot;I&#39;ll go and do as you wish.  I&#39;ll go and bring back your friends.&quot;  \nShe shook a little in her seat.  &quot;Who...who will you send me with?&quot;\nstill showing fear and uneasiness.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor didn&#39;t like the way this was going at the moment, too \nmuch \n&gt; fear and uncertenty un the room.\n&gt; But at least it seemed as if Feline had relaxed a bit...until Iron \nRaptor \n&gt; mentioned the rearch mission.\n&gt; Feline had walked towards the holo-projector and looked at the \nimaged \n&gt; desplayed on it, basically of both of the bots whos signatures had \nstopped \n&gt; in Grid 16.\n&gt; It was a little hard not to notice that the fembot almost seemed to \nshow a \n&gt; little fear towards one of the projections in particular, the \nbiggest and \n&gt; most deadly of the two. Dinobot.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed and rubbed the back of her head for a moment.\n&gt; Now, THERE was a bot with an attetude that could cause Feline a few \n&gt; problems.\n&gt; He was big, powerful and mean. Three things that Feline might not \nbe able to \n&gt; handle. And if she was lucky, she might get a full sentance out of \nhim that \n&gt; doesn&#39;t end with a threat.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed again. But he was dependable and vary loyal. She \nguessed \n&gt; that for those his attetude was worth putting up with.\n&gt; But it was then that Feline seemed to regain her fear again at the \nmention \n&gt; of the Alliance, something that could also become a prob.\n&gt; Iron Raptor watched Feline sit and shake a bit, walking over to the \ntable \n&gt; and sitting on it beside her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I wasn&#39;t planning to send you out alone. That would just be \nstupid to \n&gt; start with. You&#39;d have a pertner or two, whatever was needed. If \nDinobot&#39;s \n&gt; in stasis lock you&#39;ll need two bots to carry him alone.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then looked at the holo-image of the Transmetal 2.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And the Alliance isn&#39;t what you have to worry about, they&#39;re too \nfar away \n&gt; to even bother with you once you got there. Dinobot&#39;s your main \nproblem if \n&gt; he&#39;s still online.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor steadied her seat on the table and crossed her legs, \ngetting a \n&gt; little more comfortable. Motioning for Prowl to come over there \nwith them so \n&gt; that he didn&#39;t seem so alien to Feline any longer.\n&gt; She then looked at Feline agains to see her reaction, then back at \nthe \n&gt; projaction.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I can tell you right now, he&#39;ll reject any help and you&#39;ll \nprobably be met \n&gt; with a pair of Transmetal 2 jaws since he doesn&#39;t know you. And I \ncan bet my \n&gt; position as command that he won&#39;t trust you right off the back \neither.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor then smiled down at Feline.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; But I can garontee one thing, treat him with respect and he&#39;ll do \nthe same \n&gt; for you.&quot; * she then chuckled.* &quot; How else do you think I manage to \nlive \n&gt; with him?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then looked at the projection and then back at Feline.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; But I&#39;ll send a few bots with you for protection, just in case. \nAlso to \n&gt; carry a bit of equipment, knowing that Dinobot will definitly be \n&gt; damaged...you&#39;ll need it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor then leaned back on her hands and looked up at the \ncieling, \n&gt; trying to think quickly of just who she could send with Feline.\n&gt; A thoughtful growl sounded from her throat as her mind worked, but \nthe truth \n&gt; was...she didn&#39;t know just who was free and willing to do it. She \nmostly had \n&gt; to think of a few bots that could handle Dinobot&#39;d aggression and \nnot snapp \n&gt; back at him in return, that would only make things worse. \nEspecially if he \n&gt; was injured.\n&gt; Iron Raptor then looked over at Prowl, a little expression on her \nface \n&gt; saying that she couldn&#39;t really think of any.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Prowl? Any...suggentions of who we can send with Feline.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
