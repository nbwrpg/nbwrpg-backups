YOU ARE BACK!!! I MISSED YOU SOO MUCH!!&quot;said a childish voice,\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight Huged tightly her daughter and and tears of happines started \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; appear.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;My Elita... My sweet daughter...&quot;whispered Nighlight with a smile\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I was really Impattient to see you mom; I really... Really missed you&quot;\n&gt; &gt; said\n&gt; &gt; ELita with a wide Smile &quot;But my dad and Perceptor...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;WHAT????&quot; said shocked Nighlight while she watched Rodimus\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oppssi&quot; said Elita while she lowed her ears\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; RODIMUS had been smiling broadly as ELITA and NIGHTLIGHT were being\n&gt; reunited. He had even leaned back a little to allow the two to hug and\n&gt; show affection. That is until ELITA&#39;s last statement and he could see\n&gt; the look on NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s face.\n&gt;\n&gt; Smiling warmly and nodding RODIMUS took NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s hand. &quot;Yes,\n&gt; Perceptor has been instrumental in your recovery.&quot; Leaning back in he\n&gt; continued to smile at her, hoping to wipe away her fears if he could.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;From what we can tell, Perceptor has joined the Maximals.&quot; RODIMUS\n&gt; rubbed ELITA&#39;s head giving her reassurance and affection as well.\n&gt; &quot;Just like our daughter here has said.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ******************************************\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor walked close to  Lord Elder and shook his head  and said &quot;It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; highly unlikely that that happens &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside, Uproar catches up to Lord Elder, as he observes the private \n&gt; &gt; code\n&gt; &gt; on  Tuscons door.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Wow, so, I guess Tucson and Talon are kinda gonna be like Rodimus and\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight.  I wonder if Tucson will ya know..  Have a family of his own\n&gt; &gt; some day?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ELDER looked away from the door, his optics reddening slightly. If he\n&gt; were human it might even seem like a blush. &quot;Who can say Uproar, who\n&gt; can say? I would imagine that that is something that we may all want\n&gt; to do at some point.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; TORCA and NOCTORRO walked with ELDER as well, their large forms\n&gt; swaying as they walked, the sound of their footsteps large and heavy\n&gt; as their metal booted feet hit the deck plating.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We still must talk.&quot; TORCA said looking at ELDER, his tone somber and\n&gt; resigned. NOCTORRO was tapping out a small message as they talked, but\n&gt; he looked up and nodded in agreement as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; ELDER nodded as he glanced at TORCA and then at the others. &quot;Uproar,\n&gt; why don&#39;t you show Perceptor around the base and help him get settled\n&gt; in, I would imagine he will need to find some quarters and perhaps a\n&gt; recharging chamber coded to his requirements.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ******************************************\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Moving to Legacy&#39;s quarters, Straight Shot thinks for a moment before\n&gt; &gt; saying anything, which was her best of traits.  Once she had an idea of\n&gt; &gt; what she wanted to say, she looks up to Legacy, with an air of sincerity\n&gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; always had for everyone, including her brother.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Thanks, for letting me talk to you, I appreciate it.  I just wanted ta\n&gt; &gt; let\n&gt; &gt; ya know that I think my brother doesn&#39;t quite understand where you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; coming from and maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s so critical of your actions.  He&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; always been like that, not just around you, but with me too, and yeah,\n&gt; &gt; sometimes it gets on my nerves.  But with things as they are, and what\n&gt; &gt; happened ta him in the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s put up such a\n&gt; &gt; defense\n&gt; &gt; and why he&#39;s so determined ta think off the pavement.  And maybe that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; why\n&gt; &gt; his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed with mine too, at \n&gt; &gt; times.\n&gt; &gt; Honestly though, how do you feel about his thinking outside the box?  Is\n&gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; a reason why you&#39;d rather not go that way?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; For a moment LEGACY looked confused, his single crimson optic boring\n&gt; into STRAIGHT SHOT as his mind ran over what she said.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I do not understand all of the colloquialisms than you have\n&gt; utilized.&quot; He said at last, &quot;But I ascertain that you are attempting\n&gt; to explain your sibling&#39;s actions to me and inquiring as to why I will\n&gt; not allow Tuscon to disturb Optimus Prime&#39;s chassis.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; LEGACY&#39;s optic flickered for a moment. &quot;I appreciate your intent.&quot; He\n&gt; said his words clear and well articulated. &quot;But I do not require an\n&gt; explanation, since I have taken no offense to his actions; to do so\n&gt; would be an inefficient use of my time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;However to answer your question I will replay something for you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Turning to the screen that was standing behind LEGACY he fired a beam\n&gt; of energy at it. But instead of it exploding into shards of glass and\n&gt; debris it simply changed to show a mountainous scene, a volcano, and\n&gt; then the volcano exploding to reveal the Ark. It was obvious from the\n&gt; motion that the events were being speeded up for ease of viewing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Soon after it happened a small satellite like device rose up from the\n&gt; Ark and began to travel away from it and after a while return. After\n&gt; another short moment, short because of the speeded up play back,\n&gt; MEGATRON flew out along with STARSCREAM, SOUNDWAVE and a few other\n&gt; Decepticon seekers, obviously having been repaired by the device. They\n&gt; all land on a cliff and look back at the Ark, and STARSCREAM fires a\n&gt; blast at the Ark and they all fly off.\n&gt;\n&gt; Inside the Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMUS PRIME is\n&gt; also is knocked into the beam and his repair process begins.\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: This is the scene from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the bots and\n&gt; cons fell to earth and 4 million years had passed.)\n&gt;\n&gt; The scene fades to black.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;These sequence of cannot be disrupted.&quot; LEGACY intoned coldly.\n&gt; &quot;Without the Autobots none of you would be here.&quot; LEGACY turned back\n&gt; to face STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;And without the Decepticon&#39;s attack on the Ark\n&gt; the Autobots will not survive.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; LEGACY folded his arms behind his back, &quot;There can be no disruption of\n&gt; the time flow.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a small beep on LEGACY&#39;s panel causing him to look over at\n&gt; it. &quot;Interesting.&quot; He said curiously. &quot;It would seem that I am\n&gt; required on the bridge.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
