Suddenly a voice comes from the Matrix.\n\nMatrix:  Cutie it is time to become one great warrior.\n\nCutie: NO I NEED MORE TIME!  IT CAN&#39;T END LIKE THIS! I CAN&#39;T LOOSE TO \nMY FINAL OPPONENT!  THE MARK OF A TRUELY GREAT WARRIOR IS NOT HOW MANY \nBATTLES HE HAS WON, BUT DID HE WIN HIS FINAL ONE AND I DID NOT!  I \nMUST DEFEAT THE EVIL BOT!\n\nMatrix:  Cutie you cannot do more than you can.  You must join now.\n\nTentacles of light reach out for him, but Cutie begins to fight.  \nSomehow he pulls the fog and it begins to swirl around his spark (his \npsyical body isn&#39;t here like before) and get pulled in like a \nwhirlpool.\n\n\n"}}
