All lights are green and\neverything is showing in full readiness. The shield is also showing no\nproblem. Its integrity is holding at 100% with only nominal\nfluctuations. There are no recorded breaches, and all appears normal.\n\nAs the grey dot appears its position is sporadic and mobile, however\nit never appears on the inside of the shield, only the outside. As the\ncomputer monitors its position it appears to be following Tuscon and\nLord Elder, although it never gets too close to them.\n\nThen, almost as if what ever it is becomes aware of the sudden\nscrutiny from the Ark&#39;s sensors, the dot suddenly disappears from all\nsensors.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
