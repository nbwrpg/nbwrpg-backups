Soft Style: Means Koj kept to focusing on the mind and \nless on the muscle power to learned skills. Hard Style means Koj used the \nstyle to aquire raw muscle power like the Eagle Claw I used to break \nPrebon&#39;s sword is a hard style move. Lai Tai strike the Kendo swing that \ncreate a enegry blast is soft style. Rookies point of view maybe wrong!!!!\n\n::Koj::\n&quot;Huh!?&quot;\n\n::Inu-Yasha::\n&quot;What I mean is people always give up things for people they love a person \nmay even risk there life for another a person like that would care nothing \nfor himself and gives up everything for anothers well being normally this \ncaused by love for a lover or a parent or a friend what do you think Koj?&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
