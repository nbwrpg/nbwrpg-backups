The=\r\n exchange of energy was mysteriously not taxing on Tucson as it would have =\r\nbeen if he had transfered his own spark energy into his chest.  This was a =\r\npower that was saved for many years in the hopes that one day, it&#39;s energy =\r\nwould be needed for a greater purpose.  This was that day.  And as Vestige =\r\ncame alive, his heart felt all the more energized as it filled endlessly wi=\r\nth the joy of hope he had for his new friend.  \n\n&quot; I hope never to lose you=\r\n my friend, you&#39;ve helped me in more ways than I can describe.  You&#39;ve give=\r\nn me new found hope that adversity can be overcome, and now I pass on that =\r\npower of hope to you.  We can do this, we will awaken Rodimus and through o=\r\nur compassion for each other, we may just be able to exterminate this enemy=\r\n for good.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Vestige lay inside of Tuscon all but inert, his energy pul=\r\nse at an\n&gt; extremely low level. His optics are dim his mouth hangs open and=\r\n\n&gt; slack. It is as if his spark has been snuffed out, erradicated. Then\n&gt; T=\r\nuscon connected to him by port and flooded him with energies!\n&gt; \n&gt; Vestige&#39;=\r\ns optics brightened as his whole body began to glow while\n&gt; inside the cab,=\r\n much like the glow that Tuscon himself was radiating\n&gt; in the other world.=\r\n However where Tuscon&#39;s was a soft glow, this one\n&gt; was like a cleansing fi=\r\nre, one that rushed out from Vestige&#39;s chest\n&gt; and optics and erupted explo=\r\nsively into the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; The larger female insectoid that had been approa=\r\nching Tuscon was\n&gt; knocked back and sent sprawling across the room, the oth=\r\ner female\n&gt; insectoids two hissed in anger and looked over at Tuscon. Howev=\r\ner\n&gt; thier anger quickly became fear as the tendrils that had been holding\n=\r\n&gt; Tuscon at bay were suddenly burnt away.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside Tuscon&#39;s cab Vesige s=\r\nmiled as he sat up, looking as if many\n&gt; years had been taken from his fram=\r\ne. If he looked old and decrepid\n&gt; before, now he was looking much younger,=\r\n more vibrant as he sat up\n&gt; properly in Tuscon&#39;s chair, the reds and yello=\r\nws of his armor\n&gt; reflecting the fiery light from the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile =\r\nthe two humanoid insectoids shifted into a spider/scorpion\n&gt; mode and began=\r\n to rush at Tuscon, even as behind them the figure on\n&gt; the bed began to st=\r\nir and shift.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
