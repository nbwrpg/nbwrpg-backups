He had often thought=\r\n of what it\n&gt; would be like to pad around on four feet rather than roll on =\r\nfour wheels.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Funny you should mention that Ramulus, I kinda wondered w=\r\nhat my life would\n&gt; be like if I did trade in the vehicle alt form for a be=\r\nast form..  If I\n&gt; could, it would probably be some sorta feline, same colo=\r\nr, ellusive, quiet\n&gt; on the paws...  Oh yeah, that would be my choice if it=\r\n was available.  But\n&gt; actually I kinda like what I got now.  Sure, it&#39;s a =\r\npain in the tail pipe\n&gt; when I break down but, it does get me around from p=\r\noint A ta point B in a\n&gt; good amount of time.  And rolln&#39; on wheels is alot=\r\n easier than walkn&#39;,\n&gt; that&#39;s for sure.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRAMULUS nodded as he looke=\r\nd around the cave and then back at NIGHT\nSHIFT. =93I am sure that one of th=\r\ne medics can be talked into setting\nyou. Wheels are next to useless on this=\r\n rugged terrain.=94 He shrugged,\n=93But then again I have been trying to ta=\r\nlk Rodimus into it for a while\nnow. He said he thought about being a bat. I=\r\n almost had him into it,\nbut he changed his mind.=94\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks =\r\noutside the cave.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s when I can walk.  I&#39;m really gonna slow ya d=\r\nown Ramulus.  I hate\n&gt; don&#39; that ta ya.&quot;\n\nThere was a smile as RAMULUS turn=\r\ned to look back at NIGHT SHIFT,\n=93Don=92t worry about it. It sounds like t=\r\nhe rain is beginning to let up.\nWe should hopefully be able to leave soon.=\r\n=94\n\nEven as RAMULUS spoke the sound of the rain fall was slacking up,\nturn=\r\ning slowly from a down pour and becoming more of a drizzle. There\nwas even =\r\nthe sound of a bird or two from outside, sure signs of coming\nbetter weathe=\r\nr.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
