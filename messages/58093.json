Sorry I didn&#39;t post recently, but it&#39;s been one hell of \na \n&gt; week. I&#39;m already overwhelmed by homeworks! I&#39;m also afraid things \n\n\n&gt; won&#39;t get better till the start of November. This means that I&#39;ll \ntry \n&gt; posting as often as I can, but that these post will be few and not \nas \n&gt; often as I would like. To make things a little better, I&#39;ll lend \nmy \n&gt; chars to those who would like them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael, though, goes to Airly if she wants it. If not, then Robo \ngets \n&gt; him. And if Robo can&#39;t, well, just make a contest! =P\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like Azure to go to Jeff.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for Yggdrasil, Dreadplague, Clawstorm and Blackfang, share them \n&gt; among yourselves or tell me if you won&#39;t use them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Nic\n\n\n"}}
