Yes, they were built invisible, or at\n&gt; least heavily resistant to scanners.  While he could not say how resistant a\n&gt; proper Maximal would register her, as his sensors were woefully minimal, he\n&gt; could at least tell she was built that way.  Wondering just why someone\n&gt; would make an army of such robots and then let them get away.\n&gt;\n&gt; The chillig thing he could think of is that investing so much effort in and\n&gt; then letting them escape without pursuing them..  Had whomever made them\n&gt; wanted this or permitted it to happen?\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE sat back as he finally decided he could only go in. Heading back\n&gt; over then indoors as he went towards the chamber where RODIMUS was being\n&gt; treated.\n\nOOC: Actually it was the sun doing a slow fade into night, IE it is\nsetting and the night is coming. :)\n\n&lt;BACK IN CHARACTER&gt;\n\nThere was a slight shrug from ASTRA as she watched WHEELIE disappear\ndown the steps and back inside the structure itself. With a look\naround, satisfying herself that she was indeed alone, she layed down,\nfolding her arms back behind her head and just watched the skies as\nthe sky continued darkness on its way towards night.\n\nMeanwhile the way for WHEELIE was largely unimpeeded. The guards\nstanding at the door nodded to him as he entered. The large room was\nnearly empty now, evidently UNUS was elsewhere at the moment. A few\nfigures turned and glanced at WHEELIE as he made his way through, but\nnone of them paid him much attention.\n\nMoving through the next doors he came back to the room that housed\nRODIMUS, one of the nursing staff exiting the room as WHEELIE walked\nup, she turned to look at WHEELIE, &quot;Your friend is doing quite well.&quot;\nShe said. &quot;Since he has awakened and the major repair work completed\nhis healing process has been going rather fast.&quot;\n\nThe nurse gestured at the door. &quot;We have him on an energon infusion\nnow, keeping his self repair circuits rarified and powered up. But he\nmay be looking for a visitor or two now.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
