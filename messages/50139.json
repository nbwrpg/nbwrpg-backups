He growls \nsoftly, as he taps his fingers impatiently. Where was Switchblade? \nThat miserable infidel would come to know just how much pain he \ncould suffer for such an slight upon his mighty self.\n\nWrath. Megatron chuckles to himself, &quot;Feel my wrath.&quot; The Pred \nleader waits for Switchblade to arrive; he was suspiciously late, \nbut Megatron knew he would show up.\n\n----------------------------\n\nSwitchblade&#39;s eyes are raised when Destructor asks him politely to \ngo to the control room. &quot;Politeness... out of a Predacon... are you \nsure that you are thinkin straight?&quot; He looks up at the bigger \nbot. &quot;Besides, there&#39;s no point in being polite, Megatron is \ndefinately going to give me a warm welcome when I arrive at the \ncontrol room.&quot; A sarcastic lilt appears in his voice as he nears the \nend of his last words. Unbeknownst to the Predacons present, \nSwitchblade was talking to cover up his fear, and to delay for some \ntime.\n\n&quot;Blah blah blah Perceptor, until I hear something worth listening \ntoo from your sorry mouth,&quot; grumbles the smaller bot, as he starts \nthe painfully long journey to the control room. He brushes past \nDestructor as he leaves the room.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nSwitchblade walks quietly down the corridor of the Pred ship, \nsorting out his thoughs, and deciding how he would play out the \nincident. Megatron was obviously unhappy, and would likely do \nsomething... damaging... to Switchblade. Though, if planned \nproperly, he figures that he should be able to worm his way out of \ndisfavour. &lt;I&#39;ll have to access the security cameras in the storage \nbay... they will show something interesting, probably enough to free \nme from an untimely demise.&gt;\n\nHe rounds the corner, and poks his head into the room. He is \nimmediately noticed by Megatron, who without looking at him, bekons \nfor him to enter.\n\nSwitchblade sighs inwardly, and enters. He strols nochalantly across \nthe room, and sits himself down in one of the control room chairs, \nthen looks over at the Pred leader.\n\nMegatron smiles, showing teeth, and making no effort to mask his \nirritation. &quot;Switchblade... It seems you have a problem.&quot;\n\n&quot;Heh, I thought that you might have something to say... would this \nperhaps be about the little incident with the artifa--&quot; Switchblade \nis cut off by Megatron.\n\n&quot;Yes...&quot; says Megatron as his eyes narrow, &quot;You were supposed to \ndetermine the usefullness of the artifacts, then take them \noutside... What happened?&quot; Demands the Pred leader.\n\n&quot;Well...&quot; mumbles Switchblade, &quot;I&#39;m, err, not 100% sure on that one. \nYou see, I was looking at the pieces, and trying to put them \ntogether. Quite accidentally, I managed to fit them together. About \nthat time, I suddenly blanked out, and woke up to find myself on the \nground, artifact in hand, and a impressively large slashed hole in \nthe side of the storage bay wall, looks like it might have been \nmelted.&quot; He finishes sheepishly, &quot;Lets check the security vids.&quot; \nbefore Megatron can say something that might decide his fate.\n\nSwitchblade hops up, and walks over to the security panel. His \nfingers blur as he types and presses buttons on the console. A holo \ndisplay appears in the middle of the room, and starts to play a \nrecording of the storage bay incident.\n\nIt comes to the part when Switchblade blacked out, and Megatron \nwatches the holo Switchblade go totally limp, and them raise the \nartifact over his head. Well, it was more like the artifact raised \nSwitchblade. Then a bright light speared outward from the artifact, \ndestroying the overloading the camera optics, effectively disabling \nthat camera it gets repaired.\n\nSwitchblade smiles triuphantly to himself, knowing that he&#39;s all but \nproved that he wasn&#39;t going against Megatron...\n\nTurning back to Megatron, he is about ot say something, shen his jaw \ndrops, as he finds himself looking into the large barrel of \nMegatron&#39;s plasma cannon. &quot;Uhh...&quot; &lt;I guess I did still screw up...&gt;\n\nMegatron smiles taking the thoughts from Switchblade&#39;s mind, &quot;You \nstill screwed up, and must pay the prices.&quot; He fires the cannon at \nthe minibot. The results are devastating... for Switchblade. He \nloses his right arm, leg, and his head immediately, and there is \nsignificant damage to his body as the blast smashes it against the \nfar wall.\n\n&quot;Fool...&quot; says Megatron to himself as he opens a commlink to \nInferno, &quot;Inferno, get over here into the control room, and clean up \nthis mess... Perceptor, begin repairs in the storage bay.\n\nHe walks over to Switchblade&#39;s destroyed form, and picks up the \nsingle pieces of artifact. &quot;This doesn&#39;t look like the thing in the \nsecurity vid... maybe I should have let him live for a bit longer...&quot;\n\n\n"}}
