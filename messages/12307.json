If Kitkat decided to bail, she was going to do it in\n&gt; peices.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Aracnia listened to Darkmouse and nodded. The Medical drone entered,\n&gt; saluted, and began to run its programmed diagnostic on her. Aracnia would\n&gt; later open the gym up for the mouse, it would allow her to warm her body\nup\n&gt; for a battle if needed.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
