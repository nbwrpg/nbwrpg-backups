I was just going with my own storylines, I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; trying\n&gt; &gt; to make everyone cease fire or anything like that.

Understand\n&gt; now?\n&gt; &gt; Deemos taking Technosis captive didn&#39;t insure a victory for the\n&gt; CHosen Ones,\n&gt; &gt; he just wanted to leave there with Technosis, no problem. If the\n&gt; Alliance\n&gt; &gt; left with Chordate, would there be a problem with that? If so, then\n&gt; we have\n&gt; &gt; the hostage crisis all over again, except that unitron will\n&gt; probably fool\n&gt; &gt; everyone into going to the Alliance base and stuff to kill them\n&gt; all. And if\n&gt; &gt; there wouldn&#39;t be a problem. Well, Chordate will die.
