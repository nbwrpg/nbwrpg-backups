With a tenacity that surprised them, the Autobot filled with the room with smoke, using only his tires, the power of his engines and the ambient dust on the floor. \n\n&quot;He don&#39;t know when to quit!&quot; Rodimus said as he watched the ruckus, trying to target the Autobot through the smoke. \n\n&quot;He is an Autobot.&quot; said Cyclonus as he turned to fire on the fleeing Tuscon\n\n&quot;Scrap!&quot; Scourge fretted as the smoke interfeared with his sensors. \n\nIt took a moment for thier optics and sensors to adjust, and by then the Autobot was already on the move. Even as Tuscon ran down on fuel the trio was in pursuit. \n\n&gt;&gt;&quot;N - Night - Nightlight.. . Here....&quot; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Tuscon&#39;s engine shuts \n&gt;&gt;down. Clearly there was not enough energy to make his escape, and he had not the \n&gt;&gt;heart to leave a comrade behind. No matter if it were a Maximal or an Autobot. \n&gt;&gt;His headlights dim, as his body now goes off line due to energy \n&gt;&gt;exhaustion.\n\nAs Tuscon ran out of power and came to a stop, a door slid open. &quot;Yes Autobot, she is here, as are others.&quot; said a voice from the shadowed interior of the room, &quot;and now so are you.&quot;\n \n&gt;Darkhawk took one  of his Feather \n&gt;missiles and ran towards Tucson and he Used a stunned gun againts Him, then \n&gt;manually starting to transformn Him to his Robot mode and once he was in \n&gt;his robot mode he tied him thignly. \n\nAs Darkhawk finished his work, a figure moved from the room, the ambient light finally piercing the shadows as it stepped into the hall to reveal the form of the head master unit called Zarak.\n\nHe casually stepped forward and leaned over the depowered and now stunned form of Tuscon, &quot;We have use for one like you.&quot; He ran a scanner over Tuscon&#39;s frame &quot;Yes, one so like the old Prime.&quot;\n\n&quot;You see it don&#39;t you Autobot?&quot; Zarak said, speaking to the inert form of Tuscon. &quot;Our scanners also revealed something else.&quot; Zarak straightened as he changed the feed of his scanner to link with the base scanners, &quot;There is a minion floating over the old Maximal base, quite possibly attacking it.&quot;\n\nZarak chuckled, &quot;With it there, all your Autobot and Maximal friends are no doubt rushing to get there to defend that pitiful piece of technology, possibly even some of the ones defending the ark.&quot; Zarak&#39;s optics widened in mock surprise, &quot;I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t get the call.&quot;\n\nZarak smiled again, mockingly, derisively, &quot;And now we have you, so much like the old Prime and we have a lightly defended Ark and a Matrix waiting for us to plunder.&quot;\n\n&quot;MWHAHAHAHAaaa!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, we have a use for him.&quot; Zarak said as he turned to look at Darkhawk, &quot;Bring him to my battle station, we have a treasure that awaits us!&quot;\n\nOOC: I am assuming that Tuscon is indeed knocked out. Please keep in mind Zarak is scanning Tuscon quite carefully, so playing possum will be difficult. \n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus/Zarak)\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
