The enraged bull \nfigured these\n&gt; were warning shots since nobody could be that bad a shot. He slammed \non the\n&gt; breaks stopping immediately.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blaze finally caught up to where Drillbit was at, She had to warn \nthe other\n&gt; bot that Bullet stopping wasn&#39;t a good thing. &quot;You might want to \nstart\n&gt; running.&quot;She suggested,  &quot;Bullet isn&#39;t going to stop just because \nyou say\n&gt; so.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The bull turned around this time looking at Drillbit and Blaze, he \nlowered\n&gt; his head, stomped a few times, snorted and began another charge. In \nhis\n&gt; enraged state he didn&#39;t feel pain but he&#39;d have problems when the \nadrenaline\n&gt; wore off.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 23, 2001 4:22 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Intruders/Chamaleon/ALARM IN BLACKFORTRESS\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He got behind Bullet, as he chased Chameleon.
