Bullet checked the computer for Chameleons location. &quot;Why\nam I not surprised?&quot; he thought when he found that the bot he was to\nprotect was right in the middle of the action. He transformed to bull\nand rushed through the halls toward the disturbance hoping the doors\nto that level hadn&#39;t blocked it off to protect the rest of the ship.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: airly2000@y...\n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt;   Sent: Friday, May 11, 2001 10:03 AM\n&gt;   Subject: BlackFortres...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Chamaleon/ScorPyo/Thyphon/Elecktra:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Scorpyo continue whinning that he liked to help Chaemlon., and he\nshouted &quot;Scorpyo LIKES&quot; and shot against a container that have a\ndangerous virus in gas. &gt;\n&gt;   CHamaleon ran out side the lab and closed the door, leaving\nScorpyo inside.  CHamelon looked horrified that gas was leaving the\nlab and and the airtight doors started to close, in area 2.
