She grinned.  \n&gt; Then she pressed another button on the side of the head piece, that \n&gt; switched the voice control over to taking orders. &quot;Megatron, raise \n&gt; your head and roar.&quot;  The clone did as it was told.  She was very \n&gt; impressed with herself. She ordered the clone to stay in the lab \nand \n&gt; stay in a restinf possition untill needed.  She walked out of the \n&gt; lab, still with the headset on and walked to the bridge.  She \nopened \n&gt; up her link to Destructor. &quot;General Destructor, please report your \n&gt; situation. Famine is here and getting the supplies you have \n&gt; requested.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
