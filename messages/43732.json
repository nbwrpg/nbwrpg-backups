The score \nis \n&gt; &gt; 106 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Ballers =\r\nand 102 for the Gorrilaz.  The story so far has \n&gt; been \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; play by Gorzo.  Gorzo, A rookie from Crystal University is \n30 \n&gt; &gt; for =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 34 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shots made.  10 3-pointers and 15 dunks for a total of=\r\n 50 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; points.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But can the last rank Gorrilaz with the help=\r\n of Gorzo beat \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rank Ballers?  Lets go down to =\r\nthe court to see what \nhappens. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Court Side Announ=\r\ncer:  Hello, we have 20 secounds left in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; game. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; The Gorrilaz are passing in the ball as we speak.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n A bot wearing a jersey that says &quot;Bentals&quot; passes the ball \nin \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bot wearing a jersey thats says &quot;Gorzo&quot;.  Gorzo Dribbles the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; ball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down the court and passes it to a bot with a jersey t=\r\nhat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; says &quot;Bob&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bob then passes it to Bentals a=\r\nnd Bentals passes it a bot \nwith \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jersey that says &quot;Mi=\r\ncko&quot;.  Micko passes the ball to Bentals \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bentals passes it=\r\n to Gorzo.  Gorzo steps up to the 3-point \n&gt; line \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jum=\r\nps up making it look like a jump shot.  At the last \nsecond \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; passes it to a jumping bot, which is by the goal, whose \njersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; reads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned then slams the ball for an Alley-op(SP?). \n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bot=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a different jersey grab the ball.  The bots jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Reads &quot;Feller&quot;.  Feller passes the ball in to a bot with a \n&gt; &gt; jersey=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which read &quot;Rauq&quot;.  (Time to make Rauq look Stupid.)  Rauq \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n starts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dribbiling the ball down court when he trips over his ow=\r\nn \n&gt; feet. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ball leaves his hands and rolls into=\r\n Gorzo hands.  Gorzo, \nwho \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standing behind the 3-point lin=\r\ne and takes a jump shot.  The \n&gt; &gt; ball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sails into the hoop as t=\r\nhe Buzzers sounds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Court Side Announcer:  HOLY RUST PO=\r\nCKET, THE GORRILAZ WIN \n107-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 106.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; THE GORRILAZ WIN!!!\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;5 Years Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Bot that was=\r\n wearing the Gorzo jersey 5 years earlier \nwas \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sm=\r\nall 2 person shuttle.
