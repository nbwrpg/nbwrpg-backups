Friends or \nfoes?\n\nShe hid, it was her best option by now.

His optics\n&gt; brightened and then dimmed as the news and comments came over the\n&gt; transmission lines. As grim as the words were, they did not daunt the\n&gt; figure he cut as he was standing tall once again.\n&gt;\n&gt; Opening the communication lines he began to speak, &quot;I know that many\n&gt; of you have no reason to trust me.&quot; he said, his voice confident and\n&gt; yet somehow humble at the same time. &quot;Much time has passed and I have\n&gt; done a great many things.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus frowned as his face saddened, but continued talking, &quot;The\n&gt; unfortunate thing is that I remember each hateful thing as I did as\n&gt; one of Hydras&#39; lacky. I can only tell you that I am no longer that\n&gt; person. The power that Hydras had over me is broken, and I will spend\n&gt; each day and night trying to make it up to each and everyone of you,\n&gt; and making Hydras pay for everything he has done not only to me but\n&gt; this planet and you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I will see you soon my friends.&quot; Rodimus said as he shifted into his\n&gt; vehicular mode, that grounding of gears echoing through the room.\n&gt; &quot;First I have to find my wife!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; light flickered to life as brought all his weaponry online,\n&gt; &quot;You are welcome to accompany me if you like.&quot; he called out to Kup\n&gt; hopefully. &quot;I would be most greatful.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With a rev of his engines Rodimus fired his motor, &quot;NIGHTLIGHT! I AM\n&gt; COMMING!&quot; Rodimus called out, hoping she would hear him over the noise\n&gt; and alarms. Hoping against hope that she had her radio Rodimus sent\n&gt; her a mesage as well, telling her where he was!\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
