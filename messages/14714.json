Paralysis looked \naround for Quickstrike and Darkmouse...\n\n    Megatron had had enoughof carrying the wasp and threw him into the mud. \nHe left his troops to die to save himself, a noble act according to him. A \nwise tyrant always ensures his complete survival in any situation. It was \nonly a matter of time before something like this happened.\n    &quot;Argh! Get up Waspinator!&quot; He yelled transforming into his beast mode. \nHis red eyes scanned the area. It was clear. Besides, who else would be out \nin the middle of the swamps?\n    Waspinator reattached his head and stood up a little wobbly, but cought \nhimself. He too transformed and wondered what happened while he was in stasis.\n    &quot;Megatron, where is Wolfbot and Terrorsaur?&quot; He said looking around, and \nthen buzzed up and down.\n    Megatron frowned. &quot;We left them. But thats not important now. For right \nnow we need to find a shelter....and I have just the place in mind...&quot; He \nsaid looking up to see the artic mountians to the north.\n\n"}}
