I know that the maximals \nare our enemies. But Destructor strongly feels the need to help them. \nSO, I shall go alone.  They may prove usefull. For instance, we might \nget them to assist us in tracking and killing Megatron. But for now, \nwe shall play along.&quot;\n\n\n::Battera::\nShe looked at Vulois, now very nervous.  He didn&#39;t know her or \nremember the past that they shared.  &quot;You came here following me? \nDon&#39;t you remember?  We both serve the allience. I am your superior, \nwell, kind of. Look, I left the base, then you followed me herer for \nanswers on your past.&quot;  She looked at him,&quot;Please....please put the \ngun down.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thank You KitKat. I shall treasure this honour.&quot; He liked the ring \n&gt; of his new title: War General Starscream. It wasn&#39;t as good as \n&gt; Emperor, but it was good. He was about to leave, when KitKat asked \n&gt; him a question.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Temporal Rift? I&#39;ve never heard of it here, but it could be \n&gt; possible. Do you mean Phobia is alive? But why would you want to \n&gt; bring him back? Wasn&#39;t he a trator?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream also pondered a messages she got from Destructor.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Why would we want the Maximals as allies? It wasn&#39;t all Maximals \nwho \n&gt; put us in this predicament. It was the Maximals fault too. I \nthought \n&gt; we were going to destroy them when we defeated Megatron?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois again looked puzzled.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Mind what? What arew you talking about? I am Vulois, Alliance \n&gt; Warrior. Always have been, always will be. Again, why have you \n&gt; brought me here?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Tamron and Savage went ut of range of the Maximals. They seperated \n&gt; and watched the battle in cloak.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sir, what about Slayer?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;He&#39;s a warrior. He loves to fight. He will come eventually. Leave \n&gt; him for now. He&#39;s winning. But our job is to wait until they \ncontact \n&gt; the other Maximal base, and we can track it down. That is where \n&gt; Spears will be.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; They waited for the transmission. All except for Ignatius, who was \n&gt; working on a quicker way.........\n\n\n"}}
