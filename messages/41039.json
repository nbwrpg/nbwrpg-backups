You did a much better job with Mustex than I did \nwith Megaton but I&#39;ll take it from here so far as Mustex is \nconcerned. Just one small change. He can&#39;t fly so he would have \ngotten his hover-cycle and followed on it. After all he&#39;s a Mustang \nnot a bird.\n\n Upon arriving Mustex wasted no time finding Veratis.\nMustex:O.K. I&#39;m just going to lay my cards on the table. Some how my \nson...Yes you heard me right I refer to him as that... started as a \nbaby and is developing the same way humans do. I recently aquired \nthis.\n He holds up the book.\nMustex:It tell how to polarize energy. As you know there would be 3 \nadvantages to that:\n1.Polarizing enrgy is the process of making sparks instead of waiting \nfor...(I don&#39;t know what they do on Cybertron but I doubt they come \noff an assembly line)\n2.Appling this to D.N.A. could eventually let you make your own beast \nmodes as you go along istead of throwing diffent kinds of D.N.A. \ntogether or getting it straight from the source.\n3.This could in a few years lead to an invincible bot(and we&#39;ll need \nthat long to figue out a catch so he won&#39;t be that effective a \nfighter.\n All you have to do is figure out what it was. The effects over time \nhave actually been quite positive. I&#39;m sure you could use this kind \nof knowledge. Besides eventually you&#39;re going to run out of \nprotoforms, and I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re almost out of anything but nulls \nalready.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ice and Mustex reach the rendevous point where the others are \nwaiting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine caught Mustex&#39;s scent on the ocean breeze as Ice \naproaches. Ice landed and Lunarpine took a defensive stance. &quot;You \nwere followed.&quot; He states as Mustex aproaches.\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry love, he&#39;s not with the alliance. He says he&#39;s a \nfriend.&quot; Ice answers putting a wing in front of her wolf boyfriend \nbefore he can react.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mustex lands stepping back cautiously. &quot;I thought we were going \nback to your base.&quot; he questions wondering why they stopped. \n&gt; &quot;We will,&quot; Ice answers &quot;But I had to meet my friends first to tell \nthem whats going on.&quot; She could tell that he was confused but she \ncouldn&#39;t risk radio contact so close to the alliance base to tell the \nother mutants she had company.\n&gt; &quot;We found signs of Silver Scout&quot; Razor Claw interjected setting the \nconversation back on the reason they were there. &quot;She went off in \nthat direction.&quot; The raptor pointed one of his stumpy arms somewhat \nnorth.\n&gt; &quot;It would seem that she found one of my old aquaintances&quot; \nFoxfingers interupted the chat, his defenses would keep them hidden \nbut he didn&#39;t want to take the chance of any dumb luck happening \nagain. Ice was hidden but Mustex somehow stumbled onto her. He didn&#39;t \nwant to chance that anyone else would have that kind of luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So what now boss?&quot; Razor Claw asked looking at Ice with eyes of a \nlost puppy. Veratis had put her in charge and as long as his \ncommander was present he didn&#39;t think for himself.\n&gt; Ice hadn&#39;t thought that far ahead, her team wouldn&#39;t trust Mustex \nsince they didn&#39;t know him, and she couldn&#39;t jeapordize the mission \nby taking him along. &quot;I&#39;ll take him back to base, you three follow \nour leads.&quot; She turned and got ready to fly away when she caught \nRazor Claws next thought. &quot;Lunarpines in charge, I&#39;ll meet you when \nI&#39;m done.&quot; The large white arctic owl spread her wings and flew \nskyward mentally calling back to Mustex &quot;Follow me.&quot;\n&gt; Mustex flew skyward behind the owl trying to see behind him that \nthe other mutants weren&#39;t following them.\n\n\n"}}
