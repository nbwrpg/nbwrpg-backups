I\nhaven&#39;t updated any of he sub pages but I eventually will.  As for many of\nthe inactive characters, I&#39;m thinking of either creating a separate list or\nmoving them off to the continuum characters list so we can more or less have\na list of currently active characters.\n\nThe maximals have more or less consolidated.  We have a small group of\nBushido Predecons that were active, the other group Iron Skulls, haven&#39;t\nreally done anything.  I was thinking they might both align with Hydras, but\nthen again the Bushido&#39;s sense of honor might make them reluctant to follow\nhim.  The watchers can continue as they are, since they&#39;ve always been\nbackground characters; right now they&#39;re keeping an eye on the Ark.\n\n-Kraftlos\n\n\nOn Feb 25, 2010 9:39 AM, &quot;supercyclonus&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\nHello,\n    I just read this post, it came out before I arrived back on the scene,\nbut I have been sporatically reading some of the posts I have missed.\n\nMy core characters would be: Cyclonus & Scourge, Marauder, Legacy.
