Finding that it was pleasent to see the great autoguns \nswivle into place while a shimmering dome of energy slid into place. Now \nTHIS was power. Maybe this city wouldn&#39;t be such a bad thing after \nall...though it was still hard to forget that it was built without her \nconcent and even the thought sent a shiver of bitterness down her spine and \na stab of insignifigence.  Almost confirming the fact that she was such a \nbad leader that she didn&#39;t even have the power to have a say in anything \nthat might actually prove to be important.\n&lt;...never built to lead.&gt;\nFortunatly, Cyndro&#39;s voice broke the cone of silence that threatened to \ndevelope into self doubt and with a deep breath of surprise Iron responded.*\n\n&quot; Thank you, Cyndro. I&#39;ll make sure to inform you of any ferther needs.&quot;\n\n* Although, with Prowl&#39;s thoughts, it brought her into verbal silence.\n&lt; I&#39;m not THAT incompitant, you know. I can handle things out here myself. \nMaybe while I&#39;m dealing with this you can start to learn how to controle \nthat SBM of yours, hmm?&gt;*\n\n..................................................\n\n* Tremmor nodded at his unseen commander&#39;s orders and skittered away into \nthe confins of the city, the sensitive tip of his snout quivering with the \nintensity of new scent and smells.\nThough a Maximal by birth...it was pretty confusing to be in a city without \nanyones permission. Like going into a strangers home without asking.\nKinda leaving a rather out-of-place feeling.*\n\n..................................................\n\n* A snout full of fine golden sand couldn&#39;t help but cause a mighty sneeze \nwhich caused the huge cyber wolf to stop in his tracks before continuing on \ndown the beach that lined the Alliance Island.\nThis new land was strange and he hadn&#39;t had much time to explore. The beings \nupon it and even the vegitation was rising a fair amount of curiocisy within \nthe great beast but it was simpler to explore THIS chunk of land before \nmoving onto the clear liquid that seperated it from a larger chunk.*\n\n..................................................\n\n* Zyber settled in the shade of a large pine, letting her misty gaze travel \nover the golden plain that stretched out for miles upon miles on end.\nSomewhere out across that expanse lied the Maximal City...as her scanners \ntold her.\nWould she dare to venture to that place? To dwell among others of her kind \nbut in metal surrounding that were unsettling and confining?\nCould it be done?\nA wild transformer to live with the tame?\nIt was an interesting thought.*\n\n..................................................\n\n* The drink was stail but she drunk it slowly anyway, finding that it hadn&#39;t \nlost it&#39;s taste at all. Surprisingly.\nSublime sat at a heavy steel slab which made up one of the 5 tables in the \ncity&#39;s lounge, sipping at her first drink alone.\nIt hadn&#39;t been all that long since she&#39;d left the sea but already she was \nmissing it. Finding it hard to concintrate upon her mission and often was \ncaught daydreaming.\nShe took another sip, letting the warm liquid slide down the length of her \ninner throat before returning her gaze to the vast expance of grassland that \nstretched out beyond the glass that seperated her from it.\nHow were the other&#39;s doing?*\n\n....................................................\n\n* Sighing with visible relief Biomass settled upon the bottom of the ocean, \nlooking out through the deep blue mass with a large black eye.\nLately things had been going slow but he&#39;d seen a fair amount.\nThe Alliance faction was a rather war urged species but only when they had \nto be. Generally annoyable and seriouse...it was interesting though he \nhadn&#39;t really interacted with the race.\nNue&#39;e settled down beside the giant squid in her seahorse beats mode, at \nconstant alert.\nShe remembered that giant fish that had almost eaten her commander alive and \nshe was sure it was still around...though where?*\n\n.....................................................\n\n* It was like it&#39;de taken FOREVER but they&#39;de reached it finally...panting a \nsore.*\n\n&quot; It&#39;s a city, Rion! Look at it!&quot;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
