He got up from the throne and \nwalked over to her, laughing,&quot;Your no match for me!&quot; as he kicked her \nin the stomach. She groaned and cried as he kept kicking her.\n\nHer body twitched and jerked.\n\nShe pleaded to him,&quot;Please, Vulois, I beg you, stop this. You forgave \nme once and..&quot; she was cut short as he kicked her again. She groaned \nand layed on the floor, crying and begging.  Vulois just laughed and \ndrew his gun again.  He shot her in the legs and laughed evily at her \nwhile she lay there, leaking and crying.  he kicked her again in the \nstomach and kicked her across the room.  He walked over to her, \ngrabbed her leash and dragged her back to his throne.  He tied the \nleash to the arm of the throne and laughed, &quot;You sniveling little \ncoward. You will now the pain that I suffered.  You left me to die, \nnow, it will be your turn.&quot;  Vulois stood up and stood next to \nher. &quot;How shall I kill thee, let me count the ways.&quot; He took out a \nwhip and started whipping her.  She felt the sting of the whip on her \nback and wings. The energon whip tore part of her wing and started \ncutting into her back.  She cried out with each crack of the whip. \nBut Vulois continued.  He finally stopped as she lay there, almost \nunconsious.  He picked her up and slapped her in the face,&quot;Wake up \nyou pathetic little insect. I&#39;m not done with you yet.&quot;  All she \ncould do was cry from the pain and fear that she felt.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
