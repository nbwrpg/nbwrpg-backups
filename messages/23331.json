Animals looked up in submission at the\nimmaculate being above them. Trees seemed to bow in his wake as he roared\nby. He was a being of reconing, poetry in the sky. He was a creature that\nstruck fear in the sparks of all evildoers, A creature whos snarl makes\nthings extinct, a bot of might, glory, pain, and anguish. (Not to mention an\nego the size of cybertron.) Necromancer flew through the sky at one with\nnature. He could sense the world around him, everything was one with him,\nwhen Earth wept, he wept, when the Earth grew, he grew. When the planet\nbled, He made the ones responsible bleed.\n\nHe landed outside the location of the repairs for the Ark. (Let me know if\nthe defenses react.) The great dragon roared at the devastation the war\ncaused. He could smell the wildcats somewhere around. He transformed into\nhis less threatening bot mode and approached. His link flashed with\ninformation about the meeting. He clicked off the frequency and proceeded to\nthe construction site.Even in his bot mode he was of considerable height and\nstature. The last thing he wanted was to be cooped up in a room full of\ndiplomats.\n\n\n"}}
