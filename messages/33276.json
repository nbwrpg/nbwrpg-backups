He stumbled back quite far actually, 5 steps \n&gt; is kinda far for a gestalt to stumble back from a normal heighted \n&gt; warrior&#39;s perspective.

Then, Surgital converted his hand into a saw blade again, \n&gt; and this time shot the saw blade at Lavatron&#39;s head.  (BTW, the blade \n&gt; was shot vertical, so moving to the side gives a better chance of \n&gt; dodging it.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
