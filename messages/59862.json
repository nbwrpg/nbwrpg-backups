I think you need to set a ruling in\nstone on this because it&#39;s clear that discussion is\npointless with the nothing coming of it. I think a\nrule needs to be set that if a player is not given a\nfair chance to reply, then any posts beyond the point\nof a realistic reply (as in anything that would exceed\ntime periods where characters reply if the situation\nwere real) be declared VOID.
