Cyndro was very excited about getting new stuff \nto be able to keep in good condition and all those nice things.\n\n&quot;You sure can, Cyndro.&quot; Replied Mantle and then looked over at the scanners \nwhen they reported a large wave of nanobots moving out toward the \nCybertronian Fire. They moved under the ground through the holes inbetween \nthe earth, and soon reached the ship and began to take apart the underside \nat the exact center. Each nanobot took off a particle and brought it back to \nthe Element.\n\nOutside the battle was still raging and a bunch of shots hit the Element&#39;s \nshields, but the Element was too strong to be hurt by that. The shields were \nstill at nearly 100%, and would stay there for quite a while unless these \nguys put more effort into their attacks, but Predacons were whimpy anyways. \nCyndro aimed the Element&#39;s weapons and launched alot of lasers at \nTriggerhappy and the other robots that were firing at the Element.\n\n\n\nCledar jumped out of the way of the giant foot that tried to squish him and \nthen fired his fusion cannon at it&#39;s owner. He was aiming for his chest.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
