A few things to consider: (1) Since you&#39;re using a timed mine, you must wait till the timer runs out for the explosion. That would mean that Azureblade could probably deavtivate the CR chamber (if that&#39;s possible) and try to run (unless he&#39;s a demolition expert). Also if that&#39;s possible, then he can probably warn other maximals in the base. (2) The explosion won&#39;t necessarily destroy the whole base; note that you are using a mine. It&#39;ll most likely cripple the majority of the interior, or blow out a large hole in the side, depending on where the CR chambers are. (3) The internal scanners of the Maximal base would likely detect either the explosives themselves, or the electrical signal of the timer and therefore hint to the Maxi&#39;s that something is going on.\n\nSince you know that this post is highly illegal, are you asking us to disallow it? Not that is necessarily is, it just that you rushed it too much, the timer must be taken into account.\n\nJust pause the thought while the council has a short discussion about it.\n\nCouncil members, visit the nbwrpg site, and check the coucil message board.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Michael Coburn&quot; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Symphony/Hell Drak::\n&gt; \n&gt; Symphony nodded, and said, &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll take care of him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Symphony looked in at AzureBlade.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry......&quot; Symphony said, as he deactivated the CR Chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; Symphony left the room.
