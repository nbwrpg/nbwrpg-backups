She felt his hand move over \nher body.  She sighed as he did.  She was totaly fixed on his kiss. \nShe didn&#39;t want her lips to part from his.  She forgot about the \nsoot, the burnt ship, the other bots, everything.  The only thing she \nknew, or thought of, was him.\nShe could feel his spark was racing as fast as her&#39;s.  She raised her \narms and gently glided her hand up and down his back.  She had her \nother arm hold her close to him.  She kissed him and felt her spark \ngo for him.  Her spark, mind and body told her, she was his, no \nmatter what.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Striker::\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker keeps his lips on Spears, wondering if she wanted to go any \nfarther. \n&gt; One of his arms travels down her body, feeling her as the other \npressed her \n&gt; to him. The fact that they were both covered with soot and ashes \nmade holding \n&gt; her a bit accuard, but he didn&#39;t care.\n&gt; \n&gt; His spark was speeding, his pulse going more and more rapidly, but \nhe could \n&gt; feel that she was excited as well. He presses her body to his, \ncontinuing the \n&gt; kiss.\n\n\n"}}
