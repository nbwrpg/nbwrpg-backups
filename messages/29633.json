He had been through to much to die here on this island.\nThrough a lot of strain he stood, and remembered the energon he had read in\nthe Arctic. &quot;Predaking, hhhhhhuhhhhh, search this mudball for other\ncreatures, I need to recharge&quot; he said weakly, and slowly lifted himself\noff of the ground, and started to fly towards the Arctics.\n\n\n\n"}}
