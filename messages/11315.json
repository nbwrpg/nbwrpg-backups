She smiled and took the \ncup. &quot;Thank you.&quot;  She sipped from the cup and looked around.  She \nlet go of Chordate&#39;s arm and walked over to a chair.  Her hips swayed \nand her tail moved in a flowing motion as she walked to the chair.  \nShe sat down and crossed her legs. Her tail draping over her lap.  \nShe set the cup on the table and looked at Chordate, smiling warmli \nat him. &quot;Would you care to join me?&quot; she said in a soft, sensual \nvoice. She patted a chair next to her and motioned with her tail for \nhim to come over.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Chordate: \n&gt; \n&gt; Chordate sighed in a dreamy tone, Feline now moving her lovely tail \nover \n&gt; parts of his head.  It felt wonderful!  \n&gt; &quot;Oh...a-a drink.  Yeah.  Water?  Ok.&quot; he said, pressing a few \nbuttons at a \n&gt; dispencer with his free arm, two cups appearing.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the cups had cold water in it, the other had a pink liquid, \nliquid \n&gt; energon.  Since the attack in space, and then the crash, Chordate \nhadn&#39;t had \n&gt; much time to sit around and do nothing.  But with the kitty holding \nonto him \n&gt; so lovingly, now was a good time for him!\n&gt; \n&gt; Grabbing the cup of water, he held it in front of Feline, a shiver \nrunning \n&gt; through him as he began to feel the vibrations of her lovely purr, \nher head \n&gt; rubbing against his shoulder.\n\n\n"}}
