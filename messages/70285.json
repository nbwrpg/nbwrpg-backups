It is roughly 8-10 feet wide\nand it runs nearly straight down into the depths of the earth. Even\nwith artificial light its end point cannot be seen as it continued\ninto the darkness below. The sides are extremely smooth and sheer,\nalmost as if someone had cut it with some sort of high energy beam.\n\nSeveral hundred feet down, nearly at the edge of the available light\nthere is a side shaft that appears to be running off in the direction\nof Hydras&#39; base. However to reach the side shaft one would need to be\nable to fly or have extremely good climbing abilities, as there are no\nhand holds and not even a single plant breaks the surface of the walls\nlining this area.\n\nFrom beneath the shaft the pit continues to drop into darkness, while\nnoxious fumes rise from below clearly show the danger of missing the\nside shaft and plunging into the super heated depths. It would be a\ngrizzly end indeed.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\nOOC: I did some checking, in post #69197 Airly declared that the Black\nFortress is in Europe, and as we all know the Ark is in the US at the\nfoot of Mount St Helen. So we may want to curb the detections and\nscans that can reach from the ark to the fortress unless we have some\nsort of relay set up. There of course would be no relay down in these\ntunnels. :)\n\n"}}
