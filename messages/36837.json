He exits and\nwaits for Ice. two drones float out to meet them.\n\n&quot;Strap these onto your back, it&#39;ll make your flight go a little quicker.&quot;\nthe fox says feeling obligated to help his teammates out. Ice transformed to\nher half robot, half polarbear mode and had Lunarpine attach the drone to\nher back for her, her bear claws made it difficult to do any detailed\nholding or moving.\n\nLunarpine helped her out, then attached his own. They checked thier DNA\nscanners and flew off into the wild blue yonder across the big blue ocean to\nthe big blue land of Canada (I know it&#39;s not blue but it worked with the\npost.)\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Beast Wars &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, June 07, 2001 7:15 AM\nSubject: Re: Say Welcome to Grizzltron\n\n\n�Grizzltron�\n\n\n   Grizzltron Remmembers about something he forgot.
