She looked at the shuttle \nas it landed and hoped that they would be able to help them rescue \nStriker and Spears.  She felt a jolt of pain run up her shoulder, but \nshe tried to ignore it.  They had bigger problems to deal with.  The \npain could wait.  She waited to see the bots step off the shuttle. \n\nShe turned and looked at Ratchet, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose we have any \nweapons left on the Ark do we?  We will need all the weapons and ammo \nwe can get.  Also,  when we go out fot the rescue mission,  we will \nneed to leave a few here to protect the ship.  We can&#39;t leave it \ntotally unguarded.&quot;  She then looked back over at the shuttle.  She \nknew that once it landed and a head count was conducted, they would \nhave to form a plan.  Then they would need to go to the CYbertron \nFire to see if they had a few bots they could loan out for \nreenforcements.\n\n\n\n"}}
