You were not aware =\r\nof my change of status to Prime office and perhaps mistook me for my previo=\r\nus status.

So there&#39;s no way he coudl have been there, and he wouldn&#39;t have gon=\r\ne back over to them! So will pose this as taking place out in the ship corr=\r\nidors. Thanks!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Also, I appreciate your posting, but it&#39;s sort of wei=\r\nrd how you have each and every character of your&#39;s coming up, then doing so=\r\nmething to me, then knowing each and every thing that happened to each adn =\r\nevery other one that did, and them all having the exact same opinions over =\r\non everyone as everyone else did. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Also, unless your characte ris as=\r\nuperior officer who&#39;s going to emphatically order him to do something, plea=\r\nse don&#39;t pose him going somewhere far else after you for a setup. Since it&#39;=\r\ns hideously unrealistic for him to go back to Tuscon&#39;s quarters twice now a=\r\ns you&#39;ve posed him doing when he&#39;s not especially fond of Tuscon, nor him f=\r\nollowing someone else as well when I posd him trying to leave. So, if going=\r\n to go somewhere with him, please give me a cahnce to respond to it ahead o=\r\nf time. It&#39;s two times you posed him extensively going with your characters=\r\n when it was not in character for him to do so.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If your characters h=\r\nave had interactions with him in the past or things I should know of, let m=\r\ne know? As I have no idea where Wheelie interacted with Tuscon or how they =\r\nwould have remotely konwn of one another, and you&#39;ve posted repeaetdly that=\r\n Tuscon knows him from the past, when I have no idea of that.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; So aga=\r\nin, if they&#39;ve had interactions as NPC&#39;s, let me know their generic history=\r\n so I can respond appropriately. If he&#39;s going to be told to go somewhere w=\r\ntih someone, either give me a chance to respond appropriately if he does or=\r\n not, or make it something like a specific order in the case someone is a s=\r\nuperior. And it&#39;s also rather weird how your characers come up from nowhere=\r\n, all have the exact same opininos and back one another up to the hilt on t=\r\nhier interactions and everything. I feel kind of wedged into a corner by th=\r\nis.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I understand I&#39;m new to the gruop and you&#39;ve been here much long=\r\ner, I just feel rather hemmed in on the character with what you&#39;re doing an=\r\nd am confused as to how things operate, and how you have all of your alts c=\r\nongregating and making me feel pressed into a corner.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Anyways, sorry=\r\n if this is coming fof a bit too negative, thank you very much for the welc=\r\nome here and for playing wtih me and interacting with Wheelie.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;Back=\r\n In Character&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Wheelie, having met Tuscon up in the hall, gazes over=\r\n at him, &quot;What is this with all of you?

I=\r\n&#39;d prefer to keep my own advice, and I appreciate your friends, they try an=\r\nd be nice. But don&#39;t have them ganging up on me and telling me what to do, =\r\nor how you&#39;ll react, or on you&#39;ll I chew.

\n  &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n Meanwhile, in Tucson&#39;s quarters, Tucson looks down at \n  Wheelie and reali=\r\nzes that he had no idea of his change of status, seeing that \n  the last ti=\r\nme they were together Tucson was just an average comrade, just a \n  slight =\r\nlarger than Wheelie. He heaves a sigh and kneels down to \n  Wheelie.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot; I was going to give you a lecture and a warning \n  but I reali=\r\nze you just comeback online after many vorns . You were not aware \n  of my =\r\nchange of status to Prime office and perhaps mistook me for my previous \n  =\r\nstatus. I&#39;ll let it go this one time, Wheelie but keep in mind that a Prime=\r\n is \n  a Prime no matter who they are. All right, you&#39;re free to roam the A=\r\nuto base \n  now. Please try not to get sent to my office again, okay?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n  With a smile of understanding, Tucson opens the door to let=\r\n Wheelie go on his \n  way. Once having let Wheelie free, he waits for Talon=\r\n with a light hearted \n  smile on his face.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OOC - Uhm, I po=\r\nsted Wheelie leaving your \n  quarters and he never entered them in the firs=\r\nt place, then him heading out. \n  So there&#39;s no way he coudl have been ther=\r\ne, and he wouldn&#39;t have gone back \n  over to them! So will pose this as tak=\r\ning place out in the ship corridors. \n  Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I appreciate y=\r\nour posting, but it&#39;s sort of weird how you \n  have each and every characte=\r\nr of your&#39;s coming up, then doing something to me, \n  then knowing each and=\r\n every thing that happened to each adn every other one \n  that did, and the=\r\nm all having the exact same opinions over on everyone as \n  everyone else d=\r\nid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, unless your characte ris asuperior officer \n  who&#39;s going=\r\n to emphatically order him to do something, please don&#39;t pose him \n  going =\r\nsomewhere far else after you for a setup. Since it&#39;s hideously \n  unrealist=\r\nic for him to go back to Tuscon&#39;s quarters twice now as you&#39;ve posed \n  him=\r\n doing when he&#39;s not especially fond of Tuscon, nor him following someone \n=\r\n  else as well when I posd him trying to leave. So, if going to go somewher=\r\ne \n  with him, please give me a cahnce to respond to it ahead of time. It&#39;s=\r\n two \n  times you posed him extensively going with your characters when it =\r\nwas not in \n  character for him to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your characters have ha=\r\nd interactions \n  with him in the past or things I should know of, let me k=\r\nnow? As I have no \n  idea where Wheelie interacted with Tuscon or how they =\r\nwould have remotely \n  konwn of one another, and you&#39;ve posted repeaetdly t=\r\nhat Tuscon knows him from \n  the past, when I have no idea of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nSo again, if they&#39;ve had \n  interactions as NPC&#39;s, let me know their generi=\r\nc history so I can respond \n  appropriately. If he&#39;s going to be told to go=\r\n somewhere wtih someone, either \n  give me a chance to respond appropriatel=\r\ny if he does or not, or make it \n  something like a specific order in the c=\r\nase someone is a superior. And it&#39;s \n  also rather weird how your characers=\r\n come up from nowhere, all have the exact \n  same opininos and back one ano=\r\nther up to the hilt on thier interactions and \n  everything. I feel kind of=\r\n wedged into a corner by this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I understand \n  I&#39;m new to the gruop =\r\nand you&#39;ve been here much longer, I just feel rather \n  hemmed in on the ch=\r\naracter with what you&#39;re doing and am confused as to how \n  things operate,=\r\n and how you have all of your alts congregating and making me \n  feel press=\r\ned into a corner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, sorry if this is coming fof a bit \n  too =\r\nnegative, thank you very much for the welcome here and for playing wtih me =\r\n\n  and interacting with Wheelie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;Back In Character&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wh=\r\neelie, \n  having met Tuscon up in the hall, gazes over at him, &quot;What is thi=\r\ns with all of \n  you? You&#39;re back and forth whatever I do. This is what Pri=\r\nme is, just a rank? \n  It seems like it&#39;s just sort of dank. We had four of=\r\n five in a room, that&#39;s \n  not a level of doom and gloom.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, wal=\r\nking away from Tuscon, but \n  looking behind, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re good with al=\r\nl of your friends, congrualtions \n  on the promotion and to whatever ends. =\r\nBut we, we were never friends. We went \n  back and forth in our ways, and I=\r\n respect your orders for these days. But \n  we&#39;re not here to have fun, we&#39;=\r\nre here to fight and run and \n  gun.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wheelie leaning against the wa=\r\nll, &quot;I&#39;ll work wtih you, if you do \n  tell, but I&#39;m a soldier, and war is h=\r\nell. I&#39;d prefer to keep my own advice, \n  and I appreciate your friends, th=\r\ney try and be nice. But don&#39;t have them \n  ganging up on me and telling me =\r\nwhat to do, or how you&#39;ll react, or on you&#39;ll \n  I chew. So by al lmeans, g=\r\nive me some space, we&#39;re here to fight for the \n  future of our \nrace.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;COL=\r\nOR: white;&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n=\r\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-18-1030370624--\r\n\n"}}
