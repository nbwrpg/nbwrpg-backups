A wave of sonar energy is cast from hi=\r\ns throat and powerful&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; vocalizers.  Sharp teeth and fangs glimmer i=\r\nn the moonlight as a strong&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; silver tail thrashes the ground beneat=\r\nh his four feet.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs TUSCON&#39;s warning is heard the Predacons shift =\r\ntheir audio circuits&lt;br&gt;\noff as they glance back at at the large dragon.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;RRROOOAAARRR!!!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTUSCON&#39;s roar can b=\r\ne heard for hundreds of miles as the sound of it&lt;br&gt;\nechoes and re-echoes o=\r\nut across the miles and miles of dead dinosaurs.&lt;br&gt;\nOne of the first thing=\r\ns he reailzes is that although capable of large&lt;br&gt;\namounts of damage, It i=\r\ns rougher and cruder in its sensory mode, but&lt;br&gt;\ncapable of far more damag=\r\ne then he could once deliver before.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt is almost like a wind has =\r\npicked up and blown some of the bodies&lt;br&gt;\nback. Dinosaurs that are caught =\r\nin the cone of effect are broken and&lt;br&gt;\ntossed about, bones vibrating and =\r\nthen snapped as if hit by a tidal&lt;br&gt;\nwave, although instead of one of wate=\r\nr, this one is made of sound.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNo, it was not the same as his origi=\r\nnal sonar, but it was very effective indeed!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAround TUSCON the Pre=\r\ndacons, as well as probrably the Maximals leaped&lt;br&gt;\nout of the way as the =\r\ncones sweeps through. At high enough levels&lt;br&gt;\nsound can do actual physica=\r\nl damage and not just bust ear drums and&lt;br&gt;\nover load audio circuits.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs the roar dies down, the damage that is done is incredible and&lt;br&gt;\nT=\r\nUSCON&#39;s energy cells are slowly trying to recharge themselves from&lt;br&gt;\nsuch=\r\n a high energy output (OOC: He has to catch his breath). Across&lt;br&gt;\nthe sen=\r\nsors there is no evidence of anyone being affected beyond the&lt;br&gt;\ndead dino=\r\nsaurs and the movement of TUSCON&#39;s allies.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs far as anyone could =\r\ntell either their enemy was out of range of&lt;br&gt;\nTUSCON&#39;s roar or was protec=\r\nted by them in some manner.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;That was interesting.&quot; SKY SHADOW sai=\r\nd from his position next to&lt;br&gt;\nHYDRAS as he shrugged his shoulders.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&quot;And loud!&quot; INJECTOR said as he buzzed near by. He was in beast mode&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nlooking like a strange cross of lionfish and hornet.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCYCLONUS and=\r\n RODIMUS continued up towards the path of devastation left&lt;br&gt;\nby the dinos=\r\naurs, RODIMUS weaving between the bodies in vehicle mode&lt;br&gt;\nwhile CYCLONUS=\r\n just flew above them as a jet.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPreston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n =\r\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/b=\r\nody&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-87--230576061--\r\n\n"}}
