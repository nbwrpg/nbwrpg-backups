See, \n&gt; the floor they were on was circular and had three passsage ways \nthat \n&gt; went down into the ship. FoxFingers took one passage that went \n&gt; through part of the ships engine rooms, then on down to the brig.\n&gt; \n&gt; And yes, to keep it interesting, FF is going to pass part of the \n&gt; engine room, life support and some minor propulsion systems before \n&gt; getting to the brig.\n\n\n"}}
