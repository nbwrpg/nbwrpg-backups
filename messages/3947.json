How the heck did Tigerhawk salvage the &quot;Nemesis&quot; fusion \n=\r\ncannon?  How is he lifting it?  How is he aiming?  How is he still standing=\r\n \nform the kickback?   How is he supplying it ith power?  That is a mode, a=\r\nnd \nif you continue with it, you&#39;re going to get kicked out of the RPG.  Al=\r\no, \nCode, don&#39;t post damage.  Grabbing and twisting my hands, is a posting =\r\n\ndamage.  You can say attempts, but you can&#39;t say you did.   Don&#39;t do that =\r\n\nplease.  Wait until I actually reply.

Seeing \nhim to begin to charge to=\r\nwards him, Oblitertron pulled his sword out of \nsubspace in a blink of an e=\r\nye, throwing the sword at the approaching \nRidister&#39;s chest, firing an opti=\r\nc blast at Ridistor&#39;s left knee as the sword \nleft his hand.\n\n---\n\n&quot;Hmmm...=\r\nI&#39;d prefer waiting until the Maximals had their backs turned, but \nwhen Zar=\r\ndus gives orders, I take them...mosto f the time.&quot; Nemesis chuckled, \nraisi=\r\nng his rapid fire laser rifle, firing off twenty rapid blasts of laser \nene=\r\nrgy at the back of Radistor&#39;s head.  &quot;ALLIANCE, KILL &#39;EM, KILL &#39;EM ALL!&quot; \n\n=\r\n---\n\nAnubis chuckled.  &quot;By the Void, d=E9j=E0 vu.&quot; he said, slowly edging a=\r\nway, \nraising his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at Radistor&#39;s side.=\r\n\n\n---\n\nHades chuckled as well.  &quot;I thought we killed those fools.  Must be =\r\nusing \nmagic or something.&quot; he &quot;joked&quot; raising his missile launcher and fir=\r\ning a \nrocket off at the back of Radistor&#39;s left knee.\n\n---\n\nUnitron was wa=\r\ntching the display of stupidity from the Maximals.
