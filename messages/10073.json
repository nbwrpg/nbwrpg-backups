She could see a wolf\n&gt; limping long on the ground.  She flew down to make sure it was him\n&gt; and not a pred or a regular wolf.\n&gt;\n&gt; She flew up to him and landed.  She looked at him. &quot;Lunarpine. Oh my\n&gt; gosh am I happy to see you. I missed you so...&quot; her voice trailed off\n&gt; as she saw how damaged her was.  She wasn&#39;t sure if she should get\n&gt; mad now or wait until he was in better condition to yell at him. She\n&gt; would wait, but just for a little while.\n&gt;\n&gt; She transformed into bot mode. &quot;So, how was your camping trip?&quot; she\n&gt; said with a slight touch of sarcasm. &quot;You know, for a few days of fun\n&gt; in the sun, you look a bit worn out.  You feeling OK?&quot;  She knelt\n&gt; down and patted his head and scratched his ears.  She saw the mech\n&gt; fluid coming out of his mouth. Now she was getting really concerned.\n&gt; &quot;If you stay in beast mode I can carry to back to the base.  You look\n&gt; like you could use a CR chamber pretty badly.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The wolf stumbled again, mech fluid dripping from his jaw,his\n&gt; &gt; internal injuries had reopened. he had to continue. he could\n&gt; envision\n&gt; &gt; Shadow Wings grief, he could envision the sight of Deathscythe\n&gt; &gt; spitting on his spark laughing at Lunarpine for his stupidity. he\n&gt; &gt; smelled the air, the smell of past battles was growing stronger, he\n&gt; &gt; figured he was inside the Maximal scanning zone, he hoped the Ark\n&gt; &gt; could spare a bot to help him back yo the base. he looked to the\n&gt; sky,\n&gt; &gt; the sky above glittered by the light of the half moon. He looked at\n&gt; &gt; the half moon and opened his fluidy jaw.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Howwwwwwlllllll&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He pressed on with the thought of what he&#39;d do when he met up with\n&gt; &gt; the Pred that did this to him. &quot;I have your scent monster&quot; the\n&gt; words\n&gt; &gt; echoed through his mind.
