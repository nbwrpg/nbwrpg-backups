Most of us are finding it harder and harder \nto try \n&gt; and get enough time in just to feed ourselves.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron looked down at the ground as she walked, then looking up as \nsoon as \n&gt; she was only 6ft away from the bots in the first row.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; But there&#39;s no breaks from that strain yet, I&#39;m afraid.  We&#39;re \ngetting \n&gt; weaker, losing our edge. Even that Alliance can kick our asses and \nthat&#39;s \n&gt; bad.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She took a breath.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s our fighting that needs working on because \nit&#39;s \n&gt; not.  Even as Arkness Prime I&#39;d find myself with a challenge just \ngoing up \n&gt; against some of you.  It&#39;s our form, our coperation.\n&gt; We need stratagy, and we need attack plans.  And I know it&#39;s MY \nfault for \n&gt; not doing that to begin with.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She uncrossed her arms.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And now it&#39;s all of YOU who&#39;s paying for my poor leadership.  But \nI wanna \n&gt; make it up to all of you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron cleared her throat.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; For the next few mega-cycles we&#39;re going to drill.  And I&#39;ll be \ndrilling \n&gt; right along with you all.  After all, this is a war, not a vacation.  \nBut \n&gt; while we ALL work our asses off I&#39;ll be getting something ready that \nI&#39;m \n&gt; sure you&#39;ll all enjoy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp\n\n\n"}}
