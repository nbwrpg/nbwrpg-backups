He needed rest and the cave would offer\nenough concealment.\n\nOnce inside the mutant found the cave paintings from a youth,  from what he\ncould tell the youth was human, a tribe of the useless fleshy, weak\ncreatures must have migrated away and left only thier paintings to show they\nwere ever there.\n\nMegaton reached out and touched the wall, a sudden charge of energy forced\nthe large bot away from the wall. He held up his hand and scanned it for an\nenergy signature only to find nothing had happened to him. The scanns did\nreveal one oddity though. A thin layer of berries, sap, and mud had coated\nhis fingers. The wall paintings were wet like they were drawn an hour ago\ninstead of  years past.\n\nThe mutant exited the cave ansd scanned the world. two pods weren&#39;t far\naway. The beast transformed to his T-Rex form and went to investigate. once\nnearby he detected animals, three of them. from the looks of things there\nwas a mother, father and baby. A mighty swing of the monsters tail remedied\nthe family situation killing the mother (leaving the baby and fathers DNA to\nbe replicated.) After the two creatures ran away he continued to the pod\nwhere he saw Stallex and Mustex, they weren&#39;t bots he recognized.\n\nBOOC He&#39;s all yours dewboy, try to return him in the same condition that you\nborrowed him in.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;dewboy30816@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001 2:11 PM\nSubject: Re: angry\n\n\n&gt; Sorry I recheked you got him.

Until then his only existence was as cells from\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transmetal T-Rex Megatron and a large Maximal dragon named\n&gt; &gt; Necromancer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since Veratis&#39; past hasn&#39;t really been revealed as to where he\n&gt; got\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; protoforms he&#39;s been &quot;Improving&quot; (Experimenting on with a mutant\n&gt; &gt; virus which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; removes most signs of a robot form) I&#39;m sure something can be\n&gt; &gt; worked out,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe have Stallex attacked by a bot resembling Megaton. A\n&gt; &gt; resemblance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his former mode might exist through the DNA replication. This\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; open a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rivalry between him and a few bots in the game. (Necromancer,\n&gt; &gt; Veratis,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megaton, just to name three.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sound OK to you? either that or we&#39;ll just say a future temporal\n&gt; &gt; anomaly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will send Megaton back in time to when Stallex was young but it\n&gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened to him yet. (If theres anyone who understands temporal\n&gt; &gt; physics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; please explain them to me, I&#39;m getting a headache just thinking\n&gt; &gt; about it.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 11:32 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: angry\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stallex had improved,but his dad was furious and figting harder\n&gt; &gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ever so Stallex was being crushed.
