However we are detecting many different signatures on your\nship. If you wish to search for your comrades you will dock your ship\nat these coordinates and report to Commander Tarrif.&quot;\n\nEven as Hydras&#39; ship recieves the coordinates from Breakout Taratulus\npoints to a sensor reading he is picking up on the ship&#39;s sensors,\n&quot;Either that dolt is lying or is an idiot, by I can see the trail\nwhere our ship went.&quot;\n\nThe sensor reading shows a vapor trail from Skyshadow&#39;s shuttle going\nin the direction of the docks.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
