He looked admiringly at all the buttons\nand controls, and how well everything fit together. He turned each\nmonitor on, and could see how easily he could switch from one cell to\nanother, and even view several at once should he choose. He could\ncontrol nearly every aspect of all the cells from here.\n\nHe could see from his monitor that Hydras was just having Tuscon put\nin his cell so he turned up the sound . . .\n\n&gt; You look back at what you did wrong and you correct it. It&#39;s all right to make mistakes Rodimus, Primus knows I&#39;ve made more than my fair share already.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&quot;Yes you have made some mistakes today.&quot; Rodimus said over a speaker\nnear by Tuscon&#39;s ear, Rodimus chuckled at his own joke. &quot;However you\nwill pay for it for a long long time.&quot;\n\n(OOC: Sandy, I sent you an email also)\n\nRodimus was about to say something really clever when Darkhawk said\nsomething . . .\n\n&gt; Darkhawk grined and said Rodimus with malice &quot;I bet that you Girlfriend will be alone\na while...&quot;\n\nRodimus looked over at Darkhawk, all the humor that had just been in\nhis face and voice vanishing, to be replaced by a darker more\nsuspicious tone, &quot;What do you mean by that Darkhawk?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
