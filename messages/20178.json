Even though the bump \nwas soft, he was disoriented enough to nearly fall from it.\n\n&quot;No, I can fly,&quot; he says. He was obvioustly very dazed from the severed \nconnection. Transforming into beast mode, he realizes his error as pain \nshoots through his body from his broken wing. He transforms back into robot \nmode, falling to his knees, his face green.\n\n&quot;Allright, maybe I do need some help,&quot; he admits, getting to his feet. He \nmounts Iron Raptor, his feet pressing on her sides, &quot;Ok, let&#39;s go then, love.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nYelling in frustration, Bloodystrike and Reptilica fall along with Desmonus, \nfinally hitting a wall at the end of a corridor. The base seems to stabalize, \nBloodystrike getting up and seeing that it was Desmonus who fell with them.\n\n&quot;You allright?&quot; he asks, his eyes sliding down her body. Next to him, \nReptilica groaned, opening his eyes.\n\n"}}
