Mister? What&#39;s your name and would you like to get \nsomething to eat with us?&quot; she said  in a high pitched, cheerful \nvoice.  She didn&#39;t really have any fear of the bot, more like \nchildlike curiousity.  ON the ship, she only knew the crew nad her \nfamily.  They were all pretty much like her. Now she ahd a whole \nworld to explore and find.  She looked again at the bot,&quot;Say, What \nare you, I never saw anything like you before.&quot;  She had a big smile \nonher face.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt;      &quot;Yes I am hungry but who is this bird?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
