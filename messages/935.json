That way \nthere was little risk of damage :::\n\n::: RATTRAP ::: I cant let you do this!\n\n::: MEGATRON ignored him as he fired at one of the Maximals :::\n\n::: Rat trap ::: Are you even listening to me?\n\n::: MEGATRON, with his lifeless left arm, looks to the rat ::: If your not \ngoing to kill someone, get out of here vermine!\n\n::: Rat trap glares at MEGATRON :: Oh...I&#39;ll kill someone alright....\n\n::: The rat takes his gun and slams it to MEGATRONs temple and fires all in a \nmatter of a seconed. The purple giant tumbles to the ground as mech fluid \nbegins to flow from his head :::\n\n::: MEGATRON ghasping :::.....Maximal....trash......\n\n:: RAT TRAP fires at him one more time, this time at Megatron&#39;s face leaving \na smoking crater. The two crimsom lights that served as his eyes faded as his \nchest sank for the last time :::\n\n::: GREMLIN, overlooking the scene extends a hand ::: Cmon pal, lets go!\n\n::: Rat trap and Gremlin barge out from the cover over to JACKLE and BALCK \nARACNIA ::: \n\n::: BLACK ARACNIA ::: Wow, you toasted Meg-head!\n\n::: Rat Trap ::: It was nothin really...\n\n::: Jackle looks at the small bomb in his hands ::: Alright, this should at \nleast cause some damage...\n\n::: Gremlin ::: What about the Auto-bots and Decepticons?\n\n::: Jackle ::: I think if we chuck it into the air vents Meg used, we can \nsend a back draft right into the Maximal base, leaving the Arc undamaged.\n\n::: Black aracnia nods ::: Ill cover you, just blow this joint!\n\n::: Jackle hurls the bomb into the vent, giving it a 10 minute detenation \nfuse. Now all they had to do was get out of there. :::\n\n::: Black aracnia went to look at Maegatron one last time. His body now \nlifeless and still. She gave him a swift kick for all the crap he put her \nthrough...and with a small slide he broke through the floor grating and his \nbody sank like a rock through the Lava that flowed under the Arc :::\n\n::: Black aracnia ::: My vendetta is paid you bastard!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: TRANSANULAS looks to Quickstrike :::: Well, you can take over the Pred \nbase if you want. I on the other hand will remember your debt, but now I must \ngo. If I hurry I can get into the battle. With your current condition I \nsuggest you stay put until we can find a CR chamber. \n\n::: He began to leave, then turned ::: Ill be back.\n\n\n"}}
