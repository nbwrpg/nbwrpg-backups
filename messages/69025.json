I&#39;ve been\n&gt; trying to =\r\ncatch up in my post reading, but it seems to be a lost\ncause since\n&gt; I don&#39;=\r\nt have enough time (or concentration).  Could someone help me\nout by\n&gt; givi=\r\nng me a summary of what has happened since I&#39;ve been out?  Last\nI read,\n&gt; t=\r\nhere was stuff going down in relay and the other group was on the\nway to\n&gt; =\r\nthe ark.  My characters were at the fortress but I couldn&#39;t get back\ninto\n&gt;=\r\n the action.  Any help would be much appreciated, because I would like to\n&gt;=\r\n play again!  :D\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; -Kraftlos\n\nI will try to give you the br=\r\noad strokes! :) Airly, please correct me\nif I miss anything or misstate any=\r\nthing. I may have gotten some of the\nfollowing out of order a bit . .  a lo=\r\nt has happened. But I hope it\nhelps. \n\nFeel free to throw any questions at =\r\nme or Airly. \n\n------------------------\n\nMegatron X was at Relay while Mali=\r\nce attacked several of us at the\nblack fortress. With the help of Myrmidon =\r\nand Perceptor Malice was\nrepelled from the base. Megatron X showed up and s=\r\naid a few words.\nHowever just as quickly he left leaving us to our own devi=\r\nces. (IE:\nThese character&#39;s player stopped posting)\n\nWhile this was happeni=\r\nng the Maximals chose this time to attack, I\npresume in an attempt to gain =\r\nback their captured members, but their\nattempt failed and in fact a member =\r\nwas captured: Windlord! And much\nlike his predecessor Rodimus Prime he too =\r\nwas corrupted becoming Darkhawk.\n\nMeanwhile, at a lull in the combat betwee=\r\nn the Maximals and the\nPedicons  a huge host of sweeps began attacking both=\r\n Predicons and\nMaximals at Hydras&#39; base, wreaking much havok. \n\nmeanwhile R=\r\nodimus was sent away on some secret mission and Scourge\nalong with a few sw=\r\neeps was sent by Cyclonus to track him down.\nScourge tracked Rodimus to an =\r\nold Maximal base from many years ago.\nAnd despite his best efforts Rodimus =\r\neluded him. \n\nMeanwhile at the Ark, the minions Cyclonus had reconstructed =\r\nattacked\nthe Ark, they had managed to arrive there before the Maximal defen=\r\nders\nwho were sent there, due to the distraction of Nightrazor. \n\nThe minio=\r\nns were about to attack when Legacy, (who appears as a black\nand red versio=\r\nn of Shockblast) appeared seemingly from inside the ark\nand began to defend=\r\n it. He was able to single-handedly able to defeat\nDeepstryke and Phobia, a=\r\nnd held off the others until help arrived in\nthe form of Lord Elder and the=\r\n other Maximal defenders. \n\nIt was revealed that Legacy was a temporal guar=\r\ndian and had been sent\nback to correct a temporal irregularity that had for=\r\nmed. \n\nIt was then that Cyclonus and his host of sweeps arrived, and the\nMa=\r\nximals and the Predicons had come to an accord to work together to\ndefeat t=\r\nhis minion menace. \n\nThe battle that ensued was huge! Lord Elder, Legacy, G=\r\nrimlock and the\nother Maximal defenders held the Ark while Hydras and his c=\r\nrew\nattacked from the rear. \n\nDuring the battle a black sphere appeared aro=\r\nund the ark for a long\nwhile, inside a spark extractor unit flew attacking =\r\nthe occupants\ninside, seeking to find a way into the ark. An interesting ef=\r\nfect of\nthis extractor is that at certain intervals it fired outside the\nsp=\r\nhere, striking several of the minion lt&#39;s. \n\nHowever due to the efforts of =\r\nLegacy and Kup, this menace was\nultimately warded off. \n\nBUT it was the bat=\r\ntle between Cyclonus and Rodimus that turned the\nbattle. At first it looked=\r\n as if Cyclonus had the upper hand, but at\nthe end Rodimus fired some stran=\r\nge black optic blast that knocked\nCyclonus out, even as he too fell over. S=\r\ntrangely this attack seemed\nto effect Scourge, who left his post to come to=\r\n his commander&#39;s\ndefenses. However instead of being thanked Scourge was hit=\r\n by a\nsimilar blast from Cyclonus and Scourge also fell unconscious. \n\nWith=\r\nout any of the commanders to lead them the sweeps were quickly\nrouted. \n\nNo=\r\nw the Predicons and Maximals are attempting to pick up the shattered\npieces=\r\n of thier battle, and make thier own plans for the future. \n\nInterestingly,=\r\n the Spark extractor that had attacked the ark has\nattacked Myrmidon, KOing=\r\n him, so far his condition is unknown. The\ndevice is now attacking Hydras, =\r\nas he attempts to get his wounded\nforces about of there. \n\nAnd as a last no=\r\nte: Rodimus, Cyclonus and Scourge have been captured\nby Skorponok for unkno=\r\nwn reasons. Perceptor has tracked to to his last\ndig site where he picked u=\r\np the only two minions who appeared mobile\nfrom this battle: Darkfate and N=\r\nightstrike. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
