She didn&#39;t mean \nto sound annoyed, its just that he interrupted her when she was \ndealing with a possible threat.\n\n&quot;Aw, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she says, walking up to him and scratching behind \nhis ears, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to get mad. Its just that I was monitoring \nhim pretty well.&quot;\n\nShe hoped that D wouldn&#39;t hold a grudge against her for her yelling \nat him. He was a nice bot and she didn&#39;t want to scare him off.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * D watched Fenox, her eyes unresponsive before she shook her head.\n&gt; His ears pressed flat against his skull as she rose her voice at \nhim, \n&gt; thinking that he was picking up an angry tone.\n&gt; Was he in trouble? He was only trying to help her.\n&gt; He whined and moved away from the door, nodding when she asked if \nthat was \n&gt; all he wanted to let her know.\n&gt; Fenox sounded impatient and annoyed with him, making him feel bad.\n&gt; If there was one thing that the people who created him could say, \nwas that \n&gt; his feelings were hurt easily.\n&gt; D wasn&#39;t use to bluntness, and was basically as helpless as a new \nborn in \n&gt; this world.\n&gt; Even though he held great power, he was shy in using it and was a \nkind \n&gt; heart.\n&gt; But he still didn&#39;t like Vlad, though Fenox didn&#39;t seem to need him \nto \n&gt; protect her or anything. So he wouldn&#39;t, since she knew what was \ngoing on.\n&gt; D sat down on his haunches and lowered his head, wating for Fenox \nto leave \n&gt; the room first. Maybe making her leave Vlad alone out there was \nworse then \n&gt; he thought.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
