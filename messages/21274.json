First off, the bat-probes that Airly has.  \nAren&#39;t those illegal?  I mean, characters like that that can just be \nmanufactured continuously?  I&#39;m not sure, though.\n\nAnd then, I&#39;m confused about Airly&#39;s attacks with her characters. Airly, \nplease have your squads and such fire independently.  I don&#39;t know who is in \nthe Amazon Squad, or who&#39;s in Dragon&#39;s team.  Or who a &quot;repli-like shape&quot; is. \n You&#39;re gonna have to be a tad more specific.\n\nNow, I need Yanshosh to get online so I can discuss this and other stuff with \nhim.  But, I&#39;ve gotta leave in two hours, because I&#39;m going bowling and \nseeing &quot;Little Nicky&quot; with an older brother of mine.  That may take 3-4 \nhours.  Then when I get home I have to move a ton of wood around my house, \nwhich will take a couple hours.  Then I&#39;m going to have to fight with my \nbrother for control of an online server!  So, sorry, there&#39;s going to be a \nmass delay on my part.  I got to get ready now.  \n\nSo, I&#39;m going to have to ask that the battle be paused.  Though, I&#39;ve never \nseen a battle paused.  So, I&#39;m asking that you LEAVE Vehement and his base \nout of it.\n\nBecause I&#39;ll just be dumping all of my characters on Yan if he doesn&#39;t help \nsort this crap out.  But, Vehement is a new character full of agendas, same \nwith his two minions, and I can&#39;t give them to Yan.\n\nNow, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to write another e-mail to Yan telling him \nwhat all my characters do)\n\n\nLord Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n"}}
