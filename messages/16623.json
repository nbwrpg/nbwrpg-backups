She decided to wait to see what would \nhappen.  \n&gt;   She then had the thought of installing the chip in Cybershark, \nbut he \n&gt;   would have to be unconsious for that to happen.

He slipped into cloak mode and followed her down the \nhall.\n&gt;   &gt;     As soon as she stopped he stopped, he listened in on the \n&gt;   conversation and realized that something was terribly amiss here. \n&gt;   Battera was under some sort of mind control, he needed to \nconfront \n&gt;   Feline, but his power wasn&#39;t up to par. Instead he walked a \nlittle \n&gt;   bit away, decloaked and started to the CR Chambers. (They are in \nthe \n&gt;   same general area right?

She had one in HotRod, one in Battera.  She \nhad \n&gt;   only \n&gt;   &gt;   one chip left to install.  She picked up the chip and put in \nher \n&gt;   arm \n&gt;   &gt;   with the panel.

She didn&#39;t want to hand damaged goods over to \nZardus.  \n&gt;   She \n&gt;   &gt;   opened her link, &quot;Battera, could you come to the lab please?&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   She smiled.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Battera::\n&gt;   &gt;   She walked down the hall and to the lab,&quot;Yes, you called for \nme?&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Feline:: She opened her arm panel and activated the ship \ninside \n&gt;   &gt;   Battera.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Battera::\n&gt;   &gt;   She felt a surge of information flood her mind. She fell to \nthe \n&gt;   round \n&gt;   &gt;   shaking and then stood up as the chip took control of her.  \nShe \n&gt;   &gt;   looked at Feline. &quot;What is it that you want?&quot; she said in a \n&gt;   rather \n&gt;   &gt;   rough voice.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Feline::\n&gt;   &gt;   She smiled and walked up close to Battera.

You are to follow and obey Zardus now.

She headed to the entrance \nand \n&gt;   &gt;   stepped outside of the base.  She transformed into her bat \nmode \n&gt;   and \n&gt;   &gt;   took off towards the sky.  She had the distict feeling like \nshe \n&gt;   was \n&gt;   &gt;   finally finding her place. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   (The chip mostly changes the nature of the bot from maximal \nto \n&gt;   &gt;   Predacon.  All personallity chances from good natured to \nevil.  \n&gt;   And \n&gt;   &gt;   makes the bot prone to obeying who ever installed the chip. \nBut \n&gt;   it \n&gt;   &gt;   doesn&#39;t make them slaves completely)\n\n\n"}}
