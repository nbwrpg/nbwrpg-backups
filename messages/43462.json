In a bright flash \nthe head was gone and Unicron turned to a large stasis tube where the \nhead was now seemingly hovering inside.  But it was floating in a \nkind of liquid as cables seemed to come out of nowhere from inside \nthe tube and attach themselves to the decapitated head.\n\n/THIS WILL DO QUITE NICELY.  YOU ALL WILL NOT BE NEEDED FOR A LITTLE \nWHILE SO I GIVE YOU LEAVE TO DO WHATEVER YOU WISH/ Unicron said, all \nof the Brotherhood turning and leaving the command center of the Rana \nKao volcano that was the Brotherhood base.\n\n\n"}}
