She was disappointed that her shots hadn&#39;t hit, but she \nwould make sure that the next ones did.*\n\n&quot; Who said anything about nice?&quot;\n\n* She spoke to herself as Nightstrike came in on her position in Aurora jet \nmode.  But she quickly realized that she had basically been hitting the \nwrong bee hive when s5 charges began to raid down on her.*\n\n&quot; Slag!&quot;\n\n*  She jumped out of the way, landing on her back and skidding a littl ways, \nshaking her head and feeling the heat from explosions where&#39;d she has stood \nmoments before.  But it wasn&#39;t pver yet!\nWith more charges coming she rolled, jumped and skidded to avoid them.  She \nwas just about to stand when a charge she hadn&#39;t noticed exploded right in \nfront of her, blowing her back to skid along the turned up soil. But on \nimpact splitting pain shot up her arm as the lower part of it was blown \napart, leaving a stump that gushed fluid.\nShe crouched on the ground, holding what was left of her arm to her side. \nBut gritted her teeth and snapped her head up to glare at Nightstrike.\n&lt; He could finish me off like this!&gt;*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
