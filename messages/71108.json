It was as if Cycl=\r\nonus were some sort of dancer, or an agile bird of\nflight. Behind him his b=\r\noosters flared brightly as picked up speed!\n\nEven as he moved though, at th=\r\ne top of the jet a twin cannon turret spun,\norienting on Uproar and then wi=\r\nth a pause for target acquisition they opened\nup with twin plumes of corusc=\r\nating power!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Quickstride calibrates his large blast=\r\n cannon, and takes\ncareful aim at Waspinator. He chuckles under his breath.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Bye bye BUGGIE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His finger pulls back on the trigger, as he now=\r\n attempts to shoot\nWaspinator down.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWaspinator is not nearly so agi=\r\nle as Cyclonus in the air, nor is he built as\ndurable. But what he lacks in=\r\n these two qualities he makes up in tenacity\nand just foolish luck.

The battle was far from\nover as he righted himself and came back=\r\n at Quickstride, guns blazing!\n\nMeanwhile as Hydras and Inferno arrived at =\r\nthe door to the Ark, they found\nit closed, the massive doors clicking as th=\r\ney came to a stop. Getting into\nthe Ark would not be that easy. In fact it =\r\nwas to be much more difficult as\nQuicksilver, Airhammer and Noctorro, three=\r\n of the Maximal Fuzors, came\nflying in from one side, firing their weapons =\r\nat Hydras and Inferno as\nBantor, the other more land bound Fuzor leaped in =\r\nto attack Hydras again!\n\n\nAND SOME DISTANCE AWAY:\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap gri=\r\nns.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oooh yeah, good thinkn&#39;.

The area inside the forest is not as densely overgrown as\none migh=\r\nt imagine. With the canopy of trees over head blocking most of the\ndirect s=\r\nunlight, at ground level things are fairly clear, save for large and\nleafy =\r\ngrowths of ferns or other wild plants.\n\nThat does not mean that the ground =\r\nis flat, as large tree roots, stones and\nbroken ground break up the ground =\r\nmaking it treacherous for the unaware,\nmaking anything close to four wheel =\r\ntravel, even for those of Cybertronian\ndescent, extremely difficult and haz=\r\nardess. There is even the occasional\nlarge fallen tree here and there; sign=\r\ns that not even the tall spires of the\nforest are immune to the ravages of =\r\ntime and unforeseen occurrence.\n\nIn robot rode, Nightshift and Rat Trap can=\r\n still hear the movements of\nanimals all around them, birds still occasiona=\r\nlly fly up or make odd noises\nas they pass. There is the occasional foot pr=\r\nint and the obvious sounds of\npassage of large animals, some perhaps larger=\r\n than a school bus.\n\nShould these two desire to travel back the scene of Hy=\r\ndras=92 tower, it might\nbe possible, and maybe even safe from the sweeps th=\r\nat had chased them into\nthe forest, but that does not mean it will be easy =\r\nor quick.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\r\n--bcaec50162b1b6d6f2049fddf1f2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic sans ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;(OOC: I hope I got everything.=\r\n This is like writing 4 or 5 posts in one. =A0)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;comic sans ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic sa=\r\nns ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic sans ms,sans-se=\r\nrif&quot;&gt;INSIDE THE ARK:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Inside the Ark, =\r\nTucson makes his way toward Rodimus&#39;s position, while keeping close tab=\r\ns on the signal he&#39;s able to work with, as faint as it is.

Buzzing, much like a real wasp he flew in, dodging one blast, and t=\r\nhen another, until a third one catches him in a wing sending Waspinator roc=\r\nketing through the air like a cannon ball. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=\r\n=3D&quot;comic sans ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic san=\r\ns ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;=93Me Waspinator am tired of Maxibots beating on him.=94 W=\r\naspinator said as he was flung through the air. =93Waspinator TERRORIZE!=94=\r\n he said as he shifted into his transmetaled form, that of a fighter jet.
