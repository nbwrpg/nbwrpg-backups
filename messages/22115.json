And no I don&#39;t\nthink\n&gt; you&#39;re demonic.  There were many times when I wanted to kill my family.  I\n&gt; never did exactly.  Although they are all dead.  The first to go was my\n&gt; brother who died in a horrible accident.  I was very angry at my family by\n&gt; then and I convinced my mother it was her fault.  She eventually committed\n&gt; suicide.  My father followed shortly there after.  Did I mention I was\nonly\n&gt; an adolescent by that time?&quot;  She smiles at him and says &quot;But hey let&#39;s\nnot\n&gt; talk about our pasts, considering the fact that we are in our own pasts.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
