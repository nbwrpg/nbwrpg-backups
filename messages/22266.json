The ship will be \nwatching you closely, so be careful. Najah, you can stay and guard if \nyou wish. If not, go to the cargo bay underwater. Havoc and Repressor \nhave brought something in. There&#39;s also a Maximal in there that is \nbeing slagged by internal defences, so the ship won&#39;t let you through \nuntil its done with the Maximal.&quot;\n\nWith that Zardus turns and heads for the exit of the Iron Fist.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dachande&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Cerberus::\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Zardus,&quot; Cerberus said. &quot;I have now reached the Iron Fists \nposistion, any chance I could get a lift up?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
