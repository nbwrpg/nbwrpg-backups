Scour=\r\n the parameters of the Ark, and be sure no one gets in, Rodimus. I&#39;ll handl=\r\ne Nightrazor in here.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus looked at Tuscon, a look of complete=\r\n surprise on his face, =93What are you doing?=94 he said as he looked at Tu=\r\nscon and then at the weapon that was being pointed at Megatron. \n\n=93Tuscon=\r\n, Hydras is already retreating! LOOK!=94 he said, pointing at Hydras who ha=\r\nd picked up his fallen teammate and was already moving out of the Ark. \n\nAt=\r\n this same time Legacy also stepped into the room, coming from one of the b=\r\nack corridors into the front. As a guardian, it was his job, his internal d=\r\nirective to keep the Ark and all of its occupants safe, an imperative that =\r\nwould also include even the Decepticons that were to wake up several millio=\r\nn years later.\n\nLegacy=92s single optic pulsed as he took in the scene, Hyd=\r\nras leaving and Tuscon pointing a weapon at Megatron to ensure that he did =\r\nso. \n\n=93NONE OF THE ARK=92S OCCUPANTS ARE TO COME TO HARM.=94 Legacy said,=\r\n falling into his old coldly logical voice. His voice sounded nothing if no=\r\nt more formal, his tones frigid, his words clear as crystal, and his stance=\r\n firm and resolved. Legacy pointedly glanced at Straight Shot and then back=\r\n at Tuscon, =93TO PUT OUR FUTURE IN JEOPARDY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE IS NOT A=\r\nCCEPTABLE.=94 \n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; PErceptor gain control of the ark and activate=\r\n all the internal defences against the Hydra&#39;s predacons and tried to\n\n&lt;NEW=\r\n&gt;\n\nAs preceptor worked, the Ark began to respond to his commands as weapons=\r\n began to activate, internal defenses systems came online. \n\n=93What is you=\r\nr command?=94 Teletran 1 asked Perceptor. \n\n\nMEANWHILE IN THE MEDICAL BAY:\n=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightlight continue peacefully sleeping while Elita jumped on=\r\n the bed in her beast form and nuzzled in her mom&#39;s cheek while she cried i=\r\nn silence. \n&gt; &quot;Mommie&quot;said Elita&quot; I miss you so much... so much&quot;sobbed the =\r\nlittle girl while her tears fell in her mom&#39;s cheek\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nNightlight cont=\r\ninued to sleep, as all around her the machines registered her as resting in=\r\n a comma like state. All of her systems seemed otherwise in stable conditio=\r\nn. \n\nRamulus looked at Nightlight and Elita, a soft look on his face. \n\nThe=\r\nn Tuscon=92s voice boomed through, threatening the Predacons. =93SLAG!=94 R=\r\namulus said as he glanced back at Elita, =93You stay here.=94 Ramulus said.=\r\n =93I=92m going to lock you in and then go see if anything can be done for =\r\nour medical staff.=94 \n\nRamulus spoke as he quickly gathered up a few med p=\r\nacks and a scanner.\n=93Danged daft Predacons, causing so much damage.=94 Ra=\r\nmulus grumbled under his breath. Ramulus was no medic, but he did know a bi=\r\nt about first aid. Perhaps there was something he could so for Santon and B=\r\nump who were still lying on the floor of the corridors. Perhaps they were n=\r\not as . . . hurt as they looked. He couldn=92t even bring himself to think =\r\nof them as dead. \n\nWith a last look at Elita he left. The door clicked as h=\r\ne locked it and then the room that Elita was in went silent except for the =\r\ncomputer monitors that were watching over Nightlight. \n\nFor the moment all =\r\nwas peaceful in the medbay. \n\nHowever outside the Ark was a very different =\r\nmatter!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord and Kup keep their fire against Scourge and D=\r\neepstrike\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs the firefight continues Deepstryke took a hit, as did =\r\nScourge, forcing them to break off their attack on the door and swing up in=\r\nto the air to avoid any further and more critical damage. Several more of t=\r\nhe sweeps were blasted from the skies, the last one swinging up next to his=\r\n master Scourge, almost as if for protection. \n\nThe Predacons were looking =\r\ndecidedly more damaged and a bit more tired then before. Energon looked to =\r\nbe looking a bit lower than before and the shots from Windlord and Kup were=\r\n building up on them, not to mention the firepower coming from the fuzors a=\r\ns well as Leo II! Yes, the Predacons had breached the door, but getting fur=\r\nther in would be an uphill battle indeed, and many of them did not look to =\r\nbe in the best shape to fight it!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Outside, Quickstr=\r\nide quickly gets Uproar to his feet, and assesses the situation. He then lo=\r\noks around the parameters and then remembers a body of goop, that resembled=\r\n a tar pit, not far from the Ark&#39;s parameters. Uproar looks to him.\n\n&lt;SNIP/=\r\nCUT/PASTE&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Uproar and Quickstride now approach Deep Stryke and the oth=\r\ners with their hands up in submission. Quickstride is the first to approach=\r\n them.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDeepstryke hovered in the air as he noticed the two walked t=\r\nowards him, his cannons swiveling to track them when they spoke . . . \n\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nOLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Okay, okay, you got us, you got us. Why don&#39;t we just show you gu=\r\nys an easy way inta the ark hmm? That way we all get what we want and every=\r\none&#39;s happy.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n=93You, a Maximal would show a Predacon a way into hi=\r\ns own fortress?=94 Deepstryke said, obviously not believing the two for a m=\r\noment, and yet he didn=92t shoot at them either. Perhaps there was a part o=\r\nf him that WANTED to believe it. Then Hydras=92 call went out to retreat!\n\n=\r\n=93Blast you Maximal!=94 Deepstryke said as he began to pull back. =93NEXT =\r\nTIME we will breach your walls and TAKE what we want!=94\n\nThe Predacons beg=\r\nan to back up, moving into the air, slowly moving away from the Ark, even a=\r\ns the Ark=92s cannons and weaponry began to move and come online. \n\n(TAG)\n\n=\r\nPreston\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_000C_01CBFB19.2E0DED90\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n\n/* start of attachment style */\n=\r\n       .ygrp-photo-title{\n         clear: both;\n         font-size: smaller=\r\n;\n         height: 15px;\n         overflow: hidden;\n         text-align: ce=\r\nnter;\n         width: 75px;\n       }\n       div.ygrp-photo{\n         backgr=\r\nound-position: center;\n         background-repeat: no-repeat;\n         back=\r\nground-color: white;\n         border: 1px solid black;\n         height: 62p=\r\nx;\n         width: 62px;\n       }\n\n       div.photo-title \n         a,\n    =\r\n     div.photo-title a:active,\n         div.photo-title a:hover,\n         d=\r\niv.photo-title a:visited {\n           text-decoration: none; \n       }\n\n   =\r\n    div.attach-table div.attach-row {\n         clear: both;\n       }\n\n     =\r\n  div.attach-table div.attach-row div {\n         float: left;\n         /* m=\r\nargin: 2px;*/\n       }\n\n       p {\n         clear: both;\n         padding: =\r\n15px 0 3px 0;\n\t overflow: hidden;\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file {\n        =\r\n width: 30px;\n         valign: middle;\n       }\n       div.attach-table div=\r\n.attach-row div div a {\n         text-decoration: none;\n       }\n\n       di=\r\nv.attach-table div.attach-row div div span {\n         font-weight: normal;\n=\r\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file-title {\n         font-weight: bold;\n       }=\r\n\n /* end of attachment style */\n        --&gt;\n        &lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=\r\n=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp {\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n  font-family: A=\r\nrial;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp hr {\n  border: 1px =\r\nsolid #d8d8d8;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {\n  color: #628c2a;\n  font-size: 85%;\n  fon=\r\nt-weight: 700;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n =\r\n margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n  padding: 0 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad p=\r\n {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a {\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: n=\r\none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV \nstyle=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: normal; DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;=\r\n; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: n=\r\none&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt tahoma&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3 \nface=3DCalibri=\r\n&gt;HYDRAS/Perceptor/Elita/windlord/Kup/nightlight&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT siz=\r\ne=3D3 face=3DCalibri&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3 face=3DCalibri=\r\n&gt;Perceptor typed some commands and said =93tunr on \nthe external and intern=\r\nal defences...
