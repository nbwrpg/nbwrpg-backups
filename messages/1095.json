The\n&gt; majority of her life lead to hiding, running and fighting for her very\nlife.\n&gt; She charged a little ahead of Carnage.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Let me approach them first,&quot; she said, then made a limp to her walk,\n&gt; putting more appearance to her damage. She had to pull this off.\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked closer to the Ark, with her head down, walking to the main\n&gt; doorway of the ship. She had to know by now they could see her.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; You have a voice mail message waiting for you at iHello.com:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3555/10/_/_/_/957672542/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
