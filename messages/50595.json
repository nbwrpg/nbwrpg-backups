Vlady seems too... \n&gt; &gt; familiar for me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So barbaric, so Spheroid-like. To him, it was like wasting words \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; could be best kept. It was alien to him to be called so \nfamiliarly. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; did not feel comfortable with it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turned back to the others.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vlad: WHAT SAY YOU WARRIORS?

He thought of his options. He could start firing, \nbut \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not decided which group was the best to go with. Those Rogues \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; greater in number, but that did not prove anything. Ice \nHellion \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Warriors were many, and their prowess in combat did not \nreflect \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Tripredacus, on the other hand, seemed less organized, \neven \n&gt; &gt; &gt; though \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they seemed better armed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His declaration of being the object of the trial of possession \n&gt; &gt; &gt; might \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motivate them, but he harbored no illusions. He was a human, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; unknown \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to these machines. He had not proven himself, but was \nconfident \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be of some use.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then, there was this female robot. He did not know who she was \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which team she was in, but it seemed as though she had a clear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mission, maybe even unknown to her. There had to be a way he \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bring her with him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In all these options, running was not present. It was the \n&gt; cowards \n&gt; &gt; &gt; way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out, and Wolf Warriors were not cowards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or... yes...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He fired his two missile racks in the air and forty tiny \n&gt; &gt; explosions \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peppered the sky. He intended to make a show.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vlad: I AM KHAN VLADIMIR WARD OF CLAN WOLF. I DO NOT KNOW WHO \n&gt; YOU \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ARE, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BUT I RECOGNIZE YOUR VALUE AS WARRIORS. I SUGGEST A TEMPORARY \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CEASE-FIRE SO WE MAY DISCUSS BETTER AMONG EQUALS.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He knew the chances that the enemies see themselves as equals \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slim, but it was worth trying.\n\n\n"}}
