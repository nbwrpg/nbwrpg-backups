And may I remind you that normal faction rules \nsay that one player isn&#39;t supposed to possess more than 50% of a \nfaction? Besides, Torin was aimed too.\n\nBIC: Yggdrasil knew this was getting very nasty. He managed to fire \ntwice more with his particle canon before two bommerang blades dug \ndeep in his right arm. It started feeling numb and he dropped his gun. \nTorin&#39;s counterattack hit him hard in the abdomen. He tries to reach \nfor his barkskin shield to get some cover, but the blast from \nDevilcat&#39;s and Gatara&#39;s weapon throw him back, missing him by only \na few feet in front of him. He stands and is hit by Jayde&#39;s shot. He \nrises his shield and blocks Fury&#39;s venom shots and turns at Jayde and \nfires wildly his two machine guns.\n\nYggdrasil: Freaking preds of my slag!\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: All that artillery against a target that size, and all he took \n&gt; was a few scratches?  That&#39;s borderline moding, you know.  Nobody of \n&gt; that mass can be that agile - that&#39;s basic physics.  I&#39;ll let it go \n&gt; the first time, but remember that six (or seven, if Rauq ever wakes \n&gt; up) versus one is a virtually insurmountable handicap for any \n&gt; character that follows the rules of the RPG - your own rules.\n&gt; \n&gt; Torin throws himself to the ground, his next shot going wild.  Next \n&gt; to him, Fury lets out a wild, shrieking war cry and whips out his \n&gt; lashknife, sending the blade slashing out on its cable at the \nMaximal \n&gt; while firing more darts from his cybervenom gun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Devilcat takes to the air, letting loose with the powerful blasts of \n&gt; his subspace cannon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Riekan launches his boomerang arm-blades, reasoning that this \n&gt; outnumbered opponent can&#39;t dodge them coming and going and still put \n&gt; up a fight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jayde circles around to one side, trying to widen the crossfire \n&gt; Yggdrasil is facing by firing bursts from her nailgun at him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gatara shields her face with her arms as her hide is peppered by \n&gt; bullets.  It dings her up a little, but she&#39;s still ready for plenty \n&gt; more as she returns fire with her combination heavy machine \n&gt; gun/grenade launcher.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil watches as his plan fails utterly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: So much for passivity! Yggdrasil Prime, Maximize!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His thick tree bark hide reveals his robot form. He looks \n&gt; stunningly \n&gt; &gt; like Optimus Prime, but he seems less tolerant and far less \n&gt; cautious \n&gt; &gt; when it comes to fighting.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He opens fire with his two giant machine guns, mainly aiming \nGatara \n&gt; &gt; and Torin, and fires four shots of his particle gun. He dodges \nmost \n&gt; &gt; shots but still gets scratched over his chest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, intimidation tactics have little effect on the \n&gt; Rogue \n&gt; &gt; &gt; forces, with the lone exception of Jayde.  They&#39;ve all seen \n&gt; things \n&gt; &gt; &gt; much scarier than an attacking tree-creature, regardless of its \n&gt; &gt; size.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gatara, the closest Rogue (also the biggest), sees one tree \n&gt; headed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for her own noggin, but knocks it aside with a fist and squeezes \n&gt; &gt; both \n&gt; &gt; &gt; triggers on her weapon, sending both a hail of magnum bullets \nand \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; grenade at this ferocious enemy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Devilcat steps forward, allowing the falling timbers to bounce \n&gt; &gt; &gt; harmlessly off his force shield.  Then he retaliates with \nseveral \n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy bursts from his laser sword.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jayde yelps and scrambles back, looking for an opening to bring \n&gt; her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; own nailgun to bear.  Torin, Riekan, and Fury are out of reach \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil&#39;s initial attack, but they fight back anyhow: Torin \n&gt; fires \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his plasma blaster, Riekan launches an explosive harpoon, and \n&gt; Fury \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (after transforming) opens up with his cybervenom gun.\n\n\n"}}
