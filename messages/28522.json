I thought the number was considerably less.  Therefore I&#39;ll add \nthe damage to Unicron now.\n\nAnother thing, please excuse JP of anything rash at the Ramora.  He doesn&#39;t \nknow the defenses and I didn&#39;t make a list so there&#39;s nothing for him to go \non so he&#39;s kind of in the blue)\n \nVehement/Unicron/Sun Crusher/Reflector:\n\n\nUnicron didn&#39;t wait for the heathens he had fired upon to respond and blasted \nfull speed for the Ramora and slightly smiled as scanners detected incoming \nobjects.  He sent orders quickly two the two robots not under fire under his \ncommand.  He raised an arm, launching off a missile on an intercept course \nwith one of the missiles heading for him.\n\nThe movement of his arm slightly tore open a badly damaged piece of armor \nthat began trickling a light amount of green mech-fluid.  Unicron was in \npain, but didn&#39;t show it.  He knew it would affect his followers.  After all, \nwhat kind of god feels pain?  He was a foot from the shields and could feel \nthe intense heat, a square large enough to fit him (barely) in the shield \nopening up.  The ancient being passed through the hole, his followers in \nclose pursuit.\n\nThe Chaos-Bringer would&#39;ve sighed if he could.  He had not powered up since \nhe had been revived and upgraded his loyal followers.  He had not powered up \nsince he had taken possession of their bodies and aided Unitron in his \nnear-death experience.  He needed to rest, and the heathens wouldn&#39;t stop him.\n---\n\nVehement had used his access codes to override Hell Beast and make the \nrelatively small hole in the shield, and Vehement knew that Hell Beast could \nnot defeat the codes without extensive attempts to break a code based on a \nlong forgotten language that only existed in Brotherhood dogma.\n\nThree objects headed for him as he was a few feet from Unicron&#39;s feet, firing \noff two optic blasts at two of the incoming plasma blasts.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher fired off a five rapid optic blasts in a streak, three heading \nfor the last plasma blast, one for a missile, the other for another missile.\n\n---\n\nReflector watched Unicron pass through the hole in the shield and Vehement \nalmost completely pass through the shield right behind the supposed diety.  \nRaising his right wrist and launching two missiles from the double-barreled \ncannon attached to that appendage, two energy-signature seeking missiles \nstreaked out and split into seperate directions, one heading for Supernova \nand the other Vcyir.\n\n"}}
