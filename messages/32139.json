I&#39;m in a \nbig hurry right now, but my last post was with Mantle and the eletors \nforming Element and charging at Abominus and firing)\n\nElement slowed down, looking ahead at Abominus. He was running slightly \nslower, but he was still running. He carefully guided the missiles he had \nfired at Abominus&#39;s head, and then brought up a rifle and fired two shots \nfrom it. His spark was beating fast with excitement. He loved battle.\n\n\nCyndro saw that his attacks were coming close to hitting friends, so he \nconcentrated alot of his fire on the gestalts instead. Two missile launchers \naimed at each one, firing two missiles each at every enemy gestalt on the \nfield. The other defences all focused on the new enemies (KSLawdoggie&#39;s \ntroops :). EMP cannons, autogunfire, and an occasional missile shot out at \neach one. The jammer device was still fully funtional, and the Element&#39;s \nshields blazed with full power. The Maximals wouldn&#39;t lose this one.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
