Several bots seemed to be in conflict\nover...no it couldn&#39;t be. This couldn&#39;t be earth could it and that...That\ncould not be the ark of legend!\n\n    Transforming Xiane stood upon the hill a good distance from the battle\nbut began to run, he wasn&#39;t sure who was good or who was in the wrong but if\nthat was the ark it must be protected.\n\n    Tearing up the ground as he ran he drew one object then another. In his\nright fist he clenched a bladeless hilt, with a flick of a button his\nenergon sword flared to life, humming warmly in his fingers. The other\nobject was much like a door sheild yet the main face of it was empty until\nit too was turned on, an energy sheild filling the gaps to provide\nprotection.\n\n    Xiane arrived just as Spears was blasted from her spot behind the metal\nplate, kneeling down he examined the bot. &quot;Hail to thee m&#39;lady, it seems I\nfind myself on a battlefeild yet know not the very sides I face. By the\nmatrix speak what hast befallen here and speak true, is yonder the ark...?&quot;\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, August 15, 2000 8:30 PM\nSubject: Re: Attack on the Ark\n\n\n&gt; ::Spears/Shadow Wing::\n&gt;\n&gt; Spears::\n&gt; She shot hits the plate and it explodes, sending shrapnel into her\n&gt; body.

He was now upside down, facing Shadow Wing.
