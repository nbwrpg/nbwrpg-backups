He looks \naround, not seeing any other Autobots.  &quot;What has happened to them?&quot; \nhe thought.  He heard a transmission. And repied.  &quot;This is JetV..&quot; \nleaving a pause and lookin around for anysight of an \nAutobot. &quot;Commander of the Autobots on Earth.  Welcome&quot; the small bot \nsaid.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Skyburst::\n&gt; \n&gt; A small torpedo tube comes through the transwarp portal, and \ncrashes on\n&gt; Earth. It opens as a bot steps out. He is a camo painted helicoptor,\n&gt; wearing the Autobot logo. He had just come back online after being\n&gt; deactivated by Decepticons, not to long ago. He had learned that\n&gt; hundreds of years had passed. He found out about the Neo Beast \nWars, and\n&gt; had reconfigured himself to fit the modern day transformer.(The G1 \nto BW\n&gt; size problem, activation code, etc.) He set his communication \nsystem to\n&gt; record.\n&gt; &quot;To any Maximal or possibly Autobot forces in the neo Beast Wars, \nthis\n&gt; is the Autobot Skyburst. If you read me please make contact. I wish \nto\n&gt; join a Maximal or Autobot faction.&quot;\n&gt; He set the message to play looped on incoded Maximal and Autobot\n&gt; channels. He waited.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I would prefer him to join an Autobot group. Anyway he looks \nlike\n&gt; the Sandstorm Machine Wars toy.\n\n\n"}}
