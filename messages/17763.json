Gigatron is now a technorganic dragon, like TM2 Megatron, only \nmore balanced.  Windrazor&#39;s structure is completely rearranged and becomes a \ntechnorganic Wolf/Eagle Fuzor.  Terradive&#39;s super structure gets completely \nchanged to create a technorganic bat.  And Afterburner gets changed into a \nfalcon::\nGigatron: Wow, i feel so powerful!\nWindrazor: And balanced!\nTerradive: I was made to be a bat!\nAfterburner: Bird is my style!\n::Gigatron turns to child::\nGigatron: Thank you child.  Now what is the plan?  Are we going to attempt \nthe peace talks?\n\n"}}
