We&#39;re done here. Let&#39;s go.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix and Fliq are about to enter the shuttle, when a voice stops them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No one is going anywhere.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix and Fliq spin around to see a damaged bot, with a small hole in\n&gt; his head. Brix and Fliq recognize him at once.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gekki....Gekkidama?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s right. The one you left behind, Octociz. When that steel\n&gt; thing hit me in the head, I only went into Stasis lock.  You didn&#39;t\n&gt; even bother to check if I was dead.In about a week I woke up, and I\n&gt; was all alone.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;But...we needed to get out. There could have been another explosion,\n&gt; and we could&#39;ve all fried.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;THAT&#39;S NO EXCUSE FOR LEAVING ME STRANDED HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Gekkidama\n&gt; than looked to Ramulus, &quot;So....you guys have gotten a new friend.\n&gt; Well let me give you a warning. Don&#39;t get to know these guys. When\n&gt; you&#39;re hurt, they can abandon you, just like they did to me. It&#39;s too\n&gt; bad you got hooked up with them. You&#39;re innocent. You just wanted a\n&gt; little trip to the moon. But now Brix and Octociz have to pay. I&#39;ve\n&gt; been stranded here for months, and now WE&#39;RE ALL GONNA BE STUCK\n&gt; HERE!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Gekkidama pulled out his grenade launcher, and fired on at the\n&gt; shuttle.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;NO!!!!!!!!!(Using alot of exclamtion points in this post)&quot; Fliq dove\n&gt; into the grenade. It his his hand and exploded, causing his entire\n&gt; arm to fly off.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Fliq!&quot; Brix ran over to see Fliq. Mech fluid was pouring out, and he\n&gt; had gone into stasis lock.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oh...so Octociz has a new name now. Great...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix walked over to Ramulus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I hope you can fly. Get Fliq inside the shuttle and heat it up. Fliq\n&gt; needs medical attention, or he&#39;s gonna die. Give me 5 minutes. If I\n&gt; haven&#39;t finished this guy yet, take off. Don&#39;t look at me like that.\n&gt; When Fliq is healed and you&#39;ve removed the cargo you can come back\n&gt; for me. 5 minutes, no more.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix turned to Gekkidama\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Show time.....&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Savage\n&gt;\n&gt; Savage gets weaker as the bots shots continue to make holes in his\n&gt; hide. He thinks of a last second plan. He fakes another dive at\n&gt; Striker, but turns around and fires 2 fireballs and swings his tail\n&gt; repeadidly at the other bot standing on the cliff.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Zava\n&gt;\n&gt; Zava looks at the clock. 1:30 before Phobia&#39;s ship goes boom.
