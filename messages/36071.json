The firebot switched her\nweapon to burst to conserve fuel.  She stuck her head out from the debris\nshe was hiding behind and fired five heat bursts toward Swoop and  Artemis.\nIf she could get some pressure off the others there would still be a (slim)\nchance of success.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: robertdahl &lt;rdahl@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, May 31, 2001 7:53 AM\nSubject: Re: The bum and the hole...\n\n\n&gt; OOC: Well I just need to ad my opinion, I think the rule of interception\n&gt; is pretty useless, and poorly thought out. IMH it is much more\n&gt; interesting sometimes to intercept than to just dodge when you think you\n&gt; dont want to accept dammage. And Jeff, in the show they did intercept,\n&gt; ussually missiles with gun fire, but sometimes more powerful rays\n&gt; against each other. Megatron and Dinobots laser war from Double Dinobot\n&gt; comes to mind. In the original series, Slag even ignited a missile with\n&gt; his flame breath before it reached him, and I&#39;m not sure, but I think\n&gt; Inferno did it too.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
