But then she heard it, heard the words that she knew she was going to hear but didn&#39;t want to, &#39; it&#39;s finished.&#39;\nAs she watches Dark One toss the device to Nemesis Enforcer she amlost cries out with glee when it almost seems like he wouldn&#39;t catch it, then...HE CAUGHT IT!!!\nIron Raptor&#39;s face nearly turned to a panic but she kept it calm and blank, just the same what it would be when they planted that THING in her neck. But when it began, when the pain came...what would her expression be then? She could tallerate aome amounts of pain but she didn&#39;t know if she could handle this until she felt it. Though she really didn&#39;t want to.\nWhen Nemesis Enforcer then turned to her she pressed as hard as she could against the wall, almost willing it to cave in and save her from this event.\nBut as she heard his words she then glared at him, her back still pressing.\nNo reaction, no answer. That was what he was going to get out of her.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
