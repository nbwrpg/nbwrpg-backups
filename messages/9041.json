He \ntakes in a breath as Iron Raptor clings to him, his mind once again \nwandering, thinking of how she felt pressed to him. She smelled pretty good \ntoo...\n\nHe snaps his mind back to the battle as two discs sink into his leg, a \nmissile hitting him in the back. He recovers from plummeting down at the \ntrees, rising once again in altitude.\n\n&quot;My balance is just fine,&quot; he says, stopping suddenly in the air, a few shots \npassing in front of him, as well as Reptilica. Prowl aims his gun, firing a \nshot at the bot&#39;s jetpack. The shot hits, Reptilica screaming as he drops \ndown toward the forest, his jetpack going out.\n\nHe\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus enters the Alliance base, recieving Double Punch&#39;s transmission.\n\n&quot;Very well,&quot; he replies, then setting his comm-link to transmit to all \nAlliance members, &quot;Everyone, try not to kill the Predacons too much. Unless \nthey fire on you or you really want to.&quot;\n\nHe continues to walk down the hallway. It was no concern to him what happened \nat the battle, just as long as there were some casualties.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike continues to run at Dinobot, firing.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMosquitor, too dumb to realize that the Alliance was also going at the \nMaximals, fires his acid at Scattershot, flying at the Alliance bot.\n\n"}}
