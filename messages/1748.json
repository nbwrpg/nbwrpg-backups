He wore and Egyptian Headset that flowed down his shoulders and was \ntopped of with a hissing Cobra. :::\n\n:: Set :: Alright, theyre in there. I want you to watch them carefully while \nIm gone getting this...transmetal 2 tech box. Its important.\n\n::: Ra slammed his right Pheniox talon agianst his chest and bowed. His huge \nred wings were folded behinde his back like red armor. ::: \n\n::: Ra ::: Yes Master Set. I will do as you ask.\n\n::: Set then stared into his bright orange eyes, and left Ra as he entered \nthe holding chamber. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron, in his blank proto-form, watched the large bot walk across the \nroom and sit at a control station. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast, from across the hall ::: Who are you? Did Set bring a small \narmy with him?\n\n::: Ra said with a brisk, sharp voice ::: I am his army!\n\n::: With the flick of a few buttons, a red force feild lit up and Hell Beast, \nMegatron, and Jackle fell to the ground in severe pain. :::\n\n::: Ra ::: There will be no talking, not on my watch.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Set transformed into his Puma beastmode and headed for the Predacon base, \nto get the techbox. :::\n\n"}}
