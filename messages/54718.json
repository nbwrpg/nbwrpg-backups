He slid across the ground as his \n&gt; ship \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stopped.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             When he stopped and got up he checked \n&gt; &gt; himself \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was in full \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operation, just his good looks were damaged. He walked \n&gt; &gt; back \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ship to look. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was in bad shape, his face had been ripped apart, \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; visor over his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ocular systems. Now everyone could see the protoform \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; underneath, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the red eye \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that turned and looked. His faceplate was smashed and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dented, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;windshield&quot; chest was broken, so one could see the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shoulder \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; joints on the &gt; inside. All in all he looked like some \n&gt; sort \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; robot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sent back from the future, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to change the future. His arm was a bit ripped up too, \n&gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could live with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             Luckily for him, the communications boxes \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pods were nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible. He would need it to talk to the other \n&gt; &gt; bots. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First though was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus and Hydra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             &quot;Rodimus Prime,&quot; he started, with \n&gt; &gt; disgust, &quot;and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one known as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydra. I have a message for you. Magnus is dead. He \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to stop \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me. But he was unsuccessful. I am requesting a meeting \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of you, at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these coordinates. [Punches in coordinates] Know that \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide to betray my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trust and come with soldiers, I will kill all of you. \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know�&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             With that he cut off the transmission and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; waited, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; checking over his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guns�.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
