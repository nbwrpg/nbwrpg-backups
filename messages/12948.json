I don&#39;t know \nwhat it is for you guys in the states, I thought it was like 21 or \nsomething. But I live in Canada, and the age limit for drinking is \n18. I had only turned 18 in February, so I&#39;m glad he was born after \nFebruary. Man....I ate some cake for you guys like you asked Logo. \nYou should have seen my brother....I won&#39;t even go there. )\n\n\n&quot;Whoo hoo!!!!!!&quot; Yelled Fliq as Brix went faster as they rushed \nacross Asia towards Tibet, &quot;This is great!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah!
