Or they \nmight think that you&#39;re more like Liono then they thought.&quot;\n\n* Iron glared at Iris.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m nothing like him. I care about them and I don&#39;t send them out on \npointless missions, for one.&quot;\n\n* Iris shrugged*\n\n&quot; True. But still, a bored bot is one ready to cause a problem.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor growled.*\n\n&quot; Who asked you?&quot;\n\n* Iris wasn&#39;t impressed.*\n\n&quot; That time of the month already?&quot;\n\n* Iron rolled her eyes and shook her head, continuing on her way.\nIris only shrugged*\n\n&quot; Well? You&#39;ve been biting everyone&#39;s ass lately. What else am I supposed to \nthink?&quot;\n\n* Irin entered into the CF.*\n\n&quot; It&#39;s just been bad times.&quot;\n\n* Iris lifted a brow.*\n\n&quot; Is it that..........or is it the fact that the stress from the battles has \nbeen getting to you?&quot;\n\n* Iron sighed.*\n\n&quot; That too.&quot;\n\nIris: &quot; No vacations, no time alone with your guy, I guess I can understand \nthe bitching now.&quot;\n\nIr: &quot; I&#39;m trying.&quot;\n\nIris: &quot; No one ever said you weren&#39;t. Command is a pain in the tail. But it \nhas it&#39;s up sides too.&quot;\n\nIR:&quot; Like what? Trying to get a cease fire and have a quarter of your troops \ndisobay a chance for peace just because they think that killing is more \nimportant?&quot;\n\nIris: &quot; There are people like that no metter where you look. You just have \nto get use to them.&quot;\n\nIr: &quot; I guess. But now there&#39;s this idea that Prowl&#39;s got.&quot;\n\nIris: &quot; The city, I know. You don&#39;t like it?&quot;\n\nIr: &quot; Not really.&quot;\n\nIris: &quot; Bigger target for the enemy?&quot;\n\nIr: &quot; Exactly. They said that the CF was supposed to be mega strong \ntoo...and see what happened?&quot;\n\nIris: &quot; Then it&#39;ll be their mistake,  they&#39;ll have to pay for it.&quot;\n\nIr: &quot; Yeah, but I&#39;m worried. I mean, I feel like I&#39;m the one looking out for \nthem all and if something happens I&#39;ll be horrid about it.&quot;\n\n* Iris chuckled.*\n\nIris: &quot; You sound like a mother hen.&quot;\n\nIr: &quot; Well, I try.&quot;\n\n* By this time both of them had reached the controle room, both entering \nwith the door closing behind them.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
