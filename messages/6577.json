I&#39;m gethering vitle data about the new ship for my \nLord Hell Beast. Infultrating the base and figuring out their weapons, how \nthey work, weaknesses in the shields, security systems and all.&quot;\n\n* After answering Perndabot&#39;s question she then began to continue in the \ndirection the the new Maximal base, taking the lead but taking care to let \nher hips swing a bit. Wondering that with all her comments towards him, if \nPerndabot was going to say anything towards her.\nIt had been so long since she had last heard a comment on her looks, Gangon \nbeing the first and last bot that had ever said anything.\nBut with him gone she felt a bit...unappresiated.\nWith all her loyalty towards Hell Beast he didn&#39;t once reward her for it, \njust simply wanting a pat on the back or an encuraging word. But nothing.\nNobot ever even noticing her, except in battle when they were trying to kill \nher!\nBut now she found someone who she actually liked, fairly much. But he was on \nthe wrong side, if he were a Predacon then things would be much better.\nBut without any words towards her from him then she just didn&#39;t know if he \nliked her...besides his wondering optics.\nBrightBlade sighed but then nearly gasped when she suddenly saw a flash of \nlight.\nBlinking a few times she stopped in her tracks and squinted, finally \nnoticing that it was a spark!\nShe quickly scanned it, turning out to be Gangon&#39;s spark she smiled at it.\nThough to make sure she then spoke.*\n\n&quot; Gangon? &quot;\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
