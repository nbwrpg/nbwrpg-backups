It could be hear from \nthe rythmeous banging against the metal of the base. Looking past \nQuasar, Quickstrike stood up. He hear voices down the cooridor that \nsounded urgent to his audios. He stepped towards the frame of the \ndoorway, listening in. He could feel the offspring eyeing him.\n\n&quot;Ah think there&#39;s somethin&#39; goin&#39; on,&quot; he said to the two \nfemales. &quot;Ah&#39;m gonna go check it out. Be right back.&quot; He walked out, \na little relieved to get away, but still wanting to go back to Black \nArachnia.\n\n\n"}}
