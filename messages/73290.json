If\nthere was a casual observer here in these dark and unknown places it\nwould look like two dolls made of iron and steel bouncing  and\nclanging in the dense darkness.\n\nThat is until both of them fell through the air and then splashed into\npitch black waters, steam rising from the once placid surface.\n\nFinally dark forms rose from the waters and stumbled onto land, one\nlarger than the other.\n\n&quot;It is you!&quot; The smaller of the two forms said, fear in his voice.\n\nThere was a dark chuckle from the larger of the two, &quot;It would seem we\nare both full of surprises.&quot; Lights flickered from the chest of the\nlarger one brightening the room for a moment and revealing his dark\nchassis and scarred visage - it was NEMESIS PRIME.\n\nHe looked down at the other dark figure, even in this light he was\nstill black and silver loking almost exactly like the old RODIMUS\nPRIME save for the color. It was DARK RODIMUS!\n\n&quot;I believe you have moved on from being the twin of that Maximal do\ngooder.&quot; NEMESIS said. &quot;Shall I call you by his moniker?&quot;\n\nThe dark figure nodded and smiled darkly, &quot;No, call me Bane, for that\nis what I shall be.&quot;\n\nNEMESIS nodded, &quot;We will have to work together to get out of here.&quot;\n\nThere was a pause from BANE and then he looked one way and then the\nother. &quot;That way.&quot; he said as if some internal voice were speaking to\nhim.\n\nNEMESIS nodded and then both figures transformed into vehicular mode\nand began traveling along the side of the underground waters.\n\n(TBC)\n\n"}}
