The score \nis \n&gt; &gt; 106 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; the Ballers and 102 for the Gorrilaz.  The story so far has \n&gt; been \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play by Gorzo.  Gorzo, A rookie from Crystal University =\r\nis \n30 \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 34 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shots made.  10 3-pointers and 15 dunk=\r\ns for a total of 50 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; points.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But can the last rank Gorril=\r\naz with the help of Gorzo beat \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rank Ballers?=\r\n  Lets go down to the court to see what \n&gt; happens.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nCourt Side Announcer:  Hello, we have 20 secounds left in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; game.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Gorrilaz are passing in the ball as we speak.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A bot wearing a jersey that says &quot;Bentals&quot; passes the bal=\r\nl \nin \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bot wearing a jersey thats says &quot;Gorzo&quot;.  G=\r\norzo Dribbles the \n&gt; &gt; ball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down the court and passes it to a bo=\r\nt with a jersey that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; says &quot;Bob&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bob then passe=\r\ns it to Bentals and Bentals passes it a bot \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; j=\r\nersey that says &quot;Micko&quot;.  Micko passes the ball to Bentals \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Bentals passes it to Gorzo.  Gorzo steps up to the 3-point \n&gt; line \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jumps up making it look like a jump shot.  At the last \nsec=\r\nond \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passes it to a jumping bot, which is by the goal, whos=\r\ne \n&gt; jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned then slams the ball for an Alley-=\r\nop(SP?). \n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bots \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a different jersey grab the ball.  T=\r\nhe bots jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reads &quot;Feller&quot;.  Feller passes the ball in to a b=\r\not with a \n&gt; &gt; jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which read &quot;Rauq&quot;.  (Time to make Rauq loo=\r\nk Stupid.)  Rauq \n&gt; &gt; starts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dribbiling the ball down court when=\r\n he trips over his own \n&gt; feet. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ball leaves his=\r\n hands and rolls into Gorzo hands.  Gorzo, \nwho \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standing b=\r\nehind the 3-point line and takes a jump shot.  The \n&gt; &gt; ball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sai=\r\nls into the hoop as the Buzzers sounds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Court Side Ann=\r\nouncer:  HOLY RUST POCKET, THE GORRILAZ WIN \n107-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 106.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TH=\r\nE GORRILAZ WIN!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;5 Years Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; The Bot that was wearing the Gorzo jersey 5 years earlier \nwas \n&gt; in \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small 2 person shuttle.
