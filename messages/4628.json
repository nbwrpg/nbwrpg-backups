It&#39;s what my scientists back on Cybertron \ncould think of when they created the machine. I am not realted to the \nDecpticons or the Autobots. I am more closely related to the Quintessions. \nAlthough it is not as if I am a direct desendant.\n    &quot;For the second question, we are against both Maximal and Predacon. I do \nnot want to destroy them completly, but I would like to change their forms to \nbe my own. And those that refuse will be allowed to exist, but they will be \nmonitored, this is all once I control Cybertron.\n    &quot;Now as soon as Bobertron comes out of the CR chamber I will change him. \nJust so you can see exactly what happens.&quot;\n\n"}}
