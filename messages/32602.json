I just checked out what eGroups says about Jer&#39;s\n&gt; status. He has too much stuff on his Yahoo email. Yahoo only allowes 6\n&gt; megs per used, and if he exeeds that (which is what eGroups says is\n&gt; the prob), he can&#39;t get more mail. My recommendation is just doing\n&gt; everything from the site and setting him on Web Only/No Mail, but he\n&gt; could also clear out his Yahoo inbox.\n&gt; \n&gt; PS. I unbounced his bounced status, so if it was just Yahoo messing up\n&gt; and accidently saying that he was over or something, he can post\n&gt; again. If his account is really over 6 megs, then he&#39;ll still have to\n&gt; clean it out.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Email is bouncing messages&quot; means that his mail recieving server\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t working great, and the messages don&#39;t get through and get\n&gt; &gt; &quot;bounced&quot; back at the sending server (which is eGroups in this case).\n&gt; &gt; The easiest way to solve this is to post straight from the eGroups\n&gt; &gt; site. Its faster, more reliable, and you don&#39;t have to rely on your\n&gt; &gt; email that way. Here&#39;s how you do it:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. First, get a Yahoo ID, or if you have one, make sure you know the\n&gt; &gt; ID and pass.\n&gt; &gt; 2. Goto http://groups.yahoo.com/convwiz , fill out your email address\n&gt; &gt; and eGroups password (if you don&#39;t know the egroups password, fill out\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;forgot password&quot; thing and they&#39;ll email you a reactivation\n&gt; &gt; number which you can use to change your pass from the site. After you\n&gt; &gt; fill out your email and pass, it&#39;ll ask you for your Yahoo ID and the\n&gt; &gt; password for it, and you fill that out too. Follow whatever additional\n&gt; &gt; instructions it throws at you, and you should have your email linked\n&gt; &gt; to your ID.\n&gt; &gt; 3. Log into your email through eGroups at\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/login.cgi .\n&gt; &gt; 4. There should be a link called NBWRPG on the left side of the page\n&gt; &gt; you get after logging in, under the &quot;My Groups&quot; section. Click on it.\n&gt; &gt; 5. When the main eGroups page for NBW loads up, click on the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Messages&quot; link to the left. You can read messages and reply to them\n&gt; &gt; from the site, as well as start new posts, and vote in the polls.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can also skip steps 4 and 5 by going straight to\n&gt; &gt; http://egroups.com/messages/nbwrpg\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; An alternate solution is to just wait for the mail server to get\n&gt; &gt; better, which can take quite a while.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jer wanted me to ask ppl what &quot;email is bouncing messages&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean because he can&#39;t post (again) due to that error, and he  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t know how to solve it.
