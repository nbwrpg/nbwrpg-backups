So far\n&gt; she was just telling him things he already knew. He leans forward\n&gt; when she finishes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The planet is, or was, very rich in energon. It attracted the\n&gt; attention of Megatron, and a Maximal crew followed him. That crew was\n&gt; carrying stasis pods, and some of those left up in space are still\n&gt; falling to the ground. But war itself attracts warriors, so the\n&gt; planet continues to be a battleground.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He glances around the walls for a second. Ironically enough, the\n&gt; Conference rooms, ideally places for bots to come together and\n&gt; cooperate, were the most heavily defended rooms in the Iron Fist,\n&gt; aside from the engine room and the bridge.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;But how did you get to the planet? When DevilDuer recruited you, he\n&gt; simply found you in a forest, or you found him. There isn&#39;t any\n&gt; information on how you got here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk enters the conference room and steps to a table. she\n&gt; remains\n&gt; &gt; standing waiting for Zardus to follow before taking a seat. &quot;I came\n&gt; to this\n&gt; &gt; planet because it showed a high concentration of Translife signs.\n&gt; from what\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen from your records I was correct.&quot;  she pulled her seat\n&gt; forward\n&gt; &gt; interlocking her mands on the table top. The bot leaned\n&gt; forward, &quot;It seemed\n&gt; &gt; like a good place to continue DNA research.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to\n&gt; reveal her\n&gt; &gt; true intentions but could see she was at a disadvantage. Zardus\n&gt; seemed to\n&gt; &gt; have to sure of himself. The royal bird could see it in his\n&gt; manner. &quot;What is\n&gt; &gt; the attraction to this place? it seems to be a graveyard for stasis\n&gt; &gt; pods?&quot;she commented hoping to adjust the subject to her advantage.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
