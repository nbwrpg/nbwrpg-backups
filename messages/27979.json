The Alliance is currently \nfighting for the Maximals, not against.\n\n::FZ/Prowl::\n\nOne of the missiles hits FZ, the explosion sending him out of the way \nof the laser shots and fireballs. One of the fireballs hits the other \nmissiles, detonating it. He growls.\n\n&quot;I&#39;d attack your enemies instead of your friends,&quot; he tells Angel \nPrime, firing two of his missiles at Unicron. He doesn&#39;t wait for \nthem to hit, instead he passes the abort command, the missiles \nexploding in the draining energy field when they get close to Unicron.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl spins out of the way of several shots, some hitting him but \ndoing almost no damage. He detonates the missiles with two well-\nplaced blasts and looks down (he&#39;s flying) at a Maximal that just \nlanded near him.\n\n&quot;I could use some. And if Angel Prime is your friend over there, \nplease tell him to fire at the enemy, it..&quot;\n\nWhatever else Prowl was going to say was lost as he felt a surge of \nemotion from Iron Raptor. Rage, excitement, reawakening, everything \nwas filled in it. It was uncontrollable! Prowl&#39;s body spasms in the \nair, his armored wings extending suddently. His legs grow next, \nfollowed by his whole body extending. The whole procedure was painful \nand uncontrollable. Prowl&#39;s head flips into his body, a different one \nreplacing it, one that was a mix of IR&#39;s second beast mode head and \nthat of an owl. Feathers emerge through his armor, leaving him a \ngiant 20-foot tall creature with wings and armor, feathers sticking \nthrough the cracks in it. His roar rose into the air a second after \nIR&#39;s, like an answer to her roar. The creature that Prowl now was \nrose on his back legs, looking around for a target.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Prodigey child&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Angel Prime/Starwind/Rattrap/Steed/Blade Runner/Depth Charge\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Angel Prime flew over and saw FZ. he has been waiting longer then \nFZ thinks. \n&gt; Angel Prime fires six fireballs at FZ.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap and Steed jumped out of Starwind.
