In fact, he realized just \nthen \n&gt; they had cloaking abilities. The harpoon exploded on his thigh but \n&gt; hardly did more than to shed some armor off. He swung his \nautocannon \n&gt; in line with the newly appeared Riekan and let go a double shot \nalong \n&gt; with his two large lasers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar: Maximals! They have more troops coming in, but these have \n&gt; cloaking devices! Be careful!\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other side of the battlefield, Katya barely escaped the \n&gt; tentacles of the pumpkin bot. Her speed did help her greatly and \nshe \n&gt; soon was meters away from him. She aimed at the two nearest \nappendages \n&gt; and tried to fry them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: Stravag! Katya to Ragnar and Rodimus, I am being engaged. \nThe \n&gt; hit-and-run will have to wait a bit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Katya, I&#39;m coming to assist...\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: Neg! He is mine!

The shot forces him to decloak, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; he retains most of the element of surprise.\n\n\n"}}
