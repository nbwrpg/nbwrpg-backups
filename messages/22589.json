Travelling back and forth from there to\nAfrica always made him nervous. &quot;Remember, we&#39;re flying through Predacon\nairspace so remain quiet. None of us can fly and fight at the same time so\nwe&#39;ll be moving at top speed through there.&quot;  He stared at Razor Claw, he\ndidn&#39;t know how to handle the Predacon on thier side, he hoped that it\nwouldn&#39;t come down to a fight between them. Ice was the leader now so he had\nto accept it. She was now his superior. &quot;Ready to lift off when you are\nboss.&quot;\n\nRazor Claw wasn&#39;t to fond of having to go into a Maximal ship without any\nenergy weapons. Veratis didn&#39;t believe in such things.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, November 29, 2000 8:12 AM\nSubject: (ALL MAXIMALS READ) Re: Why attack? / Maximal Meeting\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She smiled as Lunarpine stroked her back. She still felt like she was\n&gt; out of her league.  &quot;Well, confidence isn&#39;t easily gained. But I will\n&gt; do my best.&quot;  She turned and walked outside. She went to the pod and\n&gt; walked in.  She had never flown one before. She looked at the\n&gt; controls and sighed. &quot;Anyone knw how to fly one of these things?&quot; She\n&gt; ahd never needed to fly a pod before. She had always had her own\n&gt; wings to use to get around. She nervously sat down in the pilot seat\n&gt; and looked at the controls, studying them.  &quot;Well, let&#39;s try this\n&gt; then.&quot; She grabbed the joystick in her hand and moved it forward.\n&gt; nothing happened.  She pressed a few buttons on the console. nothing\n&gt; happened.  She was starting to get frustrated. &quot;DARN IT, START!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Her anger triggered her telekenetic powers to start up the engines\n&gt; and start up the thruster. &quot;Hey, now how did that happen? I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; even trying.&quot;  She looked as the console lights flickered and\n&gt; listened to the roar of the engines. &quot;Wow.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine saw the worried look on her face. He followed her\n&gt; outside, &quot;He\n&gt; &gt; made the right decision, your abilities give you an advantage we\n&gt; could never\n&gt; &gt; have.&quot; He knew that she&#39;d never led before, but now she had an\n&gt; edge. If\n&gt; &gt; she&#39;d stop thinking like a recon bot. &quot;I&#39;ll be at your side when\n&gt; the time\n&gt; &gt; comes. I&#39;ve got confidence in you.&quot; he smiled and pet het along her\n&gt; back.\n&gt; &gt; She was no longer a typical recon bot she was now a prototype for\n&gt; Veratis&#39;\n&gt; &gt; new life. She is now stronger than she was, faster than she was,\n&gt; and even\n&gt; &gt; more powerfull than she was. If she got her confidence up she&#39;d be\n&gt; able to\n&gt; &gt; lead as well as the rest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC did I tell you that Icebirds function happens to be mutant\n&gt; commander?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BIC Veratis radiod ahead to the compartment where the maximal\n&gt; transport pod\n&gt; &gt; was kept.&quot; Razor Claw, Ice, and Lunarpine will be there shortly.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers tinkered with the control settings. He knew better than\n&gt; to take\n&gt; &gt; chances of showing his face at the CF again without good reason.\n&gt; He&#39;d stolen\n&gt; &gt; from them and he was sure that they wouldn&#39;t be happy about it.\n&gt; &gt; He completed the preflight checklist and doublechecked the\n&gt; coordinates, &quot;All\n&gt; &gt; set, they can lift off whenever they&#39;re ready.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Razor Claw was outfitted with a DNA collector. The device was a\n&gt; probe\n&gt; &gt; extending from the hand, attached internally to a power supply box\n&gt; equipped\n&gt; &gt; with transmitter, the information from anybody he touched would be\n&gt; sent\n&gt; &gt; directly back to Veratis. The plan was brilliant.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
