Her optical scanners showed more\n&gt; activity than an all you can eat resteraunt near a fat farm.  She\n&gt; instinctively cloaked to hide her identity. She now appeared to be no\nlarger\n&gt; than a sparrow. She  took extra measures by flying low to the ground\nmaking\n&gt; herself appear to be an even more natural bird. The hawk landed on the\n&gt; charred Spanish shore and scanned outward into the horizon. What she saw\n&gt; scared her. She detected a warship docked near an island miles offshore.\nShe\n&gt; saw the shield surrounding the base and knew that she was in for more than\n&gt; she knew. She tried to transform but a twinge of pain shot through her.\nShe\n&gt; tried again transforming to robot mode. She could see that the fur of her\n&gt; wolf mode, and feathers of her hawk mode hadn&#39;t changed like they had\n&gt; before. The femm placed a recorder under part of the charred beach and set\n&gt; the message. &quot;I&#39;ve reached the shoreline, I&#39;m not sure if this is the\nright\n&gt; place but it&#39;s security is very detailed. I&#39;m going in, I&#39;ll report next\n&gt; time I get the chance.&quot; the bot didn&#39;t leave a name, she didn&#39;t want to\nlose\n&gt; any advantage if the message was intercepted. &quot;Relay message in one hour.&quot;\n&gt; She left the instructions to allow her enough time to get away in case\nit&#39;s\n&gt; found or intercepted.  Silver Scout again transformed to hawk mode and\n&gt; started flying out to sea.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 13, 2001 10:41 PM\n&gt; Subject: BlackFortress\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dragonfly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dragonfly saw Blacknightmare and Orchestra left the room. &quot;Well&quot; said\n&gt; &gt; the male to Crater&quot;What do you rather? stay in base and rest or have\n&gt; &gt; agood fight?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
