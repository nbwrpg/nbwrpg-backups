Computer, spark scan in a radius of 300 miles \nfrom here.\n\nThe holoscreen projected a detailed map of the region and showed three \nsparks at the center.\n\nBelthassan:\n(with a smile) I knew I could count on you!\n\nMelchana entered the room, her training session obviously having helped to \nmanage her fury.\n\nMelchana:\nOkay, I found the problem about the diversion core. I&#39;ll skip \ntechnicalities, the main thing is that it&#39;s out of order for a while. We&#39;ll \nhave to replace it entirely. If the shield are online, though, they&#39;d still \nbe able to prevent damages.\n\nBelthassan:\nGreat job, both of you! Now, I&#39;ll contact Zardus and try to make a deal with \nhim. Computer, open a frequency with the Alliance.\nThis message is destined to Zardus of the Alliance. I am Belthassan, leader \nof the Prophets and Tripredacus officer in command of the Earth stage of \noperation. As you have met my friend and colleague Daemos, I suggest that \nour two factions ally. I think we have many points in common and that we \ncould provide many benefits to each other.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
