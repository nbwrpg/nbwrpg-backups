She was torn. She wasn&#39;t sure what to do. She growled at herself, that Dinobot tone returning to her throat. She had to leave, but she didn&#39;t want to. She thought as this forest as the safest place in the world. Megatron never knew she was here and she never saw his fliers Terrorsaur or Waspinator searching for her. \n&lt;P&gt;She ducked her head and continued to pace. The sky was fading to a dark, the stars beginning to turn, with the air slowly cooling. The night was coming. \n&lt;P&gt;Cyber Claw didn&#39;t pay it no mind for a short while. She was focused on her confused state of mind. She threw herself to the ground, screaming in anger. She kicked her feet up and thumped her head across the dirt. She was known as many things, and the Mad Raptor was one of them. \n&lt;P&gt;I&#39;ll kill him! she screamed in her mind. He&#39;ll pay. For all he did, he&#39;ll pay! \n&lt;P&gt;&quot;&lt;EM&gt;Why have you done this to me&lt;/EM&gt;?&quot; she screamed into the air, shrilly. She held her head, bringing her legs to her body. She kept still for a moment. Maybe she was better off dead. Or was she? She was a bot, deserving of a life. &quot;&lt;EM&gt;Megatron&lt;/EM&gt;!&quot; Her voice was more feminine that time. The majority of the time she scared the bots that knew Dinobot. \n&lt;P&gt;Cyber Claw moaned to herself, upset. After a few seconds, she pulled herself off from the ground and slowly walked towards a eroded drop off. She kicked and pushed leaves and branches to it and made a weak nest. She laid on it and pulled the branches towards her body, covering it, so she half-way camouflaged herself to the area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
