She fell into a \ndeep sleep as her body started to chage from the virus.  Her body \nstarted to reformat.  It was loosing it&#39;s robotic properties and \nstarted to become more organic.  She was becoming more bear and owl \nthan tranformer.  Her only robotic feature was her head.  Her body \nchanged, it had a metal skeleton, but the rest of her was organic.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis stepped back, recoiling from the sight of Shadow Wing \nlashing out.\n&gt; The CR chamber sensed the struggling and released a sedative into \nthe fluid\n&gt; surrounding Shadow Wing. that would calm her down and reduce the \nchance of\n&gt; damage to either her or the chamber. The down side was that the \nsedative was\n&gt; now another factor in the virus. he knew that mixxing chemicals was \na bad\n&gt; idea, especially when one doesn&#39;t know the result of the first \nfactor.\n&gt; Veratis stepped back to the sensors and watched carefully for the \nresults of\n&gt; the virus.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
