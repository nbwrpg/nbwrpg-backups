He \n&gt; opened the kit and took out a screwdriver, a wrench, and some small \nspare \n&gt; parts (screws, bolts, etc.)  He proceeds to open a storage \ncompartment in his \n&gt; left arm.  When it is open he finds he already has those things \nbuilt in.  He \n&gt; tosses the ones from the tool kit over his shoulder.  He also finds \na pair of \n&gt; goggles that serve to both protect his optics and scan for tiny \nbreaks in the \n&gt; connection.  He looks at his right arm and finds a small soldering \niron built \n&gt; in.  He stands up and walks back to the bridge.  He puts the \ngoggles on and \n&gt; inspects the panel again.  He finds many minute breaks which he \nrepairs \n&gt; quickly.  Might as well fix the parts before he gets power back up.\n&gt; \n&gt;     He begins tracing the connection back to the generator.  He \nfinally finds \n&gt; the break and repairs it.  As he does this the ship comes back to \nlife.  His \n&gt; job done he looses focus and stares into space.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt;     He hears a noise inside the ship and sees light inside the \nbase.  He runs \n&gt; in after seeing Nightlight&#39;s wounds.  He goes down the hall to the \nmed lab.  \n&gt; He gently places Nightlight into the CR chamber he had brought from \nPerplex&#39;s \n&gt; ship.  He then sits down to wait.\n\n\n"}}
