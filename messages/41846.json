He\n&gt; must have a circuit loose in his head, he would have to get it \nchecked\n&gt; by Switchblade later. That he did not relish. He pulled himself up, \nand\n&gt; stood, creaking his neck. He looked at his two soldiers, then back \nat\n&gt; the screen.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There must be a good reason those traitors stayed around the battle\n&gt; field, we must go investigate, Dominjoe, transform.&quot; he ordered, as \nhe\n&gt; himself leapt to the air, folding and shrinking into his gun mode,\n&gt; falling towards Blindchaos. &lt;Easier to transport me this way no :)&gt;\n******\n\n::DOMNIJOE AND BLINDCHAOS::\n\n    Blindchaos transformed and eagerly caught his commander in his \nankylosaur mouth. He was very gentle as he arched into the air and \ntried hard not to drool on Megatron when he captured the Decepticon.\n    Domnijoe transformed and allowed both Decepticons into her cockpit \nbefore speeding off at her max speed. She was a black seeker with \nsilver weapons.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n*****************\n\n\n"}}
