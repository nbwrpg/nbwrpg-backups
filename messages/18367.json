The\n&gt; scientist gathered DNA samples and injected them into the translife \non my\n&gt; old planet. They destroyed the insecticons and saved the planet \nfrom being a\n&gt; buffet.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to give up to much information about her \norigin so\n&gt; she turned back to the Dna readouts.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I hope to save and restore other planets that have suffered at \ntranslife\n&gt; hands, I feel we owe the universe that much for the damage done in \nthe great\n&gt; wars.&quot; She studied the samples more closely &quot;Perhaps these two \nanimals\n&gt; aren&#39;t the best example but it&#39;s just a sample for Zardus to see.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 17, 2000 6:46 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: To make a long story short (To late) Part 2\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She nodded.  She didn&#39;t know what this bot was up to, but the \nwhole\n&gt; &gt; idea wasn&#39;t all that bad. &quot;So your not going to destroy the\n&gt; &gt; ecosystem, mearly help it along so both bot and naute can \ncoexist?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She smiled. &quot;I had never seen that done before, but if it is\n&gt; &gt; possable, that nature and bot can exist in harmony like that, I&#39;d \nbe\n&gt; &gt; glad to help try.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She smiled and showed her willingness to help.  But her mind was\n&gt; &gt; trying to figure out what this bot was really up to.  This bot \nwasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; what she appeared to be.  There was something that LadyHawk was\n&gt; &gt; hiding.   But she couldn&#39;t quite figure it out.  She wondered why\n&gt; &gt; this bot, who knew all this knowledge was having her do most of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; work? Then it came to her, LadyHawk didn&#39;t know it all.  But \nthen, if\n&gt; &gt; she didn&#39;t know, why pretend to know.  To save her tail feathers?\n&gt; &gt; Most llikely.  But for now, Squizzy would play along and find out \nall\n&gt; &gt; she could.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lady Hawk was startled by the revelation.
