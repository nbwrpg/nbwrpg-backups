Hell \nBeast was tugging on the lease that was attached to her collar.  Hell \nBeast laughed evilly as she cried, mourning the loss of her \nfriends.  &quot;YOu have caused me no end of trouble, you conspired with \nothers to go against me.&quot;  She spoke between sobs,&quot;I didn&#39;t. I fled \nlike a coward, but I didn&#39;t raise a hand against you.&quot;\nHe laughed,&quot;Of course not. I never gave you the chance. Now you will \npay for your crimes.&quot;  She cried and looked up at him,&quot;You already \nhave hurt more than youu could ever know just by hurting my friends.&quot;\n\nShe cried in her sleep.\n\nHell Beast laughed and drew out a red hot sword and started to touch \nher with the hot blade. It burned and seered the skin. She screamed \nout in pain and tried to get away from him.  He only pulled her \ntowards him and burned her again with the hot blade. &quot;You will stay \nin the pit with me for eternity.  you shall endure more pain and \nsuffering than anyone.  I shall enjoy hearing you scream and plead \nfor your miserable life. But then, if your here, you must be dead.&quot;\nShe screamed out,&quot;NOOOOOOOO!!!!&quot; as Hell Beast laughed at her.  \n\nShe muttered in her sleep,&quot;noooo.&quot;\n\nThen Hell Beast started to change and morph into something else.  It \nwas Vulios.  He sneered at her and pulled hard on the leash.  She \nfell to the ground before him.  &quot;You weak, sniveling, whimpering \nworm. You left me to die at Hell Beast&#39;s hands and didn&#39;t even try to \nsave me. Now you will pay for your cowardess.&quot;  He raised up a large \ncannon and shot her. She fell to the ground and gasped for breath.  \nShe cried and looked up at Vulios, who now looked very \ndemonic. &quot;Please, Vulios, I din&#39;t mean to...I..I..&quot; she tried to \ncatch her breath, but he fired again.\n\nHer body twitched and she muttered in her sleep,&quot;vulios..no..&quot;\nHer head jerked at the same time she got shot in her dream. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;David Torrey&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::CyberShark::\n&gt; \n&gt;     He ran up to Battera when she called his name. He held her with \nhis only hand. (His other is a blade) He looked at her. Then he \nlooked a Vulois, they both seemed to be having nightmares. He \nwondered if he should pull the plug.\n\n\n\n"}}
