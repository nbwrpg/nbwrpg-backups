He... isn&#39;t quite Firedrill \nanymore, he&#39;s now Anachronox and he has joined the Tripreds.&quot;\n\nCrossroads listens with intent, and his eyes widden as he hears the \nstory. &quot;Are you heading over there now?\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; replies Pacifix, &quot;I need to see whether I can bring back \nAnachronox as Firedrill.

I&#39;ll have to find him.&gt; Pacifix \nturns \n&gt; &gt; and walks towards the exit of the control room.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Crossroads nods, &quot;I think so, he was anxious to find out how \n&gt; &gt; Firedrill was doing.
