He \n&gt; struggles to stay standing and yells to his Autobots, &quot;If they are \n&gt; leaving, let them leave, we don&#39;t want to attract any unwanted \n&gt; attention.&quot; He goes to one knee, but slowly begins to recover.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swoop exits the base, and gains some altitude. He curves around \n&gt; and fires two missiles at Tremmor, then before he can fire another \n&gt; round, Pacifix&#39;s words hit him. Reluctantly, he heads over to \n&gt; Grimlock and remains airborn, circling around him. &quot;Me Swoop \n&gt; want to crush Decepticons...&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Afterburner speeds out of the base, transforms and starts firing on \n&gt; Caliburst. &quot;I&#39;ll knock the idiot out of the sky.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nosecone still hasn&#39;t gotten out of the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot runs out in time to here Pacifix&#39;s words, he motions \nfor \n&gt; the Technobots to ceasefire and return to base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Crossroads watches Grimlock but is reluctant to fire, he waits for \n&gt; Pacifix to continue expecting someone to get a spy mission. He \n&gt; doesn&#39;t know how Grimlock will react, but he expects the worst.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix doesn&#39;t dissapoint Crossroads. After recovering from the \n&gt; destablizer, he gives new orders, &quot;Ok, sicne we&#39;ve been found, \n&gt; there are new orders. Artemis, follow those two Decepticons to \n&gt; their base. As soon as you find their base, return to me and \nreport. \n&gt; Technobots, we need those base defenses up NOW. Grimlock, \n&gt; you and your dinobots will be needed to make sure that the \n&gt; Technobots get the defenses up quickly, and withough \n&gt; harrasement. Crossroads, you go with Grimlock. Repugnus, I want \n&gt; you to hide on that mountain over there,&quot; He indicates one of the \n&gt; northerly mountains surrounding the Autobot crash site, &quot;and act \n&gt; as a sentry until the base has been set up. Dion, watch the ship, \n&gt; and make sure that nothing sneaks in. Hoist is inside fixing the \n&gt; ship&#39;s onboard computers and we need those up and running. JetV, \n&gt; are you ok?&quot; He quieries the damaged bot. Noticing Crotale&#39;s \n&gt; anxious looks, he consoles the bot, &quot;Don&#39;t worry Crotale you&#39;ll get \n&gt; your chance later. Right now, you&#39;re with me, we&#39;re going to find \n&gt; out wha-- HEY!&quot; Pacifix spots Beachcomber and automaticly \n&gt; recognizes him, for who is is. &quot;Beachcomber! We weren&#39;t sure if \n&gt; you and your group were still here. Where are Firedrill and \n&gt; Cliffjumper? Oh, nevermind,&quot; He says as he spots Cliffjumper. &quot;Are \n&gt; you ok?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ooC: Note that those missiles in the episodes went into the water \n&gt; and didn&#39;t start already underwater at a significant depth.\n&gt; \n&gt; On 23 Jul 2001, at 14:14, gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Crotale followed out behind Pacifix, eager to show his skill in \n&gt; &gt; battle.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Slag roared out right beside his dino bot leader. &quot;Lets burn them \nto\n&gt; &gt; shreds Grimlock. &quot;  He said shooting a blast of fire at Tremor.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; JetV crouched behind a hill.  &quot;Aww, my back&quot; he said said, slowly\n&gt; &gt; taking out his rifle and shooting four blasts at Slugslinger.\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n----\n&gt; &gt; ----------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tremor looked at the bots coming out of hte ship. Not thinking \n&gt; &gt; about the odds he faced began shooting.  Firing fourblast of his\n&gt; &gt; Gyroscopic destabilizer at Pacifix, Artemis, Dion, and another \nstray\n&gt; &gt; shot whizzing at Slugslinger.  &quot;Die all of you , hhahaha&quot; he said \nas\n&gt; &gt; he fired his plasma rifle at the Technobots, one shot at each.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
