At first examination they see its \nsmack in the middle of the jungle, and then see a small round door in the \nground.\n    &quot;What in the world is this? Paralysis, go in and look around.&quot; Aracnia \nsaid as she looked at the mysterious symbol on the door. \n    Paralysis did as he was told, undid the loid, and climed down a dark \nladder. He reached the bottom to find a long corridor with doors on both \nsides. At the end of the hall way was a triangle shaped room. Scattered about \nwhere skeletons of someking of aliens with four arms.\n    He entered the triangle room and realized that this must have been \nsomekind of early alien settlement and observation station. It was big enough \nto serve there needs, and was deep underground.\n    He climbed back up and reported to Aracnia.\n\n    &quot;Interesting. Alright, everyone, were moving in! Tarantulas and Paralysis \nwill begin construction on autoguns and a sheild generator. The rest of you \nkeep watch. When Quickstrike gets here we will begin a further exploration of \nthe bunker.&quot; She commanded.\n    With that the groups broke off and began there projects. The Maximal \nprisoners  were tied to a thick tree with energon bands. Soon they would be \nmoved in and the Predacon Bunker would be operational.\n\n"}}
