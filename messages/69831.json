Man, someone got up on the wrong side of the recover berth this morn&#39;n..&quot;\n\nLegacy was about to ignore the last of the Autobot&#39;s comment when he\nnoted that this supposed Autobot was actually transmitting a\nDecepticon energy signature. For a long moment Legacy examined the\nsensor reading. He looked over at Talon as he transmitted over the\nMaximal and Autobot frequencies, &quot;There is a Decepticon energy\nsignature detected in close proximity of this base! I would suggest .\n. . Strange, the energy signature has now become a Maximal one.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: I would have done more, but Nightshift had already left the base\nand is already at the Ark, before Legacy could respond to the (false)\nDecepticon threat. :)\n\nI wish you would have said that in the first post and then slowed that\ndown a bit, then we could all have had some fun with the\nDecepticon/Autobot signature confusion thing, it would have been great\nRP for a few posts. :)\n\nHowever I did want to give some sort of response. &gt;:)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
