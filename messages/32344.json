The explosion under him sends him flipping through\n&gt; the air, but he stabolizes himself and flies upward. Aiming at\n&gt; Vehement again, he fires two seeking missiles from his shoulder and\n&gt; four EMP blasts from his rifle, these blasts spread out so it would\n&gt; be harder for Vehement to dodge.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; EndBringer roars, firing a missile at four missiles fired at him. The\n&gt; missile explodes, taking out the four. He jumps to the side as\n&gt; another missiles nearly hits him, and then is hit by one more,\n&gt; sending him flipping to the ground near Imprisoner. He roars, jumping\n&gt; up.\n&gt;\n&gt; Seeing Imrisoner, EndBringer lashes out with his tentacles while\n&gt; jumping at the bot, trying to grab him in his tentacles.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Zardus spins in the air, several rapid-fire rounds passing near him.\n&gt; He aims and fires back at Unitron, two energy draining missiles,\n&gt; along with two normal ones, flying for the bot.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Incarcinator saw the orb heading for him long before it was even\n&gt; close, and easily flew out of the way. He adjusts the color of the\n&gt; metal he was made of so that he&#39;d be transparent, and nearly\n&gt; impossible to see considering how high in the air he was. The bot\n&gt; growls, firing shell after shell down at Demon Wulf, Unitron, and\n&gt; Shockwave.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scyther smiles, watching an explosion take place under him. He had\n&gt; been flying up ever since he fired, and was now well out of range.\n&gt;\n&gt; Taking out a device from a storage compartment, Scyther taps a few\n&gt; buttons on it and tosses it at Injector. The device stays cloaked as\n&gt; it leaves Scyther&#39;s cloaking field. It was a cloaked grenade.\n&gt;\n&gt; Landing noiselessly near Injector, the grenade waits one second\n&gt; before it goes off, making a large explosion. Scyther fires two\n&gt; charges down at Injector, knowing that he would be distracted due to\n&gt; the explosion.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Demise turns his hand, grabbing Flesh Ripper&#39;s in it and avoiding the\n&gt; claws aimed at it as his other hand graps Flesh Ripper&#39;s torso. He\n&gt; tugs with all his strength on the arm, knowing that he had enough\n&gt; power to rip bots apart.\n&gt;\n&gt; Flesh Ripper&#39;s other slash hits his stomach, scratching the armor but\n&gt; doing nothing more.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl was going to fast for the lasers to hit, but he noticed massive\n&gt; firepower heading for the CF. In the back of his mind, the part that\n&gt; was still Prowl, he smiles to himself.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster watches all the firepower hit the sheilds. Soon they would\n&gt; probably drop, but the CF&#39;s outer shell was nearly prepared by now.\n&gt; He knew it would be able to stand up to the beating even without the\n&gt; shields.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (I&#39;m still waiting for Orchid&#39;s response, but by request of Yan\n&gt; I&#39;ll post\n&gt; &gt; anyways.

Teufel.  In a language\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; Earth (German) &quot;teufel&quot; meant &quot;devil&quot;.  It didn&#39;t really fit the\n&gt; nature of\n&gt; &gt; this newest addition to the Brotherhood ranks.  The Chaos-Bringer\n&gt; just liked\n&gt; &gt; the sound.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At first glance, most would say Teufel was rather bland and nothing\n&gt; special.\n&gt; &gt; At a second and closer glance, the assumptions would be confirmed.\n&gt; His body\n&gt; &gt; was armored above average, and a few cannons were hidden inside his\n&gt; frame.\n&gt; &gt; He was far from defenseless.  Just featureless.  It looked like he\n&gt; had no\n&gt; &gt; mouth, audio receptors, &#39;nose&#39;, or optics.  No sign of a beast or\n&gt; alternate\n&gt; &gt; mode.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Teufel, arm your missiles.  In a while we will arrive at the\n&gt; battle and aid\n&gt; &gt; my followers.&quot; Unicron ordered.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Understood.&quot; a bland, monotone and overall boring voice replied.\n&gt; A robot\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t want to get into a long conversation with someone with a\n&gt; voice like\n&gt; &gt; that.  It&#39;d be...just plain to boring.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ===\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Demon Wulf was struck by a few laser bolts and growled, but he was\n&gt; close to\n&gt; &gt; merging.  He fired a widespread of flames from his mouth,\n&gt; intercepting four\n&gt; &gt; missiles heading for him from Silverbolt and Depth Charge.  The\n&gt; resulting\n&gt; &gt; explosions sent some light flames and small amount of shrapnel at\n&gt; Demon Wulf,\n&gt; &gt; but the Vok creation ignored it to the best of his abilities.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He raised his sword, firing off an energy-signature seeking missile\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; Silverbolt&#39;s abdomen.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Flesh Ripper saw the inbound Demise and chuckled, slashing out with\n&gt; his right\n&gt; &gt; arm&#39;s, his claws out and ready to show why exactly he had been\n&gt; named &quot;Flesh\n&gt; &gt; Ripper&quot; (hence his claws are above the average animals...) at\n&gt; Demise&#39;s right\n&gt; &gt; hand (assuming he&#39;s reaching with both arms).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Simultaneously with his left arm he slashed diagonally up at the\n&gt; Predacon&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; abs, the boosters in his feet charging up quickly ready to blast\n&gt; off at top\n&gt; &gt; speed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dark Claw felt several shots hit him, yet he continued, rising in\n&gt; the air\n&gt; &gt; rapidly in his biped form.  In his right hand formed a black orb of\n&gt; energy\n&gt; &gt; with the destructive capability of a charge.  The Vok threw the orb\n&gt; down\n&gt; &gt; towards Incarninator.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dark One had reached Hiss, and discontinued his firing upon Demon\n&gt; Wulf\n&gt; &gt; because of the ineffectiveness and the task before him.  &quot;Hold on\n&gt; you idiot.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; he chuckled to Hiss, taking out a few basic repair tools, getting\n&gt; to work on\n&gt; &gt; Hiss, hoping no one would be cheap.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Breakdown pushed up, five rapid optic blasts piercing into his\n&gt; shoulder and\n&gt; &gt; two more into his right pec.  He stumbled back in pain, cursing and\n&gt; returning\n&gt; &gt; fire with three optic blasts at the insect bot, making his way\n&gt; towards Dark\n&gt; &gt; One.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pyro cursed as his shots did absolutely nothing to Abominus.  Of\n&gt; course, if\n&gt; &gt; his fire balls didn&#39;t hurt Vehement, they certainly weren&#39;t going\n&gt; to hurt a\n&gt; &gt; &#39;bot two or three times bigger than the Brotherhood leader.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, slag!&quot; he yelled, jumping quickly, the laser blast from\n&gt; Abominus leavin&#39;\n&gt; &gt; a crater and sending Pyro flipping through the air, landing on his\n&gt; right arm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hiss and Scavenger remained down for the count and in stasis lock.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (Gonna wait for Rdhal to get back to continue fight between Hot\n&gt; Spot and\n&gt; &gt; Headstrong)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Groove looked to Abominous and if he could&#39;ve would&#39;ve crapped in\n&gt; his pants.\n&gt; &gt; Stunned with fear, the shot from the Decepticon gestalt struck him\n&gt; dead on,\n&gt; &gt; sending him flipping back a dozen feet and crashing down.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He had a large gash in his chest and he stood still, trying to\n&gt; recollect his\n&gt; &gt; thoughts that seemed slightly out of reach.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Blades saw Groove&#39;s predicament and pulled off his attack.  He\n&gt; armed his\n&gt; &gt; fourteen missile tube and launched off four missiles at Abominous&#39;\n&gt; cervix.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First Aid remained a charred mess.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Streetwise dived to his right, landing on his side and rolling.  As\n&gt; he rolled\n&gt; &gt; he fired off four blasts from his photon pistol.  He intercepted\n&gt; two incoming\n&gt; &gt; missiles, one nearly hitting him and sending shrapnel into his\n&gt; face.  He let\n&gt; &gt; out a yell and stopped rolling, covering his face.  A missile\n&gt; struck him in\n&gt; &gt; the back and he went limp for a second.  Then he started twitching\n&gt; as he\n&gt; &gt; started to save strength for a second wind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Blasts strike Imprisoner and his entire frame shakes.  &quot;Idiots.  I\n&gt; doubt\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;ve even caught on by now.&quot; he said to himself.  He noticed the\n&gt; tide of\n&gt; &gt; battle, but didn&#39;t want to completely give himself away.  Until he\n&gt; noticed an\n&gt; &gt; insignificant robot open fire on Choran.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He armed his launchers, firing off four more missiles at the\n&gt; Cybertronian\n&gt; &gt; Fire as he did an intense scan to determine the strength of the\n&gt; shields.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The cannon on his form swiveled, firing off three blasts at Prowl.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Predator painfully got to his feet, firing off two rockets at the\n&gt; &gt; Cybertronian Fire.  Weapons fire struck him and almost knocked him\n&gt; off\n&gt; &gt; balance but he stayed on his feet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Choran saw incoming missiles and simply fired off five rapid optic\n&gt; blasts to\n&gt; &gt; intercept them.  He raised his rifle, firing off twenty rapid laser\n&gt; blasts at\n&gt; &gt; Depth Charge&#39;s torso.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shockwave was interested.  Everyone was going at a relatively less\n&gt; important\n&gt; &gt; warrior.  Unitron.  Since no one fired at him other than easily\n&gt; dodgable\n&gt; &gt; autogun fire, he decided to aid his comrade in arms.  He armed four\n&gt; flares,\n&gt; &gt; launching them off to intercept weapons fire.  One intercepted\n&gt; Incarcinator&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; shells.  One missed its target.  One going off prematurely to take\n&gt; out\n&gt; &gt; Zardus&#39; missiles.  And the last but not least destroying the\n&gt; missiles heading\n&gt; &gt; for Sun Crusher.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He armed his own missile launchers, tired of saving fellow\n&gt; Decepticons who\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t handle things themselves.  He launched off two missiles at\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Cybertronian Fire, logic telling him victory was within his grasp.\n&gt; Once the\n&gt; &gt; shields fell, it would all be over for the ship.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Autogun fire raked along the fire-red space fighter&#39;s frame doing\n&gt; little\n&gt; &gt; damage, and a flare from the same fighter intercepted two seeking\n&gt; missiles\n&gt; &gt; from the Element.  He armed his launchers, firing off two energy-\n&gt; signature\n&gt; &gt; seeking missiles at Endbringer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From his nosecone ten rapid laser blasts erupted as he rolled\n&gt; through the\n&gt; &gt; air, the energy heading for the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unitron&#39;s worries were down quite a bit when all that was heading\n&gt; for him was\n&gt; &gt; fifty rounds.  He dived down and did a barrel roll, several shells\n&gt; embedded\n&gt; &gt; into his wing and frame but not hitting anything to vital.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A blast from another enemy pierced through his back dorsal fins and\n&gt; hurt his\n&gt; &gt; velocity, but he was still fast as lightning striking the ground\n&gt; again and\n&gt; &gt; again.  He fired off twenty-five rapid laser blasts at Zardus&#39;\n&gt; pelvis.  He\n&gt; &gt; launched one energy-signature seeking missile at Killfest and\n&gt; another heading\n&gt; &gt; for Rhinox.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Beeline fired ten rapid blasts from its optics, only intercepting\n&gt; three\n&gt; &gt; charges inbound for its creator.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Double Punch felt a charge striking him in the back, but he held\n&gt; his ground.\n&gt; &gt; He turned around with a deep pain in his chest as some kind of\n&gt; liquid leaked\n&gt; &gt; down his back.  He raised his scorpion tail.  Using visuals from\n&gt; Beeline, he\n&gt; &gt; was able to deduce almost exactly where the cloaked enemy was if he\n&gt; hadn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; moved.  He raised both pinchers, firing off four missiles so that\n&gt; the area\n&gt; &gt; where the cloaked enemy was would be the center.  The resulting pre-\n&gt; mature\n&gt; &gt; explosions from his missiles would hit that area and anything in a\n&gt; 20 yrd\n&gt; &gt; radius (including up and down).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He began modifying his scanners internally to try and at least get\n&gt; a fringe\n&gt; &gt; like affect for his attacker at least.  He made a note to add an\n&gt; upgrade to\n&gt; &gt; his optic sensors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Injector felt a few optic blasts impact and he flew back through\n&gt; the air\n&gt; &gt; slightly.  &quot;Slagger.&quot; he yelled, firing down two stinger missiles\n&gt; at the very\n&gt; &gt; temporarily downed Breakdown.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manterror shook from shots as his exo-skeleton took all the hits.\n&gt; He cursed\n&gt; &gt; in rage, firing off two ion disks from both arms.  Two ion disks\n&gt; headed for\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor, the other two for the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Smokescreen looked to the Predacon, Killfest, and noted he was\n&gt; firing at\n&gt; &gt; Vehement.  He powered up his optics, ready to open fire, but\n&gt; stopped.  He\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t take on Vehement alone, and whoever was firing on Vehement\n&gt; would be\n&gt; &gt; helpful.  He would only take down Vehement&#39;s attacker when Vehement\n&gt; himself\n&gt; &gt; were down.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He raised his rifle, getting a clear shot on Vehement, who still\n&gt; hadn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; noticed the Warrior of Light.  Smokescreen would wait for the\n&gt; perfect moment,\n&gt; &gt; when Vehement replied to Killfest&#39;s attack with a barrage of deadly\n&gt; force.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vehement slid through the air gracefully, a missile and the EMP\n&gt; bolt going by\n&gt; &gt; him.  He swung his left arm, piercing through the missile and\n&gt; causing it to\n&gt; &gt; explode.  It charred from his left hand&#39;s fingertips to the\n&gt; forearm.  There\n&gt; &gt; were even some shrapnel pieces stuck in him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He ignored it though, raising his right arm that had a large barrel\n&gt; where a\n&gt; &gt; hand, forearm, and elbow should be.  He launched off two energy-\n&gt; signature\n&gt; &gt; seeking missiles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He raised his left arm, a near invisible sonic wave shooting out at\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sun Crusher watched missiles heading for him get intercepted and he\n&gt; simply\n&gt; &gt; sighed.  It was a test of endurance, this battle.  He didn&#39;t need\n&gt; heathens\n&gt; &gt; helping him.  He raised both arms, launching four missiles down at\n&gt; EndBringer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Reflector laughed at Streetwise.  &quot;Take that heathen dog!&quot; he\n&gt; yelled, filling\n&gt; &gt; with laughter.  He raised his right arm, the double-barreled weapon\n&gt; attached\n&gt; &gt; to it launching off two missiles from each barrel.  Four missiles\n&gt; spread out,\n&gt; &gt; two energy-signature seeking missiles heading for Killfest.  The\n&gt; other two\n&gt; &gt; missiles were regular missiles that headed for the Cybertronian\n&gt; Fire.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scattershot flew hard left, easily avoiding the behemoth,\n&gt; Abominous&#39;, shot.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hm.&quot; he said, reaching into subspace for the appropriate weapon of\n&gt; &gt; destructive capability.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nemesis Enforcer touched down to the ground, rifle aimed at\n&gt; Serpentor&#39;s neck\n&gt; &gt; as he began walking towards his enemy.  He fired a few shots, but\n&gt; the snake\n&gt; &gt; rolled out of the way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As he adjusted his aim, Serpentor threw his plasma launcher at\n&gt; Nemesis.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The plasma launcher soared true, striking Nemesis dead on in the\n&gt; face and\n&gt; &gt; sending him sprawling back.  &quot;Take that batman!&quot; he hissed,\n&gt; reaching into\n&gt; &gt; subspace and taking out his sword.  He walked briskly towards\n&gt; Nemesis\n&gt; &gt; Enforcer, sword at the ready to slice down and decapitate a robot.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
