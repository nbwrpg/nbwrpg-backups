She was flattened \nagainst the ground and pummled by shrapnel and debrie.  The concusion \nfrom the explosion knocked her out cold.\n\nShe woke up a little while later.  The Preds had left, the maximals \nwere gone.  She slowly rose to her knees and looked around.  SHe was \nthe only one left that she could see.  She raised her hands to her \nhead.  She had a large gash in the back of her head and her ears were \nringing.  She had shrapnel in her back and int he back of her legs.  \nShe got up slowly and walked away from the cave.  She walked towards \nthe trees.  Her vision blurred and she fell to the ground.  She \nopened her link,&quot;Paralysis,  I..I..I&quot;  SHe passed out, laying in a \ngrowing puddle of her own mech fluid.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron and Waspinator had walked a day and a half and had \nfinally \n&gt; reached the end of the mirky swamps. Now, streaching before them \nwas a vast \n&gt; forest that rested at the foothills of a large mountian, a mountian \nwhich, \n&gt; when climed, would take them to Adrax and Autofire.\n&gt;     &quot;Waspinator! Transform into beast mode....i dont want any \nunsuspected \n&gt; visitors arriving.&quot; He said, as he transformed.\n&gt;     The wasp did as he was told, and together in beast modes they \nstarted to \n&gt; gain altitude as they came closer to the mountian.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Paralysis was knocked clear of the explosion, as was \nAerostreak. \n&gt; Unfortunetly for Grappler and Guantix, they were killed. The fire \nraged on, \n&gt; and soon a few trees nearby were engulfed.\n&gt;     &quot;Aerostreak! Hey! Get up! We need to get out of here!&quot; \nParalysis yelled \n&gt; and a few trees came crashing down around them. The heat became so \nintense \n&gt; his armor started to bubble.\n&gt;     The Hawlk was in sheer sadness over the death of his brother \nand sister, \n&gt; who know lay baking under a burning tree. Paralysis grabbed him, \nthrew him \n&gt; over his shoulder, and ran as fast as he could out of the forest.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aracnia and Tarantulas had made great progress on the Bunker \nwhile the \n&gt; troops were gone. The shiled was working, as were the Autoguns. The \nspiders \n&gt; cleaned out most of the rooms, destroyed the garbage and useless \nitems in \n&gt; there, and buitl a lab and wepons locker, and also quarters. They \nhad been \n&gt; expecting more troops, unaware that Phobia had came and saved the \nday....so \n&gt; to speak.\n&gt;     Black Aracnia walked down the main corridor and entered the new \nCommand \n&gt; Room. Scince this base was not a ship, it could not be called a \nbridge. \n&gt; Although, further exploration of the delapidated regions of the \nbunker might \n&gt; provide a hanger or missle silo where ships could come and go. As \nthe doors \n&gt; slid open, she was greeted by a slew of new Predacon Computer and \nseveral \n&gt; floating viewing screens as well as the Command Chair.\n&gt;     &quot;Tarantulas, use the scanners to locate out team.&quot; She \ncommanded, taking \n&gt; her seat and looking to the Radar screen to her left. On it \nappeared a global \n&gt; map and scattered dots.\n&gt;     He rhasped back to her, &quot;Paralysis and Aerostreak are en route \nback here, \n&gt; as is Quickstrike. Darkmouse, according to my data, is still at the \nbattle \n&gt; scene. Guantix and Grappler are dead....and the other Predacons are \n&gt; completely off my scanners.&quot;\n&gt;     Aracnia slammed her tiny claw on the arm of the massive \nchair. &quot;What do \n&gt; you mean dead? And how can all the Predacons be missing? What the \nhell \n&gt; happened out there?!?!&quot; She suddenly became rather angry. &quot;Open a \nchannel to \n&gt; Quickstrike, now!!!&quot;\n&gt;     Tarantulas, from a small station in the Command Room, did as he \nwas told \n&gt; and the screen changed from a radar display to a display of \nQuickstrike \n&gt; walking through the woods. Aracnia shook her head as she touched \nher comm \n&gt; unit on her collar. \n&gt;     &quot;Sub-Commander Quickstrike! Where is Darkmouse and Kitkat&#39;s \ngroup? Tell \n&gt; me everything that happened at that Cave!!!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
