Veratis didn&#39;t know exactly what to do, it \nseemed to be reaching out for something. &quot;Prepare a protoform with \nthe Virus, it must be contained at all costs.&quot; Veratis&#39; plee seemed \ndesperate, the sample was far more important than anyone realized. It \nwas a sample from the decendant of one of the greatest leaders in \ncybertrons history.\n\nFoxfingers prepared a protoform for DNA processing. &quot;You realize that \nthis one will be as bad if not worse than the last right?&quot; Foxfingers \nhad met some Tron class bots in his functional life, now he was \nhelping create one. \n\n&quot;We have the ont thing that his other creators didn&#39;t, Maximal DNA.&quot; \nhe programmed one of the other samples for attachment. &quot;What better \ncombination for the beast leader of the predacons then a great dragon \nmaximal.&quot; The DNA he was using was from Necromancer, the great \ndragons DNA was being combined with that of a Tyranosaurus Rex. Two \nof the most powerful beasts in the history of this world were being \ncombined to create a powerful Ally. Veratis grinned a wicked grin as \nthe processor recognized the DNA that had been injected into it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis and Foxfinger repeated thier message multiple times with no\n&gt; response. &quot;Turn it off Foxfingers, they&#39;re not coming to us.&quot; A \nlook of\n&gt; disapointment spread over his face. He&#39;d so hoped for more students \nto\n&gt; study, and teach,.\n&gt; \n&gt; Foxfingers clicked off the comm ending transmission. &quot;It&#39;s probably \nthe way\n&gt; it was meant to be.&quot; The foxbot read the disapointment in the old \nscientists\n&gt; eyes, &quot;If the matrix wanted it to happen then it would have.&quot; he \nstudied the\n&gt; board when there was a surge of power from the lab.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis said nothing as he turned. Foxfingers leapt from his seat\n&gt; transforming to fox before he&#39;d hit the ground. he dashed into the \nlab\n&gt; knowing that in Veratis&#39; state he&#39;d be to late. With the grace of \nthe animal\n&gt; he&#39;d transformed into he zigzagged across the floor to the console \non the\n&gt; other side. Once there he transformed back to bot and ran a \ndiagnostic.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the samples had breeched the container. The sample of DNA \nhe&#39;d\n&gt; stollen from the predacon base was growing. The sample he&#39;d taken \nfrom the\n&gt; Megatron clone was reacting strangely to being stored away.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to talk to you about your little side trip into \nPredacon\n&gt; territory.&quot; Veratis commented when he joined the fox at the console.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You knew? I shouldv&#39;e known.&quot; The foxbot stood in a state of near \nshock\n&gt; when Veratis spoke.&quot;So, what else did Ice tell you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis smiled a half smile as he listened to his student \nspeak, &quot;Ice told\n&gt; me nothing. I know where you were for one reason.&quot; he paused a \nsuspensfilled\n&gt; pause, &quot;Where else could you have stolen a sample from Megatron \nhimself?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s a sample from Megatron?&quot;, Foxfingers was now completely in \nshock,\n&gt; he&#39;d stolen a sample from the insane leader of the Predacons. That \nwas truly\n&gt; an article to add to his resume.\n\n\n"}}
