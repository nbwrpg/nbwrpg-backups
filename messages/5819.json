She fell to the ground as he \nlet her go.  She couldn&#39;t say anything.  She looked at him for a moment.  \nShe she flew off.  She didn&#39;t say a word.  She just flew off into the sky.  \nShe was hurt inside.  The game went to far.  She flew even higher into the \nsky.  She knew that he would never want her for a partner now.  She started \nto sob as she flew into the clouds.  It hurt her down to her spark.  She \ndidn&#39;t want to back to the base.  She didn&#39;t even want to look at him.  He \nscared her.  She also let herself fall for him.  She let her spark fall for \nhim.  But that was one mistake that she would not go and do again. Never \nagain, she thought. She flew through the cloud bank, hoping to lose herself \nin the cool air of the upper sky.\n\n-----original message-----\n&gt;From: cyberwolf4@...\n\n&gt;\n&gt;The wolfbot knew not to push his &quot;Wild&quot; side to far. Owls and wolves\n&gt;competed in the frozen wilderness he came from, but not here. Pain\n&gt;scorched through his right arm (The one holding her). He knew not to\n&gt;release her or she&#39;d claw hhis eyes out. In beast mode her talons\n&gt;were her most powerful weapon. Lunarpine lowered his claw anr pulled\n&gt;his rifle. holding it up he pointed to the owls chest. Her head\n&gt;wasn&#39;t as big a part of her robot mode, destroy it and she&#39;d be\n&gt;repairable. he was aiming for the one part that held her spark in\n&gt;both modes. &quot;BANG&quot; Lunarpine shouted, &quot;Game over&quot; He dropped her to\n&gt;the ground and jumped back ready to react if necessary. &quot;When I play\n&gt;Wing it&#39;s for keeps. So will the Predicons. Remember this lesson and\n&gt;it won&#39;t be your last.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
