Darkmouse was in the base since it got there, \nand Tarantulus was never given the codes in the very beginning.\n\n::Darkmouse/Killfest::\n\nDarkmouse gives an exclamation as she sees the lockdown lifted, \ntapping furioustly and taking back control of the computers. The \nlockdown resumes.\n\n&quot;Can you shut down all the computers other than this one?&quot; Killfest \nasks her.\n\n&quot;Yeah,&quot; she replies, &quot;But they can turn them on.&quot;\n\n&quot;Destroy them then.&quot;\n\nDarkmouse taps a few buttons, every computer except for the one in \nKillfest&#39;s room blowing up with small explosions. Only a little of \nthe exaust gas gets out before the engines re-lockdown, this time \nwith no computers in there.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Tarantulas quickly unscrambles the codes. What did killfest \nthink he \n&gt; was doing? This was thier ship, their home, they knew all the codes \nand all \n&gt; the tricks to this vessle. \n&gt;        &quot;Begin to flood the exhaust. At any rate it will keep them \nlocked in \n&gt; the bridge.&quot; Megatron ordered. The lock down Killfest ordered was \ndeleted, by \n&gt; Tarantulas. \n&gt;        Quickly, toxic green gas began to fill the ships corridors, \nlabs, \n&gt; rooms, brig, and every other nook and crany. Killfest was going to \nhave to do \n&gt; better than that.\n\n\n"}}
