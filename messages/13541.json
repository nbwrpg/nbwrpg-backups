She soared on the warm \nair currents and floated in the breeze. She looked down and searched \nthe landscape for some prey.  She saw a fat gopher and swooped down \nand caught it in her talons.   She flew up with her catch and flew \nback to the grove of trees where Dollen was.  She put the gopher \ninfront of him and transformed back to bot mode.\n\nShe smiled, &quot;It&#39;s not much, but it will have to do for now.  Until \nthe night creatures come out, it&#39;s slim pickings.&quot;  She picked up the \ngopher and pulled out a small energon blade.  She expertly skinned \nand dressed the animal for dinner.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;        Dollen now sat on the ground.
