I can tell ya though, we didn&#39;t get too far, about five =\r\nhundred cliks north by north west of our original location.  That&#39;s where y=\r\nou&#39;ll find Night Shift.  Oh, he&#39;s got some large friends lookn&#39; after &#39;em r=\r\night now, I&#39;ll go back there too&#39;n wait for Ramulus, over.&quot;\n\nHe looks down =\r\nto his large stegosaurous friend.\n\n&quot;We gotta go back, help&#39;s commn&#39; ta us a=\r\nnd I don&#39;t think your family&#39;s gonna recognize &#39;em.&quot;\n\nThe stegosaurous turn=\r\ns around and heads back to his original location.\n\n&quot;Night Shift, we&#39;re comm=\r\nn&#39; back, Legacy just replied, Ramulus is gonna meet up with us, so just han=\r\ng tight okay?&quot;\n\nNight Shift recieves Rat Trap&#39;s transmission.\n\n&quot;Gotchya, no=\r\nt like I can go anywhere anyway.  Might as well make the best of it.  Besid=\r\nes, these guys, they&#39;re all right.  I got some serious back up around me an=\r\nd I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll let anything through unless we tell &#39;em they&#39;re on =\r\nour side.&quot;\n\nOne stego looks down to Night Shift making sure he&#39;s unharmed. =\r\n He smiles and rubs her nose.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m okay.  My friends are commn&#39; back ta he=\r\nlp me out.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, another stego scouts the area where Night Shift and=\r\n Rat Trap had just fled.  He had been with the family originally, and appea=\r\nrs to be one of the oldest members of the herd.  He picks up a familliar sc=\r\nent, yet not Night Shift, but the scent of another comrade, and follows it.=\r\n  It leads him close to Ramulus.  He spots the Maximal, and waits for his a=\r\npproach, quietly gurgling his growl, and lowering his head as if to try and=\r\n get him to follow him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;sup=\r\nercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A young adult stego steps out an=\r\nd lowers his neck for Rat Trap. Obviously he was the youngest of the adoles=\r\ncents and the most fit for the long journey. Rat Trap gets on, as the other=\r\ns hold their ground around Night Shift.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ll be back as fast as I =\r\ncan, and this time I&#39;ll bring backup. Okay big guy, we gotta hussle.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; The stegosaurous now heads in the direction upon where Rat Trap and Nigh=\r\nt Shift originally came from. His feet move quickly as he does his best to =\r\nget Rat Trap back to the Ark safely.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This is Rat Trap Ta Rodimus o=\r\nver, Night Shift&#39;s damages are more serious than I thought, so I&#39;m commn&#39; b=\r\nack ta get help. He&#39;s gonna need some serious repairs and a transport back =\r\nta base, over&#39;n out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no response from Rodimus.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; After a moment Legacy&#39;s cold voice comes over the radio. &quot;Rodimus is\n&gt; o=\r\ntherwise indisposed.&quot; He said, alluding to the fact that Rodimus is\n&gt; helpi=\r\nng to bring Nightlight back from the brink. &quot;However Ramulus was\n&gt; dispatch=\r\ned to assist you. He had stopped by to get energon reserved\n&gt; before he lef=\r\nt under Rodimus&#39; orders.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a slight pause and then Legacy cont=\r\ninued, &quot;Ramulus reported\n&gt; in a few moments ago that he had arrived at your=\r\n last reported\n&gt; location and was going to attempt to locate you. Are you n=\r\not still\n&gt; there?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course there last reported location was the area=\r\n of the battle\n&gt; between the alien insect-like creatures and the minions th=\r\nat looked\n&gt; like insecticons. A place they had fled from being chased by\n&gt; =\r\ninsecticon lady bugs.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
