I hope all of \nyou will enjoy my rpging and all that.  Well here goes...\n\nBIC:\n�Hugar�\n\n   Hugar press his com button and set it to the Ship he was following \nfrequency.\n\n   &quot;Hedge, you are under arrest, please stop your vehicle and surrender.&quot; \nHugar says as he press his throttle forward more, already knowing the \nanswer.\n\n   &quot;Never, you slagging oil rag.&quot; Hedge says as she reads her scanners.  \n&quot;Follow me into the Asteroid range why don&#39;t you.&quot;\n\n   &quot;You won&#39;t get away just like the rest of your cronies didn&#39;t get away.  \nFace it, the Cybertron Mob is no more, if you surrender now I&#39;ll go easy on \nyou, send you to the best prison.  Just stop this!&quot;  Hugar says hoping to \nget across to Hedge.\n\n   &quot;If I&#39;ll surrender, they&#39;ll kill me.  I have to run for my life, and the \nCybertron Mob.&quot;  Hedge says as she enter the Asteroid field.\n\n   &quot;No Hedge this is suicide.&quot;  Hugar says as he turns to the scanners.  \n&quot;Hmmm, what planets are we near.  Mars at 9:30 and Jupiter at 3:13 from me.&quot;\n\n   &quot;No, surrendering is suicide.  So, are you going to follow me?&quot;  Hedge \nsays as she dodges a Asteroid.\n\n   &quot;Have to.&quot;  Hugar says as he enters the Asteroid field.  Hugar&#39;s ship is \nhit by an Asteroid.\n\n   &quot;Ship is hit, ship is hit, please eject from this ship before it reaches \narmageddon in 3 minutes.  The escape pods are located in the rear of the \nship.&quot;  The computer says\n\n   Hugar runs to the rear of the ship and open the escape pod ship door.  He \ngrabs his picture off a nearby dresser and jumps into the Pod and blasts \noff.  He looks out his window as he sees his ship blow up.  Hugar then looks \nup and sees an Asteroid heading right for him.  It hits him as his pod is \nknocked towards Earth.  Hugar circuits are fried as he is knocked \nunconscious while the pod begins repairs on him and the pod itself.  The pod \nwill land on the island of Ireland sometime later today.\n\nOOC: I hope you enjoy this post and many more from me. This post was made to \nbasically tell you the basic on my first character Hugar.  I hope everyone \nhas a nice day :)(:\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
