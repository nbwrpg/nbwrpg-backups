He had to \nadmit that for a Predacon &quot;B&quot; um I mean Witch she was atractive. He \njust didn&#39;t want to be fooled by another pretty face. &quot;You want to \nknow why I broke in here? I don&#39;t even know that, It&#39;s my function, \nIt&#39;s what I do.&quot; he knew that Name Function and online date were the \nthree things a POW could offer. &quot;Now what makes me so special that \nyou&#39;d go so far out of your way to track me down just to let me go \nagain?&quot; He wasn&#39;t used to the offer she was making him. He wanted to \ngo free but he wanted to know why she was being such a nice puppy.\n\n --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She sighed, &quot;Because I gave you my word. I am also curious as to \nwhy \n&gt; you broke in here. I have no reason to let you live. But I gave you \n&gt; my word that I would not harm you. And I swore that no harm would \n&gt; come to you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She no longer really wanted this bot. For anything. She only wanted \n&gt; him to leave. She didn&#39;t see him as a threat. If anything, she \nhoped \n&gt; that she might gain him as an ally.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You intrieg me Fox. You came here, stole stuff from my lab. You \n&gt; obviously had a reason, and I wish to know that reason. I will not \n&gt; harm you. Once you have ansered my questions,&quot; she looked down, \n&gt; knowing she would live to regret this,&quot;I will let you go. No harm, \nno \n&gt; fight. Just answer my questions and you are free. You have my word, \n&gt; my honor.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers transformed back to bot mode and stayed crouched \nbehind \n&gt; &gt; the engines. He pulled out a detonator knowing that a Preds \n&gt; greatest \n&gt; &gt; weakness was self preservation. &quot;I have a detonator over here, \n&gt; whats \n&gt; &gt; to keep me from blowing this whole place to little pieces?&quot; he \nheld \n&gt; &gt; it out in the open for her to see. He wasn&#39;t lieing, he had a \n&gt; &gt; detonator, he just didn&#39;t have the explosives to back it up. It \nwas \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; gamble but he was quickly running out of options. His bag of \ntricks \n&gt; &gt; was running low too. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; KitKat wanted him alive he wanted to know why. &quot;Whats so \nimportant \n&gt; &gt; about me that you&#39;d let me live?&quot; he asked directly.
