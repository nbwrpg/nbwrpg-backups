The poision had run its course.\n&gt;That made things a lot easier. A well heated battle he wouldn&#39;t mind, but \n&gt;he\n&gt;needed to get back to base, and tell Megatron what he had. Also, he didn&#39;t\n&gt;have a lot of space to move around in. The trees would just get in his way.\n&gt;But either way, he won. He told Cheetor he could beat him. Sure, he busted\n&gt;his foot, but he won.\n&gt;\n&gt;He kicked the Maximal on the side, watched him just in case he moved. He\n&gt;then crouched and waved two the Predacon females over.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
