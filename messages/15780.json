She couldn&#39;t help but feel broken \nsparked.  She knew that she had doomed her love, her friends.  Any \nhope of the future for her and Striker.  She stood up and looked into \nthe hole at Striker, hanging on the wall.  She whispered to him, &quot;I&#39;m \nsorry my love. I tried to do what I thought would save you. I&#39;m \nsorry.&quot;  She just looked at him and cried. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Prebon\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon laughed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Excellent! Now, here is the plan. In a few days we&#39;ll all go on a \n&gt; scout mission at The Ark. You&#39;ll tell us which one is Ramulus. I \nthan \n&gt; threaten to kill you if he doesn&#39;t meet me one on one. If he does, \n&gt; Striker goes home. If he doesn&#39;t, Striker gets the chip. If Ramulus \n&gt; does meet me, than I give him the chip and use him as my middle man \n&gt; to control the Maximals! You may go. You can look at Striker all \nyou \n&gt; want. But if he wakes up, no mentioning of what I have just told \nyou. \n&gt; The only thing I will alow you to say is &quot;I am Master Prebon&#39;s \nnow.&quot; \n&gt; As soon as he wakes up tell me, so the torture can begin. No \nleaving \n&gt; the ship without my permission and no helping him to escape!&quot; \nPrebon \n&gt; was about to walk away, but he turned back.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh, and I hope you know what you&#39;ve gotten yourself into. I said \n&gt; Striker would go. Not you. To save him you have sacrificed a future \n&gt; with him. You could&#39;ve been with him forever, but you decided to \nsell \n&gt; out your friends and lose your love. Have a nice day!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon left her laughing.\n\n\n"}}
