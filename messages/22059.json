She smiled. This \nlooked like a crew that she could get along with. She looked up at \nKillfest and smiled, showing her fangs slightly. &quot;This is the only \npod that I could get. And it&#39;s a long walk back so I suggest that we \nget as many of you inside. I will come back for those who can&#39;t fit \non this trip.&quot; She looked Killfest up and down. She liked him. He \nappealed to her reptile side. &quot;Hold on a nano second.&quot;\n\nShe walked into the pod and dumped the crates that were in the cargo \nhold of the pod. She walked back out and looked at Killfest. &quot;I have \nmade a little more room in here. Get you and those who can fit inside \nand I&#39;ll have to come back for the rest.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Killfest/Scyther/EndBringer/Demise/Greven::\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest turns his head as he sees Diamond land, walking over to \nher \n&gt; and watching DrillBit arrive as well. His team follows behind, all \nof \n&gt; them except for Scyther easily over four feet taller than the two \n&gt; Predacons. Scyther was only seven feet, but looked as deadly as the \n&gt; rest of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest walked up to Diamond, looking down at her like she was \n&gt; fairly inferior. The terrorist leader was mostly red, a black \nstripe \n&gt; running around his waist and black spots on his torso. Horns grew \nout \n&gt; from the sides of his head, angling forward. Behind him stood the \ntwo \n&gt; bots that dwarfed even him: EndBringer and Demise, and to the side \nof \n&gt; those the two other members of his team.\n&gt; \n&gt; EndBringer stood about two feet taller than Killfest, snarling down \n&gt; at the Predacons. His body was black and purple, four tentacles \n&gt; reaching out from his back, slowly moving through the air. \n&gt; EndBringer&#39;s arms were crossed at his chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Demise, in his only form, looking like a giant croutched-over \nbeast, \n&gt; stood on all fours, resembling a gorrila that had been magnified by \n&gt; quite alot and then roasted. His body was a charred red color, his \n&gt; giant front claws touching the floor at the knuckles. His knees \nbent \n&gt; forward, he looked more like a beast than a bot, only a little bit \n&gt; shorter than EndBringer, but he was crouched.\n&gt; \n&gt; Greven, standing to the left of Demise, was almost as tall as \n&gt; Killfest, looking like a normal bot on steroids, his body varying \n&gt; shades of gray. Ok EndBringer&#39;s side was Scyther, in one of his \n&gt; almost-unlimited supply or robot modes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t think your pod will fit my crew,&quot; Killfest says, glancing \nat \n&gt; the pod behind Diamond.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
