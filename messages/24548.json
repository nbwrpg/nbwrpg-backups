He aproached Serpentor\nprepared to finish his revenge. He swerved avoiding the optic blast when He\nheard a missle aproaching from behind and leapt over Serpentor to place him\nbetween The missle and the wolf. The missle moved to avoid Serpentor and\ncontinued to pursue Lunarpine. He worked himself around the missle but again\nthe missle turned back towards him. Lunarpine decided to take a more direct\naproach. He leapt directly above the missle slashing down the side hoping to\nredirect it away from him into the ground. He wasn&#39;t surgically precise and\nthe missle exploded sending the halfbreed through the air. He was hurt bad\nas dirt and his mech fluid combined on the ground. He rolled over to try to\nfind Serpentor but had lost sight of him. He stayed low anw watched for any\nsign of a threat as his repair system worked on his lesser injuries.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, December 24, 2000 2:20 PM\nSubject: Serpentor VS Lunaprine\n\n\n&gt; (Also forgot to mention Vehement and his goons arrived and Vehement opened\n&gt; fine on you, but that&#39;s ok.  Just thought I&#39;d change the subject since it\n&gt; ain&#39;t OOC anymore)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Serpentor/Vehement:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Serpentor raised his plasma launcher to point at Lunaprine&#39;s head as he\n&gt; transformed into his half-wolf mode.  Serpentor dropped his plasma\nlauncher\n&gt; and fell to his knees, his right hand covering where his right audio\nreceptor\n&gt; would be, his left hand trying to do the same.  Serpentor started yelling\nout\n&gt; in pain, clenching his optics for a second to try and think clearly.  He\n&gt; opened them back up, firing an optic blast off at the wolfbot in front of\nhim.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Vehement silently walked along the burnt grass of South Africa, looking\nand\n&gt; smiling at the carnage.  He raised his left arm, the hand at the end of\nthe\n&gt; arm changing into a long silver barrel.  He raised the barrel to point at\n&gt; Lunaprine&#39;s back.\n&gt;\n&gt; A missile launched off from the barrel out at Lunaprine&#39;s back, the\nmissile\n&gt; an energy-signature seeking missile.  Vehement smiled, looking for a new\n&gt; target.  He didn&#39;t really want to choose just one.  But, since he was\nallied\n&gt; with the Alliance, it wouldn&#39;t be nice to let one of their ranks die at\nthe\n&gt; hands of infidels.  Of course, they were all heathens and would die\n&gt; eventually, but the Divine One wasn&#39;t back in this realm.  Vehement&#39;s\noptics\n&gt; sensors glowed a bright crimson as he watched a missile launch out from\nthe\n&gt; CF and strike him in the chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; He didn&#39;t make a sound, his body shaking for a moment.  He stood his\nground\n&gt; though.  He looked down to his chest as if barely intersted.  An\nexpression\n&gt; of rage reached his face as he saw his ceremonial robes were burnt and\n&gt; ruined.  He raised his right arm, which changed into the shape of a long\n&gt; silver barrel, two missiles launching out at the Cybertronian Fire as if\nin\n&gt; retaliation.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
