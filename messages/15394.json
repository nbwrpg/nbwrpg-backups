I find it ironic \nthat i&#39;m in for best RPGer, but none of my chars are up for any \nawards.)\n\nVulois\n\nVulis walked back intot he cave with Child in his arms. He layed him \ndown on the floor and watched him. He turrned to Terradive and \nWindrazor.\n\n&quot;Go back to the embassy and pick up Afterburner and Eagle Eye. Bring \nthe rest of the equipment. I&#39;m going to stay here and look after \nChild.&quot;\n\nVulois feared the worst. The Dark Angel must have inflicted Child \nwith something. Vulois had some ideas to do something, but he didn&#39;t \nwant to try until he saw a change in his health. He stayed by Child \nvigilantly.\n______________________________________________________________________\nFliq\n\nFlip responded to Ramulus inside himself.\n\nYeah, the reapirs went great. But your spark must have rubbed off on \nme some how. I&#39;m now a fuzor. Half fox, half ram. Do you want to get \nout now?\n______________________________________________________________________\nTamron vs. Savage\n\nTamron, the bot made up by the 5 Trainers, and the viciuos Savage \nprepared to do battle. Savage started off with 3 fireballs, but onyl \noen hit Tamron. Tamron flew into the air and started throwing down \nspear, but Savage flew up to meet them. The 2 giants did battle in \nthe sky, as jaws and claws ripped and roared. Finaly they were two \ntired and nearly crashed back to teh ground. Tamron struggled up.\n\n&quot;Tamron Transform!&quot;\n\nTamron went to Robot mode and brought out it&#39;s greatest weapon: The \nTamer. They fired, and it shot a small microchip into the back of \nSavage&#39;s neck. He let up a wild scream as it sunk into his nervous \nsystem. It took control of his mind, forcing him to do anything the \nTrainers said. Tamron went back to the 5 Trainers.\n\n&quot;Excellent!&quot; shouted Prebon, &quot;Now to plan for our first attack!&quot;\n\nThe Trainers and their new slave Savage headed back to base.\n\n\n"}}
