A few \nmoments later, the screen came on again and this time with \ninformation.\n&gt; At first on might mistake the image as a mistake, for the image \nappeared to be from an organic creature.  Muscle tissues, \ncirculatory systems, it appeared to be a glitch or the wrong \ninformation.  But upon closer inspection, Hellplague found curcuit \npathways, fiber optic wiring, and armies of nano robots.  The image \nzoomed out to examine the bounty hunter&#39;s skin, and the secret of \nhis ability to absorb energy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Or so Hellplague thought.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Other than his skin being a mass of synthetic substances organized \nto be organic, nothing amazing, no revelation, just his skin.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Who did this?  Able to disguise their work so well?  Oh well.  \nTime to examine his power system.  Time to wake him up-&quot;\n&gt; Hellplague stopped as she realized something.  Thn she devilishly \ngrinned and began to chuckle.  She walked back over to the table and \nbegan tapping commands into the controls.\n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNightmare:\n&gt; \n&gt; The femme din&#39;t say anything else, and watched.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The Sweep commander backhanded the other femme with a vicious \n&gt; snarl.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It would be well under way if the damned bot was online!  And \n&gt; since you aren&#39;t forth coming with details, I&#39;ll have to fully \n&gt; examine him before I can try to re activate him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague returns to the console on the table.  The arm over \nthe \n&gt; table drops down and extends a probe into the gel and begins \nmaking \n&gt; passes over Malice&#39;s upper arm.  The screen on the wall begins to \n&gt; register, and Hellplague walks over to it.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Amazing... such technology... such craftmanship... I have never \n&gt; seen anything like this before.  He is unlike anything else in the \n&gt; universe.  That&#39;s why he was so powerful!  His healing, ability to \n&gt; absorb energy, he is one of a kind.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She turns and walks back to the table, placing a finger on her \n&gt; chin thoughtfully.  She then turns to Blacknightmare.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;As soon as I finish scanning him I will proceed with \nbrainwashing \n&gt; him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; BlackNightmare::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hiow long will you take to brainwashed him????&quot;snarled \n&gt; &gt; BlackNightmare&quot;Unicron&#39;s pacience has limits&quot;\n&gt; &gt;             \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Friends.
