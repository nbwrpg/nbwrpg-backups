But that \n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t form a formidable force against Hydras.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nodds with understanding.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It was worth a shot. Oh well, you&#39;re right. We got enough power here to \n&gt; take down Hydras if we put our sparks to it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap grins.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Oooooh A big brain storm is hitting my tiny processor... When in doubt, \n&gt; send the little guys in ta do the dirty work. I could go with Cheetor, and \n&gt; like I did before, sneak into the small spaces and have myself a little \n&gt; fun... Ya know, cross a few wires.... Technical difficulties...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift steps forward.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Or try ta connect with their central computer system from here&#39;n ya know, \n&gt; infiltrate without physcially infiltrating....&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap bounces with excitement.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ooooh, I like that. No one gets hurt, and we might just possibly lower \n&gt; the enemy&#39;s resistance...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson narrows a brow.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That might just work.. After all, sometimes we have to think off the \n&gt; pavement don&#39;t we?&quot;\n\nCheetor was looking decidedly excited as talk was centered around\ninfiltrating the Predacon base, his optics blazed slightly as he\nnodded. His smile dimmed a bit though when the talk turned to\ntechnological infiltration methods as his brow furrowed.\n\nLord Elder on the other hand just nodded as the others talked. It\nlooked as if he were about to say something when his attention\nsuddenly distracted by a chirp on the communications board, he walked\nover to it and began to type in a series of commands and listen to\nsomething.\n\nCheetor looked at Elder for a moment as he worked and then back at\nTuscon and Rat Trap, crossing his arms over his chest. &quot;Don&#39;t you have\nto have some sort of physical link to thier system?&quot; Cheetor said,\nalthough it is obvious that his knowledge of electronics and hacking\nwas somewhat limited. &quot;Maybe we still need to infiltrate.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
