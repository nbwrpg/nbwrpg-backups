Cinder\n&gt; looked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; around at her family, seeing them all armed and ready to help the\n&gt; maximals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her excitment was bubbling over, but she tried not to show it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone ready?&quot; she heard Mantle ask. Cinder looked at him, nodding\n&gt; along\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with her brothers and sisters. Mantle smiled at her. She knew that he\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel what she was feeling. Mantle could feel the feelings and\n&gt; occasionally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear the thoughts of other bots. That was one of the traits that was\n&gt; built\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into him to make him a good leader. She smiled back, trying to be less\n&gt; &gt; &gt; excited.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;ll be there in 10 seconds, guys,&quot; Cyndro&#39;s voice informed them.\n&gt; Cinder\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slowly counted down from 10 in her mind, looking at the hatch that\nwould\n&gt; &gt; &gt; soon open so that they could fly out into action. Cinder hoped that\nthey\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be there in time to help. She wanted to do well in this battle.\n&gt; After\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all, there was someone out there that she wanted to do well for... But\n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t think of that right now, not right before a battle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Lets do this like normal battles, but keep an ear open for any\n&gt; suggestions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from me,&quot; Mantle said just as Cinder&#39;s mental countdown reached five.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Everyone nodded, and five seconds later Cyndro&#39;s voice could be heard\n&gt; again:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;re here! Good luck, guys!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Element zoomed into the African plains, the grass bending as it\n&gt; passed,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and stopped 200 feet from the Cybertronian Fire. The brand new ship\nwas\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beauty outside. It was mostly oval-shaped, with a flat bottom and a\nflat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back where the engines were attached to it. There were weapons and\n&gt; different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hatches on the outside. The weapons were (yan helped me out by telling\n&gt; me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what weapons are on the planet right now, so this is partly his work\n&gt; too)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; missile launchers, autoguns, and EMP cannons (I&#39;m not exactly sure\nwhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; those are, but they&#39;re there :). There were two big cannons on either\n&gt; side\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Element, which could fire very strong plasma shots at enemies.\n&gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was also a small disk on the top that could target robots and shoot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concintrated sonic waves at them. It could also be switched to transit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unbearebly loud beeps over the comm, which would stop attackers from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comminicating with each other (my little invention :). The ship was\n&gt; designed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for fighting in space, so its weapons were powerful. Around the ship,\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 20 feet from the sides, was the shield, a thick wall of protective\n&gt; energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cinder&#39;s heart was pounding as she watched the hatch open and her\nfamily\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exit through it. She was finally going to fight! She exited behind\n&gt; everyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; else, and then took off at a run toward battle. Cinder reached into\nher\n&gt; hip\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compartment, taking out a large pistol and firing it at the first\nenemy\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she saw, which was Deamon Wolf. Out of the corner of her eyes, she\ncould\n&gt; see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rubble running near her and aiming a missile launcher at Dark Claw. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pulled the trigger and a missile shot out, heading quickly toward its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; target. Aqua ran on the other side of Cinder. His spear gun was aimed\nat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Flesh Ripper and several spears were flying out of it toward the\nmeanie.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mist flew overhead, her charge launcher (it launches small explosives,\n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ones Rattrap used) out. She aimed at Astroblast as she got within\n&gt; range,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; firing two charges at him. Mantle was flying beside her, his arms\n&gt; stretched\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out. Two missiles flew out of each arm, mentally guided by him toward\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Menasor. Shadows passed over all the Eletors as missiles and lasers\nshot\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cyndro flew out toward any attacking bots.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
