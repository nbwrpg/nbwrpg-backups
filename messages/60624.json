How could it \nbe? \n&gt; It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was a electronic puppet what was identically Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Following the same idea as Megatron of Beast Wars, Perceptor \ndid \n&gt; one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Hydras for one ocation as this. The control was simple: the \n&gt; chair \n&gt; &gt; &gt; picked up the signals of his torso and legs and send them to \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; puppet to move it. some special &quot;Gloves&quot; picked the signal of \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; arms and hands, and as the &quot;Chair&quot; sent it to the puppet. A \n&gt; Special \n&gt; &gt; &gt; helmet trasmited to receptor what the puppet see and heard and \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; microphone let receptor sent his voice to the puppet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;AS you see &quot;hissed Hydras&quot;I was keeping this little puppet \nfor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ocattions of this...
