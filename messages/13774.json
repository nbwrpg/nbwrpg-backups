Also, I have only been here\nfor two months, so I havn&#39;t seen all the changes of the RPG. But I am\ngoing to try and say something, so here goes.\n\nMost RPGs do not make it over 20 members, and only last a few months.\nHere we are, one year, and nearly 50 members. Over the summer, we\naveraged a post every 30 seconds. What does this all mean? It means that\nNeo Beast Wars RPG is the greatist Transformers RPG, if not the greatist\nRPG there is. Lets all work to make it even better.\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY NBWRPG!!!\n\n"}}
