She looks to the monitor to see Brightblades\n&gt;signiture by the Maximal cruiser.\n&gt;     &quot;Ah, Brightblade! If you dont know already, Im the current Predacon\n&gt;Commander until MEgatron takes command. Im going to download the \n&gt;information\n&gt;now.&quot; She says, very kindly, unlike her true nature.\n&gt;     Paralysis begins the download while Aracnia turns to Thunder Hammer. \n&gt;She\n&gt;looks him over, &quot;Ah, for now you can take a break. Take the time to go into\n&gt;your beast mode and hunt, or something. Scout around and see if you cant \n&gt;talk\n&gt;to Megatron for me.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
