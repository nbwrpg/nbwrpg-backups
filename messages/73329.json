Yes, please do tha=\r\nt.  Lord Elder if you could, allow Straightshot access to Teletran One, and=\r\n see if she can acquire an Autobot frequency.  Legacy, I would like you to =\r\nmonitor that rip in the time space continuum and see if you can get an idea=\r\n as to who may have caused it.  Remember, the more intel we have the better=\r\n off we are.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns to Optimal Rodimus Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since we are abl=\r\ne to fly, we should scope the parameters according to what Legacy comes up =\r\nwith.  When we do the fly over, we have to make it look like a casual fligh=\r\nt rather than a probing mission.  The humans who are here now , may not kno=\r\nw what we are exactly, and we should keep it as such.  They know Nightshift=\r\n is a Maximal but they have not met us yet.  Leo, Big Convoy, we will need =\r\nyou to survey the ground areas where we can not see them from the air.
