Skulletron would have to use a strong dose of laughing\npower for Zardus.  Skulletron went beast mode, as he could only use this\nability in beast mode.  When Skulletron used his ability on the holographic\nbot, he only put a small effort into it, because the hologram seemed weak\nenough.  To actually use the ability good, Skulletron has to connect his\nmind with the target&#39;s own mind so Skulletron&#39;s mind could send images to\nthe target&#39;s mind.  Skulletron tried as hard as he could to connect with\nZardus&#39;s strong mind.  Zardus had a strong mind.  A very strong mind.  Once\nit seemed he was connected with Zardus&#39;s mind, Skulletron cleared his own\nmind.  Skulletron&#39;s mind then showed an image of what appeared to be\nDinobot, Blackarachnia, Optimus Prime and Megatron dressed up as clowns. \nDinobot was bopping his nose, making honking noises.  Optimus was moving\nhis hand up and down his face and each time it went up or down he had a\ndifferent expression on him.  Megatron was riding a unicycle and honking a\nhorn he was holding.  Blackarachnia was doing funny dances all over the\nplace.  Then, the image was replaced by a new one.  The new image had the\nsame four bots in it, except this time they were riding horses, side by\nside.  Then the horses started riding towards a long tree branch, as he as\ntheir heads.  The horses went faster, and then all four of them were hit by\nthe branch and fell off.  Skulletron, his mind still connected with\nZardus&#39;s mind, hoped that Zardus would let out at least a giggle.\n\n\n"}}
