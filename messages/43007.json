Her Pod was just off the coast of what would \nbe California. The beacon signal was starting to fade.  The energy \nsupply was slowly running out.  After drifting with the currents, the \npod slowly made it&#39;s way into a large bay with a small island in the \nmiddle. The pod finally beached itself on the far north side of the \nbay.  The pod opened. The computer initiated the awaking proccesses. \nWhiteFox started to groan a she started to wake up. Her power supply \nwas only as 21% and would last much longer.  She opened her optics \nand saw daylight for the first time since she had left her home world.\nShe sat up and looked around. The salt air was strong to her nose.  \nShe very slowly climbed out of the pod.  She stood there on shaking \nlegs and looked around. Standing at only 4&#39;1&quot;, she hoped she would \nrun into maximal friendly bots. Taking a few steps to the East, she \nnoticed a funny smell.  She looked down and noticed her current \nphysical condition.  The animal portion of her seamed to have rotted \naway.  Only tattered parts of fox pelt remained on her unpolished \nmetalic body. The tattered palt barely covered her form. She lifted \none peice from her hip and shook her head. &quot;Why wasn&#39;t the \ntrasformation complete?&quot;  She turned and went back to the pod.  She \nran a diognostic and action record. The record showed the pod landing \nand being damaged in the crash. Hence her unfinished maximal mode.  \nShe sighed and lowered her head. &quot;Well, then, I guess I shall have to \nstay like this untill I figure out what to do next.&quot;  She reached \ninto a small compartment under the control console and withdrew a \nplasma pistol. She checked to make sure it had enough charge, which \nit did. She put it away in her side compartment and started walking \nEast. With luck, she might find someone who mght help her with her \nmode. \n\n\n"}}
