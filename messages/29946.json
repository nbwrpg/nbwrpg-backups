She closed her eyes and felt her \nskin start to tingle.  She felt the outside of her skin start to harden.  \nHer eyes were glazed over as the scales changed from her normal scales to \nthose about to be shed.  She smiled and then with one quick movement, she \nslit the top scales on her head with her claw and pulled the old skin off \nher body.  She stepped out of the skin and stood there, a renewed snake. Her \nnew scales were jet black, soft and supple, shiny and seductive.  She went \nto the mirror and looked at her new scales. &quot;Hsssssss, I like thisss new \nssskin. Perhapsss the othersss will admire it asss much asss I.&quot; And with \nthat, she left her room and went to the main communications room.\n\n--Original Message--------\n&gt;From: &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Diamond::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She was bored out of her scales.  She wanted something to kill and to\n&gt;kill\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something soon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Oh great, she&#39;s shedding.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
