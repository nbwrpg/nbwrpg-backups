A sweeping probe\n&gt; shows great potential for organic life on the planet.\n&gt;\n&gt; The three sections take a direct course for the planet, staying in a\n&gt; perfect triangular formation. A voice from the right front asks &quot;Are\n&gt; you sure you want this planet father?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; From the larger rear piece a voice is heard to reply &quot;Yes daughter\n&gt; this planet will be the perfect place for my experiments.&quot;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
