Here&#39;s a summary of what happened since you left:\n\nMegs left the Militron base, Zardus arrived there, and also welcomed \nPanzertron to the planet.\n\nThe Alliance kidnapped Iron Raptor and Tavatron. They (IR and Tav) are \ncurrently in the proccess of being rescued.\n\nThe Newcomers attacked the Ark. The Maximals singlehandedly fought them back. \nIt was the first time a full scale assault from the Newcomers had been fought \nback by one faction alone.\n\nA few Preds attacked the Cybertronian Fire, and got their butts kicked. \nFollowed the Predacon attack, the Newcomers also attacked. During that \nattack, Hell Beast and co. decided to join the battle, helping the Newcomers. \nOnce again, the Preds were fought back, not even scratching the ship, even \nafter a foiled attempt by Megatron to destroy the Ark to make the Maximals \nsurrender. The Newcomers are still there, getting whooped on.\n\n"}}
