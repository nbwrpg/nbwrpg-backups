Phoenix has to be taking a huge \nwhale \n&gt; of a \n&gt; &gt;     beating before she actually screams in pain.  A branding \ntorch \n&gt; &gt;     doesn&#39;t cut it - no pun intended.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Phoenix::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     The femme doesn&#39;t give them the statisfaction of hearing her \n&gt; scream \n&gt; &gt;     during the branding, although several pained grunts escape \nher \n&gt; &gt;     gritted teeth.  Phoenix knows how to deal with pain, and she \n&gt; focuses \n&gt; &gt;     on anything but the burning of her own body to bear the \ntorment \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt;     relative silence.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Heartbreak&#39;s treatment is another matter.  As she lands hard \non \n&gt; her \n&gt; &gt;     back, memories surface of the things Clawful did to her, and \n&gt; Phoenix \n&gt; &gt;     scrambles away, standing up and backing into a corner.  \n&gt; Trembling, \n&gt; &gt;     the femme tries to calm herself - there&#39;s no way it could be \nas \n&gt; bad \n&gt; &gt;     as before, she rationalizes, since HBK doesn&#39;t have claws he \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt;     spear her to the floor with for starters.  It doesn&#39;t work - \n&gt; her mind \n&gt; &gt;     keeps superimposing the image of the Rogue berserker over \n&gt; Heartbreak.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Fear grips her spark compartment with an icy hand.  Seemingly \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt;     response to the threat, she feels her unstable mutant spark \n&gt; flare up \n&gt; &gt;     and send hot tendrils of energy throughout her body.  Even \nmore \n&gt; &gt;     terrified of her own poorly understood powers than of \nanything \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt;     nWo might do to her, she tries to suppress the reaction to no \n&gt; avail.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     The first external indication that something has gone very \n&gt; wrong is \n&gt; &gt;     when Phoenix drops to her knees, her arms wrapped around her \n&gt; chest \n&gt; &gt;     like she&#39;s trying to keep herself from exploding, and that&#39;s \n&gt; not far \n&gt; &gt;     from the truth.
