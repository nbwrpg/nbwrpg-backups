All the\nwhile, he briefed his two crewmembers.\n\nKrhinos: We&#39;re going to prehistoric Earth at around the era of the\nBeast Wars. The precise period is supposed to be free of any conflict,\nbut you&#39;re better safe than sorry. Anyhow, we mine for anything we\ncan, processing it and sending it back. I&#39;ve even received\nauthorization to use our special &quot;dynamite fairies&quot;... Quite effective\na drilling method, I might say. We tested them on Asteroid Tykus...\nwhich happens not to exist anymore. If I&#39;m right, there&#39;s likely to be\ntons of energon there. Whether it&#39;s stable or not, I don&#39;t know, but\nit&#39;s worth billions as we speak! So, gentlemen, embark the station and\nprepare it. We depart as soon as we&#39;re done.\n\nWith that, the doors opened and revealed a huge mobile station that\nwaited only to go across space...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LurkerAbyss&quot; &lt;1641coburn@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dracon slips into the elevator, staying silent and simply listening\nin on the conversation.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Nic \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Friday, June 06, 2003 11:02 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: The new Contract\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Krhinos entered an elevator and signaled his two other companions to\n&gt;   follow him.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Krhinos: No matter. They must all have been too drunk to notice\n&gt;   anyways. The point is, though, that we are going on a mission and we\n&gt;   bring in a full mining and processing station with us.

Good then. I guess this is the whole of \n&gt;   &gt; the\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;   crew. I&#39;d tell you more about this mission, but not in here.\nToo \n&gt;   &gt; many\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;   ears and I don&#39;t trust about all of them.

In\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;   fact, one of the pleasure bots was saying the same thing to a \n&gt;   &gt; drunken\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;   miner who was nearly passed out on the floor. Lucky for her,\nthe \n&gt;   &gt; guy\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;   had already paid her, twice rather than once, drunk as he was.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
