The Galactors \nwere familiar with the layout of the great warship; it was programmed \ninto their datatracks. FZ frowns, looking at the scanners and seeing \nthe battle at the CF. Hell Beast was heading toward it. Zardus had \nwanted peaceful relations with the Maximals. Helping them in a battle \nwas a good way of achieving that.\n\n&quot;Supernova, take your troops and go to the Maximal base. Once you \narrive, tell them you come in peace and attack any Predacon you see. \nIf some Predacons have this energy signature,&quot; he points to a scanner \nreport on the Black Fortress, showing the energy signature of \nDarkfate&#39;s group, &quot;Then leave them alone. Otherwise they die.&quot;\n\nSupernova nods at his instructions. &quot;The Predacons will die, have no \ndoubt,&quot; he assures FZ and turns around, walking out of the bridge and \noutof  the IF, the others following him.\n\n&quot;Galactors, form jets,&quot; he says and jumps into the air, the other \nGalactors doing the same. Several seconds later two jets were formed \nfrom the five Galactors, one of them bigger than the other since it \nconsisted of three bots while the other one was made of two. The \nbigger jet was yellow, orange, and white. It consisted of Supernova, \nFlare, and Scrap. The first jet&#39;s weapons consisted of heavy \nexplosives, and it had a rather advanced repair system. The second \njet was gray, consisting of Vycir and Slasys. It shimmered, becoming \ninvisible as Vycir&#39;s cloaking system activated. The second jet had \nheavy plasma and laser weapons.\n\nBoth jets activate their engines, flying off at high speed toward the \nCybertronian Fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Hell Beast emerged, followed by Marine, Inferno, and \nRampage. The \n&gt; others were en route to the new base where Shockwave was going to \nset them \n&gt; up. In the meantime, The brotherhood was attacking the Cybertronian \nFire and \n&gt; Hell Beast was prepared to help.\n&gt;        &quot;Predacons attack!&quot; He yelled the battle cry and the \nfoursome burst \n&gt; into action. The CF was going to be under heavy fire very soon.\n\n\n"}}
