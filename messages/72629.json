Could swing some\n&gt; serious recon out on the field and score the intel we need.  I can reverb\n&gt; that back ta you guys, and you decide our next move based on what I find.\n&gt; Special ops is someth&#39;n I&#39;ve been trained in extensively.

We have no idea what&#39;s going on down\nthere.&quot;\n\nWOLFGANG and RAMULUS also stood at the ready, WOLFGANG grinning, &quot;Back\ninto the saddle again he?&quot; He said to NIGHTSHIFT.\n\n&quot;I hope it turns out better than last time.&quot; RAMULUS said only half jokingly.\n\nELDER smiled, &quot;Good.&quot; He said rubbing his hands together. &quot;Legacy has\nfed the coordinates into the shuttle&#39;s navigation systems.&quot;\n\nHe turned to look at POLAR CLAW and NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;be as quick as you\ncan, and we will be awaiting any word.&quot; He shrugged slightly, &quot;Unlike\nthose in the jungle area the com systems appears to be working.
