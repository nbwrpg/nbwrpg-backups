The battle was interesting.  Many different groups.\nMany\n&gt; enemies.  But there in all their glory, were their ex-comrades, the\nAlliance.\n&gt;  Once again helping the Maximals.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;My brethren,&quot; Demon Wulf growled, &quot;if the Oblitercons form no doubt this\n&gt; battle will end.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We should attack them specifically.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Shall we focus on a single enemy, brothers?&quot; Flesh Ripper asked in\ndelight.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No, but focus on the Oblitercons.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With that, Demon Wulf raised his blade, launching a missile off at the\n&gt; airbound Dark One.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark Claw armed his missile launchers, a missile from each streaking out\nat\n&gt; Pyro&#39;s armored mode.\n&gt;\n&gt; Flesh Ripper transformed to his hyena mode, scrambling off towards\nScavenger\n&gt; at his top speed in the animal mode.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark One&#39;s sensors detected an incoming missile.  But he was a little\n&gt; flummoxed at the incoming object.  It was being fired by Demon Wulf, and\nas\n&gt; far as he knew Demon Wulf was in the Alliance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pulling up hard the was able to move out of the way of the missile, the\nshock\n&gt; wave from the explosion shaking him.  He was just lucky that wasn&#39;t a\nseeker\n&gt; or he&#39;d be stuck into the earth below him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Activating a secure comm. link with Zardus, he talked in still a confused\n&gt; tone.  &quot;Zardus, Demon Wulf and his minions are opening fire on my team.\n&gt; Orders?&quot; the mercenary team leader asked.  He wasn&#39;t going to open fire,\nbut\n&gt; he doubted his team was going to follow his example.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pyro felt two missiles strike his armored form but kept silent despite the\n&gt; pain.  &quot;Slaggers.&quot; Swerving his cannon, he fired off a single fire ball at\n&gt; Dark Claw.\n&gt;\n&gt; Breakdown looked at a dent where the missiles had hit.  &quot;I&#39;m getting out\nof\n&gt; this death trap.&quot; he said, opening the hatch and hopping out of the tank.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scavenger saw a four legged animal coming at him and wasn&#39;t sure what the\n&gt; hell it was.  &quot;Oh, the little puppy is going to get me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hiss laughed at this comment, bringing his fusion cannon to bear on the\n&gt; incoming animal and fired a blast.  He face twisted to a face of complete\n&gt; surprise as the animal transformed into Flesh Ripper and was flying\nthrough\n&gt; the air straight at him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Flesh Ripper swiped both arms downward, his claws digging into Hiss&#39;\nchest,\n&gt; the full force of the Vok creation slamming Hiss hard into his seat.\n&gt;\n&gt; Scavenger swerved as a Vok foot kicked his steering wheel at an angle,\n&gt; sending him swerving to the left a little.  &quot;Watch it you dolts!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That damn base.&quot; Imprisoner said angrily as he got a visual on the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire.  &quot;We&#39;ll destroy that before we leave.&quot; Arming his twin\n&gt; missile launchers he launched a total of four missiles at the CF.\n&gt;\n&gt; Predator and Choran piled out of Imprisoner&#39;s vehicle mode.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer flew overhead, smiling at the battle.  Raising his\n&gt; automatic-laser rifle, he fired off twenty rapid laser blasts down at\nRampage.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot raised his automatic rifle, firing off twenty armor-piercing\n&gt; rounds at &quot;Megaton&quot; while laughing hysterically.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----\n&gt;\n&gt; The Protectobots poured out of the Cybertronian Fire a little confused.\nThe\n&gt; Alliance attacks the Maximals, the Alliance aids the Maximals.  A never\n&gt; ending cycle that made figuring out who their enemies were hard.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hot Spot looked at the Predacons (Decepticons) with a burning sense of\n&gt; recognition that he couldn&#39;t place his &quot;finger&quot; on.  Raising his cannon he\n&gt; launched off three fire balls at Divebomb.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Groove raised his photon pistol, firing off two bolts at Megaton&#39;s torso.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Blades transformed to his AH-46 Apache attack-helicopter mode, lifting off\n&gt; into the air and arming his M230 30mm cannons.  He launched ten\n&gt; highly-explosive rounds from both cannons, twenty of that type of bullets\n&gt; heading for Razorclaw&#39;s torso.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; First Aid stayed back from the battle for two reasons.  First, he was a\n&gt; medic, not a warrior.  Second of all, he was poorly armed, as he&#39;d learned\n&gt; the hardway thanks to two near-death experiences.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Streetwise raised his heavy-laser rifle, a better choice than a photon\n&gt; pistol.  He fired a mighty blast from the weapon at Tantrum, charging the\n&gt; Decepticon Predacon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
