I&#39;m offended!! Monkey crap bots, huh?! Well that sack of\n&gt;numb-nuts should look in the mirror some Goddamned day!!&quot;\n&gt;Iron Raptor&#39;s expression turned almost instantly from blank to annoyed as\n&gt;that comment that rang though her mind. And couldn&#39;t help but agree  as she\n&gt;looked up at Devil Gigatron through the shaded visor that covered her eyes,\n&gt;only to have it retract as she ran her index finger down the bridge of her\n&gt;nose from the center of her forehead. Closing her eyes with a strained \n&gt;sigh.\n&gt;This wasn&#39;t a plea for an alliance anylonger. This was an insult that was\n&gt;only growing larger by the second.\n&gt;Until finally it was decided that this was going to stop.\n&gt;Silently turning to AzureBlade, Iron motioned him to follow before starting\n&gt;on her own towards the gats to the Maximal City.\n&gt;Looking over her shoulder she waved to Devil Gigatron.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Get back to me when you&#39;re going to be a bit more respectful. Bye.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* And with that her face turned back towards the great gates which stood\n&gt;tall and solid before her. Silently opening a cripted transmission to \n&gt;Cyndro\n&gt;which read: Fire if he tries anything. Otherwise, just keep the base\n&gt;defences on full until he&#39;s gone.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
