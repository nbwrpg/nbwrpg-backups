Before I=\r\n was rendered blind, we&#39;d do many missions side by side.  Of course, him be=\r\ning Hot Rod, a sports vehcile and me, an average compact SUV, off roading v=\r\nehicle, with no interest in speed, we&#39;d often kid each other about speed ve=\r\nrsus rugged durability over off road terrain.  One day, we were driving tow=\r\nard a mission to stop Galvatron&#39;s path of destruction, when our path got bl=\r\nasted by unknown enemy fire.  We knew we couldn&#39;t let a rock slide stop us,=\r\n and we didn&#39;t.  I knew I could&#39;ve just drove over it, and gotten to the ot=\r\nher side with no problem. But Rodimus wasn&#39;t built for that in his alt form=\r\n.  We never left each other&#39;s side that day.  We found a way to get around =\r\nthat obsticle together, even though we had conflicting ideas on how to do i=\r\nt, but, eventually we did compromise and we thwarted Galvatron with the aid=\r\n of the other Autobots.  Sometimes opposites work well together, and Rodimu=\r\ns proved it that day.  I guess that&#39;s what drove me to rescue him. I couldn=\r\n&#39;t think of how I would manage, if I had not had him by my side.&quot;\n\nHe gentl=\r\ny rubs Elita&#39;s shoulders.\n\n&quot;I wish I could remember what happened to Bumble=\r\nbee and Spike, and Kremzeem, but after I was rendered off line for several =\r\nvorns, I lost a good portion of my memory. &quot;\n\nLike Rodimus, Tucson&#39;s gentil=\r\ne embrace takes on a paternal aspect. He holds Elita as if she were his own=\r\n.\n\n&quot; And don&#39;t you worry about your mother, Stanton will find a way to brin=\r\ng her back, I&#39;m sure of it.  But you also have to keep that hope alive in y=\r\nour heart.  The more hope, the more chances of her healing.&quot;\n\nTucson was no=\r\nw swapping his status to a more parental role.  It felt good to be with Eli=\r\nta, and right at this moment, he wasn&#39;t about to trade that joy with anythi=\r\nng else.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita:ow\n&gt; \n&gt; Elita took Tucson&#39;s Hand as a lost child seeking=\r\n  a friend, she was in her \n&gt; robot mode that had a strong look of Nightlig=\r\nht with the golden-red colors \n&gt; of Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Mom told me that story..=\r\n. and other ones...

This \n&gt; &gt; is Optimus Prim=\r\ne, created and restorred by Alpha Trion vorns ago. Before \n&gt; &gt; he became th=\r\ne great leader that he was, he went by the name, of Orion Pax, \n&gt; &gt; a brave=\r\n Autobot who didn&#39;t believe in giving up without a fight.  One day, \n&gt; &gt; Or=\r\nion Pax suffered greatly in battle, and was brought  to Alpha trion \n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\nere he became Optimus Prime.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;T=\r\nhere are so many things I never got to ask you.

But most of \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; all Optimus, our paths appear to be the same, our values, our courage,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; our strength and our faith in those around us.
