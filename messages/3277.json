Airbomber\nblocks the blast and then destroys the autogun. Plintissa knew something was\nwrong, the autoguns shouldn&#39;t be firing at Maximals! Plintissa called Liono\nPrime on her commlink.\n\n&quot;Excuse me, but why is the base firing at me and my group, Liono? We have\ncome to the base to bring some allies, the predacons attacked my group when\nwe went to see what that Maximal wanabe Suukie was doing. So let&#39;s just fix\nthis problem, okay?&quot; Plintissa asked, very annoyed at the fact that some\nworthless people like Liono would turn the autoguns on them. Plintissa\ncalled Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;Hey, Iron Raptor, Plintissa here, I got problems, the base is firing at me\nand the one thing Dracona doesn&#39;t have is med kits, we need to borrow a few\nuntil Dracona gets the technology to build some, please turn the autoguns\noff of us.&quot; Plintissa said. Plintissa wanted to see Iron Raptor again as\nwell, and waited very impatiently with her angry group rallying behind her.\nAnother autogun fired at her and she stumbled backwards, avoiding the shot,\nit continued firing and Stranato took aim, blasting the autogun right into\nthe shields, melting it. Plintissa waited...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, June 13, 2000 10:34 AM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; (Code, sorry, I am just &quot;preaching the message&quot; as it were.  Liono is in\n&gt; control of the Ark as far as I know, and I KNOW he put all of the People&#39;s\n&gt; group on enemy.  So you can&#39;t just waltz right in.  If your guys want to\nbe\n&gt; Maximal, work it out with Liono.  He doesn&#39;t seem to want to be allies\nwith\n&gt; your People&#39;s Group, and he&#39;s set the defenses to monitor you as enemy.\nSo\n&gt; if you come in range, you will be shot and you wouldn&#39;t be let inside\nunless\n&gt; someone opened them.  That&#39;s all I know.
