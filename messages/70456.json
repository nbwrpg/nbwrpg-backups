As compassionate as Prime, if it \n&gt; meant that his life was in danger, he would protect a new comrade with his \n&gt; own spark.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I can&#39;t do that Perceptor. I&#39;m not going to abandon you.  It&#39;s my promise \n&gt; from the bottom of my spark and I will not break my promise my new friend. \n&gt; Take heart, Rat Trap is now able to bypass the computers manually, which \n&gt; will allow you to enter the Ark safely until we can alter those signatures \n&gt; of yours.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He stays by him no matter the price his body may pay in the mean time.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the Ark, Quickstride and Night Shift have the CR chambers ready for use \n&gt; as they do last minute evaluations on the system.  With a thumbs up from \n&gt; Night Shift, the CR Chambers are made ready to accept new patients.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re good ta go in here, Lord Elder.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap watches as Tucson remains with Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Good he&#39;s still in one piece.  Now that&#39;s what I call one tough \n&gt; Autobot.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime now communicates to the Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is Tucson Prime to Lord Elder.  According to my signature readings, \n&gt; Rodimus Prime is in need of help, and a help maybe I can supply him.  From \n&gt; one Prime to another, perhaps I can lend him my spark to give him the \n&gt; power he needs to recover quickly.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap&#39;s jaw drops.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If he does that there&#39;s no telln&#39; if he&#39;ll survive such a proceedure. \n&gt; Lord Elder, tell him he can&#39;t do that!  That&#39;s like the ultimate \n&gt; saccrifice and there&#39;s a great chance he&#39;ll die from it!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor/Kup:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kup watched sadly the medic room and said to silverbolt &quot;I guess that \n&gt;&gt; i&#39;ll\n&gt;&gt; remain here to help&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *****************************\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor dryly said &quot;It seems that I have to leave you, Tucson.
