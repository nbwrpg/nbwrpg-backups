He wanted action and a chance to seek rank. \nNot rust to pieces in his room. He got up and wandered the halls. He \nfound the main communications room and sat down. He picked up the \nscanner headset and put it on. Next, he started to adjust some of the \ndials to start picking up most predacon frequencies and some of the \nmaximal frequencies. He listened to the scanner and hoped he would \nfind out what was going on.\n\n\n"}}
