She then looked at the\nbed. &quot;Hmm, this will never do.  She spun webbing around the four posts\nso it made a hammock suspended above the bed.  \n\nAfter nearly an hour, the room looked like a proper web nest.  Sure a\nbot could enter, but unless they had careful footing, they would get\ncaught in the strands.  She did leave part of the living room open and\nfree of web so that her leader and co-bots could sit comfortably in\nher quarters if needs be. She looked about in complete satisfaction.\n&quot;Ah, home sweet home. Now if I could only get a few maximal bodies to\nlitter about the place for aumbience, things would be just perfect.\nBut the little touches could wait. She walked outside of her room and\nwent to a wall com panel. &quot;Perceptor, please give me the directions to\nyou. I wish to speak of a few...upgrades.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
