It certainly looks like Slaughter is between a boulder\nand\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very hard place.  Since just entering the Decepticon base, he&#39;s went\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the frying pan into the fire!  I lost Skulletron once, I won&#39;t have\n&gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ressurected into Slaughter and be lost again!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IC:  Slaughter was getting desperately hungry, and had to eat soon\nor\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would die, but he also had to avoid being blown to pieces.  Many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; projectile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explosives were being shot at him.  Slaughter was hit by 15 rifle\n&gt; shots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FireStrike, and this time only a few bits of flesh flew off, but\nslime\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flew everywhere like normal.  Slaughter got away from Stratus.  He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forward,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but high enough, and stuck his pincirs into the ceiling, then acted\n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their was sticky things on his hands, and quickly went across the\n&gt; &gt; ceiling,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; avoiding the mega missile, and the rockets, and all shots that were\n&gt; &gt; headed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at him(sorry for missing all those shots, but I didn&#39;t want my new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; favourite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; character to die!)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Slaughter jumped down from the ceiling, onto the floor again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      &quot;HUNGRY!!!&quot; Was the only thing Slaughter seemed to be, and be\n&gt; able\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Slaughter lunged at Shokaract, opening his jaw to try and take\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out of Shokaract.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
