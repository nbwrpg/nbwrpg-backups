So scratch my last \npost with Hell Beast and his team storming out of the base. \n\n::: Hell Beast looks at Inferno, Rampage, and Black Aracnia freash out of the \nCR tank. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: What do you have to say for yourselfs?\n\n::: Inferno ::: Royalty! I tried to tell them, but they refused to listen! I \nbegged!\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Inferno Shut Up! Black Aracnia, what happened?\n\n::: The fembot answered cool as a cucumber ::: We went to download Maximal \naccess codes from there computer, but the internal defenses got the better of \nus. It looks as if they invested alot more in them.\n\n::: Hell Beast rubs his chin, ::: I see...\n\n::: Inferno ::: My Queen, we could have succeeded, but this female disobeyed \nme. She should burn!\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Mabey later, for now im expecting company so contact our \ngroup at the tower and let them know we might need them.\n\n::: Black Aracnia says as she sits at her station ::: ...unless the Newcomers \nare going to attack there instead to try and take the tower from us.\n\n::: Hell Beast gritted his teeth ::: Damn it! Tell them to be on the alert, I \ndont want any foul ups!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron looks to Scorpinox ::: Yes, send a cyberbee. For now, I have a \nreprograming to do.\n\n::: Ra is strapped to a table, unable to move. Waspinator hits him with his \nsmall insect amrs, laughing. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Dont worry, first we will remove a portion of your spark, \nand then we wil lreprogram you.\n\n::: Ra suddenly goes limp, and the process begins :::\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Transanulas, Pheniox, Marine, and Gremlin look at the tower, and then to \nTransanulas :::\n\n::: Marine ::: A wepon?\n\n::: Transanulas ::: Yes, I already explained it to her, I dont see why you \nwont let me do it!??\n\n::: Marine ::: Hell Beast wouldnt like it, we should ask him first.\n\n::: Gremlin ::: I just got word from him we might be under attack, I think we \nshould postpone this little project.\n\n::: Transanulas ::: If there is going to be an attack, its more a reason to \nmodify the tower!\n\n::: Marine thinks a moment ::: No, we will stand our ground for now. After \nwhatever comes our way, we will decided.\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Ra sturs, and then rises. He looks to Megatron who is holding some kind \nof device containing a glowing orb. :::\n\n::: Ra ::: Megatron? Why do I feel like...like im dazed and confused?\n\n::: Megatron ::: All part of the spark removeal surgury. You see, I cut out a \npeice of your spark and I will crush it and cause you pain and suffering if \nyou dont listen to me. \n\n::: Waspinator ::: And then we will reprogram birdy bot!\n\n::: Megatron ::: Ah yes. I will reprogram you to serve me. And hold you \nhostage with this spark. If they try to get you, I will kill you. Its simple. \nAs of now, I am your master!\n\n::: Ra tries to say something, but falls into darkness. :::\n\n"}}
