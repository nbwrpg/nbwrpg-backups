Silent... dark... all there were by no means functioning. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yet in the darkness, 2 glowing eyes appeared as they moved like 2\ntiny ghosts \n&gt; through the darkness of the crypt. They approached the center, the\nheart of \n&gt; the crypt, a soft glowing light in rememberance of those brave\nDecepticons \n&gt; who ceased to function in battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the 2 glowing lights soon enough revealed they belonged to a form\nthat did \n&gt; function!\n&gt; \n&gt; A beast machine, in the form of an Earth white bengal tiger stood in\nthe \n&gt; light, basking in it&#39;s soft glow. The optics of this regal creature\nglanced \n&gt; about as it seemed to realize where it was, & understand the\nnightmare it was \n&gt; in. The optics soon enough looked at it&#39;s current form.. to it&#39;s\nhorror! \n&gt; \n&gt; RrrAAARRRRRRRROOOWWWWWLLLLLLLLUUUNNNGGHHHHHHAAAAAAA!!!!! as the\nblood curling \n&gt; cry went out, echoing throughout the crypt.\n&gt; \n&gt; The creature found it extremely hard to transform, unable to at this\ntime. \n&gt; What was once familiar to her, was no more. This new form was by no\nmeans \n&gt; welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; She walked over between the statues of Thundercracker & Skywarp, her\nfriends &\n&gt;  fellow comrades during the Great War. As she laid down at their\nfeet, they \n&gt; were now large than her, she hated this already. A soft howl, moan &\nwhimper \n&gt; came from her. Emotions? This was unusual. She was a Decepticon, not\nsome.. \n&gt; organic creature. But she was not totally organic. This confused her\nmore.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a broken, uneasy deep feminine feline. &quot;What... is.. happening..\nto .. \n&gt; me?!&quot; she growled as she laid at the feet of the Decepticon statues.\n\n\n"}}
