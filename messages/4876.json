She had a surge of energy run through her \nprogrammming.  It rebooted the initial program the Scorponok had installed \nin her. Her body shook slightly for a moment.\nThen she knelt down in front of Megatron.\n&quot;Forgive me my commander. I was ovcer stepping my bounds.  I beg for your \nforgiveness on this matter my commander.  But please feel free to punish me \nif you feel I deserve it.&quot;\nShe went down on one knee and knelt down waiting for the cruching blow from \nMegatron.\n&quot;I ber forgiveness you greatness. I don&#39;t know what came over me.&quot;\nShe actually let a tear fall from her eye and onto the floor.\nBlast her programming agian.  It let her think on her own when no one was \naround and kicked in when her commanders where near.  She hated that.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
