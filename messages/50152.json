I hope your \nskills will be useful to us. Now for- (he receives the transmission \nfrom Spikes and opens a channel) No Spikes, don&#39;t attempt anything on \nthem now. They are in Maximal territory so it is likely they could get \nhelp. There was a pod landing near our base. A third lifeform is \nlocated there too. Go investigate there for now. Base out.\n\nHe throws some long feathers back, oddly forming a cape. Meanwhile, \nShadow Star comes out of the CR Chamber. Silently moving, he stops \nnext to his superior.\n\nShadow Star: I am back, Major.\n\nTyrael: Good. We can now start. As you all know, we have met little \nsuccess in our first encounter with the Predacons. There were many \nunits that entered combat and the loss of Burrock only made it worse. \nThat made us go out of the cover of secrecy. Most factions know the \nlocation of our base and I don&#39;t think Megatron liked my bragging \nabout getting him. From now on, we must expect no quarters, and give \nnone. We&#39;re lucky because we&#39;re alone on our continent. This is \neasier to monitor unit movement. But now, we&#39;ll stop to use the \ndefense position. We have to know where to strike. We need to scout \nand find our enemies, because they are not only the predacons and \nmaximals. And perhaps we can ally with this new faction that arrived \non planet some times ago, as the computer reported. Are there \nvolunteers?\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;deltazero1&quot; &lt;DeltaZero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Talon was working on the top on the base and crusher stood over him \n&gt; holding a large triple laser turret on his shoulder while talon \n&gt; started to connect wires &quot;ok set it down here&quot; he said stepping back \n&gt; a bit as crusher put it down with a large thud &quot;ok that finished up \n&gt; the weapon defence&quot; talon said as he walked towards the bridges sun \n&gt; roof and gave the command for it to up so he could jump down &quot;main \n&gt; defences up and rdy sir&quot; he landing a few feet away from the others \n&gt; and moved to the side abit before crusher jumped down and making a \n&gt; good deal of the room rumble as his landed &quot;and this is crusher my \n&gt; weapons officer&quot; he said looking over at crusher large body\n\n\n"}}
