He would\neither turn into his ant mode should it be required, or just fly using\nhis booster. Either way he was ready to follow his master where ever\nhe went.\n\nIguanus on the other hand shifted into a Giant Transmetaled Frilled\nLizard, he was large and well armored, but it was obvious that the\nfliers would easily out distance him on the trip if they didn&#39;t go\nslow enough so that he could keep up. &quot;I&#39;m ready sir.&quot; he said, ready\nto take on what ever mission that Hydras had for him.\n\nMeanwhile a call came in from Cyclonus, &quot;Sir. I have taken Bruticus-x\nand Insecticon with me to help track down Scourge. We have trailed him\ninto the caves that the Maximals fled into, but so far the trail is\nstill cold. I think there is something else down here besides us\nthough.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
