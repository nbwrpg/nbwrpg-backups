It is twice the size of most shuttles, but most of it&#39;s \n&gt; mass is filled with cargo, from energon cubes (probably not needed) \n&gt; to shield generators, to ammo (happy now).  Only one bot is on \n&gt; board.  He sits at the control, his demeanor quiet, and \ncontemplating \n&gt; as he heads towards Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; He scans the planet and sees the Predicon frequency.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bot:  I knew I&#39;d find Megatron here when the portal opened.  This \nwas \n&gt; the only logical place for him to go.  Too bad he seems to have \n&gt; started the party without me, but maybe I can still help him with \n&gt; those Autobot hero wanna bes.\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns his shuttle to land close to a hundred miles from the \n&gt; Predicon base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bot:  Soon the Maximals will feel the wrath of Flicker.\n\n\n"}}
