Shadow \nWing must have flown to high for him to follow. he had caught her \nscent around a tree, flys crowded around the remains of a carcass on \nthe ground, at least she wasn&#39;t hungry.

When she \ndidn&#39;t respond he knew one of two things were true. Either she wasn&#39;t \nspeaking to him, or something had happened to her. His instincts told \nhim to assume the worst. He had to find her just in case.\n\nLunarpine called back to base&quot;Get Prowl online, if he&#39;s deactivated \nthen wake him up, he&#39;s an owl damnit.&quot;\n\n-- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She flew down and through some of the glaicar  canyons.  It was a \nblue \n&gt; crystal wonderland.  She felt at home with the ice.  She figured \nthis was \n&gt; where she belonged. On ice.  She flew past some caves and past \nanother \n&gt; mountain.  She found a small cave.  She flew tothe entrance and \ntransformed \n&gt; into bot mode.  She walked around inside.  Surprizingly, it was \nwarmer in \n&gt; the cave.  She walked to one of the back caverns and found a small \n&gt; hotspring.  This would keep her warm when she slept.  She looked \naround.  \n&gt; there was a small hole in the ceiling that acted as a vent foe the \nsteam \n&gt; from the hotspring.  She thought her luck was turning about.  She \ncould hunt \n&gt; the small animals that ran around outside.  And stiil stay warm \nwhen she \n&gt; slept.  She smiled at her good fortune. &quot;Oh, this cave would be the \nmost \n&gt; perfect spot for...&quot; she stopped.  She almost said Lunarpine.  &quot;No, \nmaybe \n&gt; not.  If I&#39;m here, then it wouldn&#39;t do for a warrior like him. No, \nnot at \n&gt; all.&quot; She turned and looked up.  She found a small ledge in which \nshe could \n&gt; rest on.  She transformed into beast mode and flew up to the \nledge.  She \n&gt; fell sleep with fitfull dreams.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
