He could feel himself slipping away.  He would be \nnothing but a mindless shell in a few minutes or so.  Seeing Dark Mouse being \ntaken away by one hella ugly Predacon he slammed a fist on the ground.  \n&quot;Ramulus...save...mouse!&quot; he yelled, barely able to form words.  Raising his \nrifle, he fired off twenty sonic shells off, fifteen at the back of \nQuickstrike&#39;s legs, five at the back of Double Punch&#39;s, Double Punch \nstumbling and falling over.\n\n"}}
