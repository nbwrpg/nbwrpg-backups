He \nwalked down to Black Arachnia&#39;s location. He had to pause of few \ntimes to make sure not to get lost. This ship was much more bigger \nthan Megatron&#39;s old ship.\n\nHe stepped up, a few dents on his chest and shoulders from Rattrap.\n\n&quot;Yeah, sugar-bot? Ya wanna hear &#39;bout th&#39; vermin?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
