Maybe a mouse or two,&quot; he replies, \ngrinning but then frowning. His repair system was done on major \ninternal damages, but it was not going on to his wing. He turns his \nhead to look at the wing, watching it swing off the attatched part of \nhis wing. It wasn&#39;t losing too much fuel, but it would serioustly \ndisturb him for a while. It wasn&#39;t a major wound, so his repair \nsystem didn&#39;t bother with it.\n\nReaching behind him, Prowl&#39;s hand takes hold of the top of his wing, \nsnapping it off with a sharp motion. He clenches his teeth slightly \nfrom the pain shooting from the disembodied wing. Placing the wing on \nhis back, he closes his other wing over it, shutting off mech fluid \nflow to the stump.\n\n&quot;Ok, let&#39;s get there as soon as possible,&quot; he says serioustly, \nleaning down and taking hold of Iron Raptor&#39;s neck. He was ready for \nher to go full speed, he just hoped he wouldn&#39;t fall off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m posting at school and the bell just rang, I&#39;m afraid I didn&#39;t \nhave time \n&gt; to post with Desmonus.\n&gt; I will when I get home.\n&gt; Happy posting everyone!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; IR:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor could feel Prowl shifting on her back, and she had to \nadmit it \n&gt; felt very strange.\n&gt; Even in her other beast modes she had never had anyone ride on her \nback \n&gt; before...now she knew what a horse felt like.\n&gt; By the tense feeling of Prowls muscles against her own she could \nfeel that \n&gt; he was uncomfortable about something, maybe...ashamed?\n&gt; But then again he did manage to crash into a tree and break his own \nwing, so \n&gt; she only guessed as much would be proper.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor looked over her black shoulder as Prowl spoke, seeing \nhis repair \n&gt; system activate...but wondered just why he wasn&#39;t afraid of \nher...or even \n&gt; thought that she was disgusting by now.\n&gt; All he ever showed was concern, and she guessed that it was right \nfor him to \n&gt; feel that way. She would be the same if this was him instead of \nher. But \n&gt; then again, she wouldn&#39;t wish this on a Pred.\n&gt; Well...maybe a Pred...\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor turned her head back towards the direction of the Ark.\n&gt; Hurry, that was what Prowl said...but she wondered if he could even \nhold on \n&gt; tight enough. Well...she could always find out.\n&gt; It would be a long way too. There were a few gullies and fissures \non the way \n&gt; there, but they should make it by nightfall if she ran all the way.\n&gt; She growled at Prowl, in a slight sarcastic tone.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I suppose you want peanuts and complimentory drinks on this \nexpress \n&gt; transport as well...Sir?\n&gt; \n&gt; * Then breaking into an easy trot before a smooth jog. She would \nwait until \n&gt; he was fully repaired before she ran out fully.*\n\n\n"}}
