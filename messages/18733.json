He was angry. Even if this bot \n&gt; didn&#39;t know where Megatron was, she must have known something. Why \n&gt; did Inferno want her to go to Arachnia when he worked for Megatron? \n&gt; It made no sense! Unless.....By the Matrix! That&#39;s it! Megatron&#39;s \n&gt; goal was to untie the Preds, and he must have made a treaty with \n&gt; Arachnia! Now she comes in here and merges groups and sends all our \n&gt; plans to Megatron! She must be stopped! Starscream left and burst \n&gt; into the conference room.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;KitKat, stop! Arachnia is a fraud! She is working for Megatron!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
