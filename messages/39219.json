To their left, Prowl falls unceremoniously on his butt from about halfway up to the cealing. Cledar nods, looking over at Rixer and Blyer.\n\n&quot;Well, you heard her. Lets go scout around,&quot; he says, walking off with Rixer, Forrior, and Blyer following.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl stands up, hoping that no one saw him fall. He looks around, spotting Orion and walking over to that group. For some reason, he felt like he should talk to them.\n\n&quot;Hello,&quot; he says as he approaches.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm stops running and puts away his gun as the ship disintegrates, watching IR exit and shrugging, then walking off as well.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Yes, commander?&quot; Cyndro&#39;s voice says, a screen being lowered down from the cealing with his face on it. It was a boyish face, intellegecne shining from behind his eyes.\n\n&quot;New parts are being brought to the city and I&#39;m currently building them in,&quot; he reports, &quot;The rest of the city is doing great. THere was a big battle far to the north, but its over. There&#39;s currently another battle on the other side of the planet. I think that that&#39;s the battle Hot Rod was just reffering to.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; OK. I&#39;m sunburned, tired and ready to snap...but if I missed anyone&#39;s post, \n&gt; tell me and send it to me again.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Growling, IR recieves HotRod&#39;s transmission...but with the armor playing on \n&gt; the holo-ship it was garbled and she had a hard time telling what it was he \n&gt; had said. So, with a heave she ripped away a fair section of roof and \n&gt; dropped to the floor.\n&gt; Then converting back to robot mode, clad from neck to tow in the same black \n&gt; battle armor, a leadway was opened to ALL Maximals which were positioned in \n&gt; the holo-deck.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Playtime&#39;s over, kiddies. But Congrads to the survivors. We&#39;ll have to \n&gt; play this again sometimes. Until then, go have fun until further notice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * From there the surrounding ship vanished, leaving a grid lined room where \n&gt; all could see eachother.\n&gt; Iron looked all of them over...holding their weapons...before quickly \n&gt; turning to the side and exiting the room, blake cape billowing out behind.*\n&gt; \n&gt; COMM: &quot; Your last message was garbled, HotRod. Could you repeat, please?\n&gt; \n&gt; * Leaving her commm open for reply, Her eyes turned to the walls of the \n&gt; Maximal City.\n&gt; Iron Raptor had remembered Prowl telling her about the ship&#39;s mind. \n&gt; Cyndro...he called it.  Probably just another Iris.\n&gt; But...just in case:*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Cyndro, report.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
