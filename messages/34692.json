Let me begin.&quot; His translucent \ncorporal body begins to shimmer as he recounts what he and the \nother Ikoto had said. &quot;We, the Ikoto, would like to propose a bet, or \ngamble you could say, on the fate of that planet, Earth. We \npropose that the Ikoto chose a group of sentient beings, like the \nones you already have messed with, and put them on the planet. \nThere they will be empowered with tasks, tasks of utmost \nimportance in their minds. The group that the Ikoto choose will \nhave to defeat your group, and gain control of the planet. Likewise, \nyour chosen ones will have to defeat the bots chosen by the Ikoto. \nIf our side succeeds, we will do what we will with the planet,&quot; \ncontinued Azafroth knowing full well that the Vok knew what the \nIkoto would do, &quot;and if your side succeeds, then we will leave.&quot; The \nIkoto&#39;s body shimmers in cruel delight at the game, knowing that \ntheir choice of chosen robots was the ultimate irony. Azafroth \nemanated a cold amused smile. Uokarase buts into the telepathik \nwar zone, and put mental pressure on the Vok representative, \n&quot;Well, what do you say?&quot; Uokarase&#39;s thoughts speed intently \naround the groups.\n\n\n\n\nOn 15 May 2001, at 6:07, Yanshosh@... wrote:\n\n&gt; ::The Vok::\n&gt; \n&gt; If Voks frowned, this one would have. It had been doing an important\n&gt; job, keeping track of time, and these Ikoto came along with a probably\n&gt; silly proposal and waste its time. But it supposed that watching the\n&gt; planet was fairly boring. Personally, it didn&#39;t like the Ikoto, but it\n&gt; had to deal with them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Very well, speak,&quot; it finally informed them, &quot;I will listen, but do\n&gt; not waste my time.
