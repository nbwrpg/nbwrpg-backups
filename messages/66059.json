Pronto!&quot; shouted the supervisor, seeming\n&gt; frustated at his subo=\r\nrdinate&#39;s lack of independent thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; The CR opened.  It was an older=\r\n model, but with CR&#39;s it didn&#39;t\nreally matter\n&gt; how old they were as long a=\r\ns they worked.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I can&#39;t pull up any data on this one?  Should we disar=\r\nm her?&quot; asked the\n&gt; tech.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re losing vitals.... Get her in there no=\r\nw!&quot; shouted Supervisor.\n&gt; \n&gt; They slowly lifted the patient off the cart an=\r\nd into the CR, which\ncreaked\n&gt; as it shut.  The locking mechanism made a so=\r\nund like its motors were\n&gt; struggling to move the mechanism, then suddenly =\r\nthere was a loud\nmetallic\n&gt; thud, followed by the light humming sound of th=\r\ne CR.  The lights on\ndisplay\n&gt; panel lit up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ok, you!  You&#39;re assigne=\r\nd to this patient.

Pentatron certainly wasn&#39;t an easy pla=\r\nce for a\n&gt; &gt; nice girl, but it was alright. She had never been a nice girl.=\r\n She had\n&gt; &gt; never known how to.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She had not been caught by the pol=\r\nice when she had sucked that young\n&gt; &gt; bot&#39;s spark. The rush had allowed he=\r\nr, after some time, to alter her\n&gt; &gt; appearance enough so to disappear for =\r\na while. She had changed back,\n&gt; &gt; but by then, she was roaming the streets=\r\n, fighting off the urge,\n&gt; &gt; sometimes against her better judgement. The mo=\r\nre you resisted, the\n&gt; &gt; worse it would be when she gave in - one way or an=\r\nother.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Creep. That was how the hoboes referred to her. It made her =\r\nsmile with\n&gt; &gt; a clutching sadness. Somehow, she felt it was the right name=\r\n for her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She was dragging herself through the city at that point. =\r\nShe was\n&gt; &gt; getting weaker, which was not a good sign, and she was halfway =\r\nthrough\n&gt; &gt; a big boulevard. Too many people, too many lights, away, away w=\r\nith\n&gt; &gt; you! She was sleepy, no, please, don&#39;t close your eyes! Just... Jus=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; a... little... bit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She passed out. Energon surge. Nothing se=\r\nrious, technically speaking,\n&gt; &gt; but people have a way of panigking when th=\r\nings aren&#39;t as they should\n&gt; &gt; be. A ring of bots circled her in no time, a=\r\nnd later on, an ambulance\n&gt; &gt; picked her up and brought her to a gorvernmen=\r\nt medcenter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Could someone play techs and wake her up, plz?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
