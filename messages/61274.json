A seies of deflector shields, used for \n&gt; training against deflected shots.  He set up a series of deflectors \n&gt; to dissapate energy, and stepped back.  He dropped his sword and \nhis \n&gt; shield, then powered up his fusion cannon.  He fired a shot at 5% \n&gt; power.  It made some noise, but not something to draw attention \nto.  \n&gt; The energy dissapated quickly, and the clone kicked the energy up \nto \n&gt; 10%.

We plan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to use a high mass object and collapse it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gravity, turning it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a black hole.
