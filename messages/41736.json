I&#39;d love to send their sparks to the Pit \nand to\n&gt; have SilverScout and Blaze&#39;s head on my mantle. One problem though. \nIf\n&gt; SilverScout has the virus, how do we get her into quarentine, \nwithout\n&gt; our troops getting infected?&quot; Asked DrillBit.\n&gt; \n&gt; While saying this he armed all weapons, and transformed his arm \ninto its\n&gt; gattaling gun mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat2 and StarScream also armed their respective weapons.\n\n\n"}}
