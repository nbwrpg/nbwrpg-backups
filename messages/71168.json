He buckles himself in, now knowi=\r\nng what was ahead.\n\n&quot; I don&#39;t like the looks of this, those signatures spel=\r\nl trouble, buddy.&quot;\n\nNight Shift stops short for a moment to try and think t=\r\nhings through.\n\n&quot; Neither do I, but there&#39;s a chance Cheetor&#39;s in there and=\r\n we just can&#39;t turn tail on &#39;em. Hmm...  I think this calls for a little Ni=\r\nnjabot finesse.  If I trade in my wheels for feet, I could get us in there =\r\nlike a pair of ghosts in the smog.  No one would know we&#39;re there, and we c=\r\nould get a better look at what&#39;s go&#39;n on.&quot;\n\nRattrap nodds.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t wanna =\r\nbut it&#39;s a good idea.  You&#39;re right.  I can&#39;t rat my way outa this, we gott=\r\na help Cheetor.  Okay, I&#39;ll step out.&quot;\n\nHe steps out of Night Shift&#39;s cab a=\r\ns the Autobot goes from vehicle to robot mode in a matter of seconds.  Rat =\r\nTrap then gets up on his shoulder and holds onto his helmet with tiny paws.=\r\n  Night Shift gives him a reassuring look.\n\n&quot;No worries Rattrap we can do t=\r\nhis.&quot;\n\nQuietly, Night Shift moves in as he silently takes to the forest, on=\r\n swift and silent feet.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;sup=\r\nercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The trip forward is easy enough. The lava is no =\r\nlonger following after Rat\n&gt; Trap and Nightshift, but instead is just lappi=\r\nng up against stone and earth\n&gt; like some weird seashore, where the water w=\r\nas molten rock, the shoreline\n&gt; melted stone and the air is filled with the=\r\n stench of sulfur and smoke that\n&gt; rose into the skies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ahead of the d=\r\nuo the burnt out trees beckoned, hot winds whipped through\n&gt; them, causing =\r\nthe trees to bend and creak. A few downed trees occasionally\n&gt; lay in Night=\r\nshift&#39;s path, but other than that the ground before them was\n&gt; open and rel=\r\natively flat.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Unicronian signal was steadily getting closer as the=\r\ny drove forward,\n&gt; they were obviously going in the right direction to reac=\r\nh it. However as\n&gt; they were moving they were picking up also another energ=\r\ny signature =96 one of\n&gt; the insect horde.\n&gt; \n&gt; The trees themselves were f=\r\ninally begining to fill in, leaves were starting\n&gt; to appear as they travve=\r\nled. Evidently they were now comming into areas that\n&gt; had not been touched=\r\n by the blast of lava and het from the steadilly more\n&gt; distant volcano.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; However as they moved something was happeneing, they could see where tre=\r\nes\n&gt; had fallen, where others had been scorched and burnt, others knocked o=\r\nver,\n&gt; cracked and pulverized. From the energy reading that were being exam=\r\nined, it\n&gt; would seem that there was a battle of sorts taking place, and th=\r\ney were\n&gt; driving right toward it!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
