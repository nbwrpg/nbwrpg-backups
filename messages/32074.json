He was about to leap, but the the high-pitched noise\nstopped him dead in his tracks. Prowl rises up on his back legs,\nscreeching from the sound.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus flies up, looking over at Rattrap to see what was going on. He\nhadn&#39;t expected a Maximal to help him, so this was a bit of a\nsurprise. He watches the explosion, though Autofire was flying too\nfast for it to have a major impact.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAutofire turns to strafe at Zardus again when the missile hits behind\nhim, enveloping him in flames. Shrapnel hits all over him, though his\narmor holds through it. The turbulence causes him to go into a spin,\nemerging from the fireball fairly charred and dented, but he had been\ntoo far from the explosion to be taken out.\n\nSeeing a large beast and a bot ahead of him, Autofire fires two\nrapid-fire cannons, laser beams striking across Prowl&#39;s armor and also\nheading at Iris.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Well, she&#39;d got his attention at least.\n&gt; Iris backed up towards the CF, rifle shouldered and ready to fire\nagain.\n&gt; By now Prowl had noticed her and was charging, her mind quickly\ngoing over \n&gt; her armory to see if there was something that could do a better job\nthen the \n&gt; gun.\n&gt; There was nothing.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Slag!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Firing off rapidly she aimed all she had at Prowl as he came\ncloser, \n&gt; backing up towards the CF all the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; From across the field IR saw the large form of Prowl moving towards\nthe \n&gt; base, glancing over to see him moving towards a red armored\ntransformer.\n&gt; But that person looked familier so she stopped chargeing at Demon\nWulf and \n&gt; narrowed her eyes.\n&gt; Who...Iris!\n&gt; &lt; PROWL! NO!&gt; She was trying to reach him with her mind, starting\noff \n&gt; towards him to try and get between his teeth and Iris.\n&gt; &lt; Stop! Stop!&gt;\n&gt; Why couldn&#39;t he listen?!\n&gt; She was at a full run, but even that couldn&#39;t save her friend from\nthe \n&gt; monster that was moving towards her. IR already knew too late that\nshe \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t reach her in time.\n&gt; But maybe she could stop Prowl another way, with the time.\n&gt; Linking with his she imagined a very high pitched sound, so high\nthat it \n&gt; made her internal systems rattle, hoping that it was enough to\ndestract him \n&gt; enough to slow him down.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
