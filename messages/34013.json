He fires two missiles at Triggerhappy, gaining altitude.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Supernova/Slasys/Scrap jet avoids the fireball, recieving Zardus&#39;s\norders and firing twenty laser shots at Unicron.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Vycir/Flare jet detects Cutthroat falling to the ground, and fires\none more grenade at him before pulling up.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven looks around for a target, seeing Surgital.

He charges the large robot, firing two missiles from\neach missile launcher at him, four in all heading toward Surgital&#39;s\nback.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;LurkerAbyss&quot; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Triggerhappy/Surgital/Cutthroat::\n&gt; \n&gt;         Triggerhappy did multiple backflips and dodged the\nmissiles.
