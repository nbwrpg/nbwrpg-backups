With the maximal signal showing strongly on her \nscanner, she didn&#39;t want this bot to catch her. Yet at every turn, \nher scanner showed the maximal signature right at her location. Who \never this bot is they are really good at tracking, she thought.\n\nShe was now 5 miles away from Galvatron&#39;s ship.  Her wounds were now \nalmost fully healed due to her energon mech fluid mix in her body.\nShe stopped and sat down.  She waited for a few minutes and then \ncalled out,&quot;Hey you, who ever you are. I know your there. Just come \nout and we&#39;ll talk.&quot; She waited for a reply, but none came.\n\nShe sat back and relaxed against a large rock and waited. nothing \nhappened. An hour passed and yet nothing happened. She called out a \nfew more times but still had no responce. Things just didn&#39;t make \nsence to her. Why would a maximal be following her and not show \nthemselves by now. Why would the auto defence systems to Galvatron&#39;s \nship go off is there wasn&#39;t a maximal around to set them off? She \npondered the question and her logic circuits couldn&#39;t come up with an \nanswer.\n\nShe finally got back up and kept moving. Soon, it would be night fall \nand she&#39;d have to make camp for the night. Maybe by then this strange \nmaximal might show themselves.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
