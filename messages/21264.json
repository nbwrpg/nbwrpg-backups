But she failed to notice that what it was walking on \nwas the bare blue skin of her own arm. All she saw was the little red bug.\n\n&lt; A ladybug &gt; was her thoughts, seeing how cute it was, her mouth turning in \nthe corners to for a smile. But even though she could see the small bug, she \nwasn�t completely awake yet, and also failed to see a whisp of short white \nhair flow across the bridge of her nose, a piece, which made up her bangs.\nIron Raptor just continued to watch the little insect with her crystal blue \neyes, not moving a muscle. But then, as she watched the ladybug, she \nremembered just what had happened, opening both of her eyes as she went \nthrough the events in her mind.\n\nBoth her beast modes had merged and began the conflict, leaving her stuck in \na black nightmarish mode which had been neither but both.\nThen her thoughts skipped to the merge, and remembered closing her eyes�but \nnot opening them again until now.\nWhat had happened during the time that she had been out?\nJust as sudden as mer mind asked the question a flood of images and events \nflushed into her mind, making her sit up in a jerk and press her fingers to \nher temple while supporting herself with her other arm. Her white hair \nmoving in a flurry before settling around her shoulders once again, covering \nher back, chest and thighs.\nIron Raptor closed her eyes as she tried to focus on the images.\n\nThere were millions of sparks, all around and everywhere. But Beyond the \nsparks�beyond them was just darkness.\nBut then, then there was a voice, gentle one that seemed almost to sound \npowerful at the same time. Though, while also sounding as if it was most \nknowledge able but also wanted to know more. Yet, still as if speaking from \na higher plain. It spoke.\n\n� Welcome, Prowl.�\n\nProwl? It was then that she could hear his voice, asking question after \nquestion until finally it all stopped and focused upon one feeling, one, \nwhich made Iron Raptors spark sink along with the feeling.\nAlso hearing the words.\n\nProwl: � And Iron Raptor?�\n\nShe hears Prowl ask, feeling almost as if her spark sank as his did.\n\nVoice: � She didn�t end up here, � they ( both her along with Prowl) heard \nthe voice reply, � But she died in your arms, Prowl.� It finished.\nBut only one whole word in that sentence lingered in her mind, � died�? So, \nshe had died? Or could it just be some sort of dream she couldn�t remember \nhaving? No, this was all too real to be that.\nThen what?\nBut then it all went on; Prowls sadness, then both him and the Matrix? Was \nthat it?\nYes.\nThen, both him and it, no�that, continued to talk back and forth until some \nsort of deal was arranged, one made so that she could live.\nBut then, just after that, the image of the blue sky came into her mind, \nafter being thrown into a body again. Prowls body.\nWere these�Prowls memories?\nOther images flashed in her mind, ones of Prowls old friends and family, of \nwhen he had served under Striker. But then it all went black and there was \nnothing, but then a feeling, one she knew well.\nLove.\nThough, this feeling of love was accompanied by others as well; wonder, \nadmiration.\nAnd then an image of�herself?\nShe could see herself, sitting, eyes closed. But it didn�t look like herself \nat all, not like she remembered.\nWhat she was seeing reminded her of the forms of human women she had seen in \nhistory files before�only this one was larger, and she had long white hair \nand blue skin, the same color as her own. But this woman wasn�t wearing any \ncloths, though all of the privet areas were hidden by the white hair, which \nfell from her head.\nShe was pressing her fingers to her head, and just as Iron Raptor opened her \neyes, so did the woman in her mind. But then something occurred to her, was \nthis herself that she was looking at? And if so, then whose eyes was she \nlooking through at the moment?\nThe image of the woman disappeared as Iron Raptor brought her mind back into \nfocus, lowering her fingers from her temple and then looking at them in \nwonder. However, then she noticed white hair falling over her shoulder, \nmaking it so that she couldn�t see the source of this love that she was \nfeeling.\nIron Raptor then brushed the hair aside, looking up and then finding herself \ngazing towards a�fuzor? No, in her spark and mind she knew who it was.\nHe just looked so�so�different.\nIron Raptor turned her crystal blue eyes towards the mans optics, her voice \nsoft and smooth.*\n\n� Prowl?�\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
