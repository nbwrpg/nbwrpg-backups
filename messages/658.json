So Gangon wanted to defend his little friend. Very well.\n&gt; Tavatron fired her optic lasers full blast at Gangon. She immedeatly\ndropped\n&gt; back into her previous position, behind the boulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dinobot seemed to be holding his own, but she would feel a whole lot\nbetter\n&gt; if he was standing beside her. Something about being away from him didn&#39;t\n&gt; feel... right. Tav sighed, no matter. She would worry about her feelings\n&gt; later. Right now defending the ark was first priority.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3020/7/_/_/_/956959202/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
