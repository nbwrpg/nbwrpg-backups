I&#39;ll make no secret of \nthat. I see that the others are Maximals.  But because we share the \nsame symbol doesn&#39;t mean automatic trust.  Even in the pride lands, \ntrust and loyalty is earned and proven. I do not trust others \neasily.&quot;  She emmitted a low growl.  She kept her eyes on the \nothers.  She would have to have them prove themselves to her as much \nas she would have to prove herself to them. Her code of honor \ndemanded it.  But she thought she could loosen up a bit and give the \nappearence of being more comfortable.  Even when she wasn&#39;t, she \ncould show it to the others and put them on a less a defencive \nstand.  She smiled and nodded. &quot;OK, I see that we are on the same \nside for the moment. I&#39;ll relax as you put it Kluster.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Phobia glanced back toward Savanna, he could see the distrust in \nher \n&gt; eyes, she didn&#39;t seem to be able to look anywhere for more than a \n&gt; second without looking back toward him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Savanna my dear, you can come closer, I don&#39;t bite.&quot; A spider that \n&gt; didn&#39;t bite, unbelievable he thought , he understood her fealings, \nhe \n&gt; would be wary of her if thier posisitions were reversed, but then \n&gt; again she&#39;d be dead, or in chains if the situations were reversed.\n&gt; \n&gt; he was almost glad that the Maximals were more on courtesy and \n&gt; information, or he&#39;d be deleated by now.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
