She \nwas nothing special in her mind. She only thought of herself as a \nwolf just making thing happen.  Letting htings just go according to \nthe Matrix.  Let the paths lead were they may. That was a general \nphilosophy, but not a battle cry. She just looked at him like she had \ngotten slapped in the face.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Gabriel looked at her. &quot;You join forces with your most hated \nenimies.
