Of course, if she had her OLD form, this \n&gt;wouldn&#39;t\n&gt;happen.\n&gt;\n&gt;No point in playing just a flesh animal... she was obviously detected by\n&gt;their scanners, showing up as a bot.\n&gt;\n&gt;She growled inwardly. The next time she gets back to Cybertron... she will\n&gt;personally deal with Alpha Trion... one way or another!\n&gt;\n&gt;The white tiger form stood up upon her paws as she bounced down the cliff\n&gt;from the ridge towards the Pred base. Once off the ridge, she transformed\n&gt;into a fembot... a Beast Machine.\n&gt;\n&gt;She smirked. &quot;Merely.. curious. Just a ... lone Cybertronian.. in search of\n&gt;some answers.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Pausing a moment, watching, her optics viewing & keeping tabs on the\n&gt;defenses. She was taking an awefully big risk doing this.  She may as well\n&gt;jump to her previous plan.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;I seek an audience with the one known as...
