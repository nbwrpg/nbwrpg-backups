The buzzing was familliar. He =\r\ndoes what any Autobot would do to try and defend himself.. Reach for a weap=\r\non he was well adept at using. But it was not there. He had forgotten that =\r\nStraight Shot is his weapon when she transforms into his cross bow. He quic=\r\nkly remembers, and looks down at Vestige.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Rest in peace old friend. I=\r\nt&#39;s all right, eventually I&#39;ll get my bearings.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He bravely prepares to=\r\n defend himself via un armed combat skills.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; And something tells me I&#39;=\r\nll be learning very fast.&quot;\n\nAs Tuscon leaped to his feet he can see that th=\r\ne light of the day was\nbeginning to pass and night was setting in. In the d=\r\nistance he could\nsee what appeared to be shadowy shapes in the air. They lo=\r\noked\ndifferent from the first set of insects that he had seen. These were\nw=\r\ninged, and it was their wings in flight that he heard as they\napproached. A=\r\nlso their bodies were longer, more like hornets, although\nthey had six clea=\r\nver like claws that looked sharp enough to slice\nthrough anything.\n\nThere w=\r\nere three of them moving through the air, in the dimming light\nTuscon could=\r\n just see that their wings were a blue white, their bodies\nwere a darker bl=\r\nue. Their color scheme was startling close to\nScourge&#39;s colors, or perhaps =\r\none of his sweeps. Also Tuscon&#39;s radar\nseemed to be unable to pick up these=\r\n creatures. He could see them just\nfine, but his radar on which he was so u=\r\nsed to depending was unable to\nget a reading on them, and the insects were =\r\nquickly approaching the\ncar, the buzzing of their wings becoming louder and=\r\n louder.\n\nHe could hear that same feminine voice, &quot;We are the horde, and we=\r\n are\ncoming for you. You cannot escape, because there is no where to go.&quot;\n\n=\r\nMeanwhile the car itself was puling in towards some sort of depot,\nalthough=\r\n with the growing shadows of the day it was difficult to see\ninside far eno=\r\nugh to see whether there was any sort of welcoming party\nthere or not.\n\nNea=\r\nrby Vestige moaned and stirred slightly. It would seem that he was\nnot dead=\r\n but had simply fell unconscious, the power requirements for\nthe remainder =\r\nof his healing drawing off too much at once and shutting\ndown his systems.\n=\r\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
