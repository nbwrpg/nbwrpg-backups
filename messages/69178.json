Not much could be done while they were in motion, but Skorponok was already beginning small self repairs on different sections. \n\nMeanwhile outside the area around them rumbled and shook as the gasses and heat leeched into the tunnel Scorponok was forging. While his rear cannon were doing much to seal the tunnel behind them, some Magma was inevitably making its way through. It was not until they had reached several miles in distance that it began to subside. \n\nZarak turned his center  chair to face Perceptor, as he tilted his head and raised a single eyebrow, &quot;Tell me Perceptor, just what kind of report are you intending to give Hydras?&quot;\n\n(TAG: Perceptor)\n\nPreston\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
