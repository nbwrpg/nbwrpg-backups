At the sighted angles of\nthe enemy body, internal systems and years of hardcore war experience\ntracked which positions FireBlade&#39;s body would be in next and warned\nDinobot of impending danger.  He knew that every attempt that the\nenemy made to resist the effects of paralysis were futile and he\ndodged his attack easily, however, the missiles had not missed the\nground in which he had stood second before and on impact they sent\nshrapnel spiraling in every direction. A rather large piece piercing\nthe armor which covered Dinobot&#39;s biceps before falling to the ground.\n&gt; The transmetal raptor snarled at the small trickle of mech-fluid\nwhich emanated from the wound, only glancing at it before continuing\non his way to the location of his downed prey. Approaching FireBlade\nfrom behind he looked the robot over, optics narrowed and searching\nfor any movement which might betray this beings current state.\nSatisfied that this transformer was defeated yet alive, Dinobot\nclipped his weapon into a hip holster before leaning down quickly and\ngoing to grab the back of FireBlade&#39;s head with his clawed hand, then\nmoving to pull back and lift so that the enemy would be lifted to face\nheight. **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at\nhttp://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
