But I still\n&gt; want\n&gt; &gt; to destroy that Predicon now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He continued waiting for an answer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; {Talos}\n&gt; \n&gt;     When Sunhawk had barged in Talos had looked up\n&gt; from what he was\n&gt; studying, in his hand was a small buckler sized\n&gt; chunk of metal, one side was\n&gt; detailed in pink and white with several faded\n&gt; splotches of red. Setting the\n&gt; object aside and turning to regard Sunhawk he\n&gt; sighed.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;We will not be executing anyone Sunhawk. Not\n&gt; these predicons or any\n&gt; other. Our mission is to capture...not serve as\n&gt; judge jury and executioner.\n&gt; That&#39;s not our way, at least not mine. Escort Arc..I\n&gt; mean, Nightshade here\n&gt; to some quarters...and I do mean quarters not the\n&gt; brig Sunhawk, when Hot Rod\n&gt; returns from gathering the stasis pods he&#39;ll be\n&gt; assigned the duty of keeping\n&gt; an eye on her.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Turning to pick up the peice of metal he looked\n&gt; down upon the insignia\n&gt; upon it, even the wear of time could not remove it\n&gt; completely and he had\n&gt; verified it&#39;s authenticity. Nightshade for all\n&gt; practical terms was what she\n&gt; had claimed to be. Maybe it was a mistake assigning\n&gt; Hot Rod to watch her,\n&gt; but he&#39;d be able to tell if Nightshade was really\n&gt; the autobot Arcee or\n&gt; not...\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Dismissed&quot; He said simply, flipping the peice\n&gt; of metal back to it&#39;s\n&gt; owner.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Nightshade smiled and caught the metal lifting\n&gt; her chest plate slightly\n&gt; and slipping it back into a compartment within as\n&gt; she stood and turned to\n&gt; Sunhawk, &quot;We meet again and without you trying to\n&gt; kill me no less...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
