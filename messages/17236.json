She glared at this disrespectful, arrogant, \nself absorbed bot. She was about to lose her last nerve and let \nLadyHawk have it. She knew that she would have to go and calm down or \nscrap this femme. &quot;ZARDUS!&quot; She realized she yelled and immediately \nlowered her voice,&quot;Zardus, If youhave no futher need of me, I would \nlike to go to my room for a bit.&quot;\n\nShe turned and walked off without waiting for Zardus to reply.  She \nwalked about 100 yards down the hall before she gave in to her hate \nand slammed her hand into the wall. A loud bang could be heard all \nthrough the hallway.  Her fist left a small dent in the wall. She hit \nher fist one more time and then walked, very quickly to her room.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawks eye picked up movement behind her, Battera was following \n&gt; carefully.
