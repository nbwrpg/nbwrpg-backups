She smiled towards it as she drew her hands together and cupped\nthem, giving Gangon&#39;s spark a well place to rest if he chose to lower\nhimself to her outstretched hands.\nBut then a worried expression came to her face, wondering just how his spark\nhad been separated from his body. *\n\n&quot; I was wondering where you had been. What happened?&quot;\n\n* She knew that sparks could communicate telepathically so she knew that her\nquestion would be answered, thinking or just how interesting a story Gangon\nmight relate.\nBut she then heard Prendabot, explaining to her about the terrain around the\nCybertronien Fire, finishing his sentence in her mind of how her action was\nsuicide.\nHowever, what he didn&#39;t know was that she knew all that he said.and had\nprepared for it. She had brought stealth devices, small machines that\nshielded one&#39;s signature and cloaked as well. She knew what she was doing,\nhaving spent years as an assassin for hire.\nBrightBlade then wore a serious expression on her face, one that was needed\nto get her points across when she had some to make. *\n\n&quot; Suicide? No. Difficult? Yes.  Trained skills, experience, and half a\nmillion shards of energon worth of equipment make this mission nothing more\nthen child&#39;s play.&quot;\n\n* She then looked back towards Perndabot to see his reaction, still keeping\nher hands cupped before her chest for Gangon&#39;s spark. Just catching the\nAlliance bot&#39;s eyes sliding down her body makes her feel slightly excited\nand her serious look turns to that of a smile, her body being worth the\nattention of a bot like Perndabot makes her feel slightly special.\nThen standing in the way that showed her every curve again she then hears\nhim ask whom the spark was, the smile still on her face as she looks at\nGangon again. *\n\n&quot; A friend and fellow Predacon.&quot;\n\n* It made her feel good to be in the company of the two males, one with a\nphysical appearance and one without. Gangon with his compliments towards her\nand Prendabot with his preying eyes, still wondering if Perndabot was ever\ngoing to compliment her and if Gangon was ever going to show any serious\ninterest in her. It was strange, Gangon always complimented her but never\nmade a move, never once pretended to stretch and slip his arms around her.\nBut yet it seemed like he liked her, REALLY liked her. And Perndabot just\nseemed to have an interest in her appearance at the moment, though she\ndidn&#39;t mind his roaming eyes she still wouldn&#39;t mind a compliment or two.\nBrightBlade sighed deeply, maybe one day. *\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWish you had something rad to add to your email?\nWe do at www.supersig.com.\nhttp://click.egroups.com/1/6807/13/_/_/_/963750668/\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
