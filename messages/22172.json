He growled, baring his pure white teeth and turned to them. He \nlet the connected chains on his clash sword go limp, to it&#39;s whip \nmode. He raised his arm and struck it at one. He turned and struck \nanother off-line. \n\nThey weren&#39;t all off-line. He withdrew his gun and fired at the rest, \nsmashing the autoguns. He turned his head back to the hallway, where \nhe saw Apocolypse. He growled down at him. He reverted his clash \nsword back to its tightly connected mode, where the bladed chains \ncurved upward.\n\nHe snarled at him and charged.\n\n\n"}}
