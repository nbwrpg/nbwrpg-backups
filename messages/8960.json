She takes a chance and \nruns for it.  She dodges trees and jumps over a small creek.  She \nkeeps going as fast as she can.  She wasn&#39;t one who delt with these \nsituations well. She muttered to herself while running,&quot;What am I \ndoing here? I&#39;m a tech mouse.  I do computer work and fix systems. \nI&#39;m no fighter.&quot;  She felt a jolt of energy run through her memory \nbanks.  She started to remember things from a long time ago.\nShe remembered when she was a predacon and changing into a maximal. \nShe remembered a huge spider trying to kill her.  She remembered a \nstrange bot, part scorpion and snake, who was kind to her.  She \nremembered a scorpion bot who was something dear to her.  She shook \nher head to clear it of her thoughts and kept running.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
