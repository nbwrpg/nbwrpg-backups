She looked like a 7 \n&gt; year old girl with long red hair. She stared at Blackfang. &quot;But, I \n&gt; thought we could all be friends or something.&quot; She looked down. Her \n&gt; face looked as if she would cry soon. She kicked the ground and \n&gt; figgited with her hands. &quot;why can&#39;t we keep her? We&#39;re maximals, so \n&gt; what if she&#39;s different. We can make her a friend can&#39;t we?&quot; She put \n&gt; her little arms around Blackfang&#39;s neck and hugged tight, crying as \n&gt; she hugged him. &quot;She looks like mommy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Blackfang didn&#39;t even bother to reply to Sharpclaw&#39;s answer. He \n&gt; turned\n&gt; &gt; to Cam and took her by the shoulders.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang: Listen Cam, I&#39;d like it a lot if we could keep her, but \n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; place is not with us. We&#39;re Maximals and she&#39;s a Predacon. You saw \n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; friend outside, didn&#39;t you? That&#39;s why she can&#39;t stay. She&#39;s got\n&gt; &gt; friends of her own and she&#39;s supposed to be our enemy. You get that,\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t you?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
