She leaned \nagainst the wall and looked at the femme bot laying there.  She \nshrugged and stood watch.\n\n\n::Battera::\nShe saw Zardus walk by and grinned a little.  She hoped that Zardus \nwould tell that feather head of a bot off, but she knew that that was \nwishful thinking.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Zardus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus nods, agreeing to what Feline said. Hot Rod, Battera, and \n&gt; Cybershark would probably need reprogramming, but how to do that \n&gt; without them knowing... But it didn&#39;t matter. Their data tracks \ncould \n&gt; be cleared, but Hot Rod&#39;s could come in useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We&#39;ll see what Skulletron&#39;s situation is later,&quot; he says, stopping \n&gt; at a door to the CR chambers, he opens it, walking into the lab. He \n&gt; walks over to a table and places Squizzy on it, strapping her in as \n&gt; Battera&#39;s transmission reaches his comm-link.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But reprogramming is a good idea. Can you watch this femm? I have \n&gt; something to attend to. I&#39;ll be back shortly, then we can talk. If \n&gt; she stirs, inject that liquid into her.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He points to a vial filled with green liquid. Turning, Zardus walks \n&gt; out of the door, and to the exit of the base. He passes Battera and \n&gt; opens the door, looking over the femm outside.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking down at the femm, the Alliance commander&#39;s red optics \nrecord \n&gt; data about her, his scanners, along with the Alliance base&#39;s, \n&gt; scanning her. Zardus steps out, the door closing behind him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I assume you&#39;re the bot that has Battera steaming?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------\n\n\n"}}
