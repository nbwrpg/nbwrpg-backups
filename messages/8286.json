She could use the daggers, but he would \nstill have the upper hand on physical strength. She needed an \nequalizer to make things more even.  But she didn&#39;t want to hurt him \nin the prossess.  She flew to another tree a few yards off and \nperched high in the branches.  She figured if she waited, he would \nshow her how to win. She took out a stone and tossed it at him.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Slag I missed again.&quot; Lunarpine watched her fly to tree number \ntwo, \n&gt; heard the hoot and saw her head in the direction of the third tree \n&gt; before seemingly vanishing in the thick branches and leaves.
