It remodulates it&#39;s\n&gt;   frequency after every other hit. However, it also works well on\n&gt;   shuttles as well as missles. Just a thought for our Unicron pain in\n&gt;   the lower base of the spinal structure.&quot; she said with a smirk. &quot;But\n&gt;   for myself, I was looking for possible an upgrade to a different style\n&gt;   of body armor. It would take some work, but it can be made to merge\n&gt;   with the phasic shields and the transmetal skin.&quot;  she hoped he was\n&gt;   picking up on her hints. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; Perceptor:\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; The male smiled and typed some buttons, in the computer&#39;s screen\n&gt;   appeared a large list of diferents types phasic shields and protosonic\n&gt;   blasters, and looking to Reclusa said &quot;What kind of those things are\n&gt;   ya looking for?&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
