How she couldn&#39;t possably know how to \ntransform or even speak?\nIt was impossable to communicate to him that she needed his help, not his \nverble selutions.\n\nAll he needed to do was scan her, that was it. Then he would know just what \nwas going on, that her beast modes had screwed up all of her main systems.\n\nBut, even as she thought this, the rage and bloodlust of her modes was \nbuilding. And she could feel her addrenalin rising, and that was \nbad...really bad.\n\nShe stopped and simply stayed there with her head bowed a bit, looking \ntowards Prowl and simply watching him...still mewing softly.\nHowever, almost every mew sounded as if she were saying Help Me.\nAnd if she didn&#39;t get out of this mode soon, there wouldn&#39;t be a thing in \nthis world that could help her then.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
