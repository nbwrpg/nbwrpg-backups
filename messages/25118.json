We can talk \nthere.&quot;\n\nHe spins and powers his jetpack, flying toward Iron Raptor at top \nspeed, keeping track of Angel Prime behind him. He lands near the \nMaximal commander.\n\n&quot;I gather you wish to end this battle?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor suddenly growled as she recieved Dark Ones \ntransmission, \n&gt; sighing and seeing that Demon Wulf wasn&#39;t coming, giving her a \nslight moment \n&gt; to relax the grip on her sword.\n&gt; He was giving her a chance to get Chordate back without having to \ngive up \n&gt; anything major. Releasing a few captives would be alright...but she \nknew \n&gt; from experience that the Maximals were hard to stop once the rage \nof battle \n&gt; took them.\n&gt; She sighed and straightened herself out, opening her comm-link.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Dark One...I have to say that...the proposition is \nvery...tempting.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She was out of breath and tired, sweating in her suit.\n&gt; Iron Raptor swollowed and lowered her helm, looking out over the \nfield as \n&gt; the battle continued.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; But I need to meet face to face with Zardus about this...while we \nBOTH \n&gt; give the word to stop the fighting. You know my location, tell him, \nI&#39;ll be \n&gt; waiting.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then shut off the transmission to Dark One and opened one to \nall \n&gt; Maximal codes, wondering if they were going to listen to her or \nwill it be a \n&gt; reapeat of that one time when she had to shout to Oblitertron to \nshoot at \n&gt; her instead.\n&gt; It had to be worth the risk.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Maximals!! Chordat&#39;s being held by the Alliance and they&#39;ve said \nthat they \n&gt; would release him if we relaeased their troops that are in our ship \nand let \n&gt; them leave without firing on them.\n&gt; I want you ALL to cease fire on any enemy and converge on my \nposition, if we \n&gt; want our Maximal back alive you&#39;ll do this for him. I don&#39;t want \nhis life \n&gt; hanging on your shoulders just because a few of us might be trigger \nhappy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She kept her comm open as she waited, to all codes. Both Maximal \nand \n&gt; enemy, hoping that the Maximals would listen, and if they didn&#39;t \nthen she \n&gt; would have to do something about it.\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked at her sword, a light show might do, but not to \nhurt \n&gt; anyone, just to get them shocked into listening, if it became that \nbad.\n&gt; Maybe another stream of light except into the cloude, create some \nthunder.\n&gt; Just something.\n&gt; But she hoped that she wouldn&#39;t have to drain her energy to go \nthat.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
