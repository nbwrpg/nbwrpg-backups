Not \nshowing \n&gt; any fright however. &quot;Our power was already absolute, but you could \n&gt; not wield it Megatron. All you did was bring in a filter so you \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have to take the full fall when you cannot win a battle.  \n&gt; And my loyalty is not to you, but to the Decepticons, which is the \n&gt; beggining of all and end of everytthing. Not you, or Soundwave, or \n&gt; even me, but the power which flows through the Decepticon name \n&gt; Megatron. That is what you always failed to know!&quot;  \n&gt; Firestrike looked surprised not knowing where all of these felling \n&gt; came from.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Megatron overheard the last part, and smiled. Yes, that&#39;s it, \nshow \n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt; fury Firestike, he thought to himself. I serve the cause, so must \n&gt; you,\n&gt; &gt; but don&#39;t forget, I have become part of the cause, he continued to\n&gt; &gt; think.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turned around, and held out a hand. &quot;I again apologize for my \n&gt; need to\n&gt; &gt; open fire on you Firestrike, but if you had interfered, Shockwave \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; never have joined us, and our power would not be absolute. But \nyou \n&gt; serve\n&gt; &gt; the cause, our Destiny, and that is all that is importan.&quot; He then\n&gt; &gt; looked downcast. &quot;But showing loyalty helps our cause, don&#39;t \nforget\n&gt; &gt; that.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
