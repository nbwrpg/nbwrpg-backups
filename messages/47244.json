He ran away like a scared little girl \nright after and I&#39;ve been involved in major dental work and morphine.\nSecondly, my ISP deleted my account. They thought they just cancelled \nservice by accident, and it took them a week or so to figure it all \nout.\n\nAnyway, I hope you can understand that this was beyond my control, \nand so I will try my best to work back into the storyline with a few \ncumulative posts today or tomorrow.\n\nThanks,\nDaniel\n\n\n"}}
