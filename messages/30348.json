Speedbreaker dosent looked to bothered. &quot;Good to see you \nmighty\n&gt; Megatron&quot; he blurts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron smiles at Cyclonus and Scourges faith. They were the ones \nhe was\n&gt; most worried about following him. This would be easier than he \nthought.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Motormaster turns to Killfest, &quot;Do what you need to&quot; then he thinks\n&gt; hesitatnly, &quot;I&#39;ll do what I need to&quot;. Motormaster is having problems\n&gt; analysing this. Plus, all he can hear is a roaring laughter. &quot;Shut \nup\n&gt; Wildrider&quot; he yells, as he whirls his body around, bringing a fist \ninto\n&gt; Wildriders head, knocking his head from his shoulders. The smoking \nhole in\n&gt; the top of the body, emits a sickening burning of circuits, and the \nbody\n&gt; falls down, as his computer mutters something about stasis lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns his attention to Megatron. &quot;How do I know you are the real \nthing?&quot;\n&gt; He questions harshly. &quot;We never brought you back to life, and \nAstroblast\n&gt; saw your damaged body thrown from him in the year 2005. We saw you \ncome\n&gt; back as Galvatron. You cant be real&quot; he accuses, visibly upset that \nhis\n&gt; leader, would be portrayed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; He stroms towards Scourge and Cyclonus, &quot;Get off your knees. He&#39;s \nnot the\n&gt; real thing,&quot; He yells at them. Then turns to Megatron, and points a \nfinger\n&gt; accusingly. &quot;How dare you mock the memory of mighty Megatron, you \ncant be\n&gt; the real thing&quot; he says, in rage.\n\n\n"}}
