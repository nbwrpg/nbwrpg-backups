Was there a chance that she could be \ngoing home to Cybertron? She had to take that chance no matter what the \nrisks. She wanted to go home so much.  She would just about anything for the \nchance to go home.\n\n&quot;If you will come down from there, perhaps we can talk.&quot;\n\nShe looked into Scorponoks lab and tried to see the bot inside better. She \ncould see tha outline of the bot, but it hid it&#39;self so well that she \ncouldn&#39;t see a face.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
