Just thought I&#39;d change the subject since it \nain&#39;t OOC anymore)\n\n\nSerpentor/Vehement:\n\n\n\nSerpentor raised his plasma launcher to point at Lunaprine&#39;s head as he \ntransformed into his half-wolf mode.  Serpentor dropped his plasma launcher \nand fell to his knees, his right hand covering where his right audio receptor \nwould be, his left hand trying to do the same.  Serpentor started yelling out \nin pain, clenching his optics for a second to try and think clearly.  He \nopened them back up, firing an optic blast off at the wolfbot in front of him.\n\n---\n\nVehement silently walked along the burnt grass of South Africa, looking and \nsmiling at the carnage.  He raised his left arm, the hand at the end of the \narm changing into a long silver barrel.  He raised the barrel to point at \nLunaprine&#39;s back.\n\nA missile launched off from the barrel out at Lunaprine&#39;s back, the missile \nan energy-signature seeking missile.  Vehement smiled, looking for a new \ntarget.  He didn&#39;t really want to choose just one.  But, since he was allied \nwith the Alliance, it wouldn&#39;t be nice to let one of their ranks die at the \nhands of infidels.  Of course, they were all heathens and would die \neventually, but the Divine One wasn&#39;t back in this realm.  Vehement&#39;s optics \nsensors glowed a bright crimson as he watched a missile launch out from the \nCF and strike him in the chest.\n\nHe didn&#39;t make a sound, his body shaking for a moment.  He stood his ground \nthough.  He looked down to his chest as if barely intersted.  An expression \nof rage reached his face as he saw his ceremonial robes were burnt and \nruined.  He raised his right arm, which changed into the shape of a long \nsilver barrel, two missiles launching out at the Cybertronian Fire as if in \nretaliation.  \n\n"}}
