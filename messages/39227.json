She aims, and fires three impact explosive \ndisks \n&gt;   at the largest target there, Train Wreck. She growls to herself, \n&gt;   &quot;You ain&#39;t gettin away easy this time.&quot; She prepares for another \n&gt;   round of fire.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Axis, who is standing around with Lokk and Seekker, is suprised \n&gt;   when weaponfire starts streaking around him. &quot;Whoa, that was \n&gt;   close!&quot; He turns around, and spots some bots he knows: Train \n&gt;   Wreck, McGowan and her group, and Deemos. He watches the \n&gt;   fighting until Lokk smacks him, &quot;Axis, wake up, we&#39;ve gotta \ndefend \n&gt;   the base.&quot; Lokk draws his twin chain guns, and starts running \n&gt;   towards McGowan, firing continuously. Shells litter the ground, \n&gt;   behind him.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Startled, Axis draws his charging laser, and his missile \nlauncher. \n&gt;   He looks around, unsure of which enemy bot to attack. He yells to \n&gt;   Lokk, &quot;Lokk, which one should I attack?&quot; Exasperated, Lokk calls \n&gt;   back, &quot; Just chose one!&quot; So Axis looks around again, and spots \n&gt;   Barrymore. He follows Lokk firing two missiles at Barrymore, and \n&gt;   powering up his large laser.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   On 6 Jul 2001, at 20:53, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; OOC: The posts confused me so I&#39;m not sure where the battle \nis.
