She then glared at them for a moment before looking off to the side with out turning her head, there had to be a way out! There just HAD to be!\nWith a quiet snarl she then heard her stomach rumble, it being a fairly long time since she had last eaten anything.\nShe looked up and past the bars to the to see the more detailed features of this room she was held captive in, nothing much but a plain metal room. A simple door off to the side and a control panel right beside it, nothing much.\nIron Raptor then looked at the 5 bots standing guard over her, their weapons at the ready just in case something happened that they would not approve of.\nShe then narrowed her optics towards them, knowing that she couldn�t do much even if she did manage to get out.\nBut she still had to try; she had to get back to her Maximals.\nAn annoyed sigh escaped her throat, this couldn�t have happened at a worse time!\nTheir base was nearly scrapped and Liono and his Second-In-Command were off somewhere, not a single thing even leaning in the Maximals favor yet!\n(She doesn�t know that Tigerhawk is back and about the Cybertronien Fire.)\nIron Raptor then moved a little closer to the bars on her hands and knees, not even favoring her wounded hand as it left a fluid trail towards the bars.\nShe looked at each of the five bots again but then back at the weapons they held, if she could snake her hand out between the bard then she could pull one of them to them. If one of the Oblitercons touched the bars then they would be electrified, thus that bots weapon being in her grasp�and control.\nWith a silent snicker she then leaned her weight on her left hand and began to weave her right hand between the bars, the closest bot being Pyro.\nIf she could just grab him and pull him to the bars his weapon would be hers, more of a fair chance of getting out! *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
