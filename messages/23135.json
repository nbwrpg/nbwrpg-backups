I offer you sancuary and repairs in my humble labratory. Can \nyou follow my signal or do you need medical attention?&quot; (His base is \nin Norway.) the signal went out awaiting a response. &quot;Repeat the \nmessage until I give the order to stop it or until it&#39;s responded \nto.&quot; Veratis was anxious to meet all the bots on this planet but was \nto old and weary to travel very far to accomplish such a task. He was \nshort handed at the moment and wasn&#39;t in a hurry to send Foxfingers \nout again.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Shadow Cat flies towards the bumbling speck. As she gains speed, \nshe \n&gt; notices that the small bot was slowing down. Dumbly, she relizes \nthat he \n&gt; wasn&#39;t made for such long, high flights. If he kept going too long, \nhe would \n&gt; either pass out or crash, and if he&#39;s high enough he could get \nseriously \n&gt; damaged. She speed up a bit more, hoping to catch him before such a \nthing \n&gt; occured. The bumbling speck started to droop and go down slowly. \nShe dove \n&gt; down and swooped up, catching the little tyke by suprise. And just \nin time \n&gt; too. He was panting and unable to put up much of a fight, and, in \nthe end, \n&gt; she flew away with him, cradled in her arms, with some scratches \nand \n&gt; milk-teeth marks.8\n&gt; \n&gt; *SNow Tech glanced up as Shadow Cat decended from the air, \ncraddling her \n&gt; precious cargo and crooning softly to it so it wouldn&#39;t be afraid.\n&gt; He sighed and smiled to her when she landed next to him.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You have a way with kids, Shadow, mabey you should think of a \ncareer in \n&gt; baby-sittin!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *Hsadow Cat glared at Snow Tech and smacked him on the arm, but \nwhen the \n&gt; liitle &#39;un started to wake, she began crooning again, reduced to \ngiving him \n&gt; sideways glares.*\n&gt; \n&gt; * NSow Tech grins and turns his back to her, effectivly mooning \nher. He \n&gt; straightens his back and wipes the smile off his face. He presses \nhis \n&gt; com-link and broadcasts a signal.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; To any Maximals in the vaciniety, we have crashed landed and ask \nfor your \n&gt; service. I repeat, we have crash landed and require your services.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * and after a pause, grins evily and adds,*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And we know your out there, we&#39;ve been watching!&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
