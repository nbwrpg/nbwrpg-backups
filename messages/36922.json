He sighs and turns around again, heading back for Maximal City. Five less Maximals, he thinks to himself, but pushes the thought out of his mind as to not depress Iron Raptor if she was sensing him at the time.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Firedrill looks at Prowl, questions in his eyes, the look, of someone\n&gt; who wants to say something, but dosent know if he should. He then opens\n&gt; his lips, as if to start, then looks towards the ground, with a downcast\n&gt; look. He rubs his fingers together indicissevly, then folds down,\n&gt; transforming, and drives off, a scream of rage falling out of his\n&gt; vocals, as they then become engulfed by a siren he turns on.\n\n\n"}}
