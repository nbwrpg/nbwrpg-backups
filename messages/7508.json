She \nwanted to report in with him and Quickstrike.  She turned to \nRowdy, &quot;Ah, home sweet home at last.&quot;\nShe turned and saw a very large bot holding a very large gun to \nDarkmouse&#39;s head and holding another on to Twister.  She cold see \nthat DarkMouse and Twister had guns aimed back at the other bot.\n&quot;OH boy, this is not the homecoming I was expecting.&quot;\n\nShe transformed into bot mode and grabbed her gun out and aimed it at \nthe big bot. &quot;I think we have a situation here.
