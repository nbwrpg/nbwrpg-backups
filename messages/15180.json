Look at us. Fighting amongst each other, pretty \nsoon it will come to fighting. Atma Pseudo and Technosis have already \nleft. You&#39;ve got to be thinking that those Maximals are just laughing \nit up! This is what they want, us to go against each other and kill \nourselves. We have to focus on goals here. Our first goal: Get KitKat \nbetter. Now, if we go with Tarantulas, we&#39;ll get KitKat better. But \nshe wants to go with the Alliance. So what is the point of going with \nTarantulas when we would be leaving there later. I say we just go \nwith the Alliance and get KitKat repaired. I could use some repairs \ntoo. Sharp pains are gowing through me every time I move, and their \ngetting worse. So let&#39;s jsut go with Bolldystrike.\n\n\n"}}
