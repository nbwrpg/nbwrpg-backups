Her comrades in\nstasis. & She \n&gt; would orginially be on Cybertron, hunting down Elita 0ne & the\nFembots & \n&gt; other Autobots. She would be in her first upgraded form. \n&gt; \n&gt; Upgrades... she wanted to get out of this bloody form now. She searched \n&gt; internally. Difficult to find but she found it. it was a technology\nshe was \n&gt; not very keen with. \n&gt; \n&gt; She opened a com back to the ship, to Wheeljack. &quot;Wheeljack.
