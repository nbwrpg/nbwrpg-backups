For now we need to l=\r\nock down the situation and sww what we can\n&gt; salvage.&quot; There was somehting =\r\nmore than anger in LEO&#39;s voice, it was\n&gt; concern. &quot;From the reports I have =\r\nread too many people have\n&gt; disappeared since we have arrived here. Let&#39;s s=\r\nee if we can find some\n&gt; of them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; They quickly enough find themselves=\r\n on the bridge. LEGACY is already\n&gt; there sitting at one of the consoles wh=\r\nile LORD ELDER and TORCA\n&gt; quickly follow behind TALON and STRAIGHT SHOT as=\r\n they enter.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Legacy.&quot; LEO PRIME said as he turned to look at him. &quot;Ac=\r\ntivate the\n&gt; sensor logs for the past hour and give me a visual diplay of\n&gt;=\r\n Nightlight&#39;s energy signature.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a nod from LEGACY as the tu=\r\nrned to complete the task.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the main viewscreen an image of the ARK =\r\nand the surrounding section\n&gt; is displayed. A dot representing NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s=\r\n signature is shown to be\n&gt; inside the ark, and then flying out of it, and =\r\ntravelling some\n&gt; distance. Her signature landing nearly 100 miles away in =\r\na loney\n&gt; isolated area.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What is Nightlight doing out there?&quot; LORD EL=\r\nDER said, obviously not\n&gt; aware of what has been happening.\n&gt; \n&gt; TORCA look=\r\ned similarly confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO held up his hand, &quot;Just a moment.&quot; He said =\r\nas he looked at LEGACY,\n&gt; &quot;Speed us up until we come to the present or unti=\r\nl something happens.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEGACY nodded and the scene sped up and then slow=\r\ned down again as\n&gt; something like RODIMUS PRIME showed up on the screen, or=\r\n atleast an\n&gt; energy signature that looked much like his.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the scree=\r\nn the small dot that represented RODIMUS approached the\n&gt; dot that represen=\r\nted NIGHTLIGHT. They interacted for a moment and then\n&gt; they both vanished.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A teleoprtation device?&quot; TORCA said as he looked at the screen.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n LEGACY peered at his console. &quot;Perhaps.&quot; he siad in his typical cold\n&gt; voi=\r\nce. &quot;The signature at their disappearance resembled a space bridge\n&gt; signat=\r\nure but on a much smaller scale and there were differences in it\n&gt; as well.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; TORCA grunted, &quot;And that was probrably that Dark Rodimus again.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; LEO PRIME nodded to TORCA and then looked around the room.\n&gt; &quot;Suggestions=\r\n on how to find Nightlight now?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
