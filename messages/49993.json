Suddenly,\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Loremaster stopped.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar: What is it, Katya? Is there something\n&gt; wrong?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: I am not certain... It think I saw\n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beyond that forest \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the west... Unless... (she switched to\n&gt; magnetic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resonance) Yes! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is something! A large metallic form about\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; size of a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dropship!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar let out a cry of victory. He jumped on\n&gt; place\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and felt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; overjoyed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar: Yes! Maybe we will beat this stravag\n&gt; planet!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let us go that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; way!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As he started forward, Katya crossed her arms,\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moving and cleared \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her throat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Are you not forgetting something, quiaff?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar: Neg, Katya Kerensky. If it is hostiles\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fear, I do not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; understand why. We are battlemechs after all and\n&gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will move at a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; medium distance from each other. This way, we\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be able to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; retaliate together without fearing group shots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; against both of us. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, I have yet to believe any hostiles are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: I see your point, but let us be prudent.\n&gt; Take\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the lead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And so they went, approaching the Maximal base\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entering scanner \n&gt; &gt; &gt; range.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
