Get Aracnia on the Comm.&quot; He yelled in his gravely \nvoice as he \n&gt; took the command chair.\n&gt;     Inferno shot up from a little nap. &quot;The Royalty! Oh how I have \nmissed \n&gt; her!&quot; He said, enthusiastically.\n&gt;     Rampage grimmaced. He didnt like Aracnia. She knew it and he \nknew she \n&gt; knew it. It didnt matter. At least he would have some intelligent \n&gt; conversation.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aracnia turned in surprise to the comm station. Aerostreak and \nParalysis \n&gt; were there, and somewhere Quickstrike and Darkmouse were around. \nShe walked \n&gt; up to the comm and found that Rampage wanted her..\n&gt;     &quot;What dose he want?&quot; She questioned rather coldly. HE claws \nwere on her \n&gt; hips in a feminine way.\n&gt;     Paralysis looked at her, &quot;He wants to rejoin. The ship is ours \nagian.&quot; He \n&gt; then turned back to his work.\n&gt;     Aracnia thought for a moment. &quot;Call Tarantulas and tell him \nthat Kitkat \n&gt; and her group can move in here, were going back to the ship!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Tarantulas recives the message and turnes to Kitkat. &quot;I have \nrather good \n&gt; news. You can still join us, and have your own base. Ramapge has \nturned over \n&gt; the ship so you can have control of the bunker. It would be wise, \nthis way we \n&gt; can control more area.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
