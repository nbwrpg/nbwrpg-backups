Obfucious didn&#39;t touch\n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt; program.  All he did was look at the code so he didn&#39;t have to start from\n&gt; &gt; scratch.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt; &gt;     Aerotaur flinches as Grounded&#39;s blasts fly past his head.  He wonders\n&gt; &gt; silently why Grounded shot at Deemos when he was so close.  He spots the\n&gt; &gt; knives flying at Trinity and he deftly sprints in front of them.  He\n&gt; manages\n&gt; &gt; to deflect on with his wing but the other imbeds itself in his shoulder.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;YOU WILL DIE!!!!!&quot;  His left arm hangs limp from the knife in his\n&gt; shoulder.\n&gt; &gt; He reaches up and yanks it out of his skin.  Mech fluid sprays onto the\n&gt; &gt; ground.  Using only his right arm he flings the knife back at Deemos.  &quot;He\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; mine Grounded.  This is an old battle.  Keep Trinity safe.&quot;  With that\n&gt; said\n&gt; &gt; he launches himself at Deemos.  He begins slashing at his head with his\n&gt; &gt; energy-bladed staff.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
