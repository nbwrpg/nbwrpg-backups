He then noticed that\nSkyburst was back.\n&quot;Hey Skyburst want to enter a little wrestling match for fun?&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure, sounds cool,&quot; answers Skyburst.\n\nThen Prowl runs by, putting ?????? in a cell, which was close to the med\nbay. He then came back.\n\n&quot;Prowl, you interested in a little wrestling?&quot; Asked Epyon.\n\n&quot;I guess I&#39;ll give it a go, sure,&quot; answers the Maximal Commander.\n\n&quot;Ok, we need one more...&quot;\nEpyon activates his comm unit.\n&quot;Hot Rod, want to have a little wrestling match in the holodeck?&quot;\n\nHot Rod gets the message, and responds, &quot;Ok, I&#39;m on my way.&quot;\nHot Rod turns to Goth and Ghost. \n&quot;Well come on in. Look around, meet some of the guys, and femmes if you\nknow what I mean. I&#39;m gonna go do this wrestling thing.&quot;\nHot Rod makes his way to where the others are located.\n\n&quot;Hot Rod, can we use the one wrestling ring holodeck program you made?&quot;\nQuestioned Epyon.\n\n&quot;Yeah sure, I&#39;ll get it running.&quot;\nHe walks to the nearest computer panel and uplinks to the holodeck\nsystem.\n&quot;Computer, run program: HotRodWWF85.&quot;\n\nIn the holodeck things start to appear. First a black frame of a ring,\nfollowed by the mat and canvas. Then black pads on the floor, and black\nWorld Wrestling Federation ring aprons. Then two black steel steps\nappeared in opposite cornors. Then black WWF turnbuckle pads. And\nfinally red ring ropes.\n\nHot Rod then turns back to the others.\n&quot;It&#39;s all setup. We can go whenever your ready, the holodeck is the best\nplace for this.&quot;\n\nOOC: Sorry, if I did too much in this post. I just wanted to get things\nmoving.\n\n"}}
