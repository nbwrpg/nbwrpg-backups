She kept \nremembering a name, her best friends name, Rion.\nIf her guard had placed her in a pod, could his own have done the same to \nhim? And was he here now, HIS blip she was seeing?\nIf it was so, if it really was him, she would find him.*\n\n&quot; Rion!!&quot;\n\n* She called out once she was 200 meters from where the blip was, her feet \nfeeling burnt, clumbsy and weighted as she kept on running. Her little wings \nfanning and trying to cool her back.*\n\n&quot; RION!!!!&quot;\n\n* Diana screamed as loud as she could before she suddenly tripped on her own \nfeet, her furred form simply falling to the ground.\nShe hadn&#39;t known it before but voltures, they had been following her, and \nnow wheeled around in the sky above as Diana lay there, trying to get to her \nfeet.\nBut she was so tired and her feet had already taken her a far way...any \nfurther was not required of them.\nBut when she didn&#39;t move anymore the voltures began to wheel down towards \nthe fur lump on the sand, finally dropping to the ground and fluffing their \nwings.\n\nDiana raised her head and hissed at them, her fur rising and her claws \nextending, but none of the monsters came close.\nToo tired to rais to her feet, too scared to move. She just stayed ther and \nhissed, trying to make sure that their sharp beaks stayed well away from \nher.*\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
