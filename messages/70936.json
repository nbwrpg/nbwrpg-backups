Confuse the living sparks outa those plane brains.  Primus knows they=\r\n deserve it.&quot;\n\nNight Shift looks to Talon and then looks back toward Tucson=\r\n.  Tucson suddenly senses his friend not too far, as he turns his head to d=\r\nirect an ear in his direction.\n\n&quot; I know what you&#39;re thinking Night Shift. =\r\n But, if you put equal distance between the two of us, you can cover two co=\r\nmrades at the same time.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;Oh yeah, duh, I should know=\r\n that.  You&#39;re right.  I cover you, and Talon at the same time.  Rely on Ra=\r\ndar..  And so far, my radar&#39;s got more than just a couple of bogies on scre=\r\nen.&quot;\n\nTucson catches the same threat via his sonar systems.\n\n&quot; So, this is =\r\nhow Hydras wishes to play..  I have a feeling that unless we lure him out o=\r\nf his fortress, he will use that as an excuse to shield himself from impend=\r\ning danger and walk out of this unscathed.  Just like him to do that.  Kup,=\r\n I need you to do something for me.  I need you to really stir things up en=\r\nough so that Hydras is forced out of hiding, along with Cyclonus.  We get t=\r\nhem away from the fortress and we&#39;ve got a better chance at defeating them.=\r\n  It&#39;ll be like getting a hermit crab out of its shell.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile at the =\r\nfortress, Rat Trap nodds as Windlord implements one of his transmetal feath=\r\ners in hopes to open up the hole in the wall.  He provides his comrade with=\r\n enough light to see what they&#39;re doing.\n\n&quot;There, just enough light ta see =\r\nwhat we&#39;re don&#39; but not enough ta draw attention.&quot;  I just hope Wheels can =\r\ncook up a plan ta divert those uglies outa here so we can get in without in=\r\ncident.&quot;\n\nBack at the Ark, Quickstride finds himself overwhealmed with dark=\r\nness, yet with his stubborn mantality, he refuses to give into his surround=\r\nings.  He keeps the same stubborn look on his face, as he always did, like =\r\na mule refusing to move from his position.\n\n&quot; Rodimus, if you can hear me, =\r\nI&#39;d definitely bump up security in the Ark..

But he could see that it would b=\r\ne difficult to \n&gt; achieve, but was still determined to carry out his promis=\r\ne.  He keeps an \n&gt; attentive ear out on the situation, while trying to get =\r\na silent com over to \n&gt; Windlord, Rat Trap, Kup, Straight Shot, and the oth=\r\ners.  He starts by \n&gt; contacting Kup and his team.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Tucson to Kup, ov=\r\ner.  The enemy seems to be gaining ground but it could be \n&gt; some time befo=\r\nre they reach us.

What&#39;s your position?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap responds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Umm, we did=\r\nn&#39;t exactly get inta the fortress Wheels... We&#39;re tryn&#39; but the \n&gt; only hol=\r\ne we could find was a crevace in the wall.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson responds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; As=\r\n long as you&#39;re both safe, that&#39;s all that counts.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap sighs.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;Ain&#39;t good enough Wheels, I want this ta work, not fail.  The only way =\r\nta \n&gt; get in is ta blast this wall, but that&#39;ll start a riot for sure, and =\r\nwe \n&gt; don&#39;t wanna do that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson thinks for a moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmmm... =\r\n You&#39;re right about the shots, we wouldn&#39;t want to do that...  But \n&gt; a che=\r\nmical agent, similar to acid, may be able to burn a way into that wall, \n&gt; =\r\nwithout making any noise or disruptive movement..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap raises an =\r\noptic.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ohhh yeahhhh, an acidic compound...

I found thi=\r\ns while scrounging one day...  An old battery cell I \n&gt; picked up somewhere=\r\n..  All we gotta do is open this up, get to the acidic \n&gt; chamber, and see =\r\nif that eats through the wall.  Windlord, got anything \n&gt; sharp ta cut inta=\r\n this?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Back at the ark, Quickstride is taken aback by what is happeni=\r\nng to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What the?  Rodimus, is it me or did everything just go dar=\r\nk?  I don&#39;t like \n&gt; this...
