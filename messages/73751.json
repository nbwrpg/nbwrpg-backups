I can only tell you he came back to the Earth to\ntry and strip it of whatever was left.&quot;\n\nTHRUSTOR shrugged, &quot;After the humans were almost wiped out by our\nbattles with the Autobots and Maximals the Earth really hasn&#39;t been\nthat good for us any more. We really doon&#39;t know why he came back.&quot;\n\nNow the history that THRUSTOR and HELLSCREAM spoke of was NOT the\nhistory that HYDRAS knew. In HYDRAS&#39; world, the EARTH was still a\nblue/green planet filled with humans ready for the crushing, full of\nmineral and energy resources that still be taken. It was not this ball\nof rusting dust that he was seeing now.\n\nIt would look like here the war between the AUTOBOTS and DECEPTICONS\nnever truely stopped and the PAX CYBERTRONIA had not restored peace to\nCYBERTRON. From the looks of things the MAXIMAL UPGRADE happened, but\nso many other things were different. Like the EARTH here in this\nuniverse was largely a war torn world.\n\nSomething was very very wrong. It was as if HYDRAS were in a different\nuniverse, where the things of his universe had not happened here.\nWhere ever he was, he was not home.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n 8/11/12, C &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras,\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras growled and said &quot;Tell me everything that your former boss knew!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hydras growled and said &quot;Show me all the recourses, bases and factions\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this planet!!!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; HELLSCREAM looked over at HYDRAS as if he had gone crazy. &quot;Um . . sir\n&gt;&gt; . . . we have only been here a little while ourselves and our former\n&gt;&gt; leader . . &quot; HELLSCREAM gestured in the direction that they just came\n&gt;&gt; from. &quot;He wanted a specific type of energy.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Shrugging HELLSCREAM continued, &quot;The humans are hiding elsewhere on\n&gt;&gt; the planet, and other small groups of PREDACONS are on the planet as\n&gt;&gt; well.&quot; He frowned, &quot;And a few MAXIMALS have arrived.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; HELLSCREAM turned to go back to work, &quot;That&#39;s all we know.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
