He looked over the name then \nscrolled the computer quickly down and scanned the information, to anybot \nelse the screen was nothing but a blur but to Dinobot it was as clear as \nday.\nBy the time that he was through scanning and stopped scrolling the computer \nscreen was on a completely other name.\nDinobot sat back in his chair and tapped his claw on the table in thought, \nso this was proving as not such a waste in time as he had thought.\nHe growled as his systems replayed the information back on his internal \nscreen, he looked over it and came to a conclusion.*\n\n&quot; This...Transanulas is neither, Neutral. He was cloned off of the Predacon \nsoldier Tarantulus and now exists as an oppertunist. He uses bots and \ndisposes of them when their talents are no longer useful.&quot;\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
