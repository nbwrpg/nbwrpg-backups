No one was acknowledged him when \nhe arrived. This base had to be the location where Black Arachnia \ntold him to go. \n\nHe looked around with a glower. A thought came to his mind that \nsomething was wrong. The gang of Predacons that came here could have \nbeen ambushed. Perhaps by Megatron. Or Hell Beast.\n\nThat didn&#39;t settle him any more. He hated Hell Beast more than he did \nMegatron. \n\nHe groaned and took off to the side of the ship. He had to find a way \nin, even if it meant breaking in.\n\n\n"}}
