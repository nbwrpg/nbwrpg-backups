Its 12:17 am and I am in a very very bad mood.\n&gt;\n&gt;I had lots of arguments about this US VS Canada thing but I don&#39;t want to \n&gt;further this flame war, so I&#39;ll keep them to myself. The next person to \n&gt;post a pointless OOC will get severely punished, I am not kidding. If you \n&gt;want OOC, go to the damn message board. I made it for a reason.\n&gt;\n&gt;::Zardus::\n&gt;\n&gt;Zardus nods, walking into the Iron Fist and heading for the conference \n&gt;room. &quot;I&#39;ll show the status once we&#39;re in the conference room. Its easier \n&gt;with the aid of hologram projectors.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;While he walks, his comm answers a few messages, though none were heard \n&gt;externally. &quot;Yes, you may, Punch,&quot; he replies to Punch and then goes on to \n&gt;reply to Dark One.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Judging from your performance in the last battle, a raise that generous \n&gt;isn&#39;t really in order right now. However, I will raise it by 40 kilograms, \n&gt;and maybe more if your team improves. Your payment right now will be \n&gt;waiting for you in storage room 7. You may use Lab 8 in the Iron Fist for \n&gt;upgrades.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;With that he enters the conference room, sitting down and motioning for \n&gt;Daemos to do the same.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
