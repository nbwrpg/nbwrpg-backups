He lifted off into the \nair, giving \n&gt; more power to his engines and energizing his weapons.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rest of the Oblitercons got up and began to ran after Dark One, \nspreading \n&gt; out so they couldn&#39;t all be hurt by large blasts.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Defensor seperated, the five robots arming their weapons to go \nafter the \n&gt; Oblitercons.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch watched Beeline strafe missiles with his optic blast, \none \n&gt; getting through and knocking Double Punch back, the explosive \nshells and \n&gt; other blasts knocking him to his back.  He raised both pinchers, \nlaunching \n&gt; one energy-signature seeking missile at Sideswipe, another of the \nsame type \n&gt; from the other pincher at Torca.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector raised his backside,  his stinger pointed at Torca.  He \nfired off \n&gt; two stinger missiles at the Maximal, hovering in his \nlionfish/hornet mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror flew to the left, the missile knocking him out of the way \nof other \n&gt; shots.  &quot;SLAGGING MAXIS!&quot; he yelled frustrated, lifting one arm and \nfiring \n&gt; three ion disks at Ratchet, another three from the opposite arm at \nKluster.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Bumblebee fired off a two optic blasts off at Ratchet.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sixshot stumbled back, but keeping his balance, as the missiles \nexploded \n&gt; against his armor.  He made no expression even though he was in \ngreat pain \n&gt; and raised his arms.  He fired two blasts from both guns, sending \nfour blasts \n&gt; from his hypersonic concussion blasters at Sky Lynx.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Ares jumped to the side, dodging the missiles and shots, the blasts \nof the \n&gt; missiles scarring his armor, leaving numerous burnt marks that were \non the \n&gt; brink of breaking open and exposing mech-fluid.  He got up in pain, \nfiring \n&gt; off a grenade at Sideswipe.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher destroyed the incoming missiles with optic blasts and \nflew off \n&gt; after Vehement as ordered by his leader, no longer caring about \nthis petty \n&gt; feud.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector intercepted a few shells with an optic blast, several \nmore blowing \n&gt; apart a chunk of his armor and knocking him down, the Brotherhood \nmember \n&gt; gripping his leaking mode.  He flew off after Sun Crusher, gaining \nvelocity \n&gt; quickly, not wanting to participate in the battle anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; The second-in-command watched Iron Raptor with recollection.  He \nremembered \n&gt; the sword and saw it charging up.  He transformed to his bat mode, \nusing the \n&gt; thirty foot wingspan to his advantage, which is much larger than \nhis wings in \n&gt; biped mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; But there were numerous small patches that looked badly burned, and \nNemesis \n&gt; knew they would give way and the numerous gaps would allow enough \nto come \n&gt; through and blow him to the Inferno and the Void at once.  He \ncovered up his \n&gt; ten foot form as best he could , preparing for the inevitable.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot watched a familiar scene and shook a finger towards \nIron Raptor.  \n&gt; &quot;Nope, nope, nope.  We aren&#39;t going through this again.  But should \nI do what \n&gt; I plan to do? After all, won&#39;t Nemesis still be injured?  Oh, \nwell.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He reached into the depths of his subspace pocket, pulling out a \nsquare \n&gt; charge several inches thich and a foot wide.  He pressed a large \nred button, \n&gt; throwing it as hard as he could.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis&#39; sensors told him the blast was coming pretty fast, and \nthen his \n&gt; scanners picked up a charge.  &quot;SCATTERSHOT!  WHAT THE SLAG ARE YOU \nDOING!?&quot; \n&gt; he screamed, knowing Scattershot could hear him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m saving you!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HOW THE SL--AIIIIIE!&quot; he screamed as the charge was hit by the \nblast and \n&gt; exploded, the explosion protecting Nemesis from IR&#39;s blast, but the \ncharge \n&gt; exploded nonetheless and hit Nemesis, sending him crashing downward.\n&gt; \n&gt; He hit the ground from several dozen feet up in the air, painfully \nreverting \n&gt; to biped mode and slipping into a near state of stasis lock, unable \nto move \n&gt; but still awake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot sighed.  &quot;Guess he can&#39;t thank me now!&quot; he yelled in \nanger, \n&gt; turning to Iron Raptor and firing down ten armor piercing rounds at \nher left \n&gt; shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf saw the oncoming blast and opened his chest wide to let \nit hit a \n&gt; good spot.  The blast struck and knocked him back a few meters, the \nVok \n&gt; creation slamming to the ground, not getting up with a charred \nchest.  He let \n&gt; out a weak growl, his body starting to glow red.\n\n\n"}}
