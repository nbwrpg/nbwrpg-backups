He laughed, stumbling back as a third shot hits him in the chest.\n\nThe Oblitercon growled, transforming into his HUMVEE mode and driving at \nNecromancer, firing.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKoj&#39;s shot hit the outside of Pyro&#39;s cannon, leaving a dent in it. The \nAlliance member yelled in rage, scorching the forest while trying to hit Koj \nwith his flames.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScavanger yelled as a blade went halfway through his cannon. He jumped back, \ntransforming into bot mode and landing a few feet from the Maximal femm.\n\nTaking a rocket launcher out of subspace, the bot fired it at Tavatron, \naiming for her feet.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDark One and Firearm hovered a few dozen feet away from each other, both of \nthem having their weapons ready. The Alliance bot watched his opponent \ncarefully, waiting for him to make the first mode.\n\nFirearm growled, his weapons ready as well. He glanced quickly at the ground, \nseeing the seperate scirmishes beneath.\n\n&quot;How about a deal?&quot; Firearm said, loudly enough for Dark One to hear. It was \nobvious to him that this bot had some authority, and he could see a way to \nlimit the bloodshed, &quot;We fight right now. Just me and you. If I win, you \nleave these Maximals alone, if you win, we&#39;ll leave.&quot;\n\nDark One considered the offer carefully, looking over the bigger bot in front \nof him. He was positive that he could take him. He had, after all, taken on \nmuch bigger bots before. &quot;Agreed.&quot; he said, activating his comm as he nods, \nsending a transmission to all the Oblitercons.\n\n&quot;Hold your fire,&quot; the transmission read, &quot;Me and the Maximal commander here,&quot; \nhe figured Firearm was the highest ranking Maximal, since he was the one that \noffered the duel, &quot;Are going to fight one on one. Untill then, there will be \nno further fighting, understood?&quot;\n\nHe looked back at Firearm, nodding. &quot;I&#39;m ready, Maximal.&quot;\n\nFirearm grinned. &quot;Maximals,&quot; he said into his comm, &quot;I&#39;m gonna take their \nleader on a one-on-one. Whoever wins will be the winning faction of this \nbattle. It&#39;ll help limit the bloodshed. Hold your fire untill then, guys. \nThis&#39;ll be over shortly.&quot;\n\nFirearm turned back to Dark One, his sword ready. &quot;Well, shall we?&quot;\n\nDark One laughed, firing a plasma rifle into the Maximal&#39;s chest. The two \nbots flew toward each other, their swords clashing when they met...\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Oblitercons stopped firing as they got the transmision, holding their \nfire. Each one looked at their Maximal opponent, ready to fight in case the \nMaximals didn&#39;t follow the agreement.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProto&#39;s eyes widened as he recieved Firearm&#39;s transmission, the Maximal \nflying back a bit to give the two enemies space for battles.\n\nHe hoped that Firearm knew what he was doing, a dead Maximal was not the \ngreatest thing in the world to get out of this mission.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl recieved Firearm&#39;s orders as he flew into the battle, frowning as his \ncomputer reports the message to him. A duel?\n\nProwl shook his head, hovering in the air a few dozen feet behind the two \nduelers. He wouldn&#39;t have trusted the Alliance with a one on one duel, but \nperhaps it was possible...\n\nProwl glanced at the ground, hoping that the Maximals would hold their fire.\n\n"}}
