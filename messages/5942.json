Her sensors told her a bot was nearing her \nquardnants.  With the electricity of the storm, it messed with her \nscanners,  She couldn&#39;t tell if it was the Pred or not.  she figured \nit was the Pred.  She looked around for something to hide behind.  \nBut it was all flat land and ice. The snow was coming down harder \nnow.  She layed down on the ground.  Soon, the snow would cover her \nup and hide her.  She figured that if the electricity was messingup \nher scanners, it would mess with the other bot&#39;s as well.  She \nreadied her small gun and waited.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; The wolf continued to follow her trail, he got a partial \nmessage,&quot;Hey \n&gt; Lunarpine, I&#39;ll&quot; The message was cut off.
