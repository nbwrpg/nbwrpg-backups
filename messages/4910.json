The electric shock she \ngot almost made her lose consousness.  She fell down the side of the outside \nwalll fo the base.  It took her a moment to get her bearings and she flew \noff into the trees.  Her color blending in making her almost invivible. \nRattled, damaged, feeling betrayed, she took to the trees and found a very \nhigh branch that would support her weight.  She hung up side down and waited \nfor internal systems to repair themselves.\n&quot;Oh boy,  I got turned into this TM3 for nothing.  Now I will never make it \nhome.&quot;\nShe hung there in silence and in pain.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
