What&#39;s the fun of RPing when all you read is angry \nposts?\n\n* Irons feet slammed against the ground with a thud and earth shot up in \nevery direction, the ground shaking.\nShe&#39;d gotten hit by half of Marine&#39;s shots but was still going strong, \nthough acir leaked from small cuts and gashes that scared her chest and \nstomach.\nIR had landed almost nose to nose with Marine but what would a 20 foot \nnightmare possibly have in mind for an enemy such as him?\nShe bared her teeth, black lips pulling back to show two sets of jaws, one \nbehind the other. Acid/saliva dropped from her lips while her eyes focused \non Marine.
