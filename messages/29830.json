Iron Raptor had ignored her and \njust left \n&gt; her behind. She stood their astounded. How could her best friend \nignore her \n&gt; so? It stung at Shadow Cat&#39;s eyes as she tried not to cry. &lt;Every \none is \n&gt; leaving Me&gt; She thought. &lt; I&#39;m glad Snow tech is still around&gt; She \nfrowned, \n&gt; where was her brother anyway? He should of been here by now! She \nturned to \n&gt; where she had left him and called his name.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; SNOW TECHHHHHHH! WHERE ARE YOU?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * The bushes ruffled and Snow Tech stepped out. He looked up at her \nwith \n&gt; embarrassed eyes.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Whats wrong with yo....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Shadow Cat stopped. She had spied what had made the young bot \nembarrassed \n&gt; enough to turn red. There, hanging from each nipple, was the \nkittens, trying \n&gt; to suckle.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s not my fault! They rushed me!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Shadow Cat did not hear her brothers plea of innocents, she was \nlaughing \n&gt; hard enough to split her gut. As she regained her breath, Snow Tech \ntugged \n&gt; on one of the kittens.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Shut-up and help me get them off, they&#39;re stuck!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Giggling, Shadow Cat went to help him, grabbing a kitten by it&#39;s \nwaist and \n&gt; pulling. When it didn&#39;t let go, she pulled harder. When it STILL \ndidn&#39;t let \n&gt; go she started pulling in earnest, tugging on it till it pulled \nSnow tech&#39;s \n&gt; *AHEM* nipples till they stretched out as long as the kitten its \nself!*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; OW! OW. owowowowwww! STOP! IT HURRRTTTTTSSSSSS!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   *Snow Tech whined and pleaded with tears in his eyes.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Just rip off my tit! GOD PLEASE STOP!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And, with a loud pop, the kitten came off. Snow tech rubbed his \nsore boob \n&gt; and gave a dirty look at the small kitten. Shadow Cat smiled*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; There&#39;s still one more to go!&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
