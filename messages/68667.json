He \n&gt; &gt; then notices Decible&#39;s missile incoming. He turns away \n&gt; &gt; from the hatch, back to the wall.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Elder: Evasive manuvers! We&#39;re under missile lock!\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite her damage Phobia is able to stay in the air holding aloft\n&gt; the\n&gt; dangling form of Deepstryke. Now more wary from shot from behind she\n&gt; is\n&gt; able to take more evasive action as the rapid fire shots come from\n&gt; the\n&gt; Maximal shuttle (Elder). She swung to one side and then the other as\n&gt; the cord from her swung at crazy angles almost jerking her through\n&gt; the\n&gt; air. As the last of the shots flies wide she streaks high into the\n&gt; air\n&gt; her boosters pushing at thier limits! Like some meteor or perhaps a\n&gt; comet she pushed through the skies her form seeming to almost light\n&gt; up\n&gt; as the air from the resisting atmophere heats up her armor turning it\n&gt; bright oranges, but she continues flying!\n&gt; \n&gt; Decibel fires another volley of missiles at the Maximal shuttle\n&gt; before\n&gt; she too fires her engines and streaked into the upper atmosphere. it\n&gt; was time to leave, even though she wanted so much to stay and pummel\n&gt; the Maximal ship with missiles! \n&gt; \n&gt; Tummult fired a round and grazing at the ground trying to cover\n&gt; Nightstrike and Darkfate, but so far he couldn&#39;t tell if they were\n&gt; staying to fight on, or preparing to leave. He shrugged internally,\n&gt; they had heard the order to retreat, if they wanted to stay and fight\n&gt; .\n&gt; . . he sighed, &quot;Nightstrike, Darkfate, get your rusted aftplates in\n&gt; the\n&gt; skies NOW! We are LEAVING!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tummult&#39;s boosters fired as he also pushed higher into the skies, not\n&gt; one to hang out when there was nothing to win.\n&gt; \n&gt; Below them on the ground the hover tank continued to fire on the\n&gt; minions, his powerful cannon sending punishing blasts of plasma into\n&gt; the air. However as only Nightstrike and Darkfate are still in the\n&gt; vicinity they recieve his full attention!\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Da&#39;minion & Legacy)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n&gt; \n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
