A little heavy sparked, she walks \ndown the baddly beaten up halls and to the entrance.  She really \ndidn&#39;t want to have to assess all the damage to the ship, but she had \nto note it all for her reports.  She hung her head and walked down \nthe ramp.  She walked out a bit to get a good view of the ship.  It \nwas totalled.  The hull was looking like swiss cheese.  The side \npanels were more or less melted. The ramp was burnt.  The main \nstructure of the ship was graoning a bit.  She knew the comp room was \ntotalled..again.  She sighed and looked at the once great ship, now \nin total ruin.  She looked down and sighed.  She whispered, &quot;I failed \nto protect your ship Striker, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  She looked up and went \nback into the ship.\n\n\n"}}
