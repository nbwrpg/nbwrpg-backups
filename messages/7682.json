Her sence f smell\n&gt;was stronger in beast mode, but in bot mode, it was still a strong\n&gt;sence. &quot;Yeah, I smell it too.  I think that they went that way.&quot;  She\n&gt;shined the light down a long tunnel.\n&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;\n&gt;She walked down the tunnel and found it emptied into a larger cave\n&gt;with a pool in the middle of it.\n&gt;&quot;I can smell thier scent. It&#39;s really strong in this part of the\n&gt;cave.&quot;\n&gt;She looked around but didn&#39;t see them. &quot;I wonder where they went?&quot;\n&gt;Her instincts kicked in and she had a cold chill run up her back. She\n&gt;transformed back into wolf mode and looked about.  She saw large\n&gt;ripples in the pond and saw the foot prints in the dirt on the cave\n&gt;floor.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Rowdy Wolf:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rowdy Wolf galloped as fast as he could after KitKat.

He didn&#39;t expect it to be this warm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He came to stop with KitKat at the mouth of the large cave. He put\n&gt;his ears\n&gt; &gt; to their sides and looked up. He sniffed around, smelling another\n&gt;bot.\n&gt; &gt; Female.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I smell someone.
