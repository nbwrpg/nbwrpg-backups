This particular setup confused him a great deal.  While he\n&gt; would assume Rodimus was familiar with how an Earthern medical facility was\n&gt; setup, he would not think that the medics here who were treating him would\n&gt; have made such an exact match, or even set it up according to such\n&gt; parameters if they had no datatracts.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nPerhaps it was some element of information had crept through into\nthese being&#39;s datatracks after all, or perhaps they were lying and\nknew far more than they were revealing, or perhaps it was just that\nthey were transmetal and so were partly biological and partly metalic,\nand so their rooms were a very much like a biological life&#39;s hospital\nas much as they were a mechanical repair shop.\n\nIn any case the room, while superficially resembled a hospital, it is\nobvious from the faint smell of lubricant and metal that no human\ndoctor would find this room usable as recovery chamber. The healing\ntools in this room, rather than being syringes and scapels, were\ninstead laser cutters and wrenches, along with other assorted high\ntech scanners and devices.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Wheelie&#39;s menaderings within his processor were cut off over by the\n&gt; gesticulations from Rodimus as he responded, &quot;You&#39;re in bed.  You look like\n&gt; you asked Grimlock to dance on your head.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS&#39; optics brightened, &quot;Grimlock!&quot; he said as he swung his legs\nover the side of the bed. &quot;Did I see Grimlock?&quot; He looked around the\nroom and then back at WHEELIE, it was as if he were trying to jog a\nsluggish memory.\n\nRODIMUS slid out of bed and onto his feet, he was definitly looking a\nlot stronger now. He reached over trying to dislodge the final energon\ndrip that was still attached to him.\n\nHe shook his head, &quot;My memory of what brought me here is kind of\nfuzzy.&quot; With an almost startled look he straighted as a part of his\nmemory crystalized. &quot;Have you seen Cyclonus here? He was with me when\n. . . whatever happened.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
