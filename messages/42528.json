She jumped out of her seat and \nran down the hall towards the armory.  She slid down the flight of \nstairs and ran into the room.  She grabbed a photon rifle.  She ran \nback to the bridge. It was then her logic circuits twitched. She \ntried to sound sincere in her question,&quot;Pardon my ignorance \nGalvatron,but if the sensors are correct, and the base is actually \ninside a volcano, how do we get inside? Won&#39;t we melt our mother \nboards just getting that close to the molten lava before actually \ngetting inside? Or is there another way into the base? I only want to \nunderstand the logistics of this, so I can help out better than I did \nlast time. I wasn&#39;t very helpful last time around. So I wish to prove \nmyself this time.&quot; she said, holding her head up and her optics \nlooking at Galvatron.\n\n\n"}}
