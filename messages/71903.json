However if you\n&gt; are drawing from Animated versions of Prowl an=\r\nd Jazz and Prime, then\n&gt; we can make some alterattions. Perhaps they are fr=\r\nom a later version?\n&gt; I am trying to get a feel for them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which toon i=\r\ns the inspiration for your characters of Tuscon,\n&gt; Nightshift and Straight =\r\nShot?\n&gt; \n&gt; - preston\n&gt; \n&gt; On 8/25/11, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nat&#39;s an interesting question.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would probably say, Tucson is G2, d=\r\nue to the fact that he&#39;s quite a bit\n&gt; &gt; younger than Leo Prime.  That also=\r\n includes his sister, Straight Shot, who\n&gt; &gt; probably were transported off =\r\nCybertron and near Atlantis so is to allow\n&gt; &gt; them ample time to recover f=\r\nrom near traumatic injuries.  Tucson was taken\n&gt; &gt; off line after he got pe=\r\ngged by Cyclonus and was in some sort of Stasis lock\n&gt; &gt; for a couple of vo=\r\nrns.  Then he travels to Ancient Earth with Perseus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightshift is =\r\nalso G2, how he got to Ancient Earth was probably due to the\n&gt; &gt; fact that =\r\nas a pretender, he had connections even with Decepticon forces,\n&gt; &gt; and som=\r\nehow hitched a ride with them, ending up on Ancient Earth.\n&gt; &gt; Nightshift i=\r\ns definitely built with a vehicle alt form, and he finds it hard\n&gt; &gt; to ada=\r\npt, but does the best he can under his circumbstances.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s the b=\r\nest I can think of for now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cy=\r\nclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Here is are interesting questions =\r\nfor each of our characters. So many\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of us I think have created charact=\r\ners on the fly and have inserted\n&gt; &gt;&gt; them in the game or perhaps have been=\r\n given the character by someone\n&gt; &gt;&gt; else, and the history is sparse.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; However I would think that after all this time it is safe to assume\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; that no matter how we got the character, these characters are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; compl=\r\netely ours now. So now we can create, reboot or whatever our\n&gt; &gt;&gt; character=\r\n&#39;s history so that they chime in with our portrayals of them.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Did your character come from G1/G2 time frame and some how appea=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt;&gt; here, did they live through the great war and transport to old Earth=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; from the future Beast Wars time frame or were they constructed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; s=\r\nomewhere else?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If they did have a vehicular alt mode, why have th=\r\ney maintained it on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ancient Earth where there are no roads?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; All questions to ask ourselves about our characters. These are all\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; ways we can expand our knowledge of the characters we play - whether\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n we created them or given to us, and I look forward to the answers.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
