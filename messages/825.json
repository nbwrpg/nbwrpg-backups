She cowered, ducking her head, and backed behind a boulder. She \nwasn&#39;t going to be caught in this. She didn&#39;t want to be spotted. Not yet. \nHer plan was to meet up with the Maximals and act more damaged than she was, \nasking for Primal. She wasn&#39;t going to blaze in. She had to keep low until \nall of this blew over. She snarled to herself from behind the boulder and \ntwitched her tail.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
