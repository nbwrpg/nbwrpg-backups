He found the bridge and entered sitting in the\nfirst officers chair and putting his feat up. The bridge design was larger\nthan the last Predacon ship he had been stationed on but similar in\nconstruction. The seats were designed to fit nearly any form so his spider\nlegs didn&#39;t present a problem for him. He looked up at the viewscreen\nremembering the days he&#39;d manipulate the commander into a foolish act so he\ncould replace him with an even more gullable first officer. Phobia\nremembered back to when he got his own ship from the scavengers who&#39;d found\nhis ship and crew after the temporal wave had hit them. &quot;Poor fools&quot; he\nthought as he sat there in a position of power,&quot;They never knew what killed\nthem.&quot;\n\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
