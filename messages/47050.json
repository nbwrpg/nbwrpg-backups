He knew they wanted \nMistra... A new rookie was too much power to let your enemy have it \nwithout a fight.\n\nAzureBlade: And who might you be, lady? You know it is unsafe to \ntravel alone in this forest. There are many wolves, and legends even \nspeak of a dreadful dragon. You should be more careful.\n\nSeeing Mistra move next to him warmed his heart. It seemed as though \nshe had made her choice.\n\nHe made a quick evaluation of the situation. The first advantage they \nhad over the Pred was number and sheer size. Even in robot mode, \nAzureBlade was taller and larger than her. For now, he was in dragon \nmode, which made him slightly bigger. It would be easy to pin her \ndown. However, they were in a cave, and that restrained him for the \nsame reasons. He could not maneuver easily, unless he broke through \nthe Pred and went for the exit. For now though, he wanted to keep \nthings as cool as possible. He decided to stick with diplomacy.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., HanaKirei85@a... wrote:\n&gt; &lt;&lt;AzureBlade was overjoyed to hear her words. He wanted to yell his \n&gt; happiness, but he refrained and simply smiled. He smiled widely, but \n&gt; he only smiled.\n&gt; \n&gt; AzureBlade: I respect your choice and I appreciate it. It is ironic \n&gt; though! I had just told them I wanted to be left alone for some \ntimes, \n&gt; and I am about to come back with a new rookie! Do you think you&#39;ll \nbe \n&gt; able to fly though? It is a long way...&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I think I&#39;ll be able to manage.&quot; Mistra said, still smiling \nslightly. Her \n&gt; only prominent problem right now was her activation code...although \nshe \n&gt; should be able to manage it somehow. It shouldn&#39;t be too hard...\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;Kali::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kali arrived where Azure blade and Mistra were &quot;So, you arrived \n&gt; first&quot;said the femme while she trasformed to her pretty robot mode \n&quot;I \n&gt; guess that you&#39;re a maximal, aren&#39;t you???&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Mistra&#39;s eyes widened at the new arrival...and dragon bot? Only a \nfemale \n&gt; bot.. Her ears flew back, only hoping this bot would be as kind as \nAzure had \n&gt; been up till now. Even if it seemed doubtful...there was a war going \non right \n&gt; now. If this bot attacked, what would Mistra be able to do? She&#39;d \nhave to go \n&gt; offline for a brief period to change her activation code from \nwhatever it \n&gt; was...she knew that much. Hopefully there wouldn&#39;t be a battle...not \nnow.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;AzureBlade turned quickly to face...\n&gt; Another dragon bot. The ones he knew were either maximal or \nPredacon, \n&gt; and since the maximal ones were unheard of since the last battle...\n&gt; \n&gt; AzureBlade: What of it? What if I really am?\n&gt; \n&gt; He stood on his guards, but did not appear threatening... for \nnow...&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Relieved by the reminder that Azure was in fact still there, Mistra \nfelt a \n&gt; bit better about it...although she wouldn&#39;t sit to a side if a \nbattle did \n&gt; occur. She moved slowly, always facing Kali, until she was beside \nAzure. She \n&gt; felt safer there anyway...and her status pod didn&#39;t matter now.\n\n\n"}}
