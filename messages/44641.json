It could not\nbe left here though. Giant hands moved towards the little pod, and his\nfingers gently cupped the body, scooping the creature out of the pod. He\nthen quickly cradled it to his body, and stood up, begining to head\ntowards his transport vehicle. \n\nHoist just pulled up to the area, and transformed. &quot;I came as fast as I\ncould Pacifix.&quot; Hoist said. \n\nPacifix looked the Autobot over. &quot;Good, go with that robot.&quot; He said\npointing at Prowl with one hand, he other firmly grasping Eyebright.\n&quot;See what you can do to help.&quot;\n\nHoist nodded and headed straight for Prowl, as Pacifix stepped into his\ntransport area. At his command, a structure extended from the wall, a\nbed like thing. He gently placed Eyebright inside a life support cell.\nIt retracted into the wall. &quot;Good, you&#39;ll be safe here.&quot; he whispered,\nleaving the small transport vehicle.\n\n"}}
