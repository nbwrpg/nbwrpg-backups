Megatron was making him\n&gt; &gt; nervous. He made it clear to himself not to go near him today. He knew\n&gt; &gt; better than to get too close. Megatron had a loose fuse.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He hear the female scorpion say she wanted to go to the lake, now going \n&gt;to\n&gt; &gt; the mouth of the cave. That sparked danager in his mind. He ran to her \n&gt;and\n&gt; &gt; grabbed her arm. &quot;Wait!&quot; he said. &quot;Ah don&#39;t reckon that ain&#39;t the best\n&gt;idea.\n&gt; &gt; Remember what ah said?
