A few\n&gt; things to consider: (1) Since you&#39;re using a timed\n&gt; mine, you must wait till the timer runs out for the\n&gt; explosion. That would mean that Azureblade could\n&gt; probably deavtivate the CR chamber (if that&#39;s\n&gt; possible) and try to run (unless he&#39;s a demolition\n&gt; expert). Also if that&#39;s possible, then he can\n&gt; probably warn other maximals in the base. (2) The\n&gt; explosion won&#39;t necessarily destroy the whole base;\n&gt; note that you are using a mine. It&#39;ll most likely\n&gt; cripple the majority of the interior, or blow out a\n&gt; large hole in the side, depending on where the CR\n&gt; chambers are. (3) The internal scanners of the\n&gt; Maximal base would likely detect either the\n&gt; explosives themselves, or the electrical signal of\n&gt; the timer and therefore hint to the Maxi&#39;s that\n&gt; something is going on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since you know that this post is highly illegal, are\n&gt; you asking us to disallow it? Not that is\n&gt; necessarily is, it just that you rushed it too much,\n&gt; the timer must be taken into account.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just pause the thought while the council has a short\n&gt; discussion about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Council members, visit the nbwrpg site, and check\n&gt; the coucil message board.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Michael Coburn&quot;\n&gt; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Symphony/Hell Drak::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Symphony nodded, and said, &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll take care of\n&gt; him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Symphony looked in at AzureBlade.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry......&quot; Symphony said, as he deactivated\n&gt; the CR Chamber.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Symphony left the room.  He put a timed mine on\n&gt; the CR Chamber containing AzureBlade, set to\n&gt; detonate in 5 minutes.  Symphony left the room, and\n&gt; went to the control room.
