First off why do you think I used the word founder and not \n  the word=\r\n Council Member.  Because a founder had power before all the \n  founders qu=\r\nit and then the council took over because they wanted the \n  RPG to continu=\r\ne.\n\n     If you Read the about section at nbwrpg.com, then you will hear a =\r\n\n  mention about the founders.  The guys from Louisiana  (Hey Yan, you \n  m=\r\night want to fix Luisiana to Lousiana.)  were the founders.  The \n  founder=\r\ns were the ones that came up with the whole idea of Neo Beast \n  Wars RPG. =\r\n Does the name Biostinger familiar to you.  Well I am not \n  him, but I go =\r\nto the same school as him and I made NBWRPG with him.\n\n     I was the one t=\r\nhat called him one day and said hey (I don&#39;t think \n  he wants his name rev=\r\neled) Biostinger, you know how you wanted to \n  make an Beast Wars Rpg earl=\r\nier, well I have an Idea for the Story \n  line.  So I told him the story li=\r\nne.  He liked it and we figure that \n  our good friend should be a co-found=\r\ner.  We than had Biostinger \n  go into the Beastwars RPG AOL Chatroom(He wa=\r\ns the only one with AOL)  \n  I ended up making sites saying join NBWRPG.  A=\r\nnd well Firestorm 316 \n  gr81(The Co-founder) just sat around and watched.\n=\r\n\n     So, I am instrumental in the making of this RPG.\n\n     And also, Whem=\r\n I say founder, I mean when I made this RPG, and if \n  I say council, then =\r\nI am mentioning the Council.\n\n  NOTE:  The main reason Firestorm 316 Gr81 j=\r\nust sat around and watch \n  is because hid Dad was very very very very very=\r\n very very Strict.\n\n  NOTE:  If anyone wants to take this up with me than e=\r\nmail me at \n  proto@...(Temp address While Hotmail fix things up.)\n\n=\r\n\n  --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Roland the Gunslinger&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; OO=\r\nC: He is, and so are Jeff, Alloran, and Megan, although Megan&#39;s \n  never on=\r\n anymore.
