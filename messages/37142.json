The beam continues on at whoever had hit it, intent on shocking them.\n\nAs the ball flies toward the exit, it opens and Prowl enters, instantly flying back and hitting the corridor wall as the ball smashes him in the face. On the other end of the room, IR spins around with concern in her eyes, sighing with relief as Prowl gets up, rubbing his head and throwing the ball back into the ring, entering and getting a tennis racket.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm stops the ball with his racket, seeing two beams head for him and quickly passing it toward Ratchet, for whom the beams head next.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCledar stops suddenly, jumping to the left to get out of the way of a beam, another beam sending him to his knees.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nForrior and Blyer end up back to back as they dodge beams, diving out of the way as two beams come from the opposite sides of them. The beams hit each other, buzzing loudly and then combining into one.\n\n&quot;The beams combine when they hit each other!&quot; Forrior yells, diving out of the way of another one.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKeeping his eyes on the ball, Rixer doesn&#39;t see Cledar fall and trips over him, falling on his face.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIR shakes her head when she sees the dissarray. She activates her comm.\n\n&quot;Maximals, as Forrior said, the beams combine when they hit. Try to trick them into hitting each other.&quot;\n\nShe then turns back to the console, trying to contact Cyndro.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Ratchet/Sideswipe/Orion:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::As soon as the ball gets near him, he hits it with his racket, trying to \n&gt; get it to hit the target.
