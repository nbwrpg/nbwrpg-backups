A program surge went through her mind. She \nwhispered,&quot;We are on duty. We must obey Megatron first.&quot; She tried to smile \nbut couldn&#39;t.  She wanted to hug Scorponok, but her programming wouldn&#39;t \nallow it. While Megatron was near, she could only obey him. Megatron was \nfirst to be obeyed.  Quickstrike second and Scorponok third according to her \nnew programming.  She stayed cold and showed no emotion while Megatron was \nnear her.\nShe watched Megatron while he talked to Panzertron.\n\n\n---Original message---\nFrom:   &lt;crow_lord@h...&gt;\nDate: Mon Jul 3, 2000 6:27pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nScorponok stood next to Darkmouse. He had his arm around her waist.\nHe\nsaid to Darkmouse, &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
