He turns to lead the way \ninto the forest, stopping at another disgusted sound from Reptilica.\n\n&quot;This is too far!&quot; Reptilica snaps, walking toward Perndabot, &quot;We arn&#39;t going \nto escort her untill Zardus is notified and authorizes this!&quot;\n\nWith an angry look on his face, Perndabot spins around, a huge fist lashing \nout at Reptilica&#39;s face. Reptilica flies back, going unconscious as he is \ncought by Bloodystrike.\n\n&quot;Zardus would agree with me,&quot; Perndabot says calmly to the unconscious bot. \nHe looks at Bloodystrike and DevilDuer, &quot;Anyone else want to voice their \nopinions.&quot;\n\nDevilDuer and Bloodystrike looks from Reptilica&#39;s dented face plate to \nPerndabot&#39;s still ready fist, their eyes a bit frightened. They mutely shake \ntheir heads.\n\nPerndabot grunts. &quot;Good.&quot;\n\nHe reaches down, easily lifting the unconscious Reptilica to his shoulder. \nPerndabot turns to BrightBlade, &quot;Shall we go, then?&quot;\n\nHe sets off toward the Maximal base, suddenly turning around as a thought \noccurrs to him. &quot;Is this a stealth mission, or will it be fine for them to \nknow you&#39;re at their doorstep?&quot;\n\nHe looks at BrightBlade, waiting for an answer. If it was the second, \npossibly a negotiations attempt, he would have to act. A truce between the \nPredacons and the Maximals would not be good for the Alliance.\n\n"}}
