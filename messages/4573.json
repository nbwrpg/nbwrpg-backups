The damage he had sustained in his \njet mode was gone.  Going on his long range scanners, he picked up someone.  \nThough in what would later be called Seoul, South Korea, his scanners did \npick up something.  A small energy source.  It was a craft, he knew that.  \nJust analyzing the weak signature didn&#39;t tell him how large.  For all he knew \nit could be the size of a huge continet and just had worn down over the \nmillenia, or as big as his fist.  Transforming to space fighter mode \nwordlessly, he launched himself off into the air.  Heading for what would be \nknown as Australia, not knowing he would find Amobeous and Bacterium&#39;s ship.\n\n"}}
