Do you need assistance? You don&#39;t look to good.  Where is your\n&gt;base and I&#39;ll help you get back there.&quot;  She was concerned for this brave\n&gt;bot.  She looked at the other female.

The poision had run its \n&gt;course.\n&gt; &gt;That made things a lot easier. A well heated battle he wouldn&#39;t mind, but\n&gt; &gt;he\n&gt; &gt;needed to get back to base, and tell Megatron what he had. Also, he \n&gt;didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;have a lot of space to move around in. The trees would just get in his \n&gt;way.\n&gt; &gt;But either way, he won. He told Cheetor he could beat him. Sure, he \n&gt;busted\n&gt; &gt;his foot, but he won.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;He kicked the Maximal on the side, watched him just in case he moved. He\n&gt; &gt;then crouched and waved two the Predacon females over.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
