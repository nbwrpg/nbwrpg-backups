Revenge would be made. The pressure in his head \nturned him insane to a point. But still, he was smart enough to act \nright around the ones he trusted, even how small allies were.\n\nIn the open, Quickstrike opened his comm-link to Blackarachnia&#39;s. He \nlet the open trasmittion linger, just in case she wasn&#39;t alone. Then \nafter a minute, he said, &quot;Blackarachnia. Ah need t&#39; talk t&#39; ya. \nFollow mah signature; ah ain&#39;t too far, jus&#39; two klicks away. Come \nalone.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
