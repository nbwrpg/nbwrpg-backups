It was strong here, which meant that \nshe either stayed for a while or doubled back a few yards. But, her sent \nended at the stream edge and he knew that it would almost be imposable to \ntrack her from here...unless.\nDinobot looked up at one of the giant trees and then over at the other side \nof the stream, could she have jumped across?He looked at the shore of the \nstream and walked down it a little, he knew that she was a wolf and \nthus...had fur. He had a little trick to finding out if a furry creature \nwent down stream in the water, he knew that they shed, even if just a \nlittle.\nIf a furry creature went into the water then the loose fur would come off \nand collect on the shore in the direction un which they went. The fur would \nkeep collecting on the shore until that creature got out, THAT would betray \nthe location in which a hunter could start searching again!\nDinobot saw no fur as he looked but as he came back to the spot that \nTavatron&#39;s sent ended he did see a small brown hair. She&#39;d jumped!!\nDinobot looked up and across the stream with a loud snarl, he&#39;d heard her \nhowl only a few cycles ago but it still rang in his mechanisms.\nHe looked up at the trees again and steadied his stance*\n\n&quot; Dinobot, MAXIMIZE!!&quot;\n\n* Now transformed he stepped back, aimed his laser sight and fired at the \ntrunk of a near by tree. The tree snapped and toppled across the stream, \nDinobot wasted no time in crossing the log bridge.\nHe hopped off and looked out into the trees that now surrounded him, \nTavatron was out there somewhere and he was going to find her!*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
