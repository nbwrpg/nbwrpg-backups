But at \nleast she knew who.  She pulled the pelt back and looked at \nQuickstrike. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about what happened. I mean, I tried to \ndefend the ship. I guess I didn&#39;t do a good job huh?&quot;\nShe tried to sit up.  The pelt fell off to the side on the table.  \nHer thin legs hung down. She had tiger stripe scars on her legs.  She \nput her hands on the edge of the table to support herself. She looked \nthin and her body showed a few scars from the battle.  She had a long \nscar going up her side, from her hip up to her shoulder blade. She \nlooked up at Quickstrike. &quot;Well, I won&#39;t make that mistake again. \nI&#39;ll kill them first and ask questions later.&quot;  Her arms were shaking \nas she leaned on them. She smiled. It was good to have control over \nher body again.  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ah wasn&#39;t the one that did this,&quot; Quickstrike replied to Dark \n&gt; Mouse. &quot;It was Black Arachnia.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
