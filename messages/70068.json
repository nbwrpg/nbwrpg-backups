As Rodimus taunts him, =\r\nhe simply ignores him, not uttering one word about it for a moment or so, a=\r\nnd he also had Hydras breathing down his neck configuratively.  Still he ke=\r\neps calm throughout, and first directs his attention to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Failure?=\r\n  Hmm, Rodimus I don&#39;t know.  To you it may seem like failure, to me, yes, =\r\nit was a mistake but also a learning experience. Learn not to go too fast, =\r\nyet make decisions carefully.  So, yes, I configuratively got a flat tire a=\r\nlong the way.  But tires can be changed and after that, it&#39;s back on the ro=\r\nad like nothing happened.  Of course to you, it&#39;s like a perpetual road blo=\r\nck.  There, you have my answer.  Nothing more.&quot;\n\nHe quietly follows orders =\r\nby discarding his weaponry.  Having left his cross bow behind, he merely gi=\r\nves up an old sword and spear, as his weapons. He somehow felt that if he c=\r\name with the bare minimal he wouldn&#39;t lose much.\n\nNight Shift also discards=\r\n his riffle without revolt. Yet he looks at Scorponok after hearing what Tu=\r\ncson Prime said and how he was viewing the situation.\n\n&quot; Okay, yeah, things=\r\n went South.  Big deal, happens all the time.&quot;\n\nTucson then looks to Cyclon=\r\nus, yes, he had looked as he had before he had lost his sight.  It didn&#39;t s=\r\nurprise him though.  He had see and been through worse.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sorry Cyclon=\r\nus, there are no secrets to share with you.  I have not the answers for the=\r\n power that has been given to me, because I myself don&#39;t know them.&quot;\n\nHe la=\r\nstly turns to Hydras.  \n\n&quot; Rat Trap and Quickstride pose no threat to you H=\r\nydras.  They have not entered your base, and done nothing to get you angry.=\r\n  So to that question, I have to say... LEAVE THEM OUT OF THIS.  I am the o=\r\nne who made the mistake, and it&#39;s me you want, not them.  So, I&#39;m here aren=\r\n&#39;t I?  You have me and now you have nothing to fear from the outside world,=\r\n because your main threat is now in your possession.  Think about it, what =\r\ncan they do?  They&#39;re no threat to you at all.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds in agree=\r\nment to his commander&#39;s statement. Tucson looks to all his comrades before =\r\nhaving to be separated from them.\n\n&quot;Kup, I did not intend to put your spark=\r\n in danger, and for that I am deeply sorry.  Stay strong my friend, this is=\r\nn&#39;t forever.  And whatever happens, happens.  My heart goes out to Elita an=\r\nd one day, hopefully, she will never have to worry about anything ever agai=\r\nn.&quot;\n\nHe puts a hand on Night Shift&#39;s shoulder.\n\n&quot; Night Shift, we&#39;re going =\r\nto be separated from each other.  Again, this wouldn&#39;t be happening if I ha=\r\ndn&#39;t ran that red light.  I promise you I will make it up to you but not su=\r\nre as of how I will do it just yet.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;Heey, it&#39;s cool,=\r\n it&#39;s cool, we all mess up sometimes, like ya said. No worries boss bot, we=\r\n&#39;ll get through this, like we always do. I&#39;ll be okay, I promise.&quot;  \n\nThey =\r\nshake hands as they wait to be separated from each other.\n\nOutside the fort=\r\nress, Rat Trap senses something is a miss when it takes far too long for an=\r\nyone to come out.  Quickstride looks down to him.\n\n&quot; Quickstride, it&#39;s been=\r\n a really long time and no word from Wheels or the others.  Somethn&#39;s wrong=\r\n.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds.\n\n&quot;Yeah, something really stinks around here doesn&#39;t =\r\nit, and it&#39;s not me this time, because I haven&#39;t had any bean pods lately.&quot;=\r\n\n\nRat Trap swallows hard.\n\n&quot; He told us ta wait out here.   But he also tol=\r\nd us that if he didn&#39;t come out right away, ta call for backup.   Lord Elde=\r\nr, it&#39;s me, Rat Trap.  Wheels hasn&#39;t come out with the other guys yet, and =\r\nit&#39;s been a very long time.  Something&#39;s wrong.  I think we need backup sir=\r\n.&quot;\n\nHis voice falters a bit, as he wipes off a tear with his rodent paw.\n\n&quot;=\r\nAww Wheels, why&#39;dya have ta go&#39;n do that for?  You&#39;re the only real friend =\r\nI&#39;ll ever have.&quot;\n\nQuickstride could see what was happening. He puts his nos=\r\ne down to his rodent comrade.\n\n&quot; Hey, he&#39;ll be okay, he probably ran inta a=\r\n snag.  He&#39;ll be fine, he&#39;s pretty buff now Rat Trap.  Don&#39;t worry, I bet h=\r\ne&#39;s got somethn&#39; up his manifold.  It&#39;s just gonna take a while, that&#39;s all=\r\n.&quot;\n\nRat Trap composes himself and scrambles up onto Quickstride&#39;s back.\n\n&quot;W=\r\ne better find someplace ta hide.&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks around and finds a bit=\r\n of thick greenery near the black fortress.  He trots toward it, vanishing =\r\ninto the vegitation.\n\n&quot;This should be okay for now.  Well, until Hydras sen=\r\nds his goons out ta find us which is probably what&#39;ll happen.... Ooohh, bea=\r\nn pods...&quot;\n\nAgain he thinks of nothing but food and begins to munch on the =\r\nbean pods.  Rat Trap looks onto the fortress hoping that Tucson Prime had a=\r\n plan in place to get everyone out of there in one piece.\n--- In nbwrpg@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup/Perceprtor/Darkhawk/Nightlight=\r\n/hydras\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup looked with sandess At Rodimus and nightlight, he had fail=\r\ned... miserly \n&gt; failed to his friend and Elita.

Don&#39;t =\r\nyou know that you can&#39;t win?!?&quot; Rodimus paused and\n&gt; &gt; then chuickled again=\r\n, although this time it was a little weaker and\n&gt; &gt; less sure, &quot;yeah, you c=\r\nan&#39;t win, so why even try.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus shook his head and smiled as he=\r\n helped collect any weapons\n&gt; &gt; that are discarded.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scourge, much l=\r\nike Rodimus began helping with any weapons that are\n&gt; &gt; given over, and nud=\r\nging the prisoners in the right directions. &quot;So\n&gt; &gt; disappointing.&quot; Scourge=\r\n said as he shook his head sadly at the\n&gt; &gt; Autobots and Maximals, &quot;I looke=\r\nd forward to the battle. maybe next\n&gt; &gt; time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scorponok just stood=\r\n grinning, or atleast as close to grinning as his\n&gt; &gt; face plate would allo=\r\nw. He looked at Nightshift, &quot;Is this what you\n&gt; &gt; meant by get it?&quot; he said=\r\n, the sarcasm thick in his voice. &quot;I think we\n&gt; &gt; got it then, yes we did.&quot;=\r\n he chuckled at his own joke.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As all this was going on the doors sl=\r\nid open and Cyclonus stood there,\n&gt; &gt; weapon drawns and optics darting arou=\r\nnd the room. The cyclonus that\n&gt; &gt; stood there, while familiar to most, was=\r\n very different from the last\n&gt; &gt; time Tuscon had seen him before he lost h=\r\nis sight. This Cyclonus was a\n&gt; &gt; little taller and sleeker, even in his ro=\r\nbot mode his lined and form\n&gt; &gt; bespoke speed and aerodynamics. He seemd la=\r\nrger and more imposing than\n&gt; &gt; when he last stood before him, his armor th=\r\nicker and more resilliant\n&gt; &gt; than when he was a simple lacky for Galvatron=\r\n. It is as if he had\n&gt; &gt; grown into something more than what he was, even h=\r\nis spark no longer\n&gt; &gt; registered as pure Decepticon, there was that aspect=\r\n that was always\n&gt; &gt; Unicronian, however on his chest was emblazed the purp=\r\nle symbol of the\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon forces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Upon seeing the turn of eve=\r\nnts Cyclonus nodded satisfactorilly as he\n&gt; &gt; turned to Hydras, &quot;What ever =\r\nwave that was from Tuscon awakened\n&gt; &gt; Jhiaxus from stassis. He has the sec=\r\nurity section secured.&quot; He turned\n&gt; &gt; his gaze on Tuscon, &quot;We will have to =\r\nhave it analyzed to see what ever\n&gt; &gt; defence to it can be mounted. It seem=\r\ned to have a more pronounced\n&gt; &gt; affect on your Decepticon and predacon for=\r\nces.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: The changes I described are for Tuscon&#39;s b=\r\nenefit as well as those\n&gt; &gt; who have not seen him a long while. Hydras is a=\r\nlready aware of this,\n&gt; &gt; as are the rest of the preds. These are the chang=\r\nes from Unicron\n&gt; &gt; rebuilding him as well as the changes that he had under=\r\ngone from the\n&gt; &gt; matrix enhancement. For any of the Predacons he should lo=\r\nok the same,\n&gt; &gt; and there should be no surprises, only the Maximals and Au=\r\ntobots who\n&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t seen him in a while, especaily tuscon who hasn&#39;t see=\r\nn him in a\n&gt; &gt; very long while should there be the change. - I hope that ma=\r\nkes sense.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, Apr 14, 2010 at 1:37 AM, &lt;ai=\r\nrly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hydras/nighlight/Perceptor/Kup/\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hydras:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Hydras laughted, it was a deep evil laughth =\r\nand looking to around him \n&gt; &gt;&gt; said &quot;Throw away Your weapons...
