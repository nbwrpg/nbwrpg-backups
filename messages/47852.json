He arrives in the CR room, where\n&gt; he sees Talos. &quot;Autobot, Kup, reporting. What happaned?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; {Talos}\n&gt; &gt; CR Chamber Room, Deck 2\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Talos looked at the gathered bots here nodding as they claimed\n&gt; beast modes for themselves, opening his comm he held up his hand to\n&gt; gently dismiss kups questions for now...he sighed internally these\n&gt; autobot refits were eccentric to say the least. &quot;Kenzo good to hear\n&gt; you&#39;re still operational, come to the CR chambers and get yourself a\n&gt; beast form, energon reports outside are rather extreme.&quot; Turning off\n&gt; the comm he focused his attention on Condor next.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Condor give Sunhawk a hand with finding a spot for the signal\n&gt; enhancer tower.&quot; Nodding to the bot he turned back to Kup, &quot;We&#39;ve\n&gt; crashed here on Earth or at least I think it&#39;s Earth, by all accounts\n&gt; of the original beast war the ancient earth was a rather energon\n&gt; filled environment, you may want to get conditioned for the\n&gt; environment with your alternate form. As is repairs are under way,\n&gt; sensor range is limited for the moment and communications outside the\n&gt; ship are being looked into.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Grinning he nodded, &quot;We&#39;ve got a foothold here to complete our\n&gt; mission, as for now I&#39;d like to see about getting the mess hall\n&gt; cleaned up and getting some of our people resting. We don&#39;t know the\n&gt; terrain, we don&#39;t know how many preds there are or if they&#39;re headed\n&gt; our way. I want every bot in good shape for when we find them or they\n&gt; find us. Megatron is going back to cybertron, this time for good.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Nodding again saying his piece he walked out of the CR chamber\n&gt; room and headed for the mess hall to assess the damage, from the look\n&gt; of Kup it must&#39;ve been pretty shook up.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
