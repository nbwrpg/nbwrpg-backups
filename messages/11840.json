He fell to a knee, \nfiring off another rocket at a cannon that was moving to open fire on \nthe Oblitercons.\n\n---\n\nDark One activated his targeting sytems.  Gettinga lock, he fired off \ntwo missiles at an autocannon, laughing as the meager defenses opened \nfire on him, digging into his light armor.\n\n---\n\nA compartment in the front of Pyro slipped open, as did another one \nonly a few feet next to it.  He fired off two missiles, one at a \ndifferent cannon.\n\n---\n\nScavenger opened fire, twenty-five shells steaking out at Rodimus \nPrime.\n\n======\n\n&quot;Emperor Nemesis Enforcer, the troops are assembled.
