Don=\r\n&#39;t take it the wrong way Rodimus, Tucson&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; always\n&gt; &gt; had a nasty temp=\r\ner, even when he was just an average Autobot. I can \n&gt; &gt; remember\n&gt; &gt; a lot=\r\nta bar room fights and all those times where he&#39;d smash a con&#39;s face \n&gt; &gt; t=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; unrecognizable smitherines.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson also adds in his part.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;She&#39;s right, I never lost my temper around Autobots, only Decepticon=\r\ns. \n&gt; &gt; But\n&gt; &gt; I would get agitated with certain Autobots from time to tim=\r\ne..

Gr=\r\neat\n&gt; &gt; medic, Brilliant individual, but he also had a nasty temper. That k=\r\ninda\n&gt; &gt; rubbed off on you big guy.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson sighs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Before=\r\n I became a warrior, I do remember helping Ratchet periodically \n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Supply runs. I&#39;d get what he needed and deliver the goods safely back to=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Iacon med bay.  Then, I&#39;d actually watch him repair damaged A=\r\nutobots. \n&gt; &gt; When\n&gt; &gt; I wasn&#39;t fighting, I was using my spare time to rest=\r\nore old weaponry and\n&gt; &gt; artifacts.  I got to learn a lot about simple repa=\r\nir work, simply by\n&gt; &gt; watching Ratchet, and taking his good advice.

I guess his temper\n&gt; &gt; stems from the need to see a=\r\n job well done all the way through.  Hydras is\n&gt; &gt; disrupting that sense of=\r\n stability, and that&#39;s what&#39;s really making Tucson\n&gt; &gt; angry.  If given the=\r\n opportunity, would you allow him to face Hydras once\n&gt; &gt; again, to try and=\r\n even the score?

Maybe that would kinda help ya heal a little bit.  The wou=\r\nnds \n&gt; &gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still fresh, even though that fight was a long time ag=\r\no.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; You&#39;re right.  Rodimus, Legacy,=\r\n I&#39;ve been keeping something from you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; long time, a=\r\nnd that&#39;s not what a respectable leader does.  A leader may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n strong but he too, must open up about the issues that weaken his state \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind.  It all started on the day of that battle, that had Rodi=\r\nmus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; abducted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and taken over by Hydras and his forces.  I fough=\r\nt in that battle as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; soldier. And being a Ninjabot myself, I knew of=\r\n Nightrazor&#39;s properties,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I felt that if I barged in on Rod=\r\nimus, it would only land me with a case\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; insubordination.  So=\r\n, I refrained from doing so, but tried to divert \n&gt; &gt; &gt; enemy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attenti=\r\nons indirectly.  For the most part it worked and I was able to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fight\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my way through those who knew nothing about Ninjabot combat.  Yet, th=\r\nere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were seekers who were far more swift on their wings then I was on=\r\n my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wheels.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They were bearing down on the Autobots, to the poin=\r\nt that I felt that if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; did not step in, there wouldn&#39;t be an =\r\nAutobot left to defend the Ark or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; planet.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He p=\r\nauses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; From what I remember, I transformed into my vehicle mo=\r\nde, and started \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kick up dirt from my tires, in hopes that a=\r\n seeker would see what I was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to.  It worked, and I grabbed =\r\nthe attention of several, although I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see who they were=\r\n because they were rather high up from me.  Then,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suddenly,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I w=\r\nas struck.  And I don&#39;t remember anything more than that.  A long \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ti=\r\nme\n&gt; &gt; &gt; afterwards, I was brought back online, and when I woke up, I could=\r\n only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; darkness.  At first, I thought it was a power outage,=\r\n but then, I was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; told\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that my optic sensors were completely de=\r\nstroyed by the cranial shot that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had endured during that cha=\r\nse.  I asked about you Rodimus, but, no one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tell me what =\r\nhappened.  It was at that point where I knew that I failed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIf only I had listened to myself the first time, and came in front of \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when you were chasing Nightrazor that first time.  You would no=\r\nt have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suffered as you had, nor would your family. And since then, I =\r\npledged to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back on my feet, and never let my defenses down =\r\nagain, and if I had to,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; &gt; strike back harder than any Decepti=\r\ncon or Predacon could ever fathom.  I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; failed you once Rodimus, and I =\r\npledged NEVER to let that happen again.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to=\r\n Tucson with a thoughtful gaze.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Wow, you never even told me al=\r\nl that before.  Well, since we&#39;re opening\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about it, I wish I=\r\n could help you guys understand what happened, but I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remem=\r\nber a little bit more than he does. Right before he got shot, I saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; C=\r\nyclonus decending just a tad closser to us than the other seekers that\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; following us.  I saw him take the shot and I screamed, and tha=\r\nt&#39;s when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything went blank.  I think what would really help Tucso=\r\nn now, is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowing that what happened, really wasn&#39;t his fault.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson now turns his head toward Megatron&#39;s body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Havi=\r\nng the Decepticons here amongst us is highly un nerving to me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; must be a way to separate them from the Autobots, and place them in a=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; safe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; location...  Wait, I remember something..  The Deceptico=\r\nns had their own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; craft, The Nemisis...  Why couldn&#39;t we return them t=\r\no their rightful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; craft\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and separate them from the Autobots, wh=\r\nere both factions would be safe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; harm?  Rodimus, due to cir=\r\ncumbstances which I have just told you, for my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emotional st=\r\nability, I can not have these Decepticons here.  But I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; willing\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; to help preserve them in a safe location away from the Ark.  Legacy, if\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could, I&#39;d like you to find out where the Nemisis is now loc=\r\nated and if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is within reach.  Once located, I want the Dece=\r\npticons brought safely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to their own ship, where they can =\r\nrest in peace, thus leaving the Ark to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Autobots to do the s=\r\name.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Straight Shot smiles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Now that&#39;s more like t=\r\nhe Tucson I know.  I like that idea, I like it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alot.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Out=\r\nside the Ark, Uproar and Quickstride look to each other and just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shr=\r\nug\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off the event.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hmm, oh well, would&#39;ve been fun ta see=\r\n them end up in the tar pit but,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; works for me, Uproar.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; U=\r\nproar nodds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ditto.

Yet, U=\r\nproar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not help but look back with a perplexed look on hi=\r\ns face.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyc=\r\nlonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras did=\r\n a final shot and send a secret message to Nightrazor &quot;The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; door\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; is open, time to leave&quot;and said in loud voice &quot;PREDACONS... \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n RETREAT!!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras picked up inferno and started to leave the a=\r\nrea\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Tuscon&#39;s] eyes narrow dangerously.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;THAT&#39;S IT!

Perhaps they were not as . . . hurt as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looked.

Several more of the sweeps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blasted from the skies, t=\r\nhe last one swinging up next to his master\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scourge,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; almost =\r\nas if for protection.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Predacons were looking decidedly =\r\nmore damaged and a bit more tired\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before. Energon look=\r\ned to be looking a bit lower than before and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from=\r\n Windlord and Kup were building up on them, not to mention the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire=\r\npower\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coming from the fuzors as well as Leo II! Yes, the Predacons =\r\nhad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breached\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the door, but getting further in would be an u=\r\nphill battle indeed, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of them did not look to be in=\r\n the best shape to fight it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Me=\r\nanwhile, Outside, Quickstride quickly gets Uproar to his feet, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nassesses the situation. He then looks around the parameters and then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; remembers a body of goop, that resembled a tar pit, not far from the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Ark&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parameters.
