Remember that Perceptor, remember that.&quot;\n\nHis voice gets colder and an=\r\n air of annoyance rolls over him.  His optics narrow and it would appear th=\r\nat his patience with Perceptor was running thin.  Yet he was guiding them o=\r\nut so he had to keep his cool, no matter how hard it was for him.\n\n&quot; So if =\r\nanyone should be highly upset about everyhing, it really should be Lord Eld=\r\ner, Rodimus Prime and myself.

That&#39;s one lesson Hydras ain&#39;t learned yet.  Hmmm, he must r=\r\neally have a brain the size of a turbo rat&#39;s head!&quot;\n\nTucson listens to Nigh=\r\nt Shift.\n\n&quot; Shh...  Easy..
