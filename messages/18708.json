I guess examples of basic unclassified info would be scan \nresults, \n&gt; damage reports, stuff like that.\n\n\nLady Hawk dug through the files and found geological scans. fairly \nold but there shouldn&#39;t be much of a change from when they were \ntaken. She studied the scans trying to find where each of the \nalliance members had landed. Those scans would give her a good idea \nwhere certain animals would be dominant. &quot;This planet is going \nthrough changes that Avaria (Her home planet) could never survive.&quot; \nShe wondered if it was the translife that caused the changes or the \nnatural balance of the planet.\n\nShe eventually came across a CR report chart. She was headed in the \nright direction. If she had the readouts from the chambers dna \nstabilizers she wouldn&#39;t need direct contact with the Alliance \nmembers. All she&#39;d have to do was have the chamber create a sample \nfor her. \n\nIf the chamber could patch the robotics in translife it would also \nhave to be able to create compatible genetic material to patch the \nbiological side too. If this is a mode let me know and I&#39;ll repost. \n\n\n"}}
