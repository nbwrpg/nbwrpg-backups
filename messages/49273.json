What he did not anticipate was the blast \ncharge coming at his backthrusters. He was propelled a few meters \nfarther, which made him lose his lock.\n\nWarhead: I will kill all of you pretentious and arrogant Tripredacus! \nMilord Megatron shall never be taken by the likes of you!\n\nHe fired his machine guns randomly.\n\nBurrock, burned by the flames, lost hold of the Ant. He steadied his \naim and shot several spikes at his enemy, all acid-coated.\n\nBurrock: Whaddaya say now, Antie? Scums like you are not even worthy \nof the Tripredacus Strikers!\n\n\n"}}
