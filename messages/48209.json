I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sure, but I suspect the other&#39;s were as well.  I\n&gt; request \n&gt; permission\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to lock up the prisoner and take some troops to\n&gt; get the other&#39;s \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; {Talos}\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Talos nodded looking down at Sunhawks captive,\n&gt; apparently \n&gt; caught in the\n&gt; &gt; throes of stasis lock more so than battle damage.\n&gt; &quot;Take her to the \n&gt; brig then\n&gt; &gt; round up Grimlock, Kup and Condor to help you.&quot;\n&gt; Turning from the \n&gt; bot he\n&gt; &gt; opened a comm channel, &quot;Kenzo, report to the brig,\n&gt; Sunhawk is \n&gt; delivering a\n&gt; &gt; prisoner down there and I&#39;d like you to make sure\n&gt; she&#39;s all right, \n&gt; I want\n&gt; &gt; her functional for when I question her.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kenzo went to the brig &quot;I hope she isn&#39;t a giant\n&gt; lizard or anything&quot; \n&gt; he said to himself, he had never been instructed to\n&gt; try and heal a \n&gt; Predacon before but he was sure that it wouldn&#39;t be\n&gt; much different \n&gt; then healing a Maximal or Autobot. He continued to\n&gt; wait for Sunhawk.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
