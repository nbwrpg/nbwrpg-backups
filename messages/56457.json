Their scientists had \nrecently started experimenting on harnasing the power of a small \nblack-hole.\n\nAs with most things, not fully understanding what you are doing can \noften prove fatal. The Scientsts, proved this when one of the black-\nholes they were working on began to rupture it&#39;s containment field. \nA code red alert was initialized, and evac began immediately. It was \nsoon realized, however, that there would be no escape from this \nphenomenon by simply trying to leave the area. So, in an attempt to \nsave all of their lives, the head scientist initiated another \nproject that had also been worked on at the time: the time-warp rift \ndevice. At the moment, they could only figure out how to open it up, \nnot how to pinpoint target locations. Things that went in were never \nreturned, and the time readings that were sent back were all \ndifferent from the space station time. Due to these problems, \nresearch on the time-warp rift tech was not high proirity.\n\nThe head scientists enabled the device, and opened up the time-warp \nrift in the space station. The black-hole, the escape pods, and the \nstation itself were all sucked in. Although they hadn&#39;t discovered \nthis yet, objects which enter a time-warp rift without some sort \nmethod of normalizing the time fluctuations, would end up spat out \nat random times and in random locations. Following this principle, \nall of the pods, the station, and the black-hole were then spit out \nat various times and places.\n\nOne pod found it&#39;s way to a planet, which (though the bot inside the \npod didn&#39;t know it) happened to be inhabited. His onboard computer \nlisted the planet as unknown, with similarities to an ancient planet \nwhich destroyed itself, Terra, or more commonly known as Earth to \nit&#39;s weak but self-destructive beings which inhabited it originally.\n\nHis pod splashed into the upper atmosphere and streaked across the \nsky leaving a tell tale - not that he knew this - sign of a new pod \nentering the the brewing conflict between various forces of \ntransformers which had already found themselves stuck on this \narchaic planet.\n\n\n"}}
