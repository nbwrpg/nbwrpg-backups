Megan \ngot to it before I did.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ** Dinobot growled as Tavatron approached him and the small ball of \nfur on \n&gt; his nose, knowing that she was trying to help him but not quite \nwanting \n&gt; anyone near him at the moment. Glaring at the fembot as he stood \nthere and \n&gt; watched her hand come closer and closer to the black ball of lint.\n&gt; For some unexplainable reason Tavatron&#39;s sudden apology heightened \nhis \n&gt; aggression and his eyes turned into slits. This was pathetic! Since \nwhen had \n&gt; he needed the help of others in a foolish situation such as this? \nIt \n&gt; was...absurd! A grown man such as himself with a history of \nbloodshed, \n&gt; seeming helpless just because a black ball from Hell landed on his \nsnout! \n&gt; What foolishness!     However, Dinobot remained where he was as \nTavatron \n&gt; leaned close and the small creature decided to use her nose as a \ntarget, the \n&gt; female jumping back and whimpering quietly in alarm.\n&gt; Dinobot only snarled and rolled his eyes, getting sick of the \nlittle game, \n&gt; which this creature was deciding to play with the both of them. \nThinking and \n&gt; wondering if it had any clue that it would be nothing but stray \nwhips of \n&gt; fuzz on the wind if he ever got his transmetal claws on it. It was \nalready \n&gt; stamped DEAD as far as he was concerned.    Dinobot jerked his head \ntowards \n&gt; Tavatron as she tore her staff from sub-space, wondering if she was \ngoing to \n&gt; take some sort of revenge upon the ball-o-fuzz resting comfortably \nupon his \n&gt; most highly reflective snout. However, was not eager to see if his \nthoughts \n&gt; were false...or her aim. There was one fact, which Tavatron would \nhave to \n&gt; catch up upon before she so much of moved a metallic muscle, and \nthat was \n&gt; that if she hit him instead of the cat she would have a pair of \ntransmetal \n&gt; fangs to try and pry off of her throat. She was indeed his friend, \nyes...but \n&gt; no bot hit him and got away with it.\n&gt; Dinobot snarled in response to her telling of him to remain still, \nshaking \n&gt; his head to try and rid himself of the creature before moving it \ndown and \n&gt; reaching towards it with his own claws. If it tried to swat him, he \nwould \n&gt; simply squish it, then peel it off of his snout. Which suited him \njust as \n&gt; well.**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
