He was feeling the effects even in\n&gt;&gt; vehicle mode. Once transformed he could feel that it would be extremely\n&gt;&gt; difficult to transform back into robot mode. He decided that going back to\n&gt;&gt; robot mode would be better, because there was a great chance that Lamia&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; venom had effected his transformation card.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; With an even greater effort, he slowly gets back into robot mode,\n&gt;&gt; barely able to make the last phase of the transformation.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Slag.
