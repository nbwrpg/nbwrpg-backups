In the distance the sun was just\n beginning to show its face over the horizon, its harsh light bringing\n out that strange redness that gave this place its name: the searing\n eye. Moving in the fading darkness, sweeps patrolled the area, looking\n like so many flies on a dead landscape. Cyclonus� powerful frame stood\n resolute and still, his typically foreboding and grim form seemed to\n exude a strange sense of inner peace as the powerful Unicron Herald\n gazed at the vista before him. \n \n Like some dark raptor Scourge landed next to his commander, for the\n moment breaking the peace and serenity around them. �It is done.�\n Scourge�s voice breaks into Cyclonus� contemplation. �They have\n returned, and it is much as we thought. A few of the cybertronians are\n looking skyward, but for the most part they are squabbling amongst\n themselves.� Scourge held out a data chip to Cyclonus. �As you can see,\n with our forces they will be an easy victory for us.� \n \n Cyclonus nodded as faced Scourge and took the chip, glancing at the\n information on it.  �Then it is time.� He placed the chip into\n subspace. �Then by Unicron�s command the earth must be made ready for\n assimilation and any bearer of the matrix must be destroyed.  Nothing\n can be allowed to stand in our way!�\n \n Scourge nodded, an eager smile spread across his face. �And nothing\n will.

Then he turned\n back to Scourge. �We go to Atlantis.�\n \n Scourge nodded as the duo changed forms, both assuming deadly aerial\n modes. Cyclonus� voice echoed through Minion communication channels.\n �To the air! Minions! Unicronians! The time is NIGH!� \n \n Cyclonus, Scourge and the sweeps burst into the air, boosters lighting\n up the skies like a second sun, one that quickly fades into the\n distance as the approach their goal.\n \n Next post Earth!\n \n ----------------------------------------------------------\n \n OOC: Any Minion who wants to join, jump on board, just post your way\n in.
