He came closer, stopped, saluted, and stood tall.\n&gt;     &quot;Royalty! I have come to inform you that Rampage awaits your arrival.\nThe\n&gt; ship is up and running and armed.&quot; He said, not stumbling over words and\n&gt; being very tact.\n&gt;     Aracnia shighed. &quot; Excellent, we are beginning the moving process now.\n&gt; Unfortuetly, Kitkats groups has declined my offer. I guess the bunker will\n&gt; have to remain empty.&quot; She said looking around.\n&gt;     Inferno then looked around. THe bunker was big, but the ship was much\n&gt; better. &quot;Shall I do anything for you, my Queen?&quot;\n&gt;     Aracnia thought a moment. &quot;Yes, take the three Maximal prisoners to\nthe\n&gt; ship with you. Aerostreak, Paralysis, and when Tarantulas gets back, will\n&gt; help move the important equitment on a transport.&quot;\n&gt;     Inferno nodded and went to the brig to fetch the three Maximal\nprisoners.\n&gt; In the meantime, Aracnia called Quickstrike and Darkmouse.\n&gt;     &quot;Quickstrike, Darkmouse, report to the command room now. I want you\ntwo\n&gt; to go to the ship while were moving. Got it?&quot;\n&gt;     She turned to Paralysis, &quot;Get Venomus and Solo, Atma, and Pursudeo on\nthe\n&gt; Comm too, I want them here!&quot;\n&gt;     Paralysis nodded and did as he was told.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
