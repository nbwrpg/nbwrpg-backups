As \nshe \n&gt;   enters the CR room, she spots Burning Hammer on the ground \n&gt;   unconcious, &quot;Burning Hammer? Uhh, hello?&quot; She puts Trinity into \n&gt;   an empty (obviously =P) CR chamber, and starts the process \n&gt;   knowing that the small bot will be done soon. Then she turns to \n&gt;   BH, &quot;Hmmm, you don&#39;t look so good...&quot; She kneels beside him, \n&gt;   and examines him, looking for a reason for his unconcious state.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Meanwhile, outside the Chivitron base, Lokk is still hiding \nbehind \n&gt;   the hill. He spots Windlord fighting close combat with Vampiza, \n&gt;   and grumbles, not wanting to shoot and damage his fellow \n&gt;   Chivitron. He picks out Apewing, and his twin chainguns unload \n&gt;   half a clip each, hoping to surprise the bot.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Axis peeks his head over the pod, and spots Speed Viper. He fires \n&gt;   a laser blast, then arcs a missile at the bot. Then he crouches \n&gt;   back behind the pod.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   On 22 Jul 2001, at 18:02, Roland the Last Gunslinger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; OOC: Mmmmmm YOU KNOW WHAT? ME TOO! WCW AND ECW!
