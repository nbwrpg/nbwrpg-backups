She stands 5 foot tall in bot\n&gt; &gt;form and has a black panther maximal form.  She&#39;s a scout and a recon\n&gt; &gt;soldier. Currently, she&#39;s just landed and I can&#39;t think of where to\n&gt; &gt;place her since I heard that the planet was reformated and I  have no\n&gt; &gt;clue as to where the continents are or any of the bases.  So, I will\n&gt; &gt;need some help as far as getting her to a maximal base at this point.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Panzer fell down somewhere in a mountain range in Europe somewhere. I\n&gt; &gt;know it&#39;s vague, but it&#39;s the best I can do untill I get the rest\n&gt; &gt;figured out.  BTW, I&#39;ll just stick with two chars for a while. I\n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t think I can handle much more than that right now.
