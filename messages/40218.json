Well its a hologram but \nI cant reveal who it is yet.\n\nBIC:\n\nAnd upon those words the room went dark again and then features \nreappeared, this time it looked like the room Blacknightmare was in \nfirst with the same pedestal that the orb came up off of. Slowly \nthree other orbs flew all around Blacknightmare and scanned every bit \nof info about her and everything that has been done before they \ndissapeared into the pedestal. Slowly three chambers in the floor \nopened and then three holograms appeared over them, disturbingly \nlifelike. The first Hellpeon, the second Orchestra, the third showing \na much larger robot. The Hellpeon hologram walks up to Blacknightmare \nand stares down at her as it laughs evily.\n\nHellpeon: &quot;Predacon trash, what makes you think your so smart? You \nwill be destroyed by the Bamphomet and then devoured. I should not \neven waste my time with you.&quot;\n\nHolo-Hellpeon walks on back over to where he appeared and stands \nthere. Next, the Orchestra Hologram walked over to Blacknightmare and \nplaced a hand on her face.\n\nHolo-Orchestra: &quot;Come my love, The Alliance has been destroyed \ncompletely let us go and salvage all their technology and use it to \ndefeat our enemies. Then we can live together in peace..&quot;\n\nThe Orchestra Hologram then stepped away back to his place. Finally \nthe third unknown Hologram steps up to Blacknightmare.\n\n????: &quot;Come with me child and together we shall take over the \nUniverse! All shall fall before my will for I am the god of all \nInfecticons. IF you defy me then death shall be your fate.&quot;\n\nThe third being then walks back over to where it appeared over and \nMisfire floated over to Blacknightmare.\n\nMisfire: &quot;You must choose one of those three selections and then \ndescend into the chamber beneath the one you choose. Once you have \nselected your choice you will go to the next level. Where you go and \nwhat happens to you depends on your choice.&quot;\n\nWith that said Misfire descneds into the pedestal over the ground and \nthen dissapears with it as it descends.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Blacknightmare:\n&gt; \n&gt; The femme said &quot;The Bamphomet&quot;\n\n\n"}}
