Checking his memory, he realized something.  &quot;A...beast\n&gt; mode...hmmm.&quot; accessing a file, he gasped.  &quot;A microscopic organism!  A\n&gt; slaggin&#39; amobea?!  Someone does not like me!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hearing Bacterium he sighs.\n&gt; &quot;People will undoubtedly come to get us, and we don&#39;t want any attention.\n&gt; So, transform to your...bacteria mode...and I&#39;ll transform as well.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Transforming, it took several moments until all the excess material was\nput\n&gt; into subspace.  His membrane moved around like jelitin, having no real\nshape.\n&gt;  Flying off, he activated internal boosters, invisible flames sending him\n&gt; through the air, added by wind, sending him &#39;speeding&#39; off towards an\nunknown\n&gt; location (unknown to him, but towards the Ark).\n&gt;\n&gt; ===================\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramhorn stopped, 50 feet from the Ark.  &quot;Ramhorn...maximize.&quot; he\nwhispered.\n&gt; Transforming to his robot mode, he pulled out his sub-machine gun and\nmissile\n&gt; launcher, one in each hand.  &quot;Iron Raptor, look out!  That robot murdered\n&gt; Stinkbomb!&quot; he yelled, referring to Plintissa, raising both of his\nweapons.\n&gt; Holding the trigger down on his sub-machine gun, he let loose 25 sonic\nshells\n&gt; at Dracona&#39;s back, firing off a rocket at Plintissa&#39;s back.\n&gt;\n&gt; ===================\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot stepped out of his CR chamber, stretching.  &quot;Double crossing\n&gt; finks...I wanted to shoot them in the back.&quot; he said, walking off towards\nhis\n&gt; quarters grumbling about running out of bombs in the middle of battle.\n&gt;\n&gt; ===================\n&gt;\n&gt; Punch looked around, activating his com, heading for the Predacon base.\n&gt; &lt;Zardus, Punch here.  I will spy on the Predacons, unless you wish\notherwise.\n&gt;  Punch out&gt;\n&gt; When out of sight of the Alliance base he spoke.  &quot;Punch, Counterize!&quot; he\n&gt; yelled, transforming into his alternate mode, Counter Punch.  The white\nand\n&gt; gray robot looked around.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Perfect,&quot; he chuckled, taking out his photon rifle, proceeding to the\n&gt; Predacon base.\n&gt;\n&gt; ===================\n&gt;\n&gt; Double Punch growled, rolling to the left 5 feet, again not wanting to\ngive\n&gt; away his position.  Raising both pinchers, two missiles fired from one at\n&gt; Quickstrike&#39;s chest, a cyberbee (customized, named Beeline, check profile\nif\n&gt; needed) launching from his other pincher, Beeline firing three optic\nlasers\n&gt; (size of regular cyberbee) off at Quickstrike&#39;s left shoulder, pulling up\n&gt; into the air.\n&gt;\n&gt; ===================\n&gt;\n&gt; Bumblebee woke up.  &quot;What the slag!?&quot; he yelled.  Thinking for a moment,\nhe\n&gt; realized what had happened.  &quot;That red and yellow guy must&#39;ve hit me or\n&gt; something.&quot; getting up, he headed for the CR chambers in the Predacon\nbase.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Porsche Boxter.
