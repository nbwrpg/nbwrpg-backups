He slowly Checked to make sure\n&gt;she knew of Megatron and megatron being the Leadar. He made sure She\n&gt;knew that QuickStrike was 2nd in command. He also made a list of all\n&gt;the other bots in their little group in her head. Scorponok then\n&gt;pulls\n&gt;out a little laptop and plugs it into Darkmouse&#39;s Processing unit.\n&gt;She\n&gt;pulls out, from the laptop, two little blocks with a button on it. He\n&gt;hids the laptop and the 2 blocks. He slowly wakes up Darkmouse. &quot;All\n&gt;finish.&quot; Scorponok walks away with the laptop and the two blocks. He\n&gt;puts the laptop and 1 of the blocks in his hand. He takes the other\n&gt;block and walks up too Megatron. &quot;I have a present for you Megatron.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
