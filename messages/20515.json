But I had a lot to explain in a \nreally short amount of time. But I did try to make it as interesting as \npossible, and if you read this I promise that you�ll find out quite a bit \nabout IR that she didn�t even know herself.\nI hope you at least enjoy it a little.\n\n\n* Iron Raptor simply sighed. A good few dozen tones of scrap armor plating \nwould kill a bot, but she was still slightly nerved by losing on of her own.\nMaybe�maybe if she had been there to stop the battle instead of at the CF \ninstead�maybe�maybe she could have stopped this from happening.\nBut then a suddenly familiar voice fills her internal sensors, causing her \nto lower her head a bit. *\n\nIRIS: �It�s about time you got here!!�\n\n* Iron Raptor growled and looked around the scraps which surrounded her, \ntrying to pinpoint Iris�s current location.\nHer voice was a bit of a growl*\n\n� I found her�.�\n\n* All she had to do was look down, and there in a cracked monitor screen was \na pulsating star right between her front limbs, which was Iris�s symbol \nwhich she used to communicate over programs.\nIt was obvious she was running on her self -power, the screen not fuzzy at \nall.\nIron Raptor looked down at Iris.*\n\n� Geez�haven�t seen your ugly mug for a while��\n\n* She teased. *\n\nIRIS: � Well�I wasn�t quite expecting to see the one you�re wearing for \nquite some time yet. So let me assure you, Toad Face. The surprise is \nmutual��\n\n* Iron Raptor�s expression changed instantly as soon as Iris mentioned that \nshe wasn�t supposed to look like this�YET?!!\nShe bent over the screen.*\n\n� What do you mean, �yet�? Was this supposed to happen?�\n\n* Iris didn�t answer at first, her symbol simply pulsating for a moment. \nFinally she spoke in rather a serious tone.*\n\nIRIS: � You know WHAT you are, right? And that the Second Beast Mode was \nprogrammed into you, correct?�\n\n* Iron Raptor simply nodded, faintly wondering when Prowl was going to come \nover and see this too. It seemed important enough�.\nIris continued.*\n\n� Well�that Second Beast Mode was originally your real beast mode�and when \nyou crashed on this planet it just so happened that another beast mode was \nscanned for you since your first couldn�t survive on this planet on its own.\nSo, a raptor was scanned and since your SBM wasn�t able to exist with long \nexposure to this planets atmosphere it became something which you could call \nupon when you needed to�but not for long.�\n\n* Iron Raptor took this all in the best she could, finding all of this new.\nShe looked over her shoulder for a split second to see if Prowl had come \nover or was listening, all of this information new to her too.\nShe then looked back towards the star.*\n\nIRIS: �Well�through the months you�ve been here your SBM has gotten use to \nthe atmosphere and now�wants to become the dominant mode again. But, your \nraptor mode is very stubborn and wouldn�t give it up so�it merged�and now \nthey�re still fighting for which can dominate as the real beast mode. \nUnderstand?�\n\n* Iron Raptor simply nodded, her head a bit numb with the new information \nand trying to take it all in, finding it not quite as difficult as she \nthought.\nShe rolled her shoulders a bit to get rid of a growing knot that was \nbuilding in them.*\n\n� So�what you�re saying is that when I landed on this planet my SBM was my \nreal mode?�\n\nIRIS: � Yes.�\n\n� And then  somehow a new beast mode was scanned for me and since the SBM \nwasn�t use to the atmosphere it let  the raptor take over?�\n\nIRIS: � Yes.�\n\n� Then, once the SBM got use to the atmosphere it wanted to be the main \nbeast mode again�but the raptor doesn�t want to give it up so they�re \nfighting now?�\n\nIRIS: � You got it, kid-o.�\n\n* Iron Raptor simply sighed and then lay down, it all a bit too much to \nbring in�but it all made perfect sense.\nShe lay her head on her clawed hands and closed her eyes, laying perfectly \nstill.*\n\n� So�you knew this was going to happen?�\n\nIRIS: � Anyone with half a brain could see that such a powerful beast mode \nwasn�t going to stay quiet forever. It had had a taste for power before, \nthen was in an unfamiliar place and decided to lay low until it knew it�s \nterrain like any clearly thinking thing. But finally when it knew what it \nwas up against it made itself strong and then tried to take over again only \nto find that it�s past position was already filled. And it did when any \nproud thing would, it tried to take back what was rightfully its own. But \nits competition hasn�t given in�so�that was what the pain was. Both of your \nbeast modes dukeing it out, and they still fight on now and will forever \nuntil only one of them is left surviving. That�s why you merged, each had \nhad a moment to try and transform but they both did it at once�mixed a bit \nof your DNA and here you are now.\nClearly showing two beast modes which are only half transformed. Each trying \nto kill the other so that it can fully transform and take the place as your \nbeast mode.�\n\n* Iron Raptor simply opened her eyes and lifted her head.*\n\n� And what happens if one kills the other?�\n\nIRIS: � Half of you will die��\n\n* Iron Raptor simply shook her head, wondering just when the difficulties \nand problems would finally stop. Everything happening so fast and now \nfinding out that she could die if one of her modes died as well.\nShe then looked down at the star with a blank look.*\n\n� And if neither  gives in?�\n\nIRIS: � Then you will remain like this until one eventually does die, unable \nto transform because your spark is so corrupted by the modes that it doesn�t \nknow beast from bot.�\n\n* Iron Raptor then sighed and looked up at the sky, wondering just how it \ncould be such a good day with such rotten things happening now.\nShe then slowly looked off towards Prowl, her eyes basically saying that she \ndidn�t know what to do now�.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
