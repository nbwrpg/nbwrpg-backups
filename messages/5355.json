She saw the two bots walk \noff together.  She yawned and looked back to the inside of the base.  She \nknew she didn&#39;t belong.  She wished her old pack was still alive.  But she \nmade it and they didn&#39;t.  She looked back outside remembered days of hunting \nwith the pack. Growing up with the pack rules. She longed to hunt again.  It \nhad bee a while since she hunted.  She sniffed the air, she could smell \nanother wolf.  Oh well, she thought, this isn&#39;t a pack society. She smiled \nat a few memories of her pack. She went back inside and walked around.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
