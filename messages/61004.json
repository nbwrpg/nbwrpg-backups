She drummed her fingers on \nhis \n&gt; spark chamber.  Malice took a sharp breath, it really freaked him \n&gt; out to have someone touching his spark chamber.  Hellplague \ngiggled \n&gt; and laid down next Malice.  He looked at her with a mix expression \n&gt; of relief and suprise.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Please, don&#39;t do that.  It feels really weird.&quot; he said.\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague grinned and the moved in to kiss him.  As she did, \nher \n&gt; hand reurned to drumming on his spark chamber.
