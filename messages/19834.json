She was admiring her \nreflection and smiling. Then a tail splashed and rippled the water. \nIt was a fish. She growled &quot;Hey! That wasn&#39;t very nice.&quot;  She let out \nher kitten roar and swatted at the fish in the water. The fish just \nswam away. &quot;Get back here you. I&#39;m a fierce predacon. And your going \nto be dinner.&quot; She leaned over and tried to swat at the fish, even \nthough it was a few yards away. She leaned over a little further, \ntrying to reach the fish.  Her paws slipped on the wet grass, and she \nfell into the pond.  She splashed around and her head went under \nwater. She came back up to the surface, choking and splashing, trying \nto keep her head above the water. &quot;HELP!&quot;  her went under and then \ncame back up. She coughed and sputtered. &quot;HEL..&quot; Her head went back \nunder the water. She couldn&#39;t swim. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; ::Windlord::\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord didn&#39;t stop to heard what Aerotaur would say about Trinity.\n&gt; \n&gt; He run where he guess that Trinity could be screaaming &quot;Trinity... \n&gt; TRINITRY!!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
