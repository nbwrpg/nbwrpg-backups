Irrationaly, he cursed himself for being stupid enough to \ncollide with a tree branch.\n\nThere was no feeling as Iron Raptor dug a claw into his neck, other \nthan the sickening one of some of his insides being pused aside. Whe \nplace where Iron Raptor had incerted her claw was still in the numb \nregion.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; * Iron Raptor crept a little closer as she saw Prowl move, but the \nface that \n&gt; it was only her arms worried her.\n&gt; And with a simple scan, she detected why.\n&gt; Something was wrong with his main processor, something which seems \nas if it \n&gt; had been ripped from it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor came up beside Prowl and looked down at his back, \ngently moving \n&gt; the broken wing out of the way.\n&gt; She looked at the back of his neck but there was no telling from \nthe outside \n&gt; just what was wrong.\n&gt; Moving him could damage even more, but she had the faintest idea of \njust \n&gt; what to do.\n&gt; With much doubt Iron Raptor dug in a long claw into the back of his \nneck, \n&gt; relying on senses and touch to see just what had disconected.\n&gt; And she was sure that if Prowl could scream now, he would.*\n\n\n"}}
