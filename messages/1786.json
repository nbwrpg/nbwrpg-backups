If a new bots\nsaw\n&gt; him now, with no explaination of his condition, they would think he was\n&gt; drunk.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Easy,&quot; he said to Sinesis. &quot;Go inside. The computer will let ya in,&quot; he\n&gt; guestured a long fingered hand to him. &quot;if ya ask &#39;er.&quot; He looked to the\n&gt; ship. &quot;Computer, on-guard. Prepare fer enemy attack. Fire auto-guns on any\n&gt; unknown Predacon signatures.&quot; He named all the Predacons on Hell Beast&#39;s\n&gt; team as best as he could, then as he was finished, he stepped forward. He\n&gt; whimpered at the pain in his leg. It wouldn&#39;t let him go any further.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free, easy email groups PLUS\n&gt; great features like calendars and storage files\n&gt; All at eGroups for you today.
