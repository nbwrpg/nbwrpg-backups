Dracona has been hard\nat work making weapons dfor you, and this is how you repay me?&quot; Plintissa\nsaid. Dracona sighed and pulled out a rifle, displaying it right in front of\nIron Raptor. (occ: RGDan isn&#39;t leader if he&#39;s not here, I want to move the\nstory along and RGDan is going to take forever, so Iron raptor can be leader\nright now.) Plintissa sighed. &quot;I just wanted to see you again, and seeing\nthat Liono appears to be nowhere around i figured i&#39;d say this to you, Iron\nRaptor. Why are you trying to destroy my team? We have been working for you\never since the team started and your warrior blasts mine. Why is that?&quot;\nPlintissa asked Iron Raptor. Plintissa crossed her arms and waited for an\nanswer, very sad that Iron Raptor wasn&#39;t her friend anymore.

Besides, she had no idea what Plintissa was talking about when she\nsaid that she had her own group, obviously a bunch of renegades and no mads.\n&gt; But then she looked down at Plintissa, the expression on her face clearly\nsaying that she wasn&#39;t convinced.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No. If you have something to say then you can say it here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She wasn&#39;t in the mood to argue about whether or not they were going\ninto the base and she was also on the verge of just leaving and returning to\nthe War room.\n&gt; Iron Raptor knew that Plintissa was her friend, or that was how it seemed.\nBut even with that she wasn&#39;t about to let her into the base, it would be a\nviolation of the codes of order. And she for one was going to obey them.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
