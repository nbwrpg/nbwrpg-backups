He would have tried to fly out, but all his flying abilities\n&gt; allowed him to do is go up, which was pointing down in this case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Opening up a communication line, he soon found that this sand was\n&gt; blocking radio transmissions.  There must have been some sort of metal\n&gt; in this sand.  So left with his final option, he was going to use his\n&gt; arms and legs to slowly dig himself out of the sand.  He was unable to\n&gt; tell how deep he was in the sand, but when he tried to move it\n&gt; helped..... a little.  So he began to squirm in a way that he filled\n&gt; in the space below him, and dug out the space above him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Upon calculating the preasure on his armor, Celeron determined it\n&gt; would take him at least 5 hours to get out to the surface.\n&gt; Fortunately he had recharged before he has gotten here, but he had no\n&gt; memory of when or why he was here.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, Celeron put on some good music and kept digging.\n&gt; \n&gt; (To Be Continued)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:  I haven&#39;t posted for like 6 months.
