She&#39;d \nalmost scrapped him, didn&#39;t she? And she knew where to hit as well, enough \ndamage the central nerve system and it could kill a bot!\nDinobot crept on, it was then that the faint sent of warm fur caught his \nattention. Some sort of large mammal was near by!\nHe stalked into the underbrush and disappeared into the morning, breakfast \nwould be soon!*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
