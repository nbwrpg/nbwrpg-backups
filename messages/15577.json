No I am forced to \nmake this post quite short in order to keep up with you all. Apperantly I \nneed to be quicker...after getting my tonsils out.)\n\n* Dinobot watched as Dark One was sent into a spin from both Tavatron and \nhis own charges, a growl of satisfaction trickling from his throat.\nHe knew that there were more Alliance bots where this one came from, and \nthat Dark One wasn�t defeated yet. He continued to watch as Dark One \ntransformed into robot mode, waiting for him to fire at him again and give \nhim ample reason to attack once again.\nDinobot had had a feeling deep within his gut that this would happen, sooner \nor later. And, it did.\nAnd as injured as he was, he planned to defeat the enemy before he finally \nfell to his knees and gave up.\nDinobot watched the hoe constantly, but he knew just where Tavatron stood, \njust around his blind spot�that just happened to keep growing! He snarled \nangrily, now his systems were beginning to dissolve, beginning with a simple \nfluid pump, and now his sight! That would be his downfall, but lucky enough \nfor him it was only one optic and not both.\nYet, still, the enemy would have an even more unfair advantage then they \nalready did, they wouldn�t only outnumber them but would be able to shot him \non his blind side and he wouldn�t even see it coming.\nHowever, luckily, in the past Beast Wars, he had actually learned that sight \nwasn�t everything. And it was also his senses he could rely.\nOf course, that was if he didn�t bleed to death first, which he was losing \nmech-fluid now at an alarming rate...because his spark was beating faster \nand pumping fluid faster as well����right out of the hole in his \nchest-plate.\nDinobot sidestepped as a charge from Dark One whizzed past him, his optics \nnever leaving the enemy as he did so.\nBut now, now Tavatron and himself were not alone in their fight towards the \nAlliance, no. Now they had counter attacks, several of them at that. All \nMaximal warriors, come to aid them.\nBut even as he watched, the plot of this battle shifted�into a duel.\nDinobot watched as both Firearm and Dark One began to pair off, his sight \ndecreasing even as he stood there.\nA growl rumbling deeply within his voice, knowing that he wished to battle \ninstead of standing by and watching others do it.\nThis wasn�t fair, and he didn�t like it.\nBut, he had no choice as he walked closer to the two battling bots, watching \nevery move, which happened, focusing the best he could with what little \nsight was left in his other optic.\nHis tail twitched behind him with anticipation, just waiting for a time when \none made the wrong move and he would have be able to slag the Alliance \nenemy. He waited, crushed that he could no longer battle and was left to \nwatch others do so, but he waited.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
