She was \n&gt; approaching the position of Kup and Sunhawk, and she\n&gt; hoped she was not \n&gt; too late.\n&gt; \n&gt; After a few minutes, she was visible to both of\n&gt; them, but she stood \n&gt; hovering high in the air. Her arrival, though had\n&gt; made much noise, so \n&gt; she was not totally unannounced.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
