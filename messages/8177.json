The sensor ghosts disappearing so that they would only detect her.\nThough, since she wasn&#39;t going to exit with the others, she was going to exit through the front door.\nWith a second sigh she then fixes him with a determined and stern stare, hoping that he would listen to her then despite what doubts he had in his spark.*\n\n&quot; PROWL! Do you think that I&#39;m so incompetent that I can&#39;t look after myself?!&quot;\n\n* She shook her head.*\n\n&quot; I know better to let them get me by surprise again. But I just ask you to do this simple task for me this one time and you say, &#39; No&#39;?&quot;\n\n* She walked up to him and placed a gentle hand on his cheek with a sigh, pleading very visible in her own optics.*\n\n&quot; I know you&#39;re worried about me, Prowl. But it&#39;s time to think with your head...and not your spark.&quot;\n\n\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
