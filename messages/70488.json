I know I will be able to do this, and if any harm comes to m=\r\ne, then nothing will be held against any of you but myself. I will take ful=\r\nl blame for what happens. In Primus&#39;s speed my friends, in Primus&#39;s speed. =\r\nGood will prevail, and the light will remain forever lit. Now, let&#39;s do thi=\r\ns before we lose him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He lies still to await hookup.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSanton no=\r\ndded as he he gestured for Legacy to begin connecting Tuscon\nto Rodimus.\n\n&quot;=\r\nThis is alien technology that is affecting Rodimus.&quot; Bump spoke up\nfrom his=\r\n position next to Tuscon. &quot;We do not know what will happen or\nhow this will=\r\n affect you or Rodimus. Be very careful.&quot;\n\nSanton pointed to a seperate sca=\r\nnning module, &quot;We will be watching\nyour spark signature as well. If it shou=\r\nld dip into critical levels we\nshall pull you out.&quot;\n\n&quot;He is ready.&quot; Legacy =\r\nsaid as he connected two thick cables and\nseveral smaller ones to Tuscon&#39;s =\r\npower module.\n\nSanton nodded again, &quot;Begin.&quot;\n\n*    *    *    *    *\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n=\r\n\n&gt; Outside in the observation room, it doesn&#39;t take Straight Shot long to s=\r\nee what is going on. But deep down she knew he was doing the right thing, s=\r\nhe felt it too. Night Shift could also feel what his comrade was up to, and=\r\n a feeling of absolute positivity comes over him as well. Quickstride, howe=\r\nver has the same feelings as Noctorro and Bump. But Rat Trap holds onto the=\r\n positivity that Straight Shot and Night Shift share as well as Silverbolt.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I know wheels, he&#39;s gonna make it, I know he is. Somethn&#39; inside me =\r\ntells me so and that doesn&#39;t happen too often.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to =\r\nhim, and holds his hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You feel it too, so do I. He can do this, I k=\r\nnow he can. Silverbolt&#39;s right, he can do this. We have to believe he can. =\r\nIt&#39;s our belief in him that&#39;s gonna make him pull through.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift=\r\n keeps a finger crossed as he stands next to Silverbolt.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You feel it t=\r\noo, huh Silverbolt. That deep down feeling that no matter what happens, goo=\r\nd is gonna prevail. It&#39;s real guys, it&#39;s real. Tucson Prime&#39;s got somethn&#39; =\r\ninside him that I can&#39;t explain but it&#39;s there and it&#39;s gonna work.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ra=\r\nt Trap chimes in.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Just think, we&#39;ll have two Primes plus Lord Elder, =\r\nand Lord Perseus on our side. That&#39;s really gonna put a damper on lizard li=\r\np&#39;s day. Ohh yeah, when we&#39;re all back tagether, look out, because that gol=\r\nden age is just a few shots away.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot listens to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; =\r\nAnd then maybe, just maybe we&#39;ll have something to celebrate.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSilv=\r\nerbolt continued to watch the operation through the glass, his\nface lightly=\r\n reflected in the glass was thoughtful as his optics took\nin the scene. &quot;We=\r\n will be victorious, because have to be.&quot; he said as\nhis own hand clamped d=\r\nown. He was a soldier, a knight, who was ready\nto do battle, and yet there =\r\nwas nothing to battle. He felt helpless.\n\nYet none of that was on his face =\r\nas he looked back, &quot;Sometimes all we\nhave is hope.&quot; he said his voice confi=\r\ndent. &quot;No doubt Hydras is also\nusing this time to consoldate his black army=\r\n for what ever evil scheme\nhe has in mind.&quot; He smiled, &quot;But we shall be rea=\r\ndy for him, with all\nof our combined might.&quot;\n\nHe looked back at the operati=\r\non as Tuscon was being connected, &quot;We\nwill be waiting for you when you retu=\r\nrn.&quot; he said, his voice low.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
