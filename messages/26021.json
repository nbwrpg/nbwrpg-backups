He looks around again, just to make sure and dashes through the \nfeild.*\n\n&quot; By the Matrix, I hope i get through this!!&quot;\n\n*He runs on top of a hill and stops to look around and catch his breath. He \nspies Iron Raptor and the rest nearby and trots towards them.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;*Snow Tech&#39;s eye lids flutter and open. He groans and props his head off \n&gt;the\n&gt;ground with his elbows, and looks around. He catiously gets up, aware he\n&gt;could get caught, but knowing he could get caught if he just stayed there.\n&gt;When he doesn&#39;t see anything or anyone, he stands totally on both his feet,\n&gt;hoping that he hadn&#39;t broken anything important. When he checked himself\n&gt;over and found almost no damage, except for some scratches and occasional\n&gt;bruise or two.\n&gt;He looks at the sky and finds he had been out for at least two or more\n&gt;hours. He hoped that Shadow Cat had found her way out of the Alien bots\n&gt;grasps and had gotten to saftey. He had the first, he wasn&#39;t caught, but he\n&gt;was still vulnrable, so was not safe. He sighed and began to follow the\n&gt;large trail made by the larger aliens back to the battle feild....*\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
