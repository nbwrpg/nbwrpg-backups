He was starting to lose them, increasing his speed and hoping that they didn&#39;t do the same. His scanners reported a base somewhere south, a very large one from the strengh of the energy signature. They also reported a bot approaching from behind, and by the time the gattling gun was fired, Slayer manages to dodge most of it, the blast blowing off one of his back feet.\n\nHe looks back at the three bots behind him, growling and heading a bit to the left, flying above ocean now, continuing to head south.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He arrives at Kali&#39;s position and transformes to bot mode. He gets a\n&gt; good aim on slayer with his gattaling gun, and opens fire.\n\n\n"}}
