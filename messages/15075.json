I&#39;m glad you just reminded me about Terrorsaur, RoboRick. My \n&gt; mind is starting to slip.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Terrorsaur:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Terrorsaur was relieved that wasn&#39;t aboard Phobia&#39;s ship. He had \n&gt; heard the engines blow, and moved away from it. He was proud of his \n&gt; flight abilities. It made him feel superior. He waited until things \n&gt; settled down when he lowered down, setting Cave-In on the ground and \n&gt; transformed to beast mode. He stood from a short distance, watching \n&gt; the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
