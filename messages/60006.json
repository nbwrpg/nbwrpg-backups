((Unicron)) --&gt; Primus\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=35280091\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: cycodrone\r\n\r\nPrimus was taken aback slightly- how had he even\ncontemplated this possibility- this had not happpened\ninitially- the only possible way that he could have\nconcluded this Unicron found out is if its future self\ncommunicated with it. That created an interesting\ndilenma- how to defeat him without killing him- it was\nthen that it hit him.\n\n&#39;Shadimus, I have an idea- I&#39;mn going to use you as a\nspark conduit- not enough to kill him, but enough to\ninflinct incredible damage. The downside is that you\nmay die again in the process- so I ask you to decide\nthis next course of action of your own free will.&#39;\n\nShadimus was in a uandry- he&#39;d bqarley had a chance to\nsay hi to his son and his old friends and now he would\nmost likely die again. But then if he refused, it was\nlikely that his firends and his only living child for\nthat matter, would perish.\n\n&#39;How ironic,&#39; he thought to himself &#39;to have the fate\nof the universe in your hands and yet have no choice\nat all&#39;\n\n&#39;Primus, if this is the only way, then I will obey\nyour request.&#39;\n\nShadimus then rushed out of the Ark and transformed\ninto his Air attack mode, only to find that Primus had\nmodified it for transatmospheric flight. Wasting not\ntime, he proceeded to fly exit the planet&#39;s\natmosphere.\n\n --- Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@...&gt; wrote: \n---------------------------------\nUnicron was taken aback by feeling Primus.

Taking control, he\nsent\n&gt; a chillingly stern message through to every spark in\n&gt; the vicinity of of the Earth and its satellites.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I will warn you once abomination- end your temporal\n&gt; sabotage now, or I will eradicate your spark and the\n&gt; sparks of all your minions from existence.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile outside the Arkt, giant robotic forms were\n&gt; materialising out of thin air. The first to\n&gt; materialise was a samurai like figure with a\nskeletal\n&gt; face, his brown and yellow familiar to all those who\n&gt; knew their Cybertronain history.  His virtually\n&gt; indestructible Neo-titanium sword drawn, his eyes\n&gt; meant business. While the thought of working with\n&gt; inferior warriors such as Autobots sickened him, he\n&gt; knew all too well that Primus&#39; commissioning of him\n&gt; was a matter of honor, in edition to the fact that\n&gt; Unicron&#39;s dishonourable tactics sickened him to the\n&gt; core. Bludgeon was reborn- and he meant business. \nHe\n&gt; was shortly followed by an all too familiar Silver\nand\n&gt; Gold T-Rex.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The moment after he materialised, he transformed\ninto\n&gt; robort mode, Energio Sword drawn and double\nbarrelled\n&gt; mortar launcher in hand- Grimlock had returned. \nNext\n&gt; to materialise was a form new to all- his warrior\n&gt; visage looked a mixure of american Indian and\nViking,\n&gt; his power sword in hand- Magnaboss was born. \n&gt; Following him was a giant, even by Autobot standard,\n&gt; his wings and backpack towering over bludgeon and\n&gt; Grimlock, as his round head and broad shoulders\nformed\n&gt; before the rest of his solid built robotic body\n&gt; materialised, his double barreled particle beam\ncannon\n&gt; at the ready- Skyfire was reborn.  Next to him, the\n&gt; technorganic form of a wolf with a a mean look on\nhis\n&gt; face srpouting a mean looking cannon appeared-\n&gt; Carnivac had joined the fray.   Folloing Carnivac, a\n&gt; green and grey moving powerhouse materialised with\n&gt; enough firepower to back up any arguement it put\n&gt; forward. The tanks transformed to reveal the former\n&gt; Autobot Headmaster- Hardhead.  Hardhead was then\n&gt; joined by two more comrades- the first a being of\n&gt; great courage and one worthy of being called a\nwarrior\n&gt; even by Bludgeon&#39;s standards. Even though he had\nbeen\n&gt; physically weak in the past, his fluro green, black\n&gt; and gold form now stood as tall as bludgeon, as\nPrimus\n&gt; had seen fit to revive his body at its most\npowerful-\n&gt; Bumblebee had returned.\n&gt; \n&gt; The final Autobot to appear looked somewhat like a\n&gt; samurai in armour- the tall, tower-like shoulders,\n&gt; even broader form than his traditional body, coupled\n&gt; with his sword of pure energon and double barrelled\n&gt; laser cannon, made this Autobot even more\n&gt; inspirational and intimidating than he had been in\nthe\n&gt; past.  Optimus Prime had returned.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: the materialising takes place over mere seconds\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: Primus addressed all transformers in the Earth\n&gt; sphere once more &quot;Send your minions chaos bringer,\nbut\n&gt; beware, just as you have your minions, I have my\n&gt; champions. Take note of their sparks abomination-\nwhen\n&gt; you do, you&#39;ll see your minions do not stand a\n&gt; chance.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Primus waited for a reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: In case some people are wondering, I&#39;ve had\n&gt; Primus bring back these transformers in their most\n&gt; powerful forms that we saw them in  in the toy line-\n&gt; thus Bludgeon has his pretender shell, as does\n&gt; carnivac, Bumblebee is a Gobot, Skyfire is in his\n&gt; original form as is Grimlock, Magnaboss has been\nused\n&gt; for the autobot/maximal quartet, and Optimus Prime\nis\n&gt; a Laser Rod. \n&gt;  --- Jerame Johnson &lt;jeramej@y...&gt; wrote: &gt;\n&gt; NewHope 2:\n&gt; &gt; Where the Bigger Vessel Landed in the ocean.
