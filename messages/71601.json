It was a part of building integrity and wisdom, which Tucson\n&gt; believed in most of all.  Without wisdom, how could one evolve into a\n&gt; respected individual?  A look of shock and sheer annoyance floods his face.\n&gt; Yet before anything else he looks to Cyclonus and the others before\n&gt; addressing Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Excuse us for a moment.  Wait here, we&#39;ll be right back.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With that he sharply turns to land quickly on the ground and does so on all\n&gt; fours with a solid thud.  Ground debris dances beneath him due to the impact\n&gt; as he swiftly gets into robot mode , not waiting for Rodimus to dismount.\n&gt; Normally he would not have done so but it was clear he was less than\n&gt; impressed with his comment.  He stands firmly with an angry expression on\n&gt; his faceplate.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I am not thrilled to be doing this myself but there are times when we ALL\n&gt; must do things we dislike doing.  I thought you might have enough integrity\n&gt; to understand our situation.  Apparently I was wrong.  After everything I\n&gt; went through to bring you back safely, and THAT IS HOW YOU RETURN THE\n&gt; FAVOR!?   BY DIRESPECTING CYCLONUS YOU DISRESPECT ME! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes a moment to cool off his overheated temper. He replies to Wing\n&gt; Caliber in the mean time.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Of course, please retain a defense force at the Ark by all means. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns back to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll leave it up to you to decide what you want to do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His expression remains curt while with Rodimus.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON spoke the expression on his face darkened as he crossed his\narms over his chest, his optics smoldering with repressed anger and\nheat. There was no flinching from RODIMUS, no stepping back and most\ncertainly no fear.\n\n&quot;What you did?&quot; RODIMUS said in low tones that would not carry over to\nthe Predacons, but his words were fierc, obviously his own temper\nfinally about to explode as well. The look on his face was one of\ndisbelief.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re going to try holding that over my head?&quot; There was a shake of\nhis head. &quot;I had to live with these *Predacons*&quot; RODIMUS spit out the\nword &#39;Predacon&#39; like a curse. &quot;And they changed me into a monster!\nThey captured my wife and had me hold her while they tried to change\nher! I was about to loose my family because of them and you want me to\nwork with them now, after all that?&quot; The incredulousness of it all was\nin every word he spoke.\n\nIf TUSCON thought RODIMUS was a shrinking wall flower and would cave\nin he was mistaken.\n\nRODIMUS breathed in deep, it had been a while since his own temper had\ncome out, and yet once it did, it felt good - he had spent so much\ntime having to reign it in.\n\n&quot;We have *both* sacrificed to save others many times&quot; RODIMUS said in\na hard whisper. &quot;And for you to try to hold that over my head . . . to\ntry and guilt me into doing something like that . . . that is beneath\nall of us and I thought you as well.&quot;\n\nTurning away from TUSCON he started to stalk towards the Dinosaurs\nRODIMUS&#39; whole frame rigid, it would be some time for him to calm down\nas well. &quot;We will talk about this later Tuscon, for now we have to\nfinish what you have started.&quot;\n\nAt the same time LEO PRIME&#39;s voice came back over the comlink, &quot;I will\nsend the Fuzors to you. They should be there in a couple of hours.&quot;\nThere was a pause from LEO, &quot;But I need to know what you&#39;re trying to\ndo. Working with the Predacons is a dangerous business.&quot;\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, Straight Shot&#39;s beacon begins to flash a little bit faster as\n&gt; Waspinator continues his course.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s it Waspinator!  You&#39;re on target!  Keep on a northward track, my\n&gt; signal is getting really strong now.  Scourge, be ready with the sweeps!\n&gt; It&#39;s only a matter of time before we reach our target!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Below everyone, Night Shift now makes it into the forest and spots\n&gt; Waspinator with Straight Shot in tow.  Having got the memo, he follows them\n&gt; from below.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hey, thought ya might need backup! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot picks up on Night Shift but also Elita.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; WHAT THE PIT ARE YA DOING BRINGING ELITA INTO THIS!?  ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR\n&gt; PROCESSOR?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift replies sheepishly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I know, I&#39;m in trouble.  But I couldn&#39;t leave her alone without protection.\n&gt; Besides, she has ta learn how ta take on a challenge at some point, and now\n&gt; is a good a time as any ta start teaching her.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot sighs and shrugs it off.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Okay if you say so.  Just don&#39;t let Rodimus find out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She turns to Waspinator.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Sorry about that, I had to reply to Nightshift.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With plans moving forward, everyone puts their minds on what needs to be\n&gt; done.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWAPINATOR contiues to fly, his wings buzzing as he holds himself and\nSTRAIGHT SHOT in the air. &quot;What does arrow bot think she has located?&quot;\ncame his response as he flew onward.\n\n&quot;Yes indeed.&quot; SCOURGE said as he flew up next to them. &quot;I don&#39;t\nremember any signal out there. Perhaps the little bit is leading us\ninto a trap?&quot;\n\nThe other sweeps fan out again as NIGHTSHIFT showed up beneath them.\nThere was a chuckle from SCOURGE, &quot;And I think I smell a young and\ntender Maximal down there.&quot; He chuckled again. &quot;And they are not\nsuppose to be here . . . nice!&quot; There was a chuckle as he banked off\nagain to sweep around.\n\nSCOURGE sent HYDRAS a short secret message, &quot;Something small and\nprecious belonging to Rodimus is here.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
