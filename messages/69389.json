Knowing that their only hope of survival was to\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; safely=\r\n crash land, the pilot picked an open area of ocean and tried to\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; appr=\r\noach at a safe angle to slow itself enough to keep the ship intact.\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;\n =\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus and his crew walked along the bridge that crossed the gap=\r\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; between the part of the island where the hangers were located and th=\r\ne\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; peninsula area where the base sat. Suddenly the sky became dark and=\r\n a\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; rumbling noise could be heard, growing louder and louder. He looke=\r\nd up to\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; see almost the whole sky occupied by a massive starship seeml=\r\ny heading\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; straight for the island. The Atlantis emergency alarm start=\r\ned to sound\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; and\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; civilians rushed to their shelters.\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &quot;Everyone! To the base!

As Perseus and his c=\r\nrew\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; reached\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; the base door, it was quickly opened for them then =\r\nshut behind them. He\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; ordered everyone to move the lower level of the =\r\nbase. As the ship passed\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; over the island, the sound grew so loud that=\r\n the ground shook and weaker\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; parts of buildings started to crumble, a=\r\ns in an earthquake. The ship\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; traveled for another three miles before =\r\nit touched down in the deep ocean\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; waters. The force of the impact sen=\r\nt the ship hundreds of feet below the\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; surface and it continued to sin=\r\nk until coming to rest on the top of an\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; underwater mountain. The mass=\r\n of water displaced by the ship started a\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; massive tsunami-like wave, =\r\ngoing out in all directions.\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; The ground began to shake again an=\r\nd the lights flickered inside the\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; Maximal\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; base.\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Si=\r\nr, what&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing the last heavy door to\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nthe\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; underground section of the base.\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; The lights continued=\r\n to flicker, then went out.\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; At that moment the ten-story-high w=\r\nall of water struck Atlantis from the\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; east, picking up all the boats =\r\nin the harbor and tossing them onto the\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; land.\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; The parts of the =\r\ndocks that were not made of concrete were pushed up and\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; destroyed. A =\r\nmoment later the water hit the buildings in the lower wharf\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; area and =\r\nthey immediately collapsed under the intense weight of water.\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; Likewis=\r\ne the metal dome that made up the upper story of the Maximal base\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; was=\r\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; immediately ripped from its foundations and carried away, along with=\r\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; everything in the command center, the armory, mess hall, and the mai=\r\nn\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; bank\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; of CR chambers were also picked up and carried away.\n  &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; The lower floor of the base had a large metal slab to protect it f=\r\nrom\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; bombing, and as the water continued to pour over it, everything o=\r\nn the\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; upper\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; floors was ripped away, leaving a clean plate of me=\r\ntal sitting at the\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; bottom\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; of the crater that was the base.

Knowing that thei=\r\nr only hope of survival was to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; safely \n  crash land, the pi=\r\nlot picked an open area of ocean and tried \n  to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; approach a=\r\nt a safe angle to slow itself enough to keep the \n  ship intact.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus and his crew walked \n  along the bridge =\r\nthat crossed the gap&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between the part of the \n  island wher=\r\ne the hangers were located and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peninsula area \n  where =\r\nthe base sat. Suddenly the sky became dark and a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n  rumblin=\r\ng noise could be heard, growing louder and louder. He looked up \n  to&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt;&gt; see almost the whole sky occupied by a massive starship \n  seeml=\r\ny heading&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; straight for the island. The Atlantis emergency \n=\r\n  alarm started to sound&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; civilians rush=\r\ned to \n  their shelters.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Everyone! To the =\r\nbase! \n  Hurry!&quot; ordered Perseus breaking out into a \n  run.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The rumbling sound continued to get \n  louder. As Perseus=\r\n and his crew&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reached&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the \n  base door, it =\r\nwas quickly opened for them then shut behind them. \n  He&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or=\r\ndered everyone to move the lower level of the base. As \n  the ship passed&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over the island, the sound grew so loud that \n  the ground s=\r\nhook and weaker&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parts of buildings started to \n  crumble, a=\r\ns in an earthquake. The ship&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; traveled for another \n  three =\r\nmiles before it touched down in the deep ocean&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; waters. \n  T=\r\nhe force of the impact sent the ship hundreds of feet below \n  the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; surface and it continued to sink until coming to rest on \n  the top=\r\n of an&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; underwater mountain. The mass of water displaced \n  =\r\nby the ship started a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; massive tsunami-like wave, going out =\r\nin \n  all directions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The ground began to s=\r\nhake \n  again and the lights flickered inside the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n  Maxima=\r\nl&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; base.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Sir, what&#39;s \n  tha=\r\nt noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing the last heavy door to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n  =\r\nthe&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; underground section of the \n  base.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The lights continued to flicker, then \n  went out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At that moment the ten-story-high \n  wall of water str=\r\nuck Atlantis from the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; east, picking up all \n  the boats in =\r\nthe harbor and tossing them onto the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n  land.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; The parts of the docks that were not made of concrete \n  were pushed up =\r\nand&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; destroyed. A moment later the water hit the \n  building=\r\ns in the lower wharf&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; area and they immediately \n  collapsed=\r\n under the intense weight of water.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Likewise the \n  metal d=\r\nome that made up the upper story of the Maximal base&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n  was=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately ripped from its foundations and carried away, =\r\n\n  along with&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything in the command center, the armory,=\r\n mess \n  hall, and the main&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bank&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of CR cham=\r\nbers were \n  also picked up and carried away.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; The lower \n  floor of the base had a large metal slab to protect it from=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n  bombing, and as the water continued to pour over it, ev=\r\nerything on \n  the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upper&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; floors was ripped =\r\naway, leaving a \n  clean plate of metal sitting at the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bott=\r\nom&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of \n  the crater that was the base. The buildings along =\r\nthe center of \n  the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; town&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were a little stu=\r\nrdier and remained \n  standing, though heavily damaged. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n hanger and all the craft \n  in it were picked up and thrown into the \n  oc=\r\nean.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As the water came to tower it filled u=\r\np \n  the deep trench around the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; structure&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhen the \n  wall hit it, wrapping it entirely except for the top five&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt;&gt; \n  stories,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; damaging supports, breaking out all t=\r\nhe windows and \n  destroying the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bridges&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; th=\r\nat allowed access to \n  the tower. The wave then continued across the rest&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the \n  island, destroying buildings and carrying away th=\r\ne mass of \n  debris,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and then all was eerily \n  quiet.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV class=\r\n=3Dim&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQ=\r\nUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0035_01C9E5DB.A9040020--\r\n\n"}}
