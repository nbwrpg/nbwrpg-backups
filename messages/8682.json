I&#39;m just glad I held onto my loyalty, \nor he would&#39;ve killed everyone.\n\nWell, why you were fighting, I was running scans for pods. One just \nrecently crashed in North Dakota. It still has the ability to give \nrobotic forms. After we lock these three up, we have to go there.\n\nAll right. Finaly see what you look like.\n\nBrix/Octociz still looked ahead, watching the hunters for any sort of \nmove.\n\n\n"}}
