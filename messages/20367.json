Now go.\n&gt; Forward at a steady pace.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Zardus flies up to the section of the Alliance base that contained\n&gt; the cargo holds, a blast door sliding aside to let the Alliance\n&gt; leader enter. He walks down a hallway, heading for a particular\n&gt; storage room.\n&gt;\n&gt; The constant recent battles had showed that the Alliance was getting\n&gt; more and more enemies, and to counter they could use more troops, and\n&gt; Zardus had a soldier in mind.
