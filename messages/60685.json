He had never been able to see beyond risks, \n&gt; that =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; was why he was destined to fail at his overall purpose.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n &quot;We   will not stop it.  Because of this=85Neo Beast War the \n&gt; &gt; potentia=\r\nl pasts and presents are multiplying along with the \n&gt; future, \n&gt; &gt; but we =\r\nmust gain more destiny potential in order to control it.  \n&gt; &gt; Some present=\r\ns are shifting away, becoming obscure.  Thankfully \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; course of e=\r\nvents has provided us with an ample source of \n&gt; potential.  \n&gt; &gt; All actio=\r\nns in a past so distant are magnified in the present.  \nBy \n&gt; &gt; stealing th=\r\ne potential of even one bot who vaguely resembles a \n&gt; hero \n&gt; &gt; or villain=\r\n we could very well achieve the equivalent of \ndestroying \n&gt; &gt; Optimus Prim=\r\ne.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       &quot;Master, I volunteer for this service,&quot; said Ex.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;       &quot;No!&quot; cut in Deus, &quot;I-I mean in such a time period the \n&gt; &gt; destiny=\r\n energy could magnify the potential for the prophesy of \nour \n&gt; &gt; demise be=\r\ning fulfilled.

She will go, and she=\r\n will remember her prophesy `So long \nas \n&gt; &gt; you pay the Seer&#39;s price, no =\r\nTransmetal will take your life.&#39;  \nNow \n&gt; &gt; let us select the target we can=\r\n gain the most by destroying.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       Deus kissed her, and ran=\r\n his fingers through her hair.  &quot;I \n&gt; &gt; am yours,&quot; she said, &quot;what do you w=\r\nish me to do.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       &quot;Go to Earth.
