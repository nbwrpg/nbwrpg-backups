Suddenly it was\n&gt; hit by a shot of lighting. It went down. The protoform\n&gt; was surley doomed. But the clouds darkened as the\n&gt; spark refused to be extinquished.  Suddenly a miracle\n&gt; happened or a nightmare. The protoform stabalized in\n&gt; its protoform. It was stuck. It slithered across the\n&gt; ground. It went past a dead bot. (destructor.) It\n&gt; transformed and took his shape. It had no weapons. Its\n&gt; only power was to make sharp or heavy mettalic objects\n&gt; with all it&#39;s limbs. (If anyone has seen terminator 2.\n&gt; Its the same idea) He could not speak. But he would\n&gt; learn how to adapt thier voice soon enough. He walked\n&gt; amilesly. His past gone. His future uncertain. (Anyone\n&gt; who wants to recruit him....hurry up. Hopefuly megs.)\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
