She goes to Leo but with a bit of a seriou=\r\ns expression on her face. \n\n&quot; Leo, please, I think Elita might&#39;ve picked up=\r\n on your tone of voice.  We know how serious the situation is but try expla=\r\nining that to a little girl who misses her parents so much that it breaks h=\r\ner heart just at the mention of something as horrible as this.&quot;\n\nShe looks =\r\nup to him with a look of desperation.\n\n&quot; Please, try not ta send any negati=\r\nve statements if she&#39;s around?&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly bus=\r\ny. \n\nOn Sep 4, 2011, at 6:30 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Elita: Elita woke up and looking around said &quot;Where =\r\nis my mommie?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Straight Shot swallows hard.
