(I&#39;ll be bringing in a Maxi soon)\n\nThe Preds need a mechanic so Switchblade is joining.\n\n|---Megatron---|\n\nMegatron ignores his minions as they proceed to do as ordered. A \nnagging feeling tugs as his mind as he recalls the bots who decided \nto join his team. Of all the bots who showed up, only one hadn&#39;t \nmade his appearance yet, Switchblade.\n\nAs if on queue, two glowing green eyes shift position, and a dark \ngreen and black, 3.5 foot tall bot strolls in from one of the dimly \nlit corridors. Megatron&#39;s eyes narrow as the nonchalant bot makes \nhis way towards the Predacon leader. &quot;Switchblade...&quot; says Megatron.\n\n|---Switchblade---|\n\nSwitchblade hops over some debri, and lands himself right in from of \nMegatron, only to receive a devastating blow to the upper torso by \nfrom a irritated Megatron. &quot;I suppose I was asking for that, &#39;o \nmighty Megstron.&quot; He maintains a sarcastic tone, only partially \nmasking his respect and fear.\n\nGetting back up, he dusts himself off, and turns to face the \nleader. &quot;So, what needs to be done? I see that the ship was... \ndamaged... to say the least in the atmospheric entry. I&#39;m guessing \nthat Repairs are necessary...&quot; he sighs almost dejectedly, but perks \nup immediately.\n\nMegatron ignores the smaller bot&#39;s antics, &quot;Yes, repairs do need \ndoing. Your first task is to help Perceptor fix the scanners, and \nthen you can salvage the parts from the engine.&quot; \n\nSwitchblade nods. &quot;Alright.&quot;\n\nHe hops over to Perceptor, and punches the larger bot in the \nknee, &quot;Alright ya heap, what have ya done so far?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
