All you sorry sons a bitches! You ready to rock!?!?\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Hazel walks out of her room and near the entrance. She hears \n&gt;   Virgo&#39;s yelling and gasps. Her gasp was a gasp a glee and joy.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Hazel: Cerulean! Bronze! Come here!\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Cerulean and Bronze stop in the hall and walk up to Hazel.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Hazel: You guys, a fight!

Look at this.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Virgo laughs while pointing at Pink running towards her. Virgo \n&gt;   allows Pink&#39;s shots to hit. She trips Pink and catches her. She \n&gt;   brutally beats down at Pink with one fist and spins her around, \n&gt;   powerbombing her ontop of several sharp rocks. Virgo climbs to \nher \n&gt;   feet. Pink gasps, not able to breath form the shock and pain. She \n&gt;   squirms around, clutching at the rock impaled in her back. Hazel \n&gt;   stares at Virgo&#39;s cold smile. Hazel laughs some, at the same time \n&gt;   McGowan laughs.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Hazel: Go.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Brown begins running. Depp begins walking. Brown lets out a \nbattle \n&gt;   cry while Depp laughs some. Brown begins firing his gun at Depp \nas \n&gt;   they became dangerously close. Depp swings his sword. Brown \nstares in \n&gt;   horror as his hand drops to the ground. Depp raises a gun and \nshoots \n&gt;   Brown in the head. He collapses. McGowan raises a hand, signaling \nfor \n&gt;   Virgo and Depp to step back. They follow her orders and stand \nbeside \n&gt;   her. Birdbot and Papertron haven&#39;t attacked yet. They were \nwaiting \n&gt;   for Aerotaur, Nightlight and Trinity. Virgo was also waiting for \nthat \n&gt;   certain someone.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Virgo: Furry bitch furry bitch....Gonna be so frigging dead....\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Hazel, White and Periwinkle begin walking towards the \nattackers. \n&gt;   Birdbot&#39;s eyes change color. Then, without warning, he flies at \n&gt;   Hazel. She gasps and grabs White, pulling her in front of \nherself, \n&gt;   for protection. Birdbot digs his talons into White&#39;s chest. After \n&gt;   several cracks, his feet bust through White&#39;s back and start \ntrying \n&gt;   to grab Hazel, but can&#39;t reach. He rips his feet back out of \nWhite, \n&gt;   sending blood flying. Hazel blocks a fleet of shots from McGowan \nwith \n&gt;   White before dropping her. White stares, wide eyed. Her fingers \n&gt;   twitch as she lays on the ground. Hazel looks at McGowan, whose \nsmile \n&gt;   had brightened. Hazel runs back over to Cerulean, Bronze and \n&gt;   Periwinkle.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Hazel: Damn, their good. I&#39;ve got to admit that.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Hazel watches Lee and Barrymore brutally kick Pink and Brown \nwhile \n&gt;   a puddle of blood forms around White.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Bronze: Maybe I&#39;ll kick ass another day...\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Papertron: ERF FER FER FER!...\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Papertron flexes while Birdbot demands Doritos...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
