When I \n&gt; played this rpg there was never a council\n&gt; member(well it was yan then) who \n&gt; said dont post while im gone. So I apologize for\n&gt; continuing,  posting back in \n&gt; the day we just kept going and the person had to\n&gt; catch up. I think the \n&gt; council needs a little meeting to deal with all\n&gt; these problems. I really \n&gt; didn&#39;t give my characters a proper introduction\n&gt; either and for that im sorry \n&gt; I just felt it was a good way to further a story\n&gt; line. Such as Proto joining \n&gt; Megatron&#39;s ranks and The Rodimus Prime vs. Galvatron\n&gt; feud which I am really \n&gt; looking forward to.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
