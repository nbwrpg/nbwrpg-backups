He frowned.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No, I don&#39;t recognize him. One second, I&#39;ll check my logs.&quot; Cyndro\n&gt; said and the screen blanked out for a second, then Cyndro&#39;s face\n&gt; appeared again.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I have it recorded that he arrived just a little while ago. The\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire, which was the old base, doesn&#39;t have any logs on\n&gt; him either.&quot; Cyndro reported and then glanced at Waterworm. &quot;I think\n&gt; he&#39;s new here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then looked back at AzureBlade and Hugar. &quot;Iron Raptor and most of\n&gt; the other Maximals are training right now,&quot; he told them, &quot;but I can\n&gt; escort you inside into a waiting room and notify her.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cinder and Mist arrived at the exit to Maximal City and looked out at\n&gt; the bots outside. They saw that a monitor was talking to them, and\n&gt; knew that Cyndro had things under control.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Truttle nodded at Cledar&#39;s orders and remained by Rixer. He held his\n&gt; two machine guns ready just in case Iron Raptor decided to attack\n&gt; them where they were.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mantle, Aqua, and Rubble watched all the Maximals go into action to\n&gt; hunt down IR, and Aqua and Rubble looked at Mantle.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Any special plans?&quot; Rubble asked. Mantle looked around and frowned.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Not yet. Lets go that way and stick together. If we see her, me and\n&gt; Aqua will combine and chase after her.&quot; Was Mantle&#39;s reply to the\n&gt; question after several seconds of thinking it over, and the three set\n&gt; off down a hallway.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
