Hell Drak&#39;s eyes \nwere closed tight, waiting for death.  But nothing happened.  She \nopened her eyes.  Triggerhappy was hit, and fell to his knees, mouth \nwide open, shocked, and in pain.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You.....&quot; Triggerhappy stopped to gasped for air, &quot;Pile of.......&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Triggerhappy fell down on his face, so he was laying on the ground. \n Where his face was, a puddle of mechfluid appeared, and mechfluids \nstarted spilling from where he had been hit.  The punctures in his \nmetal started to turn into cracks, and mechfluid came out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Skullgrin, Jume, and Whee watched as Triggerhappy had been \nsupposedly defeated.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;NO!  MY DECEPTIPAL!&quot; Skullgrin shouted.\n&gt; \n&gt; Skullgrin transformed into Pretender mode, and had his massive, \nfreaky club.  He ran at AzureBlade and threw a lethal blow to \nAzureBlade&#39;s head.  Jume and Whee fired at AzureBlade.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No!  Watch out!&quot; Hell Drak yelled.\n&gt; \n&gt; A light came into her optics, and then she quickly got up and dove \nat AzureBlade, trying to take him down, but out of the way of \ndamage...\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Surgital suddenly felt something from Ice.  The mind thing.  Pain.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No........not this.......I thought I had forgot about this!&quot; \nSurgital said, but which Bodicon was saying it, nobody knew.\n&gt; \n&gt; Surgital didn&#39;t feel physical pain, but a flashback showed up, and \nwould be visible in the minds of both Ice and all the Bodicons.  It \nwas a flashback from Decapitron!  \n&gt; \n&gt; Flashback:  Decapitron was tied to a conveyer belt, with some sort \nof energon rope.  He was horrified, and was screaming for help.  Then, \nhe went forward, and a bunch of saws and stuff came down!  They \nstarted cutting at Decapitron.  All he could do was scream in sheer \npain.  Each saw blade had the Autobot symbol engraved on it.  \nDecapitron, still tied onto the conveyer belt, was now heading into a \nlarge box thing.  On the way, a heavy thing with an Autobot symbol \ncame down and sort of crushed Decapitron&#39;s head.  Then, Decapitron \nwent into the box thing, which also had an Autobot symbol, and then \nthe doors of the box shut, and then Decapitron was stuck, and he was \ngetting beaten and battered.  After the 10 minute torture process was \ndone in the box, Decapitron kept going.  Mechfluid and oil and stuff \nwere pouring like mad, and he was mangled and dislocated and stuff.  \nFinally, he was at the end, and was dumped off of the conveyer belt \nand onto the ground.  The last thing he had seen back then when that \nhappened, was Autobots around him, laughing sinisterly with evil eyes \nand faces.  \n&gt; *Flashback Ends*\n&gt; \n&gt; Surgital was still...\n\n\n"}}
