When our lungs fail can we not get \n&gt; artifical lungs built or be put on a machine that mimics the effect \n&gt; of &quot;breathing&quot;. So yes maybe they need to breathe but still there&#39;s \n&gt; no proof either for or against, to be honest, that the beast forms \n&gt; use organic bits.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways in the long run I don&#39;t think it really matters eh? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Not necesarily, jhogan.
