She would be the same if this was him instead of her. But \nthen again, she wouldn&#39;t wish this on a Pred.\nWell...maybe a Pred...\n\nIron Raptor turned her head back towards the direction of the Ark.\nHurry, that was what Prowl said...but she wondered if he could even hold on \ntight enough. Well...she could always find out.\nIt would be a long way too. There were a few gullies and fissures on the way \nthere, but they should make it by nightfall if she ran all the way.\nShe growled at Prowl, in a slight sarcastic tone.*\n\n&quot; I suppose you want peanuts and complimentory drinks on this express \ntransport as well...Sir?\n\n* Then breaking into an easy trot before a smooth jog. She would wait until \nhe was fully repaired before she ran out fully.*\n\nDesmonus:\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
