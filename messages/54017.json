Things like fear and love are beyond him other than in small \nquantities.  His free arm comes up automatically to block the sword - \nwhich promptly becomes lodged in it.  Between that pain and the \nemotional overload, the shark-bot is driven into the Jaws-like \nbehavior people would expect of his beast form.  With a roar, he \nlatches onto Dreadplague&#39;s throat with an iron grip, fairly well \nwrenching the sword out of the femme&#39;s hands and exacerbating his own \nwound.  He headbutts his antagonist, twisting the harpoon lodged in \nher body so that it starts tearing through her internal systems.\n\nNoir narrowly avoids the shards and retaliates with her blasters.  \nJayde proves to be an even harder target to pin down in vehicle mode \nthan as a robot, and scoots under Tyreal as he jumps.  Coming back \naround, she squeezes off an ion shot from behind.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dreadplague shrieks again of a cry scary enough to freeze even the\n&gt; most effective coolant.
