His own muscles bunched under strain as he readied \nhimself for impact and a strike if his own when, just then, another male bot \nmade the sceen.\nHe looked over towards FZ as he entered the area, not even noticing \nPerndabot stand down and Nue&#39;e nearly jump out of her armor. In fact, the \nstartled femm stumbled back and tripped over the large gustalt&#39;s foot, \nlanting on it with a thud.\nBiomass lifted a brow and watched FZ, who was this man anyway. He must be \nsome sort of higher authority to command Perndabot like that.\nWas he the commander?\nBut Nue&#39;e was the first to answer FZs question before any others.*\n\n&quot; A bunch of showing off.&quot;\n\n* She got to her feet, though still standing on the foot. She moved her \nglasses back up her face and looked at FZ. But then it was her turn to lift \na brow when amother femal came, some cat-bot (feline). She rolled her optics \nat the way that she stood and talked, shaking her head and wondering if all \nthe women on this planet acted like this and how it would be a shame if they \ndid.\nBiomass, on the other hand, hoped that ALL women were like this one when he \nsaw her. His eyes couldn&#39;t help but move down her body but what interest he \nhad he hid and then turned to look back at FZ.\nBut soon the woman had gone to do FZs bidding and that left them as they \nwere before, waiting for FZ to speak or something to happen.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
