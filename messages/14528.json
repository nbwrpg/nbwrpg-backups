It&#39;s because of school and\nmy\n&gt; dad working out of home and he hogs the comp. But he goes back to the\noffice\n&gt; on Monday probably so I should get the computer at nights.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois heard Windrazor&#39;s comment.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There&#39;s a good chance we took a wrong turn, but I&#39;m pretty sure we went\nthe\n&gt; right way. I remember these nooks. But if we took the wrong way, we&#39;re\n&gt; doomed.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois left that thought to sink in.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Fliq/Brix\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Cybertron?&quot;Fliq said,&quot; I...I don&#39;t really know It&#39;s been years since I\nsaw\n&gt; it. Let me just tell you it&#39;s nothing like earth. No water, no plants\n&gt; no...no life! All metalic creatures, who either have no transformations or\n&gt; like jets and other equipment. There&#39;s very tall buildings and and busy\n&gt; streets. I remember....there was this one building, I think it was a\nweapon\n&gt; manufacturer. My friends and I would sneak in, being the kids we were, and\n&gt; looking at the weapons. We were eventually caught, and beaten by our\n&gt; parents. But it was worth it. I&#39;ll tell ya...it&#39;s like no place any where\n&gt; else in the world. And I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever see it again, because it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have an orbit. It drifts wildly through space. It&#39;s probably\n&gt; millions of miles from where I last saw it. Ah, but Earth is like no place\n&gt; in the universe either, with it&#39;s lushes life. And this is where we are\n&gt; needed. I know that some people don&#39;t believe in destiny, but I think\n&gt; everything I&#39;ve done was to prepare me for this war. This wasn&#39;t the plan.\n&gt; All 10 of us would come, and with the extra power we would easily defeat\nthe\n&gt; Preds. But it wasn&#39;t to be.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Fliq sat quiet thinking about how he got to this point in his life, until\n&gt; Brix came in.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hey guys! I found the tools, so let&#39;s get working. Oh, and their was this\n&gt; weird sound following me everywhere, but it&#39;s gone now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix distributed the tools and started removing the hull.&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream watched Testifyer just walk off and give him a dirty look.\nAlmost\n&gt; as soon as he got outside a fight broke out. Starscream fixed a problem\nwith\n&gt; the structure and than went outside and saw Testifyer.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You...you hurt KitKat, and than walk away from me? NO ONE WALKS AWAY FROM\n&gt; ME! And stop attacking this cave. I am Starscream of the Predacons, and\nthis\n&gt; is our castle. As it will soon be OUR WORLD! JET MODE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream went to Jet Mode and and charged Testifyer head on with lasers\n&gt; firing 10 shots.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Gotron\n&gt;\n&gt; Gotron follows the Alliance Army headed for the fight.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Good!
