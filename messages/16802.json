I have a mission for you,&quot; he says, &quot;Are you in good enough \ncondition to do some killing?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA surge of electricity went through the bot that used to be Striker as Blaze \nflipped the switch. His optic sensors activated, the cealing coming into \nfocus. Running through his data-tracks, the bot found out as much as it could \nabout himself.\n\nHis name was Slayer. He was a ruthless killer, superior to all but his \nmaster, Prebon. Slayer slowly sat up, his head turning to look all the bots \nover. Inferior, Slayer thought as he scanned every face in the room, untill \nhe came to Prebon&#39;s.\n\nSlowly, Slayer got off the table, standing up on the floor next to it. He \nlooked at Prebon, hardly bothering to pay any attention to the other bots.\n\n&quot;Master,&quot; Slayer said, bowing his head to Prebon.\n\n"}}
