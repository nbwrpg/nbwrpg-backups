I want you to hold a gun to my head and tell \nthem that you will shoot me unless they let them go.  Then we all \nleave and go to the Allience base.\n\n::Battera::\nShe decided that she had more of an advantage in the air than on the \nground.  She opened ehr link to Zardus,&quot;I have to return to the base \nfor repairs.  I shall rejoin you shortly.&quot;  She Transformed into bat \nmode and flew off towards the alliance base.  She flew as hard as she \ncould.  By the time she got to the base, her wing was torn and so \nbadly damages that she her wing was almost shredded.  She walked \ninside and went to the CR room and stepped into a chamber to heal.\n\nKitKat::\nShe looked at Drillbit.  &quot;I am tired and would like to sleep for a \nbit. Please wake me when the others arrive.&quot;\nShe walked back into the CR chamber and fell asleep inside the \nchamber.\n\n::Spears::\nShe was placed inside the chamber and cried in pain as she slowly \nhealed.\n\nGoldenEye::\nShe nodded to Dollen, &quot;Yes, let&#39;s rejoin the others.&quot;\n\nShadow Wing::\nShe prayed to the matrix that she would live long enough to see \nLunarpine again.\n\nSquizzy::\nStill inside the Allience CR chamber as Dark One left her.\n\n\n\n"}}
