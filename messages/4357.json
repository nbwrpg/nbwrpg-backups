She shook her head.\n&quot;Not a snowballs chance in an inferno. Not him or anybot for that matter.&quot;\nShe just finished the computaions for the hatch.  She went and fixed up an \nold door brought over from the ship and made it fit the hatch way.  Next she \nused a crane to hold up the door while she welded it to it&#39;s hinges and \nfinished the job by putting foleage on and around the door.  No one would be \nable to spot it as an escape tunnel from the outside.  It was completely \ncamoflaged.  She was proud of her work on this.\nShe opened up a commlink to Megatron.\n\n&quot;Commander, I have finished one tunnel and it&#39;s entrance.  I shall start on \nthe other shortly.&quot;\nShe went back inside and went to her computer and looked at her notes for \nanother tunnel.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
