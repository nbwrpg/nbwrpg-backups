NOOO!\n\n*takes a step back, tripping over a chair, falling off a 200 story building, \nand dying*\n\nHa, now you have to do the update!\n\nJust kidding. If case anyone&#39;s wondering why I havn&#39;t been updating, it \nbecause of school (it all goes back to that, doesn&#39;t it?). I have very little \ntime at home where I used to have the site on my comp  (I&#39;d edit it and \nupload it to tripod), so it was either that or RPGing. And, being a selfish \nSOB, I chose RPGing :-)\n\nAnyways, I&#39;ve been planning to scrapp the site and make a new one for a long \ntime now, and recently, I&#39;ve been kinda forced into starting it. My web site \ncomp crashed (as in no data on hard drive), while I was remaking it into a \nweb server, so I&#39;m working on a new site now. Its looks better (thanx to \nLogo&#39;s suggestions), and will be up as soon as I get the CGI script for the \njoin form and my web server working, and as soon as I finally get Sprint \nBroadband and have a stable enough connection to support a web server.\n\n::Zardus/Bloodystrike/Reptilica/Havoc/Repressor/DevilDuer::\n\nZardus fires a few shots at Stronghold, turning his head as his wrist \ncomputer beeps, reporting someone trying to access classified information. \nEasilly dodging Jetsotrorm&#39;s shots and tapping a few buttons, he orders the \nAlliance base&#39;s computer to disallow any access to any classified info, and \nto keep a close log.\n\nTurning back to the battle, he fires again at Stronghold, gliding in to land \non the ground.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike fires at one of the missiles heading for him, making it explode. \nThe explosion covers him with flame, the Alliance bot gritting his teeth in \npain.\n\nHe looks arond as the flames clear, seeing Sharpedge carry Jetstorm to a CR. \nHe flies forward, flying up to the Mafia base and looking through a hole, \nReptilica flying up near him.\n\n&quot;Shall we blow the CR chambers?&quot; Bloodystrike asks, the other nodding and \nsuddenly flying back as an autogun shot hits him. He flies forward again, the \ntwo dodging autogun fire as they attempt to enter the base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDiving again for another attack, Havoc drops two bombs at Stronghold and \nBlender, firing at Rizopas with his machine guns.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer raises an eyebrow plate as Diamond wakes up, asks her questions, \nand faints again. He changes course to the lab, figuring that he might as \nwell launch a reprogramming programm while she was unconscious.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; the rather small bot says to the unconscious femm, &quot;I&#39;m DevilDuer, an \nAlliance bot. One of the best, ya know. I rescued ya from your ship, which \ncrashed almost right on this base! This is the Alliance base, and the \nAlliance is led by Zardus. I&#39;m real high in th&#39; ranks, though, so stickin&#39; by \nme could do ya good.&quot;\n\n"}}
