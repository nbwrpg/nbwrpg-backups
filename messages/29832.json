The \nsuit was useless because of its damage anyways, and would just make \nhim slower.\n\n&quot;Allright, lets get going.&quot;\n\nHe flies out of the entrance, heading for the Maximal base.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ignatius snapped a new energizer to his talons. He knew that it \nwould take\n&gt; as much power as he had to take on the Maximal army. Afterwards he \npulled\n&gt; the mirror sensers and checked each one thoroughly. In a short time \nIgnatius\n&gt; stood poised for battle. At his side was a pack containing extra \nenergy\n&gt; units, the mirror sensers, and the explosives needed to blow up the \nridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m set, let&#39;s move.&quot; Ignatius prided himself on his thorough \nattitude, he\n&gt; had the land memorized, the mirror sensers adjusted, and a full \npower unit\n&gt; in his weapons, he was ready for anything.\n\n\n"}}
