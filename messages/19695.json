He knew that \nnewly formed protoforms tended to have a feral aspect about them. It \nwas to his advantage to let her out and see what she was capable \nof. &quot;Alright, you can go out but stay close I don&#39;t want you having \nany problems with your new form.&quot; he led her to the door and let her \nout. It was later in the day than he was used to. He needed some \nrest. he couldn&#39;t rest though, not with Shadow Wing still adjusting. \nHe had to be awake in case anything happened to her.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at Veratis.  She was taller than him. She looked at \n&gt; herself and wondered how this could have happened.  She tested her \n&gt; wings and started to lift herself off the floor. She stopped and \nset \n&gt; back down. She looked at Veratis. &quot;Can we go and test it out now. I \n&gt; want to know all I can about this form. This is something that I \nhave \n&gt; never experienced before.&quot;  Then she felt something else move \ninside, \n&gt; but it wasn&#39;t wires. She was hungry. &quot;And I need to hunt, soon, \nvery \n&gt; soon.&quot; She  moved her head closer to Veratis and sniffed his \nscent.  \n&gt; He smelled different, alive.

He heard her \n&gt; speak \n&gt; &gt; so he knew her transformation was successfull.

He scanned her entire body, it was healthy whatever she \nwas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know what you did to change the dna sequencing but \nsomehow \n&gt; &gt; your owl form showed up.&quot; His mind was filled with a thousand \n&gt; &gt; questions but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to ask them all. &quot;Just \nrest \n&gt; &gt; for now and when you&#39;re 100 percent we&#39;ll go outside and try out \n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; new form.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She looked down and sighed heavily.

She wondered if he would still be happy to see her in her \n&gt; new \n&gt; &gt; &gt; form. She looked at Veratis. &quot;Yes, I understand. What am I \n&gt; supposed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to do now?
