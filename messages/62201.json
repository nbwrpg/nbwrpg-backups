I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t come to that, but could you?&quot;  He prepared himself for a blow, it was going to hurt, but it never hurt to have back up plans, so this could be okay, provided she didn&#39;t over react.\nBlacknightmare: The femme slaped him again and  shout &quot;I DON&#39;T RISK MY SKIN TO SHARE YOUR LOVE FOR ANYONE ELSE!!!

Oh well, I just hope she can cooperate.  Wolfblade can be unrealistically pushy.&quot;  He thought about catching up, but she&#39;d probably give him an audio full about suggesting such a thing.

Besides, she&#39;s not a model Maximal anyway, one might mistake her for a minion if you didn&#39;t know any better.  You&#39;ll be alright, I&#39;ll be alright, everything will be fine, I promise you.&quot;\n Blacknightmare: the femme still was annoyed and jealous.\nMalice:  &quot;I hate it when you aren&#39;t happy.

If you could escape unicron, you are strong enough to work this out.  you&#39;ll be alright, don&#39;t worry about it.  It won&#39;t hurt at all, you just need to give it a try.  But we have to try everything else first.  I would hate for either of you to die before me.
