Logic dictates that I get them to the nearest CR \nchamber. If that CR chamber is in hostile hands then it&#39;s up to me to \nmake the situation acceptable. The loss of a leader based on \nindecision is NOT acceptable. So unless you happen to be a qualified \nfield tech, I&#39;ll thank you to take Dollen toyour HQ and I&#39;ll have \nKitKat meet you there when she&#39;s capable.&quot; Phobia knew that diplomacy \nwas overrated when both diplomats carried weapons thats why the \nPredacon army had so few qualified leaders. If possible he didn&#39;t \nwant to lose command the way so many others had, holes in his frame \ndidn&#39;t fit in with his sense of fashion.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; I just talked to Inferno731, and he says that whoever wants Inferno \n&gt; and Rampage could email him, and he&#39;ll will the chars to one of \nthem.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Reptilica::\n&gt; \n&gt; Reptilica nods at Phobia&#39;s decition. It was good enough for him, at \n&gt; least they were getting somewhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But hey,&quot; he says, walking up to Phobia, &quot;The Predacon ship is \nnear \n&gt; by, but its owned by Rampage. I think he&#39;s hostile to all the other \n&gt; Preds, but I&#39;m not sure. The other Predacon base is waaay down on \nthe \n&gt; south of the continent. The Alliance base is much closer than that.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
