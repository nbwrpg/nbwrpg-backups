He radios quickly to Lord Elder.\n\n=\r\n&quot;Lord Elder, the Ark is registering Perceptor as an enemy, I need time to h=\r\nelp him attain the Maximal/Autobot signature so that way harm can be avoide=\r\nd, over.&quot;\n\nHe stops just before getting to the Ark.  He knew that if he adv=\r\nanced now, he could endanger his new found comrade and Talon as well.\n\nIn t=\r\nhe Ark, Rat Trap quickly mans the computer as his fingers tap feverishly on=\r\n the keyboard.\n\n&quot;Aww Slag, if we don&#39;t change Perceptor&#39;s signature Wheels =\r\nwill also be a gonner!  Lord Elder, I can do this, I&#39;ve done it before!  Ju=\r\nst say the word and it&#39;s done.  This is Rat Trap ta Wheels and Perceptor, O=\r\nver, better stay where you are for now, I know I can convert Perceptor&#39;s si=\r\ngnature but I&#39;m gonna need some time ta do that, and of course, permission =\r\nta access his signature files. Once that&#39;s done, it&#39;ll only take a few minu=\r\ntes ta change it.&quot;\n\nTucson replies.\n\n&quot;Noted, I&#39;ll wait here.  Thank you Rat=\r\n Trap.&quot;\n\nQuickstride takes some time to reflect the condition of Rodimus, t=\r\no the others.  He sighs.\n\n&quot; Well, judging by the way those insects drained =\r\nhis energy, he&#39;s gonna need one heck of a jump start after that.  And I dun=\r\nno if this is true, just a hunch I&#39;m gettn&#39;, but I think Tucson Prime&#39;s got=\r\n enough in his power core ta give Rodimus Prime the jump start he needs.  I=\r\n know that&#39;s what he&#39;d wanna do.  All that power and strength..  He doesn&#39;t=\r\n wanna just keep that to himself, I fully believe that Tucson would rather =\r\nsave someone else than save himself. We saw that taday, when we were in tha=\r\nt tunnel. He could&#39;ve just left Rodimus down there, but he risked his spark=\r\n ta go back down and attempt a rescue.  And then when we were all leaving, =\r\nhe chose ta come up last, and waited until everyone else was safe. There&#39;s =\r\nsomething inside him that is a little bit different than Optimus..  Just a =\r\nlittle bit, not much. It&#39;s one of those things you can&#39;t put your finger on=\r\n.&quot;  \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The trip to the Ark was largely uneventful and relatively short.=\r\n As\n&gt; they moved across the broken terrain they drove past were it looked a=\r\ns\n&gt; if a massive battle of some sort had taken place some time ago. This\n&gt; =\r\nis obviously were the minions had made their attack on the Ark several\n&gt; mo=\r\nnths ago. Only now was the scorched ground begining to heal as weeds\n&gt; and =\r\ndifferent wild grasses were begining to peak out from beneath the\n&gt; rocky g=\r\nrounds.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Ark is as Tuscon and the rest left it. Even for Perceptor,=\r\n the Ark\n&gt; has not changed appreciatively since the last scans he had recie=\r\nved\n&gt; from it. A broken ship lying partial entoumbed in the side of a mid\n&gt;=\r\n sized mountain.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Tuscon and those that were with him approached the=\r\n Ark the Ark\n&gt; computer voice could be heard, &quot;Predacon signature detected.=\r\n&quot; The Ark\n&gt; shields snapped into place as the base went on alert and weapon=\r\ns began\n&gt; to target Tuscon . . . or perhaps someone he&#39;s carrying.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TA=\r\nG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
