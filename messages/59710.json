Hearing the\ncomotion, he reached through the matrix to all the\nsparks of those in the midst of it, sending\nreinforcing thoughts of &#39;hang in there&#39; to Kitkat\nwhile she was in the CR Chamber, comforting and\nreassuring thoughts to Camoflage that she wasn&#39;t going\nto be in trouble. He then turned to Blackfang.\n\n&quot;Seems like a little friend of yours and you are also\nin for a reunion. Incidentally I&#39;m pretty sure you\nmight wanna go easy on the kid.&quot; he said smiling\ncalmly. Then sensing Wolfblade&#39;s thoughts, he spoke\nthrough the matrix directly spaark to spark &quot;You know,\nsometimes, the battlefield gets put on the kids. At\ntimes as a parent you worry, but the funny thing is,\nthey turn out ok. I mean, look at Rattrap- the kid was\nsweet and innocent-&quot; Shadowcaster cut himself off in a\nchuckle beforee resuming &quot;Ok, so he&#39;s not so sweet and\ninnocent as he was as a kid, but the fact is that he&#39;s\nturned out to be one of the Maximals&#39; finest spies and\nsoldiers, and I couldn&#39;t be more proud of him.&quot;\n\nAt this, his thoughts turned to his son. When Primus\nressurected him as guardian of his children, he&#39;d\naccepted the task without hesitation, nor knowing the\ntime period nor place he&#39;d be sent to.  He never in\nhis wildest dreams imagined he&#39;d be arriving after his\ndeath, nor he&#39;d get to do something most parents can\nonly dream of- get another chance with their children.\n\n--- airly2000 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote: \n---------------------------------\nWindlord:\n\nWindlord smiled when the little one huged him and he\nhuged her &quot;I \nmissed you too, little one&quot;said with a wide\nsmile&quot;BlackFang is \naround there... perhaps..
