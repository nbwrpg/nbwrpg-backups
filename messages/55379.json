They didn&#39;t go to the same \nplace were my mommy and daddy are did they? If hey did, then I should \ntake care of the baby. I&#39;m a big bot now. So I can do stuff like \nthat.&quot;\n\nBattera:;\nShe looked down at the small child carrying the baby. She sighed and \nremembered her younger days. &quot;You must be a very big bot in order to \ntake care of  child like that. I am impressed. You seem to be doing a \nvery good job there.&quot;\n\nCam:  \nShe smiled at Battera&#39;s words and puffed up her small chest a bit. &quot;I \nam a big bot huh?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: hehehehe, Dirty diapers...
