A look of\n&gt; &gt; sheer determi=\r\nnation floods his face.

In the midsts\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; of the wave, he picks up a blip. He detects the intruder inside, and with=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that wave, pinpoints his location. Yet, he wasn&#39;t about to tell anyone=\r\n what\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;d be up to next. With transmission still underway, he approach=\r\nes the ark\n&gt; &gt; calmly, with an alert stride to his walk. The only one who w=\r\nould know what\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;d be up to, would be Legacy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Legacy,=\r\n my sonar systems have picked up the intruder. I know of his\n&gt; &gt; location a=\r\nnd I&#39;m very sure I can keep up with him, if I continue to\n&gt; &gt; transmit. Can=\r\n you give me access into the Ark at this time?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;One moment.&quot; Legacy replied over the radio to Tuscon, and then the fron=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; door to the Ark began to slowly slide open. &quot;You should have complete=\r\n access\n&gt; &gt; to the Ark, as does everyone else.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Tuscon moved=\r\n forward though low energy reserve alarm signals began to\n&gt; &gt; go off in Tus=\r\non&#39;s head. His wounds, his own energy loss over his trip back\n&gt; &gt; finally b=\r\neginning to catch up with him. While his wounds were bound so he\n&gt; &gt; leaked=\r\n no further energy, he had yet to get to a recharging chamber, and the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntremendous amounts of energy that he was putting out to maintain his wave\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; was further depleting his already low energy reserves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Owww..

Unless=\r\n of course, Legacy can\n&gt; &gt; rig up an amplifier within the Ark to supplement=\r\n my sonar attack.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;=\r\nll ask. Legacy, this is Straight Shot, I&#39;m asking a favor on Tucsons\n&gt; &gt; be=\r\nhalf. His waves are strong enough to pick up enemy forces in wide range,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; but he wants to take it up a notch and see if he can immobilize them at a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; further range. Kind of put them in a stall for now. Can you set up an\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; amplifier signal to merge with Tucson&#39;s sonar system? It would be great=\r\nly\n&gt; &gt; appreciated.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy&#39;s cold voice can =\r\nbe heard over Tuscon&#39;s radio, &quot;Many of the Ark&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; systems are also being=\r\n affected by the wave you are transmitting.

Blackrazor has an active shield that was disrupted by\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon&#39;s =\r\nwave. The Sweep&#39;s stealth is of a different sort and at the moment\n&gt; &gt; is u=\r\nnaffected by it. However that is water under the bridge with unfolding\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nevents :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As the Maximals creep forward in an =\r\nattempt to locate the Predacons,\n&gt; &gt; Hydras chooses this moment to attack!!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ATTACK THE MAXIMALS!!!!!&quot;Hydras yelled &quot;dont touch the ark =\r\nbut ATTACK\n&gt; &gt; THE MAXIMALS!!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Six sweeps fly into th=\r\ne air, followed by their leader Scourge! As soon as\n&gt; &gt; they leave the vici=\r\nnity of Hydras, the Predacon leader looses the advantage\n&gt; &gt; of their steal=\r\nth and immediately begins showing up on Maximal radar screens!\n&gt; &gt; However =\r\nthe sweeps still maintain their stealth, and only those who can\n&gt; &gt; physica=\r\nlly see them are aware of them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With a viciousness all their ow=\r\nn, they begin to open fire on the\n&gt; &gt; Maximals!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tuscon receives=\r\n a call from Legacy, &quot;Tuscon, I am receiving readings of a\n&gt; &gt; single Preda=\r\ncon in your area, his IFF signal identifying him as Hydras.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Although t=\r\nhere was a certain level of urgency in his voice, Legacy was still\n&gt; &gt; calm=\r\n and reserved as he made his tranmission.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Back insi=\r\nde the Ark the intruder frowned as he realized that his bomb had\n&gt; &gt; not go=\r\nne off. With a whispered curse he continued to try to adapt his\n&gt; &gt; stealth=\r\n shielding to Tuscon&#39;s wave. With a worried look he began to run down\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe hall, if he couldn&#39;t sneak out, he would BLAST his way out!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n(TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
