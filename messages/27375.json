She \nmade a mental note not to be so snappy next time.\n\n&quot;There you go,&quot; she said in a friendly tone, &quot;Thanks for warning me \nabout him. It was a possibility that I might not have known.&quot;\n\nShe looked up at him as he moved back and stood up, a bit surprised \nat how tall he was now. Fenox smiled.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m always careful,&quot; she said, giving him a small pat on his side \nand then walking out the door. She walked up to Vlad.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that,&quot; she said to him, &quot;He got a bit worked up \nabout something.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * D was glad the Fenox knew to look out for Vlad, it was a relief.\n&gt; He was starting to feel better and not feel too bad about her tone \nof voice, \n&gt; his ears moving in different directions now and they weren&#39;t flat \nagainst \n&gt; his head.\n&gt; But he relaxed when she scratched behind his ears, thinking that it \nfelt \n&gt; close to heaven. And it did.\n&gt; He leaned against her a bit, just liking the feeling.\n&gt; He remembered that the people who he grew up with did this too, but \nthey \n&gt; were a bit far in his mind and he was gunna dwell on the scratching \nfor now.\n&gt; D let out a deep sigh and then shock himself, stepping back a bit \nbefore \n&gt; rising onto his hind legs (looks like a warewolf.) He looked down \nat Fenox, \n&gt; who was now shorter then his shoulders but taller then his waist.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Be careful.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * He said in his smoth voice, then looking at the door to the room. \nA sign \n&gt; that it was time Fenox left and checked up on Vlad. God knew what \nhe was up \n&gt; to out there.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
