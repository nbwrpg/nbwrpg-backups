He had to get into the base. He\n&gt; then turns to the right and starts to run into zig-zag.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sniper grabs his com link. &quot;Iron Raptor, Get your ass out here and\n&gt; bring prowl or who ever you can get out here too, We are under attack\n&gt; and only 2 or 3 can continue fight the rest need cr chambers, fast.&quot;\n&gt; Sniper tokk out his rocket launcher and set his rifle to rapid fire.\n&gt; he fired 20 shoots form his rifle at anubis. He fires to rockets at\n&gt; sixshot. Sniper looked up and saw Rain clouds, &quot;That will make it a\n&gt; little darker so it might help.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; $60 in FREE Long Distance!
