Thousands of\n&gt;=\r\n acres all around with trees reaching up over one hundred feet into the\n&gt; a=\r\nir like tall green spires reaching ever higher into the skies,\n&gt; supported =\r\nby thick powerful trunks and supporting power of the\n&gt; neighboring trees.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; At first travel was easy as WHEELIE followed a trail of devastation\n&gt; a=\r\nnd deforestation. It was as if a stampede of hundreds of large\n&gt; animals fl=\r\ned the jungle, crashing into trees and stripping foliage as\n&gt; they traveled=\r\n. The result of which was a wide open and relatively\n&gt; smooth open path of =\r\ntravel several miles into the immense wooded area.\n&gt; But as time passed and=\r\n the miles built upon themselves the impact of\n&gt; the animal&#39;s passing becom=\r\ne less and less noticeable, the area itself\n&gt; becoming ever darker from the=\r\n trees high over head and the thick\n&gt; growth of brush. The ground was becom=\r\ning more and more uneven as tree\n&gt; roots grew into the pathway. What was on=\r\nce a brightly lit area was now\n&gt; much darker, looking like deep evening, ev=\r\nen though the noonday sun\n&gt; burned brightly over head, blocked by thge lush=\r\n canopy of trees, that\n&gt; only occasionally let in shafts of sunlight light =\r\nto break open the\n&gt; growing darkness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even the smell of things was beg=\r\ninning to change. The earth smell of\n&gt; decomposing leaves and animal waste =\r\ncould be smelled. Not necessarily\n&gt; a bad smell, but one that reminded you =\r\nof the richness of the soil\n&gt; that was being moved across.\n&gt; \n&gt; WHEELIE emp=\r\nloying all the skills and experience at his disposal was\n&gt; able to make his=\r\n way in through the uneven and sometimes broken\n&gt; ground, the jungle floor =\r\nwas perhaps among the most inhospitable to\n&gt; wheeled vehicles that most of =\r\nthe Earth at this time had to offer.\n&gt; Lattice works of roots and foliage g=\r\not caught in tires, the brush\n&gt; having the annoying habit of blocking sight=\r\n and hiding nasty ravines\n&gt; and holes and twisted turns. Branches and roots=\r\n jutted out at strange\n&gt; angles threatening to stab into more sensative and=\r\n vulnerable\n&gt; undersides and tires.\n&gt; \n&gt; The sounds of the jungle was all a=\r\nround WHEELIE, animals chattered at\n&gt; him from the ground, as others hangin=\r\ng high in the trees looked down\n&gt; at the strange orange conveyance that dar=\r\ned travel through demesne.\n&gt; There were signs of life all around him - The =\r\ncatcalls of other\n&gt; animals, even a few roars in the distance of large pred=\r\natory beasts.\n&gt; Trees and branches moved strangely as if something indiscer=\r\nnible was\n&gt; moving among them even if the author of the movement could not =\r\nitself\n&gt; be readily seen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then there was the eerie feeling of being wa=\r\ntched. It was a feeling\n&gt; that settled upon someone slowly at first. Perhap=\r\ns a sound that didn&#39;t\n&gt; repeat itself or a movement than stopped when you d=\r\nid. Maybe it was\n&gt; just a gut feeling that somewhere out in the density of =\r\nthe foliage,\n&gt; in the darkest shadows something was out there, and it was p=\r\neering at\n&gt; you, considering you.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was into this maze of tree and wo=\r\nod, sounds and smells that WHEELIE\n&gt; was driving, covered in muck and weavi=\r\nng past trees that were as large\n&gt; around as he was long. And yet despite a=\r\nll of that, there was a\n&gt; strange sort of barely discernable path that led =\r\nfurther and further\n&gt; into the jungle interior, meandering at times and yet=\r\n always present.\n&gt; .\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: For anyone that wants to fly in, you will fi=\r\nnd that you cannot\n&gt; see the jungle floor, at least the section that Wheeli=\r\ne is in. You can\n&gt; see the devastation that he followed in, but after a few=\r\n miles it\n&gt; fades and the jungle growth takes over. Any smells or sounds he=\r\n would\n&gt; give off would be muffled by the dense foliage and the ambient sou=\r\nnds\n&gt; and smells of the jungle. In short he would be nearly impossible to\n&gt;=\r\n find anyone on the forest floor from the air unless you find one of\n&gt; the =\r\ninfrequent clearings. If you need a more aerial description of the\n&gt; place =\r\nI can describe that in a different post. Just let me know\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELI=\r\nE&gt;\n\nWHEELIE tracked over the traces of destruction.  He kept his communicat=\r\nor on, but set to receive only rather than broadcast.  But for those back a=\r\nt base, he could probably be tracked over by his signal as it went deeper i=\r\nnto the jungle, but his intenrla comm was set on minimal power.\n\nAs he trac=\r\nked the traces of destruction, and then going back into the underbrush as i=\r\nt petered out, caked over in mud to try and help minimize his signal, his b=\r\nright orange coloration muted to the point he would not stand out as much.\n=\r\n\nAs the destruction petered out, WHEELIE would think it was recent, but it =\r\nonly went out to this area, fresh and then had ended for whatever point.  W=\r\nhile WHEELIE was not a tracker, nor did he have enhanced senses, he did hav=\r\ne experience with observation.  So, to these skills he would try and learn =\r\nto note that which was foreign to the jungle.  To attempt to locate as best=\r\n he could the signs of larger beasts which were not native to the area and =\r\nwoudl be Cybertronian beast modes that were not natural, heavier and bulkie=\r\nr.  IF he could, he would attempt to start trailing them by foot.  Failing =\r\nthe ability to locate any, he would continue moving in the general trail th=\r\nat the direction had last pointed in, going slowly and attempting to attune=\r\n himself to the background.\n\nWHEELIE sened within his spark that something =\r\nwas watching him, someone was after him.  But he could not locate it aginst=\r\n the heavy background of the underbrush.  He could not tell whether it was =\r\nthe animal life irritated at the invasion fo their territory, a hidden beas=\r\nt waiting to pounce, or a Cybertronian more adept at tracking than he was s=\r\ntaying hidden and stealthed and following him.  Or merely his own hesitatio=\r\nn and unfamiliarity with the area and his awareness of his own lack of awar=\r\neness at the region speaking to him to keep him on his wheels.\n\nNot having =\r\na more explicit idea fo what was going on, Wheelie gingerly continued, one =\r\nstep at a time, going slowly and warily.  Keeping his energon slingshot in =\r\na subspace pocket but fully charged, so should it come over to combat he co=\r\nuld immediately whip it out to engage someone, and keeping enough space bet=\r\nween himself and the underbrush if he was ambushed he would have some room =\r\nto react.\n\n\n\n"}}
