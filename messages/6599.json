He was actually enjoying this long range \ntrip. He was cold, but that was all. He still had his air superiority. He \nwas almost past the last marker that strange little Fuzor gave him. And \nafter that, he would find Rowdy Wolf.\n\nKnowing he said he would fire on him didn&#39;t make him feel safe, but he was \nquite a marksman himself. He was fast and skilled.\n\nHe had a feeling that he was being followed. He turned his head, seeing only \na small dot on the ground. He used his scanners to find out who it was, and \nfound out that it was only KitKat, one of the Predacons.\n\nHe opened his comm-link to her. &quot;What are you doing out here? Did somebody \nsend you?&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
