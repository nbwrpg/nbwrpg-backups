He still coul=\r\nd move swiftly and dexterously, thanks to his ninjabot training.  If ever a=\r\n time where it was needed it was now.  He looks around quickly and notices =\r\nthat a formation of old metal debris lying on rubble resembles a teeter tot=\r\ner lever. which he knew he could use as a vaulting platform. It would just =\r\ntake a second individual to step on the other end to send him upward for hi=\r\ns maneuver.  He points to it.\n\n&quot; See that?  It resembles a catapoult lever.=\r\n  One individual stands on one end, while the other jumps on the other end =\r\nto send the first individual airbourne.  From there, I&#39;m sure I can make it=\r\n to the bed. It&#39;s an old Ninjabot trick I learned during training.  And if =\r\nI play my cards right, it&#39;ll be a maneuver they don&#39;t see comming.&quot;\n\nWith t=\r\nhat he draws his sword, keeping an eye on the insects.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nTucson keeps firing as he continues to back up Vestige with all his dedicat=\r\nion. He finds that physical fire isn&#39;t much good against the insects but wh=\r\nen he did excercise spiritual power, it seemed to help Vestige and himself =\r\nimmensely. He thinks for a moment and looks to Vestige.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Vestige, o=\r\nur power lies in something that these insects do not have. Our hearts. The =\r\nsimplest power of all, one that all living creatures are capable of express=\r\ning, and the one ability that these creatures do not possess. We must use t=\r\nhat power now if we&#39;re going to vanquish our enemy and get Rodimus back. it=\r\n will unite all three of us, and only then, can we defeat this foe.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; His chest now pulsating as it had before, with the force of a beating hea=\r\nrt filled with compassionate power. Several plates on his chest shift, as a=\r\n well protected heart like structure beats luminously. He looks to Vestige.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Our compassion for each other, our loyalty to our comrades, our =\r\nlove for our fellow Autobots. That is the one power that can never be extin=\r\nguished. You believe in that power, reach down, touch it, and allow yoursel=\r\nf to allow it to flow freely within you. It will light all flames as it has=\r\n for centuries. We can do this Vestige, we can do this. For Rodimus Prime, =\r\nour hearts are with him, as his is with us. Let&#39;s unite them and end this o=\r\nnce and for all.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vestige was, like Tuscon, firing to keep =\r\noff these undoubteldy much\n&gt; stronger insectoid creatures. Laser beams and =\r\nminiature missiles were\n&gt; flying throuygh the air in an effort to keep the =\r\ncreatures at bay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile the creatures continued to approach, doing=\r\n thier best to\n&gt; push through hail of weapons fire that came from the belea=\r\ngered\n&gt; Autobots, however they did not appear to be faring well under the\n&gt;=\r\n onslaught from Tuscon and Vestige!\n&gt; \n&gt; However it was at this time that t=\r\nhe door behind crashed open and\n&gt; several blue and white winged flying inse=\r\nctoids were flying in, thier\n&gt; stinger flashing in the light from this room=\r\n!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I get it now!&quot; Vestige said as he turned to see thier new threat, &quot;=\r\nWe\n&gt; must unite!&quot; he said as if understanding the import of Tuscon&#39;s,\n&gt; alt=\r\nhough not quite in the way that he meant them. Turning back to fire\n&gt; a few=\r\n shots at the new threat of flying Insectoids he glanced at\n&gt; Tuscon, &quot;I ne=\r\ned to get to that bed!&quot; He said talking about the bed the\n&gt; insecoids had b=\r\neen working over and the figure that now lay prone on\n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
