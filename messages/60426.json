Having had \na difficult moment some time back.... Locked in stasis... awaiting \nfor that opportune moment to reawaken. \n\nHydras heard Proto request without said nothing, but a special \ncomplink was liunked with Maxima&#39;s pod. He ofted checked MAxima&#39;s \nstatus waitting to the moment when she will be ready to come back to \naction\n\nHer stasis pod was left to where someone would have to awaken her. \nHopefully none too soon. Often she was in stasis lock for a spell... \nonly returning or in the public limelight when the most dangerous or \ndisasterous moments in time was at hand. Bad luck sometimes followed \nher, be it bad luck to her comrades or to her enemies.\nShe laid there, in the pod... waiting.. \n\nHydras consider that Maxima had been alot time out action... &quot;It&#39;s \ntime to awake the sleepy beauty of Predacons&quot; thing Hydras and \nlooking at Proto he said &quot;Folllow me... It&#39;s time that you met oneo \nfo my closest conselours&quot;\nHydras Walke trought several corritors and he arrived to the room \nwhere the pod rested. Hydras pressed some buttons and he waitted \nuntil MAxima awake\n\nWith the release of the connections from her form as they recoiled \naway.... \nShe laid there a moment.. then her optics, more like eyes opened & \nflashed... \nA smirk upon her face as she looked up to first see Hydras... &quot;Well, \nwell... if the knight in shining armour hasn&#39;t come to awaken me..&quot; a \ntad humourous... \n\n&quot;Welcome to live... my dear assesine&quot; hissed Hydras\n\nswinging her long, metallic feline like legs over the side... she got \nup with a feline stretch, her metallic wings extended then contracted \nback into place as she looked over at the other bot. Cocking a brow. \nbut said nothing. Looking back at Hydras.. \n\n&quot;What&#39;s wrong my dear Maxima?&quot;hissed Hydras &quot;The cat eat&#39;s your \nthouge???&quot;\n\ncocking a brow at Hydras. &quot;I am the cat.&quot; she purred in wicked \nsarcasim. Looking at Proto. &quot;Nothing is wrong.&quot; Then returned her \ngaze to Hydras but said nothing. \nInstead... she stretched again.. that organic part of her that was \nstiff some... she&#39;d still have to get used to it... \n\n&quot;I see that you haven&#39;t lost your humor sense&quot;hissed amused \nHydras &quot;But we havne&#39;t time to ironies and word games, Unicrons has \nsent his toys to erase us from this planet... and I need your \nservices, my dear&quot;\n\nTurning utterly serious upon hearing Unicron. \nPonders. &quot;Will not be easy to stop him..OR his lackies... \nEmprzAnastazia:  &quot;\n\nHydras hissed and said &quot;Well well... the other choice is accept his \ninvitation to dinner... as the dinner; to be honest I don&#39;t like it. \nSO we have to give a hand to MAxis in order to stop his minions and \nafter that run our plans to destroy Unicron&quot;\n\nShe smirked. &quot;Sounds more than familiar. Having been there already,&quot; \nshe softly hissed. \nLooking back up at Hydras. &quot;Very well,&quot;\nGazing at Hydras a moment... \n\nHydras caught the gaze and said  &quot;What&#39;s familiar my dear?&quot;\n\n&quot;Unicron.. uniting with the Autobots.... that sort of thing.&quot; looking \nat Hydras with a grin. &quot;Have you forgotten... I was there?&quot; cocking \nher head to the side, her claw hands upon her awkward hips.\n\n&quot;Oh yesss, yesss&quot;hissed Hydras while he touched her chin&quot;Ahhh it \nhappens severak centuries go.... how could I forget it????... and you \nshould remember that your little aprenttice&#39;s husbance would be \naround there, and he swear revenge&quot;\n\nCocking a brow. Striking her curiousity... \n&quot;Oh?&quot; Though a weak smirk upon her metallic lips as she looked back \nat him, pondering... \n\n&quot;It seems...&quot;hissed amused Hydras &quot;That you have forgotten StarStorm&quot;\n\nBlinking a bit... somehow... the past was foggy. Furrowing her \nbrow. &quot;Unfortunately, it seems that some of my memory has been \nlost... \n\n&quot;I see&quot;hissed again Hydras &quot;Wel unlucky he don&#39;t so you should be \ncarefull with Prime...&quot;\n\nHer brow cocks a tad higher. &quot;Oh? & what is it that I have done \nsupposedly to Prime?&quot;\n\n&quot;Prime it&#39;s mine... that&#39;s all that I have to say about him&quot;hissed \nHydras&quot;bye now my dear, are you ready to go to action?&quot;\n\nPondering a moment, then looking up at Hydras with a wicked grin. &quot;Of \ncourse,&quot; she purred in delight. \n\n&quot;That&#39;s it&quot;hissed Hydras &quot;Now how do you feel? ready for action?&quot;\nEmprzAnastazia: Smirking.... &quot;I would think ready for anything.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good&quot;hissed Hydras&quot;Then we need to do a quick plan and Proto&quot; said \nthe male while he watch towards Proto&quot;I&#39;m afraid that you couldn0&#39;t \nkill any maximal by now... not until Unicron was defeated&quot;\n\nLooking at Proto with a calculating eye. \n\n&quot;WE&#39;re loosing time here&quot;hissed Hydras&quot;We should move... to &#39;help&#39; \nmaximals&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course,&quot; none to enthusiastic about it. But.. she would obey him. \n\n\n"}}
