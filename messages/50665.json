That was probably the most impressive display of emotion \nthat a bot could get out of the cold transformer. Words, however, \ndidn&#39;t really affect her, and the consolation had fallen on deaf \nears. Noir was either refusing to open up, or she was just incapable \nof talking for some reason or another. Too many things of the past \nstill affected her, things which she couldn&#39;t get rid of. \nThankfully, she was able to focus and fight efficiently, and the \nmemories only affected her when her mind wasn&#39;t occupied on \nsomething. Perhaps that was why she&#39;d taken on repairs and other \ntechnical abillites as a hobby of sorts.\n\nNoir lightly shrugs off Gatara&#39;s large hand, &quot;Alright Gatara, I will \nstay here. I&#39;m fully prepared to start doing missions for Devilcat \nagain.&quot; She said as she went over to the sensors, axious to have \nsomething to attack, or a job to do.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Gatara::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Negatory,&quot; Gatara dismisses the notion with a wave of her hand.  \n&gt; &quot;They&#39;ll be back soon.  I expect Jayde will need some time in the \nCR \n&gt; - she never learns.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The brownish-green bot places a hand on Noir&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;Don&#39;t \nlet \n&gt; it get to you.  Everyone messes up once in a while, and we&#39;ve had \n&gt; setbacks before.  We&#39;ll recover, just like we always do.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
