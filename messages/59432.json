To ensure all Shad&#39;s\n&gt; data tracks were intact along with his form, Primus\n&gt; used divine intervention by going back to his moment\n&gt; of deat and transporting his components through space\n&gt; and time from the very instant before he became\n&gt; atomised. He then used a blank protoform for materials\n&gt; in restoring his form. Plus it gave those who had\n&gt; characters who were involved with the Nemesis incident\n&gt; a background and referince point for their characters\n&gt; when they saw him again.\n&gt; \n&gt;  --- Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; OOC: Can you just clarify the situation in the\n&gt; Nemesis?

All around him was blingind white- the\n&gt; source\n&gt; &gt; of it appeared to be a being the size of the\n&gt; legendary\n&gt; &gt; chaos bringer himself. However, this being radiated\n&gt; &gt; something intense, but at the same time, this\n&gt; &gt; intensity seemed to be founded on infinite good. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It took Shaodwcaster a mintue to realise who he was\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; the presense of and when he did, he could hardly\n&gt; &gt; believe it. There, in front of him, was Primus.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Primus then began to speak, but in a surprisingly\n&gt; soft\n&gt; &gt; tone and volume for one his size.  &quot;Be not afraid my\n&gt; &gt; chosen one, for I have summoned you here for a\n&gt; purpose\n&gt; &gt; which is of critical importance for the future of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; universe.  I know for eons deep down what you have\n&gt; &gt; wondered - how a Decepticon would become one of the\n&gt; &gt; greatest protectors of the Autobots in Cybertronian\n&gt; &gt; history.  The Answer is that it was by my hand. I\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; the one who altered your programing, you were chosen\n&gt; &gt; by my own intervention to be a guardian for those of\n&gt; &gt; my children who required protection.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shadowcaster for the first time in his existence was\n&gt; &gt; speechless. How could it have been that he was\n&gt; chosen?\n&gt; &gt; Why him? He knew that he was the most advanced of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; 1st generation of Transformers to be created but\n&gt; aside\n&gt; &gt; from his design, why him?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Primus continued &quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking- why\n&gt; me?\n&gt; &gt; The fact is that aside from your design, your spark\n&gt; &gt; was that of a hero, a being destined to save, to be\n&gt; &gt; great. That fusion made you my choice as guardian\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; my Autobot children. And watch over them well you\n&gt; did-\n&gt; &gt; the war would not have turned out as it did were it\n&gt; &gt; not for your intervention.  I know that in the Beast\n&gt; &gt; Wars, you lost much that was close to you, but I am\n&gt; &gt; glad that you were able to join with the matrix, see\n&gt; &gt; what you were meant for, to be reniewed for the\n&gt; &gt; purpose you were meant for. Now though I have a new\n&gt; &gt; purpose- one far more perilous and crucial than any\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; have given you before.  I am sending you back in\n&gt; time-\n&gt; &gt; Unicron has contacted himself in the past and\n&gt; informed\n&gt; &gt; himself of his future defeat, and now tries to alter\n&gt; &gt; history.  I cannot intervene, however I send you\n&gt; back\n&gt; &gt; to fight for me against him.  I will give you your\n&gt; &gt; optimised maximal body, along with all the data it\n&gt; &gt; contained, as well as the ability to sense the\n&gt; matrix\n&gt; &gt; in any era you are in, along with its present\n&gt; location\n&gt; &gt; and its location in the time you are travelling to.\n&gt; It\n&gt; &gt; is on your shoulders that the fate of every\n&gt; &gt; cybertronian and possibly the universe rests. Go\n&gt; now,\n&gt; &gt; and protect all my children- Autobot, Maximal,\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon, Tripredacus and Predacon alike. Bring\n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; peace, unite them.  Remeber always, you are my\n&gt; hands,\n&gt; &gt; my eyes, my tongue, my ears.... Remember always I\n&gt; &gt; believe in you.....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron cackled manaiacally ordering Dinobot to\n&gt; open\n&gt; &gt; fire as the Nemesis closed in on the volcano which\n&gt; &gt; would later be named Mount Saint Hillary.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Optimus was in disbelief at what he saw &quot;By the\n&gt; &gt; matrix, if Megatron succeeds here, we&#39;ll all be\n&gt; &gt; destroyed.  Shadimus, you&#39;re in command! Optimus-&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Optimus was interrupted by Shadimus&#39; hand clasped\n&gt; &gt; firmly on his shoulder.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He looked into Primal&#39;s eyes, with the look of a\n&gt; &gt; martyr about to sacrifice himself unwillingly, but\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; the same time knowing there was no other way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;No! Your place is with those undser your command...\n&gt; &gt; This is no longer about revenge or vindication.... I\n&gt; &gt; know what must be done. Optimus, take care you those\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; have sworn to watch over..... Optimus Prime would be\n&gt; &gt; proud to know his name had gone to a more than\n&gt; worthy\n&gt; &gt; successor.?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Optimus tried desperately to persuade him otherwise\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wait, you don&#39;t have to do this, there has to be\n&gt; &gt; another way. I&#39;m not in the mood to lose any more\n&gt; &gt; friends today!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Please don&#39;t make this harder than it already is.\n&gt; My\n&gt; &gt; duty is to protect the Autobots and their\n&gt; decendants.\n&gt; &gt; It has been an honour serving with you, but I cannot\n&gt; &gt; shirk my duty.... Til all... are one!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Before Optimus could react, Shadimus broke away from\n&gt; &gt; him, and transformed into his air attack mode, guns\n&gt; &gt; blazing at the predacon ship, destroying turret\n&gt; after\n&gt; &gt; turret.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Shadimus... NOOOO!&quot; Primal cried out, but he knew\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; was too late. The other Maximals looked on is\n&gt; respect\n&gt; &gt; but in disbelief, as if watching someone close to\n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; fall out of their grasp when hanging perilously over\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; cliff. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron was less than impressed &quot;Playtimes over\n&gt; &gt; pussycat... Yess! OPEN FIRE, ALL CANNONS!&quot; The\n&gt; turrets\n&gt; &gt; started heavily ripping into his armour, faster than\n&gt; &gt; Shdimus could fire back. Knowing the specs of the\n&gt; &gt; Nemesis from millions of years ago, Shadimus knew\n&gt; what\n&gt; &gt; he had to do. &quot;Computer, disengage all safety\n&gt; &gt; protocols, program omega-1.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Acknowledged...&quot; reluctantly came the voice of his\n&gt; &gt; internal computer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With that he adjusted his flight path into a\n&gt; collision\n&gt; &gt; course directly at the bridge of the behemoth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The cannonse kept ripping him to shreds, the pain\n&gt; &gt; becoming intense, however Shadimus refused to waver\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Til.... all....... are..... one!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; With that the ripped a gaping hole in the hull of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Nemesis, with Shadimus seemilngy being atomised in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; process.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: It&#39;s upto whoever ius playing the characters\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; were in Nemesis parts 1 and 2 as to their\n&gt; &gt; memories/feelings for that day. Especially critical\n&gt; &gt; with Rattrap who&#39;s Shadowcaster&#39;s son.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC: Unknown to all parties, at that instant,\n&gt; several\n&gt; &gt; microscopic transwarp portals opened up absorbing\n&gt; &gt; piece after piece after piece of Shadimus&#39; broken\n&gt; &gt; body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not far from the Maximal base, a submerged blank\n&gt; &gt; protoform begins to glow bright white, its form\n&gt; &gt; becoming unrecognisable, as several transwarp\n&gt; portals\n&gt; &gt; open up around the now seemingly formless protoform,\n&gt; &gt; the parts these portals have ferried merging with\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; protoform, as it begins to alter it&#39;s form, like\n&gt; clay\n&gt; &gt; moulded with unseen hands, over the course of a\n&gt; &gt; minute, altering form until with an ethereal glow\n&gt; &gt; surrounding him, Shadowcaster awakens.\n&gt; &gt; OOC: these protals would be noticable by Maximal\n&gt; &gt; scanners.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:Not wasting any time, he quickly scans the area\n&gt; &gt; for the Maximal Base, transforms into his air attack\n&gt; &gt; mode, then flys there at top speed, landing in front\n&gt; &gt; of the base. Once landed and transformed into robot\n&gt; &gt; mode, he opens up a channel, a wry smile on his\n&gt; face.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Maximal Base this is Shadowcaster. Let me just say\n&gt; &gt; that, while the Matrix was nice, it&#39;s great to be\n&gt; back\n&gt; &gt; among the living.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://personals.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
