She looked around and saw that she was \nfloating through a long tunnel filled with blue light.  The light swirled \naround her.  She remembered dieing, but couldn&#39;t remember how she had gotten \nhere. She floated along until she came to a great opening.  It was \nbeautiful.  It was filled with white light and swirling colors.  Balls of \ndifferent colored light flew past her and around her.  She felt at peace \nwith where she was.\n\nShe floated past the light and into a space.  It was dark with a light \nwirlpool in the center. She floated over to the swirling light pool.  It \nspoke to her.  It told her to return to the world of the living.  She had \nsacrificed herself to save another and was worthy of another chance at life. \n  She turned and floated back past the white light and back into the dark \ntunnel.\n\nWhen she awoke, she was at the lake shore.  She felt the cool lake water \nlapping at her feet.  She rose slowly to her feet.\n\n&quot;What?  I&#39;m alive? How is that possable? Wasn&#39;t I dead?&quot;  She looked around \nat her surroundings. &quot;Where am I? What am I?&quot;\n\nShe turned and looked into a small pool at the waters edge.  She had been \ntransformed into a river otter. She suddenly forgot her death experience and \nlooked at herself.  She had sleek dark brown fur, a long tail, sharp little \nclaws, and an over whelming urge to go swimming.\nShe dived intot he lake and swam around for an hour.  She felt free.  She \nfelt alive.\n\nAfter swimig, she crawled out of the water and transformed into her bot \nmode.  She looked at her reflection in the water. &quot;Gee I look good.&quot;\n\nShe walked around the lake looking for another bot to talk to.\n\nENTER THE MAXIMAL ::Fidgit::\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
