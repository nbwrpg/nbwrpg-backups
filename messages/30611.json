His mind was torn with visions of the Buggers he had just \nannihilated.  He flew onward for many weeks as millennia passed in real time. \n His personal transport which had been equipped with one bomb capable of \ndestroying a world.  He had used that already and was now unarmed.\n\n    By some bizarre quirk of fate his transport stumbled into a hole in the \nfabric of space and time.  He was flung out millions of years before he had \ndestroyed the bugger homeworld.  He was flung out millions of miles from \nwhere he had last been.  He was flung out spinning toward Earth.\n\n    He was able to gain enough control to not crash so hard as to die on \nimpact but he did happen to land on Enertron who died.  Before he stepped out \nhe realized that he would need an alternate form for this strange world.  For \na touch of irony he chose the form of the bugger drones he had just \nannihilated millions of years in the future.\n\n    He stepped out and looked around.  He was on an open field surrounded by, \nwell, field.  This would not do to hide his ship.  He got back in and found a \ncave in the Appalachian Mountains half way around the world.  He seals the \ncave with a few shots burying the only opening.  He was careful to leave no \nnew openings in it&#39;s wake.  It would appear to any passerby that it was \nsimply a recent rockslide.\n\n    He knew that there were at least some other bots here from his brief and \nviolent trip through the atmosphere.  Ender transmits a brief message on all \nchannels.  &quot;This is Ender I wish to find someone else here.&quot;  \n\n"}}
