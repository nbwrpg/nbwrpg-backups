Waiting to feel the bite of the bug and the increasing pain...only to not feel it at all?\nShe opened one of her optics and looked towards Nemesis, both of her optics snapping open as she saw what she did.\nIt was almost as if he was falling backwards but not all they way, lice the air was holding him up half way. And his mouth was open to, but there was no sound coming out.\nBut then she saw him slowly lower to the floor, still trying to recover from see him his scream with no sound.\nWhat in the Pit was going on?!\nIron Raptor looked around but saw nothing, nothing at all.\nThen leaned forward, if it wasn&#39;t for the restraint she would have fallen onto her face.\nStaring down at Nemesis she then the only things stopping her from falling forward...open!!!\nIron Raptor yelled in surprise as he body suddenly pitched forward but then sighed when she caught herself, steadying herself with her legs but then standing at full height and looking around.\nSomething was going on here that she should be aware of and she knew it, but what?\nRubbing her sore wrist with her other hand she looked around, puzzled to the extreme.*\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
