She looked up at \nVulois and then to Cybershark.  &quot;There might be a way. But I don&#39;t \nknow if it would work.  I could hook up a direct link to your stored \nmemory and try to gain access, unlock it for you as it were. But it&#39;s \nonly a theory that it will work. I&#39;ve never done anything like it. \njust read about it once. It&#39;s a shot, a long shot, but a shot non the \nless.&quot;  She looked at Cybershark,&quot;You&#39;d have to monitor us and if \nthere were any trouble, you&#39;d have to disconnect us.&quot;\n\nShe didn&#39;t know of the risks, she had no clue as to waht she was \nreally going to do, but she figured she had nothing to lose. \n\n\n"}}
