She didn&#39;t mind either choice right now. \n  She wanted to hunt and didn&#39;t care where for the moment. She found a \ncarcass of a bear that was half decade.  It had old meat hanging from metal \nremains.  She grimaced at the sight and ran off in another direction.  She \nfound some fish in a small stream and that satisfied her hunger.  She walked \nalong until she found a shaded spot under a large tree near a cave.  She \ncurled up and fell sleep.\n\n\n-----Original Message-------\nFrom: Talon Harvilicz  &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\nDate: Mon Jun 26, 2000 3:03pm\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nRowdy Wolf:\n\n\n\nRowdy Wolf jerked up. Strangers meant invaders to him. Beast or bot. He\nstood up, the heavy furs on his body flowing at his movements.\n\n&quot;It is my right to look after this,&quot; he said after Zyber. He ran after her,\nand transformed to his beast mode. He had to push himself with his heavy\nbody and short legs that his dire wolf beast mode had. He wasn&#39;t much on\nspeed when it came to hunting, he relied on ambush and stealth.\n\nHe sniffed the air as he ran, taking in the scents of the bots. The one a\nwolf--that wasn&#39;t good to him. Male as well. His jaws ached to bite into\nthat one. The other was some sort of bird. He growled as he went on. As far\nas he was concered, there were trespassing on his territor and will be\nkilled.\n\nHis nose zoned into their position. He hung a right, plowing up a hill. He\ncouldn&#39;t hit them head-on. That would be stupid. He had to study their\nposition then take them out from there.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
