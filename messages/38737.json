The mutant transformed to his dragon form and caught his preys scent\non the wind. &quot;So you&#39;ve returned to Maximal city, then your fate will have\nto wait till later since I arranged a nonagression pact between the\nPredacons and Maximals. (Hopefully it&#39;s still in effect.)\n\nHe remembered the attackers well, some were Predacon, some were of a faction\nhe wasn&#39;t aware of, and if his visuals were correct the rest were\nDecepticons. If the Decepticons were reactivated then that meant that\nanother artifact roamed the Earth and needed to be recycled.

The reptillian beast stalked through the\n&gt; cave hunting his unsuspecting prey. Necromancers scent was strong, the\n&gt; mutant knew that his DNA doner was near, Looking over a series of\n&gt; Stalactites he creapt closer. From where he was he could see what he&#39;d\ncome\n&gt; for. Somehow the Mutant hadn&#39;t suspected that the hunt would end this\n&gt; easily, or this quickly. The mighty T-Rex dove forward biting down on what\n&gt; he believed was his enemy. His attitude quickly changed with the\nrealization\n&gt; that all he had was a pile of shedded scales. &quot;So you&#39;ve gotten rid of\nyour\n&gt; old form. That won&#39;t save you, one day soon I will execute you like the\n&gt; inferior unit you are.&quot; The mutants insanity was obvious but his logic\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be denied.
