I&#39;ll have to \n&gt; apologise for taking off so suddenly&#39; Teltoli idly wondered. \n&gt; \n&gt; Suddenly an idea popped into her head, and she sat up straight. \n&gt; &quot;Maximize&quot; She whispered, and transformed into her Bot Mode. It was \n&gt; different from last time. While admiring her new form, she suddenly \n&gt; looked up at a bot landed in front of her. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well another maximal. Well she&#39;s kinda cute so I will give you a \n&gt; choice you  can join the alliance or die by my hand.&quot; It said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Uh Oh, think fast and put on a brave front!&#39; Her mind babbled in \n&gt; shock. &#39;I really hope someone else gets here fast! A maximal!&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Teltoli raised an eyebrow, and a smile grew across her \nfeatures. &quot;Uh-\n&gt; huh... Whatever, I&#39;m not joining those Alliance losers!&quot; Teltoli \n&gt; snorted, then laughed openly in the bots face, her two hands \nhovering \n&gt; near her rapiers in case he really did try attack. But even though \n&gt; she looked ready to fight, a glint of fear showed in her eyes, and \nit \n&gt; really didn&#39;t help her position by the fact that she was sitting on \n&gt; the top of her Pod.\n&gt; \n&gt; She was shocked, again, as Windlord came to her rescue, standing in \n&gt; front of her bravely. &quot;Wow..&quot; She breathed. Talk about brave! And \nit \n&gt; was a Maximal!\n&gt; \n&gt; The bot stood up and walked next to Windlord, her rapiers \nunsheathed \n&gt; and ready to use.\n\n\n"}}
