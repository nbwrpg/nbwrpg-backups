Simply spitting it out near the forest edge and going back to work on his chest, the open wound bleeding freely onto his front limbs and ground, creating a small but growing area of red ahead of him.\nHe knew that their time of rest would soon have to be interrupted by the need to get back to base, knowing that they needed repair and that it wasn�t wise to be beyond a base with two enemy forces able to attack at any moment.\nBut the sun was not completely gone from the sky above and the night creatures had not yet stirred from their day hideaways, knowing that the darkness of night was the best cover of all.\nDinobot growled as he removed a rather stubborn piece of armor, the open hole it left bleeding just as freely as the his side. However, taking no real notice, just noting it as another wound he was forced to let bleed thanks to the factor that he could not simply lick it clean as he would in his organic beast mode.\nThere was just something in the saliva of organic creatures that clotted the bleeding and began the healing process, being all armor left him deprived of that ability.\nWith an annoyed sigh he yanked on another armor shred and discarded it, going back to his patch-up cleaning job.\nIt was then that he noticed that Tavatron had made her way to his side, kneeling at his side and speaking softly and kindly to him.\nWith a deep growl he turned his head towards Tavatron, eyeing her questioningly as his muscles tensed in reaction to her question.\nHe never did like anyone near him while he was injured, always taking care of it himself.\nHe had grown accustom to dealing with things alone, with nobot ever putting such raw emotion in trying to help him he didn�t quite know how to respond.\nSimply looking at her blankly, though feeling every one of his wounds.\nShe wanted to help him but he knew that she wouldn�t help him in the way that he needed to be helped, the organic compound found in saliva the only think that could clot and begin to heal his wounds.\nBut she would never do such a thing, licking his wounds clean and offering the compound to his systems to begin repairs.  It simply wasn�t done.\nNobot had ever helped him, not expecting her to go to such extremes either.\nIf he had owned his organic beast mode then he would do it himself, but since he did not all hopes of repair were lost.\nSo, he would let it bleed. There was nothing else he could do.\nHer offer to bandage it was kind but he knew that even a bandage wouldn�t even slow the mech-fluid flow, too much pressure escaping from the pumps.\nBesides, if she did it would only fall off in the swamp they had to cross, the fluid flowing just as freely bandaged as it would if there was not one.\nDinobot glanced at the gushing wound on his side, trying to keep his concern within the shadows of his being but a little escaping and showing itself in his eyes.\n He KNEW that if he didn�t get to the Cybertronien fire by noon the next day he would have a very good chance of bleeding to death, a factor in which he would do all he could to prevent.\nLooking at the wound he then looked at Tavatron, wondering if she would be able to guess what he knew. Cold, hard reality.\nBut then, knowing that she might be able to see the concern he dwelled with he turned his head from her and directed his attention towards the wound in his chest, not wanting her to become more concerned of him then she already was.\nHis voice flat and emotionless, as if there was nothing wrong at all. *\n\n� Don�t bother. No� bandage� could cease the fluid flow of this wound.�\n\n*His words died away with a growl as he began running his fangs through his wounded chest again, sweeping through it once before simply lifting his jaws from it. No completely clean of metal shreds but still bleeding, not as heavily as his side but fairly close.\n Dinobot stretched his claws out in front of him, his joints aching from damage. A snarl escaping his throat as his wounded side stretched as well, simply working out the kinks and then relaxing again.\nHe moved a bit and laid out on the soft grass, stretching out on his side and leaving his wound to bleed freely as he did so. His tail stretched out behind him, just as emotionless as he had just become.\nAll movement that could be seen of him now was his chest as it rose and sank, his breathing a little more heavy due to the wounds but even.\nHe had to conserve his energy if he was to get Tavatron to the Cybertronien Fire by early morning, still a bit concerned about his own welfare. He was bleeding heavily and he would be dry by noon the next day if he didn�t reach the intended destination, but he knew that he would reach it and with time to spare. He would just be a bit low.\nA mega-cycle with repair would see his damage repaired, but then he would be forced to drink a fair amount of fluids. Nothing that he couldn�t handle.\nBut it would benefit him to begin repairs now, but he knew that it was impossible without that compound found in saliva.\nSo, he simply set his mind on repair and the consumption of several liters of fluids.\nDinobot let out a heavy breath followed by a soft growl, letting his muscles relax around his wounds in order to ease the pain a bit.\nHis voice calm and collected, not even bothering to lift his head. *\n\n� Save your concerns about me and rest, Tavatron. The journey ahead will be long and difficult for both of us.�\n\n\n* With that he slowly closed his eyes and relaxed every one of his muscles, hoping that he was masking his concerns about his damaged systems. Hoping that she would begin to relax again and enjoy what time of peace they had left before they moved on.\nHowever, still ready to jump and defend if the moment ever arose. *\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
