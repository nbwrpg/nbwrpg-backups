She walked with him to the mess hall.  She \nkept her face plates black.  She didn&#39;t like showing emotions. They \nget in the way. She remembered what happened to her before she was \nburied. She remembered the bot who  had taken her spark. In the end, \nit proved her undoing and her ruin.  She remembered how her emotions \nhad been used against her in ways unthinkable. She sat down at the \ntable, and let him get some energon for them.  She lowered her head \nand thought of the past. And then she lifted her head and looked at \nSharpClaw. She closed her optics a second and promised not to make \nthe same mistake again. She frowned slightly and looked around the \nmess hall.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; : : SharpClaw : :\n&gt; SharpClaw: Great.
