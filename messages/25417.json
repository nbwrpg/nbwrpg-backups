He looks \ndown at Darkfate and DrillBit as he approaches them.\n\n&quot;My group was followed. We had to pause to take care of the \nattackers,&quot; he looks around, &quot;What&#39;s the situation? And who are you?&quot; \nThe second question was directed at Scorponok.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer walks up behind Killfest, standing a foot taller, and \nbeing much more insane-looking, than his commander.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther lands near Killfest, uncloaking and putting Darkmouse down. \nDarkmouse runs over to DrillBit.\n\n&quot;What happened to the base???&quot; She asks excitingly.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven and Demise walk up behind Killfest and EndBringer, looking at \nthe small bots in the area uncertainly. They wern&#39;t used to being \naround bots that were less than 10 feet tall, as most of these were.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  With the destruction of War&#39;s spark a hidden protocol in the \nhidden ship \n&gt; turned on. It had been dl&#39;d into Drill Bit&#39;s mind by War. It was a \nsecret \n&gt; comm hidden in the bots brain. It turned on. &quot;Drill Bit.... this \nmessage \n&gt; comes with sorrow. If you are hearing this I am dead and so is the \ncouncil \n&gt; base. But hope still lives. The base destructor came in is still \nhere! he \n&gt; only hid it from his enemies with a flashy light show and a fancy \ncloak \n&gt; device. Unfortunatly it&#39;s defences can only be put on-line by his \nhand. But I \n&gt; have a solution to that. I dl&#39;d something in the computers after \nhis death. \n&gt; Here are the coordinates of the base. Grid 7-5 alpha. All you have \nto do is \n&gt; copy destructor&#39;s voice wich I have dl&#39;d into this comm. You will \nfind it \n&gt; helpful it will decloak the base and open the main door. Go to the \nmain \n&gt; computer counsol and hit the green button. That will solve the \ndefence \n&gt; problem. I wish you good luck. And long live the predacon empire!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
