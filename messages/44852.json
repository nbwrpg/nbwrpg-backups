I \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   came across \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; a p=\r\nost talking about Neo beast Wars RPG.

Every day, people sent posts of\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; the cu=\r\nrrent list of \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   members.  \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Eventually, we beca=\r\nme part of egroups (now\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Yahoogroups), and were \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   a=\r\nble to \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; gain a much larger amount of members.  When i\n  &gt;  =\r\n &gt;   &gt; joined, the council \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   was \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Yanshosh, Ks=\r\nlawdogg, JP3884, and Inferno371. \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Soulstice was there \n  &gt;   &gt; =\r\n  &gt;   too, then \n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; being called &quot;code,&quot; much to his disliking=\r\n.
