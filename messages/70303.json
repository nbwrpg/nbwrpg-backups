He looks to \n&gt; Perceptor and then to the others.  Straight Shot meets up with him and \n&gt; offers back his transmitter. He looks to her with a smile.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ahh, my transmitter.  Great to have you back Straight Shot.  Thank you. \n&gt; Now I can help everyone much more efficiantly.  Perceptor, I&#39;m going to \n&gt; get into vehicle mode, I will attempt to use sonar to pinpoint the \n&gt; creature&#39;s positions, and I could use you to map them.  Legacy, I&#39;d like \n&gt; you and everyone else to get aboard inside me,  because we may need to \n&gt; make for a fast getaway, and it&#39;s a lot easier if everyone is safe inside \n&gt; one transformer.  I will need you for a weapon mount because in truck \n&gt; form, the missiles are all I have and I may need something a bit more \n&gt; refined than those. Talon, I will need your help to man the cannon mount \n&gt; on my trailer. Two eyes up there are better than one.  Quickstride, \n&gt; Straight Shot, remain inside my cab and man the radar system.\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nodds as does Quickstride.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gotchya.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson transforms and opens all doors to everyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;All right, all aboard.

Since as it was discovered, the Black Fortress is in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Europe, and as we know the Ark is in North America. I believe that at\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the point in time NBW&#39;s takes place that there is a land bound route\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from the US to Europe, but it would take a very long time to traverse\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it. :)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride and Straight Shot find it relatively easy to reach the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; area that Tuscon, Perceptor and Legacy are. The Ark&#39;s side of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cavern is steep and sheer, but here on the European side, near the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Black fortress, it is sloped enough that a vehicle could drive up\n&gt;&gt; &gt; without too much difficulty.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ahead of Quickstride and Straight Shot, Legacy had been silent during\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the trip so far, seemingly content to let the others take the lead.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; His sensors had also locked in on Rodimus for a moment, and then like\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the others lost him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus appeared to be in critical condition.&quot; Legacy said as he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; walked, his cold cyclopean gaze attempting to pierce into the darkness\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ahead. &quot;I did not get an exact enough scan of that creature that held\n&gt;&gt; &gt; him to get a positive identification, however I have no information on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what I gave scanned.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tuscon&#39;s headlights stretched far ahead into the darkness, but beyond\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the reach of them there was only darkness, or cave wall where the path\n&gt;&gt; &gt; bent and turned. The venting steam that had obscured their vision had\n&gt;&gt; &gt; slowed and then finally stopped. Ahead of them the tunnel appeared\n&gt;&gt; &gt; clear, although there was still little sign of Rodimus or his apparent\n&gt;&gt; &gt; abductor, save for the occasional scrape of metal on stone.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The noxious smell of magma still fills the air making the bean pod gas\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from Quickstride hardly noticeable, mixed in as it was with all the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; other strange odors. Also heat from the surrounding walls and floor\n&gt;&gt; &gt; make this area very hot even for transformers, although it is still\n&gt;&gt; &gt; bearable.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ahead of Tuscon, Perceptor and Legacy some sort of movement of several\n&gt;&gt; &gt; creatures can be made out, it does not look like Rodimus  . . .\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
