It felt so good!\n&gt; But this whole place was strange!\n&gt; He had grown in a star ship, he didn&#39;t know what living on a planet \nwas like \n&gt; and it was frightening as well as exciting.\n&gt; D curled into a tight ball as soon as all four linbs were on land, \nhis tail \n&gt; curled around hos side and his ears flat against his skull. His \nnose sniffed \n&gt; carefully in every direction, pizzled on what this place was and \ntaking in \n&gt; it&#39;s smells.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
