He activates his \ncomm-link, sending a transmission to all Alliance troops in the area (I think \nthat&#39;s all of them but Feline, Skulletron, and Perndabot).\n\n&quot;Alliance bots,&quot; the transmission reads, &quot;There is a battle against the \nMaximals several clicks northeast of the base. Stranato, Inzola, Burning \nHammer, can you back the Alliance troops up? Starscream, I&#39;d apreciate if you \nhelp to. I&#39;ll send the Oblitercons to help against Megatron later on. Gotron, \nplease go and help Wheeljack retrieve a probe? After you two have it secure \nin the base, you go to the battle. Wheeljack should stay and run a few tests \non it. I&#39;ll be arriving at the fight shortly.&quot;\n\nHe turns around as he ends the transmission, looking at Sickle and motioning \nfor him to follow as he heads out of the bridge. &quot;Do you know if you can \nfight at all?&quot; he asks him, glancing back over his shoulder.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDark One recieves Zardus&#39; orders, looking back at Squizzy.\n\n&quot;Hurry,&quot; he says, &quot;Let&#39;s get to the CR chambers. I need to get back to the \nbattle.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer barely jumps out of the way of the shots, hearing Zardus&#39; \ntransmission with relief. Soon, there would be reinforcements. That would be \nvery welcome.\n\nHe fires another shot as his stun gun finally runs out of energy, DevilDuer \nquickly swapping it for a small rifle and firing again at Astral.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScavenger ducks as he hears a yell behind him, an optic blast grazing his \nshoulder. \n\nHe spins around, a rocket launcher apearing in his hand from subspace, firing \ntwo rockets at Fenox.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPyro smiles evilly at Giplash, jumping back and standing ready.\n\n&quot;Very well. I can kill you that way too,&quot; he says, one hand moving behind his \nback, the other holding his sword steady.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBreakdown shakes as shots from the pistol hit him, the artillery cannon \nspinning around.\n\nThe heavily armored wheels start to turn, sending him driving toward \nStarlight, firing a rocket at her from the cannon.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHiss yells as a beam hits him in the stomach, sending him spinning down to \nthe ground. He stops himself a few feet above the tress, burning pain coming \nfrom his abdomen.\n\nTransforming into his much smaller gun mode, Hiss flies up again, firing shot \nafter shot at Recklessa.\n\n"}}
