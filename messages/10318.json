She \n&gt; hated being caged. but this may be the only way to get to Quickstrike.\n&gt; Se walked into the vault and looked at the spider. &quot;He&#39;s not my \n&gt; boyfriend. He&#39;s my commander. I am programmed to follow him. Got a \n&gt; problem with it?&quot; she knew she should have held her tongue, but she \n&gt; wanted this bot to know that she was following orders and \n&gt; programming, not just her spark.  \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll stay here, but I still wish to see my commander.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;     Black Aracnia led Darkmouse deep into the innards of Trypticon. \n&gt; As foar \n&gt; &gt; as she was concerned, she was the commander now. She single \n&gt; handedly saved \n&gt; &gt; the ship, and the dominance of the Predacons as well.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Alright you parasitic slut, you&#39;lll be caged here until I talk \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; Megatron. Your boyfriend is eight levels up, and the internal \n&gt; weponry is \n&gt; &gt; still armed and ready so I suggest you stay put.&quot; Aracnia said, \n&gt; motioning \n&gt; &gt; with her gun for Darkmouse to enter the vault where energon was \n&gt; formerly kept.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     The mirk of the swapms was the thickest in all the beast wars. \n&gt; No other \n&gt; &gt; place was as dismal or dark as the swamps that bordered the \n&gt; Predacon and \n&gt; &gt; Maximal territories. They were vast, deep, and housed some of the \n&gt; most \n&gt; &gt; dangerous prehistoric creatures anyone had seen.\n&gt; &gt;     Among all the chaos of the bugs and aquatic life of the swamp, \n&gt; a long \n&gt; &gt; lost and forgotten stasis pod slipped from its peach and floated to \n&gt; the bank \n&gt; &gt; of a body of water.\n&gt; &gt;     The computer, now able to activate, began the DNA scanning \n&gt; process to \n&gt; &gt; select the beast mode of the protoform within. The sphere rose, and \n&gt; scanned \n&gt; &gt; the vast area of the swamp. After a double pass, it selected the \n&gt; most \n&gt; &gt; powerful beast mode according to the habitat.\n&gt; &gt;     The sphere rejoined the pod, and the transformation began. \n&gt; Moments past \n&gt; &gt; and the computer bagan to read off the data needed by the new form \n&gt; to survive \n&gt; &gt; in the beast wars.\n&gt; &gt;     With a crack, the door opened and the new warrior crawled out \n&gt; of the pod \n&gt; &gt; and on to the bank of the swamp. He looked around. With the \n&gt; complete history \n&gt; &gt; of the beast wars stored in his data banks, he would be able to \n&gt; handle \n&gt; &gt; himself in this new world.\n&gt; &gt;     Looking, he said to himself, &quot;Ah, this beast mode shall make a \n&gt; fine body. \n&gt; &gt; Now all I need to do is to transform.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;     Paralysis said the code word and his Predacon Beast Mode \n&gt; emerged. The \n&gt; &gt; frog changed into an armored knight of the Predacon dynasty. He was \n&gt; armed \n&gt; &gt; with a toxen gun, a semi-automatic pistol, and optic lasers. \n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Ha! Now to contact the Predacons...and to end the reign of the \n&gt; Maximals!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
