He just stood there in utter amazament. In\nfront of him was Optimus Prime, the venerable Autobot, the ideal to\nattain, the fabled leader, but most of all, the grandfather he never\nhad the chance to meet.\n\nHe raised a hand and passed it on the huge head of his ancestor. He\nfelt nostalgic, thinking of Pumpskin, who had fallen in the hands of\nthe Preds, the Tripredacus, who had conquered his homeland, and of the\nSurvivors, trying to build a semblant of resistance on Earth. His\nfists clenched and emotion swirled in his mind. He hated the Predacons\nfor their constant tugs on the Pax Cybertronia, but he was now\nloathing against the Tripredacus. Something had to be done...\n\nYggdrasil: I will have to go, Kup. Maybe not now, but my duty tells me\nI&#39;ll have to leave this planet.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup liked how this Gromlock spoke.
