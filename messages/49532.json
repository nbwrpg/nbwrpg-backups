Azure&#39;s no-post session kinda messed me up as far as \nposting goes. Other than that, I&#39;ve been helping my best friends \nmove into their new appartment for the last few days. We finished \nmost stuff yesterday night. (and proceeded to LAN =p) I read all of \nthe posts that happened since I left so I&#39;m pretty much caught up. \n(I personally don&#39;t like asking the group for a recap, better that I \ndo it myself.) =)\n\nWould anyone mind if I had Switchblade trigger the artifact, and \nmake a laser like beam come out of it, slashing a hole through the \nside of the Predacon base, and slicing by Owlhawk, Megatron, Tyrael, \n(and some others?)\n\n-- Megatron --\n\nMegatron&#39;s energon axe was poised to come down on Tyrael as \nOwlhawk&#39;s plasma cannon flared out of know where, smashing into his \nshoulder, knocking him to the ground. \n\n&quot;Ahh yes...&quot; says Megatron to himself as he gets up, &quot;It seems this \nMaximal has Predacon tendancies. That was a brillian backstab.&quot; He \nwinces as his checks the damage to his left arm. Still functional.\n\n&quot;In that case, I&#39;d be flattered to play with him.&quot; Megatron&#39;s \nweapons phase out of subspace and the target Owlhawk. He immediately \nlaunches a rocket, followed by two plasma blasts.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Owlhawk finally arrives at the Pred base.
