Its optics flickered on. This was no\n&gt; longer the body of RebelYell. It now belonged to the\n&gt; revived Maximal Sideswipe. Sideswipe shook his head\n&gt; from side to side, trying to throw off his feeling of\n&gt; grogginess.He looked down at his sleek new black body.\n&gt; &quot;By the Matrix!&quot; he said softly.&quot;What happened to me?&quot;\n&gt; The last thing he knew he was being blasted by\n&gt; Megastorm. Now he found himself in a body that was not\n&gt; his own.Just then he noticed the sound of weapons\n&gt; fire.\n&gt; He looked up. He recognized that ship. It was the Ark,\n&gt; and it was under heavy attack. He picked up the chain\n&gt; gun and laser rifle that were still lying on the\n&gt; ground and rushed off to join the battle.\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
