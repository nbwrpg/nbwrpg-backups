Under normal circumstances, a transformer&#39;s spark would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merely be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished after its energy dropped to a level where the spark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; longer maintain cohesion. However it appeared that someone had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intentionally routed an energy conduit directly from her\n&gt; mouth right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; battery-like object next to her spark; allowing her to feast on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sparks to keep her own intact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether this had been done as a temporary measure to keep\n&gt; her alive,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means to make her kill, and kill often; the Bushido Predecons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sustain her needs for energy even if they emptied all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prisons in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Valley Mine Pentatron. Celeron estimated that she would have had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to eat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approximately one spark every two days and that the battery\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sustain a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charge of at least 4 sparks, giving her a little over a week or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about 200\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; megacycles to roam before needing to kill again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *From the data, he determined two things:*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. He would first need to generation some sort of substitute\n&gt; energon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to feed into her spark so she wouldn&#39;t need to eat other\n&gt; people&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sparks and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he could keep her well-fed while he tried to come up with a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. He would eventually need to figure out where this leak\n&gt; was and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repair it;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then finally removing the conduits that allowed her to eat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sparks in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He had never done surgery, but it didn&#39;t really bother him\n&gt; that he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working on a living being. Perhaps he might even have the time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some, &quot;enhancements&quot; to her design, that is, if Kratos would let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him.
