The grappling gun pokes out\nfrom\n&gt; his mouth as he sees the little bots scurrying about on the surface. This\n&gt; plases him, because he could swoop down and possbile eat one of them.\n&gt;     Something in the distance shines in his eyes. Its one of the Ark&#39;s\n&gt; support beams. It stands there mocking him. A challenge. If he were to\nknock\n&gt; the support down, the entire front of the Ark would collapse.\n&gt;     &quot;AH, I have foreseen your demise Maximals! The Ark shall be\ndestroyed!&quot;\n&gt; He said, his body coiling and curving like a serphant.\n&gt;     Finally he swooped from the sky, his body ridged like a missle that\nwould\n&gt; destroy the Ark. His grappling gun sent a spitfire of bullets hailing down\non\n&gt; the warriors below as he got closer to the Ark.\n&gt;     Now, be neath the body of the vessle, he saw the support beam. It\n&gt; strained under the weight of the ship. Most of the others had already\nfallen\n&gt; or been destroyed. This was the conerstone to the Ark. And now it was\nAdrax&#39;s.\n&gt;     He coiled his long spiked body around the support, and then began to\n&gt; squeeze like a snake would squeeze its prey. Harder and harder he could\nheat\n&gt; the iron graon under the pressure. Adrax began to jerk his body, pulling\nthe\n&gt; pole in a different direction. He jerked agian, and agian. The pole began\nto\n&gt; become crooked. Seeing at what he had done, he slipped off the beam and\ntook\n&gt; a look at it. Now it was bent severly. Just a little more work and it\nwould\n&gt; collapse.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Black Aracnia shighed as she took the Comm unit to talk into once\nagian.\n&gt; She picked up on Atma. &quot;Listen, Atma. We need good warriors like yourself.\n&gt; Without you we could have never repelled the attack from the Maximals\n&gt; earlier. In fact, thats why were attacking the Ark now. To punish them. We\n&gt; are better than them, you are far superior to them Atma. Please dont\nleave.\n&gt; Come home, to where you belong.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
