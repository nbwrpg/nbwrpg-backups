The\nonly thing hol=\r\nding him back is the stasis cuffs, and now the sedation,\nboth of which whic=\r\nh keep his higher cerebral functions offline,\nholding him in an unconscious=\r\n state.\n\nAs Kup and Perceptor worked, they could see another soldier, Torca=\r\n was\nwalking passed the room.\n(http://tfu.info/1998/Maximal/Torca/torca.htm=\r\n).
