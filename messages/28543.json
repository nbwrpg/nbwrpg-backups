He looks back at Ignatius.\n\n&quot;They wouldn&#39;t terminate Prebon, but they might not know who he is. \nThey might try to reprogram him.&quot;\n\nHe looks back as the computer beeps, watching weapon stats come up on \nscreen. The weapon he had been looking for had been found. Even \nthough Slayer didn&#39;t know it, it was the weapon that had been used to \nconvert Spears to a Trainer. It shot chips that stunned the bot and \nthen gradually reprogrammed him into Prebon&#39;s slave.\n\n&quot;I think this is what we&#39;ll need,&quot; Slayer says, reading the \nspecs, &quot;It was originally meant to be used by a gestalt, but I think \nwe can modify it to be carried by two bots. I doubt the technology \ninvolved can be shrunk small enough for one bot to carry it.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ignatius was hurt but his internal repairs were compensating \nnicely. &quot;I&#39;ll\n&gt; be fine, what do you need me to do?&quot; he stared at the transmetal \nbot, almost\n&gt; amazed on how strong he was. &quot;I&#39;d bet that Prebons still alive, no \nfaction\n&gt; would destroy such a high level hostage.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
