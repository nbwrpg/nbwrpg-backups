If we can bring it into play, their firepower \n&gt; advantage will be negated.  And its cloaking ability is quite useful \n&gt; for setting traps.&quot;  Devilcat smiles as an idea strikes him.  &quot;That \n&gt; could be used to our advantage here as well.  If the enemy comes \n&gt; expecting the defense capabilities of one starship and they are met \n&gt; with two, it will make a mess of their attack plans.  Too bad it \n&gt; would only work once.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil nods hesitatingly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: Establishing a good defense would allow our forces to\n&gt; &gt; destroy any attackers, but we would then need to root them out,\n&gt; &gt; whoever attacks first. In this case, The maximals could hold the \n&gt; line\n&gt; &gt; here while the Rogues go and destroy the remaining attackers at \n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt; base. The preds tend to strike with all forces, but I don&#39;t know \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; the Tripreds. Besides, their ship seemed to be quite well defended.\n&gt; &gt; That would be very hard.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I understand that the Tripreds are much more dangerous,&quot; \n&gt; Devilcat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; points out.  &quot;But harsh experience has taught me never to \n&gt; discount an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opposing force, no matter how weak it may seem.  If we focus all \n&gt; our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attention on the Tripredacus forces, Hydras is free to strike as \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chooses.  And I know from doing it myself how devastating that \n&gt; tactic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is when done properly.  A better plan would be to wait for one or \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other to make a move, then counter it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: Alright, but remember I have to talk to you as one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; officer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil looked at Devilcat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: I don&#39;t want the Tripreds to take hold here, but I \n&gt; hope \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see why they are the real threat, not the Preds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus gets up, looking to the guests on the otherside of \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; desk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: If you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to go deal with \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pod\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem.
