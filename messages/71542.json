Whatever it is, it shall come \n&gt; to\n&gt; pass.  We have already changed that, alas.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Continuing, &quot;What we know of the future, already in doubt.  We&#39;ve done too\n&gt; much here to reset it about.  If the Decepticons shall do it, the \n&gt; Predacons\n&gt; are wrong, then perhaps we have to fight them, with our own sort of song.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pointing over at one of the auxiliary screens of Teletraan One, &quot;Cybertron\n&gt; exists here, at war and at peace.  Here in the past, they are starved for\n&gt; release.  Would it it not be so simple, to just send a message?  To the\n&gt; AUtobots there we can send a message of hope.  That Prime is still alive,\n&gt; the Matrix a trope.  Shockwave is a bureaucrat, useless, aghast.  Would we\n&gt; be able to turn things about from the past?  For Megatron wants to rule..\n&gt; Not Megatron that was, his own self to school.  So, he would not think of\n&gt; contacting Shockwave.  So we could send for reinforcements and change the\n&gt; war laudwave.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a slow nod from RODIMUS. &quot;Perhaps we can do something about\nthat.� He frowned thoughtfully. �If the Auobots knew where we were\nthey would have hope, and perhaps that could turn the war in our favor\neven back then. Perhaps they can win the battles they would not\nordinarily have won and the outcome would be different � for all of\nus.�\n\nThere was a straightening from Rodimus as he looked off in the\ndistance contemplating all the ramifications. �Maybe the humans would\nnever have to be put in danger and we could win the war.� He looked\nback at WHEELIE, �Optimus wouldn�t have to die.� He smiled. �And\nperhaps the golden age would still be in affect.�\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
