I&#39;m assuming the Mafia base\nhas\n&gt; similar shields to the other bases, but its your base. If you object, I&#39;ll\n&gt; void this post.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Bloodystrike/Reptilica::\n&gt;\n&gt; Reptilica dives out of the way, a few shots hitting him but the rest\nheading\n&gt; for the autogun that he had been firing at.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s get otta here!&quot; he yells to Bloodystrike, jumping away from the\nbase.\n&gt; He passes through the shield, most of his remaining armor melting away at\nthe\n&gt; energy. His jetpack sputters a bit before activating again, sending him\n&gt; flying, rather uncontrollably, in the direction of the Alliance base,\nbarely\n&gt; managing to stay conscious.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Bloodystrike yells in pain as he attempts, but fails, to completely dodge\n&gt; Sharpedge&#39;s sword. Following Reptilica&#39;s example, he jumps through the\n&gt; shield, taking off toward the Alliance base.\n&gt;\n&gt; Being less damaged, he gets through easier than Reptilica.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
