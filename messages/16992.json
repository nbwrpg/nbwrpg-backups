The\nmajority of her life had been spent on space colonies populated with\nartificial lights, food, and sometimes even intelligence. The vast colonies\nhad spanned great distances and harbored many raw materials in their day,\nbut have since fallen into disrepair and disuse many cycles ago.\n\nShe had been a guard, that much Tavatron could remember. The rest, however,\nwas extremely hazy. It was odd, she could never seem to remember much of her\npast beyond what had just happened. It bothered her considerably. There were\na few choice moments that, no matter how much time passed, she would never\nforget. With a heavy sigh Tavatron continued to brush the heavier amounts of\ndirt and dried mud from her fur. She could barely see her armor beneath the\nseemingly growing amounts of dust and grime. She greatly disliked looking\nand feeling like she had been run over by a tank &#39;bot.\n\nAs Dinobot made his way toward her and Foxfinger she began to ponder his\nquestion. She knew it wasn&#39;t one he expected an answer to, neither would\nshe. Still, sometimes it helped if one was offered some sort of an\nexplanation. There was still one thing she couldn&#39;t figure out, why did he\nwant to die? Wasn&#39;t he a warrior, and as such bound by his honor, as\nTavatron was by hers, to seek an honorable death? It confused her to no\nends, perhaps someday he would see fit to enlighten her. She fell in step\nbeside him as they made their way to the CF, she in robot mode and he in\nbeast mode:\n\n&quot;I suspect that you already know the answer, it is just a matter of coming\nto terms with it.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at\nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
