Wait there for now. When Cybershark returns, \ngo with him and find Megatron. Talk to him about the talks. But I \nhave to go. One of our new membres who you haven&#39;t met yet is lost in \nthe tunnels. I have to go find him. If you need to talk to me, leave \na message with Windrazor and Terradive here.&quot;\n\nVulois ran back down the tunnel, looking for Child.\n\n(Has anyone seen Shomin?)\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix\n\nBrix got up and looked at Ramulus.\n\n&quot;Thanks buddy. Now hold tight.&quot; Brix checked the timer: 4 minutes \nleft before the shuttle leaves. Time to hurt this guy.\n\nBrix went to Beast Mode, his gigantic centaur, with the torso of a \nhuman and the body of a horse. His palms opened up and shot laser \nbeams at Gekkidama&#39;s feet. Gekkidama rolled out of the way, got up, \nand started dancing. Brix than shot one in his chest, knocking him \nback down. Brix went over and picked him up, and placed his plam \nagainst the back of his neck.\n\n&quot;You know Gekkidama, the penalty for treason is death.&quot;\n\n&quot;So it maybe. But in my law, since I rule this moon now, is that \nabandonement of an officer is a lifetime imprisonment. Have fun, \nBrix.&quot;\n\nGekkidama quickly lifet his hand and shot three grenades(it&#39;s a built \nin one) towards the shuttle. Brix fired his palm, ending the life of \nthe psycotic Maximal warrior Gekkidama. But they had a new peril.\n\n&quot;Ramulus! Use your gun to deflect those shots! Quick!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
