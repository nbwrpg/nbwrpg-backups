I am with a group of several other Decepticons from the \nold times that have taken Predacon form to be able to move around with less \ndifficulty.&quot;\n\n&quot;We were thinking of obliterating you and taking over your operation, but we \nhave reconsidered our plot and decided it was faulty.  Instead we offer you a \ncompromise that may be beneficial to both parties.  We merge our groups, \nDecepticon and Predacon to form a new Empire.  The Neo Decepticon Empire.  \nWith your brute force and knowledge of the planet and most of the factions, \nand our sheer intellect and own power and knowledge, we will rule this little \nmudball and spread the reach of the Decepticon Empire to throughout the \nUniverse as was our goal millions of years ago.  But there are no longer \nAutobots to stop us.&quot;\n\n&quot;We have seen the Maximals in combat.  They are pathetic.  I predict a 45% \ndifficulty in our planned assault on Cybertron in two dozen stellar-cycles.  \nThe Alliance alones defeats the best Maximal technology.  We Decepticons know \nmore about Cybertron than the most &#39;brilliant&#39; Maximal scientists.  It would \nonly be logical for us to merge and crush all of them.&quot;\n\nShockwave held out his right hand to Hell Beast.  &quot;Do you accept our generous \noffer?&quot;  \n\n"}}
