The hsip rocked again. \nHe looked back and grabbed two large space mortars.  &#39;Might need \nthese&#39; he thought to himself.  He walked out, and saw JetV. &quot;JetV, \nwhere is PAcifix?&quot;\n\n&quot;W-What are you doing here, Crotale?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nevermind, somehtings wrong, I will explain later. LEad the way to \nPAcifix. &quot; \n\nJetV turned and rand down the hall the large bot behind him all the \nway,  into the main haul.  &quot;He&#39;s in there.  Pacifix, get up, wahts \nwrong with you.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Dion::\n&gt; \n&gt; Dion growls at Grimlock&#39;s back, his spark still pounding with the \nenergy that he&#39;d prepared for a fight. Being a drunk for the last \nwhile of his life, he&#39;d been in many barfights, and enjoyed them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dion turns his back and walks off, down the hallway, forgetting \nabout Crotale. Rubbing his fist, he was surprised to discover that he \nfelt respect for the Dinobot for responding to the punch that well.\n&gt; \n&gt; I gotta get to know him, he notes mentally, stopping and trying to \nremember where he was headed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The fist smashed in to Grimlocks face as he turned around.
