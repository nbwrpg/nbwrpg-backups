Because of\n&gt; that, they will be found by the Pacificus, the Bushidos=\r\n, the Silver\n&gt; Wings, or the Iron Skulls. The Watchers don&#39;t perform archeo=\r\nlogical\n&gt; searches; they have other business to tend to.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) We&#39;ll also=\r\n need to determine where the characters are reactivated.\n&gt; After all, it wi=\r\nll play a role in the reactions. Just imagine when\n&gt; they find out the new =\r\nbot in Olympus is a dreaded minion...\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) If the council decides the ra=\r\nndomness, how will their char\n&gt; distribution be random?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; This is an idea tha tI=\r\n have in order to increase the tention and\n&gt; creativity in this restart (to=\r\n name it some how). instead you choose\n&gt; the faction that you belong at fir=\r\nst, the election will be radmonly:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Example:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   1.. Let giv=\r\ne a Maxis number 1, Preds no 2, minions 3 and\n&gt; tripeducus 4. \n&gt; &gt;   2.. Yo=\r\nu won&#39;t know what&#39;s the faction name under the number. \n&gt; &gt;   3.. You will =\r\nsaid randmonly: Nighlight will go with number 3,\n&gt; Windlord with munber 2 a=\r\nnd Rodimus witn number 2. \n&gt; &gt;   4.. All chars that will survive and be fou=\r\nnd in stasis in Earth\n&gt; would be found by menbers whose belongs the number.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;   5.. You can do all rerprogramation and changes that wish.\n&gt; &gt; Why th=\r\nat? In order to burst creativity, tention and plots. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If a bot is =\r\nfounded by members of a rival faction, can you imagine\n&gt; what might happen?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course this is an idea \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Incase that this idea be apro=\r\nbed, council members will share the\n&gt; code and what number belongs to each =\r\nfaction each other,  and they\n&gt; will follow a similar proces. Same ida can =\r\nbe aplied to new chars made\n&gt; for the &#39;restart&#39; but just for this time. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; After Re-star runs, characters will goinf faction/creat one, as\n&gt; us=\r\nsually have done.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What do you think about this idea?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __=\r\n______________________________\n&gt; Yahoo!
