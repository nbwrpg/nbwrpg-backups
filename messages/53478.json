I am\n&gt; &gt; Ragnar of Clan Ghost Bear. I am a warrior and live as such. Besides,\n&gt; &gt; if all decepticons are even twice as powerful as what you seem to be,\n&gt; &gt; human from where come from would destroy them still very easily. Even\n&gt; &gt; though we are near the base, watch yourself. I can still see you as a\n&gt; &gt; threat and either make you an official prisoner or a dead feline.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was the sound of a dreadful gauss rifle loading. His tone was\n&gt; &gt; without discussion and his face told he would not tolerate it anymore.\n&gt; &gt; He was way bigger than her and would easily crush her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; her optics narrowed. She didn&#39;t like that tone, as she growled to\nlet him \n&gt; know her distaste for the way he spoke to her. Alot was running\nthrough her \n&gt; memory & meta processor or as it was more of a mind now. But she\nwould just \n&gt; try & cooperate. She knew that she had landed into a mess. & some\nhow she had \n&gt; to get out of it. \n&gt; \n&gt; She was thinking. she supposed that she would be a prisoner. She\nwould never \n&gt; have the freedom she knew. She would be trapped, like she had been\nin the \n&gt; past. She sighed. Oh, how she ached to return to what she knew. What\nshe was.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;How much father?&quot; She growled in annoyance.\n\n\n"}}
