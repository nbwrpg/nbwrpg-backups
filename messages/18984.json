Now listen. Destructor is with DarkMouse. I \nhave finished talking with Aracnia.  I have my suspisions as well, \nbut for now, we have other things to deal with.&quot;  she looked at the \ncomputer. &quot;I need to see if we can add an ace in our deck.  Would you \nbe so kind as to get me Megatron&#39;s spark from over there,&quot; she \npointed to the other counter,&quot; I will need that to make the clone \nfrom that spark.  I have a huntch that if I can make a good clone of \nMegatron, then we will have the upper hand later on.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois woke up to see Battera staring at him. He remembered her \nfrom \n&gt; the base, and remembered he hit her. He looked around and saw they \n&gt; were in a cave, and wondered how he got here. He pulled out his gun \n&gt; and stuck it to her head.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Where did you take me, filth?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream tracked down KitKat and walked into the DNA room, \nneeding \n&gt; to speak with her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Listen KitKat, Arachnia is a fraud. You have to be carefull with \n&gt; this. I was talking to that mouse. When we found her, she was \ntalking \n&gt; to Inferno. Now Inferno works for Megatron. But he told her to go \nand \n&gt; join Black Arachnia. Now why would Inferno tell a bot to join the \n&gt; enenmy? He wouldn&#39;t. He would tell a bot to join a group that had a \n&gt; treaty with Megatron. What if Black Arachnia really serves \nMegatron, \n&gt; and wants him to rule all Predacons? What if she&#39;s only joining us \nto \n&gt; send info on our decisions back to Megatron? Even worse, now that \n&gt; you&#39;ve made the council, she could make sure we make the wrong \n&gt; decisions and fall into Megatrons trap? What if she costs us our \n&gt; freedom?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix and Fliq watched the Ark be destroyed, all of their work with \nit.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No...&quot; said Brix, &quot;Not now. Not after all that trouble going to \nthe \n&gt; moon, Fliq almost dying, me killing Gekkidama to get those parts, \nALL \n&gt; FOR NOTHING! NO!!!!!&quot; Suddenly a large spark exploded in Brix&#39;s \nhead. \n&gt; The extreme rage he experienced brought his other persona, Bronco, \nto \n&gt; a new level. It took control of everything, and wouldn&#39;t even let \n&gt; Brix stay in the back. Brix slowly fell into the depths of the sub-\n&gt; consious, and died. Only Bronco remained, and now that he had full \n&gt; control, he could do what he wanted. Execpt it caused his own \ndemise.\n&gt; In his deranged state, he whipped his launcher around. When it was \n&gt; pointed at his feet, he fired, killing him instantly, and sending \n&gt; Fliq flying. Fliq crawled back to the lifeless body.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Brix....no&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq began to weep.\n&gt; \n&gt; (When they came back from the moon, I kept thinking what new \n&gt; storyline I coud give them. I&#39;ve been wanting to bring in a new \nchar, \n&gt; but I wanted to even it out by killing one too. So now Brix is \ndead, \n&gt; and Fliq&#39;s story is the whole depression thing. He may even end up \n&gt; turning on the Maximals.)\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Tamron took most of the shots, tiny pockets of mech fluid started \nto \n&gt; seep through. He saw the great light rise in the sky, and knew it \n&gt; easily. He thought to himself:\n&gt; \n&gt; Ultra Magnus. What a surprise! But there&#39;s no way we can stay here. \n&gt; There are too many opponents. But in destroying the Ark, we have \nbeen \n&gt; given an ace, and we will store it in our sleeve. As I have long \n&gt; suspected, Spears has been held at another Maximal Base. We will \n&gt; monitor these Maximals, and when they send a representitive to the \n&gt; base, we will track it&#39;s course and know where Spears is being held.\n&gt; \n&gt; He called out loud:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Slayer! Savage! Return to base! New plan!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tamron and Savage took off for the Trainer base.\n\n\n"}}
