He=\r\n says nothing as he listens intently to the message.\n\n&quot; Greetings, Legacy, =\r\nthis is Autobot Tucson responding to your message.  I have been on leave du=\r\ne to severe damages taken during a battle some time ago, which have left pa=\r\nrt of my memory erased. I - am now with Lord Perseus&#39;s Maximal group, in re=\r\ncovery from another damage taken in battle.&quot;\n\nHe sighs.\n\n&quot;Sorry, - I&#39;m - ju=\r\nst not a hundred percent at the - moment.  Anyway, you may be able to answe=\r\nr this question for me.  I - need to know, if - there are - any remaining A=\r\nutobots still functioning.&quot;  \n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;supercyclonus=\r\n&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Deep inside the ancient ship called the Ar=\r\nk, most of the power has been shut down into power conservation mode. Much =\r\nof the ship&#39;s systems have been returned to either a defensive mode, turned=\r\n down so low so that millions of years from now the Autobots and Decepticon=\r\ns that rest here in in&#39;s heart will have the power to reawaken when the tim=\r\ne comes. \n&gt; \n&gt; However off to one side, inside one of the repair pods chamb=\r\ners, one that could possible have housed one of the tape sized transformers=\r\n a dim light blinks. It&#39;s a light that had been blinking for quite some tim=\r\ne, slowly, over the course of several months shifting from a crimson red, t=\r\no an amber, then yellow, and now for the first time it blinks once and then=\r\n turns a steady green. \n&gt; \n&gt; A pop and hiss can be heard as the door of the=\r\n pod clicks and then slides to the side. Inside the repair pod the cold cyc=\r\nlopean visage of its singular inhabitant can be just made out as smoke and =\r\nother repair fumes escape from the chamber and into the air of the surround=\r\ning room. The occupant&#39;s single optic blinks as the figure comes online and=\r\n then gleams a stead crimson hue as the figure jerks once and awakens fully=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; The deck plating clanks as the figure steps out and looks around, ta=\r\nking a moment to get its bearings. Everything appears to be alright, its cr=\r\nimson gaze seeming to pierce the darkness of this chamber with ease. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nA few steps takes the figure to a control panel that is posiioned off to on=\r\ne side. One that is obviously ot part of the original construction, but has=\r\n only been put here more recently. With a few deft touches it lights up and=\r\n with startling speed information began to scroll across it. A recording of=\r\n an Autobot transmission has been recorded, as well as strange sensor recor=\r\ndings that may possibly be minion activity. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Greetings Autobots and M=\r\naximals&quot; a cold voice transmited itself dually across Maximal and Autobot e=\r\nncrypted communication lines. &quot;This is Legacy, and I have reawakened. Do yo=\r\nu require assistance?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;TAG&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Legacy)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: please =\r\nnote that many of the Maximals/Autobots that participated in the big minion=\r\n battle that happened at the ark (about a year ago Real Time) may remember =\r\nLegacy, how he appeared seeming to know many strange things about people, p=\r\nrotected the Ark, was badly damaged in its defense and has not been heard f=\r\nrom . . . until now.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
