We have a five bot group right now, Destructor \nmakes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; six, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dollen and GoldenEye will be back soon theres eight add the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; alliance \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forces and we&#39;ll have a small army working with us, and then, \n&gt; &gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; followers will join us or fall before us, and Megatron will \nbe \n&gt; &gt; our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first victim.&quot; Phobias eyes lit up at the prospect of being \nthe \n&gt; &gt; bot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behind the bot who joined the forces of Predacon and \nAlliance, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the unknown shadow that the great leaders throughout history \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cast. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She thought about the situation.

BUt Megatron has to be delt with. As long as he \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we will never have a moment&#39;s rest.
