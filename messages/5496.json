He \ngrumbled as he saw it zip away. He had his tail up high, and targeting. He \nswayed it left and right, watching a handful of fish near-by his boulder. He \ntail hissed in frustration, having no luck.\n\nHe plunged his claw down again, and the fish scattered. He cursed in the \nPredacon language. He was so hungry. He watched after a few moments as the \nfish returned. He leaned his body closer over the edge of the boulder, \ntargeting percisely. He plunged his tail down into the water. He felt \nsomething in between the jaws of his tail. He pulled his tail up and found \nout that he had a catch.\n\nHe laughed and snapped his claws in victory. &quot;Ah got one!&quot; he called out. \n&quot;Ah got one!&quot; He turned his body to the side and threw the fish from his \ntail, to the shore. It was already limp.\n\nHe looked back down into the waters. He targeted his tail, and tried again. \nOne wasn&#39;t going to enough for him.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
