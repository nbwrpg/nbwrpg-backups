He remained still, waiting to see what Ice did next.\n\nLunarpine saw the break in the action and took advantage. He \ntransformed to his half wolf stage and dashed into the battle. \nFoxfingers rolled out and began scampering toward Lunarpine. \nLunarpine grabbed the fox and pulled him to safety.\n\nVeratis watched as the stalemate continued. The virus seemed to have \ngiven Razor Claw extra abilities too. He catalogued each movement and \neach technique. Both were changed thanks to him, and both were deadly.\n\n --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; (Actually, I can&#39;t remember how he transforms, but I&#39;ll take your \n&gt; work on it.)\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; She transformed into owl mode and flew up, and behind Razor Claw.  \n&gt; She pecked on his back. &quot;Leave the fox alone.
