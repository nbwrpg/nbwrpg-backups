Nobody at the \n&gt; CF can see him right now. He&#39;s with most of the Stunticons, \n&gt; Megatron, some wannabe Megatron ( =P ), Switchblade, \n&gt; Beastbox, Cyclonus. Nightstrike, Scourge(?), and Razorclaw (who \n&gt; is arriving soon). Oh, and Fireblade will get there soon too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Icedemon and Yan, I think that Autofire and Divebomb would have \n&gt; found Dark Scream &#39;bout now. Yan, do you want to post with \n&gt; Autofire? =)\n\n\n"}}
