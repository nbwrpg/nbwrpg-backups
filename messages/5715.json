The Predacons give us little oppertunity to do \nanything at all.&quot; She flew next to Lunarpine.\n&quot;This isn&#39;t a life that lead.  We aren&#39;t living. We are surviving. And that \nis all we are doing for the moment.  But if we survive for now, then \nsomeday, we can live.&quot; She turned and took one last look at the Ark.\n\n\n-----------Original Message-------\n&gt;From: cyberwolf4@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t get the chance to say hello&quot; Lunarpine said to Shadow Wing\n&gt;as they moved away,&quot;Now I&#39;m already saying goodbye.
