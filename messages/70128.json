He also had a question for Rodimus and this time narrows a coy brow.\n\n=\r\n&quot;And why do you keep working for Hydras?  The lowest slag on this planet, a=\r\nnd you still work for him as if he&#39;s some sort of deity.  At least I know w=\r\nho I serve and the one I serve is faithful.  More than I can say for your s=\r\no called leader who is just leading you by the front axle.  Oh yes, lowest =\r\nof the low, and he&#39;s probably gloating over the fact that he&#39;s successfully=\r\n captured two Autobot Leaders.  I could sense that in his voice Rodimus, I&#39;=\r\nm far from being a mindless piece of scrap.  So you keep asking me why I ha=\r\nven&#39;t given up, I&#39;ll keep asking you why you work for Hydras.  And I will N=\r\nOT give you an answer until you tell me yours.  Final, end of discussion.&quot;\n=\r\n\nHe gives his last statement with a very cold tone to his voice.  Something=\r\n Optimus Prime would have done if facing Megatron.  Then he remembers one m=\r\nore and with the same cold narrowing of a brow, he directs his head back to=\r\nward the direction of the sound.\n\n&quot; Because a quitter like you, isn&#39;t worth=\r\n telling the truth to.  That&#39;s what you are Rodimus, a quitter.  I&#39;m not sa=\r\nying it to be cold, I&#39;m telling it as it is.  Do you want to be known as a =\r\nturn tail?  If so, tell me.  But if you had any back frame what so ever, yo=\r\nu would get over your little bout of self pitty and you&#39;d get off your aft =\r\nand do something to turn your life around.  I&#39;m not falling for it Rodimus,=\r\n I am NOT falling through the cracks like you have.  If you want my help, I=\r\n&#39;ll be glad to give it to you, but YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME YOU HAVE THE COURAGE=\r\n TO GET OVER THIS, IF YOU DON&#39;T THEN I CAN NOT HELP YOU! THE MATRIX CAN NOT=\r\n HELP YOU!  PRIMUS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU!  AND MOST CERTAINLY, HYDRA=\r\nS DOESN&#39;T GIVE A SCRAP ABOUT YOU, SO HE&#39;S PRETTY CONTENT IN KEEPING YOU AS =\r\nHIS LITTLE PUPPET!&quot;\n\nHe hoped that by telling Rodimus as it was, he could s=\r\nnap him into realizing what damage he&#39;s doing to himself.  Tucson Prime was=\r\n very good at it, although his temper was something that he needed to work =\r\non.  He then turns his head away from the source of the sound.\n\n&quot; That&#39;s it=\r\n, I&#39;m tired of talking to you.  I&#39;ve told you as it is, you dont&#39; like it, =\r\nthat&#39;s tough scrap.&quot;\n\nIn Night Shift&#39;s cell, he senses the all clear, and g=\r\noes back to using ninjabot excercises with his hands, to try and make his w=\r\nrists a bit more limber in the restraints.  With a tiny pop, he&#39;s able to d=\r\nisjoint his own left wrist to the point where it appears much more flexible=\r\n than his right.  He maneuvers his fingers and his palm and compresses them=\r\n to the point where he can actually squeeze the hand through the restraint =\r\nto the point where he his hand slips out, without a sound.  He experiments =\r\nand does the same thing to put it back in.  \n\n&quot;I knew I&#39;d get it sooner or =\r\nlater.  Too bad I can&#39;t transmit ta Kup. I wonder if he knows this trick...=\r\n&quot;\n\nHe pops his wrist back into joint and keeps his hand inside the restrain=\r\nt.  He winces, seeing that the process did cause a slight bit of discomfort=\r\n.\n\n&quot;Ow.&quot;\n\nOutside, Quickstride and Rat Trap were getting tired of being und=\r\nerestimated and Rat Trap jumps off, dumping the junk as Quickstride maximiz=\r\nes into his robot form, with his large blast cannon over his shoulder.\n\n&quot; A=\r\nhh what the heck?  Shooting is much more fun anyway.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds, and =\r\ntakes out his own revolver.\n\n&quot;Yeah, easier on the aft too.&quot;  \n\nQuickstride =\r\nnarrows his eyes at Scourge he meant business.\n\n&quot; Time ta shoot the birdie!=\r\n C&#39;mon, make a shot, make a shot I dare ya!&quot; \n\n--- In nbwrpg@...=\r\nm, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: RODIMUS\n&gt; Location: =\r\nBlack Fortress - Prison cell control room\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson Prime knew he had h=\r\nis work cut out for him. It wouldn&#39;t be easy attempting to turn Rodimus aro=\r\nund. He simply sighs, and does not give anyone the satisfaction of losing h=\r\nis temper. The less he expressed his disdain, the more he hoped to cause a =\r\nbit of frustration among his captives. He had an old saying. &quot;Don&#39;t get mad=\r\n, use your strongest of attributes and talents to passively retaliate again=\r\nst your enemies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ohh well, I may be in trouble for a while, and it=\r\n wouldn&#39;t be the first time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus stepped into the control room as=\r\n Tuscon was making his\n&gt; comment. While the others in the cells could not h=\r\near each other,\n&gt; Rodimus could each one of them if he chose to.\n&gt; \n&gt; He gl=\r\nanced at the security screen to watch Tuscon, laying there\n&gt; practically im=\r\nmobile by the restraints, and yet he was still trying to\n&gt; speak. Part of R=\r\nodimus was disdainful of the Autobot, but then again\n&gt; there was something =\r\nabout his courage and conviction that touched him\n&gt; strangely.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fightin=\r\ng that emotion Rodimus jabbed on the control stud that would\n&gt; send his voi=\r\nce down to Tuscon, into the speaker by his ear. &quot;What have\n&gt; you to say for=\r\n yourself now Autobot?&quot; Rodimus said as he watched him.\n&gt; &quot;You have lost, w=\r\nhy don&#39;t you just give up?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
