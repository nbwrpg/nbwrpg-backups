It keeps delaying my posts!\n\n* Though wounded and weakening she faught to keep the SBM active even though\nit wanted to shut down and return her to an undamaged robot mode.\nIf she converted now she would be weaker anyway and then in risk of being\nhurt more.\nHer legs had been knocked out from under her and now she lay on the ground,\nbreathing heavily but not willing to give up.\nWith a burst of might she heaved with every muscle she had, trying to rise\nto her feet. But Marien&#39;s sword caught her in the neck, cutting deep but the\nadvancment on this mode prevented him from doing any real damage. Instead it\nannoyed her enough to swing her head at him and emit a piercing scream, at a\nfrequency that could shatter glass.\nBut the scream was stopped short by the feeling of skin peeling again when\nOminous and Quasar fired.\nCurcuits were visible this time as the fireball from the impact disappeared,\nyellow gew oozing onto the ground. Dare anyone step in it then would be\nwalking on acid.\nTrying desperetly this time she heaved, her back feet gaining ground but\nsending her chin tinting into the soil before pushing with her front limbs\nand standing shakily on all fours.\nWhy did this have to be happening, why couldn&#39;t they all just leave them\nalone?!\nHer body shook but this time with rage, jaw clenched.\nHer hands dug into the ground before she heard Jackle giggle, snarling with\nabsolute rage and with all that behind her she was right infront of him\nbefore anyone could realize that she&#39;d move at all.\nAnger, frustration all building, and Jackle was the one who it was going to\nbe taken out on.\nHer hands flew forward to knock him to the ground before her neck sent her\nhead down towards his chest, jaws open.*\n\nAP:* With such a quick movement, Prowl missed her completely.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
