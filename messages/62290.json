He took a deep breath, and opened it.  Inside, Wolfblade was fast asleep on the bed, the cargo net still hanging on one wall.  He quietly stepped in, and shut the door behind him.  He walked over to the bed and slowly sat down, Wolfblade stirred a little, rolling onto her back.  He smiled a little, it seemed like smiling was a lost luxury.  He gently rested a hand on her shoulder and shook very gently.\n \n&quot;Wolfblade, it&#39;s time to wake up.&quot;\n \nThe femme stirred, and went back to sleep.  Malice shook her shoulder again, and this time she woke up.  At first she could not believe her optics, she sat up and touched his face, and once she had convinced herself he was real, she threw her arms around his neck and cried.  And cried, and cried.  She was so happy he had returned, it was like all her dreams came true at once, and in a way, they did.  \n \n&quot;I missed you!&quot; she said in between sobs.\n \n&quot;I missed you too, I thought I might never get to see you again,&quot; Malice said, holding her close.\n \n&quot;What happened, how were you able to escape?  I thought you were brain washed,&quot; Wolfblade asked, pushing herself back look him in the face.\n \n&quot;I was, and I have to tell you something, it&#39;s important, and I want you to understand how I feel about this.&quot;\n \nThe femme cupped his face and looked deep into his crimson optics.  She searched in them for what he was about to tell her, and she gasped.\n \n&quot;You fell out of love with me,&quot; she said, new tears welling up in the corners of her optics.\n \n&quot;No!  That&#39;s not it!  I do love you, but when I was brainwashed, it was like there was another me, one that fell in love, with one of the minions.  And when the brainwash was removed, i found myself in love with you and her.  Please understand, I don&#39;t want to hurt either of you, but I don&#39;t know if I can go on loving two.  Could you ever find it in your spark-&quot;\n \nMalice was cut off when Wolfblade put a hand over his mouth, trying to fight back the tears.  She could not let him go, he was the first male she had ever allowed herself to fall in love with, she would not let him go for anything.\n \n&quot;No.....no..no.  I won&#39;t let you go, I love you too much to lose you again,&quot; she said through the tears, &quot;I&#39;ll share you with another, but I will *not* let you go, for any reason.  I&#39;ll share you before I lose you.  I can accept that better.&quot;\n \nMalice sighed, then pulled her hand away from his mouth.\n \n&quot;Okay then.  I&#39;ll tell her when she wakes up.  I just hope she will accept it.  So please don&#39;t tease her or try to get her angry, she wants to stay, so do I, so please, try to cooperate.&quot;\n \nWolfblade smiled and chuckled a little.  She leaned forward and kissed him, and pulled back slightly to say something with a devios smirk.\n \n&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; she said, making him chuckle.\n \n&quot;I see how it is.  Just don&#39;t get her mad, she&#39;s having it tough anyway.&quot;\n \nThey sat and quietly talked for hours, both relieved in his returning, and hoping Blacknightmare would understand and try to cooperate.  Whether she liked it or not, her relationship with Malice was the only thing keeping her here, and if she didn&#39;t try to play by the rules, she may have to leave.  Malice was sure that they could make it work, but only time would be able to tell.\n\nAirly &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\nBlacknightmare:\n \nThe femme nodded and did him a quick kiss, then she moved to her new room\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: robert riley \nTo: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Friday, November 12, 2004 7:43 PM\nSubject: Re: Moving\n\n\nMalice:  \n \nThey find one of few empty rooms and Malice opens it.\n \n&quot;I guess this one will do.
