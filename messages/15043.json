She whimpered at the pain in \nher ribs when he lifted her up. Her legs where pretty well banged \nup.  She was covered in scraped and cuts.  She lifted her head \nslightly and looked at Atma. &quot;Forgive me, what was your question?&quot;\n\nShe was having trouble breathing.  Her chest hurt with every breath. \nShe gasped a few times and caughed real hard.  She growled at the \npain running through her body.  She closed her eyes for a few moments \ntto at wonder how the Matrix seamed to have it in for her lately.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; DrillBit looked at KitKat.\n&gt; &quot;Most of everyone is scattered around here.
