But I have to stay here. If you wanna look at the \nArk I&#39;m sure the ship logs have the info you&#39;ll need on it. All you would \nneed to do is defend it if it fell under attack and protect the repair crew \nas they worked. Nothing more.&quot;\n\n* She then looked up in time to see Silverbolt walk into the room, wondering \njust what he was there for.\nBut when she hears him speak she simply leanes back a bit.*\n\n&quot; Well, I wouldn&#39;t mind if you also helped defend the Ark when I send the \nrepair team to it. But it won&#39;t be for a bit.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
