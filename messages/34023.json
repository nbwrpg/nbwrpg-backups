The char\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regulations apply on the 12th (so you guys have 6 days to kill\n&gt; &gt; off any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; additional chars you have). The other rules come in effect NOW.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Everyone, go read the rules! We&#39;ll be hunting down and punishing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violators like crazy, so be sure to follow them :-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All you peeps who were complainin&#39; about the char limit, we made\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slight exception for you, though it&#39;s hard work. Anyways, check\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out, read carefully, and obey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS. Anyone who is not planning to have more than 16 chars, this\n&gt; &gt; battle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a good opportunity to get a few of them killed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
