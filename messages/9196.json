He quickly dimed his \noptics as his head rushed. He groaned deeply. Besides the pain in his head, \nhe wasn&#39;t in a very comfortable position. He leaned over, and nearly lost \nhis balance, despite being seated. He put his legs out to the side which \nmade things a little better.\n\n&quot;Tarnation,&quot; he mumbled while opening his eyes again. He saw Stingtra and \nKitKat. He struggled to stand up and get his balance. He stepped out leaned \nheavily on the side of the chamber. He held his head.\n\n&quot;Ah got th&#39; worst headache and ah&#39;m dizzy,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Tired too.&quot; he \nadded. He felt like he was going to pass out. &quot;Ah&#39;m gonna lie down.&quot; He \nwalked off into the main section of the room.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
