He calmly listens to Ominous&#39; words. Zardus knew the bot was \nplaying on his ego, but Ominous did seem to know what he was talking \nabout.\n\n&quot;The Maximals are currently being neutralized by my forces,&quot; Zardus \nsays, thinking Ominous&#39;s offer over. &quot;I&#39;ll have to discuss it with the \nrest of the Alliance.&quot;\n\nUnlike some of the Predacon leaders, Zardus knew that without his \nteam&#39;s support he wouldn&#39;t have any power, and forcing them to extract \ntheir sparks could really put a flaw in that support.\n\n&quot;But your plan leads to the destruction of yourself and all of us as \nwell,&quot; the Alliance commander points out, &quot;Without the Autobots and \nthe Decepticons, the Predacons and Maximals wouldn&#39;t exist, therefore \nme and my team wouldn&#39;t exist either. I&#39;m not totaly sure about your \nhistory, but I&#39;m fairly sure that it had something to do with the \nPredacons. If that part of your past is deleted, things might turn out \nvery differently.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Ominous sat next to Akron, across from Zardus and got right \nto it. He \n&gt; began tapping his fingers on the table top, sending streams of \nEnergon \n&gt; electricity across it, lighting the rather dim room in a faint blue.\n&gt;       &quot;How would you like to get rid of the Maximals, the Predacons, \nand all \n&gt; of your enemies, and even the humans? I can do it, very easily too.&quot; \nHe \n&gt; slammed his fist onto the table as he emphisized very, and that sent \nmore \n&gt; streams of energy across the table top.\n&gt;       &quot;What I propose is this....In several weeks the Volcano my \nvessle is \n&gt; resting under will explode, sending a rather large ash cloud into \nthe sky. \n&gt; What I plan is to fil lthe volcano with energon. When it finally \nerrupts it \n&gt; will send the melted energon particles into the sky, and from there \nit will \n&gt; spread across the globe. I predict in two months, after it rains, \nand snows, \n&gt; and such, the earth will resemble a rock placed in a tub of acid. \nAll plant \n&gt; and animal life will have been destroyed, the ocean will be turned \ninto a \n&gt; harsh chemical, and the sky will be ash. Nothing will survive. And \nas you \n&gt; know, energon kills transformers. When it dose get into the \natmosphere, it \n&gt; wouldnt be long before your kind dies out from it. You vessles can \nonly \n&gt; withstand so much...and then your dead.&quot;\n&gt;       Ominous trailed off, raising his arm and allowing a bolt to \nslither its \n&gt; way up into his shoulder. Akron sat, motionless, watching Ominous \nwith those \n&gt; pink eyes.\n&gt;       &quot;All I want from you is to ensure that Megatron, and the \nMaximals, and \n&gt; the other no name rag tag factions dont try and stop me. \nAnd....also....to do \n&gt; this you and your men would have to be converted. Your sparks would \nbe \n&gt; removed, your mech would be replaced with Liquid Energon....and you \nwould be \n&gt; reborn an Energonian, with all the abilities therein.&quot; He leaned \nback a \n&gt; little in his cair.\n&gt;       &quot;I know its asking alot....but just think, you will be one of \nthe first \n&gt; Energonians to rule Cybertron. Yes, you can have it after all the \n&gt; Transformers are dead, because once we rid the Ark of the Autobots \nand \n&gt; Decepticons, with the Energon atmosphere of course, there wont be \nmuch \n&gt; resistence on Cybertron. Meanwhile, I will further our species. \nProducing \n&gt; more and more Energonians.&quot; He concluded and folded his hands, \nsending \n&gt; another bolt up, over his arms, and into his shoulder.\n&gt;       &quot;What do you say Commander?&quot; His silver eyes narrowed a \nlittle. &quot;How \n&gt; would you like to be King of Cybertron?
