His \nmissle launcher flips over his shoulder and fires two missiles, both \nof them heading toward Angel Prime. The missiles locked on to Angel \nPrime&#39;s spark signature, flying toward him at a fast rate.\n\nKillfest activates his jetpack, flying after Angel Prime, though he \ncouldn&#39;t really see anything yet. But it didn&#39;t matter too much. The \nCF was almost on the other side of the planet. This Maximal would \nnever get there in time.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Argggggg! Damn, flash grenades!
