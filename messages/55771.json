I&#39;m sure we can spar & do some \ntarget \n&gt; practice.&quot; inwardly she would need it for the next time she met up \nwith \n&gt; Rodimus. She wanted to have a piece of him, to battle him \npersonally, to \n&gt; damage him but let him suffer until Hydras terminated him. \n&gt; \n&gt; She glanced back at Blackstorm & smirked. At least, the first \ntorture for \n&gt; Rodimus would be very sweet. Turning Blackstorm into a cold & \nvicious killer, \n&gt; with no trace of whatever she once was. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Perceptor informs me that you need a little practice as well. \nThough I don&#39;t \n&gt; call it practice.. but preparation. You are a fembot. A Predacon \nor \n&gt; Decepticon fembot at that.&quot; she started as they moved to find a \nsparring \n&gt; area, hopefully they had a room large enough. &quot;Decepticon fembots \nwere, & \n&gt; still are, vicious... shadowy.... emotionless... precise... \nlethal... \n&gt; assasins & warriors.&quot; She stopped & turned to Blackstorm. &quot;It&#39;s \ntime to count \n&gt; yourself as one of those few who could be worthy in the optics of \nMegatron.&quot; \n&gt; She deep femme voice resounded in confidence.\n\n\n"}}
