It&#39;s nothing really. Just a \nbunch of Maximals fighting a bunch of Predacons.  Nothing unusual \nabout that.&quot; She put her wing on the squirrels shoulder. &quot;So you have \nno clue as to what you are or who you are eh? Well, let&#39;s see. No \nsymbol. That means your undecided. That&#39;s good.  With no memory, that \nmeans your memory circuits got mixed up.  That I can help you with. \nBut later on. For now, since you have no name, I shall have to give \nyou one.&quot; She looked the animal over for a second. &quot;How&#39;s about \nTails. Yes, I think that will suit you nicely for now. Tails is what \nI name you.&quot; She transformed into bot mode.  She started to walk away \nwhen she noticed the squirrel didn&#39;t transform. &quot;Well, transform and \nwe shall get going before the battle lands on top of us.&quot; \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Danielle Laing &lt;sky_duv@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Frost&#39;s nickname is Tail&#39;s, so just nick her\n&gt; that...or whatever!\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; She stared at the creature in front of her.\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t KNOW my name exactly.
