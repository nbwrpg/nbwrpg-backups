Like him=\r\n, the sight of Dark Rodimus was enough to\n&gt; dim her trust in the real Rodim=\r\nus Prime as she remembers what had happened\n&gt; to him in the past.  She open=\r\ns a com link to Tucson directly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Tucson, it&#39;s me, look, I think ya mi=\r\nght have ta take leadership privileges\n&gt; away from Rodimus.  He&#39;s turned ev=\r\nil again.  And I don&#39;t think Nightshift or\n&gt; anyone else is gonna trust him=\r\n after this.
