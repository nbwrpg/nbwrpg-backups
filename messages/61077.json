Of\ncourse simply to be able to drain her Fortuneteller\nwould already have to have disabled her to the point\nwhere killing her would be a simple matter.\n\nShe smiled at Rodimus, making sure it didn&#39;t appear to\nbe an evil smile, that was what she would do.\n\n--- airly2000 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rodimus/Windlord:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HEY!!!
