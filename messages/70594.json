He draws up one of the missile barrels from his cab, and at=\r\ntatches it to his left arm.  He saves the second for later, just in case it=\r\n was needed.\n\n&quot; Time for a little pest control, Prime style.  All right Ves=\r\ntige, ready when you are, let&#39;s put these bugs in their place and get Rodim=\r\nus back.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =A0&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson knew deep down that Vestige was a p=\r\nart of Rodimus and that by relighting his spark, would hopefully rekindle t=\r\nhe spark in Rodimus as well. The exchange of energy was mysteriously not ta=\r\nxing on Tucson as it would have been if he had transfered his own spark ene=\r\nrgy into his chest. This was a power that was saved for many years in the h=\r\nopes that one day, it&#39;s energy would be needed for a greater purpose. This =\r\nwas that day. And as Vestige came alive, his heart felt all the more energi=\r\nzed as it filled endlessly with the joy of hope he had for his new friend.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I hope never to lose you my friend, you&#39;ve helped me in more ways=\r\n than I can describe. You&#39;ve given me new found hope that adversity can be =\r\novercome, and now I pass on that power of hope to you. We can do this, we w=\r\nill awaken Rodimus and through our compassion for each other, we may just b=\r\ne able to exterminate this enemy for good.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vesitige nodded=\r\n, for once his movements were not the movements of an\n&gt; old machine but one=\r\n that was new and vibrant, as if he stepped off the\n&gt; assembly line. Vestig=\r\ne slid out of Tuscon&#39;s cab and stood beside him,\n&gt; his body seemingly large=\r\nr and more imposing. He turned to look at\n&gt; Tuscon, a familiar rougish look=\r\n on his features, similar to one that\n&gt; Rodimus may have worn at different =\r\ntimes. &quot;Yes it is time.&quot; His voice\n&gt; grim and determined.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a deft =\r\nmovement and while being careful to keep his attacks away\n&gt; from the figure=\r\n on the table, he laid down some cover fire between he\n&gt; and the approachin=\r\ng insectoid alien creatures to give Tuscon time to\n&gt; transform or to do wha=\r\ntever thought he had in mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile the figure on the table contin=\r\nued to stir, it was as if it\n&gt; was fighting something. It was only then tha=\r\nt it became obvious that\n&gt; it was being held down by straps or tendrils. Th=\r\ne figure&#39;s movements\n&gt; were steadily getting weaker as it attempted to figh=\r\nt its way out.\n&gt; \n&gt; As all this was happening a persistant buzzing and even=\r\n a rumbling\n&gt; could be heard in the background. It would seem that the atta=\r\ncks had\n&gt; been noticed and something was comming!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
