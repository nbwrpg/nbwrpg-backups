He has only been here for a \n&gt; short time, but he has seen the leadership that Hell beast has \n&gt; displayed, or lack of.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s time for a new leader. And if what I think is up here, than we \n&gt; won&#39;t just have a new leader, we will have a new breed!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois flys up into a cave in the mountain and sees a huge pile of \n&gt; rocks. He starts uncovering them, when a huge Mountain Goat appears \n&gt; from behind him and trys to Ram him. Vulois blasts him before he has \n&gt; a chance.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Dumb sheep....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He continues to pull away at the Rocks, and he finds what he&#39;s \n&gt; looking for.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If I&#39;m right, this ball is a Transmetal 3 Driver! But how did it get \n&gt; here?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois touches it, and it shows him the mystery. It is back in the \n&gt; Beast Wars. Megatron is laughing. He has just used his Transmetal 2 \n&gt; driver to create a new Dino-Bot. But what&#39;s this? Someone is leaping \n&gt; into the beam. It&#39;s Cheetor! He jumps right into it and swats the \n&gt; driver away. But he is being filled with all this energy. It is doing \n&gt; something to his body. Now he seems to be choking on something. He&#39;s\n&gt; coughing up a Driver! This must be this one. the energy has enhanced \n&gt; it, and it&#39;s being flung towards this mountain. It hits the wall and \n&gt; all the rocks fall on it. The image ends.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois is amazed. This can be the turning point in the battle. But he \n&gt; doesn&#39;t know how to use it. He needs someone with brains. He sends a \n&gt; secret message to all Predacons except Hell Beats.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;To any predacon who is good with electronics and dislikes Hell \n&gt; Beast&#39;s leadership, come home in on my signal. We have business to \n&gt; discust that may change the face of the Neo Beast Wars!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois sits with the driver and waits for an answer.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Worldwide Calling with Firetalk!\n&gt; Click Here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5481/10/_/_/_/961535726/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
