It walks\n&gt; almost silently through the trees and bushes.  It smells a wolf near\n&gt; by.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s hunger knows no bounds and it is very hungery.  It follows the\n&gt; scent trail and passes an old pod.  It reaches up with it&#39;s paws and\n&gt; holds it&#39;s head up to look inside the pod.  It sniffs around and\n&gt; smells the scent of decay and old metal.  It nudges some remains of a\n&gt; bot with it&#39;s paw.  The torso of the bot crumbles and falls apart.\n&gt; The Tiger jumps back and growls.  It hits the pod with it&#39;s enormous\n&gt; paws and shakes the pod.  It roars and backs up a few paces.  It runs\n&gt; and rams into the pod, turning the pod over and dumping the remains\n&gt; of the bot on the ground.  The tiger walks around the pod and sees\n&gt; the remains on the ground.  It walks over and starts to knaw on the\n&gt; remains.\n&gt;\n&gt; When finished, the tiger sniffs the air and finds the scent of the\n&gt; wolf again. The tiger walks away from the pod and follows the trail\n&gt; of the wolf.\n&gt;\n&gt; (OK Lunarpine, you now have something following you. Watch out)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
