Though, she was \nlimping far \n&gt; more worse now then before.\n&gt; With a heaved sigh she simply moved towards Prowl again, not seeing \nthe hand \n&gt; he held out to touch her until it actually did.\n&gt; She flinched a bit but she was so tired she didn&#39;t care...as long \nas he \n&gt; didn&#39;t try and pick her up or anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; She whimpered a bit as she just stood there, looking at the floor. \nShe hurt \n&gt; and she didn&#39;t like it, and Prowl was hurt and she didn&#39;t like it.\n&gt; And most of all, she was so confused.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
