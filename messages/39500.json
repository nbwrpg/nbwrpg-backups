I&#39;ve been preparing my laptop for a hacker war, wish me luck :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyways, I&#39;ll split my chars among people a bit.

Here&#39;s your chance to make HotRod look competent for a change) :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nHedge - DevilDuer (don&#39;t make him act _too_ stupid).\n\n\n\n\n\nGunthers - Dion\n\n\n\n\n\nMegan - Prowl, Cyndro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat&#39;ll go into effect tomorrow. I&#39;m not sure if I can post today, but I&#39;ll try.\n\n\n"}}
