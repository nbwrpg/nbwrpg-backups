One for smaller audiences.\nShe sighed and opened her com-link to the new bot \n( Feline ).*\n\n\n&quot; Being 315, this is Iron Raptor, Maximal Commander. It seems as if you&#39;re in a restricted area, please report to me in Conference Room 6-3. We&#39;ll see if we can get you straightened out.Thank You.&quot;\n\n* With that she deactivated her com-link and exited the room, walking back up to the three bots. She expected the new bot to report to her as she was asked, while she dealt with this.\nIron Raptor looked at the three bots and sighed.*\n\n&quot; Thank you for waiting. Now, what is you needed to speak to me about?&quot;\r\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
