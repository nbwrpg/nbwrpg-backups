She opens a com link to Tu=\r\ncson directly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Tucson, it&#39;s me, look, I think=\r\n ya might have ta take leadership &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; privileges&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nway from Rodimus.  He&#39;s turned evil again.  And I don&#39;t think &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; Nightshift or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; anyone else is gonna trust him after this.  I=\r\n know I won&#39;t. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson gets her call while hol=\r\nding onto Noctorro, flying him back to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; where&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe other injured Fuzors are to stand guard until help got to them.  His&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; eyes narrow.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I was afraid of this,=\r\n Noctorro.  Rodimus has been taken again. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Shot is right, he can&#39;t be trusted.

In=\r\n the mean time, Rodimus has&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fallen back into evil hands and I=\r\n think it&#39;s best if he is barred from&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; leadership duties until=\r\n further notice.  I don&#39;t like being this harsh, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; right now he can&#39;t be trusted.
