Can you please have it land somewhere soon?\n\n::Killfest/Scyther/EndBringer/Demise/Incarcinator::\n\nKillfest makes his way through the corridors after they open for the attackers, emerging at the ruined bridge and seeing the comotion. He aims his missile launchers up at the scorpion bot and fires two missiles at him, sending a transmission to his troops.\n\n&quot;My troops are on their way,&quot; he says to Cygnar as his missile launcher reloads.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn the bridge of the Blackfortress, Scyther suddenly jumps up as he recieves an order from Killfest, bolting from the room.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer follows Prebon and the other bot a bit behind for a while, but then a transmission from Killfest interrups him, and he takes off toward the exit of the Blackfortress.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEmerging from the CR chamber, Incarcinator groans upon recieving Killfest&#39;s message. &quot;One battle after another..&quot;\n\nHe walks out of the base, flying off toward the Trainer base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise looks up at Starscream, burping a bit. &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; His eyes suddenly light up. &quot;Battle! I must go.&quot;\n\nHe gets back to his feet and runs out of the room as fast as his four appendages could carry him, thankful for Killfest&#39;s orders to get some battle in.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; :::The Destrocons:::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::they land near where Cygnar and Cyanide are standing::\n&gt; &gt; Ramjet: Hey, we got here first.
