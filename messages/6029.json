I mean,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you guys have me curious as to how a real professional assassin does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it right.&quot; She gave them her most sincere smile. &quot;Well, that is if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you have nothing better to do?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember four years of good friends, bad clothes, explosive chemistry\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5532/13/_/_/_/962925019/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Old school buds here:\n&gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5536/13/_/_/_/962951209/\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free, Unlimited Calls Anywhere!\n&gt; Conference in the whole family on the same call.\n&gt; Let the fights begin!
