He withdrew \n&gt; his clash sword knowing he was going to get a fight out of this. He \n&gt; stepped up to the entrance, catching the door before it closed. He \n&gt; paused for a moment to make sure it was safe for him. He waited \nuntil \n&gt; he thought the bots walked on into the base some more, then forced \n&gt; the door back, and squeezed in as much of his large body could fit. \n&gt; He held it with his foot, and fiddled with a panel on the side to \n&gt; make it hang open halfway. He stepped inside, looking around.\n\n\n"}}
