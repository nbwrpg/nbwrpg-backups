It didn&#39;t notice her, so she went closer and inspe=\r\ncted it. She looked around it, making notes of certain things.\n\n    Plintis=\r\nsa followed Artist out in the missle of no where in a desert. Artist turned=\r\n around and looked at Plintissa.\n\n    &quot;Plintissa now see Artist&#39;s secret tr=\r\neasure!&quot; Artist said. He smiled. Plintissa was stunned. Artist dug a little=\r\n in the sand, and brought up a hermit crab shell. Artist laughed and ran of=\r\nf laughing giddily. Plintissa sighed and turned back. No wait, maybe this w=\r\nay was back. No wait, that way. Plintissa realized she was lost, and that A=\r\nrtist was nowhere to be found. She looked around from left to right. Oh, wh=\r\nat was the use, she might as well be dead out on the desert anyhow, she obv=\r\niously wasn&#39;t needed, not even Dracona stuck around with her! She had thoug=\r\nht that Iron Raptor was her friend, but that blew up in her face. Then she =\r\nmade the mistake of trusting some bot sho said he would help her, and then =\r\nshe went off and nobody trusted her any longer. Plintissa walked off into t=\r\nhe distance, hoping to find her way home. Then it occured to her. She didn&#39;=\r\nt have a home. a single tear fell from Plintissa&#39;s eye and she walked on.\n\n=\r\n    Artist ran off into the distance and looked back joyfully. Plintissa wa=\r\nsn&#39;t there.\n\n    &quot;Yikes! I was supposed to protect her!&quot; Artist said. He ra=\r\nn back into the desert, darting quickly mile for mile, trying to find Plint=\r\nissa.\n\n    Gangon&#39;s spark glowed eerily and bumped into BrightBlade&#39;s hand.=\r\n\n\n    Sinesis and Sinister lay there, half dead with Sinister in pieces.\n\n =\r\n   Deemos figures out that this disgusting team must not be right for him a=\r\nnd he runs off, hoping maybe the Maximals would be good enough to let him a=\r\nnd his wife join and heal up. He ran along, going quickly, about 2 hours la=\r\nter he found the Maximal base. Inzola was in his arms in stasis lock and sp=\r\nitting out blood, she was bleeding internally.

He went run=\r\nning off. Blender and Stronghold shrugged, Stronghold staring into the dist=\r\nance and Blender scanning the area. Stranato and Train Wreck look at each o=\r\nther and gulp.
