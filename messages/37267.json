As for your troops in the base... they are\n&gt; expendable, I am expendable, you are expendable, all are expendable\n&gt; in the eyes of the Bamphomet. It is the only being that is not\n&gt; expendable. Therefore if your troops are in the base when it is\n&gt; destroyed, they will not be thought of for another second. Now will\n&gt; you help in destroying all in that base and the base itself and revel\n&gt; and the powers and gifts of the Bamphomet or shall you stand in our\n&gt; way and ultimately be obliterated?&quot;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Darkfate::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What luck!!!&quot; said Darkfate &quot;We&#39;re rescuing our allies from that\n&gt; &gt; base&#39;s stasis field... before I&#39;d have enough to trhow trainers out\n&gt; &gt; the area... but now I want... erm... destroy them... &quot; the male\n&gt; &gt; opened his comm link &quot;Do you have spark signature in order to my\n&gt; &gt; troops can know that we&#39;re working together...
