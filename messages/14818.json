Well, when I was evil, I stumbled \n&gt; across a TM3 driver, even stronger than TM2. Soundwave built the \n&gt; machine to use it. I&#39;m a TM3 right now. That&#39;s why I have so many \n&gt; tactics. Battera is a TM3, and so was Soundwave. We were the only \n&gt; ones ever to use the technology. I was caught trying to double-cross \n&gt; Hell Beast, and he took it from me. So now I.....LOOK! We&#39;re here!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois drops the equipment and looks around. A tear came to his eye. \n&gt; This was the first place he ever met Soundwave, after calling him to \n&gt; him. He sat down and cried, tears of joy and tears of Sadness.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Savage\n&gt; \n&gt; The quills get stuck in Savage&#39;s hide, and Striker&#39;s shots make huge \n&gt; gashes in Savage&#39;s skin. He yells out a roar of agony, big enough to \n&gt; be heard miles away. He looked at Striker and smelled. This bot had \n&gt; alot of him on him. This was the one he almost killed before. He sent \n&gt; two fireballs at each of them.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well...kinda,&quot; saiid Brix, &quot;But never a planet as beautiful as this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; They continued towards the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
