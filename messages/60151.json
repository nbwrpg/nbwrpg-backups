It was really a fighter with a long range booster.  It \n&gt; &gt; came online and accessed the booster&#39;s long range sensors.  It \n&gt; &gt; detected several things: multiple bases planet side, and the \n&gt; looming \n&gt; &gt; Unicron in high orbit.  The craft banke, and made way for the \nfar \n&gt; &gt; side of the planet, away from Unicron.  It skimmed across the \n&gt; &gt; atmosphere and then entered the atmosphere.  It was going to \ncome \n&gt; &gt; down somewhee between all the bases.  After re-entry, the \nbooster \n&gt; &gt; section jetisoned and the fighter spread its wings and touched \noff \n&gt; &gt; the engines.
