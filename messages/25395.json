Number two, there&#39;s a lockdown, and no way someone could just walk \nright into the CF, Maximal or not.  And Rhinox never went in before the \nlockdown or anything like that.  And if Angel Prime had a hologram, sensors \nwould detect it didn&#39;t have an energy signature pretty easily unless you said \nit had false sensor readings, Icedemon.
