I think \nhe is coming from our time, through the transwarp rift. The space \ngun is worth a shot but I have thought about the Matrix. We believe \nit&#39;s lost on cybertron. I want a multi-faction team to go after it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Polar Claw &lt;cycodrone@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Shadowcaster had observed everything quietly. He knew\n&gt; there was only one thing that could truly stop the\n&gt; madness inside Azure growing any larger- the very same\n&gt; thing that was their only hope of defeating Unicron.\n&gt; Turning away from Cheetor, he faced Deathstar. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Your plan is flawed Tripred. There is but one way to\n&gt; defeat Unicron.  If you had been alive to face this\n&gt; you would know this for yourself. As for you Rodimus,\n&gt; I am surprised. Considering that you yourself fought\n&gt; Unicron in the Earth year AD2005, I would have thought\n&gt; you of all Cybertronians woulde no that nothing short\n&gt; of the Matrix of Leadership will destroy the chaos\n&gt; bringer. However I warn all of you that if Unicron is\n&gt; Destroyed here, then the futurew will be errevocably\n&gt; changed. If Maximals and Predacons destroy Unicron\n&gt; here, resulting in them being from a future that never\n&gt; was, then the very space time continuum could destroy\n&gt; itself from the resulting paradox.  As for the\n&gt; location of the Matrix itself, my spark was sent from\n&gt; its resting place in the Matrix of your present day.\n&gt; Primus himself gave me its current location. I can\n&gt; tell you now though that you wont like the answer\n&gt; though Rodimus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadowcaster waits for a reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://personals.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
