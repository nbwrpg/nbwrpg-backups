He did not like it but he under=\r\nstood why Rodimus had to send him away.  This made him overheat with anger =\r\nas he makes it perfectly clear to Jhiaxus and the others that he was not ab=\r\nout to take any of their scrap parked in an idol position!  Yet, he does as=\r\n instructed and is lead to Perceptor via his thermal sensory board.  Night =\r\nShift helps him to navigate through the tunnels as they quickly reach Perce=\r\nptor.  Night Shift flings open his left door to allow Perceptor to ride in =\r\nhis cab.\n\n&quot;C&#39;mon, you did help us, now it&#39;s our turn ta return that favor. =\r\nWe&#39;re gettn&#39; outa here, but we ain&#39;t gonna leave ya down here.&quot;\n\nTucson Pri=\r\nme helps to gently put Windlord and Nightlight inside Night Shift&#39;s back se=\r\nats.\n\n&quot; We&#39;ll do as Rodimus says.  Everyone gets out, even you Perceptor.  =\r\nNight Shift is right, you helped us, now we help you.  Nightshift, get into=\r\n my trailer once everyone is aboard.  I have a feeling that the ride will b=\r\ne rough and I am more equipped to deal with rough roads than you are.&quot;\n\nNig=\r\nht Shift replies.\n\n&quot;Umm, hey, I got four wheel drive too, no sweat.&quot;\n\nTucso=\r\nn sighs.\n\n&quot; I know but this may be more than your system can handle.  I don=\r\n&#39;t want to risk anyone&#39;s saftey over something that could have been prevent=\r\ned. Now, as soon as we&#39;re all out safely, Night Shift, you take Windlord, N=\r\nightlight and Perceptor and make a B line for the Ark. I&#39;ll remain behind.&quot;=\r\n\n\nNight Shift knew there wasn&#39;t anything Tucson Prime could do.\n\n&quot; Uh, uh, =\r\nI think Rodimus told ya to go back for a good reason Sir.  Maybe it&#39;s time,=\r\n ya know?  New era, new Prime?  You&#39;re it now Tucson Prime, you&#39;re gonna be=\r\n our new hope for a better future.  And you&#39;re already don&#39; that.  Ohh yeah=\r\n, you&#39;re gonna be a legend, and I think Rodimus knows it.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime pa=\r\nuses for a moment, and then understands what Night Shift was telling him.\n\n=\r\n&quot; I just didn&#39;t think it would happen this soon Night Shift.  You&#39;re right.=\r\n  We&#39;ll all leave together and get everyone back to the Ark.&quot;\n\nIn another p=\r\nart of the tunnel system, Quick Stride, who was full of determination to ge=\r\nt at Deepstryke and the other seekers, falls for the lure, as Rat Trap trie=\r\ns desperately to go after him.\n\n&quot; Wait, I smell a rat, and it&#39;s not me!  Do=\r\nn&#39;t fall for it Quickstride!  IT&#39;S A TRAP!

A lot of it if not all of it, is=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; actually my fault. The day we fought off Hydras&#39;s lackies two years =\r\nago, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I had managed to deal with the ones I was fighting against and s=\r\naw that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you, Nightlight and Windlord were in desperate need of help. =\r\nSo I went as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; fast as I could, to try and divert enemy fire away from =\r\nyou, but I failed \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to check a blind spot in my rear view mirror, and I=\r\n was shot from behind, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rendering me inoperable and blind. If I had ju=\r\nst taken more careful \n&gt; &gt;&gt; survey of what was around me, none of this, inc=\r\nluding what happened to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you, would never have happened. Now, now is t=\r\nhe time to make it up to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you. We&#39;ll fight them together. Scorponok do=\r\nesn&#39;t scare me, none of them \n&gt; &gt;&gt; do. All right Jhiaxus, don&#39;t expect me t=\r\no make this easy for you because \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m not! As I&#39;ve said to Scorponok b=\r\nefore, I will not fold to any of you, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; no matter what damages you inst=\r\nill on me!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus almost smiled as Tuscon tried so hard to take th=\r\ne blame, or at\n&gt; &gt; least some of it. He shook his head slightly, &quot;Because y=\r\nou didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; check a blind spot all of this happened?&quot; Rodimus turned to l=\r\nook back\n&gt; &gt; at the oncoming Decepticons, &quot;No, no one can say that. I have =\r\nmy own\n&gt; &gt; blame to bear, but this time I will bear it rather than trying t=\r\no . .\n&gt; &gt; . &quot; Rodimus&#39; voice stopped mid sentence as he struggled with some=\r\nthing\n&gt; &gt; inside his head!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jhaxius smiled as he, Cyclonus and Scour=\r\nge walked foward, Cyclonus&#39;\n&gt; &gt; strides quickly bring him to the fore. &quot;Did=\r\n you think we did not have\n&gt; &gt; this in mind?&quot; Cyclonus said. &quot;Rodimus, as l=\r\nong as he lives will still\n&gt; &gt; belong to Hydras!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Behind Cyclonus, =\r\nJhiaxus was holding a device, a miniature version of\n&gt; &gt; what was used orig=\r\ninally to change Windlord and Rodimus into the evil\n&gt; &gt; versions of themsel=\r\nves.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes.&quot; Jhiaxus said, &quot;The original program had gone dormant bu=\r\nt still\n&gt; &gt; remained. It was only a matter of bringing the software back on=\r\nline.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus shook his head as he mouthed the word, &#39;NO&#39;. He held=\r\n his head\n&gt; &gt; and fell to his knees, his palms against his ears as if he we=\r\nre trying\n&gt; &gt; to block out voices that he was hearing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scorponok ch=\r\nuckled as he resumed his robot mode and he and Scourge\n&gt; &gt; brought up the r=\r\near, &quot;Yes Brother.&quot; Scorponok said to Rodimus, &quot;Come\n&gt; &gt; back to us, we nee=\r\nd you.&quot; his voice sarcastic and condescending.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; armor slowl=\r\ny began to blacken again and then shift red as if\n&gt; &gt; on fire. He glanced o=\r\nver at Tuscon, his optics still the amber of his\n&gt; &gt; Autobot upbringing, &quot;G=\r\net Nightlight . . . all of them out of here!&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; said, his voice hoarse=\r\n and intense, &quot;This must stop here, now!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus glanced at a mess=\r\nage that he received from Perceptor . .  .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;6 cycles - P.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Rodimus smiled as his armor shifted black again, &quot;Yes brother I hear\n&gt; &gt; y=\r\nou.&quot; Rodimus said as he began to walk forward. Behind his back he\n&gt; &gt; motio=\r\nn to Tuscon to go, &quot;GO!&quot; he said fiercely.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus stopped near the=\r\n device that Perceptor had planted, shielding\n&gt; &gt; it from the view of the D=\r\necepticons, &quot;Come &#39;brothers&#39;&quot; he said, &quot;We\n&gt; &gt; can end all this here and no=\r\nw.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
