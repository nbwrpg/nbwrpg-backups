Only time she allied with \nAutobots is when \n&gt; it was against the Quints... even Unicron on that fateful day. \nNothing more. \n&gt; She despised the Autobots. Hating them with a passion, loathing \nthem. Never \n&gt; forgiving them for what they had done. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Very well,&quot; stated so dry that it could be mistaken as annoyance. \n&gt; \n&gt; Time for a change of subject. She still had time to spare. Leaving \nthis base &\n&gt;  returning to Wheeljack & the others would still be a bad choice. \nA major \n&gt; mistake at that one. \n&gt; \n&gt; She stood there, silently. Watching him, waiting to see what would \nhappen \n&gt; next. Then her optics went to the bot. But her attention was still \non Hydras.\n\n\n"}}
