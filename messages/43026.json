She \ncouldn&#39;t figure out how hit maximal was following her so well. She \nhad done everything she could think of to loose him. Or her. She \nzigged and zagged around. She even went so far as to go over a \nwaterfall just so she could move and not leave tracks.  She swam a \nfew miles before reaching the banks. Water doesn&#39;t carry scent. \n&quot;How is this one so darn good?&quot; she muttered to herself. \n\nShe opened her commlink,&quot;Hey,Galvatron. Uh, I can&#39;t seem to get rid \nof this one. Mind lendning me a paw? I&#39;m roughly 30 miles from your \nship. I could use some help. This maximal is good who ever he is. \nHe&#39;s close to me. SO if you shoot, shoot to hit his signature, not \nmine.&quot;\n\nDespite the fact that anyone could really be listening in, she just \nwanted to see this bot and find out why he/she had been following \nher. Little did she know, she was asking for more trouble than she \nwould care to get into. \n\n\n"}}
