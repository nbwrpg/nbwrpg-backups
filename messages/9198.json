He quickly \ndimed his \n&gt; optics as his head rushed. He groaned deeply. Besides the pain in \nhis head, \n&gt; he wasn&#39;t in a very comfortable position. He leaned over, and \nnearly lost \n&gt; his balance, despite being seated. He put his legs out to the side \nwhich \n&gt; made things a little better.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tarnation,&quot; he mumbled while opening his eyes again. He saw \nStingtra and \n&gt; KitKat. He struggled to stand up and get his balance. He stepped \nout leaned \n&gt; heavily on the side of the chamber. He held his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ah got th&#39; worst headache and ah&#39;m dizzy,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Tired \ntoo.&quot; he \n&gt; added. He felt like he was going to pass out. &quot;Ah&#39;m gonna lie \ndown.&quot; He \n&gt; walked off into the main section of the room.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
