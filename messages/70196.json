But Tucson had gotten in \n&gt; once before, and in that time, his transmitter was able to act as an \n&gt; auditory GPS, which guided him through the tunnel.  He takes it off, since \n&gt; it&#39;s an external fixture to his helmet, and now programs that GPS system \n&gt; to guide Kup and Nightlight through the tunnel out to where Rat Trap and \n&gt; Quickstride were waiting for them.  He then hands it to Kup.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I forgot, I&#39;m sorry.  But this should help you to get through..  It will \n&gt; tell you everything you need to know.  When to turn right, left or go \n&gt; straight ahead until you reach Rat Trap and Quickstride outside.  It will \n&gt; adhere to any helmet, and it will stay fixed until you wish to take it off \n&gt; yourself.  I won&#39;t be needing it now that I can see.
