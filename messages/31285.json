Unfortunately,\nmost of\n&gt; the Maximals I have met so far have not given me a great feeling\nabout\n&gt; their cause&quot;. Then the CR chamber opens, and Beachcomber and\nFiredrill jump\n&gt; to their feet to meet their long time partner.\n&gt; \n&gt; The small red robot swaggers out off the chamber, &quot;ohhhhh my akin\nhead&quot; he\n&gt; musters. &quot;Cliffjumper, your alive&quot; blurts out Firedrill in\nhappiness, but\n&gt; realises now that all of his partners are up, that they need to do\n&gt; something. &quot;Come on Cliffjumper, Beachcomber, it&#39;s time for us to\ntake\n&gt; charge&quot;. They then start heading off in a random direction, since\nthey dont\n&gt; know their whareabouts. They lucky pass by the control room Iron\nRaptor is\n&gt; in.\n\n\n"}}
