His chest shoulders and arms are thick and broad and his legs\nwere powerfully built as well. A large cannon was position over one\nshoulder was mute testimony to the power that this creature held.\n\nTurning to look at HYDRAS there was a strange look in MEGASTORM&#39;s\noptics as he examined him. His optics looked at HYDRAS&#39; frame, his\nother heads as well as his PREDACON insignia.\n\n&quot;So you are a Predacon.&quot; MEGASTORM said, &quot;Have you come to swear\nloyalty to me or have you come to challenge my power?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
