She was deep \nin thought and didn&#39;t even hear him enter the lab. She looked at \nhim,&quot;Ahh! Oh..sorry. I didn&#39;t hear you apporach.&quot; She looked at the \nmonitor. &quot;No, still getting readings and compositions organized.  but \nso far, it looks like  Megatron just made an exact replica of \nhimself, minus the perfect skin color.  In the DNA sequence, it was \nmising a small genetic chomosome that would have given Megatron&#39;s \nclone the perfect color. But that&#39;s about it so far.  I still have a \nlong way to wait for the rest of the results.&quot;  She sighed and looked \nat the screen. Then back up at Destructor,&quot;Everything OK?&quot; her voice \nshowing her exhaustion.  She was tired, mentally and physically. But \nshe wanted to get the testing done and over with as soon as possable.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;   Destructor smiled as he saw the preds enter his base on the \nsecurity \n&gt; screen...&quot;I will make sure all have rooms.
