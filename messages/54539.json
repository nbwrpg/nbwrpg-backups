It would be quite a risk. However\nthis was their decision.\n&gt; Kup: If you really want to do this, then I say go for it.

She\ntakes a deep breath in and lets it out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: Simple enough, but risky. Vlad, Ragnar and I are humans stuck\n&gt; in mech shells. If the shell dissolves, then the human stays, quiaff?\n&gt; My idea would be to expose us three to the Plague and to isolate us in\n&gt; a plastic container. This way, we gain our human forms back and you\n&gt; are not harmed. The risky part is that I do not know how much we are\n&gt; fused with the mech bodies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: That is crazy! I will not allow you or any other to put\n&gt; their life in the line of such a disease! What if you are much more\n&gt; fused than you think? No, I disagree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya turns to Kup, her eyes almost begging him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: What do you think Kup?\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Kup : : \n&gt; \n&gt; Kup turns to face Katya. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: What? How? \n&gt; \n&gt; : : Rodimus Prime : : \n&gt; \n&gt; Just then, Rodimus comes in. What&#39;s the situation? Are we safe? \n&gt; \n&gt; Azure The Warrior &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil turns wearily. He had heard every bit of the conversation\n&gt; and he was not very enthusiastic either about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: The first thing we could try is to coat ourselves to\n&gt; protect us from that Plague. Some sort of Anti-rust. I want someone to\n&gt; check the databanks to know how the Autobots and Decepticons were\n&gt; affected and how they overcame it. If Wheeljack can, let him develop a\n&gt; vaccine. And Kup, send someone to get Rodimus. He is in the cargo bay\n&gt; looking for a pod, if I&#39;m right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya entered the office at the same moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: Wait! That disease you speak of could be our salvation! At\n&gt; least, it could be for Ragnar me and Vlad...\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Kup : : \n&gt; \n&gt; Kup looks out and sees the rusty haze for himself. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: Oh slag! Of all the damn things to happen... \n&gt; \n&gt; Kup slams his fist into a near by computer terminal, putting the ship\n&gt; on red alert. The alarms sound as the ship seals off, and the\n&gt; deflector shields activate. \n&gt; \n&gt; He then opens a comm to every Maximal in the base. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: This is security chief Kup. We have reason to believe that a very\n&gt; infections and lethal plague is airborn and heading this way. If you\n&gt; are infected you will not notice symptoms at first, but will later\n&gt; encounter small glitches, and eventually decay of rust. Do not leave\n&gt; the base untill informed otherwise. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kup runs for the Commanders office. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: Come with me Aerotaur. I guess the attack on the Predacons that\n&gt; Katya and I were planning will be delayed even more. \n&gt; \n&gt; He reaches the office and finds only Yggdrasil inside. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: Commander, I&#39;m sure you heard my report over the comm. I&#39;m not\n&gt; sure what to do. And where is Rodimus Prime? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Sponsor\n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo!
