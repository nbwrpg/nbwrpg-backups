She cursed when she saw no one\n&gt; attempting to fix them.\n&gt;     &quot;Computer, bring all systems online.&quot; Aracnia said, taking a seat in\nthe\n&gt; command chair.\n&gt;     &quot;Unable to respond. Invaders have tampered with schedual and procedure\n&gt; protocols.&quot; The computer chirped.\n&gt;     Black Aracnia paused for a moment, and then opened a compartment on\nthe\n&gt; arm of the command chair. Hell Beast left disks on the numerous functions\nof\n&gt; the ship, and tips on what to do in emergency. Aracnia went through them\n&gt; quickly until she found the system diagnostic. It would get the computer\nback\n&gt; up and running.\n&gt;     She inserted the disk and it went to work quickly. The stillness of\nthe\n&gt; bridge was filled with the hum of the computers and mainframe coming\nonline.\n&gt; Black Aracnia smiled, leaned back in the chair, and was now going to take\n&gt; care of the invaders.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Adrax fired his gappling gun at Terrorsaur, and sent two optic blasts\nat\n&gt; Kitkat. He manuvered around the sky,trying to hit as many targets as he\ncould.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Black Aracnia, while looking at the computer monitors, &quot; Computer,\nbring\n&gt; all Autoguns online, and initiate the shiled at Maximum Power.&quot;\n&gt;     The computer did so, and within a moment the Autoguns flew to life,\n&gt; shooting at Megatrons group, as well as Adrax and Autofire who they didnt\n&gt; reconize as Predacons.\n&gt;     &quot;Excellent. Now, for the intruders inside....&quot;She said, bringing over\na\n&gt; keyboard and an interactive map of the ship.\n&gt;     She began to type in codes for various sections of the ships internal\n&gt; defences. She spotted the two intruders and sent the internal defences on\n&gt; them. The corriodr they were in snapped shut, the ventilation system\nhissed\n&gt; closed, and several small canon extend from the ceiling. Black Aracnia\nsmiled\n&gt; because they had just walked into there own tomb.\n&gt;     &quot;Computer, close hatch and lock down the entire ship. I dont want\nanyone\n&gt; else getting in.&quot;\n&gt;     The computer did so. All the doors on the ship closed. The shafts for\nair\n&gt; snapped shut, and all the canon extended and prepared to fire. And, for a\n&gt; last fitch effort in case anyone somehow got though, Black Aracnia orders\na\n&gt; force seven sheilding on all doors and corridor entrances, including the\n&gt; hatch. The ship was inpenetrable all thanks to Black Aracnia....who was\n&gt; thinking of who should be in charge of the fraction.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
