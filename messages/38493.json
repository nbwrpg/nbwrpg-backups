The \nwings\n&gt; rubbing against him didnt bother him to much, but he was not \nacostumed\n&gt; to riding with a passenger, and since they were on ancient earth, \ndidnt\n&gt; think he would need to. He slowly followed Cliffjumper, keeping an \neye\n&gt; on him, as Beachcomber scouted ahead, easily jumping around on the \nrough\n&gt; terrain.\n*****************\n::REDHOT::\n\n    Redhot remained quiet as he rested, grumbling mentally to himself \nwith any bump firm enough to jar his wings. He wanted to go someplace \nwarm, clean and quiet so he could rest in peace. \n    He could hear the other robots ahead of him and he smiled. It felt \ngood to finally find robots he could trust. He had been travelling \nalone far too long.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe productions \n**************************************\n\n\n"}}
