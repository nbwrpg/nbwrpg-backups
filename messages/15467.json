He started \ntowards her\n&gt; slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt;       He was thinking about what Firearm said about two Maximals \nunder\n&gt; attack.  Nobody knew his little secret.  This whole time, he had \nhis mind\n&gt; connected with the Cybertronian Fire.  He read the scanners.  The \ntwo\n&gt; Maximals under attack.  That was the Alliance&#39;s work.  Also, by this\n&gt; connection, he now knew the Cybertronian Fire like his back hand.  \nHe loved\n&gt; his little mental ability.  He loved it so much, that it even \nscared him.\n&gt; He also saw what was going on in just about every part of the \nship.  He\n&gt; usually never paid attention to any of it, but he did like keeping \na close\n&gt; eye on things.  He ran up beside Feline.\n&gt; \n&gt;         He snickered, &quot;Still want that tour??  The one that Chordate\n&gt; promised but hasn&#39;t given you???  I can show you much of the ship.  \nSome of\n&gt; the Maximals left, to go save fellow Maximals from \nthe...Alliance!!

She walked towards the engine room.  Looks over her\n&gt; &gt; shoulder to see if Skulletron was following her or not.
