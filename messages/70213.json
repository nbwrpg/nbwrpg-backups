He dus=\r\nts himself off the best he can and lends a pair of high beams to light the =\r\nway safely for Rodimus, hoping that he too would not have such a hard fall.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Rodimus?  Are you all right?&quot;\n\nNight Shift does the same drop and roll m=\r\naneuver and rolls quickly back to his feet. He too puts on the high beams t=\r\no get himself a look around.\n\n&quot; Slag.  Well, at least I didn&#39;t fall as hard=\r\n as those scrap heads thought I would.  Hah!  I owe that ta Ninjabot traini=\r\nng.  Hmm, gettn&#39; outa here&#39;s gonna be a different story all tagether.&quot;\n\nHe =\r\nnow gets his connection com link over to Tucson Prime.\n\n&quot; So what&#39;dya make =\r\nof this one, Tucson Prime.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime responds as he too examines the d=\r\nirt and consistancy of the sink hole&#39;s materials.\n\n&quot; Well, they out did the=\r\nmselves this time, I&#39;ll give them that.  This is volcanic soil, rather slip=\r\npery, and I&#39;m not too fond of the odor either.&quot;\n\nNight Shift responds.\n\n&quot;Co=\r\npy that, worse than a busted exhaust system.  Ain&#39;t no way we&#39;re gettn&#39; out=\r\na here the easy way.  Now, if I were Prowl, what would I do?&quot;\n\nTucson raise=\r\ns a brow.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s a good question Night Shift.  One I should ask myself.  =\r\nThere is a way out, although not easy to find, but there is a way out of th=\r\nis.  We just have to dig deeper into our logic and find the answer.  And ge=\r\ntting angry isn&#39;t going to do us any good.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot; Yeah, yo=\r\nu&#39;re right, so far it isn&#39;t.  Wait a minute, what about that climbn&#39; trick =\r\nhe taught us?  The one we practiced for days on end?&quot;\n\nTucson raises a brow=\r\n.\n\n&quot; Yes, that one.  Might not work but it&#39;s worth an attempt.&quot;\n\nFrom where=\r\n they were, Tucson and Night Shift now attempt a special climbinb maneuver =\r\nwhich they were taught by Prowl, by using every inch of their body, like an=\r\n upside down spider, and slowly move one limb at a time, keeping hands and =\r\nfeet firmly against the walls of their ditches.\n\nMeanwhile outside, Rat Tra=\r\np and Quick Stride think it&#39;s best to remain beside Legacy and not venture =\r\nout ahead of him.  Rat Trap sniffs the air and doesn&#39;t like what his tiny n=\r\nose picks up.\n\n&quot;Uhh ohhh...  Ummm, I don&#39;t think things are workn&#39; out too =\r\nwell in there...&quot;\n\nQuickstride also looks concerned.\n\n&quot; Normally, I don&#39;t h=\r\nesitate to do something but, I got a baaaaad feeln&#39; in my servos on this on=\r\ne Legacy.  I - think we better just follow you.  Yeah, that&#39;s right, it&#39;s t=\r\nhe safest thing ta do.&quot;\n\n \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll =\r\n&lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: RODIMUS PRIME, SCOURGE, SCORPONOK, CYCL=\r\nONUS, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA,\n&gt; NIGHTRAZOR, LEGACY, JHIAXUS, Tuscon, Nightshift=\r\n, Darkhawk, Hydras,\n&gt; Perceptor, Rat Trap, Quickstride\n&gt; Location: Black Fo=\r\nrtress - Hallways\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I will be sending an OOC post, please read it a=\r\ns well :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Rodimus, I want you to make a run for the door, take the=\r\n others with you, including Darkhawk, and form a protective barrier around =\r\nhim. Legacy is going to open an escape path for us. But first, it&#39;s about t=\r\nime I won our side some pay back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus started to nod, but then lo=\r\noked at Tuscon, his jaw dropping!\n&gt; He did step back so that he could bette=\r\nr cover the battle scene, but\n&gt; as he glanced about the odds seemed to be h=\r\neavily stacked against\n&gt; them. He shook his head, &quot;Tuscon! I cannot let you=\r\n sacrifice yourself.\n&gt; It was I who started all of this, and it is I who ne=\r\neds to step in.\n&gt; The Autobots will need you to hold everything together.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He cracks his knuckles and stares coldly at Cyclonus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; You =\r\nwant to take the Autobots down, you&#39;ll have to get past me first, Cyclonus!=\r\n And this time, I&#39;m not holding anything back!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus smiled at Tus=\r\ncon as he turned to face him, &quot;Then it is as I\n&gt; hoped.&quot; he said, bowing hi=\r\ns head slightly at the new prime, his optics\n&gt; never leaving Tuscon&#39;s - the=\r\n gesture of one warrior to another.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Night Shift reports to Legacy, L=\r\nord Elder,Rat Trap, Lord Perseus, and Quickstride.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yo, Night Shift=\r\n here, I&#39;m broadcastn&#39; from Ninjabot Radio Network, you&#39;re missn&#39; some real=\r\n hot tension buildn&#39; up in here. I think Tucson Prime&#39;s sick of Cyclonus&#39;s =\r\nscrap and he&#39;s lookn&#39; ta go one on one ta show &#39;em what he&#39;s really made of=\r\n. I ain&#39;t never seen &#39;em this steamed off but slag, he&#39;s got a look in his =\r\nface like he&#39;s itchn&#39; ta do some major damage. Maybe you&#39;ll get in here jus=\r\nt in time ta take advantage of some newly fallen spare parts.. Maybe, that&#39;=\r\ns if there are any.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy&#39;s cold voice intoned over the communicatio=\r\nn grid, &quot;Illogical.\n&gt; The situation that you are in is repleate with unknow=\r\nn variables and\n&gt; permutations. To deduce a victory with such an unstable s=\r\net of\n&gt; parameters illogical and extremely dangerous.&quot;  Legacy paused as th=\r\ne\n&gt; sounds of explosions could be heard in the background, &quot;I will be\n&gt; the=\r\nre momentarily.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; This is it Rodimus, this is where our tables are =\r\ngoing to turn, and then, we will make these Predacons and Decepticons eat t=\r\nheir words. We aren&#39;t going to run, we&#39;re going to fight and we&#39;re going to=\r\n give it our all! AUTOBOTS, MAXIMALS, ASSUME YOUR BATTLE MODES AT THIS TIME=\r\n AND ERECT ALL SHIELDS SURROUNDING THE OLD MAXIMAL BASE AND THE ARK! WE WIL=\r\nL PROTECT OUR OWN AND VANQUISH OUR ENEMIES! WE&#39;RE GOING TO TAKE BACK THIS P=\r\nLANET AND TURN THINGS AROUND FOR THE INNOCENT! THIS FIGHT IS FOR FREEDOM, N=\r\nOT POWER, AND WE WILL TAKE IT BACK!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus nodded as well as he turn=\r\ned to face the oncoming seemingly\n&gt; endless hoard of Decepticons and Predac=\r\nons, &quot;We stand together then\n&gt; Tuscon.&quot; he said, trying to sound more confi=\r\ndent than he was. he knew\n&gt; the odds, even without Legacy&#39;s cautious wordin=\r\ng. Rodimus&#39; weapon was\n&gt; growing quite warm in his hand with the repeated u=\r\nse it was getting.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He waits with anticipation. Inside Tucson Prime p=\r\nauses for just one moment, and then with almost a roar in his voice..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;AUTOBOTS, MAXIMALS, ATTACK!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Inside, Tucson Prime throws a powe=\r\nrful punch and launches one of his large missiles from his missile carrier,=\r\n attempting to open fire on the enemy to shake them up a bit. Night Shift a=\r\nttempts to do the same with his photon blast riffle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; That&#39;s right=\r\n, you be messn&#39; with the wrong bots slag balls!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; All manner of sounds =\r\nand light errupt through the halls as Tuscion&#39;s\n&gt; missiles fly through the =\r\nair. However the missles failed to reach\n&gt; their intended destination as sm=\r\nall rockets flew through the air from\n&gt; the Predacon side, detonating the m=\r\nissles prematurely.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No, I think we have the correct ones after all.&quot; =\r\nsaid another cold\n&gt; voice as Jhiaxus stood thier in the midst of the smoke =\r\nand debris from\n&gt; the missile, the anti missile defence obviously of his do=\r\ning. &quot;You\n&gt; have lost Tuscon Prime.&quot; Jhiaxus said, his voice all confidence=\r\n as he\n&gt; brought his own weapon to bear. He smiled at Rodimus, &quot;And soon yo=\r\nu\n&gt; both will be among the Predacon ranks! Bwhahahhaa!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile a=\r\ns the others fight it out, Nightrazor shimmered and\n&gt; appeared next to Dark=\r\nhawk and behind Nightshift! What he was about to\n&gt; do was difficult to tell=\r\n, because instead of completing the move the\n&gt; floor beneath his feet began=\r\n to rumble as large cracks ran through the\n&gt; entire hallway!\n&gt; \n&gt; It would =\r\nseem that these hallways were not designed to take on the\n&gt; full brunt of t=\r\nwo primes and several leader class Predecaons,\n&gt; Decepticons and other vari=\r\nous soldiers. So the wall shuddered and\n&gt; spilt as finally the floor gave w=\r\nay, sending the entire section of\n&gt; hall plunging downward nearly 60&#39; into =\r\na large open cavern!\n&gt; \n&gt; The cavern was incredibly large, the cieling reac=\r\nhing up nearly the\n&gt; entire distance back to the black Fortress above it. T=\r\nhis chamber\n&gt; looks to be totally unused, an natural chamber that shifted i=\r\ntself\n&gt; under the fortress over the course of time. The chamber itself is h=\r\not,\n&gt; the smell of sulpher and ash can be detected. The fact that this room=\r\n\n&gt; is not filled with searing, superheated liquid stone is miraculous.\n&gt; Ho=\r\nwever it is obvious that too much firepower in this room would bring\n&gt; tons=\r\n of it pouring into this area at a moment&#39;s notice!\n&gt; \n&gt; There do not appea=\r\nr to be any exits from this room save the one above,\n&gt; although a brave sou=\r\nl could perhaps try to make one . . . and risk\n&gt; bring in the magma that mo=\r\nst likely surrounds this room.\n&gt; \n&gt; 60 feet above the chamber Legacy finall=\r\ny made it to the room above and\n&gt; screeches to a halt. He sends his scanner=\r\ns peering downward, &quot;A most\n&gt; interesting development.&quot; he said as he consi=\r\ndered what to do to help.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
