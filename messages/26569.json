To his knowledge, he was \nthe tallest bot on the planet, although in reality there were a few \nwho were taller. Perndabot was 15 feet tall, a fuze of two Maximals \nand thereby having two fully operational sparks. Other than that, \nhowever, everything had been redone by the Alliance, right down to \nhis programming. Before he was tamed (he had gone insane after the \naccidental fuze), he had been a completely wild bot, and it had taken \nthe combined efforts of most of the Alliance and Maximals (which were \nboth small factions at the time) to restrain him.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; he replies to Darkfate&#39;s question, &quot;Zardus thinks it would be \nbenificial to both factions if we allied. He would be here himself, \nbut the Alliance just got back from a battle and there are things \nthan need to be done back at the base.&quot;\n\nHis mission wasn&#39;t all or nothing. As long as any sort of good will \nwas established between the Alliance and the Predacons, Zardus would \nprobably be happy.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Darkfate/7 batprobes::\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Darkfate landed in robot mode, several feet of Pernabot. 6 of the 7 \n&gt; bat probes spread in several diferent directions and they lost in \nthe \n&gt; distance. One landed in Darkfate&#39;s arm.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So, does Zardus want to make a deal with me?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
