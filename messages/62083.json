Before I fix your computer, I need to ask one question.  Am I\n&gt; being hired to do this job, or am I now your slave?  Keep in mind \nthat\n&gt; I will be glad to work for you, provided I am treated well....&quot;\n&gt; Celeron didn&#39;t seem to be taking them seriously.  He stopped \npicking\n&gt; the sand out of his arm, and got out a little cleaning tool and \nbegan\n&gt; polishing his arm.  He avoided eye contact and seemed a lot less\n&gt; paranoid than he had been a minute before.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, 12 Oct 2004 10:57:32 -0700 (PDT), robert riley\n&gt; &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I am the one in charge.

I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; believe that the two of you posess the firepower to stop me if I\n&gt; &gt; really wanted to leave....but, it depends on what you wanted me \nto\n&gt; &gt; fix, and what I am going to get out of the deal.  By the way, \nwhich\n&gt; &gt; one of you is the leader?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Celeron then assumed a relaxed position, pulled out a small \npiece of\n&gt; &gt; metal and started picking little pieces of sand out of a crack \nin his\n&gt; &gt; arm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Tue, 12 Oct 2004 08:07:09 -0700 (PDT), robert riley\n&gt; &gt; &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hellplague:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Well, we can&#39;t let you leave now.
