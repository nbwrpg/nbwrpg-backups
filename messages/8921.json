It was the rat from earlier.  She stayed \nhiddedn behind the tree with her gun drawn.  She was holding her pet \nrat in her free hand against her body.  SHe stayed perfectly still.  \n\nThe rat, on the other hand, was moving.  It crawled free and started \nto climb up her arm.  It kept crawling up until it reached her \nshoulder.  Is snuggled next to her neck and stayed there.\n\nShe smirked and whispered, &quot;What ever you do, don&#39;t sneeze.&quot;  she \nchuckled quietly to herself.  She thought, how can one fight with a \nrat perched on one&#39;s shoulders?  She was hoping she really wouldn&#39;t \nfind out, but knew that avoiding this would be extremely difficult.\n\n\n"}}
