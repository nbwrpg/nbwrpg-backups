The journey was long \nenough, and now they couldnt find the new bot.\n    Paralysis shrugged. He didnt see anything. Walking around the clearing he \nmade sure no one else was around.\n    Then, Black Aracnia stumbled apon the empty stasis pod, and the tracks of \nthe Allience members who stole the warrior. &quot;What?! What?! No! No! No!&quot;\n    Her fit of rage cause the birds to scatter, and a few deer to gallop \naway. She stomped the ground and, basically, threw a tantrum.\n    &quot;Ah, Commander. Im sure that the bot wasnt worth it anyways.&quot; Paralysis \nsaid, unknowing it would direct her rage towrds him.\n    &quot;Shut up wart face! Lets just go home! Those damn Allience Members! Who \ndo they think they are? The Beast Wars peace keepers or something? Argh! \nReturn to base, now!&quot; She screamed.\n\n"}}
