Pushing a few buttons on it it began to glow slightly as it\n&gt; u=\r\nnfolded into a temporary antigravity suspensor bed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I will be right b=\r\nack.&quot; he said, &quot;I am going to retrieve Nightlight.\n&gt; We still have a bit of=\r\n work to do it seems.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Thank yo=\r\nu Legacy, everyone, I know it&#39;s hard to understand things that we normally =\r\ncould never understand, but it is this common ground which will keep us tog=\r\nether as a faction, something Hydras does not have, nor will ever have. I a=\r\nlso understand your reservations on the matter. I can tell just by the tone=\r\ns of your voices, but I also comprehend the reason behind it and it&#39;s only =\r\nnormal to have reservations. I am not offended by your true feelings, but t=\r\nhankful you are willing to give Perceptor the chance to prove himself worth=\r\ny.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Before Tucson had been upgraded to a Prime, this sort of talk w=\r\nould often anger him to the point of grave annoyance. He&#39;d often speak up a=\r\nnd stick up for those being riddiculed and whenever necesary, he probably w=\r\nould have lost his temper all together and decked the offender right there =\r\nand then. But now, he realizes those feelings did not come through. Somethi=\r\nng was definitely changing. Instead of being his old self, he was evolving =\r\ninto someone new, wiser, more tolerant, and a lot more calm as an individua=\r\nl. Yet, his toughness was still there, along with his courage, and will to =\r\nfight. He could not yet understand the meaning of these changes, and for wh=\r\natever reason, he knew they were for the better. He now turns his head in L=\r\negacy&#39;s direction.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Even as a Prime, I&#39;m still in the process of l=\r\nearning. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever stop learning. One thing I have to admit, =\r\nif I were still my old self now, short tempered, quick to be critical, I ma=\r\ny have blown the roof off the Ark, and retorted adversely. But now, I could=\r\nn&#39;t find it in my spark to react as such. I&#39;m changing, and as I change, I =\r\ncan feel the pressense of Optimus Prime. I often feel that if I could see m=\r\ny shadow, it would appear as his once did, long ago. Why is that? I know I&#39;=\r\nm not Optimus, yet there is a part of me that feels that he&#39;s within me som=\r\nehow. Legacy, is there something about me that even I do not know? I&#39;m very=\r\n curious to find out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy watched Tuscon impassively, h=\r\nis single optic glowing with a\n&gt; focused light. &quot;Your reaction is . . . cur=\r\nious.&quot; Legacy said in his\n&gt; normal icy tones, &quot;Change is inevitable,  predi=\r\nctable and often times\n&gt; beneficial. Logic demands that we adapt to what we=\r\n cannot control and\n&gt; be a part of change rather than a victim of it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Legacy turned to observe Perceptor, &quot;I am sure we shall all keep a\n&gt; watch=\r\nful optic on him, and adapt our responses to his actions.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon nodd=\r\ned as he crossed his arms, &quot;Yep. I agree. If you vouch for\n&gt; him Tuscon the=\r\nn I will give him the benefit of the doubt, but I won&#39;t\n&gt; take my optic off=\r\n of him until he proves it to me he&#39;s trust worthy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca, who had st=\r\nepped back in the room merely nodded at Tuscon,\n&gt; holding his own council f=\r\nor the moment on how he felt about\n&gt; Perceptor&#39;s presence. Instead he chose=\r\n to change the subject, &quot;I will\n&gt; be sending the Fuzors out on patrol. Ther=\r\ne is no telling what Hydras\n&gt; is doing while we are all sitting here watchi=\r\nng you and Rodimus\n&gt; recover.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
