Although\nhis speech was slow and his movements simple, there was something in\nhis optics that displayed a sharp mind and keen intelligence. &quot;We have\nbeen given orders to bring you in for questioning along with your\ntroop.&quot;\n\nTankor&#39;s sharp gaze glanced at the other predacons that were with\nHydras. It seemed that Tankor  was just a soldier following orders,\nthere was nothing in his expression that showed that he cared one way\nor the other how this all turned out, but as it is with most\ntransformers, things may not always be what they appear to be.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
