You have to let others reply before you do too \nmuch. Flying that far is too much.\n\n2. There are both a shot limit and a power limit. From what I \nunderstand of your Terror Force, and if I properly know what the \nnumber 6 means, which I think I do, your post would be breaking those \nrules too, unless Angel Prime is so drained after using the Terror \nForce that he can hardly move, and those fireballs do relitively \nlittle damage.\n\nSo please repost and post damage for all the shots. Thanx.\n\n\n"}}
