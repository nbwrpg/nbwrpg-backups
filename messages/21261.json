We&#39;ll scrap ya!&quot;\n\nOOC: Most people dont take much damage when I shoot the the 50cal.\ngattaling gun, so I&#39;ll explain about it. A 50cal. would be the kind of\nthing mounted on a helicopter or a jet fighter. It&#39;s big and powerful. A\n50cal. can blow a 1 foot hole in a 6 inch thick stone wall. So will\npeople please get hurt once in a wile. You dont have to do this when\nhit, but for the record, you would br loseing limbs if hit by this.\n\n"}}
