The first one they might not \nbelieve as well\n&gt; as the second.  Anyway my first story is that I was born here and I \nnever\n&gt; joined any factions, and I found my destiny in the maximals, or I \ncan say\n&gt; that I just landed in a pod, and go ask to join the Maximals.  If I \nchoose\n&gt; my first story, then it would be better if we didn&#39;t go in the base \nat the\n&gt; same time.  Which story sounds better to you, pussy cat?&quot; \nSkulletron said,\n&gt; grinning.\n\n\n"}}
