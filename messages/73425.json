Guns and\n&gt; shiel=\r\nds around DINBOT and SKYSHADOW, powerful reprograming drugs being\n&gt; pumped =\r\ninto VICE GRIP. He had finally come into his own, or at least\n&gt; he seemed t=\r\no have. The only draw back of course is that if he leaves\n&gt; the protection =\r\nof the ship he would loose most of his advantages,\n&gt; unless he had somehtin=\r\ng else up his proverbial sleeve.\n&gt; \n&gt; As DINOBOT capitulated TARANTULUS nod=\r\nded and the doors to the bridge\n&gt; slid open to reveal the FUZORS who appear=\r\ned to be giving consideration\n&gt; to blasting open the doors and WASPINATOR.\n=\r\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDINOBOT was cowardly enough to keep his carapace intact pending som=\r\neone being able to one up Tarantalus, at which point his support would go v=\r\noer behind them.  And no one said it would be ENTHUSIASTIC or not.\n\nAnd the=\r\nn WASPINATOR saw the FUZORS and let out a whimper, trying to flee and hide.=\r\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time CRYOTEK and the HORRORCONS behind him la=\r\nnded in the\n&gt; bay area and stalked through the ship, none of them looking t=\r\noo happy.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What can I do for you . . . err Cryotek?&quot; TARANTULUS said r=\r\nather\n&gt; nervously, despite the fact that he had several large cannons at hi=\r\ns\n&gt; disposal and energy fields in place.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You can start by telling me =\r\nwhat you have done with my ship!?!?!&quot;\n&gt; CRYOTEK said darkly. &quot;And what are =\r\nyou doing sitting in the command\n&gt; chair, where is Hydras?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; TARANTULUS=\r\n smiled as he recovered his composure, &quot;Oh your ship&quot; He\n&gt; gestured languid=\r\nly, &quot;I used it to upgrade my own. It was such an eye\n&gt; sore sitting out the=\r\nre. I thought I would find better uses for it.&quot; He\n&gt; chuckled evilly.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDINBOOT looked from TARANTALUS to CRYOTEK and back again, &quot;Oh, I ca=\r\nn&#39;t wait to hear this.  Why do you not then tell him of whatever disruption=\r\ns that you are detecting now then..&quot;  Pointing over to ANTAGONY then and se=\r\neing if she would rise to the bait then of monologuing.\n\n\n\n"}}
