The part about Savage attacking \nStriker \n&gt; is still valid, same with the shots hitting Tamron, but the whole \n&gt; Iguana thing, the chip being defelcting and Tamron&#39;s little speech \nI \n&gt; am re-writing. I think I might like this story-line, though. \nStriker \n&gt; could go through hell trying to get Spears&#39; back, and Savage hates \n&gt; Striker so eventually they could have a climactic battle. Who wins? \n&gt; We&#39;ll have to play it out.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Tamron\n&gt; \n&gt; Tamron watched as the micro-chip sinks into Spears. He lets out a \n&gt; good laugh.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hahahahaha! Hold your fire, or your friend is done for. I have the \n&gt; power now to even force herself to self-destruct. Now, you, what is \n&gt; your name?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
