Dinner...and desert.\n\nDesmonus nodds at BloodyStrikes introduction with an evil glint in her \noptics, her stomach growling just as the smell of his mech-fluid running \nthrough his veins.\nShe knew that he had some sort of thing for her, even if it was just because \nof her looks. But that was nothing more then she could have hoped for, two \ngullable males who would believe anything that cam out of her mouth...and \nmaybe all she had to do was maintain a food source was keep them pleased.\nA small price to pay for a full stomach.\n\nShe was just about to reach out and shake BloodyStrikes hand when Reptilica \nswatted his away and replaced it with his own.\nBut then she simply leaned back and crossed her arms for a moment, watching \nboth of the bots fight over something or a nother...most likely her. Which \nwould serve her purpose.\n\nDesmonus simply sighed and then stepped forward, taking hold of each of \ntheir arms and then stepping in between them. Her voice more lighthearted \nthen she felt.*\n\n&quot; Gentlemen, please.... You two both seem like you know this base from bolt \nto plating, and of course I&#39;m new here so I don&#39;t really know my way around. \nPerhaps...a tour is in order?&quot;\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
