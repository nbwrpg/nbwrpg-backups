I have a little theory that why it&#39;s got to be Transformer blood and not any other mech blood is becuase of the one thing that all Transformers have, and that I lack. A Spark.

The drawback is I don&#39;t know if I can take one, you probably don&#39;t have spares lying about, and I don&#39;t know if it would change me at all. The second option, which isn&#39;t as permanent, is every so often I will need to comsume a portion of a synthetic blood.

I don&#39;t think many of your crew would want to give up a little of their life just to help me, considering they don&#39;t know me at all. And I really don&#39;t want to kill anyone.
