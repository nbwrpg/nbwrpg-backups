She is obviousl=\r\ny a jet in her alt mode, as \nher \n&gt; &gt;&gt; slender midriff bore the distinctive=\r\n outline of a nosecone. Her \nface \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and forearms are alabaster white, w=\r\nith fin like protrusions of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same \n&gt; &gt;&gt; hue flowing off of her hel=\r\nm. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; She looked up at the duo as they entered, locking gazes with=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nightstrike and Darkfate. Her demeanor was curious and yet \nstrangel=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt;&gt; aggressive, her humorless smile she displayed only accentuated \nthi=\r\ns. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Her optics were deep and penetrating as she stared at them, her \nh=\r\nead \n&gt; &gt;&gt; tilting slightly. For a moment it was as if she saw not just \nthe=\r\nm, \n&gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt;&gt; something more, something only she could see about them. =\r\nBut \nthen \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; moment passed as her smile faded and she returned =\r\nto looking at \nthe \n&gt; &gt;&gt; device she had been studying before they came up. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; The other figure that stood here was truly massive. He stood \nn=\r\nearly \n&gt; &gt;&gt; head and shoulders taller then most mechs, with huge shoulders,=\r\n \nand \n&gt; &gt;&gt; powerful limbs. He was colored primarily in gunmetal grey armor=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt;&gt; red at his large shoulders, and splashes of it at his fac=\r\neplate. \nHe \n&gt; &gt;&gt; looked something like a seeker on steroids! He had what a=\r\nppeared \nto \n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt;&gt; a nosecone at his chest, but his frame was far mo=\r\nre thickly \narmored \n&gt; &gt;&gt; then any seeker. Cannons were mounted on his back=\r\n, as well \nextending \n&gt; &gt;&gt; from his shoulders extending along each bicep, w=\r\nhile on his \nchest \n&gt; &gt;&gt; appeared to be rocket or missile launchers. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He turned to look at the female next to him, his face dour and \nhard,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Phobia, you have the information yet?&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; The red and blac=\r\nk femme next to him snapped alert and looked \n&gt; &gt; over, &quot;Yes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sir, I h=\r\nave something.&quot; She glanced back at her device and then \n&gt; &gt; back at \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nDeepstryke, &quot;It has taken some time to make sense of the neural \n&gt; &gt; upload=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nightrazor sent us of Hot Rod, but I do believe we have a \nlocation =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; what they&#39;re looking for.&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Deepstryke nodded, &quot;Do=\r\nes it match the original location Cyclonus \n&gt; &gt; sent \n&gt; &gt;&gt; us?&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Phobia nodded as Deepstryke&#39;s head snapped around to look at \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nightst=\r\nrike and darkfate, his look long and penatrating, &quot;What \ndo \n&gt; &gt; you \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nknow of the original Ark the fell to earth, and of the Optimus \nPrime \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n that held the matrix?&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Preston \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (Da&#39;minion) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;       \n&gt; &gt; ____________ _________ _________ _________ ____=\r\n_____ _________ _ \n&gt; &gt; ____________ __ \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Be a better friend, newshound,=\r\n and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
