(I know he&#39;s not \nthere but\n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t a better name for it.)  His beast mode was that of a \ncrane.  (You\n&gt; know,\n&gt; &gt; the bird that stands on one leg.)  He stepped out and found that \nin the\n&gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; his logic circuits were scrambled, but he was in perfect \ncondition other\n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; that.  Unfortunately all he could do was give pearls of wisdom.  \nNow all\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; could do is make things unclear with those &quot;pearls of wisdom.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
