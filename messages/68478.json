The\n&gt; &gt; largest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rumbled down a thouroghfair, almost a block in shape. At\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s bow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a large barreled fusion cannon wile the top portion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contained two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; secondary cannons on either side of a twin missile pod. The\n&gt; &gt; second\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aircraft; noticably faster, was set apart by its air foils\n&gt; &gt; and two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; precision beam rifles. The last, was tiny by comparison,\n&gt; flying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over the building until it dove down to join the other two.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the three craft converged, they combinded into an even\n&gt; &gt; larger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ship, the small flyer compacting and fitting inside the\nfaster\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flyer,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which connected to the bow section of the larger gunship.\n&gt; &gt; The ship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hovered over an intersection for several minutes as a crowd\n&gt; &gt; gather\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around it. And then it suddenly fell.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But before it crashed to the roadway, it transformed. The\n&gt; &gt; cannons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fell away and reconfigured as the body reformed. The large\n&gt; &gt; engines\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formed strong legs.
