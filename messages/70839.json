However what we process, learn and remember\naffects these values, and in turn the affect of these changes alters\nhow we process and learn new things in the future.&quot;\n\nLegacy looked at Perceptor as he tilted his head, &quot;To change one\nwithout changing the other would be an incredibly precarious process.&quot;\nLegacy paused again, obviously thinking, &quot;It is possible that is why\nyou have met with only limited success. attempting to delete the\npersonality without a complete deletion of the underlying memories\nwhich actually drove the personality allowed for corruption to set in\nas her core matrix attempted to revive the lost bits of personality\nand factional allegiance.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
