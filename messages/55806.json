The Maximals and Predacons were arguing yet\n&gt; again when the Tripreds arrived. They had been lurking in the ranks of\n&gt; the Preds and had waited the right moment to strike. Even with both\n&gt; the Maximal and Predacon armies, we were not able to resist them long.\n&gt; We were cornered in Katatronia City. We decided to retreat so that we\n&gt; could better resist them. We embarked on a ship, Maximals and\n&gt; Predacons, and departed for Earth. There, we established the Survivor\n&gt; Council.\n&gt; \n&gt; He paused, letting the implications sink in.\n&gt; \n&gt; AzureBlade: However, just a few weeks ago, we learned of Prime&#39;s\n&gt; reconstruction and of the the Tripredacus plan. The Council sent me\n&gt; after him because of my neutrality. I am as much a Predacon as I am a\n&gt; Maximal. My role here is to contain or destroy Prime. He has become a\n&gt; threat no one can afford to ignore, not even the Tripreds. We have to\n&gt; thwart his plans.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; &gt; Kup leads AzureBlade into his office.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup: Have a seat.
