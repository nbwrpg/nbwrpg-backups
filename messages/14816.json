We&#39;re done here. Let&#39;s go.&quot;\n\nBrix and Fliq are about to enter the shuttle, when a voice stops them.\n\n&quot;No one is going anywhere.&quot;\n\nBrix and Fliq spin around to see a damaged bot, with a small hole in \nhis head. Brix and Fliq recognize him at once.\n\n&quot;Gekki....Gekkidama?&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right. The one you left behind, Octociz. When that steel \nthing hit me in the head, I only went into Stasis lock.  You didn&#39;t \neven bother to check if I was dead.In about a week I woke up, and I \nwas all alone.\n\n&quot;But...we needed to get out. There could have been another explosion, \nand we could&#39;ve all fried.\n\n&quot;THAT&#39;S NO EXCUSE FOR LEAVING ME STRANDED HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Gekkidama \nthan looked to Ramulus, &quot;So....you guys have gotten a new friend. \nWell let me give you a warning. Don&#39;t get to know these guys. When \nyou&#39;re hurt, they can abandon you, just like they did to me. It&#39;s too \nbad you got hooked up with them. You&#39;re innocent. You just wanted a \nlittle trip to the moon. But now Brix and Octociz have to pay. I&#39;ve \nbeen stranded here for months, and now WE&#39;RE ALL GONNA BE STUCK \nHERE!!!&quot;\n\nGekkidama pulled out his grenade launcher, and fired on at the \nshuttle.\n\n&quot;NO!!!!!!!!!(Using alot of exclamtion points in this post)&quot; Fliq dove \ninto the grenade. It his his hand and exploded, causing his entire \narm to fly off.\n\n&quot;Fliq!&quot; Brix ran over to see Fliq. Mech fluid was pouring out, and he \nhad gone into stasis lock.\n\n&quot;Oh...so Octociz has a new name now. Great...&quot;\n\nBrix walked over to Ramulus.\n\n&quot;I hope you can fly. Get Fliq inside the shuttle and heat it up. Fliq \nneeds medical attention, or he&#39;s gonna die. Give me 5 minutes. If I \nhaven&#39;t finished this guy yet, take off. Don&#39;t look at me like that. \nWhen Fliq is healed and you&#39;ve removed the cargo you can come back \nfor me. 5 minutes, no more.&quot;\n\nBrix turned to Gekkidama\n\n&quot;Show time.....&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nSavage\n\nSavage gets weaker as the bots shots continue to make holes in his \nhide. He thinks of a last second plan. He fakes another dive at \nStriker, but turns around and fires 2 fireballs and swings his tail \nrepeadidly at the other bot standing on the cliff.\n______________________________________________________________________\nZava\n\nZava looks at the clock. 1:30 before Phobia&#39;s ship goes boom. Zava \nlaugh to herself.\n\n&quot;All for Deemos.....All for Deemos.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
