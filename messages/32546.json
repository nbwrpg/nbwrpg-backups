Deep\nin his mind, he knew that the shields of the CF would fall soon, not\nthat that was a problem. With the Element fully functional and newer\nthan the Cybertronian Fire, the latter being destroyed wouldn&#39;t hurt\nthem too much. In fact, it might even help. The part of the mind\nthat&#39;s actually him lets the beast take over completely and retreats\nto a small corner of his thoughts, planning ahead for uses for the CF.\nHe knew it would be taken apart anyways, and perhaps this attack could\nbe used to that purpose.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Hell Beast glance down at Inferno. His eyes flickered with\ninternal \n&gt; repair and the new battery installment. Hell Beast didnt care if he\nwas \n&gt; damaged, just as long as he could fire his gun.\n&gt;        Then, he turned his attention to the small pellet holes in\nhis armor \n&gt; caused by the assault from element, as well as the large baked gash\non his \n&gt; upper leg. It hurt, but with the med kit tech fluid he could manage\na little \n&gt; longer.\n&gt;        Tankkor and Rampage squatted, if squatting is possible for\nbots that \n&gt; size, and kept a close watch on the battle unfolding yonder. They\nhad taken \n&gt; temporary cover behinde what appeared to be a large metal plate once \n&gt; belonging to the CF, but had been torn off durring a past attack.\nRampage \n&gt; turned to Hell Beast, &quot;Ready?&quot;\n&gt;        He nodded. Hell Beast was taken care of, and Inferno was\nstarting to \n&gt; come around agian. The four began to move.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Craken, Pheniox, Aerostreak, and Gremlin rained down a mass\nof missle \n&gt; fire. Each blast shook the transformers, but the out come was a\nbright white \n&gt; explosion that nailed the CF&#39;s failing shields.\n&gt;        &quot;A few more, and we should be through!&quot; Craken roared. He,\nthe largest \n&gt; of the four, was in his vhicle mode as an assault helicopter and was\nlooking \n&gt; out for any attackers. And wonders where Prowl went off too.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tarantulas, Waspinator, Aquarious, and Adrax huddled together\nfor a \n&gt; moment. Adrax was bleeding, but he could withstand it for now. f it\ngot worse \n&gt; he would have to clot it with something. As of now, they were under\nheavey \n&gt; fire, so, slowly, they poked up from a mass of smoking tree pulp and\nfired on \n&gt; the closest enemy. \n&gt; \n&gt;        Marine still watched for Iron Raptor. He was going to nail\nthat fem, \n&gt; hard. She left gashes all over his chest that was now streaked with\nmech. \n&gt; Ominous Prime and two of his Energonians had joined Jackle,\nNighteyes, and \n&gt; Klash as well. They aimed at the CF and watched as blue plasma and\nenergon \n&gt; fire errupted on its surface.\n\n\n"}}
