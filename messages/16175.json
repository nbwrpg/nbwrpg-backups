This was getting on his nerves, the constant interruptions.\n\n&quot;Who are you two?&quot; he asks, looking them over.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker paced back and forth in his cell. He had to warn the Maximals, he \njust had to! He growls, trying to think of a way.

He jumps forward, feeling \na bit dizzy, and spins around, firing two shots at Skulletron.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen enters the bridge, instantly pulling out his gun as he sees the \nbattle. He runs inside, firing at Skulletron.\n\n"}}
