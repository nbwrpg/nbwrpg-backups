Keeping well out of auto gun range, knowing\n&gt; that she couldn&#39;t move very quickly with all the added weight of the extra\n&gt; equipment.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt;\n&gt; * Rage growled as she looked at the newer ship, more bigger then the other\n&gt; one she saw ( Ark ) but sometimes bigger meant bader.\n&gt; She looked around the slowly began to approach the new ship, within\nscanner\n&gt; relays she could easily be picked up.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Old school buds here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5536/13/_/_/_/963214451/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
