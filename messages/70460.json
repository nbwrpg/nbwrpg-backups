C&#39;mon computer, if I say somethn&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay!  It ain&#39;t like \n&gt; I&#39;m gonna bug ya with a virus!  Perceptor&#39;s a pred but he&#39;s changn&#39; sides! \n&gt; Stupid piece of outdated hardware!  Well, at least Lord Elder said \n&gt; somethn&#39; ta Wheels, I don&#39;t wanna ever hear him try&#39;n ta put his spark on \n&gt; the line ever again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride and Night Shift try to deal with Noctorro, but his prodding \n&gt; was getting on the Autobot&#39;s nerves more than anything else.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Look, we&#39;re don&#39; the best we can, and we really don&#39;t know what we&#39;re \n&gt; dealn&#39; with here, this is completely alien ta all of us and you&#39;re gonna \n&gt; have ta show some patience.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride snorts and looks over to Noctorro.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;C&#39;mon, give us some breathing room will ya?!  Geeze!.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside, Tucson Prime acknolwedges the readiness to come aboard.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is Tucson Prime to Lord Elder, I&#39;m comming back to the Ark as you \n&gt; requested.  And let&#39;s see what the medics can do, if they need my help I&#39;m \n&gt; here to give to them.  Perceptor, Talon, don&#39;t worry, you will not be \n&gt; losing me any time soon, I assure you.  I wonder if I can get a link up \n&gt; with Rodimus remotely.  As an Autobot we should be able to com link with \n&gt; each other.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He attempts to connect with Rodimus&#39;s com link, hoping to get through to \n&gt; him.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In the Ark, Quickstride and Night Shift have the CR chambers ready for \n&gt;&gt; &gt; use as they do last minute evaluations on the system. With a thumbs up \n&gt;&gt; &gt; from Night Shift, the CR Chambers are made ready to accept new \n&gt;&gt; &gt; patients.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Quickstride and Night Shift finish thier work they can see the\n&gt;&gt; inert forms of Windlord and Nightlight in two of the recharge\n&gt;&gt; chambers, the chambers are set for a slow heal. So far their lights\n&gt;&gt; are showing green and their vital signs appear to be strengthening.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Airhammer and Noctorro glanced at each other as it seemed that\n&gt;&gt; Quickstride and Night Shift were ignoring them, and there are few\n&gt;&gt; people who could ignore a Maximal of Noctorro&#39;s size.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Answer me!&quot; Noctorro said as his hands flexed slightly, and his\n&gt;&gt; horned head turned to look directly at Quickstride and then Night\n&gt;&gt; Shift, &quot;What&#39;s happening with Rodimus?&quot; It was obvious that Noctorro&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; quick tempor starting to get the best of him, and for some reason he\n&gt;&gt; expected Rodimus to be in here.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Airhammer tried to lay a calming hand on his fuzor brother, but\n&gt;&gt; Noctorro shook it off.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;If he does that there&#39;s no telln&#39; if he&#39;ll survive such a proceedure. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Lord Elder, tell him he can&#39;t do that! That&#39;s like the ultimate \n&gt;&gt; &gt; saccrifice and there&#39;s a great chance he&#39;ll die from it!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Why don&#39;t we let the medical staff decide if Rodimus requires a spark\n&gt;&gt; infusion of some sort.&quot; Elder said, his voice over the radio calm and\n&gt;&gt; reasoning. &quot;I am sure that they are working on him now to the best of\n&gt;&gt; their abilities.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as Elder was talking the doors to the bridge slid open and he\n&gt;&gt; stepped onto the bridge followed by a much more calm Cheetor. &quot;Hey Rat\n&gt;&gt; Trap.&quot; Cheetor said as he stepped in and looked around, &quot;Tuscon Prime\n&gt;&gt; ready to come aboard?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile the computer continued to blink at Rat Trap, asking him if\n&gt;&gt; he wanted to take manual control as the computer continued to try and\n&gt;&gt; target lock Perceptor.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (OOC: Sorry if i overlooked it, but it seemed as if Rat Trap said they\n&gt;&gt; were good, but made no actually attempt to shut the weaponry down?)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the medical chamber . . .\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kup watched sadly the medic room and said to silverbolt &quot;I guess that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; i&#39;ll\n&gt;&gt; &gt; remain here to help&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Silverbolt tugged slightly on Kup&#39;s arm, &quot;Kup, we are warriors not\n&gt;&gt; Doctors.&quot; he said, somehow making that sound noble. He smiled at Kup,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Niether one of us have the medical training to help here.&quot; He pointed\n&gt;&gt; to the observation room. &quot;We can watch from there, but at least we\n&gt;&gt; won&#39;t be getting in the way, and if they need us, we are right there.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Silverbolt talked Bump and Santon began to scan Rodimus,\n&gt;&gt; positioning him on the bed. Legacy stood off to one side as he watched\n&gt;&gt; the computer, analyzing the readouts.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *   *   *   *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Interesting.&quot; Legacy said as he looked dispassionately at the screen,\n&gt;&gt; pointedly ignoreing Kup and Silverbolt at the moment in favor of the\n&gt;&gt; medical proceedure that would soon begin.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;What?&quot; Santon said shortly as he was placing his tools in position\n&gt;&gt; for the upcoming proceedure.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;It would seem that the tendrils have penatrated into nearly every\n&gt;&gt; system Rodimus has.&quot; Legacy said as he turned to look at Rodimus, &quot;but\n&gt;&gt; they seem to be disintergrating.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Santon looked at his scanner, &quot;Agreed.&quot; he said, &quot;We cannot place him\n&gt;&gt; in a recharge chamber yet, since we don&#39;t know what affect that could\n&gt;&gt; have on these things.&quot; Bump said, sounding disgusted by the tendrils,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;But I think we can start cutting them away.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Santon nodded, &quot;Then let&#39;s get started - carefully.&quot; he said,\n&gt;&gt; emphasizing that last word, &quot;We don&#39;t know what these things can still\n&gt;&gt; do.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy nodded as they all began to carefully cut away the metallic\n&gt;&gt; wrapping that enveloped Rodimus, working slowly and carefully.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
