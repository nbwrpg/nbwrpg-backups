He \nwas trying to find something to think of that didn&#39;t get him excited \nor nervous, but nothing worked. Maximal victory, exited, relaxing \nwith Iron Raptor, excited, a nice battle, excited, what he was about \nto do, nervious.\n\nHe frowns at Iris&#39; exclamation, looking at the cracked screen and \nglancing at a nice stream they were passing. He had a sudden urge \nto &#39;accidently&#39; drop Iris in, but he knew that she was probably right.\n\nHe sighs, relaxing on Iron Raptor, his mind dwelling on dropping Iris \ninto the stream. It was a stupid thing to think of, but nervious \nminds often think of stupid things.\n\nA small smile plays across Prowl&#39;s lips as he thinks of Iris floating \ndownstream and screaming obsenities at him and Iron Raptor, the \nMaximal relaxing. Finally getting his mind off of what lay ahead, his \nsparkbeat relaxing along with his mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris sighed as she scenned Prowls spark speed up.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Calm!
