We&#39;re having some problems with the equipment.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hmmm?&quot;\n\n&quot;The spore chambers&#39; energy readings are fluxuating, and the organic fluid \nchambers are unstable.&quot;\n\n&quot;What?  How&#39;d you foul that up?&quot; Feral yelled, running for the spore chamber.\n\n&quot;I did--&quot; a loud boom and a shockwave in the ground sent everyone crashing \ndown.\n\n&quot;What w--&quot; a second explosion of equal preportions continued rocking the four \nrobots.\n\nA wall blew open, millions of spores shooting out, miraculously missing Botan \nand Feral.  But both saw the spores beginning to take effect on the two \nbodyguards, a small stream of green fluid heading for them.\n\n&quot;Get out of here!&quot; Feral yelled as he and Botan ran, the fluid engulfing the \nbodyguards and several other robots who were screaming turning into strange \ncreatures from the effects of the spores.\n\n"}}
