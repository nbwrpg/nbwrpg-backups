He wo=\r\nuld have been glad to be rid of this annoyance, yes, but it would have been=\r\n somewhat disappointing as well. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; So when Rodimus was spun around b=\r\ny Tuscon, the Autobot may have missed the wicked smile on his face, When Tu=\r\nscon tried to=A0ram Rodimus into a wall, he may not have noticed that the s=\r\nound of crunching metal was not=A0Rodimus&#39; but the reinrorced wall shearing=\r\n and tearing under the force of the assault. It was not the sound of=A0Rodi=\r\nmkus&#39; defeat that resonated through the room, but it was something else!\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; Many of the same teachers that had instructed Tuscon had trained a yo=\r\nung Hot Rod as well -=A0=A0Jazz, Prowl, Brawn, Kup, even Optimus himself! A=\r\nnd while Rodimus no longer clearly remembered all these ones and what they =\r\nhad meant to him, thier lessons were still ground into him, and his reflexe=\r\ns that had been honed over the years of battle! \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Also, this was no =\r\nyoung Hot Rod that stood there before them, but a figure shapped by the ene=\r\nrgy of the matrix into a character of leadership, power and ability. He no =\r\nlonger had access to the knowledge and wisdom of the matrix, the energy hav=\r\ning been stripped from him. But that power that had been imparted was still=\r\n there, reconfigured by the power of the predacon shell program!=A0He was f=\r\naster, stronger and far more durable then Hot Rod ever was,=A0he was=A0DARK=\r\n RODIMUS!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; So when Rodimus hit the wall it was not truely pain that =\r\nhe felt, but the elation that a true battle was in the making. He felt that=\r\n charge that all warriors felt when they faced a foe that had some metal! I=\r\nt was an eagerness twisted by Predacon programming into something dark and =\r\nloathsome. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; So when he stood and turned around it was not defeat in=\r\n his stance but derision, &quot;So you fancy yourself to be a Prime do you, scra=\r\nppling?&quot; Rodimus said=A0his tone still mocking as he raised his arm,=A0smil=\r\ning as his optics glowing with energy, &quot;Well let&#39;s see what you got!&quot; With =\r\na thought he fired a blast of plasma energy from his arm mounted cannon at =\r\nthis new incarnation of Tuscon, who for the moment appeared to be posturing=\r\n for Hydras!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; OOC: Remember, the matrix that is housed within Rodimu=\r\ns has no energy of its own, only the housing. It does not have the power to=\r\n reach out and transform anyone, although I do have some ideas. I am not su=\r\nre if you want to redo your post, or let it go as it stands. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Prest=\r\non\n&gt; (Cyclonus/Scourge/Dark rodimus)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
