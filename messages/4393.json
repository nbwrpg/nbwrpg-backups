I have finished the escape tunnel and \ngot the computer systems running.  I also got the auto-defence systems up \nand running.  I just need your help with the scanners and a few other little \nthings is all commander.  I got the internal scanners up and I fixed the \nmain console so you and the other commanders can run the whole base from \nthere.  It will only respond to your voice commands so no one else other \nthan us four  can run it.&quot;\nShe thought for a moment that she was over stepping her bounds.\n&quot;Uh, but I can remove my voice command capability from it if you wish \ncommander.&quot;\n\n\n----------Original Message-------\n&gt;From: crow_lord@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n&gt;Scorponok\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;I told you already, when I got back to the Predacon ship, I found\n&gt;that my room was underattack. So, I snuck behind all of them grabed\n&gt;some stuff and let them leave then I grabbed the rest and came back\n&gt;here.&quot; Scorponok smiled at Darkmouse. It was nice just being here\n&gt;with\n&gt;her. &quot;So hows the base coming along?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
