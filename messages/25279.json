Just had a lot of really good ideas! ^..^\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * He was at the end of the chains which bound him to a wall, \n&gt; straining \n&gt; &gt; against them and putting as much strength into his back and legs \nto \n&gt; try and \n&gt; &gt; break them.\n&gt; &gt; There was something in the sir which was warning him, something \n&gt; that smelled \n&gt; &gt; like something bad was going to happen! And the more time went by \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; stronger that sense got.\n&gt; &gt; The shackles around his wrists were biting deeply into the skin \n&gt; that was \n&gt; &gt; under the gray and white fur which covered his entire body, the \none \n&gt; around \n&gt; &gt; his thickly furred neck choking slightly but unable to do any \nreal \n&gt; damage \n&gt; &gt; through the hair.\n&gt; &gt; His claws bit deeply into the metal floor and left scratched, \n&gt; scaring the \n&gt; &gt; smooth surface. He growled and panted as he strained, his pawed \n&gt; hands \n&gt; &gt; clenched into fists.\n&gt; &gt; His senses were going wild! They kept screaming at him to get \naway, \n&gt; just to \n&gt; &gt; leave this ship and run away as far as he could. Leave everything \n&gt; behind.\n&gt; &gt; \tA woman dressed in a white coat walked up to the alloyed door \n&gt; which was the \n&gt; &gt; only way out of his cell, a notepad in her hand and pencil tucked \n&gt; behind her \n&gt; &gt; ear. She looked into the room through a thickly glassed window \n&gt; crossed with \n&gt; &gt; little wires, looking at him as he kept on working on the binds \n&gt; which held \n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; But he knew this woman, and unlike the other people who would \njust \n&gt; as easily \n&gt; &gt; strap him to a table like so many times before, she was kind and \n&gt; gentle. \n&gt; &gt; Always talking to him whenever she happened to pass his way.\n&gt; &gt; She was the one that wrote down his actions when they were doing \n&gt; projects on \n&gt; &gt; him, watching too see what his reactions would be to them. But he \n&gt; could tell \n&gt; &gt; that she didn&#39;t like the job.\n&gt; &gt; \tHis head lifted and he looked at her, leaning out at the very \n&gt; limit of the \n&gt; &gt; chains and putting all of his weight into pulling. He could tell \n&gt; that she \n&gt; &gt; was concerned, because even though the alloyed door he could \nsmell \n&gt; her.\n&gt; &gt; His ears laid back flat against his head and he whined.\n&gt; &gt; \tThe woman sighed and leaned against the door, looking at \n&gt; him.* &quot; You really \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t like it in there, do you, D?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; * He whined in response and pulled harder on the chains. He \n&gt; understood her \n&gt; &gt; words and could even form a few of them, but other then that his \n&gt; language \n&gt; &gt; was mainly based on howls and barks, growls and snarls.\n&gt; &gt; They had made them, those people in the white coats. With wires \nand \n&gt; bones, \n&gt; &gt; muscle and metal.\n&gt; &gt; They had created a jeen which could combine organic with machine \n&gt; and they \n&gt; &gt; had injected that into a living creature, and after painstaking \n&gt; work and \n&gt; &gt; time HE was finally produced. Just what they had hoped.\n&gt; &gt; He could walk on two legs and could walk on four, had a large \n&gt; mental \n&gt; &gt; capacity and could learn easily and quickly. But he also had the \n&gt; strength of \n&gt; &gt; a machine, his bones flecked with metal that made them harder to \n&gt; break. Just \n&gt; &gt; like his muscles that were flecked too, and his mind. It was \n&gt; incredible!\n&gt; &gt; He could store away images and then get them to come up on his \n&gt; vision \n&gt; &gt; whenever he wanted them to! Even he was impressed with that!\n&gt; &gt; \tBut today, there was just something that was going to happen, \n&gt; maybe \n&gt; &gt; something that was going to go really wrong. He felt it, and he \n&gt; didn&#39;t like \n&gt; &gt; it one bit!\n&gt; &gt; He whined again as the ship seemed to tilt a little, making the \n&gt; woman \n&gt; &gt; outside of his door hang onto the handle to keep her balance. The \n&gt; pad in her \n&gt; &gt; arms slipped and skittered down the hall.*\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Whoa!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; * He growled and shook, the chains rattling. The ship seemed to \n&gt; settle down \n&gt; &gt; and the woman patted at her hair to settle the strands which had \n&gt; escaped the \n&gt; &gt; pins in it. She smiled through the window at him.*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Life&#39;s full of surprises, huh?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * She then left the window where he could see her and \ndisappeared, \n&gt; leaving \n&gt; &gt; him to strain and fight the bonds which held him to a ship of \n&gt; danger.\n&gt; &gt; The ship tilted and shook again, words blasting over a speaker \n&gt; system in the \n&gt; &gt; halls.*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; WARNING! SubGama has slipped into the mainstream of a  class D \n&gt; rift, all \n&gt; &gt; personnel please prepare for turbulence!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * He shook again.\n&gt; &gt; Rift! What was that, was it something to do with space? With the \n&gt; lights \n&gt; &gt; outside the windows?! What was it? What was going on?!\n&gt; &gt; All of a sudden everything begin to glow a bright white, making \nit \n&gt; too hard \n&gt; &gt; for his eyes to adjust so he had to close them.\n&gt; &gt; And that was all he knew last, but there was so much going on \n&gt; outside that \n&gt; &gt; went by un-noticed by him.\n&gt; &gt; \t The entire ships systems had gone offline and the ship was \n&gt; spit out of the \n&gt; &gt; rift, sent tumbling towards some blue and green planet that \nseemed \n&gt; the only \n&gt; &gt; solid thing in the black void of space.\n&gt; &gt; It wasn&#39;t long before the ship entered the weird planets&#39; \n&gt; atmosphere, \n&gt; &gt; becoming a red and melting fireball which lit up the sky. Almost \n&gt; all life \n&gt; &gt; support on the ship had ceased to function, but his chamber was \n&gt; luckily \n&gt; &gt; sealed by the woman and was operating perfectly. Where she was \nleft \n&gt; out with \n&gt; &gt; the rest, to share their fate.\n&gt; &gt; \tThe large scientific vessel thundered towards a piece of land \n&gt; at a slant, \n&gt; &gt; the whole thing shaking and losing large bits a pieces of armor \n&gt; only for \n&gt; &gt; them to drop towards a battle by the sea that it flew over. ( \n&gt; alliance \n&gt; &gt; battle, not the CF.)\n&gt; &gt; The ship skittered over the water for a second as it loses \n&gt; velocity, hitting \n&gt; &gt; the beach and sending up a huge wall of sand. The impact digging \n&gt; it&#39;s front \n&gt; &gt; into the land while the back was lifted up, the weight of the \nback \n&gt; imploding \n&gt; &gt; it into the middle for a moment, hulls breaking in half before \nthe \n&gt; ship \n&gt; &gt; rocked so that it was standing straight up into the air for a \nsplit \n&gt; second \n&gt; &gt; before toppling over. The broken back half of the ship was still \n&gt; carrying \n&gt; &gt; out the velocity of the impact and was sent sliding into a new \n&gt; forest, \n&gt; &gt; plowing trees and anything else in it&#39;s way before finally coming \n&gt; to  \n&gt; &gt; shattered stop in pieces.\n&gt; &gt; Chemical tanks had burst on impact and soon caught fire from the \n&gt; sparking \n&gt; &gt; wires of the ships systems, large explosions occurring in both \n&gt; halves of the \n&gt; &gt; vessel. Burning each piece to the ground, leaving nothing but \n&gt; charred metal \n&gt; &gt; and ash. The occasional burning body of one of the White Coats \n&gt; littering the \n&gt; &gt; ground.\n&gt; &gt; \tHowever, there was also one body that lay across the ground \n&gt; which was not \n&gt; &gt; burning, instead limp as from the first second he had gone \n&gt; unconscious. No \n&gt; &gt; broken bones and breathing in shallow breaths he simply lay \nthere, \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; shackles and chains still around his wrists and neck.\n&gt; &gt; His chamber had been ripped from the ship as it broke in half, \n&gt; carrying it \n&gt; &gt; along with the back half until it had stopped and he was thrown \n&gt; through the \n&gt; &gt; wall and a bit into the forest.\n&gt; &gt; Where he lay still, unmoving and unbeaten.*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ___\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
