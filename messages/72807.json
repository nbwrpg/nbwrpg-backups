He was able to get\n&gt; a quick scan up in the air over at the flying DINOBOTS, or whatever these\n&gt; aerial avians were.\n&gt;\n&gt; For the moment, he did not send out a comm signal to them or announce his\n&gt; presence, just carefully and slowly going forwards, trying to track them.\n&gt; And see just where they were going, or where they were based from.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs the com-links are still down it is probably would not have matter\nif he had tried to send a  signal or not, although a verbal one or\nsomething visual would have worked if he had chosen to do so.\n\nThe three avian DINOBOTS did not seem to be aware of WHEELIE but were\nhovering in the air amd then flapping their wings as their calls\nfilled the air.\n\nSuddenly SWOOP fired a laser blast at the base of a tree, one that was\nclose to the edge of the gorge. However it was a blast that was\nobviously not at full power. For instead of vaporizing the tree or\neven setting the forest ablaze, it merely hit the tree at its base.\n\nThen after a moment there was the sound of cracking and splintering\nand another tree fell across the gorge next to the first one.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
