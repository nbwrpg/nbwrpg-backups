He \nwas \n&gt; letting a Predacon out of the ship, after she had plenty of time to \nscan, and \n&gt; plant bugs in the bridge and in her quarters. As he follows her, he \ntaps his \n&gt; wrist, as screen poping up as his wrist computer activates. Tapping \na few \n&gt; buttons, he activates a complete scan of the ship, to check for any \nforeign \n&gt; objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rex walks faster, coming up to Battera. &quot;Is there any reason for \nthis walk or \n&gt; do you just like to move about?&quot; he asks her, trying to sound \nfriendly.\n\n\n"}}
