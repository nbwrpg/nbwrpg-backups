It was full of moding, not to mention that to \nget to the brig, you&#39;d have to blow through quite alot of walls, which you \ncould not have possibly done with jet power alone.\n\nHitting Scattershot AND POSTING DAMAGE for him, not to mention grabbing Punch \nand also not letting me reply was extreme moding. Posting for the Autoguns of \nMY base, and just plain doing the whole thing in one post was moding. I \nsuggest you rewrite that post, or I&#39;m going to moderate you.\n\n"}}
