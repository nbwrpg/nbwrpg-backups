The answer is simple; they are both my people.\nLook at my spark signature and you&#39;ll know it&#39;s true. The situation\naway from Cybertron is so dangerous that only a handful of Predacons\nor maximals refuse to act in concert, and even less fight against each\nother. I will go for now, but you can call me if you need help or\nanything else.
