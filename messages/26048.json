Even if you are ignoring other people&#39;s posts, you&#39;re still \nresponsible for them, and can&#39;t just ignore them out of the RPG \nwithout moding. Missing posts is understandable, though, and happens \noften, so calm down.\n2. Liono actually flew off a little while before Shadow Cat walked up \nto him (I think). He definetly didn&#39;t teleport (or I&#39;d be giving him \na big lecture).\n3. If you really wanna insult Ryo, do it over private email. Swearing \n(not that I consider &#39;prick&#39; swearing, but some people do) is \nannoying enough IC, and its even more annoying OOC.\n\n(If you really wanna reply to this, please do it over private email. \nThere&#39;s no point in taking up RP space with arguments.)\n\nSorry to everyone else who&#39;s time this wastes. Just needed to get a \nfew things straight.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; (Then explain this, RYO D, how was he talking to Iron Raptor, hmmm? \nI \n&gt; haven&#39;t been able to read my e-mail on the weekend, so sue me, i \ndon&#39;t have \n&gt; internet directly at home. And it&#39;s not like i can READ ALL of the \ne-mails i \n&gt; get. I only have 30 mins to do this stuff, plus i have more \nimportant things \n&gt; to do. Like School. So don&#39;t freak out at me, K? And if your going \nto be a \n&gt; saucy little prick, i just will ignore you! Understand! Just \nbecause i made \n&gt; a little fowl-up doesn&#39;t mean you have to be an ass about it! If \nyou want to \n&gt; be rude, so can I!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Scratch the last post for Shadow Cat, it seems that liono somehow \ntelaported \n&gt; from earth and Iron Raptor, to the moon, where he belongs.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Shadow Cat jogs-up to Iron Raptor, puffing and out of breath, she \nwaves her \n&gt; hands about her, wheezing and coughing from running. She finally \ngives up \n&gt; and squats down to re-gain her breath. When she finally has enough \nbreath to \n&gt; talk, she stands up and looks at Iron Raptor*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We have problems galore chief, but i think we can use this one to \nour \n&gt; advantage.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;RYO D&quot; &lt;striderzero1@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Alten Gould READ THIS\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 22 Jan 2001 19:39:14 -0000\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;((LIONO IS IN SPACE ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.
