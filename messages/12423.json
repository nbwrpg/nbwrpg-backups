Are all the Maximals\n&gt; blind?!  There&#39;s a 45 foot tall gestalt opening fire on the Ark, and\n&gt; a nice sized cache of Predacons opening fire on the Ark and the\n&gt; Maxis!  It&#39;s far from over)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Oblitertron/Punch/BH/Blastrage/Zergling/Ramhorn/Oinker/Unitron:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramhorn saw the door/hatch open after he had saw a very large dent in\n&gt; it appear suddenly.  &quot;Uh...maybe that wasn&#39;t such a good idea.&quot; he\n&gt; said, seeing Oblitertron&#39;s large crimson optics seem to pierce\n&gt; through him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramhorn slowly stepped out of the Ark, Oblitertron&#39;s optics\n&gt; following.  Ramhorn raised his sub machine gun, firing off 20 sonic\n&gt; shells at Cutthroat&#39;s chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Oblitertron raised his left palm to aim at Ramhorn.  Getting it so it\n&gt; would hit him in the back, he was about to fire, but a missile\n&gt; knocked his arm a little ways off, firing off a missile from his palm\n&gt; at the middle of the Terrorcons.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; BH and Blastrage watched Oblitertron fire on the Terrorcons.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I...think it&#39;s time for that tactical retreat...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Uh..yeah.&quot; Blastrage said, firing off three grenades at the Ark from\n&gt; the mounted grenade launcher, the skimmer slowly leaving the\n&gt; battlefield, still aiming the grenade launcher to provide cover fire.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Unitron looked around for someone too shoot, seeing a go for the\n&gt; Terrorcons.  &quot;Blast it! Incompitent gestalt!&quot; he didn&#39;t have his\n&gt; weapons pointed at the Terrorcons, but he had a feeling he may have\n&gt; too.\n&gt;\n&gt; -------\n&gt; Oinker fired off three laser bolts at the Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Punch ducked under the laser blasts, one of them singing his left\n&gt; shoulder.  He returned fire with three laser bolts at Archangel.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Zergling fired off 20 rapid laser bolts at Archangel&#39;s abdomen.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
