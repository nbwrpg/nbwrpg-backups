We discovered his group on the \nfar \n=\r\n&gt;  side of the galaxy. Apparently back during the second Great War \n&gt;  seve=\r\nral Decepticons either left on their own or were exiled by \n&gt;  Galvatron. T=\r\nhey all banded together for all these centuries in \nthat \n&gt;  sector. Eventu=\r\nally Starscream showed up there in the form of his \ndamn \n&gt;  undestructable=\r\n &quot;ghost&quot; spark. They gave him a new body and formed \na \n&gt;  new empire. With=\r\n all their advances they are known as the \nGeneration \n&gt;  2 Decepticons. Th=\r\neir co-lead by Starscream and Jhiaxus. I&#39;m not \nsure \n&gt;  why but Jhiaxus ha=\r\ns some kind of grudge against Rodimus dateing \nback \n&gt;  to the Great War.

It seems that the \n&gt;  Generation 2 Decepticons att=\r\nacked Earth. Cybertronian/Human \nrelations \n&gt;  were reopened when the Maxim=\r\nals sent the majority of their \nadvanced \n&gt;  fighting force to defend Earth=\r\n.
