Let alone being helpfull.  She felt like she was going \nsoft. Maybe being alone in the wild without any contact with other \nbots had made her forget her hard, corse predacon attitude.  \n\n&quot;I have never heard of any bot named silver fox.  I&#39;m sorry. maybe \nthe bots at the base we are headed for know her.&quot;  She couldn&#39;t \nbelieve she was trying to be optimistic.  She shook her head and \nhelped him towards the pod, on the east coast of the North American \ncontinant.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;           Dollen looked at GoldenEye again.  This Predacon was \nactually\n&gt; being nice to him, very unpredacon like.  Oh well, he needed a \nlittle help.\n&gt; \n&gt;               &quot;Hey, thanks,&quot; Dollen said, feeling surprised at \nhimself.\n&gt; Thanking someone was something he never did.  Something most \nPredacons never\n&gt; do.  Another thought of the bot hit him.\n&gt; \n&gt;              &quot;Hey, umm, like I asked a minute ago, do you know of a \nfemale\n&gt; bot with the beast mode of a silver fox??&quot;\n\n\n"}}
