I will keep it short since we do not \nhave \n&gt; much time. It was about 30 Earth years ago. I had just started The \n&gt; Trainers. It was myself, Hammer, Blaze, a bot named Blackstar, and \n&gt; than there was Lightrade. Lightrade was special. We were very \nclose. \n&gt; He had been my best friend since I could remember. He and I always \n&gt; did things together, and kept together in the good times and the \nbad. \n&gt; We had been at war for awhile against another rogue faction named \nthe \n&gt; Bultak, lead by our current Trainer Bullet. We were fighting over \nthe \n&gt; Bultak&#39;s moon base, because it was very important to our \ndomination. \n&gt; We finaly went all out and attacked. During the battle, Bullet \n&gt; damaged Lightrade immensly. There was nothing I could do to save \nthe \n&gt; body. But the spark.....I stored it. I put it in a life-sustaining \n&gt; and have been keeping it all these years. I told him the first \nchance \n&gt; I got a fresh body, I would put his spark back. I would&#39;ve put him \nin \n&gt; Striker&#39;s but Striker&#39;s spark was still there, it just needed \n&gt; programing. I made Bullet pay the ultimae price: I captured him and \n&gt; wiped his memory, making him join us. Eventually he started taking \n&gt; over Blackstar&#39;s work, and she didn&#39;t like that so she left us. We \n&gt; met Ignatius a few months later, and there we are. Our current \n&gt; Trau=iners. What do you think?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
