It sounds crazy, but I can \nhear Phobia.  He says to go to his ship and he can help us.&quot; She \nthought she was loosing her logic circuits.  She stepped back from \nMegatron and bumped against Rowdy. She krinkled her nose and knew \nthat that was a bad move.  She stepped forward and stood closer to \nMegatron.  She turned and looked at Rowdy.\n\nDarkMouse::\nShe looked at Black Aracnia. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do about it. Would \nmy body reject it with the energon in it?&quot; she had a worried look on \nher face.  She wanted to go and fight, not sit in bed for a week.\n&quot;Black Aracnia, could you just send me that drone you spoke of or \nsomeone. I need to get to walking around, I need to be able to \ntransform again.  I want to go kick some Maximal butt as soon as \npossable.  Not sit here and be a burden on you and everyone.&quot;  She \nmoved to the edge of the bed. She scooted off and stood there holding \nonto the side of the bed.  Her legs felt stronger.  She smiled \nthinking that she was getting better.  But she shakes returned. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron gives a menaceing look at both his minions, hands \nstill raised, \n&gt; &quot;Phobia?
