He remembered being in the forest, trying \nto escape a granade, but next part he remembered him waking up in CR fluid. \nHe paniced a little. His eyes were wide, looking around the area, finding \nhimself in familiar surroundings. It was the cave of the Predacon base.\n\nHe shook his head and stood up. He looked over and saw Stingtra. He leaped \nover to her.\n\n&quot;What in tarnation happened?&quot; he asked her, looking back at the CR tank.\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Thu, 29 Jun 2000 17:14:05 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;*Stingtra enters the base and walks into the CR room and sits down holding \n&gt;Quickstrike in her lap* Stingtra: Quickstrike? Come on. Wake up? I think we \n&gt;should just put him in a CR Tank or Chamber. I think CR Tank would be \n&gt;better. *Stingtra stands up holding Quickstrike steps up to a CR Tank and \n&gt;lowers Quickstrike in and watching him to see if he&#39;s gonna wake up* \n&gt;Stingtra: Quickstrike?
