The =\r\nscore is 106 for \nthe Ballers and 102 for the Gorrilaz.  The story so far h=\r\nas been the \nplay by Gorzo.  Gorzo, A rookie from Crystal University is 30 =\r\nfor 34 \nshots made.  10 3-pointers and 15 dunks for a total of 50 points.  =\r\n\nBut can the last rank Gorrilaz with the help of Gorzo beat the first \nrank=\r\n Ballers?  Lets go down to the court to see what happens.  \n\nCourt Side Ann=\r\nouncer:  Hello, we have 20 secounds left in the game.  \nThe Gorrilaz are pa=\r\nssing in the ball as we speak.\n\nA bot wearing a jersey that says &quot;Bentals&quot; =\r\npasses the ball in to a \nbot wearing a jersey thats says &quot;Gorzo&quot;.  Gorzo Dr=\r\nibbles the ball \ndown the court and passes it to a bot with a jersey that s=\r\nays &quot;Bob&quot;.  \nBob then passes it to Bentals and Bentals passes it a bot with=\r\n the \njersey that says &quot;Micko&quot;.  Micko passes the ball to Bentals and \nBent=\r\nals passes it to Gorzo.  Gorzo steps up to the 3-point line and \njumps up m=\r\naking it look like a jump shot.  At the last second he \npasses it to a jump=\r\ning bot, which is by the goal, whose jersey \nreads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned then slams =\r\nthe ball for an Alley-op(SP?).  Bots \nwith a different jersey grab the ball=\r\n.  The bots jersey \nReads &quot;Feller&quot;.  Feller passes the ball in to a bot wit=\r\nh a jersey \nwhich read &quot;Rauq&quot;.  (Time to make Rauq look Stupid.)  Rauq star=\r\nts \nDribbiling the ball down court when he trips over his own feet.  The \nb=\r\nall leaves his hands and rolls into Gorzo hands.  Gorzo, who is \nstanding b=\r\nehind the 3-point line and takes a jump shot.  The ball \nsails into the hoo=\r\np as the Buzzers sounds.\n\nCourt Side Announcer:  HOLY RUST POCKET, THE GORR=\r\nILAZ WIN 107-106.  \nTHE GORRILAZ WIN!!!\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;5 Years Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nThe Bot that =\r\nwas wearing the Gorzo jersey 5 years earlier was in a \nsmall 2 person shutt=\r\nle.  He is Flying around Earth.  All of a sudden \nthe right wing catches on=\r\n fire and falls down towards Earth as the \nshuttle falls down with the wing=\r\n.  The shuttle lands near Mid-Africa \nabout 10 miles from where Dewboys Cha=\r\nracters are.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
