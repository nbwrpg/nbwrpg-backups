He growls.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Follow me,&quot; he says to Waspinator and turns to walk out of the base,\npicking\n&gt; a random direction in the forest but glancing down at his scanner first to\n&gt; make it seem like he was following a signal.\n&gt;\n&gt; There was no way he was going to give anyone anything without reward, not\n&gt; even Megatron. A plan begins to form in his mind. He would take Waspinator\na\n&gt; distance out to the forest and shoot him in the back. Then he would go\njoin a\n&gt; different group, or something to that extent.\n&gt;\n&gt; He pauses at the exit of the base, waiting for Waspinator to follow him.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/13/_/_/_/961718462/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
