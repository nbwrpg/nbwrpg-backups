She wondered why he would do \nthat. No bot ever did that before.  She smiled. &quot;Thanks. But if \nMegatron finds out. I&#39;ll get zapped again. He may even have me \nscrapped.&quot; She looked him and thought she saw something. She couldn&#39;t \nput her finger on it.  Did he really like her, she thought. &quot;I know \nthat I can accomplish the mission if given enough time to work out a \ngood plan. I know that if I could hand over the ship to megatron, \nhe&#39;d be pleased. But, ah heck, I don&#39;t know. Terrorsaur would have to \nin on it too. He&#39;d be a key player in all this. He&#39;s the only one \nthat could fly. But...he hates the idea.&quot; she looked at her drink \nagain. &quot;Unless the whole team worked together, it would never work \nout. That&#39;s my biggest problem right there.&quot; She took a sip of her \ndrink and looked again at the glass.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; DrillBit walked out of KitKat&#39;s room, and followed her to the mess \nhall.\n&gt; He saw her, and sat at the same table.\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t start doubting yourself now. You have alot of potentsial.&quot; He\n&gt; said, attempting to give her a small pek kiss, on the cheek.\n&gt; He was trying to boost her confadance, because the plan searved his\n&gt; plan, and cause he loved her, and new what she could do.\n\n\n"}}
