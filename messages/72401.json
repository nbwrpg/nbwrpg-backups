The large shape of\nSLUDGE and SNARL in their rather impressive beast modes walked past\nthe camera. GRIMLOCK, also in beastmode,  stopped and looked at the\ncamera and roared, and then kept on moving.\n\nDARK RODIMUS looked up at NIGHTLIGHT, &quot;I would not ever want you to\nleave my side.&quot; he said, a strange earnestness in his voice, his otics\nglowing slightly as they looked at the female that stood before him.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
