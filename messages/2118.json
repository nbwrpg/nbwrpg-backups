He was a bit surprised that the \ntwo had already met, but decided not to ask about it. He looks at Striker&#39;s \nwounds, &quot;Do you need any help?&quot;\n\nStriker nods at Iron Raptor&#39;s advice but shakes his head at Prowl&#39;s. &quot;Nah, I \ncan find my own way.

He looks at her face and grins. &quot;I guess he caught us \nquite off-guard, didn&#39;t he?&quot;\n\n"}}
