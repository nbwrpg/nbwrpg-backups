Maximals and Predacons no longer\n&gt; had =\r\nthe large volumes of subspace &#39;room&#39; that that used to be enjoyed\n&gt; by the =\r\nAutobots and Decepticons before the great reduction. However he\n&gt; was still=\r\n ready. He was basically carrying extra rations of energon as\n&gt; well as bas=\r\nic repair supplies and tools he might need to cut and\n&gt; splice with. It was=\r\n not much, but it would do in a pinch.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I have the co-ordinates.&quot; SANT=\r\nON said as he held up the device. At a\n&gt; nod from LEO he began to read them=\r\n, &quot;320.25 by 7218.60 Vector 187.&quot;\n&gt; His words were cool and calm as he read=\r\n them off.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Everyone have them?&quot; LEO said as he looked around. &quot;You fl=\r\niers are\n&gt; going to have to stay in the air, while we ground pounders are g=\r\noing\n&gt; to be here inside the jungle. We will be heading for the same\n&gt; loca=\r\ntion.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME straightened, &quot;Maximals, MAXIMIZE!&quot; he said as he shi=\r\nfed\n&gt; into his beast mode, that of a yellow and brown lion, his roar echoin=\r\ng\n&gt; across the jungle, and at the same time the Fuzors, SANTON and WING\n&gt; C=\r\nALIBER changed form as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Noctorro, Airhammer, Wing Caliber try to=\r\n keep an optic on us from the\n&gt; air, but if you loose sight of us, get to t=\r\nhat location and try to\n&gt; free the others. You know the mission. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO=\r\n PRIME&#39;s voice was nothing if not deep and more resonant. &quot;Any\n&gt; further an=\r\nd we will loose communications. Does anyone have any other\n&gt; questions befo=\r\nre we head in?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; SKY SHADOW had watched silent all this in silence, his=\r\n optics on\n&gt; HYDRAS and LEO PRIME. He did said nothing to LEO, instead he w=\r\nhispered\n&gt; his own orders into his radio, his voice whisper silent, his own=\r\n\n&gt; rations carefully stowed away.\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAt this point, DINOBOT and CRYOT=\r\nEK were obviously escorting HYDRAS, and it was unknown to DINOBOT if LEO PR=\r\nIME had managed to detect the two stealthed PREDACON units of VICE GRIP and=\r\n BLACKARACHNIA.\n\nPausing then, and taking note of the MAXIMAL AERIAL ESCORT=\r\nS.  While the escort of MAXIMALS was too heavy for a plotted assassination =\r\nattempt, but with communications seemingly down according to what was being=\r\n said over the area, if the MAXIMAL LEADER LEO PRIME could be split apart f=\r\nrom his escorts, then perhpas he could be overwhelmed..  AT the ver least, =\r\nan amusing thing to contemplate.\n\nMeanwhile, in the trees BLACKARACHNIA kep=\r\nt her myriad optics in her spider mode peeled, glancing up at the aerial Ma=\r\nximals while she languidly thought about how she could disable thier wingsp=\r\nans.  But, quite simply they were too BIG for her to take out even from amb=\r\nush and with luck on her side and cut off from support.  LEO PRIME had chos=\r\nen his backup well, and there would be nos neak strike.\n\nJust what would th=\r\ney find over out there, and what would they be going after now?  SHe would =\r\nwatch and wait carefully before revealing herself.\n\n\n\n"}}
