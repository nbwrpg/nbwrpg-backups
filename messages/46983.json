Also, this \nwas \n&gt; a space station, and at this time of the night, lights were usually \n&gt; not all bright and sparkle. The other reason was because the \ncommander \n&gt; of the base considered it shook claustrophobia out of his troops.\n&gt; \n&gt; The commander was a huge robot. He was the leader of the Quasacons, \na \n&gt; highly recognized Sadisticon unit in the Predacon ranks. He held \nthem \n&gt; with an iron grip and would never accept their disobeyance. However, \n&gt; he left them sufficient space to give their ideas and express \n&gt; themselves. He was a tough commander, not a tyrant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warhead: All Quasacons meet up on the bridge. We have received \norders \n&gt; and we all get ready now!\n&gt; \n&gt; His voice had boomed loud in the speaker all over the base. That \n&gt; should wake them up!\n\n\n"}}
