The hole had to be filled and sealed.  =\r\nAt the same time he thought deeply about how to go about it. He did not wan=\r\nt to blast it, but he did need to fill it with something solid.\n\n&quot;Perceptor=\r\n, you&#39;re right, we need to fill that hole. I&#39;d rather avoid blasting a miss=\r\nile down there in risk of doing more damage than good.. Perhaps we can put =\r\na sizeable seal in that tunnel that would prevent further invasion yet keep=\r\n everyone safe...  Then after it&#39;s sealed we put a control pannel over it, =\r\nand set a code to keep it sealed.  And only those who know that code, will =\r\nhave access... It seems like the sensible way of keeping them out and every=\r\none safe.&quot;\n\nHe then listens to Cheetor&#39;s attitude toward Perceptor, and tha=\r\nt of the other Maximals.  He sighs.\n\n&quot; I did not say any of this would be e=\r\nasy, Cheetor.  You seem to want the easy way out of everything.  I&#39;m sorry =\r\nbut life does not usually work that way.  Sometimes you must do something w=\r\nith great difficulty in order to acheive your goals.  And trusting Percepto=\r\nr will be difficult for you but he is rewarding us with his kowledge and th=\r\nat alone can be priceless.&quot;\n\nHis tone similar to that of Optimus Prime, Tuc=\r\nson Prime tries his hardest to be patient with the young maximal, knowing t=\r\nhat he too, had been that young vorns ago.  \n\nNight Shift quickly assists i=\r\nn taking care of Rodimus as Rat Trap tries to get the CR chambers functiona=\r\nble for use. After hearing Tucson Prime&#39;s words, he quickly looks over to P=\r\nerceptor and wistles his way.\n\n&quot; Hey, you, Ex Pred, I&#39;m gonna need your sma=\r\nrts over here, if I&#39;m gonna configure the CR chamber properly.  I don&#39;t wan=\r\nna mess this up, especially when Rodimus is involved.&quot;\n\nQuick Stride guides=\r\n Tucson into the Ark, not forgetting about his visual impairment.\n\n&quot;Lord El=\r\nder, Sir, whenever the repairs are complete on Rodimus, I believe Tucson Pr=\r\nime could stand for a few himself.
