He too had never attempted a power =\r\nlink.\n\n&quot; Truthfully Rodimus, I really don&#39;t know if I&#39;m capable of it.  It&#39;=\r\ns just something Straight Shot brought up to me...  If anyone knows about P=\r\nowerlinking, maybe she does.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to them and takes a seat=\r\n.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re right, I really should explain it better to you guys.  I read u=\r\np on it somewhere in some old Cybertronian Archives, when Tucson and I were=\r\n just average Autobots.  It was our favorite past time, ta do research, and=\r\n look up ancient records and artifacts.  Well, in one of those articles, I =\r\nfound something about powerlinking.  And what I read, it stated that becaus=\r\ne Autobots are so well in tuned with each other, and that their bond of uni=\r\nty is unbroken by anyone, it&#39;s their faith in each other, that gives them t=\r\nhe power to transform and form an even stronger bond with each other.. The =\r\nbond of merger.  That means two of you guys, comming together to form one f=\r\normidable warrior.  And I don&#39;t think you guys need a rebuild.  You need a =\r\nspiritual faith in each other, a bond that no one can break, and I know tha=\r\nt when Tucson went looking for you Rodimus, he went looking for you with al=\r\nl his heart.  The power to do the extraordinary, lies within your heart.  I=\r\n know you have it, you just have to believe in yourself, listen to your hea=\r\nrt, and have faith in those who have faith in you.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds. \n\n&quot; I wo=\r\nuldn&#39;t have gone that far if I didn&#39;t think I had faith in you, Rodimus.  M=\r\ny faith in you was renewed the day you fought off that evil hold Hydras had=\r\n on you.  When you could have reverted back to your evil self, you advised =\r\nme to leave before I was destroyed in the rubble.  That took courage, and c=\r\nompassion.  The kind of compassion no power can break.  Not even Hydras him=\r\nself.  You have that power Rodimus, believe in it, and it will allow you to=\r\n do extraordinary things.&quot;\n\nRat Trap walks over to Rodimus in rat mode, wit=\r\nh a smile on his face, and ears straight up.\n\n&quot;You can do this Rodimus, you=\r\n got what it takes, no rebuilds necesary, you got it in you and now it&#39;s ti=\r\nme ta shine.&quot;\n\nTucson then turns to Lord Elder and the others.\n\n&quot; Knowing H=\r\nydra&#39;s weaknesses will be a great asset.  Yes, send Cheetor out to see what=\r\n kind of intel he can gather for us.&quot;\n\nHe turns back to Straight Shot.\n\n&quot;So=\r\n, how would one go about initilazing the powerlink?&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks u=\r\np.\n\n&quot;Okay, so, this is how it works.  You state your name, and verbally giv=\r\ne yourself the command to transform.  If Rodimus were ta try it, he&#39;d do th=\r\ne same.  That will initialize a transformation of both your physcial bodies=\r\n, but not into vehicle form.  Then both of you at the same time, state &quot;POW=\r\nERLINK!&quot;  and depending on which order you chose, in this case, it would be=\r\n better if Rodimus were your eyes, so he&#39;d complete the phase, by stating, =\r\nPOWERLINK, RODIMUS PRIME!&quot;  Annnd bingo!  Two bots, form one formidable war=\r\nrior.  You combine power, wisdom and agilitiy.  And Rodimus would be your e=\r\nyes.&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks to her.\n\n&quot;Wow, and you read this from an old intel fi=\r\nle somewhere...&quot;\n\nShe nodds.\n\n&quot;Yep, that&#39;s right. And according to Cybertro=\r\nnian lore, only the Autobots are capable of doing the powerlink.  Not the D=\r\necepticons or the predacons.  I wonder if this holds true for the Maximals =\r\nas well.. Imagine, if you guys could merge into one formidable warrior.. An=\r\nyway, right now, it&#39;s more important that we fight fire with fire.  But it&#39;=\r\ns like Tucson says.  We can&#39;t force anyone into anything they don&#39;t feel co=\r\nmfortable doing.&quot;  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercy=\r\nclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson turns his head toward Rodimus=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I - I have never tried that... That&#39;s up to you if you wish to a=\r\nttempt it,\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus..&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap steps in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You&#39;re missn&#39;=\r\n out on a power play if ya don&#39;t try it. Flatten Hydras,\n&gt; &gt; stomp out thos=\r\ne big bad bugs... Powerlinking will give you guys the umph\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s gonna t=\r\nake ta take ta not only exterminate those overgrown pests, but\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;ll re=\r\nally put Hydras in his place.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson turns to Rat Trap.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; =\r\nA power play huh? I&#39;m willing to try it, but Rodimus has to also agree to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; something like this. It&#39;s not something I can do without his permission.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Atta boy Wheels. And I can&#39;t think of an=\r\nyone else who&#39;d make a powerful\n&gt; &gt; statement other than you guys.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Tucson turns his head to Rodimus and waits for his reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nRodimus looked at Tuscon, his eyes confused and yet curious, &quot;Umm, how\n&gt; wo=\r\nuld we do that?&quot; Rodimus looked down at himself as if expecting to\n&gt; find s=\r\nomething about himself to have changed - it hadn&#39;t. &quot;I was not\n&gt; built like=\r\n that.&quot; He looked over at Tuscon carefully and critically.\n&gt; &quot;I didn&#39;t real=\r\nize you could do that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus shrugged as he continued to speak, &quot;I =\r\ncan transform, but\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t we have to be rebuilt to be able to do someth=\r\ning like that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I bet that Perceptor could tell us mo=\r\nre about Hydras than he had told\n&gt; &gt; us&quot;said Talon&quot;He had behaved... quite =\r\ntrustful so far, If i remember he was\n&gt; &gt; telling something about Nightligh=\r\nt, just before we leave.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder, who was standing off =\r\nto one side, nodded as he folded his\n&gt; arms over his chest, &quot;Yes, I bet Per=\r\nceptor could tell us much about\n&gt; Hydras. He strengths, his weaknesses, how=\r\n to by pass the security\n&gt; protocols.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheetor nodded stepped up, &quot;YEA=\r\nH! I bet he even knows a back way in\n&gt; that even ol Hydras doesn&#39;t know abo=\r\nut.&quot; He looked to Rodimus and\n&gt; Tuscon, &quot;Just give me the word and tell me =\r\nwhich way to go, and I&#39;m on\n&gt; it!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
