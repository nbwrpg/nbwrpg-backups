His spaceship, a 15 metre in diametre spherical\n&gt; &gt; red orb, collides with an asteroid. Bob&#39;s head smashes into the\n&gt; &gt; small porthole that he had been looking out of. He shakes his head\n&gt; &gt; as his ship bounces off in another direction, heading into an\n&gt; &gt; asteroid field. Bob frowns, and buckles his seat belt, remembering\n&gt; &gt; what his mother had told him, &quot;Buckle Up!&quot; He had just never\n&gt; &gt; thought that he would need to use that information in his life. He\n&gt; &gt; grabs the saftey bars, and waits.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: This is just me fooling around. =P\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
