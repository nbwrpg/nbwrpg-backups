You don&#39;t remember right.  Rampage X, was someone \nwho had the guts to stand up to me when I kept beating him down.  Now he&#39;s an \nequal.  You, aren&#39;t.  You weren&#39;t the only one to stand up to me.  NightLions \nand most of her characters.  Dark Airazor.  A ton of others that I defeated.  \nThe only one who has ever come close to defeating me is BioVenom.  Our fight \nwas interrupted by moders like you.  You never fought me.  I told you to go \nto hell because you were a moding twerp.  What has it been?  Maybe a year or \nso, and no imporvement?  More like you&#39;ve gotten worse.  I butchered weak \nopponents and females for fun or if they were traitors like NightLionos and \nDark Airazor posing as evil.  They had to die.  But I took on anyone who \nchallenged me.  Except people who can&#39;t RPG, like you.    We never fought.  \nAre you drunk?  Is your memory cleared?  I&#39;ve reminded people like Ultra \nOptimus of you, and they said &quot;Wasn&#39;t he some loser who sucked at simming?&quot;.  \nOr to that extent.  We never fought.  I would&#39;ve ended the fight because you \nmoded.  \n    If you&#39;re trying to say I was afraid of &quot;It&#39;s the end of the road, \nUnitron.&quot; because someone was going to stop me, hella wrong.  I was scared.  \nScared that some idiot like you has seen the TF:TM and is quoting it.  It \nscared and sickened me.  And in truth, over chat rooms, I&#39;ve won.  No one \ndefeated me.  No one killed me.  So, in real truth, I, and all my evil \nallies, WON!\n    But this is e-mail RPG, and you&#39;re a crappy leader.  And if you reply to \nthis with more whining, I&#39;m not going to reply because no one should have to \nread more e-mails from then necessary.\n\n"}}
