CyberShark \nwill guid=\r\ne you to the embassy.  I will stay here and..&quot; she paused \nand looked down,=\r\n&quot;I&#39;ll remain here as collateral.&quot; She then looked up \nand looked at the oth=\r\ners.  &quot;Can I go  and get him from the entrance?  \nOr do you want to give hi=\r\nm a security check first?&quot; \n\nHer spark raced as she knew she had finally co=\r\nmpleted part of her \nmission.  She hoped that Iron Raptor would be able to =\r\nbring sence and \nopen mindedness to the peace talks.

It really was a nice\nthought=85\nbut it \n&gt; still didn&#39;t seem a=\r\ns if it was ever going to happen.\n&gt; There had been alliance after alliance =\r\nand every one ended with \nbots being \n&gt; injured and one side betray, peace =\r\nseemed like something out of a \nfairy tail \n&gt; by now. Every bot hoped for i=\r\nt but it never came, the thought of \nreaching \n&gt; peace now seeming more imp=\r\nossible to think of then she would care \nto admit.\n&gt; But even now as she po=\r\nndered Batteras words she was reminded of a \nsaying \n&gt; that she had heard i=\r\nn the past, one that seemed more ancient that \nfirst \n&gt; thought:\n&gt; Even in =\r\nthe darkest of Night,\n&gt; There will=85and always be,\n&gt; A twinkle of Light.\n&gt;=\r\n And in those few words, there stood the hope of the light of peace \nin the=\r\n \n&gt; darkness of this war=85however small it may be.\n&gt; And there=85stood her=\r\n answer as well.\n&gt; Iron Raptor glanced towards Prowl for a moment before tu=\r\nrning her \noptics \n&gt; towards Battera, her answer written all over them as a=\r\n smile \ncreased her \n&gt; lips.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Alright=85I&#39;ll join you and your cause=\r\ns for peace. The\nMatrix knows \nI want \n&gt; it as much as any other bot fighti=\r\nng this cursid war.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But even as she spoke those words she knew that=\r\n there was a 99.9% \nchance \n&gt; that peace wouldn&#39;t be reached and the Beast =\r\nWars would go\non=85but \nshe had to \n&gt; give it a chance.\n&gt; However, just in =\r\ncase she would power up her Second Beast Mode just \nin case \n&gt; the Predacon=\r\ns decided to pull on of their little tricks.\n&gt; Though, first she had to dea=\r\nl with a few more things before she was \nable to \n&gt; leave, things that woul=\r\ndn&#39;t take more then a mega-cycle or so\nat \nmore to \n&gt; sort out.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Tho=\r\nugh, I do have to warn you.
