He then laughed \nout loud at the treacherous robot.\n&gt; &quot;You are no Decepticon.  My Matrix tells me differant.  You are a \ntreacherous Autobot, just like that sniveling Starscream, full of \ntreason and schemes.  Go back to your hole in the wall, I have no \nneed to hear you rant on the identity of Hydras.&quot;\n&gt; Megatron Revived then turned and looked at Maxima.  A curiosity, \nshe could be a great leader.  He could use someone like her back in \nthe Fleet.\n&gt; &quot;Hydras is a throwback.  A mistake.  He is a combination of \nQuintesson programming and Unicron&#39;s lunacy.  He is no leader.  I&#39;ll \neven go as far as to say he doesn&#39;t even have a Matrix Chamber.&quot;\n&gt; He smirked and brought a hand to the center of his chest, where a \nhighly stylized purple insignia resided.\n&gt; &quot;True Cybertronian Leaders are more capable than he.  Why do you \nstay with him?  Do you like living in fear, fear he will one day \ndestroy you with out a single thought?  He can do that, he is more \nthan capable to do so.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; MaximaSR74@a... wrote:\n&gt; Watching the Megatron clone with her crimson gaze, cool & \ncalculated... \n&gt; \n&gt; Then shot a glare at Perceptor. He didn&#39;t seem to assist the \nsituation any. An animal growl towards him, &quot;Watch your metallic \ntongue, Perceptor. Or you will soon enough find it missing!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Then returning her fiery crimson optics back upon the \nClone. &quot;Forgive him. He is alike the others. Predacons know little \nof old Decepticon discipline.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Looking him over as she walked towards him... &quot;You claim to be \nMegatron.. yet,&quot; then started to circle around him in a feline \nmanner, &quot;you claim you are not.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Come back around to the front to face him. &quot;Confusion will not \nwork,&quot; smirking with a purr, placing her long claw hand units upon \nher hips as the wings flexed a moment. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
