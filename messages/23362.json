I am Aerotaur.  I came to answer the call they sent\nout.&quot;  He gestures to Shadow Cat and Snow Tech.  &quot;I know that you don&#39;t know\nme but you might remember Trinity.  I have been caring for her since she\nfell off of your back at the battle.  We have our own little group now.\nIt&#39;s growing.  I would like you to come back and speak with her.\nUnfotunately I don&#39;t know where they are right now.  Windlord should be here\nby now.&quot;  Just then he recieves Windlord&#39;s message.  &quot;This is Aerotaur.  Is\nthere a problem Windlord?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
