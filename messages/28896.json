A shuttle\n&gt; &gt; with bots on it crashed near there a while ago, so bodies would be\n&gt; &gt; scattered. Also, most of the forest is charred from all the\n&gt; &gt; pyromaniacs (namely Pyro) who fought for the Alliance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any idea who the bodies are?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Silver Scout found what appeared to be a carcass of a shuttle,\n&gt; &gt; someone had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; removed the important equipment and left a naked hull. smelling the\n&gt; &gt; air she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; detected rusted metal. she quickly followed and found a horrifying\n&gt; &gt; sight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The remains from the last battle fought. She was hesitant to\n&gt; &gt; search, fearing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that Lady Hawk might be one of the bodies. The mutant knew what she\n&gt; &gt; had to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do, she swiftly shot down the dune into the grave yard, searching\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wreckage for any sign of what had happened here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
