He landed and \nstumbled, a little dizzy. The rage still held him, so he continued, \nrunning toward Cheetor, the next image of a moving object that \ngets through the red haze which is Rampage&#39;s eyes. He transforms \ninto Predacon (G1) mode and begins to sprint towards Cheetor, \nfiring his four machineguns rapidly.\n\nDivebomb turns around, afters circling with a large radius, towards \nthe CF, and starts heading back.\n\n\nOn 11 Apr 2001, at 7:24, RoboRick007 wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: I may have missed a post so if Rampage replyed and I dont respond\n&gt; to it, sorry.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Epyon::\n&gt; \n&gt; He put some distance between them.
