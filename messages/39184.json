Every wire in his body \nstrains at\n&gt; the effort to keep himself upright. Then as he looked out of the \nwindow,\n&gt; his jaw fell wide open. The rock they had crashed into was just as\n&gt; beautiful as he remembered. They had arrived on earth. He felt all \nhis\n&gt; injurys leave him, and leapt up, throwing his fist triumphantly \ninto the\n&gt; air. &quot;Yahhoooooo.&quot; he screamed. He then realized no one else was \naround,\n&gt; he quickly ran along to try and find someone. He eventually stumbled\n&gt; into the storage bay. With bewilderment he started. &quot;Can you guys\n&gt; believe it, it&#39;s magnificent.&quot; he said with pure excitemen, and a \nsmile\n&gt; so large, it looked like his face would fall of his hinges.\n\n\n"}}
