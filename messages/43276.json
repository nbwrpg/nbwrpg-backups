Next he send a commands to his brothers  in order to \nstop Razorcraws and Ender.\n\nKali typed some buttons and two wall slided in each side of the \ncorritor where Silver Scout and Blaze were. Next the femme, pushed a \nbutton and a gas started to araise where Silverscout and Blaze were, \nthat gas would made them sleep a large time.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blaze and Silver Scout continued wandering back toward Shivahs \nlocation when Silver Scout picked up a scent. &quot;Foxfingers?&quot; the scent \nwas strong, like he was close. &quot;Kit Kat and Drillbit were with him, \nhe&#39;s in trouble.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The tigress travelling with the wolf transformed to get a better \nwhif of what the mutant was smelling. &quot;He&#39;s caught, there&#39;s nothing \nwe can do.&quot; she had given up hope of escape. By now her computer \naccess was probably cut off.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We have to save him, I owe my creator that much.&quot; the wolf started \noff in the direction but was quickly stopped.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Then fine, you won&#39;t die alone.&quot; Even without her computer access \nshe could still help, if she couldn&#39;t hack the computer then she \nwasn&#39;t worth the function her motherboard was printed on. &quot;I&#39;ll see \nwhat I can do.&quot; the tigress transformed back to her bot mode. The \nvirus was taking effect eact time she transformed back she could feel \nit impedeing her transformation. Quickly accessing a computer \nterminal she learned that Razor Claw and Ender were still \ntrapped. &quot;Let&#39;s see if I can&#39;t cause a little confusion around here.&quot; \nsoon after the door opened giveing the two bots an escape route.\n\n\n"}}
