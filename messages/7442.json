Perfect creeping ground if that was what they were going to do, but a well place for an ambush as well. But his attention was then turned to Prowl as he exclaimed the answer that he had known all along, simply looking at him blankly.\nThe torture chambers were what he had thought as well, a place where it would be near to impossible to infiltrate. There the room would be reinforced and there would only be one entrance, not to mention decent ventilation but none to the reasonable size for a grown bot to creep through. It was the perfect area.\nDinobot looks back to the shadows of the hall ahead, noting the doors off to the side a few more feet ahead. Nodding once as Prowl exclaims that they should begin there, satisfied that he had actually take not of his concern.\nHe then growled as he felt small vibrations along the floor in which he stood, increasing at the rate of movement. Foot steps! Somebot was coming from�behind. There was no doubt in his mind that if the approaching bot ran into him or Prowl that they would surely know what was going on, not a good idea to remain in the center of the call.\nDinobot looked back towards the direction in which Reptilica had disappeared and simply side stepped to the point where he was ahead of Prowl, his left shoulder-plate brushing against the wall with no sound. This was all done just as Prowl had shouted out his warning, a little too late. By the time the last word was from Prowl�s throat Dinobot was leaning with his back against the wall and his arms crossed, simply looking blankly at the far wall on the other side of the hall.\nDinobot didn�t understand what Prowl had been thinking, perhaps that he was some sort of novice that didn�t know left form right. But if that was what he thought that he was going to get the shock of his life, a trained and seasoned warrior leaning against the wall beside him. He knew what he was doing, knew what to look for and when a bot was approaching from his blind side. He would not have survived the first Beast Wars if he did not know what he did.\nThe only reason for his fate was because he gave into his destiny�while saving the very fabric of Transformer history as well. As he had said before he had parished, �there was nothing to regret.\nDinobot then turns his attention towards Scattershot as he comes towards their position, thinking of how much of a goof he appeared as�talking to a head on his own head! What a joke!\nHe shook his head and clenched his jaw, his tail moving at his side with irritation. *\n\n� These are and fools who miraculously defeat us?!�\n\n* Dinobot snarls into the silencer as he gestures with a claw towards the approaching Scattershot, absolutely dumbfounded of how they could ever defeat the Maximals with such fools posing as soldiers.\nGlancing at Prowl before looking back down the hall and towards the shadows with a shake of his head, crossing his arms again and twitching his tail.\nHow absurd!\nBut then his attention was the drawn towards retrieving Tavatron again, just forgetting about how foolish Scattershot seemed to him. Actually feeling pity for a moment that the Alliance was made of such bots. ( Again, no offence�just what he thinks)\nThe thoughts of what horrid devices in which Tavatron might be in store for�or had already been subjected were out of the question, knowing for a face that such a torture would quickly be stopped once they reached the chambers.\nDinobot then clenched his jaw tightly, standing from his lean from the wall. Indication that it was time to move out again.\nBut there was a promise that he made to himself just before they had started out on this rescue mission, the one Alliance bot to even touch with the intent to harm would be the first one to taste the cold steel of his claws!!\nThere was doubt about it, if one was to pry into his mind�that he was beginning to become protective of her. However, he knew that he shouldn�t. It could be an insult to Tavatron herself, being a warrior and all�being able to take care of herself. But he just�couldn�t help it.\nDinobot then looked towards the shadows of the hall, actually finding comfort in their dark depths.\nHis thoughts a tangle of what he did and did not know, was and was not sure of. He was sure that he had to feel SOMETHING in order for him to be so eager to free Tavatron, but he was not sure what it was or why. But did he need a reason to feel this way? So many questions�and such simple answers. If only he could realize them.\nBut perhaps if he was to ask Tavatron herself one day why he would feel such a thing, why it was so strong yet not?\nIt was worth a shot, but when she was up to it.\nAt the moment Dinobot doubted that she was up to anything, probably half starved and damaged.\nAgain the rage built up in the reptile warrior, causing him to snarl deeply and clench his fist. Yet�without his claw digging into the palm�the sight of mech fluid out of thin air would give them away.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
