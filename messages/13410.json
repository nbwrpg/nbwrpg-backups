She made notes of the hallways and =\r\nrooms \nas she passed them.  She walked slowly dow the halls.  She \ntransfor=\r\nmed into leopard mode andd walked to the CR room.\n\nShe transformed into bot=\r\n form and looked around the room.  She went \nto the cabinets and looked aro=\r\nund for supplies and equipment.  She \nfound small hotbars, welding and saul=\r\ndering tools.  Small power packs \nand rolls of wire.  Electronic regulators=\r\n and ion joints.  She found \nenough supplied here to build 4 or 5 bots if s=\r\nhe chose to.  She \nsmiled nad set up the lab for the injured bots to arrive=\r\n.  She made \nher body language show her being comfortable in the lab. She h=\r\nummed a \nlively tune while working.  She was also thinking of Chordate.  \nD=\r\nespite the fact he was a maximal, he pleased her. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Uh, Yanshosh. Iron Rap=\r\ntor is actually standing up by the window \nnow. But you \n&gt; might have not g=\r\notten the post that states that so maybe we can \njust say \n&gt; that Prowl sto=\r\nod up and went to her? Just a small bit that fixes it \nall up, \n&gt; huh?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; * Iron Raptor nodded but didn&#39;t turn and watch Arcangle and\nSilver \nSti=\r\nng \n&gt; leave, listening but also watching her finger trace small designs \non=\r\n the \n&gt; glass of the window.\n&gt; Her mind was still reeling about Arcangles p=\r\nlan, thinking of just \nwhat she \n&gt; needed to do to pull it off smoothly. Sh=\r\ne already knew that they \nneeded to \n&gt; repair the Ark and get those engines=\r\n set up and online before they \neven \n&gt; thought of placing the Autobots in =\r\nit. Not to mention they needed \nIris to \n&gt; make up the proper auto-pilot sy=\r\nstem for the flight into the \nEarth&#39;s orbit, \n&gt; something that was going to=\r\n be the toughest part of this mission \nyet.\n&gt; Iron Raptor shook her head sl=\r\nightly, there was so much to do and so \nmuch to \n&gt; worry about. In all her =\r\nlife she had never been so busy.\n&gt; But then Felines voice broke through her=\r\n concentration, tilting her \nhead \n&gt; slightly in the fembots direction as s=\r\nhe listened to her speak.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I don&#39;t need to forgive you for anything,=\r\n Feline. You\nhave \nproblems and \n&gt; we&#39;ll just have to work around them unti=\r\nl you bring them to an \n&gt; understanding.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then watched Feline ex=\r\nit the room in the corner of her eye, \nthen \n&gt; turning her head and looking=\r\n out of the window again with a sigh. \nHer mind \n&gt; going back to the missio=\r\nn at hand as well as the one they had to \nget down to \n&gt; as soon as they go=\r\nt back.\n&gt; Either mission couldn&#39;t be too difficult, she had to admit that \n=\r\nthere were a \n&gt; fair amount of events that could go wrong but they would wo=\r\nrk \naround them.\n&gt; But then she heard Felines dainty foot-steps again, wond=\r\nering just \nwhy the \n&gt; fembot was returning for. But once she heard Feline =\r\nspeak she knew.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Room 6-20 and just up from the hallway where the ar=\r\nmory is \nlocated. You \n&gt; can&#39;t miss it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor had actually pa=\r\nid attention to where Prowl had taken \nher after \n&gt; her Alliance ordeal, lo=\r\noking at the details of the rooms she passed \nand \n&gt; making note of their l=\r\nocations.\n&gt; But now there were more important things to worry about, like \n=\r\nthinking about \n&gt; the condition of Tavatron and Dinobot when they found the=\r\nm. \nThinking about \n&gt; how close they would be to the Alliance base and how =\r\nattack was \nmore likely \n&gt; then anything else, lucky as hell if they weren&#39;=\r\nt.\n&gt; Though, as her finger traced another pattern in the glass she felt \na =\r\nhand \n&gt; slip around her but knew whom it was. She would always know\nProwl&#39;s=\r\n \ntouch, \n&gt; and the feel of it nearly made her forget that he had gotten he=\r\nr \nback with \n&gt; an insult that had gone just a little bit too far.\n&gt; Iron R=\r\naptor&#39;s optics narrowed at the thought of that insult, \nknowing that \n&gt; she=\r\n really wasn&#39;t angry about it but a woman&#39;s weight was a\ntouchy \nthing and =\r\n\n&gt; she didn&#39;t like it made fun of. Though, her revenge for that\ninsult \nwas=\r\nn&#39;t \n&gt; through yet.\n&gt; But when she heard Prowl speak and looked up seeing h=\r\ner own \nreflection in \n&gt; the glass but actually looking at Prowls. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\n Yes. I&#39;m going with Arangles plan. It&#39;s fairly clever\nif you \nthink about =\r\n\n&gt; it long enough, and has a very high possibility of actually \nworking.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; * Her mind was wondering again from the thoughts about their \nmissio=\r\nns, \n&gt; actually dwelling on the feel of his touch instead of them. But \nthe=\r\nn she \n&gt; shook her head slightly to clear it, reminding herself that she wa=\r\ns \nstill in \n&gt; the process of making him pay for that insult.\n&gt; Iron Raptor=\r\n looked down at his hand on her waist and then up at \nhim, her \n&gt; expressio=\r\nn being that of a look that reflected her words. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And just what do =\r\nyou think YOU&#39;RE doing?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She put a hand on her hip and the other on =\r\nhis that was on her \nwaist, her \n&gt; fingers working to pry each one of his f=\r\nrom the grasp her had on \nher. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; `Heavy as a TRUCK,&#39; huh? Well, you =\r\nthink you can just\ncome over \nhere and \n&gt; touch me like this? I think not.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; * At the last word she finally pried his hand free and let it fall, \n=\r\nthen \n&gt; taking a few steps away from him and walked over to the projector \n=\r\nand turned \n&gt; it off. Making sure that she swung her hips a bit while she h=\r\nad \nwalked to \n&gt; tease him. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re going to pay for the insult, Mi=\r\nster. And this is\nyour \n&gt; punishment=85until you learn you lesson.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * =\r\nAnd it was, that he wasn&#39;t allowed to touch her for a little\nbit. \nOf \n&gt; co=\r\nurse she would stop once he learned his lesson, slag knew that \nshe \n&gt; woul=\r\ndn&#39;t be able to keep this up forever. *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n__________________________=\r\n____________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E=\r\n-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information a=\r\nbout yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com=\r\n.\n\n\n"}}
