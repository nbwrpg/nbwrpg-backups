However as they stepped onto t=\r\nhe platform,\nMarauder turned and the =91balcony=92 began to lower itself do=\r\nwn the very\nwall of the chasm, into the depths below them.\n\nThe balcony cam=\r\ne to a stop, depositing them on a level much lower than\nbefore. The air her=\r\ne was hotter, and filled with sulfur as well as\nother toxic gasses. The hal=\r\nl here was also large, its walls smooth,\nthe stone so slick they looked muc=\r\nh like glass.\n\nAs Marauder led Lamia down the hall, different tunnels leadi=\r\nng off to\nother areas branched off as they walked. Eventually they came a l=\r\narge\noutcropping of stone and rock, one that protruded out and overlooked a=\r\n\nvery large chamber nearly 50 meters below them.\n\n=93Here we are!=94 Maraud=\r\ner said as he gestured his hand at the chamber\nthat lay beneath them.\n\nIn t=\r\nhe chamber metal power cables running along the walls like some\ndark metall=\r\nic snake, each of them connected to what appeared to be\nrecharge chambers, =\r\nat least ten of them were visible - all of the\nchambers appeared to be lit,=\r\n but if they had an occupant it was\ndifficult to tell.\n\n=93Each of these ch=\r\nambers holds a soldier that will be link of the chain\nthat will defeat the =\r\nCybertronians that litter this world like\nrefuse.=94 Marauder looked back a=\r\nt Lamia, =93and here we are at the\nprecipice of victory.=94 He said.\n\nAs th=\r\ney talked a figure strode across the floor beneath them, the one\nidentified=\r\n as Dirge earlier. He walked to the center of the room, a\nplace where many =\r\ncables came together.\n\n=93Soon! Soon, we will be able to wake all of our so=\r\nldiers, but now we\nwill awaken the first.=94\n\nBeneath them Dirge activated =\r\nsome sort of control and four of the\nchambers were lit even brighter as pow=\r\ner was fed into them. The\ninterior of the pods swirled with light and energ=\r\ny as something seemed\nto come into being within them. Then with a sudden bl=\r\nink the power of\nthese pods shut down, the doors clicked and then slid open=\r\n, allowing a\nsingle figure to emerge from each.\n\n=93Greetings!=94 Maruader =\r\ncalled from above to them. =93Who are you, and who\ndo you serve?=94\n\nThe fi=\r\nrst one to answer stepped forward, his movement all aggression\nand force. H=\r\nis armor was predominantly green with yellow on the legs\nand arms. Just the=\r\n look of him was large and strong. =93You can call me\nBARRAGE!=94 he said, =\r\n=93Because when I lay down my firepower, nobody gets\nup!=94\n\nThe next one t=\r\no move is hued in similar colors, with giant insect like\nwings rising from =\r\nhis back. His red optics look up at Marauder and\nLamia, =93You can call me =\r\nRANSACK!=94 this one said, his voice dark and\nominous, =93and what doesn=92=\r\nt fall to him will fall to me!=94\n\nAnother stepped forward, this one hued i=\r\nn supple brown armor, great\nhorn like structures rising from his back. =93W=\r\nhat=92s mine is mine . . .=94\nHe said as he chuckled =93. . . and what=92s =\r\nyours is mine as well.=94 He\nfolded his arms behind his back as if hiding s=\r\nomething, =93You can call\nme =93CHOPSHOP!=94 he said, another slight chuckl=\r\ne escaping him as he\nstopped and looked up as well.  =93And you=92ll find o=\r\nut what I can do.=94\n\nThe last one to step forward seemed somehow more aggr=\r\nessive then the\nothers, more sure of himself. Even as he moved forward, the=\r\n others\nseemed to give way, almost as if they didn=92t what to touch him. H=\r\ne was\ngreen and orange with what looked like a horn or stinger that rose\nfr=\r\nom his head. =93I am VENOM.=94 He said, his voice deep and powerful,\ncarryi=\r\nng across the room, =93and I command these soldiers.=94 At Venom=92s\nglance=\r\n the others, they each nod once and then looked back up.\n\nVenom looked up a=\r\nt Marauder, =93And we serve you Lord Marauder, you and\nthe might of UNICRON=\r\n!=94\n\nAbove them Marauder nodded back at Venom and then the others, =93Yes =\r\nmy\nsoldiers, this is only the beginning. There are more that I must\nbring.=\r\n=94 He smiled evilly, =93Yes, more indeed.=94\n\nBWAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\n"}}
