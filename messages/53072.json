I&#39;m not having it on my head for her to \nmiss out on the perfect opportunity to solidify that bond.\n\nClosing her mind to all else in the world, Empath takes the Soul Orb \nfrom her subspace compartment and sets it on the table in front of \nher.  It calls to her briefly, then she shuts that out as well and \ntakes out a tiny holo-projector.  When she flicks it on, a six-inch-\ntall image of a familiar black Seeker greets her.\n\n&quot;Skywarp, what do I do?&quot; she asks it, tears welling up in her \neyes.  &quot;It seems like only yesterday that I saw you for the last \ntime - and now I&#39;m falling for a Maximal, of all things.  I know it&#39;s \nbeen centuries since you died, but I still feel like I&#39;d be betraying \nyou to admit to Windlord that I ... I ...&quot;\n\nThe telepathic femme can&#39;t finish her own sentence.  Cradling the \nprojector in her arms, she bows her head and cries quietly.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Subtlety never was your strong suit was it ... oh wait ... \nnevermind \n&gt; that I forgot I&#39;m not supposed to be sarcastic.

There was a severe lack of fruit.  This might&#39;ve been \nbecause he \n&gt; never found the mess hall but that thought hadn&#39;t occurred to him \nyet.  \n&gt; Neither had the fact that he had been walking in circles through \nthe crew \n&gt; quarters area for quite some time.  Well, on his umpteenth trip \ndown one of \n&gt; the halls he happened upon the brooding Empath heading into her \nroom.  She \n&gt; hadn&#39;t seen him of course although she should have sensed him.  \nPerhaps she \n&gt; was just too distracted he thought to himself.  Regardless he \nturned around \n&gt; and walked the other way searching for more fruit and maybe his \nfriend too, \n&gt; but only if he wanted fruit.\n\n\n"}}
