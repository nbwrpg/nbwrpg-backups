Why would someone rush headlong into an enemy base,\n&gt; knowing that they would quickly bring to bear all the security\n&gt; measures\n&gt; that had on the intruder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pressing button on the control panel beside the room door he checked\n&gt; the condition of the room. The result was of course a single\n&gt; occupant,\n&gt; and that the room was totally shielded and powered down. So the room\n&gt; that could be an arena for battle was now doubling for a temporary\n&gt; cell. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Perceptor&quot; Myrmidon called over the short range intrabase\n&gt; communications, &quot;Report to my location, I believe I have our intruder\n&gt; pinned.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Myrmidon waited went back to staring at the door as he crossed his\n&gt; arms over his massive chest, his optics narrowing. &quot;DECEPTICON! !&quot; He\n&gt; called through the door to malice, &quot;You were a fool to enter this\n&gt; base.\n&gt; What are you looking for?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Myrmidon)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Malice:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hearing and detecting the security measures being implaced to keep\n&gt; &gt; him in the room, he could safely change forms.
