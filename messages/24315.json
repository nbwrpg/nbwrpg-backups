His tail swinging behind him as he watched \ncarefully.\nHowever, he wasn&#39;t about to let the bot go with something as simply as \nbefore. He was going to go into stasis lock before he left him alone!\nDinobot growled and aimed his optic laser towards the center of Sixshots&#39; \nstructure, sighted and fired two quick rounds of four deadly charges.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
