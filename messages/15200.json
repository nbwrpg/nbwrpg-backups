The only way Phobia \ndoesn&#39;t get it is if He, Dollen and Goldeneye vote for the same \nperson. And if they do that were screwed. There would be no way to \ntie break. There would be on 5 votes, but not six. But one more vote \nfor Phobia would ensure victory. Alright guys, what&#39;s your vote. You \nguys decided. I&#39;m going to have a little rest. The pain&#39;s getting \npretty heavy.&quot;\n\nStarscream walked for a few metres saw a little pond through the \nbushes. He went to Octopus mode and went in. the water felt soothing. \nHe was still within ear shot, so he could hear the last votes.\n\n\n"}}
