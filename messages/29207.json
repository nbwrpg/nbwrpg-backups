It was true that he had to revert to beast mode.  He\n&gt;reverted to his winged centaur mode.  He brandished his bladed staff over \n&gt;his\n&gt;head again.  He was now taller and stronger than before.  &quot;Are you sure you\n&gt;wanted to do that?&quot;  He sets his arm holding the staff straight at Recon.  \n&gt;He\n&gt;grips his wrist and pulls back to his elbow.  With that he releases a\n&gt;glimmering arrow aimed at Recon&#39;s head.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
