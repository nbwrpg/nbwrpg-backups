He\n&gt; wants to rule the universe.  I can&#39;t blame him for that. It&#39;s in his\n&gt; programming to be a great leader.  But, I...I...I just can&#39;t betray\n&gt; him, even for my own good. it&#39;s in my programming.  I can&#39;t just not\n&gt; obay him. Everything I do is for him. I know I can take the ship, and\n&gt; maybe even leave Megatron behind. But I can&#39;t just do that to him.\n&gt; Sure I get mad at him, but he is still my leader.&quot; she looked at the\n&gt; floor feeling at a loss.  She was a pred who wanted what every other\n&gt; Pred wanted, to get rich, destroy the maximals and all those who\n&gt; stood in their way, to follow orders from thier leader.  But, now,\n&gt; she was starting to question everything.  She had never faultered or\n&gt; wavered from her programming before. Now, she was finding trouble\n&gt; with every thought that entered her mind. She turned and looked at\n&gt; the others.  She knew she had to be strong for them.  Now she felt,\n&gt; not like that warrior and strong guide like she was used to, but like\n&gt; a wolf pup who couldn&#39;t make up her mind on anything.  She suddenly\n&gt; felt vulnerable.  She gave a brave smiled to the group.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I have some things to attend to.  I shall need your help, Time Bomb,\n&gt; Land Mine, Etchingar, Please make diagrams of all ideas you come up\n&gt; with for entering the base.  Any other ideas on weapons, like the\n&gt; liquid energon that Drillbit came up with, anything that you think\n&gt; of, write it down, draw it up and I&#39;ll look at all of them in a\n&gt; little while. This will be a team effort.  And it will take everyone\n&gt; in the team to make this work.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She turned to Phobia,&quot;Please see me in my quarters, we can talk\n&gt; there.&quot;  She turned and walked out of the room and to her quarters.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Megatron wouldn&#39;t be happy&quot; Phobia said, all eight eyes on Kit Kat.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Megatron wants all power for himself, you take this ship and he\n&gt; will feel\n&gt; &gt; out foxxed by a wolf.&quot; the words weren&#39;t meant to sound so odd but\n&gt; they were\n&gt; &gt; true. &quot;If you did something that he took credit for then he\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t settle\n&gt; &gt; for council status, he would attempt to overthrow the council.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; he put his arm around KitKats shoulder &quot;You know where you would be\n&gt; stuck in\n&gt; &gt; that hopeless war. Don&#39;t you?&quot; his beedy little eyes focused on\n&gt; hers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
