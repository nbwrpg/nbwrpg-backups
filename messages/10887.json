He wished Ramulus were here, the ram was much better at \nnegotiation than him.\n\n&quot;Allright, let her go and you can go peacefully,&quot; he says to Rush and the \nothers, &quot;If you kill her, we&#39;ll be forced to attack you.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus, Brix, and Fliq stop as something flies overhead, their scanners \npicking up a non-Maximal signature.
