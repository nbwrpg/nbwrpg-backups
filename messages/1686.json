He thought with his, damage it wouldn&#39;t help too\n&gt; much.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked back at Mentella. &quot;Yer joinin&#39;?&quot; His voice was a little quivery\nto\n&gt; sound tough and solid as he usually was.

He\n&gt; wanted it to stop. &quot;S-stick wit&#39; us.&quot; Then he quickly added, &quot;Jus&#39; don&#39;t\ngo\n&gt; near Hell Beast!
