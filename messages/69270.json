Perceptor Activated all =\r\ninner and \n&gt; outside dedfences who instatntly starts to shoot agains Megatr=\r\non, Kup \n&gt; and Grymlock, as well as Cyclonus and Scourge, inside.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydr=\r\nas and Jhiaxus opened fire against Scourge and Cyclonus. \n&gt; Perceptor hoped=\r\n that Dark Rodimus soon be ready and join to repel the \n&gt; unpleasant visito=\r\nrs outside\n\nCyclonus looked quizzically at Hydras for a moment, &quot;Oh, you th=\r\nink\nsuperior firepower is what I meant about being worthy?&quot; \n\nStepping back=\r\n a pace Cyclonus mearly extended his hand as Hydras&#39;\nblast came at him.

They had trouble locking on, not ju=\r\nst\nbecause of Scourge&#39;s sensor scattering armor, but because Cyclonus was\nn=\r\no longer registering a minion of Unicron but as a pure Decepticon, as\nhe ha=\r\nd once done . . . or will do.\n\nBlasting a door inward Scourge stepped insid=\r\ne to avoid any other\nattack, &quot;Come on Cyc.&quot; he grunted as he stepped into t=\r\nhe door, wary of\nany attack from the interior of the room. \n\nCyclonus nodde=\r\nd as he spoke to Hydras, &quot;Until you are able to look\nbeyond this base, or e=\r\nven this feeble world you are not the leader for\nwhich the decepticons seek=\r\n!&quot;\n\nCyclonus stepped through the door Scourge had blown open, and with\nonly=\r\n the slightest touch of power blew out another door, revealing a\nhall. \n\nCy=\r\nclonus nodded as he and Scourge shifted modes and flew onward,\nattempting t=\r\no escape!\n\n\n\n\n"}}
