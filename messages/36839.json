Quickly the ship unleashed a blast from the Vile cannon at the\n&gt; trainers base shields, the blast just as big as it was the first time\n&gt; it was used. It then locked onto the Infecticon ship and fired all\n&gt; four multi phase laser cannon blasts that were about to blow under the\n&gt; strain of the charging. The infecticon ship is hit bythe blasts as the\n&gt; lasers pierce its shields, a moment later it fires back at the\n&gt; Violator with one of its massive cannons making on of the thrusters\n&gt; explode outward. Inside Vile and the others fell over from the blast.\n&gt; Vile then stood and set a course for Antartica.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vile: &quot;With any luck the Infecticon ship wont pursue...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The violator then began to fly away from the trainer base. As this\n&gt; happened the weapons fire that was fired at the Infecticon base were\n&gt; stopped by its shield that for the most part was invisible. The ship\n&gt; began to reposistion itself and once again it fired down the column of\n&gt; light at incarcinator, the 8 rings following down to surround him. As\n&gt; this happens 4 massive cannons along the edges of the ship begin to\n&gt; aim at the trainer base before each fires a massive blast at the base,\n&gt; each blast would go through the shields even with the variable\n&gt; shielding.(Heh this is a tech on the Infecticon ship, the eight main\n&gt; cannons on the ship are able to pass through all shields no matter\n&gt; what since they absorb the shields energy into the blast to create a\n&gt; hole in them. Yan has the bio and alloran already knows of this so...\n&gt; shielding for the trainer base is useless since these blasts are not\n&gt; like anything anyone has seen before. Whee not like they&#39;ll matter\n&gt; much longer since this ship is going to crash into the ocean in a bit)\n&gt; As this happens two blasts from within the ships metallic ring like\n&gt; structure fly down at Slyaer as another two fire down at starscream,\n&gt; another 4 at the Trainers base shields, these blasts would not\n&gt; penetrate the shields since they were from other weapons.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; #1 OK, the way the post was set up it sounded like the six photon\n&gt; torpedos\n&gt; &gt; and the two megas were coming from the same weapon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #5 Transporter technology should still be considered as a form of\n&gt; &gt; teleportation because it gives one side an unfair advantage,\n&gt; especially when\n&gt; &gt; it can be broadcast into a base like that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyways\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The shields adapt as they were designed to to deflect the multphase\n&gt; weaponry\n&gt; &gt; and the laser cannons. The Photon torpedos detonated on impact\n&gt; shaking the\n&gt; &gt; base, Ignatius was nearly paniced by the nightmares and the shaking\n&gt; base. He\n&gt; &gt; rushed over to the computer, &quot;Redirect all eccess shield energy into\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; repulsor shields, direct it at that ship.&quot; His orders would leave\n&gt; the base\n&gt; &gt; as a potential target for the Predacons if that much energy was\n&gt; expended.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t think so Ig!&quot; a voice called out over the speakers of the\n&gt; base.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That would be a major tactical mistake..&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The voice was familiar to the insane Trainer, it was one he hadn&#39;t\n&gt; heard in\n&gt; &gt; ages, since it had ceased on the planet Hydrus 4. The fifth member\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; Prebons old unit  was in the computer. Prebon must have downloaded\n&gt; his spark\n&gt; &gt; into the computer before they&#39;d left. &quot;I&#39;m taking over from here.&quot;\n&gt; he said\n&gt; &gt; scanning the situation. Ignatius tried to override the computer but\n&gt; was met\n&gt; &gt; with unexpected force. The Stasis field changed frequency, it now\n&gt; held\n&gt; &gt; Ignatius trapped with the others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Repulsor shields let out a wave drawing energy from the very\n&gt; torpedos\n&gt; &gt; that were trying to destroy it. the explosion  shook the trainer\n&gt; base even\n&gt; &gt; more,  disabling the repulsor array. Now the Autoguns and variable\n&gt; freq\n&gt; &gt; shield were thier only defenses left. Autoguns continued fireing at\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Violator. They had trouble locking on target so they couldn&#39;t aim\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; anything critical. The only thing they could do was aim for where\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; weapons fire was comeing from.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Other weapons struck the shields. Two autoguns turned and fired\n&gt; three shots\n&gt; &gt; each three at Starscream and three at Incarcinator\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;Legendarynemasis@a...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 06, 2001 10:47 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a few serious questions/comments concerning this post.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #1- isn&#39;t it illegal to fire eight missles/ procectiles from 1\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weapon?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #2- Cyanide is in a Stasis field so he wouldn&#39;t be able to\n&gt; scream\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #3 Theres already 1 seemingly indestructable ship in the battle,\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it legal to bring in a second?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #4- The Trainer base has it&#39;s shields up so how could you\n&gt; teleport\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything through them?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #5- I thought Teleportation was outlawed because of the abuse of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #6- can I intercept the extra missles to lower the firepower\n&gt; down to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; legal standards?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #1 theres 8 laser cannons on the violator. Therefore 8 singular\n&gt; blasts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are legal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #2 Ill change that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #3 both ships are going down soon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #4 Its a beam of light it goes through the shield like sunlight\n&gt; does\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #5 Its not teleportation its an advanced transport system. Yan has\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bio for the ship in which it is explained\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll reply to the post when I get a response.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   From: Legendarynemasis@a...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Sent: Tuesday, June 05, 2001 12:27 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   The violators shields quickly went down as the scorpion tank\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Skywarp was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   launched off the trainer base. A door opened below the ship\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the scorpion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   tank quickly entered as did Gemini 1 and two. Vile turns to\n&gt; Gemini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 and 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   and growls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Vile: &quot;Cyanide may be caught but now these fools will all be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Goodbye Cyanide you haved risked yourself for us all.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   And with that Vile opened a small compartment at his control\n&gt; &gt; &gt; console and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   pressed it. Immeidately two Mega photon torpedoes, six photon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; torpedoes, four\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   laser cannons, the four multi phase laser cannons, and both\n&gt; mega\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cannons,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   shooting 3 shots each opened fire on the triaer base followed\n&gt; by a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; massive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   blast fired at the base from the Vile cannon. As this happened\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vile shook his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   head and began to walk away when the Violator was hammered by\n&gt; 8\n&gt; &gt; &gt; massive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   blasts causing the ship to shake violently and throw Vile and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Methos from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   where they were standing. Vile then got up and growls as\n&gt; Gemini 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rushed to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   his console and brought up a visual of a massive portal, with\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; infecticon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   ship exiting it and hovering over the trainer base.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Vile: &quot;Infecticons... prepare to open fire on that ship with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   have.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   On the Infecticon ship two black beings seemingly made of\n&gt; energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look at two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   orbs in front of them, one displaying Predacon and X-Predacon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   signatures as well as some unknown types. One orb begins to\n&gt; glow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   center of the large dark control room a bright circle of light\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appears. As\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   this happens, a column of light shines striaght down and into\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trainer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   base(dont worry this isnt an attack) and engulfs cyanide,  who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; immediately\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   goes into a panick.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Cyanide: &quot;No they&#39;re here! Help! Help!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   As cyanide screams 8 rings appear around him before he himself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; turns into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   being of light. Soon he dissapears with the rings forming a\n&gt; sort\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of bulge in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   the column which quickly speeds up the beam of light and into\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Infecticon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   ship...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
