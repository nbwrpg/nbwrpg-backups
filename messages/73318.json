He knew Leo =\r\nwas right.  They had to leave before they too became culprits of the Earth&#39;=\r\ns destruction.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; To allow this planet to grow without our intervention=\r\n is the greatest gift we can give to it.  In due time, those who evolve nat=\r\nurally will take great interest in conserving the planet they live on.  But=\r\n first, Leo is right, we have to get everyone off this planet and return to=\r\n our rightful place, our own home, Cybertron.  It wont be easy but we can a=\r\nchieve this.  The planet has already spoken up and it&#39;s time we listened.  =\r\nFor now we protect this world by subduing those who strive to destroy it. &quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; He then spots a bird who has just landed on his shoulder.  He remains=\r\n perfectly still as it begins to chirp for him.  He listens with a smile on=\r\n his face.  The bird flutters off after a moment and returns to the tree it=\r\n came from.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; After all, this is their world, we&#39;re just their guests,=\r\n who may have worn out our welcome.  Then again...  Maybe not...  Look.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; He gestures to a flock of tropical birds, who seem to be perched all aro=\r\nund them.  The colors of their wings are displayed as the flutter them.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Nightshift gets up and limps over to the outside .\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Wait up guys, I=\r\n just wanna see what&#39;s out here.. Wow..  Check that out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He sits down=\r\n next to Tucson.  Straightshot joins them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m gonna miss this plane=\r\nt.   Look how beautiful those birds are.  We don&#39;t have anything like this =\r\nback home.  &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstride walks up and nods.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; That makes two of =\r\nus.  I wish Uproar could see this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; For a moment they take the time to=\r\n take in one of Natures finest wonders.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Local artist who special=\r\nizes in illustration, using traditional and digital media.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I also sp=\r\necialize in hand made crafts.
