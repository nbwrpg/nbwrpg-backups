His towering form\nplaced her in his shadow. The dragon took a good close look at the bot who\nappeared to be in charge. Her look had changed since the predacon files he&#39;d\nstudied but there was no mistaking that the bot standing tall before him was\nnone other than Iron Raptor.\n\nTransforming to his freakish robot mode Megaton shrunk down to a size more\ncompatible with hers. He still stood slightly taller than her but they were\nnow equals none the less. &quot;My name, my dear, is Megaton, rank will be leader\nof all predacons.&quot; He stepped back a step to appear less menacing. &quot;As you\nmay already know the Predacons are split into seperate factions making my\nopposition ripe targets. Destroy the other leaders and the Predacons will be\nreunited.&quot; He knew that the information he was giving the maximals didn&#39;t\nsound very convincing but there was a twist that he&#39;d left out. &quot;I know that\nyou&#39;ve recently taken quite a bit of damage from attacks, I offer the\nprotection of my faction in return for your assistance.&quot; As added incentive\nhe added, &quot;If a single bot such as myself walked up to your front door\nimagine what a group with a dozen warriors could do.&quot;\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Megan Solmonson &lt;tmrattrap@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 4:49 PM\nSubject: Proving Ground.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Yan says I should post more.
