He feels the \nship tilting and his mask drops a bit, &quot;Oh no...&quot; He starts running \ntowards the control room. He tests his commlink, opening a \nbroadcasting for all Autobots, &quot;Autobots, this is Commander \nPacifix, reports status immediately.&quot; He keeps running.\n\nCrossroads walks out of the room he was in to see the Dinobots. \nHe begins to slide into Grimlock, but stops himself before what \nmight have been unpleasant. &quot;Whoa, what&#39;s going on here...&quot; He \nsays to everyone and no one at the same time. Walking, with \ndifficulty, over to a side seat, he sits down, and grabs a bar and \nholds on. Hearing Pacifix he does just that, reports. &quot;Crossroads \nhere, looking about 100%, but I&#39;d sure like to know what just \nhappened there...&quot; He closes his commlink, slightly bewildered.\n\nPacifix arrives at control room, and discovers that the ship is in \nworking condition, but only minor thrusters are operational. For \nsome reason, the larger rear burst thrusters had been destroyed \nbeyond repair during the... unknown anomaly. Checking the \nscanners, he finds that the ship is falling quickly towards a small \nisland, surrounded by littles islands, and two continents, one larger \nthan the other.\n\nPacifix immediately fires the remaining thrusters, and starts to try \nto slow the ship down. He opens a commlink to JetV, &quot;JetV, get to \nthe control room now.&quot; He keeps putting maximum power into \nslowing the ship down, and leveling it out for the enevitable crash \nlanding on the island straight ahead.\n\n"}}
