The scene \nlooked like a battle was brought out of know but at the same time \neverywhere. Almost as if the barriers of the dimensions folded into \ntwo. SureStrike begins to anlyze the scene. He looks towards Cooley \nand says &quot;Well I can pickup Dragos and Argos weapons fired here. But \nthis is confuzing. It is almost as if the other set of weapons fire \nis Identical yet seperate from the Dragos, As if there was a clone.&quot; \nCooley looked towards SureStrike as if in confusion. &quot;How was our \nweapons cloned. I mean they are designed to use no traceable \nsignal.&quot; Cooley said. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well there is a way, But that is if we are cloned.&quot; SureStrike \nreplied to Cooley with a concerned look to him. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If that is the case then what are we doing we need to find Dragos \nans Argos before they die. That is if they aren&#39;t already dead \nthemselves.&quot; replyed Cooley. At that they take off again to check \nthe area for scraps and other parts but they find none. They Soon \ndecide to setup a signal to to Report back to the maximal \nbase. &quot;Maximals this is SureStrike, we are done searching section 43 \ndegrees south by 18 degrees east. We are now moving into the \nBadlands. Please do not worry bout us. I am setting up this relay \nstation so we could still keep in communication.&quot; SureStrike set to \nthe base on a repeat loop. to make sure that any maximal will get it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
