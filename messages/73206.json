Rodimus, Leo, I need you to fight me =\r\nwith everything&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you got, and take heart, if I fall, I understand w=\r\nhy, and anything that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; happens to you, I apologize in advance.   We=\r\n can do this, Maximals, we can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; be far better than Magmatron.  Now,=\r\n time to put our plan into action.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Remember... FULL COOPERATION FR=\r\nOM ALL OF YOU OR ELSE THIS DOES NOT WORK.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson roars, =\r\nas he turns to Leo and the others.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well, it&#39;s not polite=\r\n to keep your opponent waiting!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs TUSCON attempted to transmit h=\r\nis message all he could back was&lt;br&gt;\nstatic and internal feedback. It would=\r\n seem that radios and comlinks&lt;br&gt;\nwere still down here in the tunnels.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever LEO PRIME tunred to look at TUSCON, he nodded ever so slightl=\r\ny&lt;br&gt;\nto try ant let TUSCON know that he understood what was going on.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nEvidently STRAIGHTSHOT&#39;s words were enough to give him a few clues as&lt;br&gt;\nt=\r\no what to do.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Tuscon, you are under arrest. If you are not willin=\r\ng to come quietly,&lt;br&gt;\nthen you will have to come the hard way!&quot; LEO frowne=\r\nd in looked only&lt;br&gt;\nsemi-believably. He was obviously not the best of acto=\r\nrs.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever none of that mattered as the whole rooom continued to =\r\nshake as&lt;br&gt;\nfire and energy spewed itself up out of the pit, destrying the=\r\n remains&lt;br&gt;\nof the bridge that was over it as well destroying all of the e=\r\nquipment&lt;br&gt;\nthat SABERBACK and MAGMATROn had placed around it. Even the st=\r\none that&lt;br&gt;\nhad fell over SABERBACK himself was blown away.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAll a=\r\nround the room vibrated dangerously as the fire and energy&lt;br&gt;\nscorched the=\r\n roof of the cave.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMAGMATRON looked at the fire and energy and the=\r\nn back at TUSCON and&lt;br&gt;\nthen his remaing soldiers, &quot;Retreat!&quot; he called ou=\r\nt. &quot;We have lost&lt;br&gt;\nwhat we came for, retreat.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMAGMATRON began t=\r\no back out twards the caves that were coming out of&lt;br&gt;\nthe middle of cente=\r\nr of the room, protected from the fire and energy&lt;br&gt;\nonly because they fac=\r\ned outward instead of inward.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSKYBYTE wasted no time in bolting, f=\r\nollowed by the remining SHARKTICONS.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEven the PREDACONS were looki=\r\nng at the tunnel. &quot;Skyshadow!&quot; CRYOTEK&lt;br&gt;\nsaid, &quot;Leave the Maximals to fen=\r\nd for them selves, we have everything&lt;br&gt;\nwe need.&quot; He glanced around the r=\r\noom. &quot;Pick up our wounded and&lt;br&gt;\nretreat!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe room was beginning=\r\n to heat up!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n=\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b=\r\nody&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-0BCA6619-4304-4885-9CBC-73AD3E897BBF--\r\n\n"}}
