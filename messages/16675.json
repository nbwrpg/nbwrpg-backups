Probably thinking just how \nmuch of a hot headed prick he was (excuse the swear, please.)\nBut at the moment, he was actually trying to keep himself calm and his \nadrenaline down to a minimum of growls.\nAny increase in spark rate would result in more fluid loose then he already \nhad, and the last thing he needed to do was become stressed and loses \nwhatever little mech-fluid was keeping his pump active.\nBut then he heard Tavatron as him if she could ask him something, even \nthough he thought that it was rather a stupid question he answered. *\n\n� What?!�\n\n* His voice was rather flat but it had a slight annoyed tone to it, his tail \nslightly swinging a little more then usual.\nBut then his optics snapped open when he heard her question, his mind sudden \nreeling for an answer to it.\nIt was rather a shock to be asked such a thing, wondering just what it was \nshe expected to hear from his lips.\nDinobot lifted his head from his forelimbs and looked at Tavatron plainly, \nstill wondering just what he could say to answer her question.\nHe really had to think about what she said, wondering if he really KNEW the \nanswer to it.\nHe laid his head back down on his arms, still looking at her back.\nStill trying to think of a reasonable answer to speak.\nHe had to admit, above the clouds and the moon in plain view, she looked \nrather good�for a femm.\nThough the thought that he actually cared for her was more apparent in his \nmind, he wasn�t quite sure that he should say so as his answer.\nIt was rather a touchy subject, but to say anything else would be a sure \nfire lie.*\n\n� It makes a difference to me. Does that not count for something?�\n\n* His voice was rather quiet and it�s usual harsh self, but all anger had \nreceded from his voice now.\nAnd for once in his life, it actually sounded as if there was a slight bit \nof emotion within the depths of his voice, if once was skilled enough to \nstop and hear it.\nStrangely enough, Dinobot didn�t feel uncomfortable, even though Tavatron \nhad put him in the spotlight with her question.\nBut, he knew how she felt, only that he had never had a bot whom ever cared \nabout him and if he ever came back alive.\nExcept for the Maximals of old, he had been alone. However, he had not died \nalone.\nDinobot�s tail twitched thoughtfully as he continued to look at Tavatron�s \nback.*\n\n� And you make more of a difference then you know.�\n\n* And she did.\nShe was a soldier of the Maximal force and as one she made an extreme \ndifference on the battlefield, as well as on the lives she touched.\nSuch as his.\nHe had never really known real friendship until he had met her, a woman whom \nchallenge his very abilities and made him strove to become better then he \nalready was.\nTavatron made more of a difference then she could possibly know, on his life \nalone.\nShe made him stop and think things over, while in past days he would simply \ncharge into things blindly. She also made him worry, which he had never done \nbefore, and thus think about the outcomes of things before they even \nhappened.\nTavatron, even though he wasn�t about to admit it, had cracked his solid \nwalls of stone and ice and had actually found what little remained of his \nspark�and made him care.\nShe was and had to be a very remarkable woman in order to do that, where all \nelse had failed.\nDinobot cleared his throat and shifted his eyes up, into the skys.\nBut even as he did so he was rather surprised at what he saw, millions upon \nmillions of stars. And he was surprised that he could see every one as well.\nBack on the ground it was impossible to see this, above the clouds it was \nbreathtaking.\nHe was actually amazed!\nDinobot lifted his head from his hands and craned his neck, tilting his head \nall the way back until he was looking straight up. Occasionally shifting it \nfrom side to side only to discover the patterns among the stars in which the \nlater humans called the Zodiac.\nBut he remembered, remembered just what it was like to be in those stars, to \nbe ONE of those stars.\nBack when he was searching for the Matrix he had to travel through them, \namong them. But he had never reached his destination, for a reason he didn�t \nyet know.\nThe only thing he figured was that he wasn�t ready to die, to give up the \nbattles and wars so easily.\nPerhaps resurrected to finally finished what he helped to create, the Beast \nWars.\nBut as he gazed at the stars overhead, he also wondered just what would \nbecome of him once the Beast Wars were over. Once there were no battles to \nbe fought.\nWell, it was still a long way to go yet.\nBut he�d find out someday.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
