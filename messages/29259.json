The tree \npasses below\n&gt; his legs and crashes into the base wall above the door.  He lands \nagain and\n&gt; returns to his winged centaur mode.  He once again loads an arrow \nbut this\n&gt; time fires it at Burning Hammer.  He can&#39;t hurt Recon because he \nisn&#39;t the\n&gt; enemy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
