You did a much better job with Mustex than I did\n&gt; &gt; with Megaton but I&#39;ll take it from here so far as Mustex is\n&gt; &gt; concerned. Just one small change. He can&#39;t fly so he would have\n&gt; &gt; gotten his hover-cycle and followed on it. After all he&#39;s a Mustang\n&gt; &gt; not a bird.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Upon arriving Mustex wasted no time finding Veratis.\n&gt; &gt; Mustex:O.K. I&#39;m just going to lay my cards on the table. Some how my\n&gt; &gt; son...Yes you heard me right I refer to him as that... started as a\n&gt; &gt; baby and is developing the same way humans do. I recently aquired\n&gt; &gt; this.\n&gt; &gt;  He holds up the book.\n&gt; &gt; Mustex:It tell how to polarize energy. As you know there would be 3\n&gt; &gt; advantages to that:\n&gt; &gt; 1.Polarizing enrgy is the process of making sparks instead of waiting\n&gt; &gt; for...(I don&#39;t know what they do on Cybertron but I doubt they come\n&gt; &gt; off an assembly line)\n&gt; &gt; 2.Appling this to D.N.A. could eventually let you make your own beast\n&gt; &gt; modes as you go along istead of throwing diffent kinds of D.N.A.\n&gt; &gt; together or getting it straight from the source.\n&gt; &gt; 3.This could in a few years lead to an invincible bot(and we&#39;ll need\n&gt; &gt; that long to figue out a catch so he won&#39;t be that effective a\n&gt; &gt; fighter.\n&gt; &gt;  All you have to do is figure out what it was. The effects over time\n&gt; &gt; have actually been quite positive. I&#39;m sure you could use this kind\n&gt; &gt; of knowledge. Besides eventually you&#39;re going to run out of\n&gt; &gt; protoforms, and I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re almost out of anything but nulls\n&gt; &gt; already.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ice and Mustex reach the rendevous point where the others are\n&gt; &gt; waiting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine caught Mustex&#39;s scent on the ocean breeze as Ice\n&gt; &gt; aproaches. Ice landed and Lunarpine took a defensive stance. &quot;You\n&gt; &gt; were followed.&quot; He states as Mustex aproaches.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry love, he&#39;s not with the alliance. He says he&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt; friend.&quot; Ice answers putting a wing in front of her wolf boyfriend\n&gt; &gt; before he can react.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex lands stepping back cautiously. &quot;I thought we were going\n&gt; &gt; back to your base.&quot; he questions wondering why they stopped.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We will,&quot; Ice answers &quot;But I had to meet my friends first to tell\n&gt; &gt; them whats going on.&quot; She could tell that he was confused but she\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t risk radio contact so close to the alliance base to tell the\n&gt; &gt; other mutants she had company.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We found signs of Silver Scout&quot; Razor Claw interjected setting the\n&gt; &gt; conversation back on the reason they were there. &quot;She went off in\n&gt; &gt; that direction.&quot; The raptor pointed one of his stumpy arms somewhat\n&gt; &gt; north.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It would seem that she found one of my old aquaintances&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers interupted the chat, his defenses would keep them hidden\n&gt; &gt; but he didn&#39;t want to take the chance of any dumb luck happening\n&gt; &gt; again. Ice was hidden but Mustex somehow stumbled onto her. He didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; want to chance that anyone else would have that kind of luck.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;So what now boss?&quot; Razor Claw asked looking at Ice with eyes of a\n&gt; &gt; lost puppy. Veratis had put her in charge and as long as his\n&gt; &gt; commander was present he didn&#39;t think for himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ice hadn&#39;t thought that far ahead, her team wouldn&#39;t trust Mustex\n&gt; &gt; since they didn&#39;t know him, and she couldn&#39;t jeapordize the mission\n&gt; &gt; by taking him along. &quot;I&#39;ll take him back to base, you three follow\n&gt; &gt; our leads.&quot; She turned and got ready to fly away when she caught\n&gt; &gt; Razor Claws next thought. &quot;Lunarpines in charge, I&#39;ll meet you when\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m done.&quot; The large white arctic owl spread her wings and flew\n&gt; &gt; skyward mentally calling back to Mustex &quot;Follow me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex flew skyward behind the owl trying to see behind him that\n&gt; &gt; the other mutants weren&#39;t following them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
