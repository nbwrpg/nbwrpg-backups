Sorry that I held things up.\n\nI&#39;ve deleted the offending poll, but it brings us to another event: second aniversary of the RPG! Its not for another month, but I wanna get everyone thinking of the awards. For an example, view the members page. Don&#39;t send the council submitions yet, the next council will handle all that, but start thinking about it :-)\n\nWhich brings me to yet another point: Its a month late, but the election poll will be ended tonight. The current council term has been going on for 3 months, so I think we should just change the length to 3 months now. Would you guys think that&#39;s a good idea?\n\nFinally, to Megan:\n\nHappy birthday to you,\nBeast Wars is a zoo,\nPrimal looks like a monkey,\nAnd he smells like one too!\n\nOk, on with the post:\n\n::Killfest/Scyther/EndBringer/Incarcinator/Demise::\n\nKillfest looks around at the Predacon commanders in the room. &quot;So do we have a plan? Just by the position of that base, I can see a very major weakness.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther reaches the scanner rooms, sitting down and watching the scanners.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe CR chamber opens, and EndBringer steps out, hitting his head on the top and then tripping over the bottom, falling on his face. Demise then walks out of his own CR, looking at EndBringer and sighing, stepping on him as he walks out of the CR room.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIncarcinator reaches the mess hall, looking around for any bots to talk to.\n\n\n"}}
