His hands \nclasping his laser welders relax as he crosses his arms.\n\nShaking his head he continues both his face and words appear as an \ninfallible mask of sincerity, &quot;You really think I intend to over \nthrow our mighty leader? Well, I&#39;ve got news for you, I do NOT plan \nto overthrow Megatron, so drop your petty thoughts and go bother \nsomeone else who is more willing waste the energon to hit you.&quot; But \nin his mind, he adds on &lt;what I plan to do, you don&#39;t need to know \nabout...&gt;.\n\nThe right side of Switchblade&#39;s mouth twitches upward, almost into a \nsmirk, as he uncrosses his arms, and back up into a recently \nfinished scrap parts chair. He waits patiently for Perceptor to get \nfrustrated and leave him alone.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nMegatron frowns as the computer screen comes to life with some \nuntimely demise of his troups, except for Rage. Acting quickly(lol), \nhe issues commands over the base commlink, &quot;Nemesis Enforcer. \nSwitchblade. Both of you meet me in the command room immeadiately. \nOne of the scout parties has been disabled or something, we need to \nget there quickly and get them back to base. We cannot afford to \nlose any troops to the Maximals yet...&quot; He stands up and an \nirritated evil look crosses his face as he waits for the two bots to \nshow up.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nSwitchblade stops his patient waiting, and stands, &quot;Sound like it&#39;s \nimportant... outta my way ya slag heap, I&#39;ve got work to do.&quot; The \nblack and green bot brushes past Perceptor, as he heads to the \ncommand room.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So&quot;replied Perceptor &quot;do you think useless bot that you can lie \n&gt; me...
