Anyway, this is the gun.  I call it the\ninflator.  It&#39;s used against anything organic, and can bring a bot to\ninstant death if they are in beast mode, which should make other bots more\ncautious when travelling alone in beast mode.  Anyway, we&#39;ll get to the\nparts in a minute, first, you should know about the energy it takes.  It has\na limited supply of the energy.  First take this kind of liquid,&quot; Wheeljack\ngrabbed some more of it off a shelf, &quot;And then you have to use a special\nelectricity source.  I&#39;ll give you this device, it&#39;ll cover the electricity\nsources,&quot; He handed Reptilica the device, &quot;Then, you just take the liquid,\npour it into the gun, and use the device,&quot; He said, and handed the liquid\njar to Bloodystrike,&quot;But first, you have to make the gun, obviously.\nAnyway, to make the gun......(blablablablabla),&quot; Wheeljack explained\neverything to them.  After that, he went back to his little desk.  He put\nhis feet up on it, sat back and relaxed.\n\n\n"}}
