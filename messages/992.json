She didn&#39;t want to die, not now, not like this. Tavatron shuddered \nin pain, then gasped when she saw the green coil.\nAs it wrapped about her chest she felt an eerie calm, as if she was \nbeginning to fall asleep, but in actuallity her spark was slowly fading.\n\n*Dinobot&#39;s inter comp: &quot; Repair mode has now been altered to repair second \nsubject, damage of second subject has been detected. Repair... activated.&quot;*\n\nTavatron gazed into Dinobot&#39;s optics as her world slowly began to fade to \nblack, suddenly her muscles tightened as Dinobot&#39;s repair system was \nactivated.\n\nTavatron let loose an ear-splitting scream as Dinobot&#39;s coil worked it&#39;s way \nthrough her circutry. She tightly shut her optics against the pain. When she \nopened them again she was breathing heavily, but alive. A throbbing pain \nstill lingered, but it would pass in due time.\n\nTavatron stared into Dinobot&#39;s optics, something was different. She felt... \ndifferent. New thoughts and memories now lingered in her mind, but they were \nnot her own. No matter, she would worry about that later. She healed, and \nthere was a battle to be fought.\n\nTavatron slowly stood, leaning against Dinobot for support until she got her \nbalance. She turned and stared into his optics:\n\n&quot;Thank You.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
