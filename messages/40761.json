Like the rules\n&gt; say, unless you get Zardus&#39; permission for that silly story, the Alliance\n&gt; never did anything to Mustex, Stallex, Rhesus or the Carnitrons.  Oh, and\nif\n&gt; you really want to write stuff that&#39;s actually worth reading(And no, I\n&gt; didn&#39;t enjoy your silly little story) then you can always look for some\n&gt; advice from Jeff, sometimes me, KSL and a few others most likely.  You&#39;ll\n&gt; need to gain a more complex vocabulary and more understanding of things.\n&gt; Ok, everything I just said probably sounds really weird right now, but\njume\n&gt; it.  Speak up if you really wanna **** with the Abyssian Badass!  And,\n&gt; everybody, since there&#39;s a lot of OOCing going on, I suggest you be like\nme\n&gt; and learn to balance OOCing and ICing by putting them both into one post.\n&gt; *Speeds off on his Harley* =)\n&gt;\n&gt; BIC:   Decadel continued to roam the halls and corridors of Maximal City.\n&gt;\n&gt;           &quot;Errr...must find.....somebody to enslave....soon!&quot; Decadel said\n&gt; to himself.\n&gt;\n&gt;           Decadel walked on, pondering who he should enslave.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
