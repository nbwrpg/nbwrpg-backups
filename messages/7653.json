Phobias Spider Spy. He \nlooked in to it&#39;s Optics. He had changed it to trasmit false information to \nwhoever was listening. It would also track it, but only if the person was in \na certain area. It was also programmed to spread the virus with any of the \nother ones, so hopefully soon all the bugs in his base would be infected.\n\n"}}
