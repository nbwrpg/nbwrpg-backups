She wanted \nto know what was going on and she wanted to know NOW!!\n\nWith an echoing slam she plowed into the door, literally ripping it off it&#39;s \nhinges and throwing it off several feet beyond the base.\nAnd without even pausing pace she continued out into the tall yellow grasses \nif the plains around the base, though her bulk kept her from disappearing \ninto it&#39;s depths.*\n\n________________________IRIS\n\n( Thanx, Yanshosh.I had forgotten.)\n\n* Her systems were depleted, she had to say that much, but everything \nworked. However...when she had thought that it was just dark in the ruins of \nthe Ark she hadn&#39;t known that all of the systems were completely \ndestroyed...and there was nothing left to be able to actually call it a ship \nanymore.\n\nBut she still knew that Iron Raptor was on her way there raight at that \nmoment...with Prowl in hot persuit no doubt.\nBut there would still be the questions to answer...and the downloading.\nThat was right, she would have to be downloaded back into Iron Raptors \nsystems. Not only because that there was no Ark to exist in anymore, but \nalso that this new beast mode was SUPPOSED to be. It wasn&#39;t a mutation, it \nwas already in her systems. And she would have to teach that fem how to \naccess it properly.\nThere would be so much to learn in so little time,and there wasa lot of work \nto be done.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
