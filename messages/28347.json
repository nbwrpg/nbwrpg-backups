He hits the shield of the Cybertronian \nFire, a sickening frying sound audible as the shield begins to fry \nhis superstructure.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster looks up, seeing gunfire and seeing Firearm slamming into the \nshields. He taps a few keys, getting the shields ready to flicker off \nfor a second to let Firearm fall through. But he&#39;d need to get \nAstroblast&#39;s attention away from there first.\n\nHe aims his missile launcher, firing two missiles at Astroblast.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Astroblast::\n&gt; Astroblast finally reaches the CF. He sees an injured Firearm and \n&gt; a squashed Beastbox (ouch). He yells to Menasor who looks like \n&gt; he is starting to have trouble, &quot;MENASOR, disband!&quot; Then he fires \n&gt; his twin laser cannons four times at Firearm, then transforms into \n&gt; train mode trying to ram Firearm before he gains too much velocity.\n\n\n"}}
