I&#39;d =\r\nbe busy telling everyone that the nWo robbed me and attempted to downgrade =\r\nme and they must be destroyed, but you&#39;re more concerned about someone thin=\r\nking that you&#39;re gay. When we say faggot, we&#39;re not talking about the &quot;gay&quot;=\r\n faggot, but rather the &quot;I hate you&quot; kind of faggot. As for girls, I&#39;ve alw=\r\nays respected girls. I&#39;ve always treated them like humans and actually thin=\r\nk that boys are the gross ones. Hey, if I could have made a choice of what =\r\nto start as, I&#39;d have picked a girl, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gay. In fact=\r\n, playing with My Little Ponies doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re gay. I dream about one =\r\nday finding a perfect woman to love every day.

That would suck if =\r\nwe were, because we are better than the council.  And in a manner of speaki=\r\nng, we sort of are on the council, it&#39;s just that rAuq is too woman to admi=\r\nt he&#39;s part of the nWo.  And, about girls, I never thought girls were &quot;icky=\r\n&quot;.  But I never had fantasies either.  Girls are girls, women are women, th=\r\ney don&#39;t mean a thing to me.  I don&#39;t want to share my life with ANYBODY, a=\r\nnd I certainly don&#39;t want to share my future fame and fortune with anybody =\r\nbut my co-workers who will also be getting fame and fortune.
