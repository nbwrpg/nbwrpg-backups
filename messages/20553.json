It \n&gt; was an excellent location for a base, an island several miles away \n&gt; from the mainland. He smiles, thinking about the military advantage.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was excellent. The Iron Fist&#39;s shields covered the whole island, \n&gt; which was a few hundred feet across. The shields would need to be \n&gt; taken down in order to gain entry, but it would have to be done by \n&gt; air troops, as ground troops would be forced to swim the three \nmiles \n&gt; to the island, making an easy target for the defences. In adition, \nif \n&gt; a bot aproached underwater, the Iron Fist and island defences would \n&gt; release energon nets, or send powerful electric shocks through the \n&gt; waters, frying the approaching bot.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a bot managed to get through the shields somehow, he would be a \n&gt; much easier target to the defences. Multiple missile launchers and \n&gt; laser turrets lined the ship, and the Iron Fist&#39;s main turret (the \n&gt; one Panzertron demonstrated to Megatron) stood out on top.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus&#39; smile broadens, the Alliance commander, remembering that \nthe \n&gt; inside of the ship was filled with halls and rooms containing state \n&gt; of the ark Predacon technology: labs, weapons, everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Shields down,&quot; he says into his wrist comp, the shields of the \nIron \n&gt; Fist lowering. Zardus lands near the open hatch, entering the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind him, the shuttles carrying the Alliance base arrive and \nland, \n&gt; the Alliance base combining again in the middle of the island. \n&gt; Demolition lands and enters behind Zardus, carrying Delta, and \nHavoc \n&gt; behind him, carrying Feline&#39;s body parts.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Follow me,&quot; Zardus says, heading down the corridor to the labs. \nTwo \n&gt; shuttles launched out of the Iron Fist&#39;s docking bay, flying toward \n&gt; the mainland to pick up any Alliance troops going by foot.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer nearly falls as the Alliance base lands, grabbing onto a \n&gt; doorway to keep his balance.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re at our destination!&quot; he says to Vamprah, &quot;Wanna go outside \nsee \n&gt; where we are?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
