They felt an instant urge to fire \nwhen some other bots approached Starscream.  \nFunny............Starscream was somewhat of a friend........Naaa.  \nThis wasn&#39;t the way of the Dark Lavacons.  Astral flew up in the air, \npulled out his dark flame missile launcher and fired a few blasts at \nHell Beast and Waspinator(and anyother preds on their side).\n&gt; \n&gt;         Fenox started firing his dark flamethrowers at Waspinator \nand Hell Beast, laughing madly.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Starlight fired a direct shot from her dark flame crossbow \nat the back of Waspinator&#39;s head.\n&gt; \n&gt;          Griplash grabbed his dark lavablade, jumped up into the \nair, and came slashing it down at Hell Beast&#39;s shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt;          Recklessa watched for a moment and laughed, as she started \nspraying shots from her darkflame gatling gun at Hell Beast and the \nother intruders.\n\n\n"}}
