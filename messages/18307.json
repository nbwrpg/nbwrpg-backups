He yelled out in complete anger,\n&gt; stomping a foot.  &quot;RUINED!  GREAT!  SOMEONE NEEDS TO DIE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot looked over his &quot;Soundwave/Stalker&quot; style armor, full of holes\n&gt; and gashes, mech-fluid sticking to his body.  &quot;Same here.  Luckily my\nhelmet\n&gt; wasn&#39;t damaged!&quot; (I can&#39;t remember the guy&#39;s head that is his helmet!  I\n&gt; don&#39;t believe it)\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Look over here, guys!&quot; Serpentor said, his plasma launcher pointed at a\n&gt; metallic body.  The king cobra watched the other two Alliance members limp\n&gt; over Diskus, each standing a few feet away from him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer looked around, seeing flames in the trees, starting to\ntake\n&gt; out what was left of the forest near the Alliance base.  Nemesis would\nhave\n&gt; to have Pyro burn the rest down so no one could try and sneak up on the\nbase.\n&gt;  The autoguns were off, and Nemesis could smell the mech-fluid.\n&gt;\n&gt; Looking down on the unconscious Diskus, supposedly unconscious that is,\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer laughed, raising his weapon.  &quot;I didn&#39;t get to kill\nanyone.\n&gt; This idiot will have to do.&quot; the Alliance member chuckled madly as he\npulled\n&gt; the trigger to his rapid-firing laser rifle, twenty-five rapid bolts of\nred\n&gt; laser fire heading down at Diskus&#39; torso.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Wait, Nemesis!&quot; Serpentor yelled.  &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we take him prisoner for\n&gt; interrogation?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well, as second in command for the Alliance, I&#39;d say yes.  But as a\n&gt; psychotic Predacon, I&#39;d say waste him!&quot; Nemesis yelled, throwing his head\n&gt; back in evil laughter.\n&gt;\n&gt; Serpentor laughed, firing off a blast from his plasma launcher at Diskus.\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot kept quiet, firing off twenty five shells down at Diskus.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
