As they\n&gt;&gt; near\n&gt;&gt; him, he rears up, extends his enormous wings and beats them with powerful\n&gt;&gt; thrusts, hoping to create enough wind resistance to keep them at bay.\n&gt;&gt; His\n&gt;&gt; tail whips around in powerful coils as he prepares to catch one of them\n&gt;&gt; with\n&gt;&gt; a constrictor grip, in an attempt to slow them down.   He sees something\n&gt;&gt; very familiar about them, yet having had a portion of his memory erased\n&gt;&gt; when\n&gt;&gt; Cyclonus struck him vorns ago, he could not really be sure he was seeing\n&gt;&gt; who\n&gt;&gt; he thought he was seeing.  His expression changes, as anger is replaced\n&gt;&gt; by\n&gt;&gt; confusion and anticipation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Grimlock?  Wait!  Is your name Grimlock?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson shows the leader his Maximal faction symbol, and a small Autobot\n&gt;&gt; symbol located on his left front haunch.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; I am Tucson Prime, formally Tucson!  You might have known me in my\n&gt;&gt; Autobot\n&gt;&gt; alt form!  But I assure you that I&#39;m not lying!   I once worked for\n&gt;&gt; Optimus\n&gt;&gt; Prime!  &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He hoped that Grimlock would sort of remember who he was.  He then takes\n&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; submissive stance, showing that he means no harm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As TUSCON takes a submissive stance GRIMLOCK assumed his robot mode,\n&gt; his rather large and imposing looking rifle with twin cannons on it\n&gt; now pointed directly at TUSCON. There seemed to be little or no other\n&gt; reaction to TUSCON&#39;s words.\n&gt;\n&gt; GRIMLOCK was still massive and imposing as a robot, every bit as tall\n&gt; and thick as he had been pictured in the histories even though he had\n&gt; been part of the great reduction as every other Autobot who had\n&gt; survived since then. However instead of their being an Autobot patch\n&gt; on his chest there was a blank spot where it looked as if something\n&gt; used to be there but had been cut off.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Cuffs!&quot; GRIMLOCK barked.\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a grunt as one of the transmetal dinosaurs, the Triceratops\n&gt; SLAG, transformed into robot mode, &quot;No! Me want to smash!&quot; He\n&gt; displayed his desire physcially as he oriented his electron blaster on\n&gt; TUSCON.\n&gt;\n&gt; The other two transmetal Dinosaurs presumably SNARL and SLUDGE just\n&gt; grumbled, SLUDGE stepping foward, his stomp causing the trees to shake\n&gt; and rattle.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Me said cuffs!&quot; GRIMLOCK said as he turned to look at SLAG.\n&gt;\n&gt; SLAG turned to look at GRIMLOCK as if he were about to say something\n&gt; else and instead met GRIMLOCK&#39;s optics and remorceless stare. After a\n&gt; moment he nodded, &quot;Cuffs.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Turning back to TUSCON the dino pulled out what were obviously stassis\n&gt; cuffs and was about to place them on the submissive TUSCON as the\n&gt; other dinosaurs grinned from beastmode.\n&gt;\n&gt; GRIMLOCK merely looked on sternly, still having his laser rifle\n&gt; pointed at TUSCON.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n"}}
