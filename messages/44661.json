I have been monitoring Abominus&#39; progress \nin the\n&gt; ocean. I need you to head into the water and tell him to stop, or he\n&gt; will overshoot his needed position. Spasstik, get me to the repair\n&gt; chamber. Astrotrain, check on Soundwave.&quot; At that Spasstik quickly\n&gt; padded his way into the base, towards Switchblade&#39;s laboritory, \nwith his\n&gt; weakened leader still in his jaw.\n&gt; \n&gt; He rounded two corners, then into the elevator. It dropped \ndownwards,\n&gt; then opened up as the wolf emerged from the doorway, and headed \ndown a\n&gt; long coridoor with many rooms on the sides, getting much more \ntechnical\n&gt; with more and more equipment in each one, until he reached the end, \nand\n&gt; entered a doorway on his right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spasstik emerged in Switchblade&#39;s room, and the small pistol spoke\n&gt; again. &quot;Fix me.&quot; it weakly hissed, as the wolf stood there snarling \nin\n&gt; the doorway, protective of the gun.\n\n\n"}}
