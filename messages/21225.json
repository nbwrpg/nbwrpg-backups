Three quarters of her spark chamber was useable, I had to \nfix \n&gt; up the rest of it. She lost about a third of her memory. But to be \non \n&gt; the safe side, I uploaded a program that will keep her loyal to \n&gt; Zardus. But I don&#39;t think that she is quiet the same as she was.  \nIf \n&gt; zardus could give me the program he installed in her initially, I \ncan \n&gt; upload it into her programs and return her to about 95% of what she \n&gt; was before she got killed the first time.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
