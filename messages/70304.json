They were corrupted twisted looking things, resembling\nsomething like earth insects, but oddly alien at the same time. They\nwere all a brownish black, although with glints of a strange metallic\nsilver here and there. They were each about as large as full grown\nlion, each creature had ten legs, six insect like &#39;walking&#39; legs, with\nbarbed &#39;knees&#39; that ended with short claws extending from a large and\npowerfully built thorax. And like  a praying mantis they had an\nextended thorax, a chest like construct from which four others legs\nwere attached that looked larger and more powerful. Each of these legs\nwas barbed with hooks along the sides, and with forelegs that ended in\nlong sharp blades! The abdomen of each creature had a long flexible\nstinger, which like a scorpion was poised for striking. They head was\nsmall with two large eyes and several smaller ones. However what may\nbe of more interest is that instead of the chitinous shell of your\ntypical creature, their &#39;shells&#39; were composed of a strange metallic\nsubstance.\n\n&quot;Intruders.&quot; they hissed in unison, a strange buzzing noise\naccompanying their movements as they quickly moved forward. &quot;They must\nbe brought to the mistress!&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: Here is a question before we go too far in:\n\nIn the past there have been instances where folks have been ignoring\nattacks from others. IE: Person A attacks person B, but person B just\nposes talking with someone else and then attacks back without posing\nthe results of the attack from Person A, and they go through the\nbattle with seemingly no hits or battle damage.\n\nSo do you want me to GM the hits/misses/results or do you want to keep\ntrack of that yourselves? I am open either way.\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
