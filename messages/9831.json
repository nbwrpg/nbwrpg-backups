Though one herself, she had yet to find an \ninterest in the battle, until now.  She had been watching the power \nstruggle for some time and had now seen which side was stronger.  She \nhad been made Pred.  \n\nFor years, GoldenEye had stayed in beast mode so as to stay hidden.  \nSince her arrival to the planet, she had yet to transform into bot \nmode.  She had lived among the eagles for a long time.  Watching and \nwaiting for the factions to show her which one was strong.  It was \nclear that the Predacons of the ship were the stronger faction and \nthe one for her to join.  She perched on the top branches of a tree \nand watched.  She would wait until the battle was over and then make \nher move.\n\nName: GoldenEye\nFaction: Predacon\nSkills: Fighter, Killer.\n\nWeapons: Talons, Beak, Optic lazars, energon pistol, double barrel \nenergon shot gun-sawed off.\n\n\n"}}
