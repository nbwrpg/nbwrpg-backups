It was as if the abandoned it in mass.\nEven the building were gone. In fact if they were not specifically\nlooking for the village they would miss it completely.\n\nAs they approached the ARK the forms of RODIMUS, NIGHTLIGHT and LEGACY\nwere stadning at the entrance as the last of the MAXIMALS were filing\ninside.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight was weak. All her experience had taking a toll. She didnt\n&gt; listened what Rodimus said and she added &quot;He deceived me... I tought he was\n&gt; you... He was a clone and he belived that he was you... All this time they\n&gt; mus have making fun of us&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS nodded, &quot;He thought he was me because in a way he was me.&quot;\n\nThere was a frown as RODIMUS contemplated the situation. &quot;He was the\npart of me that was left when I finally shook off the programing that\nHydras and Jhiaxus had programed into me.&quot; RODIMUS put an arm on\nNIGHTLIGHT, &quot;But now he is gone, destroyed, you don&#39;t have to worry\nabout him any more.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
