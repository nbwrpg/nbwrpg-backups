Your\n&gt; are on the verge of \n&gt; moding. You can only state your char attemps to do\n&gt; an action against \n&gt; another one, not Say he succeeds at it without the\n&gt; consent of the \n&gt; other player. I understand that Warhead is in stasis\n&gt; lock, so I&#39;ll let \n&gt; this pass for now.

At the moment, you didn&#39;t post\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dodging Megatron&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attack, Sunhawk grabbed Megatron and put him\n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a headlock, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then turned him around to face Kup&#39;s\n&gt; weaponfire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; THAT is what&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrong.
