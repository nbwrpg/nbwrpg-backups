He sent a \ncomm \n&gt; link.  &quot;This is Grounded. Split the fork and choose a pea.&quot; he said \n&gt; hoping Lokk would understand his code.  He then went beside Lokk in \nhis \n&gt; mole form walking slowly and stealthly behind him.  Using \nvibrations \n&gt; through the ground he determined within a few some odd yards they \nwould \n&gt; be directly behind the enemy.\n&gt; \n&gt; gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Seekker ran up to the pod diving behind it rolling along the \nground\n&gt; &gt; until beside Axis.  He looks both ways then up and down.  Now \nlooking at\n&gt; &gt; Axis stares him in the eyes. The small bot grabs at Axis face \nwith both\n&gt; &gt; hands.  &quot;THIS IS WAR BOY.  THIS ISN&#39;T YOUR PANSY ACCADEMY \nTRAINING, THIS\n&gt; &gt; IS THE REAL THING.  NOW LITSEN TO ME, PRIVATE, I WANT YOU TO GET \nOUT\n&gt; &gt; THERE AND SHOW THOSE ENEMY&#39;S HOW FAR OVER THE LINE THEY ARE.  YOU \nGOT\n&gt; &gt; THAT YOU PIECE OF PRIVATE PISTONS.&quot; he yelled at Axis believeing \nhe\n&gt; &gt; himself was a war general.  He then looked straigh back from the \npod.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Bring it on...&quot; he said.  He then turned jumping up onto the top \nof the\n&gt; &gt; pod, his two miniguns under each arm ringing out 20 shots each.  \nBoth\n&gt; &gt; his hands carried small explosive grenades. Throwing one at \nBarrymore\n&gt; &gt; and the other at McGowan.  The crazy shots from his minigun fly \ntoward\n&gt; &gt; McGowan, Barrymore, Stiller and Alba in very bad accuracy. &quot;HAR \nHAR. YOU\n&gt; &gt; REBELS WILL LEARN A LESSON, SEEKKER STYLE&quot;  Seekker still stood \natop the\n&gt; &gt; pod.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; rauq@t... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; --- Lokk / Axis / Lynxiz ---\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Lynxiz quickly flattens herself to the ground, avoiding most \nof the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; wildly fired shots though in her dodging efforts, several \nbullets dug\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; into her armour, and glanced off of her back. She stays on the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; ground, and notices Nightlight being approached by Depp. A\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; growing sense of doom builds as she gets to her feet and fires \ntwo\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; disks at Depp. Immediately after firing the disks, she puts \nher gun\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; away and starts to sprint towards Depp thinking, &lt;&lt;I can&#39;t let \nthis\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; happen...&gt;&gt; as she prepares for close combat mode. Her claws\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; extend from her hands with a metallic ringing.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Axis, not sure what to do, waits behind the pod, hoping that \nthe\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; heavy heat resistant re-entry armour on the pod will hold out \nfor this\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; battle. Without looking, he yells, &quot;LOKK?&quot; Wanting to make sure\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; that Lokk is ok.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Lokk creaps around, weaving through trees. Exiting the forest, \nhe\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; hids behind a near by rock. Keeping low to the ground, he \ncrawls\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; along still trying to get behind the enemy and he&#39;s almost \nthere.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
