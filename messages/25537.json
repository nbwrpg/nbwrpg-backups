Thinking that maybe they would learn a \nlesson by this, if they lived through it.\nBut Iron Raptor knew something that some of the bots already did or might \nnot know.\nIf they stayed here only a small amout of their forces would be mowed down, \nbut if they fought too then the Alliance would fire back and the war would \nbe on again.\nChordate, she knew, wasn&#39;t going to be saved. But the Maximals being fired \nupon had the chance to be. Plus...the captives in the ship could be used to \nease the force of the battle and maybe think twice.\nBut the captive idea wasn&#39;t going to be used.\nIron Raptor looked at Prowl as ke spoke, then looking at the remainder of \nthe Maximals behind her.\nThere were all edgy and itchy to fight, ready to come to the defence of \ntheir comrads. And even though Angel Prime was the last person she wanted to \nsave right there and then, she couln&#39;t leave the Maximals out there either.\nShe sighed and nodded.*\n\n&quot; We&#39;ll help him.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then looked at the rest of the Maximals, still not sure if \nwhat she was doing was right. She could be sending a lot of Maximals to \ntheir deaths by doing this. But since when did Maximals leave comrads \nwithout a hope?*\n\n&quot; We&#39;re moving out. Charge yourselves and pick someone to join with you on \nthe field. No point in getting picked off once we&#39;re out there. Goota have \nsomeone watching your back.&quot;\n\n* She took the sword and slashed the blade out towards the battle.*\n\n&quot; They&#39;re out there slaughtering our own kind! I don&#39;t know about all of you \nbut I&#39;m not about to let them get away with it!&quot;\n\n* Her expression became hard.*\n\n&quot; Firing in pairs will increase our chance to defeat them. Picking them off \none by one, one pair putting all of their firepower into one bot until it \neither backs off or falls. Then moving onto the next. It might take a while \nbut if we work together it&#39;ll pay off. The gustalt bots are our first \ntargets, especially the ones which make up the legs. Without legs they can&#39;t \nmove.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor looked over the Maximals.*\n\n&quot; Now how many of you want to go out there and show those slags what defeat \nfeels like?!&quot;\n\n* She then turned back towards the battle and took a step towards it.*\n\n&quot; Let&#39;s go!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
