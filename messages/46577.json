The real\n        one. Another person post=\r\ned that characters are not allowed to die\n        currently...he is utterly=\r\n incorrect.\n\n        The problem is the role-playing 101 aspect. People are=\r\n given the\n        responsibility to judge how much damage they take...howe=\r\nver as we&#39;ve seen\n        some can&#39;t role-play their way out of a wet paper=\r\n bag let alone responsibly\n        judge how much damage their character ta=\r\nkes. When a bot does get damaged\n        what typically happens here?\n\n    =\r\n    Here&#39;s the list:\n\n        1) The enemy bot suddenly becomes cockeyed un=\r\nable to hit the broad side of a\n        barn even if he was a g1 and standi=\r\nng over it.\n\n        2) The bot never gives chase to his prey. It always le=\r\nts the long time\n        character slip away.\n\n        3) A short stay (a f=\r\new hours usually) in the CR chamber and any damage is\n        completely go=\r\nne.\n\n        4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back as an =\r\nenemy\n        infiltrator.\n\n        5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone a=\r\nppears which after various meeting\n        with colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; =\r\nturns good again. Personality reverts to\n        pre-evil clone.\n\n        6=\r\n) Character &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful offspring. Personality\n=\r\n        is hardly different.\n\n        7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but the players 6=\r\n other characters cart it&#39;s blasted\n        carcass back to a lab where the=\r\ny resurrect him.\n\n        8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with new bot same per=\r\nsonality...eventually\n        people will forget you died and you can go ba=\r\nck to your old form.\n\n        Since most will never let their &quot;favorite&quot; ch=\r\naracter(s) die, I mean truly\n        die, never come back like, there&#39;s rea=\r\nlly very little new plotlines you can\n        do with them without repeatin=\r\ng rehashed already done ones.

The \n        real&lt;BR&gt;one. Another pe=\r\nrson posted that characters are not allowed to \n        die&lt;BR&gt;currently...=\r\nhe is utterly incorrect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The problem is the \n        role-playing 10=\r\n1 aspect. People are given the&lt;BR&gt;responsibility to judge \n        how much=\r\n damage they take...however as we&#39;ve seen&lt;BR&gt;some can&#39;t \n        role-play =\r\ntheir way out of a wet paper bag let alone \n        responsibly&lt;BR&gt;judge ho=\r\nw much damage their character takes. When a bot \n        does get damaged&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;what typically happens here?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here&#39;s the \n        list:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) T=\r\nhe enemy bot suddenly becomes cockeyed unable to hit \n        the broad sid=\r\ne of a&lt;BR&gt;barn even if he was a g1 and standing over \n        it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2)=\r\n The bot never gives chase to his prey. It always lets the \n        long ti=\r\nme&lt;BR&gt;character slip away.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) A short stay (a few hours \n        usu=\r\nally) in the CR chamber and any damage is&lt;BR&gt;completely \n        gone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back as \n        an e=\r\nnemy&lt;BR&gt;infiltrator.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone \n        =\r\nappears which after various meeting&lt;BR&gt;with colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; \n   =\r\n     turns good again. Personality reverts to&lt;BR&gt;pre-evil clone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6) =\r\n\n        Character &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful offspring. \n    =\r\n    Personality&lt;BR&gt;is hardly different.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but the =\r\n\n        players 6 other characters cart it&#39;s blasted&lt;BR&gt;carcass back to a =\r\nlab \n        where they resurrect him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace w=\r\nith new \n        bot same personality...eventually&lt;BR&gt;people will forget yo=\r\nu died and you \n        can go back to your old form.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since most wil=\r\nl never let their \n        &quot;favorite&quot; character(s) die, I mean truly&lt;BR&gt;die=\r\n, never come back like, \n        there&#39;s really very little new plotlines y=\r\nou can&lt;BR&gt;do with them without \n        repeating rehashed already done one=\r\ns. Take for example&lt;BR&gt;the geotrons \n        planing to attack the new cat =\r\nfaction....both factions will&lt;BR&gt;survive, \n        I doubt either player wh=\r\no controls the majority of bots in \n        either&lt;BR&gt;faction is gonna let =\r\ntheir characters get anywhere near \n        killed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And what&#39;s to st=\r\nop this from happening if a \n        restart/sequel DOES occur? The&lt;BR&gt;role=\r\n-playing by some will still stink, \n        characters will still be incapa=\r\nble of&lt;BR&gt;dying and given another year or \n        so all plotlines for THA=\r\nT game will be&lt;BR&gt;starting to repeat. While I \n        still do believe a r=\r\nestart/sequel is in order I&lt;BR&gt;think the \n        role-playing problem need=\r\ns addressing first to stop a repeat \n        of&lt;BR&gt;what&#39;s happening to NBW.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message \n        -----&lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &=\r\nlt;x_rauq_x@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: \n        &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Sent: Sunday, January 20, 2002 5:57 \n        AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: All Read: Impo=\r\nrtant&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; My appologies, \n        Narrator, I actually missed y=\r\nour original post.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I find \n        that Neo Beast Wars has =\r\nbeen dragged on for too long, and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        world is becoming cl=\r\nogged with bases among other things.

If \n        you&#39;ve created=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one storyline that you like, is it not fair to \n        say that y=\r\nou can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; create another better one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The \n        idea=\r\n of creating a sequel to the rpg is one that I would agree&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n       =\r\n with. That would require several things to happen:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) Changing \n  =\r\n      the name of the RPG.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) Appropriate changes to the \n        w=\r\nebsite.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3) A means to store all of everyone&#39;s previous \n        cha=\r\nracters (don&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; know about everyone else, but I don&#39;t want to \n     =\r\n   lose the bio&#39;s of all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my characters).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4) New story (i \n =\r\n       have an idea, not necessarily for the story, but for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how we =\r\n\n        could create the story).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 5) A catalyst to start us all off=\r\n (the \n        story should provide that).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 6) Implementation of new=\r\n rules, some \n        of which have been, and are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; being, discussed =\r\nin the login \n        messageboard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 7) other stuff that could be wr=\r\nitten if I wasn&#39;t \n        so tired.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; All in all, since ther=\r\ne are more people voting \n        anti-restart that I&#39;d&lt;BR&gt;&gt; anticpated,=\r\n I&#39;ll ask everyone a perhaps \n        fate deciding question:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Would it be favourable to have a \n        sequel instead of a restart?&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In \n        nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt=\r\n;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m \n        agree with Soulstice, =\r\nrestart isn&#39;t good idea.
