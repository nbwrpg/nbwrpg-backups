She closed her eyes \nand wrapped her arms around Striker&#39;s neck.  She felt herself holding \nback the rising fear in her.  She felt him swerve and weave as they \nflew along.  \n\n&quot;Ah...yeah...good idea.  Let&#39;s stop by and see if they need us for \nanything.&quot;  as she swallowed hard.  \n\nShe kept her eyes tightly shut, so as not to see how far off the \nground they were.  She hated fear of hers.  It made her feel weak and \nhelpless against it.  She tightened her arms around Striker a little \nmore and burried her face into his shoulder. She tried with all her \nspark to keep her fear down and out of her mind.  \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Striker::\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker smiles, sweeping Spears off her feet and flying off toward \nthe Ark, \n&gt; slowly at first and at a low altitude.
