Watching the unconscious bot for a few moments before looking at his own hands, mech fluid dripping from the tips of his claws and onto the floor with a sickening sound. One might look upon the scene as horrid and cruel, but if that One knew what could have happened if he had not disposed of Dark One then they would see the action as just.\nBut it him it was a relief, releasing the tension he was feeling due to the lack of exposure to battle over the past few mega-cycles. It was a crime to keep a warrior from his natural environment, the battlefield.\nHowever, considering the circumstances at hand, keeping from battle was of no concern of his. Tavatron�s safety was what concerned him now, pure and simple.\nHowever, still satisfied that he had gotten a little slaging in after all. The beginnings of a smile developing upon his lips as he looked at Dark One, but then it vanishing completely as he bent a retrieved the silencer and then turning his attention to something that needed it now. Placing the silencer in a compartment in his back, he looked towards the table in which Tavatron had lay upon only moments before.\nDinobot looked on as Tavatron had rolled from the table, coming to her feet and presenting her sword in an unsure manner. He had had an idea that she would act as she did, not sure of what was going on. Alliance bots slaged and silenced with no trace of an attacker, it was a notion that would cause alarm to anybot. Tavatron�s reaction was simply understandable.\nHe then simply stood there and watched her, noting how she seemed unsure of how to act yet actually nodding in acceptance at the fact that she was always ready for battle. A very good factor when one was in such a situation.\nWith a quick glance towards each corner of the room he took in that there were no surveillance cameras in the room, a fairly good factor if one of their cloaking devices was to malfunction within the next few moments. However, he knew well that the remainder of this ship was monitored, an important concept to remember if they wanted to get out of here alive.\nWithout a second thought he reached behind himself and came up with the cloaking device in which Prowl had given him for Tavatron, looking over it carefully to ensure it was up to the functioning capability.\nThen sure that it was functioning Dinobot looked back up at Tavatron, deciding then that it was about time that she knew that he was there. \nLeaning against the wall behind him he quickly looked down at Dark One, laying upon the floor at his feet with a growing puddle of mech fluid forming about him, his claws still wet with the Alliance bot�s vital fluid.\nCrossing his arms across his chest-plate Dinobot deactivated the cloaking device with a silent command. \nWith no cameras or sensors he would not be detected, however, still leaving the portion of the device that cloaked one�s signature active. There was no need to take further risks that did not need to be taken.\nNow with no device keeping Tavatron from seeing him, he simply came into view with his arms crossed, leaning against the wall with Dark One�s bloody body at his feet. Looking a bit more casual then he meant to, almost like he had been there all the time.\nWith a plain voice he simply answered Tavatron�s question, slowly lifting his optics from Dark One�s body to look at her. *\n\n� Who else?�\n\n* In his optics was a plainly written question, � Who�d you expect?� his tail slowly swinging casually beside him. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
