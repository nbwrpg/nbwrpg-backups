Did you call us ladies?&quot;\n\nDarkmouse and GoldenEye looked at each other with a half twisted \nsmile. \n\nDarkMouse::\nShe looked at the two bot. &quot;Honey flows quickly from the lips of a \nmale when he wants something. But the honey is never long lived. So \nwhat do you want?&quot;\n\n\nGoldenEye::\nshe saw the look that Koj gave her. She smiled at him, showing no \nfear towards him. She looked him up and down,&quot;Hmmm, no weapons, what \nkind of bot walks around without weapoons?&quot; She shook her head, \nshowing her disbelief.\n\n\n::KitKat::\nStill tied up in her meeting, she noticed that DarkMouse and \nGoldenEye were outside with two bots.  It showed then talking on her \nlittle wrist monitor. She sighed and opened her link to DM.\n&quot;Show them to the mess hall, I&#39;ll be ther when I can.&quot;\n\nDarkMouse::\nShe got the message and looked at the bots.&quot;Well, she called. I&#39;ll \ntake you to the mess hall and you can wait for here there.&quot;\nShe motioned with her hand, the one with the gun, for them to follow \nher. She muttered, &quot;males, can&#39;t shoot them all and can&#39;t recycle \nthem.&quot;\n\nGoldenEye::\nShe kept a close eye on Koj.  She walked in back and took the rear \nposition in the escort. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t try anything.  The autoguns will \nfire. And you are being heavily monitored.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;RYO D&quot; &lt;striderzero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ((Damn I sent this at Lunch and it still hasn&#39;t come yet here it is \nagain.))\n&gt; ::Koj::\n&gt; Koj stands there getting a little annoyed by the weaklings sent to \ngreet him \n&gt; since he is a pred. Like always eyes ports are pitch black he \nallows one of \n&gt; them to glow green and gives GoldenEye a leer. The leer is almost \ndemonic \n&gt; and is more intimidating than any spread wings.&quot;I have no weapons \non me and \n&gt; I&#39;m Koj of Silver Dragon.I would like Lady KitKat to talk outside?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Inu::\n&gt; &quot;Forgive my friend He means would Lady KitKat like to talk outside \nbut we \n&gt; can always go in.
