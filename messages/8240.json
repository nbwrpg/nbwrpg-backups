She layed\n&gt; down on the ground a little out of breath. She said in a low and\n&gt; dissapointed voice, &quot;I couldn&#39;t find him. I&#39;m sorry, I couldn&#39;t find\n&gt; him.&quot; She closed her eyes and put her ears back against her head.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Rowdy Wolf/Terrorsaur:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I must have been told wrong,&quot; Rowdy Wolf said to Stingtra. &quot;My\n&gt; apologies.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He looked around. &quot;So, what do we do?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;re here!&quot; a gruff voice called out.
