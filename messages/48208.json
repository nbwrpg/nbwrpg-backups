I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; sure, but I suspect the other&#39;s were as well.  I\n&gt; request permission\n&gt; &gt; to lock up the prisoner and take some troops to\n&gt; get the other&#39;s that\n&gt; &gt; were there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; {Talos}\n&gt; \n&gt;     Talos nodded looking down at Sunhawks captive,\n&gt; apparently caught in the\n&gt; throes of stasis lock more so than battle damage.\n&gt; &quot;Take her to the brig then\n&gt; round up Grimlock, Kup and Condor to help you.&quot;\n&gt; Turning from the bot he\n&gt; opened a comm channel, &quot;Kenzo, report to the brig,\n&gt; Sunhawk is delivering a\n&gt; prisoner down there and I&#39;d like you to make sure\n&gt; she&#39;s all right, I want\n&gt; her functional for when I question her.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
