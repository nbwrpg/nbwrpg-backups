The room is a large do=\r\nme, with many chairs and\n  &gt; &gt; tables\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where a hundred Autobots si=\r\nt. Most of the Autobots were given\n  &gt; this\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high privelage for th=\r\ne name they made during one of the great\n  &gt; &gt; wars.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Painted all =\r\nover are the symbols of Maximal, Predacon, and\n  &gt; &gt; Autobot.

One\n  &gt; &gt; though,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is very famous, Alpha Trio=\r\nn. In the centre of all the\n  &gt; &gt; podiums is\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an energon fountain.=\r\n It harmoneusly gushes a soft pink energy,\n  &gt; &gt; that\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gives the r=\r\noom a light pink colour.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a large hush over the=\r\n crowd, as a red old Autobot, at\n  &gt; &gt; the top\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and centre of the =\r\nroom stands up. He then begins to speak, and\n  &gt; the\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other Autobo=\r\nts follow his every word. &quot;Greetings Pacifix&quot; he\n  &gt; says\n  &gt; &gt; in a\n  &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; rough deep voice. The Autobot Ironhide&#39;s voice can be heard by\n  &gt; &gt; al=\r\nl. He\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speaks with wisdom, and kind words. To his right and left,\n=\r\n  &gt; &gt; standing\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behind him are Sunstreaker and Sideswipe, his body=\r\n guards. To\n  &gt; his\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right sitting down is his peer, the old Autob=\r\not known as Kup,\n  &gt; who\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; watches all of this with an unussually s=\r\nense of calmness.\n  &gt; Beside\n  &gt; &gt; him\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the once human, now rob=\r\not Spike. A few more recognizable\n  &gt; &gt; Autobots\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sit around. &quot;As =\r\nyou know&quot; Ironhide continues, &quot;We have finally\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; achieved what we s=\r\net out to millions of years ago. Peace&quot; he\n  &gt; says,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every robot =\r\nin the room nodding at the last word. &quot;But it is an\n  &gt; &gt; uneasy\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\npeace, for even though we have all but stopped the Decepticons,\n  &gt; we\n  &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have reasons to believe their decendants, the Predacons, do not\n  &gt; &gt;=\r\n follow\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this peace willfully&quot; he says in a grave tone. &quot;We even h=\r\nave\n  &gt; &gt; strong\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence that points to the fact that they have =\r\nreleased\n  &gt; &gt; Decepticon\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; war Criminals from confinment, to try t=\r\no change time on the\n  &gt; planet\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Earth&quot; he says, thinking back to =\r\nthat time, four million years\n  &gt; &gt; ago,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when the Ark, and Nemesi=\r\ns crash landed on the planet, bringing\n  &gt; to\n  &gt; &gt; it\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their mill=\r\nion year Strugle. He remembers the battles they had\n  &gt; &gt; there,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nand how it helped turn the tide of War for the Autobots. &quot;We\n  &gt; sent\n  &gt; &gt;=\r\n a\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scouting ship to earth already, with two Autobot Veterans.

All along \n  the walls there are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n pictures&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of legends \n  who have ceased to exist, an=\r\nd died for the cause.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Brawn&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; face i=\r\ns at one end, Ratchet and Prowl at another, Ironhide \n  at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corner, surrounded by many Autobots that \n  preexist the=\r\nm. One&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; though,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is very \n  famous, =\r\nAlpha Trion. In the centre of all the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; podiums is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; an energon fountain. It harmoneusly gushes a soft pink \n  ener=\r\ngy,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gives the room a light pink \n =\r\n colour.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a large hus=\r\nh \n  over the crowd, as a red old Autobot, at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the top&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; and centre of the room stands up. He then begins to speak=\r\n, \n  and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other Autobots follow his every=\r\n word. \n  &quot;Greetings Pacifix&quot; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; says&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; \n  rough deep voice. The Autobot Ironhide&#39;s voice can be heard =\r\nby&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  all. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speaks with wisdom, and k=\r\nind words. To his \n  right and left,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; standing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; behind him are \n  Sunstreaker and Sideswipe, his body guards. To&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; right sitting down is his peer, the old =\r\nAutobot known as Kup,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  who&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; watches all of =\r\nthis with an unussually sense of \n  calmness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Beside&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; h=\r\nim&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the once \n  human, now robot Spike. A few more=\r\n recognizable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Autobots&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; sit around. &quot;=\r\nAs you know&quot; Ironhide continues, &quot;We have \n  finally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n achieved what we set out to millions of years \n  ago. Peace&quot; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sa=\r\nys,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every robot in the room \n  nodding at the last w=\r\nord. &quot;But it is an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; uneasy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; peace, for=\r\n even though we have all but stopped the Decepticons,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  we&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; have reasons to believe their decendants, the \n  Predacons,=\r\n do not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; follow&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this peace \n  willfully&quot;=\r\n he says in a grave tone. &quot;We even have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; strong&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; evidence that points to the fact that they have \n  released&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Decepticon&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; war Criminals from \n  confinment=\r\n, to try to change time on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; planet&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n  Ear=\r\nth&quot; he says, thinking back to that time, four million years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n =\r\n ago,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when the Ark, and Nemesis crash landed on the =\r\n\n  planet, bringing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their=\r\n \n  million year Strugle. He remembers the battles they had&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n =\r\n there,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and how it helped turn the tide of War for t=\r\nhe \n  Autobots. &quot;We&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sent&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scou=\r\nting ship \n  to earth already, with two Autobot Veterans. They&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; not made contact with us however, and their=\r\n ship is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  emmiting a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; signal. We fear t=\r\nhe Predacons may be on to \n  us. That is why we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; summoned you Pacifix. \n  The Predacons will not notice if a rookie=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commander \n  goes missing, but we have reason to be=\r\nlieve you are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; perfect leader for this=\r\n mission. We also know that one of \n  your&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; friends&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; was in that scout ship, and \n  understand you will most likely&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; want&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; retrieve him. We hav=\r\ne faith in your Pacifist reasoning, and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  think&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; you&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would best represent us. We have \n  already selected =\r\na few Autobot&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; veterans to go with you, \n  and we und=\r\nerstand you are also putting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; crew&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; of you own together&quot; Ironhide says, pausing for Pacifix \n  to&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; respond.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
