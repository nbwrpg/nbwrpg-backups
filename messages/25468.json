Didn&#39;t get home until 10 Pm or so, \nthen I just went to bed.  So I&#39;ll be taking back my characters from Yan after \nI speak with him.\n\nFirefox, I was wondering if you were posting damage as if Unitron and \nFirestarter and Vehement were attacking from the outside of the bridge.  \nBecause they were inside. \n\nAlso, Icedemon, I have no problem with a small personal shield, but if you \nhave a TON of shots heading for you, please post damage for them colliding \nwith your shield.  Also, post damage for your characters.  I know all of them \nwere shot at.\n\nFinally, my personal belief is that that vortex is moding and if it was legal \nevery base would have one and shields would be invincible unless taken down \nfrom the inside of a base, which would be extremely hard and unfair for all)\n\nThanks,\nLord Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n"}}
