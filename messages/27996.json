He raised his wrist cannon, firing off ten rapid \nlaser bolts at FZ.\n\n---\n\nUnicron fired two optic blasts with a chuckle on an intercept path with the \nmissiles, continuing pursuit with a speed just a little slower than FZ.  He \nraised an arm, launching two ES seeking missiles off at FZ.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf stopped, transforming to biped mode and breathing in the smell of \ndestruction.  &quot;Continue what we were doing beforehand at the last battle my \nbrethren.  Obliterate anyone who stands in our way.&quot; the Vok creation said as \nhe raised a sword, the blade of the sword launching out as missile off at the \nCF.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper transformed to biped mode, two orbs with grenade like effects \nbeing thrown at the CF&#39;s shields.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw armed the missile launcher erected into his &#39;vehicle&#39; mode.  When \nhe got a target lock he launched two missiles off at the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n---\n\nGroove came out of the CF followed by Streetwise, firing off three blasts \nfrom his photon pistol at Dark Claw.\n\n---\n\nStreetwise transformed to his police car mode and drove full speed for Flesh \nRipper.\n\n"}}
