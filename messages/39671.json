In a low\ninhuman growl, he roared, &quot;Nightmare, TERRORIZE&quot;. The horse from hell\nthen verred back, and let out a sick moan, as it&#39;s chest opened up, it&#39;s\nfront hooves being stored into it&#39;s abdomine compartment, as it then\nshut, revealing a large Decepticons symbole. It then stood up on it&#39;s\nhind hooves, as three toes sprang down on each, to offer support to the\nlegs. The wings then folded back, as the horse head folded into two\npieces, revealing Nightmares helmet like face. The horse head pieces\nfell to his sided, then emerged fists, becoming his arms. He then\nsaluted to Longhaul. &quot;Affirmative sir.&quot; he moaned in his low dead tone.\n&quot;Decist Jagged.&quot; he ordered.\n\nJagged stopped, and emmited the same abominal excuse for a Hyena cackle.\n&quot;Jagged, Terrorize.&quot; he screamed, as he then did a front hand stand. His\nlower body containing his lower legs, swiveds around, as the paws\nholding him up, emmited reconfigured to become his feet. His Hyena head\nshifted up to his chest, so he had the grim grinning face on his chest.\nHis mane move up the back of his body, perching itself over the\nshoulders, as his face emerged, a mess of teeth, a singe mechanicaly\nenhanced eye, hooking on to the mane. This new set of teeth dripped as\nwell, as he then began to look himself over, the mechanical eye zoomin\nin and out every once in a while, as he checked his many jagged tallons\ncovering his body. &quot;Yeahhhhh, I like it.&quot; he hissed.\n\n"}}
