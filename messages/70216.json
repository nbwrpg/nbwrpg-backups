I have an idea which might help us along maybe? Anyway, I am\nguilty of this as well so i think this applies to us all. Typically\none of us will say:\n\nRodimus Prime steps around the corner, and seeing the battle opens FIRE!\n\nThat sounds good, but since none of know who is being targeted none on\nthe opposing side reacts.\n\nWe could just simply state who we are targeting, and then hopefully\nthis will keep things orderly?\n\n&#39;Rodimus Prime steps around the corner, and seeing the battle, targets\nHydras, and opens FIRE!&#39;\n\nIf you wanted to you could even add an OOC at the bottom stating it in\nvery simple terms, since some of us (like me) can be very wordy, and\nthe true meaning of things can get lost.\n\nFor example:\n\n*************************************************\n\nRodimus Prime stepped around the corner, his optics brightening at the\nbattle before him. Ducking down, to avoid a shot from one of the\nDecepticons, he smiled to himself as he glanced around the corner\nagain and saw Hydras standing in the middle of things giving order.\n\n&quot;I got you now.&quot; Rodimus said to himself as he crouched down and\noriented his weapon on the the multi-headed monstrosity that was\nHydras! The smallest click could be heard as Rodimus pulls the trigger\nsending a tremendous surge of power through the orifice of his gun at\nHydras, the weapon bucking slightly as the energy left the barrel!\n\nOOC: Rodimus dodges weapons fire, ducks low and fires on Hydras with\nhis laser blaster\n\n*************************************************\n\nDoes that make sense? I will probrably implement it on my own posts,\nbut what are everyone else thoughts?\n\nOf course the above was only an example, and not an IC post :)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
