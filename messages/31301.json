They had thought,\nwell all \n&gt; of them but Cinder, that Striker and his team were gone, yet at\nleast Prowl \n&gt; had survived. They had worried the most about him, for the same\nreason as \n&gt; the one that caused Cinder&#39;s face to be redder than her natural\ncoloring \n&gt; right now, though Prowl didn&#39;t seem to notice.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re all ok. Someone told us that you&#39;re the only one of Striker&#39;s\nteam \n&gt; left on the planet?&quot; Mantle&#39;s statement was a question, because he\nwasn&#39;t \n&gt; sure. He had other friends on Striker&#39;s team, and he hoped that they\nwern&#39;t \n&gt; all gone.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
