Beneath them, the \ntechno-organic land was scrolling fast (is that the word?). The land&#39;s \nstate was likely to provoke some reaction in Firedrill. However, \nbefore them, a huge obeliskofnod-like tower stood straight. The \nshields around it lowered. A platform of techno-organic vines formed \nfor the ship to land.\n\nBelthassan: Done, Melchana. Please come directly, as I said, to the \nStorage room.\n\nMelchana: But wouldn&#39;t Daemos...\n\nBelthassan: If I have to make this an order, so be it, trainer.\n\nMelchana slowly smiled: Good, sir.
