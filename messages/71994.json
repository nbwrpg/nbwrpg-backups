It&#39;s the universal greeting, or so they say.\n&gt; Why don&#39;t you come out now and play?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The goodies held in his off hand, as if offering.  So his plan was if the\n&gt; entity was friendly, it would see the goodies and hopefullyb e relaxed by\n&gt; them. A nd if it was threatening or moved in to attack, then he could use\n&gt; his main hand to whip out his slingshot to use the goodies for an extra\n&gt; &#39;burst&#39; of ammo to shoot over at it for an added punch to get himself room\n&gt; to fight!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Why don&#39;;t you come out to play?  We can have some fun this way!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a pause as the optics that examined WHEELIE seemed to watch\nhim carefully. There was no sound only an intensity and perhaps even a\ncuriousity.\n\nThen the optics wink out as if a light switch had been shut off\nleaving WHEELIE alone again, or at least apparently alone.\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cautiously standing a good distance away from the figure, Tucson slowly\n&gt; draws his sword, and keeps it in hand with the blade faced to the ground.\n&gt; Slowly, he walks toward the figure.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hello, are you in need of help?&quot;\n\nThere is the sound as something rustled in the leaves and brush a good\ndistance ahead and then stopped. Then there was the sound of something\nsparking or buzzing and then it too fell silent.\n\nTUSCON as he approached was begining to detect something that smelled\ndistinctly like lubricant. He was still perhaps 30 yards from whatever\nit was when he came to a clearing, if it could be called a clearing.\nNoonday sun splashed down on a fallen tree, an explosion of\nundergrowth was already trying to come up around the tree. It was\nperhaps a few days old, but already weeds and grasses and even a few\nsmall trees were climbing upwards, fed by the rich soil of the jungle\nfloor.\n\nIt was on the otherside of a clearing from TUSCON, tucked into brush\nand thick undergrowth was whatever it was that TUSCON had detected.\nThe smell of lubricant was definitly detectable.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
