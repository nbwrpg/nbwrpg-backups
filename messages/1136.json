My friend said no, so I&#39;m gonna send it again, kay?)\n\nTavatron just stood there for a second. She couldn&#39;t believe what she was \nhearing! Tavatron growled menacingly as she unsheathed her drill sword. \nTavatron heard the call of battle too, but she knew when to lay down her \nweapons and rest!\n\nDinobot had not risked his life to save hers just to get blown away by some \npathetic member of the Alliance! Tavatron ran in front of Dinobot, and \npointed her sword at the center of his chest:\n\n&quot;We have been ordered back to base. You are in no condition to fight. Now, \neither come willingly or, Primus help me, I&#39;ll run you through and drag you \nthere in stasis lock!&quot;\n\nTavatron didn&#39;t like being so harsh with him. He had done so much for her, \nand she had tried to repay his kindness... with kindness. That was the \nproblem. He was a warrior.\n\nVery well, then she would treat him as one. Tavatron sighed inwardly as she \ntried to calm herself. She was truly concerned for his welfare, but at this \nrate he wouldn&#39;t survive more than a few nanoclicks in battle. Tavatron knew \nshe wouldn&#39;t be able to stop Dinobot if he truly wanted to engage the \nalliance, but she would try. Tavatron&#39;s expression softened:\n\n&quot;Please, if not for your sake... then for mine.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
