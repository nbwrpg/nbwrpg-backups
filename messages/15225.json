The only way Phobia\n&gt; doesn&#39;t get it is if He, Dollen and Goldeneye vote for the same\n&gt; person. And if they do that were screwed. There would be no way to\n&gt; tie break. There would be on 5 votes, but not six. But one more vote\n&gt; for Phobia would ensure victory. Alright guys, what&#39;s your vote. You\n&gt; guys decided. I&#39;m going to have a little rest. The pain&#39;s getting\n&gt; pretty heavy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream walked for a few metres saw a little pond through the\n&gt; bushes. He went to Octopus mode and went in. the water felt soothing.\n&gt; He was still within ear shot, so he could hear the last votes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
