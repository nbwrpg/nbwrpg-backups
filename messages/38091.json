Before long the ground begins to rumble below \nhim as a humming sound is heard. Finally to Darkfates side two parts \nof the wall slide away and the room he was in goes totally black, \nhowever the new doorway reveals a new room, a massive room that is \nvery dark however lights of pale red and blue shine all over towards \na large command section. A huge orb revealing a completely \nholographic representation of the Earth is also in the middle of the \nroom.\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Darkfate:\n&gt; \n&gt; Darkfate walked, towards the doorway... taking his precautions.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; As Darkfates scanner try to detect bots, they can find none. \n&gt; However \n&gt; &gt; below darkfate a bright red line seems to glow before it extends \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; a great distance, at the end, a doorway lights up with intense \n&gt; white \n&gt; &gt; light.\n\n\n"}}
