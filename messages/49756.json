He added in the coordinates of all the \nknown enemy \n&gt; bases he had scanned while on his little romp with Rodimus. They \nwerent far \n&gt; from Megatrons base. The maximals were far away but that would not \npose to \n&gt; big of a problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::another pod activates::\n&gt;  The medium sized pod pulled himself out.

He&#39;s who he turned to to think \nup any new \n&gt; toys that may help in the war.  Quilldart with glee ran out of the \nroom into \n&gt; the lab and started to clean it up.\n&gt;   He turned to Empath..&quot;how are our friends coming along.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
