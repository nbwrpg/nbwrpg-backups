Luckily for him Captain and the Warden were there to help so Celeron spent the entire fight behind the holotable.  Fumeral had charged into the room, took a quick look around, then was knocked over by the Warden&#39;s large energy cannons.  Needless to say, now the Warden had a clear shot, Fumeral was easy to subdue.\n\nThe Warden, who couldn&#39;t fit into the bridge, managed to stick his arm in and drag Fumeral out of the ship.  The Warden returned to the prison block to put Fumeral back into a working containment cell.\n\nAs the Captain tended to his wounded engineer, Celeron tried to put his computer back together.  When Celeron gave up trying, there was an awkward silence.\n\nFinally Celeron spoke:\n\n&quot;don&#39;t worry, I was just investigating this ship, I didn&#39;t intend to steal it from you.&quot;\n\nCaptain stared at Celeron.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not an inmate...&quot;\n\n&quot;Allright.  Then what usefull skills do you have?&quot;\n\n&quot;well....fixing, repairing, salvaging, stealing, killing.... What do you have in mind?&quot;\n\n&quot;Can you help me fix my ship and revive my 8 remaining crewmembers?  I can&#39;t give you an official commission, but I can reward you for your work.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure....that can work&quot;\n\nThey returned to their work; silently.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nGet advanced SPAM filtering on Webmail or POP Mail ...
