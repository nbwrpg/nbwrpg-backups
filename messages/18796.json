He \nswears.\n\n&quot;Maximals, stay clear of the chips,&quot; he says, jumping when a huge rattle \ncollapsing sound sounded near him. He spins around, his eyes widening when he \nsees the Ark collapse in a clowd of dust. The dust clears, revealing nothing \nmore than a pile of metal, charred and bent. Ramulus looks at it in horror, \nexpecting to dissapear due to a time rip.\n\nBut nothing happened. The forest and heap of metal and Ramulus remained there \nas before, with no new feeling but a slight feel of relief in Ramulus. He \nexhales, realizing he had been holding his breath. Thank the Matrix Blue \nStinger had taken the Autobots out of the Ark..\n\nHe turns back to where he thought Tamtron was, firing a few shots at him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing two missiles come out of nowhere, Proto aims his rifle, firing at the \nplace where the two missiles had emerged from.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen jumps out of the way of a missile, the explosion sending him \nflying through a tree and falling onto the ground.\n\n"}}
