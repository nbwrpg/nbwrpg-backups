I wasn&#39;t sure which Rogues were being used right now when \nI \n&gt; did the update, so I&#39;ll have to change than. I just guessed for the \n&gt; most part. There was an order that they were supposed to be put up \n&gt; in? *blinks* i can&#39;t tell that part, I just see that you&#39;ve added a \n&gt; character with a faction and a name. Kinda like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; Rogue: Darigaaz/Devilcat.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Then I add the second part there to the character page. You should \n&gt; send me an email bout who is supposed to go where, and then i&#39;ll \n&gt; change it. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Not to disparage your efforts or anything, but you fudged the \n&gt; &gt; starting Rogue roster, and Phoenix&#39;s link is broken (you \n&gt; misspelled \n&gt; &gt; her name).  The Rogue list should have Gatara and Torin in place \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; Devilcat and Lunara.  (Oh well, they&#39;ll come into things \n&gt; eventually.)\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
