He couldn&#39;t possibly think of how many times his beast mode \ncame in handy. He carefully walked across the top, with his feet \nclicking against the metal frame. His feet were the best thing with a \nsmooth, uneven surface. \n\nHe stopped beside the hatchway of the roof. He had a feeling almost \nevery base had one. It looked like this one did. He crouched down and \nprode the fangs of his cobra arm under the slit and struggled to lift \nit up. He pulled until the base of the fangs began to hurt. He wasn&#39;t \nstupid enough to keep doing it until he broke them off, so he \nstopped, and pondered at the situation. The slagging thing was locked.\n\nHe tried another method. He aimed his cobra arm into the hinge of the \nhatch and fired continuously into it, making the beam of energy melt \nthe metal down. \n\n\n"}}
