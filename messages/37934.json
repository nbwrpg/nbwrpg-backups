He was glad to have found a rag-tag \nbunch of hooligans he could bunk with until he recovered. He had \ntravelled alone for ar too long and he was glad that he found\ncomrads. \nHe was almost glad for his lost battle. He ran his fingers over his \ncockpit as he thought and quickly drew them away when agony shot \nthrough him.\n    &quot;Damn...I love... my cockpit.&quot; he said, strain and frustration in \nhis voice. He paused and joined Beachcomber at his side. He watched \nthe blue Autobot survey his surroundings. &quot;If I may add...&quot; he said \ncarefully, &quot;try to find a spot..were...I can...fly...You can ..use me \nas an aerial...scout.&quot;\n    Redhot&#39;s expression became dark.
