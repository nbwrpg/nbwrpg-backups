The inorganic missile smashed off Cliffjumper&#39;s head,\nas he turned his gun. When he turned his head to see where the rock had\ncame from, a large purple hand swatted him in the flace, sending a\nscreaming Autobot sailing. \n\n&quot;What it halfpint.&quot; is what Cliffjumper heard, as he looked up to see a\nbadly dammaged, transformed, and angry Slugslinger stood above him,\nfists clenched. Cliffjumper aimed his gun at the Decepticon, but\nCaliburst was quicker to react, as he grabbed his gun, and blasted\nCliffjumper in the side, then did a kick up, and leapt largely into a\nback flip, transforming into Calibursts sub machine gun. Cliffjumper\nopened his eyes again after the pain subsided, and saw the barrel of\nCaliburst. &quot;Rust in Pieces Autobot.&quot; SLugslinger said with disdain.\n\n"}}
