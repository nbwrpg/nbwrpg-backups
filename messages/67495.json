Also I can only assume that =\r\nsince no one\n&gt; &gt; responded before when I was verifying positions, everyone =\r\nsave for\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus, Scourge, Rodimus, Remus, and the sweeps was still at=\r\n\nAtlantis\n&gt; &gt; during the battle??? Which would mean that all would have som=\r\ne\ndistance\n&gt; &gt; to make up before they would catch up with Cyc. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Al=\r\nso I am having to assume that Cyclonus and crew are being shot at\n&gt; &gt; BEFOR=\r\nE they fade from visual range, but they are moving fast. Cyc is\n&gt; &gt; not goi=\r\nng to hang around. So please consider my responses an amending\n&gt; &gt; of my la=\r\nst post.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the air, the fading from view but n=\r\not quite gone Cyclonus is moving\n&gt; &gt; swiftly through the air. His body is d=\r\nigesting the new power it has\n&gt; &gt; recieved and is enjoying it. Power flows =\r\nthrough his circuits as his\n&gt; &gt; own systems merge with the now corrupted po=\r\nwer of the matrix. His form\n&gt; &gt; seems to radiate a new power, his fusion po=\r\nwered engines thrusting him\n&gt; &gt; foward at amazing speeds. He knew he would =\r\nbe able to hold this new\n&gt; &gt; power, his instructions from Unicron had said =\r\nas much, but the sheer\n&gt; &gt; power was almost intoxicating. Internally he smi=\r\nled.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was then that bullets from a gatling gun caught up with hi=\r\nm,\nlightly\n&gt; &gt; scored his armor and then fell behind as the Cyclonus whippe=\r\nd foward!\n&gt; &gt; It was not that the guns lacked power, but simply the speed t=\r\nhat these\n&gt; &gt; ships were flying and the distance they were away, by the tim=\r\ne the\n&gt; &gt; bullets caught up they were as pebbles striking titanium shields.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Howerever Cyclonus did have a response as twin missiles errupted=\r\n from\n&gt; &gt; beneath his wings. For a moment the missiles seemed to hover \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n as they changed direction orienting on thier target. Then they burst\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nnto explosive movement, glowing with encapselated power. Rather then\n&gt; &gt; mi=\r\nssiles with flame behind them as Cyclonus&#39; missiles looked before,\n&gt; &gt; they=\r\n were now like twin suns as they fairly irradiated power and\n&gt; &gt; destructio=\r\nn as they moved toward the source of the bullets: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the missiles=\r\n streak passed, the sweeps fall in behind Cyclonus and\n&gt; &gt; Scourge, forming=\r\n a protective shield as they pick up speed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For the moment Remus i=\r\ns ignored as the Unicronians moved foward,\n&gt; &gt; picking up speed!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; P=\r\nreston\n&gt; &gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;      \n&gt;\n______________________________=\r\n______________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Be a better pen =\r\npal. \n&gt; &gt; Text or chat with friends inside Yahoo!
