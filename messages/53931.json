But the nearly-emotionless Riekan is made \nof sterner stuff and shakes off the attack.  Devilcat himself has \nmade it this far in life partly by realizing the only thing to fear \nis fear itself, and ignores Dreadplague&#39;s projections.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; She had flown a great distance in a short time and she knew she was\n&gt; near to the one she called her father. Her grotesque but terrible\n&gt; beast mode had seen the shots being fired and the lone figure \nwreathed\n&gt; in light. That is where she went.\n&gt; \n&gt; The sound of huge wingflap made Tyrael turn around. What he saw was\n&gt; nothing he had ever believed could exist. It was a large\n&gt; techno-organic wyvern-like beast, all black and covered with sharp\n&gt; spikes covering its body. And it was his daughter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dreadplague: Major Tyrael, I am Dreadplague, Tripredacus warrior and\n&gt; your daughter. I hereby swear my alligeance to you and the \nTripredacus\n&gt; in our goals on Earth. Could we land?\n&gt; \n&gt; He nodded and came down on the ground. She followed him and perched\n&gt; herself on a dead log, but she didn&#39;t transform.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dreadplague: I had to ask you something... You designed me to be\n&gt; something more, didn&#39;t you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Yes. I once had this fierce warrior under me, but he died in\n&gt; one of his first battle under my command. I respected his will and\n&gt; used his material to create you. But with some Predacon secrets in \nmy\n&gt; hands, I hoped to make even better than he was. You know you can. \nShow me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dreadplague complied. She transformed into something no one would \nhave\n&gt; thought of (except Rauq!): a techno-organic helicopter, having her\n&gt; wyvern face as the cockpit and large spikes as the pales.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dreadplague: You have made me something great, father. Not only am I\n&gt; techno-organic, but my powers exceed those of most transformers. I \nam\n&gt; a Techno-organic 2.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, she tranformed, becoming the large cloaked bot. The place\n&gt; seemed to darken and even Tyrael aura wavered. She let a long shriek\n&gt; out and drew her long sword. Her main weapon was now unleashed as \nshe\n&gt; sent panic and distress in the minds of all who were on the \nbattlefield.\n\n\n"}}
