He glances at Najah. &quot;Torture\n&gt; never gives the best results, Najah.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks back at Lady Hawk. If Squizzy could replicate the\n&gt; experiments, then Lady Hawk would obvioustly not be needed. A bot was\n&gt; always useful, yes, but not one that would run away first chance he\n&gt; or she got, and Zardus had a feeling that Lady Hawk would do just\n&gt; that.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmm.. Squizzy denied of wanting to copy your experiments, and since\n&gt; I know the programming that is running through her head, I am fairly\n&gt; sure I can believe her.
