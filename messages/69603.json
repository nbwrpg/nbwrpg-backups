Cyclonus better be ready, Tucson isn&#39;t one to give up too quickl=\r\ny. \n\nBIC:\n\nThe drive to succeed, it was now surging rapidly through Tucson&#39;=\r\ns pistons and fuel injectors. He wasn&#39;t about to let a little pot hole get =\r\nin the way of him reaching his leader who he now believed was POW and held =\r\nunder demonic control. Reaching speeds of well over one twenty MPH he kicks=\r\n up dust beneath his tires and handles the roughness of the terrain as if i=\r\nt were as smooth as newly laid down asphault. His sonar systems now pick up=\r\n the density and size of the dark tower which drives him forward, not to me=\r\nntion the fact that he could pick up heat signatures which resembled his ow=\r\nn. He knew. Rodimus was there, and no doubt he&#39;d be there with some familli=\r\nar enemies. The thought of Decepticons being involved in this enrages him e=\r\nven more.\n\nHe thinks things through while driving toward the tower, where h=\r\ne could sense Rodimus&#39;s heat signatures.\n\n&quot; How could I have let this happe=\r\nn? If I hadn&#39;t let my guard down the first time, and gotten myself shot, yo=\r\nu wouldn&#39;t be in this mess Rodimus. I promise you this though, this time, I=\r\n will bring you back, and I will not abandon you. No matter how hateful you=\r\n are of me, no matter how badly you want to destroy me. My spark is dedicat=\r\ned to those I care deeply for. That part of me will never die. I will also =\r\nmake those who are responsible for what they have done to you, pay for what=\r\n they did. They had no right taking your spark and your soul. I swear by th=\r\ne name of Primus that I will risk my own spark to see yours safely out of h=\r\narm&#39;s way.&quot;\n\nHe was now nearing the tower.

Ohh yeah=\r\n, this definitely has your name writen all over it. Right, well, enjoy the =\r\nparty while it lasts because I&#39;m about to crash it... Literally.&quot;\n\nHe sense=\r\ns he&#39;s only a few feet from the tower, and transforms. Yet, he keeps hidden=\r\n. He knew that an all out attack wasn&#39;t the best way to go. If he was going=\r\n to succeed in this mission, he&#39;d have to do it without being seen and righ=\r\nt underneath Cyclonus&#39;s nose. He was good at staying out of the sight of th=\r\ne enemy. Not only had he trained with Kup, but also trained with Prowl. Sil=\r\nence was his middle name. He sends a low powered sonar wave to see if it pi=\r\ncks up anything. In the general area he was clear of incombants. He knew th=\r\nat if he touched the tower there could be an alarm system. He scans for tha=\r\nt.\n\n&quot;Hmm... Just in case, I should activate a scrambling wave. That should =\r\nquiet any security system that could be active here.. I hope.&quot;\n\nHe waits a =\r\ngood five minuts or so until he&#39;s sure that the system is disabled. Once he=\r\n runs a scan of his sonar systems, he concludes that it did indeed have a m=\r\nild effect on the system, which made it safe for him to approach the tower.=\r\n He again hides behind a mass of debris, and finds that breeze catches his =\r\nface, from the opposite side of the tower. There was a door that was partia=\r\nlly opened. He feels for it with his fingers, and quietly slides it open ju=\r\nst enough to sqeeze in, which was a little bit of a squeeze for him. This w=\r\nas it, he was inside. Again, not wanting to make it obvious, he quietly sli=\r\ndes the door just a bit ajar, to make sure he isn&#39;t discovered. Then, quiet=\r\nly he hides again, and stops to try to pick up Rodimus&#39;s heat signature onc=\r\ne more. It was difficult, because his temperature continued to drop with ev=\r\nery ounce of energy that was being stolen from him. \n\n&quot; All right, low heat=\r\n signature, this is going to make it a little difficult to track. Time to b=\r\noost up my receptors a bit... And it wouldn&#39;t hurt to scramble my signals e=\r\nither...&quot; \n\nTucson had never known fear and apprehension. With every slow s=\r\ntep, he becomes more and more familliar with both emotions. He couldn&#39;t let=\r\n them stop him. He was doing this to save Rodimus, a gesture from the spark=\r\n who&#39;s power is relentless. His affections for his leader keeps him focused=\r\n on the task at hand. And it isn&#39;t long until his persistance pays off. The=\r\n ping was loud and clear, and yes, it was Rodimus. The signature read Decep=\r\nticon though. But knowing what Kenzo had told him, he keeps reserved. Now, =\r\nhe wanted to be seen and heard. With his cross bow subspaced he stands idol=\r\n, but ready for anything. And quietly with a soft tone of voice..\n\n&quot;Rodimus=\r\n.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Just to clarify. The physical structure that holds the energy of the =\r\nmatrix is still inside of Rodimus, but the energy itself was siphoned out b=\r\ny Cyclonus during one of their climatic encounters. It was part of what has=\r\n given Cyclonus his new found power.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sandy feel free to go ahead. I th=\r\nink this will all make for good RP.

He=\r\n was doing \nthis to save Rodimus, a gesture from the spark who&#39;s power is r=\r\nelentless. His \naffections for his leader keeps him focused on the task at =\r\nhand. And it isn&#39;t \nlong until his persistance pays off. The ping was loud =\r\nand clear, and yes, it \nwas Rodimus. The signature read Decepticon though. =\r\nBut knowing what Kenzo had \ntold him, he keeps reserved. Now, he wanted to =\r\nbe seen and heard. With his cross \nbow subspaced he stands idol, but ready =\r\nfor anything.

This puts the Matrix of \nLeadershi=\r\np at a grave Risk, but most of all, his spark, which I believe is too \nprec=\r\nious to waste for evil purposes. I can not abandon my leader, not even in \n=\r\nhis corruptive state. I hereby announce that I am on route to locating my \n=\r\nleader, and I DO intend to BRING HIM BACK. Hopefully, the damage can be \nre=\r\nversed. If not, there is question of the well being of the Matrix. I must \n=\r\nrecover it, perhaps not for my own personal gain, but for the benefit of Au=\r\ntobot \nkind. It&#39;s too precious to lose to the hands of those who thirst for=\r\n power and \ngreed. I swear by Primus&#39;s name, I will return, but my return m=\r\nay not be a fast \none. May Primus guide you as he guides me. This is Tucson=\r\n, signing off.
