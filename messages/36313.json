I&#39;M BACK!!\nThough I&#39;m barely up to date so excuse any mistakes, please.\n\n* Finishing up, IR looks over past the assembled Maximals to two beams of \nlight that extended from the roof and ended at the floor.*\n\n&quot; There&#39;s your task.&quot;\n\n* She pointed towards the bars before walking over to them, looking one up \nand down before turning her eyes back towards the crew.**\n\n&quot; This is a basic dodge and strike simulation.&quot;\n\n* A floating Predacon symbol appeared between the two beams. IR pointed to \nit.*\n\n&quot; Your target&quot;\n\n* But then the two beams began to move around the symbol.*\n\n&quot; You strike the symbol, you dodge the beams. But if you get hit by \none...you&#39;ll experience an electric shock that has the same feeling as \ngetting punched in the stomach by any enemy you would face on the field.&quot;\n\n* Suddenly the beams then began to move in an eragular pattern, \nunpradictable.*\n\n&quot; They&#39;re signature seaking, so watch it.&quot;\n\n* Iron then stepped back and walked back to the Maximals.*\n\n&quot; But if they hit each other they&#39;ll multiply, so if you don&#39;t want a room \nfilled with them I suggest you use your brains to their full extent. &quot;\n\n* The armor rectacted from around her chest to leave a black, metal tank top \nwhile her arms, neck and so on was left bare. Though below her torso \nremained armored.*\n\n&quot; This is a game of stratagy and reflexes.&quot;\n\n* The beams began to calm and soon were circling the symbol again, yet so \nface you could barely see them move.*\n\n&quot; So let&#39;s get started.&quot;\n\n* Suddenly the wall behind the Maximals retracted, equiptment resembling \ntenis rackest extending, enough for everyone.\nIR smiled.*\n\n&quot; Oh...and I forgot to mention...&quot;\n\n* She pulled a ball from behind her back, yellow and about as large as a \ntennise ball but made out of energy.*\n\n&quot; These are what we&#39;re using to hit that symbol.&quot;\n\n* Behind her Tremmer grumbled.*\n\nT: &quot; One huge Tennise match.&quot;\n\n* IR shrugged.*\n\n&quot; Basically.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
