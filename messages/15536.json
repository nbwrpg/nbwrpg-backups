Never \none \n&gt; &gt; for words, Bullet simply drew his gaitling gun and fired 150 \nshots.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hammer, Prebon&#39;s second-in-command, ran up to Ratchet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You know...there&#39;s a reason they call me Hammer....(No, not \n&gt; because \n&gt; &gt; he has a hammer)&quot; Hammer leaped into the air and came down with a \n&gt; &gt; kick to Ratchet&#39;s chest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blaze transformed to meet the snow cat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Cat fight....&quot; She pulled out the flame thrower and started to \n&gt; burn \n&gt; &gt; the leopard.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Prebon gazed into Spears&#39; eyes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You should feel honoured.
