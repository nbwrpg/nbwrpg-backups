He flies up, looking down at \nRage as the monster continues to attack his troops.\n\n&quot;If she stays conscious, lure her to the enemy,&quot; he says into his \ncomm-link to Feline, about to swoop down on Deemos and Shockaract \nwhen a bot flies into view.\n\n&quot;Who is the owner of this base?&quot; the bot asks. He was a jet. Two \nrocket launchers along with several maching guns were mounted onto \nhis wings, and his bottom had a hatch that looked like it could drop \nbombs.\n\n&quot;I am,&quot; Zardus says, flying up to him and looking him over.\n\n&quot;Good,&quot; the bot says, &quot;My name is Havoc. Me and my troops will be \njoining you for the time being. We will need use of some facilities \nafter the battle.&quot;\n\nZardus nods, looking at Havoc. &quot;Excellent.... That is the enemy,&quot; he \npoints down to Shockaract&#39;s group, &quot;Except for him,&quot; he says as he \npoints at Burning Hammer.&quot;\n\nTurning around without a word, Havoc dives down at Shockaract&#39;s group \nwith record speed, pulling up seconds before hitting the ground and \nflying over them, missiles streaming toward Shockaract. &quot;War \nMachines, attack the enemy,&quot; he says into his comm-link, climbing for \nanother dive.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRepressor flies into the scene, swirling around to face Shockaract&#39;s \ngroup. Going forward, the chopper shoots missiles at them from side \nmounted missile launchers, aiming at Jetstorm.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike ducks under a shot, gaining altitude and replacing his \nmissile launcher with a rifle.\n\nHe aims quickly, firing off three shots at Diskus.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDark One swears, recieving Zardus&#39; transmission (the one about the \nbattle). He looks at Tarantulus. &quot;You can have this pod. But we will \nmeet again.&quot;\n\nHe takes off into the air and flies off toward the Alliance base, the \nrest of the Oblitercons following him, also having recieved Zardus&#39; \ntransmission.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer frowns, waiting for the pod to get done scanning. This was \nwasting time, and time was valuable right now....\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Diskus flies straight up and avoids the missiles.
