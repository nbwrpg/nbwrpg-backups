Now, streaching before them was a vast \nforest that rested at the foothills of a large mountian, a mountian which, \nwhen climed, would take them to Adrax and Autofire.\n    &quot;Waspinator! Transform into beast mode....i dont want any unsuspected \nvisitors arriving.&quot; He said, as he transformed.\n    The wasp did as he was told, and together in beast modes they started to \ngain altitude as they came closer to the mountian.\n\n    Paralysis was knocked clear of the explosion, as was Aerostreak. \nUnfortunetly for Grappler and Guantix, they were killed. The fire raged on, \nand soon a few trees nearby were engulfed.\n    &quot;Aerostreak! Hey! Get up! We need to get out of here!&quot; Paralysis yelled \nand a few trees came crashing down around them. The heat became so intense \nhis armor started to bubble.\n    The Hawlk was in sheer sadness over the death of his brother and sister, \nwho know lay baking under a burning tree. Paralysis grabbed him, threw him \nover his shoulder, and ran as fast as he could out of the forest.\n\n    Aracnia and Tarantulas had made great progress on the Bunker while the \ntroops were gone. The shiled was working, as were the Autoguns. The spiders \ncleaned out most of the rooms, destroyed the garbage and useless items in \nthere, and buitl a lab and wepons locker, and also quarters. They had been \nexpecting more troops, unaware that Phobia had came and saved the day....so \nto speak.\n    Black Aracnia walked down the main corridor and entered the new Command \nRoom. Scince this base was not a ship, it could not be called a bridge. \nAlthough, further exploration of the delapidated regions of the bunker might \nprovide a hanger or missle silo where ships could come and go. As the doors \nslid open, she was greeted by a slew of new Predacon Computer and several \nfloating viewing screens as well as the Command Chair.\n    &quot;Tarantulas, use the scanners to locate out team.&quot; She commanded, taking \nher seat and looking to the Radar screen to her left. On it appeared a global \nmap and scattered dots.\n    He rhasped back to her, &quot;Paralysis and Aerostreak are en route back here, \nas is Quickstrike. Darkmouse, according to my data, is still at the battle \nscene. Guantix and Grappler are dead....and the other Predacons are \ncompletely off my scanners.&quot;\n    Aracnia slammed her tiny claw on the arm of the massive chair. &quot;What do \nyou mean dead? And how can all the Predacons be missing? What the hell \nhappened out there?!?!&quot; She suddenly became rather angry. &quot;Open a channel to \nQuickstrike, now!!!&quot;\n    Tarantulas, from a small station in the Command Room, did as he was told \nand the screen changed from a radar display to a display of Quickstrike \nwalking through the woods. Aracnia shook her head as she touched her comm \nunit on her collar. \n    &quot;Sub-Commander Quickstrike! Where is Darkmouse and Kitkat&#39;s group? Tell \nme everything that happened at that Cave!!!&quot;\n\n"}}
