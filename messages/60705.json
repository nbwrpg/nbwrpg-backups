She\nlaid within the small sleek craft, barely large enough\nfor her slender form, and light equipment.  In one\nhand she held her staff, she preferred to use it as a\nmelee weapon, but it was quite capable of delivering\nenergy blasts of moderate power.  In her other hand\nshe held twenty bolts.  They were her power, by how\nthey fell she could see the future to some extent. \nShe was nothing to compare with Seer, Ex, her beloved\nDeus, or even Machina, but she had some skill, and had\nstolen some destiny energy.\n\n\tShe blew on the bolts, and asked them, �What is so\nimportant about this �Organics�, why does the destiny\nenergy settle about her so.  She threw them, and saw\nmany patterns gather.  Most of them were indistinct,\nrepresenting the chaotic course of destiny, but one\nwas quite clear, one bolt laying against another, and\na third before them.\n\n\t�A potential child,� chuckled Fortuneteller, �well\nI�ll soon put a stop to that.�  She whispered to the\nbolts again �Who is the father?�\n\n\tThe bolts were once again unclear, showing four\nseparate possible candidates, but one was most\ndistinct, taking ten bolts in his pattern.  His bolts\nwere chaotic, mad, but still of one pattern.\n\n\tFinally she asked her final questions of the bolts,\n�What is so special about this child?�  She gasped at\nthe final pattern.  The bolts were quite clear this\ntime, while even without her there was no assurance\nthe child would exist, beyond the child one future\ndominated seventeen of the bolts, and the other three\nlay scattered, in un-formed future.  The possible\ntimeline she would be stealing for the Deviners uses\nwould be a very different one indeed.  In fear of\nloosing the child the mother would put it onboard the\nArk in stasis, even putting his spark within an\nAutobot body.  When the child awakened HE, not Optimus\nPrime would become the leader of the Autobots. \nThrough some odd device the mother would both allow\nhis spark to mature over the eons, and erase all\npossible memory of his former life.  Under his\nguidance the Great War would be a massacre of\nDecepticons, a future in which only the Maximals\nexisted.  Her son would be the most ruthless, and\nbrilliant transformer ever to draw energon, but such a\ngreat leader he would have no need of the Matrix.  If\nshe read them right he even discovered some way to\ndestroy Unicron without opening it!\n\n\tDeus would reward her for this.  She thought of her\nprecious Deus, and knew as always he was just using\nher.  She looked at her reflection in the forward\nshuttle window.  She wasn�t old, but worn with the\nfading beauty of mid-life.  Deus was perhaps older\nthan she, but his destiny energy kept him looking ten\ncycles younger.  Still, she was his to command, and\nshe would do as he bid, even to her own death.\n\n\tShe aimed her shuttle at the place where she sensed\nher pray, slightly beside the Maximal Base, but still\nwithin their shields.  She sent out a distress signal,\n �HELLO!  UNKNOWN BASE DO YOU COPY!  I�M OUT OF\nCONTROL AND I WILL HIT YOUR SHIELDS IF YOU DO NOT\nLOWER THEM!  HURRY!�\n\nOOC: All that she envisioned was just a possible\nfuture, don�t think I�m forcing anyone into anything\n(for that matter I�m still waiting on the council to\ntell me the restrictions on the Deviners).\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
