On impact, the beams would generate an energy explosion \ntwice the size of a grenade&#39;s.\n\nKillfest recieves War&#39;s message. He didn&#39;t see how it could help to \nget to a hologram. Magmatron&#39;s troops should be able to see the \nbattle if they fly in. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther flies up into the air and growls, looking down. He saw \nDarkmouse diving into the bushes away from multiple shots and then \nfiring back. The energon beings seemed to be firing at her.\n\nScyther swoops down, grabbing Darkmouse and flying away. Darkmouse \nyelps in surprise, getting hit by a shot and firing down at Akron.\n\nTo everyone but Scyther, it seemed that Darkmouse was suddenly flying \nby herself away from the battle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer yells a battlecry, his missile launchers flipping up, \nrepaired by internal repairs, and firing at Tankorr. This was his \nturf now, and he was sure he&#39;d be able to do much better.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmashing a tree out of his way, Greven lets out a laugh as he sees \nall the bots attacking and feels a missile explode against his back. \nHe arms his missile launchers, firing from one at Tarantulus and from \nthe other at the group of energonians.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGoldeneye yelps, flying up into the air. She aims as well as she can, \nfiring down several shots at Tarantulus.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDrillBit ducks under a few shots, flying backwards as something hits \nhim in the chest. He jumps back up, firing his gattling gun at the \ngroup of energonians.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDollen dives out of the way of some shots, ending up on his knees. He \nquickly jumps up and returns fire, several bolts heading for Tankorr.\n\n\n"}}
