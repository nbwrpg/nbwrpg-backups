Allright, I have just completed the poll system in the login, and\nnow its time to begin going full gear toward the election. For this,\nseveral things need to happen first:\n\nWe need to get comfortable with the login system, and all get\nusernames on it. Several events will lead to this:\n\n1. All character profiles on the site will have to be DELETED. PLEASE\ngo to the site and save them on your comps or print them out or\nsomething, unless you want to rewrite them, which is fine.\n\n2. When you&#39;re done backing up all your chars, send me an email with\nthe following info:\n   a. Desired username (for the site).\n   b. A suggestion for the message board colors (two text colors and\ntwo background colors. Text and background should look nice together).\n\n3. When I get your email, I will make you an account on the site and\nsend you the username and a temporary password for it.\n\n4. You should log in (there is now a link from the main page, which is\nat http://nbwrpg.com), and change your password, using the password\nchanger once you&#39;re logged in. KEEP IN MIND: do NOT use the password\nfrom your email or any other service you have. I CAN and sometimes\nwill have to view these passwords for site upkeep, so just make up new\npasswords. If you forget your password, email me and I&#39;ll send it to you.\n\n5. Submit all your chars and everything.\n\nAfter all that&#39;s done, we&#39;ll go on with the council election. This is\nwhat I figure it could be like:\n\nFirst everyone who wants to run for council emails me, and I make a\nlist of everyone running. Then I post the list on here, and every\nperson on that list needs to get two &#39;supporters&#39; from amongst the\nRPGs. People running for council can support one person (not\nthemselves), and people that arn&#39;t running can support two _different_\npeople (they can also support themselves, though why they&#39;d want to do\nthis is beyond me). Once a person that is running for council has two\nsupporters, those two supporters should email me or IM me or\nsomething. I&#39;ll keep track of everything. There&#39;ll be a set amount of\ntime to get supporters, and if you can&#39;t get two, then you can&#39;t run.\nAfter that we&#39;ll have a vote at the site, and the new council will be\nelected. I think the council will have three people other than me, so\nwe&#39;ll pick the people with the three highest vote results.\n\nOf course, everything in that last paragraph is just ideas by me and\nby some of the others and are still up for debate, but I think its a\ngood plan. If anyone has ideas, email me.\n\n\nI&#39;m sorry that I didn&#39;t RP much today. Programming takes alot of time\nand energy. I&#39;m barely awake now, so I&#39;m gonna go, but I&#39;ll post tomorrow.\n\nGo to the site and save your chars, everyone. Lets get this done as\nsoon as possible.\n\n\n\nZzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..........\n\n\n"}}
