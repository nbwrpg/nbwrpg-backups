He had his weapon drawn out and at the ready, but so far had no likely target. If he had been aware of Tuscon&#39;s thought that it was he that controlled this new Rodimus he would have laughed. So far there was only enmity covered by a warrior&#39;s respect that seperated the two. Cyclonus had no control over him in the this new Dark Rodimus, that privalge went to Hydras and the other Predacons who lived here. \n\nRodimus continued to follow behind Scourge, his loud foot falls sometimes earning him an annoyed glance from the hunter terminator. Both were ready to fall on thier prey when suddenly . . . \n\n&gt; He gathers the strength to walk into where he could be seen,\n&gt; judging by the heat that lights were giving off, as faint as the\n&gt; lights may be.  He stands before Cyclonus, and Scourge unarmed,\n&gt; yet ready to defend himself if need be.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yes, you do have someone here.  And that someone is me.  I\n&gt; don&#39;t know if you remember me or not, we may not have even met.\n&gt;  My name is Tucson and I&#39;m proud to say that I am a member of the\n&gt; Autobot faction.&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; He then senses Rodimus not too far away.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; All right, Rodimus, I have a question for you, and you may answer\n&gt; at will.  What was the very verse that brought the Matrix of Leadership\n&gt; to life, thus giving you the power of its spark?  I know you know this,\n&gt; and right now you may be hating my sorry servos, but I think I could\n&gt; use a refresher on what it was.  Can you tell me?&quot;\n&gt; \n\nRodimus straighted, he could feel Scourge behind him doing much the same thing. \n\n&quot;The fool! Scourge said, disappoinment written all over his face as well as covering his words. &quot;I would have caught him, and now he walksd right into the open?&quot;\n\nCyclonus also turned to look at the Autbot who stepped from the shadows, even as Darkhawk responded attempted to shoot the Autbot who called himself Tuscon. However the Autobot displayed a suprising amount of dexterity as it not only shot once from his crossbow attempting to knock the weapon from Darkhawk&#39;s hand, , but then flipped over and attempted another attack on him. \n\nAs surprised as he was Cyclonus mearly reoriented his weapon on the newly positioned Tuscon as Scourge did much the same thing. \n\nRodimus looked at Tuscon, no hint of recognition crossing his face as he leveled his own weapon on him. &quot;The only refresher you are going to get here is a refresher in PAIN!&quot; \n\nA trio of energy blasts lanced out at Tuscon as Cyclonus, Scourge and Dark Rodimus opened fire!\n\nOOC: FYI Scourge&#39;s armor makes him generally invisible to sensors, which would include sonar and radar. it also hides his heat personal signature as well. \n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus)\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
