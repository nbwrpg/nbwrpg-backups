It would=\r\n be his only moment of light heartedness.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re absolutely right, Talon=\r\n but it&#39;s a shame that CR chambers are only designed for one individual at =\r\na time.&quot;\n\nHe wispers quietly with a cat like grin on his face.  He then tur=\r\nns to Leo Prime, with an attentive nod.\n\n&quot;Nightshift and Rattrap were out l=\r\nooking for Cheetor together but, an unknown insectile force attacked them a=\r\nnd in an effort to elude them, Nightshift spun out and collided with someth=\r\ning in the forest which caused extensive damage.  He should be in med bay n=\r\now.&quot;\n\nRattrap takes his seat.\n\n&quot;Sorry I&#39;m late Wheels, I had ta help Ramulu=\r\ns get Nightshift inta the med bay.&quot;\n\nTucson nods.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s all right, I und=\r\nerstand.  Now as far as the escaped enemy forces, I&#39;d like to send Silverbo=\r\nlt with Kup to the ship&#39;s parameter to see if you pick up on their signatur=\r\nes.  Once they&#39;ve determined the path of the escaped predicons, I&#39;d like a =\r\nfull report and please, try not to take them on your own.  Call for backup =\r\nthe minute you find them.  I worry about all of you, and if Anything ever h=\r\nappened to anyone of you, I&#39;d never forgive myself.  &quot;\n\nHe sighs.\n\n&quot; No one=\r\n has the right to control what isn&#39;t theirs to govern.  Freedom is the righ=\r\nt of all sentient beings and the right of creatures who were born Naturally=\r\n to this planet.  Leo Prime, I vote we take care of the perpetrator togethe=\r\nr.  He seems to need a taste of his own medicine.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Leo=\r\n Prime, we will do everything in our power to help you but, before we\n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nan  do that, we have to fortify our energy reserves.  We can not succeed on=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; what little we have.

Energ=\r\ny is\n&gt; something that we will all need. Begin at once.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He glanced bac=\r\nk down at the Padd and continued speaking, &quot;Airhammer\n&gt; just gave me a quic=\r\nk report on his mission to pick up Nighshift.&quot; LEO\n&gt; looked back up at TUSC=\r\nON, &quot;Any word on Cheetor who is still missing?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME glanced over=\r\n at the green bot with the Predacon signature\n&gt; and then back at TUSCON, &quot;A=\r\nnd this bot here tells me that some\n&gt; criminals may have escaped from that =\r\nship that fell from the sky. Part\n&gt; of Airhammer&#39;s report shows an individu=\r\nal floating above a massive\n&gt; heard of Dinosaurs of all types.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Loweri=\r\nng the Padd, LEO&#39;s face took on a stern cast, &quot;We may have more\n&gt; to deal w=\r\nith then the Unicronians, the Predacons and leaving this\n&gt; world untouched.=\r\n&quot; He puased, looked at his padd, the green robot and\n&gt; then back at TUSCON,=\r\n &quot;There are criminals that will have to be\n&gt; recovered.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Pr=\r\neston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
