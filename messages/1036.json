His eyes went wild, listening. He skittered to the left, then skittered to the right. He wanted Megatron&#39;s troops, but he also wanted repairs and to get back to base if he could. ---A place to rest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He began to jump from one side to the other, looking as if he was blocking an invisible opponent. He groaned to himself, annoyed and torn. He wanted to do things and to get to saftey. Where was everybody? And where was he? He whimpered in his deep voice, the voice that disgused his real age. \n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Where the heck was Trantsulas?&lt;/EM&gt; \n&lt;P&gt;This was frustrating enough to make his scream and get distructive, as he usually did. \n&lt;P&gt;The spider-clone was a pshyic, so:\n&lt;P&gt;It didn&#39;t take much to image himself as the low crawling scorpion/cobra, pacing tensly. Alone in the dark, damp swamp he didn&#39;t like, surrounded by mossy trees, and a bad stinch that wasn&#39;t his own. The fog drifted heavy. He left off the strong image of his damage, and sent the cause of it, with the three bots he didn&#39;t get the faces off, barging in the door of the control room of Hell Beast&#39;s ship that he thought would hold. The pain as he hit floor, noticing he was limping, and his leg wouldn&#39;t hold out on him as he tried to run for cover. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
