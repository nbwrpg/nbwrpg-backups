However, they sent me here to fetch Talos. As Talos is a great\n&gt; &gt; leader of men, I assume they needed him for either a large-scale\n&gt; &gt; operation or a military planning. Either way, I believe the so-\n&gt; called\n&gt; &gt; Tripredacus are some important military guys, and I think they could\n&gt; &gt; be aiming for Cybertron. What they&#39;re here for, though... Could be\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;re seeking the Ark or the Nemesis, but your bet&#39;s as good as\n&gt; &gt; mine. I don&#39;t really know about them except as rumors as an\n&gt; &gt; underground organization, but I don&#39;t think the Preds are with them,\n&gt; &gt; at least not in practice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s not wise to make demands of someone who could kill you out \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hand,&quot; Devilcat warns.  &quot;But in any event, I&#39;m prepared to return \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to your Maximal brethren - IF you can help us in dealing with \n&gt; these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tripredacus buffoons.
