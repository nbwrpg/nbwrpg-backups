He soon got back to the Predacon base, and he layed\nHell Drak on the ground.  He transformed into robot mode, and picked her up.\nHe looked her from top to bottom.  Her body was long and slender, and curvy.\nShe was beautiful.  But she was an enemy!!!!!!!!!  He carried her inside,\nand took her into the lab, and sat her down.  He sent a transmission to\nBlackarachnia, &quot;Blackarachnia, leader, I have captured a female Maximal, she\nis in the lab here.  What shall we do with her??&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        Hell Drak felt herself laying down on a hard surface.  She could\nhear Decadel talking to Blackarachnia on his com.  She was technically at\nthe Predacon base, but, in her mind, she had no clue where she was.  Her\noptics remained shut, she couldn&#39;t open them.  She also felt she was covered\nin dirt.  She remembered being with her brother, being let in to the Maximal\nbase, the Cybertronian Fire.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n             Necromancer stopped crying, and got up.\n\n            &quot;Yes, we just have to locate them.  I suspect that evil fiend\ntook my sister to a Predacon base,&quot; He said, calmed down now.\n\n\n"}}
