I am also good with demolitions.  I don&#39;t think my past is terriably important, but if you must know I grew up off of Cybertron on a ship with my parents and brother.  My brother died and my parents commited suicide because of my proding.  Immediately there after I comandeered the small ship, which wasn&#39;t hard because I was now alone on it, and spent some time wandering around.  I got into some crossfire in orbit.  The bigger ships probably never noticed me there.  I climbed into the one stasis pod on board and the ship was destroyed.  The next thing I knew I woke up here on this strange planet in a field of llamas.  Then Burning Hammer came for me and I walked here with him.\n\n"}}
