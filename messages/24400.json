So hard in fact a small\n&gt; landslide occured because of the echo. Aerostreak and Waspinator joined in\n&gt; the humor as well.\n&gt;     &quot;You stupid idiot, who do you think youre dealing with?&quot; Megatron\nsaid,\n&gt; and snapped his arm cannon into fireing position. &quot;I suggest you\nsurrender,\n&gt; or die in this artic hell hole. You could be a very valuable asset to the\n&gt; Predacon team. Your large, strong, well armed, and Im assuming you must be\n&gt; somewhat intelligent to even think about trying to usurp me.&quot;\n&gt;     Waspinator and Aerostreak raised thier weapons as well, armed for\nkilling\n&gt; the imposter.\n&gt;     &quot;So, what do you say?
