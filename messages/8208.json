But that didn&#39;t matter.  She was \nenjoying the moment.  She knew that they were supposed to be having a \nmore physical fighting match between them.  But she knew that she was \nno match for him physically.  He was stronger than her pure and \nsimple.  She wasn&#39;t build for fighting and she knew it.  So she had \nto out think him as opposed to trying to out mucsle him. \n\nShe saw him run into the cave.  She swooped down and transformed into \nbot mode.  She kept her sachel on her shoulder and looked around.  He \nwas inside the cave, but that didn&#39;t mean that she would follow him.\n\nShe climbed up to the roof of the cave and stood on top of the \nopening.  She layed down and hung her head down to \nyell. &quot;HHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \nIIIIINNNNNN THEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRREEEEEEEEE!&quot;\nShe got up and jumpd back a few feet just incase he tried to grab her \nand pull her down.  She hoped he heard her well enough.\n\n\n"}}
