Then she shot \nupright then \n&gt; &gt;&gt; gasped as though coming up for air like a human \nunderwater too long.

Then glanced at \nher damaged \n&gt; &gt; body; it looked horrific. She still felt low on power/weak. She \nhated the \n&gt; &gt; feeling. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Opening her internal com, though somewhat damaged, \n&quot;Perceptor.... I need \n&gt; &gt; your... assistance.... immediately,&quot; she stated softly. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As she waited for Perceptor, her optics then noticed Hydras \nnearby. It \n&gt; &gt; calmed her lasercore to know he was still functioning. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Her power low, feeling rather odd. Must have been the organic \nside of her. \n&gt; \n&gt; She then sank back into the tank & went offline/unconscious \nagain. Resting, \n&gt; allowing the healing to continue. Hopefully. Some parts of her \nwere not \n&gt; wanting to repair/heal.\n\n\n"}}
