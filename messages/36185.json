Not above ground, but below it. Deep inside the planet \n&gt; in a large military installation large ships are being built day in and day \n&gt; out, preparing for the day in which they may need to defend the final \n&gt; X-Predacon safe place from the Infecticons. On another part of the planet a \n&gt; large ship sits, with X-Predacon troops all around it. Inside it, \n&gt; scientists stand around working on a massive machine that makes up \n&gt; approximately one half of the ship. As they do the X-Predacon leader stands \n&gt; behind them waiting paitiently for their report. Finally one of the \n&gt; scientists walks up to him and salutes him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scientist: &quot;Sir, we have finished the device. With it this ship will be \n&gt; able to warp to any place in the universe during any time period. Might I \n&gt; add you also made us place three times the firepower on this ship then you \n&gt; do with other ships this size. Im suprised theres still room for the crew \n&gt; and the Vile Pods...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;Who cares what you think!? Now that you have finished with the \n&gt; device I want you and everyone else&#39;s monkey skid plates off this ship in \n&gt; five minutes before I lay the smack down on you!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The scientist nods and begins to step away slowly from the leader before \n&gt; the leader transforms into a hand and slams down onto the scientist. With \n&gt; the scientist pinned between its fingers the robotic hand fligns him into a \n&gt; wall with a sickeding thud before two finger tips are sent at the scientist \n&gt; blowing him to tiny bits. The hand then transforms into robot mode as the \n&gt; other scientists just move back and away from him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gigatron: &quot;Why are you standing there you jabronies!? Get your monkey skid \n&gt; plates off this damn ship before I lay the smacketh down on you too!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that all of the scientists all run out of the room and in a matter of \n&gt; minutes the ship is empty aside from Gigatron and the Vile Force.  Gigatron \n&gt; walks back and forth infront of the Vile Force before he stands in front of \n&gt; them again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gigatron: &quot;Now it is time for you jabronies to go back in time and layeth \n&gt; the smackdown on all those Preds and Maximals back on Prehistoric Earth \n&gt; before the timeline can be changed. I would go myself but I must lay the \n&gt; smackdown on these new guys that have invaded our Galaxy. This ship has a \n&gt; transwarp communicator so you will be able to contact this base at any \n&gt; time. Good luck.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Vile Force all nod and each member hits his chest quickly. Gigatron \n&gt; laughs and then leaves the ship as its systems power up. The door to the \n&gt; ship soon closes and the large ship rises into the sky and begins to glow. \n&gt; Inside the ships cockpit Vile stands infront of Gemini 2 and Methos, two \n&gt; members of the Vile Force and nods to them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vile: &quot;For Gigatron and our future!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elsewhere Skywarp and Cyanide stand infront of the massive Machine that \n&gt; will allow the ship to travel through time and space with ease. And still \n&gt; meanwhile in the cargo hold infront of a scorpion like machine, Gemini 1 \n&gt; and Destruction sit down playing poker. The cards begin to shake as the \n&gt; ship glows brighter in the sky lighting the ground below.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gemini 1: &quot;Here we go!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And just as that is said the ship dissapears from sight. Back in time, \n&gt; above the Destructocons and Predacons assaulting the trainers base, a \n&gt; massive portal opens, bright light falling onto the base itself and the men \n&gt; outside it.\n\n\n\r\n--part1_61.e942657.284ab8cb_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=arial,helvetica&gt;&lt;FONT  SIZE=2 FAMILY=&quot;SANSSERIF&quot; FACE=&quot;Arial&quot; LANG=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR=&quot;#000000&quot; SIZE=3 FAMILY=&quot;SERIF&quot; FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; LANG=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE TYPE=CITE style=&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #0000ff 2px solid; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 5px&quot;&gt;Braxus 2, the dark desolate world that is being used by the X-Predacons as \n&lt;BR&gt;their secret base.
