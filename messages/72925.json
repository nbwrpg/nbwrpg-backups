It&#39;s a long shot but i=\r\nt should&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; work.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t be envious of what you don=\r\n&#39;t have, be grateful for things you already&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; posses.  Nothing is wo=\r\nrth more than family and friends.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 2, 2012, at 4:35=\r\n PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;superc=\r\nyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson turns on Leo and stomps a powerful =\r\nfoot down on the ground.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Something had just snapped insid=\r\ne his directory yet he still keeps his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; composure.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; It isn&#39;t a matter of what the Predacon has t=\r\nold me, it was a matter of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; how&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; composed=\r\n they remained while helping us. Oh yes I kept that in the back&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; my mind Leo Prime, I kept that in the back of m=\r\ny mind. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He narrows his eyes with a wi=\r\nse expression.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I wondered why the all=\r\niance went as well as it did. I was sure to get&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; &gt; refusal but I didn&#39;t, and at first I thought nothing of it but t=\r\nhen I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; started thinking. How could this be? Oh yes for a g=\r\nrave price you get&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cooperation from a Predacon. Now you t=\r\nell me Leo, I&#39;m listening, how is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat this alliance happened so easily? I will take back what I said and&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt; &gt; things will be as they stand, with you in command of course. T=\r\nhe truth&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Leo,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; all I want IS THE TRUTH. =\r\nYou can tell me that can you?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He stand=\r\ns firm with a thrash of his tail.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LEO PRIME stood=\r\n there grinding his teeth, well he would if he had any&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in robo=\r\nt mode. He glared at TUSCON. &quot;Haven&#39;t you noticed that Hydras&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nisn&#39;t here, or Cyclonus or Scourge or any of the sweeps?&quot; LEO said,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; his voice calm but seething with his own anger. &quot;The Predacons come&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; for the same reason as we, to locate their missing comrades and=\r\n to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; find out what is at the bottom of this jungle. The same re=\r\nasons that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; they were ready to do so before.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; LEO paused for emphasis, &quot;There is no offer of any life for a life=\r\n for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; this mission, and if you claim to know what it is to be a=\r\n Prime then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; you would know that I would never sell someone&#39;s l=\r\nife for this.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as he spoke LEO kept silent o=\r\nn the matters closest to him, like&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the suspicion that the PRED=\r\nACONS did have some other agenda, some&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; other reason for being =\r\nhere. But it was not something he was willing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to give voice to=\r\n so close to finding out what was going on.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; For the moment, witnessing =\r\nthe seeming altercation of aggression&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; circuits&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; between LEO PRIME and TUSCON PRIME as DINOBOT went out of the tunne=\r\nl,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; flanking over towards SKY SHADOW with a look of.. AMUS=\r\nEMENT upon his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; faceplate, but remaining in silence.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Staying on inter-Predacon radio, which hopef=\r\nully at close range would&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; work&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; then, an=\r\nd not be audible to the MAXIMALS, and sending a signal to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n CRYOTEK.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;We seem to be restrained down here for now.=\r\n What are your orders then?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Press on or attempt to instig=\r\nate altercations within the MAXIMALS?&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Actually inside the caves radios were comple=\r\ntely out. However CRYOTEK&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; had made his way back to stand with =\r\nDINOBOT and SKYSHADOW. &quot;We may&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; need them before we get to the =\r\nend of this.&quot; CRYOTEK said&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; thoughtfully. &quot;This is obviously a =\r\ntrap of some sort and unfortunately&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; we seem to be caught withi=\r\nn it as much as the Maximals are.&quot; he said&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in a low voice.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; SKYSHADOW nodded, &quot;Unfortunately I have to agree.&quot;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; CRYOTEK glanced at DINOBOT, &quot;But go ahead and do w=\r\nhat you can to keep&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; them off balance. We can&#39;t have them ready=\r\n to turn against us too&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; soon.&quot; He grunted, &quot;Hydras has been ta=\r\nken from us, that seriously&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; changes the balance of power here.=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; The aerial Predacons up aboveground seemed to be cut off from them fo=\r\nr&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; now,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; who had not followed them underg=\r\nround (such as WASPINATOAR and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; BLACKARACHNIA).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; DRILL BIT had dug back underground once his bait =\r\nhad been laid, digging&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; underneath. VICE GRIP remained at =\r\nhte rear of the tunnel, still cloaked,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and attempting to =\r\n(and most likely failing) to scan whatever had&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; seemingly&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cut off the tunnel back to the surface.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Active sensors are down here=\r\n inside the cave, however vibrations can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; be sensed by DRILLBIT=\r\n, vibrations that center roughly about in the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; entrance chamber=\r\n where they first entered into the caves. Vibrations&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; were very=\r\n familiar to DRILL BIT and but centered on that entrance way&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; b=\r\nut spreading out to affect even the tunnels he was digging. . .&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even above the rest of the MAXIMALS and PREDACONS began to f=\r\neel a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; rumble and then a shaking, the rumbling quickly being fe=\r\nlt down the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; paths to where the rest of the MAXIMALS and the PR=\r\nEDACONS stood.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyone who had ever had any experience inside o=\r\nf caves or in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; underground setting knew what they were feeling.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The opening tremors for a CAVE IN!!!!!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The walls began to shake as stone and rocks began to fall.=\r\n The&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; apparent only way to safety lay in further into the caves=\r\n themselves,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; since, strangely enough, it was the cave through =\r\nwhich most of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; MAXIMALS and PREDACON had entered this place=\r\n was from where it seemed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to be extending from.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It was like they were being pushed or herded forward!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-E0EEAEA0-A88D-4302-85F6-9B40CF7E904F--\r\n\n"}}
