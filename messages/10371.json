Posts are ussually slow during the weekend, its no big \ndeal.\n\n::Mosquitor::\n\nThe CR chamber opens, a foot emerging. It sets itself on the ground, along \nwith it&#39;s owner&#39;s other foot, as Mosquitor steps out. Mosquitor looks around, \na bit dazed. For a second, he thought he was standing upside down inside \nsomeone&#39;s head, but that thought vanished as soon as he looked back at the CR \nchambers. As far as he knew, bots&#39; heads did not contain CR chambers. But \nother places did....\n\nMosquitor frowns, thinking of all the places that could have CR chambers. \nShoes? No, those wern&#39;t big enough. Maybe guns! He looks down at his gun, \nfinally deciding it was too small to hold a CR chamber.\n\nHe frowns again. It was nagging at him, the place that has CR chambers, but \nhe couldn&#39;t put his finger on it. It started with a &#39;B&#39;... Bugs? No. \nMosquitor shakes his head, deep in thought over this complicated problem. \nBooms? No, that was a sound, sounds can&#39;t hold objects, and CR chambers were \nan object. Bats? Mosquitor grinds his teeth in frustration. That was close, \nbut no.\n\nHis eyes light up as the answer hits him. BASE! Yes, that was it! He must be \nin the Predacon base! In the CR room! A smile stretches across Mosquitor&#39;s \nface as the idiot bug walks out of the room, proud of his brilliant deducing \nskills.\n\n"}}
