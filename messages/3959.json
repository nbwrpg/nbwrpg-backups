He goes over to see that he has finaly reached the \nMaximals. He looks over and sees many of them fighting one giant bot. \nIt is giving of a strange energy signal. Not Pred and not Maximal. \n\n&quot;This must be the alliance they told us about,&quot; thought \nOctociz, &quot;Well I won&#39;t stand for it. I won&#39;t see Maximals hurt. That \none dinosaur bot over there is probably going to sacrifice it&#39;s self. \nWell, it&#39;s time for me to show my Maximal colors!&quot;\n\nOctociz transforms to Beast Mode. He pulls out his 2 blasters and \ngets his ink shooters ready. He made need them to rust up his parts. \nOctociz runs and starts opening fire on the large bot.\n\n\n"}}
