Usually he&#39;s Brix, \nfaithful Maximal. But when he gets caught up in battle, he becomes \nthe renegade Bronco, who will kill anyone he wants. He is especially \nmad at Fliq because Fliq brought Brix back to life, leaving Bronco \nusually in the subconcious. And you forgot Fliq&#39;s attack on Oinker, \nbut I&#39;ll post a new one.&quot;)\n\nFliq&#39;s plasma shots went wide. He stared down at Oinker, who hadn&#39;t \nnoticed him yet. Good, he thought, still with surprise on my side. He \nactivated his chainsaw, and was about to go straight at him, when two \nmissles flew by him, he saw that it was Brix!\n\n&quot;Brix! What are you....&quot; and than in a whisper he added, &quot;Bronco.&quot;\n\nHe fired a wide shots off from his plasma cannons and than turned \nback to Oinker.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t deal with him Bronco now. I need to defeat this bot!&quot;\n\nFliq turned on his chainsaw and charged Oinker from above.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Bronco dodgen the plasma shots easily.\n\n&quot;Is that the best you can do?!? Let&#39;s go!!!&quot;\n\nBronco charges towards Fliq.\n\n\n"}}
