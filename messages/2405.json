She then turned her head and saw that Killer was knocked unconscious, a small growl/sigh escapes her lips as her muscles relax a bit.\nIron Raptor looked at Prowl again but then straight ahead. With a silent command she transformed into her robot mode, she staggered a bit at the quick transformation but then steadied. Back in her armored mode she walked a little closer to Prowl, out of breath from the strain needed to maintain her Second Beast Mode. She was breathing hard and looking tired, the damage acquired from her SBM still showed a bit in her robot mode. Her entire back was almost ripped up and covered in mech fluid and her cheek was bleeding, it wasn&#39;t the best she&#39;d ever looked before but it wasn&#39;t the worst.\nIron Raptor walked up to Prowl with a tired but regretful look on her face, she contacted his wounded stomach with her figures but so gently that they barely touched. She had helped cause those damages, hitting him and knocking him down so that Annihalator could take advantage of it and fire at him. It hurt her to know this.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;\n\n* She said in a quiet voice as she looked at his dented chest too, they were both damaged and hurt but the fact that she had harmed Prowl hurt more then any gunfire could. She avoided optic contact with Prowl for fear that he would glare at her and hate her for what she had done, of course it was an accident but it had still happened.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
