He glances at \nSpears as he passes her, shoving her roughly aside so he can get \nthrough. He growls, looking at her as he passes, his red optics \nsettling back on Prebon as he turns his head away.\n\n&quot;Who is that femm, Master?&quot; he asks Prebon, a surge of something \nclose to hatred going through him.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; (I know that no one knows how the Pred gouvernement works. But what \n&gt; I&#39;m saying is that Dachande made a link between the two RPG&#39;s, and \n&gt; when that happens what happens in one affects the other. In the Neo \n&gt; Beast Machines, the Pred gouvernment is ruled by one King named \n&gt; Archon. That has too affect the Neo Beast Wars. I personally think \n&gt; that Dachande should have made it a separte RPG, but that was his \n&gt; decision. Thye only thin we can do is have everyone vote against it \n&gt; and make Dachande re-start his RPG has a seperate entity, or have \n&gt; everyone follow what goes on in the NBM so that they can relate it \nin \n&gt; the posts.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream laughed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thank You Zardus. The new breed of Predacons will not forget your \n&gt; generosity, and will pay you back once the Maximals and Megatron \nare \n&gt; out of the way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to the Lavacons.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am Starscream, former ruler of the Decepticons and member of the \n&gt; newest faction of Predacons, commanded under KitKat. Please hold on \n&gt; one minute while I contact my group and than we will go.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He sent a comm:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. Zardus isn&#39;t letting us take the \n&gt; Oblitercons, but he&#39;s letting us use the Lavacons, a group that by \n&gt; the looks of things is stronger than the Oblitercons. We are about \nto \n&gt; leave now, but we need your co-ordinates.&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois noticed that the firing had stopped. It was either they gave \n&gt; up on firing or are entering the mountain. It would be foolish to \ndo \n&gt; so, but better think the foolish thing when dealing with fools.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;One of you three, stay in the back and wipe away our tracks. When \nwe \n&gt; get to the main base their are 4 more warriors waiting. We&#39;ll get \n&gt; them and than attack this enemy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He kept walking.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon frowned.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Too bad....I was hoping for you to tell me everything you knew \nabout \n&gt; your past life. It might help us know the secrets of our enemy \n&gt; better.&quot; He saw Spears emerge from the CR Chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Spears! Great! Looks like we can take everyone to battle after \nall. \n&gt; I&#39;d like you to meet Slayer, our new Trainer. He is the protoform \nof \n&gt; your friend....&quot; Than Prebon eralized something. He needed to stop \n&gt; talking about the past. Slayer did not have a chip, meaning that \neven \n&gt; though he was loyal now, the future could change. If Slayer got \n&gt; curious, he might sneak away to the Maximals. They would reveal his \n&gt; old personality and when tell all Trainer secrets.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Never mind who he is. No one will ever talk of the past again. \n&gt; Understand? Good. Spears, I really have no mission right now. Soon \nwe \n&gt; will go into battle. We will gang up on Ramulus and kill him. Right \n&gt; now though, Slayer, come with me. I want you try on a War Suit that \n&gt; will help you fight.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon started walking down to the cargo area.\n\n\n"}}
