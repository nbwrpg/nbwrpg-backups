Collateral? I don&#39;t think so.&quot;\n\n* She looked at Battera for a moment longer before standing and brushing \nherself off.*\n\n&quot; Maximals only take prisoners of war...not Peace Talks. You&#39;ll be coming \nwith us.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then looked towards the projector that stood behind Prowl and \nKluster, her blue optics reflecting her concern for her two missing \nMaximals. Her expressing taking on a zoned out quality.\nShe was worried about them, deeply worried.\nFor all she knew, they could be completely scrapped and on the verge of \ndeath. Something that she didn&#39;t want to think of...but was definetly \npossable.*\n\n&quot; But, I have some important things to worry about right now.&quot;\n\n* She continued to stare off into thought for a few more moments, her tone \nindicating that perhaps it was in the wiser to let her get back down to \nbuisness before she left.\nThere was a lot on her mind and she had to sort through it before she would \nallow herself to be lead to the Embassy, and a few precautions to be taken \ncare of as well.*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
