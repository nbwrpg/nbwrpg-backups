She looks aro=\r\nund quickly and realizes the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; terrain was full of trees that may be dam=\r\naged but were still stable \n&gt; &gt;&gt; enough\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to hold her weight. She jumps =\r\nup to catch a hanging branch and like a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; skilled acrobat, she manages t=\r\no swing herself up higher into the trees.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From there, she could see a =\r\nlarge branch severely cracked, hanging right\n&gt; &gt;&gt; over Dark Rodimus&#39;s head.=\r\n She then spots a large tree root at the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; edge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of what looked lik=\r\ne a tar pool. How convenient was that? And she \n&gt; &gt;&gt; certainly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was fas=\r\nt enough to dart out of the way if she had to.

She raises=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; brow, aims her arm launcher and fires at the crack in the branch. S=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt;&gt; hits\n&gt; &gt;&gt; her target as the branch cracks loudly and detaches from=\r\n the damaged tree\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with a loud creaking noise.

Like him, the sight of Da=\r\nrk Rodimus was enough to &lt;br&gt;\ndim her trust in the real Rodimus Prime as sh=\r\ne remembers what had happened &lt;br&gt;\nto him in the past.  She opens a com lin=\r\nk to Tucson directly.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; Tucson, it&#39;s me, look, I think ya might ha=\r\nve ta take leadership privileges &lt;br&gt;\naway from Rodimus.

In the mean time, Rodimus has &lt;br&gt;\nfallen back i=\r\nnto evil hands and I think it&#39;s best if he is barred from &lt;br&gt;\nleadership d=\r\nuties until further notice.  I don&#39;t like being this harsh, but &lt;br&gt;\nright =\r\nnow he can&#39;t be trusted.  Tell Bump to secure Nightlight in the med &lt;br&gt;\nba=\r\ny and put the Ark in immediate lockdown.

She looks around quickly and realizes the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; terrain=\r\n was full of trees that may be damaged but were still stable &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nenough&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to hold her weight.  She jumps up to catch a hanging br=\r\nanch and like a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; skilled acrobat, she manages to swing herself =\r\nup higher into the trees.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From there, she could see a large br=\r\nanch severely cracked, hanging right&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; over Dark Rodimus&#39;s head.=\r\n     She then spots a large tree root at the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; edge&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n; of what looked like a tar pool.  How convenient was that?  And she &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt; certainly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; was fast enough to dart out of the way if sh=\r\ne had to.  But if she could &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; only&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; break that bran=\r\nch without falling out of the tree herself.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Hmm=\r\nm...  He&#39;s right, we typically are kinda predictable..  So why not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; try&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; something original?  Now how deep is that crack?&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; She examines the crack in the branch.

She hoped her fir=\r\nst plan of attack would &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; work.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Phase two would al=\r\nso prove difficult as she waits to see how the chips &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; fall,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; literally.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Timber..&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW =E2=80=93 Dark Rodimus&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: Reme=\r\nmber, I said the figure stepped into a clearing.
