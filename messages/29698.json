But it was his job to push buttons until he got the \nreaction he was looking for, and to see where Perndabot snapped was just \nthat sort of reaction.\nHe glanced down towards Nue&#39;e when Perndabot reacted to her, lifting a brow, \nrealizing what she&#39;d said before just now and giving Swift a side long \nclance.\nNue&#39;e let go of Perndabot&#39;s finger after he had reacted to her, giving \nBiomass that look again and getting a look back that told her not to worry. \nShe only sighed.\n&lt; Must be the new body.&gt;\nBiomass, narrowed his optics when he heard Perndabot&#39;s comeback, not feeling \ninsulted but knowing that he wasn;t going to leave what he said without a \nresponce. However, he could use the need to get to the Iron Fist as an \nexcuse to push this man just a little further before he placed him under his \nconcern and ignored him.\nBiomass&#39;s expression turned aggressive.*\n\n&quot; You have a striking point there. So, I&#39;ll leave you women to your \nammuseMENTS!&quot; on the last word Biomass  struck to check his shoulder-plate \nhard against Perndabot&#39;s arm as he passed by, the force enough to knock even \na bot Perndabot&#39;s size to the ground.\nBiomass, on the other hand, continued walking towards the Iron Fist, leaving \nNue&#39;e to stand by Perndabot and stare at him in complete disbeliefe.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
