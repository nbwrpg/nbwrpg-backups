He ejected DrillBit \nand than transformed to bot mode. He looked KitKat over, and when the \ncockpit landed he explained.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s hurt badly. The fall has caused massived damage to her nervous \ncircutry. She&#39;ll probably live, but she might need extensive surgery \nto walk again, maybe even to go from bot to beast. I don&#39;t know if we \nhave those tools, and if we did they were probably in the cave. We&#39;re \nbaseless, equipment less, and if we don&#39;t do something soon she may \nnever move again. What can we do?&quot;\n\nStarscream heard her mumble something about Phobia being on the ship.\n\n&quot;Phobia&#39;s still there! Look after her, I&#39;ll be back in a sec.&quot;\n\nStarscream picked up his Cockpit, placed it back, turned to Jet Mode \nand took off towards the ship to rescue Phobia. Starscream estimated \nhe had a minute before the ship hit the ground, which might set off \nanother reaction. If Phobia was still inside when it hit the ground, \nshe would die. He slipped in the escape hatch, but the fire was all \naround he couldn&#39;t see anything. He started calling.\n\n&quot;Phobia? Phobia, can you here me?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
