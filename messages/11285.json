C ya all \nin 10 days, or if I get on a comp before that.\n\n::Zardus/Prowl/DevilDuer/Ramulus/DeathScythe/Mosquitor/Shredder::\n\nZardus leans back from the femm he had been reprogramming, his arm starting \nto shimmer. It was happening again, he could feel it. He frowns, turning back \nand typing a few commands on a console. A stasis field emerges over the femm, \nkeeping her in stasis untill a command from him would disable it. He \nactivates his comm-link on a secure channel to all Alliance members other \nthan Feline and Skulletron, who were in the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n&quot;Everyone,&quot; he says into it, &quot;I&#39;ll be gone for a few days. Nemesis Enforcer \nis in charge untill I return. Feline and Skulletron will return soon wearing \nMaximal symbols, don&#39;t open fire. They&#39;ll have interesting information.&quot;\n\nWith a flash, Zardus dissapears, to return in a few days.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl blinks, looking down at himself as he turns partly transparent. Prowl \nlooks back at Iron Raptor. He was reluctant to leave her, but he had no real \nchoice.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be back in a few days, love,&quot; he says to her, quickly kissing her \nbefore he dissapears.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn front of the pod, DevilDuer looks at the new bot. &quot;Hello, I&#39;m DevilDuer,&quot; \nhe says to the bot, &quot;Who are you?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus frowns as his feet pass through a bush, noticing that he was \nshimmering. He sighs. Here it comes again. With a flash, he dissapears, as \ndoes DeathScythe above.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWithout warning, Mosquitor&#39;s stupidity causes him to be phazed out from the \ndimention for a few days to fix some bugs with his brain and make him at \nleast be able to solve 2 + 2.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWalking alongside Mantella, Shredder suddenly falls to his knees, starting to \nshimmer. He groans as he dissapears with a flash. He hated these small \nphazings, but they were unavoidable.\n\n"}}
