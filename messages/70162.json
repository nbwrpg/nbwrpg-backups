At last, he finally knocked some=\r\n sense into him.  He follows his comrade&#39;s signature until he arrives at hi=\r\ns side.  \n\n&quot;About time you listened to reason.  Welcome back.  Oh, by the w=\r\nay, be prepared, Nightshift and Rat Trap may not be so accepting upon your =\r\nreturn. Anyway, we have to find Nightlight and Darkhawk, who is really Wind=\r\nlord.  I suggest you find Nightlight, I find Windlord and we get the pit ou=\r\nt of here as fast as we can.  If we get separated, meet me outside the fort=\r\nress by the front fascade, you&#39;ll know who to look for, big, silver missile=\r\n truck, that&#39;s me.&quot;  \n\nOutside Rat Trap gets the com link.  And as Tucson P=\r\nrime would have suspected, he blows his stack, upon hearing Rodimus&#39;s words=\r\n.\n\n&quot;Grrrrrr!  WHERE THE PIT HAVE YA BEEN ALL THIS TIME SPEEDY HUH?!  WORKN&#39;=\r\n FOR HYDRAS WERE WE?!  ABOUT SLAGGN&#39; TIME YA SNAPPED OUTA YOUR LITTLE TRANC=\r\nE PAL! AND BY THE WAY, I&#39;M MAD BECAUSE YOU HAD THE NERVE TA SLAG WHEELS WHE=\r\nN HE WAS JUST TRYN&#39; TA HELP YA! SOME FRIEND YOU&#39;RE TURN&#39;N OUT TA BE!  C&#39;mon=\r\n Quickstride, let&#39;s get back ta the ark.  I feel better now that I blew off=\r\n some much needed steam.&quot;\n\nTucson could hear Rat Trap through his com link.=\r\n  He glances back to Rodimus one last time.\n\n&quot; Err, I&#39;ll - see what I can d=\r\no to resolve this little issue.. Like I said, it could take some time.&quot;\n\nHe=\r\n then opens his com link to Rat Trap.\n\n&quot;Rat Trap, it&#39;s me, Tucson Prime, I&#39;=\r\nm all right little guy, and believe it or not, Rodimus is responsible for m=\r\ny jailbreak.  We&#39;ll see you guys soon, okay?\n\nRat Trap responds.\n\n&quot; You got=\r\n it Wheels, I almost thought you were done for.&quot;\n\nIn his cell, Nightshift j=\r\noins up with Kup, and gets Rodimus&#39;s com link too.  Like Rat Trap, he also =\r\nshows some signs of being a slight displeased about his recent alliance wit=\r\nh Hydras.\n\n&quot; I wonder how long this is gonna last before he falls for anoth=\r\ner one of Hydra&#39;s scemes?  I dunno about you Kup, but as far as I&#39;m concern=\r\ned, Tucson Prime&#39;s my leader.  This whole thing about Rodimus, still creeps=\r\n me out.&quot;\n\nHe replies to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Nightshift here, I got the memmo. But u=\r\nnless you want me ta be cool with ya, ya gotta prove ta us that ya ain&#39;t go=\r\nnna slip through the cracks again, and is this some sorta trick ta put us d=\r\nown even deeper?  I dunno Rodimus, but after this, I kinda don&#39;t trust ya. =\r\n I&#39;ll do as told, I ain&#39;t gonna disobey, but I&#39;m gonna run those orders thr=\r\nough Tucson Prime first, since he&#39;s been able ta resist this slag ball&#39;s sc=\r\nheme with no problem.  He never quit on you and I ain&#39;t never gonna quit on=\r\n him.  This is Nightshift, peace out.&quot;\n\nHe replies his last phrase with a c=\r\nool tone of voice.\n\n&quot;Yeah right, two years he serves Hydras, and all of a s=\r\nudden he&#39;s all high&#39;n mighty again.  Yo, Tucson Prime, Nightshift here, wha=\r\nt&#39;s the next phase of the plan?&quot;\n\nTucson catches Nightshift&#39;s com link.\n\n&quot;N=\r\nightlight and Windlord still need to be recovered.  Windlord goes by the na=\r\nme of Darkhawk, and it may be difficult to snap him out of his shell progra=\r\nm.  I suggest you proceede with caution, and if you find Darkhawk before I =\r\ndo, contact me.  Don&#39;t try to handle him yourself, he may be rather crafty.=\r\n&quot;\n\nNightshift nodds.\n\n&quot;Gotchya.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime senses a cool tone in his co=\r\nmrade&#39;s voice.\n\n&quot;Nightshift, are you all right? You seem a bit disturbed.&quot;\n=\r\n\nNightshift replies.\n\n&quot; I dunno sir, I hate ta say this but I dunno if I ca=\r\nn trust Rodimus after two years of him workn&#39; for the enemy.  I can&#39;t trust=\r\n someone who&#39;s turned his back on his faction, it just ain&#39;t right.  And no=\r\nw he acts all high&#39;n mighty.  What next?  He&#39;s gonna turn his spoiler on us=\r\n &#39;n really slag us good?&quot;\n\nTucson Prime sighs.\n\n&quot;I was afraid of this.  Our=\r\n return to the Ark is going to be a rocky one. I think a conference will be=\r\n in order once we get back.  One between all of us.  I know what you&#39;re fee=\r\nling and I can&#39;t blame you for your apprehensions, and neither can I blame =\r\nRat Trap for his. I too wonder why and how, but we have to get past this an=\r\nd at least try to rebuild our alliance with Rodimus who is now trying hard =\r\nto redeem himself.&quot;\n\nNight Shift replies.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ll try.  But don&#39;t expect mi=\r\nracles.&quot;\n\nTucson smiles gently.\n\n&quot;Thanks Nightshift.  I appreciate it.  Now=\r\n, do you have any stasis cuffs available?&quot;\n\nNight Shift takes inventory of =\r\nhis restaint supplies.\n\n&quot;One pair.&quot;\n\nTucson looks in his possession as well=\r\n.\n\n&quot; Same here.  All right, actually if you do find Darkhawk, try and get t=\r\nhe cuffs on him if you can.  But don&#39;t harm him.&quot;\n\nNight Shift salutes.\n\n&quot;C=\r\nopy that, Peace out Tucson Prime.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s not long before Nightshift goes to=\r\n his duties, as Tucson Prime reaches Kup.\n\n&quot; Kup, I know you&#39;re good at kee=\r\nping the peace.  I have a feeling Rat Trap and Night Shift are still a bit =\r\nsteamed off at Rodimus.  You have my permission to break up any squabbles t=\r\nhat might ensue between them.&quot;\n\nWith his last instruction, Tucson Prime car=\r\nries out his part of the mission. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly20=\r\n02@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras/Darkhawk/nightlight:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nighlight woke up sc=\r\nared, the alarms was ranging and she doesnt knew what \n&gt; was goin on now.
