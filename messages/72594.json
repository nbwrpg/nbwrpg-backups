Now if I had a draft horse\n&gt;&gt; frame then I&#39;d be in the clear but I don&#39;t .  &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He then glances over at the tracks on the ground.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Wow, if ya look at the tracks, you can see how Tucson was attempting to\n&gt;&gt; use  some fancy footwork ta try and ward off his attacker.  There&#39;s some\n&gt;&gt; big\n&gt;&gt; gaps in his prints which indicates a bit of acrobatics were at play\n&gt;&gt; here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rattrap studies the tracks further.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Yep he was off the ground a few times, I can tell.
