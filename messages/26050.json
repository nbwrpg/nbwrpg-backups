I don&#39;t think I sent it in attachment form \n=), \n&gt; do all of my messages come like that? About a quarter or less of \n&gt; the messages I get say attachment but open as a normal \n&gt; message, i was just ignoring the attachment mark. Also do Killfest, \n&gt; EndBringer, Demise, and Greven fly? I think i know why it came as \n&gt; an attachement, i was doing some tests and if i change the bold, \n&gt; italics, and underline settings it changes my test into an \n&gt; attachment.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Astroblast thinks for a moment, taking in all of that information, \n&gt; &quot;Your information is useful, and to continue with this I think that \n&gt; Motormaster must be here. Besides, you haven&#39;t met him yet.&quot; He \n&gt; then turns away, opens a comlink to Motormaster, and says, \n&gt; &quot;Motormaster, your presence is requested at the following \n&gt; coordinates ......., where are you now?&quot; Then he turns back to \n&gt; Killfest, &quot;Alright, while we wait for Motormaster&#39;s response, what \n&gt; faction appears to be the strongest right now?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 21 Jan 2001, at 7:30, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Astroblast is ok, rAuq, but please don&#39;t send posts as email \n&gt; &gt; attachments next time (you might not have sent it as an email \n&gt; &gt; attachment, but eGroups could have mistaken it for one or \nsomething).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Killfest::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Killfest nods, opening his mouth to answer Astroblast&#39;s questions \nas \n&gt; &gt; the bot asks them, but interrupted every time by a new question. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; finally closes his mouth, waiting for Astroblast to talk himself \nout. \n&gt; &gt; When the bot finishes, Killfest replies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Base locations, numbers, and other recorded info can be found \nback \n&gt; &gt; at base,&quot; he says, stretching out a hand, palm up. &quot;I can, \nhowever, \n&gt; &gt; give you a slight overview of the locations, and the numbers of \n&gt; &gt; Predacon troops.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His palm lights up in several locations, a hologram of Earth \napearing \n&gt; &gt; below it. &quot;This is prehistoric earth, as you had said. There are \n&gt; &gt; roughly half a dozen major factions existing on the planet, some \n&gt; &gt; stronger than others.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The hologram of earth spins, showing a volcano in Greece. &quot;First \nof \n&gt; &gt; all, this is the base of my faction of the Predacons. Three \ngroups, \n&gt; &gt; led by me, DrillBit, and Darkfate, are allied and reside in this \n&gt; &gt; base. The other faction of Predacons is led by Megatron, and \ntheir \n&gt; &gt; base is located in the arctics.&quot; The hologram spins again, \nshowing \n&gt; &gt; the location of Megatron&#39;s base.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;The two factions closest to being Predacon are the Destrons and \nthe \n&gt; &gt; Alliance.&quot; Killfest was now reciting what he had read from the \n&gt; &gt; computer at the Council base before it was destroyed, and he \nhoped \n&gt; &gt; the information was accurate. &quot;The Destron base is located \nroughly on \n&gt; &gt; the other side of the planet from us, on a different continuent.&quot; \nHis \n&gt; &gt; hologram once again spins, showing what would one day be called \nMt. \n&gt; &gt; Katahdin, located in northern Maine. &quot;The Alliance base is \nlocated \n&gt; &gt; quite a bit closer, on the same continuent as us.&quot; Now the \nhologram \n&gt; &gt; spins to show an island three miles off of the south coast of \n&gt; &gt; Spain. &quot;Last, and quite possibly least, are the Maximals. Their \nbase \n&gt; &gt; is located in the continent south of us, on the western part of \nthat \n&gt; &gt; continuent.&quot; The hologram spins to show the deserts of Africa, \n&gt; &gt; highliting a spot on the west side of it. Killfest turns the \nhologram \n&gt; &gt; off. &quot;To the best of my knowledge, the other factions don&#39;t have \na \n&gt; &gt; fixed base, but they&#39;re there. For the numbers, we&#39;d have to \nreturn \n&gt; &gt; to base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He pauses, waiting for questions from Astroblast.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
