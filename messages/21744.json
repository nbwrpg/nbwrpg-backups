He \n&gt; looked her in the eyes, &quot;With our reputation in combat I&#39;m sure \nwe&#39;ll \n&gt; be saving each others hides more often.\n&gt; \n&gt; Foxfingers shook her hand. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure.&quot; he said, still in a \nbit \n&gt; of a shock from being moved. His thoughts were as quick as his \nescape \n&gt; routs as one thought told him &quot;Leave me alone wench&quot; and then &quot;I \nlove \n&gt; a dominant creature.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Foxfingers quickly sidestepped her making an excuse as he \n&gt; did. &quot;Excuse me Ice, I must go um, help Veratis with the DNA.&quot; He \n&gt; scampered off toward the lab thinking &quot;Who&#39;s that mutant beast \nthink \n&gt; she is picking me up like that. Although I&#39;ll be sure she&#39;s around \n&gt; next time I need a lockpick.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine transformed to bot mode and stepped forward. &quot;Good to \nhave \n&gt; you back.&quot; His thoughts told his true feelings &quot;I&#39;ve missed you, I \n&gt; was afraid for what I&#39;d gotten you into.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
