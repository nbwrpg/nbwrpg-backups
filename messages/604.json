She turned a\n&gt; corner in the hall and walked towards the door that entered into the\nweapons\n&gt; room, she had fought alongside that fembot almost from the beginning and\nshe\n&gt; thought that she did just fine.\n&gt; Iron Raptor entered into the room and looked over the racks and piles of\n&gt; weapons, she lifted a semi-automatic flame thrower and looked it over. It\n&gt; was a good weapon but not the one in which she was looking for, she set it\n&gt; down and lifted up a duel-shock missal launcher. She hefted it and felt\nit&#39;s\n&gt; weight, it fit her perfectly.\n&gt; Iron Raptor smiled and put the launcher away in one of her back\n&gt; compartments, now it was time to get to the island&#39;s borders.\n&gt; She snarled, this battle may be a tough battle and they would need all of\n&gt; the bot&#39;s they could get. This was no time to let Plintissa run off!\n&gt; Iron Raptor opened her comlink to Plintissa&#39;s frequencies she exited the\n&gt; room and headed for the bridge...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Iron Raptor to Plintissa, come in. It&#39;s about time that you returned to\n&gt; base, there&#39;s been the orders to head to the island&#39;s borders and prepare\nto\n&gt; be attacked. I want you there as well. Iron Raptor out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She hoped that Plintissa would change her mind and fight this battle\nwith\n&gt; them, but she didn&#39;t have to much time to waste on that matter when a\nbattle\n&gt; threatened. After all, it was up to Plintissa, not her.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Get 3 months FREE and a chance to WIN a trip to London, England when\n&gt; you receive, manage and pay your bills online with Paytrust.com!\n&gt; Stamps, checks and bills in your mailbox are history.
