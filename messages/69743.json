Kraftlos described it a bit in Message #69458, and of course Tuscon =\r\nleft on his mission to the black fortress from there, so you should be fami=\r\nliar with it already :) Just don&#39;t forget the huge two headed dragon floati=\r\nng above it. So far it has not attacked. \n&gt; \n&gt; Since this is Kraftlos&#39; show=\r\n over there, you might want to get with him as well if you have any questio=\r\nns. I will help as I can :)\n&gt; \n&gt; The Ark of course looks much like it did i=\r\nn the old 80&#39;s cartoon, except that you have Autobots and Decepticons layin=\r\ng around inside it . . . much like the description I gave for Quickstride&#39;s=\r\n benefit. Also there is a force field which Lord Elder or Kup can lower to =\r\nlet Tuscon in.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this is helpful?\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
