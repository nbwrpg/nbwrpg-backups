Now it was his turn.\n&gt; He wasn&#39;t that into it. After she threw another into the air, he waited\n&gt; until it was a few inches from the ground, then he fired. The rock split\n&gt; into two, and pieces shattered from the side as they both hit the ground.\nIt\n&gt; wasn&#39;t his best, but it wasn&#39;t a real enemy. He was used to fighting with\n&gt; other bots, even to spar with.\n&gt;\n&gt; He wanted to do something to entertain himself. KitKat kept him occupied.\nAt\n&gt; least she tried for conversation. He grin appeared on his mouth plate. &quot;Ah\n&gt; gotta idea, let&#39; give Sinester and Sinesis uh nickname.
