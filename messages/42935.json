The attacks\nalready got people panicing and that makes the action that much more\neffective. I spent an hour in line at the gas station yesterday to fill up\nmy tank before the prices went up and guess what, when I got off work this\nmorning the stations had no waiting line and the prices went DOWN two cents.\nPlease respond and let me know if it&#39;s the same wherever you people are. The\nterrorists ground everything to a halt for a day, I know it&#39;s just one day\nbut still when factories are huddled around the TV or radio instead of\nproducing (I&#39;ll use the auto industry as an example) The auto industry makes\nthousands of cars a day,  minus one day cuts back the production, cuts back\nprofit, raises the price to make up for it. The drop of production hurts the\nbusiness men and the business men are what brings the majority of order to\nthis country. Almost Every country in the world claims to be willing to back\nthe USA in retaliation, I hope they stand by thier claim and send all the\nhelp they can.\n\nAs for the plague, My cousins stationed in Virginia and said they&#39;re getting\nshots for all kinds of wierd things including Anthrax, almost makes you\nwonder what types of weapons the US has ready for use.\n\nOn todays radio they said that 1,800 people died in the attack on Pearl\nharbour, Each tower had a minimum of 10,000 people that worked there that\nplus 300+ firemen plus the 800+ at the Pentagon + Pensylvania makes this a\nhell of alot worse than Pearl Harbor\n\nThe U.S. will hunt\ndown those responsible, and bring them to justice.\n\nand\n\n there\nwill be no distinction between the guilty, and those who protect them,\n\nOnly means that this will lead to the death of innocents to get to the\nguilty. I hate to say it but the land of the free is about to cost virtually\nevery Middle Eastern Immagrant to lose thier freedom and suffer the burdens\nof thier nationality. I&#39;m not a biggot or racist, I mean no disrespect to\nanyone who is or has friends that are but It happened dureing the second\nWorld war, it happened dureing Korea, It happened dureing Vietnam, and it\nhappened dureing the Gulf War. I hope I&#39;m wrong.\n\n\nSorry bout the commentary, just blowing off some steam.\n\nC.Wolf\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@...&gt;\nTo: Neo Beast Wars RPG &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, September 11, 2001 4:17 PM\nSubject: Re: Terrorist bombs-Everyone read\n\n\n&gt; OOC: I&#39;m glad we are talking about this. Hopefully the Council wont\n&gt; order us to stop these OOCs, this is an important, and historical day.\n&gt; Although for all the wrong reasons. The words of the President after the\n&gt; attack on Pearl Harbor work here, this is a day that will live in\n&gt; infamy.(My spelling may be off, but that is not important) I have been\n&gt; following this all day, in school and out. The images of the planes\n&gt; crashing into the WTC Towers, and the towers collapsing, as well as a\n&gt; side of our Department of Defense HG, the Pentagon destroyed, are truely\n&gt; evil. I hope that the United States of America respond quickly with\n&gt; lethal force. The Department of Defense taped into messages to Bin\n&gt; Ladden, saying that they had hit two targets. This is proof enough for\n&gt; me. The sites may not be named by name, but we know what they are\n&gt; talking about. These people must die. And terrorists all over the world\n&gt; must die. As you can see, i am talkative on this subject, and I&#39;m\n&gt; willing to talk to anyone who wishes to discuss this. God bless, and\n&gt; long live the United States of America.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
