I&#39;m happy to see that all of you are showing the initiative to\n&gt; have faith in the unknown. This will only strengthen our bonds and our\n&gt; forces.\n&gt;\n&gt; He then turns his head toward the direction of Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I notice you&#39;re a tad quiet Rodimus, I understand if something is bothering\n&gt; you and I&#39;m here to listen if you need to get a few things off your mind. I\n&gt; realize that you have been through a lot, and most of it unpleasent. I\n&gt; assure you Hydras will not get away with what he did to you and neither will\n&gt; the rest of his lackies.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; A stone solid look of determination comes over Tucson&#39;s face. Like Optimus\n&gt; he was not one to shy away from working toward a resolve.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; And if I must, if given the challenge, I will face him if he so choses, on\n&gt; a one to one basis. He took something very valuable away from me, my\n&gt; comrades, and my friends. And now, it&#39;s time I took something away from\n&gt; him.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus shook his head slighly as he turned to leave the room, his\nstrides long and purposeful. &quot;There are so many things to deal with at\nonce.&quot; He said as he walked, his face firm and resolute. &quot;At them\nmoment we have our two objectives, locating and defeating Hydras as\nwell as learning more information about the Insect creatures that we\nhave just encountered.&quot;\n\nRodimus turned and looked at the others that had followed him out of\nthe room. He gestured expansively with his his left hand as he\ncontinued to hold Elita in his right arm. They had all come to a stop\nin a large chamber, the bridge was just a litle ahead of them. Cheetor\nand Lord Elder also made thier way over to joim the group.\n\n&quot;Tuscon, since you are a Prime now and I am sure you are eager to\nrevisit yourself on Hydras, whoch will leave me to focus on the\ninsectoids.&quot; Rodimus smiled grimly as he tapped his head meaningfully.\n&quot;I believe that even though they have been able to learn much of us\nMaximals and Autobots from what was stored in my head, I believe that\nthey left a few tid bits in my head as well.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
