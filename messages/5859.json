He squashed it. &quot;Bugs, nasty fellows.&quot;\n    He had decided on his course of action, and there was only one logical \nstep remaining. He started the recording.\n    &quot;Bobertron, if you have received this message then I am offline. I wish \nfor you to return to the Destron base and take command. All the access codes \nare in one computer, mine. They will be opened to your signature only in the \nevent of my death. If you do get this message, try and get Pantron on our \nside, he will be of great help. All my plans are also in the main computer, \nno matter how different from what you thought I was planning follow them \nanyway possible, I do hope you understand. Good-bye.&quot;\n    He was very proud of his work, everything was going according to his \nplan. He quickly made his way to near the entrance of the base hoping to \ncatch the Destrocons before they made it too far into his base.\n\n"}}
