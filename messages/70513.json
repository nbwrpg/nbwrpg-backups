Obviously the mech had seen some hard times and was alarmed by his =\r\npressense.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; My name is Tucson Prime, I&#39;m an Autobot commander, well ju=\r\nst became a commander. I&#39;m very good friends of Optimus Prime, and comrade =\r\nto Rodimus Prime. Here, see? I have the Autobot insignia. I won&#39;t hurt you,=\r\n I promise. I&#39;m actually willing to help you, if you&#39;ll let me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His vo=\r\nice definitely matching that of Optimus Prime, yet just a slight different =\r\nthan the legendary commander of the Autobots. His body language matches tha=\r\nt of Optimus, as does his gentile demeanor.\n\nWhat Tuscon sees as he approac=\r\nhes is what appears to Alpha Trion in\nsize and body shape, however as he ap=\r\nproaches he can see that the\ncolors are red and yellow with little to none =\r\nof the blues that\ndecorated that venerated transformer.\n\nHis voice is a lit=\r\ntle different as well as he watched Tuscon with\ncareful optics and then spo=\r\nke, &quot;You are a Prime?&quot; the figure said as\nhe lowered his weapon. As the fig=\r\nure&#39;s arm drops Tuscon can see the\nAutobot sigil on the figure as well. &quot;I =\r\nam Vestige.&quot; he said, his\nvoice raspy and rough. &quot;How did you get here?&quot;\n\n(=\r\nTAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
