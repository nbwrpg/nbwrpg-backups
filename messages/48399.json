So I beg you that\n&gt; you answer those \n&gt; polls.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll post the result of that reseach in NBW&#39;s forums\n&gt; in one or two \n&gt; weeks, I&#39;ll anounce here that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; Airly\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
