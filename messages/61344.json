Rodimus turns to face a monitor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus: What on Cybertron is going on!\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup is at the monitor in an instant, looking over the data.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: Nightlight isnt our only problem now. This shows that a large \nforce is entering Earths atmosphere. The trajectory shows them \nheading for the connon site. They...\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup&#39;s optics grow wide, his mouth open as shock overtakes him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: Roddy, their configuraton match those of the Sweeps! I&#39;m not \ndetecting any Decepticon signatures though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus&#39; face grows serious. He stands behind Kup, looking over \nhis shoulder. He studies the data for a moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus: Their Sweeps alright. Just like Scourge&#39;s goons back in \nthe day. Not Decepticons thought. They must be Unicron&#39;s troops \nthen. Remember he created the original Sweeps, along with Scourge, \nCyclonus and Galvatron by reformatting Decepticons. Unicron must \nhave learned of the connon project. The Minions he sent must have \ntold him. Now he has ordered a massive strike on it to pave the way \nfor his arrival.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus thinks over this dire situation for another few moments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: This could be both bad a good for us. The good \nthing is that if Unicron feels that he must strike like this then \nthe cannon must be capable of stopping him and hes scared. The bad \nthing is that its going to take one hell of a defensive effort to \nstop the Sweeps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus looks to the Maximals and Autobot in the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Kup, make an announcement. Round up the Maximals. \nI&#39;ll contact the other commanders.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus heads to a communciation station. Meanwhile Kup opens a \ncommlink on all Maximal/Autobot channels.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: Maximals this is Security Chief Kup. A serious situation has \narised. Unicron has sent a massive force to strike at the cannon \nthat is being constructed to defend against Unicron. All Maximals as \nwell as other fections will be needed to defend it. Orders are here \nby issued to all Maximals and allies to report immedietly to the \ncannon construction site for battle. Good luck and may Primus watch \nover all of you. Kup out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup closes the link.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus has set up repeating subspace visual/audio signal to be \nsent to the other faction commanders.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: This is Maximal Commander Rodimus Prime calling the \nPredacon and Tripredacus Commanders. We have detected a assault \nforce arriving on the planet. This force is headed for the cannon. \nThe force seems to consist of Sweeps, similar to the old Decepticon \nclass. This leads us to believe that this force is a pre-emptive \nstrike by Unicron. I&#39;m sending every bot that the Maximals have to \ndefend the cannon. I suggest that the Predacons and Tripredacus do \nthe same. I hope to see you on the battle field. Prime out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Roddy closses that channel and faces the other bots in the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Ok guys, its time. Transform and roll out!\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup dashes through the halls, checking the ammo for his rifle on \nthe way. Once outside he transforms to his truck mode and heads for \nthe cannon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus waits behind to make sure everyone follows their orders.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I&#39;m ready for a good ol&#39; fight!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yojinbo of Nightmare &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hellplague:\n&gt; \n&gt; The Sweep commander slowed as the rest of her assault team exited \nhe \n&gt; hold.
