Things\nwere going good between them. Hot Rod never had things good with femms.\nHe had loved the Autobot femmm ArrCee, but she left him for Springer. He\nhad feelings for the Maximal Savanna, but she was killed. He also had\nfellings for Kamodia, but he gave them up because ArcAngel liked her.\nFeline seemed to be the one.\n\n"}}
