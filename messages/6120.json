He&#39;d said that he had had very few meetings with others of his kind, probably not knowing much about what one could do like them.\nA small smile creased her snout, such a sliiy thing to have forgotten. Forgetting that he was like her in so many ways, not knowing much about their own species.\nHer paws ponded the ground silently as she ran between pines and furr, the song of the Wolf hot in her veins.\nZyber could smell Rowdy&#39;s scent, fresh, wild, free, male.\nShe sneezed quietly to clear the smell from her snout to leave it open for a second realization of it, the scent of another wold familire and welcoming to her senses.\nShe sighed as she ran through the pine, the thought of two free wolves running together the best thought that she could ever think of.\nIt was nice to have another of her kind, nice to have somewolf to talk to, to experience with, to know.\nZyber liked the idea of being around her new aquaintense, having a chance to learn as well as teach. But it was also a known fact that female wolves enjoyed the company of their male counterparts, for some reasons more personal then some like to admit.\nBut at times they also scholded and shunned the presense of the males, most of the times when they were with cub or just plain bitchy.\nBut that wasn&#39;t Zyber. Her insticts were kept in check where there were others around, it was when she was alone that she really showed her wolfen side.\nShe rolled in the dust like any other wolf, hunted, killed, played, howled, watched, and observed. Just like any other.\nBut with Rowdy she felt a little more...free to act as herself.\nBut also being with him brought a bit of her wolfin side to the surface, a little more then she would like to admit.\nLike any female she simply kept her actions and temperment restrained, her insticts simply telling her then he was male and domenint.\nLike in a real pack.\nHaving no ties to other bots herself she mainly knew what it was like to be a wolf, and obayed the senses to a T.\nTo her, Rowdy was like the leader of the pack, the Alph Male, her simply being nothing more then a normal female in the pack. No Alph Female present but also not needed.\nBut these new feelings were a first for her, having no other wolves to be around in the past...always in cold temperatures where most packs stayed in the warm low lands. Only seeing arctic wolves rarely.\nZyber lifted her snout to the wind and caught an ever stronger scent of the male wolf, the scent of his maleness more pungent then the rest. But she simply lowered her head and sneezed again, the sudden thoughts of how male he was replaced by the thought that he did not understand the inter-com.\nShe sighed and then thought of a more better way to communicate, a way that was familier and more understandable for him.\nWith the intake of breath she threw her head to the sky and let out a long howl, her voice carrying for miles in every direction.*\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
