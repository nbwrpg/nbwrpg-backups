That technology has been\nobsolete for a long time and can&#39;t be replicated. Also, your actual\nmode seems much more performing than your previous one, whatever it\nwas. Now as for who we Tripredacus are...\n\nHe went over to an old pipe and sat there.\n\nBelthassan: We are descendants from a great Transformer who diverged\nfrom the Autobot ranks and went underground. No archives have been\npreserved of him. He established his faction and the millenias made us\nevolve to what we are today. Right now, we are busy pacifying\nCybertron from our recent conquest of it. We drove off the main forces\nof Maximals and the few Predacons who did not cooperate. They are\nrespectively the descendants of the Autobots and Decepticons. In other\nwords... (he glared at her) we are the masters of Cybertron!\n\n\n"}}
