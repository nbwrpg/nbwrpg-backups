It was time to put an end to this battle and to the traitor \nonce and for all. Lunarpine couldn&#39;t let the fact that they once \nserved together matter. At this moment only two things mattered to \nhim. Winning or losing would be the difference between who stands \ntall and who crawls away licking thier wounds.\n\n\nOOC Thank you and have a nice day.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Sorry, I thought I replied.

Slayer still didn&#39;t know that the wolf he was \n&gt; fighting was the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; once lesser wolf named Lunarpine, and now Slayer was going to \n&gt; learn that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine was more than more than meets the eye.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 31, 2000 5:37 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Yanosh don&#39;t leave me hangin\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Slayer laughs, watching Lunarping fall to the ground.
