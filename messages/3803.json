Her Great Owl mode looked powerful and yet soft and \ndelicate.  Her feathers were varios shades of gray from dark to light.  Her \ntalons were sharp and tucked up under her belly while flying.  Her deep \ngolden optics peirced through the dark so she could see in near total \ndarkness.  She effortlessly glided in and out of the trees keeping up with \nthe other two bots, Ramulus and Striker. She turned and looked at Ramulus.\n&quot;How much further until we reach your base? You look like you can use a CR \nchamber right now.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
