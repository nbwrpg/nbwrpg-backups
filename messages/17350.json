He sent a message to \nPhobia.\n\n&quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. I&#39;m at the Pred cave with the re-\ninforcements They are restless and won&#39;t wait long. You have to get \nhere, NOW!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq patted Koj and Inu-Yashu on the back.\n\n&quot;Alright! Even more bots to save Striker and Spears!&quot;\n\nThey continued their walk with the others.\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon shook his head.\n\n&quot;No, I could not do that. I can&#39;t put another spark away for all this \ntime just to bring him out. You might be in there for centuries. And \nif all goes well with Ramulus, he won&#39;t have to wait much longer \nBesides,&quot; Prebon said while checking out Spears&#39; feminine \nphysique, &quot;I don&#39;t think he would feel comfortable in your body.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, the other were in position. Ignatius spoke up.\n\n&quot;If were in cloak, how come were so far away from the exchange zone?&quot;\n\n&quot;Because,&quot; answered Hammer, &quot;When we were at The Ark we saw a cat-\nlike bot. She can probably smell very good. She would pick us up. \nThis way she can&#39;t smell us, were within comm range and we can be at \nthe battle sight in just under 3 minutes!&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
