Hydras looked the young\n&gt; male angry and looking back to Cyclonus replied &quot;Permission granted&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor just arrived to the throne Room and said &quot;Rodimus Prime has come\n&gt; back and the maximals are near Cells block&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;i&#39;L RIP HIS SPARK OUT HIS BODY&quot;Said Angry Hydras&quot;PREDACONS MOVE!!!!!&quot;\n\nCyclonus stood ready as Deepstryke, Phobia and  Nightrazor fell in behind him.\n\n&quot;Sir&quot; Cyclonus said, everything is in readiness, and the search is\nbeginning. &quot;We should soon be able to locate all the &quot;Maximals and\nAutobots. However if Nightlight has her signature masker on she will\nbe hard to locate.&quot;\n\nAs Cyclonus talked a message came in from Jhiaxus on the Predacon\nchannel, &quot;The Autobots are on the move on the prison cell level.&quot; he\nsaid, obviously trying to keep track of movements. &quot;I am directing\nScourge and Scorponok to engage, but they will need back up.&quot;\n\nA pause and Jhiaxus continued, &quot;Tuscon Prime is free as well, he was\nfreed by Rodimus and some sort of energy discharge in the cell block\ncontrol room. The lights are out on that level as well.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
