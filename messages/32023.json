This time it had enough fuel to probably last\nthe battle. On his way here, he had discovered that flying rather\nagreed with him.\n\n&quot;You know who to kill,&quot; he says to his troops behind him, quickly\npicking out a target. His EMP rifle fires four shots at Shockwave. Two\noptic blasts and two signature seeking missiles follow afterward, at\nthe same target.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer roars, running forward. His shoulder mounted missile\nlaunchers aim at Vehement, each one firing two missiles.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise charges past EndBringer, seeing Flesh Ripper. He also roars,\ncharging the bot with amazing speed.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIncarcinator looks down at the battle below. He was very high in the\nair. Taking out his large gun, he aims down at Unitron. He pulls the\ntrigger twice, sending two explosive shells down at Unitron.\n\nThe speed of the shells caused them to burn slightly while going down\ntoward Unitron. The gun was designed to fire extrodinary fast bullets.\nThe last time Incarcinator had shot this gun, the shell had gone\nthrough a Maximal shuttle and destroyed it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther approaches the battle, cloaked. He activates his scanners,\nwanting to detect any cloaked bots, if there were any here.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven watches his teammates rush into battle and follows, taking out\nboth his missile launcher. He fires three missiles at Rampage, all of\nthem heat seeking.\n\n\n"}}
