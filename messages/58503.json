A new poll has been created for the \n&gt; nbwrpg group:\n&gt; \n&gt; Just to remind you I&#39;m alive, I \n&gt; thought I&#39;d make a poll.  Do you think \n&gt; time should be accelerated in the \n&gt; rpg?  Basically, I&#39;m saying if we \n&gt; started incorporating reproduction, \n&gt; could we suddenly speed up time so the \n&gt; next generation was fighting, as \n&gt; opposed to doing another restart (I \n&gt; don&#39;t mean now, I mean in three or \n&gt; four years when something like that&#39;s \n&gt; neccessary again). \n&gt; \n&gt;   o Yes \n&gt;   o No \n&gt;   o OH NO!!!!!  YOU&#39;RE ALIVE!!!! \n&gt;   o DANG YEAH!!!!  YOU&#39;RE ALIVE!!!! \n&gt;   o Oh......you&#39;re alive.......really?....you sure?..... \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To vote, please visit the following web page:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/surveys?id=1145954  \n&gt; \n&gt; Note: Please do not reply to this message.
