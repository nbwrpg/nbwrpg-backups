We can help \n&gt; &gt; each other.  I will give you what energy I have\n&gt; left to keep you \n&gt; alive \n&gt; &gt; until help can arrive for you, but someday, by\n&gt; accepting this gift \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; make a pact that you shall avenge me (this isn&#39;t\n&gt; illegal is it).  \n&gt; TAKE \n&gt; &gt; IT!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He wills his energy into the pup.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: So does the pup accept.
