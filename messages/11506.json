Lunarpine \nknew what was going through her head, the same thoughts went through \nhis. They had to much work to do to worry about them being together, \nif thier work paid off then they might start something, if it didn&#39;t \nthen there was no use starting when the two wouldn&#39;t exist to \ncontinue.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing/Spears::\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; She walked out of the ship and saw Spears sitting at the entrance \n&gt; looking like she was deep in thought. &quot;Hey, you OK?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Spears::\n&gt; She turned with a little suprize. She relaxed and smiled,&quot;Geez, you \n&gt; startled me.&quot;  She chuckled, &quot;yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &quot;OK, so what&#39;s on your mind? You looked like you were taking a trip \n&gt; back to Cybertron.&quot; She said with half a chuckle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spears::\n&gt; &quot;yeah, but not in this pile of rusted bolts. This ship is so \ndamaged, \n&gt; it wouldn&#39;tfly again even if we replaced everything onboard down to \n&gt; the paper clips in the captain&#39;s desk. The ark is grounded for \ngood. \n&gt; And all we can do is sit here and repair parts of it just enough to \n&gt; survive another pred attack.&quot; She gave a deep sigh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; She put a comforting hand on Spears shoulder.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, \n&gt; everything will work out.  You&#39;ll see.&quot; She smiled at Spears and \n&gt; walked down the ramp.  She had another welding torch with her.  She \n&gt; walked up to Lunarpine, &quot;Hello beloved.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
