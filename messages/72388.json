With a look\n&gt; around, satisfying herself that she w=\r\nas indeed alone, she layed down,\n&gt; folding her arms back behind her head an=\r\nd just watched the skies as\n&gt; the sky continued darkness on its way towards=\r\n night.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile the way for WHEELIE was largely unimpeeded. The guar=\r\nds\n&gt; standing at the door nodded to him as he entered. The large room was\n&gt;=\r\n nearly empty now, evidently UNUS was elsewhere at the moment. A few\n&gt; figu=\r\nres turned and glanced at WHEELIE as he made his way through, but\n&gt; none of=\r\n them paid him much attention.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving through the next doors he came b=\r\nack to the room that housed\n&gt; RODIMUS, one of the nursing staff exiting the=\r\n room as WHEELIE walked\n&gt; up, she turned to look at WHEELIE, &quot;Your friend i=\r\ns doing quite well.&quot;\n&gt; She said. &quot;Since he has awakened and the major repai=\r\nr work completed\n&gt; his healing process has been going rather fast.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne nurse gestured at the door. &quot;We have him on an energon infusion\n&gt; now, ke=\r\neping his self repair circuits rarified and powered up. But he\n&gt; may be loo=\r\nking for a visitor or two now.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWHEELIE nodded, &quot;What is his st=\r\nate?  Do you think he can tkae a bit of agitate?  Or do you think he should=\r\n stay, and I should not say anything to upset him in any way?&quot;  WHEELIE nee=\r\nded some general thoughts at the moment, and RODIMUS was the only one aroun=\r\nd.  But if the medic didn&#39;t think that RODIMUS was in any state to be agita=\r\nted and rushed out of bed, like him hearing that GRIMLOCK was here, then WH=\r\nEELIE would nto go ahead and say anything. \n\nFor the moment, waiting for th=\r\ne medic&#39;s assent togo and see RODIMUS, and what state he was in otherwise b=\r\nefore he would speak anything in.\n\n\n"}}
