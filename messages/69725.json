Yet he speaks no more of him around Lord Elder.  Tucson sens=\r\nes it in Rat Trap&#39;s quiet grunt.  Lord Elder made sense to him.  Right now,=\r\n he did not need to bad mouth Rodimus for what happened to him, he had to t=\r\nry to UNDERSTAND what happened and try to figure out a way to help him and =\r\ntry to put the past behind him once he did  help him. \n\n&quot;Rat Trap, I don&#39;t =\r\nwant to sound like a demon&#39;s advocate here, but, Lord Elder is right.  I do=\r\nn&#39;t think Rodimus really intended to turn sides like he did, and perhaps th=\r\ne force that got him there was far greater than he could fend off.  We real=\r\nly shouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions.&quot;\n\nQuickstride listens in as well.\n\n&quot; Good=\r\n point.  We really should listen ta Tucson, Rat Trap, and Lord Elder.&quot;\n\nRat=\r\n Trap sighs.\n\n&quot;Okay, I promise not one more bad word outa my mouth about an=\r\nyone.. Except for the Preds and Decepticons.  Now about that minion...  I a=\r\nlmost forgot about that one Lord Elder..  Gee, bad me, forgot ta put my toy=\r\ns away when I was done playn&#39; with &#39;em..&quot;\n\nTucson struggles to get on his f=\r\neet, and walks over to Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve got an idea Lord Elder...  It wo=\r\nrked at that Fortress, so it might work here..  My sonar transmitter.. If w=\r\ne can augment the frequency from my transmitter through the audio systems o=\r\nf this ship, we may just be able to stun that minion and any others that ar=\r\ne around the Maximal base.  Of course, being careful to program the frequen=\r\ncy so it doesn&#39;t harm Maximals or Autobots... Let&#39;s see...  I&#39;ve done somet=\r\nhing to that effect before...  I&#39;ll do a very mild form of the sonar transm=\r\nission, and let me know if any of you feel it.&quot;\n\nHe performs a test which p=\r\nroves harmless to Maximal kind.  Rat Trap shakes his head no as well as Qui=\r\nckstride.\n\n&quot;Good, you can&#39;t feel the effects.  I do believe this frequency =\r\nmay just be able to do something mild to a Predacon and a Decepticon.  I do=\r\nn&#39;t need to amp it by much, just enough to stun them, and hopefully get som=\r\ne stasis cuffs on them before they move.  I have several pairs left on hand=\r\n, just enough to capture a few more minions. Good thing this has its own ba=\r\nttery.&quot;\n\nQuickstride prepares several of his energy weapons for use.\n\n&quot;Look=\r\ns like we&#39;re tak&#39;n a little detour.&quot;\n\nSomething in Tucson&#39;s directory snaps=\r\n.  He raises a brow in alarm.  Thoughts race through his mind and one sudde=\r\nnly hits him.\n\n&quot;Wait a minute..  Lord Elder, the attack on the base....  Wh=\r\ny would they want an old base when there&#39;s more to be had at the Ark?  Of c=\r\nourse...  A DIVERSION!  THEY&#39;RE PLANNING A DIVERSION SO THEY CAN GET US AWA=\r\nY FROM THE ARK!&quot; \n\nHe looks to Lord Elder in alarm.\n\n&quot;Sorry for raising my =\r\nvoice, that wasn&#39;t my intent, but the Ark is in grave danger and even with =\r\nthe shields, once the power is drained the shields will not function any mo=\r\nre.  They know that Lord Elder.  They know that with an attack at the old M=\r\naximal Base, they can draw attention off the Ark and toward the base.  It l=\r\neaves it completely vulnerable to attack.&quot;\n\nRat Trap and Quickstride look t=\r\no each other and then back to Lord Elder and Tucson.\n\n&quot;So, what do we do Wh=\r\neels?&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s four of us here.  Two of us go back to the =\r\nArk, and two of us continue to the Maximal base.  Of course, with Lord Elde=\r\nrs permission.  It&#39;s the only way we can secure both locations at one time.=\r\n&quot;\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I - promise Lord Elder. Not one thing - will be touched in the ark=\r\n. In honor of those I serve, I will - not upset any balance that still rema=\r\nins in place.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That is good Tuscon.&quot; Lord Elder said as he struggled =\r\nto keep the\n&gt; shuttle in flight. It was getting a little easier as he got u=\r\nsed to\n&gt; the imbalance of one of the engines.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Actually, there is a =\r\nname that fits ya better. What&#39;dya think about TUCSON PRIME?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quick=\r\nstride gives Rat Trap a thumbs up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Works for me, what&#39;dya think L=\r\nord Elder?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder is silent for a moment, &quot;The Primes are a speci=\r\nal breed.&quot;\n&gt; he said finally, the look on his face grave. &quot;They are chosen =\r\nby the\n&gt; matrix, the name shouldn&#39;t be just given.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; I sure know th=\r\nat one Wheels. Primus knows we&#39;ve all been there in some point in our lives=\r\n. But I got a feeln&#39; that I don&#39;t normally get.. I ain&#39;t usually too optimi=\r\nstic but there&#39;s a tiny little feeling of optimism startn&#39; ta build in me. =\r\nDon&#39;t usually get this warm&#39;n fuzzy but it&#39;s there. And it started when I f=\r\nirst saw ya in that fortress. I think you got lucky for a reason Wheels, yo=\r\nu got lucky because it was fate. Yep that&#39;s what it was, fate. And from wha=\r\nt I kinda know about Roddimus... &quot;Grime&quot;... He wasn&#39;t too ready ta take on =\r\nthe responsibility of ben&#39; a Prime officer, it just somehow happened. But y=\r\nou, on the other hand, you got what it takes. I think you might just be a l=\r\nost Prime, if ya ask me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hmph, let&#39;s see what Lord Elder thinks. S=\r\nir, what&#39;dya think? Could Wheels be the next Autobot leader?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Eld=\r\ner frowned as they spoke of Rodimus in derogatory terms,\n&gt; listening to the=\r\n name they called him. &quot;A leader, a Prime is special.\n&gt; He must prove himse=\r\nlf, not only in battle but also in wisdom, and be\n&gt; able to rally the Maxim=\r\nals and Autobots.&quot; Elder glanced pointedly at\n&gt; Tuscon, &quot;and he must learn =\r\nto see past what he thinks is the obvious\n&gt; answer.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder turned back=\r\n to his controls as he linked up with the ark&#39;s\n&gt; systems, &quot;No!&quot; he said as=\r\n he watched one of his smaller screens in\n&gt; front him, &quot;There is a Minion h=\r\novering over the old Maximal base&quot;\n&gt; Elder glanced at Rat Trap, &quot;The one yo=\r\nu used when you first arrived.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder replayed the last set of transmi=\r\nssions:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Marauder.&quot; Legacy began, his voice carrying the\n&gt; &gt; slighte=\r\nst hint of curiousness. &quot;We are holding no\n&gt; &gt; minion prisoner. Whom do you=\r\n mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Marauder&#39;s voice quickly replied over the same\n&gt; &gt; channel,=\r\n his voice calm and confident, &quot;The minion\n&gt; &gt; known as Lamia, she has call=\r\ned out to me, you will\n&gt; &gt; release her immediately&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked back to =\r\nhis controls, &quot;We may need to change course to assist.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Pre=\r\nston\n&gt; (Lord Elder)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
