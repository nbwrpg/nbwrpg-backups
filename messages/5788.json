I want to fight back and strike first \nfor once. I know it&#39;s wrong, but want to taake them out before they take us \nout.&quot;\n\n----Original Message---\nFrom:   &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\nDate: Wed Jul 5, 2000 5:58pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n::Prowl::\n\nProwl looks over at Shadow Wing as she flies up to him.
