Anyway=\r\n, Thanks for being honest with me about Tucson. So I heard right...  Someon=\r\ne mentioned Tucson Prime in the transmissions..  Good for him, He worked re=\r\nally hard ta get ta where he is, and ta become a Prime..  The Matrix made a=\r\n great choice.&quot;  \n\nShe now picks up on Tucson Prime&#39;s location.\n\n&quot; Accordin=\r\ng to my sensors, he&#39;s in the Black Fortress, beneath the foundation in some=\r\n sort of deep tunnel system.  Well, I just can&#39;t sit around and wait for hi=\r\nm can I?  After all, he&#39;s gonna need me.  When we work together, we hardly =\r\nmiss our targets.   It&#39;s real rare that we do but most of the time, any arr=\r\now that gets shot by us, usually hits its mark.  Sorry, can&#39;t stick around =\r\nLord Elder, I gotta get off my aft and do something.&quot;\n\nShe darts toward the=\r\n exit door, and then forgets the most important aspect. Her inability to fl=\r\ny, and the fact that her alt form is a weapon not a vehicle.\n\n&quot; Oh, yeah, I=\r\n forgot.  I - can&#39;t fly and I don&#39;t transform into a vehicle.  Think I can =\r\nborrow one of your shuttles sir?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston C=\r\narroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: LORD ELDER, Elita, Straight Shot=\r\n\n&gt; Location: Ark - Command Center\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Elita, it&#39;s been a long time, I =\r\nmissed you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She then looks to Lord Elder. She had met him at one t=\r\nime, but did not\n&gt; &gt; get the chance to really know him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Lord Elder=\r\n, Right? It&#39;s been a long time, and I think we were\n&gt; &gt; introduced a while =\r\nago, but, maybe ya don&#39;t remember who I am. If not,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m Straight Shot, =\r\nTucson&#39;s half sister and his all time favorite weapon of choice.\n&gt; &gt; But we=\r\n&#39;re not cheating, he does all the aiming and firing when he uses me.\n&gt; &gt; Oh=\r\n, yeah, ya might not know that part. My alt modes are Cross Bow and\n&gt; &gt; reg=\r\nular bow. So, um, speakn&#39; of my half brother.. He is okay right?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord=\r\n Elder turned around to take in Straight Shot, his optics widened\n&gt; slightl=\r\ny, &quot;Um, y . . yes&quot; Elder stammered slightly trying to get his\n&gt; words out, =\r\nclearly at a loss. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; He said as he stood to face\n&gt; her. &quot;I had q=\r\nuite forgotten you were back there. I think I&#39;m going to\n&gt; have to make an =\r\ninventory of who&#39;s back there.&quot; He said as he\n&gt; chuckled.\n&gt; \n&gt; He glanced b=\r\nack at the board which was intermittently giving radio\n&gt; responses from the=\r\n various Autobots and Maximal&#39;s as the ark\n&gt; communication was able to rece=\r\nive it.\n&gt; \n&gt; From what I can gather Tuscon is on his way out with Rodimus P=\r\nrime,\n&gt; Windlord and Nightlight as well.&quot; He paused and mumbled, &quot;I can&#39;t\n&gt;=\r\n gaurantee what shape they&#39;ll be in though.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A radio transmission came=\r\n through from Lord Persues at the old Maximal\n&gt; Base . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Tuscon, =\r\nI&#39;m reading your location, please let us know if you need asistance,&quot; Perse=\r\nus replied.  &quot;Lord Elder, do you read?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder turned as he got the tra=\r\nnsmission, &quot;Yes, I am reading you loud\n&gt; and clear.&quot; Elder slid back into h=\r\nis seat as he attenuated the\n&gt; transmission, &quot;We are standing by to receive=\r\n any wounded from the\n&gt; rescue mission, and we have Straight Shot here for =\r\nany back up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder glanced back at her grinning somewhat sheepishly, =\r\nhoping that\n&gt; his assumption was right.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
