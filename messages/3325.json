They stood for a moment in the door-way, getting\nused to the artificial light. They walked down\ncorridors and hallways, looking for someone to ask,\nbasically, where they where. They stopped and decided\nto take a more direct approach,*\n\n &quot; Computer, track spark signature to exact location&quot;\n\n * The computer beeped and ran a series of complex\ncodes that only Snow Tech and Shadow Cat knew. It then\nshowed a hologram of all the spark signatures in the\nArk. One in particular spark was zoomed in, but it\nlooked really different to Snow Tech, he turned to his\nsister and asked,*\n\n &quot; Uh, does Iron have two sparks?&quot;\n\n * Shadow Cat frowned and grabbed the small computer\nfrom Snow Tech. Looking at it quickly turned from a\nfrown to a surprised look to a smirk. She turned to\nSnow Tech,*\n\n &quot; Haven&#39;t you ever heard of the Sprockets and the\ndiodes?&quot;(Birds and the Bees)\n\n * Snow Tech&#39;s eyes went wide and he screwed up his\nface, stuck out his tounge and said,*\n\n &quot; Ewwwww! Tha&#39;s Gross! This place has made Inny\nsoft.!&quot;\n\n *They quickly decided to search out the leader of\nthis group rather than their long-lost friend at this instant.*&gt;\n\n"}}
