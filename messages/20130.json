She fell \nforward\n&gt; and landed on her hands and knees. She turned her head, looking at\n&gt; LadyHawk, &quot;Why? I thought you were a friend?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady Hawk looked down at Squizzy, &quot;I am a friend,  but I can&#39;t risk \nmy\n&gt; science being turned into a weapon. She lowered herself to finish \nthe\n&gt; mongoose but hesitated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Squizzy, felt sick to her stomach and light headed. She couldn&#39;t \nunderstand,\n&gt; why was this bot\n&gt; of science attacking her. &quot;I wanted to see the nature bots too.&quot; \nShe fell\n&gt; down and layed on her side. She felt disoriented and fearful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady Hawk saw her error at the next moment. she couldn&#39;t let Zardus \nhave the\n&gt; experiments, and she couldn&#39;t allow Squizzy to stay here either. \nshe tried\n&gt; to pick her up when Najah attacked.Lady Hawk wasn&#39;t trained as a \nwarrior,\n&gt; she was to wrapped up with Squizzy that she didn&#39;t see Najah until \nshe was\n&gt; wrapped up in Najahs coils. Lady Hawk managed to get her talons up \nin time\n&gt; to block Najahs bite. Useing all her strength she held on for dear \nlife,\n&gt; trying to break the snakes hold on her. &quot;Snakes were supposed to be \neaten by\n&gt; hawks, not the other way around.&quot; she thought as the snakes bite \ncame\n&gt; closer. She looked back towards Squizzy, she hoped the mongoose \ncould handle\n&gt; the snake for her unfortunately Najah had other ideas. One of those \nideas\n&gt; seemed to involve a Hawk dinner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Najah started crush Lady HAwk&#39;s body as if he were a phyton. Lady \nHawk was\n&gt; beginning to feal like a recycled can. &quot;Would you stop already? \nwe&#39;re\n&gt; supposed to be on the same side.&quot; Somehow she knew that Najah \nprobably\n&gt; didn&#39;t care about sides. She tried to squirm with no effect. her \nonly hope\n&gt; was that someone on the alliance would pull the snake off. Najah \ntried again\n&gt; to bite her knowing that his mortal poyson would  do all work. The \nhalf Hawk\n&gt; snapped forward trying to bite the snake. This creature needed to \nlearn not\n&gt; to mess with royalty.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Airshadow Nightlight &lt;airly2000@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, November 05, 2000 12:01 PM\n&gt; Subject: Najah bites at Lady hawk\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Najah::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Najah didn&#39;t like that no one over him kill the bird\n&gt; &gt; so that he, in his beast mode, moved quikcly and\n&gt; &gt; toward her and bite her while his snake-body involed\n&gt; &gt; her in a mortal hugg.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Demoliton::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He detached from War Machine, and went to bot mode.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He fired on Lady\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hawk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Thousands of Stores.
