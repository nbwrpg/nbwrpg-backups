He returns \nher look of love with one of the same love, all his systems wanting to kiss \nher, but the pain in his side restraining him.\n\nWith a sigh, he sets off after her, slightly growling as his broken ribs \nscratch aganst internal circitry, sending more pain through his systems. He \nfollows her to the Ark,  grinning weakly at her comment.\n\n&quot;I could &#39;handle it&#39;,&quot; he says when they near the CR chambers, kissing her on \nthe cheek and ignoring the pain it caused in his side. He leans away, nearly \nlosing his balance as everything becomes unfocused. Through unfocused optics, \nhe sees Shadow Cat walk up. He stumbles back a few steps, his hand leaving \nIron Raptor&#39;s and his other hand grabbing onto a wall to steady himself.\n\n&quot;Warning,&quot; his internal computer&#39;s voice sounds in his head, &quot;Major internal \nsystem damage. Iminent system shutdown.&quot;\n\nHe growls under his breath. That would explain the dizziness. But how are his \ninternal systems now damaged when, seconds before, he only had some broken \nribs and a cracked wing?\n\nWith some silent commands, he orders his computer to bring up a chart of his \ndamage. In front of the unfocused view of the room on his optic sensors, a \nclear chart apears, showing red around his ribs. Prowl growls. His broken \nribs must have destroyed the internal circitry in his side, damaging the \nsystems and causing them to malfunction.\n\nProwl takes a staggering step forward towards the CR chambers, almost yelling \nout as his ribs dig into his side. With a hissing noice and a loud pop, smoke \nbegins to emerge from his side, going through the spaces in between the \nfingers of the hand that he quickly brings up to press against his side. His \nspark cavity opens, the TM2 spark releasing repair coils to his damage side \nas he slumps down to the floor, almost going unconscious.\n\n"}}
