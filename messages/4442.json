Why was he helping her? Ussually, he\nwas\n&gt; the sort of bot to sit and watch bots killing each other, or help them\nkill,\n&gt; unless there was something to his advantage. He sruggs. Too late to pull\nback\n&gt; now anyways.\n&gt;\n&gt; Shredder keeps firing at Wrath, wondering if a grenade would do too much\n&gt; damage on the other bots in the vicinity.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; STEALS AND DEALS!
