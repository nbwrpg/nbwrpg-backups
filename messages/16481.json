But this bot had treated her nicely and \nshe didn&#39;t feel quite as scared with him. She slowly looked around \ninside the hanger bay.  She stood up and climbed out of Dark One.\nShe reached the floor and stood there looking at Dark One. &quot;I will, \none I get this thing out of my shoulder. Thank you.&quot; She looked \naround with fear and curiosity. &quot;Where are we? What is this place?&quot;\nShe still had the fear of what &#39;reprogramming&#39; ment. \nShe then had a strange thought and it send shivers up her back. &quot;Why \ndid you help me back there? What do you want me for?&quot;\n\nShe knew she was no fighter, but her skills would be useful. But she \ncouldn&#39;t figure out what a bunch of fighter would want with an \nengineer and programmer. She looked down and tried to remember her \npast. But all she could remember were partial images. But she mostly \nremembered her her training and engineering skills.  But she hated \nnot knowing who she was or where she was or why she was even there.\n\n(Basically she is a conputer geek and scientist)\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Dark One::\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark One swoops into the base, still in jet fighter mode.
