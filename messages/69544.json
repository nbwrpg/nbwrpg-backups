Much of the ship&#39;s systems have been r=\r\neturned to either a defensive mode, turned down so low so that millions of =\r\nyears from now the Autobots and Decepticons that rest here in in&#39;s heart wi=\r\nll have the power to reawaken when the time comes. \n\nHowever off to one sid=\r\ne, inside one of the repair pods chambers, one that could possible have hou=\r\nsed one of the tape sized transformers a dim light blinks. It&#39;s a light tha=\r\nt had been blinking for quite some time, slowly, over the course of several=\r\n months shifting from a crimson red, to an amber, then yellow, and now for =\r\nthe first time it blinks once and then turns a steady green. \n\nA pop and hi=\r\nss can be heard as the door of the pod clicks and then slides to the side. =\r\nInside the repair pod the cold cyclopean visage of its singular inhabitant =\r\ncan be just made out as smoke and other repair fumes escape from the chambe=\r\nr and into the air of the surrounding room. The occupant&#39;s single optic bli=\r\nnks as the figure comes online and then gleams a stead crimson hue as the f=\r\nigure jerks once and awakens fully.\n\nThe deck plating clanks as the figure =\r\nsteps out and looks around, taking a moment to get its bearings. Everything=\r\n appears to be alright, its crimson gaze seeming to pierce the darkness of =\r\nthis chamber with ease. \n\nA few steps takes the figure to a control panel t=\r\nhat is posiioned off to one side. One that is obviously ot part of the orig=\r\ninal construction, but has only been put here more recently. With a few def=\r\nt touches it lights up and with startling speed information began to scroll=\r\n across it. A recording of an Autobot transmission has been recorded, as we=\r\nll as strange sensor recordings that may possibly be minion activity. \n\n&quot;Gr=\r\neetings Autobots and Maximals&quot; a cold voice transmited itself dually across=\r\n Maximal and Autobot encrypted communication lines. &quot;This is Legacy, and I =\r\nhave reawakened. Do you require assistance?&quot;\n\n&lt;TAG&gt;\n\nPreston\n(Legacy)\n\nOOC:=\r\n please note that many of the Maximals/Autobots that participated in the bi=\r\ng minion battle that happened at the ark (about a year ago Real Time) may r=\r\nemember Legacy, how he appeared seeming to know many strange things about p=\r\neople, protected the Ark, was badly damaged in its defense and has not been=\r\n heard from . . . until now. \n\n\n"}}
