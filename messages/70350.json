I have no\nfear of you Cybertronians.&quot; Her words cold and arrogant, dripping with\nscorn.\n\nShe turned to look at small pod that housed Rodimus, her humor still\nevident. With a quick slash of one of her bladed forelegs she cut\nthrough part of the webbed adhesive that was holding the pod in place\nand the pod began to sink toward the ground.\n\n&quot;Take him!&quot; she said derisively, &quot;He has already given me all that I\nneed to know.&quot; She floated higher into the air as she looked at the\ngroup, the beat of her wings causing a cool breeze to stir around the\nchamber.\n\n&quot;For it seems we have others to take his place.&quot; The queen&#39;s voice was\nalmost hungry as she spoke. Meanwhile, from the same direction that\nTuscon and his group had entered insectile soldiers entered, evidently\nthe last ones they had encountered from the bruises and dents on a\nfew. This time they were carrying what appeared to Scourge at first,\nor at least two of him, although they were slightly lighter in color -\nThey were Sweeps, the drone minions of the implacable hunter!\n\nShe laughs, &quot;My children will feed well, and learn still more.&quot;\n\nFrom a few of the hundreds of dark openings a few insect like\ncreatures came out. These looked somewhat different than the ones the\ngroup has seen before. Looking like a cross between a spider and a\nmantis, they had scorpion no tail cannon like the others, instead they\nhad positioned on their bodies cannon mounts and rocket launchers,\nalthough they did have the same mantis legs and blades. However the\nmost striking features was their color. Instead of the darker colors\nthe others have been, these were yellow and orange and red - Rodimus&#39;\ncolors!\n\n&quot;Go my would be guardians.&quot; the queen said mockingly, &quot;Leave now\nbefore my children grow too hungry too soon!&quot; More children began to\nbe seen coming from the caves as she spoke, although for the moment\nnone of them were approaching the group, but were instead lifting\ntheir heads upwards as if sniffing the air.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
