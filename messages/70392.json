As Talon got closer he\ncould hear last bit of the conversation Legacy was having with Cheetor\nvia radio. Cheetor was saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t trust those\nPredacons, they&#39;ve fooled us before.&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t trust those Predacons at all!&quot; Ramulus quipped, also over the radio.\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t trust anyone Ramulus!&quot; Cheetor said, half jokingly\n\n&quot;You are correct.&quot; Legacy replied via radio, cutting into thier side\nconversation, &quot;However so far Perceptor has proven loyal in this\nrespect.&quot;\n\nCheetor sighed, &quot;Okay, I gotcha. Give the bot rope to hang himself with.&quot;\n\n&gt; Tucson sends out a sonar wave, and quickly finds the hook with his hand, wrapping around his arms securely. He looks down to the others.\n&gt; &quot; All right, I have the cable. Can you pull more than just one of us up at a time? If not, I&#39;ll wait until the others are up there safely.&quot;\n\nAs Talon got to the top he could see Cheetor standing at the top of\nthe pit, with Airhammer in his strange Hammerhead Shark-Hawk beast\nmode hovering watchfully in the air, he seemed agitated.\n\nRamulus was standing at the edge of the pit, the rope that was\ndangling down had been shot from Ramulus&#39; forearm, and that he was\nstanding braced to pull others to saftety.\n\nLegacy, on the other hand had not slowed in his flight as he rose\nhigher into the air, taking Rodimus in the direction of the Ark,\n\n&quot;Maybe I could get two or three if I could get some help here.&quot;\nRamulus griped as he glanced meaningfully at Talon, Cheetor and\nAirhammer!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
