The code from the current one isn&#39;t too good for the remake, so I&#39;m writing brand new code. I am almost done setting up the database for it.\n\nI have recieved very little responce to my suggestion of moving everything to the NBW site. Does anyone care other than the 5 or 6 people that replied? If you do, speak up!\n\nAlso, and thanks to Airly for reminding me of this, Moonmist emailed me saying that she can&#39;t participate anymore. She said someone could take her chars. Anyone want them? I already have some requests for &#39;em.\n\n\n"}}
