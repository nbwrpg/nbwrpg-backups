He frowns. What was in that ship? The corridor was too dark for him to see through, and it didn&#39;t look like anything was going to come out.\n\n&quot;Here we go,&quot; he says quietly to himself, keeping his weapons armed and walking into the ship, passing through the entrance and then looking up around the room that he was now in. Along the various things in the room, he sees a command chair, with a large bot sitting in it, his eyes widening. He steps back slightly, looking at the bot in the chair with a surprised look in his face. That was someone whom he hadn&#39;t expected to see.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  The door slid open for shredder. A voice boomed out. &quot;Come in Shredder.
