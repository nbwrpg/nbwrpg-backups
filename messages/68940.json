Only being in proto-form wa=\r\nsn&#39;t\nsleep, but a state of unconsciousness.  A place where time had no\nmean=\r\ning, where life and awareness had no existence.  \n\nComing out of stasis was=\r\nn&#39;t waking up; it was being reborn.\n\nOne by one, Jynx&#39;s systems came online=\r\n, his optics activating to see\n360 degrees of jungle surrounding him.  He c=\r\nould hear birds singing,\nbugs chirping, and other various animals making al=\r\nl kinds of noise. \nHe blinked once and then hopped down  from his pod, star=\r\ning at the\njungle with wide eyes.\n\n&quot;Trees! Thereare-notrees-onOmechianPrime=\r\n. Arethere?No. Where-arewe?&quot; \nHe raised a hand to scratch his head and then=\r\n noticed the strange\nlooking skin and fur.  \n\n&quot;Fur! Fingers! -wait,fingers-=\r\naren&#39;tnew,no. But look! I got FUR!&quot;\n\nJynx felt his face, two fingers pullin=\r\ng on his lip while another found\nhis nose before he jumped up onto the stas=\r\nis pod and looked down into\nthe reflective glass to see the monkey face loo=\r\nking back at him.  He\nhad to wipe off a thick layer of moss growing on the =\r\npod to see it. \n\n&quot;Hehe! Shard-areyou-seeingthis?&quot;  He knew he didn&#39;t have t=\r\no ask of\ncourse; Shard was already there, always watching even if he didn&#39;t=\r\n say\nanything.\n\n&quot;Unfortunately, yes,&quot; came the flat reply.\n\n&quot;OH LOOK!&quot; Jynx=\r\n exclaimed, ignoring his friend&#39;s complete lack of\nenthusiasm.  He reached =\r\nback and grabbed his tail.\n&quot;I&#39;vealways-wantedatail!&quot;\n\nHolding it close to t=\r\nhe end, he brushed it against his hand like a\nduster and then put it in his=\r\n mouth.\n\nShard watched with growing disinterest and frustration.  &quot;Will you=\r\n\nstop fooling around? We need to figure out where we are and why we&#39;re\nhere=\r\n.&quot;\n\n&quot;Right! Ofcourse-you&#39;reright,you&#39;re-usuallyright.&quot;  Jynx jumped down\nfr=\r\nom the pod and looked around observantly.  &quot;Lookslike-we&#39;rein-ajungle!&quot;\n\nSh=\r\nard rolled his eyes and walked over to the pod, opening up it&#39;s\ncomputer.\n\n=\r\n&quot;Whatareyoudoing?&quot; Jynx asked, rattling off his usual\nhyper-speed-speech th=\r\nat sometimes was impossible to understand. \n\nShard started typing at the ke=\r\nyboard.  &quot;Pulling up the flight path of\nthe pod to see-&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh! Where-we&#39;veb=\r\neen! Good idea!&quot;\n\n&quot;Stop interrupting.&quot; Shard growled and continued working.=\r\n  After\nseveral seconds, he stopped typing with a slight frown.  &quot;No flight=\r\n path.&quot;\n\n&quot;No-flightpath??? Wait- whatdoes-thatmean?&quot;\n\n&quot;It means the pod was=\r\n ejected, which they only do in emergency\nsituations - like before crashing=\r\n.&quot;\n\n&quot;CRASHING??? weCRASHED???&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, now shut up.&quot; Shard kept typing at th=\r\ne computer.  &quot;According to\nthese projections, we may have been in orbit. Th=\r\ne data looks damaged,\nbut according to the computer, it&#39;s been at least thi=\r\nrty years.&quot;\n\n&quot;Years?Thirty? That&#39;sa-longnap.&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up,&quot; Shard said again,=\r\n this time more forcefully.  &quot;Thirty years\nis more than enough time to have=\r\n escaped or gotten rescued...\nsomething must have happened-&quot;\n\n&quot;Predacons!&quot;\n=\r\n\nResisting the urge to blow up at Jynx, Shard looked up at the jungle.\n Any=\r\n other bot may have been asking how Jynx would know that, but\nShard knew be=\r\ntter. Besides, it&#39;s not like there were than many things\nthat could have he=\r\nld back a crew of Maximals.  &quot;Predacons,&quot; he concurred.\n\n&quot;Well,solvedthat-l=\r\netsgo-findtheMaximals-sowe-cansay-hello.&quot;\n\n&quot;Slag, no. We&#39;re going to the Pr=\r\nedacons,&quot; Shard insisted.\n\n&quot;What??  Butthey&#39;re-thebad-guysand-they&#39;llprobab=\r\nly-wantto-killme!\nMaximals-arenicer,&quot; with that, Jynx started walking, &quot;Let=\r\nsgo-&quot;\n\n&quot;Nicer??&quot; Shard almost yelled, &quot;You must be completely off your\nrock=\r\ner! We are NOT joining them and that&#39;s final!&quot;\n\nJynx frowned.  &quot;Rocker? Iha=\r\nve-arocker?&quot;\n\n&quot;Jynx!&quot;\n\n&quot;Sorrysorry! Right,Maximals,&quot; Jynx started walking a=\r\ngain, but only\nmade it two steps before Shard stopped him again.\n\n&quot;Alright,=\r\n that&#39;s it. You join the Maximals, and I&#39;ll join the Preds.&quot;\n\n&quot;What??? Butw=\r\necan&#39;t-  OOOHHH! Youmean-you&#39;regonna-jointhe-Predacons\nand-I&#39;lljoin-theMaxi=\r\nmals!!  Andthey-won&#39;tknow! \nIt&#39;llbe-likewe-didonCybertron-in-&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, shut =\r\nup.&quot; Shard interrupted again.  &quot;You remember the rules right?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yesyesyes!=\r\n&quot; Jynx replied, &quot;ThoughIstill-don&#39;tsee-why-&quot;\n\n&quot;When I find a safe place for=\r\n us to be together, I&#39;ll tell you,&quot; Shard\nstated.  He transformed into robo=\r\nt mode and pulled out a small bomb. \n&quot;Stick to the rules until I tell you o=\r\ntherwise.  If you run into\nPreds, run away, if you find Maximals, get them =\r\nto tell us where the\nPredacons are, understand?&quot;  He placed the bomb on the=\r\n stasis pod.\n\n&quot;Yesyesyes... Jynxremember! Predsrun, Maxisfriends!&quot; Curiousi=\r\nty\npeeked, Jynx reached for the bomb.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t touch that!&quot; Shard said, near=\r\nly swatting Jynx&#39;s hand away.  He\nthen set the detonator and transformed ba=\r\nck into beast mode.  &quot;Get\nmoving.&quot;\n\nJynx watched the bomb blinking for a mo=\r\nment before hearing Shard&#39;s yell.\n\n&quot;JYNX!&quot;\n\n&quot;Rightrightright! Sorry!&quot; Jynx =\r\ncalled and ran away from the pod before\nit blew into pieces behind him.\n\n\n\n"}}
