Set the Scanners in order to have a check out every 5 cicles&quot; \nand looking to Tucson said &quot;And our special Guest will have The Pit...&quot;\n\nThe Pit was a insolate cell, it was tiny, Jsut a bot could be inside; \nShanckles for arms and legs hanged in the walls, allowing a limited movement \nof the prisioner; it hadnt no comunication to exterior and just a machine \nthat in the proper schedule serves some food and drink. the light always was \nlow and only increased when a guard comes to see the prisioner. Every few \nminutes, a scan take the signature of who was in the Pit. If someone break \nout, the entire area sorrounded the Pit was insolated and  lasers start to \nopen fire. Only someone external could opend and free the Prisioner and \nHydras knew that\n\nPerceptor motioned to Scourge and Pushed Nightshift and Kup, and headed them \nto the normal cell areas. In a point of the trip, Perceptor took Kup and \nmoved him in another corritor. After few, turns they arrived to a cell, \nPerceptor hit Kup stunning him after that  Perceptor remove the handcuffs \nand pushed Kup trought the cell, and locked him up.\n\nMeanwhile, Hydras looking to Tucson said to his PRedacons &quot;Cover his eyes!!! \nAnd follow me, &quot;Then he send a private messages to Cyclonus&quot; Cyclonus, go to \nthe throne Room and take the lady with you... Be glente, she&#39;s one of us, I \nwant that you keep an eye in her while Perceptor is busy here... If \nsomething happens her, you will pay for that, understood?&quot;\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nFrom: &quot;Preston Carroll&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\nSent: Thursday, April 15, 2010 11:22 AM\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: BlackFortress\n\n&gt; Who: CYCLONUS, SCOURGE, Hydras, Perceptor, Kup, Tuscon Prime, Nightshift\n&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Security Holding Cells\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hydras smiled Evilish and he said&quot;Not Only Rodimus will keeping an eye in \n&gt;&gt; you... Every single predacon will do it&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus, and at a gesture from him Scourge as well followed Hydras\n&gt; and the Autobots down the halls towards the holding cells, his optics\n&gt; glancing at each of the prisoners in turn.\n&gt;\n&gt; The walk itself was generally uneventful. There were a few jabs from\n&gt; the Decepticon and predacon escorts here and there and a few misteps\n&gt; and quips from the prisoners, but for the most part went without\n&gt; incident.\n&gt;\n&gt; As they walked Cyclonus hung back slightly as he held conversations\n&gt; with different ones on his radio. At some points he seemed to be\n&gt; talking with Jhiaxus and/or Scorponok, but at other times he was\n&gt; talking with others whos names were not given in conversation. His\n&gt; voice was low, but it was obvious he was giving orders of different\n&gt; types.\n&gt;\n&gt; As they arrived at the main cell block area, thick heavy doors rumbled\n&gt; as magnalocks disengaged and the doors slid open. It was obvious that\n&gt; they were heavy, and designed to hold back a hoard of Dinobots!\n&gt;\n&gt; The room itself while large was generally spartan, with only a few\n&gt; security screens positioned around a central control panel and sitting\n&gt; area for anyone that wanted to act as a guard. The walls were\n&gt; generally gunmetal grey thick pieces of bulkhead, that at first glance\n&gt; looked impervious to the most firepower. There did not appear to be\n&gt; any easily accessed vent shafts here for anything larger then an earth\n&gt; insect, and no obvious power leads or electrical conduits, except to\n&gt; the central panels in the center of the room. Even the light poanels\n&gt; that came the room illuminated were recessed into the walls and\n&gt; ceiling and were covered by transparent material which was not quite\n&gt; glass.\n&gt;\n&gt; Around the room were the doors to the indicidual cells, each cell\n&gt; could have bars slide over its entrance, a full security door, a force\n&gt; field or a combination of any of the three. Off to one side another\n&gt; door led to a room that Tuscon was already familiar with - the\n&gt; interrogation room.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus walked over to the control panel as he prepared to open\n&gt; different cells, &quot;At your command Hydras.&quot; he said, waiting for Hydras\n&gt; to choose which cells he wanted the prisoners in.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: I went ahead and described the room since Hydras has been having\n&gt; Cyclonus do security upgrades. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
