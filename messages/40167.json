I need you to \nscout a path so as to avoid enemy activity. Go.&quot; He finishes giving \nStratus orders, and turns to the Stunticons, &quot;Well Breakdown, \nsince the ship&#39;s underwater, I think you know the answer to that.&quot; \nHe shakes his head and continues, &quot;Motormaster, form Menasor. \nWhen all of the Terrorcons are here, we&#39;ll have Abominus speed up \nthe process.&quot; He thinks to himself, &lt;welll, hopefully the stupid bot \nwill follow orders without too much trouble...&gt;\n\nDead-End and Drag Strip nod, and look to Motormaster for the \ntransformation cue.\n\nTurning to Cyclonus, he gives the ariel bot some orders, \n&quot;Cyclonus, you are going to patrol the airways while we move the \nship. If you see any disturbances report immediately so that we \nmay take care of them. Oh, and don&#39;t get out of our sight, we need \nto have backup if any enemy targets show up to try to stop our \nprogress.&quot; His curt nod indicates that he is finished with Cyclonus, \nand he looks at the other bots present.\n\nRippersnapper thinks hard to himself, and for once (maybe twice) \nin his life, he said something that made sense, &quot;Sinnertwin, You \nscrew up, Megatron not be happy.&quot; He waits impatiently for other \nTerrorcons to arrive so that they may form Abominus.\n\n"}}
