Your posts are very hard to read when they&#39;re stuffed with \naction like that. Also, firing the shot limit at like 5 bots is legal \nbut un-realistic. I&#39;m not saying its not allowed, but its kinda cheap.\n\nAlso, Starlight&#39;s darts are tranquilizer darts. If Orion was hit with \nthem, he&#39;d be falling asleep quickly.\n\n::Astral/Starlight/Fenox/Perndabot/FZ/Prowl::\n\nAstral ducks under several nails, one of them digging into his \nshoulder. He growls, firing several shots at Torca.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStarlight flipps out her charge launcher, blowing the missile that was \nfired at her apart. The shockwave from the explosion sends her flying \nbackwards.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot gets to his feet, his energy levels returning to normal. He \nlooks up at the blue energy field and fires. The missile shuts off \nwhen it goes through the field, falling harmlessly to the ground.\n\nPerndabot turns back to Ratchet, firing a missile at the bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFenox dodges the missile, smiling at her success when several shots \nhim her in the back. Enraged, she spins around and fires several shots \nat Ratchet.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl pulls up sharply right before he hits the ground. FZ lands \nbehind him, firing another energy-draining missile at Prowl. The \nMaximal lands, blowing the missile apart from a safe distance.\n\n&quot;How about a one on one, Zardus?&quot; asks Prowl as he walks forward, \neager to try out his new body. FZ laughs, also stepping forward.\n\n&quot;If you want to die that badly,&quot; FZ replies, waiting for Prowl to make \nthe first move. The two bots were only three feet away from each \nother.\n\nProwl lunges forward with a punch. Instantly reacting, FZ knocks the \npunch off-course with a quick block, followed by a punch into Prowl&#39;s \nribs.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Sorry about the comment Cyberwolf.

He is starting to leak mech \nfluid. \n&gt; He fires 5 nails at Astral, 5 at Recklessa, 5 at Dark One, 5 at \nSixshot and 5 \n&gt; at Breakdown.  Starlight&#39;s darts hit Orion and and Orion dodges Dark \nClaw&#39;s \n&gt; missles and destroys Double Punches missles and gets hit by 2 \nstinger \n&gt; missles.  he fires 1 missle at Starlight, 1 at Dark Claw, 12 optic \nblasts at \n&gt; Injector, and 13 optic blasts in where he hoped Double Punch was.  \nRatchet \n&gt; dodges Perndabots missles and gets hit by the rifle shots and 3 \nstinger \n&gt; missles.  He fires 8 shots and 1 tusk missle at Fenox, 8 shots at \nBumblebee, \n&gt; and 9 shots and 1 tusk missle at Scavenger.  Sky Lynx gets hit by 2 \nof the \n&gt; fireballs, and was slightly losing energy.  He fired 2 missles form \neach gun \n&gt; at Pyro.  Sideswipe got hit by ten of the laser blasts and 6 of the \nshots and \n&gt; fires 1 missles and 13 shots at Flesh Ripper, and 1 m\n\n\n"}}
