I\n&gt; recieved a message from Lunarpine. He wants me to tell the maximals that\n&gt; something is big and ugly and will arrive here soon. Veratis, you in\nhere?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -OM--------------\n&gt; &gt;Lunarpine still didn&#39;t like the monster before him. The freak of nature\nwas\n&gt; &gt;the ugliest thing he&#39;d seen since he&#39;d landed. &quot;You still haven&#39;t said\nwhy\n&gt; &gt;you&#39;re here.&quot; he says stating the obvious.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Megaton waved off the wolf like he didn&#39;t exist. &quot;I must be going, I have\n&gt; &gt;business at your base.&quot; he turned his back and added &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I meant\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt;Maximals base.&quot; He spread his wings again and flew toward the\nCybertronian\n&gt; &gt;fires scanning range.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Lunarpine transformed to wolf mode and started chaseing the mutant. He\n&gt; &gt;opened his mind to Ice, knowing any comm would be intercepted by the\n&gt; &gt;monster\n&gt; &gt;above.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Ice, if you can hear me, warn the Maximals that something big and ugly\n&gt; &gt;with\n&gt; &gt;big sharp teeth is flying that way.&quot; He thought, hoping that he was in\nher\n&gt; &gt;range.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
