She had a slight smile slip across her \nhe face. She cold still read his mind even though he tried to hide \nhis thoughts. She was pleased that he liked her new form. \n\nShe looked at Veratis as he scanned her. She ws glad that the virus \nwasn&#39;t going to kill her or get her killed. &quot;That is good news. But \nwhat happens now?&quot;\nShe read his thoughts and the smile on her face dissappeared. She \ncould read the anger in his mind. She lower her body down and changed \ninto full bear mode. She took a step closer to Veratis. She put her \nthoughts in his head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t think that I was hurting \nyou. I was more afraid of what Lunarpine thought and didn&#39;t want to \nface that. I didn&#39;t think I could spread the virus as I was. I didn&#39;t \nknow it could have the effect that it could have. Or that it was \nputting anything it touched in jeopardy.&quot;\n\nShe nuzzled her huge head against Veratis shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I \nwon&#39;t do it again.&quot;\n\nShe turned and faced Lunarpine. She smiled again and filled his head \nwith thought of how much she cared for him and how much she had \nmissed him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
