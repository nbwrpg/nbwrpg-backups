Cyclonus&#39; striking form is\n&gt; standing in the middle of it, his weapons lashing out. Even though he\n&gt; seemed to firing rapidly in several different directions it is obvious\n&gt; that he is being careful not to hit anything that would bring the\n&gt; tunnel down on top of them.\n&gt;\n&gt; What Cyclonus is fighting was strange. It looked like some sort of\n&gt; insect like creature, like a cross between a spider and a Mantis. It\n&gt; had 10 legs, 6 for walking and 4 that ended in long sharp mantis like\n&gt; claws. However instead of a living chitinous shell, it was encased in\n&gt; yellow, red and orange armor, which looked disturbingly similar to\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; armor style. They were rocket launchers and laser cannons\n&gt; sitting on their frames, showing that they were definitely designed\n&gt; for war!\n&gt;\n&gt; Fortunately there was only one left, but there were several others\n&gt; just like it laying on the ground, as was Bruticus-X, Insecticon and\n&gt; Scourge. Cyclonus himself looked heavily damaged as he battled on, the\n&gt; look on his face said he was resigned to whatever fate this battle had\n&gt; in store for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We are the horde.&quot; the creature said as it raised its arms at\n&gt; Cyclonus, its claws out, &quot;You cannot resist us. You will become one\n&gt; with us, your technological distinctiveness with strengthen the hive.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You are not warrior, you are slaves to a beast! I shall give you what\n&gt; you do not deserve, a warrior&#39;s death!&quot; With that he fired, causing\n&gt; the creature to back up a step and then the fighting continued.\n&gt;\n&gt; *     *     *    *\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What is that Lord Sire?&quot; Inferno whispered to Hydras they crept up\n&gt; beside Hydras as they all could now see and hear what was going on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Iguanus grunted slightly as he readied his weapon, &quot;There&#39;s only one,\n&gt; it shouldn&#39;t be too hard.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Fractyl said nothing as he hung to the rear, not all that comfortable\n&gt; with battle, but still ready to carry out Hydras&#39; orders. But even he\n&gt; thought Iguanus was too sure of himself. If it was tough for Cyclonus,\n&gt; the creature had to be pretty strong.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
