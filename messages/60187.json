She perfectly happy \nwhen her dream changed. She woke up and looked around. She was Malice \nsleeping near her and she sighed. I have got to get rid of that bot \nsomeday, she thought to herself. She looked down and noticed a small \nbot had curled up next to her and was sleeping. Not wishing to wake \nthe child, she laid back down and went back to sleep. \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice stirred after a hour of sleeping soundly.  He rolled over to \nsee if Wolfblade was there, and sure enough, there she was.  He \nwatched over her fo a moment, listining to her breathing.  He rolled \nback over, satisfied.  He fell back asleep with his smug look still \non his face.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Malice awoke a hour after that, rolled over, and almost burst into \nlaughter.  Little baby Elita had curled up and was sleeping beside \nWolfblade.  He reached down and grabbed the alarm clock and turned \noff the sound.  He looked over the two a moment before rolling over \nand going to sleep again.\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; WOlfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She took the bed and lay down. She folded her hands behind her head \n&gt; and closed her optics. She smiled at his reaction. Sure she was \n&gt; flirting a bit. She stopped smiling and started to frown as she \n&gt; realized what was happening. She was starting to like him. She \nshook \n&gt; her head and told her self she would have to stop and right now.  \nShe \n&gt; remembered how many friends she had lost in the past wars.  She \n&gt; decided, for the sake of her and her new friend, she would not \nallow \n&gt; herself to get attatched.  She would have to stop having fun and \n&gt; start keeping her mind on the job. She rolled her head over and \n&gt; looked at the sleeping Malice. She smiled and thought how hard it \n&gt; would be to really stop liking him.  She closed her optics and went \n&gt; to sleep. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh yes!&quot; Malice said sarcastically,&quot;I have been dying to know \n&gt; that!  I didn&#39;t think I could go on without that information!  Oh, \n&gt; what a revelation.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Malice chuckled to himself and walked to his room.  He climbed in \n&gt; the hammock, sparing the bed if Wolfblade decided to accept the \nfree \n&gt; bed.  He wormed around in the net, finally getting comfotable.  He \n&gt; drifted to sleep shortly thereafter.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She decided perhaps he was right. &quot;Well, perhaps a nap. But back \nto \n&gt; &gt; your room? You just want to find out if I snore in wolf mode. \nThen \n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll have black mail material on me to hold against me the rest \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; my life. Well pal, I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t snore, so there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;In the name of God, I banish these souls of the evil undead into \n&gt; damnation.
