It was my means of transport as I came to your base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n After exiting HYDRAS ship he quickly shifted into his beast mode a\n&gt; large=\r\n dark blue transmetal dragon with ice blue highlights. He was\n&gt; every bit a=\r\ns large as HYDRAS himself, as his wings flexed outwards and\n&gt; caught the ai=\r\nr and began to rise.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile SKYSHADOW nodded as he glanced back at =\r\nFRACTYL who also he a\n&gt; slight nod. &quot;Your ship shall be as you left it.&quot; SK=\r\nYSHADOW said as he\n&gt; turned back to HYDRAS his smile ingraciating.\n&gt; \n&gt; As =\r\nthey rose higher into the air they could see CRYOTEK&#39;s ship just\n&gt; over the=\r\n next rise. His &#39;shuttle&#39; was actually a small cargo freighter\n&gt; designed f=\r\nor planatary landings. Smooth and areodynamic, it was built\n&gt; to take the r=\r\nigors of space but was able to easily penatrate the\n&gt; atmosphere of planets=\r\n as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The door of the ship was already opening as CRYOTEK, HYDRAS,=\r\n\n&gt; TARANTULUS, INFERNO came in for a landing. Behind them BRUTICUS X also\n&gt;=\r\n came, one of the guards that was used to watch over prisoners, as well\n&gt; a=\r\ns IGUANUS and WASPINATOR.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the cargo section of the ship there w=\r\nere CR chambers were\n&gt; stored, and even as CRYOTEK was leading the others i=\r\nnto the ship they\n&gt; were already begining to charge up, waking up their occ=\r\nupants as\n&gt; energy shunts were retracting. There was a click and a hiss as =\r\ndoors\n&gt; that had been closed for quite some time finally broke their seal a=\r\nnd\n&gt; began to open.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Occupants active.&quot; came the femenine voice of CRY=\r\nOTEK&#39;s computer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the chamber there were two protoforms sitting =\r\nin CR chambers,\n&gt; one black and the other clear, but most important there w=\r\nere two other\n&gt; CR chambers that were opening up, steam and other assorted =\r\ngasses\n&gt; billowing out as the occupant&#39;s optics began to glow with life.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; CYROTEK gestured to HYDRAS to enter the chamber, &quot;After you, meet your\n&gt;=\r\n new . . . or should I say old soldiers.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAt this ponit, as the =\r\nfirst stasis pod opened up in front of the approaching HYDRAS, there was a =\r\nshffting sound as the pod opened, gas escaping.\n\nOVer was a figure that loo=\r\nked familiar, yet not so, and yet was instantly identifiable.\n\nA bodyform t=\r\nhat would look familiar, that of Megatron&#39;s first transmetal form, but of a=\r\n darker coloration.\n\nThere spoke DINOBOT, &quot;It was said, beware of Greeks be=\r\naring gifts.&quot;\n\nDINOBOT glancing over at HYDRAS as he rose up and stood high=\r\n.  &quot;And I bow before you in service, LORD HYDRAS.&quot;  The Transmetalized, clo=\r\nned DINOBOT once again locked in the service of the one he had betrayed.\n\nT=\r\nhe other one was a familiar figure, perhaps one recognizable or not. That o=\r\nf an old lieutenant and subcommander.  VICE GRIP.\n\nPausing, as he rose up a=\r\nnd out of the tank, glancing over at HYDRAS, and his first words were, &quot;Wha=\r\nt..  Have you done with Lord Megatron?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
