DrillBit better not be thinking that he was in charge \nhere. Killfest wasn&#39;t sure who DarkMouse would side with, but she was \nthe only one he knew of that this base listened to, so she could very \nwell be the deciding factor in a civil war. Not that Killfest was \nplanning one.\n\n&quot;Yes, her death was rather unfortunate,&quot; he replies, looking over \nsome computer panels. The door opens and DarkMouse walks in with \nGoldeneye following her.\n\n&quot;Ok, I&#39;ll need a list of all the bots on our team, boss,&quot; DarkMouse \nsays, looking from DrillBit to Killfest with a smile on her face.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He makes it too the Bridge.\n&gt; &quot;I hoped for this chance for a long time.
