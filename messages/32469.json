His left \nhand dropped the arm of Dinobot and grabbed his face in pain. He \nrealed back abit but not enough to pull the sword from Dinobot. With \napplying abit of presure to the hilt of his sord he shot a giant \nstream of flame from the tip of the sword which was still impaled in \nDinobot.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Carnage Blood&quot; &lt;Carnage@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ( Carnage: Thank you for responding.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ** Gears strained to lift FireBlade, the transformer seemingly \nheavier then Dinobot had anticipated. However, the factor that its \nlife would be terminated none the less was still dominant, and with \nthat single thought present in his mind Dinobot raised his free hand, \nthe claw extended and ready to slit FireBlades throat and end his \nexistence.  Just ready to bring down the blade, something suddenly \noccurred to the transmetal two: the enemy was recovering...and a \nscann reviled, too late, that it was enough to move.  FireBlade \ncaught Dinobot&#39;s hand, even though the sharpness of his claws would \ndig into it, causing deep gashes. However, if there was surprise in \nhim, Dinobot failed to express it.  The sword caught the x-Predacon \nin the stomach and bit in deep, though inner organs and circuitry \nwere too heavily armored to be damaged fatally.  Dinobot snarled, \ndisgusted that FireBlade had given such damage. Snapping his free \nhand forward, claws extended, he slashed at the enemies face while \nsliding off of the tip of his blade, mech-fluid flowing freely from \nthe wound while a little trickled at the side of his mouth.  Such \ndamage could be repaired easily, however, finding the opportunity to \ntake the time was something else.**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at \nhttp://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
