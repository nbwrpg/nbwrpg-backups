I know just the thing too. By the way, I need you t=\r\no activate a holographic field on me. As far as Hydras knows, Night Shift h=\r\nas mutilated me to the point of irecognizable proportions. I need a hologra=\r\nm of me in a dismantled state of being. That should also draw out who&#39;s hid=\r\ning behind the cloaked field.
