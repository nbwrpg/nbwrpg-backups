Her optical scanners showed more\nactivity than an all you can eat resteraunt near a fat farm.  She\ninstinctively cloaked to hide her identity. She now appeared to be no larger\nthan a sparrow. She  took extra measures by flying low to the ground making\nherself appear to be an even more natural bird. The hawk landed on the\ncharred Spanish shore and scanned outward into the horizon. What she saw\nscared her. She detected a warship docked near an island miles offshore. She\nsaw the shield surrounding the base and knew that she was in for more than\nshe knew. She tried to transform but a twinge of pain shot through her. She\ntried again transforming to robot mode. She could see that the fur of her\nwolf mode, and feathers of her hawk mode hadn&#39;t changed like they had\nbefore. The femm placed a recorder under part of the charred beach and set\nthe message. &quot;I&#39;ve reached the shoreline, I&#39;m not sure if this is the right\nplace but it&#39;s security is very detailed. I&#39;m going in, I&#39;ll report next\ntime I get the chance.&quot; the bot didn&#39;t leave a name, she didn&#39;t want to lose\nany advantage if the message was intercepted. &quot;Relay message in one hour.&quot;\nShe left the instructions to allow her enough time to get away in case it&#39;s\nfound or intercepted.  Silver Scout again transformed to hawk mode and\nstarted flying out to sea.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, March 13, 2001 10:41 PM\nSubject: BlackFortress\n\n\n&gt; Dragonfly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dragonfly saw Blacknightmare and Orchestra left the room. &quot;Well&quot; said\n&gt; the male to Crater&quot;What do you rather? stay in base and rest or have\n&gt; agood fight?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
