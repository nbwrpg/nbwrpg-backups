Picking up one he was\n&gt; &gt; able to sen=\r\nd that hapless SHARKTICON sailing into several of his\n&gt; &gt; companions, all o=\r\nf them landing on the ground in a heap!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Up ahead SKYSHADOW and his=\r\n FUZORS were up ahead cutting a wide swath\n&gt; &gt; into the SHARKTICONS as well=\r\n. Thier ferocious attcks eating quickly\n&gt; &gt; into their numbers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ho=\r\nwever the battle was not over as still more SHARKTICONS were\n&gt; &gt; streaming =\r\nover to them led by their leader SKYBYTE, who like most\n&gt; &gt; proud DECEPTICO=\r\nn and PREDACON generals were was leading from the back!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Attack my=\r\n prcious armies, attack!&quot; He whooped in delight pushing the\n&gt; &gt; SHARKTICONS=\r\n forward!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; DINOBOT paused.  The SHARKTICONS seemed to b=\r\ne barely sentient, but reliant upon a general to give them orders ni battle=\r\n and direct them.  However, the GENERAL seemed to be content to hold back, =\r\nand fighting him directly would require simultaneously engaging him AND his=\r\n forces.  The DINOBOT of old would have relished such a challenge, but for =\r\nthis new incarnation, &#39;honor&#39; was the last thing on his processor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Goi=\r\nng to try and engage the SHARKTICONS group by gruop, attempting to thin dow=\r\nn thier numbers with hit and run tactics, counting that the groups would be=\r\n trying to pursue them to just overwhelm with numbers, and thus running int=\r\no one another and messing up their formations with each hit and run attack =\r\nof his own, trying to thin the herd.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, VICE GRIP was of a dif=\r\nferent mindset, just going to charge in directly over towards SKYBYTE!  Of =\r\ncourse, this would lead his charge right through the main cluster of SHARKT=\r\nICONS, and give them a golden opportunity to dogpile (or sharkpile) on him.=\r\n.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
