At the sighted angles of the enemy body, internal systems and years of hardcore war experience tracked which positions FireBlade&#39;s body would be in next and warned Dinobot of impending danger.  He knew that every attempt that the enemy made to resist the effects of paralysis were futile and he dodged his attack easily, however, the missiles had not missed the ground in which he had stood second before and on impact they sent shrapnel spiraling in every direction. A rather large piece piercing the armor which covered Dinobot&#39;s biceps before falling to the ground.\r\nThe transmetal raptor snarled at the small trickle of mech-fluid which emanated from the wound, only glancing at it before continuing on his way to the location of his downed prey. Approaching FireBlade from behind he looked the robot over, optics narrowed and searching for any movement which might betray this beings current state. Satisfied that this transformer was defeated yet alive, Dinobot clipped his weapon into a hip holster before leaning down quickly and going to grab the back of FireBlade&#39;s head with his clawed hand, then moving to pull back and lift so that the enemy would be lifted to face height. **\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
