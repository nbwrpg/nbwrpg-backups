Now, here is the plan. In a few days we&#39;ll all go on a \nscout mission at The Ark. You&#39;ll tell us which one is Ramulus. I than \nthreaten to kill you if he doesn&#39;t meet me one on one. If he does, \nStriker goes home. If he doesn&#39;t, Striker gets the chip. If Ramulus \ndoes meet me, than I give him the chip and use him as my middle man \nto control the Maximals! You may go. You can look at Striker all you \nwant. But if he wakes up, no mentioning of what I have just told you. \nThe only thing I will alow you to say is &quot;I am Master Prebon&#39;s now.&quot; \nAs soon as he wakes up tell me, so the torture can begin. No leaving \nthe ship without my permission and no helping him to escape!&quot; Prebon \nwas about to walk away, but he turned back.\n\n&quot;Oh, and I hope you know what you&#39;ve gotten yourself into. I said \nStriker would go. Not you. To save him you have sacrificed a future \nwith him. You could&#39;ve been with him forever, but you decided to sell \nout your friends and lose your love. Have a nice day!&quot;\n\nPrebon left her laughing.\n\n\n"}}
