Maaa=\r\nan talk about heavy intel.  There&#39;s no chance I&#39;m gonna get lost now.  Hmmm=\r\n, I might be able ta configure a safe short cut inta the fortress...  Any c=\r\nhance ya got the codes ta disable any security software I might have ta kno=\r\nw about?&quot;\n\nTucson waits patiently for Cheetor&#39;s news of clear passage as he=\r\n transforms into his vehicle mode, opening his doors to Lord Elder, and Tal=\r\non.  His engine rumbles at the start yet runs quietly after being started, =\r\nwhich was a signature trade mark of his previous vehicle form, who&#39;s engine=\r\n was barely even heard when standing idol.  Night Shift also gets into vehi=\r\ncle form, opening his doors to Windlord and Perceptor.  His engine silences=\r\n after being started yet remains idol.\n\n&quot; Night Shift, as soon as Cheetor c=\r\nomes back, and relays the intel, you will slowly advance into position with=\r\n Perceptor and Windlord.  Take your time, we are not rushing into this beca=\r\nuse the faster we travel, the faster we will raise suspicion.  Feel free to=\r\n take any path you wish.  If you wish to go off road, even better.  Try not=\r\n to kick up any dust on your tires if you can help it.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Gotchya.  If anyone can roll in silent mode, it&#39;s me.&quot;\n\nTucson then turn=\r\ns to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;If I can get everyone to move in slowly, we have a very goo=\r\nd chance of going unseen and unheard.  I also plan to send a mild sonar wav=\r\ne which should mask all our signatures, including those of Perceptors, by u=\r\nsing a signal configuration code.  I haven&#39;t tried doing that but I do know=\r\n my sonar system can work around various codes and configure a buffer that =\r\nwill not harm anyone who isn&#39;t under our signature.  If at any time, you fe=\r\nel that our plan is not working, feel free to intervine&quot;.\n\nQuickstride then=\r\n turns to Lord Elder and Rodimus.\n\n&quot;I should definitely be able to smell tr=\r\nouble if it comes.  And don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t let anyone down.  Just to let =\r\nyou guys know, I work better in beast form, since that&#39;s where all my sense=\r\ns are.  Well, I better get out there&#39;n start patrol duty.  You&#39;ll know wher=\r\ne ta find me.  QUICKSTRIDE, MAXIMIZE!&quot;  \n\nWith that he gets into his equine=\r\n mode and walks out instead of bolting out of the Ark, to keep suspcions lo=\r\nw.  He sniffs the ground and as part of the illusion, nibbles at a few blad=\r\nes of grass.  Yet, his ears remain focused on the task at hand as does his =\r\neyes and nose.  He raises his head while nibbling, remaining still and doin=\r\ng what horses do best, which was staying still, and occasionally lowering t=\r\nheir heads for a few snips of grass.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super =\r\nCyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; We begin now. But=\r\n we are not going to charge into battle, seeing that\n&gt; &gt; Hydras may suspect=\r\n our movements. Cheetor, I trust your instincts to the\n&gt; &gt; fullest, what I&#39;=\r\nd like you to do, is scout the parameters first. Once you\n&gt; &gt; determine if =\r\nthe coast is clear, relay that to me, and then, we will\n&gt; slowly\n&gt; &gt; move i=\r\nnto position in the areas Cheetor deems fit. I also suggest we go in\n&gt; &gt; se=\r\nperate teams. Several at a time, spread out, and go unseen. Rat Trap,\n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nindlord, you will travel with Night Shift, seeing that he is well versed\n&gt; =\r\nin\n&gt; &gt; stealth combat. He will get you to the fortress quietly, and under t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; noses of our enemy.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift turns to Perceptor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot; That&#39;s cool with me. Perceptor, if ya could, send me a download of the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; base parameters, so I know where I&#39;m drivn&#39;. If I get lost, I could get\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; distracted, and then we&#39;re in really deep scrap. The key ta how I opera=\r\nte\n&gt; &gt; is me keepn&#39; my mind on where it has ta be.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride loo=\r\nks to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; If ya don&#39;t mind, I think you better station me ou=\r\ntside, on top of the\n&gt; &gt; Ark, so I can keep an ear out for trouble. That wa=\r\ny, if something happens,\n&gt; &gt; I can alert you guys.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson&#39;s expres=\r\nsion becomes as Resulte as Rodimus&#39;s. Now it was time, it\n&gt; &gt; was time to s=\r\nhow Hydras that with the strength of faith and unity, no\n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; power =\r\ncould overshadow the Maximal&#39;s or the Autobots greatest attributes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &lt;CUT/SNIP&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson turns to Cheetor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Cheetor, you may=\r\n begin.

Starting to downlo=\r\nad &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Perceptor sends the information, Cheetor, standing beside =\r\nRodimus, was\n&gt; there to accept it. Rodimus had slid into a console chair be=\r\nside Lord Elder.\n&gt; It would be these two, Quickstride, legacy and two medic=\r\ns to hold the Ark\n&gt; should anything happen.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thanks Perceptor.&quot; Cheeto=\r\nr said, a sour look on his face. While he\n&gt; appreciated the information fro=\r\nm the ex-predacon, it would still be some\n&gt; time before he got used to him =\r\ntrying to be a Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked over at Tuscon, &quot;I will be there as =\r\nsoon as my legs can carry me!&quot;\n&gt; With that Cheetor ran towards the door, &quot;C=\r\nheetor, MAXIMIZE!&quot; he shifted into\n&gt; his sleek transmetal cheetah mode and =\r\nbegan his trek across the open\n&gt; territories between he and Hydras&#39; base.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Meanwhile Rodimus watched his progress on the scanner, &quot;That is one fas=\r\nt\n&gt; cat.&quot; He said, shaking his head, obviously impressed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder l=\r\neaned backj in his chiar glancing over at Quickstride, &quot;We would\n&gt; be happy=\r\n to have you on patrol outside. You never know if any Predacon or\n&gt; even a =\r\nUnicronian can show up while everyone is gone.&quot; Elder looked down as\n&gt; a li=\r\nght on his console beeped.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Cheetor arrives at Hydras&#39; =\r\nbase next post!\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
