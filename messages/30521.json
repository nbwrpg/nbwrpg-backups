They are his now, and \ntogether,\n&gt; they will conquer this world, he thinks to himself. He gets off of\n&gt; Astroblast and Drag Strip, and motion for them to follow, and he \nflies off\n&gt; the cliff, and lands in the middle of the \nDecepticons. &quot;Motormaster, Status\n&gt; report&quot; he blurts without emotion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Motormaster walks towards the group. &quot;Mighty Megatron, our ship has \na full\n&gt; stack of Energon cubes for our disposal. Scourge, Cyclonus, \nTriggerhappy,\n&gt; and the Terrorcons and Skullgrin are now part of the Decepticon \ntroops,\n&gt; loyal to you. That is Switchblade&quot; he says, pointing to the small \nrobot,\n&gt; and then pointing to the Bodicons finishes, &quot;and those are the \nBodicons.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron bends down, and picks up his fusion cannon. While hooking \nit back\n&gt; up to his arm he starts. &quot;Yes, I remember Cyclonus and Scourge, I \nsaw you\n&gt; work through Galvatron&#39;s eyes. You were loyal to him, can I count \non that\n&gt; kind of loyalty ?&quot; he asks.\n\n\n"}}
