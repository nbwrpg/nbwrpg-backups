I was thinking \nabout the\n&gt; long term effects of the DNA merging, This planet is rich in \nenergeon, you\n&gt; could control the fight by controling the best creatures to mine \nit.&quot; she\n&gt; looked around the room as if she were talking to a group instead of \nan\n&gt; individual, &quot;These creations could well be the next generation of\n&gt; transformer.&quot; the female tried remembering her history lessons, \n&quot;When I was\n&gt; newly created my home galaxy was overrun by insecticons, some \nplanets were\n&gt; stripped clean of life while the insecticons avoided other more \nlively\n&gt; planets altogether. A scientist looked into the problem and realized \nthat\n&gt; the planets that were avoided were full of avian life that lived off \ninsect\n&gt; life. The insecticons took on the survival instincts of the \ncreatures they\n&gt; turned into. The logical solution was to create avian modes for our\n&gt; translife.&quot; she paused trying to speak without revealing to much. \n&quot;Anyway\n&gt; the point is that everything has a predator and prey. I hope to \ncombine\n&gt; those qualities and remove most of the psy\n\n\n"}}
