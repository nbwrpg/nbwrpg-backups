She \nbrought up her gun and fired off three shots of her missles at him, \nso anyway he dodged he would still be hit. While moving her wrist, \nshe accidently pushed something and a small reloadable dart came out, \nset on a small launcher. She looked at it and shrugged, setting one \nto fire at GodFather, so it joined her other blasts.\n\n(The dart she just discovered is actually a fast working posion)\n\n\n"}}
