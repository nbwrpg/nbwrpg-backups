Thanks tot he huge raging energon and\n&gt; explosive fueled fire that the trio were left with, even enhanced senses\n&gt; would be of no use now over against the raging brush fire about the jungle.\n&gt; At least, that was BLACKARACHNIA&#39;S thought in it as she used her beast mode\n&gt; to head away along the trees, hopefully obscured against the darkness while\n&gt; she let her autorepair system work over on her damaged cloak system.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nKILLER PUNCH sagged against a tree for a moment his energies on a low\nebb. It would be obvious only now that his last stance against\nBLACKARACHNIA was a bluff. Had she pushed it he definitely would have\nfolded.\n\nLooking down at BAZOOKA and GUILE DART he kicked at them as they were\nslowly coming around as their reserves kicked in. &quot;Stupid insects set\noff a fire!&quot; KILLER PUNCH said. &quot;We&#39;ve got to go. Now!&quot;\n\nGUILE DART climbed slowly to his feet as BAZOOKA tried to do much the same.\n\n&quot;Where to?&quot; BAZOOKA said. &quot;Magmatron is insane with power now and\nSaberback is the one pushing the buttons.&quot;\n\nLooking around for a moment GUILE DART shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know, but we\ncan&#39;t stay here in the fire.&quot;\n\nThe trio began to trudge away, opposite the direction that BLACKARACHNIA took.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
