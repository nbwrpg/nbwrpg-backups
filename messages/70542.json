A bit un nerved, but not frightened enough to \n&gt;&gt; turn back and run. Instead, he would press on, and while doing so, while \n&gt;&gt; holding Vestige in one arm, as his strength could allow him, with the \n&gt;&gt; other arm, he reaches for a spare emergency canister of energon which he \n&gt;&gt; had saved for dire need. This was that dire need. He opens it, and holds \n&gt;&gt; it for Vestige to drink from it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; I don&#39;t know where we can find a repair chamber, but this should help \n&gt;&gt; you find just a little bit more energy. It&#39;s my last reserve, but you \n&gt;&gt; need this more than I do. Here, drink, it&#39;s energon, and it will help you \n&gt;&gt; keep some energy in your body.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At the same time, Tucson was keeping an ear out for the metallic spiders \n&gt;&gt; and insects. His pace steady, as he continues to walk forward, keeping \n&gt;&gt; his headlights a blaze to light his way.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;We&#39;ll get through this Vestige, I promise you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vestige&#39;s systems flicker and sputter as Tuscon feeds him the energon\n&gt; and then with a small burst of energy his optics brighten. &quot;Thank you\n&gt; Tuscon.&quot; he said, his voice horse and raspy but clearer than before.\n&gt; It is obvious that although Vestige is doing a little better he is\n&gt; still in need of repairs. For some reason his self repair circuits do\n&gt; not seem to be healing as effeciently as they should.\n&gt;\n&gt; He nods as Tuscon promised to get them through, &quot;I . . . I don&#39;t know\n&gt; why, but I feel as if I can trust you.&quot; he says, his voice weak but\n&gt; still clear. With a shaky arm he points further down the path that\n&gt; Tuscon is taking them, &quot;There is where I must go, down there. The\n&gt; chamber where I need to be sits there.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The direction that Vestige points is simply a long hallways, that\n&gt; after maybe 30 yards or so bends around a corner and apparently\n&gt; continues on. There are doors on either side of the hall at different\n&gt; points, and lights on the cieling illuminate the hall ahead. So far\n&gt; there is no evidence of insects, and whatever scraping noise that was\n&gt; heard before seems to be much further away.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vestige climbes unsteadily to his feet, and much like an old man\n&gt; attempts to hobble slowly down the hall, seemingly focused on the task\n&gt; ahead. &quot;Come.&quot; he says, his voice weak, but now filled with a grim\n&gt; determination.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
