He wasn&#39;t a bot for \nspeed or that much endurance. He could follow a bot for miles following \ntheir tracks and their signatures, but running after them wasn&#39;t such a good \nidea. He was just too worried that Stingtra would just get herself into \ntrouble again. Then it would be his hide Megatron would have.\n\nHe coughed and looked around, searching for the sight of Stingtra. He knew \nshe was around, sensing her signature near-by.\n\n&quot;Stingtra?&quot; A part of him told him go back to the cave and leave her the \nInferno alone. If she choose to hurt herself, it was her fault.\n\nBut he had a thing for females.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
