Feeling a bit woozy from the loose of mech fluid and her systems not in the best condition she decided to stop, tiredness and the loose of fluid adding together to create a feeling like she was about to keel over.\nBut then she looked over at Prowl with a very tired look on her face, the fact that she had strained to keep her Second Beast Mode active and withstand the damage she did causing this.\nBut then she strained and straightened her posture as best she could, doing a fairly poor job of hiding the pain she felt.\nBut with an admired amount of effort she gave Prowl a slight/tired smile.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m...fine. Just a few...scratches. Nothing big.&quot;\n\n* With that she then looked back over at Striker and Liono, it was time that they got to that meeting that Liono had called earlier. Not to mention that there was still the feud between Ramhorn and Plintissa to resolve.\nIron Raptor knew that she was in no real condition to attend a meeting but she had told Ramhorn and company that she would help solve his problem and she wasn&#39;t about to let him down. The Maximals came before herself...always.\nWith that look she then turned towards the base, the action causing her to clench her teeth and force back a particularly loud snarl. But with determination and a plain amount of force she then began to walk towards the Ark...her progress slow and limping, the mech fluid from her side running down her hip and leg but she tried to her best ability to ignore it.*\n\n&quot; We best be getting to the...meeting before the bots left there...scrap the place.&quot;\n\n* Her words were plain but pained, she just hoped that Prowl wouldn&#39;t rag on her too much for not simply going to a CR chamber first.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
