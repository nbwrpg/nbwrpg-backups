When he suposed \nto be a soldier here, he was treated as a prisioner. That wasn&#39;t the \nway he wanted things to turn out. He wanted to be Black Arachnia&#39;s \npartner.\n&gt; \n&gt; He heard Dark Mouse&#39;s voice in comm-link. &quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; he replied to \nher. &quot;Ya jus&#39; do whatever she says an&#39; behave yerself. Ask &#39;er when \nshe&#39;s gonna get back t&#39; me so ah can get outta this dang confinement. \nAh hate bein&#39; cooped up like this. Brings back memories.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He looked around. It was almost like a while back when he berayed \nMegatron and got caught. They had him in a confinement until he was \nput up on trial. It gave him the creeps. He wanted to get out of this \nnow. He was getting nervous.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Kick off your party with Yahoo! Invites.\n\n\n"}}
