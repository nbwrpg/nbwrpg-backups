There \nwill be an armed garrison and an entry way for you to enter the Otyebis where \nyou will be alerted of ground rules.  If you do not comply you will be \nimprisoned.  If you break any of the rules you will be imprisoned, put on \ntrial, and possibly executed.  Thank you.&quot;\n\n(Where you land there will be about twenty different IGL guards in gold and \nred uniforms of various species)\n\n"}}
