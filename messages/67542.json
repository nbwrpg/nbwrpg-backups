In front of him\n&gt; several view screens sat d=\r\nepicting the scene of a battle before him,\n&gt; the figures easily recognizabl=\r\ne to anyone who had been watching up to\n&gt; this point: Azureblade and Animus=\r\n. To the side of the screen numbers\n&gt; and graphs depicted the energy readin=\r\ngs and power fluxuations that were\n&gt; being detected.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Interesting.&quot; Ca=\r\nme the deep almost metallic sounds of Vorpal&#39;s voice.\n&gt; &quot;Do you have all th=\r\nat you require Krytek.&quot; Vorpal turned ever so\n&gt; slightly to take in the tal=\r\nl and some might even say imposing form\n&gt; standing off to the side.\n&gt; \n&gt; Si=\r\ntting at a console, the deep shadows of this chamber masks many of\n&gt; Krytek=\r\n&#39;s features, only the lights from his faceplate are visible as\n&gt; they blink=\r\n on and off. &quot;Negative.&quot; Krytek&#39;s voice is cold as he speaks,\n&gt; &quot;However th=\r\ne scans are nearly complete. The X4 unit is operating within\n&gt; its design s=\r\npecification, but it was not originally manufactured for\n&gt; this purpose.&quot; K=\r\nrytek depressed a few more keys on his console, &quot;It is\n&gt; also unlikely that=\r\n Animus will survive long enough to complete our\n&gt; tests. He will require a=\r\nssistance.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vorpal&#39;s clawed fingers stilled their tapping for a moment=\r\n as the\n&gt; unicronian general paused thoughtfully. &quot;Perhaps this intruder co=\r\nuld\n&gt; use a bit more ... stimulus.&quot; His voice displayed just the slightest\n=\r\n&gt; touch of humor. &quot;Begin phase 2.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Understood.&quot; Krytek responded simp=\r\nly as he turned to his console, \n&gt; quickly weapon system displays were brou=\r\nght up ... \n&gt; \n&gt; Somewhere above them, on the surface of the moon a single =\r\nmissile\n&gt; launcher rose from a hidden location, turned to orient on some fi=\r\nxed\n&gt; point and abruptly launched a rather large missile into the faint\n&gt; a=\r\ntmosphere of the moon. The missile quickly flared, shot forward and\n&gt; withi=\r\nn moments is gone from sight, even as the missile launcher itself\n&gt; began l=\r\nowering itself out of view.\n&gt; \n&gt; (See more after Nic&#39;s Insert)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Nic=\r\n &lt;warriorazure@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Azureblade was caught by the blinding bea=\r\nm, but he stayed calm as his\n&gt; &gt; sword and Animus`s locked together.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Azureblade: Now, you die.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His jammed optics eerily sought out A=\r\nnimus&#39;s face and the predatory\n&gt; &gt; grin slowly turned into a savage laugh.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unexpectedly, the attack started elsewhere than where Animus was\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; looking.
