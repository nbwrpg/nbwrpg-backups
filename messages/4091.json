How did TM3 Volois know of the mind erasing device??\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; TM3 Vulois could see it in the distance: The Predacon ship. And he \n&gt; knew how he would get in. But he hopes they don&#39;t detect him. This \n&gt; signal masker only has a few cycles left of energy. He finds the\nair \n&gt; vent, opens it up and starts crawling through, putting the vent\nback \n&gt; in place. Being a Predacon, he could normally just enter the base. \n&gt; But Hell Beast would see his new body and would start asking \n&gt; questions. Questions he didn&#39;t want to answer. Besides, he wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; be a Predacon for much longer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Acording to my scanners, the machine is right here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois opens up the vent which leads into Scorponok&#39;s lab. On one\nof \n&gt; the table&#39;s he sees a box with a big button on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes. With this box I can whipe DarkMouse&#39;s program and re-program \n&gt; her to serve myself and Soundwave! I will make her a TM3 and she \nwill \n&gt; aide us in the ruling of Cybertron!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Just then his internal computer talked to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Signal Masker has gone offline.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh Crap! Now he&#39;s gotta get out of here. The Preds can see his \n&gt; signature. He hopes he won&#39;t encounter any on the way out.\n\n\n"}}
