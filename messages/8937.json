He puts each of them in seperate \n&gt; cells, and covers the entraces with a soundproof shield so they \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; communicate with each other. Before that Octociz came forward and \n&gt; removed there transmiters. Octociz looked to Rex and Firearm.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You guys can do what you want now. We worked pretty good as a \nteam, \n&gt; but I got to go to the CR Chamber, so that I can meet Ramulus at my \n&gt; pod.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Octociz/Brix heads to the other side of the ship and enters the CR \n&gt; Chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois was pacing in the embassy, worried. Last night he was \nsupposed \n&gt; to get a check-in from everybody. Now he&#39;s wondering if his plan \n&gt; failed before it even began. He sent a message.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Battera, Cybershark and Soundwave. Are you okay? Please give me a \n&gt; statis report. I need to know if you&#39;re okay.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois began pacing again.\n\n\n"}}
