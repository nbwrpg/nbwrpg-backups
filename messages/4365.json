The sun was a few \nhours from setting and Scorponok hadn&#39;t returned from the old Predacin base.\n\nShe hailed Quickstrike on his commlink.\n&quot;Hey, Quickstrike,  this is DarkMouse.  Have you seen Scorponok lately? He \nhas been gone hours and not returned form the old Pred base yet.  I wonder \nif he is hurt or ran into one of the unfriendly&#39;s.  If you see him, tell him \nI need his help on some of the computer systems will ya.&quot;\n\nShe waited for Quickstrike to respond.  She stood at the main enterance to \nthe cave.  The wind was just barely blowing and the sky was starting to \ndarken in the east.  She hoped that the others would return to the cave \nbefore dark so she could arm the auto-defence systems.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
