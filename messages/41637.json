Rumble wanted some kind of\naction after so many years of imprisonment. He had waited for three\nhundred years, he wasnt looking forward to waiting any longer. He took a\nstep forward to leap up, and transformed, but stopped, and listened\ncarefully. \n\n&quot;Soun, Soundwave, you hear that?&quot; he asked cheerfully. &quot;It&#39;s someone\nwho&#39;s looking for some Decepticons. Let me and Frenzy go meet him.&quot;\nRumble said, demanding instead of asking, as he looked up to the large\nDecepticon Comunicator.\n\n"}}
