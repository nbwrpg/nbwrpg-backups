He snarled as he slammed his tail into the back of her knees... \nHe breathed hard but was alive with the action of the battle.                \n                                              If Tavatron was a true enemy \nthen we would finish the move and slash his claws across her throat, thus \nending her life! But this was a practice battle, as intense as it was it was \nstill just a test of skill.\nDinobot roared...*\n\n&quot; You fight well, your skill surprises me.&quot;\n\n* Usually his enemies would either have been running or dead by the time of \nhis second blow but he was shocked at how Tavatron had held on. There was \nmuch potential in her yet!*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
