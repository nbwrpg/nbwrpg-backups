He gasped, as if she was suffocating, then bolted \ninto the hallway. She ran off until she was a distance away from the \ncommotion. She had forgotten about the presents of other bots. It made her \nedgy and go into a defensive mood. The only time she came into contact with \nother bots was when they were out to kill her. Both Predacon and Maximal \nwere after her. The Predacons were the ones that tracked her, until no end. \nThey had turned her into nothing but a mess of a bot. She had lost sleep, \nhad to always be on the move, watch every shape and shadow in the forest, \nand fight the awful memories.\n\nShe grasped her chest and leaned against the corridor, holding herself up \nwith one hand. She wanted so bad to go back to the forest, she was close the \npoint of screaming. But her logic bot insticts told her to go with business \nand find out about Megatron and his Predacons she once belonged to. She felt \nlike she would fall to the floor, with the weakness of herself. Not physical \nweakness, but mental weakness.\n\nShe ducked her head and let out a strangled scream between her clentched \nteeth.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
