I must&#39;ve ended up there so m=\r\nany times that I lost count.  But it wasn&#39;t for stupid reasons, usually bec=\r\nause of freak ambush attempts by Decepticon speedsters.  I sure hated those=\r\n guys, I wasn&#39;t as fast as they were and they knew it.  So of course they&#39;d=\r\n always chose me as their target.  Ratchet was aware of that, and he never =\r\ngot agitated when I came in.  But what was worse, I&#39;d never hear the end of=\r\n it from Sunstreaker and Sideswipe.  Slag, those two were always rank&#39;n on =\r\nme.  But I tried ta ignore &#39;em.  Then one day, Ohh this is sweet, one day i=\r\nt happened again and I wound back up in Ratchet&#39;s office. Tucson was mak&#39;n =\r\na delivery of supplies before he got shot blind, and those two were pull&#39;n =\r\ntheir scrap on me.  Well, not only did he hear them, he saw them do&#39;n it an=\r\nd slag, you didn&#39;t wanna be around Tucson that time, because he had the loo=\r\nk of destruction in his eyes.  Now mind ya, they knew better not ta scrap a=\r\nround with him because he&#39;d slag &#39;em real good if they did.  All they had t=\r\na do was look into his optics and they turned around and apologized ta me w=\r\nithout a single word outa Tucson&#39;s mouth.  After that, it never happened ag=\r\nain.&quot;\n\nHe sighs gently.\n\n&quot; Happy ta say that there was never any ridicule e=\r\nver said about anyone after that.  Optimus was glad about that, so he let T=\r\nucson&#39;s temper slide somewhat.  It kept the speedsters in line and guys lik=\r\ne us, Hound, Trail Breaker, and Beach Comber were happy not ta get ranked o=\r\nn because of our lack of speed.  And definitely no one ever messed with Rat=\r\nchet.  Ohh no, that was considered taboo.

Tuc=\r\nson was mak&#39;n a delivery of supplies before he got shot blind, and those tw=\r\no were pull&#39;n their scrap on me. &nbsp;Well, not only did he hear them, he =\r\nsaw them do&#39;n it and slag, you didn&#39;t wanna be around Tucson that time, bec=\r\nause he had the look of destruction in his eyes. &nbsp;Now mind ya, they kn=\r\new better not ta scrap around with him because he&#39;d slag &#39;em real good if t=\r\nhey did. &nbsp;All they had ta do was look into his optics and they turned =\r\naround and apologized ta me without a single word outa Tucson&#39;s mouth. &nbs=\r\np;After that, it never happened again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He sighs g=\r\nently.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Happy ta say that there was never any rid=\r\nicule ever said about anyone after that. &nbsp;Optimus was glad about that,=\r\n so he let Tucson&#39;s temper slide somewhat. &nbsp;It kept the speedsters in =\r\nline and guys like us, Hound, Trail Breaker, and Beach Comber were happy no=\r\nt ta get ranked on because of our lack of speed. &nbsp;And definitely no on=\r\ne ever messed with Ratchet. &nbsp;Ohh no, that was considered taboo. &nbsp;=\r\nMaan I sure miss those times.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpetually on the move and co=\r\nnstantly busy.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Jul 21, 2011, at 3:11 AM, Airshadow N=\r\nightstar &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002@...&quot;&gt;airly2002@...=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n =\r\n     \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;\n\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;C=\r\nalibri&#39;;COLOR: #000000;FONT-SIZE: 12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Nightlight:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m very lucky to have Rodimus in my life=E2=\r\n=80=9Dsaid Nightlight =E2=80=9CThat and the \nbirth of Elita were the best t=\r\nhings that happened in my life=E2=80=9D&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: nor=\r\nmal;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;;COLOR: #000000;FONT-SIZE: small;FONT-WEIGHT: nor=\r\nmal;TEXT-DECORATION: none;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt tahoma;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font =\r\nsize=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #=\r\nf5f5f5;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a title=3D&quot;magicquartz@...&quot; href=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:magicquartz@...&quot;&gt;Sandy Panico&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sent:&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday=\r\n, July 19, 2011 8:50 AM&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;To:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a title=3D&quot;nbwrpg@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject:&lt;/b&gt; Re:=\r\n MEdic Bay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-STY=\r\nLE: normal;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;;COLOR: #000000;FONT-SIZE: small;FONT-WEIG=\r\nHT: normal;TEXT-DECORATION: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f5f5f5=\r\n;&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f5f5=\r\nf5;&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;!-- |**|end egp html banner=\r\n|**| --&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Nightshift turns his head to Nightlight and reaches out to pu=\r\nt a friendly \nhand on hers, to show his support.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&quot; It&#39;s okay, Bump knows what he&#39;s do&#39;n.&nbsp; In no time you&#39;ll be back =\r\non \nyour feet bust&#39;n Predacon and Decepticon aft from here back ta Cybertro=\r\nn.&nbsp; \nAnd none of those jokers are gonna think twice about mess&#39;n with =\r\nyou again.

It&#39;s real nice ta=\r\n have &lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; \n  ya&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; back. I just wish we knew what Hydras =\r\nweakness is.

Wait Thats &lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; it,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; why didn&#39;t I think of this \n  before? Nightlight, I get it now. I bet th=\r\nat &lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; if&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; he \n  lost all visual capabilities, Hydras w=\r\nould be severely compromised. \n  &lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; On&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; the other hand=\r\n, Tucson lost the last fight because \n  Hydras had &#39;em at a&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; dis=\r\nadvantage. But if Tucson took out all his \n  visual circuitry, then he&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; would have the upper hand.
