By\nthe way can we call it anything ACCEPT the Matrix,\nbecause after seeing the movie I don&#39;t believe that\nwas the actual Matrix,  I go along with the Matrix\nbeing the all spark, and that device simply being a\nlink to the part of the that held the Autobot&#39;s\nleaders&#39; energy rather than the actual Matrix itself\n(it helps link G1 and BM together and I love BM, also\nmost people say that that being the Matrix creates no\nproblems with BW, but from my vague understanding of\nG1 that was only suppose to be the leaders in the\nMatrix, and Dinobot wasn&#39;t a leader, but Optimus\nPrimal said &quot;May his spark join the Matrix....the\ngreatest of Cybertron).\n\n--- x_rauq_x &lt;x_rauq_x@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ooC: \n&gt; \n&gt; Are there any Maximals present at the this battle?\n&gt; \n&gt; May I suggest that Switchblade brings it outside,\n&gt; and accidentally \n&gt; triggers an effect which creats a laser beam which\n&gt; targets Tyrael, \n&gt; but hits Megatron as well since he and Tyrael are\n&gt; fighting. After \n&gt; that, one of the still functioning\n&gt; Maximals/Tripreds, breaks the \n&gt; matrix like setup of the cube, thus breaking it into\n&gt; its pieces. \n&gt; From there, the pieces could get scattered around\n&gt; the world, or they \n&gt; could get divided up between the factions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since this affects everyone, ooC replies to it over\n&gt; the messageboard \n&gt; are quite acceptable, and are encouraged.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
