Perhaps she would see that kindness was welcomed, in yet, was out of place among transformers who would rather leave her to die then waste the time to rescue her. However, perhaps he was mixing up Predacons with the Alliance.  Shesta barked behind her master in a friendly way, tongue lulling out as she panted.        Vlad then reached and shook Antagony&#39;s hand, however, briefly. Indeed she was of the female sort but whether she attracted his interest would yet to be seen. However, her age as well. After all, Vlad was only 19 and he hadn&#39;t a single clue as to the age of this woman. He wasn&#39;t for the older type. But to remain as blunt as he was was asking to be considered a snob.** &quot; Antagony? A name I could never know a fembot could poses, though I believe it suits you perfectly.&quot; \n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
