He fires off a \n&gt; quick burst from his wrist launchers the blow it away. \n\nThe spider Spy obviously is not designed for combat, and instead of attempting to fight it elects to run. The blasts from Dark Rodimus miss as the creature is small and nimble, and it used the bulkheads to dodge behind. Quickly it fled into a venting duct and into the walls. \n\n(OOC: Yep, think roaches when you turn the lights on.)\n\nPreston\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
