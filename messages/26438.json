Everyone heard it, so...\n\nPlintissa knew that Optimus Prime was supposed to be good, but chances are\nhe&#39;ll find some excuse to ridicule and torment her anyway, because she was\nherself, someone that nobody seemed to like.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiskus heard the line, and thought: Floppy disk, indeed to it, Op Op Opo\nIppo Primin! Mr. Buzz, Diskus know because of smartness! Heehee!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBurning Hammer heard and knew that his time for glory was near. If he could\nfind Optimus Prime, he would kill him, and then all would be forced to bow\nbefore him! He would be the savior of the Alliance! Maybe Zardus would place\nhim in an exalted position, give him command over all of the troops,\nanything could happen! He daydreamed about it and accidentally broke off one\nof his fingers.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGotron hears the line. He thinks about Optimus Prime and the danger the\nAlliance might be in, but dispells any thoughts that the Alliance would be\ndefeated very quickly.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeemos hears it. He thinks to himself: Optimus Prime. The Autobot leader.\nPerhaps...No! I musn&#39;t think about him, there are ALOT of more important\nthings to attend to right now, like my domination over all, screw Optimus\nPrime. Still, it is something indeed that he has returned...\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRizopas: Did you hear that?\n\nDoom Ice: Nope, let&#39;s keep going.\n\nRizopas: WHAT? You can&#39;t tell me you didn&#39;t hear that!\n\nDoom Ice: Haha, sorry.\n\nRizopas: Hmm...\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShokaract hears. The Mob hears too, but stays quiet.\n\nShokaract: No! Optimus Prime? Why is he here? Does he want to kill me? I&#39;ll\nhave to kill him first, keep a lookout, Mob.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAirbomber: Shut up Optimsu Prime! You not hearing me essa? Shut up! Geez!\nSome people are rude, man.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstrat: Fancy that, Optimus Prime.\n\nArrow: I would love to make him SQUEAL.\n\nTrain Wreck: Yeah, me too, but don&#39;t take him lightly, Arrow, we took\nStronghold and Blender lightly.\n\nArrow: SQUEEEEEAL! Haha!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPerplex heard the Optimus Prime thing. He understood what it meant, but\ndidn&#39;t care. He went straight to the injured bot, picked him up, and walked\noff back towards the base, kicking a piece of Serge out of his way.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, January 28, 2001 1:50 AM\nSubject: Drastic times (Rdahl is writing this)\n\n\n&gt; OOC: I (Robert Dahl) am posting from rAuq&#39;s place cause i&#39;m\n&gt; staying the night.\n&gt;\n&gt; Motormaster&#39;s jaw hung open at he new message of Prime&#39;s\n&gt; awakening. &quot;Doesn&#39;t that junk piece ever stay dead?&quot; Motormaster\n&gt; spat harshly.
