He knew that he could blow Megatron \nto scrap in several seconds, since Megatron was in such bad \ncondition. He laughs at the last part.\n\n&quot;You obviously don&#39;t know the life of a mercenary, Megatron. Leading \na faction is one thing, but the universe is quite another. A \nmercenary lives to be hired and to kill, steal, sabatauge, whatever \nthe mission. What would I do with the entire universe? Ruling a \nfaction would still have competition, battle, everything that has \nmade up my life to date, but ruling the universe would get extremely \nboring.&quot;\n\nHe aims at a stalagmite in the cave, blowing it apart with a round \nfrom his chain gun.\n\n&quot;You of all people should know that lives and aliegences can end in \nan instant. I worked for Autobots before I worked for Decepticons, \nand for Decepticons before that, and spent some time freelance as \nwell. Sitting in a throne room with no action might suit you, but it \ndoesn&#39;t appeal to me.&quot;\n\nHis chaingun moves back to aim at Megatron&#39;s chest. &quot;Now that we have \nthe background info down, what is your status on this planet?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Very well then, your entitled to that&quot; Megatron strained. &quot;As you \nprobably\n&gt; know, I was turned into Galvatron in the year 2005, and then spent \nmonths\n&gt; on a planet that used to exist called Thrull. I soaked in a plasma \nbath, or\n&gt; I should say Galvatron did, and it damaged his circuits, that&#39;s \nwhen all\n&gt; that was me died. I then was able to watch him destroy everything I\n&gt; created, the Decepticon empire, the vast territorial gains in the \ngalaxies,\n&gt; and my reputation, and I was powerless to stop him. But now, the \nidiot\n&gt; revived me, for who knows what reason&quot; Megatron stated, then closed \nhis\n&gt; eyes, expecting to die at the hands of another surge of pain from \nhis\n&gt; master. But it never came.\n&gt; \n&gt; He adressed Autofire again, &quot;I came here because I sensed a source \nof\n&gt; energon being burnt, I was hoping to find a generator, or \nsomething, but it\n&gt; was you, which could be much more profitable to both of us&quot;. He then\n&gt; checked his energon readings, &quot; I am weak now because I plotted \nagainst\n&gt; Galvatron, but little did I know he had control over me. He flooded \nmy\n&gt; circuits with raw energon to destroy me. But I survived, just like \nI will\n&gt; survive this encounter Autofire, it dosent matter what you do. I \nwas built\n&gt; to not only be the Decepticon leader, but a survivor as well. I was \nancient\n&gt; when your designs where first thought up. I have survived for over \n16\n&gt; million years, and will continue to. This time nothing shall stop \nme, and\n&gt; my dream of conquest. You Autofire, are a Mercencary, but little do \nyou\n&gt; know, you are born to rule this Universe, by birthright. All other\n&gt; creatures are inferior to you Autofire, and you could be a soldier \ntoday,\n&gt; to lead the Decepticon empire into the futur&quot; he finished.\n\n\n"}}
