Other way to defend themselves would be inserting a stealth program\n&gt; that will mask their signatures from every one, just like the device that I\n&gt; gave Nightlight to hide for Maximals... and unluky... for Hydras, it had the\n&gt; side effect to hide her for Predacons too. This one will work in that way\n&gt; but this one would be part of their bodies... not a device and could be used\n&gt; at will&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;it would be like we were playing hide and seek &quot;said Elita with a childish\n&gt; tone\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;a deadly serious one&quot;replied dryly Perceptor&quot;With those two options they\n&gt; would be more safer in my point of view&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus nodded thoughtfully as Perceptor sppoke, his face going from\nwhat was mild alarm slowly into a more relaxed posture.
