The day moved forward as the sun\nslid from its mid point position to a one significantly lower in the\nskies. Occasionally in the distance a large dinosaur could be seen,\nfrom a predator who glanced in the direction of Lord Elder and Tuscon,\nbut who realized quickly that this metal machine was definitely not\nprey; to a sauropod, who&#39;s small head on a long neck  turned to look\nat the vehicle passed by, and even the smaller variety of creatures,\nfrom scavengers to predator, ones who typically scattered as the\nvehicle that was Tuscon bounced and yet moved easily across the broken\nterrain.\n\nUp ahead the trees, which had been near constant companions during\nmost of their trip began to break away as they came into more open\ncountry. Up ahead the beginnings of a mountain range could be seen.\nAbove them a flock of what could almost look like birds flew, although\ninstead of possessing feathers, they had large leathery and larger\nbodies.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re almost back&quot; Lord Elder said. He had been silent through most\nof the trip, his face wearing a thoughtful look. &quot;There, that mountain\nover there, at the base of it.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll activate the door in the shield for us.&quot; Elder said as he was\nabout to open a communication signal to the Ark. However Elder paused\nand look around, as if looking for something. &quot;Something&#39;s wrong here\n. . . &quot; he said as he continued to look.\n\nAbove them the prehistoric avians turned almost as one, their calls\nalmost defiant as they moved swiftly in the direction that Tuscon and\nElder had come from. &quot;It&#39;s like we&#39;re being watched.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Lord Elder)\n\n"}}
