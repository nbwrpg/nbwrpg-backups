It steadied itself, getting it&#39;s self ready.\n\nIt looked and saw the grass moving and it pounced.  It&#39;s huge muscled \nbody pushing it upward and out towards Lunarpine.  It&#39;s pounce aim \nwas a little off and missed Lunarpine by a foot. Now it saw him.  \nIt&#39;s huge k-9 teeth protruding out. It&#39;s huge paws ready to tear into \nhis prey and soon, his next meal. \n\n\n"}}
