It wouldn&#39;t be easy attempting =\r\nto turn Rodimus around. He simply sighs, and does not give anyone the satis=\r\nfaction of losing his temper. The less he expressed his disdain, the more h=\r\ne hoped to cause a bit of frustration among his captives. He had an old say=\r\ning. &quot;Don&#39;t get mad, use your strongest of attributes and talents to passiv=\r\nely retaliate against your enemies.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ohh well, I may be in trouble for =\r\na while, and it wouldn&#39;t be the first time.&quot;\n\nRodimus stepped into the cont=\r\nrol room as Tuscon was making his\ncomment. While the others in the cells co=\r\nuld not hear each other,\nRodimus could each one of them if he chose to.\n\nHe=\r\n glanced at the security screen to watch Tuscon, laying there\npractically i=\r\nmmobile by the restraints, and yet he was still trying to\nspeak. Part of Ro=\r\ndimus was disdainful of the Autobot, but then again\nthere was something abo=\r\nut his courage and conviction that touched him\nstrangely.\n\nFighting that em=\r\notion Rodimus jabbed on the control stud that would\nsend his voice down to =\r\nTuscon, into the speaker by his ear. &quot;What have\nyou to say for yourself now=\r\n Autobot?&quot; Rodimus said as he watched him.\n&quot;You have lost, why don&#39;t you ju=\r\nst give up?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
