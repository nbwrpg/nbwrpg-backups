After saying they should go home, Teltoli let a \n&gt; sincere smile break loose, and she watched Carnage walk a few steps. \n&gt; The Fuzor turned back to Instrat.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I realize that last attack was for my sake, but you needn&#39;t think I \n&gt; need protection from Carnage. We just had a few misunderstandings, \n&gt; but we both sorted it out. Although I&#39;m.. thankful for your help \n&gt; towards me, just.. you don&#39;t need to go around killing everything \n&gt; that you think you should&quot; She softly, trying to be friendly. \n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe fighting wasn&#39;t the best tactic after all. Even though she did \n&gt; so hate the sounds of battle. &quot;I&#39;m sure you could make friends, in \n&gt; whatever faction you are, if you decided to not be so.. savage&quot; She \n&gt; smiled, hoping to be reassuring. \n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Oh God, what am I doing? I&#39;m trying to be friendly with someone that \n&gt; tried to kill us not an hour ago?&#39; Teltoli thought. She took a few \n&gt; steps back, waved goodbye to Instrat and hoped she heeded her words.\n&gt; \n&gt; When she reached Carnage, she stayed in her bot mode. Sometimes some \n&gt; height was nice. She had a look of shock on her face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Did I really do that?&quot; She grimaced, and thought that maybe her \n&gt; mother&#39;s traits were coming through in her more strongly than ever \n&gt; now.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
