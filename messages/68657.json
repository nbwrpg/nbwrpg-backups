We&#39;re under missile lock!\n\nDespite her damage Phobia is able to stay in the air holding aloft the\ndangling form of Deepstryke. Now more wary from shot from behind she is\nable to take more evasive action as the rapid fire shots come from the\nMaximal shuttle (Elder). She swung to one side and then the other as\nthe cord from her swung at crazy angles almost jerking her through the\nair. As the last of the shots flies wide she streaks high into the air\nher boosters pushing at thier limits! Like some meteor or perhaps a\ncomet she pushed through the skies her form seeming to almost light up\nas the air from the resisting atmophere heats up her armor turning it\nbright oranges, but she continues flying!\n\nDecibel fires another volley of missiles at the Maximal shuttle before\nshe too fires her engines and streaked into the upper atmosphere. it\nwas time to leave, even though she wanted so much to stay and pummel\nthe Maximal ship with missiles! \n\nTummult fired a round and grazing at the ground trying to cover\nNightstrike and Darkfate, but so far he couldn&#39;t tell if they were\nstaying to fight on, or preparing to leave. He shrugged internally,\nthey had heard the order to retreat, if they wanted to stay and fight .\n. . he sighed, &quot;Nightstrike, Darkfate, get your rusted aftplates in the\nskies NOW! We are LEAVING!&quot;\n\nTummult&#39;s boosters fired as he also pushed higher into the skies, not\none to hang out when there was nothing to win.\n\nBelow them on the ground the hover tank continued to fire on the\nminions, his powerful cannon sending punishing blasts of plasma into\nthe air. However as only Nightstrike and Darkfate are still in the\nvicinity they recieve his full attention!\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion & Legacy)\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
