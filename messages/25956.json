It was strange sometimes how people asked for orders or \ncommands, \n&gt; like they want to be sent out to go and do something. Must be bord \nthen.\n&gt; She shook her head.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; There are none to give out other then maintaining the cease fire \nand \n&gt; watching the Alliance.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * There was no telling just what the Alliance could do now and if \nthey would \n&gt; leave once the captives had been released. But she hoped that they \nwere just \n&gt; as tired of this battle as she was and ready to go back to their \nown base \n&gt; that needed it&#39;s own protecting.\n&gt; But then Iron Raptor suddenly remembered something, feeling rather \nguilty \n&gt; for forgetting.\n&gt; There was still the small kitten in her back compartment!\n&gt; She reached back to get hold of him, trying to get a punch of neck \nfur \n&gt; between her fingers to pull him out. But it wasn&#39;t long before \nthere was \n&gt; some other sound which attracted her attention while she was trying \nto get \n&gt; the cat. It was a musical voice, and it was greeted by her with a \nslightly \n&gt; annoyed sigh.\n&gt; It was one thing after another.\n&gt; &lt; Could you reply to that, Prowl?&gt;*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
