Damn AOL making a send button over a reply button making me \nsend a blank email. Now then Dewboy to answer your question. No, I would not. \nAs by becoming a council member I would essence be becoming a GM. Everyone \nwould get a fair chance whether or not I liked them or didnt like them. \nAlthough if someone decides to needlessly piss me off about some matter \nwithin the RPG, such as how when me and you were making all those useless \nOOCs I would give them 3 chances, one warning, a second warning, and then a \nmodration, and if they continue to do the same thing again I would set a \nmotion to have them booted from the RPG. \n\n         Also I would also like to let people no my motives for joining the \ncouncil. Although I have been in this RPG a short duration compared to some I \ncan see now that the people who participate are really treated like children \nrather than adults. Seriously, no interception of weapons fire? Sure it got \nbad a while back, but you know what people who are on the council should suck \nit up and deal with the problem instead of just making a rule that cuts down \non gameplay. How could someone do that? Well one could give them a warning if \nthey were abusing the weapons fire interception, then if they persisted in \nabusing the thing they could get moderated, and then if they continued, just \nremove them from the RPG as apparently they don&#39;t wish to be fair. \n\n         What would happen to the charachters of the abusive person removed? \nEither A, give them someone, B recruit someone to take them, or C Take \nresponsibility for them. Seriously it isnt that hard to control fifty \ncharachters I have about three times that in an EZBoard Beast Wars RPG. That \nis because I control all the predacons as noone not even the other GM would \ntake any of them and the only other person who did have some has mysteriously \ndissapeared, I control around 3/4ths of the maximals again because the otehr \nGM is lazy, and I also control a whole slew of custom charachters either I \ndesigned and made or someone else did and are no longer in the RPG.\n\n         Also, I would like to help the RPG finally get off the god damn \nplanet Earth and back to Cybertron but not following the Beast Machines story \nline. To me the thing was just too freakishly annoying and I believe only \nsome of the later first season was actually good. Earth has been overdone, \nand the storyline this RPG was supposed to follow has been butchered and \ndestroyed and looks nothing like the story I saw. And as for more charachters \npopping up from ships? Seriously do you know how unlikely it is that all \nthese ships would be hitting the same god damn planet? Who here thinks we \nshould move on to something other than past Earth or Earth in Particular?\n\n         Also I find the whole no hostile drone rule ridiculous to even have \nup there. Its BW people undestand there should be no drones at all really. \nAnd as for offensive ones? Well, They should ask the council first as that \nwould be a logical idea. To make things short if im elected for council I am \ngoing to try to change things Ill try to get RPers treated more as adults \nrather then the imature kids that I feel they are being treated like now.
