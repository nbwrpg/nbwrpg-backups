They&#39;d also have to\nsetup energon collectors, the mess hall supplies while in no real danger yet\nwould need restocking.\n\nGoing through the list he moved scouting and patrols towards the top, most\nlikely jobs for the two fliers that have proven their value so well the\nfirst day, probably send Grimlock out with them, the dinobot could benefit\nfrom a bit of Sunhawks military training...he doubted the two would mix any\nbetter than paint and oil but it would be worth a gamble.\n\nLooking through the list of available maximals and autobots he sat back\nplanning the duty roster for tomorrow...\n\n\n"}}
