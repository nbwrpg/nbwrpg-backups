As it ends she smirks and turns to her \n&gt; own gestalt team.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frostbite: &quot;You two, prepare we are going to show these \nCybertronians \n&gt; how to do things. Hellpeon shall enter the individual tournament \nand \n&gt; eliminate all competition.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; THe two archon beings nod and look up as a hologrphic image appears \n&gt; above them. Frostbite then taps a button causing an extremely \nstrong \n&gt; transmission to be sent to the IGL tournament area or whatever.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frostbite: &quot;This is commander Frostbite of the Infecticon team \n&gt; currently on this planet. We would like to participate in this \nevent. \n&gt; We shall send our strongest warrior and our gestalt team to the \n&gt; location of your message to prepare, if this is ok with you. \nAnyways.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elsewhere at the Trainer base that should be exploding and taking \nout \n&gt; everthing within 50 miles by now from what Cyber said... The Energy \n&gt; column dissapates and Hellpeon hovers out of its epicenter and \nabove \n&gt; the base. Soon afterward he recieves a Telepathic message from \n&gt; Frostbite and Nods. He then speeds off towards the IGL ship. \nHellpeon \n&gt; was lucky this time seeing as how he would need alot of time to \n&gt; recooperate from releasing that amount of energy. However before he \n&gt; dissapears into the distance, he sends a telepathic message to \n&gt; Darkfate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hellpeon: &quot;Go to sector 44-26-C... Now. You will speak with my \nleader \n&gt; there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; President Kaiser:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From atop the exact center of the mighty IGL craft, several \n&gt; antennaes \n&gt; &gt; extending, three orbs blasting off from what looked like three \n&gt; cannons on \n&gt; &gt; other sides, quickly ascending until they were in Earth&#39;s orbit, \n&gt; the orbs \n&gt; &gt; transforming into satellites.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With the powerful antennaes and positioning of the satellites the \n&gt; IGL would \n&gt; &gt; be able to communicate with all the major bases rather well and \n&gt; they would \n&gt; &gt; even be able to get their transmission through jamming systems.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Depending on the type of base and its equipment, either an audio \nor \n&gt; audio and \n&gt; &gt; picture message would appear.  Most likely the audio and view of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; President speaking.  The message consisted of:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A slightly menacing robot who was thirteen feet tall, though it \nwas \n&gt; hard to \n&gt; &gt; tell with him sitting in a large black luxurious chair.  His body \n&gt; was a \n&gt; &gt; comfortable mix of red and gold.  On primarily red colored chest \n&gt; there was a \n&gt; &gt; golden symbol of the IGL, a sword with a shield behind it.  His \n&gt; blue optic \n&gt; &gt; sensors brightened as he first spoke.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Congratulations, Cybertronians and any other beings,&quot; Kaiser \n&gt; began, his \n&gt; &gt; voice very deep, &quot;I am President Kaiser of the IGL, the \n&gt; Intergalactic \n&gt; &gt; Gladiatorial League.  Now I know you are all busy plotting and \n&gt; scheming \n&gt; &gt; futily to defeat your opponents but believe me, this is a very \n&gt; important \n&gt; &gt; message that could thrust the balance of power into your favor.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;The IGL holds matches year long, but only once every year do \nthey \n&gt; hold the \n&gt; &gt; Intergalactic Gladiatorial League Combat Championships.  We were \n&gt; hoping that \n&gt; &gt; some if not almost all of you Cybertronians would participate in \n&gt; this.  There \n&gt; &gt; will be two divisions.  The Regular, and the Gestalt.  The \nregular \n&gt; will \n&gt; &gt; consist of normal combatants with numerous one on one battles \nuntil \n&gt; there is \n&gt; &gt; a final one on one battle to determine the IGL Champion of the \n&gt; Regular \n&gt; &gt; League.  The victor will receive five protoforms and equipment to \n&gt; make mold \n&gt; &gt; them into anything they desire, including a gestalt team.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;No doubt that would help any faction begin rising to power.  And \n&gt; for the \n&gt; &gt; Gestalt League, all gestalt teams may fight one one, as in one \n&gt; gestalt team \n&gt; &gt; against the other.  These &#39;one&#39; on &#39;one&#39; matches will continue \n&gt; until there \n&gt; &gt; are only two teams left and the victor of that final bout will be \n&gt; IGL \n&gt; &gt; Champions of the Gestalt League.  They will receive armor \n&gt; modifications, 200 \n&gt; &gt; kilos of liquid energon, and if they fight well enough a \nprotoform \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; equipment for them to do with as they wish.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Normally the bouts are not fights to the deaths, but upon \nrequest \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; agreement from the combatants this kind of match can occur (if \nyou \n&gt; have any \n&gt; &gt; spare chars. you need to kill off, hint, hint).  A faction may \n&gt; enter as many \n&gt; &gt; warriors into each league as wanted.  In example, one faction \ncould \n&gt; enter \n&gt; &gt; twenty-five robots into a league.  Or if they had four gestalt \n&gt; teams, they \n&gt; &gt; could enter them into the league.  Although, they would have to \n&gt; fight each \n&gt; &gt; other as if they were enemies.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Our craft, the Otyebis, is a mighty ship and assassination is \nnot \n&gt; something \n&gt; &gt; to worry about.  If we wanted you dead, it would&#39;ve been much \n&gt; easier to \n&gt; &gt; simply bombard you from orbit with our grealty superior weapons, \nor \n&gt; overrun \n&gt; &gt; you with our many garrisons of assorted beings.  But that&#39;s not \nwe \n&gt; will do.  \n&gt; &gt; There is a zero tolerance for fighting outside of the arenas.  We \n&gt; will not \n&gt; &gt; allow your petty differences to interfere with our show.  Anyone \n&gt; who attacks \n&gt; &gt; our craft will be obliterated.  If a target of an enemy faction \nis \n&gt; in a \n&gt; &gt; middle of a match and his enemies attempt to interfere, we will \n&gt; crush them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A smile crept up on the lips of the non-Cybertronian robot.  &quot;You \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; register into the IGL by simply sending transmissions to our \nship, \n&gt; we have \n&gt; &gt; the resouces to deal with constant messages.  You have (two IRL \n&gt; weeks) to \n&gt; &gt; register.  Feel free to ask any questions (send &#39;em to \n&gt; KSLawDogg@c...) when \n&gt; &gt; you send your transmissions.  This message will replay for 48 \nhours \n&gt; in case \n&gt; &gt; anyone misses this message.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The IGL President was replaced by the golden IGL symbol with a \n&gt; background of \n&gt; &gt; red.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (If you have any questions, e-mail me.  This isn&#39;t a trick to \ncrush \n&gt; people, \n&gt; &gt; Yan won&#39;t allow it.  Just something I thought of to add a little \n&gt; spice to the \n&gt; &gt; attack, retreat, attack theme that seems to be going on in the \n&gt; RPG.  Since \n&gt; &gt; Yanshosh and I have characters in the IGL command, we are not \n&gt; allowed to win \n&gt; &gt; because it would seem unfair.  The way the winner will be decided \n&gt; is as if it \n&gt; &gt; were a real battle.  Whoever&#39;s character(s) give first lose.  \nThere \n&gt; will be \n&gt; &gt; no complete retreats, though in some matches there will be \n&gt; different \n&gt; &gt; terrians, such as forest, etc, for people to run and try and hide \n&gt; in if \n&gt; &gt; things get dicy)\n\n\n"}}
