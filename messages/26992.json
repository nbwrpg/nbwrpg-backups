Suddenly, \nSlayer angles upward, deciding not to go the Alliance base.

He \n&gt; used his comm link and comunicates with Perndabot (OOc: sorry for \nthe \n&gt; spelling). &quot;Darkfate to Perndabot&quot; said the male &quot;Two of my troops \n&gt; are following a bot who attack our base, they&#39;re close of \nAlliance&#39;s \n&gt; base, I&#39;ll send the signature of my troops in order to you don&#39;t \n&gt; shoot them&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; he send the signatures of Shivah and Attilla, while he send a \nsecret \n&gt; menssage to them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Attilla and Shivah guessed Slayer&#39;s play and they (with the probes)\n&gt; spread in several direcctions while them increased the speed. They \n&gt; started to shot against Slayer again\n\n\n"}}
