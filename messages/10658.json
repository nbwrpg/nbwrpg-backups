Damaging the main programming of the protoform itself, wiping its identity systems clean.\n\tIt wasn�t long before the fireball disappeared and the stasis pod dropped quietly to earth, coming to rest at the base of a rotting oak at the heart of a swampland only a few clicks from the Alliance base.\nAs primary protocol the DNA replicators activated and erected itself from the smooth and melted surface of the pod, 4 walls of scanning beams sweeping over the surroundings.\n With all manners of creatures that belonged to the night, going about their business, these 4 scanners managed to scan 2 at once. The perfect chemical merge to create what modern transformers refereed to�a fuzor.\nFrom within the pod came the high pitched scream/hiss of a nightmare, one leathery wing extending from the pods dark depths. However, as the wing extended further, a writhing mass of coils slithered from the pod and to the ground.\nThe full extent of the new life form emerging into the night, rising up from it�s coils and extending it�s wings to catch the rays of the moon, a piercing scream/hiss exiting it�s throat before sinking back to the ground and folding it�s wings at its side.\n A fuzor, combined DNA sequences of both cobra and vampire bat. Both creatures of the night.\nThis new being looked around it�s surroundings with the paralyzing eyes of death, watching the night and detecting every warm mass within miles.\n With a second shriek it transformed to become the being it truly was, bot.\nIn this form it was slim, clearly showing every supple curves that marked it as female.\n Taking a few small but graceful steps forward it soon fell to it�s knees, slowly sinking to it�s hands as well as the leathery wings gathered about it as a cloak.\n She was new to this world, but weak as well. Damaged from it�s decent onto this world had made her this way, rest and repair would see her back to her strength and feet.\n Light green armor covered her body, all except for her chest and pelvic reigns, which shaded into deeper qualities of the color.  \nWith a soft hiss this new bot sank to the ground, slowly going into stasis lock due to her obtained damage.\nHer wings draping over her lush feminine body as her amber eyes closed, shielding her from the cold as well as sculpting themselves against her female curves.\nThis bot was as true a female as true it was in stasis lock.\nThe night wore on slowly, a damaged fembot helpless to realize such. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
