Dakness, pain and even a\nstrange sense of loneliness as if he has lost someone or something,\nbut he is not sure what.\n\nFor HYDRAS there was only the sensation of floating in water, his body\nmoving and swaying. A curious situation since as far as his internal\ndiagnotics were telling him he had no body, no frame. It was like he\nwere caught in some sort of dream state.\n\nFor a moment he could see the world of EARTH, the entirety of it, the\nlength and breadth of it. it seemed far older than he remembered it\nand yet strangely younger. He could see the energy it held, the\nkingdoms that would one day rise and fall all over the course of\nthousands and millions of years.\n\nThen he could see that the legions on the world were not humans but\nCYBERTRONIANS all of them with the PREDACON and even DECEPTICON logos\non their chestplates.\n\nBut there was somehting different about it, and then it hit, the\nCYBERTRONIANS, the PREDACONS and the MAXIMALS were all large sized 30,\n40 some even 50 feet tall.\n\n&quot;All of this could be yours.&quot; Said a dark and unknown voice to HYDRAS\nfrom somewhere that he could not see. &quot;All you must do is be my\nfollower.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you say Hydras?&quot; The voice had an arrogant curiousity to it.\n&quot;think upon it. Hydras. Until then I have given you a gift.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hydras . . . &quot;\n\n                          &quot; . . . Hydras? . . . &quot;\n\nLIGHT!!\n\nA sudden radiance seemed to peer into HYDRAS&#39; world.\n\n                                                               &quot; . . .\nHydras . . &quot;\n\n&quot;Hydras!&quot; There was another voice now, this one more familiar, it was\nJHIAXUS! &quot;Wake up!&quot;\n\n\nHYDRAS&#39; internals were now registering a body and a form different\nfrom his original but one definitly powerful! His systems were slowly\nrebooting themselves and powering up and his sensors were only telling\nhim that he was in a room of some sort with two individuals. JHIAXUS\nand SCORPONOK.\n\nThese two had disappeared a long while back. Where had they been all\nthis time, and what and why were they here now?\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
