Lord Elder, =\r\nI wish to thank you for your support in getting me this far. If it had not =\r\nbeen for you, I would not have made it back to the Ark to fullfill this que=\r\nst. And of course Rat Trap, he rescued me and if he had not, it wouldn&#39;t ha=\r\nve been possible. I promise you your debts will be receprocated tenfold.&quot;\n\n=\r\nHe looks to Kup, and Elita seeing their faces for the first time in years. =\r\nHe was most joyed to see them again, more than anything else. His vision cl=\r\nears more and more and soon the images of his comrades becomes clear. He sa=\r\nlutes them both.\n\n&quot;Kup, Elita, as Autobots I honor you for the courage you&#39;=\r\nve shown me this day. I will need your courage now my friends. As we all kn=\r\now, Hydras, Cyclonus and Scourge are on a power trip bent on Greed and tyra=\r\nnical dictatorship. They wish to gorge themselves on power, rather than res=\r\nolve the matter of Unicron. They wish to also over power him, and gain the =\r\npower for themselves. If they do that, we have more than just a simple disa=\r\nster on our hands. That has to be stopped. Also, we need to get back Rodimu=\r\ns, Nightlight and Windlord as soon as possible. Their sparks are being used=\r\n injustly and I will not tolerate it any further. Also, when we do manage t=\r\no rescue Rodimus and the others, I had once thought I&#39;d be resentful toward=\r\n him for allowing himself to fall to such means.. I was wrong to be as such=\r\n. And I&#39;d rather not see any of us make the same mistake. Please, we must b=\r\ne understanding to Rodimus, for none of this was his fault.&quot;\n\nHe looks to t=\r\nhe computer for any signs from Night Shift. Then he looks back to the room =\r\nfilled with disabled Autobots and Decepticons. \n\n&quot; Optimus Prime gave me hi=\r\ns power for a reason, not only to defeat the evil that infects this land, b=\r\nut to also show compassion to those who were cast asside. These Decepticons=\r\n who lie dorment with the Autobots, I know we&#39;re enemies, but their leader =\r\ndid not lead them with encouragement, he lead them with corruption. And if =\r\nthey failed, he&#39;d treat them like junk. They did what they had to do becaus=\r\ne they were forced, not because they wanted to. We also fight for their fre=\r\nedom as well as our own. If only they could awaken, and if only I could tel=\r\nl them that they have the choice to freely chose which faction they wish to=\r\n return to.&quot;\n\nHe turns back to his comrades.\n\n&quot;Night Shift should be almost=\r\n at the Dark Fortress, hopefully he will send us the information we need to=\r\n reverse the shell program which infects Rodimus and possibly Nightlight an=\r\nd Windlord. It may take him some time to get it to us, but be prepared, it =\r\ncould happen sooner than later.&quot;\n\nHe then transmits to Legacy.\n\n&quot; Legacy, i=\r\nf you get this transmission, this is Tucson Prime, transmitting to you from=\r\n the Ark.
