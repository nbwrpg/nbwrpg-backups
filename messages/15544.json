Hmmm..Foxfingers could wait, he served no use.  Hot Rod\n&gt; &gt; was down.  Yessss.  Excellent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      &quot;Feline, I think this is our chance to cause some real\n&gt; &gt; chaos!!!  The Maximal named Hot Rod is down.  We can reprogram \nhim,\n&gt; &gt; and tell him that his main goal is to exterminate the one named K-\n9\n&gt; &gt; and friends.  We might even be able to spread gossip that K-9 \nkilled\n&gt; &gt; Hot Rod intentionally!!  Then we&#39;ll cause chaos!!!!  So, what do \nyou\n&gt; &gt; think, beautiful?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
