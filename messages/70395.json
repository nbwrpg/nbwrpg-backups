After all, I am a scientist, not\n&gt; a warrior.&quot; Fractyl sounded hopeful at possibly staying behind,\n&gt; although he knew how often the Megatron of old had tried to push him\n&gt; to be a warrior.\n&gt;\n&gt; Iguanus just smiled, &quot;Of course sir.&quot; he said gruffly as he fell in\n&gt; behind Hydras, his single optic glowing malevolently. His other optic\n&gt; covered by some sort of patch, mute testimony that unlike Fractyl,\n&gt; Iguanus was the veteran of a great many battles.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the door another figure appeared, it was transmetal 2 INFERNO, who\n&gt; it appears had been guarding the door to Hydras throne room. As Hydras\n&gt; approached he stepped up, &quot;Sire!&quot; he began as the door slid open, &quot;I\n&gt; will accompany you as well!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It would seem that Inferno had gotten over some of his delusion that\n&gt; Megatron, or in this case Hydras, was his queen, but his devotion to\n&gt; Hydras was still unswerving and zealous!\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
