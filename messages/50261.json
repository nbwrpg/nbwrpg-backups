Owlhawk brought the\n&gt; newcomers back to Maximal City. They met Rodimus and\n&gt; both sides have decided to work together. However\n&gt; Katya challanged Owlhawl to an honorable tradition\n&gt; to see the warrior nature of the Maximals. Now\n&gt; Owlhawk and Katya are fighting each other in a shoot\n&gt; fight. I&#39;ll let you take back Owlhawk now.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Rodimus Prime::\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to Ragnar.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah he is strong and very military like. As long\n&gt; as he is under control he is a great asset to the\n&gt; Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
