An arrogance to be \ndirected,\n&gt; pushed, and manipulated..\n&gt; \n&gt; Phobia landed his ship outside the Predacon cave, scanning for the \nMaximals\n&gt; responsible for the attack, he exited his ship and looked toward \nthe crashed\n&gt; ship. &quot;Another wonderful anomaly&quot;he thought to himself, glareing at \nthe\n&gt; damage. He entered the cave and began to take a head count.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 30, 2000 7:48 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: The Pain Of KitKat\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She hugged him managed to smile at Drillbit.  &quot;Yeah, let&#39;s.&quot;  She\n&gt; &gt; took his arm and went with him to the pod.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, lets check that out.&quot; he said, walking outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;And, you DID do the right thing.
