He&#39;s not exactly the most sociable\n&gt; part, and nothing agains=\r\nt him but, he is treading on thin ice with Tucson\n&gt; sir, and I really think=\r\n someone should talk to Tucson before he blows his\n&gt; own stack. I can see i=\r\nt in my brother&#39;s face, there&#39;s an air about him that\n&gt; seems troubling. On=\r\ne of these days a real fight between them will break out\n&gt; and there may be=\r\n no way ta stop it. I tried talking to Tucson but he&#39;s as\n&gt; stubborn as Rat=\r\nchet in that respect.
