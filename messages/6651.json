I&#39;m gethering vitle data about the new ship for\nmy\n&gt; Lord Hell Beast. Infultrating the base and figuring out their weapons, how\n&gt; they work, weaknesses in the shields, security systems and all.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * After answering Perndabot&#39;s question she then began to continue in the\n&gt; direction the the new Maximal base, taking the lead but taking care to let\n&gt; her hips swing a bit. Wondering that with all her comments towards him, if\n&gt; Perndabot was going to say anything towards her.\n&gt; It had been so long since she had last heard a comment on her looks,\nGangon\n&gt; being the first and last bot that had ever said anything.\n&gt; But with him gone she felt a bit...unappresiated.\n&gt; With all her loyalty towards Hell Beast he didn&#39;t once reward her for it,\n&gt; just simply wanting a pat on the back or an encuraging word. But nothing.\n&gt; Nobot ever even noticing her, except in battle when they were trying to\nkill\n&gt; her!\n&gt; But now she found someone who she actually liked, fairly much. But he was\non\n&gt; the wrong side, if he were a Predacon then things would be much better.\n&gt; But without any words towards her from him then she just didn&#39;t know if he\n&gt; liked her...besides his wondering optics.\n&gt; BrightBlade sighed but then nearly gasped when she suddenly saw a flash of\n&gt; light.\n&gt; Blinking a few times she stopped in her tracks and squinted, finally\n&gt; noticing that it was a spark!\n&gt; She quickly scanned it, turning out to be Gangon&#39;s spark she smiled at it.\n&gt; Though to make sure she then spoke.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Gangon? &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; To email plain text is conventional, to add graphics is divine.\n&gt; We&#39;ll show you how at www.supersig.com.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6808/13/_/_/_/963579979/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
