She landed on \nher side.  She got up but limping.  The crash with the wall injured \nher right shoulder.\nDespite the pain, she walked over to Quickstrike and Stringtra.\n&quot;Let&#39;s get out of here!&quot; She couldn&#39;t transform with her broken \nshoulder. &quot;Come on! Stringtra, can you carry Quickstrike?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Rowdy Wolf/Terrorsaur:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The Metal Beast showed no pain as KitKat latched her teeth onto its \nleg. It \n&gt; reared up, swung its leg that KitKat was on, and launched her \nacross the \n&gt; section.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf fired his rifle at the wolf-bot. He heard the shot \nricochet \n&gt; inside of its shoulder. It turned its head to Rowdy Wolf, with two \nbeady red \n&gt; eyes glaring at him. He froze for a second, then came to \nagain. &quot;Get out of \n&gt; here! Go!&quot; He waved his arm in the air. &quot;Slag it, run!&quot; he shouted \na the \n&gt; others. He fired again, onto the Metal Beast&#39;s leg as he stomped \ntowards \n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terrorsaur didn&#39;t seem like he was going to stay. He paced in mid-\nair, \n&gt; trying to study the Vok creation. He flew over top of Stingtra&#39;s \nhead. He \n&gt; flew down and slashed at the wires that connected to Quickstrike&#39;s \nhead.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Blow the cavern!&quot; he shouted. He flew to the side and turned his \nshoulder \n&gt; cannons at the wall of the cavern. He fired multile times.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
