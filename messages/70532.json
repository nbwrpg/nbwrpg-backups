This was that dire need.  He opens it, and holds it for Ves=\r\ntige to drink from it.\n\n&quot; I don&#39;t know where we can find a repair chamber, =\r\nbut this should help you find just a little bit more energy.  It&#39;s my last =\r\nreserve, but you need this more than I do.  Here, drink, it&#39;s energon, and =\r\nit will help you keep some energy in your body.&quot;  \n\nAt the same time, Tucso=\r\nn was keeping an ear out for the metallic spiders and insects.

IF\n&gt; &gt; YOUR EYES HAVE FAILED YOU, REMEMBER, YOU STILL H=\r\nAVE\n&gt; &gt; YOUR OTHER SENSES!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was no answer comming fro=\r\nm Rodimus save for the sound of buzzing\n&gt; insects, there were near and appr=\r\noaching as Tuscon moved as best he\n&gt; could along the corridores and tunnels=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; The area here was built like any transit system he was familiar with=\r\n,\n&gt; with long corridores, and signs clearly showing the directions to get\n&gt;=\r\n to one place or another. However it would seem that the lack of\n&gt; maintain=\r\nance was taking its toll as in some places the lights were dim\n&gt; or shut of=\r\nf completely due to lack of power or quite simply the bulbs\n&gt; had blown out=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; While in the darkness of the tunnels, Tucson coul=\r\nd hear a faint voice recalling Perceptor&#39;s words which were typed in on the=\r\n computer. He knew he had to send a message back to Perceptor to let him kn=\r\now that he was still all right, and well on his way to finding Rodimus. So =\r\nhe looks ahead, and wispers his reply which can also be heard in the lab.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I will find him and I will bring him to saftey. No Autobot abandon=\r\ns his comrades.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; In the tunnels ahead Tuscon is able to fin=\r\nd a communication link as\n&gt; they are seemingly spread out for convientient =\r\nuse of all who need it,\n&gt; or atleast it would be convienient if there was s=\r\nomeone around to\n&gt; actually use it.\n&gt; \n&gt; However as Tuscon closed the line =\r\nhe could hear the sound of matallic\n&gt; scraping sounding very much the same =\r\nas the sound the spider like\n&gt; insects made that he had met on the street. =\r\nThe sound was comming from\n&gt; further up the hall. The echo and reverb along=\r\n the corridores made it\n&gt; it difficult to locate true positioning, but one =\r\nthing was for certain\n&gt; it was getting louder, they were closing quickly on=\r\n his location.\n&gt; \n&gt; In his arms Vestige coughed, it would seem that he was =\r\ntaking a turn\n&gt; for the worst. he would need time in a repair chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
