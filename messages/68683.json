He had seen\nhow the soldier fought and then escaped. He being brought down by a\nsingle shot was surprising, and he did not trust it at all!\n\n&quot;Becareful of that one.&quot; He said in dark tones, indicating malice with\na keenly sharp taloned index finger &quot;He could be faking his injuries.&quot;\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
