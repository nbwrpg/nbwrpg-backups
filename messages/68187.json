One is near to the shuttle\nbay and the other near the area where Hydras and crew had been\nplanning. \n\nUnfortunately they have no cloaking technology, relying only on small\nsize and quick agility to keep them out of harms way. (they are\napproximatley 1/2 the size of a Cybertronian&#39;s hand, maybe a little\nsmaller) Thier programming is limited and for they moment they are\ncontent to monitor, hoping not to be found.\n\nOOC: Again anyone with the correct sensory equipment could find them. \n\nPreston\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
