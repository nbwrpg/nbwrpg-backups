He tries to activate his\n&gt; optics lasers but there no energy left and they fizzle out. He head\n&gt; slumps again. Rodimus Prime has indeed been beaten.\n\nCyclonus&#39; tilted his head slightly as he watched Rodimus, not quite\nsure if this was a ruse or not. It is as Rodimus&#39; head slumps, Cyclonus\nnods to himself, as he realized that the battle was over. A quick\nglance at Rodimus&#39; chest tells him that severe battle damage would not\nallow it to be opened giving him direct access to the matrix that was\nheld within, but Cyclonus knew that there was another way. \n\nCarefully Cyclonus approached Rodimus, hands held before him, fingers\nheld out. In his palms his hand cannons seemed to almost retract or\neven open revealing twin black holes, the same feature he displayed\nnear the end of his last battle when he absorbed the energy of the\nmissiles, but here his bleed back receptors were to put to a much\ndifferent use. Placing his palms on Rodimus&#39; chest Cyclonus prepared\nhimself, mentally shifting and recalibrating the receptors, and then\nwith a specific act of will he activated them!\n\nIn spectacular arcs of power, energy laced itself around Cyclonus and\nRodimus as power flowing from Rodimus into Cyclonus through Cyclonus\nhands on Rodimus&#39; chest. A grim look apeared on Cyclonus face as he\nstared into the optics of the defeated Rodimus, for the briefest moment\na strange look appeared on Cyclonus&#39; face, Triumph? Remorse? It was\ngone before it could be identified. What repalced it was a steel mask\nof victory as the powerful Unicron herald began to leech the power of\nthe matrix from Rodimus Prime&#39;s chest!\n\nOOC: Will Remus be interfearing??\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus)\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better sports nut!
