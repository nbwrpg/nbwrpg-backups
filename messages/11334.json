She looked and saw the lab.  But where \nthe lab was or who it belonged to she wasn&#39;t sure.  She still felt a \nlitle groggy.  She kept looking around the room, but with her eyes \nonly.  She couldn&#39;t really move her head yet.  Her body just shook \nand didn&#39;t want to respond to her thoughts.  She whispered \nagain,&quot;Where an I? I&quot;m cold&quot; she closed her eyes hoping the shivering \nand shaking would stop soon.\n\n\n"}}
