Due to all the complaints that we&#39;ve gotten from the \n&gt; members on this battle, the council has thus far come up with the\n&gt; following: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. No teleportation whatsoever. This includes all\n&gt; the beaming. &gt; &gt; 2. No deathglyders/tanks &gt; for the time being. This\n&gt; is still being discussed. &gt; 3. Absolutely no anti-shield weapons. No\n&gt; exuses. &gt; 4. All large ships must crash upon entering the atmosphere.\n&gt; Please get those two ships out of the air and into their permanent\n&gt; positions. &gt; &gt; We&#39;re still talking about it, so things might change.\n&gt; These rules take effect immediately. &gt; &gt;\n&gt; ::Slayer/Incarcinator/EndBringer/Demise:: &gt; &gt; Slayer dodges most of\n&gt; the beam, his arm being blown off. He curses, firing two blasts from\n&gt; his remaining shoulder cannon back at the ship that had shot him. &gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &gt; Incarcinator is hit by the two\n&gt; shots from the Trainer base, being blown backwards. The beam almost\n&gt; hits him, but he doesn&#39;t notice as he tries to regain balance. &gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &gt; Roaring, EndBringer fires two\n&gt; more missiles at the Trainer base. &gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &gt; Demise looks around, growling.\n&gt; He didn&#39;t have any good long-range weapons, so he couldn&#39;t really help\n&gt; much. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
