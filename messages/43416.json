I&#39;ve had &lt;BR&gt;enough of your stupid \n  sh*t!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Blizzard stood up.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Blizzard: Twister, your=\r\n not our leader! Sit down and shut up! I let &lt;BR&gt;you \n  push me around befo=\r\nre, but not anymore! You don&#39;t have the right! &lt;BR&gt;We can \n  do what we wan=\r\nt without your permission!...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fascino \n  slaps he=\r\nr forehead, thinking that Blizzard&#39;s actions were &lt;BR&gt;insane and \n  brainle=\r\nss.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The whole time Venomous was shaking his \n  he=\r\nad and waving his arms, &lt;BR&gt;trying to get Blizzard to stop. Wrath lights up=\r\n \n  a cigarette and &lt;BR&gt;Fascino slaps it away from him. He smiles for a min=\r\nute but \n  quickly &lt;BR&gt;covers it up with a stale frown. Twister looks at \n =\r\n Blizzard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Twister: What the hell is this!? Daddy=\r\n&#39;s \n  little precious baby girl, &lt;BR&gt;finally stands up for herself! Is that=\r\n it? \n  Well, you know what? It&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;up to you if you want to stand up for=\r\n yourself! \n  Cause you know what? &lt;BR&gt;You don&#39;t count! You never did! Sit =\r\n\n  down!!!...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Blizzard sits down on the ground.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Twister: That&#39;s what I thought...All talk...Tha=\r\nt&#39;s \n  all...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Blizzard put a hand behind her back=\r\n and \n  looked at Venomous. He &lt;BR&gt;looked at her and shook his head. Blizza=\r\nrd looks \n  away and sighs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fascino stands up, wa=\r\nlking away from \n  the others. Wrath follows her.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Wrath: Kamodia, how \n  about we fight, like in the old days? I&#39;ll beat &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;you again.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fascino: Up yours! I won back then=\r\n, and I will now. And \n  that&#39;s not &lt;BR&gt;my name asshole! Battle with knives=\r\n...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fascino pulls out a knife. Wrath pulls out=\r\n a knife. The others \n  &lt;BR&gt;watch from a distance. Wrath runs at Fascino. F=\r\nascino drops her knife \n  &lt;BR&gt;and pulls out a rifle and shoots Wrath in the=\r\n head 5 times. He comes \n  &lt;BR&gt;to a halt and collapses. His optics go dim a=\r\nnd his spark joins the \n  &lt;BR&gt;matrix. Fascino takes Wrath&#39;s knife and puts =\r\nher rifle and 2 knives &lt;BR&gt;on \n  her belt. Fascino walks back over to the o=\r\nthers.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Quake: That was so goddamn sweet! I lov=\r\ned that! Damn! I wish I did &lt;BR&gt;that! \n  It was awesome!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Twister smiles. Death always made \n  her happy. Quake claps his han=\r\nds. &lt;BR&gt;Blizzard just stared.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Blizzard: Should=\r\nn&#39;t someone say something? Someone just died!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nVenomous: Yeah.....Your right.....I want his gun!..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Venomous runs up to Wrath&#39;s lifeless body and takes hi gun. \n  He &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;walks back over to the others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Venomous: The \n  =\r\ngun of a an ass becomes the gun of a cool bounty &lt;BR&gt;hunter!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Blizzard stands up.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Blizzard: Fasc=\r\nino, your \n  my friend! How could you do that! Haven&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;you ever lost so=\r\nmeone?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fascino: I&#39;m not your friend.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Blizzard: Not only was that cold and brutal, but you ch=\r\neated!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fascino: That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Twister: Amen.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Blizzar=\r\nd: No! That was awful! He \n  wanted a clean fight!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Fascino: Clean? He wanted me \n  dead so I patched things up betweem &lt;BR&gt;u=\r\ns. Go ahead and ask him...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quake: WOO! This is=\r\n a hoot!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quake \n  claps his hands.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Blizzard: It was wrong!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Twister: S=\r\nhe&#39;s right.....You should have flushed his spark \n  down the &lt;BR&gt;toilet. Th=\r\nat would have been perfect.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Fascino: I guess s=\r\no...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Blizzard: Doesn&#39;t anyone \n  agree with me?&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; No one says anything.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Blizzard: Well, FINE! I&#39;ll do well on my own!...Twister, \n  your my &lt;BR&gt;si=\r\nster and don&#39;t seem to care? Is that how it&#39;ll always \n  be?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; No one says anything. Blizzard turns and starts \n  walking away=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Blizzard: Then bye.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Twister stands up and runs up to Blizzard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  B=\r\nlizzard: Hmm?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Twister: You forgot \n  something...=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Twister pulls out a small rifle and \n  presses i=\r\nt to Blizzard&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;stomach. She pulls the trigger and Blizzard&#39;s \n  guts s=\r\npray from the &lt;BR&gt;hole in the back. She collapses and her spark leaves \n  h=\r\ner body. &lt;BR&gt;Twister shoots the spark, sending sparkles all around. Quake \n=\r\n  claps &lt;BR&gt;his hands. Venomous runs up to Blizzard&#39;s corpse and takes her =\r\ngun. \n  &lt;BR&gt;Fascino starts to walk away.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quake: W=\r\nhere ya \n  going?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fascino: I&#39;ll know sooner or la=\r\nter...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Venomous: If you die, tell me, cause I&#39;=\r\nll want your \n  gun.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Twister: Your leaving, huh? =\r\nWell, good kill and \n  bye.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fascino: Yeah...Well.=\r\n..I guess the way I travel \n  is quite like a &lt;BR&gt;female I met before...I&#39;m=\r\n solo...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fascino smiles and keeps walking. Qua=\r\nke eyes the large scar on \n  &lt;BR&gt;Fascino&#39;s back. From one shoulder to her h=\r\nip.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Quake: Did that hurt!?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Fascino doesn&#39;t answer Quake. \n  Then Armada, who was silent through=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;the whole thing, stands up and runs \n  off.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nTwister shakes her head.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Twister: I doubt eith=\r\ner one will survive survive.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Venomous: Remembe=\r\nr, I want their guns!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Quake: Who&#39;s up for poke=\r\nr?...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ~~~~~~&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Birdbot \n  turns around, hea=\r\nding towards the Chivtron base. Papertron &lt;BR&gt;follows on the \n  ground.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Birdbot: I&#39;m going to get that slut that \n  took my =\r\nfriend.

She let out ti=\r\nny whimpers and shreiks. \n  &lt;BR&gt;Then she screamed. She stood up and with a =\r\nknife she cut her \n  &lt;BR&gt;shoulders. She sighs cuts a single letter on chest=\r\n. An S. She smiles \n  &lt;BR&gt;and kicks the wall she was leaning on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mantella: \n  Hey! Anyone in this old shitty mine cave!? Huh=\r\n!?
