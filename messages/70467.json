Like this last one. You will become one with\nthe horde like he will.&quot; the creature said, its voice much rougher\nthan it had been before, obviously from the damage it had just taken.\n&quot;Your techological advantages and distinctiveness will be added to our\nown and wel will be stronger.&quot; It turned its cannon on Hydras it it\nprepared to fire. However instead of firing on Hydras his chest\nerupted in flames and smoke and it fell over!\n\nBehind the creature stood Cyclonus, his cannon in hand, it is obvious\nthat he had fired the felling blow, and also obvious that he had not\nbeen unconscious only dazed, and Hydras&#39; attack had allowed him to\nfire on him as well.\n\n&quot;Sir.&quot; Cyclonus said as he stepped foward, his legs a bit shaky,\nobviously he was also heavily damaged. &quot;We have recovered Scourge, but\nhis two drones were taken before I got here.&quot; Cyclonus glanced at the\nfallen creature. &quot;We will need to get Scourge some medical attention.&quot;\n\nIguanus and Inferno had already stepped foward to pick up the fallen\nforms of Scourge and Bruticus-X.\n\nFractyl, who should have been recovering Insecticon was instead\nlooking at the fallen creature, his optics curious, he was reaching\nfoward to examine it . . .\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
