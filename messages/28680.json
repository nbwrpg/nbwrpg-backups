Already she knew which race of the metal beings she would be \nstudying, wondering when Biomass would give the order for them to go out and \nconnect with those races.\nNue&#39;e looked around the ship from where she sat on the floor, looking over \nat Stratus as he groans and stood up.\nHer nature was a little skittish, always looking before she took the leap.\nBut Sublime, on the other hand, was the fun loving type. Taking advanture \nand danger with ease...and probably getting in trouble that she could have \navoided if she would have thought first.\nNue&#39;e didn&#39;t really find Sublime as the kind she could relate to and become \nfriends, more like the kind who would probably make fun of her or something \nsuch as that.\nNue&#39;e gave Sratus a &quot; be nice!&quot; glare when he spoke at Biomass, getting to \nher feet and pushing her glasses back up the bridge of her nose.\nShe stood off to the side a bit when she saw Biomass snap his head towards \nStratus.*\n\n&quot; We&#39;ll leave when we leave and not before, Stratus.&quot; Biomass said sternly \nbefore looking his crew over.*\n&quot; We have a few things to go over first. You all know what you have to do \nbut we&#39;de better eat and get ourselves charged before we go embarking on the \nmission. Once fed you can leave when you like. But for myself, I&#39;ll go now.&quot;\n\n* Biomass looked at Nue&#39;e.*\n\n&quot; You and I go to the same place but you can catch up later.&quot;\n\n* He turned and headed towards the door...which just suddenly appeared in \nthe side of the room. It closed and sealed itself behind him, a hole in the \nfloor appearing where water lapped at the edges.\n           Outside the ship a giant grey squid jetted away from the great \nmass of the ship, stopping in surprise when a smaller seahorse joined him in \nthe direction he was going.\nBiomass&#39;s eyes narrowed.*\n\n&quot; Nue&#39;e, I thought I told you to stay and eat something. This is nothing to \ncharge into with an empty stomach.&quot;\n\n* Nue&#39;e only looked at him and then ahead.*\n\n&quot; I wasn&#39;t hungry.&quot;\n\n* If there was anything she was, it was eager to see just what this new \nworld was like.\nSo both headed towards a chunk of land several KM away from theyr current \nposition, Biomass estimating that they would reach it by evening.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
