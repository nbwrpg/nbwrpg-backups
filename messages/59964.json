Wolfblade and\n&gt; Malice are working on a repulsion beam mod for the\n&gt; gun, with Malice as the power source. Bloodblade is\n&gt; a\n&gt; Minion, and the others are all working on the Uber\n&gt; Gun. Not sure what the Preds are upto.  Oh Yeah, and\n&gt; if the Maximals have alarms rigged on the Ark, they\n&gt; all went off, cause Shadowcaster just entered the\n&gt; Ark\n&gt; and Assimilated the matrix in an attempt to commune\n&gt; with Primus (read the posts Matrix Gambit and Matrix\n&gt; Quest, for more info on that).
