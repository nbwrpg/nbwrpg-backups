The \nmissle flew just inches over his head.  Speed Viper fired 3 optics at Rixer \nas he jumped backwards.  During his jump he twisted to where he landed right \nin front of Hot Rod.  He then swung his two swords at Hot Rod.  Left at Hot \nRod&#39;s Right leg, and the Right at Hot Rod Left Ear.\n\n\n&gt;From: RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Maximals in battle\n&gt;Date: Mon, 16 Jul 2001 23:05:46 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;::Rixer::\n&gt;\n&gt;He brought his hands up protecting his face. The blade sliced through a\n&gt;bit of his arms causeing a lot of pain. The other one slashing across\n&gt;his waist. Rixer droped in pain, but tryed to sweep Speed Vipers legs\n&gt;out.\n&gt;\n&gt;While this was going on, Hot Rod manuvered around, getting behind Speed\n&gt;Viper. He fired a missile right at the back of Speed Viper.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
