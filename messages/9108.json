He nearly smiled to himself as his scanners detects both Reptilica and Bloodystrike jump for the detonator and collide with each other, neither bot getting possession of the device and it bouncing harmlessly towards Zardus. But even as most of the confusion was going down he knew, this was IT. Battle was NOW!\nWith a glint in his optics Dinobot snapped his body towards the enemy just as Scattershot and Breakdown launched into the air after Prowl, his muscles tense and his entire system revved for battle as Pyro ran towards him. His optics then quickly snapping towards Scavenger and Hiss as they begin to advance towards them. Keeping an optic on every one of them as he began to move back a few steps, making sure that Tavatron was directly behind him so any shots aimed at her would hit him instead.\nHe knew that she could take care of herself but there was no point in letting her become damaged when there was no true need for it.\nThen, his slow retreat away from the enemy stopped.\nDinobot stood there, facing the advancing Alliance bots with a snarl on his lips and his teeth bared. Watching their every step and on alert for any mistakes they made, any that he could then take advantage of.\nHe KNEW that the odds of him beating all them were fairly slim, but those small odds that he would succeed counted as well!\nSuddenly his attention was diverted to yet another signature in which made itself known upon his scanners, it was that of�Breakdown! Quickly locating the very position of the new bot he also discovered that he was ready to fire ammunition�in HIS direction!\nThere was almost no time to react as Breakdown�s pot shots emerged from his weapon and headed for the reptilian warrior.\nWith no thought but reaction Dinobot snarled and suddenly took one large step backwards, still staring towards the advancing Alliance bots. Seconds later the ground in front of him exploding with the impacts of the pot shots, a small cloud rising as the scaled Maximal simply looked on towards the approaching enemy.\nThough the call had been close it was still no real concern to him, having delt with worse in the past.\nGlancing around at the approaching enemy he quickly analyzed the situation, vastly outnumbered, outgunned and outweighed�there was no chance of defeating such forces this day.\nAs much as he hated to think of it, retreat was the wisest of choices this moment.\nDinobot clenched his fist and growled at the sheer thought of deserting in the face of an enemy, it simply wasn�t�wasn�t�RIGHT!\nWith a growl of clear annoyance he noted each position of every enemy advancing towards Tavatron and himself, taking careful notice which ones were the closest and furthest. But so far there was only one bot in which was close enough to be a real concern�and that was Pyro!\nSnapping his head in the bots direction he quickly locked on with his laser sight a fired, more then 4 laser guided charges were then heading for the unlucky bots chest-plate.\nThen taking five carefully placed steps towards the other advancing few Dinobot sighted and locked onto Scavenger, yet, when he fired it was not guided charges in which were sent but a widely spread ray of paralyzing energy.\nThen, hearing the approaching steps of Hiss he turned in his direction and again sighted, the pot shot in which was sent by the enemy hitting him in the shoulder-plate. A small trickle of mech-fluid flowing from the open gash.\nDinobot snarled and locked onto Hiss�s head, sighting right between his optics and firing 3 rapid charges. Ignoring the sting in which the open wound caused.\nThen turning around and facing forwards he looked just in time to see Double Punch fire a missile towards his chest plate, reacting quickly he simply swiped it aside nano-clicks from impacting with his armor. Sighting, locking and then firing off 7 rapped charges towards Double Punch, knowing that it was actual suicide to just stay there and fight against odds like this!\nToday would not be his day of victory�and knowing it didn�t make things better.\nBut then a sudden idea hit him, something that he had not thought of before.\nThere was forest to his back, thick and dense. So dense that they would be able to escape without too much worry that the enemy would pursue them.\nWith less then a glimmer of thought he transformed into beast mode and backed up to Tavatron, coming up right beside her.\nWithout taking his eyes off of the enemy he growled�*\n\n� Get on.�\n\n* He stood there uneasily, shifting his weight from one foot to the other as he waited for Tavatron. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
