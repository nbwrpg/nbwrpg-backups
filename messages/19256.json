I almost got kicked out for\nmaking such a big gestalt, he was 30 feet tall and JP actually kicked me\nout. Well, he didn&#39;t remove me from egroups, and I just corrected the\nmistake and backed up everything I did. And I can&#39;t RP a gestalt correctly?\nI have been doing it for some time, now...\n\n\n&gt; Dark One barrell rolled, escaping autogun fire, letting two missiles loose\n&gt; downward at the Mafia Base.\n\n(Ay ay ay) Base damage: Not much, as usual, except the shields were weakened\nby the more powerful than grenade, thingies...\n\n&gt; Breakdown cursed, not seeing any body parts fly.  He obviously hadn&#39;t hit\na\n&gt; target.  He fired off a grenade at Shokaract.\n\nShokaract hadn&#39;t expected a grenade. It blasted on him. He got up with a\ngroan, looking for the damaged area. He knew where it was when he seen an\narm missing. He grabbed the Gattling Gun with his left hand and fired a\nmissile at Breakdown, fireing the other 2 missiles at WarMachine.\n\n&gt; The three missiles explode, driving Pyro back several feet, leaving the\nfront\n&gt; end of his tank mode dented and charred.  &quot;FLAMES CAN&#39;T HURT ME!&quot; he\n&gt; screamed, firing off three fire balls at Shokaract.\n\n(Why is it when you attack you make a bunch of guys attack the same bot? You\nthink you can psyche people out?) Shokaract leapt out of the way, landing\nirregularly but it didn&#39;t matter, he was missing his right arm anyway.\n\n&gt; Hiss fired off three fusion blasts at Shokaract.\n\nShokaract is hit in the head by the blast, his horns on one side falling off\nand clattering to the ground. Shokaract gets angry, he jumps up and gets\nready for another attack. His smaller gun mounted on his back. (The figure\ncan do that, Rampage can, so I guess Shokaract can, too.)\n\n&gt; Serpentor hissed, charging Shokaract, his energy blade in one hand, his\n&gt; plasma rifle in the other.  &quot;Time to die!&quot; he yelled as he fired off three\n&gt; bolts from his rifle at Shokaract&#39;s abdomen.\n\n(Yep, at Shokaract, Serge is there, you know.) Shokaract cartwheeled out of\nthe way with the crab legs on his shoulders. He fired from the little gun, 2\nshots at Serpentor. Serge fires 2 missiles at Serpentor.\n\n\n"}}
