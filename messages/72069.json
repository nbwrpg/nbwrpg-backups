He\n&gt; spread his feet apart as his he =\r\nbrought his large axe into a ready\n&gt; position.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No Firehorn!&quot; came a f=\r\nemale voice that was somehow almost right next\n&gt; to WHEELIE &quot;He bear&#39;s the =\r\nsignature of the other who came through here\n&gt; he must pass.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A female=\r\n seemed to almost melt out of the jungle&#39;s brush line and on\n&gt; to the path,=\r\n standing at nearly the same height as the other she\n&gt; looked much like FIR=\r\nEHORN only with a slight difference in coloration\n&gt; and of course she had a=\r\n more feminine build to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Astra you ask for much.&quot; FIREHORN said, =\r\nobviously ready for battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; ASTRA turned to look at WHEELIE, &quot;Why is i=\r\nt that you seek for death\n&gt; when it was not our desire to give it?&quot; She loo=\r\nked genuinely confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a grunt from FIREHORN, &quot;Perhaps his =\r\nbrains are addled, you\n&gt; hear his strange speech.&quot; He straightened, but kep=\r\nt his axe still\n&gt; before him. &quot;The other did not speak this way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\nstrange thing about all of this is that niether figure was showing\n&gt; up on =\r\nsensors. It was as if they were not there =96 and yet there they\n&gt; were. Ev=\r\nen the building seemed to have similar properties.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nAt =\r\nthis point, WHEELIE had found two things.  That this group was not exactly =\r\nfriends, but nor were they enemies.  Not registering them on his sensors, a=\r\nnd not seeing any faction insignias upon them made him much more cautious. =\r\n But they also did not seem like Unicronians, for such would have attacked =\r\nhim or tried to play a sort of game.  So, with his energon slingshot over i=\r\nn his hand, and still charged, glancing up at the group he gave a bit of a =\r\nbow.\n\nThen, piping up, &quot;As much as it intrigues me to say, you are a myster=\r\ny that we have found out today.&quot;  Wheelie continued, going on, &quot;And I don&#39;t=\r\n know, why are you here, what do you do, and whom was the one here that you=\r\n spoke of that do?&quot;  His speach falling into old patterns now.\n\nGlancing at=\r\n the female, whom had identified herself as ASTRA, WHEELIE then spoke, &quot;HOw=\r\n does one know who would stamp out life?  For in this world, many are here =\r\nwho give strife?  It is better to know, when knows one does not, who is an =\r\nenemy and who shall not rot.  For when one sees what one does not know, a d=\r\nirect method is the way to go.  For I do not konw if you are my friend..&quot;  =\r\nTapping at his Autobot symbol, and hten pointing at their lack of insignia.=\r\n  &quot;And I do not konw if you are my enemy, and thus I must be ready to defen=\r\nd.  So, in that case, the way to go..  Is do something that will let out th=\r\ne emotion and it to flow.&quot;\n\nStill glancing up at ASTRA and FIREHORN warily,=\r\n he continued his speaking, &quot;I do not know for whom you fight, or if you wi=\r\nll try to send me into this bad night.  But for what I know, and what you h=\r\nave here, something strange is about, and it is near.  I go in search of my=\r\n friend, to find out if he has met his end.  I do not know if he was who ca=\r\nme near this place, or someone else did who showed his face.  So please, do=\r\n let me know, what you hae seen and has come to go.&quot;\n\nTelling, essentially,=\r\n &#39;why&#39; he had acted the way he did in his own roundabout style to try and b=\r\nait them, to see if they would attack him or restrain themselves and thus b=\r\ne identifiable.  And explaining that he had done so by their lack of factio=\r\nn insignia and the fact that there were many possible enemies on this plane=\r\nt, and thus one could never assume whom anyone was an ally of, or an enemy.=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
