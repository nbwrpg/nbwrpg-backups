There was a part of him that wan=\r\nted to blast the little Predacon for daring to tell him anything.

I need you for task&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n The affect of the command was almost instant as Rodimus stepped back from =\r\nCyclonus and Scourge and looked over at Perceptor. &quot;What&#39;cha need Percy?&quot; R=\r\nodimus said to Perceptor, happy for the moment that it was Perceptor and Hy=\r\ndras giving orders and not Cyclonus and his lap dog.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus, see=\r\ning the break in the tension also stepped back, pulling Scourge back with h=\r\nim. &quot;There will be another time Scourge.&quot; he said quietly, &quot;No need to figh=\r\nt this out here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Scourge nodded, &quot;Yes, there will be.&quot; he said da=\r\nrkly. His optics still watched Rodimus, his look almost hungry as he smiled=\r\n evilly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the tensions between Cyclonus, Scourge and Rodimus coo=\r\nled Zarak turned to look at Tuscon, wondering what information this bot cou=\r\nld hold. &quot;Come&quot; Zarak said to Darkhawk, &quot;Let&#39;s see what this Auto . . . &quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *BEEP*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zarak was caught in mid sentence by his scanner goi=\r\nng off, the hand held one that he had been keeping trained on Tuscon.
