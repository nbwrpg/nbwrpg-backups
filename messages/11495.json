Then he\nturned towards Dinobot.  Hell Drak listened to Dinobot&#39;s words closely,\nthen spoke.\n\n\t&quot;Woa, sorry!  I didn&#39;t know you Maximals were such babies!&quot; She hollered\nout.\n\n\tNecromancer looked at his sister again, this time with a seriously angry\nexpression.\n\n\t&quot;Sister!!!  That&#39;s enough!!!  You heard what he said, show some respect! \nAfter all, we came here to help the Maximals, not mistreat them!&quot; He turned\nto Dinobot, with less tension, &quot;Sorry, about that.  Please forgive her.  I\nknow forgiving her may be hard, but really, she&#39;s ok.  Anyway, you asked\nabout our qualifications eh?  Well, we said we&#39;re elites, and we wouldn&#39;t\nlie,&quot; Necromancer looked at Hell Drak, &quot;Well, at least I wouldn&#39;t lie to\nyou.  I will show you some of my skills on those two trees over there,&quot;\nNecromancer said and pulled out his laser disc shooter. \n\n\tHe fired a fairly large laser disc at the first tree, and then it sliced\nright through the tree, making the big piece of it fall down in between the\ntwo trees.  Then Necromancer fired a disc at the other tree, and it fell on\ntop of the other tree.  \n\n\t&quot;I give you the honor of finishing them off, sister,&quot; Necromancer said,\nlooking towards Hell Drak.\n\n\t&quot;Allright, brother.  Very well then!!&quot; Hell Drak said as she ran over to\nthe trees.  The stood in front of the two piled trees, lifted her foot up,\nand stomped it down, right through them!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\tNecromancer walked back up near Dinobot, &quot;How&#39;s that??  Also, we assure\nyou that in a real battle, we aren&#39;t so merciless towards other bots,&quot;\nNecromancer turned to look at Hell Drak, but this time didn&#39;t say &quot;At least\nI&#39;m not so merciless&quot; because Hell Drak was standing right there.\n\n\n"}}
