It&#39;s turning into a bitter war over nothing. I think it needs \nto be over with before it gets even worse. Kinger, what you sent \ncalling JP a name was unneccissary. I&#39;m not taking sides, but I&#39;m \ndispleased of what you sent. I don&#39;t like to see people mad over \nsomething petty. I suggest, if this is not settled peacefully soon, \nyou both apologize, nothing big, then get on with things.)\n\n\n\n--Talon\n\n\n"}}
