I don&#39;t mind being called \nfirefox or Tav, either name is fine with me.)\n\nTavatron spun and twisted her staff as she blocked Dark One&#39;s plasma blasts \nwith her energon blades. She ducked and rolled to the right,  Hiss&#39; fusion \nblasts singed her fur as they flew overhead, barely missing her. Tavatron \nkneeled for a second, trying to make sense of the battle around her. The \ndust and flying debri overwhelmed her senses and stung her optics. She could \nbarely make out her attackers, much less avoid their shots.\n\nTavatron turned her head, the dust momentarily clearing as she slowly got to \nher feet. Suddenly Tavatron flew forward, her staff landing a few feet away. \nShe groaned softly as she got to her feet, Breakdown&#39;s sonic blast had found \nit&#39;s mark. Tavatron unsheathed her drill sword and growled, returning his \nfire with two optic blasts of her own:\n\n&quot;You&#39;ll have to do better than that!&quot;\n\nShe then turned to Hiss and Dark One and returned their fire with several \noptic blasts at each of them.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
