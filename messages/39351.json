That&#39;s all I need to know for now.&quot;\n\n* And with that she continued walking towards HotRod&#39;s position, soon seeing \nhim and their guest in sight.\nIf one looked at her now she appeared pretty impressive.\nCovered head to neck in thich, black armor. Large shoulder-plates, flowing \ncape and steps that nearly rattled the city. Impressive or not, it was \nunwise to get on her bad side.\nAnd with a metal ring of resting armor she came to an eased stop beside \nHotRod.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m here.
