Bullets whiz into the trees around him. He frowns \nthinking to himself, &lt;&lt;Seekker? Proabably&gt;&gt; and he waits lying on \nthe ground out of view. He starts to crawl along, away from the \nChivitron base, trying to get behind the enemy.\n\nThe laser beams hit the pod Axis is hiding behind and disipate. He \nquickly brings his weapon over the pod, and fires a laser at \nBarrymore. He then arcs a missile over the pod at Barrymore&#39;s last \nlocation. He is pelted by bullets and gapes at Seekker, &quot;What are \nyou doing!?! Get them, not me!&quot; He keeps hiding, not wanting to be \nhurt. He never known for his courage.\n\nLynxiz slips three more disks into her launcher, looking for a new \ntarget. Spotting another enemy who was attacking Termitron, she \nsets up her disk launcher, and fires three disk at Stranato.\n\n\nOn 7 Jul 2001, at 17:37, Jordan Guthrie wrote:\n\n&gt; Seekker ran out of the chivtron base his miniguns firing like crazy.\n&gt; Noy aiming at any particualarly ten shot went at Mcgowan and the other\n&gt; 14 split going at Lokk and Axis.\n\n\n"}}
