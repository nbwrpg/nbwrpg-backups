WORK in that place, I wanted it undetectable and secure; this\n&gt; is a temporal refuge, but we will remain there a while...&quot;said Hydras while\n&gt; he typed an encoded message to his &#39;Tutor&#39; &quot;I&#39;m interested in your offer, my\n&gt; tutor, for the blank protophorm and a base... say your price...&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nCyclonus, who is actually walking with Hydras nodded, &quot;Yes sir.&quot;\nCyclonus&#39; words were cool and confident. Cyclonus looked as if he had\nsustained damage in the battle, but not enough were he was in vital\nneed of repairs.\n\nCyclonus paused to begin speaking into his radio, obviously giving\norders to different ones. With a gesture he sent Deepstryke to the\nrepair chamber and Scourge as well. Both of them looked more damaged\nand would need a few hours of repair or more to be ready for duty.\n\nWith a curt nod they both began walking towards the base.\n\nHowever from Taratulus there was a small pause before he responded,\n&quot;Yes.&quot; he said craftilly. &quot;This &#39;base&#39;, if you want to call it that,\nwill need a lot of work.&quot; There was a bit of grumbling on Taratulus&#39;\npart, although it was too low for the radio to pick it up clearly.\n\n Hydras also got an answering call from Cryotek, Hydras&#39; old tutor,\n&quot;Yessss.&quot; he said thoughtfully as his voice came over the radio.\n&quot;Ahhhh yes, the Base!.&quot; Scytoek&#39;s voice was at once joyous and\nvoctorius as  he answered Hydras&#39; call. &quot;I do believe you chose to\ndisdain my offer.&quot; Cryotek said, there was a note of chiding in his\nvoice. &quot;I had thought to send you to investigate it and bring back\nwhat you found. Now I had to make . . . shall we say . . . other\narrangements.&quot;\n\nThere was a pause from Cryotek and then a sly, &quot;Hmmmmm, perhaps there\nis something you can do for me. There are a few Predacons milling\naround at the old Relay City. They could be of use to me. Bring them\nto me and I shall consider your desire for the base.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
