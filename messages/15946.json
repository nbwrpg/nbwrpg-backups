If it is THAT important to you then send me\n&gt; the posts of your characters firing towards Dinobot that I&#39;ve obviously\n&gt; missed and I&#39;ll make sure he gets hit? Will THAT suit you enough?!\n&gt; Now, either drop it or send me the damn posts.)\n&gt;\n&gt; * Dinobot watched out over the battlefield, not even believing his own\n&gt; optics at what he saw.\n&gt; Nothing, absolutely nothing that was part of this small clearing even\n&gt; resembled the glade Tavatron and himself had stopped in a while back.\n&gt; The grass beneath their feet was churned up and now nothing but raw dirt\nand\n&gt; small sprigs of green poking up in the occasional place, the waterfall was\n&gt; now nothing more then a trickle emerging from crunched and fallen rock,\nthe\n&gt; stream itself simply a drying bed of small pebbles and dirt.\n&gt; I was all gone, every square inch of it.\n&gt; A deep growl emanated from between his tightly clenched jaw, his hands\n&gt; balled into fists with the deadly claws of his fingers digging through\neach\n&gt; palm.\n&gt; Yet, that only added to the pain he felt, and soon released his palms from\n&gt; the slow torture of his claws as they dug deeper and deeper with every\nspark\n&gt; beat.\n&gt; This entire place was gone, and he couldn&#39;t even say that it was the\nentire\n&gt; Alliances fault. It had also been partly his.\n&gt; They shouldn&#39;t have stopped here for such a long period of time, should\nhave\n&gt; just collected themselves and moved on. Then, perhaps this glade would\nhave\n&gt; been spared, and some other depth of the swamp would have looked like this\n&gt; instead.\n&gt; But it was too late to try and go back in time and fix mistakes now, this,\n&gt; once wonderful, place was gone, and there was nothing that anybot could do\n&gt; now to fix it.\n&gt; But, it also wasn&#39;t entirely the glade that made Dinobot&#39;s aggression\nrise,\n&gt; it was also the factor that he had forced himself to receive a defeating\n&gt; blow RIGHT at the beginning of the battle. And now he had missed the\nentire\n&gt; thing, without even getting so much as two shots in.\n&gt; THAT was the real downer, what made him realize that maybe he should have\n&gt; hung in there just a little bit longer before suddenly getting blown out\nby\n&gt; a jusault.\n&gt; However, he had also saved Prowls life in the process on taking that blow,\n&gt; one that could very possibly lead to his death now more then ever before.\n&gt; And the feathery bastard didn&#39;t even say, &quot;Thank you.&quot;\n&gt; But, that really didn&#39;t matter to him. The concern, if it was that, in\nwhich\n&gt; Prowl had expressed was good enough. For now.\n&gt; But, by now Prowl had gone of to do slag knew what, leaving behind the\nsense\n&gt; that he would need help getting back to the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; Well, that was what HE said anyway.\n&gt; Dinobot knew that he needed help, but he didn&#39;t want to burden anybot with\n&gt; his added weight so he wouldn&#39;t mention it.\n&gt; As long as he could stay on his feet and actually walk he would be fine,\nso\n&gt; he hoped anyway.\n&gt; However, there was one thing in which the damaged warrior didn&#39;t realize,\n&gt; nor notice until it was too late and nearly made his spark jump clear into\n&gt; his throat.\n&gt; Looking over the smoking battlefield one last time he then turned his head\n&gt; towards his blind side, clearly to see and pinpoint just where Tavatron\nwas.\n&gt; He hadn&#39;t seen her since he had been propelled into the trees by the force\n&gt; of Oblitercons blast, actually hoping that she would be alright.\n&gt; But then as he snapped his head towards his left, he came face to face\nwith\n&gt; exactly what he had been looking for.\n&gt; And quite frankly, it startled him.\n&gt; Dinobot growled at the sudden appearance of the fembot, backing up a step\nso\n&gt; that he could focus upon her in the process. His two dominant claws\nalready\n&gt; fit and extended to slice through what he had thought was the enemy close\n&gt; enough to strike, then turning out to be Tavatron once his optic focused\n&gt; properly.\n&gt; He relaxed slightly, but was a little unnerved that he had been surprised\nby\n&gt; her. Making him feel foolish and out of place his claws relaxing.\n&gt; A snarl trickling from his throat. *\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Slag! WARN a bot before you come up on his blind side!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * That was all he managed to say before he suddenly saw the concern in\n&gt; Tavatron&#39;s optics, making him stop and collect himself and completely\nforget\n&gt; any other things he was about to say.as well as a few curses.\n&gt; She was worried about him and he could see that, even though she tried to\n&gt; hide it behind an emotionless expression.\n&gt; But Dinobot had hid his own feelings behind such a look for years unknown,\n&gt; and he knew concern when he saw it.\n&gt; She looked.she really looked worried about him.\n&gt; His aggravated expression relaxed somewhat as he straightened himself, his\n&gt; hands simply falling at his sides as he head Tavatron&#39;s words.\n&gt; But, he felt the pain that he had felt before, the wounds about his body\nfar\n&gt; more then what they looked, but not all that serious as they seemed.\n&gt; They were basically only flesh wounds, ones that could be easily repaired\nin\n&gt; less then three mega-cycles.\n&gt; However, the pain of his wounds was the last thing on his mind. It was the\n&gt; concern in the fembots optics that his conciseness dwelled on now.\n&gt; Dinobot nodded once, still looking at her point blank.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Agreed. There IS nothing left here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * His sight then looking off again across the clearing, his body half\nturned\n&gt; towards it.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Except.your concern.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * He then looked back towards Tavatron, almost daring her to tell him just\n&gt; why she was so concerned about him all the time.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Even though it is not needed.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * And it wasn&#39;t.\n&gt; He didn&#39;t need her concern, and he wanted her to know that. He had far\n&gt; better things to worry about then himself at the moment, like getting her\n&gt; back to base and in one piece at the same time.\n&gt; Dinobot then looked off towards the direction in which the swamp lay,\nwhere\n&gt; the quickest path to the CF and Tavatron&#39;s safety lay.\n&gt; So, with less effort then he knew, he transformed into Beast Mode. The\npain\n&gt; of his wounds easing off and satisfied that the damage hadn&#39;t been\n&gt; transferred to this mode as well. Giving his robot mode the chance to gain\n&gt; power and maybe even begin slow repairs as they traveled.\n&gt; But now the pain was simply just a throb, and movement was easier now.\n&gt; Dinobot turned his head towards Tavatron, waiting for her to transform as\n&gt; well so that they could get going.\n&gt; It was still going to be a long, and difficult way back to base.*\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
