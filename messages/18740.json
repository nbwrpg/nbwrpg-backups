He looks down as he sees an\n&gt; explosion, his eyes widening as he sees it was Feline blowing up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Kill that bot!&quot; he growls into his comm-link, pointing at Grenade as he\n&gt; fires two dozen shots at him, reaching into a storage compartment for\nanother\ngun.\n\n(Yikes, everyone&#39;s after Grenade) Grenade moves quickly to the side and\nwatches as the shots hit the ground near him.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Bloodystrike flies up, missiles slamming into the tree behind him. He\nturns\n&gt; away from Sharpedge as he hears Zardus&#39; command, aiming at Grenade and\nfiring\n&gt; two dozen shots at him, pulling out another gun, holding it in his other\narm\n&gt; and aiming it as well.\n\nGrenade also jumped right into Bloodstrike&#39;s shots and is knocked onto his\nback.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica dives, getting out of the way of most of the shots, a few\nhitting\n&gt; him, making dents and cracks in his armor.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks down at Grenade as he hears Zardus&#39; orders, firing two missiles\nand\n&gt; 20 shots down at him.\n\nKracken quickly moves in the way and takes the shots for Grenade. He groans\nand twists his arm. It makes a crack as he puts it back in place, but it\nfell loose again. He aims up at Reptilica and fires 5 decent sized shots.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Havoc dives, stray shots passing him as he flies at Grenade on Zardus&#39;\n&gt; orders, sending a bomb and a barrauge of rapid laser shots flying at the\nbot.\n\nGrenade looks up to see the barrage. Kracken moves to Grenade, picking the\nsmaller bot up and throwing him into a pit made by the many missiles in the\nground. Kracken dives in for cover as the bombs lasers hit the ground, one\nlaser going into the hole and hitting Kracken, to where he didn&#39;t notice.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Repressor flies forward, getting a lock on Grenade. He didn&#39;t know why\nZardus\n&gt; wanted that bot particularly dead, but he didn&#39;t really care.\n&gt;\n&gt; Two missiles fly out at Grenade, along with dozens of machine gun shots.\n\n(Is a lock like homing?) The missiles homed into the pit. Kracken slapped\nhimself and put his shields on. BANG! Blasts them. There is silence from the\npit.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
