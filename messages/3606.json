She shook her head but then arrived at \nthe base as she was supposed to do and began to patrol it as she was told.\nHer mind spinning in a thousand different directions, mainly trying to think \nof why her commander had allied with the enemy.*\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n* Rage had wondered about in her normal way for a few days, looking for food \nand actually getting a few tasty morsels that tasted sweeter then anything \ndue to her hunger.\nBut on the fourth day of being on her own her primitive mind actually \nflashed towards a section of the past that reminded her about the bots who \nlived in the huge metal structures, wondering what they were doing in her \nown primitive way.\nShe had had a bit of a relaxing time on her own again but she wanted to \ninvestigate the new bots she had met and soon began off towards the base in \nwhich she had been led to by a bot named Scourge.\nThe ship was just as it had been before and she wrinkled her snout, it \nsmelled just like before too...like steel.\nShe sniffed around a bit but wasn&#39;t sure what to make of all of it, she had \nhad a bot take her here and it was strange to be there by herself.\nRage looked around a bit and kept investigating the area, if any bot noticed \nher then she was unaware of and was then easy to surprise.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
