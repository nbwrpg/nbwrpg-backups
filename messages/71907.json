It was often a look t=\r\nhat would come from the CMO, Ratchet when he was displeased about something=\r\n.  Straight Shot reads the look well, and swallows hard.\n\nRattrap too, sens=\r\nes that he is in for a major talking to, as he too remains quiet.  \n\nTucson=\r\n now takes his place at the head of the room, looking to all of them with a=\r\n quiet sigh.  But there was no mistake that he was not about to let anyone =\r\noff the hook that fast.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sure you are all aware of why you are here. =\r\n What happened in the med bay was a bit disturbing and I need to address th=\r\nat with all of you.  I&#39;m not going to point fingers at just one of you, bec=\r\nause I know that all of you could have approached each other in a more civi=\r\nlized manner.&quot;\n\nRattrap opens his mouth, but says nothing as Tucson holds u=\r\np a hand with that stern stare.\n\n&quot;Ulp, okay, Umm, yeah, I guess I just bett=\r\ner keep my trap shut.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot sinks in her chair.\n\n&quot; I hate it when=\r\n he has that look on his face.&quot;\n\nTucson now looks to her.\n\n&quot;I heard that.  =\r\nAnyway, as I see it, all of you are having a problem with each other becaus=\r\ne, in all truths, you really don&#39;t know each other as well as you think you=\r\n know.  Or else, you wouldn&#39;t be fighting as you have.  Now, I admit, I too=\r\n, have jumped to conclusions and I have been wrong myself.  I&#39;m going to wo=\r\nrk very hard to try and correct that.  But I also need you three to try and=\r\n iron out any differences you have against each other.  Therefore, with the=\r\n mission as urgent as it is, I am assigning the three of you to work as a t=\r\neam throughout the time it takes to put these matters to rest.&quot;\n\nRattrap an=\r\nd Straight Shot quickly gasp.\n\n&quot;WHAT?!&quot;\n\nRattrap protests first.\n\n&quot; But, bu=\r\nt, that talkn&#39; go cart started it!  We didn&#39;t even say a word ta that littl=\r\ne creepoid!&quot;\n\nTucson&#39;s eyes narrow.\n\n&quot; Ahh, ahh ahh...  No. No one points f=\r\ningers at anyone.  This is NOT what this meeting is about.  I see I have my=\r\n work cut out for me..  And under no uncertain circumbstances are any of yo=\r\nu allowed to fight against each other.  If I hear anything about any fighti=\r\nng among the three of you, there will be greater consequences to follow.  N=\r\now, as of today, you are a team, and you will work as a team.  Am I underst=\r\nood?&quot;\n\nRattrap and Straight Shot slouch in their chairs.\n\n&quot;Yes Sir.&quot;\n\nTucso=\r\nn nods.\n\n&quot; Good.  Wheelie, you understand what I&#39;m telling everyone right? =\r\n I&#39;m not singling anyone out, I&#39;m treating you all as equals.  I know you c=\r\nan all get past this, it will take time but you can do it.  Now, Leo Prime,=\r\n perhaps you have an area you wish to assign them to?&quot;\n\nStraight Shot and R=\r\nattrap look at each other.\n\n&quot;Trapped like rats.  Go figure?&quot;\n\nStraight Shot=\r\n Shrugs.\n\n&quot;Well, we had it comming Rattrap, we had it comming.&quot;\n\n--- In nbw=\r\nrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;adamsafran&quot; &lt;adamsafran@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In =\r\nnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sandy&quot; &lt;magicquartz@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot=\r\n and Rattrap arrive at the ready room right on time as promised.  The knew =\r\nthey were in trouble for something the first time they had to report, told =\r\nby Leo Prime.  They knew him well, and figured that they&#39;d get a real earfu=\r\nll from him.  But then a second transmission told them that Tucson would be=\r\n talking to them instead.  Straight Shot looks to Rattrap a little concerne=\r\nd.  She knew her brother well, and knew the tones of his voice when he was =\r\nserious about something.  She takes a seat as does Rattrap, who had to have=\r\n the first word.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m telln&#39; ya this ain&#39;t fair, Straight Shot.  =\r\nThat little go cart started it.  He just had ta open his trap and now we&#39;re=\r\n in serious scrap for somethn&#39; we so did not start!  It stinks like the tra=\r\nsh compactor in the garbage bay!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot sighs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; =\r\nTell me about it. And the worst part is, Tucson is giving the lecture.  I k=\r\nnow he&#39;s not gonna let anyone off easy, just by the tone of his voice, it s=\r\nounded serious.  I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re getting in trouble for sticking up f=\r\nor ourselves.  What&#39;s so wrong about that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She shrugs, as Rattrap=\r\n sighs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Ya got me Prickles.  Oh yeah, your new nickname.  No off=\r\nense.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She smiles.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nah, none taken, I like it.  Prickles=\r\n...  That&#39;s a new one.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rattrap tries to muster a smile.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot; Kinda like when I used ta call your brother, Wheels..  Hmm, now I think =\r\nI better call him Wings.  They&#39;re big enough. Anyway, I wonder what he&#39;s go=\r\nnna say ta us and what kinda punishments he&#39;s got planned. Ya know he&#39;s gon=\r\nna do that, right?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yup.  Guess we =\r\njust take what comes.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They now sit patiently and wait for Wheelie=\r\n to come in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, Wheelie walked over into the briefi=\r\nng room.  Glancing over at Rattrap and then over at Straight Shot, the smal=\r\nl Survivor said nothing, merely going ovr to sit.\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, not s=\r\neein LEO PRIME or RODIMUS present, he quirked his head about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Saying n=\r\nothing, then going to sit back down as he gazed upon the others and waited =\r\nfor what they had all been called in for, not making conversation and stayi=\r\nng quiet.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
