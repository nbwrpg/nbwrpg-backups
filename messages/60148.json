They needed the generator inside \nthe basalt sphere, so the easiest way would be to cut it open and \ninstall.  Malice drew his sword.  It looked like a hammered out \nbackbone.  It was more of a saw than a sword.  It also had cables \nrunning the length from the tip to the hilt.  When the bottom half of \nthe handle was unscrewed and slid inside the other half, it created a \nwhip like saw weapon.  Malice could also channel energy into it, \nmaking it more or less leathal.  In this application, Malice poured \nso of his stored energy into it, making it like a torch.  He plunged \nthe blade into the sphere and in a circular motioin, cut a cross \nsection wide enough to slide the generator inside.  He pulled the \nsection out and drew out the heat so he could set it down.  All that \nwas left was installing the generator and figure out where they were \ngoing to launch it.\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:WOlfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She was glad to be back in the lab.
