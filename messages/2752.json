Tavatron&#39;s wolfen teeth easily ground the soft bones into \na sand-like state. Tavatron swallowed, her appetite finally appeased. She \ntossed the remainder of the fish into the bushes, by now it had been reduced \nto nothing more than a small section of spine and a large blue tail.\n\nTavatron licked her fangs, wishing she had time to do more fishing. Tavatron \ninstinctively shook her head, trying to remove the majority of water from \nher soaked fur, with little success. Still dripping she sighed, she didn&#39;t \nwear water well.\n\nTavatron perked her ears at the sound of breaking bones and ripping flesh. \nShe gave Dinobot an inquisitive look before tuning to head out of the \nforest. They had better hurry, Prowl had ordered them back to base a while \nago, and now Iron Raptor had notified her to return, perhaps there was a \nsituation back at base they was not aware of. If so it could prove best if \nthey hurried:\n\n&quot;Iron Raptor sounded... odd when she spoke. If you don&#39;t object I would feel \nbetter if we ran back to base.&quot; Tavatron didn&#39;t wait for a reply, something \nwas up, she knew it. She took one last look at Dinobot then bolted out of \nthe forest towards the ark, making sure to keep her pace one that Dinobot \ncould easily catch up with.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
