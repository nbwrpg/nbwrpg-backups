But this \nwalking feather duster pushed all her buttons.  She spread out her \nwings to full span and looked at Lady Hawk. She  said in a an \nagrivated voice,&quot;One: I have not been cursed by being royalty. Two, \nYour tone of voice is that of a low life protoform. Third, I am not a \nserving bot. I am a warrior in the Allience. And I don&#39;t give a piece \nof scrap whether our guns bother you or not. They will kill you. And \nthat&#39;s all I care about.&quot;  She had her hands balled into fists and \nwas about to throw a punch at this very annoying, arrogant, ignorant, \nfemmebot.  She forced herself to calm down. She opened her link to \nZardus. &quot;I got this femmebot out here who said that she was sent by \nDevilduer to come here and join us. I have my opinions on the matter \nbut that is your decision.&quot;  She looked at LadyHawk. &quot;Wait here \nuntill Zardus arrives for you.&quot;  SHe slammed the entrance door on \nLadyHawk and fumed .  She was totally and completely filled with rage \nand hatred for that walking pile of feathers and frill.  She leaned \nagainst the door and waited for Zardus.  She knew she would have to \nwork with the feather brained thing ouside the door if Zardus \ncommanded her to, but that didn&#39;t mean she would have to like it.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Deep down inside Lady Hawk felt almost insulted by the implication \nthat she\n&gt; might be Maximal. &quot;You will lower your tone in my presence!&quot; she \nexclaimed,\n&gt; folding her wings at her side to look more appropriate as \nroyalty. &quot;The\n&gt; rules of courtesy state that we conduct exchanges of words based on\n&gt; civility.&quot; the female bot stated as suredly as it had been told to \nher a\n&gt; cycle ago. &quot; Not according to the obvious difference in our social \nskills.\n&gt; The snide female looked down on Baterra without trying.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;To answer your first question I was sent here by DevilDuer to work \nfor the\n&gt; alliance&quot; she paused for a moment before breaking one of the rules \nof\n&gt; courtesy &quot;your second question I am a scientist working with DNA \ningrading.&quot;\n&gt; Her eyes met Battera with a holier than thou look that royalty so \noften has\n&gt; with a commoner. &quot;And your third question should be obvious even to \na\n&gt; serving bot that I am not a Maximal.&quot;:\n&gt; \n&gt; her gaze turned cold with disbelief that a nobody would have an \nattitude\n&gt; toward a higher being such as herself. &quot;And don&#39;t even consider your\n&gt; autoguns a threat, if I&#39;d worried about them they wouldn&#39;t still \nexist.&quot;\n&gt; Lady Hawk turned her back to Baterra as if to brush her aside, &quot;I \neliminate\n&gt; anything that I find&quot; She glanced back a moment to hint at her \nwords. &quot;A\n&gt; nuisance.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 05, 2000 7:13 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: It was worth a try\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Battera::\n&gt; &gt; She looked at the bot standing before her, a bot with the \narrogance\n&gt; &gt; of that to match  the size of the continant they were standing on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, Forgive me.
