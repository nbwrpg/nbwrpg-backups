His eyes \nwiden as he hears no sound, seeing holes open in his chest as Dinobot&#39;s \ncloaked claws go through him. Mechfluid leaks out of his mouth as he goes \nunconscious, sliding down to the floor.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl cringes as he hears Dark One&#39;s scream over the silencer. &quot;Couldn&#39;t be a \nbit quieter?&quot; he say into the device to Dinobot, moving over to Iron Raptor.\n\nProwl looks into her eyes, the same excitement he had always felt with her \nentering his systems. She was beautiful, far more beautiful than anything or \nanyone else in the world. He cringes as he thinks of what she could have gone \nthrough in the hands of the Alliance.\n\nProwl sighs. This was going to be risky, but he hoped there wern&#39;t any voice \nsensors in the room. Prowl deactivates his silencer, walking closer to Iron \nRaptor.\n\n&quot;Its me,&quot; he says quietly, placing his hand on her arm, &quot;Are you allright?&quot;\n\n"}}
