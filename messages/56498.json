I&#39;d be perfectly happy giving them up, in\n&gt; &gt; fact\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have another idea for a char that will either be\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; undisputed coolest char I have ever made, or be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instantly banned in a unamimous vote by the\n&gt; &gt; council. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Which brings me to question two.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.
