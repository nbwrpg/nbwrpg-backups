A scan reveals some\n&gt; sort of mechanoid, possibly minion in origin carrying a shape or mass\n&gt; that could possibly be Rodimus. The creature read as insect like,\n&gt; although the shape was unfamiliar. However the creature quickly\n&gt; continued down the tunnel out of easy scanning range.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also Perceptor may remember from a report from Scorponok that these\n&gt; tunnels used to lead all the way back to the Ark, beneath the Earth&#39;s\n&gt; ocean. Although it is unlikely that all the tunnel is still intact\n&gt; after all this time.\n&gt;\n&gt; However there is one notable fact in there: There was a fairly large\n&gt; chamber about half way or so that appeared to be filled with some sort\n&gt; of minion based technology. Scorponok&#39;s last view of the chamber was\n&gt; it being filled with magma. Whether it survived or not is unknown.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
