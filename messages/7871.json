Her ears swiveled back \nand forth as she tried desperately to pinpoint the location of the \ndisturbance. Her optics fizzled on and off. Her internal repairs had \nrestored her vision to the point where she could see partial images, \nbut her sight was still lacking when compared to that of a normal \n&#39;bot. Tavatron&#39;s growl deepened, something was definitely amiss. She \npositioned her head in order to get a better veiw of Dark One, only\nto see him cringe in pain then fall to the floor moments later. (I \ndon&#39;t mean to mode, if Yanshosh says different just change that one \nline to whatever he says.)\n\nTavatron was about to say something when suddenly her bonds were \nreleased. &#39;What&#39;s going on here?&#39; Tavatron wondered momentarily. A \nresue operation? It was a possibility, but one couldn&#39;t rule out the \nchance of a Predacon attack. In one fluid motion Tavatron rolled back \nthen forward, jumping to her feet. She wavered for a moment, but \nquickly regained her balance. She drew her sword and growled softly, \nstill unsure of the situation, but positive that someone other than \nthe two Alliance &#39;bots were present in the room:\n\n&quot;Who&#39;s there?! Show yourself!&quot;\n\nTavatron&#39;s gaze drifted to Iron Raptor, who also appeared to be free. \nA fortunate turn of events that helped settle her rising nerves. It \nwasn&#39;t like her to be so unsure of her surroundings, but given her \ncurrent conditoin it was something she had expected. First, however, \nshe wanted to know who her rescuer was:\n\n&quot;I will ask this only once more, who are you?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
