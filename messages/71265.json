Hydras knows Percep=\r\ntor&#39;s one of us now, how are \n&gt; we gonna fight &#39;em off if he tries another =\r\nattack on the Ark?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, in Legacy&#39;s chamber, Straight Shot now =\r\nsees why he was so \n&gt; concerned about the time space continum.  She had not=\r\n known what really \n&gt; happened, and at the time it did happen she had not y=\r\net been a part of the \n&gt; Autobot Faction.  She stands thoughtfully for a mo=\r\nment, now taking in what \n&gt; she had been missing for a long time.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Wo=\r\nw, that part I never did understand..  That sure explains things. I&#39;m \n&gt; gl=\r\nad I did talk to you, Legacy.  So by doing what he did, Starscream saved \n&gt;=\r\n our faction...  I&#39;ve only heard bits&#39;n pieces about Starscream&#39;s \n&gt; relati=\r\nonship with Megatron, and from what I learned, they never did see eye \n&gt; to=\r\n eye. Anyway, thanks for the explanation and the video feed, it was really =\r\n\n&gt; useful. I better let ya get ta the bridge now.  Thanks again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She =\r\ngets down from where she was standing and bids Legacy good bye for the \n&gt; t=\r\nime being.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonu=\r\ns@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nigthlight dificulty sat down hoping=\r\n to see her daughter coming and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only thing that she saw was a spo=\r\ntted hurricane coming to her and before \n&gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could do something=\r\n she felt a impulse backwards and fell in the bed; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; warm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tiny=\r\n tongue licking her and a furry cheek in hers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;MOM!!!

He had even leaned back a little to allow the two to hu=\r\ng and\n&gt; &gt; show affection. That is until ELITA&#39;s last statement and he could=\r\n see\n&gt; &gt; the look on NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Smiling warmly and nodding =\r\nRODIMUS took NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s hand. &quot;Yes,\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor has been instrumental i=\r\nn your recovery.&quot; Leaning back in he\n&gt; &gt; continued to smile at her, hoping =\r\nto wipe away her fears if he could.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;From what we can tell, Percept=\r\nor has joined the Maximals.&quot; RODIMUS\n&gt; &gt; rubbed ELITA&#39;s head giving her rea=\r\nssurance and affection as well.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Just like our daughter here has said.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ******************************************\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Perceptor walked close to  Lord Elder and shook his head  and said &quot;It=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; highly unlikely that that happens &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Outside, Uproar catches up to Lord Elder, as he observes the private \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; code\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on  Tuscons door.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Wow, so, I guess Tucson and=\r\n Talon are kinda gonna be like Rodimus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight.  I wonder if T=\r\nucson will ya know..  Have a family of his own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some day?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NE=\r\nW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ELDER looked away from the door, his optics reddening slightly. =\r\nIf he\n&gt; &gt; were human it might even seem like a blush. &quot;Who can say Uproar, =\r\nwho\n&gt; &gt; can say? I would imagine that that is something that we may all wan=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; to do at some point.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; TORCA and NOCTORRO walked with ELDER as=\r\n well, their large forms\n&gt; &gt; swaying as they walked, the sound of their foo=\r\ntsteps large and heavy\n&gt; &gt; as their metal booted feet hit the deck plating.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We still must talk.&quot; TORCA said looking at ELDER, his tone somber=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; resigned. NOCTORRO was tapping out a small message as they talked,=\r\n but\n&gt; &gt; he looked up and nodded in agreement as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ELDER nodded=\r\n as he glanced at TORCA and then at the others. &quot;Uproar,\n&gt; &gt; why don&#39;t you =\r\nshow Perceptor around the base and help him get settled\n&gt; &gt; in, I would ima=\r\ngine he will need to find some quarters and perhaps a\n&gt; &gt; recharging chambe=\r\nr coded to his requirements.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *************************************=\r\n*****\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moving to Legacy&#39;s quarters, Straight Sho=\r\nt thinks for a moment before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying anything, which was her best of t=\r\nraits.  Once she had an idea of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what she wanted to say, she looks up =\r\nto Legacy, with an air of sincerity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always had for everyon=\r\ne, including her brother.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Thanks, for letting me talk to you,=\r\n I appreciate it.  I just wanted ta \n&gt; &gt; &gt; let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ya know that I think m=\r\ny brother doesn&#39;t quite understand where you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coming from and maybe=\r\n that&#39;s why he&#39;s so critical of your actions.  He&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always been like =\r\nthat, not just around you, but with me too, and yeah,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes it ge=\r\nts on my nerves.  But with things as they are, and what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened ta h=\r\nim in the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s put up such a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; defense\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and why he&#39;s so determined ta think off the pavement.  And maybe that&#39;s =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed with min=\r\ne too, at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Honestly though, how do you feel about his th=\r\ninking outside the box?  Is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a reason why you&#39;d rather no=\r\nt go that way?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For a moment LEGACY looked confused, =\r\nhis single crimson optic boring\n&gt; &gt; into STRAIGHT SHOT as his mind ran over=\r\n what she said.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I do not understand all of the colloquialisms than=\r\n you have\n&gt; &gt; utilized.&quot; He said at last, &quot;But I ascertain that you are att=\r\nempting\n&gt; &gt; to explain your sibling&#39;s actions to me and inquiring as to why=\r\n I will\n&gt; &gt; not allow Tuscon to disturb Optimus Prime&#39;s chassis.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; L=\r\nEGACY&#39;s optic flickered for a moment. &quot;I appreciate your intent.&quot; He\n&gt; &gt; sa=\r\nid his words clear and well articulated. &quot;But I do not require an\n&gt; &gt; expla=\r\nnation, since I have taken no offense to his actions; to do so\n&gt; &gt; would be=\r\n an inefficient use of my time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;However to answer your question I=\r\n will replay something for you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Turning to the screen that was sta=\r\nnding behind LEGACY he fired a beam\n&gt; &gt; of energy at it. But instead of it =\r\nexploding into shards of glass and\n&gt; &gt; debris it simply changed to show a m=\r\nountainous scene, a volcano, and\n&gt; &gt; then the volcano exploding to reveal t=\r\nhe Ark. It was obvious from the\n&gt; &gt; motion that the events were being speed=\r\ned up for ease of viewing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Soon after it happened a small satellite=\r\n like device rose up from the\n&gt; &gt; Ark and began to travel away from it and =\r\nafter a while return. After\n&gt; &gt; another short moment, short because of the =\r\nspeeded up play back,\n&gt; &gt; MEGATRON flew out along with STARSCREAM, SOUNDWAV=\r\nE and a few other\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon seekers, obviously having been repaired by=\r\n the device. They\n&gt; &gt; all land on a cliff and look back at the Ark, and STA=\r\nRSCREAM fires a\n&gt; &gt; blast at the Ark and they all fly off.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Inside t=\r\nhe Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMUS PRIME is\n&gt; &gt; also is =\r\nknocked into the beam and his repair process begins.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (OOC: This is =\r\nthe scene from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the bots and\n&gt; &gt; cons fell to ear=\r\nth and 4 million years had passed.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The scene fades to black.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;These sequence of cannot be disrupted.&quot; LEGACY intoned coldly.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wit=\r\nhout the Autobots none of you would be here.&quot; LEGACY turned back\n&gt; &gt; to fac=\r\ne STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;And without the Decepticon&#39;s attack on the Ark\n&gt; &gt; the Au=\r\ntobots will not survive.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEGACY folded his arms behind his back, &quot;=\r\nThere can be no disruption of\n&gt; &gt; the time flow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was a small=\r\n beep on LEGACY&#39;s panel causing him to look over at\n&gt; &gt; it. &quot;Interesting.&quot; =\r\nHe said curiously. &quot;It would seem that I am\n&gt; &gt; required on the bridge.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
