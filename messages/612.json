As much as he liked fighting with no \nweapons but himself he knew that he needed to conserve energy, this weapon \nthat he held in his palms was just the thing he needed right now in order to \naccomplish that factor.\nHe was about to explain to Tavatron that it all depended on the experience \nand weight of the occupant to decide what weapon to use when his scanners \nalerted him that danger was near.\nDinobot snapped his head towards the doors and growled deeply, they were \nhere!!\nHe grasped the rifle tightly as he approached the doors and put a tentative \nhand on them, they were outside...right outside!\nDinobot looked at Tavatron in a way that she wouldn&#39;t mistake it&#39;s meaning, \ntrouble was afoot. Battle was there...they just had too meet it head on.\nHe snarled...*\n\n&quot; Ready yourself, the time to face your fate has come.&quot;\n\n* Dinobot stepped away from the doors and kept his rifle trained on the \ncrack in the center where the two doors met, the first Predacon who came \nthrough those swinging slabs of steel would get the shock of his life!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
