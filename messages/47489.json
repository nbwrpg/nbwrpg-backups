If I don&#39;t get any emails, I&#39;m \ngoing to force someone to do it. =P (a necessary evil)\n\nI have volunteered myself to RP Megatron, so I&#39;m really only \nawaiting a volunteer to RP the leader of the Maximals. (not \nnecessarily Optimus Primal, etc. Past leaders can also be chosen if \nyou so wish)\n\nThe next thing is that I need to know how many bots are going to be \njoining each side. I&#39;d like the Predacons and the Maximals to have \neven or close to even numbers of bots at the start. I would like \neveryone to email me with what bots they are bringing in at the \nstart, Predacons or Maximals or both. That way I can determine \nwhether I need to create some balance, or leave it as it stands.\n\nI&#39;ll update my list with each email that I receive. The quicker you \nreply, the quicker the RPG will restart. I would like to put \nemphasis on people replying with private emails (x_rauq_x@...) \nbut I&#39;m not going to penalize anyone who makes the mistake of \nreplying to this post.\n\nSome people may be required to RP a predacon or a Maximal if there \nis the need. If you are one of those people, the character can be \neither temporary, or you can keep the char if you like.\n\n\n"}}
