As it\nhurled toward Earth somewhere in the Western Rockies of North America.\nIt streaked through the sky as a hurling ball of fire and landed\nstrike in the middle of a dense forest destroying everything around it\nfor miles. The bots stasis pod went in search for a body but because\nof the extensive damages it entered Emergency Life Mode and found the\nclosest thing for a body........\n\n\n"}}
