He eyes Frenzy and Rumble, who were already there, and then \nproceeds lie down, eye&#39;s closed.\n\nFrenzy frowns, &quot;I&#39;m bored... I wanna kick some autocrap around. \nWait, wait, wait... grrr, that&#39;s all we do here.&quot; He stands up and \nbegins to pace.\n\nRumble&#39;s eyes narrow at the though of destruction, and he \nsmiles. &quot;Lets find Soundwave, maybe he&#39;s got something for us.&quot; \nFrenzy nods, Spasstik perks up, and all three bots head for the \ncontrol room.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nSwitchblade grins maliciously as he picks up the damaged Megatron in \ngun form. &quot;Megsy, never thought I&#39;d see you in this position this \nsoon... no matter, I&#39;ll just make the bes--&quot; Megatron \ncoughs, &quot;Switchblade, you fool. Fix me and I shall reward you \ngreatly!&quot;\n\nThe small dark bot laughs, his eyes glowing green with intent. &quot;Now \nwhy, Megsy, do I doubt your words... Ah well, I won&#39;t have to listen \nto anything you say anymore.&quot; Megatron utters his final words, &quot;No, \ndon&#39;t you ca--&quot; as Switchblade disables Megatron&#39;s ability to \ntransform, and to speak, thus rendering the once great bot trapped \nquite effectively. &quot;Megsy, so sad... or not!&quot; He spends some time \nrepairing the weapon, changing the colour, modifying the design a \nlittle, camoflauging the once mighty Decepticon commander. The end \nresult is a sleek red and black hand pistol, with a particularly \nmenacing look to it.\n\nSwitchblade then moves over to Firestrike and continues working on \nthe larger fire oriented minion of his. He attaches the final arm to \nFirestrike, with a little modification: A pistol size slot on the \ninside of his arm, and a little mechanism that pops the pistol into \nFirestrike&#39;s arm. He then places the pistol into the slot, hidden \nfrom view. In addition to the pistol, and his orginal weapons, \nFirestrike had also been equiped with an enhanced flamethrower. This \nbot would be a significantly dangerous enemy to face, as long as he \ndidn&#39;t do too much thinking.\n\nHis eyes casting an evil glow around the room, Switchblade utters \nseveral words that signify the starting of a revolution. &quot;Arise, \nFirestrike.&quot;\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nMeanwhile, in the control room of the Dark Avian, Soundwave is \nconversing with his most cassettes, minus Switchblade.\n\n&quot;Rumble, Frenzy. No hostile activity has been detected yet, and \nalso, we&#39;re awaiting the recovery of Megatron.&quot;\n\nRumble shrugs, &quot;I guess we&#39;re waiting till something happens... \nSLAG, I hat waiting...&quot; He flops down on the floor, and stretches \nhimself out. Frenzy leans against the wall, and Spasstik sits \nobediantly at Soundwave&#39;s feet. Soundwave opens a commlink to \nBlindfear, &quot;Blindfear, what is your status? Soundwave out.&quot; He \nawaits an answer, totally unaware of what is coming...\n\n\n"}}
