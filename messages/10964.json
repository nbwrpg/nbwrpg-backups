You simply learn as you go. Come along and I&#39;ll show you. And\n&gt; as far as punishment.  You punish yourself harder than I would ever\n&gt; have punished you.  Don&#39;t worry about punishment.  Just being on thid\n&gt; planet with this war is punishment enough.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Land Mine reached out and grabbed her knife.
