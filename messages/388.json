Just be ready to activate fully if the Ark gets too \ndamaged.&quot;\nIRIS: &quot; Alright. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me...I&#39;m going to get back to \nmonitoring the systems. Bye.&quot;\n\n* The star disappears from the screen and the screen goes blank, Iron Raptor \nsat silently thinking about the battle to come.*\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
