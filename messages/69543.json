One was tall and slender, the other only sl=\r\nightly shorter, the details of their forms were lost in the dark shadows of=\r\n the cave where they stood. \n\nThe area outside the cave bore little resembl=\r\nance to the beautiful and idyllic settings that would one day be here. Inst=\r\nead the land looked almost battle scarred as the ground was mostly stone an=\r\nd dirt, with only a few tuffs of grass. Decades ago a massive volcanic erup=\r\ntion had swept over the area burning away the vegetation and life that had =\r\nonce grown here. Only now was the hand of nature was making itself once aga=\r\nin felt here as spots lifeless volcanic rock were grudgingly giving away to=\r\n new life and small plants were beginning to grow. Some distance away a riv=\r\ner forded itself along what was once a major lava flow, but so far only sma=\r\nll bits of life was yet able to survive in the waters.\n\nIt was to this view=\r\n that the two figures stood, only the red ember of their glowing optics cou=\r\nld be made out in the darkness. \n\n=E2=80=9CI have always found this view ca=\r\nlming=E2=80=9D said the taller of the two figures, his voice thoughtful. \n\n=\r\n=E2=80=9CYou would.=E2=80=9D said the other, his voice somewhat deeper, his=\r\n voice sarcastic, yet with a hint of respect, even as he himself also crane=\r\nd his head to look out at the scene. =E2=80=9CHmph! Even this ball of dirt =\r\nhas its destructive side.=E2=80=9D\n\n=E2=80=9CYes.=E2=80=9D said the first, =\r\nobvious by his tone, the leader of this duo. =E2=80=9CAll things do, if we =\r\ncan only find it.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe taller figured stepped forward, allowing th=\r\ne cold sun=E2=80=99s rays to reveal the purple hues of his armored form. He=\r\n glanced back at his companion, =E2=80=9CScourge, the time to depart this p=\r\nlace has come, I believe *they* have returned.=E2=80=9D\n\nScourge nodded as =\r\nhe too stepped forward, the revealing the blues and blacks shades of his fo=\r\nrm and the wing-like projections that sprang from his back. =E2=80=9CI can =\r\nsmell the odor of their vapor trails even from here.=E2=80=9D\n\nCyclonus gla=\r\nnced back at Scourge, wondering not for the first time, the true range of h=\r\nis companion=E2=80=99s tracking ability. =E2=80=9CWe must return to Megatro=\r\nn.

Explosive gasses and flames light up the air as =\r\nCyclonus climbed into the skies. \n\n=E2=80=9CAnd what if he=E2=80=99s not?=\r\n=E2=80=9D Scourge said as he followed his leader higher into the air. \n\nCyc=\r\nlonus said nothing as he continued to climb into the skies, leading them ba=\r\nck towards what perhaps might be either their home or their next battle gro=\r\nund =E2=80&quot; he set course for the black tower.  \n\n(And so it begins . . . )=\r\n\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus & Scourge)\n\n\n"}}
