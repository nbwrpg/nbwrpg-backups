She took a step back, staring him in the \noptics, then looked away, turning her dull crimson eyes at the ground. She \nsnorted before she said, &quot;I am Cyber Claw, a slagging freak!&quot; She sighed. &quot;I \nimpersonated you because that is the way I get around. I impersonate my male \ndouble because that&#39;s how I advoid the Maximals. Megatron put me up to it \nonce, and--&quot; She rolled her head, looking as if she was slightly embarassed. \n&quot;sometimes I just can&#39;t help it. Dinob--or your DNA is stronger than you \nthink. It slips sometimes. Mainly when I loose my temper. I came here with \nanother bot, I had to use the CR chamber due to my damage, and since I was \nin Maximal grounds, I had no choice but to do my act. And once I was here \nand no doubt that the Maximals knew about the Predacon, I took advantage of \nthe situation.&quot;\n\nShe looked back to Dinobot&#39;s face, and raised the side of a long strip of \nblack that went across above her eyes. &quot;Now that I answered your question, \nnow answer mine.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
