More \n&gt; Autobots were now on earth, and that made him sick. He silently \n&gt; flew up, away from the shuttle. He then spins aroung, holding his \n&gt; gun out, and pulls the trigger, sending a wave of energy towards \n&gt; the crashed shuttle. The burst hits it, and begins a chain reaction \n&gt; of explosions, and all that is left behind where the shuttle was is \na \n&gt; crater, and a huge explosion. This brings a smile to Motormasters \n&gt; fac but it leaves quickly. He starts to fly back to base, opening \nhis \n&gt; comm-link to the base, any robots in the presence of the base will \n&gt; hear it. &quot;I am returning to base, and will arrive shortly. \nSomething \n&gt; unfortunate has happened&quot;.\n\n\n"}}
