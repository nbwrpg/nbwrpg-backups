She smiles and chuckles. \nBarrymore stares and lights up a cigarette.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Barrymore: What are you going to do with that?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; McGowan: Hang it on the wall, I guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Stiller: I wanna eat it!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Lee: F*** you, Stiller! The wall is where it belongs!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Barrymore: Should burn it...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Stiller growls and eyes Lee. Depp scratches at his katana, trying \nto chip off dried blood. Barrymore coughes and blows smoke in \nStiller&#39;s face. He recoils.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Barrymore: We really need to start a fight or attack someone...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Virgo looks at the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Virgo: I still say we should go back kill that furry b*tch. That&#39;s \nall she deserves. Cold slow death...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Alba sighs and Barrymore offers her a cigarette. Alba takes it and \nBarrymore lights it for her.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; McGowan raises an eyebrow while staring at Sarge&#39;s head.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; McGowan: Damn this thing is ugly!\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; All of my alliance bots sit outside. Venomous looks at Quake.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quake: I remember when things were fine...I could sit back with a \nbeer and my troubles would be gone. And then I fell into a pit...A \npit of hell and sh*t...I ended up here...Man...I see where things \nwent wrong too...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister: Shut the hell up! Huh? How about that!? Shut up! I&#39;ve had \nenough of your stupid sh*t!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard stood up.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard: Twister, your not our leader! Sit down and shut up! I let \nyou push me around before, but not anymore! You don&#39;t have the right! \nWe can do what we want without your permission!...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino slaps her forehead, thinking that Blizzard&#39;s actions were \ninsane and brainless.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The whole time Venomous was shaking his head and waving his arms, \ntrying to get Blizzard to stop. Wrath lights up a cigarette and \nFascino slaps it away from him. He smiles for a minute but quickly \ncovers it up with a stale frown. Twister looks at Blizzard.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister: What the hell is this!? Daddy&#39;s little precious baby girl, \nfinally stands up for herself! Is that it? Well, you know what? It&#39;s \nup to you if you want to stand up for yourself! Cause you know what? \nYou don&#39;t count! You never did! Sit down!!!...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard sits down on the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister: That&#39;s what I thought...All talk...That&#39;s all...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard put a hand behind her back and looked at Venomous. He \nlooked at her and shook his head. Blizzard looks away and sighs.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino stands up, walking away from the others. Wrath follows her.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wrath: Kamodia, how about we fight, like in the old days? I&#39;ll beat \nyou again.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino: Up yours! I won back then, and I will now. And that&#39;s not \nmy name asshole! Battle with knives...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino pulls out a knife. Wrath pulls out a knife. The others \nwatch from a distance. Wrath runs at Fascino. Fascino drops her knife \nand pulls out a rifle and shoots Wrath in the head 5 times. He comes \nto a halt and collapses. His optics go dim and his spark joins the \nmatrix. Fascino takes Wrath&#39;s knife and puts her rifle and 2 knives \non her belt. Fascino walks back over to the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quake: That was so goddamn sweet! I loved that! Damn! I wish I did \nthat! It was awesome!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister smiles. Death always made her happy. Quake claps his hands. \nBlizzard just stared.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard: Shouldn&#39;t someone say something? Someone just died!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Venomous: Yeah.....Your right.....I want his gun!..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Venomous runs up to Wrath&#39;s lifeless body and takes hi gun. He \nwalks back over to the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Venomous: The gun of a an ass becomes the gun of a cool bounty \nhunter!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard stands up.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard: Fascino, your my friend! How could you do that! Haven&#39;t \nyou ever lost someone?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino: I&#39;m not your friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard: Not only was that cold and brutal, but you cheated!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino: That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister: Amen.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard: No! That was awful! He wanted a clean fight!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino: Clean? He wanted me dead so I patched things up betweem \nus. Go ahead and ask him...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quake: WOO! This is a hoot!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quake claps his hands.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard: It was wrong!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister: She&#39;s right.....You should have flushed his spark down the \ntoilet. That would have been perfect.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino: I guess so...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard: Doesn&#39;t anyone agree with me?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; No one says anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard: Well, FINE! I&#39;ll do well on my own!...Twister, your my \nsister and don&#39;t seem to care? Is that how it&#39;ll always be?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; No one says anything. Blizzard turns and starts walking away.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard: Then bye.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister stands up and runs up to Blizzard.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blizzard: Hmm?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister: You forgot something...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister pulls out a small rifle and presses it to Blizzard&#39;s \nstomach. She pulls the trigger and Blizzard&#39;s guts spray from the \nhole in the back. She collapses and her spark leaves her body. \nTwister shoots the spark, sending sparkles all around. Quake claps \nhis hands. Venomous runs up to Blizzard&#39;s corpse and takes her gun. \nFascino starts to walk away.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quake: Where ya going?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino: I&#39;ll know sooner or later...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Venomous: If you die, tell me, cause I&#39;ll want your gun.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister: Your leaving, huh? Well, good kill and bye.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino: Yeah...Well...I guess the way I travel is quite like a \nfemale I met before...I&#39;m solo...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino smiles and keeps walking. Quake eyes the large scar on \nFascino&#39;s back. From one shoulder to her hip.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quake: Did that hurt!?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fascino doesn&#39;t answer Quake. Then Armada, who was silent through \nthe whole thing, stands up and runs off.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister shakes her head.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Twister: I doubt either one will survive survive.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Venomous: Remember, I want their guns!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quake: Who&#39;s up for poker?...\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Birdbot turns around, heading towards the Chivtron base. Papertron \nfollows on the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Birdbot: I&#39;m going to get that slut that took my friend. I&#39;m going \nto kill her, and use her as a floor mat and eat Doritos!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Papertron: Cool! HEH!...HEH!...HEH!...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Birdbot: Yeah...I&#39;ll redrum her all over the base...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Papertron: Yeah! Or maybe some whiskey instead! Erf fer fer fer!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Birdbot: Here is my plan! I&#39;ll throw water all over the floor! That \nslut will slip on it and become easy prey! I&#39;ll poke her eyes out and \nfly into her face scratching her! Then when she&#39;s weak, I&#39;ll stab her \nwith a knife, and go for the heart! And then she is my icky door mat \nand I&#39;ll eat everyone Doritos and kill my ex-friend for betraying me!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Papertron: AWESOME! FAR! But...How can we get into the base? We&#39;re \nenemies now...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Birdbot: That&#39;s not important! We figure that out after their all \ndead!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Papertron: Oh...Okay...And I&#39;ll get some romaine lettuce! GREENS! \nAnd run through them! Erf fer fer fer! MY CONE TO YOURS!...\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Mantella breathes heavily. She let out tiny whimpers and shreiks. \nThen she screamed. She stood up and with a knife she cut her \nshoulders. She sighs cuts a single letter on chest. An S. She smiles \nand kicks the wall she was leaning on.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Mantella: Hey! Anyone in this old shitty mine cave!? Huh!? Well!? \nOkay, then...I&#39;ll make my name known...And I don&#39;t mean some shitty \nname gave to me by my drug dealing parents!...Call me Mantella, and I \ncall you dead! You call me Scan...Yeah, that&#39;s right...You heard it! \nAnd next time when I&#39;m dying, let me DIE!...Goddamn...Where I come \nfrom you let someone die if thats what they want!...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Scan lights up 5 cigarettes at once and starts smoking all of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Scan: Put on a f***ing circus or something, why don&#39;t ya?...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Scan drops all 5 cigarettes on the floor.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Scan: Hey! Someone&#39;s in the base that shouldn&#39;t be! Like, theresa \nmaximal and predacon! Or something!...Aw, shit...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Scan stomps the cigarettes out...She leaves the base and pulls out \na rifle while she walks off...\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Zoe stands outside with her arms crossed. She contacts all Trainers \non her commlink.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Zoe: Where the f*** is everyone!?\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; A spaceship soars through outer space...Heading towards earth...\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I plan for this ship to crash and be destroyed.\n\n\n"}}
