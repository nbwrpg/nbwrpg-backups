A few shots hit Surgital, \nbut didn&#39;t affect him.  Some shots went towards Alliance members, \nsome towards Maxis, some towards the CF, some towards \nSymphony&#39;s &quot;fellow&quot; Decepticons, and some towards nowhere.  Symphony \njust closed his eyes, and kept going around, and around, and around, \nshooting, and shooting, and shooting, like he just didn&#39;t care, his \nface without expression.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: airly2000@y... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, May 05, 2001 1:56 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Slaughter and the Dark Avian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Nightstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt;   Nightstrike shouted anger at Synphony &quot;COME ON, YOU LITTLE-BOT... \nIF \n&gt;   YOU WANT TO BE A WARRIOR YOU SHOULD SHOT AGAINST ALL YOUR \nENEMIES!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   After that he fired two missiles agaisnt LAvatron\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; OOC: That&#39;s okay, yah dont need to say sorry.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; BIC:\n&gt;   &gt; Wildrider noticed the apprehension in Symphony, but he didn&#39;t \ncare. \n&gt;   He\n&gt;   &gt; aimed at Lavatron again, and kept up the pressure, firing a \nhuge \n&gt;   spread\n&gt;   &gt; of lasers from his gun.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
