She felt like\nherold\n&gt; self again.  She came to a small pod which appeared to have been there for\na\n&gt; long time. She looked around, but didn&#39;t smell any other bots near by.\nShe\n&gt; tranformed into bot mode and checked out the pod.  She smiled and wondered\n&gt; if it was the answer to her situation. &quot;Perhaps I can use this to fix up\nmy\n&gt; little cruiser.&quot;  She opened up a panel and stuck her hand inside, trying\nto\n&gt; find the release mechanism for the propulsion ciruits.  She pulled her\nhand\n&gt; back as she felt something sharp puncture her skin.  She saw a strange\n&gt; spider biting her arm.  &quot;Get off me you little insect.&quot;(yes I know a\nspider\n&gt; is an arachnid and not an insect)\n&gt; She threw it to the ground and stepped on it, crushing it under her foot.\n&gt; She sneered at the pod. &quot;I&#39;ll not touch that thing again if it&#39;s going to\n&gt; bite me back like that.&quot;\n&gt; With that, she transformed into leopard mode and continued on her way.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
