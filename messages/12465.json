He briefly quivered his metal strips at his cheeks at her, but\n&gt; he knew she didn&#39;t see. He watched her go, for a few moments, until\n&gt; she was out of sight.\n&gt;\n&gt; In was in command. Again. But this time it was under Black Arachnia&#39;s\n&gt; orders, where he was happy, not where they were bots staring at him\n&gt; like there was something wrong with him.\n&gt;\n&gt; He shook his head and walked off. He walked to the ramp and opened\n&gt; it. He looked around carefully, not fully exposing his whole body. He\n&gt; looked for Vemonus.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
