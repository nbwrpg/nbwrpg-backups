My \ncomputer had decided to smelt on me and it has been in the shop for those \nweeks in which I was not able to RP. But now it is activating at it�s top \nfunctional peek and I shall be RPing regularly. I do apologize for any \nfrustration this has caused. And Fire Fox, it�s nice to see you back.)\n\n\n* Dinobot had watched both Necromancer and Hell Drak disappear into the \ndistance in the direction of the Cybertronian Fire, their huge shapes \neventually fading into the growing blackness of the night despite the moons \nsilver rays.\nNecromancer�s and Hell Drak�s appearance had been a complete surprise to him \ndespite his honed senses which were turned to all which was around him, \nfinally coming to the conclusion that it was his damage and fatigue which \nseemed to be dulling his abilities.\nAnd with a growl he acknowledged that it would also be his downfall if he \nwas in need of engaging in battle any time soon. However, he hoped that he \nwould be able to avoid battle until he was fully repaired. For, what was the \npoint of battle if you couldn�t engage in it?\nThough his joints were stiff from the rescue earlier that day, the tree \nhopping and the wound on his chest still bled freely, he knew that it would \nonly be a short time now until they would be on the move again and heading \nin the same direction as the two giant Maximal dragons that had disappeared \nin the distance.\nDinobot took in a deep breath of the crisp night air into his metallic lungs \nbefore turning his head in Tavatrons direction, simply finding her in the \nsame position as before by the stream which split this glade in two.\nBy the look of her posture and the slow but steady rise of her back it \nwasn�t hard too see that she was asleep, and he would let her continue to be \nso until the time came when they would be moving on.\nThe Transmetal II warrior lifted his optics from the sleeping fembot and let \nthem wander over the calm and serene atmosphere of the gentle glade, \nignoring the pain of his wounded chest in order to try and forget it all \ntogether.\nThough, throughout it all, his mind wanderer just as freely as his optics \ndid.\nShe sight of Tavatron sleeping so peacefully reminded him of his own \nfatigue, thinking to himself just what it was like to be able to sleep \nwithout having to worry about scenes of terror and carnage every time on \nclosed their optics. It was either those or darkness, never anything more. \nBut he also guessed that it was just one of the side effects to living the \nlife of war, such as he did.\nIt was also probably a sign that he had been at this warrior business a bit \ntoo long, but he hadn�t given it up then and he wasn�t about to now. Simply \nknowing that he would never be happy doing anything else. Besides, he didn�t \nknow anything more then the stench of the battlefield, the screams of the \nwounded and dying, the clash of steel and the war cries and the feeling of \ntriumph when the battle was won and a bot could go home to their families.\nDinobot stretched the stiffness out of his joints before walking over the \nlarge stump he had stood on when he had first entered this place, simply \nsetting himself onto it and leaning his back against a small sapling which \nwas growing right beside it. Sitting sideways so that he could keep an optic \non the glade as well as the woods.\nAh yes, families. Ones to come home to after a heard day on the field.\nThough, he had never been part of one worth coming home to.\nHis father had died in battle when he was very young and his mother never \nwanted him in the first place, later having another offspring that she \nthought all the world of.\nAnd with all her time spent dwelling on that new brat he was completely \nshoved off to the side, forgotten and left out in the cold.\nAnd bots wondered why he had such a bad attitude?!\nSome family he had.\nHis own mother even hid the fact that he was that slaging things older \nbrother for the longest time, finally leaving it up to HIM to tell the \nlittle slag.\nAnd all his life he had tried to prove to her that he was something, \nsomething that she could be proud of and would be welcome.\nBut he tried and he tried and still she ignored him and he gave up, so�he \nleft. Joining the Predacon forces as his father before him had and made a \nwarrior out of himself.\nDinobot almost chuckled.\nSlag! Was his mother ever surprised when this seasoned warrior suddenly \nappeared on her doorstep and claimed to be the scrawny son that she had \nneglected all those years.\nShe had been beside herself in surprise but had accepted the fair share of \nearnings he had made as a hired sword when he gave it to her, knowing that \nby then she was nearly bankrupt and without a home. She was his mother, \nafter all, though, honor also had a large part in that as well.\nBut after that he had left with nothing more then a farewell, simply going \nback to what he loved the most and was more a mother to him then his own \never was�BATTLE! And he hadn�t been back since.\nBut since those times things had changed, more then he cared to admit.\nBut that little tale was just one of his darkest secrets, one that he never \ntold to anybot for any reason. Knowing that they would either laugh at him \nor pity him greatly.\nThough, maybe in some far off time he would tell somebot, one that he \ntrusted without end and felt completely confident in telling.\nBut it was also a memory that he didn�t even bother care about anymore, the \npain of past years dulled until they simply weren�t there anymore.\nBut there, sitting atop that stump was a transformer that was completely \nhoned by battle and having to deal with his earlier years. His attitude not \neven having to do with the past any longer, just kept so long that it \nfinally became�him.\nDinobot took in another breath of crisp night air; but all those problems \nwere in the past and he knew that it was far better to live in the present \nand leave the past where it belonged�behind him.\nA thrush skittering from it�s cover near by causing his head to snap in it�s \ndirection, all that he had thought of safely tucked away in the back of his \nmind and forgotten.\nThe sudden urge to go and hunt at the sight of game, ( no matter HOW small \n), caused his stomach to rumble and nearly sent him off into the forest to \ntrack and bring down something to ease the growing pain in his belly.\nBut then, almost as if a natural reaction by now, he turned his head towards \nthe sleeping Tavatron, knowing that he would have to go far in order to kill \nlarge enough prey to sate HIS hunger and how long it would take. And it \nwould be too long to leave a sleeping bot alone like that, let alone leaving \nher unprotected in the first place.\nWith a sigh he then settled further against the sapling and made himself \ncomfortable, ignoring the growing hunger pains in his stomach.\nHe�d eat later, AFTER he got her back to base.\nSo, for now he let her sleep and dream away whatever nice dreams he would \nnever be able to have, and guarded her while she dreamt them. *\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
