He senses an interruption in sonar signal and quickly reali=\r\nzes that someone is able to fight it.  He switches it off.\n\n&quot;Right, Kup, Ro=\r\ndimus, you take Nightlight out of here ASAP. Meet up with Quickstride and R=\r\nat Trap and go as fast as you can back to the Ark.  Nightshift, since you&#39;r=\r\ne small enough and fast on your feet, due to Ninjabot training, I need you =\r\nto seize Darkhawk, and put him in temporary stasis until we can reverse his=\r\n shell program back to Windlord.  Try not to damage him, just subdue him.  =\r\nOnce you do that, rejoin everyone back at the Ark.&quot;\n\nNightshift salutes his=\r\n leader.\n\n&quot;Got it, but what about you?  What&#39;s your game plan?&quot;\n\nTucson loo=\r\nks forward.\n\n&quot;Someone has to back you up and divert enemy fire away from hi=\r\ns comrades.  It might as well be me.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;\n\nNightshi=\r\nft&#39;s optics widen.\n\n&quot;But, slag, that&#39;s one hell of a risk...  Look at what =\r\nyou&#39;re gon&#39; up against...  I dunno, I think ya better have Rodimus back ya =\r\nup.  He&#39;s an A class gunner and you&#39;re gonna need all the gunn&#39;n you can ge=\r\nt.&quot;\n\nTucson looks to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Rodimus, Change of plan.  Nightshift&#39;s righ=\r\nt.  I shouldn&#39;t try to do this alone.  And I know you wish to redeem yourse=\r\nlf faithfully.  Well, this is where we begin.  I trust you&#39;ll be able to ha=\r\nndle this with ease.&quot;\n\nHe alligns his missile launchers in anticipation of =\r\na shoot out.\n\n&quot; So, Hydras wants a fight, he&#39;s just got himself one.&quot;\n\n\n---=\r\n In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight/kup/Darkh=\r\nawk/perceptor/Hydras.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hdyras and perceptor started to recover; in othe=\r\nr room Darkhawk felt an \n&gt; unverable pain.

He could see the jerks of pain from\n&gt; &gt; Scorpono=\r\nk and Darkhawk as they fell down in pain, while the Autobots\n&gt; &gt; and Maxima=\r\nls seemed to be struggling to hold back the laughter, and\n&gt; &gt; then he felt =\r\nit too. it was a wave of warmth that seemed to vibrate at\n&gt; &gt; his relays, c=\r\nausing him to jerk slightly as he smiled and held himself\n&gt; &gt; silent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; However something was different with Scourge. He felt the wave pass\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nover him, and like a wave of pain he staggered back a step, but it was\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nnot enough to bring him to his knees.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scorponok glanced at Scourge =\r\nwith pain filled optics, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you in \n&gt; &gt; pain?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scourge gla=\r\nnced at him and then back at the Autobots, &quot;Because I am\n&gt; &gt; not built as a=\r\n Decepticon but Unicronian, we are superior.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scourge tapped his ra=\r\ndio as he held up his weapon defensively,\n&gt; &gt; realizing that at the moment =\r\nit was only he against the Autobots as\n&gt; &gt; his &#39;back up&#39; was on the ground.=\r\n &quot;Sir!&quot; Scourge sent to Hydras and\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus, &quot;Tuscon is doing that wave=\r\n thing again.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ****************************************************=\r\n**\n&gt; &gt; Who: CYCLONUS, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA, NIGHTRAZOR, Hydras, Perceptor\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Location: Black Fortress - Hallways\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not far away, Cyclonus got the=\r\n call and looked down as Hydras and\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor were also down in pain, &quot;=\r\nWe are having the same effect\n&gt; &gt; here.&quot; Cyclonus said, as he like the othe=\r\nr Unicronian based\n&gt; &gt; transformers could feel the wave, but its affects we=\r\nre far less\n&gt; &gt; pronounced and a lot easier to ignore.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Phobia looke=\r\nd at Hydras as she spoke to the others, &quot;I thought Hydras\n&gt; &gt; was Galvatron=\r\n also? His Unicronian design should protect him like us?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; she looked co=\r\nnfused and almost genuinely concerned.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus nodded, &quot;He is, but=\r\n I believe that in taking on the Megatron\n&gt; &gt; Spark and his more . . . um .=\r\n . . terrestrial form, that he has become\n&gt; &gt; more Decepticon than we.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus gestured at Nightrazor, &quot;Use your noise cancellation field to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; negate this until we can figure out a better solution.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightr=\r\nazor nodded as he began to cancel out the effects of the sonar.\n&gt; &gt; As sona=\r\nr is basically an operation of sound, Nightrazor begins\n&gt; &gt; generating a ty=\r\npe of white noise to directly cancel out its affects.\n&gt; &gt; This is typically=\r\n used to keep his movements quiet or to catch a foe\n&gt; &gt; at unawares, howeve=\r\nr this application of it was easily within his\n&gt; &gt; capabilities.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cy=\r\nclonus nodded as he gestured to the others, &quot;Nightrazor, stay with\n&gt; &gt; Perc=\r\neptor and Hydras, it may take them a few moments to recover, and\n&gt; &gt; they m=\r\nay need your field until this ends.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightrazor nodded as he stood =\r\nclose to Hydras and Perceptor, tying to\n&gt; &gt; keep the field up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cycl=\r\nonus straightened, &quot;Computer!&quot; he said as he looked around.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Workin=\r\ng.&quot; said the cool computer voice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Open fire on all Maximal and Aut=\r\nobot energy signatures.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Acknowledged.&quot; the computer voice came ba=\r\nck, as internal gun units\n&gt; &gt; once again oriented on the Maximal and Autobo=\r\nt group and opened up\n&gt; &gt; again on Tuscon and his group!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Come!&quot; Cy=\r\nclonus said to Phobia and Deepstryke, &quot;It is time to end\n&gt; &gt; this.
