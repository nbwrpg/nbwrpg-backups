He=\r\n gets wind\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; that you didn&#39;t let em do that mission on his own, he&#39;s g=\r\nonna see that as an\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; act of distrust.  Then he&#39;s really gonna be in a=\r\n bad mood.  Trust me, I\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; know.  Ratchet was the same way.  Like dad l=\r\nike son.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I know.&quot; LEO PRIME said over the rad=\r\nio &quot;But sometimes things are far\n&gt; \n&gt; more important than his anger.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; When NIGHTSHIFT arrived at POLAR CLAW&#39;s location he was already\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nstanding with RAMULUS and the group&#39;s tactical expert PROWL, they were\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n all in robot mode standing at the shuttle.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; WOLFGANG was standin=\r\ng off to the side manipulating something. &quot;Its\n&gt; \n&gt; fueled up and ready to =\r\ngo.&quot; WLFGANG said as he stowed an energon\n&gt; \n&gt; dispensing unit in its holst=\r\ner.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good!&quot; POLAR CLAW said. he was easily the largest of the gr=\r\noup. While\n&gt; \n&gt; not as tall as RODIMUS or TUSCON were, he was still broad a=\r\nnd massive,\n&gt; \n&gt; giving he appearance of great size and ferocity.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; POLAR CLAW turned to look at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;You&#39;re here because you know\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Tuscon better than we.&quot; There was a dismissive grunt as he glanced at\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; a PADD he had in his hand, it is ohviously the notes and mission\n&gt; \n&gt; pa=\r\nrameters he recieved from LEO PRIME.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;He&#39;s gone out alone. Senso=\r\nrs showed that he was going off in the\n&gt; \n&gt; direction of that jungle where =\r\nRodimus is suppose to be.&quot; There was\n&gt; \n&gt; another pause from POLAR CLAW, &quot;T=\r\nhe same direction Wheelie took as\n&gt; \n&gt; well.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; POLAR CLAW lowered=\r\n his padd as he looked at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;Every scan we\n&gt; \n&gt; have of that plac=\r\ne shows it is a dense jungle, his inhanced senses\n&gt; \n&gt; will not help him mu=\r\nch there.
