Stampy, scan the\n&gt;&gt; room for invi=\r\nsible trip wires, and move in accordingly to where they are\n&gt;&gt; located.  If=\r\n you can get around them without setting them off, we have an\n&gt;&gt; excellent =\r\nchance at getting out of here undetected.  Night Viper, its\n&gt;&gt; diversion ti=\r\nme.  Perhaps we can cause a glitch or two in the ships\n&gt;&gt; programming to ge=\r\nt focus on that rather than us.  That will give us more\n&gt;&gt; time to work.  B=\r\nig Convoy, I want you to go ahead with the rescue effort,\n&gt;&gt; I\n&gt;&gt; will foll=\r\now from behind. Now, let&#39;s go.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At TUSCON=92s command there i=\r\ns dead silence in the hall. The only sounds\n&gt; that could be heard was the s=\r\nound of the door sliding open to admit\n&gt; SABERBACK and SKYBYTE and then tho=\r\nse same doors sliding closed again.\n&gt;\n&gt; Neither STAMPY nor NIGHT VIPER move=\r\n a micron except to turn and look\n&gt; at BIG CONVOY.\n&gt;\n&gt; LONG RACK turned to =\r\nlook at TUSCON as he straightened, =93You do realize\n&gt; that as a . . . =93\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; BIG CONVOY cut off LONGRACK with a simple upraised hand. =93It=92s a go=\r\nod\n&gt; plan.=94 He said as he turned to look at LONG RACK and then TUSCON,\n&gt; =\r\n=93With some revision.=94\n&gt;\n&gt; First glancing down the hall to make sure tha=\r\nt they were alone now BIG\n&gt; CONVOY turned back to the group, =93Long Rack, =\r\nyou have some engineering\n&gt; skills, take Sharp Edge and get into the comput=\r\ner system, see what you\n&gt; can make happen.=94\n&gt;\n&gt; LONG RACK straightened, =\r\n=93Yes sir.=94 He said saluting. SHARP EDGE did\n&gt; not look quite so happy b=\r\nut never the less nodded.\n&gt;\n&gt; =93Night Viper, you and Stampy, see what you =\r\nan do to get into\n&gt; Saberback=92s room.=94 BIG CONVOY gestured at TUSCON, =\r\n=93He=92s right, the\n&gt; room is most likely trapped and maybe even bugged.=\r\n=94\n&gt;\n&gt; Turning to MACH KICK and SHARP EDGE, =93You are with us.=94 BIG CON=\r\nVOY\n&gt; said, =93We can still see if we can rescue Rhinox.=94\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally BIG=\r\n CONVOY turned to TUSCON, =93My mission and My team.=94 He said\n&gt; with a to=\r\nne of finality. =93Follow if you like.=94\n&gt;\n&gt; And like a rubber band that h=\r\nas been pulled taunt and let go, the\n&gt; entire team leaped into motion.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nMACH KICK lightly elbowed TUSCON, =93You may be a Prime, but he is a\n&gt; Conv=\r\noy.=94 And then he too moved into action.\n&gt;\n&gt; And MACH KICK was right, it w=\r\nas the same thing that LONG RACK was\n&gt; going to remind him of. CONVOY=92s w=\r\nere a rare breed, and it is quite\n&gt; possible that in his limited experience=\r\n TUSCON had never really had a\n&gt; chance to work with one. They were soldier=\r\ns who were at one point a\n&gt; PRIME, but were elevated to work with the MAGNU=\r\nS or sent or\n&gt; specialized missions =96 like this one, to bring back war cr=\r\niminals to\n&gt; justice.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n"}}
