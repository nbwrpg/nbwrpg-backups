She used all her will power to not\nmove as he pleaded to her. Not being able to stand it any more, she\nreached up and wrapped her arms tightly around his neck. Then, not\nneeding to open her optics, she leaned her head up and pressed her\nlips against his. Her mech fluid tempurature rose instantly as her\nlips met his. In her spark, she wanted to have this one moment last\nforever.  Being held in his arms and kissing him.  In the history of\nthe kiss, only 5 were rated for being the most passionate and the most\npure.  She wanted this kiss to blow all them away. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt;  \n&gt; He was a bit out of breath before, but now was bordering on torture.\n His sensors told him she had stopped, and he slowed down to catch his\nbreath a bit.  But when he found her, his spark nearly extinguished\nitself.  he rushed over to her, and gently picked her up.  He held her\nlimp body to his, worry deeply etched on his faceplates, hurt very\nevident.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Wolfblade!  Wolfblade, speak to me!  Come on, wake up!&quot; he said to\nher, hoping his pleas would work.\n&gt;  \n&gt; He&#39;d personally kill whoever did this to her.  He might not act like\nit all the time, but he was a killer.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
