Man, someone got up on the wrong side of the recover berth this mor=\r\nn&#39;n..&quot;\n\nHe heads into the base, to report to Lord Perseus.  He finds his wa=\r\ny toward Rat Trap and Quickstride as they re aquaint themselves with Depthc=\r\nharge.  Before he enters, he had completely forgotten to switch his faction=\r\n symbol back to Autobot from Decepticon from his last mission.  Quickstride=\r\n gasps, turns around and aims his cannon at him.\n\n&quot;FREEZE!  WEAPONS DOWN NO=\r\nW!&quot;\n\nNight Shift jumps and puts his hands right up.\n\n&quot; Woahh, woah, it&#39;s co=\r\nol it&#39;s cool.. I&#39;m on your side..&quot;\n\nHe now realizes what&#39;s going on.\n\n&quot;Slag=\r\n, no wonder.. Forgot ta change this back.  Sorry about that.&quot;\n\nHe switches =\r\nhis insignia back to his valid faction symbol.\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot; Ohhhh, y=\r\nou&#39;re one of those...  So how&#39;dwe know you&#39;re on our side for real huh?&quot;\n\nQ=\r\nuick stride snorts.\n\n&quot; Yeah, how do we know?  For all we know you could be =\r\none heck of an actor.&quot;\n\nNight Shift knew his status would be a little suspi=\r\ncious.  He puts his weapons down as asked.\n\n&quot; I promise, no charades guys. =\r\n I&#39;m definitely an Autobot.&quot;\n\nRat Trap scowls.\n\n&quot;Prove it.  What&#39;s the one =\r\nphrase that brought the Matrix of Leadership ta life when Rodimus Prime was=\r\n handed it?&quot;\n\nNight Shift smiles.\n\n&quot;I know that.  Light our darkest hour.&quot;\n=\r\n\nRat Trap sighs.\n\n&quot;Whew, yup, he&#39;s legit. Ya sure had me gon&#39; there for a m=\r\noment.&quot;\n\nNight Shift salutes Depthcharge.\n\n&quot;Sorry for the alarm sir.  I gue=\r\nss I forgot ta switch my badge back after my last mission...  Which reminds=\r\n me..  Sounds like you guys could use a good pair of wheels.  I&#39;m available=\r\n twenty four seven if ya need me.&quot;\n\nRat Trap thinks for a moment.\n\n&quot;You sur=\r\ne look like Tucson...&quot;\n\nNight Shift kneels down to Rat Trap.\n\n&quot; That happen=\r\ns ta be my best buddy.  How is he?  Is he still online?&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n=\r\n&quot;Yeah, he is, but when I last left &#39;em he was in pretty rough shape. He&#39;s b=\r\nack at the Ark.&quot;\n\nNight Shift now feels a string of guilt come over him.\n\n&quot;=\r\nSlag.  I knew I shouldn&#39;tve left &#39;em.&quot;\n\nRat Trap catches onto him and puts =\r\na hand on Night Shift&#39;s arm.\n\n&quot; No Decepticon would ever show an ounce of g=\r\nuilt for a comrade.  You&#39;n wheels are kinda alike. Oh, yeah, that&#39;s the nic=\r\nkname I gave &#39;em.  He&#39;s back at the Ark, helpn&#39; Lord Elder ta recover Rodim=\r\nus Prime&#39;n a few other key comrades of his.&quot;\n\nNight Shift&#39;s optics widen.\n\n=\r\n&quot;Woah, what happened ta Rodimus and the gang?&quot;\n\nQuickstride chimes in.\n\n&quot; A=\r\npparently Rodimus, Nightlight and another Autobot got abducted by Lord Hydr=\r\na&#39;s merry men. When Tucson tried ta go rescue them he failed, got in pretty=\r\n rough shape too.  Rodimus got corrupted by a shell program that Perceptor =\r\nput over &#39;em.. Yeah, real messy situation gon&#39; on there...&quot;\n\nNight Shift&#39;s =\r\noptics narrow.\n\n&quot;I knew I could feel somethn&#39; fishy gon&#39; on...  Well, I was=\r\n gonna go ta Lord Perseus but I got a feeln&#39; that my buddy&#39;s gonna need me =\r\nat the Ark.  Depthcharge, honor ta see ya again, but, I gotta split.  It&#39;s =\r\ngonna take me a while ta get back ta the Ark&#39;n my buddy down there needs me=\r\n.  Salute Lord Perseus for me. You guys, you stay here&#39;n help out Lord Pers=\r\neus.  And I promise little guy, Wheels is gonna be okay.&quot;\n\nRat Trap smiles.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Thanks Tall Dark&#39;n deceptive.  No pun intended.&quot;\n\nNight Shift gives a sl=\r\night chuckle.\n\n&quot;No offense taken.  I&#39;ll see you guys around.&quot;\n\nHe salutes a=\r\nnd transforms into SUV mode, making a B line for the out doors and toward t=\r\nhe Ark.  To avoid scandal amongst the Decepticons, he&#39;s careful to switch h=\r\nis faction symbol and his signature to that of a Decepticon car, to make it=\r\n appear that he&#39;s one of them.\n\n&quot;This should throw those bozos off for a wh=\r\nile..&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yo, Legacy, Night Shift here, and he&#39;s in the house. Lemme=\r\n know what ya want me ta do and I&#39;m as good as there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a sligh=\r\nt pause and then Legacy&#39;s icy cold tones could be heard\n&gt; across the encryp=\r\nted Maximal channel, &quot;Lord Perseus is currently the\n&gt; senior officer in cha=\r\nrge of this mission, and I will defer to his\n&gt; direction.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; After anoth=\r\ner pause Legacy continued, &quot;I believe that lights are soon\n&gt; to be activate=\r\nd. Perhaps he will require your assistance there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Kra=\r\nftlos is running the show over on this side.
