Nice little reminders you p=\r\nut in. ;)\n\nOOC: No problem. Glad they helped :)\n\n&gt; &lt;BACK IN CHARACTER&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nAt this point, WHEELIE would realize that he had lost contact over with the=\r\n\n&gt; ARK and hte other AUtobot forces, in his haste to extricate himself from=\r\n it\n&gt; and go in search of his friend.  Now he would be disrupting their own=\r\n search\n&gt; by making them also look for him as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wheelie shook his h=\r\nead as he realized his own haste in things would now\n&gt; compound the issue i=\r\nn searching.  But he would deal with that later.\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, Wheelie=\r\n was confused by what he was detecting, and he had to\n&gt; take a few moments =\r\nto try and recalibrate his scanners.  It was foreign to\n&gt; him, and he was n=\r\not very well versed over in communications.  As the\n&gt; memories of Rodimus c=\r\nurrent status, he shook his head.  He had been wrong\n&gt; and misanticipated h=\r\nwat he was looking for.\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE had not heard much (if at all) on teh c=\r\nrashed ship and prisoners,\n&gt; having only been peripherally paying attention=\r\n during the earlier briefing\n&gt; when it had been on before his fight had bee=\r\nn instigated, so he was mostly\n&gt; unaware of any signs that could be of them=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; For the moment, what he could tell was that the signal was made by an=\r\n\n&gt; Autobot, but it could be anything, and anyone with reasonable skill coul=\r\n ddo\n&gt; such a thing, at least to his minimal skill level with sensors.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nAs he also recalibrated his sensors, and he realized next that RODIMUS did\n=\r\n&gt; not have this level of skill, his frown deepened.  WHo woudl ahve the\n&gt; c=\r\napacity to send out a flickering signal along AUTOBOT lines, if not the\n&gt; P=\r\nredacons?  But why would they bother with such a thing?\n&gt;\n&gt; And yet, having=\r\n little else he could go on now he went over in that\n&gt; direction.  Assuming=\r\n the ground was in good enough shape to allow him to\n&gt; transform and make b=\r\netter speed, he ould do so.  If not, he would walk.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWHEELIE was def=\r\ninitely right in the aspect that anyone with reasonable\ncommunication skill=\r\ns and had the gear to do it with could simulate a\ndistress call from any of=\r\n the opposing factions. It has been used as a\nlure for many centuries with =\r\nvarying degrees of success.\n\nBut, be that as it may, WHEELIE continued down=\r\n the path. The\ninteresting thing was as he moved he could note that had bee=\r\nn\nflattened down as if some large vehicle had recently driven down it,\nperh=\r\naps within the past day or so. It allowed him to shift to\nvehicular mode an=\r\nd to make greater speed.\n\nAs he drove the path began to open up as tree dis=\r\ntance allowed for the\npath to enlarge somewhat, his sensors now able to pic=\r\nk up what might\nappear to be a structure of some type. It was from here tha=\r\nt the\nsignal was being broadcast.\n\nAs he drove figures would seem to be on =\r\nthe path with him on or behind\nthe trees he passed. It was like shadows or =\r\nplays of light =96 you see\nit out of the corner of the optic, but when one =\r\nfocused on it, it was\ngone.\n\nIn the distance a roar echoed over the forest,=\r\n and then several\nsmaller ones. From the sound of it, it was coming from fa=\r\nr behind\nWHEELIE, somewhere in the distance several miles away or more. How=\r\never\nahead of him a small pyramid of some sort was becoming visible, and\nth=\r\ne path he was on seemed to be heading straight for it.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
