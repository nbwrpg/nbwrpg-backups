But when they greeted her and bowed she then straightened \nherself up a bit and then straightened her fur�which had been ruffled due to \nthe sudden shock of them being there. She had almost thought that they were \nAlliance bots, glad as heck that they worn�t.\nBut then she realized that she was just outside the Alliance base, being in \nthe wrong place at the wrong time if they detected her!\nShe was just about to excuse herself and leave when Reptilica and \nBloodystrike suddenly appeared, BrightBlade nearly jumping in surprise and \ntransforming�ready to battle.\nWith a growl she glared at Bloodystrike as he aimed his gun at them all, \ntransforming and simply standing there. She leaned her back against a tree \nand simply stayed there, bowing her head, crossing her arms and closing her \noptics. Simply there and acting as if she wasn�t phased by their presence at \nall.\nShe then heard Deemos speak, then finding out the couple were married. She \nsmirked. But she then looked over at the couple.*\n\n� Those two aren�t Predacons, they�re the ENEMIES of the Predacons. Alliance \nslags.*\n\n� She pointed to Reptilica,*\n\n� That one�s Scale Face,�\n\n*Then pointed at Bloodystrike,*\n\n� And that one�s BloodyNose.�\n\n* She then sighed and looked ahead of herself, a smile on her face.*\n\n� I�M the Predacon.�\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
