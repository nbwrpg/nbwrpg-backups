A\nnew change has happened on Cybertron. The Tripredacus rebuilt Optimus\nPrime in an evil form. He has already taken over Cybertron, and he is\ncomeing here...\n\n&quot;If he&#39;s coming by ship maybe we can build some kind of ground to\nspace weapon relay, probably some kind of energy ray, or laser beam.\nWe could use it to detonate his ship before it reaches the planet and\nhope he is either stranded in space or burnt up entering the\natmosphere.&quot; Kenzo stated. \n\n\n"}}
