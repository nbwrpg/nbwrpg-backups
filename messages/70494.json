The other Fuzors were\noff on other missions or else they would also be here to witness this\nevent.\n\n&quot;Hrrmph.&quot; Noctorro said, not one for all those words and wishes. he\nwas a machine of action and combat. But he also turned to look at the\noperation through the glass, his optics focused on Rodimus and Tuscon,\n&quot;Rodimus is made of the stuff of leaders and warriors. He will pull\nthrough.&quot;\n\nAirhammer though did pay heed to the words, &quot;Hope is sometimes all we\nhave.&quot; He glanced at Noctorro, &quot;Even for us.&quot;\n\nNoctorro nodded.\n\n*     *     *     *     *\n\nIn the medical bay itself Bump and Santon hooked the lines to Tuscon,\nensuring that they were secure. With a beep Tuscon&#39;s life signs began\ndisplaying themselves on the monitors next to Rodimus&#39; So far they\nshowed that Tuscon was in good condition at nearly full power.\n\nLegacy came to stand between Rodimus and Tuscon as Bump and Santon\nturned back to Rodimus with cutting tools in hand.\n\nWith a nod to Legacy Santon gave the order, and legacy pulled a\nswitch, and  almost immediately Tuscon&#39;s world began to swirl as\ncolors and sounds hit against him . . .\n\n"}}
