I come\nfrom a place called the Abyss, where souls are kept.  I was sent by the\nAbyss to destroy you beings called transformers, since you didn&#39;t have souls\nthat we could keep.  But, I saw one transformer suffering in a prison, and I\nfelt pity for him, so I couldn&#39;t help it.....I betrayed the Abyss.
