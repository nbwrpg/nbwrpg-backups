Transforming to his black \ntank mode, he fired off two fire balls at Rizopas.\n\n---\n\nHiss fired off three fusion blasts at Stronghold&#39;s chest.\n\n---\n\nScavenger fired three optic blasts at one charge, but the other one landed \nnear him, sending him flying through the air, slamming into the ground.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf ignored damage from the autoguns.  He pointed his sword at the \nbase, the blade blasting off, now a missile, heading for the base, the blade \nquickly replaced.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw fired the two last missiles in his vehicle mode at the Mafia base.  \nHe transformed to robot mode.\n\n----\n\nSerpentor fired off three plasma bolts at Stronghold.\n\n---\n\nUnitron transformed to jet mode.  Still on the ground, and facing the Mafia \nbase, he was able to target the base.  He launched two missiles off at the \nbase, taking off into the air.\n\n"}}
