Neutral Terrain remains such. \nIf you were mentionning my earlier venture near your base, then I \nwould have to say that I am a Maximal, and that I consider helping my \nbrethrens as my duty. And bravery, my esteemed Kali, is not difficult \nto find. Would you dare to stand up to your leaders because of what \nyou think?\n\nHe looked at her intensely. She read open defiance, and he knew it. He \njust wished she could let them go. Besides, Prowl had told him about \nthe non-agression pact. That could be the key.\n\nAzureBlade: As for my friend Mistra, I believe she has already chosen. \nI will also refresh your memory, if you allow. Maximals and Predacons \nhave agreed to non agression, right? If you do not let us go safely, \nthis could mean war. Think, and you shall see you clearly do not want \na war. Now step aside.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Airshadow Nightlight &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  Kali::\n&gt; Kali laughted as if she had heard a joke &quot;Cowards won&#39;t survive in \nPredacon&#39;s world&quot;said Kali&quot;and neither in BlackFortress...

Being by herself \nwouldn&#39;t have done her a bit of good in this situation...she didn&#39;t \ntrust this supposed Predicon as far as she could throw her. Although \nthe bot had been awfully quiet...maybe she was planning to give up..? \n&gt; \n&gt; Still, it was best to keep her guard up.
