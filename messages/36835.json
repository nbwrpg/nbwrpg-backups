His translucent body shimmers as he decides to speed\n&gt; up the process. He projects his thoughts to Pacifix, implanting a\n&gt; thought into his head. &lt;&lt; There is an enemy outside your ship, and\n&gt; he is threatening to kill Commander Ironhide! I should save the\n&gt; Commander. &gt;&gt; Azafroth shimmers even more brightly as he\n&gt; observes his work in progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pacifix suddenly turns and spots a bot close to Ironhide. A though\n&gt; races through his head, &lt;&lt;There is an enemy outside your ship,\n&gt; and he is threatening to kill Commander Ironhide! I should save the\n&gt; Commander.&gt;&gt; He runs towards the bot, and to the side, making\n&gt; sure that there is nobody in his line of fire. His twin autocannons\n&gt; begin firing in bursts of eight, and his arm freeze cannons launch\n&gt; eight freeze blasts in total all directed at the bot near Ironhide, Arty.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
