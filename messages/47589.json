An insult to everything \nBW/BM stands for?  Laughable, for it&#39;s the other way around.  Transformer&#39;s \ncame out as Roland, Code, or whatever new name has pointed out, 12 years \nbefore BW squirmed its way onto the scene.  Hell, BW was to cheap to get \nFrank Welker to do the original Megatron&#39;s voice for the thing on the golden \ndisk.  It&#39;s only good points were Larry DiTillo and Bob Forward, both having \nworked on He-Man which was a kick ass cartoon (Secret of the Sword baby, \nyeah!).\n\nStaying on subject, Transformers: The Movie was an awesome movie.  I won&#39;t \nsay it was perfect, it was pretty cheesy how they slipped in the gay new \nAutobots.  But that&#39;s what happens when it&#39;s governed by toy sales.  Anyway, \nthe tactic with the ship was smart and served its purpose.\n\nThey were trying to get the Dinobots in there because they wanted to get the \nhell out of there, something about a new, fully-powered fleet of Decepticon \nfighters jumping on their tired afts.  And the Dinobots are stupid, what do \nyou expect?  Grimlock was a genius at one point in the third season, but \nthat&#39;s another subject for another time.\n\nWhy were they celebrating at the end?  How many stupid questions do you have? \n They saved the planet from a giant MONSTER named Unicron that was going to \nobliterate the planet and everything else in the Universe.  That would be \nworth being happy about, though it was stupid to say it was the end of the \nThird Cybertronian War, I&#39;ll give ya that.  But they&#39;re Autobots, whaddaya \nexpect?  And in G1 the Matrix wasn&#39;t a gay Heaven like in BM, it was just a \ndevice that held the essences of all the past Autobot leaders, although the \nMatrix of Leadership itself was stupid.  \n\nWhy would you want Spike?  That&#39;s almost as bad as wanting that fairy Daniel \nor the iinfamous Wheelie?   See people, Dewboy is a PRIME example of what \nhappens when people polluted with Bob Skir&#39;s sheisse watch G1.  They \namazingly forget that G1 came out about 20 years before BW and BM.  Idiocy.)\n\n-L. Unitron\n\n"}}
