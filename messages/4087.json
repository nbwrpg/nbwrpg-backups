And he \nknew how he would get in. But he hopes they don&#39;t detect him. This \nsignal masker only has a few cycles left of energy. He finds the air \nvent, opens it up and starts crawling through, putting the vent back \nin place. Being a Predacon, he could normally just enter the base. \nBut Hell Beast would see his new body and would start asking \nquestions. Questions he didn&#39;t want to answer. Besides, he wouldn&#39;t \nbe a Predacon for much longer.\n\n&quot;Acording to my scanners, the machine is right here.&quot;\n\nVulois opens up the vent which leads into Scorponok&#39;s lab. On one of \nthe table&#39;s he sees a box with a big button on it.\n\n&quot;Yes. With this box I can whipe DarkMouse&#39;s program and re-program \nher to serve myself and Soundwave! I will make her a TM3 and she will \naide us in the ruling of Cybertron!&quot;\n\nJust then his internal computer talked to him.\n\n&quot;Signal Masker has gone offline.&quot;\n\nOh Crap! Now he&#39;s gotta get out of here. The Preds can see his \nsignature. He hopes he won&#39;t encounter any on the way out.\n\n\n"}}
