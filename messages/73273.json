She wanted to her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; daughter and check her safely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Tucson notices the positive changes in Rodimus and gives a smile of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; satisfaction. Yet his expression changes, one of grave concern.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Yes, we will need stronger defenses. I don&#39;t think our fight with\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Magmatron is over by any means. We won the battle this time by getting\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; everyone to safety but, there is yet the possibility of retaliation on=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enemies part. I guess you could call it guardian intuition. The =\r\nold\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dragon must have had the same attribute. Only now, have events es=\r\ncalated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and I sense that the reason for that, is because of the drago=\r\nn&#39;s passing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He somewhat kept the land free of harm, and not smaller =\r\ncreature dared to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; challenge him. But with age, he weakened, and even =\r\nMagmatron who&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; strength always outshone his own, realizes that witho=\r\nut the guardian, it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy pickings. Well, not anymore. Now instead o=\r\nf one guardian there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many, and as guardians we need to step up ou=\r\nr protection. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He looks ahead toward home.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; This =\r\nplanet needs a chance to evolve. And if Nemesis Prime thinks he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can d=\r\nestroy this world, I will not hesitate to show him that no one lays\n&gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\narm on innocent life forms without paying a price for their actions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI&#39;ve been entrusted by the old dragon, to pick up where he left off, being\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sure NOTHING LAYS HARM TO THE PLANET HE VOWS TO DEFEND. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Tucson had also changed, he had realized why the dragon had chosen him.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps it was to help guide Rodimus and the other Maximals but, his\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; primary purpose being the all around Guardian Prime of the environment =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the creatures that lived there. Rodimus was ready now, he grew al=\r\nl the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wiser and he felt that he could lead them to safety and beyond.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; And with that said, I know my purpose now. Rodimus, the Maxi=\r\nmals have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their leader and I am flying next to him. But this planet n=\r\needs a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guardian and I have been chosen to take that position. I will =\r\nalways help\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you when my help is needed, and I will help reinforce the=\r\n defenses. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when we return I must take my rightful place, the cave=\r\n that sits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; overlooking the Ark, that is where I must reside. That is =\r\nwhere he stood\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guard and that is where I must stand. And when you hea=\r\nr my voice crack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sky like thunder, you will be alerted to danger =\r\nbefore it strikes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even though far away, Tucson coul=\r\nd now see the peak of the cave where he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would stand guard and follow =\r\nthe footsteps of the Silver Dragon of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; We have=\r\n a ways to go but, there ahead, we are approaching home.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; RODIMUS nodded as they flew down towards the MAXIMALS that were\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwaiting below and started on the journey home.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The trip was remark=\r\nably brief. They made it back to the shuttle they\n&gt; &gt; had flown to the jung=\r\nle on, it would seem that the magma had not\n&gt; &gt; reached as far as the edge =\r\nof the jungle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As they moved into the air and surveyed the landsca=\r\npe there could be\n&gt; &gt; seen a large area of devastation where the Magma had =\r\ncome down off the\n&gt; &gt; top of the volcano and flowed down onto the gorunds b=\r\nelow. Trees and\n&gt; &gt; other assorted foliage had been burned to a cinder. One=\r\n could only\n&gt; &gt; hope that as time passed and the lava cooled and turned int=\r\no rock and\n&gt; &gt; dirt that the jungle would recover its lost area and once ag=\r\nain be the\n&gt; &gt; luxuriant green carpet that it was.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However as the =\r\nteam circled above it was easy to see that the area\n&gt; &gt; that was damaged wa=\r\ns small compared to the vastness of the jungle\n&gt; &gt; itself. There were still=\r\n thousands of acres of jungle still left\n&gt; &gt; untouched by the destruction.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But now they journied home, back towards the ARK and back to the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; relative saftey of the MAXIMAL headquarters.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It felt like only =\r\na short period of time before they could see the\n&gt; &gt; outline of the very mo=\r\nuntain that the ARK sat at the base of,\n&gt; &gt; strangely enough another volcan=\r\no, one that would one day errupt\n&gt; &gt; itself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A call came into TUCS=\r\nON, it was from LORD ELDER, &quot;Nightshift has been\n&gt; &gt; trying to reach you.&quot; =\r\nHe said, his voice were perfectly clear. &quot;I am\n&gt; &gt; sending you his last kno=\r\nwn coordinates.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Surprisingly enough the coordinates were only 50 =\r\nmiles from the ARK,\n&gt; &gt; just outside of the ARK&#39;s immediate sensor range.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
