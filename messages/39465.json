And as a reward for your loyalty, I would ask \n&gt;that\n&gt; &gt; you please assemble a unit of 12 outside the city limits. Ready to move \n&gt;out\n&gt; &gt; and assist the Chevron cause at my command.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * Thus...she placed her faith in the Maximal that stood at her side. As\n&gt; &gt; squad leader for this mission.\n&gt; &gt; It HAD occurred to her time and time again that, someday and soon, she \n&gt;had\n&gt; &gt; to single out and officially title a transformer to take up the role of\n&gt; &gt; 2nd-In-Command.\n&gt; &gt; But her attention was soon grasped by AzureBlade; a pleased look \n&gt;crossing\n&gt; &gt; her features when he bowed but then that expression was wiped clean off \n&gt;her\n&gt; &gt; face when he suddenly spoke his TRUE name.\n&gt; &gt; &lt; Protoform Z?!&gt;\n&gt; &gt; She remembered the reports on the Protoform X that was in the original \n&gt;Beast\n&gt; &gt; Wars...and she remembered the fight she had with it before she was named\n&gt; &gt; 3rd-in-command.\n&gt; &gt; Slag! That had been one tough bot.\n&gt; &gt; And here, bot bowing right in front of her was just ANOTHER of those\n&gt; &gt; creatures.\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor&#39;s expression became cold as she eyed AzureBlade, a \n&gt;thoughtful\n&gt; &gt; brow lifting. The dominant claw on her boot armor coming down and sparks\n&gt; &gt; flew as the tip collided with the armored floor.\n&gt; &gt; It was questionable...yes. But could she condemn another prototype that \n&gt;was\n&gt; &gt; no different then herself?\n&gt; &gt; Her expression softened a bit.*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; AzureBlade...though I know nothing of your sins I am sure that, as \n&gt;long as\n&gt; &gt; your actions remain true to the Maximal cause, orders are followed, and \n&gt;your\n&gt; &gt; loyalty remains pure for the remainder of your existence, all will be\n&gt; &gt; forgiven.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * A growl tricked from her throat as blue eyes narrowed.*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; But for a time being you will remain close to me. So that you not only\n&gt; &gt; show that you are worthy to the fellow Maximals but to me as well.\n&gt; &gt; Until you have proven so, your acceptance into this unit is reserved.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * Iron Raptor looked down at him.*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Do you understand?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \n&gt;http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
