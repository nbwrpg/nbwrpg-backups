Before you kill me, know this: I didn&#39;t do it on purpouse.\n\nSomething I was making backfired upon testing and destroyed all the\ncharacter profiles except for Alloran&#39;s (very strange occurance). It\nalso mutilated the character editor. Nothing really works right now,\nand I&#39;m fixing it, but I just wanted to tell you guys so that you\ncould get started with retyping your char profiles, because I don&#39;t\nhave backups (Alloran&#39;s are still there, so he doesn&#39;t have to type\nthem up). I&#39;m sorry about all this, But it gives me work too.\n\n\n"}}
