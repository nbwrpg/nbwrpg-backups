She had looked over at \nthe strange horse when it had transformed and studied it&#39;s structure, simply \nnormal and nothing more. BrightBlade was disappointed, she had though that \nif anything was to come out of that pod it was to be some sort of strong \nbot, not some horse that new nothing other then to flit it&#39;s hair about!\nShe looked at Gangon, his jaw dropped at the bot&#39;s beauty, why was it men \nalways fell for something that knew how to strut about? The question \nconfused her but at least this new bot could serve Hell Beast, just as she \nand Gangon had been.\nBrightBlade transformed into her robot mode and then walked around the new \nbot, judging it even closer. She then stopped in front of it and crossed her \narms, not much to her taste but she could tell without a doubt that Gangon \nliked it.\nShe snapper her head towards him with a sharp snarl.*\n\n&quot; Close that yap of your&#39;s, you arachnid bafoon!You&#39;re making a mockery of \nyourself!!&quot;\n\n* She then looked back at the new bot, her optics narrowing to mear slits.*\n\n&quot; Not much power in THIS thing but as long as it&#39;s loyal to My Lord Hell \nBeast it may be usefull.&quot;\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
