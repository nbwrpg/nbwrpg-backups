I think I&#39;m gonna regret it in about ten \nseconds though&gt;.&lt; This is my first time posting ship wide damage, so bear \nwith me. If something&#39;s amiss I&#39;d appreciate it if you would let me know so \nI can correct it in my next post^_^ Be warned, I&#39;m half awake and in need of \nmuch sleep:P)\n\nHysteria:\n\nHysteria remained crouched in the vent, doining her best to try and stop the \ninvading &#39;bots. The ship itself was a mess compared to its original state. \nIf only she could get the main weapon online! The CF&#39;s computer echoed \nagainst the walls of the small vent:\n\n&quot;Weapon&#39;s fire detected. Ten seconds until impact... 9... 8...&quot;\n\nHysteria&#39;s fingers flew across the keyboard as she desperately tried to find \nsomething to power the shields. Perhaps she could reroute some power from \nthe main engine room, the back up propulsion system... anything! There was \nsomething... the EMP cannon had a reserve power source. If certain \nconnections weren&#39;y severed then perhaps it would work:\n\n&quot;Computer, give me the technical diagram of the EMP cannon&#39;s connection to \nthe CF.&quot;\n\nAccording to the diagram one line was still intact, and the reserve power \nwas just enough... not for the cannon, but perhaps it could power something \nelse. She quickly tried to reroute the remaining power to the shields, and \nhit enter. Outside the CF the shields flickered to life. They were weak, and \nbarely at 50%, but they were holding. The weapons fire hit the shield, one \nafter the other sent ripples through it. The already weakened shields \nwouldn&#39;t last much longer against this type of assualt.\n\nHysteria turned to face the vent opening, and went sailing back as \nVehement&#39;s missile struck her upper torso. Her laptop was destroyed in the \nblast, but the interface cord was still intact. Hysteria lay there, her \narmor was charred and sparking. She wasn&#39;t in stasis yet, but she wasn&#39;t \ngetting up just yet.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
