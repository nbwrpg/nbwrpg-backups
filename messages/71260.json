Oh=\r\n, by the way, one more question.. Hydras knows Perceptor&#39;s one of us now, h=\r\now are we gonna fight &#39;em off if he tries another attack on the Ark?&quot;\n\nMean=\r\nwhile, in Legacy&#39;s chamber, Straight Shot now sees why he was so concerned =\r\nabout the time space continum.  She had not known what really happened, and=\r\n at the time it did happen she had not yet been a part of the Autobot Facti=\r\non.  She stands thoughtfully for a moment, now taking in what she had been =\r\nmissing for a long time.\n\n&quot; Wow, that part I never did understand..  That s=\r\nure explains things. I&#39;m glad I did talk to you, Legacy.  So by doing what =\r\nhe did, Starscream saved our faction...  I&#39;ve only heard bits&#39;n pieces abou=\r\nt Starscream&#39;s relationship with Megatron, and from what I learned, they ne=\r\nver did see eye to eye. Anyway, thanks for the explanation and the video fe=\r\ned, it was really useful. I better let ya get ta the bridge now.  Thanks ag=\r\nain.&quot;\n\nShe gets down from where she was standing and bids Legacy good bye f=\r\nor the time being.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyc=\r\nlonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nigthlight dificulty sat down hoping =\r\nto see her daughter coming and the\n&gt; &gt; only thing that she saw was a spotte=\r\nd hurricane coming to her and before she\n&gt; &gt; could do something she felt a =\r\nimpulse backwards and fell in the bed; a warm\n&gt; &gt; tiny tongue licking her a=\r\nnd a furry cheek in hers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;MOM!!! YOU ARE BACK!!! I MISSED YOU SOO =\r\nMUCH!!&quot;said a childish voice,\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight Huged tightly her daughter and=\r\n and tears of happines started to appear.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;My Elita... My sweet dau=\r\nghter...&quot;whispered Nighlight with a smile\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I was really Impattient =\r\nto see you mom; I really... Really missed you&quot; said\n&gt; &gt; ELita with a wide S=\r\nmile &quot;But my dad and Perceptor...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;WHAT????&quot; said shocked Nighlig=\r\nht while she watched Rodimus\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oppssi&quot; said Elita while she lowed he=\r\nr ears\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS had been smiling broadly as ELITA and NIGHTL=\r\nIGHT were being\n&gt; reunited. He had even leaned back a little to allow the t=\r\nwo to hug and\n&gt; show affection. That is until ELITA&#39;s last statement and he=\r\n could see\n&gt; the look on NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s face.\n&gt; \n&gt; Smiling warmly and nodding=\r\n RODIMUS took NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s hand. &quot;Yes,\n&gt; Perceptor has been instrumental in=\r\n your recovery.&quot; Leaning back in he\n&gt; continued to smile at her, hoping to =\r\nwipe away her fears if he could.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;From what we can tell, Perceptor has=\r\n joined the Maximals.&quot; RODIMUS\n&gt; rubbed ELITA&#39;s head giving her reassurance=\r\n and affection as well.\n&gt; &quot;Just like our daughter here has said.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ****=\r\n**************************************\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor walke=\r\nd close to  Lord Elder and shook his head  and said &quot;It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; highly unlike=\r\nly that that happens &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside, Uproar catches up =\r\nto Lord Elder, as he observes the private code\n&gt; &gt; on  Tuscons door.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot; Wow, so, I guess Tucson and Talon are kinda gonna be like Rodimus and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Nightlight.  I wonder if Tucson will ya know..  Have a family of his own=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; some day?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; ELDER looked away from the door, his optics=\r\n reddening slightly. If he\n&gt; were human it might even seem like a blush. &quot;W=\r\nho can say Uproar, who\n&gt; can say? I would imagine that that is something th=\r\nat we may all want\n&gt; to do at some point.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; TORCA and NOCTORRO walked w=\r\nith ELDER as well, their large forms\n&gt; swaying as they walked, the sound of=\r\n their footsteps large and heavy\n&gt; as their metal booted feet hit the deck =\r\nplating.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We still must talk.&quot; TORCA said looking at ELDER, his tone s=\r\nomber and\n&gt; resigned. NOCTORRO was tapping out a small message as they talk=\r\ned, but\n&gt; he looked up and nodded in agreement as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; ELDER nodded a=\r\ns he glanced at TORCA and then at the others. &quot;Uproar,\n&gt; why don&#39;t you show=\r\n Perceptor around the base and help him get settled\n&gt; in, I would imagine h=\r\ne will need to find some quarters and perhaps a\n&gt; recharging chamber coded =\r\nto his requirements.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ******************************************\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Moving to Legacy&#39;s quarters, Straight Shot thinks for a mom=\r\nent before\n&gt; &gt; saying anything, which was her best of traits.  Once she had=\r\n an idea of\n&gt; &gt; what she wanted to say, she looks up to Legacy, with an air=\r\n of sincerity she\n&gt; &gt; always had for everyone, including her brother.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot; Thanks, for letting me talk to you, I appreciate it.  I just wanted ta=\r\n let\n&gt; &gt; ya know that I think my brother doesn&#39;t quite understand where you=\r\n&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; coming from and maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s so critical of your actions. =\r\n He&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; always been like that, not just around you, but with me too, and =\r\nyeah,\n&gt; &gt; sometimes it gets on my nerves.  But with things as they are, and=\r\n what\n&gt; &gt; happened ta him in the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s put up su=\r\nch a defense\n&gt; &gt; and why he&#39;s so determined ta think off the pavement.  And=\r\n maybe that&#39;s why\n&gt; &gt; his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed wit=\r\nh mine too, at times.\n&gt; &gt; Honestly though, how do you feel about his thinki=\r\nng outside the box?  Is there\n&gt; &gt; a reason why you&#39;d rather not go that way=\r\n?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; For a moment LEGACY looked confused, his single crimson =\r\noptic boring\n&gt; into STRAIGHT SHOT as his mind ran over what she said.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;I do not understand all of the colloquialisms than you have\n&gt; utilized.&quot; H=\r\ne said at last, &quot;But I ascertain that you are attempting\n&gt; to explain your =\r\nsibling&#39;s actions to me and inquiring as to why I will\n&gt; not allow Tuscon t=\r\no disturb Optimus Prime&#39;s chassis.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEGACY&#39;s optic flickered for a mom=\r\nent. &quot;I appreciate your intent.&quot; He\n&gt; said his words clear and well articul=\r\nated. &quot;But I do not require an\n&gt; explanation, since I have taken no offense=\r\n to his actions; to do so\n&gt; would be an inefficient use of my time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nHowever to answer your question I will replay something for you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Turn=\r\ning to the screen that was standing behind LEGACY he fired a beam\n&gt; of ener=\r\ngy at it. But instead of it exploding into shards of glass and\n&gt; debris it =\r\nsimply changed to show a mountainous scene, a volcano, and\n&gt; then the volca=\r\nno exploding to reveal the Ark. It was obvious from the\n&gt; motion that the e=\r\nvents were being speeded up for ease of viewing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Soon after it happene=\r\nd a small satellite like device rose up from the\n&gt; Ark and began to travel =\r\naway from it and after a while return. After\n&gt; another short moment, short =\r\nbecause of the speeded up play back,\n&gt; MEGATRON flew out along with STARSCR=\r\nEAM, SOUNDWAVE and a few other\n&gt; Decepticon seekers, obviously having been =\r\nrepaired by the device. They\n&gt; all land on a cliff and look back at the Ark=\r\n, and STARSCREAM fires a\n&gt; blast at the Ark and they all fly off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Insi=\r\nde the Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMUS PRIME is\n&gt; also i=\r\ns knocked into the beam and his repair process begins.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: This is t=\r\nhe scene from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the bots and\n&gt; cons fell to earth =\r\nand 4 million years had passed.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The scene fades to black.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;These=\r\n sequence of cannot be disrupted.&quot; LEGACY intoned coldly.\n&gt; &quot;Without the Au=\r\ntobots none of you would be here.&quot; LEGACY turned back\n&gt; to face STRAIGHT SH=\r\nOT, &quot;And without the Decepticon&#39;s attack on the Ark\n&gt; the Autobots will not=\r\n survive.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEGACY folded his arms behind his back, &quot;There can be no di=\r\nsruption of\n&gt; the time flow.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a small beep on LEGACY&#39;s panel=\r\n causing him to look over at\n&gt; it. &quot;Interesting.&quot; He said curiously. &quot;It wo=\r\nuld seem that I am\n&gt; required on the bridge.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
