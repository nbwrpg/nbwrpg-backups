The\nmassive ship barely rolling in the slight swell.\n  \n  &quot;Hell Beast is here,&quot; Panzertron said to the figure\nsitting behind the desk.\n\n  &quot;He&#39;s attempted to contact us, as has a group\nidentifing themselves as the Alliance,&quot; Panzertron\nreported.\n\n  The figure nodded,&quot; Invite the Alliance leader and\nHell Beast to the ship. Each comes alone. We&#39;ll let\nthem explain themselves to us. If this Alliance is\nworth joining we will. We&#39;ll also give Hell Beast the\nchance to plea his case before we decide his fate.&quot;\n\n\n &quot;Yes sir,&quot; Panzertron said departing the private\nchambers.\n\n-OOC- If you respond about the Militrons and Iron\nFist, please use a title. Neo Beast wars five billion\ntimes over and over again isnt creative. \nthnx\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nKick off your party with Yahoo!
