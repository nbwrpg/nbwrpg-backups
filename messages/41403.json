He sends several commands to several different sectors of the shield, a mechanical sound becoming audible as panels slide aside in the outer walls to reveal autoguns that slide out and lock in place. The shields shimmer slightly as they recieve more energy, becoming a bit less see-through.\n\nAll of the outer doors, except for two on opposite sides of the city, slide shut and lock magnetically, built well enough so that it wasn&#39;t distunguishable where wall met door. A slightly louder sound of gears is heard as the solar panels slide a bit down into the center of the city, the dome-like structure that used to be the Element, the transmission jammer moving up a bit to be usable.\n\n&quot;City&#39;s all ready, Commander. I can fully lock it down at your orders,&quot; Cyndro informs Iron Raptor, scanning the area just in case.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl and Rixer both hear IR&#39;s orders, getting into Maximal City and look back at IR.\n\n-Want me to help you out, love? If you&#39;re gonna meet with that bot, I mean.- Prowl thinks to IR, hoping she&#39;d say yes.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron glanced back at AzureBlade for a moment.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; ...No clue.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
