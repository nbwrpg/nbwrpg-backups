Hell Drak&#39;s \neyes\n&gt; &gt; were closed tight, waiting for death.  But nothing happened.  She\n&gt; &gt; opened her eyes.  Triggerhappy was hit, and fell to his knees, \nmouth\n&gt; &gt; wide open, shocked, and in pain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You.....&quot; Triggerhappy stopped to gasped for air, &quot;Pile \nof.......&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Triggerhappy fell down on his face, so he was laying on the \nground.\n&gt; &gt;  Where his face was, a puddle of mechfluid appeared, and \nmechfluids\n&gt; &gt; started spilling from where he had been hit.

Watch out!&quot; Hell Drak yelled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A light came into her optics, and then she quickly got up and \ndove\n&gt; &gt; at AzureBlade, trying to take him down, but out of the way of\n&gt; &gt; damage...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Surgital suddenly felt something from Ice.

He was horrified, and was screaming for help.  \nThen,\n&gt; &gt; he went forward, and a bunch of saws and stuff came down!  They\n&gt; &gt; started cutting at Decapitron.  All he could do was scream in \nsheer\n&gt; &gt; pain.  Each saw blade had the Autobot symbol engraved on it.\n&gt; &gt; Decapitron, still tied onto the conveyer belt, was now heading \ninto a\n&gt; &gt; large box thing.  On the way, a heavy thing with an Autobot symbol\n&gt; &gt; came down and sort of crushed Decapitron&#39;s head.  Then, Decapitron\n&gt; &gt; went into the box thing, which also had an Autobot symbol, and \nthen\n&gt; &gt; the doors of the box shut, and then Decapitron was stuck, and he \nwas\n&gt; &gt; getting beaten and battered.  After the 10 minute torture process \nwas\n&gt; &gt; done in the box, Decapitron kept going.  Mechfluid and oil and \nstuff\n&gt; &gt; were pouring like mad, and he was mangled and dislocated and \nstuff.\n&gt; &gt; Finally, he was at the end, and was dumped off of the conveyer \nbelt\n&gt; &gt; and onto the ground.  The last thing he had seen back then when \nthat\n&gt; &gt; happened, was Autobots around him, laughing sinisterly with evil \neyes\n&gt; &gt; and faces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Flashback Ends*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Surgital was still...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
