His right optic was damaged to the\n&gt; extent that it no longer worked but his left optic still functioned fully!\n&gt; Dinobot could not blame Tavatron for shooting him  directly in the face\nbut\n&gt; then she couldn&#39;t blame him for taking this practice to a whole new level!\n&gt; Survival!\n&gt; It had been YEARS since Dinobot had ever felt the pure rush of adrenaline\n&gt; course through his veins but that is what he felt now!\n&gt; In fighting terms it was also known as &#39;Battle Rage!!!&#39;\n&gt; Dinobot looked around with his one good optic and finally spotted\nTavatron,\n&gt; his target!!    He breathed in deeply and quickly then let out a roar so\n&gt; blood chillingly fierce that it could have made a rock run in fear!*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; RUN!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Get paid while you shop!\n&gt; You also get an additional 10% off on retailers\n&gt; like--Disney.com, eCost.com, FogDog.com and more.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3416/7/_/_/_/955854568/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
