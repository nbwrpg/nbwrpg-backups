Everything connected.\n\nHis central fusion core was hit by Nightlight&#39;s fire and he exploded \nfew seconds after. His frame became a puzzle of half-fried pieces of \nmetal, his processors were utterly destroyed and his spark imploded, \ncreating a massive blast on the battlefield.\n\nRockseeker was dead.\n\nHowever, his last move was not in vain. The Radiant shot damaged the \nshields greatly, and his death implosion further eroded them.\n\nInside the base, Yggdrasil had to cover his optics as he saw the \nmonitor reporting the events. He was overwhelmed by joy as he \nrealized one of the attacker had perished... until he saw the base \nstatus report.\n\nYggdrasil: Holy slag! That can&#39;t be!
