He changed blasters, and this one was also quite small. He \nfired it at Termitron, it traveled quite fast, and the bullet was \npointy and had a cord attached to it. Stronghold was hit in the hand \n5 times and dropped his blaster. He dove down to pick it up and \nBlender stepped in front of him, making Stronghold no longer visible. \nHe was quite a big target. The 10 shots hit him and he made a sound. \nHis eyes narrowed and he looked at the hole in his neck where a shot \nhad hit him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blender: Hell has relocated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blender throws 3 knives in quick succession at Nightlight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Airbomber was hit by 2 of the shots before he flipped out of the \nline of fire and hid behind Train Wreck like the coward that he was...\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: airly2000@y... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, July 07, 2001 2:48 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Chivtrons under attack... again/Clash/Starstromp\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Nightlight/Termitron::\n&gt; \n&gt;   Termitron had left Starstromp in a cr and he ran outside and \n&gt;   shouted &quot;By the ROyalty and by the colony&quot;, base&#39;s shield turned \non \n&gt; \n&gt;   He fired 5 times against Stranato, 5 against Stronghold, 10 \nagainst \n&gt;   Blender and 5 times against Airbomber.
