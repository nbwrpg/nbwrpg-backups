At the moment, you didn&#39;t post for\n&gt; dodging Megatron&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; attack, Sunhawk grabbed Megatron and put him into\n&gt; a headlock, and \n&gt; &gt; then turned him around to face Kup&#39;s weaponfire.\n&gt; THAT is what&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; wrong. You should be posting that Sunhawks tries\n&gt; to grab Megatron to \n&gt; &gt; put him into a headlock, not that he suddenly has\n&gt; him in a headlock. \n&gt; &gt; =)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cause talking ooc style is delaying Megatron, I&#39;m\n&gt; going to just go \n&gt; &gt; with that you&#39;ve done. I&#39;m not sure that Azure\n&gt; wants Warhead dead, \n&gt; &gt; so Megatron is going to just try to run with\n&gt; Warhead.
