(She raised her voice) Who or whatever you \nare, we are not hostile to you. We demand safcon, the safe passage \nthrough this area.

She was willing to know more of him, after he\n&gt; &gt; had left the true \n&gt; &gt; Wolves.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katya: Tell me, Ragnar, how was it with Phelan? And\n&gt; &gt; what happened in \n&gt; &gt; the Arc-Royal Defense Cordon?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ragnar smiled: Well, it has been a job to keep the\n&gt; &gt; Jade Falcons back \n&gt; &gt; as we could from the cordon. The Kell Hounds did\n&gt; &gt; help a lot, and their \n&gt; &gt; mech facilities helped us to rebuild a rather strong\n&gt; &gt; touman. Then, I \n&gt; &gt; was captured by the Bears...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katya: Ah yes! I remember Bjorn Jorgensson saying\n&gt; &gt; once you were a key \n&gt; &gt; element for the Ghost Bears. What then?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ragnar thought for a moment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ragnar: Bjorn is a man I can call my friend, a\n&gt; &gt; soldier I can call a \n&gt; &gt; true warrior, and a politician of the kind of the\n&gt; &gt; Kerenskys! He \n&gt; &gt; trusted me, pushed me back to the warrior&#39;s way and\n&gt; &gt; eventually gave me \n&gt; &gt; command of the Rasalhague Bears. I never actually\n&gt; &gt; dreamt of commanding \n&gt; &gt; warriors of my former nation among the Clans...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katya remembered the time he was a wolf. A young and\n&gt; &gt; bright freeborn \n&gt; &gt; warrior of kind of Phelan Kell. He would have been\n&gt; &gt; bloodnamed too if \n&gt; &gt; he had proved to have common genetic material with\n&gt; &gt; clan bloodlines.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Her mind drifted and she looked at the sky. Her\n&gt; &gt; warden tendencies \n&gt; &gt; never prevented her to rise in a crusader clan, but\n&gt; &gt; she did not like \n&gt; &gt; the idea that she would not be totally able to\n&gt; &gt; prevent Vlad Ward to \n&gt; &gt; conquer the Inner Sphere.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She saw something in the sky and magnified to see\n&gt; &gt; enough of it. \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, she still could not make out what it\n&gt; &gt; was.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katya: There is something coming. It seems metallic\n&gt; &gt; and it is coming \n&gt; &gt; fast.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ragnar: Then we prepare...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Both transformed, once more becoming the war\n&gt; &gt; machines they guised as, \n&gt; &gt; ready to fight if need be.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
