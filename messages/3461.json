Getting \nready to pull the trigger, he felt the ground start to shake and heard the \n&quot;rumble&quot; of a very large engine.  Turning around, he saw the trees and grass \nstart to shake.  &quot;What in the Matrix?&quot;\n\nRamhorn gased as he saw a large red tank smash through the foilage, a large \ncannon in the middle pointing at him.  Dropping his pistol, his body not \nmoving with fear, Ramhorn screamed in horror as a gust of flames shot from \nthe cannon, engulfing him.\n\n---\n\nPyro transformed to robot mode, Ramhorn lying on the ground badly charred.  \nPyro chuckled.  &quot;Yes, yes, burn, burn, everything!&quot;\n\nA HUMVEE with two cannons on the side drove up, stopping, and transforming.  \nScavenger looked to Pyro.  &quot;I missed all the fun...&quot;\n&lt;Dark One, Pyro literally toasted a Maximal and...oooh, the fight.  I&#39;m going \nin!&gt;\n\nA large artillery cannon with four wheels rolled up, transforming into a \nrobot.  &quot;Excellent.&quot; Breakdown chuckled.\n\nA black space fighter flew overhead, transforming in mid air and landing on \nthe ground.  &quot;Perfect.&quot; Dark One said with a smile.\n\nHiss walked up.  &quot;Shall I go to my gun mode?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not yet.&quot; Dark One replied.  &quot;Let us all transform and engage the Maximals \nfurther.&quot; he said, everyone transforming and beginning to advance on the \nbattle.\n\n"}}
