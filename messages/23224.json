All the thoughts were beginning to put thier toll on her. \nlistening to thoughts was like straining to hear a conversation in a \ncrowded room. \n\nLunarpine tried to stay close to Razor Claw but somehow lost him in \nthe shuffle. He saw Torca, he knew the face but never got the chance \nto hear the name. Under the coverup of smalltalk the wolfbot tapped \nTorca on the shoulder(stealing a sample from his organic beast \nparts). &quot;We&#39;ve fought together but I&#39;ve never known your name.&quot; \nLunarpine knew him from the files he&#39;d seen so names were a small \nthing.\n\n\n"}}
