Purely by chance he stumbled upon a dead body in a \nclearing in the woods(Amp).  He possessed the body.  It was now weaponless \nbut he could still control his energy.  The body was no longer Amp the spark \nhad left the body for the matrix.  He began jogging in place learning to \ncontrol this new body.  He detected Galvatron and Optimus fighting on his \nscanners.  &quot;This will be worth while.  There will be a matrix without a body \nafter this battle.&quot;  He runs towards the battle.  He quickly decides not to \ninterfere.\n\n"}}
