He somewhat\nwanted to help Megatron, but still couldn&#39;t remember\nwhy he felt disdain towards him. And Rampage seemed to\nenjoy Megatron being down and mearly out. He didn&#39;t\nwant to make one of only 3 true friends he had ever\nhad mad at him.  Also he knew that given the same\nchance Megatron would undoubtedly finish him.  This\ngave him an idea. Rhesus had given him a STUN pistol\nbecause he didn&#39;t like to fight. Megatron couldn&#39;t\npossibly dodge it now. It might send him under, but\nhe&#39;d still be alive, and Rampage wouldn&#39;t hurt him. So\nhe took aim, mouthed the words &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; and pulled\nthe trigger.\n\n--- robertdahl &lt;rdahl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; As Rampage rolled up to near the Transmutate, he\n&gt; stopped, his crab head\n&gt; first looked up, &quot;Rampage, TERRORIZE.&quot; Through a\n&gt; backflip, Rampage\n&gt; shifted into his robot mode, holding his large\n&gt; Gattling cannon awquardly\n&gt; to a side. He looked to Mutate, and put a finger to\n&gt; his mouth,\n&gt; &quot;Shhhhhhhh.&quot; He whispere. &quot;Let me indulge in the\n&gt; pain surrounding this\n&gt; area.&quot; He turned, and held his hands up, as if\n&gt; grasping something, yet\n&gt; nothing was there. &quot;Yes, it&#39;s so cold, so much\n&gt; suffering. H AH ha ha\n&gt; ha.&quot; He began to cackle insanly, holding his cannon\n&gt; up, and firring\n&gt; missiles off randomly, his barrel shifting for a new\n&gt; missile to replace\n&gt; the old one, as barrages headed everywhere.\n&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Megatron tried to push himself upright, but could\n&gt; not, it can&#39;t end\n&gt; here, he thought to himself. &quot;Decepticons.&quot; He said\n&gt; through a strained\n&gt; voice, &quot;Fin....finish the retreat.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nFind a job, post your resume.\nhttp://careers.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
