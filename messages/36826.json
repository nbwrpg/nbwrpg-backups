She \nsaluted mockingly at Astrotrain&#39;s words and hungerly started tearing \naway at it&#39;s hull with her hands. Oh how she savored the useless \nobject&#39;s extemanation!! To top it off, she was glad Megatron still \nfunctioned.\n    Blindchaos made his way back onto the ship, mindful of\nWildrider&#39;s  \nWhereabouts. He didn&#39;t want to be accidently caught in the other \nDecepticon&#39;s demolition efforts. Blindchaos transformed himself into \nhis anamalistic form: an undersized Anklyosaur. He began knocking \nwalls in with his massive tail club, the noise music to his audio \nsensors.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n******************************\n\n\n"}}
