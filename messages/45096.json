If an RPG died because of it \n&gt; would be \n&gt; &gt; because no one wanted to go Cybertron (obvious there) or because \nit \n&gt; wasn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; done right.  Cybertron isn&#39;t really explored that much in the \n&gt; American \n&gt; &gt; Transformers cartoon, which is the only one I&#39;ve seen.  I&#39;d agree \n&gt; with LN, \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t base it on Beast Machines.  Yuk.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, on Cybertron, we could do more stuff.  In example, the \nfirst \n&gt; two \n&gt; &gt; seasons of TFs, undoubtedly the best but I guess you could say \n&gt; &#39;restricted&#39; \n&gt; &gt; to Earth and occassional visits to Earth.  Season three, \nundoubtedly \n&gt; not the \n&gt; &gt; best, did have many episodes OFF of Cybertron and Earth.  Going \nto \n&gt; different \n&gt; &gt; planets, etc.  A good concept there, even if most art and writing \n&gt; was...shall \n&gt; &gt; we say lacking?  Again, season three wasn&#39;t the best but it had a \n&gt; LOT of \n&gt; &gt; opportunities that this RPG would have as well.  Not to mention \nwe&#39;d \n&gt; get to \n&gt; &gt; make our own Cybertron and, well, yeah, I went over that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The biggest problem is we&#39;d have to make our own Cybertron.  I \nmean, \n&gt; we know \n&gt; &gt; what Earth looks like, all the places, the geography.  Buuuut, we \n&gt; don&#39;t know \n&gt; &gt; that for Cybertron and we&#39;d need to create it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As for the protohumans, early in the RPG people were equipping \nhuge \n&gt; gumby \n&gt; &gt; squads of protohumans with weapons and using them as massively \n&gt; destructive \n&gt; &gt; armies so they were banned, as they should be.  The RPG&#39;s got \nalong \n&gt; fine with \n&gt; &gt; gumbies that can&#39;t fight.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -L. Unitron\n\n\n"}}
