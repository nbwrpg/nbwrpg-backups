In a matter of seconds, it \nprojects a highly detailed holographic view of the planet. She points \nat the lower end of the southernmost continent.\n\nMeteara: I can&#39;t pinpoint exactly where the voice came from, but I am \nassured that I am the only one on this planet that can truly \ncommunicate with it. The language they speak is known to the Vok. I \nthink, though, that we can find something there. As for what we look \nfor...\n\nShe transforms to beast mode and looks to the glacial sea in front.\n\nMeteara: You are right about this piece here, Cybertronian Firaxis. It \nseems like a piece of some kind. I know not more. What called me \nthough, is called a Soul Orb. Their makers are enemies of the True \nVok. It was a challenge that they sent me.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Firaxis::\n&gt;        &quot;Aye ma&#39;am.&quot;  He picks up the artifact and places it in a \nstorage \n&gt; compartment in his shoulder.  &quot;So what do you suppose this thing is? \n It \n&gt; seems technical but it&#39;s way beyond anything I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;  He \nshrugs.  \n&gt; &quot;So where to now?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
