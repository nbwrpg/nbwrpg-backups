He tried to bring up his arm to block another, but the arm \nwas to\n&gt; damaged from his attempt to pick up Firearm, so another went to his \nleg,\n&gt; grazing it. He managed to dodge on more, and put Firearm in the way \nof\n&gt; another again, (again Yanshosh you can post damage). He then looked \nat his\n&gt; flying foe, &quot;Menasor.... Say you stupid, and hurt Maximal more than \nyou do\n&gt; me&quot;, he then continued towards Astroblast.\n\n\n"}}
