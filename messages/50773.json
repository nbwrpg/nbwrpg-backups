You see Nightlight Optimus had once been \n&gt;   brought \n&gt;   &gt;   back but with little control of himself. He was a zombie. It \nwas \n&gt;   all \n&gt;   &gt;   a Quintesson trap. He was to lead us Autobots to are \ndestruction. \n&gt;   &gt;   Prime fought it though and saved us, however he was on a ship \n&gt;   that \n&gt;   &gt;   was destroyed. We thought he was lost forever. About six \nmonths \n&gt;   later \n&gt;   &gt;   we learned that a Science ship from Earth had been near by. \nThey \n&gt;   were \n&gt;   &gt;   testing a new alloy, by seeing if their ship could withstand \na \n&gt;   sun \n&gt;   &gt;   going nova near by. It did. They also pulled Optimus out \nbefore \n&gt;   his \n&gt;   &gt;   ship was destroyed. They had also taken aboard spores from \nthe \n&gt;   sun. \n&gt;   &gt;   Mere contact with these spores turned living things into \nhateful \n&gt;   &gt;   maniacs. The scientists who found the spores hated \nTransformers \n&gt;   so \n&gt;   &gt;   they lead us to find Optimus. Then they infected many \nAutobots. \n&gt;   It \n&gt;   &gt;   soon spread to the Decepticons, the human race, and then into \nthe \n&gt;   &gt;   universe. Rodimus was even infected. We managed to have a \n&gt;   Quintesson \n&gt;   &gt;   rebuild Optimus once again. By coating himself in the alloy \nfrom \n&gt;   the \n&gt;   &gt;   science ship he was able to take the Matrix of Leadership \nfrom \n&gt;   &gt;   Rodimus. Optimus used the last power of the Matrix and \ndestroyed \n&gt;   the \n&gt;   &gt;   Plague with the wisdom of the ages. Optimus continued to lead \nus \n&gt;   from \n&gt;   &gt;   then on untill the Great Wrs ended. Thats when everything was \n&gt;   scaled \n&gt;   &gt;   down and Maximals and Predacons were born.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; OOC: The events I am talking about can be seen in the \nfollowing \n&gt;   &gt;   third season episodes of &quot;The Transformers&quot;: &quot;Dark \n&gt;   &gt;   Awakaning,&quot; &quot;Return of Optimus Prime Part. 1,&quot; and &quot;Return of \n&gt;   Optimus \n&gt;   &gt;   Prime Part. 2&quot;\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   From: airly2000 \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2002 12:13 AM\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Subject: Re: Rodimus, Quilldart, Galvatron\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Nightlight:\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &quot;But Didn&#39;t Optimus be...&quot;she didnt&#39;t dare to \n&gt;   say &quot;dead&quot;, &#39;cause \n&gt;   &gt;   that \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   could affect Rodimus.
