His \n&gt; motricity was still awful, but the call of the battle and the \nmockery \n&gt; of those Tripredacus were too strong. He managed to stand up, but \n&gt; putting one leg in front of the other was impossible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warhead: If I can not stand, I will transform!\n&gt; \n&gt; He went into his hovercraft mode, which was much more mobile. He \nmade \n&gt; it out of the base and, seeing Spike, fired at him with machine \nguns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael saw Spike too and greeted him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Whoever you are, you are welcome with us Tripredacus. Now \n&gt; fight with us!\n&gt; \n&gt; As he said these words, he received fully Quickstrike&#39;s energy \nblast. \n&gt; He countered, after getting up, with two light blasts of his own.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Very well, Megatron. We shall have it your way. Know this, \n&gt; though: the Dragon is a tough kill, but the Phoenix rises after \ndying! \n&gt; Now get out and fight me! Tripredacus! Attack now!\n&gt; \n&gt; Burrock, on his side, avoided the rocket shot by Inferno, but not \nby \n&gt; much. He got fried a bit from the blast, but was otherwise alright.\n&gt; \n&gt; Burrock: This sure beats those other absent clowns! NOW WHO&#39;S THE \n&gt; SMART METAL ASS WHO FIRED ON ME? YOU THE ONE?\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to Inferno and tried to grab him with his tendrils and \ncrush \n&gt; him.\n\n\n"}}
