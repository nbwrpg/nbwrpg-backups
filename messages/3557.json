He walked backwards from the door, then ran at it, leaping up and \nkicking it. He did it two more times. He paused, looking at the closed door. \nThen something logic clicked in his brain.\n\nComputer dummy! he brain shouted at him.\n\nHe looked up and commanded the computer, &quot;Computer, open the door where unit \nTransulas is!&quot; It took a second or two, then the door slid open. The Fuzor&#39;s \neyes lit up with anger as he saw Transulas leaning over to Dark Mouse. He \nran inside, as fast as he could, and braced himself as he rammed into the \nspider as hard as he could. For some reason, he was destined to stop him \nfrom killing her.\n\n\n&gt;From: JP3884@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Fri, 16 Jun 2000 19:55:24 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Transanulas ::: Yes....and now my dear....you die!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: With a quick, and final suck he drained her of enough mech fluid to \n&gt;kill\n&gt;her.
