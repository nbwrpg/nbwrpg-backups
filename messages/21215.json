Three quarters of her spark chamber was useable, I had to fix \nup the rest of it. She lost about a third of her memory. But to be on \nthe safe side, I uploaded a program that will keep her loyal to \nZardus. But I don&#39;t think that she is quiet the same as she was.  If \nzardus could give me the program he installed in her initially, I can \nupload it into her programs and return her to about 95% of what she \nwas before she got killed the first time.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::FZ::\n&gt; \n&gt; FZ turns to Squizzy after Feline walks out. &quot;Exactly how much \n&gt; permanent damage was done because of her death?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
