DevilDuer was still recovering from her \ncalling him \n&gt; handsome, a bit of jealousy going through him from the fact that \nFeline was \n&gt; bending over in front of Zardus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus&#39; eyes follow Feline back to her seat, an idea forming in his \nmind. \n&gt; Yess.. He had the perfect mission for her and the other new \nrecruit.

He taps his comm-link.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Bloodystrike,&quot; he says into it, his tone having its ussual deadly \nflavor, \n&gt; &quot;Please bring the new recruit, I might have a mission for him.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Bloodystrike takes a few steps back from Skulletron as he recieves \nZardus&#39; \n&gt; transmission, putting away his weapons.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ok, let&#39;s go to Zardus,&quot; he says to Skulletron, &quot;He wants to see \nyou.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
