Cool \nnew char, Teltoli.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, steph_teltoli@m... wrote:\n&gt; A figure snuck through the woods silently, watching the battle \n&gt; between the Alliance and the Maximals silently. He had his stealth \n&gt; mode on, so there was no possible way he could be detected, unless \n&gt; one saw the slight indents his hooves made on the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; His body was like one of a cenataur, yet slightly different. He had \n&gt; horse legs and body, but where the horse chest would be was a \n&gt; slightly human torso, with strong looking arms and chest. His face \n&gt; had no mouth, just a nose, pointed ears, and two black almond eyes. \n&gt; Atop his head sat two stalk eyes which could twist in any \ndirection. \n&gt; Where the horse tail would be, was a 2 meters long tail, with a \n&gt; scythe like blade, wickedly sharp and coated with poison, on the \nend.\n&gt; \n&gt; The stalk eyes swiveled slowly as he watched the battle, deciding \nthe \n&gt; attakers were indeed stronger, but the defenders had the heart in \n&gt; them. He sniggered. \n&gt; \n&gt; For now, he would be content to watch. \n&gt; \n&gt; His Stasis Pod had crashed not too far away from here, but since \n&gt; everybot was so consumed in this battle, he had snuck out and \n&gt; discovered the new world on his own.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a curious cock of his head, he noted neither faction seemed to \n&gt; have any leader. They were both disorganised, frantically firing in \na \n&gt; fight to save their lives, no control whatsoever. With simple \n&gt; planning, the Attackers would win easily.\n&gt; \n&gt; As he watched, he occasionally heard words being called out. Names, \n&gt; obviously. He didn&#39;t have a name. Staring into the night sky with \nhis \n&gt; stalk eyes, but keeping his main eyes on the battle, a whisper \n&gt; floated into his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Diabo..&#39; It said. He would have smiled, if he had a mouth. A \nperfect \n&gt; name. A name that protrayed his personality. A name that his leader \n&gt; had used once.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: Diabo actually means Devil.. or Evil Soul in Spanish.., I&#39;ll \n&gt; send in a Profile soon)\n\n\n"}}
