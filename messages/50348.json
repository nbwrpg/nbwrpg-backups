Besides they&#39;re not asking us to totally\n&gt; give up being a Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hawk:  Very well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Back in the real world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Owlhawk:  Very well.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ragnar turned to Katya and nodded.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ragnar: I will go and warn Rodimus of the outcome of\n&gt; &gt; this trial.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He walks away, making the ground tremble slightly\n&gt; &gt; with every step.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katya: He sees true in your potential. You are\n&gt; &gt; strong. However, being \n&gt; &gt; a Clansman... err... Clansbot in your case, that is\n&gt; &gt; more than \n&gt; &gt; techniques. It is a lot of training, and probably a\n&gt; &gt; major change of \n&gt; &gt; minds. We Clans value zellbringen, single combat.\n&gt; &gt; Even in a melee, we \n&gt; &gt; tend to engage no more than one enemy at the time.\n&gt; &gt; Also, honor is \n&gt; &gt; above everything else in every aspect of our life...\n&gt; &gt; except maybe \n&gt; &gt; politics, but that is easily answered through\n&gt; &gt; combat. Are you willing \n&gt; &gt; to become a Clan Warrior?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Owlhawk braced himself and put his hands in front\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him to absorb most of the shock of running into\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wall.  Then he stood up and faced them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Owlhawk:  Verywell, I&#39;m open to new techniques.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The punch threw the female warrior far away.

You do have the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wolf&#39;s soul and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bear&#39;s strenght. You have bested me in this\n&gt; &gt; contest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We will work as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; part of the Maximals as of now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar&#39;s towering form came next to her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar: You are a powerful warrior, Owlhawk, and\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been thinking. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that you could serve the Maximals even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better if we steep \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you in the ways of the Clans.
