I could see the ground thing in that\nmuch like a loud sound could rattle your chest, like at a conscert and\nyou can feel the beat in your chest. But what do you mean by flashes\nof lightning?\n\nJust making sure I have a clear understanding before I have a clear\nunderstanding. Tuscon&#39;s sonic roar could be as loud as thunder and\neven perhaps sound like it, but would not be thunder in the sense of\nbeing part of the weather patterns.\n\nFor instance nearby thunder can range as loud as 120 Db. For\nreferences: This is roughly the equivalent to being within 200 feet of\na jet aircraft during take-off or about 3 feet from an auto horn. A\nchain saw is rated around 100 decibels. A sound of 140 decibels is\npainfully loud. [Note each 10 decibel increase in noise level seems\ntwice as loud.]\n\nI would imagine that Tuscon is probrably like Brawl in this matter,\nbut more effective in its use, meaning he can hit at almost 300 Db if\nconscentrated into a blast, probrably 200 in a cone and 150 in a wave.\n\n300 (BEAM) can blow out metal and concrete and such like. Basically as\npowerful as any blast Megatron, Gavatron, Optimus Prime, Rodimus or\nany other leader type can deliver. It is just created from Sonic\nenergies rather than more conventional energies.\n\n200 (CONE) Could concievably kill a human and probrably cause serious\ndamage on some of the sensative inner workings of a transformer. Could\ndo things like blow out glass and other unprotected crystalized\nmaterials.\n\n150 (CIRCLE) Painfully loud and POSSIBLY stunning affects.\n\nHere is a list of Db counts. I cannot say I would follow it\nreligiously, since this is a Scifi settings and the transformers are\nnot human, but it would give you an idea and could spark creativity.\nHowever some things may not work exactly as planned. So if you are\ngoing to try something special, PLEASE talk it over with me first.\n\nhttp://www.makeitlouder.com/Decibel%20Level%20Chart.txt\n\nI hope all this gives food for thought.\n\n- Preston\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 9/17/11, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perhaps just the lightning flashes would suffice.
