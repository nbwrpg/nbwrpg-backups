I had to reinstall \nmy internet server, witch should work bug-free from now on. Sorry I took so \nlong to reply^_^)\n\nTavatron turned, her back to Dinobot. Her shoulders slumped and her ears \nhung limp on either side of her head. She knew what he wanted, why he had \ncome. Why couldn�t the past leave her be? No matter where she went, or how \nquickly she could run it always seemed to catch up with her in the end. \nTavatron crossed her arms and sat beside the cliffs edge, one leg dangling \nprecariously over the edge. She just wanted to forget it all. Why couldn�t \nshe? The past was always there, lingering in the deepest recesses of her \nmind. Taunting, teasing her. Why wouldn�t it leave her alone?!! Tavatron \ngrasped a small stone and hurtled it with all her might over the edge and \ninto the forest below.\n\nTavatron closed her eyes as she tried to regain her composure. Dinobot�s \nslow, steady breathing echoed in her ears. She knew he wanted an answer, a \nreason. It was a merely a question of whether or not he liked what he heard. \nThrough closed optics a shadowy image began to focus. The image grew in size \nand intensity until it exploded in a fireball that consumed everything \nwithin a reasonable radius. Tavatron�s optics snapped open, expecting to \nfind a ruined and burning colony. Instead a silent forest met her terrified \ngaze. The wind chilled her sweat dotted body as it blew across the dry \nlandscape that surrounded her. Tavatron took several deep breaths before her \nspark beat slowed and she once again was able to regain her composure:\n\n&quot;I expect nothing from you�&quot;\n\n*You have already given me more than you will ever know.*\n\nTavatron kept this thought to herself. She wanted to tell him just how much \ntheir friendship meant to her, but couldn�t for fear of what would happen if \nshe DID say something. Tavatron continued to gaze into the beyond, almost \nnot hearing Dinobot�s reluctant apology.\n\nTavatron�s ears perked and swiveled in his direction at the words and \n�apology� and �you may have it�. She was speechless. This, of all things, \nwas the absolutely LAST thing she had ever expected to hear from the stoic \nwarrior. Perhaps he had softened a bit since she met him. He wasn�t weak, \nno, far from it. He was, however, becoming compassionate, even if he was \nunwilling to admit it.\n\n&quot;That was a very�&quot;\n\nTavarton thought for a moment, unsure of what to say. He unfinished sentence \nhung in the air before her like so many things she had yet to accomplish. \nThis one task, however, was something she was sure she could complete.\n\n&quot;�honorable thing to do. Thank you.&quot;\n\nTavatron fell to her back with a soft thud. One leg still hung over the \ncliff�s edge, but her upper body was no longer upright. She crossed her arms \nand rested her head on top of them. The small dust cloud that formed around \nher quickly dissipated. She looked up and over at the bottom of Dinobot�s \njaw and underbelly, right now that was all she could see of him in this \nposition. Her voice had grown quiet and somewhat subdued as she spoke:\n\n&quot;I am disappointed in myself as well.&quot;\n\nTavatron took a deep breath. Only the survivors of the incident on the \ncolony had known of what occured there. Should she tell him? Something told \nher she could trust him, but still�\n\nFirst, there was something she had to know:\n\n&quot;Dinobot, why did you follow me? I know this is against your nature, so \ndon�t try to rationalize that it isn�t.&quot;\n\nShe didn�t mean to sound demanding, but she had to know why he came after \nher. She would have bet her life savings that he would say to the pit with \nher and left her out here to rot. She just had to know.  A sudden cawing of \nbirds drew Tavatron�s attention skyward as they took off in a black cloud of \nfeathers. There was something beyond them, she could see it out of the \ncorner of her eye. It was shooting across the sky, but a sudden growing in \nthe intensity of the birds� cawing drew her attention from the object. When \nshe looked again it had vanished. No matter, it was probably nothing \nimportant anyway. Perhaps she was just seeing things.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
