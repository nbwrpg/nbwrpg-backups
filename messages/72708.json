There was no hint of strange pyramid\nthat had housed the CORNU, the path was hidden and even the vegetation\nhad seemed to change somewhat, becoming more jungle-like again instead\nof the forest they had been in before.\n\n&quot;This is where my journey ends.&quot; ASTRA said calmly and yet with a hint\nof sadness. &quot;I hope you find what you seek.
