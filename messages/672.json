Forgive me, please.)\n\n* Carnage sighed as she looked at the massive land mass which floated over \nthe sea, so...that was where the signatures were coming from. She sighed and \nlooked at Teltoli, it would be no problem for her to get to it, it wouldn&#39;t \nbe a problem for Cyber Claw either, but her? She was a land crawler, her \nfeet were meant to walk on land...not air.\nCarnage looked at the Island again, up there was the Maximal base...their \ndestination.\nShe listened to Teltoli&#39;s question and sighed again, she had no clue as to \nwhat she would do after she and the clone scraped Megatron. Maybe wander the \nplanet, but for what reason? To explore? Maybe she would pick a side and \njoin it, Maximals or Predacons. With Megs out of the way she would be able \nto rejoin the Predacons if she wished.\nCarnage spat at the idea, they were her tormenters and they had made her a \nkilling machine, why in the Pit would she even consider joining back up with \nthem?\nShe looked at Teltoli and slumped her shoulders...*\n\n&quot; I have no idea what I&#39;ll do after I kill Megatron. I guess that we&#39;ll see \nwhen it happens, huh?&quot;\n\n*************************************************************\n\n* Dinobot saw Scourge&#39;s missiles heading for him, he saw that he could avoid \nthe main mass of charges but not all. He swerved to the side and dodged most \nof them but the last few hit him dead on.\nDinobot snarled as he was forced to take a few steps back but then took his \nground back and fired at the oncoming Scourge, he hated it when they \nunderestimated him.\nDinobot took a quick glance to the left and saw that Tavatron wasn&#39;t to far \naway and battling the enemies as well.\nHe turned his attention back to the charging Scourge, he might have to teach \nthis Predacon a lesson in close range combat that he won&#39;t soon forget!!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
