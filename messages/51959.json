His mouth and nose are covered by an unmoving \nfaceplate.  If you&#39;ve ever seen the G1 Wheeljack, that&#39;s kinda what \nhe looks like.)\n\nJackie lets out a whistle to get the femme&#39;s attention.  &quot;Helloooooo, \nnurse!&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;raccoon7679&quot; &lt;raccoon7679@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Smidgen:::\n&gt; Smidgen had climbed back into the ship to gather supplies and other \n&gt; things she would need for camping out that night.  She had gathered \n&gt; the emergency food/energon rathions, a few small back up lights \nthat \n&gt; were battery opperated, she even took out the lazy boy co-pilot \n&gt; chair and stuck the base into the ground. Deciding to stay night, \n&gt; she made a small circle of stones and built a campfire. She sat \nback \n&gt; in her lazy boy chair with her pistol still at her side.  Being in \n&gt; unkwon territory still made her feel uneasy.  BUt she had figurerd \n&gt; that since no bot had come for her by now, probably no bot would.  \n&gt; She pulled out a small energon cube fron her lunch pack and munched \n&gt; on it contently. She saw a small bird land on a nearby trtee \n&gt; branch. &quot;So what&#39;s this place called? What&#39;s the rest of the wild \n&gt; life like? Oh, and let me guess, you want to see my transport \npapers \n&gt; right?&quot; she laughed and chuckled. &quot;Ahh, first real sign of life, \nand \n&gt; it can&#39;t even tell me where to find a fast food joint in these \n&gt; parts.&quot;  She was finally starting to feel relaxed about this \nplace.  \n&gt; Feeling somewhat restless though, she got up and placed a few empty \n&gt; containers on a log and started to work on target practice. She hit \n&gt; most of them, but she was no great marksbot.  She sighed and kept \n&gt; practicing.  She hit them all down and stood them back up to shoot \n&gt; again.  While shooting, her small pocket scanner started showing a \n&gt; blib heading in her direction.  But she didn&#39;t hear it over the \n&gt; pistol fire. &quot;DANG! I Knew I should have gone to those target \n&gt; classes back in school!&quot;  She kept up her taret practice, unaware \nof \n&gt; her scanner. \n\n\n"}}
