Running in through the breach in the hull, he rolled, still in a \ncloaked mode.  Getting to his feet, he slowly came up, behind Ramhorn and \nBeachcomber.  Raising his pinchers, he fired two missiles each, sending the \nMaximals &quot;flying&quot; forward, in the way of some of the autogun fire, going \nunconsciouss.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown, Pyro, and Scavenger had stuck together, weapons raised.  They were \nprancing through the Ark like they owned it, looking for the Predacons that \nhad gotten in.\n\n"}}
