Could you respond to the one bellow. I \ndont\n&gt; mind if you shoot me, that&#39;s not the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Sinnertwin had followed the mech fluid for a while now, smelling \nthe fresh\n&gt; &gt;wound in the robot. His instincts where alive, with the chance of\n&gt; &gt;Destruction. As he emerged from the foiliage he saw the cave, \nwhere the oil\n&gt; &gt;led. &quot;Grrrrr, Autobot in there&quot; yelled one of the heads, &quot;Yesss, \nand meat\n&gt; &gt;is fresh. Goood, me like it when he strugle&quot;. After the one head \nfinished,\n&gt; &gt;it snapped at the other. It then moved in on the cave, closing the \ndistance\n&gt; &gt;between him and the cave. He transformed and held out his grenade \nlauncher.\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Autobot come out, and we kill him painlessly. If he does not, we \nhave lots\n&gt; &gt;of fun&quot; he yelled at Condor.\n\n\n"}}
