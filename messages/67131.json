If Unicron is Victorious, then we have the\nhonor of dying gloriously in battle.&quot;\n\n     Myrmidon paused for a long moment studying\nHydras, and then continued his voice somehow softer\nyet even more forceful, &quot;Yet, if we are alone out\nhere, with only a small number of us, we are\nvulnerable. Even a dragon can be taken down if there\nare are sufficient arrows. No beast can stand alone\nagainst the world. Once the great battle against\nUnicron is over, we would face either the combined\nforces of our enemies and we would be slain, or the\nforces of Unicron and we still die.&quot; \n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nPinpoint customers who are looking for what you sell. \nhttp://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
