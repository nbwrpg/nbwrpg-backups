Stars shed immense\namount of energy,  the planets constantly rotate on an axis, and a worm\nhole opens up. But upon closer inspection, the worm hole is neither\nnatural, or peaceful like its surrounding. A very small interstellar\nshuttle emerges from the worm hole, with laser fire on its tail. The\nthrusters are burning more than they normally should, for they are damaged,\nand the ship starts to careen out of control, towards the third planet from\nthe power eminating star.\n\nInside the shuttle three robots run around, but it is to dark to make out\ntheir appearance, the only light, comes from small fires bursting up\neverywhere. One of the larger ones stops at a fire, and aims both hands at\nit. A swhirl of blue energy builds up, then shoots a beam of liquid\nnitrogen at the fire putting it out. Another, very small robot gets into\nthe control chair, and attempts to steer the ship, &quot;No good, its out of\ncontrol&quot; he says. Then the third robot runs over to a consol, &quot;Hey, dont\nworry guys, i&#39;ll send a distress signal, just close the transwarp portal,\nbefore our friends follow us&quot;.  At the calm words of the blue robot at the\nconsol, the one in the control chair flips a button.\n\nOutside, the worm hole closes up, and all is as it should have been, except\nfor the small ship, starting to burn as it enters the atmosphere.\n\nOver an old Autobot frequency, and emergency signal begins, &quot;emergency, our\nship is out of control, we will require assistance, and more than likely,\nrepairs when we crash&quot; and this message plays over loops, as the ship\ndescends towards Turkey, making a flaming path through the atmosphere on\nits descent.\n\n\n\n"}}
