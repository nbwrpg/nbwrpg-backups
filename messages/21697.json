She didn&#39;t want him to leave, \nor die? Some hope swelled in the Maximal as he hears her words, \nhappiness swelling in him as he feels the love flowing from her.\n\nHis arms slide around her as she hugs him, Prowl looking down into \nIron Raptor&#39;s eyes. The effect her exclamation had on him was \namazing. He felt love for her flowing through him, and knew that she \nwould be able to feel it too. Combined with the emotions he felt from \nher, this was the strongest feeling he&#39;d ever had.\n\n&quot;I love you too,&quot; he says, leaning forward to kiss her. There were no \nlonger any thoughts of jealousy, no thought crossed his mind but one \nof how much he loved the femm in his arms.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * He hadn&#39;t responded to her kiss, and she knew that his depression \nwent \n&gt; very deep by that alone if not the fact that she could feel it too.\n&gt; But she looked back into his eyes as he leaved back and looked into \nher own.\n&gt; Her fingers stroked his cheek as he appologized, almost waiting to \nhear him \n&gt; call her something like love or darling or anything else.\n&gt; Though, she heard Prowl wishing that maybe it would be better if \nOblitertron \n&gt; had killed him instead of nearly doing so, making Oron Raptor look \nat Prowl \n&gt; with an expression that spoke for him not to think like that. Then \nthinking \n&gt; that it would be better for HER if Prowl died in the next battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; No!&gt; was her thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then realizing through Prowls thoughts that they were linked in a \nway so \n&gt; that if one of them died the other would do so too, wondering just \nwhat else \n&gt; was included in this deal that Prowl had made with the Matrix.\n&gt; Iron Raptors expression changed to that of surprise as Prowl speaks.\n&gt; Her voice a little shaky, half of it being from the feelings which \nwere \n&gt; running through Prowl.\n&gt; Finally one feeling recognizable over all in her mind, love.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; No! Don&#39;t talk like that! I don&#39;t want anyone else, I want you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Then hearing Prowl finish his sentance in his mind, making her \nsuddenly \n&gt; take him in her arms and hug him to her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I love you!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
