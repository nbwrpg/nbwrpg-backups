His visor flared.\n\nHoist pulled himself out from underneath the main computer, and opened\nup a large circuit board. He then began to fuse it with his laser\nwielder, as he kept holding it up, the whole time humming to himself.\nThen after a bit his wielder died. &quot;There, i&#39;ll see if that works.&quot; He\nleaned over, and spoke into a microphone. &quot;Commander, can you hear me,\nif you can that means we can now communicate over long distances again.&quot;\nhe said hopefully. Now was the moment of truth.\n\nCliffjumper was taking a step to stop grimlock, when he heards a fizzle\nof electricity, and a scream over to his right. &quot;Strafe.&quot; he yelled\nworriedly, as the Technobot began to short circuit. He took a few short\nstrides, then began to sprint towards the technobot, until a blue fizzle\nof the same electricity engulfed him, and his legs stopped moving in\nfull motion, as his momentum took him forwards, first onto his stomach,\nthen bouncing roughly onto his back, as he twitched from the heavy\noverload. He then opened his mouth, and let out a pained scream.\n))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))\n\n\n&quot;Cliffjumper&quot; Firedrill yelled, he knew that scream. He quickly reved\nhis engine, and zoomed towards the noise, forgetting everything around\nhim.\n\n"}}
