He was still not sure of Hydras, a being who was the fusion of\nthe Galvatron he knew, but also of a Megatron that he did not.\nSometime he saw Galvatron in Hydras&#39; attitude, but then sometimes\nsomething else. He frowned, not sure if he were willing to do this,\nyet for part of him it felt right.\n\n&quot;Yess&quot; Skorponok said, cutting through Cyclonus&#39; silence as he stepped\nforward, &quot;Perceptor will have much to do. I will keep your base\nsecure.&quot;\n\nScourge glanced at the massive Skorponok, not sure what to make of\nhim, although his first instinct was not to trust him.\n\n&quot;No.&quot; Cyclonus&#39; said, finally speaking. &quot;I will.&quot;\n\nSkorponok glanced at Cyclonus frowning, anger stretching itself across\nhis face.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus & Scourge/Rodimus/Skorponok)\n\n"}}
