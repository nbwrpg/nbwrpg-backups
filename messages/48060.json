Let&#39;s take extra\n&gt; readouts before we \n&gt; report back to base. Inferno and Rage, you&#39;ll scan\n&gt; the mass of this \n&gt; energon cluster. Nightshade, determine its\n&gt; stability. Drillbit, find \n&gt; out at what depth it is. I&#39;ll try to take a sample\n&gt; after I know all \n&gt; this.\n&gt; \n&gt; He waits for his team to report back\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: For your knowledge, it is a sphere of energon,\n&gt; of variable \n&gt; stability and buried at about 20 meters in the\n&gt; ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;catmastero&quot; &lt;catmastero@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;catmastero&quot; &lt;catmastero@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He moves on, as ordered.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shoot, this is boring&quot; Quickstrike mumbled\n&gt; while moving on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Opps ingore that post I got the patrols mixed\n&gt; up\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; IC:\n&gt; &gt; Inferno moved on hoping to find someting of\n&gt; usefull ness\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Is there anyone in charge of what we find or\n&gt; are we waiting for \n&gt; &gt; the map to get up?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
