He caught another scent on the wind, another \nwolf. He knew how to handle this though. He snarled loudly as a sign \nto the scavenger that this was his prize. He knew from pack instincts \nthat the other wolf would recognize Lunarpines size strength, and \nhealth as a sign of dominance. Ice wasn&#39;t on the menu tonight.\n\n\nThe clean up drones continued to take care of the virus infected \nblood. Lunarpine watched as they dusted through his footprints \ncleaning up all traces of blood. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you know this or \nnot but you just came close to ending us all.&quot; He knew he was immune, \nhe also knew that if the virus would&#39;ve gotten out that every faction \non this tiny little world would hunt them down and force them to \nshare the same fate.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She growled slightly as she was picked up. Her mind went into a \nsemi \n&gt; dream state.  The virus was still changing her in some ways.  Her \n&gt; telepathic abilities were getting stronger. She heard what \nLunarpine \n&gt; was thinking, but not reacting to it.  In her dream state, she \ncould \n&gt; see through Lunarpine&#39;s mind and sees.  She saw him carrying her \nand \n&gt; knew he was taking her back to the base.  She heard his curious \nmind \n&gt; wondering what had happened to her.  She thought about it herself \nand \n&gt; couldn&#39;t quite find the answers.  She just knew that the matrix \n&gt; wanted it this way and she would just have to live with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her shoulder was dripping blood down onto Lunarpine. Even in her \n&gt; sleep, she could smell the blood. She didn&#39;t like th smell of it at \n&gt; all.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine thought he&#39;d heard something, no someone calling to \n&gt; &gt; him. &quot;What was that?&quot; He wondered, smelling the air again. He \n&gt; &gt; followed the scent to her. He could still hear her words in his \n&gt; head \n&gt; &gt; when she called to him. &quot;What&#39;s become of you?&quot; He thought, \n&gt; curiosity \n&gt; &gt; flooding his mind.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He heard a voice over his comm. Veratis wanted an update on the \n&gt; &gt; situation. &quot;I found her&quot; he replied, getting her back was going \nto \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; the diffivult part.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Three clean up drones aproached scanning her. A needle came out \nof \n&gt; &gt; the first one and headed for Ice. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;No&quot; Lunarpine yelled as he grabbed hold of it, It was trying to \n&gt; &gt; neutralise the virus. He knew that if that happened she&#39;d be \ndead. \n&gt; &gt; Veratis reprogrammed 2 of the drones to help get her back. \n&gt; Lunarpine \n&gt; &gt; picked Ice up on his back and with the help of the drones began \n&gt; &gt; carrying her back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
