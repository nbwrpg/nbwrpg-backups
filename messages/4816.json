This isn&#39;t right. He thought to \nhimself, he shouldn&#39;t have fins or a mouth filled with sharp teeth. Soon \neverything went dark.\n\n    When he awoke he knew who he was, but he was not Bazooka. He knew that \nsomething happened and that he should be something else. But he knew that he \nliked the body he was in. And he remembered two different pasts. Almost like \nhe had a new Spark. His name is CyberShark. The water began to drain from his \nbirth place, he knew he must transform.\n    &quot;CyberShark, Transform.&quot; He declared. He was now in an impressive robot \nmode. (Putting a pic in the next mail) He walked out to greet all the people, \nbut he still remembered most of them. Bobertron, Magmatron, Shredder, \nMantella, and one named Bazooka. But if he remembered he killed Bazooka, or \nwas that an actual memory?\n\n"}}
