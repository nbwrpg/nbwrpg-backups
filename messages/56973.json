For a bit of R&R.\nBut now it looked like she didn&#39;t have that in mind anymore.\n\nSo, not quite knowing what to do...they looked to their commander for any \nideas on the situation.\nAnd by then, D.R. was already searching her internal thought banks.\nMaxima had mentioned &quot;action&quot;, which, to her suggested battle. Or something \nalong those lines.\nBut they weren&#39;t equip properly for combat, and their weapons were mainly \nused to help in their research somehow.\nNot fight.\n\nD.R. put on the breaks and skidded to a stop.\nWell, this Maxima was the one who&#39;d come to rescue them...so the least they \ncould do was go with her and see if they could help her in any way.\nSo, in a wide turn, she followed after the animal/jet plane. Followed by her \nown little group.\n\nSand Storm revved his engine in confusion as he drove up alongside Blue \nFlame. &quot; What the slag are we doing? We&#39;re not battle bots!&quot; he complained \nin a high whine.\nAlthough Blue Flame only kept driving. &quot; Don&#39;t you know ANYTHING about \nDiesel Runner? She&#39;s just listening to her inner programming.&quot;\n\nThe little dune buggy didn&#39;t get it. &quot; Well, that &#39;inner programming&#39;s going \nto get us killed.&quot;\n&quot;No it won&#39;t, Sand Storm. D.R. knows what she&#39;s doing.&quot; the big semi \nanswered confidently.\n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well...she&#39;s a battle bot and knows all about combat and things like that. \nSo it&#39;s not like she&#39;s going to lead us blindly into danger or anything.&quot; \nBlue Flame explained.\n\nThis got a shock from Sand Storm, &quot;But I thought she was a research bot like \nthe rest of us. I didn&#39;t know she knew how to fight.&quot; he confessed.\n\n&quot;Actually, D.R.s battle training goes all the way back to the end of the \nGreat War between the Autobots and the Decepticons.&quot;\n\nSand Storm just drove along, listening to Blue Flame&#39;s history lesson. So \nthe huge semi-truck went on.\n&quot; Back in those days it&#39;s rumored that Galvatron had a few followers on \nCybertron. Though they laid low so that the Autobots wouldn&#39;t be any the \nwiser. Yet they wanted to help Galvatron win the war, so they constructed a \nfew new transformers for his cause.\nSad thing is, by the time the transformers rolled off the assembly line, the \nAutobot&#39;s had already won the war and Galvatron was nowhere to be found. And \nthe new Golden Age of cybertron had returned.&quot;\nHe paused for a moment.\n&quot; Diesel Runner was one of those transformers. A new breed that would have \nput Cyclonus and those Sweeps of Galvatron&#39;s to shame.\nBut they never got the chance.\nInstead, as the eons passed by and the relationships between the Autobots \nand Decepticons evened out, old army bots like D.R. were restationed to easy \njobs. Like research. Where they&#39;d be out of trouble.\nTruth is, battle&#39;s in her programming. And there&#39;s no denying it.\nIt&#39;s just a shame Galvatron wasn&#39;t around long enough to recruit those few \nbots...because they could have spelled his victory instead of defeat.&quot;\n\n&quot;Maybe then we wouldn&#39;t be treated like slag NOW by the Autobots and their \nprissy offspring, if we&#39;d won the war instead.&quot; Sand Storm commented, with a \nbit more venom in his voice then he thought possible.\nBut, then again, he&#39;d never liked the Maximals, and always steered clear of \nthe Autobots too.\nEven the Predacons treated them with as little or no respect as those other \ntwo factions.\nWhat had Cybertron come to?\n\nStill, it was kind of neat to know now that they were being led by one of \nthe transformers who&#39;d been construction especially to help Galvatron&#39;s \ncause. Although she&#39;d never gotten the chance.\nKind of made the thought of battle seem not so bad after all.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
