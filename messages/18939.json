She got a hot cup of Cybertron \ntea and went back to the bridge.  She sat back down in the captian&#39;s \nchair and watches the external monitors.  She thought about the new \nPredacon council and how things might work out for her troops.  She \nwanted them to make it through the war and find some peace in the \ncrazy world.  She thought about what would happen if she and Drillbit \nfinally had the chance to settle down. She chuckled quietly to \nherself at the thought of offspring.  She shook her head and checked \nthe monitors again.  She sighed and sat back in the chair.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The remaining babies woke up moving slowly around taking internal \ninventory.\n&gt; One reached a vent on the bridge. it crawled out and started moving \ntowards\n&gt; KitKat.\n\n\n\n"}}
