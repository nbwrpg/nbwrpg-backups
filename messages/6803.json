He could easily confirm his suspicions by scanning them, but \nhe didn&#39;t want them to get the wrong idea. The idea of a Maximal \nwalking behind him with an activated weapon didn&#39;t ease his tension \nmuch either.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster nods. &quot;Me and Hysteria will accompany you.
