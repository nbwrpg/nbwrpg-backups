A wave of so=\r\nnar energy is cast from his throat and powerful\n  &gt; vocalizers. Sharp teeth=\r\n and fangs glimmer in the moonlight as a strong\n  &gt; silver tail thrashes th=\r\ne ground beneath his four feet.\n\n  As TUSCON&#39;s warning is heard the Predaco=\r\nns shift their audio circuits\n  off as they glance back at at the large dra=\r\ngon.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;RRROOOAAARRR!!!&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n  TUSCON&#39;s roar can be heard for hundreds of=\r\n miles as the sound of it\n  echoes and re-echoes out across the miles and m=\r\niles of dead dinosaurs.\n  One of the first things he reailzes is that altho=\r\nugh capable of large\n  amounts of damage, It is rougher and cruder in its s=\r\nensory mode, but\n  capable of far more damage then he could once deliver be=\r\nfore.\n\n  It is almost like a wind has picked up and blown some of the bodie=\r\ns\n  back. Dinosaurs that are caught in the cone of effect are broken and\n  =\r\ntossed about, bones vibrating and then snapped as if hit by a tidal\n  wave,=\r\n although instead of one of water, this one is made of sound.\n\n  No, it was=\r\n not the same as his original sonar, but it was very effective indeed!\n\n  A=\r\nround TUSCON the Predacons, as well as probrably the Maximals leaped\n  out =\r\nof the way as the cones sweeps through. At high enough levels\n  sound can d=\r\no actual physical damage and not just bust ear drums and\n  over load audio =\r\ncircuits.\n\n  As the roar dies down, the damage that is done is incredible a=\r\nnd\n  TUSCON&#39;s energy cells are slowly trying to recharge themselves from\n  =\r\nsuch a high energy output (OOC: He has to catch his breath). Across\n  the s=\r\nensors there is no evidence of anyone being affected beyond the\n  dead dino=\r\nsaurs and the movement of TUSCON&#39;s allies.\n\n  As far as anyone could tell e=\r\nither their enemy was out of range of\n  TUSCON&#39;s roar or was protected by t=\r\nhem in some manner.\n\n  &quot;That was interesting.&quot; SKY SHADOW said from his pos=\r\nition next to\n  HYDRAS as he shrugged his shoulders.\n\n  &quot;And loud!&quot; INJECTO=\r\nR said as he buzzed near by.

Waspinator, look I know =\r\nyou hate me with a passion and you aren&#39;t exactly \non my friends list but I=\r\n want you to know that I really admire your loyalty \ntoward this mission an=\r\nd having the tolerance to work with an enemy bot.&nbsp; \nYou&#39;re doing a rea=\r\nlly good job, keep it up.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perpetually on the move and const=\r\nantly busy. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On Aug 11, 2011, at 12:25 PM, Super Cyclonus &l=\r\nt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/A&gt;&g=\r\nt;

If we fight, it will not=\r\n be from a \n  stab in the back or a&lt;BR&gt;reprogramming, it will be machine to=\r\n machine weapon \n  to weapon.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There was a grunt from RODIMUS, &quot;You =\r\nknow Cyclonus, I \n  almost look&lt;BR&gt;foward to that.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The two drove on=\r\n, trying to find a way \n  for mortal enemies to work together.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nOLD \n  &lt;Tuscon&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; STAND BY ALL SOLDIERS! DEPLOYING SONA=\r\nR ATTACK \n  AT FULL STRENGTH!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; With a deep breath, Tucson r=\r\nattles the \n  horizon with a sensor splitting sonic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; inhibited roar.=\r\n A wave of sonar \n  energy is cast from his throat and powerful&lt;BR&gt;&gt; voc=\r\nalizers. Sharp teeth \n  and fangs glimmer in the moonlight as a strong&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; silver tail thrashes \n  the ground beneath his four feet.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As TUS=\r\nCON&#39;s warning is heard the \n  Predacons shift their audio circuits&lt;BR&gt;off a=\r\ns they glance back at at the \n  large dragon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RRROOOAAAR=\r\nRR!!!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;TUSCON&#39;s \n  roar can be heard for hundreds of mile=\r\ns as the sound of it&lt;BR&gt;echoes and \n  re-echoes out across the miles and mi=\r\nles of dead dinosaurs.&lt;BR&gt;One of the \n  first things he reailzes is that al=\r\nthough capable of large&lt;BR&gt;amounts of \n  damage, It is rougher and cruder i=\r\nn its sensory mode, but&lt;BR&gt;capable of far \n  more damage then he could once=\r\n deliver before.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is almost like a wind \n  has picked up and blown=\r\n some of the bodies&lt;BR&gt;back. Dinosaurs that are caught \n  in the cone of ef=\r\nfect are broken and&lt;BR&gt;tossed about, bones vibrating and then \n  snapped as=\r\n if hit by a tidal&lt;BR&gt;wave, although instead of one of water, this \n  one i=\r\ns made of sound.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No, it was not the same as his original sonar, \n  b=\r\nut it was very effective indeed!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Around TUSCON the Predacons, as wel=\r\nl \n  as probrably the Maximals leaped&lt;BR&gt;out of the way as the cones sweeps=\r\n \n  through. At high enough levels&lt;BR&gt;sound can do actual physical damage a=\r\nnd not \n  just bust ear drums and&lt;BR&gt;over load audio circuits.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As th=\r\ne roar dies \n  down, the damage that is done is incredible and&lt;BR&gt;TUSCON&#39;s =\r\nenergy cells are \n  slowly trying to recharge themselves from&lt;BR&gt;such a hig=\r\nh energy output (OOC: \n  He has to catch his breath). Across&lt;BR&gt;the sensors=\r\n there is no evidence of \n  anyone being affected beyond the&lt;BR&gt;dead dinosa=\r\nurs and the movement of \n  TUSCON&#39;s allies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As far as anyone could t=\r\nell either their enemy was out \n  of range of&lt;BR&gt;TUSCON&#39;s roar or was prote=\r\ncted by them in some \n  manner.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;That was interesting.&quot; SKY SHADOW s=\r\naid from his position next \n  to&lt;BR&gt;HYDRAS as he shrugged his shoulders.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;And loud!&quot; INJECTOR said as \n  he buzzed near by. He was in beast mod=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;looking like a strange cross of \n  lionfish and hornet.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;CYCLONU=\r\nS and RODIMUS continued up towards the path \n  of devastation left&lt;BR&gt;by th=\r\ne dinosaurs, RODIMUS weaving between the bodies in \n  vehicle mode&lt;BR&gt;while=\r\n CYCLONUS just flew above them as a \n  jet.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(TAG)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Preston&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: =\r\nwhite; CLEAR: both&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0010_01CC583D.0E966B50--\r\n\n"}}
