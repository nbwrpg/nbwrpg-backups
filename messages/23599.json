She grabbed one of Windlords guns and peeked over his \nshoulder from the position he was carrying her, wincing with pain.\n\nShe quickly fired four shots, countering the shots that were headed \ntheir way, and exploding them in mid air. She then sent two shots of \nher own back at the bots. She winced again and struggled to stay \nawake, as she could feel her vision swimming again.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; ::Windlord::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Correction...
