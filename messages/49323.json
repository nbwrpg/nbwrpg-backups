(note the \n&gt; capitalization) I was using the word &#39;matrix&#39; as an\n&gt; adjective to \n&gt; describe what the cube looks like. I&#39;m not sure that\n&gt; it would be \n&gt; best to give it a side, like the Matrix, or the Pit,\n&gt; or the Inferno \n&gt; or whatever. It should just be pure energy or\n&gt; something like that in \n&gt; my opinion. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: SS would be the most motivated to destroy it,\n&gt; &gt; because he serves the Inferno and wouldn&#39;t be able\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; use it so all it could do would be to stop him. \n&gt; By\n&gt; &gt; the way can we call it anything ACCEPT the Matrix,\n&gt; &gt; because after seeing the movie I don&#39;t believe\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; was the actual Matrix,  I go along with the Matrix\n&gt; &gt; being the all spark, and that device simply being\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; link to the part of the that held the Autobot&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; leaders&#39; energy rather than the actual Matrix\n&gt; itself\n&gt; &gt; (it helps link G1 and BM together and I love BM,\n&gt; also\n&gt; &gt; most people say that that being the Matrix creates\n&gt; no\n&gt; &gt; problems with BW, but from my vague understanding\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; G1 that was only suppose to be the leaders in the\n&gt; &gt; Matrix, and Dinobot wasn&#39;t a leader, but Optimus\n&gt; &gt; Primal said &quot;May his spark join the Matrix....the\n&gt; &gt; greatest of Cybertron).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- x_rauq_x &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ooC: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Are there any Maximals present at the this\n&gt; battle?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; May I suggest that Switchblade brings it\n&gt; outside,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and accidentally \n&gt; &gt; &gt; triggers an effect which creats a laser beam\n&gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; targets Tyrael, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but hits Megatron as well since he and Tyrael\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fighting.
