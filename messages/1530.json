He fell back from the log he\n&gt; was resting on. He landed on his side, trying to grip his leg. He rolled\nand\n&gt; screamed from the pain. He reached for his upper leg.\n&gt;\n&gt; He managed to look at it. It looked worse than it had before. Now it had\n&gt; several singe and dent marks on his upper silvery leg, rather than just\nthe\n&gt; open slice on it.\n&gt;\n&gt; The grunted and squealed, looking out at his comrades. &quot;Run!&quot; he said,\n&gt; almost barely thinking. &quot;Run, we gotta get outta here!&quot; He hoped someone\n&gt; would come to him and get him out of this mess.\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; How has eGroups changed your life?\n&gt; Share your story with us at:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3934/10/_/_/_/958351624/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
