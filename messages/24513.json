I\naccept that not every attack I make will turn out the way I want. you should\ntoo.\n\nAs for the plasma blast if your character has time to raise a weapon then\nwhy can&#39;t mine have time to knock it away?\n\nBIC Lunarpine held his claws to the side to keep Serpentor from using them\nwith as much effect. He threw a front kick at Serpentors chest trying to\npush him back. The wolfbot realised his mistake when a sudden stabbing pain\nwent through his right leg from the thigh down. He winced in pain from the\nslash. (Results of the pain will depend on whether or not the kick\nconnects.)\n\n?  I did!  The energy ball only\n&gt; touched his (Ares) foot and he shot off four bolts at Ice&#39;s chest is what\nI\n&gt; responded with as well.\n\nI went back through the posts and couldn&#39;t find your response. Don&#39;t worry\nabout sending it to me, I&#39;ll use this one.\n\nIce was hit hard by the first two bolts. The first in her right shoulder,\n(Since she&#39;s coming at you in Polar bear mode she&#39;d be on all fours.)\nknocking her into a backwards roll. The second hit her in the upper right\nside of the chest completing her roll. the next two flew over her as she lay\nflat on her back. With her left paw she wiped her wounds revealing theat\nshe&#39;d started bleeding. Ice hoped that her internal repair systems would\nwork the same in this form as it had in her former. She tried to focus her\ntelepathy on Ares to try and read her next move. The pain made it difficult\nbut she knew that she had to. &quot;What would Lunarpine think if he saw me\nlaying here like some old drone?&quot; she thought. That one thought gave her the\nstrength to arise. She got to her feet facing her opponent.\n\nShe read that Ares had turned his attention to missles heading toward\nsixshot. She focused her thoughts and launched three more negative energy\ncharges at him.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, December 23, 2000 10:17 AM\nSubject: Destruction CF (OOC to Gigan and Cyberwolf)\n\n\n&gt; (Trike, the latest post I have from you attacking you is the 21st, and I\n&gt; responded to that.  Though, I don&#39;t receive all e-mails, because eGroups\nkind\n&gt; of sucks, and it has happened before.\n&gt;\n&gt; Luna, side is obviously where ribs would be, not the thigh.  And it makes\na\n&gt; difference by the way.  If I hit you in the thigh, wow.  Hit you in the\nside,\n&gt; it hurts more and does more damage.  And I never said it would take you\ndown,\n&gt; I&#39;d be surprised it if took you down!  It&#39;s just you did something stupid\nby\n&gt; charge like an idiot, and I took advantage of it.  I&#39;m not whining, I&#39;m\n&gt; telling you.  Post for the correct damage.  I&#39;m getting tired of all the\n&gt; idiots out there that don&#39;t do that. By the way Serpentor shot the plasma\n&gt; launcher off at Luna&#39;s chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why haven&#39;t I responded to Ice&#39;s attack?  I did!
