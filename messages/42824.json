Pleased \nwith her work, she called a few maintenance drones to help her put \nthe usable parts away in the repair bay.  \nShe walked with the drones and monitored them as they put the parts \naway for future use. Well, parts were parts and wires were wires, she \nreasoned. It was all useable and in fairly good condition. She had \nthe rest of the bots tossed into the recycling bin for scrap. \nShe smiled and looked around the repair bay. &quot;Not bad for a mouse who \ncame back.&quot; she said quitely to herself.\n\nWHile looking around the bay, she thought about going outside for a \nwalk. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s not a bad idea,&quot; she said to herself.\nShe opened the bay door to the outside and looked out. A breath of \nfresh air won&#39;t hurt the old exchangers any, she thought.  So she \nwalked outside and enjoyed the ability to scurry around again. \nShe had to jump down from the entrance plank to the ground below.  \nShe jumped, landed, rolled and then got up. Dusting herself off, she \nsmiled. &quot;Yeah, still got the touch.&quot; She transformed into mouse mode \nand went for a leasurely stroll around the ship. \n\nThe maximal signature chip inside her had moved around when she \nlanded on the ground. It moved and sat next to a small circuit board. \nA small arc of electricity came up and hit the chip. It activated. So \nnow, her body showed up as a predacon and maximal signature. Only she \ndidn&#39;t know it. Nor did she see the weapons on the ship take aim at \nher new maximal signature.  The security system armed itself and \nprepared to fire on her. \n\n\n"}}
