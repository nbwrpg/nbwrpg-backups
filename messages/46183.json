Fun!\n&gt; \n&gt; IC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Above the island know as the &quot;Alliance Island&quot; a massive shadow \nfalls \n&gt; over the dormant base as the infecticon warship &quot;The Oblivon&quot; now \n&gt; hovers overhead. Quickly within a barrage of firepower from its \nlaser \n&gt; batteries, and hyper mega particle cannons, the ship blasts away \ntwo \n&gt; of the large laser turrets on the island as well as the manual \n&gt; artillary. Inside of the warship the mysterious Infecticons sits i \na \n&gt; command chair as the rest of the Infecticons sit at their \nrespective \n&gt; consoles overlooking various read outs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blight: &quot;Any defenses that could have been used against us have \nbeen \n&gt; neutralized.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Frostbite: &quot;The transporter has locked onto the energy signatures \nof \n&gt; the people of this island.

There is \n&gt; however an unknown robot, scanners indicate he is not in what the \n&gt; cybertronians call stasis lock. He appears to be unconscious.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;Once we begin preparations for the &#39;purge&#39; I want you to \nbring \n&gt; him aboard. We will see what we can do to get him up and about and \nto \n&gt; answer questions as to what went on here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hooligan nods before he turns back to his console.\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;Demonite, Diablos, I want you to to head the salvaging. I \nwant \n&gt; you to strip this base of anything that could be of use to anyone. \nAs \n&gt; soon as this base is picked clean by us it will be wiped off the \nface \n&gt; of the planet.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The mysterious infecticon cackles as some white beams fly down from \n&gt; the infecticon ship to transport the &quot;frozen&quot; bodies of the \nalliance \n&gt; members...\n\n\n"}}
