I am sorry, but I have\n&gt; to at least try. Besides, these are tranquilizer darts, not regular\n&gt; ammo.  Therefore, the bot who I shoot at will not die.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk transforms to Hawk mode and flies over to Squizzy. &quot;Hold\n&gt; on little\n&gt; &gt; one, sit back and watch the fight you&#39;ll learn a lot more that way\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re less likely to be shot.&quot; Lady Hawk saw great potential in\n&gt; this bot\n&gt; &gt; for some odd reason she wanted to keep Squizzy around. She saw\n&gt; nothing for\n&gt; &gt; the Alliance but destruction and knew that there was no way she&#39;d\n&gt; let her\n&gt; &gt; fathers dream be distorted by the likes of them. She had the\n&gt; printouts from\n&gt; &gt; the CR chambers, and her father had the skill to recreate the DNA\n&gt; patterns\n&gt; &gt; he needed. There wasn&#39;t a reason to stay other than to watch the\n&gt; fight. It\n&gt; &gt; was the perfect chance to escape, unfortunately Squizzy knew to\n&gt; much about\n&gt; &gt; her experiments to be left behind. She couldn&#39;t leave the mongoose\n&gt; behind\n&gt; &gt; while it was still functioning. something had to be done soon and\n&gt; she had to\n&gt; &gt; decide what it was.\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, November 03, 2000 4:22 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Defending the Allience\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Squizzy&gt; Starts firing heavy duty tranquilizer darts randomly at\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; attacking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bots who were close to the base.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
