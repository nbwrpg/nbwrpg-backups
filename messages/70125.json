We had a little \n&gt;&gt; glitch in our battle plans... Tucson Prime told us ta stay outside the \n&gt;&gt; fortress, and we did, and when he went inside with Kup ta try&#39;n get \n&gt;&gt; Nightshift out, he got captured, again. But this time I think he wanted \n&gt;&gt; ta get captured.. Some sorta new strategy he&#39;s tryn&#39; out. As for us... \n&gt;&gt; I - dunno but Quickstride&#39;s got that look in his eyes.. He&#39;s itchn&#39; for a \n&gt;&gt; fight. Normally I would just stay out of it, but, ya know somethn&#39;, I&#39;m \n&gt;&gt; itchn&#39; for some payback too. Wheels is in there and he&#39;s givn&#39; it his \n&gt;&gt; all! The least we can do is return the favor and do our part out here. \n&gt;&gt; We&#39;ll keep the com link open sir, so that way ya know we&#39;re still with \n&gt;&gt; ya....\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;WHAT???&quot; Elder said, surprise making the word louder than he had\n&gt; intended, &quot;They&#39;re all captured?&quot; He said as he stood up and leaned\n&gt; over on the control panel in front of him. &quot;FRAG!&quot; he said as he\n&gt; closed his optics and rubbed his head in frustration.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was about at that time that little Elita came in the room . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; eliat Woke up and walked towards command room, she still had her teddy \n&gt;&gt; bear in her arms, then she came in and saw Lord elder\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Lord elder, where is my uncle?&quot;said worried the girl\n&gt;\n&gt; Elder turned to look at Elita as he sat down, attempting to push the\n&gt; fear and panic out of his voice and expression.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;He . . . He is on a mission Elita.&quot; Elder said as he hoped that the\n&gt; smile he plastered on his face would look convincing enough.\n&gt;\n&gt; As he talked  Elder pushed the mute button so that Elita couldn&#39;t hear\n&gt; the plan that Rat Trap and Quickstride were attempting.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I hope . . . I mean . . . I&#39;m sure he will be home soon.&quot; Elder said\n&gt; as he walked over to the young Autobot, &quot;Did you need help getting\n&gt; back to sleep?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
