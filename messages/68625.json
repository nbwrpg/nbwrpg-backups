Slight sparks flew as his arm bent and fles and then\nresisted! It locked into place as he spun in place. \n\nA slow smile appeared on Myrmidon&#39;s face as Malice attempted to drive\nhome the katana. At first it seemed as if it would be a death-lock\nshot, but at the last nano Myrmidon caught the blade on his forearm,\nthe blade skitting and flashing on his armor as it cuts deep . . . and\nis deflected. \n\nBut at the same time Myrmidon&#39;s shoulder mounted cannons reoriented\nthemselves on Malice as the reconfigured thier ordinance. They click as\nthey slide into place and blast with twin armor piercing rounds!\n\nMyrmidon&#39;s smile broadens!\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
