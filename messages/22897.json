And he still \nhadn�t lost the touch.\nDinobot simply stood there with his head turned towards Tavatron, his \nexpressions blank and the same as any other time that he simply expected \nsomething which he knew that he was going to get�whether they like it or \nnot.\nIt wasn�t difficult to see hat there was a lot bothering Tavatron, and in a \nsense he wished that he could have just kept his mouth shut and woken up \nwith a blank mind. But he hadn�t, and he had offended her with words he knew \nthat he meant but not in the way that she had received them.\nAll he head meant to do was express that he was disappointed in her and that \nrunning away from problems never solved anything. They would always be there \nuntil one simply stopped and dealt with them. You could never just leave \nthem behind. And for those who had managed to do that, those problems were \nalways there when they came back.\nAnd they always came back.\n\nDinobot shifted his weight from one clawed foot to the other, feeling his \nmuscles whine and grind. Still recovering from being immobile for so long. \nReminding him of what had happened before he had gone into stasis lock, a \ngrowl trickling from his throat.\nHe had tried for as long as he could to keep himself from slipping into it \nbefore, and all he could figure was as soon as he began to relax, seeing the \nCR room only a little distance away, he had let down his guard and went into \nstasis.\nLater waking up heaving on tubes which had been jammed down his throat!\nNow Dinobot kept it in mind not to be so careless again, letting his wounds \nget that bad again. He swallowed.\nHe could still feel the rawness of his throat after he ripped those tubes \nout!\nLooking down at Tavatron as she crossed her arms and sat at the edge of the \ncliff, he turned his mind back inwards and towards what really mattered. \nJust why he was there and what he was waiting for.\nBut Dinobot had watched Tavatrons ears perk up at his apology, just hoping \nthat she wouldn�t rub it in and ask just why he had done it.\nHe had his own reasons, and making sure that he didn�t lose the first real \nfriend he had.\nFellow warriors were one thing, but good friends were another�or so he had \nhoped.\nDinobot almost found himself cringing as Tavatron opened her mouth to speak, \nexpecting some other hard thing that he would have to do just in order to \nkeep one step in front of this femm. Though, relaxing as he heard what she \nreally was going to say, finding it that he really didn�t have a reaction to \nher words other then turning his gaze back over the edge of the cliff with \nthe same old blank look.\nBut he still thought that he was getting soft.\nDinobot�s head snapped towards Tavatron again as she flopped down onto her \nback, simply slowing his breath until it stopped as the cloud of dust rose \nup from the impact. Resuming his breath intake as the dust cleared away.\nHe was still recovering; dust in his lungs was one of the last things he \nneeded.\n\n\nDinobot only looked down at Tavatron for a moment before looking back over \nthe fast expanse of tree tops which was laid out before him below the cliff, \nhis tail moving in smooth motions, back and forth behind him.\nHe had to admit something even though this atmosphere was mainly dead quiet, \nas well as unsteady. This was a rather nice spot. Wondering slightly if \nTavatron came here often to escape the worries and cares of life.\nBut soon, even the carefree ease of the reason he was there drifted into old \nhabits. Finding himself surveying the area for any unusual movements of tell \ntail signs that there were bots about.\nTwo bots along was no patch for a group of highly trained Alliance or \nPredacon factions�if they had such members. Besides, he was still recovering \nand even HE knew that now he wouldn�t even be able to stand up to Tavatron, \nwaiting for his components to settle back into the new settings of his \nrepaired body.\nDinobot rolled his shoulders a bit, finding that they were a bit sore but \nmuch more smooth in their motion then when he had first moved out to follow \nTavatron�when he had to concentrate on each step�basically.\nHis attention was then caught as Tavatron began to speak again, looking down \nat her in surprise and a little annoyance as she finished asking her \nquestion.\nAs if apologizing wasn�t hard enough!\n\nDinobot growled, his first response to Tavatron question before the same \ncawing which had drawn her attention had also drawn his. Almost seeing \nsomething burning, almost like a commit but too big to be a stasis pod, but \nit was lost in the flurry of feathers, and by the times the birds had \nthinned it was gone.\nThere were times he cursed the seeming nature of this planet, with it�s \nstorms when he was cold, it�s excessive heat when his systems were nearly \nmelting from overheating, and it�s wildlife when he was trying to see!\nBut he then turned his attention back towards Tavatron, looking down for a \nmoment before lowering his head so that by the time he brought it to a hult \nit was less then 2 inches away from her own snout. Simply looking straight \ndown at her, letting out a breath and thinking quickly.**\n\n� If it is the truth you are seeking, with which no doubt I am sure you are, \nthen you may have it as well.�\n\n** Dinobot then lifted his head a bit so that there was a fair distance \nbetween snouts, his sides aching with fatigue from the amount of energy it \nhad taken him to get to the cliff�and Tavatron.\nGiving him a moment to calculate the truth and see just what he was going to \nsay. Because, while through his lifetime, he had learned that woman will not \njust accept one answer, it has to be educated and very well presented.\nAnd through his life�he had had to learn that the hard way!\nAlso, honesty may not give a woman what answer she wishes, but at least a \nman cannot get bitched at for a fib as well as what he had done to get \nhimself into the position where the woman is questioning him.\nHowever, in this case, Dinobot was not the one in question and had done \nnothing wrong. In fact, the roles had reversed and it was the female who was \nfeeling the weight instead.\nAnd there was still his answer to give.\n\nDinobot moved his front claws so that both hands were on each side of \nTavatron�s head, taking most of his weight off of his legs and easing the \nache.\nHis eyes still directed at her, his voice a bit of a growl.**\n\n� My friends have a tendency to die after a certain amount of time. And the \nreason I followed you was not only to know why you left when the position of \nguardian was passed on to you, but also to make sure that you remained safe \nand quite alive.�\n\n** Dinobot then looked at Tavatron harder, his expression solidifying to one \nof complete non-emotion.**\n\n� You are my friend, Tavatron. And one I intend to keep.�\n\n** There, there was his answer. It may seem mushy or so on, but it was the \ntruth.\nBut then Dinobot lifted up his torso so that he was standing at full height, \nhis weight on his legs again but still looking down at Tavatron..**\n\n� But the request to return to base has come through, and to comply might be \nwise.�\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
