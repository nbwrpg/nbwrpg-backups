He turns \naround to look at Scattershot and Punch. &quot;Why are you two here?&quot;\n\n&quot;We were sent to relieve you guys. There&#39;s something up outside that needed \nyour attention,&quot; Punch replies, Scattershot nodding like an idiot, \nDeathStorm&#39;s head nearly falling off of his.\n\nDark One nods. &quot;Very well, we&#39;ll go then. Don&#39;t let these two escape.&quot;\n\nDark One walks out, motioning for the other Oblitercons to follow him. Hiss \nkicks Iron Raptor&#39;s body a few times before turning to follow Dark One, the \nother Oblitercons doing the same (following Dark One, not kicking Iron \nRaptor).\n\nPunch turns back to the prisoners.\n\n&quot;Defences,&quot; he says simply, several autoguns dropping out of the cealing at \nthat command.\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; he says, looking at Tavatron, &quot;Back into that corner,&quot; Punch \nwaves his gun at the apropriate corner, &quot;VERY slowly. Any sudden moves from \neither of you and the autoguns open fire. Scattershot, drag the other one to \nthe other corner.&quot;\n\nScattershot nods, dragging Iron Raptor off toward the other corner.\n\n"}}
