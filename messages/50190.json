He small ship crashed into the planet&#39;s surface \nand slid fifty feet. When the dust settled, the ship&#39;s top opened. A \ntransformer walked out. He had no beast mode. A lone black wolf walked \nup to him, the robot grabbed it by the nap of it&#39;s neck and looked it \nover, &quot;A suitable beast mode,&quot; He said. He pulled a needle from a \nsmall pack in his ship and stuck the wolf. He then dropped the wolf \nwho ran away, obviously terrified. Vampirtron opened his chest and \nscrewed the vial of blood into his systems. It was gone in a second. \nVampitron unscrewed the vial and tossed it to the ground. He took two \nsteps from his ship and underwent the changes.\n&gt; \n&gt;      An hour later he awoke, in beast mode. He transformed back to \nrobot mode, and opened a comm. Unfortunatly it only could reach about \none hundred miles, so he may not meet anyone. He sent out this \nmessage.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Hello to any transformers out there,&quot; He said into the comm, \nvery calmly. &quot;My name is Vampirtron, I have crashed onto this planet \nand I request assistance from the nearest base. In return for help I \nwill give you my ship.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;      He found a big rock and sat down on it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: He&#39;s in the Rocky Mountians just to let you know.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
