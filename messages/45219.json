I\n&gt; &gt; dont really care what \n&gt; &gt; you think of me. As far as im concerned your opinion\n&gt; &gt; of me does not matter. \n&gt; &gt; Although I do find that your comment about\n&gt; &gt; &quot;denominating&quot; me offensive as \n&gt; &gt; Hugar did not even bring up my name nor has anyolne\n&gt; &gt; else. It is actions like \n&gt; &gt; that that make me dislike you, when you go outright\n&gt; &gt; slandering someone \n&gt; &gt; without any provocation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Find a job, post your resume.\n&gt; http://careers.yahoo.com\n&gt; \n\n\n=====\ncybers will rule\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!\nhttp://greetings.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
