He too had nev=\r\ner attempted a power \n&gt; link.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Truthfully Rodimus, I really don&#39;t kno=\r\nw if I&#39;m capable of it.  It&#39;s just \n&gt; something Straight Shot brought up to=\r\n me...  If anyone knows about \n&gt; Powerlinking, maybe she does.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straig=\r\nht Shot looks to them and takes a seat.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re right, I really shoul=\r\nd explain it better to you guys.  I read up on \n&gt; it somewhere in some old =\r\nCybertronian Archives, when Tucson and I were just \n&gt; average Autobots.  It=\r\n was our favorite past time, ta do research, and look \n&gt; up ancient records=\r\n and artifacts.  Well, in one of those articles, I found \n&gt; something about=\r\n powerlinking.  And what I read, it stated that because \n&gt; Autobots are so =\r\nwell in tuned with each other, and that their bond of unity \n&gt; is unbroken =\r\nby anyone, it&#39;s their faith in each other, that gives them the \n&gt; power to =\r\ntransform and form an even stronger bond with each other.. The bond \n&gt; of m=\r\nerger.  That means two of you guys, comming together to form one \n&gt; formida=\r\nble warrior.  And I don&#39;t think you guys need a rebuild.  You need a \n&gt; spi=\r\nritual faith in each other, a bond that no one can break, and I know that \n=\r\n&gt; when Tucson went looking for you Rodimus, he went looking for you with al=\r\nl \n&gt; his heart.  The power to do the extraordinary, lies within your heart.=\r\n  I \n&gt; know you have it, you just have to believe in yourself, listen to yo=\r\nur \n&gt; heart, and have faith in those who have faith in you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson no=\r\ndds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I wouldn&#39;t have gone that far if I didn&#39;t think I had faith in =\r\nyou, \n&gt; Rodimus.  My faith in you was renewed the day you fought off that e=\r\nvil hold \n&gt; Hydras had on you.  When you could have reverted back to your e=\r\nvil self, you \n&gt; advised me to leave before I was destroyed in the rubble. =\r\n That took \n&gt; courage, and compassion.  The kind of compassion no power can=\r\n break.  Not \n&gt; even Hydras himself.  You have that power Rodimus, believe =\r\nin it, and it \n&gt; will allow you to do extraordinary things.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap =\r\nwalks over to Rodimus in rat mode, with a smile on his face, and \n&gt; ears st=\r\nraight up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You can do this Rodimus, you got what it takes, no rebuild=\r\ns necesary, you \n&gt; got it in you and now it&#39;s time ta shine.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson t=\r\nhen turns to Lord Elder and the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Knowing Hydra&#39;s weaknesses w=\r\nill be a great asset.  Yes, send Cheetor out \n&gt; to see what kind of intel h=\r\ne can gather for us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns back to Straight Shot.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So, how wo=\r\nuld one go about initilazing the powerlink?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot looks up.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;Okay, so, this is how it works.  You state your name, and verbally giv=\r\ne \n&gt; yourself the command to transform.  If Rodimus were ta try it, he&#39;d do=\r\n the \n&gt; same.  That will initialize a transformation of both your physcial =\r\nbodies, \n&gt; but not into vehicle form.  Then both of you at the same time, s=\r\ntate \n&gt; &quot;POWERLINK!&quot;  and depending on which order you chose, in this case,=\r\n it would \n&gt; be better if Rodimus were your eyes, so he&#39;d complete the phas=\r\ne, by stating, \n&gt; POWERLINK, RODIMUS PRIME!&quot;  Annnd bingo!  Two bots, form =\r\none formidable \n&gt; warrior.  You combine power, wisdom and agilitiy.  And Ro=\r\ndimus would be your \n&gt; eyes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap looks to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wow, and yo=\r\nu read this from an old intel file somewhere...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yep,=\r\n that&#39;s right. And according to Cybertronian lore, only the Autobots \n&gt; are=\r\n capable of doing the powerlink.  Not the Decepticons or the predacons. \n&gt; =\r\nI wonder if this holds true for the Maximals as well.. Imagine, if you guys=\r\n \n&gt; could merge into one formidable warrior.. Anyway, right now, it&#39;s more =\r\n\n&gt; important that we fight fire with fire.  But it&#39;s like Tucson says.  We =\r\n\n&gt; can&#39;t force anyone into anything they don&#39;t feel comfortable doing.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson turns his head toward Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;I - I have never tried that...
