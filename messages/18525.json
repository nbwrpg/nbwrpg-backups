I \nthought the breaking of the groups was common knowledge.  Well, let \nme explain then.  A long time ago, there were only a few groups \nhere.  The Predacons were in three main groups, The Allience that was \nunder a bot named Zardus.  The predacons under Hell Beast and the \nPredacons under Megatron&#39;s rule.   Hell Beast was sent back to \nCybertron.  Megatron deserted his group.  I was in Megatron&#39;s group.  \nHe left us to die and I took over.  Black Aracnia was originally \nunder Megatron (correct me on that if I&#39;m wrong)  and left as well.  \nAfter Hell Beast left, his groups spit up, becoming the Destrons and \nsuch.  Or they joined the Allience.  The Allience is a strong group. \nbut mine is growing and becoming stronger.  If Black Aracnia and I \njoin up, we may convince others to join.  Then we can finally work to \nour common goals.  First off, revenge. Then, the maximals.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Cyber Claw:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyber Claw glanced down at KitKat, trying to figure all of this \n&gt; out. &quot;The Predacons split up?
