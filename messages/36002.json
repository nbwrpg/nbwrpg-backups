He noticed the second shot but didn&#39;t have\ntime to move as it collided with him sending him rolling back from the\nimpact. He reached up to feal his shoulder quickly learning that a gaping\nhole was now where his plating had been. He tried to move his arm, pain\nshooting through every servo in his body. His hand opened dropping his disk\nlauncher to the ground. He opened a link to the others, &quot;The preys biting\nback.&quot; He shouts trying to hold back his pain. &quot;Do we really need the\nsupplies this badly?&quot; The Cybrats had normally taken whatever they needed\nbut now what Dogged needed was a medic.\n\nDogged fealt a mysterious wave of virtigo come over him. He thought that the\ninjuries were causing his mental state. He glanced in the direction of\nRepugnus and quickly realized that it was the Monsterbot who was causing his\nproblems. He tried to recover his launcher when pain shit through his\ninjured arm. The smallest of the Cybrats was nothing more than a useless\ntarget. In his condition ther was no way he&#39;d be of any use to his team.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, May 29, 2001 4:54 PM\nSubject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n\n\n&gt; Just a reminder: this is all taking place in an underground tunnel.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::::\n&gt;\n&gt; The bot ducks quickly, a laser passing overhead. He straightens and slams\nhis fist into the piece of metal heading for him, knocking it aside.\nReaching behind him, he takes out a very large, mean-looking rifle, aiming\nit at Dogged. He pulls the trigger once, nearly stumbling back from the\nrecoil. The shot misses, sailing past Dogged and smashing into the roof of\nthe tunnel. A large explosion caves that section in, and the bot fires\nagain, this time right on target, the explosive round heading for Dogged\nvery quickly.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Dogged  . transforms to four treaded\n&gt; &gt; terrain vehicle about the size of a snowmobile.\n&gt; &gt; Speeding through the flames, the heat warping the paint and singing the\n&gt; &gt; metal beneath. he remained focused on the bum.

He\n&gt; &gt; tried to adjust his optics to compensate but it was no use. he flew\nbackward\n&gt; &gt; slowly until he could feal the building behind him. he dug his feet into\nthe\n&gt; &gt; side hopeing that the effect would wear off shortly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: Jordan Guthrie &lt;gunthers8@n...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, May 28, 2001 9:54 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Repugnus/Slag/JetV::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Repugnus continues running at Switchblade while emitting color waves\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disrupt the bots optic sensors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Slag::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Slag spits another wave of fire towards Dogged.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::JetV::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JetV arrives at the battle scene some bit away.
