WHAT I DID WAS A OFFICIAL AND I TALKED TO YANSHOSH ABOUT AND HE AGREES \nWITH ME. WHAT I DID WAS FINAL. WHAT YOU SAID MAKES YOU NO BETTER THAN EVEN \nBIOSTINGER!!!\n\nRampage: What i have done is final. I have full over certain function of the \nbase that are to insure its safety from the corruption that Black Arachnia \nwill put on it. I designed a major function of this base and i have a right \nto do this. For now the computer system is protected by a self destruct \nmechanism that will activate if any of these functions are breached.
