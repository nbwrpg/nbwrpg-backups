The problem is that with what I \nconcider the major rules to remember it&#39;s hard to remember the minor \nones like posting when you leave. On another rpg I wrote for my first \nentree that I had barely survived 2 years on the planet Nagas. By the \nway I&#39;ll go read over them,but I&#39;m pretty sure there are no rule \nagainst naming other players characters, naming a new element(I&#39;ll do \nthat later), or declaring that the moon is really a giant robot that \nI may later use as a base(I just want to know if you can list it on \nthe map).\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; I was only giving my opinion... council decides stuff not me.
