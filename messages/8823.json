Now what to do with \nit, she thought.  She wondered if hooking it up to a CR chamber would \ndo the trick.  She knew the CR restored the body and the DNA of a \nbot&#39;s aminal side.  She wondered if it could change a bot&#39;s form as \nwell if the scanner was hooked up to it correctly.  She took the \nscanner and was about to walk out of the bay when the idea struck \nher. &quot;Where am I going to find a wolf to scan?&quot; She looked at the \nscanner and sighed.  The only wolf around that she knew of was \nLunarpine.  &quot;Well, so much for suprizing him.  I will need his help \nanyway in order to get this to work anyway.&quot;  She carried the scanner \nwith her and walked back into the engine room.  She walked around the \nbend and still saw Lunarpine laying there.\n\n&quot;Um, I hate to bother you like this, but I need your help on a big \nproject.  Would you be willing to help me?&quot; She smiled. If this \nworked, she would be a wolf and he would be happier with life.  At \nleast, that was her plan.\n\n\n"}}
