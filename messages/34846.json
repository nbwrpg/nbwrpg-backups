Ironhide turns his head to his side, and looks down, to see\nthe centre of the disturbance. One very large Autobot had already\nsmashed his desk, and was standing at his full height, very upset.\nIronhide knew he was in for trouble, &quot;Is there a problem Grimlock?&quot; He\nasked, knowing there is. &quot;YES THERE PROBLEM&quot; Grimlock yelled, his voice\nechoing very clearly throughout all of Iocon. &quot;THIS BULLSHIT. YOU SEND\nROOKIES TO FIGHT IN WAR THAT AFFECT WHOLE GALAXY, EVEN WHOLE TIME. YOU\nSEND A PACIFIST!!&quot; he declared in rage, as he pointed a finger at\nPacifix. He pulled out his energon sword, and in one swipe, cleaved his\nwhole rows podium straight in half. Grimlock stopped and looked up at\nthe main council, his sword at his side, energy shimmering off it.\n\nIronhide sighed, how did he get a weapon in this room. This wasnt the\nfirst time this happened. &quot;Grimlock, you know that if one of us goes the\nPredacons will be on to us,&quot; He said calmly. &quot;None of us can go&quot;.\n\nGrimlock looked back up, then crossed his arms, his sword just above his\nhead, still shimmering, the energy intesifing the look of rage in his\ncrimson eyes. &quot;Then I go to earth to&quot; he said quietly, and he was almost\nnot heard with the large amount of gasps that escaped around the room.\n\n"}}
