So,... it&#39;s dificult to say... Practically... we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to kidnape her...&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord felt in silence a while and encourage himself and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; continue &quot;I practically suggested Battera (That&#39;s voluntary&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; name) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to sedat her and take her off the base... If that disgust you &lt;BR&gt;I&#39;m &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sorry, sir, but we have to get her withour harm for her and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; us... &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord tried to set in order his ideas and spoke once &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; more &quot;Lately &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking that would be dificult to broke for Battera the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; defences and hide them of scaners while she scape with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight... &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So I was thinking that she has to do the same that Flicker did: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Battera could deceive Nightlight and convince her to left the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacon&#39;s territory and in a point, far of Preds, capture &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight and bring her to base... That lead us to other &lt;BR&gt;point: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; after the capture, what should we do? We can&#39;t let Nightlight &lt;BR&gt;be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; free here and I guess that you don&#39;t like see her inside a &lt;BR&gt;cell, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess that reporgramation might take a lot time if that scum &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; named &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor told the true about that program... That&#39;s all, Sir, &lt;BR&gt;If &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; did something wrong when I suggest Battera sedate Nightlight, &lt;BR&gt;I&#39;m &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sorry... I was thinking in her safely and ours...&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord looked to Rodimus, while Elita was drinking happily &lt;BR&gt;her &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; energon.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus smiled.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Yes, this Elita.
