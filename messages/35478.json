He wonders \nsilently why Grounded shot at Deemos when he was so close.  He spots the \nknives flying at Trinity and he deftly sprints in front of them.  He manages \nto deflect on with his wing but the other imbeds itself in his shoulder.  \n&quot;YOU WILL DIE!!!!!&quot;  His left arm hangs limp from the knife in his shoulder.  \nHe reaches up and yanks it out of his skin.  Mech fluid sprays onto the \nground.  Using only his right arm he flings the knife back at Deemos.  &quot;He is \nmine Grounded.  This is an old battle.  Keep Trinity safe.&quot;  With that said \nhe launches himself at Deemos.  He begins slashing at his head with his \nenergy-bladed staff.\n\n"}}
