There was no\nsense trying to hide anything from her. He knew that her telepathic powers\nweren&#39;t in her control. &quot;We have to find a way to control this. Right now\nshe&#39;s on the verge of either insanity or corruption.&quot; He feared for her if\nshe ever deciced to use this power improperly. &quot;I&#39;ll work with her but\nyou&#39;ll have to help too.&quot; He turned back to Ice. &quot;Rest for now young one,\nyou have alot of hard work ahead of you.&quot;\n\nLunarpine watched as Ice fell asleep. He could still hear her voice rambling\non in a tired, half asleep dilogue. He moved closer to her and placed a hand\non her head. &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid Wing. I didn&#39;t risk spark and limb to save you\njust to see you brought down by a flu bug, we&#39;ll get you through this I\npromise.&quot; He started out the door but felt the urge to stop. He turned back\nas if to say something. &quot;Just wait till our next match, we&#39;ll see just what\nyour new form can do.&quot; He knew ?Veratis could only hear his thoughts if Ice\nbroadcast them to him.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, November 14, 2000 2:49 PM\nSubject: Re: The next evolution of technology.\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She changed into full polar bear. &quot;Well? What do you think?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She heard Veratis thoughts and frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t know what else to\n&gt; do. I didn&#39;t even know I could do that?&quot; She still felt tingly all\n&gt; over.\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked at Lunarpine. She tried to smile, but his thought read\n&gt; much like that of Veratis. She sighed and lowered her head. &quot;Yeah, I\n&gt; know. It&#39;s not good. But what else can I do?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked over to a corner and layed down. She put her massive head\n&gt; on her huge paws and gave a deep sigh. She wasn&#39;t sure what was\n&gt; happening to her or what would happen next. She thought to\n&gt; Veratis. &quot;I have two modes and an inbetween mode. I lost my bot mode\n&gt; entirely. I&#39;m no longer a transformer. I&#39;m a freak of nature now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She was feeling down. She was now bigger than Veratis and Lunarpine.\n&gt; She was now afraid that if she moved the wrong way, she could hurt\n&gt; them. She saw how Veratis jumped when she put her head near him to\n&gt; nuzzle his shoulder.  She couldn&#39;t stay here and have her love fear\n&gt; her or her modes. She sighed and hoped they would find a solution\n&gt; soon.  AS she closed her eyes, she changed into the griffen mode\n&gt; without realizing it. She opened her eyes and stared down the long\n&gt; beak of the owl.  She jumped and looked at herself. Her wings were\n&gt; there on her back and her head was that of the owl. She layed back\n&gt; down and sighed. She was starting to feel depressed. She looked up at\n&gt; Lunarpine. &quot;well, sparring is out.....for good.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She changed back into polar bear as she rested her head back down and\n&gt; started to sleep in the corner. But her mind was still working. She\n&gt; could still hear thier thoughts, even in her sleep. And controlling\n&gt; the projection of her dreams was something she had no control over\n&gt; yet.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
