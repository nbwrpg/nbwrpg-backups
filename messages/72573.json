As\n&gt; Yoketron had taught him, he takes his challenge willingly but with an air of\n&gt; calm.  He knew a clear mind had to be kept if he was going to perform at an\n&gt; optimal level.  After all, Yoketron had worked hard with Tucson, shaping him\n&gt; up to be one of his star pupils.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If it&#39;s all right with you, Big Convoy, I would like to handle the next\n&gt; group of guards.  I wouldn&#39;t want you to drain your energy reserves too\n&gt; quickly.  Oh, nice shot by the way.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBIG CONVOY grunted as he looked back at TUSCON, &quot;So yoou are one of\nthose who enjoy combat.&quot; There was nothing on his face that showed\nwether he respected that or detested it. &quot;Sure, the next ones are\nyours. Show me what you have.&quot;\n\nThey continue running down the hall and stop at a &#39;T&#39; section.\n\nLONG RACK kicks in over an encrypted comlink. &quot;We are in.&quot; He said. &quot;I\nam still trying to figure out this system.&quot;\n\n&quot;You got Rhinox&#39;s location?&quot; CONVOY asked in low tones as he held his\nhand to his face to keep the comlinnk on low.\n\nThere was a pause from LONG RACK, &quot;Just a micro second, dodging security.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
