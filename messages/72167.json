You will all be with me.&quot; he squeezed her hand, &quot;Yes, I\nwant my wife and daughter with me, that is all that matters - even if\nI have to exterminate all the Maximals to do it.&quot;\n\nThere was a Dark and wicked smile from DARK RODIMUS as the lift\ncontinued to move down, further into the base that belonged to\nMAGMATRON and his crew, quite possibly one of the greater enemies of\nthe Maximals.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
