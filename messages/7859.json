If they want to teleport, give them\n&gt; &gt; strict rules to follow. Since teleporting is a shift in the \nfabric of\n&gt; &gt; time and space, there will be a soft audiable sound to let others \nnow\n&gt; &gt; that a shift happened.  But this sound is soft, so a bot may or\n&gt; &gt; maynot hear it depending on the situation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, During a fight, the teleport is an action.  Therefore once a\n&gt; &gt; bot teleports, they must wait for their opponant to respond before\n&gt; &gt; making another move.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And when teleporting, a bot may not teleport more than 50 feet at \na\n&gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; Since people want to be able to teleport try this on and tell me \nwhat\n&gt; &gt; you think))))\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Predacon: Shoots at Maximal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maximal: Teleports behind Predacon before shot hit.(teleport is \none\n&gt; &gt; action)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Predacon:: hears the sound and turns to face the Maximal.\n(reaction to\n&gt; &gt; move) Aims gun and fires at Maximal.(one action)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maximal:: Maximal teleports before shot hits and is now behind the\n&gt; &gt; Predacon again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Predacon:: hears sound, turns and sweeps the legs of the Maximal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maximal:: falls down from leg sweep and draws sword.(reaction to\n&gt; &gt; move) Slashes at Predacon.(one action)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Predacon:: Sword cuts chest plate but not that deep.(reaction to\n&gt; &gt; move) Teleports 35 feet away from Maximal(teleport is one action).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maximal:: Teleports to behind Predacon.(teleport is one action)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is just an example of how this may work if this is allowed \ninto\n&gt; &gt; the rules.  But if one bot gains teleporting capabilities, then\n&gt; &gt; others will have to be able to deside if this is a good thing for\n&gt; &gt; thier characters or not.  his may benefit some characters, but not\n&gt; &gt; others.  This is only my humble suggestion.  I leave it up to the\n&gt; &gt; Council to have the final say on this matter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; AND NOW ON WITH THE RPG!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n------\n&gt; &gt; BTW: Did you buy that new car yet?\n&gt; &gt; If not, check this site out.\n&gt; &gt; They&#39;re called CarsDirect.com and it&#39;s a pretty sweet way to buy \na car.\n&gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6847/13/_/_/_/964207752/\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
