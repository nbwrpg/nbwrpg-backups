Naturally the RPer&#39;s success \nwould be more important than the \nchars.  For winning a battle (like \nSunhawk did) you might get 2 or 3 \npoints, for rping the battle well (like \nSunhawk did) you might get 15 or 16 \npoints, for having your char voted most \nmessed up in the head (Sunhawk will be) \n50 or 60 points.
