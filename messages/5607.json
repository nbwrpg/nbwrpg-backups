She watched Megatron talk to Panzertron.  She \ntook out a pocket scanner and saw only the three bots on the screen.  She \nput the scanner away. She stood there feeling a little out of place.  she \nwasn&#39;t in any kind of command position, yet Megatron had told her to join \nhim on this meeting of his.  She wondered if she would end up being the \nsacrifial lamb as it were.  She just kept her eyes on Megatron and \nPanzertron.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
