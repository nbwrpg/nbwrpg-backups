He sighed in annoyance but kept his eyes closed, being awake but resting one�s body was a great way to build up energy.\nHe heard and felt the she-wolf yawn. The tensing in her muscles against his back telling him of the action. The groan from her almost seemed to sound as if she was not yet ready to rise but had done so anyway, rest always being very important to a warrior whom wished to stay in top fighting condition.\nDinobot felt a chill run through his body as Tavatron�s cold nose touched his neck, the chill running from his neck right down to the very tip of his tail. However, he simply stayed in an unmoving state, conserving energy to replace that which was lost repairing his internals. The scent of the fellow warrior became stronger, not knowing why and not being able to distinguish that she had leaned closer. He felt a soft brush against his jaws and was about to snap at the feeling to get it away but then decided not to, getting a mouthful of wolf might not be such a good idea in case it was Tavatron�s fur in which had brushed. Her temper was something that almost matched his own, though his was greater he still did not wish to spike her aggression while he lay in such a vulnerable position.\nDinobot then heard Tavatron lift her head from away from his jaws, the ruffle of her neck fur clearly stating this to him. With the sound of the fembot�s paws suddenly becoming more and more faint he stirred and opened his optics a slit, see her blurred shape travel towards the doors of the Autobot ship. The click of her claws were clearly heard by him, his head against the floor and relaying vibrations and faint sounds to his systems.\nWith sigh he raised his head a few inches from the floor as he noticed Tavatron walk across the bridge and thought to let her know that he was awake, however, she had other things to rend to and he was sure that knowing that he was simply awake not worth knowing.\nHe looked around the room for a few moments before slowly moving to prop his upper half up with his elbows, then having more of an upright view of the entire area.\nThe vent had slowed it�s feed of warm air and by then had quit, no longer producing heat, no longer requiring him near.\nDinobot looked around the room one last time before heaving himself up on to his feet, a little unstable but able to keep upright. Keeping his head a bit bowed to help with stability he moved forward a few steps but then lifted his head when it was clear that he did not need the stability.\nThe base about him seemed it�s usual dark and dingy self, nothing more then the rat-hole it seemed to be.\nHe shook his head; this base almost seemed like some joke now that he thought about it. Its defenses were weak at best and it was now SO damaged that it could barely function!\nDinobot growled as he took a few more steps towards the doors that Tavatron had disappeared through only moments before, hearing missile fire and so on beyond them.\nIt was a comforting feeling, battle.\n The thought of engaging in battle was such a pleasant thought to him, to take up a deadly weapon and use it. To strain every muscle and gear in order to try and kill one bot before they killed you. Strange to others but comforting to him. Never having anything like the open arms of a loved one or a smile to turn to when he was young battle was the only thing that he COULD turn to, the damage and pain all being part of what he had to embrace.\nDinobot stopped when he suddenly felt his leg seize, then leaning his weight onto the one leg to take the pressure of the other until the pain would go away.\nIt bothered him, then knowing that he was STILL in no condition to battle. Then a strange thought entered his mind: If he ran into battle the way he was now when Tavatron was here she would probably be ready to kill him! The thought causing a small smile to appear on his jaws for a moment but then fade. Then another thought streaking across his mind: Why was it he always felt more alone then ever when she was not near? Just like the question of why he felt comfort when he was around her, the answer eluded him. His mind, not yet ready to come to terms with the answer�yet. But there was also another reason of why he never seemed to come up with the answer�it might be something that he was but was not yet ready to cope with. \nStanding in the shadows of the room then he stayed, dealing with things in which he had never dealt with before. Things that went far beyond the simple workings of a warrior.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
