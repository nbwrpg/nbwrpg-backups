I can control her body &#39;cause \nI insolate her spark, in that way that her sense can&#39;t registrate \nwhat&#39;s goin on outside... but every damage that some one do to her \nbody just her will suffer it!!!&quot; \n\n&quot;Why is she so important that you decided to control her?!!&quot; said \nRodimus almost angered and worry.\n\n&quot;&#39;cause I finally decided that it&#39;s time that I personaly take \ncontrol of situation&quot;replied the Vork\n\n&quot;Are you meaning that... you was inside before Unicron&#39;s arrival? \nHow could It be? &quot;\n\n&quot;My masters knew that someone else will arrive to destroy our \nlab...&quot; started to say the vork&quot;so I had the command to find a drone \nand take its body, but I choose one whose spark still was alive but \nslowly was dying, it just was time that I were the owner of its \nbody, so I just waited; time passed and that pod was found for you \nand that doggie bot...&quot;\n\n&quot;WHAT!?&quot; said suprised Rodimus\n\n&quot;SO do you didn&#39;t know that you rescued her pod???? and where you \nbrought her here???&quot;said the Vork almost laughting&quot;you never figured \nthat you found her ???? well well that&#39;s not the subject; After that \nthe wolfbot brought her here and with this IDIOT&#39;s help&quot; she said \nthat words looking to Kenzo &quot;Her spark didn&#39;t vanished... So I \ndecided to wait, wait until I know if would be needed my \nintervention... at first I consider influence her... bur she&#39;s wake, \nwake and afraid to hurt some one even if her live is at risk... hHer \nreaction after destroy that Unicron&#39;s minion confirmed that... SO I \ndecided that it&#39;s time that I do something and took control of her \nand insolate her spark, it was pretty easy: she was emotionaly \nexausted... Now That I&#39;m in control...

She mentioned something\n&gt; about a mission.  That&#39;s when I contacted you and attempted a \nstasis\n&gt; lock on Nightlight.  She blew open the chamber from the inside\n&gt; becoming a danger to herself so I tried to restrain her.  That&#39;s \nwhen\n&gt; the struggle that you saw broke out.&quot;  Kenzo summarized.\n\n\n"}}
