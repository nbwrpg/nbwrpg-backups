Man, a giant robot.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Astral flew up into the air, as did Fenox.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;Oblitertron, I&#39;ve faced gestalts like you before, you \nscum!!!!!\n&gt; We&#39;ll take you down!!!!&quot; Then, Fenox tapped Astral&#39;s shoulder.  He \nturned.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Ah.....Zardus, is it???  Alliance commander???  You think \nyou can\n&gt; beat us????  Well, let me tell you something.  I didn&#39;t come here, \nto fight.\n&gt; I came here, to carry out an experiment.  But if I must fight, \nthen, so help\n&gt; me Matrix, I&#39;ll fight.  As long as I, Admiral of the Lavacons, \nAstral, live,\n&gt; NOBODY IS TAKING ME DOWN!!!!  AND NOT TONIGHT!!!!!!&quot; He said, and \nthen\n&gt; nodded at everybody.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Fenox sent a transmission to the others on the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Ok, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s the only way, team!!!&quot; He said.\n&gt; \n&gt;     They all replied with a positive answer and then, everyone said \nall\n&gt; together, &quot;LAVA AND FIRE UNITE!!!!!!!!!!  BURN!!!!!!  LET THE \nDARKNESS\n&gt; CONTROL THE HEAT!!!!&quot; Then, suddenly, things started happening.\n&gt; \n&gt;        The Lavacons&#39; bodies started changing a bit(ok, a lot).  \nTheir optics\n&gt; went redder, and not just firey red, the normal way, they were \nevillish red.\n&gt; And, all of their bodies changed from burning reds and oranges, to \nevil,\n&gt; evil, blacks and reds.  An evil grin spread across each one&#39;s face, \nbeing\n&gt; shown only by the fire in each one&#39;s mouth.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Astral, or, what was Astral, said, &quot;HHHHAAAHHHHAAAA!!!!!!!\n&gt; MUAHAHA!!!!  Oblitertron.....Oh, stupid Oblitertron!!!!  Stupid\n&gt; Zardus!!!!!!!  AHAH!!!  Now, you&#39;ve caused us to reach one of our \nsuperior\n&gt; forms!!!!!  HAHAHA!!!!!!  Now, we are the Dark Lavacons!!!!!\n&gt; HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HAAAAHAAAHAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!\n&gt; OHHAAAA!!!!!&quot; He laughed, evilishly.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;Come on Dark Lavacons, while we crush these Alliance \nfools, we\n&gt; can have fun at the same time!!!&quot; Astral said, laughing.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Recklessa was even more dangerous now.  She grabbed her \ngatling guns\n&gt; and fired around the area, burning all the trees and stuff down.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Griplash grabbed his sword, and cut through trees, \ndestroying stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Starlight cackled as she shot her crossbow everywhere, making \nthe\n&gt; ground go on fire.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Fenox fired his optic lazers at Zardus, except, being a Dark \nLavacon,\n&gt; Fenox didn&#39;t put any major effort into it, no feel.  Just fired it \nfor the\n&gt; hell of destroying things.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Astral laughed so evil, as he was in the air, firing flame \nrockets\n&gt; everywhere in sight.\n&gt; \n&gt;         The Dark Lavacons are completely evil, the only thing they \nwant to\n&gt; do is destroy things, they will even shoot at eachother, the \nshooter not\n&gt; caring, and the one getting hit not carring.  DESTROY is their main \ntheme.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; ::Skulletron::\n&gt; \n&gt;        Skulletron suddenly started to wake up.  Uggh, where was he??\n(He&#39;s in\n&gt; a CR right???)  Ah ha, he was in a CR Chamber.  He wanted to get \nout, he\n&gt; better be careful.  He stepped out of the CR, and started running, \nto\n&gt; Feline&#39;s workshop(or where ever the hell she was).\n&gt; \n&gt;      He looked at Hot Rod, then at Feline.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Fe...Fe..Line......Feline........Man, am I GLAD to see \nyou!!!  Help\n&gt; me!!!!  QUICK!!!!  What do I do....These Maxi&#39;s will be all over me \nnow, I\n&gt; ran as fast as I possibly could to get here, to hide.  Cover me??&quot; \nThen,\n&gt; Skulletron looked at Hot Rod again.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Wow, Hot Rod, lookin&#39; good!!!&quot; He commented.\n\n\n"}}
