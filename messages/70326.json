You will show and identify yourself immediately. If you do not comply, I will be forced to terminate you! You have thirty astro seconds to come forward!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor Aimed as well as Talon.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If it wasnt that I know that Optimus Prime is dead, i could swear that he is here...&quot;murmured Perceptor\n\nAs everyone got in position, anyone with sensors could make out that\nnearly a quarter of a mile further down the tunnel was a vast chamber.\n\nDifferent members of the group, Perceptor and Tuscon most notably, may\nremember the reports that were given by Kup, Dark Rodimus or Skorponok\n(depending if they were predacon or Maximal) about the route that had\nbeen taken in that long undersea tunnel that had been dug by\nScorponok, stretching from near to the Ark just about all the way to\nthe Black Fortress. Here along the path, according to the reports,\nthere had been a chamber that at that time had distinctive minion\nsignature. However the report also reported that at last scan that\nchamber had been filling with magma, but now sensors were picking up\nsomething very different from that specific location.\n\nWhile no one was close enough to see it, it was still nearly a quarter\nof a mile down the tunnel, sensors showed this area to be an open\narea, one that stretched several hundred meters in diameter, and was a\nperfect circle. From within this chamber Rodimus Prime&#39;s signature\ncould be made out, although it did not appear that he was conscious at\nthe moment judging from his low energy output. Strangely his signature\nseemed to be a bit muffled as if something were covering it or\nattempting to remove it.\n\nAlso from that larger chamber there is the signature of something\ntruely alien. It was not Predacon, Decepticon, Autobot or Maximal, but\nit was technological life none the less.\n\nFrom in front of the group, just outsdie the range of Tuscon&#39;s lights\nstep figures, six of them nearly identicle to the ones that the group\nhad already seen before. Insectile and alien they were as big as full\ngrown lions. However a seventh is there as well. It looked much the\nsame as the first ones, but was larger, nearly as large as the tunnel\nitself and about as large as an elephant.\n\n&quot;You have come to feed the mistress.&quot; said the larger of the figures,\nits voice hissing as it did so. &quot;Good. Your technological\ndistinctiveness will be added to our own, and we will become\nstronger.&quot;\n\nThe creatures continued out of the darkness and into the light, thier\nbladed feet echoing oddly as they sliced through rubble and rock to\nattack!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
