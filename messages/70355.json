Quickstride uses his strength to drag Rodimus up \n&gt; the ramp leading into his leader&#39;s trailer.  Straight Shot now tries to \n&gt; help get the strands of silk off of Rodimus and finds them rather sticky \n&gt; to the touch.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ewwww, grosss.  Don&#39;t worry Rodimus, we&#39;ll try ta get these off.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She attempts to uncover the fallen Prime, as does Quickstride who is still \n&gt; trying to get Rodimus up into Tucson&#39;s trailer.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No time ta get grossed out, we gotta get him inta Tucson&#39;s cab ASAP!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson remains stationary while firing off the blast cannons on his \n&gt; headlight ports.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hurry, we haven&#39;t got much time, just get him aboard so we can get out \n&gt; of here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride snorts, after getting silk in his nose.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes sir, we&#39;re trying our best, he&#39;s kinda heavy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With Straight Shot&#39;s help, Quickstride attempts to get rodimus fully \n&gt; loaded onto Tucson&#39;s trailer.
