This time her front limbs emerged from the cell, one of her back legs rising to the opening to widen it so that the rest of the body could come through.\nThere was nothing but rage and the need to kill as the beast pushed and strained against the bars, the long tail smacking against the bars of both sides of the cell�just above the head of the unconscious Tavatron.\nShe opened her mouth and roared at Hiss, her jaws then snapping a hair�s length from his face.\nIt was then that she head Dark One�s words, snapping her head around to look at him in a way that meant nothing other then, � Fresh meat! �\nWith the sight of his gun entering the cage an immediate warning went off in the new beast�s mind, weapons meant trouble but there was so much rage an anger that warning was soon drowned out. But then suddenly another warning went off, one in which echoed in the mind of a logical bot. It thought and recognized the danger and the need to protect a friend.\nShe knew that their target wasn�t her, but the bot in which was laying on the ground behind her.\nWith a quick movement she slammed her tail on either side of the cell, right in front of the noses of Breakdown and Dark One. She was just about to snap out at both Dark One and Breakdown when she felt the floor vibrate with a small step, turning her head in towards the cell and then seeing Tavatron on her feet.\nShe heard the words from the fembot�s mouth but was unable to answer, the ability to speak lost in the rage of both beast modes. The logic of the lost bot barely even there, recognizing the figure then stood before her and knowing not to attack.\nBut the beasts dominated the bot, how Iron Raptor was ever going to become herself again lost in the primitive thoughts of both beast modes.\nBut the sight of the upright Tavatron brought a little of the bot back up to the surface, caution and worry plainly written in the new beast�s eyes.\nThe head tuned to the side to allow the left eyes to have a full view of Tavatron, checking for major damage and such.\nBut then knowing that she wasn�t damaged it then turned it�s attention back towards the Oblitercons, but knowing that it was outmatched.\nThey had the guns, they had the power, it had the teeth, it had the ability.\nBut it then snapped her head back towards Hiss, then towards Braekdown and Dark One, snarling and baring it�s teeth.\nEmerging now three-quarters from the cage it struck out at Hiss again, the jaws coming even closer this time.\nBut then the creature took a step back and roared at Scattershot as it saw him aim his gun towards it, just bunching it�s muscles to finally break from the cell and rage towards the bot.\nBut just as Iron Raptor was ready to leap the charges from Scattershots gun sent it slamming into the electrified bars at the back of the cell, screaming out in pain and rage as defeat and a fair amount of voltage set in.\nWith a growl that then slowly died away into a soft rumble the beast slid to the floor, laying on it�s side and slowly setting it�s head on the ground.\nThere was a massive hole in the side of Iron Raptor, the hole rounding off onto the chest and bleeding mech fluid of both worlds. The yellow fluid of the Second Beast Mode and the red fluid of the velociraptor bled together, creating an orange puddle of fluid that oozed from the cell and onto the floor in front of Breakdown.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
