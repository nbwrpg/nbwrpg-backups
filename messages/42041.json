In panther mode,she layed as close to the ground as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; possable and stayed perfectly still. If she could avoid a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; confrontation, she would. With luck, they would mistake her for \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shadow and move on.  If not, she&#39;d fight to the death.  One \nthing \n&gt; &gt; she \n&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t stand, was preds. She&#39;d normally fight a pred and win. \n&gt; &gt; But, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out numbered, she was at a disadvantage. Best thing to do was \n&gt; wait \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and see what happened.\n\n\n"}}
