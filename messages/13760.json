He seemed calm and under control, thanks to the additional \nmotherboard. Plus, he was a curious bot. He looked like a newborn, \ndiscovering things and testing what he could do. He enjoyed using his \nvoice. Techy had even gotten him singing one day with her in his \ncell, which made Sky Knight laugh. A killer that sang. \n\nHe couldn&#39;t complain, he did have a nice voice. He just thought it \nwas funny. The two had a duet going, after Beserk learned the words. \nHe was a fast learner. And he understood. They found that some words \nhe obeyed them competely. One that worked like a charm was &quot;Stand \ndown&quot;. Beserk would stop whatever he was doing, give a snarl if he \nwas upset then back away with his arms crossed. They learned \nthemselves to use that command if something got out of hand. \n\nSky Knight and Techy watched as Beserk looked out the window. His \nmassive black hand were on the radiator, while he leaned forward. \nThey both watched as if he was a normal bot and they were his \ncreators. \n\nThere was still things that had to be done and settled before they \ntook him out into public. First of all they had to make another \nreport to the councilman that Beserk was doing fine and no mishaps \noccured. \n\nBeserk snarled in alarm. He backed up from the window and looked \ndown. The radiator was hissing. Techy giggled lightly, making sure \nnot to be loud enough to be heard. \n\n&quot;The radiator just scared him,&quot; she said.\n\nSky Knight grinned in reply. Beserk walked off. The fur-like fabric \non his shoulders flowed as he went.\n\n\n"}}
