He was pleased, all \nwas going =\r\naccording to plan. \n&gt; With a thought he activated his communications gear, =\r\n&quot;Scourge. \nReport, have you locted Rodimus?&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Hmph.&quot; came the sweep comma=\r\nnder&#39;s replied. &quot;The coward must have \nhad stealth gear. I cannot detect hi=\r\nm directly. But I am picking up \nhis trail heading away from this area. He =\r\nmust be on the run!&quot;\n&gt; Cyclonus&#39;s voice is calm as he responded, &quot;Do not as=\r\nsume he is \nrunning from you, there may be some other purpose. Proceed with=\r\n \ncaution.&quot;\n&gt; Scourge grunted, &quot;We will get him. Scourge out!&quot; \n&gt; Cyclonus =\r\ncould hear Scourge&#39;s confidant chuckle as the channel \nclosed, leaving Cycl=\r\nonus to smile inwardly at the confidance of \nScourge. \n&gt; &quot;Sir.&quot; Tumult&#39;s vo=\r\nice crackled over Cyclonus&#39; internal \nspeakers, &quot;We have failed to achieve =\r\nour objective. The ark \nwas=A0defended by some someone called Legacy. We wo=\r\nuld have took him \nout but the Maximals showed up as well, out flanking us.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; Cyclonus paused, as a part of his plan was not going as he had \nengiene=\r\nered. &quot;What is the status of your team, and why isn&#39;t \nDeepstryke reporting=\r\n?&quot; Cyclonus called back on the same channel.\n&gt; &quot;He is critcally damaged sir=\r\n, the rest of us have recieved minor \ndamage as well. Phobia is looking aft=\r\ner him.&quot;\n&gt; Cyclonus listened intently to the report, tactically asssing how=\r\n he \ncould best use this. &quot;Where are the other two minions, Darkfate and \nN=\r\nightstrike?&quot;\n&gt; Tumult grunted, &quot;I gave the command to retreat, but those tw=\r\no \ndefied me and stayed behind. they are probrably being blown to atoms \nby=\r\n now!&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Have Phobia take Deepstryke back to the Moonbase, he will be of \n=\r\nlittle further use to us here. The rest of you rejoin me here.&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Sir!&quot; ca=\r\nme Tumult&#39;s quick reply. &quot;We are on our way.&quot;\n&gt; Opening up another channel =\r\nCyclonus spoke, &quot;Change of plans, move \nto intercept Darkfate and Nightstik=\r\ne. Acertain thier condition. Aid \nthem as required.&quot; \n&gt; &quot;Acknowledged. Enro=\r\nute.&quot; Came the quick reply and the channel \nclosed.\n&gt; Nightstrike and Darkf=\r\nate=A0would be punished later, Cyclonus thought \nto himself, but for now th=\r\ney would need to be rescued from thier \nfoolishness, and=A0Nightrazor shoul=\r\nd be sufficiently repaired for this \nmission.\n&gt; Cyclonus continued to chuck=\r\nle as he floated in midair, his sweeps \nsurrounding him like a blanket of e=\r\nnergized death, yes things were \nstill according to plan. He would destroy =\r\nthis Rodimus once and for \nall, and then all the defenders that held them b=\r\nack from the ultimate \nconquest of earth!\n&gt; (To be continued)\n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (=\r\nDa&#39;minion)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
