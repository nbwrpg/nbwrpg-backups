Anything strong enough to do that is\nextremely dangerous.&quot;\n\nLEO glanced at TUSCON and then back at the other Maximals, &quot;We will\nhave a team ready to assist should you have any problems. Report\nanything anamolous.&quot;\n\nHe straighted, &quot;Do not engage the enemy unless you absolutely have to\nand only as a means to get away. Do you understand?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n&gt;&gt; BIC:  Tucson could see some anxiety about the mission in the trio but most\n&gt;&gt; of all with Wheelie.   He looks to Straight Shot and Rattrap, gesturing\n&gt;&gt; that he was all set with them at the moment.  He turns back to Wheelie\n&gt;&gt; with an expression of understanding.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t worry, you will never be too far without proper backup.  Just keep\n&gt;&gt; in touch with me and let me know where you are as you deem necessary.  Now\n&gt;&gt; Leo Primes intel is correct.  You will follow those coordinates and it\n&gt;&gt; will lead right to Rodimus and the others.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a nod over from WHEELIE at Tuscon&#39;s words, &quot;If we see them we are\n&gt; to run away, and let someone isntead fight for us this day.&quot;  That was fine\n&gt; over for him.  Being in the front lines of the fight of the behemouths of\n&gt; the war was well outside of his capability.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
