As they near\n&gt; him, he rears up, extends his enormous wings and beats them with powerful\n&gt; thrusts, hoping to create enough wind resistance to keep them at bay.  His\n&gt; tail whips around in powerful coils as he prepares to catch one of them with\n&gt; a constrictor grip, in an attempt to slow them down.   He sees something\n&gt; very familiar about them, yet having had a portion of his memory erased when\n&gt; Cyclonus struck him vorns ago, he could not really be sure he was seeing who\n&gt; he thought he was seeing.  His expression changes, as anger is replaced by\n&gt; confusion and anticipation.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Grimlock?  Wait!  Is your name Grimlock?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson shows the leader his Maximal faction symbol, and a small Autobot\n&gt; symbol located on his left front haunch.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I am Tucson Prime, formally Tucson!  You might have known me in my Autobot\n&gt; alt form!  But I assure you that I&#39;m not lying!   I once worked for Optimus\n&gt; Prime!  &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He hoped that Grimlock would sort of remember who he was.  He then takes a\n&gt; submissive stance, showing that he means no harm.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON takes a submissive stance GRIMLOCK assumed his robot mode,\nhis rather large and imposing looking rifle with twin cannons on it\nnow pointed directly at TUSCON. There seemed to be little or no other\nreaction to TUSCON&#39;s words.\n\nGRIMLOCK was still massive and imposing as a robot, every bit as tall\nand thick as he had been pictured in the histories even though he had\nbeen part of the great reduction as every other Autobot who had\nsurvived since then. However instead of their being an Autobot patch\non his chest there was a blank spot where it looked as if something\nused to be there but had been cut off.\n\n&quot;Cuffs!&quot; GRIMLOCK barked.\n\nThere was a grunt as one of the transmetal dinosaurs, the Triceratops\nSLAG, transformed into robot mode, &quot;No! Me want to smash!&quot; He\ndisplayed his desire physcially as he oriented his electron blaster on\nTUSCON.\n\nThe other two transmetal Dinosaurs presumably SNARL and SLUDGE just\ngrumbled, SLUDGE stepping foward, his stomp causing the trees to shake\nand rattle.\n\n&quot;Me said cuffs!&quot; GRIMLOCK said as he turned to look at SLAG.\n\nSLAG turned to look at GRIMLOCK as if he were about to say something\nelse and instead met GRIMLOCK&#39;s optics and remorceless stare. After a\nmoment he nodded, &quot;Cuffs.&quot;\n\nTurning back to TUSCON the dino pulled out what were obviously stassis\ncuffs and was about to place them on the submissive TUSCON as the\nother dinosaurs grinned from beastmode.\n\nGRIMLOCK merely looked on sternly, still having his laser rifle\npointed at TUSCON.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
