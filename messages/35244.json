His battle wounds weren&#39;t that bad, and he would be out\n&gt; soon. He sets up the CR, and starts the process.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rippersnapper arrives back at base after a disapointing end to his\n&gt; fight with Orion, and he isn&#39;t too happy, not that he is every really\n&gt; happy though. &quot;Rippersnapper want to crush slag out of bots.&quot; He\n&gt; leaps at Sinnertwin from behind.\n&gt;\n&gt; Switchblade smiles. A new warrior to match the previous creation.\n&gt; &quot;As I recall, there were two bots in the base who don&#39;t belong.\n&gt; Firestrike, find them,&quot; he says coldly, &quot;and terminate them.&quot; he\n&gt; finishes with a glint in his glowing green eyes. &quot;I expect NO\n&gt; failures.&quot; Switchblade exits the lab, and heads up to control room.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dead-End and Drag Strip arrive at the base. They land, and enter\n&gt; the base only to find that only one of the ship&#39;s CR chambers ins&#39;t\n&gt; in use. Drag Strip pushes Dead-End out of the way, and walks\n&gt; inside, starting the process. Dead-End grumbles, &quot;...crazy loser, I&#39;ll\n&gt; get the CR eventually, it really doesn&#39;t matter when I get it as long\n&gt; as I do.&quot; He checks out his charred right side, and winces in pain\n&gt; as he touches one deep gash, probably from the shrapnel of a\n&gt; missile.\n\n\n"}}
