Come.&quot; \n&gt; He starts to head to the command center. When he arrives there, \n&gt; the scanners bleep once, and the computer starts to say, \n&gt; &quot;Disturbance detec--&quot; but it is cut off as the ship powers down, and \n&gt; all power is lost, including auxilary power sources. Pacifix sits \n&gt; down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Crossroads also starts out of the room, when the ship powers \n&gt; down, and the lights turn out. He frowns, and mumbles to himself, \n&gt; &quot;Damn, this is wierd...&quot; He heads into the first room he can see, \n&gt; but finds that the door won&#39;t open. \n&gt; \n&gt; On the DED ship,\n&gt; \n&gt; Soundwave frowns at this unknown weakness that has struck him. \n&gt; &quot;He watches the scanners, and frowns even more, &quot;Surge \n&gt; detected,&quot; Suddenly, the power fails.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: gtg, add more on later. =P\n\n\n"}}
