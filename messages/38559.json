Lets go.&quot;\n\nSupernova turned and walked out of the holo-room along with his team\nand headed for the exit of the Iron Fist. When they walked out of the\nexit, they saw Daemos already flying in. Supernova looked in his\ndirection, and then narrowed his eyes as he looked at the coast of\nSpain and saw an energon explosion.\n\n&quot;Vicyr, Slasys,&quot; he ordered, &quot;Go check out that explosion. Me, Flare,\nand Scrap will meet this new bot.&quot;\n\nVicyr and Slasys nodded and transformed. They combined into a jet and\nflew off toward Wolfgang while Supernova, Flare, and Scrap used their\njetpacks to fly toward Daemos.\n\n&quot;Welcome to Alliance island.&quot; Said Supernova to Daemos over his comm\nlink. &quot;My name is Supernova. Zardus sent me to escort you to him.&quot;\n\n\n\nThe jet that was Vicyr and Slasys landed near the stasis-locked\nWolfgang and seperated back into the individual bots. They both\napproached him.\n\n&quot;Looks like he&#39;s out cold.&quot; Vicyr said. Him and Slasys picked\nWolfgang up and flew off toward the Iron Fist.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
