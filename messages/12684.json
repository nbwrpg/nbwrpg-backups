He had \nfailed in an easy escape, so he would have to make a little noise. He turned \nto see Aerostreak loading his pistol, getting ready to fire at him.\n    &quot;I said stand back! I will---OH NO!&quot; She rhasped in his voice as \nAerostreak fired a shot, blowing off his head which bounced across the floor. \nHis body stumbled around feeling for its head.\n    &quot;Commander Quickstrike, Paralysis and Black Aracnia need to get to a CR \nchamber. I&#39;ll put Tarantulas in the Brig.&quot; Aerostreak said as Grappler and \nGuantix arrived on the scene and awaited Quickstrikes orders.\n\n    Aerostreak placed Tarantulas in the cell across from the Maximlas there, \nand left no even saying a word to his former commrads. In the cell the body \nstill flet around for its head that laid up-side-down.\n    &quot;Damn that widow! She will pay!&quot; He said as he replaced his head and \nlooked to the Maximals. A thought occured in his head, and he decided to \nbegin communication.\n    &quot;Maximals! Why are you here?&quot; He demanded, his body pressing agianst the \nforce feild so he could get a better look at the threesome.\n    Nighteyes didnt trust him to much, but being mean didnt get anyone \nanywhere. &quot;Our brothers and sister joined the Predacons, and we&#39;ve been here \never scince. I think a week or two.&quot; She said.\n    Tarantulas began to laugh, a rhaspy cold laugh. &quot;I think we&#39;ll get along \njust fine then. Hahahahahhahaha!&quot;\n\n"}}
