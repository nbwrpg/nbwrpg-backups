Simple words?\nShe looked down at herself and remembered the way that he had turned her \nthat way, if it was like that then she didn&#39;t want to change too often.\nRage took a step back and then looked back at Scourge, but if it could \nchange her back into the leathalness and twice as deadly creature she was \nshe HAD to try!\nShe was a bit nervous but she guessed that would pass once she was back to \nnormal.\nHere went nothing!*\n\n&quot; B...Beast......Mode!&quot;\n\n* With no warning what so ever Rage transformed back into her Tarbosaurus \nbeast form, the roar that also signaled the transformation could be heard \nfor miles.\nRage shook once she was in the scales that were more familiar to her then \nthe cold steel of her robot form.\nThe wildness of her beast form was dull but still there, it&#39;s wild taste for \nchaos and the simple need to survive was returning...but not to extent that \nit was.\nRage looked at Scourge and swung her massive head towards him, now it was \ntime to go wherever it was that he was to take her.\nAnd hopefully catch a bite to eat on the way, be it organic or robotic!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
