Flicker had dropped Hightlight, but\n&gt; he was still too near for the Maximals to attempt anything without\n&gt; risks. On the other hand, if the spy killed her right away, he would\n&gt; have no more hostage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then he thought of something else. Condor was dead, so it was time for\n&gt; a payback. Owlhawk had never had the chance to successfully use this\n&gt; weapon, but he decided to give it a try. He changed both his wings to\n&gt; machine guns and opened his chest cannon. He first fired his left\n&gt; wing, then, without waiting, charged and fired his cannon and finished\n&gt; off with the right wing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Owlhawk: We shall see who understands...\n&gt; \nKenzo flew near, waiting to see what Owlhawk would do before he made a\nmove himself.  To take precation he went ahead and aimed his laser\nturrent at Flicker. \n\n\n"}}
