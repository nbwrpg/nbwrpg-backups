The characte=\r\nr names\n&gt; in red are one&#39;s that don&#39;t have a page yet.  Also if you have\n&gt; =\r\ncharacters than aren&#39;t on there, please add them.  (I don&#39;t want to be\n&gt; th=\r\ne only one who updates the wiki)\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have any trouble with the wiki=\r\n, please send me a message either\n&gt; on email or instant messenger.
