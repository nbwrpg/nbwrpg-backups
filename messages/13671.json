What is it you need to talk to me \nabout?�\n\n* She then glanced towards Prowl, wondering just if Battera wished their \nchat to be private�or if she would permit him to stay.\nEither way, she should have known that this would be a fairly busy day.\nBut then she also noticed Kluster enter the room, in turn, wondering just \nwhom he was�when he introduced himself.\nA smile appearing on her face as she took his hand and shook it firmly in \ngreeting. *\n\n� It does me the same honor to meet you too, Kluster. I�m Iron Raptor, \nacting Maximal Commander. I�m glad to finally meet the Commander of such a \nfine ship as this.�\n\n* She then let go of Klusters hand after the hardy shake and turned back \ntowards Battera after giving the CF Commander another of her kind smiles.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
