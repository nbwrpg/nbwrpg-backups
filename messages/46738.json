And as for the acid \n&gt; it is \n&gt; &gt; covering his entire body. If he ejected his armor he&#39;d be screwed \n&gt; anyway \n&gt; &gt; because the acid in the cloud would just cling to his now exposed \n&gt; super \n&gt; &gt; structure which noone can eject because it is the body itself. And \n&gt; as for the \n&gt; &gt; flames sticking to void, even if they did it would have been put \nout \n&gt; &gt; immediately by his body. Thank you dewboy for screwing your \n&gt; charachter over.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; IC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the four not so point blank range plasma blasts fly out at \nVoid, \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; quickly ducks to avoid them. At the same time the acidic cloud \nonce \n&gt; again \n&gt; &gt; expels a red acidic ooze all over thirst now eating away at his \nvery \n&gt; &gt; structure.\n\n\n"}}
