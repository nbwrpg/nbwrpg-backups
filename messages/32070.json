The damage wasn&#39;t as extensive as \nhe had imagined it would be.  A few disconnected wires, a few blown circuits, \na missing coupling or two to hold it all together.  He wandered back to the \nsupply depot he had found earlier and got the tools and parts he needed and \nreturned to repair the emitter.  He finished it quickly and began to think \nabout the new shield concept.  He tried to jury-rig it but the power output \nwould have been too immense for the emitter to handle, so much for that idea. \n He did some more planning and decided that the energon needed would have \nbeen a prohibitively large amount.  He walked back to the bridge.  &quot;The \nshields are up and running now.&quot;\n\n"}}
