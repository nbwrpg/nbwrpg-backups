This may not be\n&gt; the nWo but NBW is 4 life! The whole RPG is having\n&gt; some bad times right now. The only way we will\n&gt; bounce back is with everyone here, and working to do\n&gt; so. We need you. We need everyone! And if you want\n&gt; to get back on top again, I can end this only one\n&gt; way....... &quot;To be the man, you got to beat the man!&quot;\n&gt; As Ric Flair has always said. I hope you make the\n&gt; choice to stay, brother. Whoooooooooo!\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
