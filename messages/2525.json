It was HE who slammed into the side of the base, not her! And he was asking HER if she was alright? A bit monotonous if she thought so herself.\nShe looked away from Prowl and towards the base, a meeting scheduled that they had to attend.\nIron Raptor shook her head while still looking at the Ark, she then transformed into her robot mode as well. Her cheek healed but her back still feeling a bit raw even though it would appear repaired to the naked optic, it had been a fairly slow recovery.\nShe then looked back at Prowl.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m fine.&quot;\n\n* But then she saw that his wing was a bit out of line with it&#39;s structure, a simple meaning that something was wrong with it. She walked over to him and reached behind, with a gentle but firm hand she snapped the wing back into it&#39;s proper shape.\nIt was strange that he would slam into the base like that, or at least come to such an abrupt stop. Perhaps it was her weight that had thrown him off? But at least he had gotten the both of them there without any attacks or such events as that.\nBut she then smiled as she stroked her hand over the, once damaged, spot to make sure that it was well.*\n\n&quot; But thanks for the ride.&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
