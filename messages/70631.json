He was not abo=\r\nut to give up now, not when Rodimus really needed him.  He remembered how V=\r\nestige had been invigorated by his transfer of power from his chest core, w=\r\nhere a beating heart still pulsates.  It would prove useful again, and this=\r\n time, he needed a way to channel that power into the figure lying on the b=\r\ned.  He uses his arm to shield away the insects who were stinging him.  Wit=\r\nh the other arm, he reaches out to the figure&#39;s chest, and puts his hand on=\r\n him gently.  He concentrates deeply and tries to channel his own spiritual=\r\nity into the figure lying on the bed.  His very soul now acting upon his he=\r\nart out of the one power that no force could fight.  The power of compassio=\r\nn, of love, and of loyalty.  \n\n&quot; Rodimus, I&#39;m here now, and there is nothin=\r\ng that will stop me from bringing you back. My hand is here for you now.  A=\r\nnd this time, I will never let go.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston=\r\n Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson knew that th=\r\ne insects would attempt to follow him in the air, and with sword in hand, h=\r\ne attempts to use a revolving swing of the blade in their directions, hopin=\r\ng to clip them of their wings.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Thank you Vestige! I think I can ha=\r\nndle it from here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vestige barely has the time to nod a gr=\r\neeting before the insectiods\n&gt; are on him again, but this time, without Tus=\r\ncon&#39;s aid, the batle\n&gt; between him and they is much more desperate. He fire=\r\nd off several\n&gt; shots before more of them continued to close in. There were=\r\n still two\n&gt; standing, closing on his position as Tuscon continued moving s=\r\nwiftly\n&gt; through the air, the blue winged insects flying swiftly after.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s blade is able to hold them at bay, but only temporarily as\n&gt; the=\r\ny are far more agile in the air than he is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tuscon landed just behind =\r\nthe bed, almost in the position that the\n&gt; insectoids had been standing ori=\r\nginally. The figure still laying prone\n&gt; and unmoving on it. The figure was=\r\n almost completely white with hints\n&gt; of yellow and orange splashed along i=\r\nt. It was as if the figure at one\n&gt; had far more color, but the color was s=\r\nomehow drained away, leaving it\n&gt; very drawn and nearly colorless. However =\r\nits most striking feature was\n&gt; that it looked almost exactly like Hot Rod!=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; With an angry buzz the winged insecoids flew at Tuscon, thier stinger=\r\ns\n&gt; and bladed forelegs slashing at him vigorously. While he is able to\n&gt; f=\r\nend off some with his blade, he cannot stop all of them from scoring\n&gt; on h=\r\nim!\n&gt; \n&gt; Around them the room continued to rumble.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
