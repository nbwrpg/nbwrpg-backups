I&#39;m sure Tucson&#39;s already figured me out&#39;n hid it somewh=\r\nere else.  It used ta be in Prime&#39;s chest, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s where i=\r\nt is anymore.  I know that bot Scorponok, he&#39;s not stupid.  If he feels tha=\r\nt somethn&#39; ain&#39;t right, he&#39;ll go out of his way ta make sure nothn&#39; goes wr=\r\nong.  And I saw inside his chest, he doesn&#39;t have it in &#39;em, that was a lie=\r\n.  If anything, he probably has it hidden somewhere in a different grid all=\r\n together.&quot;  \n\nAs he moves further and further away from the Ark, Tucson qu=\r\nietly transforms back into SUV mode and slowly rolls back into the Ark, bei=\r\nng careful to use dense vegitation around him as a cover up.  He gets insid=\r\ne and closes the door leading into it.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m in.&quot;  \n\nTucson puts out a han=\r\nd, to sense redsidual energy, and finds it.  His senses lead him back to th=\r\ne body of Optimus Prime.  He kneels down in respect and touches nothing upo=\r\nn doing so.\n\n&quot; It took me a little while to understand what you meant by &quot;S=\r\nelf Worth.&quot;  But now, I do.  I&#39;m no God, but I am very valuable to a cause =\r\nknown as change,innovation,freedom, justice and resolve.  After I&#39;ve accomp=\r\nlished these feats, I am valuable as a keeper of peace, and hopefully a pro=\r\nmoter of evolution.  Perhaps one day, I&#39;ll even be able to make an ally out=\r\n of an enemy and promote integration among the factions.  But first, there =\r\nare those who show great greed in power and have taken three of my own in p=\r\nersuit of it.  One of them being our trusted leader, Rodimus Prime who has =\r\nalways been the stronghold of our faction.  Matrix, you may seem this very =\r\nbold of me, and rather brash.  I appologize if I seem so.&quot;\n\nHe gets up onto=\r\n his feet.\n\n&quot; My roots have traced me back to Optimus Prime, who was not on=\r\nly a much admired leader, but also a beloved relative.  And as a relative o=\r\nf Optimus Prime, I too, am ready to embrace the vows he once took upon reci=\r\neving the Matrix of Leadership.  I&#39;m ready Matrix, I&#39;M READY TO LIGHT OUR D=\r\nARKEST HOUR!&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclon=\r\nus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; So far so good. Mild suspicion but nothing significa=\r\nnt yet. I think they&#39;re buying into him. When they go, and are well out of =\r\nrange, tell me, and I&#39;ll return inside the Ark.
