There had been a volcanic \n&gt; eruption only days ago. The land was still smoking and the soil \nwould \n&gt; take years to recover...\n&gt; \n&gt; He loved that place!\n&gt; \n&gt; Aries: Ah! This is the kinda place I could live in! No disturbing \n&gt; neighbours, a way to make the yokels believe you&#39;re a god and you \n&gt; want a virgin to keep you from destroying them, and (picking an \nolive \n&gt; from the upper branches of a partly burnt tree) plenty of oil!\n&gt; \n&gt; Just then, the third occupant said something.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dracon: Go that way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aries: What? What are you talking about?\n&gt; \n&gt; There was no answer. None was needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aries: Huh... Okay then...\n&gt; \n&gt; Aries knew who was the boss. Without knowing it, he was coming \ncloser \n&gt; and closer to the Predacon base.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; He was lurking in the night. The Humans wanted their kid back. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; would oblige them... to a point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Already, the small girl was shaking back into conscience. Quite \n&gt; fast, \n&gt; &gt; it would seem, as she was now screaming for her parents to save \n&gt; her. \n&gt; &gt; He and his companions smiled at the thought.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The large muscular man arrived with two smaller ones. The freed \nthe \n&gt; &gt; girl from the plants that tightly held her. None of them saw \nthe... \n&gt; &gt; thing leap from the top of the tree. None of them survived to \ntell \n&gt; &gt; the tale.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He had heard one of his friend say that he was a machine, but he \n&gt; did \n&gt; &gt; not believe it one bit. He circled the place where the humans \ndied, \n&gt; &gt; and swiftly decided that he would eat them. He savagely tore at \n&gt; three \n&gt; &gt; of them with three different heads at the same time. Blood \ncovered \n&gt; &gt; his mouth and that of his friends.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aries: Enough now! Leo, you stop being such a loser and accept \nit! \n&gt; &gt; We&#39;re not a stupid mindless beast!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Leo: Aries, shut up! I&#39;m in charge now! You could never prove \nthat \n&gt; &gt; before and you&#39;re not going to start now!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aries: Oh yes I will!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With a cry of excruciating pain, Leo was relegated to a \nspectator \n&gt; &gt; position. Aries was now in command and he transformed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He was not tall, nor was he very impressive. He was just a \nsimple \n&gt; &gt; robot. It was more than enoughto prove a point, though.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aries:Ha ha! See now? Okay, The food&#39;s not good anymore. Let&#39;s \nfly \n&gt; &gt; away.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With that, he stretched his leathery wings and started to cross \nthe \n&gt; &gt; Mediterranean sea, heading for Greece.\n\n\n"}}
