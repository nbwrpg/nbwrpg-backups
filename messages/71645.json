Straight Shot looks to Waspinator with a\n&gt; frightened expression.  Just like him she did NOT like the sight of Dark\n&gt; Rodimus.  But instead of running she prepares to defend both herself and\n&gt; Waspinator, and arms her forearm arrow launcher.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Okay get ready ta fly in the opposite direction.  If he goes inta alt\n&gt; mode, which I hope he does, I can pop his tires.  That&#39;ll slow him down.\n&gt; Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t let him hurt you.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry Waspinator, she won&#39;t let me hurt you.&quot; The voice was\ndefinitly that of DARK RODIMUS a dark parody of the real one. Smooth\nand composed it was the very essence of evil, and it was mocking\nWASPINATOR. &quot;Since when do you side with the Maximals?&quot; The smile on\nhis face was wicked.\n\n&quot;Wazzpinator does not side with foolish Maximals.&quot; WASPINATOR buzzed\nin the air, &quot;Hydras made Wazzpinator side with them, and now the dark\nfire bot is back again.&quot; WASPINATOR rockets are ready, but he still is\nunsure if he should fire against someone who was once an ally.\n\nSCOURGE flew around DARK RODIMUS. &quot;What are you doing here, we thought\nyou were dead. We see the other Rodimus too. . . . how?&quot;\n\nThere was a knowing smile from DARK RODIMUS as he reached down and\npicked up something off the ground, He looked back up at STRAIGHT\nSHOT, &quot;Maximals are always so predictable, you all want to shoot me,\nand these Predacons won&#39;t shoot me because they are not sure who I am,\nand you . . . &quot; He chuckled, &quot;You might shoot, but you will only try\nto main me.&quot;\n\nDARK RODIMUS laughed as he was looked at all of them. &quot;Don&#39;t you know\nit might already be too late?&quot;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Tucson catches Noctorro but he senses something wrong.  The \n&gt; other\n&gt; Fuzors, they did not follow and he growls, knowing that he could have to\n&gt; deploy another sonar roar.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I copy you Leo Prime...  Definitely an evil force is at play and I&#39;m\n&gt; determined to find out the cause.  Whatever it is, has effected the \n&gt; Fuzors..\n&gt;  I have a feeling it could return for Rodimus.  I&#39;m going to meet Noctorro\n&gt; now.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Force, or forces? LEO said. &quot;We have so many enemies these days.\nInsectile aliens, the minions of Unicron, who ever it is that called\nthe Dinosaurs and the Predacons you have allied yourself with.&quot; Leo\nsounded definitly concerned. &quot;Be very careful.&quot;\n\nKeep me apprised.&quot; He said. &quot;Leo Out.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The silver dragon leaps up into the air to meet Noctorro.  He hovers in a\n&gt; defensive mode.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;WHERE ARE THE OTHERS!? ANSWER ME!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson booms with a roar mixed in.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIt took only a few more moments for the Fuzor to reach TUSCON. As he\ngot closer he could see that was heavily damaged, his frame seemingly\nshot or burned by something.\n\n&quot;They . . . attacked!!&quot; NOCTORRO paused and then started again,\n&quot;Seekers, they just appeared . . . from no where . . . We were caught\noff guard!&quot; There was a pause again, &quot;Ambushed.&quot;\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nMeanwhile as TUSCON was talking with NOCTORRO . . .\n\nHYDRAS recieved a call on an encrypted channel. &quot;Hydras, can you read\nme? Hydras!&quot; The voice on the other end of the line was CRYOTEK.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
