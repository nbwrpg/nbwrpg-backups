No I did it&quot; said \nthe male while he revealed for first time his robot form. \nQuetzalcoatl was without doubt the ugliest robot in trasformers&#39; \nuniverse. He was shot but his arms was pretty large, his body was \nskinny and he walked hunched in robot mode.\n\nHis trasn formation to robot mode was similar to Airazor, bu his \nlarge wings was useful to fly in robot and beast mode.\n\nWhen Quetzalcoatl saw his robot mode he felt ashamed for his own \nugliness and covered hikmself with his wings while he walked towards \nthe darknest place of the lab.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Starstomp: Are you okay?
