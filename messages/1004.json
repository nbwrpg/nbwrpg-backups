Too damp for his taste. \nToo many little animals scurrying around. If his beast mode could, his skin \nwould twitch with his nervousness.\n\nHis crimson eyes scanned, now looking for a spot to rest. A place to hide \nunder. He crawled over to a dead log to his left, to see if it would make a \nhalf situable spot to bed down.\n\nNope. There was no way he could fit under it or inside it. He wasn&#39;t that \nskinny, even with his half starved body.\n\nBad idea. He shouldn&#39;t have thought of his stomach. It made him feel worse. \nA combination of starvation and damaged wasn&#39;t a good thing. He now lost \ncount of how many days he had last had something it eat. The feeling on his \nbody made him feel like he wanted to cry out. Now no one was with him. The \ntransmetal spider clone had said he would find him a CR chamber, but he \nfailed to do so for him. Where in the Inferno was he?\n\nHe could provide for himself, but for how long? The damage was terrible, and \nit threatened his life. Seriously.\n\nHe took a few strides worth with his many legs, searching the ground for a \ncomfortable place. He made two swipes of his large pincher into a soft piece \nof ground, but he then moved on.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
