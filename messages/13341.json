She swooped down and perched on a branch to see what would \ncome out of the pod.  Nothing came out so she flew down and landed \nnext to the pod.  She transformed into bot mode and looked at the \npod.  She knocked on the top of it. &quot;Hello, Any body in there?&quot;\n\nShe stood back to see if something inside would come out. She just \nhoped it was Predacon, what ever it was.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;             A stasis pod comes zooming down towards Earth.
