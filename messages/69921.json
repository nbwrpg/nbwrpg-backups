Also, the Maximal and\nPredacon characters are all generally human height as are the Autobots\nand Decepticons. Having Tuscon kneel down to talk with Rat Trap would\nbe . . .  um . . . interesting :)\n\nBIC:\n\n&gt; Tucson kneels down to Rat Trap.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; First, When I got transformed, the energy managed to repair the damage to my optics. Second, I came here to talk to Nightstrike.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap points to the base.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oh, um, ya better check in with the guys in the base first. Although, it&#39;s kinda obivous that you&#39;re one of us.. More so now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson chuckles again, and walks up toward the base.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Legacy, this is Tucson Prime reporting back to the Maximal Base. I wish to talk to Nightstrike, if at all possible. Please inform Lord Perseus of my pressense, it&#39;s important that I converse with him also.&quot;\n\n&quot;Acknowledged.&quot; Legacy&#39;s familiar cold voice intoned over the\ncommunication lines. Even as he spoke he transmitted the relevant\ninformation to Lord Perseus. &quot;I will meet you at that location.&quot;\nLegacy quickly checked the security access, &quot;I have processed your new\nconfiguration and your standard ID codes are now  sufficient to allow\nyou access to the secured areas.&quot;\n\nLegacy turned to look at Talon, &quot;Remain here to monitor communications\nand sensors.&quot;\n\nLegacy turned to leave the room, heading towards the area that\nNightstrike is being held.\n\nOOC: I am not sure where Nightstrike is being held :)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
