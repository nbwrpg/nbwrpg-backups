Also you guys complain that the new \ntransformers alters stuff like what the Matrix is and cybertron \nhaving an organic core.  Well do we listen to that guy who said an \natom was like &quot;plum pudding&quot; (dang it I&#39;m making myself hungry now).  \nNO we listen to the modernday version that has better equipment to \nbuild on old theories.  Also I think the organic creatures probably \nwere brought to Cybertron as a beatification project (and early \nexperiments with DNA scanners I know some bot in transformers looked \nlike animals but it wasn&#39;t convincing just similar and I doubt it \nserved the purpose of protecting them from energon), but I...I...I \nAGREE WTIH LN THERE I SAID IT!  NightScream suggested that &quot;some bot \ndecided you weren&#39;t worth keeping around&quot; (he was talking to the bat \nsceleton he got his DNA from) and I think that after what LN \nsuggested happened the Quasacons wiped out the animals, but they had \nalready become to much a part of Cybertron to just vanish so there \nsouls (don&#39;t say they don&#39;t exist if sparks exist souls aren&#39;t a \nquestion) took on the form of organic core and took over Vector Sigma \naltering it&#39;s nature.  The Matrix by this time had come close enough \nto expanding into heaven and had become so much smarter and universal \nit saw this was for the best and let it be.  It explains why a \ncomputer so bent on making Cybertron Technorganic had a weapon that \nonly worked against organics.  I DID IT!  I DID THE UNTHINKABLE!  I \nLOGICALLY MELDED THE 3 SERIES TOGETHER! Well naturally BW and BM were \nalready together, but, I MELDED G1 TO THEM!  NO ONE CAN PENALIZE ME \nFOR THIS OOC BECAUSE IT COULD BE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL THING I EVER \nPOSTED (the ONLY OOC I ever posted that actually affected anything \nalthough I&#39;m sure SOME of my ICs MUST HAVE influenced SOMETHING)!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; My personal theory is that the Transformers tried to become more \nlike humans. \n&gt; Remember in G1 during FFoD The quintessons were not too happy about \nthe \n&gt; humans helping the autobots because they were starting to act and \nthink like \n&gt; them, thus becoming unpredictable, where as the Decepticons were. I \nthink \n&gt; maybe in their efforts to become somewhat more human like something \nhappened \n&gt; between Cybertron and Earth, something really bad and thus Earth \nwas made a \n&gt; restricted area of space for cybertronians. Thats my two cents \nanyway.\n\n\n"}}
