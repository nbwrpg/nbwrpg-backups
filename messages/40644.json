Yahoo groups \nis \n&gt; &gt; slow at times with sending mail. Especially to hotmail at times \nand \n&gt; &gt; definately AOL all the time. Heh I havent recieved the below post \n&gt; by \n&gt; &gt; yan yet either. Thats why I check the group. Woot mesa got yelled \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; in the post too... woot.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well heres the post:From:  Yanshosh@a...\n&gt; &gt; Date:  Sat Jul 21, 2001  2:28 am\n&gt; &gt; Subject:  End The !@#%ing OOCs\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; THAT IS ENOUGH!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Out of the last 100+ posts, barely _10_ of them were IC. This is \nan \n&gt; &gt; RPG board,\n&gt; &gt; not a general discussion board. If you want to discus something, \ndo \n&gt; &gt; it over\n&gt; &gt; private email or on the message board on the site.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know about other people, but I am sick as hell of the \n&gt; &gt; completely\n&gt; &gt; pointless OOCs on the RPG board. Lurker, you&#39;re a great RPer. Now \n&gt; &gt; shut up and\n&gt; &gt; take the compliment. Dewey, this is a BW RPG. The moment I see a \n&gt; char \n&gt; &gt; with even\n&gt; &gt; a variation of &quot;Goku&quot; as his name, you&#39;ll regret it. In adition, \n&gt; stop \n&gt; &gt; moding.\n&gt; &gt; You can&#39;t make other people&#39;s chars do things, you never posted \nfor \n&gt; &gt; Mustex even\n&gt; &gt; attempting to get on Alliance Island, much less getting on it, \nyou \n&gt; &gt; have no part\n&gt; &gt; in the past of NBW, and can&#39;t change it at will. Your chars have \nno \n&gt; &gt; logical way\n&gt; &gt; of knowing about Zardus or Veratis, and its moding to have them \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; insight. Either explain how they know or drop that storyline. It \n&gt; &gt; makes no\n&gt; &gt; sence. Also, you never even landed that lowlife seller or \nwhatever \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; yours on\n&gt; &gt; the planet, and I&#39;m not going to write your profiles for you. \nShape \n&gt; &gt; up. Read\n&gt; &gt; the rules and act by them. LegendaryNemasis, please stop \ncommenting \n&gt; &gt; on every\n&gt; &gt; post. The council will catch it if its moding.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Everyone else: stop the OOCs. Either write RPG posts, or don&#39;t \npost \n&gt; &gt; at all. I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; very sick of coming home from work and reading through 100 or so \n&gt; damn \n&gt; &gt; OOC\n&gt; &gt; posts. I&#39;m about ready to moderate anyone who sends an OOC ever \n&gt; &gt; again. I won&#39;t,\n&gt; &gt; but keep in mind that I&#39;m on the verge of turning into a very \nmean \n&gt; &gt; person.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From now on, use private email for pointless OOCs, or use the \n&gt; site&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; message\n&gt; &gt; board. DO NOT clog up space on this board. I&#39;m sick of it, as I \n&gt; said \n&gt; &gt; like 10\n&gt; &gt; times already in this post.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There. I&#39;m through with my ranting. I really hope the OOC \nmessages \n&gt; &gt; stop. Its\n&gt; &gt; very hard for me to keep up with posts as it is, and all this \n&gt; &gt; pointless crap is\n&gt; &gt; starting to convince me not to even bother.\n\n\n"}}
