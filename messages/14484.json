The shields were weakest \nbehind the ship but against K9&#39;s weapon they&#39;d hold long enough. The \nship lowered itself to the ground guns facing away from K9, the \nshields powered down to 20 percent. Phobia was running a risk getting \nthis close and he knew it. \n\nPhobia opened a link to the Maximal &quot;I do not wish to fight you, My \nback is to you and I&#39;ve decreased power to my shields, I&#39;m at your \nmercy. As a sign of interest transform to beast mode and we&#39;ll \nnegotiate. by the way my weapons were only set at 10 percent.&quot;\n\nIf this bot had any sense of logic it would see the disadvantage it \nwas in and react accordingly.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Rod continued to fire, on the CFs attackers.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::K-9::\n&gt; \n&gt; K-9 saw what phobia was trying to do.\n&gt; &quot;No!
