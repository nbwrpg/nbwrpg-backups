But \nI don&#39;t have an argument over a conflict.&quot; He laughed breifly.\n\nHe put his scanners on, now passing the last marker. Ahead was a formation \nof a cave. Or what looked like one. This may be the wolf&#39;s shelter. He \ntransformed to robot mode and withdrew his gun. &quot;Stand-by.&quot; he said to \nKitKat through his comm-link. &quot;I think we&#39;re here.&quot;\n\n\n\nRowdy Wolf turned his head and sniffed the air. &quot;I smell something,&quot; he said \nto Zyber. He lifted his lips from his upper row of teeth. &quot;More like \nsomeone.\n\n&quot;Rowdy Wolf, terrorize.&quot; he commanded his activation code. It was the first \ntime he transformed using the phase. He withdrew his rifle from under his \nheavy furs, and stepped out of his cave.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
