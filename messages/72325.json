Long gashed went\ndown his frame, followed by burnt marks and places where he had been\nsliced.\n\nHowever he didn&#39;t seem to even feel it as he looked at WOLFGANG,\nNIGHTSHIFT and RAMULUS, &quot;Wolfgang, get inside and lets get this ship\nrepaired, on the double. Ramulus, you get Nightshift to the medical\nbay.&quot;\n\n&quot;The same could be said for you.&quot; PROWL said as he too exited the\ncockpit section of the ship. He also had taken a few slashes and\nburns, but not nearly to the extent that POLAR CLAW had.\n\nPOLAR CLAW grunted, &quot;Later. First we have a mission to complete.&quot;\n\n---------------------------------\n\nMeanwhile OUTSIDE the shuttle on the ARk bay floor, TORCA and the\nother fuzors, along with RAT TRAP and STRAIGHT shot had watched the\nshuttle come in and could see the landing gear crumple as the ship\ntouched down and the ship rumble to a stop.\n\n&quot;Judging by the ship they are probrably going to need some help.&quot;\nSANTON said as he looked on.\n\nWINGCALIBER nodded as he watched the shuttle ramp extended and the\ndoor opened, the sound of orders being given coming from inside, it\nsounded like POLAR CLAW.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
