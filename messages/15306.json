If you have any questions about any of them, feel free to \nemail me. Also, don&#39;t take examples of Ramulus&#39; memories and try to base \nthings on giant bots and transforming bases. The memories in this post are \nexactly the reason the rules were made.\n\n::Ramulus::\n\nA familiar feeling was felt as Ramulus&#39; spark left his body. Familiar, but \nyet different in a way. This time, he was not fatally wounded, and was a bit \nmore aware.\n\nHis spark flashes slightly as it is put into Fliq&#39;s body, small immages going \nthrough his head. They were immages from Fliq&#39;s life, random memories from \nthe Maximal (If you don&#39;t mind, Mimime, can you send me some of Fliq&#39;s \nmemories or something? Its not that important, though.).\n\nRamulus knew that while Fliq&#39;s memories were accessible to him, the reverse \nwas also true. Scenes flowed from Ramulus&#39; spark to Fliq. How he had first \ncame online on a mountain range in Africa, damaged and alone, how he had \nwandered for years untill he saved a Maximal&#39;s life, and was sucked into the \nwar. Memories from certain battles were also vivid: saving a tribe of humans, \nfighting against the gigantic body that Adrax used to have, looking in awe as \nTrypticon and Base (the Predacon and Alliance bases) fought, the ground \nshaking under them.\n\nVarious images, from when there were only about 20 bots on the planet, went \noff to Fliq&#39;s mind, all climaxing up to the scene of Ramulus&#39; death. He was \nlaying near the Ark, helpless and in stasis lock, just regaining \nconsciousness. He saw a bot that looked like Zardus kill a few of the \nwounded, slowly turning his head as some sound drifts to him from the bushes. \nHe watches as three Predacons run onto the battle field: Injector, Manterror, \nand Double Punch. Manterror turns to him, firing several ion disks into \nRamulus&#39; chest. Ramulus&#39; body twitches as the ion disks go through him, \neverything going black...\n\nBack in reality, Ramulus&#39; TM2 spark extends its green repair coils, begining \nits job.\n\n"}}
