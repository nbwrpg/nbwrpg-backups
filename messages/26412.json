But the hunger \ncould be tolerated and so could the cold so nothing was really that much of \na big deal.\nThe thunder rolled and the lightning flashed, and Carnage smiled at \nremembering an old saying that she had heard back on Cybertron, when she had \nonce been afraid of thunder because it hurt her ears.** &quot; The thunder rolled \nand lightning flashed and Heaven and Earth were shaken, the little pig \ncurled up his tail and ran to save his beacon.&quot; ** She chuckled at that, \nthinking how much that actually fit into her situation. Only that the pig \nwas dead and was going to be made into beacon in a day or so. How ironic.\nBy this time Teltoli was snug beside her and had her head on her paws, after \nexplaining in surprise about the title Carnage had mentioned.\nBut, even with the slight smile on her face she listened to the cat with fur \nand feathers, thinking that she had gotten the wrong picture of what she had \ntried to say.** &quot; I didn&#39;t mean that sort of title.&quot;\n** Carnage sighed and lowered her snout so that she was looking Teltoli in \nthe face.** &quot; I meant one where you go and prove to yourself that you&#39;re \nmore grown then everyone says. Because if you&#39;re just in it to make yourself \nfeel and seem more adult, then you&#39;re in it for the wrong reason.&quot; ** \nCarnage sighed. How was she going to explain this?** &quot; You have to like \ncombat and beating the Pit out of yourself to reach your goals. You have to \nbe in it for the benefits that you CAN protect yourself and have the \nknowledge to protect others. It&#39;s not a personality booster, it&#39;s the \nopposite.&quot; ** But Carnage leaned her head back and lifted a brow ridge.** &quot; \nBut you have that determined glint in you eye that I&#39;ve seen that says you \nwon&#39;t back down until you get what you want. So..to save me weeks of nagging \nand pleading I&#39;ll give you a chance to prove yourself in just how much you \nwant what you&#39;re asking for.&quot;\n** Carnage moved a bit so that she was facing away from Teltoli.** &quot; It&#39;s \nthe only chance I&#39;m giving you because in war failure is fatal and a dead \nbot has no second chances.&quot; ** She curled in around herself like a big brown \ncat and lay her head down my her feet.**\n&quot; We start at dawn.&quot;\n** And with that she closed herself and prepared for sleep.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
