I almost tracked her down, but the training was over before that. I flew in from the roof and followed her scent.&quot;\n\nHe smiles. &quot;Although I have certain advantages that help me track bots down.&quot;\n\nProwl takes out a small black object, tossing it and then concentrating. He feels his wing orbs tingle, the object slowing down and stopping before it hits the ground, then slowly beginning to float upwards.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCledar jumps to the side, stumbling but avoiding the fireballs. He recieves the transmission from Hot Rod. &quot;Allright, we&#39;ll keep this battle in the Maximals&#39; favor. Try to get reinforcements here, though.&quot;\n\nHe spins, firing back at Firestarter with a shot from his fusion cannon.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOne of Sixshot&#39;s shots smashes into Rixer&#39;s missile launcher, blasting off of his shoulder and out of his hands. He swears, firing back with his twenty shots from his machine gun as he steps back to get the missile launcher.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nForrior makes a sharp turn, the missiles going past. He aims and returns fire at shockwave with a plasma shot, then speeds up, going straight forward. He was quickly getting closer to Unitron, thinking of running him over.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeveral shots dig into Blyer&#39;s cockpit, not doing too much damage but shaking him a bit, making his return fire miss.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm spins in the air, avoiding the shots and firing two laser blasts from his arm cannon at Sixshot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe screen stops, turning around. &quot;I&#39;m taking you to Commander Iron Raptor. She&#39;s outside right now, so we have to exit the city.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
