You should try to lighten up and play \nwith jokes when their made instead of complaining about it. Hey I believe I \nhave an above average intelligence, but then again I have a good social life \nbecause I have fun messing around with people and cracking jokes, as well as \ndoing the unexpected.\n\n"}}
