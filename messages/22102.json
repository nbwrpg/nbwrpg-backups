She was also getting mad at the bot who hurt her\n&gt; friend. She was wishing she was bigger, so she could get back at that\n&gt; bot. &quot;Zeni, you just hang on. You can&#39;t leave, ok? So you can die. If\n&gt; you died, we couldn&#39;t play together. And I&#39;d be lonely. So you can&#39;t\n&gt; die OK? We&#39;ll get you fixed up. OK&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Trinity didn&#39;t know how badly Zeni was hurt or what exactly was wrong\n&gt; with him. But she was scared to lose another bot whom she felt close\n&gt; to.  She had lost her entire family and now was worried she would\n&gt; lose a friend.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Technosis: He&#39;s knocked out, this is bad.
