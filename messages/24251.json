Though, the gustalts could easily be seen, but \nmuch to big a match for just her.\nBut, just as her eyes went over the field again she finally spotted a bot \nshe could get.\nTo test her power out on.\nWith her cape flowing in the wind of war, Iron Raptor raised her sword \ntowards the sky, feeling the blade glow for a second before bringing it \ndown. An energy slash sent straight for Perndabot&#39;s side.\nBut before the slash would hit, she  brought her sword by her side and ran \ntowards him, wondering just how this body could handle close combat.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
