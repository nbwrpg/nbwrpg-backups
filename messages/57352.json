I must do what I can to dig those\n&gt; damned Tripredacus out of our world!

He just stood there in utter amazament. In\n&gt; &gt; front of him was Optimus Prime, the venerable Autobot, the ideal to\n&gt; &gt; attain, the fabled leader, but most of all, the grandfather he never\n&gt; &gt; had the chance to meet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He raised a hand and passed it on the huge head of his ancestor. He\n&gt; &gt; felt nostalgic, thinking of Pumpskin, who had fallen in the hands of\n&gt; &gt; the Preds, the Tripredacus, who had conquered his homeland, and of the\n&gt; &gt; Survivors, trying to build a semblant of resistance on Earth. His\n&gt; &gt; fists clenched and emotion swirled in his mind. He hated the Predacons\n&gt; &gt; for their constant tugs on the Pax Cybertronia, but he was now\n&gt; &gt; loathing against the Tripredacus. Something had to be done...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: I will have to go, Kup.
