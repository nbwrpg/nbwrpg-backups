She sat in the entrance way of the ark, \nlistening and watching.  She could see the maximal symbols, but not \nhaving been intorduced, she stayed warry of them.   She saw two bots \nstanding next to eachother.(Striker and Spears)  She smiled to \nherself.  She found it amazing how even in times of war,  something \nbeautiful could still come to full bloom.  She straightened up and \nsat there, twitching her tail and watching.  She sniffed the air, \nsomething didn&#39;t smell quite right, but she couldn&#39;t put her finger \non it.  She layed down and kept her head up, ears perked in the \ndirection of the others. \n\n\n"}}
