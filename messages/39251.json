Select course of actions.&quot; \nit\n&gt; informed the base. Megatron snarled. To much was going on at one \ntime,\n&gt; he opened a com-link. &quot;Triggerhappy, Skullgrin, Blindchaos, head \ntowards\n&gt; the pods, I will meet you there.&quot; he said over it. He then turned to\n&gt; Dominjoe and Blind Chaos. &quot;Nevermind, you will have your first test \nin\n&gt; the field.&quot; he said calmly, pointing to them to follow him.&quot; He \nheaded\n&gt; towards the exit. &quot;Computer, innitiate defence system in two \ncycles.&quot; he\n&gt; commanded.\n\n    ::DOMNIJOE AND BLINDCHAOS::\n\n    When Megatron was giving the tour before the Emergancy alarm(s) \nwent off, Domnijoe was absorbed in everything Megatron did and said. \nShe silently absorbed what he said about the D. Avain and hoped she \nsurvived along enough to see it&#39;s completion. She glanced at \nBlindchaos, who seemed to be busy looking *AT* Megatron...the way a \nDecepticon teen looks at a cute femme. He was careful not to let \nMegatron notice.\n    (Ugh....) she thought. (And I *KNOW* he&#39;s only doing it to annoy \nme. Makes it look convincing, though.) She shook off the thought with \na flinch.\n    When the Alarms went off and their commander ordered them to \nfollow, both Decepticons eagerly did as told.\n    &quot;As you wish, Lord Megatron.&quot; Domnijoe said with another polite \nbow after his command.\n    Blindchaos simply looked thrilled to bits.\n    &quot;Allllrrriiiight!&quot; he cheered. &quot;We get so se some ACTION!!&quot;\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n**************\n\n\n"}}
