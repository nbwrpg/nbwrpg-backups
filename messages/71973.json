He folded his arms ove=\r\nr his\n&gt; chest, his wings flexing behind his back. He was a master tactician=\r\n\n&gt; and chess player learning from others. The question was, was he\n&gt; learni=\r\nng so as to aid an ally or to deal with an eventual opponant.\n&gt; \n&gt; There wa=\r\ns a look of loss on INFERNO&#39;s face as he watched. It was\n&gt; obvious that he =\r\nwanted to come to HYDRAS&#39; aid, to take any hits into\n&gt; himself than allow f=\r\nor HYDRAS to come to any harm. But his obedience\n&gt; to HYDRAS was far strong=\r\ner and he stood  still, his body tense and\n&gt; ready. Should HYDRAS call on h=\r\nim he would fly instantly into action!\n&gt; \n&gt; BRUTICUS X was in a similar. Hi=\r\ns body was tense and ready, the small\n&gt; bat-like wings on his back flexed s=\r\npasmodically as he looked on, the\n&gt; flail in his hand seeming to move of it=\r\ns own accord, sparks of energy\n&gt; popping off its ends.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a chu=\r\nckled from TARANTULUS as he watched a cruel smile on\n&gt; his face, but he oth=\r\nerwise said nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; IGUANUS and WASPINATOR seemed to be the most comf=\r\nortable with this\n&gt; turn of events.\n&gt; \n&gt; IGUANUS just crossed his arms over=\r\n his chest as he watched, a content\n&gt; smile spreading across his face. He g=\r\nave the impression that for him\n&gt; this was both sport and entertainment.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; WASPINATOR just watched as well his smile was a happy one. He looked\n&gt; a=\r\nt CRYOTEK &quot;Waspinator just glad he not the one taking the blow this\n&gt; time.=\r\n&quot; he said quietly.\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK ignored him as he watched.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n\n&lt;NEW=\r\n - DINOBOT&gt;\n\nAs the melee went on, HYDRAS seeming to casually handle over h=\r\nis adversary, DINOBOT glancing over at Waspinator, &quot;Why, you speak that wit=\r\nh such fondness you make me tempted to do it to you for old time&#39;s sake, bu=\r\ng.&quot;\n\nGoing back to watch the fight, DINOBOT sitting over ot the back where =\r\nhe could get a better view of his programmed master as he slipped around li=\r\nke a snake throughout the room.\n\nGlancing at CRYOTEK and watching his &#39;crea=\r\ntor&#39; just as warily now as he was HYDRAS.  Turning to INFERNO, &quot;Is it not t=\r\nhe place of the.. Royalty to take personal charge of discipline?  You would=\r\n take away his personal enjoyment of enforcing one to behave as he would wi=\r\nsh for yourself?  HYDRAS is allowed such simple enjoyments now nad then.  D=\r\no you think he would take this fight without having any doubts of his victo=\r\nry?  There is nothing to worry of, SOLDIER.&quot;\n\nUnfamiliar with BRUTICUS X an=\r\nd some of the newer soldiers, DINOBOT watched them out of the corner of his=\r\n optic as well.\n\n\n"}}
