She was good at giving orders, but he wasn&#39;t under &lt;BR&gt;&gt;her command, Striker was his commander. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;He shruggs. He&#39;d tell her later. He turns to bring up the scans as her &lt;BR&gt;&gt;transmission reaches his comm-link. He turns and looks at Striker, realizing &lt;BR&gt;&gt;it was too late to stop him. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;He swears under his breath, turning to face Sniper. &quot;Yeah, go ahead,&quot; he &lt;BR&gt;&gt;says. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Striker frowns at Cyber Claws responce. &quot;Primal is not on the planet,&quot; he &lt;BR&gt;&gt;says, you should know that, you&#39;ve been here for quite a while....&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
