He was again able to move freely around the base without \nhis sister&#39;s help. However, he had gotten no response from the \nAutobots. Meanwhile, Tankor and Thrust came back from their patrol.\n\nMelchana:\nTankor, Thrust, follow me in the Matrix Chamber, and be seated.\nNow, rookies, I will teach you the art of transformation. Focus your \nminds on nothingness. Reach the balance between rage and peacefulness. \nFind the point of equilibrium, and feel the matrix penetrate your \nspark...\n\nThe two new Tripredacus closed their eyes... and soon glowed.\n\nTankor&Thrust: We are... transformed...\n\nThey both changed to robot mode, Tankor being a massive spiked warrior \nand Thrust an agile scout.\n\nBelthassan had seen the scene and looked positively surprised.\n\nBelthassan: Very good, both of you! Now, I shall try to contact the \nAutobots again. Thrust, please go see if Daemos&#39;s state is getting any \nbetter.\n\nThrust: Affirmative.\n\nBelthassan: Prophecy, open a frequency with the Autobot base; \nAutobots, I am Belthassan, commander of the Tripredacus. We wish to \nspeak with you. One of our member is on his way to your location.\n\n\n"}}
