Her spark \ngoing through what process in order to cure this plaguing beast mode, her \neyes even finally closing and her thoughts actually beginning to dim.\nThough, for some reason her thoughts, mind; all of that suddenly knowing \nbefore it went black, that as soon as she closed her eyes�there was a fairly \ngood chance that she would never open them again.\nAnd with that, everything just stopped�.\n\nIris was watching everything with a bit more doubt then she knew that she \nshould feel, remembering how Prowls very form almost seemed to change once \nshe had mentioned the name Dinobot for the first time.\nShe somehow knew that this exploratory procedure would NOT go off without a \nhitch.\nBut what she saw next was something that she hadn�t expected to see, nothing \nlike she had ever seen before.\nAt least not up close.\nWatching in wonder and horror, Iris watched both sparks detonate and create \na whole shock wave which was heading right for her.*\n\nIRIS: � He�s failed!�\n\n* And that was all she could get out before the shock wave reached her, \ncracking the monitor screen further before blacking out her systems.\nWhatever happened after that, she did not know.*\n\n________________________________________________________AFTER:\n\n* The early morning sun beat down upon a vast field, it very difficult to \ntell that only a matter of mega-cycles ago�everything had been leveled.\nLight winds blowing in from the south to creating a waving effect over the \nlong grasses of the plain, everything seeming as if nothing at all had ever \nhappened.\n\nCompletely unaware of Prowls awakening, she lay on her side at a slant \nseveral feet away. Hidden in the long grass, which made up the field with \nwhich all had happened.\nNot knowing that only mega-cycles ago she had been dead, her spark \nevaporated in the detonation.\n\tShe lay on her side, unconscious and unharmed, all seeming fine despite the \nearlier explosion.\nBut now, now everything seemed to be different, so very different. Not even \nher form was the same.\n\nHer spark fueled by the very existence of Prowl, even her beast mode had \nchanged.\nHowever, now she lay among the tall and waving grasses in robot mode, \nchanged from Prowls deal with the Matrix�and not even knowing about it..\nAnd more different then she could ever hope to imagine!\n\n\nThe early morning sun shone down upon waves of snow-white metallic hair as \nit fell over the newly shaped curves of her body. Extending from the crown \nof her head to the back of her bare knees, blue skin appearing through gaps \nin the flowing white sheet of hair.\nBlue and shapely legs extended out from under her hair, disappearing into \nthe long grass around her.\nWith her face hidden in the crook of one arm, her other stretched out away \nfrom her and just as hidden as her legs in the long grasses. White nails \ntipping her unseen hands as well as on the tips of her toes.\nBut even though her body seemed to resemble that of a blue skinned, bare, \nwhit haired human woman, every piece of it was some sort of refined metal \nalloy.\nBut all the time Iron Raptor had no idea that just as her body had changed, \nso now was her life. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
