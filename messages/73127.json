The blasts from DINOBOT were eating into\n&gt; th=\r\neir numbers as more and more of them were falling to the ground; But\n&gt; not =\r\nonly from his blasts but also from the MAXIMAL FUZORS as they also\n&gt; leapt =\r\ninto the fray, teeth, claw and talon slicing into the\n&gt; SHARKTICONS as well=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the middle of all of this SKYBYTE stood smiling now as he watched=\r\n\n&gt; the battle progress. Several SHARKTICONS landed next to him acting as\n&gt; =\r\na set of bodyguards. Lifting up his arms he directed others to\n&gt; continue t=\r\nheir attacks against DINOBOT and the others as well.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nEven a warrior=\r\n of DINOBOT&#39;S power was hard pressed against the SHARKTICONS as the REPROGR=\r\nAMMED PREDACON was being gradually separated from the rest of the MAXIMALS =\r\nand PREDACONS, only able to withstand against the SURGE of SHARKTICONS by t=\r\nhe assistance of the MAZXIMAL FUZORS!  Getting now that SKYBYTE was seeming=\r\nly directing them, but holding back behind the fray, he let out a snarl.\n\nG=\r\noing to try and whip up his tail cannon to blast a snap shot at SKYBYTE, on=\r\ne of the SHARKTICONS leaping up and latching it&#39;s teeth inot it, half sever=\r\ning DINOBOT&#39;s ARM!\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There looked to be a small storm over VICE =\r\nGRIP as they piled. There\n&gt; was confusion over him as the SHARKTICONS were =\r\nfalling into a frenzy\n&gt; of sorts! Teeth and powerful jaws were gnashing at =\r\nhim as they\n&gt; attempted to rend his armor plates from his chassis.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW=\r\n&gt;\n\nMeanwhile, VICE GRIP was being gradually..  Chewed apart by the SHARKTIC=\r\nONS, buried in a pile of them and thrashing about, his most opwerful weapon=\r\ns useless as he was SHARKPILED&lt; their teeth threatening tos kewer him layer=\r\n by layer!\n\n\n"}}
