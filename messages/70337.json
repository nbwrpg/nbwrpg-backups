Perceptor once again shut down his audio\n&gt; receptors as Straightshot and Quickstride braced for battle. Meanwhile\n&gt; Talon and Legacy leaped from the vehicle and fired on the approaching\n&gt; troopers in the desperate hope to buy Tuscon some time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon opened fire . . .\n&gt;\n&gt; [Insect Trooper #3 is HIT by Talon ] - Trooper #3 is at Light Damage\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile Legacy also opened fire, targeting another of the approaching \n&gt; horde!\n&gt;\n&gt; [Insect Trooper #1 is HIT by Legacy] - Insect Trooper #1 is drops into\n&gt; stasis lock!\n&gt;\n&gt; Because of having to reposition himself, Tuscon is unable to fire\n&gt; before the trooper reach him, and so he, as well as Legacy and Talon\n&gt; have to fend off their attacks first . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Insect Trooper #1] - Unable to attack - Stasis Lock\n&gt; [Talon MISSED by Insect Trooper #2]\n&gt; [Legacy MISSED by Insect Trooper #3]\n&gt; [Tuscon MISSED by Insect Trooper #4]\n&gt; [Tuscon MISSED by Insect Trooper #4]\n&gt; [Talon is HIT by Insect Trooper #6] - Talon is at Light Damage\n&gt;\n&gt; [Tuscon is HIT by Elite Insect Trooper #1] - Tuscon is at Light Damage\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally Tuscon is able to return fire, and opens up with a wide area\n&gt; audio assault, hoping to stun the approaching enemy!\n&gt;\n&gt; [Insect Trooper #1] - Unaffected (Already In Stasis Lock)\n&gt; [Insect Trooper #2] - Unaffected\n&gt; [Insect Trooper #3] - Stunned 1 Round\n&gt; [Insect Trooper #4] - Unaffected\n&gt; [Insect Trooper #5] - Stunned 2 Rounds\n&gt; [Insect Trooper #6] - Stunned 1 Round\n&gt;\n&gt; [Elite Insect Trooper #1] - Unaffected\n&gt;\n&gt; Some of the insectile troops stumble back at the rather surprising\n&gt; attack from the truck that is Tuscon! All around the combatants the\n&gt; walls rumbled slightly as a few loose stones and rocks fall to the\n&gt; ground. However it stopped after a few moments.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile as some of the insects reel in dismay, others come forward to \n&gt; attack!\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: As this stunning attack is something new to Tuscon I am having it\n&gt; affect them at MUCH lower levels then it would ordinarily. I am trying\n&gt; to figure out how I want to handle this using weapons in new ways. It\n&gt; was not something that was done so much in the cartoon or the comics.\n&gt; Basically folks had the weapons they had, and they used them to the\n&gt; best of their abilities.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyways, food for thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; -P\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
