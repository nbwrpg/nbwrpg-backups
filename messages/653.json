She sighed and tipped her wings downwards, diving to the ground until she landed beside Carnage with a soft thud on the sand. Using her scanners, she too could sense the Maximal Energy Signatures, but not the Base. She looked over the vast blue waters*\n\n&quot;Oh great. Dead end! But.. the Signatures are real close.. and where did the clone go to?&quot;\n\n*She rolls her eyes, and laughs. Teltoli wondered what the clones real name was, it would be a whole lot easier. She looks back up at Carnage for a second, with a slightly puzzled expression on her face*\n\n&quot;Carnage, when we DO find the Maximals, have you ever considered what your going to do after that? I mean, apart from killing Megatron?&quot;\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
