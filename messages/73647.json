Picking a fight by the ARK is suicide as we&#39;ll be SWARMED\n&gt; over by MAXIMALS before we can send out a comm signal.&quot;  He grins, &quot;But I do\n&gt; assume if they are buried in some sort of rockslide we will have all the\n&gt; time while they&#39;re focused on rescuing thier brethren for us to secure the\n&gt; area.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT remained in his beast mode then, scanning the are, &quot;If they come up\n&gt; aboveground, make yourselves scarce.  Our orders do not include being\n&gt; exterminated for no cause.&quot;  At least, not without WASPINATOR present.\n&gt;\n&gt; He shifted to glance over at HUN-GRR to see if the TERRORCON LEADER\n&gt; approved.  After all, he was the real one who could keep his &#39;enthusiastic&#39;\n&gt; minions in line now.  If he openly disagreed with DINOBOT, thier field\n&gt; mission would turn into bickering, which they could not risk so close to the\n&gt; enemy stronghold.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nHUN-GRRR was nodding as DINOBOT spoke although his optics never left\nthe tunnel opening. He and his TERRORCONS were also in beast mode,\nusing whatever protection it afforded them against being surprised.\nHowever since all of them were the rough equivalent of being\ntransmetaled it would not be a perfect cover.\n\nFortunately they were far enough away from the ARK that it could not\nscan them casually, although a directed scan might reveal them.\n\n&quot;Agreed.&quot; HUN-GRRR said with one of his heads, the other looked at the\nother TERRORCONS. &quot;Rippersnapper, Blot, excavate a tunnel and knock\ndown the Maximal tunnel!&quot;\n\nBLOT nodded, looking something like a a shark with legs and claws. &quot;Me\nBlot understand.&quot;\n\nOn the other hand RIPPERSNAPPER started to balk, &quot;What? We&#39;re not\ngoing to fight them?&quot;\n\nHUN-GRRR&#39;s other head turned to face RIPPERSNAPPER, &quot;We will fight\nwhen I give the command and not before.&quot; One of HUN-GRRR&#39;s heads\npointed back at the tunnel. &quot;The coordinates are here, but we haven&#39;t\nseen our objective. When we see that, *then* we can deal with the\nMaximals.&quot;\n\nThere was a pause from RIPPERSNAPPER and then a nod, &quot;On it.&quot; he said\nas he took off towards the tunnel, BLOT quickly following behind.\n\nOne of HUN-GRRR&#39;s heads looked at DINOBOT, &quot;I don&#39;t see anything like\nthe female said. If it&#39;s here it must be in the tunnels somewhere.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
