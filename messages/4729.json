Then \nwe will renegotiate our contract as was dictated prior to our official \nservitude to you.&quot; Dark One said, the Oblitercons taking a step forward.\n\n===\n\nManterror and Injector got out of their CR chambers in time for Bumblee, a \nfew missiles from the jet fighters having blew his left side wide open and \ncharred his face, put Double Punch in a CR chamber, climbing into one himself.\n\nInjector looked to Manterror.  &quot;Guess they couldn&#39;t do jack without us.&quot;\n\n&quot;Got that right!&quot; Manterror laughed.  Both headed to the bridge.\n\nInjector looked around, spotting Hell Beast.  &quot;Hey!  Bossman, we need \nsomething to do.  We&#39;ve got a lot of energy and we missed the slaggin&#39; fight! \n How &#39;bout we go shoot up the Maxis or something?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah!  Last time we were there just the three of us kicked around a dozen of \n&#39;em.&quot;\n\n===\n\nNemesis Enforcer looked to Zardus, &quot;coughing&quot;.  -Why in the Pit was I called \nup here?- he asked himself, via inner monologue.\n\n"}}
