The tsunami had been detected within a few clicks of\nAtlantis, and it had no doubt been obliterated.\n\nAtlantis, however was not the target.  Celeron had detected the\nmassive impact of a very familiar orbital, its mass and speed no doubt\nsufficient to cause such a tidal wave.  How strange that after all\nthese years, it had suddenly crashed.\n\nSuddenly, scanners picked up a shallow area which he maps listed as an\nunderwater mountain and a large reef above it.  At first he though he\nhad found something, but there was clearly nothing different.\n\nThere in the water, half a click out from the volcano, he spotted a\nlarge shadow underwater.  Pinging with the deeper scanners, revealed\nthat this was it.  The call of treasure was irresitable.\n\nCeleron ordered the pilot to begin a descent to the surface.\n\n"}}
