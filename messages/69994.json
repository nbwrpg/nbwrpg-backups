I&#39;d like you to be with me as well as Depthcharge and the others, be=\r\ncause I want them to see the same thing. If we show compassion to those who=\r\n are otherwise cast asside, because they aren&#39;t good enough, we can make fr=\r\niends out of enemies. Okay, let&#39;s go see if this works.

Okay, everyone, this is what I hope to accomplish.. Nightstrik=\r\ne may be a minion, but Unicron doesn&#39;t value his minions like we value each=\r\n other. I doubt he&#39;s ever been shown appreciation for his talents and abili=\r\nties. And I have a feeling he&#39;s been given false promises. I&#39;d like to try =\r\nand talk to him, on a neutral basis, because even though he doesn&#39;t work fo=\r\nr Hydras, he may just have some understanding about Predacon technology tha=\r\nt may come in handy if Night Shift isn&#39;t able to get the information on his=\r\n end, due to the level of risk he&#39;s taking. I don&#39;t want him to go over his=\r\n head on something. If he needs to abandon the mission, please, inform him =\r\nthat I have nothing against it. In fact, I hope he realizes when it does be=\r\ncome too dangerous to pull out. So this way, if he can&#39;t get it, at least I=\r\n might have a chance to get it on my end.

It might not.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He escorts Talon \noutsid=\r\ne, holding her hand.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Okay guys, sorry about \nth=\r\nat.. I had a slow leak in two tires and I had a heck of a time finding \nspa=\r\nres.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&quot;Thought so. Kinda is hard ta find tires for a big guy like you.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson now looks to the others as he also transmits t=\r\no Lord \nElder.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; First, I&#39;m also transmitting to=\r\n Lord Elder \nand Kup, and guys, sorry about earlier, I didn&#39;t mean to scare=\r\n you. Okay, \neveryone, this is what I hope to accomplish.. Nightstrike may =\r\nbe a minion, but \nUnicron doesn&#39;t value his minions like we value each othe=\r\nr. I doubt he&#39;s ever \nbeen shown appreciation for his talents and abilities=\r\n. And I have a feeling he&#39;s \nbeen given false promises. I&#39;d like to try and=\r\n talk to him, on a neutral basis, \nbecause even though he doesn&#39;t work for =\r\nHydras, he may just have some \nunderstanding about Predacon technology that=\r\n may come in handy if Night Shift \nisn&#39;t able to get the information on his=\r\n end, due to the level of risk he&#39;s \ntaking. I don&#39;t want him to go over hi=\r\ns head on something. If he needs to \nabandon the mission, please, inform hi=\r\nm that I have nothing against it. In fact, \nI hope he realizes when it does=\r\n become too dangerous to pull out. So this way, \nif he can&#39;t get it, at lea=\r\nst I might have a chance to get it on my end. I&#39;m \nbegining to think that m=\r\naybe I may have to resort to plan B after all.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Rat Trap swallows.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; So, Night \nShift might not=\r\n make it?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson shakes his \nhead.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I highly doubt it. It was a very risky \nproposition and I d=\r\non&#39;t know why I even let him do it.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap s=\r\nalutes Tucson Prime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Tucson Prime, I \nhereby v=\r\nolunteer my little rat aft ta a call of dangerous rescue duty. If I got \nya=\r\n outa there before I can do it for Night Shift.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n \nTucson looks to him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I can&#39;t ask you to do th=\r\nat Rat \nTrap. You almost lost your life back there, I can&#39;t have that hang =\r\nover my head, \nabsolutely not. We&#39;ll see how it plays out. He may be able t=\r\no get out of there, \nbut if he puts in a distress call, I&#39;ll assemble a res=\r\ncue team for the job. All \nright, let&#39;s do this. Lord Elder, Kup, I will in=\r\nform you of my status after I&#39;ve \nconversed with Nightstrike.
