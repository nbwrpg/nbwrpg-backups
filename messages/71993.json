However one thing would make itself\n&gt; ab=\r\nundantly clear to cybertronians almost immediately. All\n&gt; communications ap=\r\npeared to be out. All tracking beacons, com-links and\n&gt; signals had been cu=\r\nt off. For those inside the jungle there was no\n&gt; communication at all with=\r\n the outside, and to those outside the jungle\n&gt; it was as if TUSCON and WHE=\r\nELIE had just disappeared.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, interestingly enough, the sensors =\r\nof anyone with even a\n&gt; modicum of detection gear should be able to pick up=\r\n a low level &#39;hum&#39;\n&gt; of strange energy that suffused the entire area. Not a=\r\n force field but\n&gt; just an energy wave that was in the background of things=\r\n. To those who\n&gt; were familiar with it, the `hum&#39; had a Unicronian signatur=\r\ne to it\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nIn the jungle, the lion sleeps tonight.  And y=\r\net here Wheelie was, on full alert.  Slogging his way through the underbrus=\r\nh quietly.  Knowing that he was being stalked, but having higher priorities=\r\n on his mind.\n\nSensing the hum, not with his sensors, but over with his spa=\r\nrk now as he was being stalked.  At this point, quietly going over to take =\r\nout a few energon rations to ready over for whatever he was thinking of, aw=\r\nare of the signature moving along after him.\n\nThe jungle had a life and a v=\r\nibe of it&#39;s own.  Of the plants, the animals,t he moisture.  THe alien robo=\r\nts did not belong,a nd were not wanted here.\n\n&lt;OLD - JUNGLE&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The trek=\r\n that WHEELIE is on has brought him out into more open areas\n&gt; of the jungl=\r\ne. The canopy of trees has grown unusually thick meaning\n&gt; that the underbr=\r\nush has died back, leaving the floor of the jungle,\n&gt; while uneven, relativ=\r\nely clear of plant life. The area is dark, but\n&gt; not overly so, much like a=\r\n day in the open as the sun was setting, or\n&gt; perhaps behind dense storm cl=\r\nouds.\n&gt; \n&gt; The silence around WHEELIE was becoming more pronounced as he mo=\r\nved\n&gt; forward. He could see signs that larger animals had indeed moved\n&gt; th=\r\nrough the area. The bark had been knocked off or actual dents or\n&gt; cuts mad=\r\ne in the trees themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Twin optics appeared glowing from the shado=\r\nws but strangely enough\n&gt; WHEELIE is unable to lock on it with any sort of =\r\nsensors.\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nAt this point, noticing where the optics wer=\r\ne coming from, WHEELIE turned over to face them, casually chiming, &quot;Friends=\r\n find, look behind.&quot;  And then taking out his energon goodies over to hold =\r\nthem up in his hand, &quot;Bah weep graaagnah wheep ni ni bong.  It&#39;s the univer=\r\nsal greeting, or so they say.  Why don&#39;t you come out now and play?&quot;\n\nThe g=\r\noodies held in his off hand, as if offering.  So his plan was if the entity=\r\n was friendly, it would see the goodies and hopefullyb e relaxed by them. A=\r\n nd if it was threatening or moved in to attack, then he could use his main=\r\n hand to whip out his slingshot to use the goodies for an extra &#39;burst&#39; of =\r\nammo to shoot over at it for an added punch to get himself room to fight!\n\n=\r\n&quot;Why don&#39;;t you come out to play?  We can have some fun this way!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
