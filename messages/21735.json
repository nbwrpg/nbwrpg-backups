She could tell he wasn&#39;t in a good mood. But she \ncouldn&#39;t help but chuckle alittle. &quot;You need to wake up on the right \nside of the CR tank a little more often.&quot; She walked out of the lab \nand went wandering around the ship. She transformed into her knew bot \nmode and went looking for Lunarpine. She sensed his thoughts and went \nthrough the ship looking for him. She found him and FoxFingers \ntogether. She smiled,&quot;Hello all. I finally got things worked out.&quot; \nShe picked up FoxFingers with her Telekenesis and floated him over to \nher. She smiled and shook his hand. &quot;Hello there. I&#39;m Ice. Pleased to \nmeet you.&quot; She set him down and looked over at Lunarpine. &quot;How are \nyou feeling. I wanted to thank you for saving my life, again.&quot; she \nsmiled and chuckled slightly. &quot;You know, you have this habit of \nsaving my hide. I hope that oneday, I can return the favor.&quot; She \nprojected this thought into his head,&quot;My love.&quot; so FoxFingers \ncouldn&#39;t hear it.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis awoke in a start.&quot;Ice, please don&#39;t do that to me while I&#39;m\n&gt; sleeping.&quot; He lay back again but couldn&#39;t fall back to \nsleep. &quot;Alright you\n&gt; win, I&#39;m on my way.&quot; His chamber opened up and he stepped out. He \nwasn&#39;t\n&gt; fully functional yet. he was beginning to wonder if giving her this \nbody was\n&gt; a mistake. She was the bear but it was him that was fealing grumpy \nat the\n&gt; moment. He stepped to the replicator and created a reboost compound \n(Roboyic\n&gt; coffee) he sucked it down and proceeded to the lab. He stepped in \nand saw\n&gt; the mess that the drones had created. &quot;Should I even bother to ask \nwhat went\n&gt; on in here?&quot; He saw the two drones on the floor. &quot;Never mind, I \ndon&#39;t want\n&gt; to know.&quot; He proceeded to the computer to see what the scans for \nthe night\n&gt; had read. &quot;It seems you had a strong ECG reading for the night.&quot; \nAgain the\n&gt; old science bot checked the mess in the room. &quot;Which would explain \nthis\n&gt; mess.&quot; He checked all the readings multiple times to be sure of the \nresults.\n&gt; &quot;It seems the virus is out of your system, you&#39;re free to go outside\n&gt; whenever you like. &quot;Preferably ASAP.&quot; his thoughts weren&#39;t easy to \nhide as\n&gt; he started programming the other drones to clean up the mess.\n&gt; \n&gt; After his job was complete he decided that since he was already \nawake he&#39;d\n&gt; check the DNA that foxfingers hsd brought back. he had a grizzly \nbear, a\n&gt; wolf, and an extremely powerful raptor. those deffinitely had\n&gt; possabilities.The Dragon cells were an odd addition and (Whatever \nTavatron\n&gt; turned into) could be set aside for now. He decided to start with \nthe\n&gt; raptor. he programmed another protoform and began the procedure. He \ntried to\n&gt; deprogram the parts of the DNA that were Transmetal2 technology. As \nan\n&gt; experiment he injected the virus once again. If Primes prophecy was \nto\n&gt; become a reality he&#39;d need to make creatures to fit the \ndescription. &quot;All\n&gt; would become one&quot; and Translife and organics would join.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 21, 2000 6:44 AM\n&gt; Subject: IceBird\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As she woke up, the drones stopped moving and fell to the floor.  \nShe\n&gt; &gt; got up and stretched and yawned.
