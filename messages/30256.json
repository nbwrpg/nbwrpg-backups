Her animal DNA was dissolving away from her robotic \nanatomy.  Soon, all would be left of her was a bot with no beast mode.  Her \ntracking beacon still pinged on. She thought she heard HotRod on her \ncommlink, but with her mind being ravaged by pain, she dismissed it as her \nimagination running wild.\n\n::KitKat::\nShe smiled at Darkmouse who sat across from her at the table.  &quot;He&#39;s alive. \nThat&#39;s one thing in our favor.&quot;  She responded to Drillbit. &quot;Hello there. I \nwill need your assistantce in the mess hall. Can you come and talk for a \nbit?&quot;\n\n\n::GoldenEye::\n&quot;Hey, Dollen. Long time no hear from. So what&#39;s the latest on things? Sorry, \nbut I just got back from vacation and well, I&#39;m rearing to go back to work.&quot;\n\n---------------------------------------\n&gt;::Hot Rod::\n&gt;\n&gt;He stoped working, and opened a comm.\n&gt;&quot;Feline, Its Hot Rod. I know we havn&#39;t been on good terms since I left\n&gt;the Alliance, but I&#39;d like to patch things up. And maybe bring back the\n&gt;feelings we had for each other.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;::DrillBit::\n&gt;\n&gt;He returned to the BlackFortress. He was pleased with how he had been\n&gt;doing as Commander of the Pack. He then got the message from KitKat.\n&gt;&quot;KitKat?! This is impossible! Where are you love?&quot;\n&gt;The voice of his lover brought over welming joy. It also brought\n&gt;memories, of how he got command. KitKat had been killed by the Alliance.\n&gt;Megatron tryed to take over, but he had gotton the pack behind him, and\n&gt;allied with KillFest.\n&gt;\n&gt;::Epyon::\n&gt;\n&gt;He was about to tell IR about the battle him and Angel Prime had been\n&gt;in, but then Prowl and another walked in. He turned to Prowl.\n&gt;&quot;Hey. What is it?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;::Dollon::\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;I was going to ask you two that. Where is everyone?&quot; He replyes to\n&gt;GoldenEye and Dark Mouse.\n&gt;\n&gt;::Demolition::\n&gt;\n&gt;He stands around with the War Machines, out front the CF.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
