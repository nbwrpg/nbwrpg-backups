This was pathetic of the \nMaximals.  \n&gt; He fired off two missiles down at the Ark.  He recieved the \nPredacon \n&gt; transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Hmmm...cannon fodder for the Maximals, excellent- he thought to \nhimself.  \n&gt; Activating his own comm. systme, he sent a reply transmission to \nthe \n&gt; Predacons.  &quot;Go ahead and come, I will inform my subordinats.&quot; he \nsaid, soon \n&gt; sending transmissions to the other Oblitercons and the Alliance \nbase.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scavenger pulled to the side, Rodimus missing him.  He activated \nhis comm. \n&gt; system.  &quot;Hey, Pyro, someone wants to play chicken!&quot; Scavenger \nyelled as he \n&gt; opened fire with a barrage of 20 explosive shells on the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Excellent!&quot; Pyro replied, heading for Rodimus Prime, firing off \nthree fire \n&gt; balls at the robot in vehicle mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Breakdown felt more shots hit and was ready to transform out of his \ncurrent \n&gt; mode.  He fired off an explosive shell at the Ark, laughing as the \nshell blew \n&gt; up.  He transformed into his robot mode, grenade launcher at the \nready.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hiss slowly got up,  crawling to his missile launcher, picking it \nup.
