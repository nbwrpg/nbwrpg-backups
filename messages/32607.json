The two large and destructive robots looked at the \nStunticons then the robot in the pod. &quot;Status report Wildrider&quot; \nMotormaster&#39;s emotionless voice boomed. &quot; Well this Decepticon pod got \nshot down, but her circuitry is damaged, and she dosent remember who \nshe is sir&quot; Wildrider said steping back. &quot;Hmmmmm&quot; Megatron \ncontemplated. &quot;Get into the ship&quot; he ordered to her. &quot;Motormaster, you \nwait for the other Stunticons to arrive, then head towards the CF&quot;. \nMegatron then enters Astroblast again, &quot;You will fly me to the CF, \nthen you will return to base, understood?&quot; He asked Astroblast, and \nthen waited for Cepta. \n\n&quot;Switchblade, you ride with me&quot; commanded Motormaster.\n\n\n\n"}}
