Aww pits over slag!  Could we for once,\n&gt; have the chance ta get the upper hand?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a slight chuckle from LORD EDLER, &quot;If it were easy then they\nwouldn&#39;t call Maximals heroes.&quot; He stepped foward, &quot;But it&#39;s going to\nbe up to us to save the day.&quot;\n\nWING CALIBER walked back from the shuttle back to the area where the\nrest of them were standing. &quot;The last I heard he had the ship called\nthe Dinosaur. For some reason his men tended to have a dinosaur motif\nto them.&quot; CALIBER shrugged slightly. &quot;If he still has the ship, it\nmight be in that jungle area.&quot;\n\nELDER nodded, &quot;It is certainly big enough to hold his ship.&quot;\n\n&quot;That jungle will eventually be large enough to encompass several\nconntries in what will be later known as Central America.&quot; LEGACY said\nin his cold tones. &quot;It is large enough to hold that ship and hide it\nfrom our sensors. From our initial scans that Jungle, at least that\nfoward area is producing a wave effect that resembles a Unicronian\nenergy signature. It has the affect of blocking standard comlink\nsignals as well as inhibiting scanning beams.&quot;\n\nELDER furrowed his brow as if trying to remember something, then he\nshook his head. &quot;A ship could bve in there and hidden well, but I have\nbeen watching for quite some time now. I don&#39;t have any record of a\nship as large as the Dinsaur is reputed to be landing on Earth.&quot;\n\nAs they talked LEO PRIME walked into the room, &quot;Alright men strap on\nyour gear and let&#39;s get ready.&quot;\n\nWOLFGANG and RAMULUS were helping NIGHTSHIFT to get to the CR chamber\nas the LEO had entered. &quot;You&#39;re not going to use that shuttle.&quot;\nWOLFGANG said. &quot;It&#39;s going to need some repairs.&quot;\n\nLEO nodded, &quot;No, we are going to use mine.&quot;\n\nJust outside of the Ark a ship seemed to almost materialize as its\ncloak disappated, revealing the ship the LEO PRIME and his crew had\narrived on. The ship was alrady starting to glow as its engines\npowered up and a ramp began to lower.\n\n(LEO&#39;s Ship: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/54620451/pic/1078733870/view)\n\nTurning to the others LEO PRIME spoke, &quot;Legacy, stay here and take\ncharge of the Ark until Polar Claw is full repaired.&quot;\n\n&quot;Straightshot, Quickstride, Rat Trap&quot; LEO called out. &quot;I will need\nyour skills on this mission.&quot;\n\nEven as he spoke TORCA and his crew were already boarding the ship,\nfollowed by SANTON and WINGCALIBER.\n\nLEO Turned to the others. &quot;Bump and Legacy will take care of the\nwounded until we return. Any questions before we lift off?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
