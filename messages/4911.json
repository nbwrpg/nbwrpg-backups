She sounded Predacon, thank Primus. He gave her quick eye \ncontact. She ran at the spot where Cheetor was twice. The third time, he saw \nhim rush out. He heard him growl, throwing his legs out to run. That was \nCheetor? But that thing was nothing but a pile of fur and spots.\n\n&quot;What in tarnation?&quot;\n\nBut after a few seconds some of it made some sense. Before the youth had a \nflight mode, being all metal, he was once a pure cheetah.\n\nHe ran after him. He fired at the youth, at his flank. But the shot went \npast him.\n\nHe saw the youth spin around and transform. He withdrew a gun and fired at \nthem. He fired at KitKat, then three times at himself. Quickstrike nearly \nstumbled. He almost lost his leg from the shot, but he managed to dash to a \ntree.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
