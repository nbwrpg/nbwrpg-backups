Admitedly Cryotek and\nBlackarachnia are tlak=\r\ning mostly to each other, but they have both\nposted that they are listening=\r\n to the general conversation as well.\n\nAlso Leo Prime had responded at the =\r\nend of my last post. I wasn&#39;t sure\nif you saw that one or not - some posts =\r\ncan have a lot of different\nthings going on in them :)\n\n- Preston\n\n\n\nOn 9/2=\r\n8/11, C &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You three will come w=\r\nith me&quot; hissed hyddras &quot;i need my most trusted\n&gt; warriors with me&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The =\r\nsnake-like heads moved around Hydras&#39;s heads as if they whispering\n&gt; things=\r\n to Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;adamsafran&quot; &lt;adamsafran@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; SKYSHADOW nodded to both VICE GRIP and=\r\n DINOBOT, &quot;Both of you have good\n&gt;&gt; &gt; points.&quot; He said, casting his gaze at=\r\n HYDRAS and noting the small\n&gt;&gt; &gt; serpentine heads that seem to peer back a=\r\nt them from time to time.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Looking back at the duo before him he s=\r\nmiled in a self deprecating\n&gt;&gt; &gt; manner, &quot;I am sure that might Hydras will =\r\nhave orders for us soon\n&gt;&gt; &gt; enough.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; VICE GRIP nodded ca=\r\nutiously.  As one of Megatron&#39;s followers on Cybertron,\n&gt;&gt; he had been a ra=\r\nrity - whereas many of Megatron&#39;s followers were low even\n&gt;&gt; wtihin the Pre=\r\ndacon caste system and mostly criminals, he had been a\n&gt;&gt; professional sold=\r\nier in the Predacon militia.  As such, his training was\n&gt;&gt; when faced wtih =\r\nan unknown enemy of great power, it was preferable to not\n&gt;&gt; engage and wai=\r\nt for circumstances to become favorable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nodding then to SKY SHADOW b=\r\nefore turning over to HYDRAS, &quot;What are our\n&gt;&gt; tasking orders then, LORD HY=\r\nDRAS.
