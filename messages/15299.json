Aren&#39;t they both guys?)\nStarscream\n\nStarscream watched Dollen go.\n\n&quot;Come back!&quot; but he knew he could do nothing. What was he talking \nabout before? But now things looked even worse. 5 of them had left, \nthe numbers were dwindling. Maybe it wasn&#39;t such a good idea to elect \nPhobia to lead. There were only seven left, and two of them were near \ndeath! Starscream pleaded again with Phobia.\n\n&quot;I guess will go with The Alliance now. If that&#39;s all right with you.&quot;\n\nThan Starscream whispered something in Drillbit&#39;s ear.\n\n&quot;Becareful. I don&#39;t know if we can trust Phobia. I don&#39;t know if I \ncan trust you, but most probably yes. I don&#39;t know if KitKat&#39;s safety \nis the important thing on his agenda. Remember, if you need me, i&#39;m \njust a comm message away. And watch Megatron carefully if you see \nhim.&quot;\n\nStarscream turned to the Alliance member.\n\n&quot;I guess I&#39;ll be going with you now.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix\n\nBrix lifted up Ramulus&#39; spark, and carefully placed it in one hand. \nOf course it was floating, but you get the idea. He removed Fliq&#39;s \nchest plate, and than got ready to place Ramulus&#39; spark in the body.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s just hope it isn&#39;t too late.&quot;\n\nBrix placed the spark inside Fliq&#39;s body and closed the plate.\n______________________________________________________________________\nThe Trainers\n\nA transmission came in from Ignatius.\n\n&quot;Lord Prebon! I&#39;ve spotted Savage two sectors down.&quot;\n\n&quot;Excellent Ignatius! Keep an eye on him and inform us of any moves. \nBlaze, pick up his scent and find the exact position. We&#39;ll soon have \nhim!&quot;\n\nThe 5 bots continued down their path.\n\n\n"}}
