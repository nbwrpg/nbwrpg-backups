They weren&#39;t flying, but it was as if they were about to. Several\n&gt; of them seemed to just now be becoming aware of Tuscon and his party\n&gt; as the queen herself settled back on the center spire of the room to\n&gt; watch her babies prepare themselves for something. Meanwhile more baby\n&gt; insectile creatures were emerging from still other caves.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We need to leave.&quot; Legacy said simply as he turned to enter Tuscon&#39;s\n&gt; cab carrying Rodimus and the trailing strands with him.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
