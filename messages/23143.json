Ice\n&gt; &gt; transformed to her robot mode, a bots head on a furry body with\n&gt; claws and\n&gt; &gt; Polar bear legs. she couldn&#39;t fully transform, this was as close as\n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; could come. &quot;I never imagined there were so many of us&quot;She thought\n&gt; as they\n&gt; &gt; entered\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Razor Claw transformed to bot mode and looked around. it was hard\n&gt; for him to\n&gt; &gt; fathom that one day he might be linked to one of these bots. If\n&gt; Veratis&#39;\n&gt; &gt; dreams came true there wouldn&#39;t be any factions, there would be only\n&gt; one.(No\n&gt; &gt; highlander reference intended.) He glanced around the room, all the\n&gt; bots\n&gt; &gt; looked more like targets than allies to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Razor Claw calm down, we&#39;re not here to fight, we&#39;re here because\n&gt; they need\n&gt; &gt; us, and we need them.&quot; she telepathically tried to calm him but his\n&gt; emotions\n&gt; &gt; were filled with fear and hatred for every bot in the room. A\n&gt; veritable fuse\n&gt; &gt; waiting to reach the firecracker, all he needed was an excuse\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
