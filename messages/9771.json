She \nwent to open the door, but it wouldn&#39;t open.  She pressed the button \nagain and again.\nThe door didn&#39;t open.  She stepped back.  Was it a Maximal trick? \nWere they going to keep her in here and fire the autoguns on her?  \nWere they going to kill her after all this time? She knew that Rex \ndidn&#39;t like her, but would he kill her?\nShe banged on the door with her fists.&quot;Let me out!&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Rex::\n&gt; \n&gt; Rex raises an eyebrow as Battera shuts the door in his face.
