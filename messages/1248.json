He knew Megatron and knew how \nto surive here? To him, Striker might as well be a rookie, with Sinesis. The \ngreedy fool. As far as he was concerned, he was leader.\n\nHe looked up at him, with his crimson eyes burning brightly. &quot;You? No \nway,tin-horn! Ah&#39;m in charge! And if Megatron is alive, let me hear it from \n&#39;im! Ya don&#39;t know nothin&#39;! Ah&#39;s been here longa than ya. Ah&#39;s seen weirder \nslag than ya, so ah&#39;m in charge. Who ya think ya are? Ah&#39;m one of Megatron&#39;s \noriginal troops! Ah knew that Rattrap wasn&#39;t nothin&#39; but trouble. Ah&#39;s say, \nah&#39;m in charge!&quot; He ducked his head at the pain at his leg.\n\nSuddenly, Quickstrike nearly had a spark attack, hearing a foreign voice, \nHiss&#39;. He jerked his head towards him, with his eyes wild. &quot;Who&#39;s friend?&quot; \nhe asked Hiss. Transulas, he was thinking. Oh, Primus, he hooped so. His \nvenom blaster iched to shoot this bot.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
