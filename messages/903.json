His foreclaw hurt and his head was still \nlight. Without saying a word to Transulas, he slowly crawls off. He needed \nrepairs, badly. This Tarantsulus clone wasn&#39;t doing anything for him right \nnow. That mad him mad. He wondered how the Predacons base was doing---if it \nhad fired, and if Hell Beast&#39;s troops were shelterless by now. The only way \nhe could find out was go there himself.\n\nHe gave Trantsulas a last look, in his head, picturing the Predacons base. \nHe wasn&#39;t feeling good at all. Maybe he could actually sneek inside the \nbase. The computer would never announce his presence, because it saw him as \nmaster and programer.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
