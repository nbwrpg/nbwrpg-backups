Let someone else deal with him as they may, I do not\n&gt; care this day.  He has not done anything against me, and my friends are\n&gt; beyond his grip I can see.  I do not care for this fight, for there will be\n&gt; another one in the coming night.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE glanced up and over at GRIMLOCk, &quot;And really, TERRORCONS,\n&gt; working for someone else seems so begones.  I really wonder why this day,\n&gt; you&#39;re just general thugs for someone else anyway.  Why not do your own thing\n&gt; as you may?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nHUN-GRR smiled, his grin wide and toothy. &quot;Oh yes, we work for someone\nelse now, we work for ourselves.&quot;\n\nThere were grunts and cackles from the other TERRORCONS.\n\n&quot;but imagine my surprise when Backstop here asked for our help in\ncapturing the Dinobots.&quot; HUN-GRR said as he looked at DINOBOT.\n\nGRIMLOCK looked at BACKSTOP and then at HUN-GRR and then at WHEELIE,\n&quot;You mean you wanted to catch Grimlock?&quot; The DINOBOT looked to be\nhurt, and that hurt shifting over to anger.\n\n&quot;No . .  not exactly . .  Grimlock!&#39; BACKSTOP stammered as he spoke,\n&quot;We had to slow you down so we could cure you of Magmatron&#39;s\ninfluence.&quot;\n\nHUN-GRR smiled again as he crossed his arms over his chest, &quot;You see,\nthis little section of forest belongs to the Terrorcons!&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
