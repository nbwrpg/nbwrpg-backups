Like a \nmeteor it \n&gt; &gt; screamed across the sky. The maximal protoform inside \ninstinctivly \n&gt; &gt; tried to salvage the ship. With little sucsess it crashed into a \n&gt; &gt; pile of sharp energon. A small shrpnel piece was jammed through \nthe \n&gt; &gt; protoform slightly oh so slghtly penetrating his spark. The \n&gt; &gt; protoform took the shape of a nearby Falcon, but with a \ntranslucent \n&gt; &gt; body that shined blue. Inside you could see the mechanics at \nwork, \n&gt; &gt; yet his outter body was the hardest material many had ever seen. \n&gt; &gt; Cryaltron pulled himself out of the pod and ran a \n&gt; &gt; diagnostic. &quot;Energon posioning iminent, spark in jeapordy, death \n&gt; &gt; inevitable.&quot; The shrapel still stuck out of his chest, he broke \nit \n&gt; &gt; off leaving a crystal like object infront of his doomed spark. \non \n&gt; &gt; his robot form shoulders were sharp extendesions of energon, as \nwere \n&gt; &gt; his fingers and feet. In his falcon form his wings were made of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same. His body was basicly made of hardned energon and the spark \n&gt; &gt; encased in an energon crystal, the spark slightly ever so \nslighty \n&gt; &gt; pierced in the front of it. &quot;How long do I have?&quot; came an voice \nof \n&gt; &gt; experience, his exact age was unknow but he survived many \n&gt; &gt; wars. &quot;Unclear progression unmeasurable.&quot; Cryatron \nsnarled, &quot;Slag \n&gt; &gt; it!&quot; He transformed into his Falcon mode. The sun shined through \nhim \n&gt; &gt; like a plate of glass...like he wasn&#39;t even there only leaving a \n&gt; &gt; rainbow under him as his trail. &quot;Any maximal in rage please \n&gt; &gt; respond.&quot; He flew off blasting his thrusters as well trying to \nget \n&gt; &gt; as far away from the  murderous energon as he could.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
