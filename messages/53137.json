He knows full well the \nobjections his fellows would raise if he gave them the chance; until \nan alliance is officially made, the Maximals are still enemies, and \ngoing alone into an enemy camp is dangerous.  But it&#39;s a risk he&#39;s \nnot prepared to shrug off onto someone else, and if the Maximals are \nto put their trust in the Rogues, they must be shown the Rogues are \nwilling to trust them.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yggdrasil thinks for a moment.
