She didn&#39;t need everyone \ngiving the same opinion over and over; she could think for herself \n(yes, intelligent females are out there somewhere..)! &quot;I know that, \nDepth Charge. I&#39;m not stupid.&quot;\n\nHer eyes narrow as Megaton asks Lunarpine about Veratis&#39;s motives. \nShe didn&#39;t know who Veratis was, but she would be sure to watch \nLunarpine and Ice carefully from now on.\n\n&quot;Depth Charge, stand down,&quot; she says, taking a step toward Megaton.\n\n&quot;My troops&#39; feelings coincide with mine, though,&quot; IR was now \nadressing Megaton, &quot;We won&#39;t scrap you, because Maximals don&#39;t do \nthat.&quot; Here she gives Depth Charge a small glare, &quot;But I don&#39;t think \nan alliance with your faction will not go down well. However, I think \nboth of our factions will be relieved at a cease-fire.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megaton glances behind him, Depth Charge stood just barely taller \nthan him,(cut off the ears and they&#39;d be the same height. &quot;I&#39;m saying \nno such thing Maximal, I merely said that if your group sides with my \nfaction I will assist you, You know, you claw my back, I claw yours.&quot; \nHe looked past Cheetor as if the catbot didn&#39;t exist, he tried to \nacknowlege the peeons as little as possible.\n\n\n"}}
