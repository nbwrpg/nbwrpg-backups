She \nlistened carefully to what he said next. She was seeking the truth; that was \nall she ever wanted. He didn�t have to worry about hurting her. The truth, \nno matter how harmful, was better than even the kindest lie. Well, that was \nhow she saw things anyway. She didn�t want him to lie and say some idiotic \nchauvinistic phrase just to shut her up. Tavatron�s breathing slowly \nreturned to normal as Dinobot backed away. She never knew how to react when \na �bot got too close physically. Sometimes it bothered her, and sometimes it \ndidn�t. Oddly enough when Dinobot was near her she felt fine, if anything a \nmild sense of comfort. Still, she was relieved when he backed up.\n\nTavatron watched calmly as he continued to speak. She appeared unconcerned, \nas if this was exactly what she had been expecting when in fact she was \nquite stunned. He really did care. He wanted to be sure that she was safe. \nShe could only imagine how much will he had worked up just to say that he \ncared! He rarely even showed it much less spoke it! She remained speechless \nfor the next few moments, unsure of what to say and how to say it. It just \ndawned on her how much she had hurt him by leaving his side when he was \ninjured. Tavatron looked away, she didn�t want to look at him right now. She \nfelt terrible. She was a disappointment, to herself and to everyone around \nher. Everyone she had ever known, ever cared for, was dead or long gone to \nsome far off space colony. They had abandoned her, whether intentionally or \nnot they had left, and she had done the exact same thing to Dinobot.\n\nThe wind had picked up again� it was blowing up small waves of dust across \nthe empty plains. Tavatron coughed slightly as she sat up. She had always \nnoticed little things like that. Especially the wind. After the incident on \nthe colony being able to predict the weather became a matter of life and \ndeath. If you didn�t know when the rains or the dust storms were coming you \nwere as good as dead. There seemed to be similar situations in the more arid \nclimates of this planet, especially the deserts. The sandstorms were very \nmuch like the old dust storms. Perhaps that was why she stuck to the forests \nand mountain regions. She hated open spaces, always had and always will.\n\nTavatron sighed again. She was ignoring the matter at hand and she knew it. \nShe was hoping to buy some time with her last question. She didn�t want to \ndeal with this. Not now, not ever again. She had fought long and hard to \nforget, but just couldn�t. The faces and facts of what transpired all those \nyears ago were burned in her memory, and no amount of reprogramming was \ngoing to erase them. Tavatron stood, her fur was covered in a fine layer of \ndust but was otherwise presentable. She quickly brushed out most of it, but \ncouldn�t reach that one spot on her back. The gentle cawing of the crows \ndrifted through the air as Tavatron turned in the direction of the CF. She \nslowly began to walk towards it as she spoke:\n\n&quot;We better get back to base.&quot;\n\nAfter taking a few steps she stopped, watching as a hawk drifted lazily \nabove. It circled once and then dove into some tall grass. She couldn�t put \nthis off any longer. Dinobot not only deserved an explanation but in part \nshe wanted to give one. Tavatron took a deep breath and continued, right now \nshe was beginning to wish she was that hawk�s latest meal. It was taking all \nthe will and courage she had and then some to talk to him about this. She \nwas hoping it was all behind her. Apparently, it wasn�t:\n\n&quot;I know there is no excuse for my earlier actions, nor should there be. I \ncannot change the past� nor run from it any longer.&quot;\n\nTavatron spoke the last part in a whisper. Her ears swiveled back and forth, \nabsorbing every sound. This planet held so many secrets, a pity she never \nhad the time to explore more of it:\n\n&quot;If you still desire an explanation you may have it.&quot;\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
