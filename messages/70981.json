When al=\r\nl is said and done, I&#39;d like very much to hear what you have to tell me. Se=\r\nnd a message for me, to Lord Elder, Stanton and Bump.  I want Legacy cast o=\r\nut of the Ark as soon as it&#39;s possible.  And if he dares to return, I will =\r\ndeal with him personally. After that, I want the Ark reconfigured to recogn=\r\nize him as an enemy.  Therefore it will secure your parameter safely, from =\r\nharm, if he dares to try to re enter the Ark. I&#39;ll let you have the honors =\r\nof reconfiguring the Ark to those specifications.&quot;\n\nNight Shift looks to Tu=\r\ncson.\n\n&quot;Um, you got a not so friendly look on your face..  What gives?&quot;\n\nTu=\r\ncson turns to Night Shift.\n\n&quot;Legacy..  I should have listened to Stanton an=\r\nd now, I&#39;m paying for that mistake.  He&#39;s beyraying us, and all right under=\r\n my nose...&quot;\n\nNight Shift puts a hand on his buddy&#39;s arm.\n\n&quot;Hey, you were j=\r\nust ben&#39; a Prime, you were givn&#39; &#39;em a chance, like any Prime would do, &#39;sp=\r\necially Optimus.  There&#39;s nothn&#39; wrong with that, hey, we can&#39;t all be perf=\r\nect...

Why d=\r\nidn&#39;t I make that connection earlier?  Anyway, right now we have to focus o=\r\nn what&#39;s most important, and right now, keeping everyone safe is the most i=\r\nmportant issue at hand.&quot;\n\nHe looks back to Kup.\n\n&quot;Kup, for now, let&#39;s do wh=\r\nat the voice demands of us, I have a feeling if we just play along, an oppo=\r\nrtunity will come to get out of this predicament... After all...  Someone i=\r\ns still on their way here..&quot;\n\nHe narrows his eyes further, and concentrates=\r\n deeply and this time, he attempts to contact Legacy.\n\n&quot; When I took the po=\r\nwer of the Matrix, I swore to honor my comrades by keeping them safe, and t=\r\nrust them as equals.  I gave you that chance, and you repay me by turning y=\r\nour back on my factions.  I will not tolerate such insuborination, and it i=\r\ns with that in mind, that I am demanding you leave the Ark  and renounce yo=\r\nur position among us effective immediatley.  You will not give Stanton, Bum=\r\np or Lord Elder any grief.  If I hear of your reistance, I will give them t=\r\nhe orders to terminate you on contact.
