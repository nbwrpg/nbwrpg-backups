I was bored and had nothing better to do.\n\n\n* Iron Raptor sighed with the feeling of Prowl�s hand brushing her cheek but then looked concerned again as it dropped, perhaps he was not as well as she had first thought. The sight of his repair system retreat into his chest was a relief due to the fact that it meant that he was fully healed; though she knew that he would be weak because of the energy used.\nIron Raptor watched his optics close and then re-open, the look of love in Prowl�s optics then made her relax and return the look�replacing the concern with love.\nShe nuzzled against Prowl�s hand as he then stroked her cheek again, then letting his hand push her lips towards his and then lock in a kiss. The notification of knowing that he was strong enough to kiss her gave her more comfort then anybot would ever know.\nIron Raptor raised to her feet as he did his own, ready to catch him just in case he was still a little weak and couldn�t walk on his own.  She heard his words but knew that she wouldn�t be able to simply repair, the base was being attacked again but this time by the Predacons�something that needed her attention.\nShe walked closer to him and put a hand on his chest where his spark cavity was, then sliding the hand around to his back so that she was holding him in an embrace. With a sigh of complete relaxation she laid her head on his shoulder as she held him, nice to have him in her arms again after such a troubled event.\nIron Raptor closed her optics as she relaxed against him. *\n\n� I can�t repair, Prowl. I have too much stuff to do. But if it makes you feel better I won�t battle until I do.�\n\n* With her other hand she then stroked his neck but then opened her optics, it felt good to hold him like this but it couldn�t last forever. With a reluctant sigh she then leaned back, the thought of being apart from him making her side flair up again. Growling she then bunched the muscles in her side, a silent command then causing a plate to emerge and cover the damage.\nWith a smile she gave him an extra squeeze. *\n\n� See? No problems.�\n\n* Iron Raptor then suddenly heard Plintissa�s soft �good bye�, the realizing that her old friend had been there. She glanced behind Prowl but couldn�t see Plintissa, wondering where she could have gone.\nWith a shrug she then looked back at Prowl and kissed him quickly before departing from the embrace, her hand lingering in his before letting go. Walking off towards the damaged quadrant of the ship she then looked over her shoulder but then back ahead, since she wasn�t battling then she might as well help with the repair�and thus help Prowl. \nOn her way towards the damaged side she then heard weeping, with a cautious approach she then looked in to the main room of the Ark and saw Plintissa. Why was she crying? But then it hit her, feeling a bit stupid of why she didn�t know in the first place. It was because of all the ill fortune that had happened to her. Iron Raptor sighed but then smiled to herself, maybe she could lighten things up a bit. *\n\n� Hay! Plintissa! Why don�t you come help us all repair the ship? You know? Lend a�tenticle, or two?�\n\n* She stepped closer a bit but then stopped, not sure if it had helped or not. With a sigh she then shook her head and looked back towards the scrapped area of the ship. *\n\n� I�m sorry if I seemed mad and all before, I was just�confused. You�re still my friend, you know. Just rough times, that�s all.�\n\n* With that she then looked back at Plintissa and then towards Prowl, but then began towards her intended destination. Then waving her hand towards her to let both of the bots know that they should follow. ( Prowl and Plintissa.) They had to get a move on if they were to repair the ship and get everything on line. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
