He was aiming\n&gt;his Sniper rifle at the crowd of a maximals.  He was there to assinate the\n&gt;President of Macrosoft.  The Presidents Name was Bill Setag(Gates\n&gt;Backwards).\n&gt;\n&gt;    Just Then Mr. Setag move to the left.  MadMoo looked through the Scope\n&gt;one last time and fired.  Setag Robotic Head Flew off as he fell to the\n&gt;ground, his Spark Failing him.\n&gt;\n&gt;    The Crowd ran around wild with the resent assination.  MadMoo got up \n&gt;from\n&gt;his place in the catwalks and ran for the exit.  When he open the Exit \n&gt;door,\n&gt;he noticed about 5 Cop Cars just pulling up outside.\n&gt;\n&gt;    &quot;That Son of a Rust Picket set me up.&quot;  MadMoo said to himself as he \n&gt;ran\n&gt;in he other direction.\n&gt;\n&gt;    He open an other door seeing police coming up a staircase.  The lead\n&gt;police Officer told him not to move.  MadMoo took out a smoke Gernade and\n&gt;threw it at the officers.\n&gt;\n&gt;    &quot;Get Down, its a Gernade.&quot;  The lead police officer yelled as his \n&gt;sqradon\n&gt;ducked down covering their heads.\n&gt;\n&gt;    MadMoo closed the door.  He found a Metal Rod and slamed it in the door\n&gt;handle, making it impossile to open.\n&gt;\n&gt;    MadMoo looked around where he was and noticed he was in a storage area.\n&gt;He grabbed a rope, blanket, and a Computer Printer.  He tied the Rope \n&gt;around\n&gt;the Computer Printer.  With the blanket he folded it up and put it in one \n&gt;of\n&gt;his storage pit.\n&gt;\n&gt;    &quot;Hmm, If I hold the Gernade for 2.3562 secounds then throw it the hole\n&gt;should be big enough.&quot;  MadMoo says as he takes out a gernade.  He pulls \n&gt;the\n&gt;pin.  Excatly 2.3562 seconds after he pulled the pin, he threw it at the\n&gt;roof.  Right as the very tip of the gernade hit the roof, it went off.\n&gt;There was a 11 foot hole(In Radius) in the metalic roof.\n&gt;\n&gt;    MadMoo took the Printer and threw it up at the hole.  It landed on the\n&gt;roof.  MadMoo then grabbed the rope and climb up it.  Somehow the printer\n&gt;held and he made it to the roof.  He then ran to the edge and jumped.  He\n&gt;quickly wiped out the blanket and used it as a Parachute.  He made it\n&gt;Saftley on the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;OOC:Sorry for not finishing this, I gtg.
