I didn&#39;t \nquite understand...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Polar Claw &lt;cycodrone@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Shadowcaster suddenly found himself in a plane filled\n&gt; with light, suddenly plucked from the nirvana of the\n&gt; Matrix. All around him was blingind white- the source\n&gt; of it appeared to be a being the size of the legendary\n&gt; chaos bringer himself. However, this being radiated\n&gt; something intense, but at the same time, this\n&gt; intensity seemed to be founded on infinite good. \n&gt; \n&gt; It took Shaodwcaster a mintue to realise who he was in\n&gt; the presense of and when he did, he could hardly\n&gt; believe it. There, in front of him, was Primus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Primus then began to speak, but in a surprisingly soft\n&gt; tone and volume for one his size.  &quot;Be not afraid my\n&gt; chosen one, for I have summoned you here for a purpose\n&gt; which is of critical importance for the future of the\n&gt; universe.  I know for eons deep down what you have\n&gt; wondered - how a Decepticon would become one of the\n&gt; greatest protectors of the Autobots in Cybertronian\n&gt; history.  The Answer is that it was by my hand. I was\n&gt; the one who altered your programing, you were chosen\n&gt; by my own intervention to be a guardian for those of\n&gt; my children who required protection.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadowcaster for the first time in his existence was\n&gt; speechless. How could it have been that he was chosen?\n&gt; Why him? He knew that he was the most advanced of the\n&gt; 1st generation of Transformers to be created but aside\n&gt; from his design, why him?\n&gt; \n&gt; Primus continued &quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking- why me?\n&gt; The fact is that aside from your design, your spark\n&gt; was that of a hero, a being destined to save, to be\n&gt; great. That fusion made you my choice as guardian for\n&gt; my Autobot children. And watch over them well you did-\n&gt; the war would not have turned out as it did were it\n&gt; not for your intervention.  I know that in the Beast\n&gt; Wars, you lost much that was close to you, but I am\n&gt; glad that you were able to join with the matrix, see\n&gt; what you were meant for, to be reniewed for the\n&gt; purpose you were meant for. Now though I have a new\n&gt; purpose- one far more perilous and crucial than any I\n&gt; have given you before.  I am sending you back in time-\n&gt; Unicron has contacted himself in the past and informed\n&gt; himself of his future defeat, and now tries to alter\n&gt; history.  I cannot intervene, however I send you back\n&gt; to fight for me against him.  I will give you your\n&gt; optimised maximal body, along with all the data it\n&gt; contained, as well as the ability to sense the matrix\n&gt; in any era you are in, along with its present location\n&gt; and its location in the time you are travelling to. It\n&gt; is on your shoulders that the fate of every\n&gt; cybertronian and possibly the universe rests. Go now,\n&gt; and protect all my children- Autobot, Maximal,\n&gt; Decepticon, Tripredacus and Predacon alike. Bring them\n&gt; peace, unite them.  Remeber always, you are my hands,\n&gt; my eyes, my tongue, my ears.... Remember always I\n&gt; believe in you.....&quot;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron cackled manaiacally ordering Dinobot to open\n&gt; fire as the Nemesis closed in on the volcano which\n&gt; would later be named Mount Saint Hillary.\n&gt; \n&gt; Optimus was in disbelief at what he saw &quot;By the\n&gt; matrix, if Megatron succeeds here, we&#39;ll all be\n&gt; destroyed.  Shadimus, you&#39;re in command! Optimus-&quot;\n&gt; Optimus was interrupted by Shadimus&#39; hand clasped\n&gt; firmly on his shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked into Primal&#39;s eyes, with the look of a\n&gt; martyr about to sacrifice himself unwillingly, but at\n&gt; the same time knowing there was no other way.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No! Your place is with those undser your command...\n&gt; This is no longer about revenge or vindication.... I\n&gt; know what must be done. Optimus, take care you those I\n&gt; have sworn to watch over..... Optimus Prime would be\n&gt; proud to know his name had gone to a more than worthy\n&gt; successor.?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Optimus tried desperately to persuade him otherwise\n&gt; &quot;Wait, you don&#39;t have to do this, there has to be\n&gt; another way. I&#39;m not in the mood to lose any more\n&gt; friends today!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Please don&#39;t make this harder than it already is. My\n&gt; duty is to protect the Autobots and their decendants.\n&gt; It has been an honour serving with you, but I cannot\n&gt; shirk my duty.... Til all... are one!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Before Optimus could react, Shadimus broke away from\n&gt; him, and transformed into his air attack mode, guns\n&gt; blazing at the predacon ship, destroying turret after\n&gt; turret.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Shadimus... NOOOO!&quot; Primal cried out, but he knew it\n&gt; was too late. The other Maximals looked on is respect\n&gt; but in disbelief, as if watching someone close to them\n&gt; fall out of their grasp when hanging perilously over a\n&gt; cliff. \n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron was less than impressed &quot;Playtimes over\n&gt; pussycat... Yess! OPEN FIRE, ALL CANNONS!&quot; The turrets\n&gt; started heavily ripping into his armour, faster than\n&gt; Shdimus could fire back. Knowing the specs of the\n&gt; Nemesis from millions of years ago, Shadimus knew what\n&gt; he had to do. &quot;Computer, disengage all safety\n&gt; protocols, program omega-1.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Acknowledged...&quot; reluctantly came the voice of his\n&gt; internal computer.\n&gt; \n&gt; With that he adjusted his flight path into a collision\n&gt; course directly at the bridge of the behemoth.\n&gt; \n&gt; The cannonse kept ripping him to shreds, the pain\n&gt; becoming intense, however Shadimus refused to waver\n&gt; &quot;Til.... all....... are..... one!&quot;\n&gt; With that the ripped a gaping hole in the hull of the\n&gt; Nemesis, with Shadimus seemilngy being atomised in the\n&gt; process.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: It&#39;s upto whoever ius playing the characters that\n&gt; were in Nemesis parts 1 and 2 as to their\n&gt; memories/feelings for that day. Especially critical\n&gt; with Rattrap who&#39;s Shadowcaster&#39;s son.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: Unknown to all parties, at that instant, several\n&gt; microscopic transwarp portals opened up absorbing\n&gt; piece after piece after piece of Shadimus&#39; broken\n&gt; body.\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Not far from the Maximal base, a submerged blank\n&gt; protoform begins to glow bright white, its form\n&gt; becoming unrecognisable, as several transwarp portals\n&gt; open up around the now seemingly formless protoform,\n&gt; the parts these portals have ferried merging with the\n&gt; protoform, as it begins to alter it&#39;s form, like clay\n&gt; moulded with unseen hands, over the course of a\n&gt; minute, altering form until with an ethereal glow\n&gt; surrounding him, Shadowcaster awakens.\n&gt; OOC: these protals would be noticable by Maximal\n&gt; scanners.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:Not wasting any time, he quickly scans the area\n&gt; for the Maximal Base, transforms into his air attack\n&gt; mode, then flys there at top speed, landing in front\n&gt; of the base. Once landed and transformed into robot\n&gt; mode, he opens up a channel, a wry smile on his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Maximal Base this is Shadowcaster. Let me just say\n&gt; that, while the Matrix was nice, it&#39;s great to be back\n&gt; among the living.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://personals.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
