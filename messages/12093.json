Raising his greande launcher with his right arm, he fired \noff a grenade set to explode on impact at Bluestreak&#39;s abdomen.\n\n---\n\nScavenger side stepped, a blast digging into his arm.  \n\n---\n\nHiss fired off a rocket at Torca.\n\n---\n\nDark One and Unitron flew in tight formation, each firing off a \nmissile at the Ark, two missiles heading for the hull of the Ark.\n\n---\n\nOinker screamed, sidestepping the chainsaw, but 16 bullets from \nRebelYell sent him sprawling backwards, catching all of them in his \ngut.\n\n-----\n\nZergling and Punch jumped to the side, crashing to the ground on \ntheir chest, not able to return fire at the moment.
