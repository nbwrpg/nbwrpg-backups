And don&#39;t worry, I make lots of mistakes when I&#39;m \n&gt; tired too.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Malice snored audibly, but not loudly.  He would occasionally \nroll \n&gt; onto one side, but generally slept well.  A few megacycles later, \nhis \n&gt; alarm went off, and he grundgingly crawled out of his hammock.  He \n&gt; slowly made his way to the mess hall to find a cup of energon.  He \n&gt; noticed it was exceedingly quiet.  That was due to the fact that he \n&gt; was oblivious to everyone else until he had at least one glass of \n&gt; refined energon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
