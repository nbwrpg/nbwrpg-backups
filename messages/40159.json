Cyberwolf has given me permission to take Megaton\n&gt; back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in time(trans-warptechnology can do that duh it was the whole\n&gt; point of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beast wars) so that he can attack Stallex when he was a baby and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; barely be saved by Mustex. That way in the future Mustex will\n&gt; have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rivalry with Megaton, Veratis his creator, and possibly all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mutants. This also explains why Mustex first downloaded his\n&gt; Datatracks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into Stallex(for a second chance if something should happen to\n&gt; &gt; him).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
