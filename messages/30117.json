Headshot and Legtrap got out\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Decapitron, then Decapitron transformed back to robot mode, and walked\n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the cave with Headshot and Legtrap close behind him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        &quot;Terrorcons!!!

They looked hungry.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Decapitron picked up Symphony&#39;s torn off arm, and tossed it to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Terrorcons to feed on, as well as some other bits and scraps of Maximal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;metal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        &quot;Chew on that,&quot; he muttered.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Cutthroat grabbed a small chunk of metal that had been torn from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Symphony&#39;s back and scarfed it down, then he piggishly started tearing at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Symphony&#39;s ripped off arm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
