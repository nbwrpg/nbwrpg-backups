Her itty claws clicked \nat the sides, feeling warmer when Starice spread her wings and cradled her \nin them.\nThe soft wings reminded her of mommy&#39;s fur and with the warm milk it was \nalmost the exact same, the only things different is that the milk tasted \ndifferent and she couldn&#39;t smell mommy&#39;s scent.\nBut she kept on eating, making little sucking sounds as she lowered the \nlevel of milk in the bottle.\nThe sounds of Starice&#39;s voice was comforting to her, soothing her with its \nsweet tone.\nShe was almost ready for sleep, and her paws left the bottle, moving slowly \nin tiny movements as she suckled.\nSo tiny, so soft and innocent. A round, rolly-polly puppy.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
