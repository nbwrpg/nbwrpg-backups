The\ngeneral agreement is that by the Beast Wars era TFs have evolved to\nthe point where they can do this. They no longer need Vector Sigma to\ngive life. It makes a lot of sense though. TFs have always been said\nto evolve, and they mimic humans in every other way. The only thing is\nthat Airly had Nightlight actually give birth to the child. Most\npeople speculate that TFs would merge their programming, or copies of\ntheir sparks when having sex. This creates a new spark for the child\nthat is carried by the mother. Then a body is built to put the spark\nin, or a protoform can be used.\n&gt;  CatMaster o &lt;catmastero@y...&gt; wrote:--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com,\nRichard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Well Roddy and Nightlight did the bad *cough good cough* thing\n&gt; and ended up with this daughter.
