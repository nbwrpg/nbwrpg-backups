Once he had a big enough hole he stuck his \narm out and used his energy blade to slash the tail off directly above his \nhead.  It was then an easy matter to free himself.  He mustered his energy \nand got out of range before Galvatron could regrow yet another time.  He \nplaced his hand to his sides.  First the left then the right.  He let out \ntiny amounts of energy to accelerate his repair functions.  He then did the \nsame thing to his shoulder.  He still had only one arm but at least now he \nwas in fighting shape.  All the time he spent repairing he stared directly at \nGalvatron so that he couldn&#39;t sneak up again. He then adopted a fighting \nstance to wait.\n\n"}}
