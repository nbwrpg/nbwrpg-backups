It was impressive, and a new \naddition to the team. The attack on the Allience was going to be a long \none....that was for sure. For the moment, though, Tarantulas&#39; latest scheme \nseemed to give the Predacons an upper hand.\n    &quot;I like it. With the sub, and a few of these, I dont see why we wont \nbreak their shileds and march right inside.&quot; Hell Beast commented as he gazed \nover the arachnids shoulder. He gave a half smile.\n    &quot;Hehe, yes, it should definetly shake things up. How is the submarine \nconstruction going?&quot; He said, all eight eyes on Hell Beast&#39;s now grim and \nsolid face.\n    He folded his hands, &quot;Oh, its going as planned, that it is.&quot;\n\n    Inferno buzzed through the sky in the loader. On board he carried the \nparts of Aracnia ship needed to forge the Sub. What remained left was being \ntaken to Kitkats base. \n    &quot;Inferno to Rampage. I am closing in on your coordinates. Im will begin \nlanding proceedures now.&quot; He said, and pressed in the landing codes.\n    The ship slowed and then began to slowly float down to the construction \nplatform. The parts inside the loader shook a little, but the stablizers \nleveled the vessle. With a successful landing, Inferno exited.\n    &quot;Good job Inferno. Begin construction now. I will start the generator.&quot; \nRampage said, looking down from the coomand platform. As commander of this \nmission, he was in charge of the sub&#39;s safety. And a shield generator was \njust the thing to keep unwated pests away and out of Predacon business. With \nthe flick of a few switches, a crack like electricity filled the coastline \nand the spiderweb like shiled rose around the platform.\n    Rampage then turned to Inferno, &quot;Good. Lets start&quot;\n\n    Tankkor pulled the skelteon of Aracnia&#39;s ship behinde him through the \nheat of the savana. In his tank mode he could pull a heavy load, including \nwhat was left of the ship. With his turret ready for fire, he moved on, as \nfast as he could go. \n\n"}}
