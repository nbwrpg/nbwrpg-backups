She fell \n&gt; forward\n&gt; &gt; and landed on her hands and knees. She turned her head, looking at\n&gt; &gt; LadyHawk, &quot;Why? I thought you were a friend?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk looked down at Squizzy, &quot;I am a friend,  but I can&#39;t \nrisk \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; science being turned into a weapon. She lowered herself to finish \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; mongoose but hesitated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Squizzy, felt sick to her stomach and light headed. She couldn&#39;t \n&gt; understand,\n&gt; &gt; why was this bot\n&gt; &gt; of science attacking her. &quot;I wanted to see the nature bots too.&quot; \n&gt; She fell\n&gt; &gt; down and layed on her side. She felt disoriented and fearful.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk saw her error at the next moment. she couldn&#39;t let \nZardus \n&gt; have the\n&gt; &gt; experiments, and she couldn&#39;t allow Squizzy to stay here either. \n&gt; she tried\n&gt; &gt; to pick her up when Najah attacked.Lady Hawk wasn&#39;t trained as a \n&gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; she was to wrapped up with Squizzy that she didn&#39;t see Najah \nuntil \n&gt; she was\n&gt; &gt; wrapped up in Najahs coils. Lady Hawk managed to get her talons \nup \n&gt; in time\n&gt; &gt; to block Najahs bite. Useing all her strength she held on for \ndear \n&gt; life,\n&gt; &gt; trying to break the snakes hold on her. &quot;Snakes were supposed to \nbe \n&gt; eaten by\n&gt; &gt; hawks, not the other way around.&quot; she thought as the snakes bite \n&gt; came\n&gt; &gt; closer. She looked back towards Squizzy, she hoped the mongoose \n&gt; could handle\n&gt; &gt; the snake for her unfortunately Najah had other ideas. One of \nthose \n&gt; ideas\n&gt; &gt; seemed to involve a Hawk dinner.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Najah started crush Lady HAwk&#39;s body as if he were a phyton. Lady \n&gt; Hawk was\n&gt; &gt; beginning to feal like a recycled can. &quot;Would you stop already? \n&gt; we&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; supposed to be on the same side.&quot; Somehow she knew that Najah \n&gt; probably\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t care about sides. She tried to squirm with no effect. her \n&gt; only hope\n&gt; &gt; was that someone on the alliance would pull the snake off. Najah \n&gt; tried again\n&gt; &gt; to bite her knowing that his mortal poyson would  do all work. \nThe \n&gt; half Hawk\n&gt; &gt; snapped forward trying to bite the snake. This creature needed to \n&gt; learn not\n&gt; &gt; to mess with royalty.\n\n\n"}}
