It had been dead for \nseveral hours. Aracnia was mournful because Darkmouse was a great soldier, if \nnot, in some strange and morbid way, her only friend left after the departure \nof Hell Beast and her old crew.\n    In the lab, Hell Beasts old lab, Aracnia hoped to bring Darkmouse back to \nlife. He left a large amount of Liquid Energon behinde and Aracnia tended to \ndrain her mech and replace it with the powerful fluid. If it worked, \nDarkmouse would be very energenic. She would most likely have a boost in \nstrength, size, and intelligence. It was risky, but she needed Darkmouse.\n    Alone, with the body, Aracnia inserted one tube into her left arm that \nwould pump out the Mech, and placed a tube in her right arm that would pump \nin the Liquid Energon. In any even, they would know if she would rise agian \nin an hour or so.\n\n"}}
