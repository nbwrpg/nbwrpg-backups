She glared at this disrespectful, \narrogant, \n&gt; self absorbed bot. She was about to lose her last nerve and let \n&gt; LadyHawk have it. She knew that she would have to go and calm down \nor \n&gt; scrap this femme. &quot;ZARDUS!&quot; She realized she yelled and immediately \n&gt; lowered her voice,&quot;Zardus, If youhave no futher need of me, I would \n&gt; like to go to my room for a bit.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She turned and walked off without waiting for Zardus to reply.  She \n&gt; walked about 100 yards down the hall before she gave in to her hate \n&gt; and slammed her hand into the wall. A loud bang could be heard all \n&gt; through the hallway.  Her fist left a small dent in the wall. She \nhit \n&gt; her fist one more time and then walked, very quickly to her room.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawks eye picked up movement behind her, Battera was \nfollowing \n&gt; &gt; carefully.
