Rodimus glanced down at the security monitor and sure\n&gt; enough noted Cyclonus standing with Nightlight, uncomfortably close!\n&gt; His hands clenched!\n&gt;\n&gt; He was about to storm into the throne room when Hydras&#39; call came through.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You Two Stop to Chit chat&quot;said By comlink Hydras&quot;Rodimus, you are in \n&gt;&gt; charge\n&gt;&gt; of Security, go to control Room and start your duties; Perceptor, I need \n&gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; to do some errands in throne room; Scourge and Darkhawk start to do \n&gt;&gt; Guard&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes sir.&quot; Rodimus said through clenched teeth, it was obvious that he\n&gt; was angry and tense, but something in him forced him to do Hydras&#39;\n&gt; bidding. Part of himself hated that, his optics glowed dangerously.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You will pay for this Cyclonus.&quot; he said mumbling under his breath.\n&gt; &quot;You had better not be trying anything with her.&quot; he said as he exited\n&gt; out of the door on the way to the control room. &quot;or we will be doing\n&gt; more than talk next time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course Cyclonus couldn&#39;t hear him. he hated that too.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
