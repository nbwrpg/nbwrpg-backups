Nothing but darkness surrounded him in his own privet little world, there were no images of war, no Predacons trying to kill him, and no mysterious feelings sneaking up on him. Just silence and the ever going darkness.\nYet, something seemed to break through the silence, a familiar tone...to muffled to be identified. It seemed almost comforting since it was so quiet, just as if a whisper on a late afternoon wind.\nBut soon that whisper began to form into a quiet sounding word, one in which he knew and recognized.\nThat word was his very name.\nIt seemed almost to be a question but a calling as well, calling him towards the world in which was full of death and destruction. A world that was even more familiar then the one of dampened dreams and fogy shadows that he knew so well, the world of reality.\nSoon the darkness began to fade into a blot of greyness and then into a seemingly blinding white.\nWith a snarl the white light disappeared into hazy shapes and dull colors, but even soon that came into focus and a furry leg came into view.\nDinobot blinked a few times but didn&#39;t bother to lift his head, his neck stiff from the snooze.\nHe yawned and stretched his forelimbs in front on him, finally digging his claws into the floor and then pulled them back with a grinding sound. He stretched his tail out to it&#39;s full length behind him but then curled it around his feet, he was groggy but still awake.\nDinobot then rested his head on his front limbs again but looked at the leg in front of him, he sighed as he then looked up at Tavatron. He gave a little half grunt/growl that meant two things: &quot;I am up&quot; and &quot;What?&quot;\nHe waited for Tavatron to say something as he laid there, flexing his muscles under his armor just incase he had to suddenly move quickly.*\n\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
