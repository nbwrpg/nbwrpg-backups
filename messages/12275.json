The screw\n&gt; ups.  Or mess ups.  Icdemon, &quot;Brooder and Steel open fire on the\n&gt; Alliance&quot; will not work.  You have to be more specific.  Next,\n&gt; Silverbolt and Stomper never went inside the Ark, so they can&#39;t fire\n&gt; on Punch nor Zergling.  And, another argument on that, in your post\n&gt; Archangel sealed the Ark BEFORE they got in.  Oops?\n&gt;\n&gt; Alloran, is Ratchet able to fire weapons while in his elephant beast\n&gt; mode?)\n&gt;\n&gt; (Also, RFA, do to a confusion in posts involving Serpentor and Shadow\n&gt; Wing&#39;s death, he may or may not have actually been able to go into\n&gt; the Ark (late posting may have interfered with that), so I won&#39;t post\n&gt; damage yet.  I suggest attacking another bot, and if Serpentor is in\n&gt; the battle, I&#39;ll post his damage and you may continue your\n&gt; illustrious battle for honor, ok?)\n&gt;\n&gt; The Oblitercons/Unitron/BH/Blastrage/Zergling/Serpentor/Punch/Oinker:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark One side stepped, blasts scratching his left leg.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hiss ducked, the shots missing him by inches.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Form Oblitertron!&quot; Dark One yelled, all the Oblitercons leaping into\n&gt; the air, a powerful magnetic pull slamming each of them together in\n&gt; odd shapes, a 45 foot high robot crashing to the ground, raising its\n&gt; arms int he air, yelling madly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;OBLITERTRON SHALL OBLITERATE&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Unitron ignored Oblitertron, having seen plenty of gestalts in his\n&gt; days.
