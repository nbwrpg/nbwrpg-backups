But YOU remember, don&#39;t let the featherhead get \nall the glory from now on. And if you aren&#39;t back by morning I&#39;m coming to \nlook for you.&gt;\n\n* Iron Raptor was just about to begin arguing once again when she heard \nProwls&#39; bosters power up, sliding her arms around his neck.*\n\n&lt; Fine.&gt;\n\n* Was all she was able to get out before Prowl took off, closing her eyes \ntightly, the air feeling as if she was constantly being hit by a wall. Her \nsensors detecting their speed, 100 mph!\nIron Raptor was almost basically plastered to Prowl, and it wasn&#39;t just the \npressure of the air either. They were high and going very fast, which was \nsending her speak thumping in her chest at nearly the same speed as they \nwere flying.*\n\n&lt; Prowl! Slow down!&gt;\n\n* There was no use in speaking because, with their speed, her voice would \nhave been lost.\nIron Raptor tightens her hold on Prowl a bit, opening her eyes slightly to \nlook into his face.\nBut then she heard his thought, and tightened her hold on him just as he had \ninstructed. But why?\nSeconds later she found out.\nThe ground was rushing up towards them, and she knew that Prowl was excited \nand all, but her spark nearly stopped from fright alone as he suddenly \nbankes up from the ground. Her mind seemingly consumed by the white hot \nlight which obviously resembled her fear.\nThis wasn&#39;t fun at all! It wasn&#39;t funny either!\nShe whimpered a little and shook visably, obviously it was clear that she \nhad been scared out of her mind.\nBattles she could take, beasts she could handle, even pain she had no \nproblem with, but heights....\nThere wasn&#39;t anything else in the world she hated more then hights.\nIron Raptor breathed hard and tried to calm her spark, finding it rather \ndifficult.\nHer eyes became a little wet but the air dried them before she had a chance \nto shed a tear, obviously desturbed.*\n\n&lt; Prowl...slow down.&gt;\n\n* That was the only thought she could get out, the remainder of her mind \nstill recovering from the extreme shock she felt moments before.\nShe hated heights, and Prowl had only made it worse.\nHow could she ever learn to fly if Prowl scared her witless like this?\nBut she regained her composure, even though her mind was still reeling. But \nfinally she decided that she didn&#39;t want her friends to see her shaken up \nlike this, her own body still physically shaking.*\n\n&lt; Land a ways from the site.&gt;\n\n____________________________________IRIS\n\n* Iris only watched as Prowl took off, knowing for a fact that Iron Raptor \nwouldn&#39;t like it one bit.\nThen seeing, in the distance, Prowl take a dive towards the land and then \ncontinue on his way towards the new ship.*\n\n&lt; Fool! &gt;\n\n* But then she looked towards Firearm as he spoke, narrowing her optics at \nhim from under her helm.*\n\n&quot; Knows how to fly, my tin plated ass! All he knows how to do is scare that \nwoman slagless!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
