It has been great training \nat the academy, and it has been an honour to command this \nmission. Regardless of what happens, we will try our hardest to \nkeep the Decepticon forces in check.&quot; He extends his hand to the \nelder bot, his eyes glowing warmly as the realization that he will \nprobably never see this place he had called home again punches \nhim in the nose. &quot;I&#39;ll miss you, and all of the other Autobots who I \nhave left behind.&quot; He awaits Ironhide&#39;s response. He quickly opens \na comm to JetV, &quot;Ok, start the engines, I&#39;ll be onboard soon, and \nI&#39;ll tell you when to launch. Just get the engines fired up. And \nremember, when we launch, make sure that the stealth cloaking \ndevice has been turned on.\n\n-----Meanwhile,\n\nBonecrusher joins the other Constructicons. &quot;So this is the ship \neh... not bad. Lets get going and destroy those puny Autobots.&quot; He \nstalks around impatiently, waiting for the rest of DED to appear.\n\nSoundwave approaches the group, &quot;Soundwave reporting.&quot; He \nwaits impassively for the rest of the DED to show.\n\n-----Several lightyears from Cybertron,\n\nAzafroth and the other Ikoto shimmer, as they await the begining of \nthe game. Azafroth rumbles to the others, &quot;Ikoto, prepare to initiate \nthe transwarp maelstorm. When the Autobots breach the one \nlightyear mark, then bring the maelstorm into existance. It will be \ndifficult to sustain for too long, so do NOT fail in your timing.&quot; \nAzafroth takes his position, and waits for the ship to launch, \nunaware presently that another group, the DED, are also launching \na ship to destroy the Autobot one.\n\n\nOn 18 Jun 2001, at 6:05, gunthers8@... wrote:\n\n&gt; ::Scrapper/Needlenose::\n&gt; &quot;I bleieve that is all...I do now believe &quot;The Finder&quot; is \n&gt; finished...hahahaha&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Needlenose followed Spinister in.\n&gt; &quot;Wow&quot; was all he could say about hte ship.\n\n"}}
