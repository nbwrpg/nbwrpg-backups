Sorry whenever I left last time, \nI went on a vacation then got back from a vacation then had the \ncomputer get a virus then fix the computer like 2 hours before I went \non another vacation then I came home and well got a girlfriend and \nlots of new friends and it was CRAZY so now after over half a year I \nfinally am able to come back.  So all I need to know is what factions \naround and who incharge and what can I do.  Since I don&#39;t think it \nwould be a good idea to clutter up this board with OOC chat then \nplease email me at hugar_twriker@...  Please and Thankyou.\n\n\n"}}
