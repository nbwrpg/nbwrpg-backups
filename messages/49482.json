Its \n&gt; like comin back home after a long vacation. Some of you may \nremember me some \n&gt; may not but im back and plan to have a little fun\n&gt; \n&gt;     Destructor&#39;s circuits came online. He had been in sleep \nunderneath the \n&gt; earth&#39;s crust for almost a year. His gears squeaked as they came \ninto motion. \n&gt; His optical sensors came online. His hand sprung from the ground. \nHe gripped \n&gt; hard and managed to pull himself out. His body was messed up pretty \nbad. He \n&gt; would need a new beast mode. He basically put himself into an \nautomatic \n&gt; restart his body turned into a protoform type state. The black \nlight emanated \n&gt; from him scanning for a body. It picked up a lion. He transformed \ninto this \n&gt; new mode. Except for his Lion from had a  a black mane. He ran up \nthe hill \n&gt; scanning for the nearest  predacon base. He sent out a distress \nsignal with \n&gt; his location.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Proto crawled out of his hole. His circuits had been frozen and he \nhad been \n&gt; stuck in-between forms. (For all those unfamiliar with proto hes a \nrip off of \n&gt; that terminator 2 thing) He took the form of  a hawk and flew \nthrough the \n&gt; sky. (When proto is in an animal form which he needs to do every \nday at least \n&gt; twice to stay alive he has no more than the ability the animal \ngives him) His \n&gt; dark spark pulsated for destruction. He sent out a call for a \npredacon base \n&gt; to pick him up. (whoever wants a new recruit just be the first to \nanswer.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Galvatron awakened. Much to the dread of the planets. His silver \ndragon \n&gt; mode shined in the sunlight. It had been a long sleep but he was \nfinally \n&gt; rejuvenated after his dreadful defeat by Optimus Prime. (in my last \nposts \n&gt; here me and another rpg&#39;er had a nice battle between optimus prime \nand \n&gt; Galvatron which ended with both thier deaths) Even the his great \nspark could \n&gt; not keep him down. He would stay quiet for now. He would wait and \nwatch the \n&gt; happenings of the planets before he reentered himself into it.\n\n\n"}}
