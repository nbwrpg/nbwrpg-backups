He grunted and groaned as he \ntoppled down the hill. Eventually he was able to get his feet underneath him \nand slow his descent, skidding to a rather abrupt stop just before colliding \nwith an extremely large bush. In the distance he could hear gunfire and was \nbarely able to make out the ouline of a very large ship. A ship!\n\n&quot;Diana! Do you see that?!&quot;\n\nHe pointed into the distance at the twisted hunk of metal.\n\n* * * * *\n\nHysteria:\n\nHysteria finished welding the new panel shut and moved on to do some basic \nprogramming with the computers. There were still a few bugs to work out, but \nas long as nothing exploded for the next ten minutes she should be able to \nget it fixed.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
