She was very suspicious of the situation, and had alot to deal \nwith right now. She was the lone defender of the ship presently, Megatron and \nhis goons were trying to get in, and she had to deal with that vermine trying \nto get in. The best bet at the moment was to stun him and place him in the \nBrig.\n    &quot;Sorry Quicky, I cant let you waltz around, not just yet at least. But, \nbelive me, I do apprechiate the offer.&quot; Aracnia said with her evil smile.\n    Then, with the pull of the trigger, she fired a missle arrow from er \nbowcaster at Quickstrike, programmed to knock him out for an hour or so. It \nwould give her time to settle things.\n\n"}}
