So now what?&quot;\nShe kept walking and following her nose.  She picked up the scent of other \nbots.  Some smelled like that thing in the lake.  Some smelled kind of like \nher, in a way.  She kept walking untill she came to a bluff.  She looked \ndown and saw bots talking.  One was a male and one was a female.  She \nglanced over and saw another bot in the trees. She crouched down and watched \nto see what would happen.  The one in the trees stepped on something that \nwent snap.  The male talking to the female seamed to hear the snap.\n\nShe just stayed down, didn&#39;t move and watched under cover of some small \nbushes.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
