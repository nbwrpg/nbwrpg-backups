She knew for a fact that if it was her she would arm the auto guns and have every one of her soldiers armed to the teeth and their weapons almost shoved up the Predacon&#39;s noses before she even looked at them. But that was her, Liono was a different story all together.\nIron Raptor then looked back at Prowl with a sigh, obviously she was very tired and needed to sleep more then to repair but this bothered her...very much. The look in her optics when she looked at Prowl told both these things, obviously stressing her a bit.*\n\n&quot; I hope that...we don&#39;t...just get a bunch of back stabbing bots...ready to cut our throats at the soonest...oppertunity.&quot;\n\n* The last of her words were nothing more then a muffled gasp as she suddenly felt her wounded side spring into a but of a painful spasm. But then she struggled and regained her posture, moving the door asides and moving even more slowly into the base and towards the CR chambers. She just hoped that an all out battle didn&#39;t break out while she was repairing, may the Matrix forbid if it did!*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
