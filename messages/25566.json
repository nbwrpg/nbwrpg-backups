Untill then, neither side will fire on the other.&quot;\n\nFZ looks back at Angel Prime, a small smile playing over his \nlips. &quot;Now tell me, Maximal, what did you gain by defying your \ncommander and opening fire? If you hadn&#39;t, we&#39;d be long gone from \nhere, and you&#39;d had your Maximal back and would be able to repair the \nothers. You simply delayed our departure, as well as endangered the \nMaximals. Next time, I suggest you listen to your commander.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl looks over at Hot Rod. &quot;I have no idea. The Alliance is no \nlonger firing.&quot;\n\nHe looks at Iron Raptor. &quot;Do we still fight? And I think we should go \nup there to keep an eye on Zardus&#39; clone at least.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster, Firearm, Grimmler, and Proto stop a little ways from the \nAlliance, looking at them suspicioustly and ready for battle.\n\n\n"}}
