It stood somewhat hunched on\n&gt; two feet, it&#39;s oblong head forward to maintain balance.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the right a snake alien made from Najahs cobra DNA coiled about five feet\n&gt; tall. Its forked toung dripping deadly venom suitable for melting it&#39;s prey\n&gt; before digesting it. It uncoiled pushing itself to it&#39;s full length of\n&gt; aproximately fifteen feet. A dark green crossbread of it&#39;s serpentine scales\n&gt; and the aliens armored almost shelllike skin reflected the light of the\n&gt; room. It flexxed a hood about six feet in diameter. &quot;An impresive sight if I\n&gt; may be so modest.&quot; Lady Hawk was torn by her accomplishment. She was\n&gt; fearfull for what these crossbreeds were to be used for, but she couldn&#39;t\n&gt; help to feel a small bit of pride based on the life she had just created.\n\n\n"}}
