You should know by now that \nthose pretentious Tripredacus have taken Cybertron and control it \nwith an Iron Fist. The refugees of the war, both Maximals and \nPredacons, fled to Earth and tried to work together. Fools they are! \nThey simply deny their true nature as heirs to the Decepticons!\n\nHe looked at Hydras straight in his eyes.\n\nVykos: We have to let news of Maximal failures reach Modern day \nEarth. We have to show our lost brothers that only they hold the keys \nto the future! However, I have only limited manpower. Even though \nWarghoul is powerful, he cannot do things alone. What do you think of \nmy little plan?\n\nMeanwhile, Warghoul identified the new Megatron. He gathered all the \ninformations he could with a thorough scan and compiled it in his \nhard drive.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Puppet Hydras::\n&gt; \n&gt; Puppet Hydras go inside and waited that Vykos let him sat \n&gt; down &quot;Well...
