As long as the spark could be saved the body wasn&#39;t \n&gt; important. &quot;Blaze, reroute his spark to a life support system.&quot; \nBlaze \n&gt; didn&#39;t say a word as she did what was ordered. &quot;Welder&quot; Prebon \ncalled \n&gt; and a welder was immediately slapped in his hand. \n&gt; \n&gt; After hours of extensive surgery, a little blacksmith work and a lot \n&gt; of sweat, a new foot was attached to Slayer. From the knee down was \n&gt; all new hardware. &quot;Replace his Energeon and reattach the spark.&quot; The \n&gt; hard part was over, now all that was left was for Blaze to stay and \n&gt; finish up. &quot;Report to me when you&#39;re finished.&quot; Prebon was pleased \n&gt; with his work, and he knew that Blaze could be trusted to complete \n\n\n\n"}}
