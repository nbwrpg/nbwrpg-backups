Looking from him to that brute Perndabot and comparing them, something in which Vlad was noticed right away.  So, just as he discovered that she had not fit in, obviously she had noticed the same for himself. In yet, he was a Predacon after all.    Shesta, once again, tried to go up and get attention from Antagony but Vlad held her back and gave her fur a slight tug. With that she remained at his side.        But with that Vlad decided that this meeting must end, since nothing of interest drew his attention and he was in no need of friends. Lift the lift of a brow-plate he looked past Antagony and in the direction of the exit to the Iron Fist, just what he had been searching for. In yet, at the sound of her voice his optics returned to her, though what had remained of any friendly behavior had evaporated. But by then the fembots attention had been drawn by Perndabot and his own smoldered though he quickly calmed himself and looked down at the hound at his heels. So, without a word he left the two transformers to whatever they may be fated to and followed Shesta to the doors of the Iron Fist.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
