Insolate the programs and install the other ones and\n&gt; partially unleash her memories; and speaking about her memories... If Kups\n&gt; observations are true then Her behavior could be a risk for herself and\n&gt; others; we couldnt afford sedate her again I dont know how much her health\n&gt; could stand it; If she Remembers you, you be able to calm her down enough to\n&gt; avoid any umpleasant situation cause she has strong emotional attachments\n&gt; with you and the other being that has stronger attachment is your Daughter\n&gt; and it&#39;s too young to put her in a risk...

They will need to be reorganized so that her\ncerebral cortex can access them.&quot;\n\nBump nodded obviously in agreement, &quot;Yes, but that will take some\ntime.&quot; He pointed to the screen, &quot;Some of these have degraded over\ntime. They will need to be restored.&quot;\n\nRodimus reached out a hand to touch Nightlight, but stops just short,\nnot sure if his touch would disrupt the scanning field that enveloped\nher. &quot;Can you help her?&quot;\n\nBump nodded gravely, &quot;Yes I believe when can.&quot; He turned to look at\nPerceptor, &quot;If we can get some help reversing some of this damage.&quot;\n\nLegacy remained silent, unwilling to venture a guess, there were far\ntoo many variable for him to make an unqualified answer.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
