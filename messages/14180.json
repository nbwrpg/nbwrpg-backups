He\n&gt; &gt; flew back but got up again.  Suddenly, he saw GoldenEye being hit, and\nnot\n&gt; &gt; retreating, still going after Deemos.  What was she doing?????  They\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t afford to lose a Predacon.  He couldn&#39;t afford to lose someone\n&gt; whom\n&gt; &gt; he cared for deeply.  He didn&#39;t know what to do.  Then, it hit him\nagain.\n&gt; &gt; Another image of the bot, the beautiful bot.  Danger....Still\n&gt; &gt; danger.....Then it told him.  Dollen looked at GoldenEye, going towards\n&gt; &gt; Deemos.  Yes, she was strong, she could make it.  He had faith in her.\nHe\n&gt; &gt; had to let her be, to make her own choice.  He saw Blender dragging\n&gt; &gt; Stronghold and Diskus.  Then he saw Airbomber, Infectra and Time Warp,\nand\n&gt; &gt; Zava come along.  OH NO!!!!!!  THESE MAXIMALS AND CHOSEN ONES WERE\nFUCKIN\n&gt; &gt; ASS LUNATICS!!!!!!!(Please excuse my anger in its own language)  Dollen\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t take it any more, he wipped out his missile gun, fired 1\nmissile\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; Deemos, 1 missile at Blender, 1 missile at Airbomber and 1 missile at\n&gt; Zava,\n&gt; &gt; screaming in rage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
