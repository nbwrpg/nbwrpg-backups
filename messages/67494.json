PM=\r\n to my hotmail address if you want to\nset anything specific for her.\n\n--- I=\r\nn nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The trooper ar=\r\nrived shortly with his data from the hospital. \nObviously he\n&gt; had some tro=\r\nuble getting the data as all the doctors that had been\ntreating\n&gt; Creep had=\r\n had their sparks torn from their chests and eaten. \nCeleron, while\n&gt; annoy=\r\ned by the delay, was very appreciative of the delay.\n&gt; \n&gt; After viewing the=\r\n data, he came to the realization that there was\nsome sort\n&gt; of containment=\r\n leak within her spark which caused energon to flow\nout of her\n&gt; system.  U=\r\nnder normal circumstances, a transformer&#39;s spark would\nmerely be\n&gt; extingui=\r\nshed after its energy dropped to a level where the spark\ncould no\n&gt; longer =\r\nmaintain cohesion.  However it appeared that someone had\n&gt; intentionally ro=\r\nuted an energy conduit directly from her mouth right\ninto a\n&gt; battery-like =\r\nobject next to her spark; allowing her to feast on other&#39;s\n&gt; sparks to keep=\r\n her own intact.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether this had been done as a temporary measure to =\r\nkeep her alive,\nor as a\n&gt; means to make her kill, and kill often; the Bushi=\r\ndo Predecons couldn&#39;t\n&gt; sustain her needs for energy even if they emptied a=\r\nll the prisons in the\n&gt; Valley Mine Pentatron.  Celeron estimated that she =\r\nwould have had to eat\n&gt; approximately one spark every two days and that the=\r\n battery could\nsustain a\n&gt; charge of at least 4 sparks, giving her a little=\r\n over a week or\nabout 200\n&gt; megacycles to roam before needing to kill again=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; *From the data, he determined two things:*\n&gt; 1. He would first need =\r\nto generation some sort of substitute energon\npower\n&gt; to feed into her spar=\r\nk so she wouldn&#39;t need to eat other people&#39;s\nsparks and\n&gt; he could keep her=\r\n well-fed while he tried to come up with a solution.\n&gt; 2. He would eventual=\r\nly need to figure out where this leak was and\nrepair it;\n&gt; then finally rem=\r\noving the conduits that allowed her to eat sparks in the\n&gt; first place.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; He had never done surgery, but it didn&#39;t really bother him that he\nwould =\r\nbe\n&gt; working on a living being.  Perhaps he might even have the time to mak=\r\ne\n&gt; some, &quot;enhancements&quot; to her design, that is, if Kratos would let\nhim.  =\r\nHe\n&gt; typed up all this data and sent it to Kratos.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Celeron to Kratos,=\r\n I have determined that I need to perform surgery\non our\n&gt; hungry friend.  =\r\nI wanted to make sure that it was alright if I\noperated on\n&gt; her.  I am sen=\r\nding a report to you now,&quot; he said, realizing that he\nprobably\n&gt; didn&#39;t rea=\r\nlly need permission to do anything, but he always thought\nit wise\n&gt; to resp=\r\nect the leader.  &quot;Also, I was wondering if you would be\ninterested in\n&gt; me =\r\nadding some devices and weapons to her frame after I correct the\nproblem\n&gt; =\r\nwith her spark.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 2, 2007 5:56 PM, Nic &lt;warriorazure@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Creep was still.
