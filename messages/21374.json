He looked back and saw her concentration. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he\ntransformed to bat mode and started to flap his wings. he flew higher then\nbehind her to land. &quot;You&#39;ll never gain control if you keep playing.&quot; He&#39;d\nsuspected this possability since she started moving her protoform. &quot;Now go\ntake a nap and I&#39;ll get back to you in the morning.&quot; Hetransformed back to\nrobot mode stepped back to his computer and went back to work.\n\n&quot;Such disrespect for her creator humph.&quot; he thought, &quot;Lady Hawk would&#39;ve\nnever shown such disrespect to me.&quot;\n\nIn the makeshift training room Lunarpine and Foxfingers traded barbs and\ntags as they worked. A call came through over the link. &quot;Time for a little\nRejuvination.&quot; Veratis&#39; voice chimed in a commanding way to the two bots.\nLunarpine stopped running as he listened. Foxfingers lunged forward trying\nto take advantage of the wolfs vulnerable state. Lunarpine spun and caught\nthe fox in mid leap. &quot;Nice try Fox, to bad I&#39;m just a little to smart for\nthat. Foxfingers transformed back to robot mode, &quot;Look down.&quot; Lunarpine did\nas the fox requested and saw a detonator attached to his waist. &quot;Tag Wolfy&quot;\nthe fox taunted &quot;I win.&quot; Lunarpine dropped the fox pestered by the\ndetonator. He pulled it off and tossed it back to the fox. &quot;Not to bad, I&#39;ll\nknow better next time.&quot; he left the room and proceeded to the quarters that\nVeratis had assigned to him. Foxfingers returned to his and retired for the\nnight.\n\nVeratis stretched his wings again as he stepped in his chamber. He&#39;d been\nworking far to much for an old bot, he needed rest badly, He&#39;d have plenty\nof time to work in the morning. He looked back toward the lab remembering\nthe samples Foxfingers had brought from the maximals. He still didn&#39;t know\nabout the fox&#39;s adventure in the Predacon base. He thought about Lady Hawk,\nwherever she was she was in trouble or she&#39;d have returned by now.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
