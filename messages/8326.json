Who here has the best hearing? Put your ear to \nthe wall.  See if you can hear me through his commlink.  That is \nassuming it&#39;s working. Maybe one of us can hear it through the wall. \nTerrorsaur, turn up your scanner, it may pick him up while his \ncommlink is open.&quot;  She yelled into her commlink.\n&quot;COMMANDER QUICKSTRIKE!! DO YOU READ ME?!&quot;  She turned up the volume \non her link as high as it would go so it would come in louder on \nQuickstrike&#39;s end.  She hoped he had his commlink open.  She pressed \nher ear to the wall and called out again on her link.&quot;CAN YOU HEAR ME \nCOMMANDER?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Terrorsaur:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Terrorsaur stopped, taking a moment to check his scanners. Rowdy \nWolf nearly \n&gt; bumped into his back-side. He turned a glance at him, then went \nback to his \n&gt; scanners. He frowned, trying to figure them out.\n&gt; \n&gt; I...I don&#39;t know where he is.&quot; he said. &quot;My scanner&#39;s are going hay-\nwire.&quot; \n&gt; He shook his head. &quot;But, I think we&#39;re near-by.&quot; He said to Drill-\nbit: &quot;Just \n&gt; keep going, we should hit an entrance.&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
