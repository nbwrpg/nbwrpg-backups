But we are not doing this to \nkill Deemos. IF, and only if, we have to kill him it must be done in \nself defense.  We also will have no arguing over who to kills him, \nlike barbarians.  Aerotaur, Sarge.  You two will share leadership in \nthe attack.  You will learn teamwork.  You will also both train \nTrinity, Aerotaur because you know her, and Sarge, because you \ndon&#39;t. &quot;\n\nAs Birdbot and Papertron flew in he felt the vibrations as Birdbot \nflew at Trinity and Papertron aiming at her.  With a snap of either \nwrists two whips flew out made of pure energon. One at Birdbots leg \nto try and grab it and another at the weapon Papertron was \nholding.  &quot;Thank you for coming you two.  They are your responsibilyt \nSarge, don&#39;t forget that.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Nightlight/Trinity/Windlord::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What?&quot; said Nightlight&#39;s shocked.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Will you teach me  to fight, Uncle Aerotaur?&quot; said happily \n&gt; Trinity &quot;Yoooohoooo!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Are you sure that it&#39;s good idea???&quot; said Nightlight to Aerotaur.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I can&#39;t see other way&quot;replied Windlord..\n&gt; \n&gt; Trinity was jumping around happily and when she see Parpertron she \n&gt; said &quot;What&#39;s happen with you friend ? &quot; she looked to Partpertron \nand \n&gt; she said &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Orchid with what thing Papertron are aimming Trinity?\n\n\n"}}
