Bots and cons or in this case Preds\nand Max&#39;s gain dominance and then lay the seeds for their own demise.\nThe con/preds too oppressive and the bot/Max&#39;s too repressive. The\ncon&#39;s often expand too far and fast and so are defeated by the ones\nthey conquered, the bots are often attacked through corruption,\ncreating the very enemies they saught to stamp out. In the end there\nare both examples of what extremes can do in their society. :)\n\nAt the moment we have just past the zenith of the Maximals and now\ndecay is begining to set in, their once white light is starting to\nturn a bit grey and in that darker forces are comming together &gt;:-)\n\n- Preston\n\nOn 8/26/11, adamsafran &lt;adamsafran@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Re: Time Line!\n&gt;\n&gt; AWESOME!\n&gt;\n&gt; Also what you have along is the Predacons are a repressed class and second\n&gt; clas citizerns on their own planet.  The Maximal High Council is internally\n&gt; repressive and paranoid of another war, and experiments on their own\n&gt; citizens and law enforcement.\n&gt;\n&gt; What you can say is it&#39;s the intiial stages of the loop we see in many\n&gt; Transofrmers media where the Autobot repression gives rise to the corruption\n&gt; that the Decepticons use as an impetus to rise ot power.  Whether the castes\n&gt; of Transformers: Prime and the Exodus novel, or the Marvel US nad UK comics,\n&gt; or referenced in the Allspark ALmanac.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, things are very grey and grey.  The Predacons have many justified\n&gt; grievances, and the Maximals are engaged in a degree of corruption adn\n&gt; repression of thier own people, and are far from perfect.  So you can say\n&gt; it&#39;s the drive of the TRANSFORMERS all over again.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have written Airly about this but I am going to bring it out in the\n&gt;&gt; open as well. I am trying to create a cohesive history of things and I\n&gt;&gt; am creating what Cybertron is now and this is will require a soft\n&gt;&gt; reboot of Cybertron. I am basing it in part on our sister RPG site:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://wikihost.org/wikis/nbwrpg_wiki/wiki/start\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As well as using Transformers Animated for the general FEEL and\n&gt;&gt; ATMOSPHERE of Cybertron today. My history for Beast Wars basically\n&gt;&gt; uses G1/G2 cartoon from the 80&#39;s with elements from the comics and\n&gt;&gt; perhaps some of the other toons for spice. I am ignoring Beast\n&gt;&gt; Machines, although if someone wants or needs elements from it it can\n&gt;&gt; be incorporated into what we have. For me Cybertron is still metal and\n&gt;&gt; the Maximal council rules, and there is a cold war of sorts going on\n&gt;&gt; on Cybertron between the Maximals and the Predacons. Decepticons and\n&gt;&gt; Autobots exist but are consider rare and odd, Decepticons are to be\n&gt;&gt; hunted down and Autobots are considerfed relics of times past.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; None of this should affect what has already happened here on old\n&gt;&gt; Earth, but if anyone has any questions or comments, please feel free\n&gt;&gt; to let me know. I have a time line in the works to help put things\n&gt;&gt; into perspective.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
