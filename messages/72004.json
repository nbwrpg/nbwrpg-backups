And\n&gt; then the electrical smell of something being shorted out, reaches his scent\n&gt; receptors and he&#39;s quick to follow the scent.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Whoever you are, stay put, I&#39;m conning to help you!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Tuscon bursts through the foliage and brush to &#39;rescue&#39; the\nvicitim, he can see the fallen form of something! As he approached he\ncould see that it was a sweep, the last bit of lubricant leaking from\na rather large gash in its chest plating. There does not seem to be\nany life left in the sweep. If it was what was making the noises from\nbefore it is no longer doing it now, there are no life signatures\ncomming from it.\n\nAll around TUSCON the sounds of the forest have gone silent.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
