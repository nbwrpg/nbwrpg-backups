He also\n&gt; wanted everyone to disregard the end of his last post, instead of going to\n&gt; beast mode, Dinobot is still in robot mode and just waiting. That&#39;s about\n&gt; it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, CODE, I did post damage for Tavatron, but I made it general and didn&#39;t\n&gt; list any names because I had missed an entire day of posting and thus most\n&gt; of the battle. I didn&#39;t want to confuse anyone, that&#39;s all. Sorry for any\n&gt; inconvience^_^)*\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron stared past Dinobot as the newly formed battlefield. In some odd\n&gt; way she felt rather at home here, though it no longer held the quiet\nbeauty\n&gt; it once did. She was used to battle and it&#39;s casulties, whether they be\n&#39;bot\n&gt; or peaceful land. This was part of who she was, a warrior. However, that\n&gt; didn&#39;t mean she had to like it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron turned back to face Dinobot, not knowing that she was on his\nblind\n&gt; side. Her own eyesight was still blurry, but nothing she couldn&#39;t handle.\n&gt; Her shoulder was the main problem. If she couldn&#39;t rotate it without\ncausing\n&gt; further damage then she was at a loss. The throbbing had already begun to\n&gt; subside, only to be replaced with an occasional spark when she tried to\nmove\n&gt; it. The sound of Dinobot&#39;s voice caused her to snap her wandering optics\nin\n&gt; his direction:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I apologize. I hadn&#39;t realized you had a blind side.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron&#39;s voice was cool and confident, there was nothing else she could\n&gt; think of to say at the moment. All she wanted to do was get back to base\nand\n&gt; spend a couple of cycles in an &#39;R chamber. Then her ears perked at what\n&gt; Dinobot said next, how all that was left was her concern. Was she THAT\n&gt; transparent? She had always had a degree of control over her emotions, why\n&gt; now did she find it so difficult to keep them in check?\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron looked to the side and pulled her ears back in slight distress.\nShe\n&gt; didn&#39;t like this, she didn&#39;t like feeling as if she had no control over\n&gt; herself, over her actions. Slag it! She was a warrior, not a den mother!\nHer\n&gt; beast mode&#39;s instincts must be screwing with her programing again. Wolves\n&gt; were always worried about their packmates.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, deep down, Tavatron knew this wasn&#39;t true, she just didn&#39;t want\nto\n&gt; have to deal with it right now. She wrote it off as faulty programming and\n&gt; quickly righted her ears and turned to face Dinobot. All trace of emotion\n&gt; was wiped from her face. She was beginning to retreat behind barriers she\n&gt; thought no longer existed. Perhaps in war there really was no room for\n&gt; foolish emotions:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Whenever you&#39;re ready we can leave. I&#39;m sure Prowl and the others will\nwant\n&gt; to depart as well. Obliteracon doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s about to be beaten\n&gt; anytime soon.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The giant Gestalt barely even looked fazed as Prowl and a few other &#39;bots\n&gt; tried their best to fight him off. She would have gladly joined the\nbattle,\n&gt; but found herself reluctant to leave Dinobot alone. Why, she didn&#39;t have a\n&gt; clue, but somehow she knew it was more than faulty programming, she just\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to admit it to herself... yet.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
