Believe it or not I&#39;ve often\ndefended such losing causes as evolution in the name\nof partial creationism (it means God worked THROUGH\nevolution and the seven days were symbolic)....o.k.\nyou can flame me about that to, but like it or not\nevolution currently IS a losing cause, why, because\nthere are NO holes in creationism, it&#39;s to simple to\nfind holes in, just God made everything in a few days\nand everything looked old even then, so while\nevolution in my opinion is just as legitimate,\nwhenever a tiny hole appears the pure creationists can\nbeat both pure evolutionists and us partial\ncreationists over the head with it for two or three\ndecades until ninty percent of the world is on there\nside.\n  My defense of partial creationism against pure\nevolutionism is simple though.  Before the Big Bang,\nhow did the so-called &quot;primortial atom&quot; get there.  I\nmean infinately dense particals billions of times\nsmaller than normal atoms don&#39;t usually just pop out\nof nowhere do they.  The only person I&#39;ve ever heard\nanswer that was some nutcase astronomer who said\naliens from another dimension wanted to do a science\nproject and overloaded a black hole to start the big\nbang, but then you can simply ask how did THEIR\nprimortial atom get there, and yes I do believe the\nstories about alien abductions, but not that one.\n\n--- &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt;&quot;\n&lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Merry Christmas everybody and may your wishes come\n&gt; true!
