He walked to the \nconfinement chamber, where he found Rattrap trying to throw the last \nof his loose objects at the control panel. They both froze and locked \noptics. Quickstrike glowered.\n\n&quot;All right, rat. Yer comin&#39; wit&#39; us.&quot;\n\nThe stepped to the control panel, and with one long digit, he turned \noff the bars. Rattrap stood. He went to bolt, but Quickstrike lunged \nat him, grabbing his shoulder. He squeezed it.\n\n&quot;Ya listen t&#39; me, rat.&quot; Quickstrike grumbled. &quot;Yer gonna listen t&#39; \nwhat ah say an&#39; do it, ya hear? Otherwise ah&#39;m gonna slag ya.&quot;\n\n&quot;I like ta see ya try, two-head.&quot; Rattrap snapped back.\n\nQuickstrike was close to punching him. &quot;Ah got yer weapons tin-horn. \nYa want &#39;em back? Ah&#39;ll give &#39;em back t&#39; ya if ya listen t&#39; me.  An&#39; \nthen maybe ah&#39;ll see what sugar-bot wants t&#39; do wit&#39; ya.&quot;\n\nRattrap narrowed his optics at him. &quot;Whaddya want?&quot;\n\n\n\nQuickstrike held Rattrap by the shoulder, leading him down the \ncorridor. He called to his comm-link to Paralysis: &quot;Hey, we&#39;re \nheadin&#39; out t&#39; meet up wit&#39; th&#39; others. Come get this rat.&quot;\n\nHe was ready to leave and ready the ship for arming it.\n\n\n"}}
