It exploded just as she \njumped to get out of it&#39;s way.  Shrapnel hit her in several places.  The \nblast tossed her about 20 feet.  She landed on her side.  She got up slowly \nand looked around.  Then the hale of bullets came down from the sky.\n\n\n----------Original Message--------\n&gt;From: Yanshosh@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n&gt;::Shredder::\n&gt;\n&gt;Flying over Quickstrike and his group, Shredder looks around, trying to \n&gt;spot\n&gt;Bobertron. He shruggs. The bot must have left. Shredder turns around to\n&gt;leave, but stops as an idea occurrs to him. This was his chance to get back\n&gt;at Quickstrike...\n&gt;\n&gt;He grins evilly, turning back around and looking down at Quickstrike.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Say goodbye, fuzor,&quot; he says quietly, taking out a grenade and throwing it\n&gt;down in front of Quickstrike.\n&gt;\n&gt;Hearing the sound of the explosion, Shredder pulls out his guns, firing \n&gt;down\n&gt;at where he threw the grenade.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
