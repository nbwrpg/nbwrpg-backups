The bull \ntransformed back\n&gt; to bot and took an immediate stance of respect for the other \nbot. &quot;What\n&gt; about my orders to protect Chameleon?&quot; he asked, torn between the \norders\n&gt; he&#39;d recieved. On one hand he would follow orders to protect the \nsmaller bot\n&gt; and put the whole base at risk, or on the other hand he follows the \norders\n&gt; to stop and admits failure.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;airly2000@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 14, 2001 8:49 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: The world hasn&#39;t crumbled yet?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmare::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmare opened her comm link in Bullet&#39;s Frecuency, when \nshe\n&gt; &gt; saw Bullet ran where Chameleon was &quot;Bullet, stop!!! the place is\n&gt; &gt; blocked if you open it...
