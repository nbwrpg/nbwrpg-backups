If I missed something then someone give me a dingle, please.)\n\n\n* Iron Raptor growled at Plintissa&#39;s answer, she was surrendering to the Preds?! She couldn&#39;t believe her hearing mechanisms, why in on earth would a Maximal want to do that?\nShe growled as she looked over at Prowl, this was turning out to be a pretty sour day!\nIron Raptor opened her com-link to Plintissa again.*\n\n&quot; You can&#39;t be serious! Come back to base and we can talk about this, there&#39;s no reason that you should be turning yourself in to the Preds...is there?&quot;\n\n* She growled as she left her intercom open for Plintissa to answer, oh please don&#39;t let her say that she had betrayed them or worse!\nIron Raptor sighed with concern, she hadn&#39;t known Plintissa for long but she knew enough to hope that she hadn&#39;t betrayed them. Or so she wished to think.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
