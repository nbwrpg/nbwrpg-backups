They gave me quarters and permission to stay until I have \nfulfilled my duties.  I am here to offically extend invitatoin to the \nmaximal leader to our embacy for peace talks with the other leaders \nof other groups.  Weare trying to put an end to the war.  Not start \none.  I am here on peaceful terms and shall remain so no matter what \nhappens.  Wheather I am here with you or in the brig, I shall \ncomplete my mission and ask for peace.&quot;  She looked at him for a \nmoment.  Now she felt a little worried,&quot;You aren&#39;t going to put me in \nthe brig are you? I have done nothing wrong.&quot; she looked at him with \na little nervousness showing in her face.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster listens to Battera, his eyes narrowing at the \nword &#39;Predacon&#39;.
