The Concil of Elders would &quot;arrange&quot; for Sunhawk \nto escape so he&#39;d go right after the Pred&#39;s who stole the files to \nclear his name.  He&#39;d then be ready to give his life (I mean more so \nthen usual) because he had nothing to loose.  This would make him the \nmost dangerous agent the Council has.\n\nJust wanted you to know what you thought, although I was going to \nsomehow &quot;arrange&quot; for Snoowl to come to Earth I guess that story is \nnull and void.\n\n\n"}}
