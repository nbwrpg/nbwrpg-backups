But to ask him to tear\nhis spark into pieces just to make a choice was more torture than her\nspark could bare.

She felt her face plates flush a bit as a soft\nmoan escaped from her.  She couldn&#39;t help it. She loved him and wanted\nhim so much. So badly she needed him. A war had started in her, not a\nwar for life or territory, not for factions or bases. But the hardest\nwar of all, to make a choise for love.
