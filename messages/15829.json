One of his shoulder blasters swirls around, getting a lock \non the chip. All it would take is one shot... On low power, it could \nmelt the chip without damaging Spears too much.\n\nOn the other hand, there could be a fool-proof program, that could \ndeactivate the bot if the chip was destroyed. Striker sighs. One\nthing \nwas for sure, he was not going to kill Spears.\n\n&quot;Report away,&quot; he says under his breath, trying to convince himself \nthat it was the chip talking, not Spears. He looks through the hole\nin \nthe door. There was no choice but to knock out Spears, not if the\nchip \nwould make her run and tell Prebon everything that was happening.\n\nHis shoulder blasters charge up again, but Striker stops himself from \nfiring. He couldn&#39;t do it, he couldn&#39;t shoot Spears.\n\n&quot;Hey,&quot; he says, an idea occuring to him, &quot;Can you go fetch Prebon? I \nneed to speak to him.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Spears:;\n&gt; \n&gt; She took a few steps back from the door, just out of Striker&#39;s \nreach, \n&gt; and turned her head and neck arond so he could view the chip.
