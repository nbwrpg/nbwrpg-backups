She found an updraft and rested a second gliding \nslowly trying to conserve her energy.  She had little left after \nmanouvering throught the ice cannons.  She found a small tree growing \non a hillside through the ice.  She stopped and perched for a \nmoment.  She looked around for the Predacon, but didn&#39;t see it.  She \nhoped she had lost him.  The wind blew arond her.  She felt cold all \nof a sudden.  Not from the artict temperatures, but from inside.  She \npromised herself that if she made it through this, she would \nreprogramm herself into a better fighter.  She sighed and waited for \nher spark to calm down before flying off again. She kept looking for \nthat pred on the horizon, but didn&#39;t see him. \n\n-----Orignal Message----\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine picks up the message from Perndabot, he scans the area \nfor \n&gt; the coordinates and swiftly moves toward them. He didn&#39;t know if \nthe \n&gt; Maximal was Shadow Wing or not under the circumstanaes he assumed \nit \n&gt; was.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lunarpine to base, we have a Maximal in destress, I&#39;m sending the \n&gt; location now. Awaiting further orders.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; To the Pit with orders, he thought as he sprinted across the \n&gt; landscape in the direction of the Predicons message. A fellow \nMaximal \n&gt; was in trouble, and there&#39;d be Unicron to pay if it was harmed.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be out camping with family untill sunday, so I wouldn&#39;t be \n&gt; able to post.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Zardus/DevilDuer/Perndabot/Reptilica/Bloodystrike::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zardus flies through the forest, looking around. He frowns. \n&gt; Something was \n&gt; &gt; wrong, he could feel it. He looks down at his hand, seeing that \nit \n&gt; was half \n&gt; &gt; transparent. No! It was happening again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ll be gone for a few days,&quot; he says over his comm-link to the \n&gt; Alliance, \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nemesis is in charge untill I get back.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turns to Nemesis. &quot;Finish the meeting with Panzertron. Try to \n&gt; recruit him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With that, Zardus phases out, ready to phase back in in several \n&gt; days.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; In his quarters, DevilDuer turns around in his chair. He was not \n&gt; feeling \n&gt; &gt; well. Stumbling across the room, he falls on his bed. With a \nflash, \n&gt; DevilDuer \n&gt; &gt; is gone (for a few days).\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Perndabot spins around, looking at the sky. He could swear \n&gt; something had just \n&gt; &gt; flown over him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Night vision,&quot; he tells his internal computer, his optics \nchanging \n&gt; color. He \n&gt; &gt; looks around, seeing a bird. That was it. Perndabot lifts his \ngun, \n&gt; his optics \n&gt; &gt; widening when he looks at his arm, seeing through it. He growls. \n&gt; Not again!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;There is a Maximal at my coordinates,&quot; he says over his comm-\nlink, \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; device accidently transmitting that message over all frequences, \n&gt; then sending \n&gt; &gt; the coordinates.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Reptilica and Bloodystrike drop off the energon they had mined in \n&gt; the cargo \n&gt; &gt; hold. Reptilica smiles. &quot;That&#39;s 200k of energon.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bloodystrike growls. &quot;I hate mining.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With a flash, the two dissapear.\n\n\n"}}
