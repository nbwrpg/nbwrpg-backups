His words rang true to her.  She had lost a \ncomrad for the predacon cause.  His death meant that his pain was \nover.  But that she had to deal with those living.  She wiped her \nface dry and tried to smile. &quot;Your right of course.  I should focus \non those who are live and not dead. The dead are beyond help.  BUt I \nneed  to work on those who are still here and able to fight in order \nto lead them to glory for the Predacons.&quot;\nShe turned and looked at he chamber with the dead bot in it.  &quot;Please \nPhobia, Please give him a warrior&#39;s burial.
