Nemesis screams, the scream \nonly audible in the ears of Prowl and Dinobot as the silencer absorbs the \nsound.\n\nProwl lowers Nemesis carefully to the floor, hoping that Dinobot will do his \njob well. He walks over to the wall by Iron Raptor, pulling on a switch, the \nenergon bonds that held Iron Raptor in place deactivating.\n\n"}}
