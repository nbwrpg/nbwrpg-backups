Her jaws snapping shut inches away from the bots\nface,\n&gt; then yanking her shoulder free of the wicked blade.\n&gt; The moved her body so that she could strike out again, bunching up her leg\n&gt; muscles but remaining in her spot.**\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Bots have to eat too!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ** she roared, but then cocked her head to the side and looked at the bot\n&gt; again, her shoulder burning.**\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Who are you? And what right do you have attacking me like that?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ** the pig at her feet twitched a bit, making sick liquid squeels.\n&gt; Carnage raised her hind leg and simply set it over the pigs throat,\nbringing\n&gt; her hind claw down quickly shutting it up.\n&gt; If this bot left her alone then she just might get to kill the thing and\nend\n&gt; it&#39;s misserly. It wasn&#39;t right to let it suffer.\n&gt; But...then Carnage remembered the boar by the tree that she still had to\n&gt; finish, as well as the little headless pig to pick up.\n&gt; She eyed the bot for a sec before before leaning down and collecting the\nsow\n&gt; in her mouth, the pig too big to simply pick up.\n&gt; Backing a step she growled towards the one who attacked her with the\nscyth,\n&gt; sinking her teeth into the sow a bit more.\n&gt; Continuing to move back towards the direction where the boar still lat\n&gt; squeeling.**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
