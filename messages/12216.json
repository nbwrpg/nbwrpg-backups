Fruit bats \ndon&#39;t use ecolocation to find fruit. It&#39;s kind pointless to try and \nuse movement to find something that doesn&#39;t move. So they see better \nthen humans. Sorry to seem like I&#39;m yelling, but I hate when people \ninsult bats, sharks, and other creatures like that.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Magmatron::\n&gt; \n&gt;     He was watching on his video screens as Bobertron and Pantron \nleft the base to attack the Pred base. \n&gt;     &quot;Magmatron, Transform,&quot; He said. He then folded his wings over \nhis body like a cloak. (Like BM Megatron, but without the helmet and \nextra arms. Also Magmatron&#39;s wings are solid, not torn strips like \nMegs) He walked around the room trying to decide what to do. Then he \ngot a paing of pain. His enternal systems knew what it was and told \nhim instantly.\n&gt;     &quot;Magmatron, Beast Mode,&quot; He transformed and took off towards \nthe ocean. Upon reaching the waters he took a dive. The salt water \nrepelinished his systems. He went into Robot mode and walked out of \nthe water.\n&gt;     &quot;Hmm...it seems I don&#39;t run on energon anymore,&quot; He said to \nhimself. &quot;Well, I will need to be near an ocean if I am to stay \nonline. But the base isn&#39;t near one. It will have to move.&quot;\n&gt; (It doesn&#39;t have thrusters, and is still somewhat stuck in the \nrock. He&#39;s going to create a landslide to move it.)\n\n\n"}}
