But...if they were in an allience...::::\n\n::: Hell Beast on a comm unit to Zardus ::: Commander Zardus, this is \nPredacon Commander Hell Beast and I am asking for you assistance in the \neradication of the Newcomers!\n\n:::  Marine lead the Pred parade out of the ship. Gremlin, Jackle, Pheniox, \nBlack Aracnia, Rampage, Transanulas,  Scourge, Vuloris and his team :::\n\n::: Hell Beast looks to Cyber Claw ::: Who are you? and what do you want? \nDouble Puch, have your team ready to fight soon! And I want Bright Blade and \nGangon, and Bumblebee here as well!\n\n::: With the TM3 driver in his posession, Hell Beast smiles. They wouldnt be \nable to get it now, not ever. He placed it in a locked, voice activated vault \ndeep within the ship, beyond the point where any intruder could reach it \nwithout being shot by the internal defences. Only his signiture could open \nit, otherwise three rows of internal auto-guns wouldd rop and reduce the \nfraud to slag. It was a bit much, but Hell Beast invested alot in his well \nbeing, and no one was getting this device.  ::::\n\n::: Inferno stood guard at the entrance to the vault, the insane ant, along \nwith Hell Beast would guard it to the death. And the ant would surely take \nsomeone with him before he was killed. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~`\n\n:::  Pheniox, and Scourge took to the sky, while the other stormed out under \nthe cover of the auto-guns and shields. :::\n\n\n"}}
