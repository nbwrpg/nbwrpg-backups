She flew up into the rafters of \nthe lab and crawled into an air vent.  She hoped no one saw her.  She \ncrawled until she reached an outside grid.  All she had to do was get past \nthe grid.  The grid was electified and could shock a bot to death.  But she \ndidn&#39;t care, if she went back, she would be killed.  Her choices were slim. \nBut she had to try.  Shebraced herself and rammed it as hard as she could.\n\n\n--------Original Message-----------\n&gt;From: JP3884@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: The Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt;::: Hell Beast growled ::: Transanulas, Gremlin, Jackle, Black Aracnia, and\n&gt;Transanulas, return to the ship with me.
