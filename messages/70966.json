But he knew if he did that now, \nit would blow Windlord and his own cover.  He did not want to risk it.  But \nhe could see several tiny wires, and quietly nibbles on them to see what \nlittle good that could do.\n\nOut on the battle field, Tucson concentrates, knowing what kind of attack \nwas enveloping his comrades and himself.  He had once learned from his \nsensai, how to clear his mind, and focus on the task at hand.  Clearing his \ndirectory... Was that the way to lift the fog that Phobia had beset upon \nthem?  Night Shift was the only one who could read his thoughts, due to the \nfact that he too, had the same sensai as Tucson.  He catches on quickly, and \ntakes a deep breath, clearing his mind of everything.\n\nAs Tucson clears his mind, he could feel the breath of those many heads \nhitting his body from all angles.  Based on this information, he attempts to \nbackfist one of the heads he feels behind him.  And in pure ninja fashion, \nhe keeps quiet.\n\nNight Shift now focuses on his job at hand, and draws a ninjitsu blade from \nthe back of his left shoulder.\n\nTucson then looks to everyone.  He sends a silent com to Kup and everyone \nelse.\n\n&quot;Comrades, this is an attack of the mind.  Mind over matter.  If you clear \nyour minds you may find it easier to overcome the attack beset by Phobia. \nJust a little something Night Shift and I learned from our Sensai, Master \nYokitron, vorns ago.&quot;\n\nNow completely focused, Night Shift nodds, and his expression changes to \nDetermination rather than fear.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s do this.  Kup, Talon, we swing this, if Tucson says we can then we \ncan!  We&#39;re Autobots, not cowards!  We gotta remember Who we are and what we \nstand for!&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord/Kup/Talon:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord Keep quiet hoping that they soon be able to make their move.\n&gt;\n&gt; *******************\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon looked infront of her her greatest fear: Tucson and all her friends\n&gt; murdered by Unicron.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;NO!!!!

Someone&#39;s opening the door.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; For now before doing anything, he&#39;d have to wait until someone closed the\n&gt; door before he could make his move.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the battle scene, Tucson focuses on what he has to do, but then, a \n&gt; flash\n&gt; back is quick to flood his circuitry.  It was the day he feared that he \n&gt; had\n&gt; het his Autobot comrades down, by being taken off line suddenly during a\n&gt; horrific battle against the Decepticons.  It was this fear of failure that\n&gt; he would stick to his guns, literally and be sure that his comrades would\n&gt; NOT be failed once again!\n&gt;\n&gt; He sticks close to Talon, and the others, trying his hardest to shield \n&gt; them\n&gt; from harm.  It was something he thought he had failed to do so vorns ago.\n&gt; His fear of losing the ones he cares about, now floods him.  Failure would\n&gt; not be an option for him, as he very much fears it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No Hydras, I will not fall to you now or ever again.  Failure to me is \n&gt; NOT\n&gt; an option!  I will NOT fail my faction or the Maximals! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He draws his sword, like a Knight facing a fierce dragon.  He circles\n&gt; Hydras, and then listens carefully to his foot steps while wileding his\n&gt; blade masterfully.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Night Shift&#39;s fear was simple, he had always had an aversion to\n&gt; oversized arachnids.  Now, he sees a large spider&#39;s web from the corner of\n&gt; his eyes, and is quick to jump back away from it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;WOAH SCRAP!  WHAT THE PIT?!  I AIN&#39;T STEPPN&#39; ANOTHER STEP FURTHER!\n&gt; WHATEVER MADE THAT WEB&#39;S GOTTA BE BIG, UGLY AND BAD NEWS!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson listens.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Night Shift, keep it together! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift transforms and tries to back up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Uhh uhh, when it comes ta oversized spiders, I ain&#39;t gonna have anythn&#39; \n&gt; ta\n&gt; do with it!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson narrows his optics.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oh no, Phobia... Night Shift, listen to me!  Everyone, listen to me!\n&gt; Phobia has deployed a fear tactic!  You have to try your best to resist \n&gt; it!\n&gt; It&#39;s the only way to shake it off!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then turns back to Hydras, and remembers that if he did attack the\n&gt; predacon leader with a blade, and if he had managed to slice off a head, \n&gt; two\n&gt; more would grow back and what would be the sense of doing that?\n&gt;\n&gt; His fear of failure was still real, but his knowledge of old legends was\n&gt; still fresh in his directory.  The only way to stop a Hydra, was to cast a\n&gt; flame upon it&#39;s body that was not its own.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson accesses his smaller blast cannons, and sets fire to a piece of\n&gt; fallen debris and takes it up into his hand like a torch.  It was a\n&gt; primative method of combat, but if legend still held true, it would ward\n&gt; Hydras off.  Hopefully.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Slice one head off a hydra, and two grow back.  But cast a fire upon it\n&gt; that is not its own, will indefinitely see to its demise...  Phobia may \n&gt; have\n&gt; caused fear, but she had no idea that her effect on me, would actually\n&gt; inhibit me to resort to resourceful thinking rather than running away.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He now stands solid with the large torch in hand, waiting to see what \n&gt; Hydras\n&gt; would do next.  This was it, a page right out of mythology.  The legend of\n&gt; Hercules stuck solidly in his directory.  Having read something about it, \n&gt; in\n&gt; his spare time as a regular Autobot, vorns ago, the story stuck well in \n&gt; his\n&gt; mind, and now was coming in handy.  The legend itself depicted Hercules\n&gt; facing the Hydra and finding that cutting off its head was not the way to\n&gt; kill the beast.  But taking a torch to it would mean certain death for the\n&gt; creature.  And he did just that, in the legend.  But Tucson&#39;s fear did\n&gt; spread beyond failure.  His fear of dishonoring his Autobot and Maximal\n&gt; comrades was now apparent.  He was a Prime after all, and the Autobot way,\n&gt; was not to take a life needlessly.  So, he remains perfectly still, torch \n&gt; in\n&gt; hand, facing Hydras with a brave face, but yet, afraid to do the final \n&gt; deed,\n&gt; in fear of dishonoring his bretheren.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Night Shift gets back into robot mode, and notices a lot of\n&gt; spider web material around him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Great, more webs, more spiders...  I hate spiders.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Back at the Ark, Quickstride suddenly realizes that his stinky surprise \n&gt; goes\n&gt; terribly wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ooooops.... I sooo didn&#39;t mean to do that....  Awww geeze, I meant ta hit\n&gt; whoever it is that&#39;s spyn&#39; on us, not you guys...  It&#39;s a good thing I \n&gt; carry\n&gt; an oxygen reversal to my noxious attacks. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; From his mouth, he blows fresh oxygen into the air, where he had let loose\n&gt; his cloud of gas, hoping that it would help rather than harm the creatures\n&gt; around him.  All the while, still keeping an ear out for danger.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Talon/kup/Windlord/Hydras\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Windlord frowned and sais &quot;Ratrap, this wont be so easy as we tought&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ************************************\n&gt; &gt; Talon }\n&gt; &gt; Talon moved  a way trying to cover more land and at the same time trying\n&gt; &gt; to stay close to  Tucson she opened fire against Deepstryke and Phobia.\n&gt; &gt; Kup did the same against The sweeps and  Phobia\n&gt; &gt; Hydras Hissed while he atttaked at Tucson in beas form and said  while\n&gt; &gt; with his multiple heads he attemped to destroy Tucson&quot;I&#39;ll rip yu appart\n&gt; &gt; this time Prime...

It is small, but large enough that he could crawl\n&gt; &gt; inside of it while still in rat mode to check it out. Inside the wall is\n&gt; &gt; dark, and many different types of cables run along it of all different\n&gt; &gt; colors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (OOC: I was not sure if you were going inside yet?)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One of the doors at the end of the hall beeped, someone was preparing to\n&gt; &gt; open the door from the other side!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Meanwhile outside the Fortress&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The fire fight between the Maximals and the Predacons intensifies as all\n&gt; &gt; of the combatants come together in earnest! The sweeps come in laying \n&gt; &gt; down\n&gt; &gt; cover fire, strafing back and forth along the Maximal&#39;s lines, using \n&gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; superior maneuverability and speed to cover as many of them as possible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Deepstryke maintains his distance, using his long ranged targeting \n&gt; &gt; ability\n&gt; &gt; to strike at the Maximals as he can.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Straight shot goes offline and Tuscon began to look around and \n&gt; &gt; discuss\n&gt; &gt; tactics, Tuscon is wounded, the attack catching him in the shoulder. A\n&gt; &gt; brief look around shows that it was not one of the sweeps that had \n&gt; &gt; damaged\n&gt; &gt; him, or even Deepstryke, but none other than Hydras himself!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (OOC: Since Hydras had said he attacked and Tuscon said he was wounded \n&gt; &gt; â€&quot; I\n&gt; &gt; just stitched that together)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Talon and Kup continue to fire against Predacons hoping to break the Box\n&gt; &gt; maneuver, but so far they are heavily out numbered by the attacking\n&gt; &gt; forces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then a high pitched sound could be heard as something rocked through the\n&gt; &gt; air . . .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;THOOOM!!!&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;               . . . A rocket shell hit the ground!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However instead of exploding to send destructive forces in its wake, it\n&gt; &gt; began to emit a high pitched wine and the Maximals and Autobots began to\n&gt; &gt; feel FEAR!!!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (OOC: Yup, Phobia&#39;s ability is like her name. Like rumble can create\n&gt; &gt; Earthquakes, she can create Fear in her opponents.  Basically it brings\n&gt; &gt; out the worst fears in her enemies and attacks them with it.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;At The Ark&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The noxious cloud of green gas hisses out, hot, steamy, and extremely\n&gt; &gt; FOUL! Even as it rose into the air enveloping a few trees as it began to\n&gt; &gt; expand to envelop more and more of the area in which it floated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Soon several birds fall from their perch, hitting the ground with a \n&gt; &gt; thud!\n&gt; &gt; A squirrel quickly followed. However there was no sign of anyone else \n&gt; &gt; out\n&gt; &gt; there with Quickstride, he was apparently alone.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps, who ever the attacker had been, had used the moment that \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus\n&gt; &gt; had stepped out of the shield to see about Quickstride, to step in it\n&gt; &gt; himself. What ever the case, there was no response from the ninja, if he\n&gt; &gt; was even still out there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
