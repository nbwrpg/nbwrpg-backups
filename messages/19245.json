She \nsighed and looked down.  She knew that once she got in the open with \nMegatron, she would be done for. She also had her pack to think of.  \nShe knew that if she surrendered to Megatron, she only meet her death \nand then nothing would stop him from taking over her group or worse, \nkilling them all just to spite her. She felt her spark sink.  She was \nrunning out of options.\n\nShe opened her link to Aracnia. &quot;Look I may need your help yet. I am \ngoing to ask that you and your groups come here and stay with us. We \nare going to have to work together to stay alive on this one.&quot;  SHe \nisghed and hoped that she was doing the right thing.  She turned and \nwalked down the hall.  She made it to the lab where she saw her clone \nwas about 35% complete.  She sat down in a chair next to the control \nconsole and sighed. &quot;well, my honor at stake, my group at stake,&quot;  \nshe looked at the floor, worried for her group. She really didn&#39;t \ncare if Megatron killed her or not, but she had to make sure her pack \nwas safe.\n\n\n"}}
