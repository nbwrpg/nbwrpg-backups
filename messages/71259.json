He had often thought of what it =\r\nwould be like to pad around on four feet rather than roll on four wheels. \n=\r\n\n&quot;Funny you should mention that Ramulus, I kinda wondered what my life woul=\r\nd be like if I did trade in the vehicle alt form for a beast form..  If I c=\r\nould, it would probably be some sorta feline, same color, ellusive, quiet o=\r\nn the paws...  Oh yeah, that would be my choice if it was available.  But a=\r\nctually I kinda like what I got now.  Sure, it&#39;s a pain in the tail pipe wh=\r\nen I break down but, it does get me around from point A ta point B in a goo=\r\nd amount of time.  And rolln&#39; on wheels is alot easier than walkn&#39;, that&#39;s =\r\nfor sure.&quot;\n\nHe looks outside the cave.\n\n&quot; That&#39;s when I can walk.  I&#39;m real=\r\nly gonna slow ya down Ramulus.  I hate don&#39; that ta ya.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yah=\r\noogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n The dino who gave Ramulus the ride, nodds, and then shows him a cave while=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; looking to it casually then back to him.  Night Shift smiles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;Ohh yeah, that cave, it&#39;s big enough for all of us, just help me get in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; there and we can wait out the storm for a while. As far as I know my\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nheadlights still work, so I can give ya the light ya need ta work in.  And\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; we don&#39;t have ta worry about hauln&#39; aft anywhere, we&#39;ll be dry in there=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Great idea.  Next time, try not ta play=\r\n speedster okay? That&#39;s his problem,\n&gt; &gt; Ramulus, he thinks just because he=\r\n&#39;s got the wheels, he can play hot rod\n&gt; &gt; with the rest of &#39;em.  Now look =\r\nwhere it got &#39;em.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift Sighs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, I know, I know=\r\n. I&#39;m a workn&#39; vehicle, not a race car. Next time, I&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; definitely resp=\r\nect my specs.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Maybe you can think of getting a beast mode=\r\n like ours Night Shift.&quot;\n&gt; RAMULUS joked as he helped NIGHT SHIFT as well. =\r\n&quot;We can get over this\n&gt; rough terrain better than any four wheeled vehicle.=\r\n&quot; With his larger\n&gt; frame and powerful build able to take the Autobot&#39;s wei=\r\nght rather\n&gt; easily.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The rain must be fall out from the Volcano that =\r\nerupted from Hydras&#39;s\n&gt; old base.&quot; RAMULUS said as he got NIGHT SHIFT into =\r\nthe cave. He\n&gt; reached into his pack, pulled out a field scanner and ran it=\r\n over\n&gt; NIGHT SHIFT&#39;s wound. &quot;We might get it to heal a little on its own\n&gt;=\r\n before we start heading back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
