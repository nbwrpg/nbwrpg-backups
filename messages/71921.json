No. No one points fing=\r\ners at anyone.  This is NOT what\n&gt; &gt; this meeting is about.  I see I have m=\r\ny work cut out for me..  And under no\n&gt; &gt; uncertain circumbstances are any =\r\nof you allowed to fight against each other.\n&gt; &gt;  If I hear anything about a=\r\nny fighting among the three of you, there will be\n&gt; &gt; greater consequences =\r\nto follow.  Now, as of today, you are a team, and you\n&gt; &gt; will work as a te=\r\nam.  Am I understood?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rattrap and Straight Shot slouch in their ch=\r\nairs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes Sir.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Good.  Wheelie, you=\r\n understand what I&#39;m telling everyone right?  I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; singling anyone o=\r\nut, I&#39;m treating you all as equals.  I know you can all get\n&gt; &gt; past this, =\r\nit will take time but you can do it.  Now, Leo Prime, perhaps you\n&gt; &gt; have =\r\nan area you wish to assign them to?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot and Rattrap look=\r\n at each other.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Trapped like rats.  Go figure?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight S=\r\nhot Shrugs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well, we had it comming Rattrap, we had it comming.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME had been watching TUSCON at first, examining his s=\r\ntyle of\n&gt; command and the way he was able to motivate his troops.\n&gt; \n&gt; When=\r\n TUSCON called for him to speak LEO took a moment to look at the\n&gt; three Ma=\r\nximals as if weighing each one in some internal balance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally he sp=\r\noke. &quot;At the moment the most important mission is\n&gt; locating Rodimus and th=\r\ne other missing Maximals.&quot; LEO PRIME&#39;s voice is\n&gt; low and authoritative. &quot;A=\r\nll of our information is pointing to a large\n&gt; forested area located at coo=\r\nrdinates alpha 2279.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO glanced back at TUSCON and then at the three=\r\n before him. &quot;Scout\n&gt; the area and report back what you find.&quot; He looked at=\r\n each of them\n&gt; individually as if trying to implore them to work together,=\r\n silently\n&gt; asking them to disregard their differences for the betterment\n&gt;=\r\n of the team. This thought was manifested in his next words, &quot;All of you ha=\r\nve skills that lend themselves to a small scouting party, but you would nee=\r\nd to depend on each other to accomplish it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO leaned in towards the=\r\nm, &quot;Can you do it?&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nOOC - Given I posted twice, assumi=\r\nng that &#39;this&#39; response over in character comes after my previous one, so t=\r\nhe previous one is Wheelie&#39;s attempting to avoid contact with Rattrap and S=\r\ntraight Shot, and now over his questions ar eanswered as Leo Prime come sin=\r\n and gives the actual assignment.\n\n&lt;IN CHARACTER&gt;\n\nAt this point, WHEELIE&#39;s=\r\n agitation rose interanlly, but he stayed immediately quiet.  At this point=\r\n, seeing LEO PRIME come in and give the assignment to them, he knew there w=\r\nould be no getting out of it and no disagreeing over upon it.\n\nAt thi spoin=\r\nt, resting his hands over down on his lap he merely nodded and looked up at=\r\n LEO PRIME, then shifted his blue optics over to TUSCON a sthe mission orde=\r\nrs were given.  Merely sighing, &quot;So, what else do we know?  And what can we=\r\n expect when there we go?  If this is over ea patrol, we may end up giong d=\r\nown the hole.  Some backup would be nice, in case we encounter something gu=\r\nnniing for us turbo-mice.  What are we to do, when we encounter something u=\r\nnfriendly unlike you?&quot;\n\nIf this was a sweeping patrol in attempt to locate =\r\nthe missing RODIMUS, the trio of them would not exactly be in much of a pos=\r\nition over to do anything if they found him, given something which could da=\r\nmage or corrupt RODIMUS would be way outside of thier combat abilities, eve=\r\nn wtih the new upgrades of STRAIGHT SHOT&#39;s quill darts.\n\nSo, LEO PRIME and =\r\nTUSCON not being the sort to send out a suicide mission, WHEELIE&#39;s processo=\r\nr gave him two possibilities that iether this was going to be a simulated m=\r\nission and out in teh field there would be other MAXIMALS or traps setup ah=\r\nead to make the trio of them cooperate to have to bypass them.  Either that=\r\n or if this was a true patrol, then they would expected to immediatley resp=\r\nond back if they encountered anything and to not engage in the slightest bi=\r\nt of combat.\n\n\n"}}
