Thus he was spared the pain of the sub zero tempatures \nof space.  The minions returned to Unicron, and after closing the \nairlock, Splattercannon transformed, dumping Malice on the ground.  \nHellplague and Splattercannon drag his battered body to a room, \nsomeone&#39;s quarters, and dumped him on a bed.  His left shoulder was \nnearly severed, and his joints, where a signifigant amount of semi \norganic flesh was, were worn and thinned.  Hellplague look \ndisapprovingly at the sight and then turned to Splattercannon.\n&gt; &quot;I want you and Necross to re- energize him, and see if you can \nrepair him.  I must go and tend to the Sweeps.&quot;\n&gt; Splattercannon nodded and beckoned Necross to enter.  For a moment \nthey both looked down at the battered and bound hunter before them.\n&gt; &quot;Just get a pile of energon cubes and dump them here,&quot; Necross \nsaid before turning to leave.\n&gt; Splattercannon grabbed the Minion by the shoulder before \naddressing him.\n&gt; &quot;But Hellplague told us to repair him.  For whatever purpose, she \nwants him alive.&quot;\n&gt; Necross scofted before shaking his shoulder free from his \ncompanion&#39;s grip.\n&gt; &quot;Not my problem.&quot;\n&gt; Splattercannon fumed a moment as Necross set off for parts of \nUnicron unknown, then proceeded to the nearest enegon storage.  He \ngathered an armfull of cubes and brought them back to Malice&#39;s new \nresidence.  He dumped them all around the hunter and went to the \nRepair bay to nurse his own injuries.\n&gt; Malice finally came back online.  His vision was blurred somewhat, \nbut the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more alert.  He \ntied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he settled \nfor wiggling over to the closest cube.  He touched his foot to it, \nand began absorbing the energy from it.  His shoulder immediatly \nbegan to heal itself.  He set up and tried to break his bonds, but \nthey were nearly unbreakable.  He scooted forward and touched \nseveral cubes.  He quickly healed the rest of his body and scooted \nto the edge of the bed. He was about to try and stand up when \nHellplague pranced in.  She walked over and pushed him back onto the \nbed.  She put what looked like gravitity weights on his ankles and \nthen unbound his feet.  She repeated the same proceedure on his \nwrists.  She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link and \nMalice was pinned to the bed.  He tried to get up, but his arms and \nlegs were not going anywhere.  Hellplague smiled and straddled the\n&gt;  hunter&#39;s mid section, leaning forward and supporting herself with \nher arms resting on his chest.  \n&gt; &quot;Now, I think you had better just be an obediant little lizard and \nstay here where I can watch you.&quot;\n&gt; She leaned down until her face was inches from his.\n&gt; &quot;Or else I may have to &#39;disipline&#39; you.&quot;she added with a devious \nsmirk.\n&gt; &lt;Tag minions&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;             \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; SBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\n\n\nYahoo!
