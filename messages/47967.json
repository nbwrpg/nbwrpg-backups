However, on that particular \nnight, one of the meteors seemed to collide with another and change \nis direction slightly.\n\nWhether the ambiguity was dismissed by any who witnessed it, or \nwhether it wasn&#39;t spotted at all is not known. Regardless, the \nresult was a damaged pod that had the unfortunate chance to enter \nthe atmosphere at the same time as the Earth&#39;s planetary path passed \nby the edge of the Lyanids asteroid field.\n\nThe pod screamed downward, it&#39;s entry velocity only aided by the \natmospheric collision. Fortunatly for the bot inside, the pod mostly \nsurvived the crash. Sever damages were suffered to it&#39;s outer \narmour, but it managed to make it through. The lack of internal \ndamage was likely accounted for by the fact that the meteor \npartially broke off and stuck to the pod.\n\nThe silences of the mountains was shattered as the pod smashed into \nside of a low mountain, partially digging itself under some \nsedimentary soil. The scanner popped out on impact, and scanned a \nmedium sized Black Bear, but the pod itself was too damaged to do \nanything but sit and wait for repairs.\n\nAnd so, the pod remained stuck and time passed causing terrain \nchanges. Erosion and weathering caused sediment to layer itself on \nthe pod, and soon it was relatively buried. As more time passed, the \nsmall mountains pushed their way up several inches eacher year, and \na few more layers blanketed the location of the pod. The pod \nappeared to be lost-- but, the pod was equiped with a minor internal \nrepair system which activated itself not long after the pod imbedded \nitself into the mountain side. Damaged by both crashes, but still \nthere, the repair systems began their work, slowly but steadily.\n\nA time would come when the pod would reawaken.\n\n[--------------------------------------]\nDate: Current day. \nLocation: Several hundered kilometres\nnorth-north-west of the Maximal base.\n{--------------------------------------}\n\nThe pod&#39;s beacon systems awaken, and a Maximal frequency signal is \nreleased. The signal was weak but was undoubtably a Maximal signal. \nThe pod itself, hidden under many layers of sediment and rocky \ndebri, remains there repaired and ready to be released.\n\n\n"}}
