Her\nvenon is much like the real a real recluse spider, it desolves and\ncorrodes. Only when mixed with her own web can it be an expolive, but\nIt won&#39;t get used much. She thinks it&#39;s cheating to do that too often.)\n\nIn the depths of the long forgotten caves, in the dank and dark of the\nearth, a vibration is felt. \nA long, brown, spindly leg emerges from a coccoon.  Then another, and\nanother, and another, until all eight are freed from thier bonds.  \nThe large golden optics emit a soft glow as they look about the tomb\nthey were imprisoned in.  \n&quot;Ah, at last, free. I am free. Free to feed. Free to get vengence on\nthose who left me here to die. Now, as my spark pulses, I shall have\nmy REVENGE! HA HA HA HA HA HA!&quot;\nThe femme bot transforms into bot mode.  The noticable violin shape\nstill on her back.  Her legs folded up to give her a fan tail look. \nHer glossy chocolate brown and tan colors melt into the blackness of\nher cave.  She walked about, looking for the way out. But the entrance\nhad caved in so long ago. She let her hand glide over a boulder and\nshe sighed. &quot;Hmm, well, it will take more than this to stop me.&quot;  She\nflicked her wrist and shot a small web at the boulder.  With an evil\ngrin, she spat some of her corrosive venom onto the web and took a few\nsteps back.  The venom started to disolve the web. The web flashed\nred, then with a medium sized explosion, the rocks soon tumbled out of\nthe way.  Reclusa walked out of the cave in bot mode.  Using her comm\nbeacon, she turned it on. She would need other bots in order to exact\nher revenge on the Maximals who killed her ancestor Arachnia.  \n&quot;Now come to me, said the spider to the fly.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
