Raising his rifle, \nhe fired three laser shots off at Shadow Wing.  &lt;All forces, FULL RETREAT!  \nDieties, provide cover fire!  Mercenaries, cover fire!  MOVE!&gt;\n\n---\n\nSerpentor raised his launcher, firing a blast off at the Ark, beginning to \nfall back slightly.\n\n---\n\nHades stumbled back from shots, watching Anubis backflip, a few shots digging \ninto his heavily armored chest.  Both raising their weapons, Hades fired four \nlaser blasts from his rifle, Anubis firing three plasma blasts and two optic \nblasts, all shots heading for Sniper.\n\n---\n\nPyro reached his brothers, as did Scavenger, despite shots being fired on \nthem.  Dark One sidestepped, as did Hiss, avoiding shots.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s it!  These Maximal dogs will tremble now!  Form Oblitertron!&quot; Dark \nOne yelled, leaping into the air, taking the shape of a pelvis, torso, and \nhead.  Breakdown leapt into the air, taking form of a left arm and attaching \nto Dark One.  Pyro, despite his wounds, went into the air, forming into a \nright arm and attaching to Dark One.  Hiss transformed into a left leg, \nattaching ot Dark One.  Scavenger became a right leg after leaping into the \nair, attaching to Dark One.  Smashing into the ground was a 50 ft high \nbehemoth.  &quot;WE LIVE FOR OBLITERATION.&quot; the large robot bellowed, Dark One in \ncontrol and remembering who had attacked them, despite the pathetic treaty.  \nReaching into subspace, the large robot pulled out its relatively large laser \npistol (relative to the size of a regular Maximal or Predacon&#39;s laser pistol, \nsince it&#39;s a laser pistol for a 50 ft high robot).  Raising the pistol, with \na quick aim, Oblitertron pulled the trigger, launching a powerful and \nrelatively large laser bolt out at Tavatron.  Firing an optic blast off at \nShadow Cat, preparing to engage further.\n\n---\n\nKoga Shuko looked to Oblitertron, squeezing his hand into a fist.  &quot;That&#39;s my \ntechnology!  Serpentor, take that GESTALT DOWN NOW!&quot; Koga Shuko yelled, \nknowing only fresh troops could stop him, not his mangled warriors.  The \nDieties had been beaten.  He sighed.  &lt;RETREAT!  RETREAT!  GET TO THE SHIP!  \nDIETIES AND MERCS, COVER FIRE!  RETREAT!!!&gt; he screamed madly, running, \nSerpentor firing off a plasma blast from his launcher at Oblitertron&#39;s chest \nbefore running after Shuko.\n\n---\n\nBeachcomber and Smokescreen came out of the Ark, seeing the large gestalt \nfiring on Maximals.  &quot;Slag...&quot;\n\nSmokescreen saw BH and Blastrage&#39;s skimmer opening fire with its 10X grenade \nlauncher.  &quot;We better take that out before it damages the Ark, that large \nrobot won&#39;t be here for a few cycles, that thin will!&quot; Smokescreen said, \nraising his electro-distruptor rifle, firing five bolts off at the Skimmer&#39;s \nengines.  \n\nBeachcomber took out his missile launcher, firing off the one and only rocket \nin it off at the skimmer.        \n\n---\n\nUnitron stopped, seeing Beachcomber and Smokescreen firing on the mercenaries \nMaster Shuko had hired.  Raising his rifles, he fired four bolts each, \nrunning past the Maximals as they dropped to the ground.  Unitron heard the \ncall for retreat, and headed after Shuko.\n\n"}}
