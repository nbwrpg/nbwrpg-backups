If she wanted to become\n&gt; &gt; agressive, she would gladly make her submit. But not for now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dreadplague: Many reasons. First, they fight against each other, so\n&gt; &gt; why not let them tear themselves apart? Second, I have heard that \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Cosmic Rust is around. It&#39;s no good conquering if you die from it, \n&gt; no?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;My point is specialization!&quot; Synergy jabs Dreaplague hard in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chest with her cannon arm to emphasize herself.  And a particle \n&gt; beam \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cannon pointed at your vital regions is a lot of \n&gt; emphasis.  &quot;There&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a difference between breaking up barfights and fighting a war.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, if they&#39;re really that weak, why haven&#39;t you wiped them \n&gt; out \n&gt; &gt; &gt; already, hmmm?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dreadplague frowns at her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dreadplague: Your point being?
