However, it was tolerable and soon he simply disregarded it, \nbecoming nothing more then a shadow thought in the back of his mind as he \nstood there and waited.\n\nHe watched her as she stood there and took in the night sounds and smells, \nthe pain in his chest continuing to spark up�however, becoming more \ndifficult to ignore. He failed to see the expressions of the fembots face as \nhe thought of just how it was important it was to get back to base, his mind \ndwelling on that factor so much that he didn�t even noticing when she turned \nher head towards him.\nDinobot�s optics fell upon the stream as he waited silently for Tavatron, \noccupying his time with past thoughts and the importance to leave.\n\nHis tail twitched thoughtfully behind him, the past pain of his chest \nforgotten as he continued to relay the route in which they both were \nrequired to take in order to get back to the CF. It would be difficult and \nit would take time, plenty enough time to be attacked if the enemy decided \nto do so.\n\nThat factor made the reptilian warrior growl deeply within his throat, not \nreally wanting to consider the conciquesces of being caught as injured as he \nwas. The more mech-fluid he lost the less fight time he would have, the \ncloser stasis lock drew near.\n\nDinobot�s optics stayed on the cool reflective surface of the small brook as \nTavatron�s voice suddenly protruded into his thoughts, her question simple \nbut with meaning and concern behind it. *\n\n� I�m fine.�\n\n* His answer was just as cool and collected as the stream his optics gazed \nupon blindly, yet he knew that he shouldn�t lie as he had just done now. But \nthere was no need to involve Tavatron in his matters when she didn�t need to \nbe, said his thoughts, anyway.\n\nBut, just as he finished his short sentence he turned his optics towards \nTavatron, just wondering if she was ready to go yet�suddenly finding her \nRIGHT in front of him!\n\nHis optics refocused quickly, yet too slow to see just what Tavatron had \njust done. Due to his damage, by the time he focused upon her she had \nalready brushed her fingers against his chest-plate, hie own optics then \nlooking at the mech-fluid dripping from her fingers just as hers did.\n\nIn a sense he felt annoyed that she would touch him without his knowing, but \nalso he felt that he shouldn�t have lied to her in the first place�and \nindeed brought this contact upon himself.\nDinobot snarled as he then took his eyes from the fembots fluid soaked \nfinger tips, turning them towards her face�yet to be forced to refocus hie \noptics�again!\n\nThe two bots were face to face now, so close that he could literally feel \nher body heat against his wounded and mech-fluid soaked chest-plate.\nTavatron had never been this close to him before, giving him ample \nopportunity to now see just what secrets her features now held.\nFrom his point of view, she looked slightly detached, and even a bit \nstressed by his opinion. But by escaping from the situation she had been in, \nhe couldn�t hold something like that against her.\nHowever, as he simply stood there, to stressed by her closeness and \nhalf-intrigued, he began to see this fem for what she truly was� a \nsure-footed, confident and actually attractive woman.\n\nAnd it was that, the level of self-confidence he had never seen before, and \nher beauty that held him in his place while his systems screamed that she \nwas far too close and should move away�yet, he did not. The past thoughts of \ntheir long journey completely forgotten, no blank and with no other thoughts \nother then of how close Tavatron was.\n\nAnd again, without his knowing�his body had reflexed. Without even knowing \nwhat he had done, he had reached out and now held her again. His clawed \nhands firmly clamped on either side of her waist, his optics remaining \nfocused upon her own.\n\nHowever, this time he did not catch himself, for, his mind was actually now \nfocused on her and was not thinking of such a thing that this would have \nseemed against his nature�and how such closeness usually made him \nuncomfortable.\n\nDinobot watched Tavatrons lips turn in a smile, and realizing that the smile \nwas directed towards him. However, as he glanced deeper into her expression, \nhe also saw concern�and that was when his mind finally clicked in. And it \nwas also then that he realized what he was doing, which caused him to become \nuncomfortable and questionable.\nHe heard her speak and knew her words with a new sharpness, his own twice as \nblunt and meaningful.*\n\n� Yes. Agreed.�\n\n* He removed his hands from Tavatron�s waist with haste, silently cursing \nhimself for having his guard down.\nThis wasn�t like him, and it made him uncomfortable�and, thus, aggressive.\n\nHow could his mind had gone almost�numb like that, and just because Tavatron \nhad been near him?\nIt was too strange, and something that made him doubt his own self control.\n\nHowever, little did he know�but he didn�t have time to dwell on the faults \nof his control, not with a missile heading right for his back!\nDinobot stepped away from Tavatron with a meaningful growl, not wanting to \nbe near her any longer at the moment. But, he did manage to hear the distant \nsound of a single voice�and heard its words as well.\n\nHe snapped his head in the direction of the voice just in time to see Dark \nOne, the spineless little gnat he had slaged back at the Alliance.\nHe saw the laser shots heading right for them, his head then snapping \ntowards Tavatron.*\n\n� Quick! To the trees! We�re under attack!!�\n\n* Dinobot then ran a few steps towards the approaching Dark One, taking a \nlaser bolt in the arm as he came to a stop.*\n\n� Get to the cover of the trees, they shall have a harder time attacking you \nfrom there!�\n\n* He called this back over his shoulder towards Tavatron, knowing that the \ntrees would be the only form of protection now.\nDinobot then looked back towards the advancing enemy, his systems a bit \nfuzzy as they were but still able to function.\n\nWith a sneer he growled and aimed his optic laser towards the approaching \nAlliance bot, his scanners picking up the remainder of the Oblitercon crew \nas he fired towards Dark One�s middle.\n\nHe just KNEW that they should have moved out, but he guessed that it was far \nbetter to be attacked here and not when they would be crossing the swamp.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
