With megs out of the jamming zone he could not \nmake any scans into the jamming zone. The hologram set up to trick the \nalliance was still up and megs had never known of it. So when they entered \nthe jamming zone they would only pick up the hologram ship&#39;s signal. Leading \nthem to the fake ship. Giving the opportunity to jump them....... It was \nperfect. He sent a transmission forcefield around the ship. Unforunatly this \nmeant No trans good come in or out. To keep the ships signal off screen. So \nnow when Hell beast and megs enter they will be lead to a fake ship. Right \nbefore the shield went up he sent a comm to killfest explaing the plan and \nhow no more comms in or out could be sent. he advised a call to magma to aid \ntroops would be in good mind. And then there was complete radio silence.\n\n"}}
