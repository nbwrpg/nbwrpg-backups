I haven&#39;t joined either one yet.  \nI have been trying to find out which group may be more successful at \nwinning the war. Although I think I have figure it out.  I&#39;ll have to \nlet you decide on your own which one to join.  Myself, I will join \nthe Allience.&quot;  \n\nShe looked at him again and smiled.  He was quite handsome.
