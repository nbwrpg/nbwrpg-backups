The first ship, a mo=\r\ndified looking stasis pod lands first, followed by what appears to be a sma=\r\nll supply craft.  As the stasis pod hits the ground first it takes no time =\r\nat all for a DNA scanner to pop out & scan the area for lifeforms.  Minutes=\r\n later a black transmetal wolverine crawls out of the stasis pod and inspec=\r\nts the surrounding area to see where it has landed.  After a few moments th=\r\ne animal speaks, &quot;Fracturcon, Maximize!&quot;  The wolverine transforms into a r=\r\nobot and walks over to the second craft, whcih has settled right beside his=\r\n stasis pod.  &quot;Computer, scan planet for any lifeform readings.&quot;  As a smal=\r\nl camera looking device floats out of the small ship and quickly ascends in=\r\nto the sky, Fractucon gets an uneasy feeling that he has walked into a situ=\r\nation which has more then he is barganing for.  As he contemplates his new =\r\nsurroundings the small camera device returns to the ship, &quot;Computer has sca=\r\nnned multiple carbon based lifeforms inhabiting this planet.&quot;  Fracturcon&#39;s=\r\n grim mood becomes more uplifting, &quot;Yes....it looks as though there are ple=\r\nntly of different species here for me to study.  I guess this trip wasn&#39;t a=\r\n waste of time as I thought.  Optimus did say there are a variety of differ=\r\nent lifeforms to keep me occupied for a long time.&quot;  As Fracturcon is about=\r\n to scan the area for a suitable base camp the computer goes on to say, &quot;Co=\r\nmputer has also scanned multiple transformer sparks on the planet&#39;s surface=\r\n.&quot;  No sooner had the computer finished making that statement that Fracturc=\r\non&#39;s slight smile on his face turned into a very grim froun.  &quot;What!, how c=\r\nould there be any transformers left here on this planet?  I thought the Bea=\r\nst Wars were over, from what I was led to believe.  Computer begin individu=\r\nal scan of all transformer sparks on the planet & identify each one.  Estab=\r\nlish com link with my memory core & send all findings directly there.&quot;  As =\r\nthe computer begins work on it&#39;s latest task Fracturcon spots a cave near t=\r\nhe top of the mountain he is on.  After scanning the surrounding landscape =\r\nto insure it&#39;s defendability Fracturcon sends both his stasis pod & his sup=\r\nply ship into the cave to begin setting up his lab.  As Fracturcon begins s=\r\netting up his new &quot;home&quot; he mutters to himself, &quot;Those damn Maximal & Predi=\r\ncon warmongers better not bring their damn Beast War around here........cau=\r\nse if they do they&#39;ll be in for a big surprise when they see who their new =\r\nneighbor is.....computer begin setting up defense guns & shield.&quot;\n\n*****Int=\r\nernet E-Mail Confidentiality**********************************\nNotice:  Thi=\r\ns e-mail may contain information which is privileged and confidential.
