Raising \nboth pinchers, he fired off two energy-singature seeking missiles off, one at \nArchangel, one at Brooder.\n\n---\n\nPunch, on the ground, jumped up and ran, shots knocking him to the ground.\n\n---\n\nHiss sidestepped, a few shots piercing into his side, leaking mech-fluid.  \n\n---\n\nPyro smashed through the woods in his tank mode, the smell of fire on him.  \nStopping, he targeted with his large cannon, firing off three fireballs at \nSteel.\n\n---\n\nSoundwave headed for the woods, taking out a missile launcher from subspace.\n\n\n---\n\nScavenger crawled for the Alliance base, his foot still a little paralyzed.\n\n\n"}}
