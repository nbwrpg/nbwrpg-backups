Please, for your safety, do not try to cross the field\nprematurely. First we would like you, for our safety, to leave your weapons\non the outside surface of the defense field - they will remain suspended\nthere until you return. After you have done so, a five meter by five meter\nopening will appear. Please then proceed to the camp site on the northern\nmost point of the south island, we will do business there.&quot; End transmission\n\n\n"}}
