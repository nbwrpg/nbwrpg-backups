He climbed down from \nthe hammock, reached over, and opened the door.  He reached up and \ntook one end of the hammock off the wall and  let it fall to the \nfloor.  He stood his full height and stretched, his back occasionally \npopping.  He sat on the edge of the bed, reclined back a little, and \nlooked over the two on the bed.\n&gt; &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what to do about the kids.  One left on her \nown, and the other?&quot;\n&gt; He thought a moment before a grin spread across his face.\n&gt; &quot;I dunno, the two of you look cute.  Maybe you&#39;re wrong about kids!&quot;\n&gt; He lay flat on his back now, laughing his head off.\n&gt;  \n&gt; OOC- My, he teases Wolfblade alot.

But what are \nwe \n&gt; going to do with the kids?&quot;  She looked down at Elita and over to \nthe \n&gt; little kid laying on Malice.  She sighed and looked back up at the \n&gt; ceiling.\n&gt; \n&gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; She tossed and turned over. She jumped up and off the hammock. She \n&gt; landed on her feet, wide awake and looking around frantically. She \n&gt; ran to the door and pawed at it. &quot;Open, open, open.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Malice awakes and turns his head toward Wolfblade.

He heard a commotion near \nhis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; apartment he, Megatronics, and their adoptive sister, Organics \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shared.  Several bots were gathered around the door, watching \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megatronics stand over Organics.  Not menacing her, protecting \n&gt; &gt; her.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; His brother was struggling with an appearently drunk, \ntenticuled, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; robot of unknown origin.  Neutronics pushed the gatering at the \n&gt; &gt; door \n&gt; &gt; &gt; aside and rushed the attacker.  He was knocked to the ground, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; &gt; megatronics was able to knock the attacker away.  The mystery \nbot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; escaped through the window and into the night.  Megatronics \n&gt; helped \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his brother to his feet.  They pull Organics up and Neutronics \n&gt; shut \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the door and rushed to his sister&#39;s side.  As he held her hand \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reassure, his hand passed through her&#39;s, and the room grew \nblack, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Neutronics looked around, and instead of his protective older \n&gt; &gt; &gt; brother, the mighty Megatron stood rusting and laughing.  \n&gt; &gt; Neutronics \n&gt; &gt; &gt; covered his audio\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  recepters, until Megatron opened fire on them both.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice jolted awake, dropping the alarm clock in his hand.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instantly, a monofiliment wire shot from his wrist.  it bounced \n&gt; off \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his index finger, pierced the clock housing, bounced off the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; insides, and exited to stick in the wall.  The clock slide down \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wire, till it rested on the floor.  He retracted the wire and \n&gt; &gt; looked \n&gt; &gt; &gt; around.  He saw Wolfblade was awake.  He picked Camoflage up \n&gt; &gt; gently, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rested her in his lap, and swung his legs over the edge of the \n&gt; &gt; cargo \n&gt; &gt; &gt; net to face Wolfblade.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :Good afternoon, I think.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She purred slightly as Malice stroked her head and nuzzled \neven \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; closer to him.  Her mind was dreaming of past times. In her \n&gt; &gt; sleep, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she muttered, &quot; No, I don&#39;t want to go mommy. I can fight. I \n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get rust sickness. Honest, I can stay, please let me stay \n&gt; &gt; mommy.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She whimpered a bit and calmed down. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She moved and rolled onto her back to see what had scratched \n&gt; her. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was Elita. She gently put her arm around the little sleeping \n&gt; bot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sighed. SHe very gently stroked Elita&#39;s head and shoulders \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wondered how long the little bot had been there.  She thought \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; herself, Why do kids come around bots who have little to no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience with kids? I wonder if they do it on purpose just \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; raise \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a bot&#39;s oil pressure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She turned her head to see that Malice had a little one \n&gt; sleeping \n&gt; &gt; &gt; at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his side as well.  She wondered why the kids came to his room \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sleep. THen something else occured to her. If kids could \nsneek \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this place, how easy would it be for an enemiy to sneek in \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kill \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them. Especially when they were sleeping. This thought \n&gt; disturbed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough to not let her fall back to sleep. She would wait for \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kids \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to wake up, then address the matter with Malice. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;In the name of God, I banish these souls of the evil undead \n&gt; into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; damnation.
