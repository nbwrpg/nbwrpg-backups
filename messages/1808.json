Made for long distance journeys for a few \ndangerous criminals.  As far as I can tell, from the ship&#39;s damaged data \nlogs, somehow the three fugitives got out, and in a struggle, the ship \ncrashed here.  Hell Beast used it as a very temporary base with the struggle \nagainst Megatron.  I believe it can fly once more.  Though, it will take \nextreme amounts of work.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very well, Hiss.  You and Scavenger shall begin to work on it, I will take \nPyro and Ominous with me.(I don&#39;t know if he followed the Oblitercons still, \nso if he didn&#39;t, nevermind about this), we will get Pyro repaired, recieve \norders, and swing by here when we ware finished.&quot; Dark One said, motioning \nfor Ominous to follow, Dark One carrying Pyro, walking towards the Alliance \nbase.\n\n============\n\n::Injector approached the Predacon base, two autoguns popping up and firing \non him::\n&quot;Slag!&quot; the fuzor yelled, falling back, while he was using Double Punch and \nManterror as shields against the fire::  \n::he soon got behind a large boulder, setting down Double Punch and \nManterror, resting sa the autoguns broke small pieces off of the boulder::\n&quot;Slag, slag, slag, slag!&quot; ::he yelled, pulling out his stinger missile \nlauncher, leaping to the left, firing off two stinger missiles at one of the \nautoguns, landing behind another boulder::\n\n=============\n\n::Anubis leapt into the air, attempting to slam his entire body weight \nagainst Inferno::\n\n::Hades laughed, firing off three shots from his laser rifle at Rampage::\n\n"}}
