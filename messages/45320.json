The Tripredacus lady walks \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; the west side of the ship.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Melchana: The ship, Firedrill, is divided in three parts. The west \n&gt; &gt; side contains the cargo part, the right is where the renewal \n&gt; chamber \n&gt; &gt; is. The tower contains the Matrix Chamber and the command room. \n&gt; For \n&gt; &gt; now, we&#39;re going to the cargo bay where Belthassan is likely to \nbe.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She enters the bay. Tankor is there with Belthassan, inventoring \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; energon fruits. They were huge fruits holding a massive bright \n&gt; &gt; blue charge of energon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Belthassan: Ah! Sister! How good to see you! And you as well, \n&gt; &gt; Firedrill!\n\n\n"}}
