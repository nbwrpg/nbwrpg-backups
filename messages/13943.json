The bots on the planet would know who it was right away, and \nthat would mean Apollo could get answers quickly.\n    The form was placed in a small sphere, and shot out of the ship, targeted \nto land at the Bunker. Once there, the investigation would begin and if \nnessecery, the bots would all be destroyed.\n    The sphere plumeted downward until it hit a little friction entering the \natmosphere. After the shakey arrival, it landed with a hard crack on the soil \na few yards away from the opening to the Bunker.\n\n    Aracnia was the first one out of the Bunker. Scans had picked up the \nobject and she wanted to know what the hell was going on. Tarantulas followd \nher and saw that Aerostreak, Guantix, Grappler, and Paralysis were all \ngathered around the sphere with Aracnia.\n    &quot;Wheres Megatron? Get him! This is his doing!&quot; Aracnia roared, but sure \nenough the lizard was on his way out of the bunker, after passing Darkmouse \nwho was asking him if he was alright. He had enough of that little vermine....\n    &quot;Im right here! Now, what is that thing?&quot; Megatron said, approaching it. \nHis keen eyes looked over the flawless sphere.\n    Aracnia hissed back, &quot;You tell us, your the one who talked with the \nAliens.&quot;\n    Tarantulas suddenly squeeked because the sphere opened. The being inside \nsteped out. His body was a fimiliar red, purple, and black. But what sent \nshivers down there backs was his voice. It sounded just like him.....\n    &quot; Greetings and salutations Predacons. I trust you know Im here to \ninvestigate what has happened here at Bunker 3571?&quot;\n    Aracnia was in awe. Apollo chose a fimiliar form indeed. The being \nstanding before them was the replica of Hell Beast, sent to investigate and \nthen to destroy.\n\n"}}
