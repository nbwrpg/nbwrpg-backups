It was furnished with all the \nthings he needed, his weapons and some memories from Cybertron. He was making \nplans for the Maximals, maybe he could send CyberShark to infiltrate the \nbase. \n    Hmmmm...I think that might work, just gonna be kinda painful for \nCyberShark. Magmatron thought to himself. Yes, it will be a sorry day for the \nMaximals when CyberShark enters the base.\n\n"}}
