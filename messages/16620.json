She felt that someting \nwas very wrong.  But she wasn&#39;t sure what.  She usually listened to \nher feline insticts.  She decided to wait to see what would happen.  \nShe then had the thought of installing the chip in Cybershark, but he \nwould have to be unconsious for that to happen.  She got a smile on \nher face as she opened her arm panel and activated HotRod&#39;s chip.  \nShe smiled and waited for him to come out of the chamber.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;David Torrey&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (Well it looks as if CyberShark might have a new goal, he was \nstanding in the doorway to where Battera was.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ::CyberShark::\n&gt; \n&gt;     He saw that Battera hadn&#39;t even noticed him, and that she was \ngoing down the hall, he had enough power for a minimal cloak, he \ndecided on this (just so I don&#39;t mode) because she had never ignored \nhim before. He slipped into cloak mode and followed her down the hall.\n&gt;     As soon as she stopped he stopped, he listened in on the \nconversation and realized that something was terribly amiss here. \nBattera was under some sort of mind control, he needed to confront \nFeline, but his power wasn&#39;t up to par. Instead he walked a little \nbit away, decloaked and started to the CR Chambers. (They are in the \nsame general area right? Hot Rod was in one, and they couldn&#39;t have \nbeen opposite the ship, she needs to stay close, or slip back in)\n&gt;     He saw Feline after Battera had left.\n&gt;     &quot;I&#39;m here for a recharge,&quot; He said. &quot;Power levels kinda low, \nand I&#39;ve been banged up pretty bad.&quot;\n&gt;     He set one for minimal heal, so he would still be awake, and \nhopped in, shut his Optics and healed.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: logomorph@h... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@egroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, September 28, 2000 4:51 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Proposition\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   (OK this has to take place before HotRod gets out of the CR)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ::Feline::\n&gt;   She got out of the CR chamber and walked to her work bench.  She \n&gt;   opened her left forarm panel and installed the small control \nboard \n&gt;   for her chips.  She had one in HotRod, one in Battera.  She had \nonly \n&gt;   one chip left to install.  She picked up the chip and put in her \narm \n&gt;   with the panel.  She then closed her arm panel and smiled.  She \ncould \n&gt;   now control the other bots and not lose the controls.  She \nstarted \n&gt;   working on a plan to get HotRod and Battera over to Zardus.  She \nknew \n&gt;   she had to create a diversion to get them all out and with \nminimal \n&gt;   damage.  She didn&#39;t want to hand damaged goods over to Zardus.  \nShe \n&gt;   opened her link, &quot;Battera, could you come to the lab please?&quot;\n&gt;   She smiled.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Battera::\n&gt;   She walked down the hall and to the lab,&quot;Yes, you called for me?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   Feline:: She opened her arm panel and activated the ship inside \n&gt;   Battera.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Battera::\n&gt;   She felt a surge of information flood her mind. She fell to the \nround \n&gt;   shaking and then stood up as the chip took control of her.  She \n&gt;   looked at Feline. &quot;What is it that you want?&quot; she said in a \nrather \n&gt;   rough voice.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Feline::\n&gt;   She smiled and walked up close to Battera.  SHe whispered into \n&gt;   Battera&#39;s ear,&quot;I want you to go to the Allience base and tell \nZardus \n&gt;   that you now serve him and that I will be going back to the base \n&gt;   soon. You are to follow and obey Zardus now. Got it?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   Battera::\n&gt;   She smiled evilly and looked at Feline, &quot;Yes, right away.&quot;\n&gt;   She then walked out of the lab.  She headed to the entrance and \n&gt;   stepped outside of the base.  She transformed into her bat mode \nand \n&gt;   took off towards the sky.  She had the distict feeling like she \nwas \n&gt;   finally finding her place. \n&gt; \n&gt;   (The chip mostly changes the nature of the bot from maximal to \n&gt;   Predacon.  All personallity chances from good natured to evil.  \nAnd \n&gt;   makes the bot prone to obeying who ever installed the chip. But \nit \n&gt;   doesn&#39;t make them slaves completely)\n\n\n"}}
