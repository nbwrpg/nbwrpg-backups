I rarely challenge an ally unless they sully my \nhonor. \n&gt; &gt; From where I come, though, I am an elite warrior and this mech I \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; become is one of the fiercest ever built.

He glances at Ragnar.  &quot;She knows of what she speaks.  \n&gt; You \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wise to listen.&quot;  He stands up and walks out into the hall \n&gt; casting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a wary \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glance at Empath as he passes her.
