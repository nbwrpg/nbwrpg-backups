They were now en route to the Maximal \nbase. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast, within the shade of the mirky woods from a soft \nrainfall, ::: Jackle, scout ahead and send the transmission to the Maximals. \nIt will let them know were coming so they dont become alarmed.\n\n:: Jackle nodded and transformed into his beast mode. He ran onward, his nose \nsmelling the air and his ears alert. Within a few minutes he was out of sight \nand deep into the darkness of the forest. He went stright to the Maximals \nbase. It was a large clearing, and settled around the ship was the volcano \nand the Ark. :::\n\n::: He transformed and pulled out a transmitter. He punched in a few codes \nand sent the message. A large orb appeared and Hell Beast&#39;s head visualized:\n    &quot; Greetings Maximals, and who ever is in charge. I do belive it is Iron \nRaptor, but I could be mistaken. Liono, if he is even in the base, I want to \ntell you that Myself, Zardus, Megatron, and a few troops are on our way to \nyour fortress. \n    This is not a warning or a threat. We are here to discuss the Newcomers \nand the possibility of an allience. Please, dont greet us with pistols. This \nis a mission of peace.&quot;\n\n::: The message was sent. Now all he could do was wait. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Set and Ra glared at the snow capped cliffs that they were perched on. \nThey recevied a message from an informant who could give them stratigic \ninformation on the insides of both the Predacon and Allience bases. :::\n\n::: Ra, in between shivers, in his beast mode. ::: Master Set....I-I-I dont \nthink this informant is-is-is coming....\n\n::: Set, wrapped in a thermal blanket, ::: He will come, if he dosent then I \nwill level this artic desert.\n\n::: Then there was silence until the sound of thrusters broke it. From the \nwhite sky came the metallic body of Ominous Prime. He set down, energon \npistol in hand, and the tube of liquid energon in his chest cast a faint blue \nglow over the tundra :::\n\n::: Ominous ::: I see the cold dosent suit you two. \n\n::: Set ::: No, it dosent. I suppose you&#39;ll be taking me to your lair now? \nWell, not likely, we will stay here, where we have the advantage.\n\n::: Ominous, his cool red eyes locked on both figures who looked absolutely \npathetic in the freezing cold. :::\n\n::: Ominous ::: Fine stay. Ive adapted to the frost, and six months solid \ndarkness. It suits me just fine. \n\n::: Ra, in disgust of the cold, ignites his flame wrists to warm his body. \nOminous is spooked by this and fires of two blasts and sends the pheniox \nskidding across the snow, smoking. :::\n\n::: Set didnt even glace back ::: I see your an excellent shot. A good \nfighter too I persume?\n\n::: Ominous ::: Ask Hell Beast, he&#39;s the one who made me.\n\n::: Set ::: Well, I was wondering what you were. You didnt seem to be any \nkind of transformer Ive seen.\n\n::: THe conversation went on like this for near twenty minutes, and then they \ngot to business. :::\n\n::: Set ::: So, you can help my fraction?\n\n::: Ominous ::: Yes, in exchange to total use of your futuristic labratory&#39;s \nand esources.\n\n::: Set ::: Granted. Now, lets go to my base, we can talk more.\n\n::: They picked up Ra, and took off. :::\n\n"}}
