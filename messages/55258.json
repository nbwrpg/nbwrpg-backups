I posted for a little damage \nto Hydras, but nothing critical.\n&gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; Rodimus brought his arms down in a &quot;x&quot; formation, forcing the \nswords, and Hydras&#39; arms down. Rodimus then grabbed Hydras around the \nwrist with his left hand. He dug his saw which was in the place of \nhis right hand, down into Hydras&#39; arm. With his balance on his left \narm, Roddy flipped both legs up to double dropkick Hydras. After \nhitting this he back flips away and to his feet.\n&gt; Just then Perceptor is heard over the comm system.\n&gt; Rodimus stands motionless, and optics look empty, like all hope had \nbeen lost. But then...\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Enough of this! Maximals, kill these bastards in \ncold fluid!\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; face shows nothing but hate. He grits his teeth together, \nwhile letting out an yell that could destroy an audio receptor. He is \nalmost fomeing at the mouth, with the mixed mech fluids that leak \nfrom it. The anger causes his normally blue optic sensors to turn a \ncrimson red. His gaze locked on Hydras.\n&gt; Rodimus empties his mouth, spitting all the energon and other mech \nfluids from his mouth at Hydras.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: On this day, Galvatron, I&#39;ll finally KILL YOU!!!!!!!!\n&gt; Rodimus transformes to car mode and fires his propulsion rockets. \nFull power all at once, sending Rodimus Prime at Hydras&#39; gut at an \nairborn 300mph!\n&gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; At the Maximal base Kup was about to take Elita from Cam...\n&gt; Kup: Give her here...\n&gt; When Perceptos message came over the comm sytem as well as a \npicture on all of the monitors.\n&gt; Kup: By primus no... How could they?! She was a mother, a good bot, \nshe didn&#39;t deserve this. They targeted her just to get at Rodimus...\n&gt; Kup drops to the floor.\n&gt; Kup: Cam, you may have to help with that baby more if you can. Her \nfather is the commander, and she just lost her mother...\n&gt; Kup looks up at the picture of Perceptor on the monitor.\n&gt; Kup: Rodimus will lose all control now. I fear that are leader is \ngone, and a killing machine is in his place. I actually pitty those \nPredacons now, for what Rodimus will do to them. May primus have \npitty on their sparks...\n&gt; OOC: I hope I really showed the emotion I meant to in this post. \nThe hatred, the sarrow, all of it.\n&gt;  airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;To all maxiamls, and specially to you...
