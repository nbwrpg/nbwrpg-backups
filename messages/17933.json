Engage and kill all the invaders,&quot; he says to \nScattershot, Nemesis, Serpentor, and Unitron as he takes careful aim, \nfiring his plasma launcher at Shockaract.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike flies in behind Shockaract&#39;s group, recieving Zardus&#39; \norders. He takes out his rocket launcher, firing it at Airbomber.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer stops in his tracks, his face breaking into a smile as he \nrecieves Zardus&#39; transmission. Battle was good, better than chasing \nsome bot.\n\nHe nearly crashes into the pod before he sees it, stopping a few \ninches in front of it (Airshadow&#39;s new char). He smiles, looking at \nit and waiting for it to scan a beast mode.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc nods, checking his internal scanner as he looks at Chaos and \nMinion.\n\n&quot;Gunfire! There&#39;s a battle at the nearest base,&quot; he suddenly says, \nhis eyes lighting up at the thought of battle, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;\n\nHe transforms into his Ju 87 Stuka (German WW2 jet, the one with the \nsirens), flying off toward the Alliance base. Repressor, transforming \ninto an attack chopper, follows after him.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Burning Hammer ran outside and looked off and seen Shokaract&#39;s team.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Looks like they are just standing there, not doing anything, maybe \nthey are\n&gt; peaceful? I hope not.&quot; Burning Hammer says. Airbomber and Time Warp \nslowly\n&gt; walk up to the Alliance base, and come right up to Burning Hammer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I await orders good old fearless leader.&quot; Burning Hammer says \nthrough\n&gt; commlink to Zardus. Time Warp started to say something and then \nfired a bolt\n&gt; into Burning Hammer&#39;s head. Burning Hammer falls and lays there. \nTime Warp\n&gt; aims at the base, but is knocked over. Burning Hammer is up and \npunching\n&gt; away at him. Airbomber points his gun at the back of Burning \nHammer&#39;s head.\n&gt; Burning Hammer swings his hand and knocks it across the landscape. \nHefires a\n&gt; fireball into Airbomber and blasts him backwards. Burning hammer \nbeats on\n&gt; Time Warp until he&#39;s bloody, and then stands up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Still awaiting orders, what should I do with these here 2?&quot; \nBurning Hammer\n&gt; asks Zardus...\n\n\n"}}
