The Fuzor was still \ndull as a cyber-brick. He ducked his head and tried to quiet a chuckle.\n\nHe had to get just a little closer. This was funny. But how did he get back \non-line? And where did this other scorpion come from? Maybe she was the one \nthat brought him on-line, perhaps favoring him over the others peices of \nscrap metal. She must have done a good job of rebuilding him. He looked \nfairly clean. But he still stunk.\n\nA dead branch on the ground got in the way of his paw, he tried to move his \npaw a step forward, but it hit a twig that snapped.\n\n&quot;Oh slag.&quot; He knew they had heard it.\n\n\n\nQuickstrike turned his head. &quot;Ya hear that?&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
