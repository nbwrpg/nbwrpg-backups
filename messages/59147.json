Her power cells recharged as \nthey \n&gt; &gt; always did when she slept.  She awoke to the sound of the alarm \n&gt; going \n&gt; &gt; off from her trip lazars.  She jumped and looked around.  She saw \na \n&gt; &gt; large animal. It was about 6 and a half feet tall. Massive branch \n&gt; &gt; like things sticking out of it&#39;s large elongated head.  It&#39;s legs \n&gt; &gt; were very long and very thin. It had dark brown skin and fur.  \nWhat \n&gt; &gt; she saw was a moose, but since she had never seen one before, it \n&gt; &gt; looked like a monster. It was larger than her, but she knew she \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt; take on anything she had seen so far in the woods.  She reset her \n&gt; &gt; little alarm system and laid back down and went to sleep. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras picked up the signal of new comoer and he sent StarStorm \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; find out what&#39;s going\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
