I got the generator \nworking (to see a working version, go to http://nbwrpg.com/nbwrpg/cgi-\nbin/ad.cgi . This version just spits back a random banner, choosing \nbetween the one drawn by Megan (which is on the main site), and the \none drawn by Robo (which is on the eGroups page, \nhttp://egroups.com/group/nbwrpg). The ad system works just like this \ndoes, by spitting back an image, only it&#39;ll be working with linked \nads instead of banners.)\n\nThe only thing I have left is to figure out how to implement this \nthing into the actual web page. So far I can&#39;t get my server \nconfigured to do that, but I&#39;m trying!\n\nI will do some research tomorrow and will then post the specific \nguidelines for banners and faction descriptions, and as soon as I \nhave this whole flippin&#39; thing up, you guys can send everything in.\n\n\nAlso: Dachande, thanx for reminding me about Zergling (rather \ncreative reminder, may I add). I&#39;ll get him out as soon as Squizzy is \ndone with Vamprah&#39;s optics.\n\n\nOk, I&#39;ve babbled for long enough. I&#39;m off to bed. Goodnight everyone!\n\n\n(Faction commanders, start writing descriptions! My guidelines will \nmore likely make you write more instead of less, so it won&#39;t hurt to \nstart.)\n\n\n"}}
