Hellplague sighs and turns to face Malice, only \nto \n&gt; get punched in the face.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;My, we have a temper.  I will enjoy breaking that habit.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague launches herself on Malice, wrapping her arms around \n&gt; his waist, swinging her body behind him, and then picked him up.  \n&gt; She threw him to the ground, and sat on his chest.  He was \n&gt; temporarily stunned, so she took the stray chance to cup his face \n&gt; and kiss him again.  The bounty hunter roused around to find \nhimself \n&gt; being kissed a second time.  The minion breaks the kiss, a \nsatisfied \n&gt; look on her face.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Did you enjoy that?&quot; Malice said in a deep, unforgiving \n&gt; voice,&quot;cause that may be the last one you get.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The minion was genuinly suprised, even as Malice delivered a \n&gt; punishing blow to her exposed abdomine.  She stood, then doubled \n&gt; over, gasping for breath.  malice sood and stretched his back.  He \n&gt; had his sinister grin as he approached, and then charged.  Body \n&gt; checking Hellplague, Malice used the momentuum to punch, kick and \n&gt; slash, with his claws and limbs.  Hellplague came to rest near a \n&gt; ridge over looking an enormous energon deposit.  She looke over \nthe \n&gt; edge down into the glowing chasm, and as Malice charged again, got \n&gt; an idea.  Just before he got to her, Hellplague jumped up and over \n&gt; the hunter, and kicked hard, sending him to the chasm floor.  \nMalice \n&gt; fell, tumbled, and came o rest, impaled with giant shards of \nenergon \n&gt; piercing his body.  He rests motionless, before the rest of the \n&gt; fighters to see.  Hellplague staggers to her feet, and looks down \nto \n&gt; the bounty hunter.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Tsk, a shame.

He drew his sword and prepared to \nstrike \n&gt; &gt; the final blow to Blacknightmare.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Without warning, the sixth minion sprang into action.  She \ndived \n&gt; &gt; down on the bounty hunter and tackled him.  Both roll around on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; ground until they are a fair distance away from the rest of the \n&gt; &gt; fighting.  They rested, with the sixth minion sitting on top of \n&gt; &gt; Malice, and both trying to force the other away.  She leaned \ndown \n&gt; &gt; until their faces were only inches apart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;My, a powerful one.
