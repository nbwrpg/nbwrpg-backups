A\n&gt; slight energy signature told him the the Maximals were already in \n=\r\nroute\n&gt; as well. It would be a race to the finish.\n&gt; \n&gt; Reaching out a claw=\r\ned hand Vorpral opened a communication channel,\n&gt; &quot;Krytek, how are the expe=\r\nriments proceeding.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sir.&quot; came the swift reply. &quot;The experiment is a=\r\n 87% completion. \nAll\n&gt; results appear positive.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good. Keep me advis=\r\ned. Vorpal out.&quot; He chuckled again, perhaps that\n&gt; intruder would serve a u=\r\nseful pupose after all. Soon he would have \nhis\n&gt; own set of warriors stron=\r\nger and more resilient then sweeps - then\n&gt; perhaps Unicron would not need =\r\nCyclonus. Vorpral brooded darkly. But\n&gt; then again there are always good us=\r\nes to put wariors to. \n&gt; \n&gt; Vorpal finally turned to the image of Unicron t=\r\nhat had been standing\n&gt; inert in the center of his throne room. While Vorpa=\r\nl was ever loyal \nto\n&gt; the dark diety, having him sit there so close was al=\r\nways unerving. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lord Unicron.&quot; Vorpal spoke finally to the image of U=\r\nnicron, &quot;All \nis\n&gt; nearing readiness. The Maximals are without the Matrix a=\r\nnd the \nPedicons\n&gt; are about to be other wise engaged and the original hold=\r\ner of the\n&gt; Matrix will be destroyed.&quot; Vorpal chuckled, &quot;What is your desir=\r\ne \nlord?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ((OOC: Airly I sent you some Private Email))\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; =\r\n(Da&#39;minion)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n__________________________________________=\r\n____________________________\n______________\n&gt; You rock.
