Right now we got bigger problems\n&gt; ta solve.  And when I see that poor excuse for a Prime I&#39;m gonna let him\n&gt; have it!   And I don&#39;t care if it takes every quill on my body!  Rodimus\n&gt; dissed us one time too many and I&#39;m not about ta take his scrap any more!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You got that right, Prickles.  Same here, if I could take that miserable\n&gt; hot rod apart tire by tire I would!  Humph!  And don&#39;t expect me ta take any\n&gt; orders from him ever again!  &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride narrows his brow.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I hate ta admit this guys but they have a point.  After what Rodimus pulled\n&gt; I&#39;ll be surprised if the council allows him to keep the Matrix of\n&gt; leadership.  I seriously hope he&#39;s not allowed back as a Prime.  If\n&gt; anything, he better be stripped of that title until he really smartens up\n&gt; and does something about that dark side of his.  I know Leo Prime will do\n&gt; the right thing, and I definitely know Tucson Prime will not stand for Hot\n&gt; Rod&#39;s unacceptable conduct.  Ohh I hate ta see what would happen when those\n&gt; two meet face ta face again.  We&#39;ve seen Tucson when he&#39;s angry, he&#39;s like a\n&gt; tempest when he&#39;s in the worst of his moods.  And now, yikes, look out.\n&gt; Dragons are notorious for extremely dangerous tempers.  Well, that&#39;s if ya\n&gt; rub the scales the wrong way.  Other than that, we need his strength and\n&gt; he&#39;s got plenty of that.  Plus, he&#39;s been extremely generous, understanding,\n&gt; protective, and very sincere about our well being.  Look what he did for\n&gt; Silverbolt, he risked his life to save him and now hopefully he&#39;ll pull\n&gt; through.  I can see why Nightshift, Straight Shot, Talon and Rattrap have so\n&gt; much faith in him.  He will do anything for us and it&#39;s time we did\n&gt; something for him.  C&#39;mon!  Let&#39;s do this!  FOR TUCSON!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap and Straight Shot both raise their paws.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;. FOR TUCSON!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBANTOR, who has been serving under LEO PRIME for some time now nodded\nas they spoke, &quot;I do hope we can find Rodimus, if he can be subverted\nlike this, perhaps Tuscon could be too.&quot;\n\n&quot;Rodimus did serve in the great war.&quot; AIRHAMMER said, &quot;If a mech of\nhis experience could be taken, what does that mean for any of the\nyounger ones?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
