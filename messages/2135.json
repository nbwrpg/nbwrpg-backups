She wasn&#39;t sad because of something that Teltoli said or did, she wasn&#39;t really sad at all but really more deep in thoughts that she would rather forget. It just seemed to affect her physically as well as mentally.*\n\n&quot; No, just old wounds that haven&#39;t healed properly. Nothing to worry about.&quot;\n\n****************************************\n\n* Dinobot looked at the forest that Tavatron pointed towards with her paw, it seemed the perfect place to hunt for live prey and come out successful. He looked at the sort of trees and the shadows that they cast upon the ground, he then looked down at himself and growled. He would have to keep to the shadows as much as he could if he wanted to come out of this venture with a catch, otherwise would simply give away his position and erase any chance of success. The simple matter was that his armor was to shiny and reflective to do other wise then keep to the darkness beneath the trees, if the sun didn&#39;t reflect and draw attention then there was the possibility of a good hunt.\nDinobot then looked back up at the trees and began to walk towards them, when he entered the forest and looked at the height of the trees he spoke...*\n\n&quot; There is NO room for error, communication between we two from this point on it MUST be that of gestures. Understand?&quot;\n\n* He then lowered his head from looking at the trees and then turned it to look at Tavatron, he hoped that she knew the gestures that hunting required. If she didn&#39;t then there might be a slight risk that they would fail in their attempt to bring down suitable prey, even though they may try several times.\nDinobot was willing to accept failure for, perhaps, the first attempt to hunt but not from himself, he wasn&#39;t aware of Tavatron&#39;s hunting abilities and thus was in doubt. But he would put up with a failure or two from her if that was the case, but a third was not acceptable to him in the slightest. One may hunt once or twice and fail for circumstances of their own or other causes but three times was just plain bad hunting or they simply didn&#39;t know what they were doing. If it came down to that then he would hunt for them alone but he hoped that it never came down to that. Wolves were natural hunters and new the way of the woods, he was sure that she would be successful if not better then him.\nDinobot then looked back towards the woods and began to concentrate on the smells of the air, keeping his mind open enough to hear Tavatron&#39;s response to his question.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
