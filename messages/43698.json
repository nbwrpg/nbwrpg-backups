I have ALSO have come to understand that she doesn&#39;t want this story line to continue. \n\nYou say that it is too late to change everything just because she had a change of heart, but... that isn&#39;t what I was said. I suggested that you devise a new storyline to continue from where you are, so that Airly can control her character. I didn&#39;t say you had to just let BN go and then do something else, I wanted you to act and not react...\n\nLive with the consequences? Don&#39;t dwell on the past, work on the futur. Your ideas are good, but your method for implementation is wrong. \n\nIf you say that BN cannot do anything about her predicament, then Airly had an equal right to say that Orchestra removes the device and they are ok, or something along those lines.\n\nAlso, I suggest that you repost, possibly suggesting what stuff BN might be inclined to do. And one more thing, Orchestra has every right to remove BN&#39;s spark, and you can&#39;t just say that she&#39;s left just so that you retain control. Airly can determine whether BN fights back or not. I think that you would find the saying &quot;It&#39;s a dog eat dog world out there,&quot; quite accurate... others might not.\n\nFinding the the post where Airly agreed to your scheme means nothing, that was the past and this is now. Deal with now, since the past cannot be changed.\n\n\n"}}
