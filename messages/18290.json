She was having trouble walking on two \nlegs, so she transfomed into leopard mode and hobbled on four.  She \nwalked into the CR chamber room.  She saw Squizzy and Lady Hawk \nthere.  She growled softly. She was hurting and couldn&#39;t understand \nwhy she didn&#39;t see either of them at the battle.  All she knew is \nthat when her leader called, she went and obeyed. SO why didn&#39;t the \nrule apply to everyone.  She didn&#39;t know if Zardus had ordered them \nto stay here or not, so instead of open mouth and insert paw, she \nquietly walked into a CR chamber and started to heal.  The slice in \nher side would leave a nasty looking scar, but then, battle wounds \nwere proof that one was in battle.\n\n\n"}}
