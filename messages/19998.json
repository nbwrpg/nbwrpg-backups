Assembled before her stood Rampage, \nInferno, Tankkor, Tarantulas, Paralysis, and Aerostreak. Quickstikre was here \nalso. Rat Trap remained locked in the brig. Besides that, the ship was empty.\n    &quot;We are going to seige the Allience today. I want everyone packed, armed, \nand ready to move out in an hour. Now move.&quot; She commanded, and the crew \nscattered. She turned to Quickstrike.\n    &quot;Subcommander, I want you to rig this ship to self destruct on my \ncommand? Allience stratigy is usually to go after the ship of the oppent \nwhile in battle. If that happens, I want this ship to blow up and take any \nAllience attackers with it. Understand?&quot; She said, not giving him any slack. \n&quot;I want it to blow a crater that will cover upto a mile at least. Any bot who \ntries to take on this base, will die.&quot;\n    She turned once more, and looked around her old, battered ship with a bit \nof nostalgia.\n\n    Megatron, Hell Beast, Gremlin, Waspinator, Aquarious, Paddletail, and \nAdrax stood on the command floor of the cavern. Megatron told them of the \nplan, and they agreed.\n    &quot;And what is this I hear of a clone in Kitkats ship?&quot; Megatron demanded, \nlooking at Paddletail. He narrowd his eyes.\n    &quot;Well....um...sir....Nighteyes optic camera recoreded a clone of you in \nKitkats ship. That all I...um...know.&quot; The Maximal said.\n    Megatron frowned. &quot;Well, she will just have to explain herself to me, \nwont she? Everyone get packed. We depart in 20 minutes.&quot;\n    Hell Beast shook his head. He didnt like this fighting thing.... \ndiplomatics were so much more cleaner and less tiresome. &quot;I dont suppose that \nthe Allience is willing to surrender under certian terms?&quot;\n    Megatron barked, &quot;No, they are not! Everyone o nthe double!&quot;\n\n"}}
