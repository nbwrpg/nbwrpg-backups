She scowled and her arm began to hover in \nthe &#39;ready&#39; position until the confrontationalists left. As they \ndeparted she watched them go, wary and alert.\n\n    Blindchaos also stood ready. He and Domnijoe had worked as a team \nfor a long, long time and he wouldn&#39;t abandon her (or Firestrike!!). \nHe remained ready in his dinosaur pose, tail ready for action.\n*****************\n\nLong Haul watched the entire situation with a weary eye yet he was \neager for battle. He was weary of not being in combat. He was weary of \nalways repairing people. He grunted as he rushed to Hook&#39;s side to \nattend to his wound. He faithfully attended his brother until Havotron \nordered them back to the ship.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n*************************\n&gt; Blindfear::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;still we have to explain to Megatron this&quot; thought the male while \nhe \n&gt; transformed to his tank mode and followed Autofire.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Firestrike willfully gets set in Autofire.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Needlenose watches as they leave.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Havotron looked at the peculary.  &quot;We will let them go, but we \nwill \n&gt; &gt; be back when we have proper forces.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;D.E.D., return to the ship&quot;\n\n************\n\n\n"}}
