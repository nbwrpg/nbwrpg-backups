He was always =\r\nhappy to have a comrade along.\n\n&quot;Of course you can Depthcharge, I never kno=\r\nw when backup will be needed.  No matter how strong one thinks he is, it&#39;s =\r\nalways good to be ready for the unexpected.&quot;\n\nEven though he was now a Prim=\r\ne, and possibly had the power to overcome the most difficult of situations,=\r\n Tucson knew that it was also good to be conservative with what powers you =\r\nare given.  He then looks back to Talon with that curious smile, and then l=\r\nooks back to Depthcharge.  \n\n&quot;I - have to admit, talking to Nighstrike wasn=\r\n&#39;t the only thing on my mind. I may be good at quite a few things, but, the=\r\nre is something I&#39;m not too good at.  Or at least I haven&#39;t tried to do yet=\r\n...  Talon is beautiful, and I really would like to get to know her, but ho=\r\nw to approach her without offending her..  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s bots out there =\r\nthat wouldn&#39;t hesitate to make a pass at her, but I don&#39;t believe in that k=\r\nind of behavior..&quot;\n\nAfter assuring that the way was clear outside, Rat Trap=\r\n catches up to Tucson, and the others, as Quickstride remains outside happi=\r\nlly munching on plants out on the field. \n\n&quot; Not too much action out there,=\r\n thought I&#39;d come in &#39;n see what was gon&#39; on in here.  Wheels, you&#39;re kinda=\r\n turn&#39;n a little red around the faceplate..  You okay?&quot;\n\nTucson gives his l=\r\nittle friend a sheepish grin.\n\n&quot;Oh, I&#39;m fine, nothing to worry about Rat Tr=\r\nap...&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks at how Talon smiles at Tucson.  He wasn&#39;t stupid, he=\r\n knew.\n\n&quot;Oh, I get it.  Ya know, you&#39;re a really nice guy, and I bet she&#39;ll=\r\n really appreciate that.  You should just go&#39;n talk ta her, be yourself.&quot;\n\n=\r\nTucson hiccups for a moment.  Then he realizes Rat Trap had a valid point.\n=\r\n\n&quot;You&#39;re right.  Wish me luck guys.&quot;\n\nWhile heading to talk to Nightstrike,=\r\n Tucson hangs back and stands beside Talon.  Rat Trap stays with Depthcharg=\r\ne and the others.  He keeps his tiny fingers crossed, hoping that another r=\r\nelationship evolves.\n\n&quot; I think this was meant ta be guys.. I sure hope it =\r\nis, he&#39;s a really nice bot, not too many of &#39;em around anymore, except for =\r\nyou guys..&quot;\n\nTucson looks to Talon and gathers all his courage at this poin=\r\nt to finally speak up and start the conversation.\n\n&quot; When I couldn&#39;t see an=\r\nything, you a great help in that first battle we fought together..  I - don=\r\n&#39;t think anyone else would have risked their life like you had, for me.  A =\r\npiece of &quot; Old Junk&quot; as Nightstrike put it..  After that, you stuck by me w=\r\nhen you didn&#39;t have to.  That meant quite a bit to me Talon.  It still does=\r\n.  And now, in more ways than one..  I - meant what I said, you&#39;re more bea=\r\nutiful than I ever imagined before I could see what you looked like.  And n=\r\not only are you beautiful on the outside, you&#39;re also beautiful on the insi=\r\nde.&quot;\n\nHe gently takes her hand.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard this from a lot of=\r\n other bots but I mean every word honestly.  And I&#39;d be honored if you coul=\r\nd continue to be beside me not only in battle, but companionship.&quot; \n\nHe rem=\r\nembered an artifact, a tiny artifact that he had found on Atlantis.  A comp=\r\nass, which he was able to restore simply by feel alone.  The compass also h=\r\neld a tiny pearl inside, as part of its decoration.  He takes it out of his=\r\n subspaced gauntlet, and presents it to Talon.\n\n&quot; Now I know why I held ont=\r\no this for so long.  Before I left Atlantis, I was working on restoring thi=\r\ns artifact.  It&#39;s nothing large, but, I know it&#39;s valuable.  I&#39;d like you t=\r\no have this.&quot;\n\nThe pearl sparkles as lights touch it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That will be fine.

Sorry Lord Perseus, =\r\nit was Lord Elder. I&#39;m glad he\n&gt; contacted me because I didn&#39;t know that Ni=\r\nghtstrike wasn&#39;t one of Hydras&#39;\n&gt; men.  But, I still need to question him o=\r\nf course.  It&#39;s great to actually\n&gt; see you this time, sir.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He salute=\r\ns Lord Perseus, and then looks over to Talon who smiles back to\n&gt; him.  He =\r\nhad not forgotten her.

Anyway, I have to go.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He visibly turns a slight shade of red ar=\r\nound his optics.  He then gathers\n&gt; himself to prepare to question Nightstr=\r\nike as to Unicron&#39;s intentions.  He\n&gt; knew he had several things happening =\r\nat once, and to be a Prime to him,\n&gt; meant he had to be well rounded.  He a=\r\nlso felt that Unicron&#39;s objectives had\n&gt; something to do with the opression=\r\n that was hovering over the planet.  As\n&gt; always, he was curious as to why =\r\nthings were happening.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; If it&#39;s all right with both of you, I&#39;d like =\r\nto ask Nightstrike some\n&gt; questions.
