He had come a long way, and it wouldn&#39;t be=\r\n for nothing. He couldn&#39;t transform into robot mode, only to risk losing Ve=\r\nstige, who he knew was very important to this quest. He would have to charg=\r\ne in vehicle mode, hoping to Primus he could bust through with using simple=\r\n blast cannons on his cab.  He aims the cannons, as they begin to glow with=\r\n bright plasma energy, firing up within the chambers of the weapons.\n\n&quot; I s=\r\nwore by the name of Primus that I would succeed in my quest to rescue Rodim=\r\nus Prime and bring him to saftey.  Nothing, not even a self absorbed, greed=\r\n filled horde as yourselves can keep me separated from what is most valuabl=\r\ne to me!  No amount of power will ever overcome the one thing that Autobots=\r\n and Maximals possess.  You have no compassion for others, or faith in comr=\r\nadery.  Nor do you have genuine trust among your ranks.  To you power is th=\r\ne survival of the fittest, and that alone will not shield you from adversit=\r\ny.&quot;\n\nHe now delves deeper into his heart spark.  He senses Rodimus&#39;s encour=\r\naging words, and a feeling of warmpth builds gradually within him.  Now onl=\r\ny if he could get that to Rodimus Prime.  So he attempts to send a silent c=\r\nom to Rodimus, hoping that in this realm his voice could be heard.\n\n&quot; Rodim=\r\nus, if ever there were a time for courage and strength, it is now.  You hav=\r\ne within you the power to relight the flame, and all you need do, is look d=\r\neeper into your heart.  There you will find it, a power that is perpetual, =\r\na power that is unmatched by anything ever devised in the universe, and a o=\r\nne true power that as Autobots, we share among each other.  Be not afraid t=\r\no delve into this power, as I too am not afraid to do the same.  My heart i=\r\ns here for you, all you need to is reach for it.&quot; \n\nInside Tucson&#39;s cab, a =\r\nscreen shows the image of a beating heart. As it beats further, the inside =\r\nof the cab glows a brilliant silvery blue light. A light that eminates from=\r\n his heart, and a light that can not be doused by the forces of evil.\n\n--- =\r\nIn nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson Prime continues on his path, and keeps at a good but s=\r\nafe speed through the tunnel. He knew that going too fast could upset the s=\r\ntructure even weaken it to the point of breaking, which he did not want to =\r\ndo. He continues steadilly, sensing that Vestige was growing weak once more=\r\n. Gently, he begins to take control of his own wheel, and goes in the direc=\r\ntion of where he&#39;s being led.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s all right old friend, you have =\r\ngiven me the course, I can take it from here. Rest now. I promise we will r=\r\neach the chamber in time for you to be repaired.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With each word Tu=\r\ncson speaks, his voice changes ever so slightly, sounding more and more lik=\r\ne Optimus Prime. Still he himself has no idea that he was ever related to t=\r\nhe great Autobot leader. All he knew is that he admired him greatly not onl=\r\ny as his commander, but as a mentor during his younger years as a rookie Au=\r\ntobot. Tucson could now sense some changes within himself, not only on the =\r\noutside, but on the inside as well. He could have turned to fight whatever =\r\nonslaught was following him, yet he chose not to, and chose to save a life =\r\nover taking one. It was a choice he felt very good about and had no regrets=\r\n to his decision.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Tuscon moved foward the trip was fairl=\r\ny easy at first. The walls\n&gt; and floor were smooth and well made. The halls=\r\n, while somewhat dim\n&gt; were still well lit, especially with the help of his=\r\n headlights. And\n&gt; while weak Vesitge still tried to hold on, slightly guid=\r\ning Tuscon via\n&gt; the sterring wheel to tell him which turns to make and how=\r\n fast to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; However as time went on it was easy to see that Vestige w=\r\nas still\n&gt; slipping away, his hold on the wheel becoming more and more slac=\r\nk as\n&gt; time went on. Also the strange things is that the walls and floor we=\r\nre\n&gt; changing with distance as well. The metal deckplating was becoming\n&gt; r=\r\nougher and rougher, going from the silver and grey of metal to the\n&gt; brown =\r\nand blacks of something strange almost chitinous or shell like.\n&gt; The walls=\r\n began to take on a decidely dark brown cast, and instead of\n&gt; thier smooth=\r\n gleaming surface they began to get rough and jagged,\n&gt; almost like claws a=\r\nnd thorns that sometimes forced Tuscon to slow down\n&gt; to navigate around th=\r\nem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside the vehicle the ominous buzzing sound was getting louder a=\r\nnd\n&gt; louder as Tuscon moved foward, while inside his cab Vestige weakly\n&gt; g=\r\nestured and tried to help. The tunnel straightened as Tuscon drove,\n&gt; but i=\r\nt had also gotten steadily darker and more dangerous, the ground\n&gt; beneath =\r\nhim now feeling more like earth and stone than metal. However\n&gt; ahead of hi=\r\nm he could see a gleaming light. It was as if a door\n&gt; suddenly opened at t=\r\nhe end of a long hall and a light that beckoned\n&gt; Tuscon towards it, but if=\r\n it was to victory or destruction it was\n&gt; difficult to tell.\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside =\r\nTuscon could hear comming from the direction of the light the\n&gt; clear voice=\r\n of Rodimus, &quot;I AM HERE! DRIVE TUSCON! DRIVE!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Inside Tuscon=\r\n&#39;s cab Vestige slumped over, even as several\n&gt; large insect-spider like cre=\r\natures seem to melt out from the darkness\n&gt; in front of the door and stand =\r\nguard over it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We are the horde, and you will go no further!!&quot; The cr=\r\neatures rush\n&gt; foward to attack!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
