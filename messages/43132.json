She sighed. &quot;Geeez, this just isn&#39;t my lifetime. \nFirst I get stuck with this strange maximal who has been right on my \ntail since I left Galvatron&#39;s ship. And now I appear to be getting \ncloser to a whole congregation of them. Why me?&quot; as she sighed and \nlooked up towards the sky. Her maximal signal was stronger than her \npredacon signal. But she was still unaware of the chip inside that \nwas transmitting the strong maximal signature.  She was on the verge \nof giving herself up.  She turned and started to walk directly \ntowards the maximal city. Perhaps she might find some answers. \nShe did keep an optical out, but for the most part, she was tired, \nworn out from trying to outrun this maximal whom she thought was \nbehind her when it was the chip inside her.  She stopped about a half \na mile from the city and gave one last look up towards the sky. She \nraised her hands up to her chest as she talked,&quot;Oh Matrix. Please, \ntell me what purpose you had intended for me. Why bring me back to \nend up like this? Run down by one bot. Chased right into the clutches \nof those whom would see me turned to scrap. Why give me the gifts you \ndid and then just take them away like this? I just don&#39;t get it.&quot; she \nsaid as her shoulders slumped forward.  She hung her head and dragged \nher tail in the dirt beihnd her as she walked towards the maximal \ncity. Little did she know the maximal chip inside her totally covered \nher predacon signal. What more, her old predacon symbol had worn off. \n\n\n"}}
