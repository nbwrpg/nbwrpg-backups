Cyndro reroutes more power to the shields, and then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; activates the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; defences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; The round plate on top of the Element flashed several \n&gt; times, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and then a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; deafening screech was emmited over all comm frequencees \n&gt; other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; than the ones \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; that the Maximals were using. After a few seconds, the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; screech shut off, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; a jamming signal was sent out to disable any \n&gt; communications \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that the enemies \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; might have. During the screech, most of the weapons on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Element fired at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; the hopefully distracted bots, sending four EMP blasts, \n&gt; one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; missile, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; five plasma shots at each one, other than the ones that \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shielded by the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Cybertronian Fire (I think FireBlade is the only one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shielded :).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Mantle spun around when all the enemies arrived, and was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; immediately ready \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; for battle. He flew into the air and stretched out both \n&gt; arms. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A missile flew \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; out of each arm, both of them mentally guided by Mantle \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Rippersnapper. Out of the corner of his eyes, Mantle \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt; &gt; see Aqua firing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; his spear gun at Flesh Ripper, the same bot that he had \n&gt; tried \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to get during \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; the last battle. Near him, Cinder was already firing at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rippersnapper. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Mantle knew that Cinder wanted to impress Prowl, but he \n&gt; hoped \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that she \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; wouldn&#39;t do stupid things to show off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &quot;Allright, guys, we&#39;ll fight like this for a while, and \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we&#39;ll form \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Element and chase these guys out of here!&quot; he said to his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; team over the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; commlink, watching Rubble emerge from the Element with \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; missile launcher \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; and fire two missiles at Rampage. Mist flew by above him, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; firing three \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; charges down at Autofire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
