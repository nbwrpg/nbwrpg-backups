(One has to wonder how the \nrest of the Maximals like hearing this stuff rattling deckplates.)  \nSlipping into the control room, he notices that one of the scanners \nis picking up a homing signal.  Scratching his head, he pulls out a \ndatapad and types out a quick note:  &quot;Gone to check out signal - Back \nsoon.  Jackie.&quot;  Switching off the player, he dashes out, transforms \nto vehicle mode, and races toward the source of the broadcast.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;raccoon7679&quot; &lt;raccoon7679@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Smidgen awoke with a groan. &quot;Whoah, who got the license plate of \n&gt; that worker trransporter that hit me. Uhnnn. Oh, my aching head. \n&gt; What hit me?&quot;  She looked down in her lap to see tools laying there \n&gt; as well as on the console and floor. &quot;Great, of all the rotten \nluck.&quot;\n&gt; She checked the scanner next to the homing beacon. Nothing showed \non \n&gt; it. Plus the auxilury power supply was running low. Soon the beacon \n&gt; would stop sending it&#39;s signal.  She sighed and slowly walked up \nthe \n&gt; ship, holding onto chairs, side railing and floor slats to climb \n&gt; up.  She made her way to the main entrance hatch and opened the \n&gt; door.  The air smelled sweet and fragrant.  Birds chirped and \n&gt; butterflies floated on a gentle breeze.  She breathed in deep and \n&gt; sighed. &quot;Well, at least there aren&#39;t any space pirates around. So \n&gt; count my lucky starts and hope it gets better.&quot;  She climbed out of \n&gt; the door, lost her hold on the rim and tumbled  to the ground.  She \n&gt; lay in an undignified heap for a moment and then got up. She looked \n&gt; around to make sure no bot saw that.  Feeling certain that she was \n&gt; quite alone, she surveyed the damage to her ship. &quot;This pile of \n&gt; ruble will never fly again.&quot;  She pulled a reading meter from her \n&gt; pocket and checked the energon readings. &quot;Hmm, still stable and \n&gt; undamaged so far as I can see.&quot;  She turned suddenly as she thought \n&gt; she heard something out in the forest.  She shrugged her shoulders \n&gt; and turned back to the ship.&quot;Perhaps it&#39;s nothing. Just a wild \n&gt; animal or something.&quot; Still to be precausios, she reacted for her \n&gt; plasma pistal and turned the safety off. &quot;But just to be on the \nsafe \n&gt; side.....&quot; she muttered to herself.\n\n\n"}}
