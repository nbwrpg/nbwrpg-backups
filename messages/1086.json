He was tired and alone, as \nwell as angry. For a few minutes, he lost interest in everything.\n\n&quot;Quickstrike, Terrorize!&quot; he commanded his activation code. He quickly \ntransformed to his robot mode, twisting his body parts around. His claws \nwidened until they were flat, and he cried out as he put pressure on his \nlegs. He stumbled forward and found himself on the ground.\n\nHe grunted and used his awkward hands and arms to lift himself up. He was \nactually risking alot in this mode. He could be more easier detected.\n\nHe sat up, and rolled his trunk, groaning loudly, a little too loudly than \nhe wanted. His leg hurt, badly. Transulas did a good job with wrapping his \nleg up, but all it did was keep his leg from bending and causing him more \npain. He slowly stood, up and tried his luck on his leg, but only managed to \nget anywhere. He stumbled to the side, and fell across a log. His legs \nkicked up. His left leg remained elevated into the air.\n\nHe groaned and tilted his head up. He slowly sat up, sitting on the log he \nfell over.\n\n&quot;Dang.&quot;\n\nHe looked over and saw a small cluster of downed branches. He picked one up, \nand saw it wasn&#39;t the right form. He reached over again and pulled up a \nlonger, sturdier branch. It would make for a fair walking stick. He could \nuse it for balance if it didn&#39;t break.\n\nHe then opened his comm-link to Megatron&#39;s troops. &quot;Anyone out there? Anyone \nat all?&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
