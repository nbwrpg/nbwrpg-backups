The cut had healed almost \ninstantaniously.  It scared her to death.  She just sat on the floor \nlooking at her hand. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; (Hahaha! Atma as second in command. Good one! As I recall JP said \n&gt; Quickstrike was going to be second in command.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike made his way down to a corridor where there were \nmultible doors \n&gt; that lead to the quarters. As he recalled there were at least two \ncorridors \n&gt; with quarters. Not all rooms where quarters as he found out. He \ndidn&#39;t want \n&gt; to have her too close to his quarters.\n&gt; \n&gt; He kept walking down. He decided a quarters for Dark Mouse would be \nall \n&gt; right, but not so close to his. She may just tag along too much, \nbut he \n&gt; could help her out since she wasn&#39;t at her best.\n&gt; \n&gt; He checked a door at the right side of the corridor. It was \nunlocked so he \n&gt; pressed a botton on the side that made the door slide open. He was \njust in \n&gt; luck. It was an empty quarters and it had good enough room for Dark \nMouse. \n&gt; These sets of quarters that the Trypicon had were huge compared to \nthe \n&gt; Darkside&#39;s, and he liked it. He looked around it fully and nodded \nin \n&gt; approval. He walked out and closed it behind him. He walked back to \nthe lab \n&gt; room where Dark Mouse and Black Arachnia were. He leaned against \nthe frame \n&gt; of the door and waited for Black Arachnia to finish with Dark Mouse.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
