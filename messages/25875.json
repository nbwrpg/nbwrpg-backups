(Can bots even \nget headaches?)\n\n&quot;Yeah I guess. I could have been married to Ericson, that&#39;s my \n&#39;betrothed&#39;,&quot; She grimaced &quot;been sitting at tables with countless \nnumbers of forks and knives that you have to use, and on Cybertron&quot;\n\nThe Fuzor shivered at a thundercrack, and folded her arms tighter. \n&quot;But I think this planet is *way* more interesting..&quot; She said \nsincerely.\n\nTeltoli lifted her own eyebrow at Carnage at her reponse. &quot;Really?&quot; \nShe asked. Her voice held a note of suspiscion in it, though. &quot;That \nmust make you pretty old..&quot; She grinned, her mind whirling. Did \nCarnage really crash here? The Fuzor sensed something bigger had \nhappened, but she didn&#39;t voice her thoughts.\n\n\n"}}
