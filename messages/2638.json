It would be against \nhis best interests to kill off the maximals. He looks from Hell Beast to \nMegatron.\n\nHe glances at the slots in the cealing which contain the internal autoguns. \nHe needed this treaty with the predacons, though, and killing them would not \nbe the best way of acomplishing that.\n\n&quot;The best way of neutralizing an enemy is killing it. I don&#39;t think the \nnewcomers would look very nicely on a treaty. From their preformance on the \nbattlefield, they have proved that they could crush both of our factions... I \nsuggest getting contacting the maximals.... Together, the three of us could \ncrush these newcomers.&quot;\n\n"}}
