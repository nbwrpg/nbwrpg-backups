Pacifix walked outside, and stretched \nknowing that this would be his last day on the planet he had called \nhome for so many years. &quot;Ok.&quot; He opened an encrypted commlink \nto all Autobots who were going on the mission. (Crossroads, JetV, \nArtemis, Gold bug, Jazz, Metalwarhawk, Technobots, Hoist -- the \n&#39;old friend&#39; that Ironhide sent, Trailblazer, Grimlock, Swoop, Slag, \nSnarl, Sludge, and any other Autobots that I haven&#39;t mentioned) \n&quot;All Autobots that are going to participate in this cruitial mission of \nsecrecy, please report to the hidden Autobots shuttle, and wait \nthere for me to arrive. Pacifix out.&quot; Pacifix transforms into APC \nmode and heads out towards his quarters to collect his stuff.\n\nSwoop transforms into pterodactyl mode, and flies out towards the \nlaunch site. \n\nCrossroads gets the message while he was approaching the \nlaunch site for the ship. He aririve at the entrance, and hops into it, \nappearing at the bottom. He walks around the ship, finds a crate to \nsite on, moves it to the large open area which Pacifix would \nprobably use for his farwell speech. He sits down on the crate \nwaiting for Pacifix.\n\n\n\nOn 18 May 2001, at 8:08, robertdahl wrote:\n\n&gt; Ironhide frowned at how this had degenerated.
