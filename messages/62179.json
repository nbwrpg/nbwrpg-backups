He was not yet sure what these\npeople were up to, and the fact that they didn&#39;t want him to leave was\ndisturbing to him.\n\nHe finished the inspection and found that they were completely\nrepairable given he had access to some fuel for welding, some scrap\nmetal, and a really long amount of time.  Once repaired these engines\ncould either be used to supplement the emergency power and recharge\nthe batteries, or if the ship&#39;s structure could be repaired, these\nengines could be used as a means of propulsion\n\n\nOn Mon, 1 Nov 2004 12:38:24 -0800 (PST), robert riley\n&lt;bustercross365@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hellplague:\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;I do not know if there is any lubracant on board, it is not my ship.

By the way, do you have any lubricating\n&gt; oil onboard?  My shoulder is begining to show signs of friction. \n&gt; Anyway, I will be finished inspecting your engines in about 100 cycles\n&gt; and at that point I will be able to tell you if these engines are\n&gt; salvagable.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron then abruptly turned away from Hellplague and returned to his work.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, 29 Oct 2004 09:35:36 -0700 (PDT), robert riley\n&gt; &lt;bustercross365@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague stirred a while later, and sat up in the bed.

Taking out two hand fulls, she stepped out and decided\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; Celeron needed reward for his work on the computer.  She heard someone in\n&gt; &gt; the back of the ship, and she stepped back there and found Celeron\n&gt; &gt; inspecting the engines.  She cleared her throat and handed Celeron a few\n&gt; &gt; cubes of energon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; rm2kmidi &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After a few hours, Celeron woke up.

He looked around for a light switch, then\n&gt; &gt; began checking the condition of all the equipment in the engine hold. \n&gt; &gt; He figured this would take at least 2 hours....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;NOW...
