Not good, not good at all.&quot;\n\nHe continues his flight while carefull=\r\ny tending to his comrade. \n\n&quot; Leo Prime, I am flying Noctorro back to the d=\r\namaged Fuzors and I will stand guard with them until help arrives.  In the =\r\nmean time, Rodimus has fallen back into evil hands and I think it&#39;s best if=\r\n he is barred from leadership duties until further notice.

We can&#39;t affo=\r\nrd to take any chances.&quot;\n\nNightshift continues to keep his doors locked and=\r\n engine in drive for quick escape if need be.  He wasn&#39;t about to let Dark =\r\nRodimus get to Elita.  If anything he knew that returning her to the Ark wo=\r\nuld also put his other comrades at risk.

She looks around quickly and r=\r\nealizes the\n&gt;&gt; terrain was full of trees that may be damaged but were still=\r\n stable enough\n&gt;&gt; to hold her weight.  She jumps up to catch a hanging bran=\r\nch and like a\n&gt;&gt; skilled acrobat, she manages to swing herself up higher in=\r\nto the trees.\n&gt;&gt; From there, she could see a large branch severely cracked,=\r\n hanging right\n&gt;&gt; over Dark Rodimus&#39;s head.     She then spots a large tree=\r\n root at the edge\n&gt;&gt; of what looked like a tar pool.  How convenient was th=\r\nat?  And she certainly\n&gt;&gt; was fast enough to dart out of the way if she had=\r\n to.  But if she could only\n&gt;&gt; break that branch without falling out of the=\r\n tree herself.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Hmmm...  He&#39;s right, we typically are kinda predict=\r\nable..  So why not try\n&gt;&gt; something original?  Now how deep is that crack?&quot;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; She examines the crack in the branch.  She finds that with just a s=\r\ntrong hit\n&gt;&gt; with a sharp object, the branch would definitely come down. Sh=\r\ne raises a\n&gt;&gt; brow, aims her arm launcher and fires at the crack in the bra=\r\nnch.  She hits\n&gt;&gt; her target as the branch cracks loudly and detaches from =\r\nthe damaged tree\n&gt;&gt; with a loud creaking noise.  She hoped her first plan o=\r\nf attack would work.\n&gt;&gt; Phase two would also prove difficult as she waits t=\r\no see how the chips fall,\n&gt;&gt; literally.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Timber..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW =E2=\r\n=80=93 Dark Rodimus&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: Remember, I said the figure stepped into a =\r\nclearing.
