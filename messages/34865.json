One very large Autobot had \nalready\n&gt; &gt; &gt; smashed his desk, and was standing at his full height, very \nupset.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ironhide knew he was in for trouble, &quot;Is there a problem \nGrimlock?&quot; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; asked, knowing there is. &quot;YES THERE PROBLEM&quot; Grimlock yelled, \nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; voice echoing very clearly throughout all of Iocon. &quot;THIS \nBULLSHIT.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; YOU SEND ROOKIES TO FIGHT IN WAR THAT AFFECT WHOLE GALAXY, EVEN \nWHOLE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; TIME.

He pulled out his energon sword, and in one \nswipe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cleaved his whole rows podium straight in half.

This \nwasnt the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first time this happened. &quot;Grimlock, you know that if one of us \ngoes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Predacons will be on to us,&quot; He said calmly. &quot;None of us \ncan go&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Grimlock looked back up, then crossed his arms, his sword just \nabove\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his head, still shimmering, the energy intesifing the look of \nrage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his crimson eyes. &quot;Then I go to earth to&quot; he said quietly, and \nhe was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; almost not heard with the large amount of gasps that escaped \naround\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the room.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
