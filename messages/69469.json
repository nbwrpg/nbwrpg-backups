Fi=\r\nrst you must have a proper body, and I shall craft and form it myself. COme=\r\n, it will not do for you to remain so unguarded such as you are,&quot; the Decep=\r\nticon stated, raising his arm to guide the spark back to the medical bay. A=\r\nt this stage he could easily modify the intermediate body already under con=\r\nstruction to something she would like.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It has been a long time=\r\n since I had someone near I could trust,&quot; he stated, accessing the console =\r\nand began actively changing the sparkless body to what would be the physica=\r\nl manifestation of the spark.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The fiery spark followed him t=\r\no the Med Bay. Amazing how it could last so long without a form but there w=\r\nas a determination, something unique about this spark. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the med bay=\r\n... the form - nothing more than a jumbled mess of metal and parts - was co=\r\nming along well enough. The spark hovered over the form as though inspectin=\r\ng it. Silent for now as speaking took so much energy; drawing that energy f=\r\nrom it&#39;s surroundings in order to manifest. \n&gt; As it hovered over the face,=\r\n distorted and incomplete, like a human skull without skin or muscle. A sli=\r\nght movement and the spark shifted to hover over the torso before it shot i=\r\nnto and disappearing into the torso. A humming pulse as a bright glow emina=\r\nted from the upper torso of the incomplete form. \n&gt; \n&gt; She awaited for the =\r\nnew body to be completed. Ready for action, ready for life. The crimson opt=\r\nics flashed somewhat then pulsed. The vocalizer attempted to warm up as it =\r\nattempted to speak. The crimson optics glowed brightly and then remained st=\r\neadily glowing, and finally... she spoke. \n&quot;Uaahhhh,&quot; she sighed as though =\r\nbreathless, &quot;I thank you.&quot; her volcalizer reverberated the voice that was e=\r\nver so familiar. A deep femme&#39;s voice in a wry sultry malicious tone. It wa=\r\ns the trademark voice of Maxima. \n&quot;For so long have I sought to restore my =\r\nspark to a proper body fit for a Decepticon,&quot; her words expressed in almost=\r\n a slurred speech, as though exhausted. But she was able to speak nonethele=\r\nss. \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
