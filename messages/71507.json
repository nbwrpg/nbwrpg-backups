Slag, those two were always rank&#39;n o=\r\nn me.  But I tried ta ignore &#39;em.  Then one day, Ohh this is sweet, one day=\r\n it happened again and I wound back up in Ratchet&#39;s office.

Well, not only did he hear them, he saw them do&#39;n it =\r\nand slag, you didn&#39;t wanna be around Tucson that time, because he had the l=\r\nook of destruction in his eyes.  Now mind ya, they knew better not ta scrap=\r\n around with him because he&#39;d slag &#39;em real good if they did.

I sure hated those guys, I wasn=\r\n&#39;t as fast as they were and \n    they knew it.&nbsp; So of course they&#39;d al=\r\nways chose me as their \n    target.&nbsp; Ratchet was aware of that, and he=\r\n never got agitated when I \n    came in.&nbsp; But what was worse, I&#39;d neve=\r\nr hear the end of it from \n    Sunstreaker and Sideswipe.&nbsp; Slag, those=\r\n two were always rank&#39;n on \n    me.&nbsp; But I tried ta ignore &#39;em.&nbsp; =\r\nThen one day, Ohh this is sweet, \n    one day it happened again and I wound=\r\n back up in Ratchet&#39;s office. Tucson \n    was mak&#39;n a delivery of supplies =\r\nbefore he got shot blind, and those two \n    were pull&#39;n their scrap on me.=\r\n&nbsp; Well, not only did he hear them, he saw \n    them do&#39;n it and slag, =\r\nyou didn&#39;t wanna be around Tucson that time, because \n    he had the look o=\r\nf destruction in his eyes.&nbsp; Now mind ya, they knew \n    better not ta =\r\nscrap around with him because he&#39;d slag &#39;em real good if they \n    did.&nbs=\r\np; All they had ta do was look into his optics and they turned \n    around =\r\nand apologized ta me without a single word outa Tucson&#39;s mouth.&nbsp; \n    =\r\nAfter that, it never happened again.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nHe sighs gently.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&quot;

And definitely no one ever messed with \n    Ratchet.&=\r\nnbsp; Ohh no, that was considered taboo.&nbsp; Maan I sure miss \n    those =\r\ntimes.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perpetually on the move and constantly busy. &lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On Jul 21, 2011, at 3:11 AM, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;&lt;A \n =\r\n   href=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002@...&quot;&gt;&lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002@h=\r\notmail.com&quot;&gt;airly2002@...&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&gt;

But I think we ha=\r\nve a way to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reproduce it \n        controllably, as long as you thin=\r\nk your spark can handle&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        it.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Nightshift \n        looks to Nightlight with a f=\r\nriendly smile. He was happy to &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n        see&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; that N=\r\nightlight remembered who he was. He had also been \n        concerned for &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&gt; her&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; safety as were the \n        others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; And I&#39;d go through it again too, if I \n        had ta. It&#39;s r=\r\neal nice ta have &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ya&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; back. I just \n        wish we =\r\nknew what Hydras weakness is. The problem is that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n        guy&#39;=\r\ns got too many sets of eyes on &#39;em and in his alt form... Wait Thats \n     =\r\n   &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; it,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; why didn&#39;t I think of this before? \n       =\r\n Nightlight, I get it now. I bet that &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; he lost \n=\r\n        all visual capabilities, Hydras would be severely compromised. \n   =\r\n     &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; On&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the other hand, Tucson lost the last fight=\r\n \n        because Hydras had &#39;em at a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; disadvantage. But if Tucs=\r\non took \n        out all his visual circuitry, then he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; would ha=\r\nve the upper \n        hand. Tucson&#39;s been blind a long time, it&#39;s second&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nature ta \n        him ta fight that way. But it&#39;s not for Hydras=\r\n. \n        &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; He turns his head over to \n        Bum=\r\np.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; How would we go about knock&#39;n out Hydras \n    =\r\n    visual circuitry?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n        There was a noncommital shrug from BUMP, &quot;Well a simple \n        f=\r\nlash-bang&lt;BR&gt;&gt; grenade could do it. It is basically a bright light \n    =\r\n    followed by a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; deafening noise.&quot; He shrugged again, &quot;I am not \n =\r\n       typically a weapons&lt;BR&gt;&gt; engineer, but they should be in the weap=\r\nons \n        stores.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; BUMP glanced at the readouts displayi=\r\nng \n        NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s vital signs,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; nodding when everything looke=\r\nd good. \n        He looked back at NIGHTSHIFT,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Did you have anythi=\r\nng specific in \n        mind?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (TAG)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n     =\r\n   Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        -------------------------------=\r\n-----&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
