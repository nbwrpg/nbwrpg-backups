But if this were you, I \n&gt;trust you would do the same.&quot;\n\nFor a moment, as Rodimus stood there before this somewhat smaller Autobot there was a brief moment of clarity, a small instant of indecision. This Autobot showed a bravery and strength that seemed oddly familiar to him. \n\n&gt;&quot; All right, have it your way Rodimus. This is going to hurt me \n&gt;more than it will hurt you.&quot; \n\nHowever the moment passed as the dark Predacon shell programming that twisted his own kicked in. He smiled, as he cracked his knuckles, &quot;You&#39;re right, this is *will* hurt you more than it will hurt me.&quot; Rodimus replied in mocking tones. \n\nWith a quick motion he stepped foward to snap a quick punch towards Tuscon&#39;s head, ready to end this battle with this little upstart Autobot - there was something about him that annoyed him!\n\nIn the meantime Cyclonus and Scourge had stepped back; watching the opening of the battle with looks of eagerness as they studied the moves of both combants.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus)\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
