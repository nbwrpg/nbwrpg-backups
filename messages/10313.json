He listened to Dinobot&#39;s words\ncarefully.  Very carefully.  This bot was born as a Predacon, but turned\nover to the Maximals.  Hakibuscon knew that Dinobot had been thinking about\nsomething.  Something called the past.  Hakibuscon thought about his own\npast.  He wasn&#39;t born as a Maximal.  He wasn&#39;t born as a Predacon.  And he\nwasn&#39;t born as whatever you call bots of the Alliance.  He was just..born. \nHakibuscon wasn&#39;t too peaceful like the Maximals, yet he wasn&#39;t a killer\nlike the Predacons.  What was he?  He was just...himself.  No leaders.  No\norders.  No factions.................No purpose.  Hakibuscon was nothing. \nJust a interference in the raging war.\n\n\t&quot;I will leave you alone, and when I leave don&#39;t even let me cross your\nmind for a second.  Don&#39;t tell anyone about me.  Pretend you never met me\nok?!!&quot; Hakibuscon said in a calm but sort of glum voice.  Hakibuscon walked\naway, but stopped for a second.  Hakibuscon turned around and walked\nstraight back, but had no intentions of hurting anyone.  He walked past\nDinobot to the place where Dinobot had been drinking.  He grabbed his\nmissile gun and threw it into the water.  Then he pulled out his ray gun,\nsnapped it across his knee and threw it into the water as well.  Hakibuscon\nstood still for a second and then grabbed out his best weapon which he had\nhad for many solar-cycles.  It was a laser sword.  He looked at it dearly\nfor a moment, and decided that it too, had to go.  He threw it as hard as\nhe could and then started walking away.  \n\n\t&quot;Goodbye.  I serve no purpose to this war.  I simply don&#39;t belong.  Nobody\nor nothing needs me.  Like I said, never remember me!&quot; Hakibuscon said\nsadly.  He screamed in anger and sadness then went vehicle mode and sped\naway.\n\n\t\n\n"}}
