Even if that over rated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hot rod gets=\r\n his tailpipes outa that mean phase of his, no way I&#39;m gonna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; trust =\r\nhim anymore. I seriously hope we can retrieve the Matrix and get it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n outa that backstabber before it&#39;s too late.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The=\r\nre is smile from WING CALIBER as he takes the device and examines&lt;BR&gt;it for=\r\n a moment. Then with a nod he presses a few buttons and slides&lt;BR&gt;it into t=\r\nhe recieiving section of his computer console.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With a few deft movem=\r\nents he activates the final sequence of commands&lt;BR&gt;and turns to look at th=\r\ne screen . . .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The screen is black, a single phrase bouncing along t=\r\nhe screen reading&lt;BR&gt;&#39;no signal&#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Slag.&quot; LEO said out loud before h=\r\ne looked embarrased and glanced at&lt;BR&gt;NIGHTLIGHT and ELITA. &quot;I meant . . . =\r\naw nuts! . . . What happened?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;WING SABER looked at the screen for a=\r\n moment confusion clearly on his&lt;BR&gt;face. &quot;The machine was clearly picking =\r\nup something it had a&lt;BR&gt;location.&quot; he stepped back to the console as he ma=\r\nnipulated a few&lt;BR&gt;other controls. &quot;Let&#39;s see what it recorded.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The=\r\n screen goes from being black to a replay of the scene where DARK&lt;BR&gt;RODIMU=\r\nS was facing down SCOURGE, the Sweeps, NIGHTSHIFT and STRAIGHT&lt;BR&gt;SHOT. The=\r\n screen got bigger as the minicam approached DARK RODIMUS, in&lt;BR&gt;the corner=\r\n were cordinates indicating where they were at the time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then the sc=\r\nreen went black, presumably where DARK RODIMUS vanished&lt;BR&gt;from sight and t=\r\nhen the screen went black again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;That didn&#39;t show us much.&quot; LEO sai=\r\nd, clearly getting preturbed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Patience.&quot; WING CALIBER said as he ca=\r\nrefully reran the scene in slow&lt;BR&gt;motion. He zipped back the point where D=\r\nARK RODIMUS vanished and ran&lt;BR&gt;it again slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Look!&#39; WING CALIBE=\r\nR said as he pointed at the corner of the screen&lt;BR&gt;that showed coordinates=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the corner the cordinates changed. One moment they were showing=\r\n the&lt;BR&gt;cordinates of where the Dinosaurs had been and the stand off had&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;occured. Then for a micro second they showed something else, and then&lt;BR&gt;w=\r\nent blank.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Rewind that.&quot; LEO said, his voice more interested this t=\r\nime.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The scene backed up second by second until if finally showed th=\r\ne new&lt;BR&gt;cordinate. &quot;We GOT HIM!&quot; LEO said as he smacked one fist into the&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;other.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Not so fast.&quot; WING CALIBER said. &quot;We only have a partial =\r\ncordinate.&lt;BR&gt;But we can now get close.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(TAG)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Preston&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;CLEAR: both; COL=\r\nOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt; \t\t \t   \t\t  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--_8ada5623-a72c-4876-b6f7-22e64a8452a0_--\r\n\n"}}
