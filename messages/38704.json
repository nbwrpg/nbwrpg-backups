Leaving her back leg numb and almost \nuseless. &lt; Clever...but not enough...&gt; she thought as she tried to get a \nbetter hold of her prey.\nHell Drak would be looking right into the face of a blue eyed monster if she \ncared to look; though no harm would come to her.\nQuickly IR passed through the ceiling and off into another hall completely, \none arm wrapped around Hell Drak and the other three used for movement.\nShe pushed past and bunch of copper wiring that sparked as she passed, \nmaking her ghastly form look even MORE deadly and frightening before she \nstopped and looked at Hell Drak. A smile creeping over her lips, baring \nwickedly sharp teeth.*\n\n&quot; If this was real, you would be in my stomach by now.&quot;\n\n* Her black tongue ran over silver fangs, leaving drops of acidic saliva to \ndrop and sizzle.*\n\n&quot; And I wouldn&#39;t think twice about it either.&quot;\n\n*Iron then let go of Hell Drak, moving so that she would be sitting back on \nher haunches.*\n\n&quot; You&#39;ve underestimated me. That&#39;s mistake #1.   #2 Is that, if you would \nhave looked before shot...you were seriously overpowered. #3...the odds are \nagainst you.  These are the things that happen in real battles.  \nEverything&#39;s unpredictable and looks are deceiving.\nThis is a dirty war, remember that.&quot;\n\n* So with that she stood up and shock, looking down through the ceiling.*\n\n&quot; Plus my species doesn&#39;t take prisoners so youï¿½re out. Dead.  Maybe you can \nfind a battle simulation to tie you over until we&#39;re through here.\nHave fun.&quot;\n\n* Seconds later she was gone, through a near by vent in a flash of black. \nHeading south towards the radioactive waste again.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
