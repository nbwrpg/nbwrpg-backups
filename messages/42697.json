Decapitron shot a\nplasma saw blade at Maximal City.  Headshot, from a distance, sprayed a few\nsniper shots at Maximal City.  Gutclaw, being a close-combat warrior, had\nsome trouble, not too much though.  He kept running and dodging shots from\nthe defense.  He went over by Skullgrin and fired some pistol shots from a\npistol,(duh) he found.  Legtrap shot a special net-shield thingies and they\nmade slightly protective barriers around all the Decepticons attacking.\nThen, Legtrap fired a missile at Maximal City.  Explobody, who was now\nloving it already, fired some grenades at Maximal City, after all, he wasn&#39;t\ncalled Explobody for nothing, he was demolitions all the way!\n~~~~~~~~~\nSkullgrin transformed into tank mode and fired some blasts at Maximal City.\n~~~~~~~~\nTriggerhappy continued to hide and wait for more reinforcements.\n~~~~~~~~~\nJume and Whee shot some more blasts at Maximal City.\n~~~~~~~~~\nQuatro heard the attackers and the announcement, and got his phase-disruptor\nrifle ready to kick some Decepticlown butt.  He headed for the entrance...\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHakibuscon, who happened to be roaming around Africa, saw the attack.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll help them......I must kill Quatro, as well,&quot; he said, secretly from\nnowhere firing a shot from a fusion cannon at Maximal City.\n\n\n"}}
