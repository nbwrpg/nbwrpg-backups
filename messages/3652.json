There&#39;s a more specific post then.)\n\nSnow Tech growled as he saw almost every one of the\nenemy fire upon Dinobot, his battle rage and\nexcitement only building as he saw his weapon strike\nanother. He turned and looked at each one of the enemy\nin turn but aimed his lightning gun towards Koga Shuko\nand fired off an oray of 7 shots towards his chest. It\nwasn&#39;t fair that they were ganging up on another bot\nlike that, didn&#39;t they have any rules or something\nthat went against that. Then suddenly Snow Tech got a\ndumb look on his face, they were Predacons...they had\nno rules!\nShadow Cat glared at all of the Predacons who insisted\non firing upon Dinobot, her own rage rising to the\npoint of her reaching behind and taking out her\nsplatter gun. With careful aim she pointed the barel\nof it towards Serpentor and fired off about 4 shots\nbefore aiming her weapon towards Sixshot and firing at\nhim as well.\nShe didn&#39;t like the fact that they were outnumbered\nand she didn&#39;t like the fact that everyone seemed to\nbe getting too damaged to fight...it was almost\nhopeless.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages with Yahoo!
