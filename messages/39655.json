There was no way Hellpeon could control that much energy, yet he was, but the energy must have been super disrupted.  Ultimo tried to think of something, any thing to save his hide.  He turned off the energy field, then bringing back his arm thrgouh it forward sending his shield flying through the air at the ball in Hellpeons hand.  The shield could be jsut enough to disrupt the enregy ball causing it to explode, unfortunatly, Ultimo was still within the range of the explosionshould it happen.\n\nnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As Ultimos orb approached the one in hellpeons hands, it began to \n&gt; fizzle and go flat before it streched and went straight into the orb \n&gt; in front of him making it bigger. Then energy began to go into the \n&gt; orb from Ultimos Energy field. Hellpeon cackled at this as the orb \n&gt; ebgan to glow and crackle brilliantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hellpeon: &quot;Nice try but that is just feeding the attack.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ultimo smiled as Hellpeon began this attack. �Two huge wings shot \n&gt; from his back shooting him into the air. �Once there, he looked down \n&gt; to the ball and took aim. �&quot;Muchos, use all energy to make a \n&gt; barrette.&quot; he said. �\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Complete&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A massive energy barrette grew on the end of the rifle, with as \n&gt; much energy to match that of the ball Hellpeon was making. �Feeling \n&gt; no loss of energy, he pulled the trigger of his rifle and the \n&gt; barrette shot off forming a ball of energy that was heading straight \n&gt; for the other one Hellpeon had. �&quot;Lets jsut see how much you can \n&gt; handle.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With that Ultimo pulled his shield close a energy force field \n&gt; fallign around him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; nbwrpg@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hellpeons sword twirled int eh ari while it was fung and then \n&gt; landed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; next to Ultimos foot. As it did and the energy barette came near \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hellpeon, he quickly twirled off to the side and smirked as he \n&gt; stood \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the sand. His body began to pulse somewhat as his body began \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; crackle with energy, his eyes began to glow red and his body an \n&gt; eery \n&gt; &gt; &gt; black. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hellpeon: &quot;You seem somewhat worthy of a fighter... but play time \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; over...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; With that said Hellpeon began to gather a large amount of \n&gt; Chaochitan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy into his palms, energy swirling into the orb as bits of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy from Hacha&#39;s remains flew into the ball as well. Then the \n&gt; ball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; seemed to begin to draw solar energy and evergy generated by the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; slight wind, and perhaps some energy from Ultimo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ultimo took a step back &quot;Energy Barrette&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Online&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A long barrette of pure energy so condense it made a solid able \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; change in shape. �Ultimo hit the sabre to the side then parried \n&gt; by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; having the �barrette extend towards Hellpeons sword hand. �With \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other hand he threw �his shield in front of the blast but it \n&gt; knocked \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him back a bit from the close range, also obscurring the attack \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his barrete causing Ultimo to swing his arm up the extended \n&gt; barrette \n&gt; &gt; &gt; going straight at Hellpeons neck from the chest area.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nbwrpg@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as the flame came towards him it was quickly repeled by \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; barrier of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chaochtian energy. And once again Hellpeon tried to skewer \n&gt; Ultimo \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sabre before releasing a large blast at him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://webmail.netscape.com/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at \n&gt; http://webmail.netscape.com/\n&gt;\n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
