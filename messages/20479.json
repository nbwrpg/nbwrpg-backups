She wasn&#39;t sure what to do. She \nlooked and saw that the bear wasn&#39;t attacking. She sniffed the scent \nof the bear as it got closer.  It smelled familiar. She couldn&#39;t pin \npoint it, but she had smelled that bear scent before. She looked at \nthe polar bear. Then it hit her. THIS BEAR WAS HER DNA DONOR!. She \nsmiled. The bear might take her for a sibling if she smelled like \nthis polar bear that was appraching her. She took a few steps towards \nit and lowered head as a sign of submissiveness. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OK Logo lets throw in a little suspense into this game.\n&gt; \n&gt; A scent filled the air for a Polar bear. She knew something was \nnearby. She\n&gt; went over the hill and saw another bear. The scent was familiar, but\n&gt; different. AS if it were a family member. It started downhill \nthrough the\n&gt; snow toward it&#39;s mirror image. It could sense that it&#39;s twin was in \npain and\n&gt; it&#39;s curiosity filled it&#39;s instincts.\n\n\n"}}
