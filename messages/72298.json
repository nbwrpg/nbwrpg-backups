He then retracts his tail and\n&gt; snakes it tauntingly over Hard Head and Hydra&#39;s weapons.  If he wanted to he\n&gt; could snap his tail and cause them to drop their weapons but he decides just\n&gt; to have a little fun with the trio instead.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Energy weapons will only take you so far.  Now, if I wanted to, I could\n&gt; constrict your weapons to the point of implosion, just with a coil of my\n&gt; tail but, I think I&#39;ll be nice this time and spare you all the humility. I\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want you to look bad around your master would I?  But how fun it\n&gt; would be to sssstrangle all of you in the coils of my tail.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He talks with a chilling hiss in his voice.  He knew that a little theatrics\n&gt; went a long way.  When in doubt play the part of a beast that is commonly\n&gt; feared for his predatory nature.  It was definitely not in his character but\n&gt; he knew he had to step outside the box this time.  Everyone depended on him,\n&gt; and he wasn&#39;t about to let anyone down.\n&gt;\n&gt; Along the way, he comes across a piece of metal on the ground.  It gets\n&gt; caught in his tail which coils around it, breaking it into tiny pieces,\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nGUILEDART just looked at TUSCON as if he were daft, as if inwardly\nwondering if his master hadn&#39;t made some impossible mistake in letting\nthis maxial into the games. He shook his head as they walked.\n\nHARDHEAD and HYDRA watched as TUSCON snapped the metal object with his\ntail, there was a glaring at the discarded metal fragments.\n\nGUILEDART and his men finally brought TUSCON to a much lower level of\nthe facility, here the walls were still metallic, their cut and\ndisigned was for strength and endurance. The butressing beams that\nhelped the already thick bulkheads were thick and powerful as they ran\nfrom floor to cieling, spaced about 20 feet apart they were each\nalmost 5 feet thick. From the curve of the walls and the butressing it\nresmbled more of a ship then a base, but if it was, it must be huge as\nthe lift they were on had come down several levels.\n\nGUILEDART walked TUSCON past a guard station and into an area which\nresembled a prison.\n\nAs the guards let them past they walked past cells, inside there were\ncreatures of all different types. The front of the cells had duranium\nbars coupled with a shield to keep anyone from breaking through. The\nair smelled dank, like bodilly waste, rust and motor oil as well as\nseveal other unidentifiable odors.\n\nAs GUILEDART led TUSCON down the long line of cells different\ncreatures came to the front of their cells and started whistling and\ncalling out to TUSCOn, most jeering at him.\n\n&quot;Fresh meat!&quot; One yelled.\n\n&quot;Ready for the scrap heap!&quot; Yelled another.\n\nGUILEDART just walked on leading TUSCON, with HARDHEAD and HYDRA\nbringing up the rear. They past different sets of guards as they\nwalked.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
