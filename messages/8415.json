He couldn&#39;t belive she\nthought\n&gt; that she could actually defeat him! The smile disapears from his face as\nhe\n&gt; sees the other rocket heading for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus raises an arm to shield his face, flying sideways, but a bit too\nlate.\n&gt; The rocket grazes his arm, exploding. Zardus is blown the oposite\ndirection,\n&gt; his jetpack coming back on to stop him from slamming into a tree. He\ngrowls.\n&gt; Apart from being charred, there was no major damage as far as his systems\n&gt; could detect.\n&gt;\n&gt; He sets his jetpack on full power, flying toward Kamodia and deactivating\nit\n&gt; a bit off the ground, falling the rest of the way. He lands perfectly,\n&gt; rolling to his feet near Kamodia and taking out his sword in one fluid\n&gt; motion. He slashes the sword at Kamodia.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
