All systems at \nare 100%, scans report no Cybertronian units in the vicinity.&quot; some bridge \nofficer replied.\n\n&quot;Good,&quot; Kaiser said with a nod, activating his personal comm. unit, \n&quot;Vice-President Suka prepare a garrison of seventy-five lightly armed peoples \nand after we have landed erect a perimeter guard a hundred feet out of the \nfiring range of the Otyebis&#39; defenses.&quot;\n\nThe viewscreen displayed the greenish burnt ground below the Otyebis where \nthe ship was destined to land, the ground appearing to get closer very \nrapidly.  \n\n&quot;Hold onto something.&quot; Nemo ordered, everyone present on the bridge doing as \nhe said as the Otyebis&#39; main thrusters burst to life and lightly shook the \nship, no warning given to anyone that was outside of the bridge.  The flames \nburnt into the ground several hundred feet below the Otyebis and slowed the \nships descent even more, the city-sized craft softly touching to the ground \nwith a light jolt that wouldn&#39;t even knock over a few month old infant.  \n&quot;Congratulations everyone on a successful landing.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, but we&#39;re not done yet.  Sinew, I want full reports from all sections \nof the craft on their condition.  Sequencer, send out the welcoming \ntransmission when Suka&#39;s perimeter guard is set up.  I also want reserve \ntroops pulled, this is a volatile world with many different fanatical \nfactions and I don&#39;t want anything messed up.  We have over five hundred \nthousand civilians on board eager for the games, and when the satellites are \nsent up hundreds of billions of lifeforms will be watching from their homes.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
