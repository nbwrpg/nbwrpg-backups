She stands 5 foot tall in bot\n&gt;form and has a black panther maximal form.  She&#39;s a scout and a recon\n&gt;soldier. Currently, she&#39;s just landed and I can&#39;t think of where to\n&gt;place her since I heard that the planet was reformated and I  have no\n&gt;clue as to where the continents are or any of the bases.  So, I will\n&gt;need some help as far as getting her to a maximal base at this point.\n&gt;\n&gt;Panzer fell down somewhere in a mountain range in Europe somewhere. I\n&gt;know it&#39;s vague, but it&#39;s the best I can do untill I get the rest\n&gt;figured out.  BTW, I&#39;ll just stick with two chars for a while. I\n&gt;don&#39;t think I can handle much more than that right now. Thanx.\n&gt;\n&gt;Logo.\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
