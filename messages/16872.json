He might as well find out what this was about. \nHe could always turn around. He trotted after Megatron.\n\n\n\n\nQuickstrike jolted as he heard the explosion. All his senses went up. \nHe poked his head from the turn of a corridor. His olfactory sensors \nwere going crazy. He was smelling Megatron. He groaned and ran after \nthe smell. He smelt Maximals while he was at it. He powered up after \nthat. He felt a fight comming on, and it was exciting him. \n\nHe opened up his comm-link to the others in the base. &quot;Any of y&#39;all \nhear that?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
