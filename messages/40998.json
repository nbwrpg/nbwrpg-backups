It also seems \nthat there is some Constructicon discontent. Assessing the \nsituation. . .  Havotron is loosing support rapidly, and will likely \nloose this encounter. Lord Megatron will be pleased to know of the \nreturn of the Constructicons, and Soundwave.&gt;&gt; Having decided \nMegatron was more fit to lead the decepticon forces to victory, he \nejects several cassettes, &quot;Frenzy, Spasstik, Rumble: eject. \nOperation Dissention.&quot; He sends a silent command to his \ncassettes: &#39;Havotron will loose this encounter to Megatron&#39;s forces, \nthe Constructicons, and us. On my signal, you will attack.&#39; \nSoundwave waits patiently for the Constructicons decide which \nside they will follow: Megatron&#39;s.\n\nSwitchblade spins from display to display inside the control room \nof the Dark Avian, watching the happenings outside all the while. \nHe notes that the power supplies are mostly depleted, and once \nthe base is moved, there will have to be an energon search to \nmake sure that the base will continue running, and not off of \nauxiliary power. One bot outside, he watches with more intrest \nthan the others, his former partner, is Soundwave. He watches as \nthree other cassettes are ejected, and he frowns, not sure whether \nto consider him and ally or an enemy. Arming the portable laser \nturrects, he prepares to use them, regardless of who gets in the \nway outside. He frowns even more as he considers the \nconsequenses of the formation of Devastator, but manages to \nconvince himself that his allies outside will probably be able to \nkeep him busy for long enough to allow the ship to escape the area.\n\nSwitchblade fires the directional thrusters, and turns the ship \naround in the water of Hudson&#39;s Bay to face it&#39;s exit. The rear minor \nthrust boosters fire, without a significant push, but just enough to \nget the large ship moving. While tapping on the keys, he opens a \nprivate encrypted commlink to his Decepticon allies, &quot;Firestrike \nreport the situation outside.&quot; He asks his loyal servant with a \ndevious smile, &quot;Domnijoe, BlindChaos, and Blindchaos, follow \nFirestrike&#39;s lead, for now. Autofire, hold you position unless \nattacked, then destroy the enemy.&quot; Chuckling to himself, \nSwitchblade keeps a vigilate eye on the controls to the ship, \nmaking sure he doesn&#39;t run into any shallow water.\n\nooC: lol, been a while since I last posted with Bonecrusher... well, \nsince I last posted at all I guess. =) I&#39;ve got this bad feeling \nsomething in this post is incorrect... oh well. =P\n\n"}}
