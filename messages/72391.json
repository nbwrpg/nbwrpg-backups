I guess I really got into my training exercises .  =\r\nGood thing you spoke up.&quot;\n\nHe then turns to face Big Convoy.\n\n&quot; Master Yoki=\r\ntron trained me in both forms and then he took me aside and trained me a bi=\r\nt further than what was normally taught in training academy.  Nightshift wa=\r\ns trained along side with me, and not too many bots were given the opportun=\r\nity that we were given.  I feel a bit incomplete, like as if I&#39;m missing a =\r\ncomponent of myself.  I always fought with Nightshift beside me and togethe=\r\nr we would defeat our opponents.  And if Magmatron is believed to have such=\r\n training, I will have to work extra hard to keep my head above water.  I k=\r\nnow I can combat Rodimus but I&#39;m not so sure I can defeat Magmatron.   Prim=\r\nus help us if he challenges me. Not much scares me but, going against an im=\r\npossible foe, does.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Oct=\r\n 7, 2011, at 2:42 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson remains still with a light hearted grin on his muzzle.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Of course my friend, I was just toying with them, nothing seriou=\r\ns. Now, a\n&gt; &gt; lot of my skills in combat revolve around balance, poise, foc=\r\nus and most\n&gt; &gt; important, inner peace. Such was the teachings of Master Yo=\r\nkitron. Which I\n&gt; &gt; really should be continuing. Mach Kick, you can stay on=\r\n my back, just be\n&gt; &gt; sure to hold onto me securely. I&#39;m going to warm up w=\r\nith some basic\n&gt; &gt; exercises in balance. And I think I would like to contin=\r\nue in beast mode. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He slowly gets up on his hind legs, standing in=\r\n a near erect position.\n&gt; &gt; Instead of curling his front legs into his ches=\r\nt, he stretches them out and\n&gt; &gt; begins his exercises. A look of serenity c=\r\nomes over his face as his front\n&gt; &gt; legs work as arms and hands, in a grace=\r\nful dance of poise and tranquility.\n&gt; &gt; Slowly, his hind legs and feet begi=\r\nn to move gracefully in unison with his\n&gt; &gt; upper body. As his tail moves w=\r\nith his body, a gentile breeze is kicked up\n&gt; &gt; in it&#39;s wake. He minds his =\r\nfeet and moves carefully around his new friends.\n&gt; &gt; It was his way of trai=\r\nning for battle. The more he moves the faster his\n&gt; &gt; arms and legs move as=\r\n swift taloned hands perform the same functions as they\n&gt; &gt; were if he were=\r\n in robot mode. And then the dance blossoms into an\n&gt; &gt; impressive display =\r\nof martial arts as the Silver Dragon performs a stellar\n&gt; &gt; spin/ revolving=\r\n kick maneuver. He lands on his feet without a wobble in his\n&gt; &gt; legs or an=\r\nkles. He turns his head to see if Mach Kick was still on his\n&gt; &gt; back.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot; The reason why I chose to warm up this way is because typically, no o=\r\nne\n&gt; &gt; expects a transformer to fight that way in alt form. When I first me=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; Master Yokitron, he asked me to do something completely out of the no=\r\nrmal\n&gt; &gt; routine of combat training. I was an Autobot back then and he aske=\r\nd me to\n&gt; &gt; remain in vehicle form during the first lesson. I thought he wa=\r\ns kidding\n&gt; &gt; but he wasn&#39;t. So then he asked me to drive a little down a r=\r\noad that he\n&gt; &gt; sanctioned for Autobot training. I went down that road and =\r\nsuddenly, I\n&gt; &gt; found myself on two wheels instead of four. I was an SUV at=\r\n the time and I\n&gt; &gt; was shocked clear out of my suspension cables when I we=\r\nnt up on my left\n&gt; &gt; front and rear tires. There was a ramp under me and I =\r\ndid not expect it.\n&gt; &gt; But then he said that even a bulky vehicle can find =\r\nbalance. And if a bulky\n&gt; &gt; vehicle can find balance, so can a dragon. This=\r\n is what I&#39;m going to try\n&gt; &gt; and convey in the battle field.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; There was a nod of comprehension from BIG CONVOY as he watched TUSCON.\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;I have heard of your master Yokitron.&quot; He said as he folded his\n&gt; massiv=\r\ne arms over his chest. &quot;I am told his students are well trained\n&gt; in variou=\r\ns styles of fighting including Circuit-Su and Metallikato.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As BIG tal=\r\nked MACH KICK said, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m still up here ya know!&quot; He\n&gt; said as held on =\r\nfor dear life as TUSCON continued his training.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I think Magmatron has=\r\n some sort of similar training.&quot; BIG CONVOY said\n&gt; with a frown, sseming to=\r\n ignore MACH KICK for the moment. &quot;I have seen\n&gt; him fight once or twice.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n\r\n--Apple-Mail-27-409761366\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=utf-8\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tucson looks to Mach Kick and gently g=\r\nets back to all fours to let him down.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Sorry abo=\r\nut that. &nbsp;I guess I really got into my training exercises . &nbsp;Good=\r\n thing you spoke up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He then turns to face Big Co=\r\nnvoy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Master Yokitron trained me in both forms a=\r\nnd then he took me aside and trained me a bit further than what was normall=\r\ny taught in training academy. &nbsp;Nightshift was trained along side with =\r\nme, and not too many bots were given the opportunity that we were given. &n=\r\nbsp;I feel a bit incomplete, like as if I&#39;m missing a component of myself. =\r\n&nbsp;I always fought with Nightshift beside me and together we would defea=\r\nt our opponents. &nbsp;And if Magmatron is believed to have such training, =\r\nI will have to work extra hard to keep my head above water. &nbsp;I know I =\r\ncan combat Rodimus but I&#39;m not so sure I can defeat Magmatron. &nbsp; Primu=\r\ns help us if he challenges me. Not much scares me but, going against an imp=\r\nossible foe, does.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpetually on the move and constantly bu=\r\nsy.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Oct 7, 2011, at 2:42 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrot=\r\ne:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      =\r\n\n      &lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson remains still with a li=\r\nght hearted grin on his muzzle.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Of course my friend, I =\r\nwas just toying with them, nothing serious.  Now, a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lot of my skil=\r\nls in combat revolve around balance, poise, focus and most&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; importa=\r\nnt, inner peace.  Such was the teachings of Master Yokitron.  Which I&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; really should be continuing.  Mach Kick, you can stay on my back, just =\r\nbe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sure to hold onto me securely.   I&#39;m going to warm up with some=\r\n basic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; exercises in balance.  And I think I would like to continue=\r\n in beast mode. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He slowly gets up on his hind legs, sta=\r\nnding in a near erect position.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Instead of curling his front legs =\r\ninto his chest, he stretches them out and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; begins his exercises.   =\r\nA look of serenity comes over his face as his front&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; legs work as a=\r\nrms and hands, in a graceful dance of poise and tranquility.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Slowl=\r\ny, his hind legs and feet begin to move gracefully in unison with his&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; upper body.  As his tail moves with his body, a gentile breeze is kicke=\r\nd up&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in it&#39;s wake. He minds his feet and moves carefully around hi=\r\ns new friends.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It was his way of training for battle.  The more he=\r\n moves the faster his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; arms and legs move as swift taloned hands pe=\r\nrform the same functions as they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; were if he were in robot mode.  A=\r\nnd then the dance blossoms into an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; impressive display of martial a=\r\nrts as the Silver Dragon performs a stellar&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; spin/ revolving kick m=\r\naneuver.  He lands on his feet without a wobble in his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; legs or ank=\r\nles.  He turns his head to see if Mach Kick was still on his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; back.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; The reason why I chose to warm up this way is because =\r\ntypically, no one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; expects a transformer to fight that way in alt f=\r\norm.  When I first met&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Master Yokitron, he asked me to do somethin=\r\ng completely out of the normal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; routine of combat training.  I was =\r\nan Autobot back then and he asked me to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; remain in vehicle form dur=\r\ning the first lesson.  I thought he was kidding&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; but he wasn&#39;t. So =\r\nthen he asked me to drive a little down a road that he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sanctioned =\r\nfor Autobot training.  I went down that road and suddenly, I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; found=\r\n myself on two wheels instead of four.  I was an SUV at the time and I&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; was shocked clear out of my suspension cables when I went up on my lef=\r\nt&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; front and rear tires.   There was a ramp under me and I did not =\r\nexpect it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But then he said that even a bulky vehicle can find bal=\r\nance.  And if a bulky&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; vehicle can find balance, so can a dragon.  =\r\nThis is what I&#39;m going to try&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and convey in the battle field.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere was a nod of comprehension from BIG CONVOY=\r\n as he watched TUSCON.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I have heard of your master Yokitron.&quot; He said =\r\nas he folded his&lt;br&gt;\nmassive arms over his chest. &quot;I am told his students a=\r\nre well trained&lt;br&gt;\nin various styles of fighting including Circuit-Su and =\r\nMetallikato.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs BIG talked MACH KICK said, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m still up her=\r\ne ya know!&quot; He&lt;br&gt;\nsaid as held on for dear life as TUSCON continued his tr=\r\naining.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I think Magmatron has some sort of similar training.&quot; BIG=\r\n CONVOY said&lt;br&gt;\nwith a frown, sseming to ignore MACH KICK for the moment. =\r\n&quot;I have seen&lt;br&gt;\nhim fight once or twice.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPreston&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blo=\r\nckquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-27-409761366--\r\n\n"}}
