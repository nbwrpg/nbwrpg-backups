If he were healthy he&#39;d\nhave no trouble tracking Slayer. A wound that big would leave a trail that a\nblind man could follow. He called back to the Ark hoping to get a tracker up\nthere.

He knew that they were both near\n&gt; stasis lock, but it was still a pity to let a victim go...\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Agreed,&quot; Slayer says after some consideration. Aside from his\n&gt; damages, there was something in him that didn&#39;t want to finish this\n&gt; fight. He growls. He would have to check his systems later, these\n&gt; acts of mercy were not good, &quot;I shall kill you next time, then.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Turning around, Slayer transforms into a wolf, boosters emerging from\n&gt; his sides and sending him flying back to the Trainer base.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine Howls loudly as the rifle hits him in the stomoch. He\n&gt; curls\n&gt; &gt; up into a fetal position until he hit the ground. Now both bots had\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; critical wound that needed tending as soon as possible. If he took\n&gt; &gt; another solid shot like that he might not make it back for repairs.\n&gt; &gt; (He was to busy fighting Slayer to notice how badly the Ark was\n&gt; &gt; damaged.) But the same went for Slayer, if he didn&#39;t get back to\n&gt; &gt; wherever his base was he&#39;d gointo stasis lock too. The fight was\n&gt; &gt; meaningless right now, if it continued both would cease to\n&gt; function.\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine transformed to full wolf mode to save energy and speed up\n&gt; &gt; repairs. He took a defensive stance in front of Slayer and started\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; stareing contest. &quot;This is turning senseless. If we both stay out\n&gt; &gt; here we&#39;re both dead if we go our seperate ways we might live to\n&gt; pick\n&gt; &gt; this up another day.&quot; He stepped back a few steps ready to move at\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; moments notice. &quot;We&#39;re to evenly matched, I see that now, how about\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; rain check till we meet again?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
