Megatron, but how, he had died over 300\n&gt; years ago. He thought this robot was a myth, something that Autobots used\n&gt; to scare the younger soldiers. A boogy man of sorts. He was striken with\n&gt; fear, and didn&#39;t have a clue what to do. Cliffjumper did though. He\n&gt; clenched his fists in rage, and wanted to blast the frikin screen.\n&gt; Beachcomber sensed the sudden changes of emotion though, and put a\n&gt; compforting hand on Cliffjumper, &quot;Ease up there Jumper, we&#39;ve just been\n&gt; given orders&quot; he finished, as he escorted Cliffjumper away from the\nscreen.\n&gt; &quot;Come on junior&quot; he called, reffering to the panic striken Firedrill. He\n&gt; couldn&#39;t blame him though. The kid had never met anyone as scary,\nGalvatron\n&gt; left Cybertron before he was even programmed. And with his personal\n&gt; experience he felt Megatron was worce. Cold and calculating, powerfull,\nand\n&gt; merciless. Firedrill snapped out of it, and followed, keeping his eyes on\n&gt; the screen, until they left, &quot;Uhhh, sure, sure thing comander&quot; he said,\n&gt; shakily. He would normally have been overjoyed to finally have been\n&gt; excepted, but he couldnt shake the fear.\n&gt;\n&gt; They arrived at the door, which led them out.\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Could someone who is largely cruicial to what is happening outside,\n&gt; explain what my characters see please?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
