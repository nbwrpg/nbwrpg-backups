I think I downed one and Cyclonus was dealing with the other\n&gt; t=\r\nwo.&quot; He paused for a moment as if trying to remember, &quot;I can&#39;t\n&gt; remember w=\r\nhat happened after that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally RODIMUS looked up at UNUS, as if jus=\r\nt his presence, &quot;Who are\n&gt; you?&quot; He focused on ASTRA and then on FIREHORN, =\r\n&quot;You two I think I\n&gt; remember.&quot; He scratched his head. &quot;But not much . . . =\r\nit&#39;s a jumble.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, that was me.&quot; FRIEHORN said gruffly. ASTRA just =\r\nsmiled coyly.\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS smiled, &quot;Rest my friend.&quot; He said, his smile warm a=\r\nnd friendly.\n&gt; &quot;I think we all need to talk.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The nurse was running a =\r\nscanner over RODIMUS, the look on her face was\n&gt; not a happy one. &quot;You are =\r\nnot fully healed yet, you need more time to\n&gt; rest.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nW=\r\nHEELIE nodded, &quot;You&#39;re definitely ont up and ready to go, you can barely mo=\r\nve, don&#39;t you know.  You look like you&#39;ve been smashed through the Pit, tor=\r\nn apart like a git.  To you I would suggest, you can only lay down to be fi=\r\nxed and rest.  Over to the two of them, I would suggest they get you to sta=\r\ny down again.  Before you go out half cocked, I would suggest they make sur=\r\ne you&#39;re stasis locked.&quot;\n\nPausing to look over at UNUS.  &quot;Things are gettin=\r\ng potentially very bad.  With MAGMATRON out and had.  Most would have htoug=\r\nht he was dead.  IF he is here, things will be worse before we can get ahea=\r\nd.  Combined with the presence of CRYOTEK, if the two would meet all would =\r\ngo to Drek.&quot;\n\nNodding quietly, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be here, and I think ther=\r\ne&#39;s nothing you have to fear.  Take your time, here&#39;ll you&#39;ll stay, or I&#39;ll=\r\n rhyme until you go away!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
