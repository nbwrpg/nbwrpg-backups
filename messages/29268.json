He came to kill a young\n&gt;child who\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t even here.  We faught to defend the Maximal base!&quot;  As he\n&gt;spots the\n&gt; &gt; tree he alters to his bird mode and takes to the air.  The tree\n&gt;passes below\n&gt; &gt; his legs and crashes into the base wall above the door.  He lands\n&gt;again and\n&gt; &gt; returns to his winged centaur mode.  He once again loads an arrow\n&gt;but this\n&gt; &gt; time fires it at Burning Hammer.  He can&#39;t hurt Recon because he\n&gt;isn&#39;t the\n&gt; &gt; enemy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
