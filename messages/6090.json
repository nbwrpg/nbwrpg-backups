Dracona came back up.\n\n&quot;Gangon got his new body and left, but my scanners stopped picking him up,\nand when they did pick him up again, his signature was on a different bot,\nand lightmare&#39;s signature was on another bot nearby the one with Gangon&#39;s\nsignature.&quot; Dracona said. Plintissa looked at Dracona and sighed. The\nRadicons stopped moving as well. Stranato knew his group were hungry for\nbattle, but it would be traitorus to cause Iron Raptor&#39;s death like that,\nand what of Tavatron? This was bad, and Stranato didn&#39;t like it one bit...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, July 07, 2000 5:10 PM\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars RPG\n\n\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer/The Oblitercons/Scattershot/Punch/Koga\n&gt; Shuko/Serpentor/Hades/Anubis/Unitron:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nemesis!
