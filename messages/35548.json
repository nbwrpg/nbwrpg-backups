His scanners detect spmething alive inside the ship, but the rest of it was dead, as far as he could tell. He approaches the open hatch, something gnawing at the back of his mind.\n\n&quot;Wheeljack, can you make any scans inside?&quot; he asks over his shoulder, though he doesn&#39;t move his gun away from the entrance.\n\nUnknown to them all (for a while anyways), the material that the ship was made of prevented effective scanning into or out of it, the reason that the ship was down here in the first place.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Wheeljack/Hurricane:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::They go out of the shuttle and follow Zardus.
