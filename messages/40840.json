Unless Alecto had \nnight vision on all she would see is the bursts of light from some of \nthe autoguns. THe sun doesnt reach as far down as the second \ninfecticon base is. A moment later 10 autoguns fired on Alecto, each \nsending 5 shots for a total of 50 her way. At the same time, 5 \nmissile turrets each opened fire on her sending 5 concussion missiles \nat her. Inside Blight laughed evily as he ran his finger tips up to \ntwo areas of the black console infront of him. A moment later, a \nlarge cannon aimed at Alecto and fired a particle beam at her.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Alecto:\n&gt; \n&gt; Alecto was fightting to avoid the shots but several hit her, she \n&gt; fired 25 times against Infectron&#39;s base\n\n\n"}}
