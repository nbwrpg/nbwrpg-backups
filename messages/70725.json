However here are those who postulate that Spark Matriixes are\nattenuated by the actions one takes and the desisions arrived at as\nmuch as by default construction specifications.&quot;\n\nSanton shrugged, &quot;What he really means Tuscon is that you are built\nalong the same lines as him, and your spark is similar, but he&#39;s not\nsure if that is because that is how you&#39;re constructed or because your\nactions have made it that way.&quot;\n\nLegacy glanced at Santon, &quot;I believe I had already said that.&quot; he\nintoned coolly.\n\n&quot;Yeah, well sometimes your words are longer than a class 5 star\ncrusier.&quot; Santon retorted smoothly.\n\nLegacy just turned back to Tuscon, pointedly ignoring Santon.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
