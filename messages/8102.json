A scent he&#39;d learned to loathe. It \nwas the scent of Predacons.\n\nLunarpine didn&#39;t have a conflict with the stranger, other than the \nfact that he&#39;d woke him up from a nice nap. \n&quot;What&#39;s the story with this bot?&quot;he asked as he stepped a little \ncloser to get a better view.&quot; If he&#39;s a Pred then I want a few shots \nat him for waking me up. I was having a nice dream.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Jason Lind&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Falcore/Ripper\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; they both walk infront of Sniper still pointing there guns at Sniper\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Falcore:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;you stabb us and the back and then try to return I have told Prowl \nof you \n&gt; about what happen at the pred base. you are a coward you have no \nhonor we \n&gt; will kill us if you force us but you are coming with us or die.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ripper:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;[to luranpe] we have caught the tradtior Sniper we are about to \nput him in \n&gt; the brig.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; then he trans forms back to beast mode and picks up a small peace \nof energon \n&gt; and shove it into snipers leg.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
