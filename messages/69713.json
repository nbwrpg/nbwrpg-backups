But now,\n&gt; is not the time for that. I see that what I accomplished was\n&gt; just the first phase. I&#39;ve accomplished that thus far. I&#39;ve\n&gt; learned for myself what needs to be done, and what needs\n&gt; to be done can&#39;t be completed today. That will have to wait.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I believe this is where you step asside Rodimus, and let us pass.&quot;\n\nRodimus stood before Tuscon, weapon drawn and ready as the Autobot\nwent through his soliloquy, the look on his face hard and resolute.\nThe Rodimus that stands there, is not exactly the Rodimus Tuscon had\nonce known, the Predacon programing had twisted him, inverted his\nthoughts, changed him in ways that even he found surprising in some\nways.\n\nHowever even now as this lone Autobot spoke about dedication and\ncourage, there was a part of him that was opened for a moment, as if\nfor the briefest of seconds a part of the old Rodimus briefly made an\nappearance . . .\n\n&quot;NO Autobot, this is where you face termination!&quot; Cyclonus spoke as he\nand Scourge caught up, breaking into Rodimus&#39; revelry  &quot;It is time to\nfinish this!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes&quot; Said Skorponok as he stepped out of the room, weapons already\norienting on the Autobot. &quot;He thinks he&#39;s Optimus Prime&quot; Scorponok\nsaid, his voice sarcastic and mocking, &quot;But he is only a pale copy.&quot;\nHe chuckled, &quot;But I do so look forward to his dissection.&quot;\n\nScourge just chuckled darkly as he approached, his rifle pointed at\nTuscon and Rat Trap!\n\n(Meanwhile in the Autobot shuttle)\n\n&gt; Quickstride gets the shuttle airbourne and sets the course\n&gt; for the tower. He tries to lock in on an Autobot signature,\n&gt; and gets Rat Trap&#39;s readilly.\n\nLord elder nodded as he brought the shuttle as close as he dared to\nthe Black Fortress! He knew how powerful this demesne of the Predacons\ncould be. Designed to hold off an assault, Lord Elder knew his plan\nwas risky. He could only hope that Rat Trap had been able to do\nsomething on his side.\n\n&gt; &quot;Sir, I&#39;ve locked in on Rat Trap&#39;s signature.... And yes, I do\n&gt; see a faint but very faint Autobot signature... It&#39;s a bit weaker\n&gt; than normal... Which Oh wow, sir, that Autobot seems to be\n&gt; using a backup battery... Not good... Because when he loses\n&gt; that he&#39;s done for.&quot;\n\n&quot;Confirmed.&quot; he said as he also saw the same things on his scanner.\n&quot;The sensors also show several Decepticon and Predacon signatures\naround them, if we don&#39;t do something Tuscon and Rat trap would be\ndestroyed anyway.&quot; With deft fingers he brought the weapons energy\ncannons online and quickly brought them to bear on the fortress.\n\n&quot;Hold onto your seat, this is going to get rough!&quot; Elder said as he\ntransferred power from the engines to the gunnery platform, in other\nwords throwing everything the shuttle had at the Fortress!\n\nThe shuttle shook for a moment as its fore cannons glowed and then\nspewed out a massive burst of energy that bathed the fortress in pure\ndestructive power!\n\nBack inside the Fortress the very base shook as it absorbed the\nmassive onslaught from the Autobot shuttle! The lights flickered as\nenergy fields went down.\n\nCyclonus, Scourge and Rodimus were knocked off their feet and\nScorponok was sent sailing back into the torture chamber as the world\ninside the Fortress went completely dark for a moment and then winked\nback on dimly as emergency lights came online.\n\nAn alert sounded, it would be only be less than 30 seconds before the\nFortress&#39; computer reset the system and brought itself and all the\nbases&#39; systems back on line!\n\nMeanwhile outside Lord Elder struggle frantically to redirect the\nshuttle&#39;s energy from the weapons and back to the engines, as the\nshuttle at the moment was falling from the skies, looking less like\nthe elegant flying machine it was and more like a brick!\n\n(OOC: I wrote in the affected to the Fortress with Airly&#39;s permission)\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus & Scourge/Scorponok/Rodimus/Lord Elder)\n\n"}}
