He slammed his club tail into anything he \nfelt like trees, rocks, small animals. &quot;Where are Maximals when you need \nthem?&quot; He asked himself.\n    Hours became seconds for him. Eventually his internal clocks said he \nneeded to eat. He climbed down into a valley and ate to his Spark&#39;s content. \nHe found a little cave with water in it and entered. Within he found a stasis \npod opened. He transformed into robot mode and looked at the computer screen.\n    On the screen was DNA from an Anklosaurus. Looking around he saw the \nskull of the dinosaur sticking out from a rock. This was his stasis pod. \nLooking around in shear terror at the remains of his &quot;species&quot;. He ran out \ninto the open again and fell down a cliff. \n\n"}}
