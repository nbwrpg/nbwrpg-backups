The Megatron side of Hydras \nis \n&gt; &gt; nothing more than a Predacon wannabe who named himself after \nsomeone \n&gt; &gt; famous - and Galvatron is Galvatron, ruthless, uncaring, insane \n&gt; &gt; tyrant.  If he even remembers his time as the original Megatron, \nhe \n&gt; &gt; pays it no heed.&quot;  Empath clenches her fists, and Vok energy \ncrackles \n&gt; &gt; around them.  &quot;He is going to pay through the nose for throwing \naway \n&gt; &gt; all those Decepticon lives just to save his own worthless hide.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Maxima watched her. She had no special ability like what Empath \nhad, but she \n&gt; had understanding & reasoning. She was no fool. One who lived this \nlong, \n&gt; since the Golden Age would not be a fool. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tell me more, Empath. I need to know... everything.&quot; Her voice was \ndead \n&gt; serious. In her mind, if a leader did not measure up to th original \n&gt; Megatron... they didn&#39;t deserve to function! \n&gt; \n&gt; But.. Hydras... something about him that she doubt she could ever \nterminate \n&gt; him. \n&gt; \n&gt; She would listen to Empath... first.\n\nOOC: This is a somewhat biased view of events, of course.\n\n&quot;Everything?&quot;  Empath laughs bitterly.  &quot;Where to begin ... when the \noriginal Megatron and many of the Seekers were thrown off Astrotrain \nduring Starscream&#39;s mutiny, they were picked up by Unicron.  The \nplanet destroyer gave Megatron a choice: become Unicron&#39;s slave or \ndie.  The bastard threw away his sanity and the lives of many strong, \nloyal Decepticons to become Galvatron.  Unicron made him some new \ntroops from the ashes of the old, and he took over leadership of the \nDecepticons, keeping most of his power even after Unicron was \ndestroyed.  He kept us all in line by sheer terror.  After the \nreformat, he was exiled for his crimes.  Now reduced to a blacklisted \nPredacon criminal, Galvatron was forced to use mind-altering control \nchips to gain followers.  I was one of these.&quot;\n\nEmpath pauses for a moment, then continues.  &quot;Meanwhile, another \nPredacon took the name of Megatron and sought to steal enough energon \nto conquer Cybertron for himself.  A group of Maximals captured him \nand his crew and brought them back.  Some careless guards allowed him \nto escape with a new crew and he came here.  Galvatron also found his \nway here, with me still enslaved to his blasted Galvapred chip.  \nWhile here, I found an artifact which set me free.  Galvatron ended \nup fusing with Megatron, and the rest you know.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
