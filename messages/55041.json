The center of \nhis world, the femme he loved had been captured. He knew it was \nbecause Flicker saw how close her and he had been. That&#39;s why he \nwanted her. This was Rodimus&#39; fault!\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: It&#39;s not your fault Condor. You tried to save her. \nThat&#39;s all I could ask of you. If it&#39;s anyones it&#39;s my fault.\n&gt; Rodimus swung Condor over his shoulder then went to get Kup. Kup \nwas just now recovering from the gasses effects.\n&gt; Kup: Roddy, I&#39;ll get him to a CR. I believe that Elita is in good \nhands. You just go after Flicker. I&#39;ll join you soon.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Ok, Kup, here.\n&gt; Rodimus hands Condor over to Kup.\n&gt; Kup rushes to the CR room, placing Condor in one.\n&gt; Kup: You&#39;ll be ok, lad...\n&gt; Meanwhile Rodimus had already left the base in car mode, pushing \nhis motor over it&#39;s limit.\n&gt; &quot;I have to get to her,&quot; he thought.\n&gt; Rodimus opened a comm back to base.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: This is Rodimus Prime.
