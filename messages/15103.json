This was crazy! KitKat \nand him needed serious attention. They had no base. They had no \nsupplies, and now the other Preds were trying to get them to join \nthem. The old assimillation technique. We&#39;d probably be made low \nranking officers. And where was their all might leader Megatron at \nthis time? Off chasing some unknown aliens whil his crew was getting \nblown to bits! Starscream looked from KitKat, to Tarantulas, and than \nto Drillbit.\n\n&quot;Look at her! She&#39;s in no position to be making command decisions! \nLook at the pain she&#39;s in!&quot; Starscream looked at her caringly, &quot;I \nthink the damage might be much worse than I thought. She might have \nbroken a big vital system inside her body. If we don&#39;t get help soon \nshe might die. One of us has to relieve her of command.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
