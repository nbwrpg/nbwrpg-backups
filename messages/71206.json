Tucson had come out of stasis a little too soon.  She watches h=\r\nim carefully.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re definitely right Rodimus, Tucson did come out of st=\r\nasis too soon, but try telling that ta the big guy. And yes, Rodimus is rig=\r\nht Tucson, you are incredibly,and perpetually STUBBORN.&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles.\n=\r\n\n&quot;I know I know, I do admit I am stubborn.  And perhaps even a little too m=\r\nuch for my own good.  Rodimus, you&#39;re right, I could use more time, but I a=\r\nlso realize you need help, and for that I can not abandon your cause.  I wi=\r\nll do my best to realize my limits but at the same time assist you as well =\r\nas I can. &quot;\n\nHe now walks toward a computer console, with a resolute expres=\r\nsion.\n\n&quot; From what I&#39;ve been receiving, since I left my com link operative =\r\nduring stasis, and was able to hear fragments of it, during that time, we s=\r\neem to have an insecticon pressense in a far quadrant of the area&#39;s paramet=\r\ners. I am also aware that Night Shift is now on the search with Rat Trap, t=\r\no find Cheetor.  His intentions were in the right place, but like me, he te=\r\nnds to bite off more than he can chew. And I think we&#39;ve all been doing tha=\r\nt a little bit lately.  Our forces are not as numberous as the opposing sid=\r\ne, and perhaps it would help if our forces were expanded somehow.  The Auto=\r\nbots in the Ark are not due to awaken too soon, but it would benefit us if =\r\nthey would.  The Maximals can not protect this planet by themselves, and it=\r\n&#39;s time I made sure they get the help they need.  There must be a way we ca=\r\nn awaken the Ark..&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to them.\n\n&quot;Well?  Why don&#39;t you gu=\r\nys consult the Matrix?  I bet it would know, and give you guys the guidence=\r\n you need ta answer your questions. After all, you&#39;re both Primes, right?&quot; =\r\n \n\nTucson raises a brow.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s right.  Perhaps it&#39;s time we did consult t=\r\nhe Matrix, Together.&quot;\n\n \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightsta=\r\nr &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight:\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightlight&#39;s hand weakly clos=\r\ned holding Rodimu&#39;s, It was acounsious act? \n&gt; \n&gt; She slowly started to mov=\r\ne, then she opened her eyes and smiled when she looked a familiar face...

Aw maan, fine time to be without =\r\nTucson..\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus nodded absently as he looked down at his w=\r\nife as Elita is removed from the room. He is lost in thought, remembering t=\r\nhe good times he had had with her. The day that their daughter was created,=\r\n He could remember the fear he had when he realized what was going on with =\r\nNightlight, and how he so much wanted to wake Nightlight up from all this t=\r\nragedy and just make everything alright for her. \n&gt; \n&gt; He turned back to lo=\r\nok at Perceptor, reminded oddly enough of the old Percepetor he knew from e=\r\nons ago =96 or would that be eons from now. All this time travel stuff real=\r\nly made his head spin. But he still had a quiet confidence in the ex Predac=\r\non as he watched him prepare things. \n&gt; \n&gt; He got a call from Nightshift, a=\r\nnd he paused for a moment in thought. Then he sent a message to Ramulus, &quot;H=\r\nurry and get out there as soon as you can. I am not sure what&#39;s going on, b=\r\nut it&#39;s definitely dangerous.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Gotcha boss.&quot; came Ramulus&#39; reply. &quot;I&#39;=\r\nm on the way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He was about to look back at Nightlight when someone ca=\r\nme into the room  . . . \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He gently rubs her head, and =\r\nenters the room where Rodimus is.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I know what you&#39;ll tell me, and=\r\n you&#39;re right, I shouldn&#39;t be out of stasis just yet, but, I couldn&#39;t help =\r\nthinking about what would happen if I wasn&#39;t there to lend you support. Oh,=\r\n and I thought you might want to say hello to Elita.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He smiles as =\r\nhe holds her close to Rodimus, waiting for him to hold her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elita w=\r\noke up and looking at her dad said &quot;Daddy, when will my mom wake\n&gt; &gt; up??&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus picked up Elita and smiled at her, &quot;It is good to s=\r\nee you little one.&quot; He said as he held her in his arms. I am hoping to wake=\r\n mommy up as soon as I can.&quot; His voice was the higher pitched happy tones t=\r\nhat adults use when trying to keep the younger children happy. \n&gt; \n&gt; He loo=\r\nked over at Tuscon, &quot;It is good to see you Tuscon.&quot; While his words were gr=\r\nave, his voice was still pitched high so as not to alarm Elita. &quot;But don&#39;t =\r\nyou need a few hours more in the chamber before you are ready to come out?&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor dryly said th Straight shot &quot;For the safely=\r\n of this Girl, she have\n&gt; &gt; to leave the room...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus l=\r\nooked at Tuscon, knowing he would not have enough time to pursue this. He l=\r\nooked at Straight Shot, &quot;Make sure he does not over do it. His injuries are=\r\n probably not completely healed and he may over estimate what he can do.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Rodimus pointedly handed Elita to Straight Shot so that Tuscon would no=\r\nt over do it trying to carry her, he did still have some healing to do, eve=\r\nn if he was too stubborn to do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The machine started=\r\n to remove the Nightlight&#39;s coma status and decrease her\n&gt; &gt; energy level t=\r\no the minimal.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus turned back to Nightlight as the mac=\r\nhine started to work, He grasped her right hand in his and stared at her op=\r\ntics, smiling, hoping that his princess might awaken and remember who he wa=\r\ns. \n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
