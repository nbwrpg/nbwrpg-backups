She drew her rifle \nand aimed it at Hell Beast. &quot;I&#39;d say that your reputation proceeds \nyou. I heard that you were dead.  how in the pit did you get back \nhere? And what&#39;s this abbout investigating Megatron?&quot;\nShe had just killed Megatron just a little while ago. How could this \nbot know she had killed him so quickly. This was either a trap, \nBloodystrike or Gotron notified him, he was spying and saw the \nbattle, or he had this whole thing planned from the start.  Her \ninstincts told her that this whole situation wasn&#39;t right.\n&quot;Look Hell Beast, You want to look at Megatron&#39;s body, that&#39;s fine \nwith me, but only after I have first crack at it.  I want his spark \nand ananlise his body, then you can have the whole thing to put up on \nthe wall as a trophy.&quot; She still had her rifle aimed at HellBeast.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron had enough of this, there was no way he could get to \nthe pod in \n&gt; time, and his enemies were beginning to suspect something. He \nturned to \n&gt; Waspinator, &quot;You, go to Kitkats position and beg for he to spare a \nbody part \n&gt; of mine to you, as a momento. Tell her that I am truly dead, but \nunder any \n&gt; circumstances do not tell them that we are residing in the ice \ncavern.&quot;\n&gt; He said.\n&gt;     Waspinator nodded. &quot;Yes Megatron. But what if they hurt me?&quot; He \nsaid a \n&gt; little uneasy.\n&gt;     &quot;Thats your problem. Just throw them off my trail!&quot; He roared \nand sent \n&gt; the little bot buzzing away frantically into the air.\n&gt;     Adrax began to clap and got the tyrants attention. &quot;What a \nperfect prison \n&gt; you have selected. If you leave, you&#39;ll die. And now your confined \ninsdie. \n&gt; You are pathetic Megatron.&quot;\n&gt;     Without a word, Megatron dropped his cage into the pit, but \nstopped it. \n&gt; It dangled in blackness. Megatron then sealed the top of it. He \ncould stay \n&gt; down there awhile.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hell Beast and Gremlin emerged from the woods. Word had it that \nMegatron \n&gt; was dead, and if he was then he could go home. Gremlin pointed as \nthey \n&gt; entered the clearing to the old cave, &quot;There they are. Kitkat is in \ncharge.&quot;\n&gt;     The old Commander looked at the leader. She was small, another \nfemale. \n&gt; Females seemed to be weak leaders, but mabey this one was \ndifferent. \n&gt; &quot;Commander Kitkat, I am Senator Hell Beast. I belive my reputation \nproceeds \n&gt; me, but in any case I have come to investigate the death of the \ncriminal \n&gt; Megatron. I mean no trouble and will help you if nessecery.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Black Aracnia looked to Quickstrike, &quot;So what do you think \nabout the \n&gt; baby....I mean...are you alright with it? Scared?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
