The enemy was vanquished for now, \nbut at the expense of a great warrior. He picked Child&#39;s body up and \nturned to Windrazor.\n\n&quot;An enemy greater than anything we have imagined has come. We \ndefeated him barely, and we needed the death of Eagle Eye to do it. \nI&#39;m sorry Windrazor. He gave himself up freely for the mission. But \nthe enemy is not dead, and we must be ready. Child is our only hope. \nI mus train him, make him learn how to control his power. If he \ndoesn&#39;t learn, than Eagle Eye&#39;s death was in vain. Come, pick up his \nbody. We will give him a great buriel in these halls!&quot;\n\nVulois walked back up into the base.\n\n\n"}}
