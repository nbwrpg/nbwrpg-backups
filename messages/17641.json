He restrained Spears as \n&gt; she &quot;tried&quot; to break free. He was upset at this.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I repeat Wolf bot, who are you? Ramulus was supposed to come \nalone, \n&gt; as I have. Why are you betraying the trust I gave you, Ramulus. I \n&gt; have a good mind to go back to my base and really re-program \nSpears!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwile, Ignatius and Blaze were having no luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I can&#39;t see anything. If Ramulus did bring back-up, they must be \nin \n&gt; cloak like us.&quot; said Ignatius in a secret frequency to all but \n&gt; Prebon, Spears and Slayer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;And I can&#39;t get closer to smell without risking all of us. That \n&gt; wolf&#39;s probably got a great nose, and would know that I&#39;m there in \nan \n&gt; instant.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s go back. There is nothing we can do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignatius and Blaze go back to the group.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream/Gotron\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream spoke to KitKat.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I was thinking it was too easy as well, but look at the body. The \n&gt; Inferno drones were all a different color than Inferno. But this \n&gt; thing looked exactly like Megatron. But, like you said, I&#39;ve known \n&gt; Megatron the most, and I think he wouldn&#39;t be that dumb to place \n&gt; himself in such a predicament. Maybe he downloaded all his files \ninto \n&gt; a back-up chip, and than re-installed himself into a new and \nimproved \n&gt; body. He sent this fragile shell thing after us, and we killed it, \nto \n&gt; make him think we were dead. But we&#39;ll see as Phobia examins the \n&gt; body. As for a base, we could stay in your friend destructors for \nnow \n&gt; until we find something suitable. I&#39;ll go check the caves.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream walked over to the Lavacons.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You fought well today! As the officer Zardus put in charge over \nyou \n&gt; for the time being, I give you the gratitude of the entire group. \n&gt; Now, you have a choice. You may remain here with me, in the war, or \n&gt; go back to the Alliance. There really is no fighting in the \nAlliance \n&gt; right now, only politics. Think over your decision and tell me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream was about to enter the caves when Gotron showed up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Your ambassador has arrived!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Great! I think you better go check in with KitKat, and she&#39;ll give \n&gt; you all the info. I know it all, but I don&#39;t know if we want to \ntell \n&gt; Zardus everything yet.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All right. See you later!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream goes and scans the caves, while Gotron goes to talke \nwith \n&gt; KitKat.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hello, I&#39;m Gotron, Starscream&#39;s friend. I&#39;m the ambassador for the \n&gt; Alliance. I was wondering what information I&#39;m allowed to forward \nto \n&gt; Zardus.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
