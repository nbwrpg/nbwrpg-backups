Our goal now is to take control \nof Hell Beast&#39;s ship and reprogram the others if possible. Rampage is \ncurrently in command. But that will not last long, no.&quot; He turned his head. \n&quot;I want Dark Mouse and Quickstrike to sneak inside through the hatch and see \nif you two can disable the computer and bring back the files from the \nDarkside that Quickstrike put there earlier. I shall enter after you disable \nthe shields. I doubt Rampage will allow us open armed.&quot;\n\n\n&gt;From: JP3884@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Wed, 2 Aug 2000 12:49:57 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;OOC: I hate to do this....but I really dont want to see my old base\n&gt;destroyed.

He scanned them, he knew one of them as \n&gt;Megatron.\n&gt;     Still in beast mode, he opened his mouth and his gapling gun extended.\n&gt;Adrax then let it rain bullets from the sky towrds Megatron and his \n&gt;commrads.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
