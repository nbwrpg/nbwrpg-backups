Belive it or not, I can apreciate\n&gt; &gt; a real Loyal Decepticon... I never treason a decepticon who&#39;s fully\n&gt; &gt; loyal to me... &quot;and said with a diferent tone &quot;We can destroy\n&gt; &gt; together Maximal with their patetic ancestors, but we need to know\n&gt; &gt; where the Ark is... and know what Maximals knows about the ark &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Not looking down at her paw in his. But she seemed to narrow her optics \n&gt;just\n&gt;slightly as she seemed to stiffen.\n&gt;\n&gt;But at the mention of destroying the Autobots as well as the Maximals \n&gt;brought\n&gt;her enormus joy. No .. not joy... but pleasure. Satisfaction. She would \n&gt;enjoy\n&gt;seeing them, watching them, as they slowly were terminated. Ahhh.. how she\n&gt;missed terminating them, watching them suffer. Her optics seemed to sparkle\n&gt;at the thought of termination of her loathed enemies. If she were in her \n&gt;old\n&gt;form, her crimson optics would have glowed.\n&gt;\n&gt;She smirked. Then a wicked laugh came from her. &quot;The location of the Ark is\n&gt;what you seek?&quot; Oh, how she loved it when she held power in her grasp.\n&gt;Though.. she never wished to abuse it like what Starscream did on \n&gt;occassion.\n&gt;\n&gt;Still smirking. &quot;& Loyalty is what you have, mighty Hydras. I remain ever\n&gt;loyal to Megatron & you are, in a manner of speaking, Megatron. I will \n&gt;never\n&gt;betray my oath.. I will never betray my leader.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;As to rewards...&quot; she stopped. There was something she never thought \n&gt;about.\n&gt;The only desire she had for this long was to see the Autobots termainted,\n&gt;suffer. To see her comrades victorious. To see her Leader conquer. &.. to \n&gt;be\n&gt;the best Decepticon that Megatron ever had.\n&gt;\n&gt;Megatron....\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN.
