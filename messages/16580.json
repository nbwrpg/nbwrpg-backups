Or Megatron for \nthat \n&gt; matter? You underestimate both.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A growl escapes his lips as he watches Spears lean her head against \n&gt; Prebon&#39;s shoulder, his emotion circuits reactivating. Suddenly, \nboth \n&gt; his shoulder blasters take aim at Prebon, one firing at the bot&#39;s\n&gt; head \n&gt; and the other at his chest. Striker was in a fury, rational thought \n&gt; mostly gone from his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Sorry Yanshosh. I thought he said it out loud. I&#39;ll just say\n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; this post that it was a guess, so that if it was right Striker \n&gt; &gt; would&#39;ve felt without that option. And the door to Striker&#39;s cell\n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; open right now. Ignatius opened it. And Code, their in a mountain \n&gt; &gt; with may tunnels and their at the top. You can&#39;t just talk, cause \n&gt; &gt; they won&#39;t here you. Scan the mountain for technology and when \nyou \n&gt; &gt; find stuff just send a comm message. No word on Bob Skir yet. \n&gt; &gt; Probably forgot about us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Trainers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Prebon gazed at Spears\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to give you the order, but it&#39;s all up to \n&gt; &gt; Striker here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Prebon looked at him. He was hoping Striker would do something \nwhen \n&gt; &gt; he said he knew about his self destruct program, so Prebon would \n&gt; know \n&gt; &gt; if he really has one on, but he didn&#39;t flinch. He could probably\n&gt; put \n&gt; &gt; Striker out now, but he wouldn&#39;t know if he would explode or not.\n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; had to go with what he had.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Striker, you don&#39;t understand, do you? The Maximals are only my \n&gt; &gt; first plan. If that fails, I&#39;m sure their are other groups that \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; fall for it. The minute you leave this ship though, Savage would \nbe \n&gt; &gt; waiting. And he wouldn&#39;t be happy. He hates you with all his \nsoul, \n&gt; &gt; and he&#39;s nearly killed you before. He&#39;ll put you in stasis lock,\n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; than you explode. He&#39;ll probably get really hurt, but he&#39;s tough\n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; will survive after rehibilitation. It&#39;s not worth it Striker. You \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; go free. And I also made a promise to Spears that if she serves \nme \n&gt; &gt; well in the recent future, I may release her. This is the only \n&gt; chance \n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll get! I&#39;m not an evil sorcerer. I&#39;m only looking out for my \n&gt; &gt; groups best interests. This is your only chane of survival and\n&gt; love. \n&gt; &gt; Take it!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vulois\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vulois looked at Child.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes I know. We have to work, or all is lost.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turned back to Windrazor, Terradive and Afterburner.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ll show you.

I&#39;ll \nmeet \n&gt; &gt; you back here when we&#39;re ready for battle.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Got it!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Starscream sent a message to Phobia.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. Zardus has agreed to loan us the entire \n&gt; &gt; Oblitercon force for our battle. They form a giant bot, remember? \n&gt; But \n&gt; &gt; in return for this I have to go fight in one of their battles. I \n&gt; will \n&gt; &gt; contact you when I come back to the Alliance base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Starscream left for the battle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gotron sent his own message.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wheeljack, this is Gotron.
