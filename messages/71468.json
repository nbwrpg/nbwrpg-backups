Take the minimal bots to keep repairs going !!!  The est of\n&gt; them must follow me!!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras headed towards the exit\n\n&quot;Ofcourse.&quot; CYCLONUS said as he nodded respectfully to HYDRAS.\nFlipping on his radio CYCLONUS orders the troops to be meet them\noutside.\n\nSCOURGE answered quickly enough, followed by DEEPSTRKE. Both of them\nwould be outside. PHOBIA would of couse be with DEEPSTRYKE.\n\nThere was no answer from NIGHTRAZOR, except for a short click from his\nradio, CYCLONUS and DEEPSTRYKE well knew he would be there.\n\nINFERNO was already moving to HYDRAS&#39; said as the call was going out,\nand WASPINATOR as well.\n\nINSECTICON and IGUANUS were also running towards the doior to preapre\nfor the coming event.\n\nSKYSHADOW was leading his team outside, behind him was INJECTOR,\nBUZZCLAW, TERRORGATOR and QUICKSTRIKE, the Predaon fuzors, all ready\nfor action.\n\nThere were at the last three left, TARANTULUS, FRACTYL and BRUTICUS-X\nwho were to be left behind to watch over the base.\n\nBRUTICUS was standing there with his massive axe in his hand.\n&quot;Everything shall be as you leave it.&quot; he said to HYDRAS and CYCLONUS.\n\n&quot;And we shall continue to work on repairs.&quot; FRACTLY said. &quot;Yeah . . .\nwhat he said.&quot; TARANTULUS said noncommittedly.\n\nMeanwhile the base sensors were still picking up on the massive heard\nof Dinosaurs that seems to be stampedeing across an area as wide as a\nstate, and they showed no signs of stopping! They would be on HYDRAS&#39;\nnew base within an 3 hours if they did not stop!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
