He couldnt remember what had happened in the last 24 hours. Of \ncourse, thats nothing he would reveal to his crew who might think the old \nPredacon was getting too old. :::\n\n::: Gremlin ::: Commander, are you sure?\n\n::: Hell Beast snapped ::: Sure of what?\n\n::: Gremlin ::: Of attacking the Cybertronian fire.\n\n::: Hell Beast :::: When did I issue that order?\n\n::: Gremlin ::: Yesterday, sir. Sir, are you feeling alright?\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Im feeling fine. Where is Demona....and Black Aracnia?!\n\n::: Pheniox, from her computer station, ::: Demona isnt feeling well and \nBlack Aracnia is administering her.\n\n::: Hell Beast taps a comm unit, ::: Fembots, get to the bridge now.\n\n::: A few moments past and they arrived, Demona making herself look rather \nill. :::\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: You rang?\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: i dont know what you two are planning, but I will find out \nand send you both to the scrap heap!\n\n::: They stared at him in silence before he sent them away. :::\n\n::: After they left, Gremlin once agian turned to his Commander, ::: Are we \nto attack? The Newcomers attacked and I think we could finish it off.\n\n:::: Hell Beast let the thought run around in his head a moment and \nreplied, ::: Very well. Send out a message to our Predacons to gather \ntogether and arm themselfs. And I will contact Megatron...and Magmatron and \nsee if they will help us. Gaining the Cybertronina Fire would be a great \nvictory.\n\n::: He once agian taps his comm unit, and sends the message to Magmatron and \nMegatron to help in the battle agianst the Maximal \nbase. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Demona laughs as she thinks how she manipulated Hell Beast. Her \ntelepathic abilities were getting stronger, and now that she was pregnant \nwith the heir to the Predacon throne....things were going to get interesting. \nAll she needed now was a stasis pod to transfer the phetus data into the \nprotoform. Then, after a two week gestation period her baby boy would be \nformed. \n    Black Aracnia had made her as comfortable as possible in her state. And \nwould go out later and scout a pod. :::\n\n"}}
