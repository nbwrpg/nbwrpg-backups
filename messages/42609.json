The four new members were now techno-organic, and the two \ncommanders had gone in what seemed to be a semi-stasis lock.\n\nGesper:\nMelchana, help me get them linked to the energon fruits. This will \nstabilize them.\n\nMelchana:\nRight... I guess we have no time to waste...\n\nWorries were not a usual experience for her, but, at the moment, she \nseemed to feel lots of them.\n\nThrust:\nLet us help! After all, they&#39;re our commanders too!\n\nJetstorm:\nYeah! We are Tripredacus, and I&#39;ll be a slagged piece of scrap if I \nleave my superior dying!\n\nHe tried to transform, but nothing happened. At the same time, Daemos \nand Belthassan finally got linked to the life support system.\n\nJetstorm:\nSLAG IT!!! WHY CAN&#39;T I TRANSFORM?\n\nMelchana got tired of his shouts, and she decided to tell him. She \nwalked up to him, a low roar escaping from her throat. She grasped the \nhawk&#39;s head.\n\nMelchana:\nThe reason you can&#39;t transform, bird, is that you do not know how. \nFrom their origins, Transformers had to learn to transform. That is \nwhat I&#39;ll be in charge of teaching you. Got it? \nYou must have seen the power that lies in the Matrix. You must focus \non it and rid your spark of idle thoughts. For now, though, come with \nme and Gesper. we will transport Daemos and my brother to the renewal \nchamber. They will be able to recuperate faster there.\n\nStrika:\nIs this renewal chamber a CR chamber?\n\nGesper came behind his sister:\nIn some ways yes, but it is more than that. It allows us, \ntechno-organic beings, to regain the strenght we have lost either in \nbattle or during rituals, like the reformatting. But it also allows us \nto rid ourselves of viruses that may affect us, wether they are \ndormant or active. But enough with explanations. Let&#39;s get to work.\n\nMelchana transformed to lioness mode. She and Tankor carried the \ncommanders on their back while Strika and Thrust hovered near them, \nholding the enrgon fruits in the air. Gesper and Jetstorm led the way, \nopening the doors and installing them in the Renewal chamber.\n\n\n"}}
