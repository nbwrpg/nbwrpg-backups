I have to curb my temper, I&#39;m aware of=\r\n that. Unless I know the story from Rodimus&#39;s point of view I will not judg=\r\ne him as you have taught me. Innocent until proven guilty. Well, that&#39;s abo=\r\nut it Optimus, I haven&#39;t much more to tell you or to ask of you. May you re=\r\nst peacefully in the arms of Primus himself.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gets back up onto his =\r\nfeet, and salutes Optimus Prime.\n\nThe large body body of Optimus Prime cont=\r\ninued to lay there as cold\nand lifeless as it has always been. The Maximals=\r\n and Autobots are tiny\ncompared to their massive forms. Nothing moves in th=\r\nis chamber except\nthe Maximals and Autobots, and sound itself seems dull an=\r\nd colorless.\nIt is a mausoleum to victory and death, and the futility of bo=\r\nth.\n\n&quot;Freedom creates the opportunity for choice, yet not all choices can\nb=\r\ne easily discerned.&quot; came a whisper, one that only Tuscon could hear.\n =93O=\r\nur choices are often made according to our sense of our own worth.\nYoung Tu=\r\nscon, what are you worth?
