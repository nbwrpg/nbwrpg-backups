Sphink injected drill bit in the arm \nwith some healing fluid. &quot;This will counter the venom that entered your \nsystem. Now let apocalypse finish him off. Quick strike is no match for him \nin his present state. They watched as apocalypse&#39;s blade came down and waited \nto see what happened.\n\n"}}
