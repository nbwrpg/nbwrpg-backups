They let out their evil laughter, out loud, and in the blink of an\neye, engaged in battle, ready to kill.\n\n          &quot;HHHAAAA!!!!!  Let&#39;s rumble baby!!!!!!&quot; Recklessa shouted, and\nstarted firing her gatling guns like mad at one of the Inferno clones.\n\n          Fenox blew dark fire out of his mouth at the ground, gave out a\nbattlecry, and then fired his dark heat optic lazers at one of the clones.\n\n          Griplash drew his dark flame sword.  He slashed at the air a\ncouple times, and then went charging for one of the clone&#39;s stomach.\n\n            Starlight instantly pulled out her dark flame crossbow, and\nfired once at distant ground, dark flames spreading.  Then, she started\nfiring repeatedly at another clone of Inferno.\n\n            Astral laughed at the Inferno clones, and started shooting dark\nflame everywhere from his machine gun.  He went behind one of the clones,\nand fired his machine gun.\n\n            &quot;The original&#39;s all yours!!!!!&quot; Astral said to Starscream while\nfiring his machine gun at the clone.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Wheeljack::\n\n        Wheeljack grinned as they got the probe on the large board.\n\n        &quot;Good work, now, let&#39;s get this back to Zardus!&quot; He said.\n\n       Wheeljack walked up to a part of the board and pressed a few buttons.\nA shield went around the board and the probe, and then, flew off towards the\nAlliance base.\n\n           &quot;Does the job automatically.  Now, we better head back as well,&quot;\nHe said, stomping off in T-Rex mode.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Dollen::\n\n        Dollen grinned.  This was REALLY getting fun and intense at the same\ntime.\n\n        &quot;Yes, commander!!&quot; He said, running even faster.\n\n\n"}}
