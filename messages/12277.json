She sighed and went back inside the ship.  \nShe wanted to still enjoy life and enjoy those in her life.  But \nenjoyment was becomming shorter and great time between the good \ntimes.  She walked slowly down the hall with ehr wings wrapped around \nher body, looking down.  She missed having bots to talk to and enjoy \ntime with.  But she was finally coming to the realization, that as \nlong as the war went on, life and all that was good in it, was out of \nher reach. She had one objective now, function and get her mission \nacomplished.  She walked back to her quarters.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Terry Barlow &lt;twb176@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::WindRider::\n&gt; He looked down at Battera and smiled. &quot;OK suit\n&gt; yourself&quot;, he said to her. &quot;But if you change your\n&gt; mind, just come and find me.&quot; With that, he began to\n&gt; climb as high as his wings and the current would take him.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
