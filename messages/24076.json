Prowl \nturns his head to look at Iron Raptor as he tightens his grip around \nher and powers up his boosters.\n\nThe Maximal leans forward to kiss his love while his boosters lift \nthem off the ground. -Do you want to fly there fast, love? I can \nprobably make it in a very short time.-\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Snow Tech grinned and saluted her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yes ma&#39;am, sir, ma&#39;am!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * He then turned to Shadow Cat and began to march off into the \nbush, intent \n&gt; on getting to the base. Shadow cat rolled her eyes and sighed*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; He always manages to make some stupid remark out of anything and \n&gt; everything!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She runs ahead of him barring his way*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You stupid ass! it would take too long to walk! Get your ass back \nthere so \n&gt; i can air lift your fat ass to our new home!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * He saluted her and spun on his heel, facing the way he came and \nmarched \n&gt; back to his original position, facing Iron Raptor. He looked at her \nwith \n&gt; twinkeling eyes and spread his arms so Shadow Cat could lift him. \nShadow Cat \n&gt; graspe dunder his arms and spread her wings, lifting her and Snow \nTech off \n&gt; the ground about nine feet. She spoke to Iron Raptor before she \ntook off \n&gt; totally.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We will meet you there, i&#39;m sure that we can come up with some \nthing to at \n&gt; least tip the odds to our side.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that spooken, she lifted herself and the white bot off \ninto the \n&gt; sky, but not before Snow Techs smart assed remark came down to the \nother \n&gt; twos ears.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; This is little kitties airlines, we are ready for take off, over. \nYes, you \n&gt; are cleared for take off little kitty. Thank-you mission control, \nrodger \n&gt; that. Vrooom!!! Last one there is a over-sized scrap heap!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * His giggling annoyed Shadow Cat and she was tempted to threaten \nhim with \n&gt; bodily harm , but knew that would give him the satisfaction of \ngetting her \n&gt; goat, so she kept her mouth shut and steered off to the left \nsharply so he \n&gt; squealed like a little girl. She smiled and headed to the base at \nfull \n&gt; speed.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
