It was about 25% complete.  She smiled and looked at \nStarscream. &quot;do you know wnything about a temperal rift eminating \nfrom this planet? that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to duplicat that spider \nbaby.  It gave me a message from Phobia.  It said that there was a \ntemperal rift that wold destroy the galaxy or possably the universe.  \nAnd it&#39;s coming from this planet. I was hoping to clone that spider \nbaby and try to get more info from it.&quot; she sighed and sat down in \nteh chair next to her console. &quot;I just don&#39;t know enough about it to \nknow what to do.  I can&#39;t let anything happen to my pack. Not now, \nnot after all that has happened. I have to protect my pack \nStarscream.&quot;  She looked at him and then to her console.  The clone \nwas coming along nicely and would resemble Megatron exactly when it \nwas completed.\n\n\n"}}
