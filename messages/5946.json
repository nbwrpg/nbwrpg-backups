He&#39;d lost the predicons scent a while \nback. The cold didn&#39;t bother him, being from the arctic north \nhelped. &quot;A storm like this isn&#39;t normal anywhere.&quot; he thought, the \nhot jungle below, would be destroyed by such a climate change.\n(Another temporal distortion perhaps.) Again he opened his comm only \nto get static. His senses weren&#39;t reliable around here so he \ntransformed to bot and continued his search for Shadow Wing. For some \nreason he couldn&#39;t shake the fealing he was being watched.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She kept walking.  Her sensors told her a bot was nearing her \n&gt; quardnants.  With the electricity of the storm, it messed with her \n&gt; scanners,  She couldn&#39;t tell if it was the Pred or not.  she \nfigured \n&gt; it was the Pred.  She looked around for something to hide behind.  \n&gt; But it was all flat land and ice. The snow was coming down harder \n&gt; now.  She layed down on the ground.  Soon, the snow would cover her \n&gt; up and hide her.  She figured that if the electricity was messingup \n&gt; her scanners, it would mess with the other bot&#39;s as well.  She \n&gt; readied her small gun and waited.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The wolf continued to follow her trail, he got a partial \n&gt; message,&quot;Hey \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine, I&#39;ll&quot; The message was cut off.
