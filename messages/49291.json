At \n&gt; most, SS could get on him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor&#39;s shots missed both Burrock and Tyrael,\n&gt; but blew a few \n&gt; nearby trees to splints. The stinger fired by\n&gt; Waspinator, however, was \n&gt; straight on target. Burrock was thrown back a dozen\n&gt; meters, making him \n&gt; lose his grip over Inferno. He splashed in the\n&gt; water, but before \n&gt; anyone could track him up, he burrowed in the muddy\n&gt; pond&#39;s bottom.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warhead tried to aim at Shadow Star. He fired many\n&gt; small explosives, \n&gt; doing not much damage individually, but devastating\n&gt; in group.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warhead: Cowardly foe! Do you think that you could\n&gt; be superior to \n&gt; Milord Megatron? Diplomacy will not prevent your\n&gt; death at my gun!\n&gt; \n&gt; At the mention of ruling the universe made by his\n&gt; lieutenant, Tyrael \n&gt; frowned. He was going to have a long strategic chat,\n&gt; but that would \n&gt; wait. Megatron was out now, and the true fight would\n&gt; start.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: I see you have come Megatron. Now come. You\n&gt; will learn why \n&gt; they call me the Blue Firestorm!\n&gt; \n&gt; He showered his enemy with a rain of light bolts, no\n&gt; bigger than \n&gt; needles.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
