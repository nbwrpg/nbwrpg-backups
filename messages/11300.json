Crew Leader, \nOK, But not just leader.&quot; She took the plans and looked them over.\nShe looked up at Phobia.  &quot;Thank you, if this plan is successful, we \nwill take you back with us to Cybertron if you wish.  I&#39;m not looking \nfor a council seat, just looking out for my team.&quot;  She looked at \nDrillbit,&quot;Tell Time Bomb, Land Mine and the others to join me in my \nquarters.  Terrorsaur too.  But not Megatron.  I want this to be a \nsuprize for him.  When we have devised a perfect plan, then megatron \nwill learn of this, but not before.&quot; \n\nShe smiled and nodded to Phobia. &quot;Yes, I shall be by your ship in a \nday or two.  I will need some of those weapons of yours to make this \nwork.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Phobia winced at the kindness KitKat was showing, she was showing \nyo \n&gt; much gratitude where a leader should merely show adaquacy (I think \n&gt; thats the right term)\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Of course leader, here you are.&quot; he extended his hand and offered \n&gt; the holocube to KitKat. &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me I have some \nbusiness \n&gt; to attend to on my ship. If you&#39;d like to stop out later, I&#39;ll be \n&gt; glad to supply a manifest of my cargo.&quot; Phobia steps back carefully \n&gt; trying not to undermind his new superior. he awaits her approval \n&gt; before exiting.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
