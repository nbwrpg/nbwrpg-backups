And for what? Didn&#39;t he hear their leaders transmitions?\nSnow Tech was still waiting for Iron To awnser his silly greeting. He stood \nthere and looked at her with big, kitten eyes and waited. meanwhile, Shadow \nCat was busy with her small, hand-held computer, making some estimations and \ncalculations on her and Snow Tech&#39;s pursuers. She also wondered what had \nhappened to their littlest companion. It was vital he was not lost, he \nplayed an important role in the survival of a certain race of \nrobotic/organic species, and to loose him would be loosing the entire race. \nAnd their hard work would be for nothing.....*\n\n* The small cat inside Iron Raptors compartment was still awake and still \nwanting out. The motions that had knocked the little bot side to side had \nstopped, but his inprisonment had not. He mewed as loud and pitiously as \npossible, trying to get someones attention to let him out.*\n\n&quot; Mmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwww!
