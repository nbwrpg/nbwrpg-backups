She \nthen concentrates and a message is sent to Vampiza over a link all \nInfecticons share.\n\nFrostbite:(In her mind to Vampiza)&quot;Vampiza... go to the north western \nquadrant of the future united states. There are Maximal signatures, \nDecepticon signatures, X-Predacon signatures, and some unknowns. The \nDecepticons seem to be out numbered. Help them... they may prove to \nbe valuable allys.&quot;\n\nAbove the ocean, above the Oblivion for that matter, Vampiza floats \nin the air, his head down and his arms folded across his chest. He \nthen recieves the message from Frostbite and silently speeds off in \nthe direction of the Chivtron base, surrounded in an aura of \nChaochitan energy.\n\n\n"}}
