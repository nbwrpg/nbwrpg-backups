It always lets the long time\n&gt; character slip away.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) A short stay (a few hours usually) in the CR chamber and any damage is\n&gt; completely gone.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back as an enemy\n&gt; infiltrator.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone appears which after various meeting\n&gt; with colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; turns good again.
