You be careful too.&gt;\n&gt; And with that she felt Prowls arms open, looking down at the ground \nas she \n&gt; dropps a short way before landing on her feet, looking at the battle \nfrom \n&gt; this new view point,finding that she could see quite well through \nher helm.\n&gt; Her cape flew behind  her slightly, then looking down at the little \ncreature \n&gt; in her hands.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Remember, into the compartment.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *And with that she moved the little guy up over her shoulder, \nopening a \n&gt; little compartment in her back armor, where the blade of her sword \nwas \n&gt; mostly held.She tipped her hand so that he would tumble in.\n&gt; Her other hand moving up to take hold of the handle of her sword, \nsliding it \n&gt; out and holding it at the ready while she straightened up and looked \ntowards \n&gt; the battle.\n&gt; Hopefully the little ball-o-fuzz wouldn&#39;t find the ride too bumpy.\n&gt; &lt; I&#39;ll remember that.&gt;She replied to Prowl quickly.\n&gt; With that Iron Raptor steadied herself out and then began to run \ntowards the \n&gt; battle, since Prowl had dropped her off a few hundred meters from \nit.\n&gt; With the added armor her body felt heavy and her legs had to work \nhard, her \n&gt; feet pounding against the ground as she ran.\n&gt; With her sword in had Iron Raptor looked for a target, seeing one \nwhich \n&gt; seemed a good enough one to her.\n&gt; After watching Astral fire off missials at the CF, she decided that \nhe would \n&gt; be her first victom to taste her new power.\n&gt; Iron Raptor snarled as she brought her sword back, the blade glowing \nfor a \n&gt; second before bringing it down, an energy slash sent towards \nAstral&#39;s \n&gt; torso.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nht\n\n\n"}}
