He slumped beside \na \n&gt; wall and turned to Cybershark.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wake me up in two mega-cycles, and than I&#39;ll take over. We&#39;ll \n&gt; protect ourselves over the night, and perform the experiment \n&gt; tomorrow. Who knows, by this time tomorrow we could all be sipping \n&gt; energon on Cybertron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois fell asleep, but he had another dream.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was a continuation of the previuos dream. In it, Battera and \n&gt; Cybershark had arrived, at were attempting to free Vulois from his \n&gt; chains. Than the evil Vulois appeared, and fryed them both, growing \n&gt; new chains oon Vulois. The evil Vulois transformed into Child, and \n&gt; gazed at him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh great Vulois! Train me! Make me as great as you!&quot; Just than the \n&gt; being split, becoming Child and someone he had never seen before, \nbut \n&gt; some how knew his name.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Nemesis....Nemesis Enforcer?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Right Vulois.&quot;(Not moding! Dream sequence!), &quot;Little did you know, \n&gt; but for all your mission I planned to destroy it. And now you have \n&gt; done you job for me, and crushed yourself. But now I have a new \ntask, \n&gt; and that is to defeat Child and NEVER give peace a chance. And what \n&gt; your doing....could be very bad for these plans. You remember \n&gt; everything here, but when you wake up, you won&#39;t even remember this \n&gt; dream. If you remember your memories though, you will remember \nthis. \n&gt; And you will try to stop me. So I will strengthen your chains, and \n&gt; never et the old you leak out again!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A massive cross came out of the ground, and Vulois was pierced \n&gt; against it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now let your Alliance personality come back to you!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that the dream ended, and the evil Vulois came back to take \n&gt; control of the body.\n\n\n\n"}}
