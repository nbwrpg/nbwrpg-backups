The only ones they saw battling were Prowl and \nIron Raptor, but otherwise things were peaceful. They had left \nFirearm in a CR chamber programmed to keep him in stasis lock untill \nthey returned, so that he wouldn&#39;t snap and try to get out of the \nship.\n\n&quot;Lets combine and split those two up,&quot; Mantle says and all of the \nEletors launch into the air, forming different parts of Element. Soon \nthe gestalt emerges from behind the shields of his ship, heading over \ntoward Prowl and Iron Raptor.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl yells out in pain as Iron Raptor&#39;s teeth tear through his wing. \nHe jerks it out of the way, resulting in a loud crack and another \nroar from him. His wing was broken. Prowl opens his jaws, about to \nbite Iron Raptor in the neck again. He lunges forward, but a huge \nhand suddenly wraps around his neck, jerking him off of Iron Raptor. \nProwl tries to struggle and get away, but the hand was too powerful, \nlifting him high into the air.\n\nElement reaches down with his other hand, trying to pick up IR.\n\n\n"}}
