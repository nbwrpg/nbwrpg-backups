He hit the ground hard. He slowly got back up and fired his optic blasters rapid fire at Rowdy Wolf. \n\nUltracon was hit by Terrorsaur&#39;s missiles. He fell back hard.

He aimed at Ultracon with his shoulder \n&gt; missiles and fired. He backed up at the same time he fired. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf stepped out from the edge of the forest, clearly noticing \n&gt; the battle going on. He saw two Maximal Dinobots and the pterrorsaur \n&gt; he encountered earlier. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You bots and your pointless war!&quot; he shouted. He aimed his right arm \n&gt; onto Dinotron, armed with the newly fixed cannon onto it. He fired an \n&gt; electronic blast at him from behind.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n----------\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://home.netscape.com/webmail/\n\n"}}
