She was out of breath and feeling \ntired. &quot;Damn. I hope that spider wasn&#39;t poisonous.&quot;  She looked at the bite \narea and saw it was becoming infected. &quot;To The PIT!&quot;  She changed to bot \nform and kept going.\n\nThe spider was a rare hybrid of a blackwidow and tarantula cross.  It&#39;s bite \nwas not only a neurotoxin, but a DNA dissolver. It would slowly break down \nher animal DNA and leave only the bot intact.\n\nShe was almost to her destination.  She was feeling her spark race in her \nchest as well as feeling very fatigued.  She kept walking, but it was \nbecoming an effort to move at all. She stopped and transformed into leopard \nmode. &quot;I must obey orders. I must do what is expected of me.&quot;\n\nShe lay down on the ground and rolled over onto her side.  Her breathing was \nlabored and becoming shallow.  She closed her eyes and tried to not think of \nthe pain.  Her body felt like it was on fire and she was barely able to \nmove.  &quot;Matrix, you can&#39;t have me now. You took me once, and that&#39;s enough.&quot; \nshe said defiantly.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
