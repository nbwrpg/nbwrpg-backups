Not too bad, but it would kill him if he didn&#39;t get help soon. \nHe droped onto a branch to rest, when he felt the anger in him boil.\n\nOcoticz! Bronco is coming!

The need for destruction. \nThe only thing he was able to hang onto was his Maximal loyalty. Brix \nhad once again turned into Bronco, his evil personality. He felt the \nrage building up for Chordate. He jumped off the the branch, and \ntackled Chordate down, pointing his poison horns at his head.\n\n&quot;NOW YOU DIE, MAGGOT!!!&quot;\n\nBronco fired.\n\n\n"}}
