More \nAutobots were now on earth, and that made him sick. He silently \nflew up, away from the shuttle. He then spins aroung, holding his \ngun out, and pulls the trigger, sending a wave of energy towards \nthe crashed shuttle. The burst hits it, and begins a chain reaction \nof explosions, and all that is left behind where the shuttle was is a \ncrater, and a huge explosion. This brings a smile to Motormasters \nfac but it leaves quickly. He starts to fly back to base, opening his \ncomm-link to the base, any robots in the presence of the base will \nhear it. &quot;I am returning to base, and will arrive shortly. Something \nunfortunate has happened&quot;.\n\n"}}
