Phoenix has to be taking a huge whale of a \nbeating before she actually screams in pain.  A branding torch \ndoesn&#39;t cut it - no pun intended.\n\nPhoenix::\n\nThe femme doesn&#39;t give them the statisfaction of hearing her scream \nduring the branding, although several pained grunts escape her \ngritted teeth.  Phoenix knows how to deal with pain, and she focuses \non anything but the burning of her own body to bear the torment in \nrelative silence.\n\nHeartbreak&#39;s treatment is another matter.  As she lands hard on her \nback, memories surface of the things Clawful did to her, and Phoenix \nscrambles away, standing up and backing into a corner.  Trembling, \nthe femme tries to calm herself - there&#39;s no way it could be as bad \nas before, she rationalizes, since HBK doesn&#39;t have claws he could \nspear her to the floor with for starters.  It doesn&#39;t work - her mind \nkeeps superimposing the image of the Rogue berserker over Heartbreak.\n\nFear grips her spark compartment with an icy hand.  Seemingly in \nresponse to the threat, she feels her unstable mutant spark flare up \nand send hot tendrils of energy throughout her body.  Even more \nterrified of her own poorly understood powers than of anything the \nnWo might do to her, she tries to suppress the reaction to no avail.\n\nThe first external indication that something has gone very wrong is \nwhen Phoenix drops to her knees, her arms wrapped around her chest \nlike she&#39;s trying to keep herself from exploding, and that&#39;s not far \nfrom the truth.  Strange energy patterns begin sparking across her \nframe.  (Think when the BW characters get energon deep-fried, only \nthe lightning is orange instead of blue.)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hollywood Narrator&quot; \n&lt;hollywood.narrator@v...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: The sound of Hollywood Narrator typing a post woke up the \nneighborhood. People called the cops.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Arrow had watched the events with indifference. He had certain laws \nhe abided by. His own twisted laws. One of those was not to question \nwhat his fellow bot did. And he hadn&#39;t done so, yet. Back in his days \nwith the Radicons, when he had received the lobotomy from the leader \nof the group, Kracken, he still never questioned any orders or \nactions. When a comrade made a mistake, he would let it play out, and \nwhen an enemy made a mistake, he would take quick action and harm \nthem quickly and efficiently. Sneaky kills were obviously not against \nhis law, as he recalls right at the moment how he had ripped the \nspark from the body of the very child he had cared for in the \nChivtrons. He considered it a merciful act.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deemos, meanwhile, was quite shocked by the events. He thought it \nwas disgusting and inappropriate. This was hypocrisy, as Deemos was \nthe one who had sliced a team member to bits just for not doing \nbetter in battle when Deemos led his own group. He briefly recalls \nShokaract co-leading his group and almost becomes glad, for some \nunknown reason, but then puts his attention back on the events at \nhand. His optics lit up brightly when Heartbreak had kissed Phoenix \nand thrown her down. He knew the previous events would be \ncommonplace, but he thought this was going too far. However, this \nthought came from the guy who had plotted viciously killing his wife \nand son and had succeeded.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spider, meanwhile, had the third point of view. He was proud and \nsmiling. He enjoyed everything that went on. He was a rookie bot who \nwas eager for action and any sort of exciting event, no matter what \nkind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, a couple of STASIS PODS (I&#39;m sick of ships) fall down on \nthe planet. What will they become? What sides will they be on? Does \nanyone care?...\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Richard Allen\n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, February 16, 2003 5:09 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Party at nWo base!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   : : Wolfenstein/Razor/Diesel/Heartbreak : :\n&gt; \n&gt;   Wolfenstein gets out of the CR chamber. He had been changed to \nwhite and black and now sported the nWo logo. He headed back to the \ncell block.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Diesel had grown impatient with Hollywood, and got the branding \ntorch himself. He handed it to Razor.\n&gt; \n&gt;   HBK let the forcefield to the cell down and all nWo members \nsteped in for the party.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Heartbreak and Diesel took hold of Phoenix&#39;s arms from behind, \nholding her in place.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Razor activated the torch, with a evil grin on his face. He \nstepped forward very slowly, surely scaring the femme bot.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Razor: Now my dear, you will belong to us. If you... service us \nyou may live. If you refuse, I&#39;ll kill you where you stand.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Razor reached out with the torch and began to ingrave letters \ninto the beautiful body of Phoenix. She would surely be screaming \nfrom the pain, as the energon flame burnt through her armor, melting \npieces of her away. As Razor finished, Phoenix had the nWo logo \nburned across her chest. She had been branded.\n&gt; \n&gt;   All the boys started to laugh at what they had done. All except \nWolfenstein, who looked away. There were almost tears in his eyes. \nThis wasn&#39;t right, she didn&#39;t deserve this. The physical damage could \nbe repaired but mentaly? Could anyone recover from an event like this?\n&gt; \n&gt;   No time had passed from the branding before Heartbreak took \naction. He grabbed Phoenix bringing the hot femme to him, roughly. He \nwas grabbing hard, probably hurting her. He kissed her unwilling \nform, before throwing her down with great force.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Heartbreak: I&#39;m going to like this!\n&gt; \n&gt;   The preceding has been paid for by the\n&gt; \n&gt;   New World Order\n\n\n"}}
