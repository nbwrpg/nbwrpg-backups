Havoc&#39;s wings stuck out of his back, the\nmissile\n&gt; launchers and machine guns shifted to his shoulders. His left arm (Chaos)\nhad\n&gt; two missile launches emerging from the forearm, his right arm (Minion)\n&gt; hosting a tank barrel on the wrist. Repressor&#39;s copter blades stuck out of\n&gt; the ankle of his right foot, bent upward to hug the leg, but with\npotential\n&gt; to straighten out and cut anything in their path. Demolition&#39;s two\n&gt; 50-calliber gatling guns were mounted on his left thigh.\n&gt;\n&gt; A dual missile launcher was held in his hand, made of Repressor&#39;s missile\n&gt; launchers, with a large barrel in between. THe energy it took to power all\n&gt; his weapons drained WarMachine rather quickly, so he could not stay in\n&gt; gestalt mode too long.\n&gt;\n&gt; WarMachine laughs, looking down at Shockaract, firing two missiles and a\n&gt; plasma blast from his gun at him while he takes a step forward, his foot\n&gt; decending on Grenade.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; A shadow passes over Zardus, the Alliance commander glancing sideways to\nsee\n&gt; what was going on. He smiles as he sees WarMachine attacking Shockaract.\nOne\n&gt; more gestalt for the Alliance....\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus looks back at Blender, seeing if his slash had hit or not.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
