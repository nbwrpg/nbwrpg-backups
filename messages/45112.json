Things \nhave fused, others have melted and to put it bluntly Ragnus was going \ninsane.  No longer caring about his &#39;team&#39; or the \ndifferent &#39;factions&#39; , Ragnus struck out on his own, perhaps to cause \nchaos, perhaps to fufill his own selfish needs.  \n\n  He slowly makes his way across southern Europe looking for \nsomething.  What it is, he doesn&#39;t know. The only sure thing is that \nthis &#39;something&#39; is in trouble.\n\n\n//Ultima//\n\n  The hunt so far for he deranged twin, hadn&#39;t gone well.
