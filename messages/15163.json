She was a pred on a maximal ship.  ANd now tat she\nhad \nfinished her part of the mission, she was stuck until she could take \nIron Raptor to the embassy.  Until then, she would have to stay here \nand wait.  She felt down.  Yes she was happy about talking the leader \ninto joining her for the peace talks, but she still felt so out of \nplace here.  Most of the bots on the ship hardly noticed her.  And\nthe \nother ones didn&#39;t trust her. She sisn&#39;t know how to gain thier trust.\n \nSHe only knew that she was not apart of thier group. But only a \nvisitor.   She walked back towards her room and decided to go into \nhybernation again untill needed.  She walked down the hall and passed \nby the bridge.  She kept going and passed by the messhall.  She would \nreach her room shortly and hybernate.  She just wasn&#39;t wanted or \nneeded around here.  She reached her room and sttod infront of the \ndoor.  She hung her head and knew that there just wasn&#39;t anything\nelse \nto do.  She opened the door and walked inside.  She went to the bed \nand layed down, folding her wings tightly against her slender body.  \nShe closed her eyes and went into hybernation mode.  She would awaken \nlater on and see if she is needed.  She entered into teh deep sleep\nof \nhybernation.  Nothing will wake her until her program wakes her up. \n\n\n"}}
