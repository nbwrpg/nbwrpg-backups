BUSH OR JOHN\n&gt; &gt;KERRY GIVE THE FOLLOWING SPEECH?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;My Fellow Americans:\n&gt; &gt;As you all know, the defeat of the Iraq regime has been completed. Since\n&gt; &gt;congress does not want to spend any more money on this war, our mission\n&gt; &gt;in Iraq is complete.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This morning I gave the order for a complete removal of all American\n&gt; &gt;forces from Iraq. This action will be complete within 30 days. It is now\n&gt; &gt;to begin the reckoning.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Before me, I have two lists. One list contains the names of countries\n&gt; &gt;which have stood by our side during the Iraq conflict. This list is\n&gt; &gt;short. The United Kingdom, Spain, Bulgaria, Australia, and Poland are\n&gt; &gt;some of the countries listed there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The other list contains everyone not on the first list. Most of the\n&gt; &gt;worlds nations are on that list. My press secretary will be distributing\n&gt; &gt;copies of both lists later this evening.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Let me start by saying that effective immediately, foreign aid to  those\n&gt; &gt;nations on List 2 ceases immediately and indefinitely. The money saved\n&gt; &gt;during the first year alone will pretty much pay for the costs of the\n&gt; &gt;Iraqi war.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The American people are no longer going to pour money into third world\n&gt; &gt;Hell-holes and watch those government leaders grow fat on corruption.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Need help with a famine? Wrestling with an epidemic? Call France.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In the future, together with Congress, I will work to redirect this\n&gt; &gt;money toward solving the vexing social problems we still have at home.\n&gt; &gt;On that note, a word to terrorist organizations. Screw with us and we\n&gt; &gt;will hunt you down and eliminate you and all your friends from the face\n&gt; &gt;of the earth. Thirsting for a gutsy country to terrorize? Try France, or\n&gt; &gt;maybe China.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;To Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Yo, boys. Work out a peace deal\n&gt; &gt;now. Just note that Camp David is closed. Maybe all of you can go to\n&gt; &gt;Russia for negotiations. They have some great palaces there. Big tables,\n&gt; &gt;too.  I am ordering the immediate severing of diplomatic relations with\n&gt; &gt;France, Germany, and Russia. Thanks for all your help, comrades. We are\n&gt; &gt;retiring from NATO as well. Bon chance, mes amis.\n&gt; &gt;I have instructed the Mayor of New York City to begin towing the many\n&gt; &gt;UN diplomatic vehicles located in Manhattan with more than two unpaid\n&gt; &gt;parking tickets to sites where those vehicles will be stripped, shredded\n&gt; &gt;and crushed. I don&#39;t care about whatever treaty pertains to this. You\n&gt; &gt;creeps have tens of thousands of unpaid tickets. Pay those tickets\n&gt; &gt;tomorrow or watch your precious Benzes, Beamers, and limos be turned\n&gt; &gt;over to some of the finest chop shops in the world. I love New York.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;A special note to our neighbors. Canada is on List 2. Since we are\n&gt; &gt;likely to be seeing a lot more of each other, you folks might want to\n&gt; &gt;try not pissing us off for a change. Mexico is also on List 2. President\n&gt; &gt;Fox and his entire corrupt government really need an attitude\n&gt; &gt;adjustment. I will have a couple extra tank and infantry divisions\n&gt; &gt;sitting around. Guess where I am going to put em? Yep, border security.\n&gt; &gt;So start doing something with your oil.\n&gt; &gt;Oh, by the way, the United States is abrogating the NAFTA treaty ---\n&gt; &gt;starting now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;We are tired of the one-way highway.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;It is time for America to focus on its own welfare and its own citizens.\n&gt; &gt;Some will accuse us of isolationism. I answer them be saying, &quot;darn\n&gt; &gt;tootin.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Nearly a century of trying to help folks live a decent life around the\n&gt; &gt;world has only earned us the undying enmity of just about everyone on\n&gt; &gt;the planet.  It is time to eliminate hunger in America. It is time to\n&gt; &gt;eliminate homelessness in America. It is time to eliminate World Cup\n&gt; &gt;Soccer from America.\n&gt; &gt;To the nations on List 1, a final thought. Thanks guys. We owe you and\n&gt; &gt;we won&#39;t forget. To the nations on List 2, a final thought. Drop dead.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;God bless America.\n&gt; &gt;Thank you and good night.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If you can read this, thank a teacher.  If you are reading it in\n&gt; &gt;English, thank a soldier.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;( Please forward this to at least ten friends and see what happens!\n&gt; &gt;Let&#39;s get this to every USA computer!)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Is your PC infected?
