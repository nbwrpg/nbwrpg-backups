I believe that there may still\nbe.&quot; She \n&gt; paced a moment, then stopped & rested her clawed paw/hands upon her\nhips. \n&gt; &quot;The only Master of Cybertron, is Megatron! Conquerer of all of\nCybertron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She turned around. &quot;As to my older form being fleeting, we shall see\nabout \n&gt; that. You forget, if this is of a different age, my own knowledge is\nof a \n&gt; different age as well.&quot; shifting to a more deadly tone. &quot;I know not\nwho you \n&gt; are, or of the others you speak of, but I am a Decepticon. My\nloyality is to \n&gt; Megatron & his wishes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now... must I tear apart this world in search of what I need alone?\nOr will \n&gt; I gain cooperation? It&#39;s not good to be against me, rest assured you\nsay the \n&gt; same that I should not betray you. But.. how many Transformers do\nyou know \n&gt; who have survived since the time of the Great War? Hmm?&quot; Her optics\nwere icy \n&gt; but a slight old glint was in them. She had many ideas. In her\n&#39;mind&#39; she \n&gt; still had skematics of her old form. The form that was an upgrade by \n&gt; Scrapper. She enjoyed this one the best.\n\nBelthassan&#39;s reply to her stare was equally cold. It was getting\nobvious he didn&#39;t like her.\n\nBelthassan: Oh? Then let me update history. The Great Wars are over.\nMegatron and Optimus Prime are both dead. Your time is gone. You said\nit yourself: no other Decepticon made it to this age... at least, not\nwithout the upgrade to Maximal or Predacon. Thus, I say that the likes\nof you are dead. Now shut up, listen, watch and learn.\n\nHe stood up and went close to an old wire cable sticking out of the\nground. It was old but still strong and big.\n\nBelthassan: Melchana, please make it so we can show what we&#39;re able to do.\n\nThe lioness came near and, in one movement of her arms, slashed the\nwire in three pieces. She threw them all in the air.\n\nBelthassan shot a freezing ray of ice at one piece and punched it with\na huge fist, shattering it in dozens of pieces.\n\nMelchana aimed at one with both arms at fired a hail of sandy\nparticles which eroded to piece to nothing in moments.\n\nGesper lashed out with his tail and ensnared the last piece. It seemed\nto do nothing but there soon was a crackling of static and the smell\nof something burning. When he let go, the fried wires fell smoking to\nthe ground.\n\nBelthassan: That is only a fraction of what we can do. Once you can\ntransform, you&#39;ll be able to use it too. Now the question is the same\none our first ancestors asked each other: Friend or Foe?\n\n\n"}}
