Adam has told me that\nhe is facing RL issues with school and other things and we are all\naware that Airly is facing computer issues.\n\nNo problems on those accounts, I know we all have RL stuff that will\ncome in on us from time to time :)\n\nHowever in an effort to give everyone time to get back on their feet I\nwill just be focusing on the thread &#39;Frigid Callings&#39; which for the\nmost part involves Sandy&#39;s characters.\n\nYou see the problem is that Tuscon has kind of shot ahead of the rest\nof the pack, and this is all suppose to be a coming together of\nthings.\n\nAgain no pressure from me on anyone. :)\n\nI will just be patient and let folks take a breather and come back\nwhen they are ready. I don&#39;t want to force anyone to struggle and post\nwhen there are other destractions in their lives.\n\nJust poke me when you are ready, and I will unpause the other threads\nand we can go on. (I will probrably speed the other threads up to\nmatch Tuscon&#39;s position)\n\nI hope everyone is enjoying themselves (In the game at in Real Life)\nand I look foward to seeing everyone back in the posting spirit in the\ndays ahead! :)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
