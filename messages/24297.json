He pulled his \nhand out. No doubt ripping apart aracnia&#39;s spark. (She should be dead cuz \ngetting 20 spikes pulled out of your chest should destroy her spark. Also \nremember hell beast is doomed. He has about 30 sec now to live. He should be \nunconsious. Remember the virus is ever changeing and no cure will ever be \nmade in time to save him.)\n Apocalypse hated this. Death didnt wait to see the damage of his reaper. He  \npowered his jet pack and flew off. \n The 12ft red dragon went to beast mode and flew off. (you can shoot at the  \nas they leave though I dont your troops will have the health to do so.)\n The bots locked onto drillbit&#39;s signal and flew towards it.\n\n"}}
