A fear she had never known in her entire life.  She was happy \n&gt; that she had someone riding in front with her, even if it wasn&#39;t exactly \n&gt; an Autobot or Maximal.  More and more, she begins to cling to Perceptor. \n&gt; Even Tucson could sense her rapidly beating heart spark.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Straight Shot, are you all right?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She clings more to Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No.  I&#39;m scared out of my spark.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson could not deny the feelings he had now himself.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Truthfully, so am I.  So am I.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride now leans over from the back of Tucson&#39;s cab, in the back \n&gt; seat, and looks down to Perceptor.  He could tell that Straight Shot was \n&gt; completely fear stricken, and something she normally did not display.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ve never seen her this scared.  Well, one time I have.  Two years ago, \n&gt; that nasty confrontation we had with the preds and the cons.  It was right \n&gt; after she saw Tucson get hit.... Wait a minute...  Tucson can&#39;t remember \n&gt; who hit him...  But, she was there, inside him when it happened.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot now rambles on about the incident two years ago.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; He never saw it comming, a blast that would take him off line almost \n&gt; instantly.  But I did Perceptor, I saw it.  And there was no time ta take \n&gt; the wheel and drive Tucson out of danger to avoid it.  But I wish I did \n&gt; have the time because if I did, he wouldn&#39;tve gone off line, gone blind, \n&gt; and we wouldn&#39;tve lost Rodimus two years ago.  And now, it&#39;s happening all \n&gt; over again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride listens to Straight Shot and then looks to Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No doubt she&#39;s probably seen the bot who&#39;s guilty of striking Tucson \n&gt; down.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to everyone.  Courage returning somewhat.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yeah, I saw who did it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime now turns his audio sensors to inside his cab.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Straight Shot?  You - saw who hit me?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She swallows hard and nodds yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yeah, I did.  It was really hard to see who was up over us, but through \n&gt; the rear view mirror in Tucson&#39;s cab, I saw who it was.  It happened so \n&gt; fast...  Came out of nowhere... &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson was curious as to who had struck him, as he continues his fast \n&gt; drive through the tunnel.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Who was it Straight Shot?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Her face stifens.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Cyclonus.  He knows your blind spots and took advantage of them.  Yes \n&gt; Tucson, you were struck by a slag drinking Decepticon.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson&#39;s pace quickens in the tunnel.  New found rage builds within him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Then as soon as we find Rodimus Prime, we will tell him who was \n&gt; responsible for the entire mess. And after that, I will PERSONALLY see to \n&gt; it that Cyclonus gets what he rightfully deserves. Now, let&#39;s find \n&gt; Rodimus!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns on a honing signal, mixed with special sonar equipment, he tries \n&gt; to bounce harmless waves through the tunnel, attempting to pick up on the \n&gt; very alloy Rodimus is made of, to get a solid idea of how far he was \n&gt; within the tunnel.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;re here Rodimus, we will not give up on you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor/Talon\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; talon went inside tucson while Perceptor tunr on his audio devices  and \n&gt;&gt; said\n&gt;&gt; &quot;He should better does, I would hate to have done all this thing for\n&gt;&gt; naught!! &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sandy&quot; &lt;magicquartz@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, May 15, 2010 10:19 PM\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Into the Darkness\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson had done his job successfully, and turns off his sonar emitter.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot taps Perceptor on the shoulder as promised, to signal \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson had turned off his sonar emitting device.  Now, there was the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; threat of a cave in to deal with. Tucson Prime had to think fast if he \n&gt;&gt; &gt; was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to get everyone out of that part of the tunnel unharmed.  He \n&gt;&gt; &gt; accelerates\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to attempt a near escape.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Hang on, things are about to get a little bumpy!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride spots an open hatch in Tucson&#39;s cab.

We \n&gt;&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; leaving Rodimus behind.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot realizes that he&#39;s right, and watches the way ahead \n&gt;&gt; &gt; inside\n&gt;&gt; &gt; at the driver&#39;s side seat.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; No, we can&#39;t.

That way I know I will not harm you\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; when I do emit this attack. Straight Shot, when I&#39;m through doing \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tap him on the shoulder to let him know it&#39;s safe to turn them back\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As the alien insectoid menace of 5 continued to advance, the next\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; round of combat began!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tuscon gave orders to Perceptor to shut down his audio receptors, and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; thereby holding his attack.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Perceptor, desperately tried to turn off his receptors, and as if like\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a switch had been thrown his whole world went dark as his sensors\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; which in many ways relied on hearing was short down. He could still\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; smell the attacking creatures approach, but in no way would this sense\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of smell allow him to fire under battle conditions.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Seeing that Perceptor had successfully went dark he let loose with his\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sonic discharge, sending wave after disruptive wave into the tunnel!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For a moment the insectoid creatures looked at Tuscon as a strange\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sort of intelligence flashed through their optics before each one, one\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by one slumped over, victims of his attack. They all fell into stasis\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lock.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; However at the same time, due perhaps to the wide area sonic attack,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the walls themselves around the group began to rumble and shake as\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bits of stone and debris began to fall from the ceiling.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Although Perceptor could not see or hear, his vibrational sensors and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his digger&#39;s instincts told him one thing: CAVE IN!!!!!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (OOC: be very cautious about having characters doing a lot in your\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; next post(s) as there is not much time!
