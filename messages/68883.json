If you want to control them, I=\r\n do not \nmind \n&gt; their appearance.))\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder&#39;s commands were car=\r\nried out by the station and the guns \n&gt; erupted into the air with a deadly =\r\nsymphony of wreckage! Firepower \n&gt; ripped into the invaders as first the sh=\r\nuttle&#39;s batteries and then \n&gt; the Ark violently pulled sweeps from the skie=\r\ns! \n&gt; \n&gt; However much like the last battle the sweeps dispersed, making the=\r\nm \n&gt; much harder to hit. Using their agility and speed they turned in \nthe =\r\n\n&gt; air, spinning as the weapons continued to pepper the skies with \n&gt; bulle=\r\nts and energy!\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy for his part pulled back, using the Ark as an ad=\r\nditional \n&gt; defence as he laid into the oncoming sweeps. Much like Lord Eld=\r\ner&#39;s \n&gt; attack, it was effective but the sweep disperesed, leaving him to \n=\r\n&gt; pick one or two out of the air at a time rather then destroying \nmany \n&gt; =\r\nat a time. \n&gt; \n&gt; As Jhiaxus and Scorponok, Grimlock and Hydras and Rodimus =\r\nall \n&gt; approached from their different vectors, they could all see the \ngri=\r\nm \n&gt; vista of the sweeps, and the number of them was staggering. At the \n&gt; =\r\ncenter of all this Cyclonus floated a cold calm amidst the storm of \n&gt; swee=\r\nps that floated around him. \n&gt; \n&gt; To those who had been at the battle above=\r\n Atlantis the sight \nbrought \n&gt; a darker reality: Although there were not a=\r\ns many sweep here as \nthere \n&gt; were at Atlantis, with Cyclonus were several=\r\n other minions: \nDarkfate \n&gt; and Nightstrike as well as three others which =\r\nwere unknown - A \n&gt; warning that this battle may prove to be far more dange=\r\nrous then \nthe \n&gt; one before.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As Grimlock landed and attacked his bre=\r\nath weapon attack proved to \nbe \n&gt; effective, striking down several sweeps =\r\nand singed several others \nas \n&gt; they maneuvered out of his way. \n&gt;  \n&gt; As =\r\nHydras approached from the rear his guns opening up on the rear \n&gt; flank of=\r\n the sweeps, they dispersed into the skies as several of \nthem \n&gt; were brou=\r\nght down and many more came in to take their places. \n&gt; \n&gt; As the sweeps co=\r\niled around, absorbing the attacks from the would-\nbe \n&gt; defenders, in unis=\r\non they began to open fire on Ark and Legacy as \n&gt; well as Grimlock and the=\r\n defending shuttle!\n&gt; \n&gt; At same time minions were receiving orders from Sc=\r\nourge who was \n&gt; himself floating into position and was more then ready to =\r\nprove \n&gt; himself, &quot;Tumult, Nightstrike and Darkfate You are with me! We go =\r\n\nto \n&gt; destroy the ark, and TAKE the Matrix!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The answer from Tumult w=\r\nas quick, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; as he powered up his \n&gt; engines and maneuvered himself=\r\n into position near the top of the \nhost.\n&gt; \n&gt; Strangely the response for t=\r\nhe approaching Decepticons and \nPredicons \n&gt; was a bit different - Although=\r\n the Sweeps avoided combat, no \ncombat  \n&gt; was initiated. Instead Hydras re=\r\ncieved a call: \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hydras&quot; Cyclonus&#39; calm voice crackled over the commun=\r\nication lines \n&gt; in an ancient Unicronian code. &quot;You were once Galvatron, I=\r\n can feel \n&gt; his essence within you, and I have felt it since you have \napp=\r\nroached. \n&gt; I have given you and yours a stay of execution because of that =\r\n\n&gt; ancient connection between us. Approach no farther and live, leave \n&gt; an=\r\nd you will be rewarded when our work here is done.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Da&#39;mini=\r\non)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
