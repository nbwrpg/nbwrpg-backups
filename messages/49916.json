The council are the ones that decide if there is an election \nand from what I have seen, the council never said that there would be \none.  So please stop with all of these OOC about if you were on \ncouncil you would do this or that.  And for if you would ban each \nother or not, that really isn&#39;t an issue.  Because if you did ban \nsomeone with no reason then it would show in the records and you \nwould be excuse from the council.  Also, trying to get yours and \nother ideas noticed.  That is not really going to happen, because \nwhen I was a council member I said if anyone has ideas that they \ncould send me an email and I would talk to the council about yet no \none ever did except once or twice and I brought it up to the \ncouncil.  As far as your own ideas, don&#39;t hold your breathe.  It \ntakes 75% of the council to approve something and then you have to \npester rAuq to change the rule site which he is to lazy to do most of \nthe time.:)  So basically what you are looking for in a council \nmember is someone who can moderate people at the right times.  \nSomeone who gets along with the rest of the council.  Someone who \nwill pester rAuq(Because he updates the sites).  So now if there is \nan election, I will run.  I will listen to everyones ideas(IF they \nsend them to me.)  I will continue to update the events page(Come on \npeople send me events).  I will pester rAuq(Already do that:)).  I \nwill do whatever people want me to do(except throw leaves at \npeople).  So if you read this then I am amazed if you didn&#39;t then I \ndon&#39;t care about you(of coarse you wouldn&#39;t know that because YOU \nDIDN&#39;T READ IT!!!.  Again I would like to ask everyone to cut down on \nthe OOCs because they can get annoying.  As always please send me \nevents so I can update the events page.  HAVE A NICE DAY!!!\n\n      \n                Sincerly,\n                One time founder and One time council member Hugar\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This is nothing.
