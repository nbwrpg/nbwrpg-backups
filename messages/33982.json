Yet�how could it have been?    Carnage lay there in her reptilian beast mode, moving not a muscle but looking out into the yonder and letting her vision travel over the wide expanse of the open plains; her perch on the outcrop of a cliff and where she had dozed off, was perfect for sightseeing.  But she wasn�t concerned with the scenery and she saw none of it, the reality of her imagination running wild.         Had it been? But if so, then why was she there? So many questions running though her sleepy mind, yet nothing made sense.  She had dreamed Teltoli had returned and live then returned to normal, she had even taken on the role of teacher for the young woman.  However�that was all just a dream, realistic, but a dream.\r\nShe was still alone.**  � So be it.�  ** So she laid and watched the world go by, an eye always in the distance, never looking back.**\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
