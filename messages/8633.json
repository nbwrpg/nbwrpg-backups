He knew that \nhe could die if he didn&#39;t get to a CR chamber. He called out.\n    &quot;Maximals, please don&#39;t shoot,&quot; Wolveritron said as loud as he could, as \nhis comm was out. &quot;I need a CR Chamber badly. It was your slaggin autoguns \nthat did this!&quot;\n    He couldn&#39;t really control his temper, it was the Wolverine in him.\n    Optimus Prime heard this. He couldn&#39;t turn down a broken bot.\n    &quot;I will let you in, but you must disarm yourself and give me all your \nweapons,&quot; Prime said. \n    &quot;No way bub!&quot; Wolveritron said. &quot;I can&#39;t give up my weapons. They are \nattached to me.&quot;\n    &quot;Fine, but you will be under watch,&quot; Prime said. He went out and helped \nWolveritron to the CR chamber. He put him in and set the healing process.\n\n"}}
