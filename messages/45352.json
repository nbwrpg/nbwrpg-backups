J/j \n&gt; about the j/j. I will try to get off of punishment\n&gt; as soon as \n&gt; posible, BTW idea.  Do you want to close down the\n&gt; RPG during the \n&gt; Holidays to give people time to think ant everything\n&gt; on how to \n&gt; improve the RPG and also cause its the holidays.   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; That was... rather abrupt.
