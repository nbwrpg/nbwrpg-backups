I just had to get my point across.\n&gt; \n&gt; My mails replying to Cardhead were giving him a \n&gt; taste of his own medicine.\n&gt; \n&gt; My posts replying to Dewboy was complaining that\n&gt; right and complaining about him trying to pin his\n&gt; religion on me.\n&gt; \n&gt; And overall I think NBW has unfortunately turned\n&gt; into a mere shadow of the great RPG it once was.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just now come to realize that if I&#39;m not welcome\n&gt; here, I&#39;ll gladly leave. I&#39;ve been up and down that\n&gt; lonely road of faith. DBZSF for me means that my\n&gt; RPGing skills are never wasted.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a time when all of my characters were\n&gt; serious. They all had very deep personalities. But\n&gt; those days are long gone, it appears, thanks to the\n&gt; character limit. The character limit of 5 prevents\n&gt; me from being able to do what I do best, right.\n&gt; Yeah, I know my stables were bad, but some great\n&gt; individual characters came out of it sometimes,\n&gt; correct? My unwillingness to return to my past are\n&gt; because it feels to me NBW is just no more fun. I\n&gt; have really tried to post. I wanted to help it. But\n&gt; apparently the new guy thinks he&#39;s a more valuable\n&gt; player than me. It&#39;s no wonder the RPG is dying.\n&gt; Look here. New guy comes in and posts and Cardhead\n&gt; will attack him and run him off. You can look\n&gt; forward to that in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you all enjoyed my explanation mail.\n&gt; \n&gt; The world is ******...\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
