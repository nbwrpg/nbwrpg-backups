This waiting is getting on my nerves.&gt;\n&gt;A light but warm breeze stirred the fine grains of sand that were scattered\n&gt;over the ground, joined with the cold cinders of past plasma charges.\n&gt;Ruffling the black fabric which hung from her broad but plated shoulders.\n&gt;It hadn&#39;t been that long since the last battle and she could admit that she\n&gt;wasn&#39;t eager to see another...but with the wish that at least SOMETHING\n&gt;would happen couldn&#39;t help but be made.\n&gt;&lt; Maybe after I&#39;m through with the Maximals I can disappear into the\n&gt;holo-rooms for a while.&gt;\n&gt;But who was she kidding?! It hadn&#39;t failed yet! Every time she tried to\n&gt;start something, something else just HAD to happen.\n&gt;&lt; Oh well. One day.&gt;*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; We&#39;ll wait 20 more cycles for this guy to show, otherwise we&#39;ll head back\n&gt;into the city.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron spoke outloud so that AzureBlade would hear.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
