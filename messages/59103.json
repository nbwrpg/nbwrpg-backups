We have to build a central artillery piece. You will build \nthe basis. We need a magna platform to make the gun itself hover, and \nthree power stations. The enemy is Unicron, no more, no less. Your \njob will be to supervise the construction. Take the freight barge in \nthe cargo bay with you. It should be loaded with all the needed \nmaterial. Here is the location.\n\nThe Tripred officer handed his soldier a small datapad containing the \ndetailed map of the building site and the plans for the hover cannon. \nIt showed the magna platform as a disc rimming the edges of a large \ncrater. Inside the crater, three doors opened on three small nuclear \npower stations. In the air, a huge artillery cannon floated like a \ngiant arrowhead threatening anyone coming too close.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; : : DeathStar : :\n&gt; \n&gt; DeathStar stepped out from the chamber, his new TM2 form glistening \nunder the light.\n&gt; \n&gt; DeathStar: I&#39;m prepared, sir.
