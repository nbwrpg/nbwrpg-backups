Dewboy, when did rhesus land? when did he get here? why is he\n&gt; here? Why has noone traded with him but Mustex? Why is he so well\n&gt; known yet noone speaks of him? How did Mustex get on the island? Why\n&gt; are you insulting yan? Is it because he cares about making the RPG\n&gt; fair? Is it because you cant mode like people do in DBZ? Is it because\n&gt; he said you cant control a bases shields or another persons chars? Is\n&gt; it his, Rauqs, Megans, and Allorans fault that they made that rule and\n&gt; must now change it so you can be happy?

Inside of it various devices are\n&gt; implanted into her body to make sure she returns.(This has been\n&gt; approbed by airly in private mail).

Kyle, please explain how Mustex got beyond Alliance shields. \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; only post from you dealing with how he got there was filled with\n&gt; &gt; extreme moding, and I didn&#39;t see another one.
