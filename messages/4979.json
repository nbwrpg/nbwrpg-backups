He held his side, feeling pain. He looked \n&gt;down\n&gt;and saw a green mark there. Slag, he was poisioned.\n&gt;\n&gt;He kept on running.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Quickstrike was thrown to the ground by KitKat.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;What in tarnation are ya doin&#39;?&quot; he shouted at her.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
