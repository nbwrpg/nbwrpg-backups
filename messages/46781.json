My first postie \nhere, just \n&gt; lemme know if I screw anything up in here, and I&#39;ll be more than \nglad to \n&gt; change it! ^_^ \n&gt; \n&gt; IC: A wolf howled, joined by several others in a chorus. After that, \nit was \n&gt; silence...or as silent as a forest could get. One of the pack \nmembers, one \n&gt; that had strayed from the others, moved towards the opening of a \nsmall cave. \n&gt; Caution written in every movement, it sniffed carefully at an item \nwhich \n&gt; shouldn&#39;t have been there...a status pod. \n&gt; \n&gt; A bright light emerged, scanning for a beast form. As the wolf was \nscanned, \n&gt; it yelped and jumped away. Away from that and the strange, \ncomputer-ish \n&gt; voice. &quot;Error...error..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The pod opened as the wolf backed farther from it, ears back and \ngrowling. A \n&gt; small wolf emerged, eyes blue as crystal. Her fur matched that of \nthe wolf \n&gt; before her, many shades of grey blended together into one coat. The \nwolf \n&gt; before her looked curious, moving a bit closer and sniffing \nagain...but this \n&gt; other wolf didn&#39;t quite smell right. Still, this wolf was better \nthan no \n&gt; company at all. Not to mention this territory was his, and if this \nfemale \n&gt; wished to stay, she would be a part of HIS pack. \n&gt; \n&gt; She turned to him, eyes narrowed. Wings opened...bat wings. She \nsnarled, \n&gt; revealing fangs longer than the other wolf have seen before. The \nwolf backed \n&gt; away again, tail low...then turned and ran. \n&gt; \n&gt; The bat-wolf smirked, wings settling against her back. The other \nside was \n&gt; covered in fur as well, making them nearly invisable to the eye. \nLooking back \n&gt; and forth, trying to make sense of where exactly she was...and who \nexactly. \n&gt; Her name she remembered...but...\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Mistra...&quot; she said softly aloud, confirming with herself. Yes, \nthat was her \n&gt; name. She remembered that much. But...\n&gt; \n&gt; Predicons...Maximals...which side was she on...?\n\n\n"}}
