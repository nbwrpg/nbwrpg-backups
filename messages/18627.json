Her woulds were getting\n&gt; to her.  Her beautiful female torso was now riddled with holes from\n&gt; the shots, her shoulders were shot up and her legs were leaking as\n&gt; bad as the rest of her.  She was starting to feel weak from the loss\n&gt; of mech fluid.  She fired her optic lazars at twice at Beholder, and\n&gt; fires twice at Gigas.\n&gt;\n&gt; She stumbled and fell to the ground.  She growled and got back up.\n&gt; She was in a lot of pain, but was to mad to stop.  She kept firing,\n&gt; not giving up untill she was dead.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Zardus/Reptilica/Bloodystrike/Havoc/Repressor::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Zardus tries to dodge, one of the shots hitting him in the chest\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; leaving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a large dent.
