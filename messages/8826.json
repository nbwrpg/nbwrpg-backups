Her fellow Predacons \nwere expecting the information in which she was to gather, and she knew that \nthey weren&#39;t going to wait forever.\nWith a heavy sigh she then looked up at Perndabot.*\n\n&quot; Here is where you stop...and my task begins.&quot;\n\n* She then held up the stasis ball to her face and looked at Gangon&#39;s spark, \nknowing that she had to do something if he was going to servive through all \nthis.*\n\n&quot; Looks like I have to take you with me after all. The Matrix knows I don&#39;t \nwant you to die.&quot;\n\n* So with that she kneeled where she had stood, opening her leg compartment \nand taking out a few salect items. One of them being an energy relay cord \nthat she would use to keep Gangon alive.\nCarefully removing a small plate on her hip she inserted one end of the \ncord, then carefully inserted the other into a slot on the other side of the \nball.\nThe cord was attached to a main finction system in her hip, relaying all \nthat her body had towards the spark in the ball. Basically, it was an \numbilical cord.\nThe energy in her mech fluid would be fed into Gangon&#39;s spark through the \ncord, as well as the oxygen it needed and so on.\nShe hoped that it would buy him some more time until she could get back to \nbase and get him into a new body.\nThen placing the stasis ball into another compartment in her leg she looked \nover the few things in which she needed to infultrate the Maximal base.\nWhile she sorted through a few things she spoke to the spark in her leg.*\n\n&quot; If there&#39;s anything else you know I can do to make sure you like, you tell \nme. Alright? And you shouldn&#39;t bounce around in there, there&#39;s enough \npadding.&quot;\n\n* Then sure that she had everything she needed she got to her feet and \ncollected her things. Looking up at Perndabot she smiled.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;ll be quick but make sure that you&#39;re ready to slag some foolish \nMaximals if they come after me. Alright?&quot;\n\n* Then with that she treansformed into best mode and opened a cloaked \nchannel to the Predacon base. Then personalizing the transmission to \nRampage.*\n\n&quot; Rampage, this is BrightBlade. Keep all base defences on full, ready for \nany attack from anybot. With times as they are now we can&#39;t be too careful. \nBe ready for the information transfer soon. Any other messages you relay to \nme from here on must be coded and recoded, I can&#39;t rist being descovered by \nthe Maximals. BrightBlade out.&quot;\n\n* And with that she deactivated her com-link, looking out across the field \nto the massive shapd of the Cybertronien Fire.\nWith a sigh she placed the cloaking device on her furry shoulder and \nactivated it. Hotwired to make sure that it could not even be detected by a \ncloak scann she moved out into the gresslands, keeping low and well hidden \nin the long yellow stalks. Now the test began!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
