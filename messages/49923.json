The sleek gray and \nblack mech emblazoned with the Wolf Clan crest surfaced. There was \nsomething wrong, though. The Solitaire had a cyclopean cockpit, where \nthis one possessed a wolf head similar to the ceremonial mask worn by \nthe Clan&#39;s bloodnamed warriors. Another thing about it was the fact \nthat it seemed to be swimming out of the sea.\n  When Katya finally reached the shore, she looked at herself only to \nfind out that she had fused with her mech. The heavy large laser \nnormally forming the right arm was now readily standing in her back \nand a right arm similar to a human one took its place. The only thing \nwas it was made of the same material as the rest of the mech.\n\nKatya: BY THE BLOOD OF NICHOLAS KERENSKY!!!!!!\n\nShe stared at herself in shock, terror and disbelief. She was now the \nswift and dangerous mech she had piloted.\n\nKatya: That can not be! I must be dreaming or dead!\n\nRagnar: Unfortunately, we are not, Loremaster.\n\nShe turned, only to find the huge lumbering Dire Wolf. It move like a \nhuman, for as much as its unman-like chassis allowed it to. Only when \nthe cockpit retracted and revealed a figure, the top becoming a \nbreastplate and the arms formed shoulder cannons, allowing more \nman-like limbs to appear did she realize that it was actually Ragnar \nhimself!\n\nKatya: Ragnar! What has happened to us? Where is Vlad?\n\nRagnar: For both questions, I do not know, but for the second, I do \nnot care. And before you even suggest otherwise, I think we should \nwork together for now. \n\nShe thought for a moment, then looked up at him.\n\nKatya: You are right, Star Colonel. What do you think we should do?\n\nRagnar etched a half-smile.\n\nRagnar: I do not know about you, but I still feel cold. I suggest we \nmake a fire for now. If there are hostiles or beasts coming at us, \nattracted by the fire, we should be able to take them on.\n\nThe woman shivered. Yes, she was cold, as human sensations seemed not \nto have left totally her metallic body. In silence, she went to gather \nsome wood. Ragnar salvaged the little debries from the Bloody Fang \nthat had made it to the shore. When she returned, she threw the wood \nin one spot and used her heavy small laser to light it up.\n\nKatya: I assume, Ghost Bear, that this is a truce at least between us \nfor some times...\n\nRagnar: If you do not oppose it, neither do I. At least until we are \npicked up. If only we had a mean to know where we are...\n\nThey both looked at the sky, not recognizing the constellation for \nthey had never come to Terra before this day...\n\n\n"}}
