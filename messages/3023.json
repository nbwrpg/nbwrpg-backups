She had not realized Dinobot was wounded.\n&gt; Tavatron dismissed the concern as quickly as it had come to her, if he was\n&gt; seriously injured he would tell her. Then again...\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron&#39;s worry was finally put to rest when Dinobot transformed. If he\nwas\n&gt; well enough to transform then he was alright. However, when she spoke her\n&gt; latest &#39;insult&#39; she began to worry again. It wasn&#39;t like Dinobot to get so\n&gt; stressed out over a simple word, even if it wasn&#39;t spoken in the most\n&gt; positive of senses.\n&gt;\n&gt; She dropped into a very low crouch when Dinobot glared at her, drawing\nback\n&gt; her head and gazing up at him. She knew that if he got angry enough he\ncould\n&gt; easily rip her in two, and no amount of training would be able to save\nher.\n&gt; Tavatron&#39;s look  than became one of curiousity, Dinobot didn&#39;t look so\nangry\n&gt; anymore, but he wasn&#39;t exactly looking friendly either. She raised an\n&gt; eyridge and slowly rose from her crouched position until she was standing\n&gt; upright again. Tavatron snarled then smiled when she saw that Dinobot was\n&gt; back in the joking spirit again, however she made it a point to ask him\n&gt; about his reaction later, when he couldn&#39;t dodge the question, and when\nshe\n&gt; had a more readily available route of escape:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m a WHAT?!&quot; Tavatron said with mock anger. She was really angry, but\nthe\n&gt; look on her face would have made even her own mother think otherwise:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tavatron, MAXIMIZE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron transformed and caught up with Dinobot just outside the War Room.\n&gt; She gave him a quick smile before pushing open the door:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You think you&#39;re so smart, don&#39;t you?&quot; Tavatron held the door open for\n&gt; Dinobot, waiting for him to enter.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Old school buds here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4057/10/_/_/_/960500999/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
