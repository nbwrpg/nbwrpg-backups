The real\none. Another person posted that characters are not allowed to die\ncurrently...he is utterly incorrect.\n\nThe problem is the role-playing 101 aspect. People are given the\nresponsibility to judge how much damage they take...however as we&#39;ve seen\nsome can&#39;t role-play their way out of a wet paper bag let alone responsibly\njudge how much damage their character takes. When a bot does get damaged\nwhat typically happens here?\n\nHere&#39;s the list:\n\n1) The enemy bot suddenly becomes cockeyed unable to hit the broad side of a\nbarn even if he was a g1 and standing over it.\n\n2) The bot never gives chase to his prey. It always lets the long time\ncharacter slip away.\n\n3) A short stay (a few hours usually) in the CR chamber and any damage is\ncompletely gone.\n\n4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back as an enemy\ninfiltrator.\n\n5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone appears which after various meeting\nwith colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; turns good again. Personality reverts to\npre-evil clone.\n\n6) Character &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful offspring. Personality\nis hardly different.\n\n7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but the players 6 other characters cart it&#39;s blasted\ncarcass back to a lab where they resurrect him.\n\n8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with new bot same personality...eventually\npeople will forget you died and you can go back to your old form.\n\nSince most will never let their &quot;favorite&quot; character(s) die, I mean truly\ndie, never come back like, there&#39;s really very little new plotlines you can\ndo with them without repeating rehashed already done ones. Take for example\nthe geotrons planing to attack the new cat faction....both factions will\nsurvive, I doubt either player who controls the majority of bots in either\nfaction is gonna let their characters get anywhere near killed.\n\nAnd what&#39;s to stop this from happening if a restart/sequel DOES occur? The\nrole-playing by some will still stink, characters will still be incapable of\ndying and given another year or so all plotlines for THAT game will be\nstarting to repeat. While I still do believe a restart/sequel is in order I\nthink the role-playing problem needs addressing first to stop a repeat of\nwhat&#39;s happening to NBW.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, January 20, 2002 5:57 AM\nSubject: All Read: Important\n\n\n&gt; My appologies, Narrator, I actually missed your original post.\n&gt;\n&gt; I find that Neo Beast Wars has been dragged on for too long, and the\n&gt; world is becoming clogged with bases among other things. Ideas are\n&gt; becoming exausted, if not completely exausted already. It seems to\n&gt; me that we are almost delaying the end of the rpg. If you&#39;ve created\n&gt; one storyline that you like, is it not fair to say that you can\n&gt; create another better one?\n&gt;\n&gt; The idea of creating a sequel to the rpg is one that I would agree\n&gt; with. That would require several things to happen:\n&gt; 1) Changing the name of the RPG.\n&gt; 2) Appropriate changes to the website.\n&gt; 3) A means to store all of everyone&#39;s previous characters (don&#39;t\n&gt; know about everyone else, but I don&#39;t want to lose the bio&#39;s of all\n&gt; my characters).\n&gt; 4) New story (i have an idea, not necessarily for the story, but for\n&gt; how we could create the story).\n&gt; 5) A catalyst to start us all off (the story should provide that).\n&gt; 6) Implementation of new rules, some of which have been, and are\n&gt; being, discussed in the login messageboard.\n&gt; 7) other stuff that could be written if I wasn&#39;t so tired.\n&gt;\n&gt; All in all, since there are more people voting anti-restart that I&#39;d\n&gt; anticpated, I&#39;ll ask everyone a perhaps fate deciding question:\n&gt;\n&gt; Would it be favourable to have a sequel instead of a restart?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m agree with Soulstice, restart isn&#39;t good idea. All have good\n&gt; &gt; story-lines and good characters. Perhaps the best would be\n&gt; eliminate\n&gt; &gt; less importat characters of our story-line (every rpgers could\n&gt; choice\n&gt; &gt; at whom wants eliminate) and elimitante factions where are member\n&gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t posting and join factions that have few characters\n&gt; &gt; playing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That other way than restart.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I at first wasn&#39;t sure if I could vote in this one. Not\n&gt; only\n&gt; &gt; am I seemingly not too much an important part of this RPG, despite\n&gt; &gt; the general current lack of members, and the fact that I&#39;ve been\n&gt; here\n&gt; &gt; for getting close to 2 years, but also I am not involved in this\n&gt; &gt; restart. I have very few characters. Characters that, if the RPG\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; restarted, will still be together (Insecticons, specifically), and\n&gt; &gt; therefore it wouldn&#39;t harm me to vote yes. However, I don&#39;t think\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; could vote yes, because I am apposed to restarting the RPG. I have\n&gt; &gt; decided to vote no. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me to end the\n&gt; saga\n&gt; &gt; of Neo Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked hard over\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; years to keep going. I don&#39;t think that we could suddenly pretend\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; never happened, I think it&#39;s impossible. Maybe if we ended it and\n&gt; &gt; started the sequel, I wouldn&#39;t mind so much, but otherwise, my\n&gt; vote\n&gt; &gt; is no.
