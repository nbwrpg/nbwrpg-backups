Mind \ntaking me to him or her?&quot;\n\nooC: Doomsday and Icey Doom are going to rejected if they don&#39;t \nbecome characters to be RPed. Right now you have them down as gods \nand as such are invicible. There is a rule that specifically states \nthat no bots may be invincible, and therefore we shouldn&#39;t need to \ncreate a rule saying that gods are not allowed, because it is only \ncommon sense NOT to have them. This is a Beast Wars RPG, and the \naren&#39;t even Transformers.\n\nBaphomet (LN, make sure you&#39;re reading this) is alright as long as \nhe only works through his underlings, and doesn&#39;t use his power \npersonally.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Hottie4u2have1@a... wrote:\n&gt; Lioconvoy:I am Lioconvoy and are goals are to help out groups that \nare in \n&gt; need and make some new friends unfortunately it seems there is \nonly violence \n&gt; and carnage here so we will have to fight D-13 and other evil bots \nif they  \n&gt; start a fight with us. You should really talk to Panthero to find \nout more.\n&gt; Doomsday:I am Doomsday and i have just landed here.Me and my \nbrother are the \n&gt; catz god you see we have ultimate power which we use just to \ndefend ourselves \n&gt; and help out are brothers.\n\n\n"}}
