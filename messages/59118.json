The hull was starting to melt in a few places. \n\n&quot;Come on baby, hold together long enough to get us to the ground. If \nyou stay in one piece, I may get you flight worthy again. Just hang \non until the ground at least.&quot;\n\nShe guided the ship towards a continent.  She watched as sthe ground \nwent from looking far away to right in her face.  She held the nose \nup as she tried to fly a stone through the air. It went down.  \nCrashing through trees, the wings torn off by trees, the rest of the \ntail was ripped off. She hit a tree head on. It sent the ship \nsideways.  It came to a hault against another tree, sideways.  She \nwas still in the seat as the ship lights blinked and then lost all \npower.  She was leaning forward against the console, dazed and little \nshook up.  She sat back and looked around. A tree limb was hanging \ndown through the front window.  The back half of the little ship was \ngone. She could see straight through the ship and looked at the trees \noutside.\n\nShe sighed, &quot;Well, you may not have made it in one piece old girl, at \nwe still made it together.&quot;  \n\nShe got up and went looking around the ship.  She found, under a pile \nof scrap, the beacon that would send a distress signal. She hoped \nthat someday, someone would find her.\n\nThe beacon was neither Autobot or Decepticon. It was a neutral MAYDAY \nsignal. It had been designed that in times of war, it would be able \nto be picked up by all, but not identified as being one allience or \nanother.  Her insignia was also reversable.  Her parent&#39;s put that \nlttle design into her when they built her. After all, she was one of \nthe few suvivors of the war. And her parent&#39;s designed her with the \nwar in mind.\n\nShe managed to find her tool box.  She started to make minor repairs \nto the beat up ship to make herself more comfortable. After all, she \nhad no idea of how long she would be there.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
