Once on the ground, it was aparent that the bad condition of\nthe bridge was not and isolated condition.  The large cargo room,\nwhich had its enterance right off the hallway near the bottom of the\nladder, was littered with debris, empty and full cargo containers, and\nmiscelanous pot holes, burn marks, and other signs of some sort of\nbattle or severe turbulence.\n\nAfter a quick glance around with a night vision scope, they decided\nthe room was empty and not worth investigating.  They turned and made\ntheir way down the relatively wide corridor toward the holding cells\nand the warden&#39;s office.\n\nThe emergency lights illuminated the warden&#39;s room, which was located\nat the end of the hallway, though  these lights did little to lighten\nthe room.  Immediately upon entering, they noticed a large shadowy\nfigure in the corner of the room by one of the cells.\n\n&quot;You there!&quot; shouted the captain suddenly, raising his weapon.  &quot;Name yourself!&quot;\n\nThe figure tuned around with loud echoing footsteps and slowly approached them.\n\nOn 3/13/07, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; As they prepared to go down into the lower decks of the ship, the Captain\n&gt; looked around the bridge to make sure that he hadn&#39;t missed an obvious\n&gt; problems.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I was unconscious right before that little scare... I don&#39;t remember how it\n&gt; happened.&quot; he said as he kicked around some of the debris that covered the\n&gt; floor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Little scare?&quot; stated Cyphia incredulously.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Right, I guess it&#39;s not so little when your ship collides with an orbital\n&gt; station...&quot; he said, moving to the window and looking at the distant station\n&gt; with a big gaping hole along one side.  &quot;I just hope the ship&#39;s in better\n&gt; condition than that station...  I hope no one got hurt....&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;......um...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What is it?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There&#39;s someone else who&#39;s offline here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmm?&quot; he grunted, moving over to help pull the debris off of the buried\n&gt; crewman.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pulling back the debris, they recognised the form of the ship&#39;s pilot:\n&gt; Betaspiel.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;He didn&#39;t come online like we did.... that&#39;s odd.&quot; said Cyphia after a long\n&gt; period of silence.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I would say the best thing to do would be to get him to the CR in my\n&gt; quarters, however that reactor is offline.  I&#39;m not sure what we can do for\n&gt; him right now...&quot; he stated sadly.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry friend, we will be back for\n&gt; you shortly.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They both stood up.  The Captain looked around the room to make sure there\n&gt; wasn&#39;t anyone else unconscious that he might have missed.  After he was\n&gt; fully satisfied that he had searched the entire room, they proceeded to the\n&gt; door.\n&gt;\n&gt; Out of habit, the Captain walked over the security panel next to the door\n&gt; and check to see that there was no one waiting on the other side of the\n&gt; door.  A second later he pushed a button and the door slowly opened.  Once\n&gt; on the other side, it closed and locked.\n&gt;\n&gt; The hallway was dimly lit by the auxiliary power system.  The eery dim\n&gt; orange-colored light made him feel uneasy as he couldn&#39;t tell what might be\n&gt; lurking in the shadows.  They stayed close together as they made their way\n&gt; down to the access ladder, which lead to the lower decks.\n&gt;\n&gt; (To Be Continued)\n&gt;\n&gt; On 2/25/07, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Proximity alarms began to sound as the ship moved dangerously close to the\n&gt; &gt; orbital factory.  On the piloting console, Cyphia managed to plot a course\n&gt; &gt; that looked like it would get them away from the factory without pulling\n&gt; &gt; them further into the planet&#39;s gravitation pull.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rerouting the last of the power to the engines now.  That&#39;s all I can\n&gt; &gt; give you.&quot; shouted the Captain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The factory grew larger and larger as they moved closer to it until it\n&gt; &gt; took up the entire view from the bridge windows.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The engines appear to be miss-calibrated by several degrees.  I can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; keep them on course!&quot; said Cyphia in a panic-stricken voice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Try your best!  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much we can do about that now!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; replied the Captain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The ship accelerated toward the factory and began turning down and away.\n&gt; &gt; A few seconds later there was an incredible scraping noise as the lower\n&gt; port\n&gt; &gt; side of the ship scraped across the side of the factory.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; More alarms blared as they pulled away from the factory.  Debris could be\n&gt; &gt; seen spilling out of the ruptured side of the factory, the captain\n&gt; wondered\n&gt; &gt; what the damage to his ship was.  He hoped that the armor on the side of\n&gt; &gt; the ship spared them from any serious structural damage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What&#39;s going on!?!? screamed a voice over the radio.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It took the captain a moment to realise that the voice over the radio was\n&gt; &gt; actually coming from on board his ship.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This is the captain, who is this?&quot; he asked.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Captain!  This is Tigon.  It&#39;s dark as hell down here and then I hear\n&gt; &gt; that!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, unfortunately we just experienced a collision.  I don&#39;t really know\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s going on, but as soon as we establish a safe orbit, we&#39;ll turn\n&gt; power\n&gt; &gt; back on down there and come down to assist.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Great.... where&#39;d I put my flashlight...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The radio cut out and the captain turned his attention to the pilot.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We lost one of our thrusters in that collision, I&#39;m unsure of its\n&gt; &gt; condition.  Fortunately we don&#39;t need that thruster to achieve orbit.&quot; she\n&gt; &gt; said.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was a couple minutes of silence as both of them watched the screen.\n&gt; &gt; Then the ship moved into a stable orbit and the lines on the screen turned\n&gt; &gt; green.  She put the ship on auto pilot again and set some alarms in case\n&gt; &gt; anything changed.  The captain went back and switched the power systems\n&gt; back\n&gt; &gt; to default.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Looks like the reactor went offline.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What???&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, we&#39;re going to need to start it back up before we run out of\n&gt; &gt; emergency power.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If it isn&#39;t one thing, its another...&quot; said Cyphia in a very tired voice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (To Be Continued)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 2/19/07, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turning on the holotable, the position of the ship and all nearby\n&gt; &gt; &gt; objects was now clear.  The ship was going to crash if they didn&#39;t do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something fast.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Going over to the power supply panel he was surprised to see that it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fully operational.  He couldn&#39;t remember the last time it was\n&gt; functioning,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but here it was.  He was even more surprised to see that almost all\n&gt; major\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power grids were operational.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Then why are we crashing???&quot; he shouted to himself angrily.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cyphia glanced over from her piloting station.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You should divert the power from the prison ward and cargo sections.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she said, almost sounding like she was the one in command.  The captain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t seem to mind though.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Wont the prisoners get out if we turn off the power to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forcefields?  We don&#39;t know who&#39;s down there, we may be condemning them\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their deaths.&quot; he said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;If we crash, we&#39;ll have much bigger problems to deal with.  It looks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like security partitions are down in most the prison sections.  I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think most of them will be able to escape.  We don&#39;t have any partitions\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the holding cell area though.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The captain typed a few things on the control panel and a loud power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sound could be heard as the engines grew stronger.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Parts of the steering control seem to be offline, but judging by the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; computer, we have about a 70% of getting back in orbit now...&quot; she said,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unconvincingly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Better than 0%.... and other ideas to boost the power?&quot; he asked.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She didn&#39;t respond, because she was looking out one of the small windows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the bridge.  He walked behind her and looked out the window too.  A\n&gt; large\n&gt; &gt; &gt; orbital factory was about 80 nano-kliks away from the front of the ship.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The path the computer has charted for us to get back into orbit goes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inside the safety margin of that orbital... there&#39;s a chance we might\n&gt; hit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;If the only alternative is crashing.  I think we&#39;re going to have to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take the risk.  Besides, as long as we just brush the surface of that\n&gt; thing,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we shouldn&#39;t sustain any serious damage.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
