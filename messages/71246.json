If she had learned anything from \nher brother, it was how to put up a brave face, and do the things that you \nwere afraid to do no matter if you knew the outcome or not.\n\n&quot;Lord Elder, sir, you&#39;re right too, I know what I gotta do, for my brother&#39;s \nsake.  I - really should try ta talk ta Legacy about all this, and get his \nside of the story.  Ohh boy, here it goes, Courage 101 in session.&quot;\n\nShe now walks off to find Legacy and by intuition, finds him readilly. Being \nas small as she was, what she was about to do, would take every ounce of \nbravory in her tiny spark. To be sure that she was at eye level with Legacy, \nso she didn&#39;t need to crane her neck, she finds the highest point in the \nroom, climbs on it, and looks to him as if she were about to talk to Tucson \npersonally.\n\n&quot;Legacy, if it&#39;s okay, could - we talk for a little while?&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, now that he was alone with Talon, Tucson had now loosened up \nquite a bit, with his usually playful smile upon his face, as Talon envites \nhim to take a walk.\n\n&quot;How can I refuse your invitation?  Of course, I&#39;d like that very much, \nTalon.  In fact, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you something for the longest \ntime, and this seems like the perfect opportunity to ask you. But first.. \nJust so we&#39;re not interrupted...&quot;\n\nHe types in a code to close the doors, to allow them a little privacy.\nOnce hearing them shut, he smiles to Talon, and gently takes her hands.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve seen how happy it has made Rodimus to have Nightlight in his life and \nnow, I see how happy it is to have you in mine.&quot;\n\nHe kneels on one knee.\n\n&quot; Talon, will you do me the honor of being my companion for all eternity?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor/nightlight/Elita/Windlord/Kup/Talon\n&gt;\n&gt; Nighlight Smiled and squeezed Rodimus&#39;s hand while she lay down, she was\n&gt; getting better and with more energy with every second that passed &quot;ELita?,\n&gt; where is she? how is she?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita waved her little tail when she hear her mom calling her, she was\n&gt; impatient to go and give her a big hug, but she knew that she had to wait\n&gt; till her dad and Perceptor decided that it was time\n&gt;\n&gt; *******************************\n&gt; Kup watched the scene, letting the couple have time together.

Two male figure watched the scene in a corritor without disturb:\n&gt; &gt; Kup\n&gt; &gt; and windlord .\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus just sat there as holding his darling wife as slowly energy\n&gt; began to fill her systems. &quot;Take it easy.&quot; He said to her as he gently\n&gt; tried to allow her to lay back and rest. &quot;We have so many things to\n&gt; catch up on so many things to do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; For the moment work was forgotten, all other cares and concerns were\n&gt; put to the side as he sat there and looked at Nightlight just so happy\n&gt; that she was alive again with her full memories.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, things were looking good.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kup had a wide smile in his face and Windlord looked more serious, still\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; remember all the pain that hydras forced him to do... Or more accurately\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; willing did as Predacon\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor laughted quietly and said &quot;If you want to do that not know\n&gt; &gt; LEgacy&#39;s faction, what would you do with me that still I&#39;m a predacon?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; then he smirked, and stated to observe the reacion of Nightlight and\n&gt; &gt; smiled\n&gt; &gt; &quot;She seems to be totally healed and with no psicological damage...\n&gt; &gt; Amazing&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside Leo II walked up and through the glass. &quot;It seems we have\n&gt; cause to celebrate.&quot; He said.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And so many things to think about.&quot; Torca said causing Leo II to look at\n&gt; him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s why I came back.&quot; Torca said in response to the look.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both he and Leo had just come out of the recharging chambers and\n&gt; looked as if they had just walked off the assembly line.\n&gt;\n&gt; Leo II nodded, &quot;Yes I know.&quot; He looked saddened and then looked back\n&gt; at Rodimus through the glass again. &quot;There are going to be some hard\n&gt; choices to make.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar winces with a sheepish look on his face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ooops, I - didn&#39;t hear ya comming.. Okay, okay, so yeah, I&#39;m rankn&#39; on\n&gt; &gt; &#39;em\n&gt; &gt; my bad. But seriously, okay, Legacy works well in battles but his social\n&gt; &gt; skills, leave lots ta be desired.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot shrugs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m staying out of this. I&#39;m not the one who brought up the counting\n&gt; &gt; thing.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride nudges Uproar.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nice going, open mouth insert paw.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar shrugs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Well, it&#39;s kinda true. Every time we try ta ask &#39;em a question we get\n&gt; &gt; blown off.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Yeah, that part is kind of right. He&#39;s not exactly the most sociable\n&gt; &gt; part, and nothing against him but, he is treading on thin ice with \n&gt; &gt; Tucson\n&gt; &gt; sir, and I really think someone should talk to Tucson before he blows \n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; own stack. I can see it in my brother&#39;s face, there&#39;s an air about him\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; seems troubling. One of these days a real fight between them will break\n&gt; &gt; out\n&gt; &gt; and there may be no way ta stop it. I tried talking to Tucson but he&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; stubborn as Ratchet in that respect. So, how do we hold the peace with\n&gt; &gt; both\n&gt; &gt; of them, because I&#39;d really like ta know that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Straightshot, Uproar, Quickstride and Perceptor talked Lord Elder\n&gt; stopped but kept his back to them a smile blooming across his face. As\n&gt; they talked about what they truly thought of Legacy and his\n&gt; relationship with Tuscon Elder nodded and turned his face now more\n&gt; somber and sober.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You are right.&quot; He said as he walked back towards them. &quot;I had\n&gt; trouble getting to know Legacy, even though it was just me and him\n&gt; guarding the Ark together for a while.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Elder shrugged, &quot;Heck, sometimes I STILL feel like I don&#39;t know him\n&gt; well.&quot; He glanced at each of them. &quot;But maybe we can all try a little\n&gt; harder.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing back in the direction of where Tuscon was Elder nodded\n&gt; solemnly. &quot;I will see if I can talk with Tuscon.&quot; He looked back at\n&gt; the others. &quot;If they got into it I don&#39;t know who would win the\n&gt; battle, but I also feel they it would not be good . . . for any of\n&gt; us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The would be a Prime problem&quot;commended dryly the Predacon\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Elder looked back at the others, a smile coming back on his face.\n&gt; &quot;Perhaps you guys should take the time to get to know Perceptor a\n&gt; little better. After all, up until now we have only known him an\n&gt; adversary.&quot; Lord Elder gestured at Perceptor with a friendly shooing\n&gt; motion.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I will, in the mean time go and have a talk with Tuscon.&quot; Elder\n&gt; turned to walk away.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
