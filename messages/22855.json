There was something going on. Just as he asked what \nit \n&gt; was, Dark Mouse walked out of him. He glowered a little, and \ndecided \n&gt; to wait for her to return. He sat down in the commander&#39;s chair in \n&gt; the bridge. He waited for minutes, but his patience was thin.\n&gt; \n&gt; He jumped up and walked down to Dark Mouse&#39;s location, to someone&#39;s \n&gt; quarters. He leaned up against the frame of the door with his hip, \n&gt; glaring with his bright crimson optics.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey! Ya wanna fill me in or not?&quot; he said over to her.\n\n\n"}}
