A look of shock and sheer annoyance floods his face.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Yet before anything else he looks to Cyclonus and the others before=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; addressing Rodimus.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Excuse us for a moment.  =\r\nWait here, we&#39;ll be right back.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; With that he sharply tur=\r\nns to land quickly on the ground and does so on all&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fours with a s=\r\nolid thud.  Ground debris dances beneath him due to the impact&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as =\r\nhe swiftly gets into robot mode , not waiting for Rodimus to dismount.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Normally he would not have done so but it was clear he was less than&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; impressed with his comment.  He stands firmly with an angry express=\r\nion on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; his faceplate.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I am not thrilled to be =\r\ndoing this myself but there are times when we ALL&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; must do things w=\r\ne dislike doing.  I thought you might have enough integrity&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to und=\r\nerstand our situation.  Apparently I was wrong.  After everything I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; went through to bring you back safely, and THAT IS HOW YOU RETURN THE&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; FAVOR!?   BY DIRESPECTING CYCLONUS YOU DISRESPECT ME! &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; He takes a moment to cool off his overheated temper. He replies to Win=\r\ng&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Caliber in the mean time.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Of course, please =\r\nretain a defense force at the Ark by all means. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He turn=\r\ns back to Rodimus.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll leave it up to you to decide wh=\r\nat you want to do.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; His expression remains curt while wit=\r\nh Rodimus.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs TUSCON spoke the expression on =\r\nhis face darkened as he crossed his&lt;br&gt;\narms over his chest, his optics smo=\r\nldering with repressed anger and&lt;br&gt;\nheat. There was no flinching from RODI=\r\nMUS, no stepping back and most&lt;br&gt;\ncertainly no fear.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;What you di=\r\nd?&quot; RODIMUS said in low tones that would not carry over to&lt;br&gt;\nthe Predacon=\r\ns, but his words were fierc, obviously his own temper&lt;br&gt;\nfinally about to =\r\nexplode as well. The look on his face was one of&lt;br&gt;\ndisbelief.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Y=\r\nou&#39;re going to try holding that over my head?&quot; There was a shake of&lt;br&gt;\nhis=\r\n head. &quot;I had to live with these *Predacons*&quot; RODIMUS spit out the&lt;br&gt;\nword=\r\n &#39;Predacon&#39; like a curse. &quot;And they changed me into a monster!&lt;br&gt;\nThey cap=\r\ntured my wife and had me hold her while they tried to change&lt;br&gt;\nher! I was=\r\n about to loose my family because of them and you want me to&lt;br&gt;\nwork with =\r\nthem now, after all that?&quot; The incredulousness of it all was&lt;br&gt;\nin every w=\r\nord he spoke.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf TUSCON thought RODIMUS was a shrinking wall flowe=\r\nr and would cave&lt;br&gt;\nin he was mistaken.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRODIMUS breathed in deep,=\r\n it had been a while since his own temper had&lt;br&gt;\ncome out, and yet once it=\r\n did, it felt good - he had spent so much&lt;br&gt;\ntime having to reign it in.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;We have *both* sacrificed to save others many times&quot; RODIMUS said =\r\nin&lt;br&gt;\na hard whisper. &quot;And for you to try to hold that over my head . . . =\r\nto&lt;br&gt;\ntry and guilt me into doing something like that . . . that is beneat=\r\nh&lt;br&gt;\nall of us and I thought you as well.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTurning away from TUSC=\r\nON he started to stalk towards the Dinosaurs&lt;br&gt;\nRODIMUS&#39; whole frame rigid=\r\n, it would be some time for him to calm down&lt;br&gt;\nas well. &quot;We will talk abo=\r\nut this later Tuscon, for now we have to&lt;br&gt;\nfinish what you have started.&quot;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt the same time LEO PRIME&#39;s voice came back over the comlink, &quot;I=\r\n will&lt;br&gt;\nsend the Fuzors to you. They should be there in a couple of hours=\r\n.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nThere was a pause from LEO, &quot;But I need to know what you&#39;re trying t=\r\no&lt;br&gt;\ndo. Working with the Predacons is a dangerous business.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Meanwhile, Straight Shot&#39;s beacon begins to flash a little bit faster as&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; Waspinator continues his course.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s it Was=\r\npinator!  You&#39;re on target!  Keep on a northward track, my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; signal =\r\nis getting really strong now.  Scourge, be ready with the sweeps!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nIt&#39;s only a matter of time before we reach our target!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; B=\r\nelow everyone, Night Shift now makes it into the forest and spots&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nWaspinator with Straight Shot in tow.  Having got the memo, he follows them=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; from below.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hey, thought ya might need backup=\r\n! &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot picks up on Night Shift but also Elita.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; WHAT THE PIT ARE YA DOING BRINGING ELITA INTO THIS!?  =\r\nARE YOU OUT OF YOUR&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; PROCESSOR?!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift rep=\r\nlies sheepishly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I know, I&#39;m in trouble.  But I couldn&#39;t=\r\n leave her alone without protection.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Besides, she has ta learn how=\r\n ta take on a challenge at some point, and now&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is a good a time as=\r\n any ta start teaching her.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot sighs and shru=\r\ngs it off.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Okay if you say so.  Just don&#39;t let Rodimus =\r\nfind out.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; She turns to Waspinator.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; S=\r\norry about that, I had to reply to Nightshift.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; With plan=\r\ns moving forward, everyone puts their minds on what needs to be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; do=\r\nne.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWAPINATOR contiues to fly, his wings buzz=\r\ning as he holds himself and&lt;br&gt;\nSTRAIGHT SHOT in the air. &quot;What does arrow =\r\nbot think she has located?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\ncame his response as he flew onward.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&quot;Yes indeed.&quot; SCOURGE said as he flew up next to them. &quot;I don&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\nreme=\r\nmber any signal out there. Perhaps the little bit is leading us&lt;br&gt;\ninto a =\r\ntrap?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe other sweeps fan out again as NIGHTSHIFT showed up bene=\r\nath them.&lt;br&gt;\nThere was a chuckle from SCOURGE, &quot;And I think I smell a youn=\r\ng and&lt;br&gt;\ntender Maximal down there.&quot; He chuckled again. &quot;And they are not&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nsuppose to be here . . . nice!&quot; There was a chuckle as he banked off&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nagain to sweep around.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSCOURGE sent HYDRAS a short secret messag=\r\ne, &quot;Something small and&lt;br&gt;\nprecious belonging to Rodimus is here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPreston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end gro=\r\nup email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-81--314260675--\r\n\n"}}
