But now we gotta decide\n&gt; how we&#39;re gonna \n&gt; elect three people. Do you guys want to just take\n&gt; the people with the \n&gt; three highest votes or make a new poll each time\n&gt; electing one person \n&gt; at a time, or something else? I&#39;m open to ideas.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
