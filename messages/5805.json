He\nwaited until she was close sped up a little and called\nout, &quot;Maximize.&quot;The cry wasn&#39;t necessary but it fealt proper. A\nbattle cry that brought all the different animals in the Maximal army\ntogether. The wolf became bot again, turned and grabbed her talons,\npulling her down. &quot;Lesson one, make your prey come to your\nstrengths.&quot; With those last words Lunarpine transformed back to wolf\nand started in the other direction.&quot;By the way, you&#39;re still it.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
