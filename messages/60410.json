He landed hard and pulled out two crystal swords. &quot;Lets go robo scum, ive killed bigger and badder evils than you in my day.&quot; He struck his swords togeather and sparks flew.\n&gt; Necross/ Splattercannon:\n&gt; \n&gt; Necross jumped out of the tree, landed and approached Cryaltron.  He \n&gt; brought his right arm up and opened up with a volley og missiles, \n&gt; followed with a blast of his acid blaster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Splattercannon turned and focused now on Blackfang.  He fired bursts \n&gt; of his gatling rifle, hoping to catch the Maximal off guard.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, aerosmith4e@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Cryaltron saw the shots and detected maximal signatures. &quot;Over \n&gt; there!&quot; He blasted off towards the shooting and shot off his crystal \n&gt; missles and plain crystals that would skewer anything it penetrated \n&gt; on the opposing bots.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
