She  looked at Cyber Claw,&quot;I would imagine \nthat&#39;s Aracnia now.&quot;  She then heard Aracnia&#39;s voice. &quot;Greetings \nBlack Aracnia.  You are welcome here.&quot;  She looked at Destructor. &quot;Go \nand tell the others that we will be in the meeting room near the \nbridge discussing matters.&quot;  she motioned for Cyber Claw and Aracnia \nto follow her.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Aracnia lookes over the damaged Inferno. He was a \nmess.....definetly \n&gt; needed a CR chamber. At the moment she was arriving at Kitkats, or \nthe PACK&#39;s \n&gt; base, in a small transport. She found Inferno laying the ground in \nstasis. \n&gt; For now he would have to remain inside the vessle.\n&gt;     The ship soared just above the treetops, scattering birds and \nanimals \n&gt; alike. In the distance she could see the base, or cave, as it would \nseem. She \n&gt; typed the landing protocols in and set the ship down 30 meters from \nthe \n&gt; entrance. Aracnia exited and began to walk to the entrace, turning \nto raise \n&gt; shileds on the transport.\n&gt;     The entrance was empty, quite suspicious, but not uncommon in \nthese days. \n&gt; The two metal doors stood silent as she stood before them. Looking, \nshe saw a \n&gt; panel and pushed a button, an intercom.\n&gt;     &quot;Commander Black Aracnia, of the Predacon Forces, wishes to \nspeak with \n&gt; Commander Kitkat. Please acknowledge.&quot; She said cooly, not letting \nher temper \n&gt; get the better of her.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Paralysis, Tarantulas, Aerostreak, Tankkor, and Rampage \nremained at the \n&gt; ship, as did Quickstrike. They were going through routines and \nkeeping the \n&gt; ship safe. It needed a lot of maintenence, but if Kitkats troops \nmoved in \n&gt; there would be no problem. \n&gt;     That was the question after all.....where were the two groups \ngoing to \n&gt; stay? Together at one base, or divided at two? Aracnia tried the \ndivided \n&gt; part, and it failed. But Kitkat seemed to be a better leader, so it \nmight \n&gt; work.\n&gt;     &quot;Computer, locate Black Aracnia.&quot; Tarantulas said. He was in \nthe dark \n&gt; bowles of the Predacon Cruiser. It was rusty, deserted, and scary. \nThe \n&gt; bravest Predacon wouldnt even go in there. Thats why Tarantulas \nliked it so \n&gt; much.....it was his own little nest of terror. \n&gt;     Suspended above, amongst the pipes and iron works, were the \nbodies of \n&gt; small and large animals he had eaten and left to rot. Parts of a \nfew \n&gt; mainenence bots scattered the web too, he had eaten those when the \nanimals \n&gt; had become scarce.\n&gt;     The computer responded, &quot;Commander Black Aracnia is outside the \nships \n&gt; scanning range.&quot; \n&gt;     Tarantulas rubbed his hairy palms together. That ment she was \nat the \n&gt; meeting. And Quickstrike, he beloved knight in mismatched armor, \nwas asleep. \n&gt; The spider hated Quickstrike. He had programmed Black Aracnia long \nago to be \n&gt; his mate.....now she was in love with Quickstrike. Tarantulas \nwouldnt stand \n&gt; for it, not much longer anyhow. Revenge would be sweet....if he \ncould only \n&gt; muster up a plan to do so. The witch was pregnant, prehaps he could \nuse it \n&gt; agianst her, somehow.\n&gt;     He transformed into robot mode and left his sanctuary. Entering \nthe main \n&gt; corridor he ran into the ever moody Rampage. The self appointed \nruler of the \n&gt; Predacons when Aracnia was gone. He was a tyrant, he would make \nMegatron \n&gt; proud.\n&gt;     &quot;Where have you been, insect? The ships computer diagnostic \nwont run \n&gt; itself!&quot; He said, narrowing his already evil looking optics at the \nscientist. \n&gt; Rampage was alot stranger than Tarantulas, and he thought he was \nalot smarter.\n&gt;     Tarantulas pushed past him and went into the bridge. He would \nwork, for \n&gt; now. When this little merger was complete, Megatron dead, Hell \nBeast \n&gt; banished, he would step out of hiding.....he wold have his revenge \non all of \n&gt; them.\n\n\n"}}
