Symphony was not\nused to going into battle, and therefore had always been separate from his\nbrothers Composer and Orchestra as they went into wars long ago.  Composer\nwas a top strategist and even lead squads sometimes.  Orchestra was a\nstealthy covert ops agent, always uncovering even the most hidden\ninformation.  But Symphony had yet to find any skill in himself.  But he had\nto prove he had some fighting strength!  He wouldn&#39;t let his peaceful ways\nget in the way of being accepted into a war faction.\n\n        &quot;Here I come!!!&quot; He yelled, running after Kluster into the battle.\n\n         Symphony pulled out his machine gun and fired 22 shots at Kluster&#39;s\ntarget, Reflector.\n\n\n"}}
