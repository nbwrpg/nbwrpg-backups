Although firing wildly Tuscon still manages to hit one of\n&gt; the approaching insectoid troops, causing it to stall for a moment.\n&gt; However as it was one of Tuscon&#39;s comparatively smaller weapons it was\n&gt; not enough to stop it completely, although the creature&#39;s armor is\n&gt; burnt and dented from the impact!.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Insect Trooper #2 is Hit By Tuscon] - Insect Trooper is now Moderately \n&gt; damaged]\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We are the Horde.&quot; the troopers say in unison, &quot;Your energon will\n&gt; only feed us and your technological distinctiveness will be added to\n&gt; our own.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They continue forward, all of them several meters in front of Tuscon.\n&gt; With uncanny precision, and in unison they raise their scorpion-like\n&gt; tails and unleash their relentless firepower on Tuscon as the group\n&gt; rides inside or on top, for the moment safe from their onslaught.\n&gt;\n&gt; Fortunately most of the shots either miss, or bounce harmlessly off of\n&gt; his armor.
