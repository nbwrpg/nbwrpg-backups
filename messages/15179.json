We need a leader\n&gt; right now.  KitKat said for us to join the Allience.  I agree with\n&gt; her.  It would give us reenforsements for a time and give us a safe\n&gt; place to stay for a while.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked down and heard KitKat speak. &quot;Terrosaur?  You want\n&gt; Terrorsaur to lead this group?&quot;  She closed her eyes and shook her\n&gt; head. She then looked up at the others.  &quot;Well, you heard her guys. I\n&gt; guess Terrorsaur is leading us for now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked over and put her arms around Dollen&#39;s waist.  She looked\n&gt; at\n&gt; Terrorsaur. &quot;I guess your it, Leader.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She smiled at Dollen and kissed his cheek,&quot;Well, at least we aren&#39;t\n&gt; under attack.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
