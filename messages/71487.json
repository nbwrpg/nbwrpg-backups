Quickstri=\r\nde will head the construction of the wind\n&gt; and hydro turbines.  Anyone who=\r\n wishes to be on that team, report to\n&gt; Quickstride for instruction.   As f=\r\nor Cheetor, I&#39;m afraid he has yet to be\n&gt; found.  Nightshift and Rattrap di=\r\nd all they could to search for him, and I\n&gt; do believe Nightshift is severe=\r\nly damaged and will need immediate repairs.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME nodded, =93Q=\r\nuickstride will head that team. Coordinate with\nLegacy on that as well. He =\r\nis primarily the Ark=92s guardian and has\nbeen effecting repairs for some t=\r\nime. His knowledge of science and\ngeneral engineering seems to be off the c=\r\nharts.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot sits up and looks to Leo Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;He&#39;s=\r\n not listening to me.  Maybe he&#39;ll listen to you.  He&#39;s already taken\n&gt; mor=\r\ne of his share of hard hits and if he thinks he&#39;s gonna go out there and\n&gt; =\r\ndo it all again, he&#39;s flipped a microchip or two. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson directs his =\r\nattention over to Straight Shot.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I know, I know, you have every right=\r\n to not approve of my actions, but I\n&gt; failed this faction once, I will not=\r\n fail it again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot swallows hard as a tear trickles down he=\r\nr right eye.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No, what happened back then wasn&#39;t your fault.  None of =\r\nit was.  Leo he&#39;s\n&gt; blaming himself for what happened to Rodimus and the ot=\r\nhers on himself.  He\n&gt; thinks that if he had just been a little more carefu=\r\nl, he could&#39;ve prevented\n&gt; Hydras from winning that battle.  But it wasn&#39;t =\r\nhis fault.  I was in his cab\n&gt; with him as an on board scout, looking out f=\r\nor possible ambush.  I saw\n&gt; someone in the skies far off behind us and I f=\r\nroze because he moved in\n&gt; really fast.  By the time Cyclonus moved in for =\r\nthe shot, I could barely say\n&gt; anything.  I was terrified.  Then that&#39;s whe=\r\nn it happened.  I don&#39;t remember\n&gt; too much after that but he was not the b=\r\not who failed the faction, I was.\n&gt; And there isn&#39;t a day that goes by with=\r\nout me being reminded of that costly\n&gt; error I made out on that battle fiel=\r\nd.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson moves over to his sister and puts a hand on her shoulder.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &quot; No, that was never your fault.  It was mine.  I should have never asked=\r\n\n&gt; you toventure out with me on such a dangerous mission.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then look=\r\ns to everyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Times are about to get difficult.  In order to win the=\r\n battle ahead we\n&gt; have to work together, and we need to remain strong.  We=\r\n will overcome as we\n&gt; have for centuries.  Freedom is the right for all se=\r\nntient beings.  Now let\n&gt; us win it, for this planet, for us and for Primus=\r\n.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere is a look from LEO PRIME as he watches the scene unfold. =\r\n=93You do\nlook like you need more time in the CR chamber before you can res=\r\nume\nfull duty status Tuscon.=94 LEO said soberly.\n\nLORD ELDER, who had just=\r\n walked into the room nodded as he walked\nstraight up the middle isle. =93Y=\r\nep, Tuscon is known for trying to push\nhimself too hard. If he balks too mu=\r\nch, perhaps I can get Santon over\nthere to give him a sedative.=94 ELDER po=\r\ninted at the bulky medic who\nwas sitting on the stage.\n\nAlthough LORD ELDER=\r\n was being a bit facetious SANTON nodded grimly as\nhe looked over at TUSCON=\r\n, =93Yes, rest would be the order of the door.\nAnd a few more hours in the =\r\nCR.=94\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson puts an arm around Talon with a playful smile on=\r\n his face.  It would\n&gt; be his only moment of light heartedness.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You&#39;r=\r\ne absolutely right, Talon but it&#39;s a shame that CR chambers are only\n&gt; desi=\r\ngned for one individual at a time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He wispers quietly with a cat like =\r\ngrin on his face.  He then turns to Leo\n&gt; Prime, with an attentive nod.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &quot;Nightshift and Rattrap were out looking for Cheetor together but, an\n&gt; un=\r\nknown insectile force attacked them and in an effort to elude them,\n&gt; Night=\r\nshift spun out and collided with something in the forest which caused\n&gt; ext=\r\nensive damage.  He should be in med bay now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap takes his seat.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late Wheels, I had ta help Ramulus get Nightshift inta the me=\r\nd\n&gt; bay.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s all right, I understand.  Now as far=\r\n as the escaped enemy forces,\n&gt; I&#39;d like to send Silverbolt with Kup to the=\r\n ship&#39;s parameter to see if you\n&gt; pick up on their signatures.  Once they&#39;v=\r\ne determined the path of the\n&gt; escaped predicons, I&#39;d like a full report an=\r\nd please, try not to take them\n&gt; on your own.  Call for backup the minute y=\r\nou find them.  I worry about all\n&gt; of you, and if Anything ever happened to=\r\n anyone of you, I&#39;d never forgive\n&gt; myself.  &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No one h=\r\nas the right to control what isn&#39;t theirs to govern.  Freedom is\n&gt; the righ=\r\nt of all sentient beings and the right of creatures who were born\n&gt; Natural=\r\nly to this planet.  Leo Prime, I vote we take care of the perpetrator\n&gt; tog=\r\nether.  He seems to need a taste of his own medicine.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME no=\r\ndded again, =93And perhaps this mech here.=94 He pointed to\nthe green mech =\r\nthat had the predacon IFF signal, =93Could help you with\nlocating the ship =\r\nand finding survivors.=94\n\nLooking back at TUSCON and then LORD ELDER as we=\r\nll as a few others LEO\nintoned. =93Does anyone have anything else to add be=\r\nfore I dismiss the\nmeeting?=94\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
