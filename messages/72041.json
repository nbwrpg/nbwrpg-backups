Of the things that never changed were that the spider could be always\n&gt; trusted to have his own agenda going on.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pausing, and then internally playing back, &quot;There was a different level of\n&gt; reverb in his internal communication.  There was a slight echo to it that\n&gt; was not within his normal vocalizer tone.  Someone else was in the room wtih\n&gt; him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing at SKY SHADOW as the two walked along, &quot;Can you ask the computer to\n&gt; tell us then who is with him at the moment?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTARANTULUS&#39; voice came over the radio to HYDRAS, &quot;I have just\nressurected another soldier down here.&quot; There was another cackle from\nTARANTULUS. &quot;She is ready for visitors now.&quot; He said with a touch of\nhumor.\n\nSKY SHADOW looked annoyed briefly and then nodded and smiled as he\nconsidered DINOBOT&#39;s suggestion. &quot;Computer.&quot; he said speaking outloud,\nobviously wanting HYDRAS and the rest to hear the results. &quot;How many\nindividuals are with unit TARANTULUS?&quot; he said with authority.\n\n&quot;Proccessing.&quot; The computer came back. &quot;There is one other individual\nwith Predacon unit Tarantulus.
