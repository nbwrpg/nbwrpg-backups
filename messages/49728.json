She kept the jet mode \nand gained the ability to turn herself into a rifle-like weapon \nuseable by other transformers - which may bring back memories for \nGalvie if he recollects his life as the original Megatron.  Now she&#39;s \ngained a beast form to boot.  (I&#39;m telling you this now because \nGalvie should know about his subordinates.)\n\nBIC: One stasis pod activates, going through the usual song-and-dance \nbefore opening to release a sleek jaguar.  The feline glances around, \nuncertain for a moment of her surroundings.  Seeing Galvatron, she \nsits on her haunches and speaks in her usual cooing voice (with an \nunderlying purr now added): &quot;Lord Galvatron; a pleasure to see you, \nas always.
