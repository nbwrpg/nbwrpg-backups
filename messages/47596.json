An insult to \neverything \n&gt; BW/BM stands for?  Laughable, for it&#39;s the other way around.  \nTransformer&#39;s \n&gt; came out as Roland, Code, or whatever new name has pointed out, 12 \nyears \n&gt; before BW squirmed its way onto the scene.  Hell, BW was to cheap \nto get \n&gt; Frank Welker to do the original Megatron&#39;s voice for the thing on \nthe golden \n&gt; disk.  It&#39;s only good points were Larry DiTillo and Bob Forward, \nboth having \n&gt; worked on He-Man which was a kick ass cartoon (Secret of the Sword \nbaby, \n&gt; yeah!).\n&gt; \n&gt; Staying on subject, Transformers: The Movie was an awesome movie.  \nI won&#39;t \n&gt; say it was perfect, it was pretty cheesy how they slipped in the \ngay new \n&gt; Autobots.  But that&#39;s what happens when it&#39;s governed by toy \nsales.  Anyway, \n&gt; the tactic with the ship was smart and served its purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; They were trying to get the Dinobots in there because they wanted \nto get the \n&gt; hell out of there, something about a new, fully-powered fleet of \nDecepticon \n&gt; fighters jumping on their tired afts.  And the Dinobots are stupid, \nwhat do \n&gt; you expect?  Grimlock was a genius at one point in the third \nseason, but \n&gt; that&#39;s another subject for another time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why were they celebrating at the end?  How many stupid questions do \nyou have? \n&gt;  They saved the planet from a giant MONSTER named Unicron that was \ngoing to \n&gt; obliterate the planet and everything else in the Universe.  That \nwould be \n&gt; worth being happy about, though it was stupid to say it was the end \nof the \n&gt; Third Cybertronian War, I&#39;ll give ya that.  But they&#39;re Autobots, \nwhaddaya \n&gt; expect?  And in G1 the Matrix wasn&#39;t a gay Heaven like in BM, it \nwas just a \n&gt; device that held the essences of all the past Autobot leaders, \nalthough the \n&gt; Matrix of Leadership itself was stupid.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Why would you want Spike?  That&#39;s almost as bad as wanting that \nfairy Daniel \n&gt; or the iinfamous Wheelie?   See people, Dewboy is a PRIME example \nof what \n&gt; happens when people polluted with Bob Skir&#39;s sheisse watch G1.  \nThey \n&gt; amazingly forget that G1 came out about 20 years before BW and BM.  \nIdiocy.)\n&gt; \n&gt; -L.
