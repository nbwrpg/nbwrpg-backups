Looking down at the ocean they would sea a bright light \n=\r\npiercing \n&gt; the darkness of its depths as on the bottom the massive cannon =\r\n\nbuilt \n&gt; at its bottom crackles with energy as it charges, the ground arou=\r\nnd \n&gt; pulsing from the intense energy. At the tip of Greenland, a small \n&gt; =\r\noutpost manned by Hooligan also hums loudly as a large cannon, \npoints \n&gt; i=\r\nn the air, its tip glowing with energy. Off the coast of North \n&gt; america, =\r\na second large cannon exactly like the one in green land \n&gt; also hums as De=\r\nmonite stands by it watching over the cannon. The \n&gt; cannon also elevated s=\r\no its tip poiints into the sky at an angle. \n&gt; Finally a short distance awa=\r\ny from the alliance base, in the \n&gt; infecticon ship the oblivion, the top s=\r\neconds split open as a third \n&gt; cannon, also humming with a large energy ba=\r\nll at its tip rises out \nof \n&gt; it aiming at the sky. The three smaller cann=\r\nons all are \ntriangulated \n&gt; to hit the same point which the Infecticon Fur=\r\ny cannon also shall \n&gt; fire at as soon as they do. Inside the mid atlantic =\r\nbase, the \n&gt; mysterious robot turns to blight and frostbite, his optics glo=\r\nwing \na \n&gt; deep red.\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;Is the satelite and the cannons in posisti=\r\non?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Blight: &quot;Yes, we have also locked onto the target.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;E=\r\nxcellent, Frostbite, open a open transmission to every \n&gt; facility that is =\r\non this planet. Our might shall be demonstrated \nnow.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Frostbite nods =\r\nand soo a transmission is opened to every faction on \n&gt; the planet, the dar=\r\nk face of the mysterious bot on display.\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;Hello... today marks t=\r\nhe day in which new lines shall be \ndrawn \n&gt; on the battle field. I am offe=\r\nring an alliance to all who wish it, \n&gt; they can either ally with us and cr=\r\nush our enemies... or face our \n&gt; wrath. To demonstrate our power we are go=\r\ning to fire on a target we \n&gt; have selected. I hope to hear from some of yo=\r\nu soon over an \nalliance.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With those words a picture of Maximal city =\r\nis now shown alongside \nthe \n&gt; figures face.\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;Blight, fire on ta=\r\nrget.... Now!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Blight cackles a bit insanely as he presses a red butto=\r\nn, \nimmediately \n&gt; following that all three large cannons fire a large beam=\r\n all at the \n&gt; smaller dish of the Infecticon sattelite. The dish absorbs t=\r\nhe \nenergy \n&gt; and glows brightly. A moment later the ocean bubbles and the =\r\nentire \n&gt; Infecticon undersea base shakes violently as the massive cannon \n=\r\n&gt; launched a collosal beam through the ocean and into the sky, the \n&gt; entir=\r\ne beam lighting up the sky with a red and blue hue. In space \nthe \n&gt; colosa=\r\nl beam spirals and thins and strikes the smaller dish as \nwell, \n&gt; and afte=\r\nr 2 minutes it also has been absorbed. As soon as it does \nthe \n&gt; larged di=\r\nsh swivels and reposistions itself before as a titanic \nbeam \n&gt; is fired do=\r\nwn nearly blowing the satelite right out of its orbit. \n&gt; Above Maximal cit=\r\ny the sky gets extremely bright as the beam \nbarrels \n&gt; down towards it. A =\r\nsecond later the beam strikes the city, \nengulfing \n&gt; it... even if it had =\r\nshields and they were up, the beam would still \n&gt; liekly leave Maximal City=\r\n just short of being wiped off the map.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Any chars in there wont b=\r\ne killed unless the players want them \n&gt; to be. Although I would expect any=\r\n survivors to be damage badly.\n\n\n"}}
