They both landed at the same\ntime, safely.  A substance called Energon prevented them from remaining in\nrobot mode so pod scanners looked for the nearest organic creature to\ncreate a mode unaffected by energon.  Both scanners detected two very,\nvery, very large creatures flying ahead, just passing by.  The scanners\nindicated that these two creatures were gigantic and were aerial, but they\nhad nothing to protect themselves except for using their tails, wings and\nhead bashing.  So basically, these creatures had no offensive weapons, and\nwould be suitable for emergency and escape missions.  The two bots inside\nof the pods took these forms as their own. One of the pods opened up, and a\nfemale bot stepped out.  Her name was Hell Drak.  She looked around to see\nif there was any enemy bots.\n\n\t&quot;This world is strange yet somewhat beautiful,&quot; Hell Drak said, looking\naround in awe.  \n\n\t&quot;Brother!  Yoo hoo!  Brother!  We&#39;re here!&quot; Hell Drak shouted banging on\nthe other pod.  Out of the other pod, a male bot stepped out.  This bot was\nnamed Necromancer.\n\n\t&quot;Wow.  This world is beautiful.  So full of life.  I never knew such\ncreatures existed as the flying ones we saw.  We better get focused on\nlooking out for other bots,&quot; Necromancer said as he walked up to his\nsister.\n\n\n"}}
