With the added\n&gt; momentum of gravity, he was traveling to fast to be caught by them,\nwhile\n&gt; he was in the air. He hit the ground, and maneuvered gracefully (or was\n&gt; swerving because of bad driving) towards the main tree. Then when he got\n&gt; close to the roots, the car lifted itself into the air, and began\ntumbeling\n&gt; towards grounded again.\n\n\n"}}
