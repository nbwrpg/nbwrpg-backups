Just as he got to the point where he could see the\nbattle, but they couldn&#39;t see him, he remembered that he had no handheld\nweapons.  But then he also remebered, he did have built in body weapons! \nHis optical lasers were there, except they weren&#39;t very good for combat\nlike this.  But, his finger mini-missiles would do just fine!  His scanners\nshowed that the bot attacking the base was called Scattershot.  His\nscanners also showed two Maximals named Firearm and Rex trying to defend\nthe base.  Hakibuscon transformed, ran over and shot 3 finger missiles at\nScattershot and then ran over to Rex and Firearm.\n\n\t&quot;Look, don&#39;t ask any questions!  I am not a Maximal, I am not a Predacon\nand I&#39;m not part of the Alliance.  I am only trying to be a part of this\nwar, so I decided to help you out by saving your base.  This doesn&#39;t mean I\nam a Maximal though!&quot; Hakibuscon said quickly under his breath.\n\n\n"}}
