He witnesses \nSarge&#39;s death and \n&gt;   the arrival of the Vile Force.  He sees Gemini Dragon.  He sees \nRadistor \n&gt;   form.  He does not move.  His mind is filled with hatred.  His \nthoughts cloud \n&gt;   as he decides to go after Radistor where he believes Deemos is.  \nHe takes \n&gt;   flight and in midair separates the two halves of his bladed \nstaff.
