With a thrust\n&gt; &gt; of forc=\r\ne she began to open fire on Kup sending a rattling train of\n&gt; &gt; bullets in =\r\nhis direction!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the same time Talon attempted to race towards Tus=\r\ncon, however\n&gt; &gt; Skyshadow, the leader of the Fuzors stepped in the way, hi=\r\ns weapon\n&gt; &gt; cocked and ready to fire, &quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot; h=\r\ne said\n&gt; &gt; as he sneered at Talon, trying to kick and send the Maximal stum=\r\nbling\n&gt; &gt; back!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot and Nightshift had both shuffled thei=\r\nr way over to\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon, but now in addition to facing Hydras, they also f=\r\naced those\n&gt; &gt; with him: Insecticon, Bruticus-X, Iguanus, and also Inferno.=\r\n In reply\n&gt; &gt; to Hydras order to execute the Maximals, their optics had bri=\r\nghtened\n&gt; &gt; as they brought their weapons to bear and powered them up.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This is going to be fun!&quot; Insecticon said as he cackled.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Quit=\r\n your yackin&#39; till the job&#39;s done.&quot; Iguanus said as he aimed his\n&gt; &gt; weapon=\r\n, and like the rest opened fire!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile at the Black tower!\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Inside the walls the spider like Predacons continued their chase, the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ominous sounds of their metal legs hitting the walls creating a rapid\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; fire clicking sound as they pursued Rat Trap and Windlord. Four of\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nem came out of the shadows their bright multifaceted optics seemed\n&gt; &gt; almo=\r\nst hungry as they moved.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The chase took them over pipes and under a=\r\n bit of duct work, past a\n&gt; &gt; bulk head and down a long passage way deeper =\r\nand farther inside the\n&gt; &gt; wall. As they ran they could see the grillwork o=\r\nf small vents that\n&gt; &gt; gazed out into other rooms.

As he walked he\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; got a call from Perceptor . . .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I have an idea to let our fr=\r\niends escape BlackFortress area... and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; PErhaps reboot Nightlight, all=\r\ntough i dont know how much of her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; former self is retained&quot; said Perce=\r\nptor to Rodimus in a heavely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; encripted message&quot;But we have to let Tuc=\r\nson know, what Legacy&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sittuation really is and this has been an unf=\r\nortunate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; misunderstanding... He&#39;s loyal to us... so far I watched... =\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus nodded as he looked up at Uproar and Quickstride. &quot;It wou=\r\nld\n&gt; &gt; seem that Perceptor has vouched for Legacy. He said he has been loya=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt; all this time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He took a moment to glance around, putting Pe=\r\nrcpeptor on hold for a\n&gt; &gt; few moments prepared his plan.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This mis=\r\nsion is going to be dangerous.&quot; He said to Leo, Wing Caliber,\n&gt; &gt; Ramulus, =\r\nUproar and Quickstride. As Rodimus spoke, he kept his voice\n&gt; &gt; very low, a=\r\nlmost as if even here he was not sure if they could be seen\n&gt; &gt; or over hea=\r\nrd. He carefully held up a small device. &quot;But this is what\n&gt; &gt; I think will=\r\n get us in.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A Spark scrambler?&quot; Ramulus said. &quot;Where did you get =\r\nthat?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus smiled grimly, &quot;This was the one that Perceptor had =\r\ngiven me a\n&gt; &gt; while back. I had almost forgotten that I had it.&quot; He glance=\r\nd around\n&gt; &gt; for a second, and then continued. &quot;I believe I can modify this=\r\n thing\n&gt; &gt; to allow us to get past the shield.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Leo II just looked =\r\nat Rodimus, not sure what to make of what he was\n&gt; &gt; saying, but he was wil=\r\nling to listen.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What do you mean we can get in with that?&quot; Wing Ca=\r\nliber said,\n&gt; &gt; obviously mistrustful. &quot;It scrambles spark signatures not f=\r\norce\n&gt; &gt; fields.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus nodded grimly, &quot;Yes, but I believe that t=\r\nhe shield is still\n&gt; &gt; set to recognize certain spark signatures, it is jus=\r\nt being held in\n&gt; &gt; over ride mode right now.&quot; Rodimus pulled out one more =\r\ndevice, a small\n&gt; &gt; power converter. &quot;I believe I can disrupt the shield in=\r\n a small\n&gt; &gt; localized area, to create a doorway that would allow us to ent=\r\ner.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Leo II&#39;s optics brightened in recognition, &quot;I see. You can pla=\r\ny with\n&gt; &gt; the shield&#39;s spark recognition parameters.&quot; He smiled ruefully, =\r\n&quot;It\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t bring down the whole shield, but it would allow us to run\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; through before it closed on us again.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wing Caliber nodded as w=\r\nell, &quot;You do know the shield will adjust to it\n&gt; &gt; after that.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rod=\r\nimus nodded, &quot;Yes, but if this works as I plan, it will only have\n&gt; &gt; to wo=\r\nrk once.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wing Caliber and Leo II nodded in agreement.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mean=\r\nwhile inside the Ark itself\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor spoke into his radio . . .\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I need confirmation for my next step, I know how to create enough\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; havoc to Let Tucson and to others Scape but I need your permission.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was a short pause, and then Rodimus&#39; voice answered, &quot;Of cours=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor.

We&#39;re not the most brilliant of the maximals, but =\r\nwe know the basics.&quot; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- =\r\nIn &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yah=\r\noogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; On the Battle field!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; As Tuscon and Hydras face off,=\r\n the other Predacons around them got&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; antsy, each one fingering his=\r\n weapon and waving it, obviously wanting&lt;br&gt;&gt; to pull the trigger, but n=\r\none of them daring to until they got the&lt;br&gt;&gt; order from Hydras. The swe=\r\neps above continue to fly around, their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; probing beams watching the=\r\n Maximals and Autobots as they move around.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; And then Hydra=\r\ns spoke on the radio . . .&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; opening his comlink to all=\r\n Predacons and Decepticons&#39;s channels&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;EXECUTE THEM =\r\nALLL!!!!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; As Hydras and Tuscon once again clashed, t=\r\nhe Predacons eagerly reopen&lt;br&gt;&gt; the violence of the battle, unleashing =\r\nthe full force of their&lt;br&gt;&gt; firepower on the Maximals! Explosions rocke=\r\nd the ground as sadly each&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of the Maximals were out numbered, seve=\r\nral to one!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; One of Kup&#39;s blasts clips Phobia&#39;s win=\r\ng, &quot;BLAST YOU!&quot; she screams out&lt;br&gt;&gt; in pain as her wing tip s=\r\nmoked from the attack. She slowly circled in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the air, her flight n=\r\not quite as graceful as it once was.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;You&#39;re goin=\r\ng to pay for that!&quot; The crimson queen of fear said as an&lt;br&gt;&gt; omino=\r\nus click marked the sound of her autoguns engaging. With a thrust&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nof force she began to open fire on Kup sending a rattling train of&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nbullets in his direction!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; At the same time Talon attempted=\r\n to race towards Tuscon, however&lt;br&gt;&gt; Skyshadow, the leader of the Fuzor=\r\ns stepped in the way, his weapon&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cocked and ready to fire, &quot;W=\r\nhere do you think you&#39;re going?&quot; he said&lt;br&gt;&gt; as he sneered at =\r\nTalon, trying to kick and send the Maximal stumbling&lt;br&gt;&gt; back!&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; Straight Shot and Nightshift had both shuffled their way over to&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Tuscon, but now in addition to facing Hydras, they also faced those=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; with him: Insecticon, Bruticus-X, Iguanus, and also Inferno. In re=\r\nply&lt;br&gt;&gt; to Hydras order to execute the Maximals, their optics had brigh=\r\ntened&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as they brought their weapons to bear and powered them up.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;This is going to be fun!&quot; Insecticon said as he =\r\ncackled.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Quit your yackin&#39; till the job&#39;s do=\r\nne.&quot; Iguanus said as he aimed his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; weapon, and like the rest o=\r\npened fire!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Meanwhile at the Black tower!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n Inside the walls the spider like Predacons continued their chase, the&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; ominous sounds of their metal legs hitting the walls creating a rapid&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; fire clicking sound as they pursued Rat Trap and Windlord. Four of&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; them came out of the shadows their bright multifaceted optics seeme=\r\nd&lt;br&gt;&gt; almost hungry as they moved.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The chase took them=\r\n over pipes and under a bit of duct work, past a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; bulk head and dow=\r\nn a long passage way deeper and farther inside the&lt;br&gt;&gt; wall. As they ra=\r\nn they could see the grillwork of small vents that&lt;br&gt;&gt; gazed out into o=\r\nther rooms. Interestingly, one of them, as they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; approached it appe=\r\nared to be lit!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Outside the Ark!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus =\r\nnodded as they all moved out of sight of the Ark and moved&lt;br&gt;&gt; over und=\r\ner the cover of several large rocks and trees. As he walked he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; got=\r\n a call from Perceptor . . .&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I have an idea to =\r\nlet our friends escape BlackFortress area... and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; PErhaps reboo=\r\nt Nightlight, alltough i dont know how much of her&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; former self=\r\n is retained&quot; said Perceptor to Rodimus in a heavely&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; enc=\r\nripted message&quot;But we have to let Tucson know, what Legacy&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; sittuation really is and this has been an unfortunate&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nmisunderstanding... He&#39;s loyal to us... so far I watched... &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus nodded as he looked up at Uproar and Quickstride. &qu=\r\not;It would&lt;br&gt;&gt; seem that Perceptor has vouched for Legacy. He said he =\r\nhas been loyal&lt;br&gt;&gt; all this time.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; He took a mome=\r\nnt to glance around, putting Percpeptor on hold for a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; few moments =\r\nprepared his plan.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;This mission is going to be dange=\r\nrous.&quot; He said to Leo, Wing Caliber,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Ramulus, Uproar and Quick=\r\nstride. As Rodimus spoke, he kept his voice&lt;br&gt;&gt; very low, almost as if =\r\neven here he was not sure if they could be seen&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; or over heard. He =\r\ncarefully held up a small device. &quot;But this is what&lt;br&gt;&gt; I think wi=\r\nll get us in.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;A Spark scrambler?&quot; Ramulus=\r\n said. &quot;Where did you get that?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus smiled=\r\n grimly, &quot;This was the one that Perceptor had given me a&lt;br&gt;&gt; while=\r\n back. I had almost forgotten that I had it.&quot; He glanced around&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; for a second, and then continued. &quot;I believe I can modify this thing=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to allow us to get past the shield.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Leo II=\r\n just looked at Rodimus, not sure what to make of what he was&lt;br&gt;&gt; sayin=\r\ng, but he was willing to listen.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;What do you mean we=\r\n can get in with that?&quot; Wing Caliber said,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; obviously mistrust=\r\nful. &quot;It scrambles spark signatures not force&lt;br&gt;&gt; fields.&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus nodded grimly, &quot;Yes, but I believe that the shi=\r\neld is still&lt;br&gt;&gt; set to recognize certain spark signatures, it is just =\r\nbeing held in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; over ride mode right now.&quot; Rodimus pulled out o=\r\nne more device, a small&lt;br&gt;&gt; power converter. &quot;I believe I can disr=\r\nupt the shield in a small&lt;br&gt;&gt; localized area, to create a doorway that =\r\nwould allow us to enter.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Leo II&#39;s optics bright=\r\nened in recognition, &quot;I see. You can play with&lt;br&gt;&gt; the shield&#39;=\r\ns spark recognition parameters.&quot; He smiled ruefully, &quot;It&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nwouldn&#39;t bring down the whole shield, but it would allow us to run&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; through before it closed on us again.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Wing Cali=\r\nber nodded as well, &quot;You do know the shield will adjust to it&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nafter that.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus nodded, &quot;Yes, but if this w=\r\norks as I plan, it will only have&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to work once.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; Wing Caliber and Leo II nodded in agreement.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Meanwhil=\r\ne inside the Ark itself&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Perceptor spoke into his radio . .=\r\n .&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I need confirmation for my next step, I know how t=\r\no create enough&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; havoc to Let Tucson and to others Scape but I=\r\n need your permission.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; There was a short pause, and =\r\nthen Rodimus&#39; voice answered, &quot;Of course&lt;br&gt;&gt; Perceptor. What&#=\r\n39;s your plan?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Meanwhile little Elita, as she wond=\r\nered through the base picked up a&lt;br&gt;&gt; bit of noise and the sound of a v=\r\noice . . . a voice that was definitly&lt;br&gt;&gt; not Rodimus, or even anyone t=\r\nhat she recognized.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Preston&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;MIN-HEIGHT: 0px; COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--00221534d727ff180b049aeb0dd8--\r\n\n"}}
