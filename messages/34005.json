That was sufficient punishment for his lack to bring the two \nother Neo &#39;Cons online.  \n/FALL BACK/ his voice roared over the battlefield.  In fact, most of them \n(most of my chars) were already moving back, and were almost out of firing \nrange of the CF and vice versa.\n\nThe shots from Hot Rod struck and Unicron shook, slight pain building up but \nnot even close to enough to make him show pain.  He raised an arm, firing off \ntwo missiles down at Hot Rod.\n\n---\n\nTeufel raised his arms and fired two missiles to intercept the others.  His \nshoulder cannons then fired twenty shots from each, forty shots blasting \nthrough the debris, though some shots were deflected by shrapnel bits, the \nrest heading for Zardus.\n\n"}}
