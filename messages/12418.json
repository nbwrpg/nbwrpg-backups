He walked down the many \ncurving corridors of the Trypicon. It was much larger than the \nDarkside. Quickstrike spent several mega-cycles exploring. He walked \nthrough some corridors that he hadn&#39;t the chance to explore. He only \nmanaged to reconize at least two or more corridors. He learned the \npathway from the ramp by spark. \n\nHe went down another corridor, when he heard CyberShark&#39;s voice on \nhis comm-link. He stopped in his tracks, and listened. He wanted to \nfind out what he wanted, but something told him to play dead. \n\nBe quiet, he said to himself. Play dead, play dead, play dead. \nSomebody will get to him.\n\n\n"}}
