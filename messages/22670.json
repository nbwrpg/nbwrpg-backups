How can we just leave? I&#39;ll take care of that guy if he comes\nback.\n\nPerplex thought about how Trinity was hurt in the last battle. Then he\nthought about how Zeni was hurt.\n\nPerplex: Well, I guess we&#39;re going. Hold on a second.\n\nPerplex runs to the computer console, the main one.\n\nPertress: Perplex, you aren&#39;t really going to leave me, are you? (Remember,\neveryone can hear Pertress now)\n\nPerplex: No, but I am leaving, but I&#39;m taking you with me.\n\nPerplex opened up the computer and grabed Pertress&#39; chip.\n\nPerplex: Brace yourself.\n\nPerplex pulled the chip out.\n\nPerplex: I&#39;ll go and get some supplies, wait here!\n\nPerplex runs to the supply room, it was small but full. He opened himself up\nand took out alot of stuff, being careful not to break anything, but it\nstill hurt. He made a spot for and installed the chip into himself. He sat\non the floor and put himself back together. It took about 30 minutes.\n\nGramps: What&#39;s keeping him so long?\n\nPerplex activated Pertress&#39; program. Then he gathered up some supplies. He\nseen that he left mech fluid all over the floor, as well as his hands. he\ndecided to leave it. He came back and set a bunch of supplies on the floor.\n\nPerplex: There you go!\n\nPerplex talked out of breath and wiped mech fluid from himself.\n\nPerplex: Just adding something to myself, that&#39;s all.\n\nPerplex&#39;s voice was nervous and out of breath still.\n\nTechnosis: Perplex, what is wrong?\n\nPerplex: Nothing at all.\n\nPertress: Thank you, Perplex.\n\nPertress&#39; voice echoed from inside of Perplex.\n\nPerplex: What I did was for a good reason, don&#39;t ever try it, Zeni.\n\nZeni: Okay.\n\nGramps: What...did you do?\n\nPerplex: Something I won&#39;t regret doing, I couldn&#39;t leave her behind.\n\nGramps: The ship&#39;s...computer?\n\nPerplex: That&#39;s right.\n\nGramps: So you installed the computer chip from the ship in your body?\n\nPerplex: yes, it was hard, too.\n\nGramps: Who&#39;s going to run the CR Chambers and whatnot, now?\n\nPertress: That will still be me.
