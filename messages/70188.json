I know we all have real lives, so this is not meant as a\npush as much as a reason why I haven&#39;t posted much for Rodimus in the\npast day or so. :)\n\nKraftlos, if you want to jump in on this band wagon feel free to do\nso. I would so much enjoy having your character&#39;s input in all of\nthis. With Rodimus being back, and Tuscon having assumed Prime status,\nthis is almost a new beginning for the Maximal and Autobot side, as\nwell as a revamping of Hydras&#39; faction as well. I can see so many\nthings bouncing off of this for both sides, and not just combat -\ncharacter growth, factions merging - there are so many things.\n\nAnd oh yes, don&#39;t forget the Unicronians are still out there! I have\nbeen keeping them low key since there is so much going on with the\nPrimes. But they will be making a noise soon. heh heh heh &gt;:-)\n\nI have been watching old Transformers Animated episodes, and after the\nold 80&#39;s cartoon I think they are excellent, and have given me much\nfood for thought - not sure if that is a good thing or bad :)\n\nAnyways, game on!\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
