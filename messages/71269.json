If I\n&gt;&gt; coul=\r\nd, it would probably be some sorta feline, same color, ellusive, quiet\n&gt;&gt; o=\r\nn the paws...  Oh yeah, that would be my choice if it was available.  But\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; actually I kinda like what I got now.  Sure, it&#39;s a pain in the tail pipe=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; when I break down but, it does get me around from point A ta point B in=\r\n a\n&gt;&gt; good amount of time.  And rolln&#39; on wheels is alot easier than walkn&#39;=\r\n,\n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s for sure.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; RAMULUS nodded as he looked around t=\r\nhe cave and then back at NIGHT\n&gt; SHIFT. =E2=80=9CI am sure that one of the =\r\nmedics can be talked into setting\n&gt; you. Wheels are next to useless on this=\r\n rugged terrain.=E2=80=9D He shrugged,\n&gt; =E2=80=9CBut then again I have bee=\r\nn trying to talk Rodimus into it for a while\n&gt; now. He said he thought abou=\r\nt being a bat. I almost had him into it,\n&gt; but he changed his mind.=E2=80=\r\n=9D\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He looks outside the cave.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; That&#39;s when I ca=\r\nn walk.  I&#39;m really gonna slow ya down Ramulus.  I hate\n&gt;&gt; don&#39; that ta ya.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a smile as RAMULUS turned to look back at NIGHT SHIFT,\n&gt; =\r\n=E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t worry about it. It sounds like the rain is beginning=\r\n to let up.\n&gt; We should hopefully be able to leave soon.=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; Even=\r\n as RAMULUS spoke the sound of the rain fall was slacking up,\n&gt; turning slo=\r\nwly from a down pour and becoming more of a drizzle. There\n&gt; was even the s=\r\nound of a bird or two from outside, sure signs of coming\n&gt; better weather.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Y=\r\nahoo!
