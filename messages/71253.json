He had\n&gt; finally gathered the courage to ask her hand in eternal bond. His spark\n&gt; beating a mile a minute, he couldn&#39;t help but share his joy with her, yet\n&gt; doing so in an innocent way.  He closes his eyes for a moment with a smile\n&gt; on his face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I love you with all my spark, that will never change, and no one will \n&gt; ever\n&gt; take that away from us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside, Uproar catches up to Lord Elder, as he observes the private code \n&gt; on\n&gt; Tuscons door.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wow, so, I guess Tucson and Talon are kinda gonna be like Rodimus and\n&gt; Nightlight.  I wonder if Tucson will ya know..  Have a family of his own\n&gt; some day?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Moving to Legacy&#39;s quarters, Straight Shot thinks for a moment before \n&gt; saying\n&gt; anything, which was her best of traits.  Once she had an idea of what she\n&gt; wanted to say, she looks up to Legacy, with an air of sincerity she always\n&gt; had for everyone, including her brother.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Thanks, for letting me talk to you, I appreciate it.  I just wanted ta \n&gt; let\n&gt; ya know that I think my brother doesn&#39;t quite understand where you&#39;re \n&gt; coming\n&gt; from and maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s so critical of your actions.  He&#39;s always\n&gt; been like that, not just around you, but with me too, and yeah, sometimes \n&gt; it\n&gt; gets on my nerves.  But with things as they are, and what happened ta him \n&gt; in\n&gt; the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s put up such a defense and why he&#39;s so\n&gt; determined ta think off the pavement.  And maybe that&#39;s why his \n&gt; personality\n&gt; clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed with mine too, at times.  Honestly \n&gt; though,\n&gt; how do you feel about his thinking outside the box?  Is there a reason why\n&gt; you&#39;d rather not go that way?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nighlight Smiled and squeezed Rodimus&#39;s hand while she lay down, she \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting better and with more energy with every second that passed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ELita?,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where is she? how is she?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Elita waved her little tail when she hear her mom calling her, she was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impatient to go and give her a big hug, but she knew that she had to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wait\n&gt; &gt; &gt; till her dad and Perceptor decided that it was time\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus smiled broadly as more and more evidence of Nightlight&#39;s full\n&gt; &gt; recovery was being shown. There was always so much weight on his\n&gt; &gt; shoulders as of late, weight and guilt. For what he had done, for what\n&gt; &gt; he allowed to be done. But being here and now with Nightlight he could\n&gt; &gt; feel at least some of that weight lifting from his shoulders.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;She is waiting outside my love.&quot; Rodimus said softly. &quot;We were just\n&gt; &gt; making sure you were strong enough first before we brought her in.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Turning to wave, Rodimus motioned for Elita to be brought in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *******************************\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kup watched the scene, letting the couple have time together.

He could see Rodimus and Nightlight, a small wistful\n&gt; &gt; smile playing about his face. &quot;Perhaps we can give them a little more\n&gt; &gt; time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wing Caliber nodded, &quot;A little.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ***************************\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor walked away of the maximals almost following Lord Elder, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; real purpose by now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lord Elder slowed as he walked away, noticing that none of the others\n&gt; &gt; had taken the moment to talk with Perceptor. He shot a glance at\n&gt; &gt; Uproar and Quickstride and then looked back at Perceptor. With a\n&gt; &gt; motion of his hand he gestured for them to talk with Perceptor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turned to walk in the direction of Tuscon when he was waylaid . . .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Straight Shot catches up to Lord Elder. If she had learned anything \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her brother, it was how to put up a brave face, and do the things that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were afraid to do no matter if you knew the outcome or not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Lord Elder, sir, you&#39;re right too, I know what I gotta do, for my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brother&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sake. I - really should try ta talk ta Legacy about all this, and get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; side of the story. Ohh boy, here it goes, Courage 101 in session.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elder smiled broadly, &quot;That is very good!&quot; he said happily. &quot;May\n&gt; &gt; Primus be with you.&quot; He said as he patted her on the back and then\n&gt; &gt; continued on his to see Tuscon\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She now walks off to find Legacy and by intuition, finds him readilly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as small as she was, what she was about to do, would take every ounce \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bravory in her tiny spark. To be sure that she was at eye level with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so she didn&#39;t need to crane her neck, she finds the highest point in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; room, climbs on it, and looks to him as if she were about to talk to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personally.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; By the time Straight Shot caught up with Legacy he had made it to one\n&gt; &gt; of the shops that seemed to liter the Ark. He had made it into his own\n&gt; &gt; personal quarters and work station.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He had not added much to the place or even made many changes. There\n&gt; &gt; was a small section for recharging chamber and a small modified\n&gt; &gt; computer panel; something that was needed since these rooms were\n&gt; &gt; designed for Autobots who were several times larger than any of them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy was standing at one of the computer panel as information\n&gt; &gt; scrolled across the screen.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turned as Straight Shot entered.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Legacy, if it&#39;s okay, could - we talk for a little while?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy looked at Straight Shot, his cold cyclopean gaze fastening onto\n&gt; &gt; her. &quot;That would be acceptable.&quot; Legacy said emotionlessly. He turned\n&gt; &gt; to face her completely, folding his arms behind his back he waited\n&gt; &gt; patiently for her to say what she had to say.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He types in a code to close the doors, to allow them a little privacy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once hearing them shut, he smiles to Talon, and gently takes her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hands.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; By the time Lord Elder caught up with Tuscon he was inside his\n&gt; &gt; chamber, he could smell the metallic oils that Talon customarily wore\n&gt; &gt; as well. He smiled grimly as he saw that the privacy codes on Tuscon&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; room had been engaged.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With a nod Lord Elder turned away. There would be time enough for talk.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As he turned he noticed Torca as he walked up to him, a grim look on\n&gt; &gt; his face. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Lord Elder said, concern written on his\n&gt; &gt; face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Torca nodded, &quot;We need to talk.&quot; Is all he said, his reverberous tone\n&gt; &gt; echoing in the halls.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Talon widely smiled and said while she jumped to Tucson&#39;s arms and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;YES!! YES!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With a start Elder thought he heard some sort of outburst from the\n&gt; &gt; room but he could not make out what it was. He smiled thinking that at\n&gt; &gt; least it sounded happy, they all needed happiness in their life.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He looked back at Torca he nodded, &quot;Of course.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With a gesture from Torca he and Elder began walking towards the bridge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
