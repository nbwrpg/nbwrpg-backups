She saw the mech fluid and the parts laying \nthere. &quot;Why did you do this Death? Why? I thought he was a loyal \nfollower in the group. I though....&quot; She stopped and looked at \nDeath.&quot;You said you killed a bot who was a traitor to us all. I will \nhave to ask that you prove it.  We may be predacons, but I need every \nbot available.  We will need everyone when we take up our major \nchallenge.  But untill then, yes, you make analyze what ever you want \nfrom his body, but please show me proof that he was as you say he \nwas.&quot;  She looked at Destructor,&quot;I want checks on all personell in \nthe group. And please check the computer systems, security systems \nETC ETC.  I want to make sure everything is functioning properly when \ncompany comes.&quot;  She looked down again at Phobia&#39;s body. &quot;Fetch me \nthe spark out of him.  I may have use of it. I may be down a bot, but \nthe others don&#39;t know that.&quot;  She looked at Death and back to \nDestrustor. &quot;Anything else?&quot;\n\nShe had to hide her feelings deep. She had trusted phobia, considered \nhim a friend. Now this.  She felt terrible about this.  She couldn&#39;t \nshow weakness, but she felt berayed and hurt frim this.  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  DEstructor quickly followed kit kat. he entered the hall to find \nDeath \n&gt; awaiting him...&quot;We have a problem he said. The one called \nPhobia..he is a \n&gt; vile creature. I scanned his data tracks. What I found can not be \ndescribed. \n&gt; You must understand he would have found away to kill us all if had \nthe \n&gt; chance. I did what I had to do. He though I fear is not slain. When \nI killed \n&gt; his body many of these little spiders cvame out. I fear they may \nrebuild him. \n&gt; I wish to have them examined.&quot;\n&gt;  Destructor put his hand on his old friends shoulder. &quot;I understand \nbut it is \n&gt; not my place...you must ask our leader. For undertanding.&quot; they \nboth turned \n&gt; to kit kat in attention.\n\n\n"}}
