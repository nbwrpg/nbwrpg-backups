He would soon \nget his revenge on Unitron. He saw Battera waiting for him beside the \nchamber. Curious little bot. Won&#39;t wait for anything. He spoke to her.\n\n&quot;Come with me to Terminess&#39; lab. I will tell you the plan there.&quot;\n\nVulois than sends a secret com link to Soundwave.\n\n&quot;Go to Terminess&#39; lab. We have important things to discuss.&quot;\n\nVulois starts walking towards the lab.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTerminess smiled and stared at what she had found.\n\n&quot;Excellent. The pod that I crashed in. The one I used to outwit \nOptimal Optimus. This will be a great start to our ship.&quot;\n\nBeing a termite, Terminess may carry more than 10x her body weight. \nShe easily hauls the pod onto her back and begins walking towards the \nPred base.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nBrocno laughed at Iron Raptor&#39;s transmision. He sent one back.\n\n&quot;Fool! I have nothing left. No family, no love ones, nothing to live \nfor. Dieing would just be another part of life. And if you do hunt me \ndown, you will become enraged, leaving your judgement  impaired. And \nas you told me, the actual commanders of the Maximals are gone. With \nthem gone and you insane, who would lead the Maximals? Who would \nprotect them from the Preds? The answer is no one. They would lose \nand they would die! I will give you one more mega-cycle. But since \nyou have not arrived, you do not get the full Octociz. Listen to \nthis.&quot;\n\nBronco pulled out a machine he had made from scrap parts of his ship \nwhile Octociz had been unconcios. He stuck to Octociz&#39; chest, and \nbegan pulling back on the handle. Octociz began screaming. So loud \nthat it could be heard through the com-link. In a few moments, the \nshell of Octociz had gone limp and dead. Inside the device was a \nsphere, filled with all sorts of DNAand things like that.\n\nIt was the spark of Octociz.\n\n&quot;He will only live for another mega-cycle like this, so you had \nbetter hurry. And no funny things, because this device is keeping him \nalive. I can pull the plug on him. See you in less than one mega-\ncycle.&quot;\n\nBronco shoved the body of Octociz into the sea to be laid to rest \nwith the Axalon. He laughed.\n\n\n"}}
