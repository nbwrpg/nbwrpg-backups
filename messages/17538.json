Rather surprising.\nHe saw Tavatron answer and then carry on in the general direction suggested, \napparently towards the CR room.\nWith a slight groan of his gears he followed, his entire body feeling much \nmore heavier then he knew it should.\nDinobot kept his eyes on Tavatron as they entered into a hall, growling as \nhe realized just what would happen once he got to the intended destination.\nIndeed, he would need help, or just maybe.\nHe needed fluids, but as soon as he transformed into robot mode to receive \nthem his last fluid pump would fail and he would slowly begin to die.\nFirst his lungs would do, completely deactivating them and shutting off any \nhope of drawing another breath.\nCutting off all air to the brain, eventually suffocating it.\nSo, basically, he had 20 cycles to pump enough fluids into his body to \nactivate his repair system to save himself in time before he basically \nwent�brain dead.\nDinobot snarled and clenched his fist, but he might also go right into \nstasis lock, and while he was out every system might go down.\nWhich meant that he wouldn�t be able to get the fluids into his body and end \nup dead in the end anyway, without a single bot even knowing just what had \ngone wrong.\nHowever, at the moment he was resisting stasis lock, which had been \ncontinuously pushing and threatening to take over for the past mega-cycle. \nIf he simply let it take over his systems now he just might be able to keep \nhis pump active a little longer and then he would surely sur..v�i�v�e�.\nAll at once, Dinobots systems began to buckle and fail, even the system, \nwhich held his beast mode as the dominant form at the moment. Which meant \nthat his systems could no longer support the beast mode, and in an emergency \noverhaul he automatically transformed into robot mode.\nBad move!!\nDinobot instantly fell to his knees as soon as the transformation was \ncomplete, mech-fluid spilling onto the floor due to his re-exposed wounds.\nThe fourth fluid pump was straining, buckling, and finally�deactivated!\nHis breathing stopped!\nHe tried to rise to his feet to at least get him to the CR room in time, but \neverything was failing.\nHis lungs strained and tried to expand, to get air but their own functions \nhad been deactivated and their attempts futile.\nDinobot, however, remained calm and very still, remembering that he now had \n20 cycles to get fluid into his body and reactivate his repair systems.\nThere was no point in panicking when it would only be for the worst.\nBut, again he tried to get to his feet, willing his body to at least \nfunction until he reached to entrance to the CR room.\nBut nothing was working, except�suddenly his internal computer activated \nwith the status of his damage�**\n\nI-COMP: � Respiratory functions have ceased, permanent lose of spark in 13.3 \ncycles. Stasis lock activating in 5�4�3��\n\n** And so it spoke out loud.\nBut the impending stasis lock was only another signature that death was \ncloser then anybot could possibly know.\nIn a couple of seconds he would be out cold, and there wouldn�t be a bot in \nthe world that would even know what was happening inside.\nAnd while he was in stasis lock he still wouldn�t be able to bring air into \nhis lungs, eventually dying from lack of oxygen to the brain.\nHowever, with the failure of his systems was also the failure of his will \npower.\nAnd with that he could no longer hold back stasis lock.**\n\nI-COMP: ��2��\n\n** But maybe there was still a chance, just a glimmer but a chance none the \nless.\nWith one desperate attempt he quickly linked his communicative systems with \nthe only bot near him at the time, Tavatron. But with his weakness and \noncoming stasis lock he could only hook up to her internal screen, only a \nmantel messages able of being sent.\nWith his systems failing, the message was scattered�**\n\n��lungs���deacti����require���.fluids���syst���wil�.the���activa����������\n\nI-COMP: ��1�0�Stasis lock ac�t�v�a��t��d�e��d.�\n\n** And with that everything blacked out.\nAnd with no conscious mind keeping the muscles of his body firm enough to \nkeep him upright, Dinobots� body simply slumped heavily onto the floor.\nNot even his chest rose and fell with the intake and exit of breath, his \nsystems not even having enough energy to work with in order to reboot \nthemselves.\nSo, the warriors� body simply lay there, a growing mass of mech-fluid \nflowing out from beneath it. But then, even that stopped, no longer any \nfluid left in the body to bleed.\nBut what would he think if he ever woke from this darkness, what would he \nponder?\nHow could he have let himself get this injured? Or if he was a fool for \nsaving another�s life when he would only end up like this?\nIndeed, it was a puzzle to think.\nBut the real question to ponder was�would he ever live to dig into the \nshadows of his mind�again?**\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
