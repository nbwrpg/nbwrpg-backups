Her own injuries, \nhowever, were of minor importance. The basic fact still remained, she could \nwalk and Dinobot could barely stand, much less walk on his own. Either way \nshe didn�t have much of a choice. He needed her in order to make it back to \nbase, and she wasn�t about to just leave him there.\n\nTavatron sighed inwardly, she knew he didn�t like being touched, no matter \nwhat the circumstances may be, he had made that clear a long time ago. \nHowever, she wasn�t about to give up on him. She had changed, gone from a \nsparkless (heartless) uncaring �bot to one of compassion and understanding. \nThat didn�t mean she expected him to go through a complete overhaul. He was \nwho he was, that was part of the reason she liked being around him so much. \nStill, perhaps he could learn to show a little more... feeling. He was \nnormally so cold and emotionless, quite unsettling at times.\n\nTavatron slowly began to walk towards the ark, wrapping her other arm around \nDinobot�s waist, trying to offer as much support as possible. She didn�t \nmind him leaning on her, after hearing and partially seeing his shoulder \nspark she rightfully didn�t care whether or not he wanted her support. He \nwas in pain, there was no denying that fact. Tavatron grimaced as she \nwatched him dig into his palm again, this time, however, it seemed as if it \nwas out of pain, not an uncontrollable rage. For some odd reason it bothered \nher when he did that. She didn�t know why, it just did. However, it wasn�t \nher place to say anything. Not now anyway.\n\nTavatron smiled to herself as the ark�s doors came into view. The important \nthing was that they were alive. A little worse for wear, but alive \nnonetheless. Tavatron chuckled softly at Dinobot�s comment. He had saved her \nlife on numerous occasions, all she had ever done for him was be a burden. \nSome warrior, she could barely even hold her own in battle. The battle...\n\nTavatron grabbed at her back were normally her staff would have been... and \nfound nothing. Tavatron groaned in frustration as she pushed open an ark \ndoor with her free hand. She would have to go back for it later, right now \nDinobot needed an �R chamber:\n\n&quot;Seriously though, thank you for saving my life... again.&quot;\n\nTavatron smiled up at Dinobot. Her side was screaming with pain due to \nseveral if not more broken ribs, but you wouldn�t know it to look at her. \nShe didn�t need an �R chamber, just some time in beast mode.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
