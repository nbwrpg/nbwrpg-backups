He slowly draws his right knee up onto th=\r\ne bench, and then slowly sits up.  The voices a mere memory, as he tries to=\r\n concentrate on Rodimus&#39;s condition.  \n\n&quot; R - Rodimus?  Stanton? How - how =\r\nis Rodimus?  Did - it work?&quot;\n\nRat Trap watches from the other side, looking=\r\n rather excited as does Straight Shot. \n\n&quot;Guys, guys, look!  Rodimus is com=\r\nmn&#39; around!  He did it, Wheels did it!&quot;\n\nStraight Shot smiles as she points=\r\n to inside the room, with Elita still in her arms.\n\n&quot;See?!  What&#39;d I tell y=\r\na?!  Look, your dad&#39;s comming around, he&#39;s gonna be okay!  WHOOHOO!  Way ta=\r\n go Tucson!\n\nNight Shift jumps for joy as does Quickstride.\n\n&quot;Now that&#39;s wh=\r\nat I&#39;m talkn&#39; about!  I knew he&#39;d kick aft in there!&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks =\r\ninto the room, and notices an expression on Tucson&#39;s face, which gave an ai=\r\nr of concern.\n\n&quot;Hmm, Tucson still looks as if he&#39;s prepared to fend somethi=\r\nng off, like as if something may be watching him..  I wonder what it is...&quot;=\r\n \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Power continued to flow from Tuscon into the figure beneath him, a\n&gt; =\r\npulsing flow of energy moving from Tuscon&#39;s chest, down his arm and\n&gt; into =\r\nthe figure on the bed. Meanwhile the insectoids continued thier\n&gt; relentles=\r\ns attacks, on both Vestige and Tuscon!\n&gt; \n&gt; Suddenly the door slammed open,=\r\n the sounds of buzzing insects could be\n&gt; heard, as a swarm of them flew in=\r\nto the room. Blue ones, red ones,\n&gt; silver ones, black ones, each of all sh=\r\napes and sizes. However in the\n&gt; midst of that a female walked, the insects=\r\n flying around her obeying\n&gt; her and yet giving her a wide birth at the sam=\r\ne time. She was tall,\n&gt; taller than any of the insects, her movements smoot=\r\nh and flowing. She\n&gt; was black and red with large insect like wings sitting=\r\n on her back,\n&gt; designed something like seeker wings on a transformer. Her =\r\nlimbs were\n&gt; supple and femine, but there was no mistaking the strength and=\r\n power\n&gt; that was held within them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tuscon, Tuscon.&quot; She said as she =\r\nturned her gaze upon him, her eyes\n&gt; were crimson multifaceted eyes. &quot;You b=\r\nelieve that your leader was the\n&gt; what we wanted?&quot; She tilted her head, &quot;Ah=\r\nh&quot; she said as just just\n&gt; understanding it, &quot;It is that singular thinking =\r\nyou have.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She chuckled as she looked over at Vesige, the insects were=\r\n swarming\n&gt; over him, causing him to falter under thier onslaught. &quot;You hav=\r\ne\n&gt; gotten this far only because I we have allowed it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; At a gesture f=\r\nrom the larger female the swarm of insects that were\n&gt; attacking Tuscon and=\r\n Vestige leaped into the air and began to hover\n&gt; aroud the cieling of the =\r\nroom as the room itself began to warp and\n&gt; spin as if the very world aroun=\r\nd him was changing, altering, or\n&gt; perhaps returning to normal.\n&gt; \n&gt; The la=\r\nst whisper of a voice, &quot;Perhaps you gave us exactly what we\n&gt; wanted . . . =\r\n&quot; then there is laughter.\n&gt; \n&gt; The world goes black . . . and then Tuscon i=\r\ns aware of the medbay as\n&gt; his systems come back online. He can hear the vo=\r\nice of Santon, &quot;It is\n&gt; done. Rodimus is comming out of it and Tuscon&#39;s sys=\r\ntems are comming\n&gt; back to normal levels. We have done it, they are safe.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; A quiet laughter plays in Tuscon&#39;s head, or perhaps just a memeory of\n=\r\n&gt; it, but it falls silent as the real world beckons for Tuscon&#39;s\n&gt; attentio=\r\nn.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
