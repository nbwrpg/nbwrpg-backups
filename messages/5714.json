He felt so content, he had not a care in the world. Just then\n&gt;Magmatron loomed over the horizon, in a completely different form than he \n&gt;had\n&gt;seen. Almost immediately he was whisked away from Cybertron and Battera to \n&gt;a\n&gt;ship, he didn&#39;t have a TM2 body, just a regular Transformer body, with no\n&gt;alternate mode. He was after a mismatched hodgepodge of ships. They were a\n&gt;rogue band of Cybertronian space pirates known as the Seacons. There names\n&gt;were Coelagon, Halfshell, Scylle, Seaphantom and Terrormandar. And they\n&gt;formed the robot God Neptune (Piranacon for G1 fans). He hunted after them\n&gt;and shot all the ships they had, one though was only damaged enough to \n&gt;crash.\n&gt;It landed on a remote moon. They then formed the robot God Neptune.\n&gt;CyberShark had to adapt to the area, which was covered with water, he took\n&gt;the form of a Sharkish creature. They fought and fought and fought,\n&gt;CyberShark was nearly dead and he had only enough for one last trick, he\n&gt;popped a grenade and shoved it into the mouth of the Seacon. He was too \n&gt;weak\n&gt;to swim away and his ship was to far, the bomb exploded destroying the \n&gt;Seacon\n&gt;and CyberShark. He would never return to Cybertron.\n&gt;     CyberShark woke with a start. He had been dreaming, he must have dozed\n&gt;off watching Pantron. He looked in the CR chamber, Pantron was gone. Then \n&gt;he\n&gt;checked the computer, it said he had left a few days ago. He had never\n&gt;returned.\n&gt;     &quot;I&#39;ve slept for a few days? That cloaking thing must have done it,&quot;\n&gt;CyberShark said to himself. He heard the servos moving in his stomach. Yep\n&gt;that was it, he was hungry.\n&gt;     He started toward the cafeteria. On his way he ran into Battera, he\n&gt;didn&#39;t really know how to talk to her now.\n&gt;     &quot;Hi, I see you came back to the base. Have you enjoyed your stay?&quot; He\n&gt;asked, very nervously.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
