He started to \nboil up with fury. He turned around and stared down at Perplex.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex: I heard your whining as you ran.\n&gt; \n&gt; Serge: (Mumbles something not understandable)\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex: I&#39;ll give you a head start, RUN!\n&gt; \n&gt; Serge just stood there looking at Perplex. Perplex raised his hand, \nshowing the disk he was powering earlier. He started to make it grow \nlarger and glow more brightly and pulsate faster. Serge walked slowly \nbackwards.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex: Run faster than that if you value life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Serge continued to move slowly, planning to duck the disk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Clash flew along, wondering why he had been forced to \nrun by those fools back there. His arm was growing back now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Clash: How could I, it isn&#39;t possible, I am the ultimate being, the \nSUPREME being, I am perfection, I can&#39;t be beaten! It&#39;s not right, \nwhat happened? A hex? SOmething, something, huh, huh...\n&gt; \n&gt; (At the Cybertronian Fire)\n&gt; \n&gt; Deemos: Shokaract, you fool! We were ordered to cease fire! I&#39;ve \ngot to get out of here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deemos flew off away from the battle, contacting Sharpedge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deemos: Sharpedge, you&#39;re in command of my position, I can&#39;t stand \nto be there anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tarantopulous looked around him. Maximals, still firing, worse than \nhim even. Why do they act this way? It was only a cease fire? \nTarantopulous pondered this. After all, as soon as the Maximals get \ntheir guy back, then they could fire again, right? They were just \nmaking things harder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tarantopulous (To Kluster): Sir, they are all still firing. This is \nsuicide. You have shown me the light, and I am most certain that they \nare killing  themselves! I can&#39;t take this.\n&gt; \n&gt; With that, Tarantopulous ran from the battle, catching the \nattention of Deemos on his way...\n\n\n"}}
