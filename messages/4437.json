He only wished he hade some sort of jet \npack.\n    &quot;Magmatron we could use you down here.&quot; Bazooka yelled into his comm. He \nturned and fired opon the second bot (Not Shredder). Still unknowing of his \nname. Firiring all he had at him. Then he ran towards Bobertron.\n    &quot;Ohh...crap.&quot; Bazooka said. &quot;Shredder I must get Bobertron back to my \nbase. Follow me there wearing this. It will protect you alone. If that other \nbot follows you, he will be scrap.&quot; Bazooka called into his comm.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n::Magmatron::\n\n    After making sure that Bazooka&#39;s comm was always open to him he listened \nto the battle. Very smart Bazooka. He thought to himself. He transformed into \nbeast mode and headed off to join the battle.\n    He reached there only a little while later. &quot;Scanners identify the bot \nfighting Shredder.&quot; He asked of his systems. &quot;Bot known as Wrath. Scanners \nhave picked up the signal of a Predacon heading this way.&quot;\n    &quot;Darn.&quot; Magmatron said. &quot;Bazooka get Bobertron to a CR chamber, I&#39;ll deal \nwith the threats. Magmatron Transform.&quot;\n    He shifted into his impressave Robot mode. Firing all weapons at Wrath. \nHe then used the hidden rocket boster in his feet for a small arial exibit. \nDoing a little spin here and there he fired at Wrath. Floating there he \nwaited for the next move.\n\n"}}
