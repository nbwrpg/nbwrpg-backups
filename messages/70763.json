Sti=\r\nll he keeps his beliefs in the ex Predacon, and quietly listens to the conv=\r\nersations.  He knew deep down that Perceptor was turning over a new leaf, e=\r\nven if the others didn&#39;t quite believe it was true.  As he regains a lot of=\r\n his strength, he is now able to stand up on his feet by himself, without s=\r\ntumbling.  He turns his head in the direction of where Optimus Prime&#39;s body=\r\n lay.  He knew a visit to his fallen leader would benefit his own piece of =\r\nmind.\n\n&quot;Excuse me everyone, I won&#39;t be long.&quot;\n\nHe begins walking slowly at =\r\nfirst, but then regains his footing as he passes through doorways, and back=\r\n into the room where Optimus Prime&#39;s body lay.  Just by his sonars he could=\r\n pinpoint where he was and then kneels down in front of his lifeless body.\n=\r\n\n&quot;There are so many things I never got to ask you.  One of them being, how =\r\ndoes one find the perfect balance between trust and loyalty?  And how does =\r\none find peace in an atmosphere full of tension?  But most of all Optimus, =\r\nour paths appear to be the same, our values, our courage, our strength and =\r\nour faith in those around us.  Are our origins alike?  If so, is there a di=\r\nrection I should be going toward? One that will help me to guide the Autobo=\r\nts and Maximals to finding the road toward peaceful existance?  If anyone w=\r\nould know these answers, you would.&quot;\n\nHe puts a tiny orb of his own spark i=\r\nnto a container, and gives it as an offering to Optimus Prime.\n\n--- In nbwr=\r\npg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Could be or not necesary, i dont know&quot;replied Dryly PErceptor&quot;That =\r\ndepends\n&gt; &gt; of the scan and the strategy to follow, My best bet is do the s=\r\name what I\n&gt; &gt; did some weeks ago...
