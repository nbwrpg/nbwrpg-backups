The spacious room was fitted with a \ncommand chair in the back, a holo table in the center and several chairs \npointing to a huge holo-projection wall. Melchana and Gesper were working on \nsome adjustments on Prophecy, the main computer when the new rookies \narrived.\n\nBelthassan:\nWelcome to the command room. Let me present you Melchana, my sister and the \narmament specialist, and Gesper, my brother and the strategic and tactical \nplanning officer. Prophets, these are Tankor, Jetstorm, Thrust and Obsidean.\n\nMelchana:\nSo, you are the recruits, right? As Bel said, I&#39;m Melchana, and as soon as \nhe reformats you, I&#39;ll be the one who trains you. (Her tone was that of a \nharsh, battle-hardened officer.) As techno-organics, we have to learn \neverything again, from transformation to battle. And let me tell you that I \nam not as sweet as my brother.\n\nBelthassan:\nAlso, another Tripredacus is here on Earth. His name is Daemos. He is one of \nmy old friend and the co-commander, alongside with me, of our mission. Any \nquestions?\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
