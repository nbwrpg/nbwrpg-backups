He was lost. Completely lost, hopelessly lost!\n\nHis two cloaking devices were the only things that had kept him from being \ndetected, and they were running low on power. He froze in his tracks as he \nhears voices, making out one to be female and one male. He listened \ncarefully, catching the word &quot;Alliance&quot;.\n\nThe huge bot&#39;s eyes narrowed, Perndabot aproaching the two bots. He was \ncloaked, and wasn&#39;t making any noise, and he hoped he would be undetected. \nSlowly aproaching the two bots that, even though he didn&#39;t know, were two \nAlliance spies in the Maximal base, he strained his audio recievers, trying \nto catch every word they said.\n\n"}}
