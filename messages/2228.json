I&#39;ve never ignored damage,\neven\n&gt; from you.  The last time you shot at Stinkbomb, you shot at an area that\n&gt; didn&#39;t even exist (his middle area of his body gone from extensive\n&gt; explosions).  The first time, I accepted, even though it was moding really\n&gt; bad.  You, never excepted Ramhorn&#39;s charge after Suukie hit the ground.\nThat\n&gt; was a mode there, and ignoring damage.  But, I really don&#39;t want to argue\n&gt; with you, it&#39;s pointless.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Old school buds here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4057/10/_/_/_/959391692/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
