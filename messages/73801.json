I was once known as Souls=\r\ntice Omega. Some people called me THECODE. Then I was Hollywood Narrator. A=\r\nnd briefly Roland the Last Gunslinger. How are you all? I&#39;ve had hard times=\r\n, but I&#39;m well.\n\n\n\n\nAs the time of YahooGroups deleting its archives draws =\r\nnear, I reminisce of days long gone. I&#39;m archiving the group using the Yaho=\r\no-Group Archiver script. But I still feel melancholy knowing the archive wi=\r\nll be gone. The connection I had to NBW is fading away. Soon the thing that=\r\n kept me bound to the member&#39;s list will be gone. So I knew I needed to wri=\r\nte this message.\n\n\n\n\nI joined Neo Beast Wars during its peak many years ago=\r\n now. Back when the website had that Transformers the Movie midi playing. I=\r\nt was completely by chance I discovered NBW, and thus my life was forever c=\r\nhanged. I was a poster and accidental troll in Ben Yee&#39;s bwtf message board=\r\n during the old days. While I was fretting over everyone hating me, I notic=\r\ned a message board post advertising NBW RPG. This was in the days when Ben =\r\nYee&#39;s board could contain few topics at once. That topic only lasted for th=\r\ne day. But in that coincidental moment I reached out and seized the moment.=\r\n I became a NBW member. My first character was Sinesis. He was a moder. Hah=\r\na. :3\n\n\n\n\nI had minimal experience writing fanfic at that point. It was all=\r\n trash. But I looked forward to having fun with people. Writing for somethi=\r\nng I loved (and still love now, in ALL forms): Transformers. Unfortunately,=\r\n it was a very hard road for me. I was unpopular in NBW during my awkward a=\r\nttempts to learn etiquette. I didn&#39;t fit in at all. And I certainly had tro=\r\nuble learning the rules early on. Over time I worked hard to earn respect, =\r\nthough I resented some of the hard moderators of the time. Certain mods wer=\r\ne very rude to me and others and I haven&#39;t forgotten it. But I know I was v=\r\nery annoying too. I eventually found common ground with some other members =\r\nand formed some friendships. Alloran. Lurker Abyss. RoboRick. Dachande. The=\r\n late MiniMe316. It&#39;s been so long. I might have forgotten some. I apologiz=\r\ne. It was not intentional. In one way or another, I drifted apart from all =\r\nthese friends. I haven&#39;t heard from them in many years. For some of those i=\r\nt&#39;s better this way.\n\n\n\n\nI met a lot of people in NBW. I couldn&#39;t possibly =\r\nname them all. They were a fun bunch and I liked posting with most of them.=\r\n But it&#39;s fair to say I never fit in like I wanted. It seemed everything I =\r\ndid ruffled someone&#39;s feathers. Even giving characters wrestling moves or a=\r\n human name like &quot;Dan&quot; angered people. Despite actual Transformers fiction =\r\ndoing the same things several times. There were people who insisted on call=\r\ning me THECODE because of my old e-mail address. Despite my pleading with t=\r\nhem to not... I couldn&#39;t figure out how to change my message name back then=\r\n. For a while I was content. It was fun, but nerve-racking at the same time=\r\n. In the end I never did &quot;fit in&quot; like I had dreamed I would.\n\n\n\n\nBut I yea=\r\nrned for more, and so I formed my own Transformers RPG. SSO RPG took inspir=\r\nation from NBW and wouldn&#39;t have existed without it. It later fell apart. I=\r\n was ill-equipped to run a group and all my own members back-stabbed me in =\r\nresentment. Ha. Still, I wouldn&#39;t give up. I later formed DBZSF with my sis=\r\nter. A DBZ-based RPG, also taking inspiration from NBW. DBZSF had a good ru=\r\nn, but I&#39;ve been the only one writing for it for many years now. But it was=\r\n still active when I had the courage to finally leave NBW for good. My crip=\r\npling depression at the time helped my decision. I mouthed off to one of my=\r\n antagonists on my way out. Big time. Looking back, I see something was wro=\r\nng with my mental condition at the time. Not a glorious or mature exit... t=\r\no say the least. But being mentally unwell sometimes makes you a bomb ready=\r\n to explode... I guess. I don&#39;t want to excuse my detonation, though. I did=\r\nn&#39;t actually unsubscribe, but I was true to my word about my leave. I never=\r\n posted for NBW again. I recall someone saying I&#39;d come crawling back in a =\r\ncouple of weeks. That he enjoyed &quot;listening to me whine&quot; or so. Much as I m=\r\nissed NBW later, I&#39;m happy to have proved him wrong. &gt;:3\n\n\n\n\nBut now the dr=\r\neam is over. All the RPGs have had their sundowns. I&#39;m saddened, but from t=\r\nhat wasteland I found hope. Like a rose that grows from the wreckage. I use=\r\nd all the experience I gathered from my years in the RPGs to take the next =\r\nstep. I became a novelist. I have three books published on Amazon under the=\r\n name C. V. Reynolds. cvreynolds.net is my very simplistic website. I&#39;ve ac=\r\ncomplished what sometimes seems like a dream to me. Through all the years o=\r\nf depression and illnesses I&#39;ve suffered, I persevered. I have something to=\r\n show for it all.\n\n\n\n\nBut I never forgot my roots. And I know the truth. Wi=\r\nthout DBZSF (and my beloved Trigun), there would be no novels. Without SSO =\r\nRPG, there would be no DBZSF. Without NBW, there would be no... any of thos=\r\ne things. And so I owe a debt of gratitude to NBW. For showing me a way. Fo=\r\nr having a place for me, no matter how thorny it sometimes felt. For changi=\r\nng my life forever. To think it all came down to that one member who I no l=\r\nonger recall. Who posted that message on that forum at the right time for m=\r\ne to see it. And for NBW to form the steps that would take me to the stars.=\r\n\n\n\n\n\nSo thank you NBW for everything you&#39;ve done for me despite giving me s=\r\nome bad times sometimes. And thanks for the good times I did have posting f=\r\nun things with the members here. Thank you for giving me the training I nee=\r\nded to become something more. Thanks to all the members who had good times =\r\nwith me and were friendly and helpful to me. And thanks to other members th=\r\nat put up with my annoying younger self. Thanks to the mods for never follo=\r\nwing through on those threats to ban me. ;P Thanks for the history and than=\r\nks for the memories. Thank you for the inspiration for DBZSF and for feedin=\r\ng my desire to write and my hope for people to read my work. Thanks for cha=\r\nnging my life.\n\n\n\n\nThank you. And goodbye... for now.\n\n\n\n\nFor love and for =\r\npeace,\n\n~C. V.

I=\r\nn the end I never did &quot;fit in&quot; like I had dreamed I would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I yearned for more, and so I formed my own Transformer=\r\ns RPG. SSO RPG took inspiration from NBW and wouldn&#39;t have existed without =\r\nit. It later fell apart. I was ill-equipped to run a group and all my own m=\r\nembers back-stabbed me in resentment. Ha. Still, I wouldn&#39;t give up. I late=\r\nr formed DBZSF with my sister. A DBZ-based RPG, also taking inspiration fro=\r\nm NBW. DBZSF had a good run, but I&#39;ve been the only one writing for it for =\r\nmany years now. But it was still active when I had the courage to finally l=\r\neave NBW for good. My crippling depression at the time helped my decision. =\r\nI mouthed off to one of my antagonists on my way out. Big time. Looking bac=\r\nk, I see something was wrong with my mental condition at the time. Not a gl=\r\norious or mature exit... to say the least. But being mentally unwell someti=\r\nmes makes you a bomb ready to explode... I guess. I don&#39;t want to excuse my=\r\n detonation, though. I didn&#39;t actually unsubscribe, but I was true to my wo=\r\nrd about my leave. I never posted for NBW again. I recall someone saying I&#39;=\r\nd come crawling back in a couple of weeks. That he enjoyed &quot;listening to me=\r\n whine&quot; or so. Much as I missed NBW later, I&#39;m happy to have proved him wro=\r\nng. &gt;:3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now the dream is over. All t=\r\nhe RPGs have had their sundowns. I&#39;m saddened, but from that wasteland I fo=\r\nund hope. Like a rose that grows from the wreckage. I used all the experien=\r\nce I gathered from my years in the RPGs to take the next step. I became a n=\r\novelist. I have three books published on Amazon under the name C. V. Reynol=\r\nds. cvreynolds.net is my very simplistic website. I&#39;ve accomplished what so=\r\nmetimes seems like a dream to me. Through all the years of depression and i=\r\nllnesses I&#39;ve suffered, I persevered. I have something to show for it all.&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I never forgot my roots. And I know the=\r\n truth. Without DBZSF (and my beloved Trigun), there would be no novels. Wi=\r\nthout SSO RPG, there would be no DBZSF. Without NBW, there would be no... a=\r\nny of those things. And so I owe a debt of gratitude to NBW. For showing me=\r\n a way. For having a place for me, no matter how thorny it sometimes felt. =\r\nFor changing my life forever. To think it all came down to that one member =\r\nwho I no longer recall. Who posted that message on that forum at the right =\r\ntime for me to see it. And for NBW to form the steps that would take me to =\r\nthe stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So thank you NBW for everything =\r\nyou&#39;ve done for me despite giving me some bad times sometimes. And thanks f=\r\nor the good times I did have posting fun things with the members here. Than=\r\nk you for giving me the training I needed to become something more. Thanks =\r\nto all the members who had good times with me and were friendly and helpful=\r\n to me. And thanks to other members that put up with my annoying younger se=\r\nlf. Thanks to the mods for never following through on those threats to ban =\r\nme. ;P Thanks for the history and thanks for the memories. Thank you for th=\r\ne inspiration for DBZSF and for feeding my desire to write and my hope for =\r\npeople to read my work. Thanks for changing my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;non=\r\ne&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you. And goodbye... for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;=\r\np&gt;For love and for peace,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~C. V.
