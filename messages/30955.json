But she did hear his comment \non gaining weight. She&#39;d get him for that one when she felt better. \nBut she also heard him call her Wing. He hadn&#39;t called her that in \nages.  She smiled slightly at the memory of the last time he called \nher by her other name. She tried to walk as he tried to carry her.  \nShe felt like she was sleep walking more than anything.  She saw the \nblurry image of a wolverine running towards her.  She was about to \ncall forth an image for him, but her strength was drained far beyond \nher normal limits.  She didn&#39;t even know when she started to dream as \nshe ws put into the CR. \n\nIn the CR, she saw the battle again in her mind.  Using the power of \nthe CR while asleep, she projected the image of the cage bars around \nthe tank. Next to the tank, was Megaton with his skin peeling off. \nHer mental images looked very real. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine transformed back to his robot mode, he placed his arm \naround Ice&#39;s\n&gt; back and put her arm over his shoulder. She&#39;d lost alot of blood \nbut she was\n&gt; still slightly conscious. He opened a comm to Razor Claw, &quot;Where \nare you you\n&gt; blasted raptor?&quot; He put her weight on him and helped her to her \nfeet, &quot;Let\n&gt; me help you Wing.&quot; His mind was on the last time she&#39;d taken such \ndamage.\n&gt; Only difference was that this time he was there to make sure \nnothing more\n&gt; happened to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Razor Claw heard the transmission from his viewpoint in the \ndistance. &quot;I&#39;ve\n&gt; been monitoring your situation from here, do you need assistance?&quot; \nHe asked\n&gt; starting toward the CF at a steady pace.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine was having trouble carrying Ice, she&#39;d put on some weight \nsince\n&gt; becoming a polar bear. &quot;Icebird took some damage, I could use a \nhand.&quot; The\n&gt; wolfbot saw everyone else enter the CF,  it was nice to see that \nthey were\n&gt; still so compassionate.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a matter of seconds the wolverine crossed the distance. he put \non the\n&gt; breaks sliding across the dirt leaving a trail of dust and ash \nbehind him.\n&gt; He quickly transformed to his &quot;robot mode&quot; and extended his short \nraptorlike\n&gt; arms. &quot;Let me help&quot; he stated putting his arms in a supportive \nposition to\n&gt; help carry the polarbot.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once inside the two bots moved Ice to a CR chamber for repairs.\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
