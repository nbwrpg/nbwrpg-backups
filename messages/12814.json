She knew not why this bot was even trying to get \nher.  She had never delt with anything like this.  Since her arrival \nto this planet, she had always been in the mountains with other snow \nleopards.  She had never encountered anything like this bot who was \nchasing her.  She ran for all her worth.  She turned her head and \nshot back at the bot chasing her, but she senced that this wasn&#39;t a \ncatch and release fight.  This was a fight to the death. She wasn&#39;t \nsure who was in the area or even if there were other bots like her on \nthe planet.  She kept running in the hope of saving her skin.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Ok, c ya tomorrow, Logo.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::DeathScythe::\n&gt; \n&gt; The shot hits DeathScythe in his muscular shoulder, the bot \n&gt; continuing to run.
