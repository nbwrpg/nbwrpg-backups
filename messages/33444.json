It has been\n&gt; &gt; such a long time since fuel and smoke filled his sensory receptors. He\n&gt; &gt; stood for a few seconds to enjoy it. He then stepped out of Cyclonus\n&gt; &gt; and walked towards the Hill Motormaster had positioned himself at.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Excellent Motormaster&quot; Megatron commended him. As soon as Motormaster\n&gt; &gt; noticed Megatron there he stood to attention and saluted him. He then\n&gt; &gt; elbowed Dead-End, who was nearest, to do the same. &quot;Stand down&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; told them. He walked up to the peak of the hill, and scanned the\n&gt; &gt; battle field for Shockwave.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
