Maximals and Predacons no longer\nhad the large volumes of subspace &#39;room&#39; that that used to be enjoyed\nby the Autobots and Decepticons before the great reduction. However he\nwas still ready. He was basically carrying extra rations of energon as\nwell as basic repair supplies and tools he might need to cut and\nsplice with. It was not much, but it would do in a pinch.\n\n&quot;I have the co-ordinates.&quot; SANTON said as he held up the device. At a\nnod from LEO he began to read them, &quot;320.25 by 7218.60 Vector 187.&quot;\nHis words were cool and calm as he read them off.\n\n&quot;Everyone have them?&quot; LEO said as he looked around. &quot;You fliers are\ngoing to have to stay in the air, while we ground pounders are going\nto be here inside the jungle. We will be heading for the same\nlocation.&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME straightened, &quot;Maximals, MAXIMIZE!&quot; he said as he shifed\ninto his beast mode, that of a yellow and brown lion, his roar echoing\nacross the jungle, and at the same time the Fuzors, SANTON and WING\nCALIBER changed form as well.\n\n&quot;Noctorro, Airhammer, Wing Caliber try to keep an optic on us from the\nair, but if you loose sight of us, get to that location and try to\nfree the others. You know the mission. &quot;\n\nLEO PRIME&#39;s voice was nothing if not deep and more resonant. &quot;Any\nfurther and we will loose communications. Does anyone have any other\nquestions before we head in?&quot;\n\nSKY SHADOW had watched silent all this in silence, his optics on\nHYDRAS and LEO PRIME. He did said nothing to LEO, instead he whispered\nhis own orders into his radio, his voice whisper silent, his own\nrations carefully stowed away.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
