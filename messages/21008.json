He wanted to question Iron \nRaptor more, but he knew that she would not lie to him.\n\n&quot;I know, love,&quot; he says, sounding like a bot who was trying to \nconvince himself, &quot;Its just a random thought.&quot;\n\nHe glances at Iris, making a mental note to dump her in that stream \nafter this was all over. Prowl nods, leaning a bit toward Iron Raptor \nas he feels her lean her head against his shoulder.\n\n&quot;Ok, let&#39;s get on with this,&quot; he says, his beast mode head (chest \nplate in robot mode) splitting into two and sliding aside, revealing \nhis spark. His systems were already working on removing the code that \nIris had mentioned.\n\n&quot;Ready, love?&quot; he asks, looking into Iron Raptor&#39;s eyes, sliding his \nhands to her shoulders.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor hadn&#39;t failed in see the expressions in Prowls face \nas her and \n&gt; Iris argued about Donobot and such, knowing for a fact that Prowl \nwould \n&gt; probably get the wrong idea about what she had admitted to.\n&gt; Sure. She&#39;s looked up Dinobots file, just to see what she could \nfind out \n&gt; about him.\n&gt; Believe it or not, she was facinated about him. She never had any \nintended \n&gt; feeling or anything. But it&#39;s kinda hard not to notice the only \nother \n&gt; velociraptor in the same groupe as you are.\n&gt; It also just facinated her about how he could seem so emotionless \nand such.\n&gt; It made her edgy around him, but she really didn&#39;t know him the \nmore she \n&gt; thought about it.\n&gt; But she didn&#39;t like Dinobot, not in the way Prowl obviously \nthought. But she \n&gt; really didn&#39;t know if she liked him really either, it&#39;s hard to \nwhen all you \n&gt; know about them is what you read in files.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor bumped up against Prowls shoulder for a moment, hearing \nin his \n&gt; voice that he hadn&#39;t liked the subject.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I don&#39;t like him, Prowl. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking? I just \nwanted to \n&gt; know a bit about him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Yeah, I guess I can back up that comment. But I never said \nthat you \n&gt; liked him to begin with.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor growled towards Iris*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Well, you seemed to be leaning towards that direction a little \nbluntly&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Slag! I couldn&#39;t even imagin you two together! To the pit! \nJust \n&gt; imagin the kids out of that coupling!! No. I gotta abmit, even \nfeather head \n&gt; here is better for you then that Pred with a bad &#39;tude!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor rolled her optics but couldn&#39;t argue. Dinobot was way \ntoo mean \n&gt; for her to begin with, and she just wondered how Tavatron could \nmanage to be \n&gt; round him almost 27 7.\n&gt; But that wasn&#39;t what mattered now, it was the merging which was the \nmain \n&gt; subject.\n&gt; She leaned towards Prowl a bit more before laying her head on his \n&gt; shoulder-plate.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You should know that you&#39;re the only one I could ever want.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that she snuggled her head a bit into his neck, but they \nhad work \n&gt; to be done, and eventually get her into her robot mode again.\n&gt; But she was ready when he was.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iris never was one for sentiment, almost making a sickening wound \nas she saw \n&gt; the couple.\n&gt; She sighed*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Anyway...as soon as the code is disabled just let your \nspark exit \n&gt; your chest, then the energy from that should make her spark exit as \nwell, \n&gt; and then they should begin to merge. Simple as that.\n&gt; But you have to be relaxed, Prowl. And you mind has to be \nconcintrated on \n&gt; this task. Otherwise you&#39;re asking for disaster.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
