Tuscon\nhas no knowledge that Drill Bit and Vice Grip are there together.\n\nAs far as Tuscon knows Vice Grip has been either dead or missing for\nyears and while it is possible that Tuscon MIGHT know who Drill Bit is\n(I will leave that up to you and Adam to puzzle out) he would have no\nknowledge that a rebuilt Vice grip was along with him.\n\nIt&#39;s up to you but I can imagine that Tuscon might even wonder why\nDrill Bit is even there since when Tuscon left to the Jungle to look\nfor Rodimus the Maximals and Predacons were still pretty still at odds\nwith each other. Leo Prime had to finish what Tuscon had started.\n\nAs a side note, none of the Maximals should be aware of Vice Grip or\nDrillbit since they have been hidden from the beginning of this joint\nventure.\n\nAnyways, I leave the reposting to you :)\n\n- Preston\n\nOn 12/14/11, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tucson could see but could not determine who Drill Bit was.  Yet he knew he\n&gt; had to get a closer look to get an idea who the Cybertronian was.  He\n&gt; carefully moves closer to him, and to the point where he could see who he\n&gt; was.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Drill Bit?  Over here, it&#39;s me, Tucson Prime.  Is Vice Grip with you?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful for things you already\n&gt; posses.  Nothing is worth more than family and friends.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
