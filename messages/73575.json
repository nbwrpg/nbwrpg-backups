I find that rather strange\n&gt; that you know me, seeing that the old dragon had no mention of another, yet\n&gt; alone another who can converse in my language.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gets up, and stands rather stiffly.  He&#39;s swift to shift his weight\n&gt; around, and put himself in front of the mouth of the cave.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m sorry, but my child is about to be born and I wish no harm to come to\n&gt; it.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe silver and Black Dragon whom the others are calling DISCIPLE,\ntilted his head quizzically as he looked at TUCSON and then nodded,\nhumor glinting in his eye. &quot;I do not come for your progeny.&quot; he said\nas he straightened. &quot;There is one who would speak with you.&quot;\n\nAs DISCIPLE spoke the other dragons were still bowing or at least\nlooking down deferentially. A few whispered the name ARCANE in hushed\ntones.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
