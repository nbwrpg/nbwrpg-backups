Since as it was discovered, the Black Fortress is in\n&gt; Europe, and as we know the Ark is in North America. I believe that at\n&gt; the point in time NBW&#39;s takes place that there is a land bound route\n&gt; from the US to Europe, but it would take a very long time to traverse\n&gt; it. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; Quickstride and Straight Shot find it relatively easy to reach the\n&gt; area that Tuscon, Perceptor and Legacy are. The Ark&#39;s side of the\n&gt; cavern is steep and sheer, but here on the European side, near the\n&gt; Black fortress, it is sloped enough that a vehicle could drive up\n&gt; without too much difficulty.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ahead of Quickstride and Straight Shot, Legacy had been silent during\n&gt; the trip so far, seemingly content to let the others take the lead.\n&gt; His sensors had also locked in on Rodimus for a moment, and then like\n&gt; the others lost him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus appeared to be in critical condition.&quot; Legacy said as he\n&gt; walked, his cold cyclopean gaze attempting to pierce into the darkness\n&gt; ahead. &quot;I did not get an exact enough scan of that creature that held\n&gt; him to get a positive identification, however I have no information on\n&gt; what I gave scanned.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s headlights stretched far ahead into the darkness, but beyond\n&gt; the reach of them there was only darkness, or cave wall where the path\n&gt; bent and turned. The venting steam that had obscured their vision had\n&gt; slowed and then finally stopped. Ahead of them the tunnel appeared\n&gt; clear, although there was still little sign of Rodimus or his apparent\n&gt; abductor, save for the occasional scrape of metal on stone.\n&gt;\n&gt; The noxious smell of magma still fills the air making the bean pod gas\n&gt; from Quickstride hardly noticeable, mixed in as it was with all the\n&gt; other strange odors. Also heat from the surrounding walls and floor\n&gt; make this area very hot even for transformers, although it is still\n&gt; bearable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ahead of Tuscon, Perceptor and Legacy some sort of movement of several\n&gt; creatures can be made out, it does not look like Rodimus  . . .\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
