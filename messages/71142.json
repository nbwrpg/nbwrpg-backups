We&#39;re i=\r\nn uncharted territory now. The ground&#39;s very uneven here, doubt that my alt=\r\n form is gonna do us any good. I could travel for a while like that but if =\r\nI blow more than just one tire, we&#39;re sunk.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;Better save it, and stick ta walking. And why didn&#39;t ya think of loadn&#39; =\r\nup on spares anyway?!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift looks back to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; The=\r\n Ark only carried so many spare tires for my make&#39;n model.

C&#39;mon, I got the signal=\r\n, and I think I know where we&#39;re headed.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They begin another trek t=\r\noward the Black Fortresses former location.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I hope Cheetor&#39;s stil=\r\nl in one piece.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The next leg of the journey is unevent=\r\nful. The path that the duo have\n&gt; taken has become huge savannas, with the =\r\ntrees becoming fewer and\n&gt; fewer as they move across hundreds of open miles=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dinosaurs are plentiful but generally seen at a distance as well as\n=\r\n&gt; the mammals and other strange prehistoric beasts and birds. It would\n&gt; se=\r\nem that none of them want to have anything to do with the Autobot\n&gt; and the=\r\n Maximal that trek across their landscape.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, in the distance Ni=\r\nghtshift and Rat Trap can make out the dark\n&gt; billowing clouds of smoke tha=\r\nt would signify a volcanic eruption. The\n&gt; skies are darkening as the duo c=\r\nontinue, the number of animals and\n&gt; other life is becoming less and less, =\r\nas noxious clouds of black vapor\n&gt; roll across the land. However despite th=\r\nat both Rat Trap and\n&gt; Nightshift&#39;s compasses are telling them that they ar=\r\ne still going in\n&gt; the direction of where the tower once stood.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the=\r\n moment there is still no signal from Cheetor himself or sign of\n&gt; his pres=\r\nence. But then again he was very much closer when his signal\n&gt; was cut off.=\r\n However as they approach, it is becoming more and more\n&gt; dangerous as the =\r\nheat is begining to rise.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
