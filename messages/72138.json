For now we n=\r\need to lock down the situation and sww what we can\n&gt; &gt; salvage.&quot; There was =\r\nsomehting more than anger in LEO&#39;s voice, it was\n&gt; &gt; concern. &quot;From the rep=\r\norts I have read too many people have\n&gt; &gt; disappeared since we have arrived=\r\n here. Let&#39;s see if we can find some\n&gt; &gt; of them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They quickly en=\r\nough find themselves on the bridge.

A dot representing NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s signature is shown to be\n&gt; &gt; ins=\r\nide the ark, and then flying out of it, and travelling some\n&gt; &gt; distance. H=\r\ner signature landing nearly 100 miles away in a loney\n&gt; &gt; isolated area.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;What is Nightlight doing out there?&quot; LORD ELDER said, obviously not=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; aware of what has been happening.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; TORCA looked similarly conf=\r\nused.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LEO held up his hand, &quot;Just a moment.&quot; He said as he looked =\r\nat LEGACY,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Speed us up until we come to the present or until something=\r\n happens.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LEGACY nodded and the scene sped up and then slowed down=\r\n again as\n&gt; &gt; something like RODIMUS PRIME showed up on the screen, or atle=\r\nast an\n&gt; &gt; energy signature that looked much like his.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On the scre=\r\nen the small dot that represented RODIMUS approached the\n&gt; &gt; dot that repre=\r\nsented NIGHTLIGHT.
