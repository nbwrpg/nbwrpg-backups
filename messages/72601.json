The only light in the room came from the =\r\nvarious computer readouts from the consoles positioned around the room and =\r\nthe large view screen that was positioned in front of him. The image being =\r\ndisplayed was that of the jungle that had caught the attention of the MAXIM=\r\nALS and the PREDACONS of late. \n\nHe had been given all the information that=\r\n had been available to him and it was still frustrating little. \n\nHe reache=\r\nd over and opened a com link and entered his own private security code into=\r\n it and frowned as the computer reported back, &quot;The resource you are attemp=\r\nting to contact is not available.&quot;\n\nLORD ELDER sighed as he turned to look =\r\nback at the screen as he opened another com link, this one not needing the =\r\nsecurity code. &quot;Bump. What is the status of our injured personnel?&quot;\n\nThere =\r\nwas a pause and then BUMP responded, &quot;Polar Claw and his team are fully rec=\r\novered and Nightshift is nearly complete as well, his new beast mode has be=\r\nen fully integrated into his systems.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good.&quot; There was a nod from ELDER =\r\nas BUMP was speaking. &quot;What of Silverbolt?&quot; ELDER asked as he glanced back =\r\nat the screen. \n\n&quot;I was touch and go for a while there.&quot; BUMP said carefull=\r\ny, &quot;But he is recovering nicely as well.&quot;\n\nLORD ELDER grunted, &quot;Excellent. =\r\nHave them meet me in conference room 1 when they come online.&quot;\n\n&quot;What?&quot; BUM=\r\nP said as if caught of guard. &quot;You can&#39;t be . . . &quot;\n\n&quot;Yes I am.&quot; LORD ELDER=\r\n cut in. &quot;You have your orders. Carry them out.&quot; ELDER&#39;s voice was uncharac=\r\nteristically curt and commanding. There was a lot on his processor lately, =\r\nand from the looks of things it would only get worse. \n\n&quot;Of course, yes sir=\r\n.&quot; BUMP responded in a sullen manner. He was not one to take orders easily,=\r\n but even he could hear something strange in ELDER&#39;s voice. \n\nA message was=\r\n sent to NIGHTSHIFT&#39;s recharging chamber indicating that when he was recove=\r\nred to report to conference room #1.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n"}}
