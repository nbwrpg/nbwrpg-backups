I read some previous posts, and, really, a Transformer&#39;s \n&gt; RPG is \n&gt; &gt; cool!!!  Tell me how this is for a first post and new character.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; ~~~\n&gt; &gt; [Ganthrax]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ganthrax was settling down by a lake, watching the night stars. \n&gt; The \n&gt; water \n&gt; &gt; glimmered from the moonlight.  Ganthrax&#39;s dark body could only be \n&gt; seen by \n&gt; &gt; his glowing red optics.  He walked up to the edge of the lake, \nand \n&gt; looked at \n&gt; &gt; his reflection.  He thought to himself, Earth was wonderful.  \n&gt; Marvelous.  \n&gt; &gt; Ganthrax went over by some trees, and went to sleep, his red \noptics \n&gt; getting \n&gt; &gt; dimmer and dimmer.  So much beauty, so many things to see, so \nmany \n&gt; bots to \n&gt; &gt; kill.  Yes, Earth was wondeful.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Did I do okay?  Did I do anyth\n\n\n"}}
