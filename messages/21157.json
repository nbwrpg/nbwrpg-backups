Great to have you back Robo. \n\n::Squizzy::\nShe checked on the Feline clone and it was now 100% completed. She \nopened the tank and slowly hauled the clone up onto the table. She \nsighed and repeated the proccess on this clone as she did for \nBeholder.  Only the mother boards weren&#39;t as intact as they were for \nBeholder, and the memory chips for Feline were most burned and \ncharred to the point that they couldn&#39;t be used. She pulled out what \nshe could from the remains and installed them into Feline2.  She took \nout the remains of hte origianl spark chamber. She had to fix it up \nand make some major repairs to it. She opened up the chest panel on \nthe clone and installed the spark chamber. She filled it with energon \nand then closed it all up. She went over to the console and finished \nuploading all the memories she could salvage.  Then she sent the \nelectricity through the body to start the spark generating.\n\nShe could only sit by and hope for the best on this one. She shook \nher head. &quot;By the matrix I hope I never have this happens to me.&quot; \n\n\n"}}
