If this was going to be a torture session then\nMyrmidon knew he would be bored. Battle was fun, blade against balde,\ncannon against cannon. The injuring of an already beaten captive held\nlittle joy. However he still continued to follow Perceptor.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nMeanwhile the cloaked figure that was once a jet still maintained its\nsilent vigil. Assuming a robot mode it had slid inside just after the\nshuttle did and held itself against a rear wall out of sight.\n\nWith a small movement it pulled off a small egg shaped object and threw\nit. Whisper silent the pod flipped end over end and with the softest of\nclicks attached itself to a wall. Immidietly legs sproutted out from it\nas a head emerged giving it a spider-like look. \n\nQuickly it scuttled along the wall to the cieling, taking itself out\neasy view. With amazing dexterity and speed the creature followed Hot\nRod and the group that escorted him moving further inside the base as\nits master waited by the exit.\n\nPreston\n \n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
