He would arrive at \nCybertron a little after Killfest and his group had been captured by \nthe Maximals, and he would search for any escapers. Once he found two \ngood ones, he&#39;d bring them back. His disguise would help him, of \ncourse, but he had other useful skills.\n\n&quot;Allright, I&#39;m otta here,&quot; he says over the comm, steering the \nshuttle upward toward space.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Chamaleon::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;3... 2.. 1...
