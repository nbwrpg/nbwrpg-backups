Teeth \nsnapped,\n&gt; claws slashed, tails flew wildly as the growling and roars filled \nthe halls\n&gt; (Almost reminds me of my divorce.) The raptor had sized up the \ndragons and\n&gt; knew that to win he&#39;d have to fight up close so that weapons other \nthan body\n&gt; parts would be ineffective. He&#39;d anticipated that the two opponents \nwould\n&gt; lead with thier teeth he just underestimated thier speed. he tried \nto roll\n&gt; to the side and slash Attilla as he went passed. As the mutant spun \naone of\n&gt; the dragons razor sharp teeth scraped his neck cutting Razor Claw \nand giving\n&gt; the dragon the first taste of blood (Mech fluid.)\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;airly2000@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, November 02, 2001 8:57 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: showdown at the OK hallway.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Attilla/Luzbel:::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;ATTACK!!!!&quot;shouted Attilla, both males transformed to beast mode \nand\n&gt; &gt; they tried to bite RazorCraw\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Razor Claw stood poised to attack. his raptor legs were bent and\n&gt; &gt; his tail curled behind him ready to push him forward toward \nAttilla\n&gt; &gt; and Luzbel.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bullet had seen the mutant in action and fealt bad for the two\n&gt; &gt; dragons.
