But...this is a matter of confusion.  \n&gt; First of Jason, how do you fly into the bridge, take the charge, \nand \n&gt; get out of the base in under 5 seconds?  That&#39;s just confusing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seconds, Minime, had a better chance, but he carried Spears into \nthe \n&gt; Ark (of course, this could be as the bomb was being set, I&#39;m not \n&gt; sure), set her outside of the room in about a second.  I&#39;m sorry, \nat \n&gt; the least that would be 3 seconds or so.  Unless the character that \n&gt; was helping her was the Flash.  But I don&#39;t care, if you wanna keep \n&gt; it this way, it&#39;s all the same to me, I&#39;m not going to argue this \n&gt; early in the morning for something as unimportant as that.  Of \n&gt; course, Minime, before you picked up Spears, you must&#39;ve missed the \n&gt; post where I believe...Jhogan (Xiane) picked her up and carried her \n&gt; into the Ark, which was before yours.  So your post is void, unless \n&gt; you still want to do whatever the hell you did.  By the way, this \n&gt; isn&#39;t my last problem out one of Icedemon&#39;s transgressions.  So \nIce, \n&gt; there&#39;s another one.  And YOU are pushing ME to the edge.  At a \nnice \n&gt; speedy pace)\n\n\n"}}
