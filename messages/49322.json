(note the \ncapitalization) I was using the word &#39;matrix&#39; as an adjective to \ndescribe what the cube looks like.

By\n&gt; the way can we call it anything ACCEPT the Matrix,\n&gt; because after seeing the movie I don&#39;t believe that\n&gt; was the actual Matrix,  I go along with the Matrix\n&gt; being the all spark, and that device simply being a\n&gt; link to the part of the that held the Autobot&#39;s\n&gt; leaders&#39; energy rather than the actual Matrix itself\n&gt; (it helps link G1 and BM together and I love BM, also\n&gt; most people say that that being the Matrix creates no\n&gt; problems with BW, but from my vague understanding of\n&gt; G1 that was only suppose to be the leaders in the\n&gt; Matrix, and Dinobot wasn&#39;t a leader, but Optimus\n&gt; Primal said &quot;May his spark join the Matrix....the\n&gt; greatest of Cybertron).\n&gt; \n&gt; --- x_rauq_x &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ooC: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Are there any Maximals present at the this battle?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; May I suggest that Switchblade brings it outside,\n&gt; &gt; and accidentally \n&gt; &gt; triggers an effect which creats a laser beam which\n&gt; &gt; targets Tyrael, \n&gt; &gt; but hits Megatron as well since he and Tyrael are\n&gt; &gt; fighting. After \n&gt; &gt; that, one of the still functioning\n&gt; &gt; Maximals/Tripreds, breaks the \n&gt; &gt; matrix like setup of the cube, thus breaking it into\n&gt; &gt; its pieces. \n&gt; &gt; From there, the pieces could get scattered around\n&gt; &gt; the world, or they \n&gt; &gt; could get divided up between the factions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since this affects everyone, ooC replies to it over\n&gt; &gt; the messageboard \n&gt; &gt; are quite acceptable, and are encouraged.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\n&gt; http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n\n"}}
