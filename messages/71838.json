I can definitly understand as how folks could get upset with\nhow Tuscon is acting, he does seem to be especially mean and ornery\nthese days.\n\nJust as an FYI Tuscon is suppose to be going through some problems\nthat he is having to come to terms with, mainly anger and agression\ndue in part to his new form. I would suspect that its instincts and\ntemperment is making Tuscon&#39;s already short tempor even shorter. So\nthat is why Tuscon is acting more angry and aggressive then normal. So\nif we can, let&#39;s try to deal with that aspect in character as best as\nwe can and give Tuscon some really good RP.\n\nBut we can also think that Wheelie&#39;s temporment also gives us a good\nchance for RP, since we know that he tends to cut pretty deep also.\nIt&#39;s the interation that makes things fun. I look foward to it.\n\nYou know though as a thought, I would have imagine that Rat Trap would\nknow how to deal with it better than most. Rat Trap is a simlar style\ncharacter. He doesn&#39;t usually resort to conflict, but rather letting\nhis mouth do all the talking - you know how he and Dinobot got along\n:)\n\nNow as to power posing, I am perfectly fine with Wheelie ignoring the\nimplied damage that he took and just side stepping it. No character\ncan pose the damage another character takes, he can only pose the\ncircumstances around it and let the other person around it choose what\nis to happen.\n\nAs for posting, I will let the others post first. I don&#39;t want to go\nto fast for everyone :)\n\n- Preston\n\nOn 8/22/11, adamsafran &lt;adamsafran@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC Uhm, Quartz, Wheelie was basically giving your characters some sass, but\n&gt; then Rattrap and  Straight Shot then tried to assault him, which if it had\n&gt; worked would have sent him to the medbay, and now Tuscon is getting in Leo\n&gt; Prime&#39;s face for having attempted to stop Autobots from starting a fight in\n&gt; the medbay.  I&#39;m aware he&#39;s your character and protecting his sister, but I\n&gt; can&#39;t see this exactly as something a Prime would do. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; And in the future, please don&#39;t powerpose me, pranks or otherwise -\n&gt; especially when it comes to something that would inflict significant damage,\n&gt; liek slamming him into quills!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
