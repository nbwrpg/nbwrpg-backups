We are, after all, derived from predacon philosophies.\nWe seek to give the power of the Matrix to every Transformers, with or \nwithout violence. We have adopted reformatting to enable some of us to \nbe in constant contact with the Matrix. We venerate it, as it is the \nsource of most of our knowledge and our strenght. As a faction, we \nconsider that loyalty to comrades is a quality and a value that is \nimportant for good military life. As for me... I completed studies at \nthe Tripredacus War Academy. I am qualified as a warrior and \nspecialized in tactics and strategy. My brother Belthassan and my \nsister Melchana are the rest of the original mission that came here. \nTogether, we form Prophetus, the techno-organic Gestalt. Everything \nthat I am telling you now was classified, but Daemos, the new \ncommander, ordered me to reveal those informations to you.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Pacifix then accelerates, and hits the water with a loud splash.
