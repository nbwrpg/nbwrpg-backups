It&#39;s \ngot a LOT of whiners in it.)\n\n&lt;&lt; \n Well that is the biggest exaggeration of anything that ive heard. As \n RDahl stated Decpeticons and Autobots were firing missiles at each \n other underwater without any problems that he stated. And as for \n physically possible, are we forgeting that TF physics and human \n physics are two entirely different things? And Yan who has \n complained? I mean really if players have that many complaints about \n something they should really have the guts to say something to the \n player so that they may be able to clear up any questioning stuff. \n Instead of going behind the players back and complaining without \n wanting any explanation. And Ive talked with a great many players who \n feel that way too. The point of the second Infecticon base is to be \n heavily defended and hard to reach, because it is the most important. \n &gt; LN, the energy required to push a missile up from the bottom of the \n ocean ot anywhere would probably be able to power Manhatton (yeah, I \n spelled it wrong, oh well) for several years. Having your base that \n far down under is a tradeoff I guess. I toned your weapons list down \n without realizing the depth, but with all the complaints I&#39;ve been \n getting I think a good tradeoff (and physically possible) would be to \n have almost no defences since its that far down.\n &gt; \n\n"}}
