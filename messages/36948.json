He \nwas\n&gt; perplexed by the readings, and not to sure how to help. It seemed \nlike\n&gt; this robot was emmitting high energy readings. He tried again. &quot;Do \nyou\n&gt; need repairs?&quot; he asked.\n\n::REDHOT::\n\n    Redhot looked up at the strange robot with tired eyes. He did not \nanswer the question at first, instead focusing his foggy mind on the \nenergy around him. His eyes hooded with the enormous concentration \ninvolved. \n    (Old..One...) he pleaded with it. (...pl..ease...leave..) Almost \nimmediately the energy dispersed, as if controlled by supernatural \nforces. Or had a mind of it&#39;s own.\n    Releved that it left, Redhot groaned. He tried to thank it but \ncouldn&#39;t find the strength. Instead he lazily gazed at the strange \nrobot.\n    &quot;Re..pair..s....go..od.&quot; he croaked. He managed a faint smile. \nThen he closed his eyes and rested.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n**********************************\n\n\n"}}
