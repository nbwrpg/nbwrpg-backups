Why didn&#39;t she ask him? Prowl didn&#39;t know, and didn&#39;t really want to think about it, but his thoughts pushed on relentlessly. Why did she not ask him, Prowl, to help in this? Did she not want him around her?\n\nWhy was he doubting her judgement, anyways? She was his commander, regardless of whatever their personal relationship were. He&#39;d already disobeyed orders before, he wasn&#39;t going to do it again.\n\n&quot;Cyndro, try to kill me,&quot; he says as he enters the training room, the doors closing but not locking. Several holograms appear around him, armed to the teeth.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRixer limps to the CR chambers, getting into one and letting it start repairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron tapped her foot against the charred dust that settled infront of the \n&gt; City, finding that this was getting rather boring.\n&gt; That was, until AzureBlade caught her attention with his announcement.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;de like you to be one of my own representitives when this Devil \n&gt; character shows. Having a powerful transformer might make him think twice if \n&gt; he wants to start something.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
