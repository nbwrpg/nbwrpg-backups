They all looked the same\ngunmetal color, functional, devoid of any spark. This one, however,\nlooked different. There were computers, lots of them, as well as a\ndoor that clearly indicated warning signs, but warnings of what.\nAgainst any common sense, Balistica entered. What she found surprised her.\n\nThere was a Maximal, his affiliation symbol clearly visible on his\nchestplate, lying down on a table. Wires ran from him to the\ncomputers... or was it the other way around? Nonetheless, those Preds\nwere obviously going to do something with him... if they hadn&#39;t\nstarted yet.\n\nShe walked up to him and tried to wake him up. Unsuccessful, she\nfuriously grabbed the wires and ripped them off.\n\nBalistica: Come on, by Primus&#39; spark, wake up, just wake up!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Windlord:\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord was kept in Iron Skull Predacon&#39;s labs, and preparations\nfor his reprograming were almost done.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Azure if you desire that Balistica void this, it&#39;s time.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
