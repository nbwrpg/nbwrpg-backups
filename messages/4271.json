I have my arm here,&quot; he said, lifting his \ndetached arm, &quot;but I am still powerful.  Requesting permission to strafe the \nArk.&quot;\n\n&quot;Granted.  Make them pay.  Test your com.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, Master Shuko.&quot; Sixshot bowed.  Activating his com, he spoke into it.  \nShuko only heard Sixshot in person, not over the com.  All he heard was \nstatic.\n\n&quot;Slag!  A jamming station.  Switch your frequencies to the next frequency we \nhad planned.&quot;  they all did so.  &lt;Set, Set!&gt; Shuko yelled into his com, \nhoping Set had remembered to keep all the frequencies they were going to use \nopen to his com systems.\n\nSixshot transformed into his space fighter mode, launching in the air towards \nthe Ark, arming his missiles and bombs, as well as his lasers.\n\n---\n\nShuko, Unitron, Hades, Anubis, and Serpentor all stepped into their base.\n\n&quot;Mercenaries, stand guard here.  When we are repaired, we will give you your \npay, as I have done in the past with your services.&quot; Shuko said, each of the \nrobots going into the CR room and getting into chambers and pools.\n\n===\n\n-All systems at 100%.  Energon infusion complete.  Energy levels at 100%, and \nslowly decreasing- Shockwave&#39;s internal computer told him.\n&quot;My supplies are down to 18 kilos of energon.  Only enough to keep me at 75% \nefficiency by the next lunar rotation of this pitiful planet.  I must find a \nsuitable energon source.&quot; Shockwave walked through the forest, entering what \nwould be known as Germany in the future, near a city that would be named \nMunich.  Seeing a proto-human, he walked right by it, not doing what other \n&quot;evil&quot; robots like him would do.  Shoot it.  He was to smart for that.  Why \nshoot a worthless organic creature, that would surely drain his energy \nlevels.  He continued to walk.  After all, it conserved more energy with just \nwalking then being in his space fighter mode.\n\n===\n\nScattershot watched Ultra Optimus leave.  &lt;Zardus, it&#39;s Scattershot.  That \nMaximal Autobot left!  DevilDuer went off to fight him, but he&#39;s scrapped.  \nI&#39;m comin&#39; back to base.  You want me to bring DevilDuer&#39;s decapitated head \non a pike so you can examine it better?&gt;\n\n===\n\nDouble Punch continued to watch.  He sighed. Maybe Hell Beast didn&#39;t recieve \nhis last com transmission.  \n\n&lt;LORD HELLBEAST!  This is Double Punch.  I&#39;m spying on the Maxis.  If we \nattacked now, they&#39;d all die.  The Ark is in a really bad condition.  At the \nrate they&#39;re going (with two or three people repairing only) the ship won&#39;t \nbe back up for another 8 months.  The troops are in dismay...and I smell \nrebellion in the air.  Do you wish for me to stay here and keep an eye on the \nsituation and report back to you periodically?&gt;\n\nDouble Punch ancipated a reply, in his stealth mode so no one could see him, \nManterror and Injector in a small cave below him since they were visible \notherwise.\n\n===\n\nNemesis Enforcer reached the Alliance base, about to get into a CR chamber, \nhit on the back of the head from behind with the butt of a rifle.\n\n&quot;Not before us, sucker.&quot; Firestarter said.  After everyone else got into a CR \nchamber, Firestarter began to get in, putting away his rifle, when a pair of \nhands pulled him and threw him into the wall.\n\n&quot;What was that, loserbot?&quot; Nemesis joked poorly, knocking Firestarter to the \nground with a mean left hook.  Two kicks to the face knocked Firestarter out, \nNemesis getting into a CR chamber chuckling.\n\n"}}
