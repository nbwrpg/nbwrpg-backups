I made BM out to be basically a state secret everyone knows \nabout, \n&gt; but makes a point of not mentioning (or rather it&#39;s considered a \n&gt; historical side note). And that would basically be writting a book \n&gt; which would be fine except I&#39;m already writting a 3 part series (if \nI \n&gt; can get it published) I call &quot;Gundam Omega&quot;. It takes place in the \n&gt; year Martian Century 80. It involves the war between the Martian \ngroup \n&gt; &quot;Red Sphere&quot; and the now militaristic &quot;Earth Sphere United Nations&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Dewboy you cant post for the RPGs cybertron. YOu can post for your \n&gt; alternate \n&gt; &gt; dimension one. You want to make a cybertron based off BM? Go \n&gt; somewhere else \n&gt; &gt; and do it, then you&#39;ll be in charge. Just because you want your \nway \n&gt; doesnt \n&gt; &gt; mean your going to get it, so long as people oppose the idea of \nthe \n&gt; techno \n&gt; &gt; organic cybertron it will ntoi work. And notte Dewboy, you arent \nthe \n&gt; only one \n&gt; &gt; ot have posed from Cybertron others ahvbe. KSL has, I have, Hugar \n&gt; has. yan \n&gt; &gt; has. And none of those were trechnoorganic. so Dewboy TOUGH!\n\n\n"}}
