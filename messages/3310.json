Instead of bolting \nimmediately, she just stood there, frozen. It was nearly stupid to do so. \nShe left herself open. Her arms and legs were frozen. She had never done \nthat before. Her instincts, mainly when she was trapped by Megatron told her \nto run. But, no, she just stood there like an idiot. And Dinobot and \nTavatron were still with her in the room.\n\nHer mind was going through. The Maximal hadn&#39;t even answered her about \nMegatron. She was so tensed that the picture of the tyrant in her head made \nthe short spikes under her feet thrust out and dig into the floor. She had \nto move her feet with the movement of it. Her growled out into the hallway.\n\nAll that was left in her mind was Megatron.\n\n\n&gt;From: Yanshosh@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Wed, 14 Jun 2000 14:49:31 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;::Ramulus/Striker::\n&gt;\n&gt;Ramulus walks up to Shadow Cat and Snow Tech from behind.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Welcome,&quot; he says, seeing and hearing that they are maximals, &quot;I am \n&gt;Ramulus.&quot;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;Striker recieves the transmission from DarkMouse and frowns.
