That means\nthat all the Internet providers that use Excite@Home, suck as AT&T and\nComCast(I have ComCast@Home) will stop. If this happans, I will have no\nway of getting online. I dont know what I&#39;ll do, or how long it will\ntake me to get back. If this happans, I will try to get back ASAP, but I\ndont know. Anyway I wanted to inform you all of this. Hopefully I&#39;ll\ntalk to you later.\n\n"}}
