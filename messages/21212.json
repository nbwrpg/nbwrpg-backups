She dropped her \ncrates and ran back to Quickstrike. She drew her small pistol out \nand  ran to Quickstrike&#39;s side. She drew her gun on the flier. &quot;Don&#39;t \nmove unless you want your...&quot; she stopped and lowered her gun as soon \nas she saw it was Terrorsaur standing there. &quot;Hey! Your alive! WOW! I \nthought you got slagged or something. Gosh! It&#39;s great to see you \nagain. Wow, half the old gang is back together again. This is great!&quot;\nShe put her gun away and kept smiling up at Terrorsaur and \nQuickstrike. &quot;So what are you doing here? Just flying around and \nhappen to run into us huh?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Taking watch was just as bad as lugging around supplies. Maybe even \n&gt; worse. He looked around, arching his neck left and right, taking at \n&gt; glance at the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; After of few more mintures of leaning against the side of the ramp \n&gt; wall, he saw something in the sky. It looked like a flier. He \nsnapped \n&gt; up and watched it. His optics were the keenest part of his senses.\n&gt; \n&gt; It got closer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey!&quot; he called to alert the others. He trotted down to the end of \n&gt; the ramp and stood in attention to the approaching flier. It has \n&gt; wings, red in color.\n&gt; \n&gt; He aimed his arm up at it, ready to fire, then he realized what it \n&gt; was.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Dang.&quot; He lowered his arm. It was Terrorsaur. He dactyl landed by \n&gt; him. &quot;Where in tarnation were you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Spying,&quot; the dactyl replied. His wings shook a little.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Spying, huh?&quot; He turned his head towards the others.\n\n\n"}}
