The Maximals as well as Hell Beast&#39;s troops were there. He had to get out of here &lt;EM&gt;now&lt;/EM&gt;! He wasn&#39;t up to fighting. His damage was too great. He&#39;d just pass out or have the barrel of a gun in his face. And did they already find out that he had reformated the Predacon computer to where they wouldn&#39;t get it back to normal? She was now the Predacon&#39;s old computer, from the Darkside. \n&lt;P&gt;Quickstrike bared the pain, swung his torn leg around and leaped out of the Speeder. He fell chest first onto the bank of the steam, dunking his entire leg in the cold waters. He turned his head back to the battle, watching, and thinking they were going to get caught, and maybe killed. So, what he had to do now, as usuall is haul tail to saftey. He wasn&#39;t that stuid to stand around and wait to get shot or press his luck to get his head blown off.\n&lt;P&gt;He stood up and limped forward a few steps. His leg wouldn&#39;t cooperate. He fell back down to the ground. He slowly lifted his body from the ground, with his legs still horizonal, and transformed to his beast mode. \n&lt;P&gt;He looked around one more time, checking if there was some bot around charging at him, with a gun drawn. He wasn&#39;t going to go back to Hell Beast. He would kill him, for trechery and messing with the computer&#39;s programing. He wasn&#39;t going to die...today.\n&lt;P&gt;He quickly skittered off, half dragging his left claw that once acted as his leg. He carried himself as fast as his many legs would go.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
