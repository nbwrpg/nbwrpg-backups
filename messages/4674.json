Deep down \nhe\n&gt; &gt;knows that they&#39;re not his. He knows of the emblem on his right\n&gt; &gt;shoulder but knows not the meaning. As a robot he knows that he \ndoes\n&gt; &gt;not belong on this peaceful plane. As a wolf he yearns for\n&gt; &gt;companionship, for the hunt. Here he sits, a lone wolf in search \nof a\n&gt; &gt;pack.
