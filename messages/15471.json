Savage was constantly angry at at The Trainers, that is why he \nis in dragon mode, but the chip inside him prohibits him from \nactually doing damae to him. Prebon yelld out to the others.\n\n&quot;Blaze! Do you have the co-ordinates for The Ark?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes I do sir.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good. Everyone follow Blaze. Now we start our war!&quot;\n\nThe Trainers and Savage marched on to the Ark.\n\n\n"}}
