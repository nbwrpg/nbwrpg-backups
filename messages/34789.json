One nail \npierced a join on his left arm, disabling most movement from that \nside. He shakes his head, brushing nails off him. &quot;Stupid Maximals!&quot; \nAstroblast starts running towards Torca and Klant, firing twice from \nhis rifle, and twice from his twin chin lasers, both times at the \noriginator of the nails, Torca.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nRippersnapper leaps backwards away from Orion, but he isn&#39;t that \nlucky, Orion&#39;s sword cuts a nice groove in his nose. &quot;Aiiee,&quot; \nRippersnapper&#39;s expression changes from one of shock, to one of pure \nanimalistic anger. &quot;Rippersnapper will tear apart stinging Maximal!&quot; \nRippersnapper rushes Orion, fireing another missile, mechafluid \nleaking from his slash.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Hey, Jer, you haven&#39;t posted for Ratchet attacking Sinnertwin\n(post # \n&gt; 34699).
