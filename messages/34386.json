The first system&#39;s reactivity brought online \nthe massive computer that was Ragnus.\n\nThe behamoth rose slowly, as his joints had not been moved in many years.  \nSpreading his wings to thier full thirty two foot span his external sensors \ncame online revealing to him the interior of the volcano.  Looking up at the \nmouth of the volcano he crouched low, then using his powerful legs, \nprojected himself upwards.\n\nAs he cleared the volcano&#39;s mouth he spread his wings once again, only this \ntime with the lightning speed he knew he was capable of.  The escaping gases \npropelled his huge form upwards with great speed.  Looking around he scanned \nfor a fresh energy source.  Locating one a few miles to the south he set \nhimself in that direction.\n\nThe robotic Red Dragon that was known as Sagnus had finnally risen.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
