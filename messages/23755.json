Quickly, she rolled off him \nand looked up as two bots came to cover them. Teltoli smiled, and \nreached into her wrist container, which held some healing herbs.\n\nShe held them to WindLord&#39;s back wound, and the mechfluid stopped \nflowing and it healed, amazingly, till it was only an inch big. The \nherbs were absorbed in the Hawk&#39;s armour. She smiled and leaned back, \nwincing.\n\n&quot;For the future, big bot, my name&#39;s Teltoli SilverWing&quot; She smiled, \nand stood up painfully, grabbing the gun she had held earlier and \nwatching the sky.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Windlord::\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord opened his com link a gain and spoke in all Maximals \n&gt; frecuencies &quot;I&#39;ll do a forced land.. cover me... if we like survice \nI \n&gt; have to low the speed&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord started land and slowly he was getting close the \n&gt; ground, &quot;jus exist a way to stop&quot; thought the hawk.\n&gt; \n&gt; He calculated the distance and as sson as he saw that he would \ntouch \n&gt; the ground the turned up and cover at Teltoli with his wings; he \ndid \n&gt; a foroced land with his back the speed that he had,  made him \n&gt; advance, the pain was high.\n&gt; \n&gt; At last he stopped togheter MAximals and CF.
