However, \n&gt; having a base requires you to either land a ship on the planet and \n&gt; call it a base, or to build it. Neither of which you have done. You \n&gt; have to post for everything that you want to happen; leave nothing \n&gt; out. Say you have have a base, then people need to have seen it \nland \n&gt; on the planet, and then they could go and investigate. There is \n&gt; virtually no way that a whole ship can land on the planet withough \n&gt; being either seen or picked up on vast array of base scanners \naround \n&gt; the world. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Go to the following webpage, and read up on posting style and \n&gt; form. It helps for clarity of your messages, and also helps with \nthe \n&gt; flow of the game itself. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.nbwrpg.com/~rauq/howto.shtml\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, make sure you pay attention to other peoples posts for ideas \n&gt; on how to roleplay your characters, and for various forms of \n&gt; posting. Everyone has their own style, so you aren&#39;t expected to \n&gt; have a certain style. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;hotgy69420&quot; &lt;Hottie4u2have1@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; This is Panthro and to all the catbots that wanna join us heres \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; base location.Its 200 miles south of Maximal City.\n\n\n"}}
