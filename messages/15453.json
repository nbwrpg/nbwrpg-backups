So, if\n&gt; Jason and Earth would be so kind as to talk this over with each other\n&gt; PEACEFULLY, it&#39;d take a great deal off of everyone else&#39;s shoulders. But\n&gt; remember, Earth did have Cheetor first.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::The Oblitercons/Firearm/Grimmler/Proto/Prowl/Rex::\n&gt;\n&gt; Shots pummel Dark One&#39;s jet armor, one of them hitting into one of his\nguns,\n&gt; a small explosion sending him spinning sideways. He transforms into robot\n&gt; mode, growling as he fires mroe shots at Dinobot.\n&gt;\n&gt; He was going to kill these two Maximals, and nothing was going to stop\nhim.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; The forest around Pyro catches on fire as shots from his cannon hit the\n&gt; trees, the pyromaniac getting closer to the two Maximals. His sensors show\n&gt; Hiss flying, in gun mode, firing at Tavatron, the other Oblitercons\nrunning\n&gt; behind.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; As final preporation for the rescue mission, Firearm glances at the\nscanners\n&gt; of the Cybertronian Fire, his eyes widening as he sees gunfire near the\n&gt; location where Dinobot and Tavatron were last detected. The big Maximal\njumps\n&gt; to his feet, activating his comm to all Maximals.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;All Maximals, two units are under attack near the Alliance base,&quot; he says\n&gt; into it, running out of the room and heading for the exit, &quot;Proto,\n&gt; Necromancer, Grimmler, Prowl, HotRod, come with me, we&#39;re gonna show those\n&gt; Alliance bots what messing with Maximals feels like! Anyone else that\nfeels\n&gt; like it can also come. Rex, ya busy?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Brig duty,&quot; Rex&#39;s voice replies, a bit depressed.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Aw...&quot; Firearm says, &quot;You&#39;re gonna have to sit this one out, buddy!\nEveryone\n&gt; else, report to the entrance hatch as fast as you can, I&#39;m not waiting for\n&gt; more than a few seconds! Let&#39;s go!!! If I&#39;m not at the hatch, it means I\n&gt; left, just follow my signature. I&#39;ll leave an exaust trail.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Firearm runs out of the CF, nearly tripping over himself as he motions for\n&gt; Necromancer to follow him, waits half a second, and flies off at top speed\n&gt; for the Alliance territory, his jetpack leaving a trail of exaust.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl nods at HotRod, grinning even though he was supposed to be jealous.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nice to meet you, Pr-&quot; he shuts up as Firearm&#39;s voice sounds on his comm,\n&gt; and across the ship&#39;s intercom. He looks at Hot Rod and Prowler. &quot;Let&#39;s go\n&gt; guys, I think Prowler should go to, for his first mission.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks at Iron Raptor. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later, love,&quot; he says, spinning\naround\n&gt; and running toward the exit of the Cybertronian Fire, not seeing Cheetor\nwalk\n&gt; up.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Grimmler stops as he recieves Firearm&#39;s orders. He looks at Foxfingers,\n&gt; shrugging.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You heard &#39;im, let&#39;s go!&quot; he says, grabbing Foxfingers by the shoulder\nand\n&gt; running off toward the exit, tugging him along.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Proto spins around as Firearm rushes out of the CF and takes off, smiling.\n&gt; Just like Firearm, taking off like that.\n&gt;\n&gt; His feet boosters activating, Proto quickly catches up to Firearm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Just like old times, eh, Arm?&quot; he says, flying beside the bot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Firearm nods, grinning and speeding up. &quot;Let&#39;s show these bots what\nMaximals\n&gt; are made of, and I don&#39;t mean by being gutted!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
