A\nbattle \nhe barely survived. His mind ached from the effort of keeping himself \nconscious and several times his mind faded into near darkness.\nThrough \nsquinted, unfocused eyes he checked his insignia. Was it Autobot or \nwas it Decepticon? He couldn&#39;t remeber if he changed it. He couldn&#39;t \nremeber anything. He barely remebered how he got to his present \nlocation, just that it must have been by the aid of Primus. It was a \nfog in his memmory. Or was it like a cloud, which he very much liked \nto...\n    He gasped and feebily tried to get up, only to collapse in at an \nangle, one of his tattered wings keeping him stable. His chest ached \nand he weakly tried to contain the bleeding from it. He needed help. \nHe tried three times to open a com link, faintly remebered something \nabout Autobots. With one last valliant effort he forced out a\ndistress \ncall. He prayed someone heared it.\n\n*********************************\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n************************\n\n\n"}}
