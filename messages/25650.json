You two stay here and guard the\nbase, and Dead-End, try to have some Fun when i&#39;m gone.&quot; With that the\nsound of his motor becomes evident as the huge monster of metal comes to\nlife and speeds up towards a forest in the distance. Walking out of the\nship Speedbreaker turns to Dead-End &quot;well looks like it&#39;s just you and me\nbuddy.&quot;\n\n\n\nFurther down the sandy beach the two cars speed thouroughly with Wildrider\nswerving into and out of the water and then comes to a sudden stop as he\ncrashes into a hude boulder on the coast. &quot;Ha ha ha.
