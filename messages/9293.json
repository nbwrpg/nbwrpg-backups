It steadied itself, getting it&#39;s self ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; It looked and saw the grass moving and it pounced.  It&#39;s huge \nmuscled \n&gt; body pushing it upward and out towards Lunarpine.  It&#39;s pounce aim \n&gt; was a little off and missed Lunarpine by a foot. Now it saw him.  \n&gt; It&#39;s huge k-9 teeth protruding out. It&#39;s huge paws ready to tear \ninto \n&gt; his prey and soon, his next meal.\n\n\n"}}
