There was always so much weigh=\r\nt on his\nshoulders as of late, weight and guilt. For what he had done, for =\r\nwhat\nhe allowed to be done. But being here and now with Nightlight he could=\r\n\nfeel at least some of that weight lifting from his shoulders.\n\n=93She is w=\r\naiting outside my love.=94 Rodimus said softly. =93We were just\nmaking sure=\r\n you were strong enough first before we brought her in.=94\n\nTurning to wave=\r\n, Rodimus motioned for Elita to be brought in.\n\n***************************=\r\n****\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup watched the scene, letting the couple have time toget=\r\nher. While Windlord\n&gt; retired still feeling guilty for his part.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWi=\r\nng Caliber stood watching Kup and Windlord for a moment, Leo Walking\nup bes=\r\nide him. =93We had better get Torca.=94 Wing Caliber said in low\ntones. =93=\r\nIt will soon be decision time.=94\n\nLeo II nodded as he looked over at the w=\r\nindown showing the interior of\nthe medical lab. He could see Rodimus and Ni=\r\nghtlight, a small wistful\nsmile playing about his face. =93Perhaps we can g=\r\nive them a little more\ntime.=94\n\nWing Caliber nodded, =93A little.=94\n\n****=\r\n***********************\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor walked away of the maximals =\r\nalmost following Lord Elder, with no a\n&gt; real purpose by now.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLord =\r\nElder slowed as he walked away, noticing that none of the others\nhad taken =\r\nthe moment to talk with Perceptor. He shot a glance at\nUproar and Quickstri=\r\nde and then looked back at Perceptor. With a\nmotion of his hand he gestured=\r\n for them to talk with Perceptor.\n\nHe turned to walk in the direction of Tu=\r\nscon when he was waylaid . . .\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot catches up to Lor=\r\nd Elder. If she had learned anything from\n&gt; her brother, it was how to put =\r\nup a brave face, and do the things that you\n&gt; were afraid to do no matter i=\r\nf you knew the outcome or not.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, sir, you&#39;re right too, I kn=\r\now what I gotta do, for my brother&#39;s\n&gt; sake. I - really should try ta talk =\r\nta Legacy about all this, and get his\n&gt; side of the story. Ohh boy, here it=\r\n goes, Courage 101 in session.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nElder smiled broadly, =93That is ve=\r\nry good!=94 he said happily. =93May\nPrimus be with you.=94 He said as he pa=\r\ntted her on the back and then\ncontinued on his to see Tuscon\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; S=\r\nhe now walks off to find Legacy and by intuition, finds him readilly. Being=\r\n\n&gt; as small as she was, what she was about to do, would take every ounce of=\r\n\n&gt; bravory in her tiny spark. To be sure that she was at eye level with Leg=\r\nacy,\n&gt; so she didn&#39;t need to crane her neck, she finds the highest point in=\r\n the\n&gt; room, climbs on it, and looks to him as if she were about to talk to=\r\n Tucson\n&gt; personally.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBy the time Straight Shot caught up with Lega=\r\ncy he had made it to one\nof the shops that seemed to liter the Ark. He had =\r\nmade it into his own\npersonal quarters and work station.\n\nHe had not added =\r\nmuch to the place or even made many changes. There\nwas a small section for =\r\nrecharging chamber and a small modified\ncomputer panel; something that was =\r\nneeded since these rooms were\ndesigned for Autobots who were several times =\r\nlarger than any of them.\n\nLegacy was standing at one of the computer panel =\r\nas information\nscrolled across the screen.\n\nHe turned as Straight Shot ente=\r\nred.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Legacy, if it&#39;s okay, could - we talk for a little while=\r\n?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy looked at Straight Shot, his cold cyclopean gaze fastenin=\r\ng onto\nher. =93That would be acceptable.=94 Legacy said emotionlessly. He t=\r\nurned\nto face her completely, folding his arms behind his back he waited\npa=\r\ntiently for her to say what she had to say.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; He types in a code=\r\n to close the doors, to allow them a little privacy.\n&gt; Once hearing them sh=\r\nut, he smiles to Talon, and gently takes her hands.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBy the time Lor=\r\nd Elder caught up with Tuscon he was inside his\nchamber, he could smell the=\r\n metallic oils that Talon customarily wore\nas well. He smiled grimly as he =\r\nsaw that the privacy codes on Tuscon=92s\nroom had been engaged.\n\nWith a nod=\r\n Lord Elder turned away. There would be time enough for talk.\n\nAs he turned=\r\n he noticed Torca as he walked up to him, a grim look on\nhis face. =93Are y=\r\nou okay?=94 Lord Elder said, concern written on his\nface.\n\nTorca nodded, =\r\n=93We need to talk.=94 Is all he said, his reverberous tone\nechoing in the =\r\nhalls.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon widely smiled and said while she jumped to Tucson=\r\n&#39;s arms and said\n&gt; &quot;YES!! YES!!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWith a start Elder thought he hear=\r\nd some sort of outburst from the\nroom but he could not make out what it was=\r\n. He smiled thinking that at\nleast it sounded happy, they all needed happin=\r\ness in their life.\n\nHe looked back at Torca he nodded, =93Of course.=94\n\nWi=\r\nth a gesture from Torca he and Elder began walking towards the bridge.\n\n(TA=\r\nG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
