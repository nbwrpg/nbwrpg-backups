He nods gently to the Protohuman and accepts his offering with a gen=\r\ntile touch of his nose on the man&#39;s shoulder. He allows him to stroke his s=\r\nnout as some sort of good luck ritual.

He takes note of its slender shape. It was fe=\r\nmale. She looks to him as he looks to her. She slowly approaches him and th=\r\ney look gently to each other like brother and sister.

I fought alon=\r\ng side with my comrades but I wasn&#39;t good at following orders. I was well g=\r\nrounded but lost at the same time. Then, I met you and things began to chan=\r\nge on a more positive note. You may not believe this, but you helped me to =\r\nfind my path, and you saw me on the right road and guided me to my true fat=\r\ne. Soon afterwards, I became a Prime, acquired seventeen more wheels, and a=\r\nlmost looked like Optimus Prime, yet different. But one thing didn&#39;t change=\r\n, I was still battling blindness off and on. Then, a third change, due to e=\r\nxtensive damage to my previous form, which could not be repaired, I was gui=\r\nded to my final evolution, this one. All of these things wouldn&#39;t have come=\r\n about if I had never met you. And I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Talon,=\r\n I will miss this planet as much as you are, and hopefully we can tell our =\r\noffspring all about this planet and it&#39;s wondrous varieties of life that li=\r\nve here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The rodent climbs down and drops a nut in=\r\nto his hand, and chatters to him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; This is for us =\r\nto keep?
