Even if this group would end being\n&gt; adversaries, he wuold not instigate a conflict with them or endanger what\n&gt; they ahd built here, whatever it was with things he did not recognize,\n&gt; beyond even what he had seen of the Quintessons and of Unicron in his own\n&gt; way.\n&gt;\n&gt; Giving them an example of a Cybertronian salute, not specific to any\n&gt; faction, Wheelie quietly went in over to the central chamber.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n\nThe figure in the throne stood and returned the salute, although it\nwas a little uncertainly, as if he was unused to utilizing such a form\nof address. He nodded as WHEELIE stepped foward. &quot;Greeings.&quot; he said,\nhis voice deep and powerful.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - WHEELIE&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC - Must..  Resist..  Urge..  To abuse fact only thing that rhymes wtih\n&gt; Unus is Anus..\n\nOOC: LOL!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE entered ni, glancing about the chamber, not quite reverently, but\n&gt; curiously, &quot;What are you?  Where did you come from, what do you do?&quot;  Seeing\n&gt; if eh could get any sort of ifnormation on what this mysterious base was\n&gt; for.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a regal nod from UNUS, &quot;ahh, you are like the other.&quot; he\nsaid peering at WHEELIE&#39;s Autobot brand. &quot;He told me that others might\ncome, but he described a different sort of symbol.&quot;\n\nUNUS gestured towards WHEELIE, &quot;You must be tired after your travels,\nsit, sit.&quot;\n\nA chair was brought for WHEELIE as ASTRA and FIREHORN moved to stand\nnearer UNUS moving ao a position of attention and then &#39;at-ease&#39;, the\nbut of their axes resting comfortably on the ground, held calmly in\nthe left hands, they stood like soldiers.\n\n&quot;You have many questions.&quot; UNUS said with a smile, &quot;But I don&#39;t think\nmy answers will help you much.&quot; He seated himself back in his seat,\neven this movement somehow regal and dignified. &quot;Perhaps the what we\nare is a little easier. We are the Cornu.&quot; As he said this he gestured\nto the other figures that stood around the room.&quot;\n\nHe peered closely at WHEELIE again, &quot;From what we have learned we are\nnot much different then you I would think. Our structure seems to be\nlargely the same, although we turn into animals while seem to turn\ninto a strange wheeled vehicle.&quot; There was a dismissive gesture, &quot;But\nI think underneath we all about the same.&quot;\n\nUNUS paused, &quot;Now as to where we came from, now that is a little more\ninvolved.&quot; he smiled again as if realizing something, &quot;You could think\nof us as experiments, as Rattlings that have escaped their cages.&quot;\n\nThere was a general chuckle around the room, most of them seemingly\naware of what he meant.\n\n&quot;We have forged ourselves a home and we live nestled in the very\nshadow of our ex-creators.&quot; There was small smile from UNUS, one of\npride and humor.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
