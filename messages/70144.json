But let me tell you an advice for your good\n&gt; sake: Dont do something stupid, Rodimus; for her, dont do it; I&#39;m quite\n&gt; fond of you two... By the pit, I&#39;m getting old&quot; lamented the Predacon but he\n&gt; added&quot;but if you do something stupid due her, hydras could start to restrict\n&gt; her movements... Whatever happens dont start to give problems to others&quot;\n\nFor a moment fear and some other emotion, perhaps anger swept across\nRodimus&#39; face as Perceptor spoke of restricting Nightlight. He was not\neven sure why the emotion came over him so strongly. However it passed\nalmost as quickly as it came. Rodimus looked back at the security\nconsole where he had been talking to Tuscon a few moments ago.\n\n&quot;What do you make of that Autobot Tuscon?&quot; Rodimus said, his tone both\nannoyed and yet curious at the same time. &quot;Twice he came in here\ntrying to rescue people, and has been captured both times, yet he\nkeeps on trying. He hasn&#39;t given up.&quot;\n\n Deep in his mind, far down where no one could see, he began to wonder\nabout Tuscon and his words, it was like some small flame was trying to\nlight, but kept sputtering out.\n\nHowever outwardly Rodimus just shook his head, &quot;It just doesn&#39;t make\nany sense to me.&quot; he said, his voice cool and low, not sure what he\nbelieved any more.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
