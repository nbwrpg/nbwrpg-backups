Her shoulder was about to fall \noff her small body.  She crawled to a tree and rested at the base of it.  \nHer body drained of most of it&#39;s mech fluid and her wounds becoming worse.  \nHer open side was very slowly tring to repair itself but with little \nsuccess.  She was beathing heavily. Sweat was starting to drip down her face \nplates. She had so little strength left.  She could hardly move after that \nlast blast from Transanulas. She tried to move but couldn&#39;t.  All she could \ndo was lay there and hope the Matrix would show her mercy.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
