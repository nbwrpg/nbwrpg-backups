Unfortunately, \nI&#39;m \n&gt; finding that, with th=\r\ne stresses of school and such, I just can&#39;t \nkeep up \n&gt; with the posts anym=\r\nore. Sure they&#39;re going slowly at the moment but \nit&#39;s a \n&gt; really big anno=\r\nyance having a commander as a character. Especially \nwhen \n&gt; they&#39;re being =\r\ncalled on 24-7 and expected to post right when \nsomeone needs \n&gt; them. It&#39;s=\r\n really stressful. Especially when I didn&#39;t ask for the \nposition \n&gt; and no=\r\nw that I&#39;ve got it I really wish that I hadn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t \nexactly \n&gt; expect=\r\n to have everything dumped into my lap, so to speak.  So, \nwith regret \n&gt; n=\r\none the less, I&#39;ve decided to leave the NBW.  I mean, it&#39;s not \nlike I&#39;m \n&gt;=\r\n going to be missed or anything. IR never really did much anyway=85if \nyou =\r\nthink \n&gt; about it, right?

No one needs to ask.  Though I would like to \nkeep IR, \n&gt;=\r\n if that&#39;s alright with everyone? She was my first character and if \nI ever=\r\n \n&gt; decide to return I would like to have her.  Maybe when school dies \ndow=\r\nn a \n&gt; bit I&#39;ll come back. But it&#39;s just too much now.
