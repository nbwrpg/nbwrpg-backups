She got up and looked around. &quot;Getting  somewhere \nis the trick.&quot; She walked out of the lab.  She checked to make sure \nher mind wasn&#39;t projecting. She didn&#39;t want Veratis to hear her.  She \nslowly and carefully, walked to the entrance of the ship.  Her left \nshoulder had stopped bleeding, but her rght shoulder hadn&#39;t healed \nyet.  So she left small droplets of blood on the floor as she walked \nalong. She went to the entrance and walked outside into the snow. She \nsniffed the cold air and started out into the snow.  The clouds had \ncovered the sky and it was starting to snow. She knew that with her \nnew form, she could hide in plain sight and not be seen. She walked \nout and kept walking in a northern direction. \n\n\n"}}
