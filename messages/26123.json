They scan and both \nselect squirrels as their beast modes.  One black and one white.  One good \none evil.  The warriors emerge and begin walking.  They are armed with small \nblasters capable of emitting a blade for close combat.  They are both \nsharpshooters by nature and by trade.  One has used his skills to become an \nassassin.  The other, an officer of the law.  They are twins who have never \nmet.  They have been hunting each other since the day they were created.  One \nwill stop only to aid in a war.  The other, only for the promise of power.\n\n::Mu::\n    He approached the remnants of the battle at the CF and looked around at \nthe mess.  It had little effect on him.  He was an assassin by trade.  Yet he \nwas still a Maximal.  He was a walking contradiction.\n\n::Nu::\n    She wandered aimlessly for a while firing wild shots into the air hoping \nsome Predacon would notice her.  She was only there to track down her \nassassin brother who justified his crimes by killing only those he found \nunjust.  She was also a walking contradiction.\n\n"}}
