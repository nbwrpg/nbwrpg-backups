The weapon and shield are a plasma sword and \n&gt; &gt; shield. They are both light and you should have no problem using\n&gt; &gt; them to defeat enemies. The plasma blade will become surrounded in\n&gt; &gt; miniature bluish flames when you begin to use it. When damaging\n&gt; &gt; enemies, it causes blade damage plus the bluish flames will stick to\n&gt; &gt; the damaged area, and cause excruciating pain, without inflicting\n&gt; &gt; more damage. The shield has a moderate ability to absorbe heat. Use\n&gt; &gt; them wisely, for your sake and mine.&quot; He chuckles.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swoop dodges weapon fire and the collapsing ceiling, then leaps into\n&gt; &gt; flight. He circles wildly around the small room, looking for a new\n&gt; &gt; target, but not wanting to hurt any friends.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
