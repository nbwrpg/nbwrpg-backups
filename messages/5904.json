She didn&#39;t recognize him. Her spark was \npounding.  she wan&#39;t a fighter and she knew it. &quot;Lunarpine proved that.&quot; she \nthought aloud.  She flew through the caverns and out of the cave.  She flew \ntowards the ice canyons.  She could manouver well through the ice \nformations. They are no worse that the trees from back home, she thought.  \nShe beat her wings hards.  She felt a wind pickup.  It was going north to \nsouth.  Blast,he will smell me if I keep ahead of him, I&#39;m too upwind, she \nthought to herself.  She cursed her luck.  She flew hard and fast around the \nice cliffs.  Her one chance was to outfly this Pred.\n\n---Original Message---\nFrom:&lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\nDate: Thu Jul 6, 2000 4:14pm\nSubject: Gone for three days\n\n\nI&#39;ll be out camping with family untill sunday, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to \npost.\n\n::Zardus/DevilDuer/Perndabot/Reptilica/Bloodystrike::\n\nZardus flies through the forest, looking around. He frowns. Something was\nwrong, he could feel it. He looks down at his hand, seeing that it was half\ntransparent. No! It was happening again.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be gone for a few days,&quot; he says over his comm-link to the Alliance,\n&quot;Nemesis is in charge untill I get back.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Nemesis. &quot;Finish the meeting with Panzertron. Try to recruit \nhim.&quot;\n\nWith that, Zardus phases out, ready to phase back in in several days.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn his quarters, DevilDuer turns around in his chair. He was not feeling\nwell. Stumbling across the room, he falls on his bed. With a flash, \nDevilDuer\nis gone (for a few days).\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot spins around, looking at the sky. He could swear something had \njust\nflown over him.\n\n&quot;Night vision,&quot; he tells his internal computer, his optics changing color. \nHe\nlooks around, seeing a bird. That was it. Perndabot lifts his gun, his \noptics\nwidening when he looks at his arm, seeing through it. He growls. Not again!\n\n&quot;There is a Maximal at my coordinates,&quot; he says over his comm-link, the\ndevice accidently transmitting that message over all frequences, then \nsending\nthe coordinates.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica and Bloodystrike drop off the energon they had mined in the cargo\nhold. Reptilica smiles. &quot;That&#39;s 200k of energon.&quot;\n\nBloodystrike growls. &quot;I hate mining.&quot;\n\nWith a flash, the two dissapear.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
