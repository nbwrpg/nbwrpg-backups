He saw\n&gt; Angel Prime, which looked a fire ball, head for him.  He laughed, knowing\nhis\n&gt; gigantic form was rather impervious to fire (as was the team member who\n&gt; formed his left arm, Pyro).  As Angel Prime struck him, he stepped\nbackwards\n&gt; several meters, but fired off three optic blasts at Angel.\n&gt;\n&gt; The gestalt&#39;s chest had a large (not a deep dent) dent in his chest where\n&gt; Angel Prime had hit, and it couldn&#39;t be told if he had been burned since\nhis\n&gt; chets was pure black, as was most of his entire body.  But he wasn&#39;t hurt\nby\n&gt; the flames.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Sixshot swerved his turret, firing off eight shots, two from all four of\nhis\n&gt; cannons.  The first six were intercepted by the shields.  But with a\nbright\n&gt; flicker, the shields disappeared, and were gone.  The remaining two struck\n&gt; the hull of the CF, doing insignificant damage.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark Wolf let out a howl, firing off three optic blasts at the\nCybertronian\n&gt; Fire.  The blasts struck the hull, leaving a deep impression in the side.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Double Punch watched as all the shots missed him.  He raised his pinchers,\n&gt; but heard a whistling sound.  He hadn&#39;t noticed the second missile\nSideswipe\n&gt; had fired, adn was struck in the chest, and hit the ground.  He knew his\n&gt; cloak was down, and cursed.\n&gt;\n&gt; He raised both pinchers, firing off two energy signature seeking missiles,\n&gt; one from both pinchers.  He had fired one in return at Sideswipe, and one\nat\n&gt; Torca.  He launched his cyber bee, Cyberline, from his left wrist, and\n&gt; watched the mechanical insect gain altitude quickly, its insect optics\n&gt; glowing a bright green.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Manterror dodged the missiles and most of the shots by going hard left,\nthree\n&gt; blasts striking his side and weakening the armor significantly, though not\n&gt; penetrating.  Though they did knock him out of the way of Grimmler&#39;s\nshots,\n&gt; but the Alliance member didn&#39;t even notice that Maximal was firing on him.\n&gt; He raised both arms, firing off three ion disks from both.  Three ion\ndisks\n&gt; lanced out at Ratchet&#39;s chest, three more headed for the Maximal&#39;s left\nfoot.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Injector raised an arm, firing off two stinger missiles, intercepting all\nbut\n&gt; two nails, the two striking him a little ways below his neck.  He raised\nhis\n&gt; free arm, firing of two stinger missiles at Torca&#39;s abdomen.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Bumblebee fired off three rapid optic blasts, disintegrating eight nails.\n&gt; The remaining ones stuck in his abdomen.  They were small and didn&#39;t cause\n&gt; much damage, but they did cause some leaking, which hurt.  Bumblebee\nraised\n&gt; both arms with a cry of pain, and fired off two stinger missiles from the\n&gt; launcher in each hand, four stinger missiles launching out at Torca&#39;s\nchest.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Ares jumped back, avoiding most of Ice&#39;s energy ball, part of the energy\n&gt; reaching the tip of his foot, but it didn&#39;t cause anything.  He fired off\n&gt; four bolts from his rifle at Ice&#39;s chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer saw IR doing weird stuff, and knew she was charging up\nsome\n&gt; kind of weapon.  He transformed into his bat mode, with a wingspan of\nthirty\n&gt; feet.  He covered up his animal body the best he could, part of the blast\n&gt; engulfing the front of him, but the blast was bigger than Nemesis&#39; bat\nmode,\n&gt; and the rest continued on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis dropped to the grown in pain, his wings sizzling.  He transformed\n&gt; into biped mode painly, the legs of his bat mode bleeding mech-fluid.  He\n&gt; stood up painfully, inspecting his wings and yelled.  They were at a 30%\n&gt; integrity.  Usually it was long in a battle until they were hurt that bad.\n&gt; He cursed as they were charred and black.  He held his wings aloft even\n&gt; though it hurt pretty bad, and launched into the air.  &quot;SCATTERSHOT!&quot; he\n&gt; yelled into his comm, &quot;Pattern Omega-Boom on the witch!&quot; he yelled,\npulling\n&gt; out a missile launcher from subspace and gaining altitude painfully.  He\nwas\n&gt; so enraged, he didn&#39;t notice the rest of IR&#39;s blast was heading straight\nfor\n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire itself, its shields now down from previous attacks.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot saw the two incoming blasts, one aimed at his head, one aimed\nat\n&gt; his propulsion system, which was in his feet.  He transformed into eagle\n&gt; mode, the blasts going by harmlessly, his size decreased by more than\nthree\n&gt; times because of the transformation.  He transformed back to biped mode,\n&gt; receiving Nemesis Enforcer&#39;s transmission.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Acknowledged.&quot; he said, moving his left arm to point at Tavatron, firing\noff\n&gt; fifteen explosive rounds from his automatic rifle at her torso.  A charge\n&gt; appeared in his left hand from subspace.  He threw the charge, which was\nset\n&gt; to explode on impact, at Iron Raptor&#39;s right side.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Unitron cursed as Hot Rod got a hold of his feet, and fell to his back.\nHis\n&gt; mind raced for a brief second, but then he picked up a familiar signature.\n&gt; &quot;Firestarter...&quot; he whispered.  &quot;No time for you!&quot; he yelled, raising his\n&gt; rifle and firing off three bolts at Hot Rod&#39;s chest, a single optic blast\n&gt; lancing out at his abdomen as he pulled his leg free and got to his feet,\n&gt; powering up his feet boosters.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Firestarter saw the unmistakable form.  How could you miss someone who was\n&gt; almost identicle to an entity that had nearly destroyed your home planet?\n&gt; Firestarter had been at that battle...\n&gt;\n&gt; He hovered for a brief second, then descending down towards Unitron, a T\n&gt; shaped hilt appearing from his personal subspace pocket into his right\narm.\n&gt; He pressed on the bottom of the hilt, a blade of flames forming.\n&gt;\n&gt; ==\n&gt;\n&gt; Chordate shook and yelled out, slamming a fist on the console he was at.\nThe\n&gt; main one was destroyed, and there was no time to fix it.  He heard someone\n&gt; enter, and turned, raising his laser rifle to aim at Hysteria&#39;s head.  But\n&gt; his scans said she was a Maximal, so he lowered his weapon, but kept it in\n&gt; hand, and took a moment to build up strength to answer her useless\nquestion.\n&gt;\n&gt; His face was caked with dry mech-fluid, and the numerous cuts were still\n&gt; bleeding.  Internal scans done by himself revealed that he had lost too\nmuch\n&gt; mech-fluid.  Though he wasn&#39;t seriously injured and it would take a long\ntime\n&gt; for him to die from his wounds, it was inevitable at this rate in the\n&gt; Maximal/Alliance battle.  Anyone who knew him wouldn&#39;t recognize him by\n&gt; seeing his face.  Instead of being proud, he was slumped, and his face\nlooked\n&gt; tired and worn, not to mention it was covered in mech-fluid like a mask.\nHe\n&gt; pressed a few buttons.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Shields are gone.  Hull integrity at 86%,&quot; he sighed.  The base shook and\nhe\n&gt; slammed a fist on a console, activating a comm. link to Iron Raptor.\n&quot;HEY!&quot;\n&gt; he yelled.  &quot;WATCH IT YOU BUCKET FOR BRAINS!  DON&#39;T SHOOT MY SLAGGING\nSHIP!&quot;\n&gt; he yelled loudly.  He wasn&#39;t in the mood for pleasantries, or these Past\n&gt; Earth Maximals&#39; countless screw ups.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tell me,&quot; he said, &quot;do all Maximals who stay on this planet to long end\nup\n&gt; being complete idiots?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
