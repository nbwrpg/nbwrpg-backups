The DNA scanner opened the panel and slid upwards, sending \nout an\n&gt; electronic wave.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::DNA found:: It reported, and slid back into the Pod. It clicked \nand\n&gt; whirred for a few minutes, then the lid cracked open with a hiss. A \nshadow\n&gt; climbed out, it&#39;s movements cautious.\n&gt; \n&gt; What little light there was showed a dark black panther, with \nsilver/black\n&gt; wings attached to it&#39;s shoulder blades. Her emerald green eyes \nglittered in\n&gt; the low light, and she darted a few quick looks around her to make \nsure she\n&gt; wasn&#39;t going to be attack or anything like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; A glimmer of light caught her Maximal mark, but she found herself \nwondering\n&gt; why she was with the Maximals. The last time she was here, they had \nbene led\n&gt; by Liono Prime. The bot smirked a little, and sat down in her \nPanther/Hawk\n&gt; mode, waiting a little before she could travel.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\n&gt; \n&gt; Name: Teltoli SilverWing\n&gt; \n&gt; Gender: Female\n&gt; \n&gt; Beast Mode Characteristics: As a Panther/Hawk Fuzor, Teltoli has \nthe body of\n&gt; a panther, with silver `socks&#39; on her four paws. Her eyes are \nemerald green.\n&gt; From her shoulder blades are two large wings, also black with \nsilver marks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bot Mode Characteristics: In her Bot mode, Teltoli is also black \nwith green\n&gt; eyes, and silver on her arms that look like elbow-length gloves, \nand silver\n&gt; ringlets on her ankles. She is very pretty, in a girlish sort of \nway. Her\n&gt; faded gray Maximal mark is on the outside top of her right leg. Her \nface is\n&gt; faintly cat-tish, with the two rounded ears on top of her head, and \nfaint\n&gt; whisker marks. Her black wings also stay on her back in Bot Mode, \nso she can\n&gt; fly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Weapons: The panther tail turns into a whip with a long scythe-like \nblade at\n&gt; the end. From her wings, come two long rapiers that she can use \nwith deadly\n&gt; accuracy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Personality: Teltoli is a kind, caring Bot, easy to love and be \nloved with\n&gt; all her heart, and acts a lot like a small child in the way of \ninnocence.\n&gt; But sometimes that gets her in trouble when she&#39;s in battle. \nHowever, once\n&gt; she is fired up for a fight, she will go down to the end for her \nfriends and\n&gt; leader.\n&gt; Her father was a great warrior, and taught her many of his moves, \nand her\n&gt; mother taught her others things, like healing with herbs when one \nwas\n&gt; running low on power.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------\n&gt; Teltoli SilverWing\n&gt; Panther/Hawk Fuzor\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______________________________________________\n&gt; FREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\n&gt; Sign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
