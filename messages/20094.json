Assembled before her stood Rampage,\n&gt; Inferno, Tankkor, Tarantulas, Paralysis, and Aerostreak. Quickstikre was\nhere\n&gt; also. Rat Trap remained locked in the brig. Besides that, the ship was\nempty.\n&gt;     &quot;We are going to seige the Allience today. I want everyone packed,\narmed,\n&gt; and ready to move out in an hour. Now move.&quot; She commanded, and the crew\n&gt; scattered. She turned to Quickstrike.\n&gt;     &quot;Subcommander, I want you to rig this ship to self destruct on my\n&gt; command? Allience stratigy is usually to go after the ship of the oppent\n&gt; while in battle. If that happens, I want this ship to blow up and take any\n&gt; Allience attackers with it. Understand?&quot; She said, not giving him any\nslack.\n&gt; &quot;I want it to blow a crater that will cover upto a mile at least. Any bot\nwho\n&gt; tries to take on this base, will die.&quot;\n&gt;     She turned once more, and looked around her old, battered ship with a\nbit\n&gt; of nostalgia.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Megatron, Hell Beast, Gremlin, Waspinator, Aquarious, Paddletail, and\n&gt; Adrax stood on the command floor of the cavern. Megatron told them of the\n&gt; plan, and they agreed.\n&gt;     &quot;And what is this I hear of a clone in Kitkats ship?&quot; Megatron\ndemanded,\n&gt; looking at Paddletail. He narrowd his eyes.\n&gt;     &quot;Well....um...sir....Nighteyes optic camera recoreded a clone of you\nin\n&gt; Kitkats ship. That all I...um...know.&quot; The Maximal said.\n&gt;     Megatron frowned. &quot;Well, she will just have to explain herself to me,\n&gt; wont she? Everyone get packed. We depart in 20 minutes.&quot;\n&gt;     Hell Beast shook his head. He didnt like this fighting thing....\n&gt; diplomatics were so much more cleaner and less tiresome. &quot;I dont suppose\nthat\n&gt; the Allience is willing to surrender under certian terms?&quot;\n&gt;     Megatron barked, &quot;No, they are not! Everyone o nthe double!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
