You all \n&gt; know my \n&gt; &gt;   first suggestion, here&#39;s my second:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Legacy dumps the poison, but it has a wierd affect on the \n&gt; nitrogen in \n&gt; &gt;   our atmosphere.  Most of it becomes Latent, but some of it \n&gt; interacts \n&gt; &gt;   with our bots sending them into stasis until a decade in the \n&gt; future \n&gt; &gt;   (our future 2012 A.D.) so the story of the continent of Atlantis \n&gt; being \n&gt; &gt;   destroyed in a day and a night was really the story of a couple \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt;   bots being put into stasis lock for a few million years and \nPlato \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt;   left off a couple of zeros because he didn&#39;t believe the Earth \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt;   be that old when we think a zero got added in making it 10,000 \n&gt; instead \n&gt; &gt;   of 1000 years.  But then they wake up in the near future and \n&gt; start \n&gt; &gt;   slaggin&#39; again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
