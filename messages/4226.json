She finds herself \nwondering when Scorponok will return.  She puts her feet up on the console \nand reclines in the chair a bit.  She places her hands behind her head and \nrests.\n&quot;Ah yes.  All in a days work. I wonder if Megatron would allow pink curtains \nin here?&quot; She laughed out loud about that.\n&quot;Nah, blue maybe, but not pink.&quot;\nShe just chuckled and smiled to herself.  She was proud of the fact that she \nhad found such a good base for her leaders to occupy.  She didn&#39;t care if \nshe didn&#39;t get the credit for the find.  She was just pleased with herself \nfor a job well done.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
