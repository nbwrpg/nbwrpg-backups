He pulled out a detonator knowing that a Preds greatest \nweakness was self preservation. &quot;I have a detonator over here, whats \nto keep me from blowing this whole place to little pieces?&quot; he held \nit out in the open for her to see. He wasn&#39;t lieing, he had a \ndetonator, he just didn&#39;t have the explosives to back it up. It was a \ngamble but he was quickly running out of options. His bag of tricks \nwas running low too. \n\nKitKat wanted him alive he wanted to know why. &quot;Whats so important \nabout me that you&#39;d let me live?&quot; he asked directly. There was no \nlonger any avoiding the issues there were only questions and answers.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She ran down the hall and turned the corner, following him.  She \n&gt; entered into the engine area. She stopped and sniffed the ground, \nHe \n&gt; was near, but how near. She waited a few seconds. Her clone in bot \n&gt; mode came running up. She sent the message for the clone to stay \nand \n&gt; guard the entrance. The fox had boxed himself in. And she wanted to \n&gt; take advantage of it. She kept her nose to the ground an followed \nthe \n&gt; scent trail.  &quot;OK Foxy. I know your here.&quot; She smiled. &quot;You know \nfox, \n&gt; I am curious about something. Why sneek in here and steel stuff \nfrom \n&gt; my lab?&quot; She then stopped in her tracks. She growled at herself \n&gt; remembering her oath to the little furball. She swore not to harm \n&gt; him. She growled at herself for saying something like that. In the \n&gt; future, she would have to guard her words more closely. \n&gt; &quot;Foxy, I know you can hear me. I..I gave you my word that I \nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt; harm you. And..&quot; she lowered her head. She said in a dissappointed \n&gt; voice. &quot;ANd I will keep it. I will not harm you. Autoguns, \ndisengage.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The autoguns dissarmed. She sat down on her hind legs and looked \n&gt; around she knew he was in one of the many rooms in this area. She \n&gt; sighed. &quot;I will not harm you or let you come to harm. I gave you \n&gt; word. If nothing else, I shall keep my word. I am a bot of honor. \n&gt; Despite how I feel about it. You foxy will not be harmed. I didn&#39;t \n&gt; fire the autoguns on you nor will I.&quot; She layed down, but kept her \n&gt; head up. &quot;I shall wait here Fox, I wish to speak to you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She knew that if he was foolish enough to set off a charge in \nthere, \n&gt; he&#39;d be dead, and so would she.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers ran down the hall with the Wolf on his heels. &quot;Turn \n&gt; myself \n&gt; &gt; over?&quot; he asked laughing, &quot;But I&#39;m not done on this side yet.&quot; He \n&gt; &gt; wagged his tail in the air taunting his hosts.&quot;I should be fine \nas \n&gt; &gt; long as they don&#39;t have autoguns down here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As if on cue he heard the familiar whir and click that the \nautoguns \n&gt; &gt; made. &quot;Oh recycled waste.&quot; he shouted as he put on the breaks. He \n&gt; &gt; slid ahead on the smooth surface and stopped about a foot from an \n&gt; &gt; autogun barrel. It didn&#39;t fire. That only meant that these Preds \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t want him dead yet. He scampered into the nearest unlocked \n&gt; &gt; door. He found himself in the engine room. A wrong turn but an \n&gt; &gt; acceptable one. He ducked behind one of the machines as the \n&gt; autoguns \n&gt; &gt; in the hall followed. &quot;They wouldn&#39;t dare fire at me while I&#39;m in \n&gt; &gt; here. he thought. If an autogun caused a leak in the engine \nthere&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; be noone left.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
