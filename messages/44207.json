A few things to consider: \n(1) Since you&#39;re using a timed mine, you must wait till the timer runs \nout for the explosion. That would mean that Azureblade could probably \ndeavtivate the CR chamber (if that&#39;s possible) and try to run (unless \nhe&#39;s a demolition expert). Also if that&#39;s possible, then he can \nprobably warn other maximals in the base. (2) The explosion won&#39;t \nnecessarily destroy the whole base; note that you are using a mine. \nIt&#39;ll most likely cripple the majority of the interior, or blow out a \nlarge hole in the side, depending on where the CR chambers are. (3) \nThe internal scanners of the Maximal base would likely detect either \nthe explosives themselves, or the electrical signal of the timer and \ntherefore hint to the Maxi&#39;s that something is going on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since you know that this post is highly illegal, are you asking us \nto disallow it? Not that is necessarily is, it just that you rushed it \ntoo much, the timer must be taken into account.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just pause the thought while the council has a short discussion \nabout it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Council members, visit the nbwrpg site, and check the coucil message \nboard.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Michael Coburn&quot; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Symphony/Hell Drak::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Symphony nodded, and said, &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll take care of him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Symphony looked in at AzureBlade.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry......&quot; Symphony said, as he deactivated the CR Chamber.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Symphony left the room.
