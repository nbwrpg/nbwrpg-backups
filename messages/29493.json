His instincts where alive, with the chance of\n&gt;Destruction. As he emerged from the foiliage he saw the cave, where the oil\n&gt;led. &quot;Grrrrr, Autobot in there&quot; yelled one of the heads, &quot;Yesss, and meat\n&gt;is fresh. Goood, me like it when he strugle&quot;. After the one head finished,\n&gt;it snapped at the other. It then moved in on the cave, closing the distance\n&gt;between him and the cave. He transformed and held out his grenade launcher.\n&gt;&quot;Autobot come out, and we kill him painlessly. If he does not, we have lots\n&gt;of fun&quot; he yelled at Condor.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
