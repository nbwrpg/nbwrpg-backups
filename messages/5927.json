She looked out and saw CyberShark \nswimming.  He looked so happy to be back in the water.  She was glad \nthat he was happy.  She transformed into her bot mode and flew inches \nabove the water.  She let the ocean waves splash against her face.  \nShe felt the cool ocean spray mist around her.  She liked the \ncoolness that the ocean against her face.\n\nShe flew back to the shore and transformed into bot mode.  She sat \ndown on the sun warmed sand.  She looked at CyberShark. \n&quot;You go swim and I&#39;ll fly above you.  If I crash, you catch me OK?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Dachande85@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::CyberShark::\n&gt; \n&gt;     He transformed to flight mode and headed toward the ocean. He \nfigured \n&gt; that she couldn&#39;t swim because anybody who has swam has loved the \nwater and \n&gt; wants to again (CyberShark only knew swimming bots, and I am a \nswimmer on a \n&gt; team). He neared the ocean and transformed to Beast Mode. He let \nhimself fall \n&gt; toward the ocean. When he hit it felt wonderful to be back. He swam \naround \n&gt; for a few minutes and then headed toward shore.\n&gt;     Nearing the shore he transformed back to robot mode so he \nwouldn&#39;t get \n&gt; beached. He walked out of the water and sat on the beach. He looked \nat his \n&gt; tail/hand, it was useless for swimming in robot mode. But he could \nmanage to \n&gt; teach someone.\n&gt; \n&gt; (In reality I haven&#39;t taught anyone how to swim, I&#39;ve just helped, \nso bear \n&gt; with me.)\n\n\n"}}
