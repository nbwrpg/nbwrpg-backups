Like a wave of swarm their disintegration beams\nblaze into the buildings below with a frightening intensity. As the\ndefensive shields go up and the missile battery opens fire on Scourge,\nlike killer bees on the warpath several sweeps fly at the battery, the\nair seeming to almost buzz with laserfire! The defenders at the missile\nbattery do manage to pull down a few sweeps, only to have a few more\ntake their place and continue firing. \n\nLord Perseus and the troops have a similar effect as they lay into the\nsweeps, their blasts cutting down a few sweeps. For a moment there is a\nreprieve as sweeps explode with a satisfying blaze of fire and light.\nBut then more come from different directions. It�s like firing into a\nswarm, you hit a few, and a few more come. Their attacks coming from\neverywhere above them and to the sides, laser blasts and disintegration\nbeams rock their fortified area, seeking to terminate those housed\nwithin!\n\nWithout any commands from Nightstrike and Darkfate the sweeps around\nthe Maximal base just continue to pound on it from above, seemingly\ncontent to keep anything on the inside the base pent up there. Anything\nso foolish as to step out of its doors face their cannons with a most\ngrueling intensity!\n\n\n\nIn the air above Scourge is only slightly impressed as the Maximal\n(Ravenchief) evades his blast, hoever it is the fact that he is ignored\ntotally that sets his nerves on edge. It is then they his proximity\nalarms flip on warning him of the incoming missiles. He chuckles, �Only\nsix?? They don�t know me!� With a blast of power he drops down to near\nstreet level, zipping between tall buildings, far more agile then\nsimple missiles. As several of them hit structures rather then him his\nlaugh echoes through the streets below. \n\nScourge�s laugh slows a bit as he realizes that a few missiles continue\nto follow him then. �Heat seekers.� He grumbles for a moment and then\nchuckles, �This should be fun!� Flying towards one of the large\nbuildings he peppers it with laser fire, setting it ablaze. Then with a\nmighty thrust from his hover jets, which put out much less heat, he\npushes to the side and around the building as the building which is now\nmuch hotter then he receives the brunt of the remaining missile\nstrikes. His laugh echoes once again through the streets as several\nsweeps meet him there and begin to rain destruction! \n\n\n\nIn the air somewhat closer to the shoreline, Cyclonus had continued in\nthe direction he was going, his jets flaring with power, the wind\nalmost screaming as it moved past him! As his own missiles exploded\nspectacularly at the railing he merely flew through blaze, with all the\nattendant dramatic glory, allowing the heat of the explosion to either\nattract Ravenchief�s missiles attention or detonate them. In either\ncase he rose high into the air, careful to stay out of the line of fire\nfrom those on the shoreline below, as the missles just added to the\nwreckage that fell towards the waters below. \n\nShifting to his robot mode, Cyclonus turned his gaze to the approaching\nRavenchief, his form seeming to almost radiate power as he floated in\nmid air. He is tall and almost regal, seeming to be almost made for the\nair boued as he was on powerful thrusters that took the place of his\nfeet. \n\nHis voice is deep and resonate, exactly the pitch and timber of the\nCyclonus of old, �Is this what you wanted Maximal?� Cyclonus lets go\nwith two more missiles, quickly the air behind them began to spin, then\nripple and finally burst aflame as they pulled away from Cyclonus and\nstreaked towards Ravenchief!\n\n\nAt the shoreline below Doc manages to hit one of the two sweeps\nmenacing him. However these sweeps are not jets and share very few of\ntheir frailties; they are made for hunting and pursuing hostile prey,\nand their armor is extremely durable. The laser fire smokes along the\nsurface of the sweep�s armor, leaving a nasty gash, but does not bring\nit down. The sweeps just slow and stop just over the edge of the water\nand open up with a barrage of laser fire at Doc�s position.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile from above several sweeps move down following Rodimus and\nkup, also opening up with cannon fire at the swimming and hopefully\nhelpless Maximals below.\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
