My characters could not co-exist in the same faction like that, ad then what? Make them act unrealistic? To keep them in character of course the Mafia would attack the Chivtrons, and then  who would I have die? As much as I like them, my Chivtrons would end up dying. It&#39;s not a threat, honest, I&#39;m just pointing out what would really happen.

Now, for the (hopefully) final commant on this:\n&gt; \n&gt;     First of all: Soulstice, that was just plain cheap. Its threats like those that make people not want people&#39;s chars in their faction. &quot;If you do this, I&#39;ll kill off my chars on your side&quot; is exactly what makes faction commanders begin to rely on your chars less and less, resulting in them being ignored.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Second of all: as Gunthers said, quit trying to predict what the Alliance is gonna do. You&#39;re all wrong so far anyways.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;     &gt; OOC: I did a poll. Want to vote in it?
