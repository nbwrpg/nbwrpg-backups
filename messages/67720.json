There will probably be some\nsigns of energy weapons and maybe some cartriges,  but this area is\nkinda shady and it wouldnt be that unusual. The fight was outside town\nlike 15-20 min on foot, so not likely any witnesses.\n\nOn 1/11/08, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC:  Yeah, that&#39;s right,  I they were looking for Blacknightmare,\n&gt; &gt; that would be the last place their scaners would have seen her.  A\n&gt; &gt; ways outside town.  They would also know maximals and preds converged\n&gt; &gt; on the area.  (this is like 3 months ago in game time...)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure who gets to do this, Airly, Nic and I have been sharing\n&gt; &gt; this area.  I can describe the site though since the fight was in\n&gt; &gt; Airly and my posts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any one who can give a description would be great! At the moment I\n&gt; believe my team is just looking for evidence as to Blacknightmare&#39;s\n&gt; location. Its funny my characters know more then me as a player does.\n&gt; Perhaps any obvious witnesses would be helpful?? I may need some\n&gt; helpful steering, and I will see if i can locate the old posts sometime\n&gt; soon.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and\n&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
