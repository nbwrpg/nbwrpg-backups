You think I don&#39;t know what you would do?  I know that I&#39;d \nput a means of enforcement in a copy of myself.  I assume you planted an \nexplosive device in me somewhere.  No, I haven&#39;t bothered looking for it.  I \nwouldn&#39;t be able to find it myself anyway.  As for your mines, they are \nimpractical.  Unless they are near the surface the explosion has no where to \ngo.  Any dirt with I certain distance would be forced outward and compressed \ninto a type of glass.  Thus the mines would only work if the proximity was, \nsay, less than 5 or 6 feet.&quot;\n\n"}}
