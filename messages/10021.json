Slowly he worked his way back \ntowards the Ark, He knew he had to make it back to the ship, he \ncouldn&#39;t die in such a stupid pigheaded way. He&#39;d promised Shadow \nWing that he&#39;d protect her, The wolf had to make it back. He took no \npride in his stupidity and he knew that Shadow Wing wouldn&#39;t let him \nforget it.&quot;Maybe death would be preferable.&quot; he thought, he laughed, \npain shot through his receptors. He wasn&#39;t far from Maximal scanners \nnow and it wouldn&#39;t be long until they could find him. The scavengers \ncircled above him, he could hear the preditors in the distance, but \nthis wolf wasn&#39;t on the menu.\n\nHe had promises to keep\n\nAnd miles to go before he sleeps.\n\n(Gold star for anyone who can say where I paraphrased.)\n\n \n \n\n\n"}}
