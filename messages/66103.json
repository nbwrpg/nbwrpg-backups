The ship&#39;s auto-pilot had steered\nright\n&gt; into the range of Earth&#39;=\r\ns gravity, and without a crew to guide it,\n&gt; conditions were now rapidly de=\r\nteriorating.\n&gt; \n&gt; Farelwave: uhhhh..... what happened?\n&gt; \n&gt; Farelwave, the =\r\ncaptain of the ship was now conscious.  He pulled\nhimself to\n&gt; his feet and=\r\n looked at the instrument panel which showed their grave\n&gt; situation.  He g=\r\nlanced around the room, seeing two other of his crewmen\n&gt; laying unconsciou=\r\ns on the floor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Walking over to his ship&#39;s pilot, gently tried to wake=\r\n him up; but\nwith no\n&gt; medical supplies, he could see no way of doing this.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ???: ...... huh??\n&gt; \n&gt; The voice could be heard on the other side of =\r\nthe room.  He looked\nover to\n&gt; see Cyphia, one of his technicians standing =\r\nup.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyphia: What&#39;s going on?\n&gt; \n&gt; Farelwave: I honestly have no clue. =\r\n However, according to this,\nwe&#39;re about\n&gt; to fall into that planet&#39;s atmos=\r\nphere.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyphia: I&#39;ll try to pilot.  I doesn&#39;t look like we have a lot o=\r\nf\ntime.  Try\n&gt; to divert power to the engines from other systems...\n&gt; \n&gt; Fa=\r\nrelwave: Right...\n&gt; \n&gt; The ship continued it&#39;s slow decent towards the plan=\r\net&#39;s surface.\n&gt; \n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of bri=\r\nng back this group of\ncharacters\n&gt; from my solo story.  I haven&#39;t done anyt=\r\nhing to this thread for about 21\n&gt; months, so I&#39;m pleased to announce I&#39;m b=\r\nring it back!  :D\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to read the last post, you can see it he=\r\nre:\n&gt; http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/message/63915)  Keep in\nmi=\r\nnd that\n&gt; that was before the reset.  I&#39;ll post info on the wiki when I can=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Farelwave (the captain), Tigon (the warden of the\n&gt; prison block), B=\r\netaspiel (a pilot turned repairman), and a couple new\n&gt; faces Rector and Cy=\r\nphia (both released from stasis only a few days\n&gt; prior).  Rector had been =\r\nthe 2nd in command of the security forces\n&gt; when the ship had been operatio=\r\nnal, but now he wasn&#39;t certain what his\n&gt; role would be.  Cyphia was a comm=\r\nunications technician, not only did\n&gt; she know how to maintain, repair, and=\r\n build communication equipment,\n&gt; but she also knew how to decode encrypted=\r\n frequencies.  However due to\n&gt; the circumstances, none of the crew were re=\r\nally performing their\n&gt; original duties.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
