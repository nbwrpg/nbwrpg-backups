More leary of him now than before. \n\n&quot;& the others with you, who are they?&quot; she questioned coolly. \n FoxManRoar1 [1:29 AM]:  He looked down at her his inner cooling \nsystem boiling. &quot;They are my men, on loan, and if you must know no \nother decepticon could be trusted with this mission, megatron and the \nothers would have killed prime, and the quto bots would have did like \nwise to megatron, if either die, i die, so i am the great equalizer.&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [1:32 AM]:  She somewhat cocked a brow. Though small, \nshe was still as tall & brave as she was in the past. &quot;That still \nsdoes not answer my question... Scourge,&quot; Stressing upon his name.  \n FoxManRoar1 [1:35 AM]:  &quot;You may have seen the black cats body \nwithin, he is Mirage the blue and white bot of the qutobots, the \ndinosaurs are the dinobots, and their Leader/king Grimlock, and this \nyoung one is my second and most trusted in command Quetzalcoatl, and \nyou I assume are Megatron&#39;s mistress?&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [1:38 AM]:  She glanced at the others, they were \nindeed different from last she recalled them. Both disturbing.. yet, \ncomforting to know others from her own generation there. \n\nShe then looked up at Scourge, but said nothing in response to the \nname of &quot;mistress&quot;.. it was so.. organic to her. However, in the \npast, she was something like that.. more of an equal to him... \nfighrting at his side or as he so ordered like a very loyal \nsoldier... \n\n \n EmprzAnastazia [1:39 AM]:  &quot;I am Maxima,&quot; she glanced at Mirage & \nthe Dinotbots, &quot;I&#39;m sure they are well aware of me.&quot;  \n FoxManRoar1 [1:41 AM]:  &quot;They have no say in any of this, I am the \nleader, they live because i let them, they fight if i tell them, they \njump if i say jump, or else.&quot; Scourge looked her over. &quot;Megatron \nnever mentioned you to me other then name.&quot; &quot;Your more feminie then i \nthought.&quot; \n EmprzAnastazia [1:44 AM]:  She nodded & understood. She never let \nfeelings show. Her supposed feelings for him was clouded by deep \nloyalty & devotion to him & the Decepticon cause. To prove that she \ncould be a great warrior. \n\n&quot;A slight... issue & problem with this form than I would wish. That \nis hopefully to be changed... IF I can get a certain Maximal to \nrecreate my old form.&quot;  \n FoxManRoar1 [1:47 AM]:  He laughed. &quot;Why not use one of our C R \nChambers?&quot; He transformed and stood before her as the Black 18Wheeler.\n\n\n"}}
