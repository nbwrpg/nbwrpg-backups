We&#39;re gonna need a diversion, to distract them a small\nbit.  Whee, Jume, and Skullgrin, you guys attack that area, and wait until\nthey come out.  Actually, Skullgrin, you attack that other area, so they\nhave two areas to deal with, that side and that side.  Then, Blindfear, I\nwant you to attack the entrance.  Meanwhile, I&#39;ll be at the back, and I&#39;ll\nbe calling in for reinforcements from the base!  And, just keep attacking\nuntil my word.  Oh, Skullgrin, Jume and Whee, when your attacking, slowly\ntake your attack to the entrance, so then you&#39;ll all be at the entrance\nattacking.  It may seem like they outnumber you, but in fact, once the\nreinforcements arrive, we&#39;ll do fine.  Then, we must move our way inside the\nbase!  Some Decepticons will stay out here and battle these guys, and some\nothers will start rampaging inside.  Now, let&#39;s do it.  Wait till I get\nwhere I need to be.&quot;\n\nTriggerhappy went behind the base.\n\n&quot;Now!&quot;  he said through comm, &quot;Blindfear, attack front, Jume, Whee and\nSkullgrin, attack the sides!&quot;\n\nSkullgrin nodded, and JUme and Whee did also.  Jume and Whee went to their\nissued side, and Skullgrin went to his.  Skullgrin fired some shots at the\nbase.  Jume and Whee also fired their weapons at it.  Triggerhappy was ready\nto ask for reinforcements.  He decided to send a message to the whole Dark\nAvian(technology, gotta love it!).\n\n&quot;All Decepticons, I repeat, all Decepticons!  We are carrying out\ninfiltration of Maximal City!  The ones here right now are Skullgrin,\nBlindfear, Jume, and Whee!  I request that reinforcements arrive at my\nlocation and attack as quick as possible!!!!!
