This is \nan RPG.  \n&gt; Not an e-mail group that talks about old toys.  So please, stop.  \nUnless it&#39;s \n&gt; about Unicron or the USSR.  Or voice actors from TF.  Or any other \ncool \n&gt; cartoons.  Pokemon is not a cool show by the way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Unitron\n&gt; KSLawDogg@c...\n\n\n"}}
