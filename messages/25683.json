Did they all want to be exterminated? He was \ntempted to order complete destruction of the Cybertrnian Fire and of \nthe Maximal faction, but that wasn&#39;t in his best interests. He had \nplans for the Maximals yet..\n\n&quot;Not officially. Exterminate any attacking Maximal, though.&quot; He \nreplies to Shokaract. He then opens a comm channel to Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;Tell your Maximals to stop firing, now. My troops are getting jumpy, \nand I will soon be forced to order extermination of your base and \nyour people.&quot; He says through the comm, ending the transmission and \nlooking toward Iron Raptor&#39;s direction.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl sighs in frustration as Necromancer opens fire on the Alliance \nagain. For a second he wondered what the punishment for disobeying \norders like this would be in Striker&#39;s old group.\n\n&quot;Stop firing!&quot; he says over the comm to Necromancer.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRepressor spins around, hearing gunfire. He aims his missile \nlauncher, firing two missiles at Necromancer, backed by two dozen \nlaser shots from his rifle.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Shokaract over commlink to Zardus: Zardus, are we firing again?..\n&gt; \n&gt; .\n&gt; Necromancer lost his patience with the situation, &quot;No you&#39;re \ndieing.&quot; he\n&gt; fired five fireballs at Shockarackt, smiling as the weapon recoiled \nwith\n&gt; each shot.\n\n\n"}}
