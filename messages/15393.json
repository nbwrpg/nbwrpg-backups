It was \nlate, and he could use a night recharging on his recharge bed.  About to \nround a corner, a figure jumped around the corner.\n\n&quot;Agh!&quot; Nemesis yelled in surprise, jumping back a yard, energy blade \nextended.  The blade acting like a lamp, Nemesis was able to make out the \nbody of Stalker, the robot Soundwave had turned into, only, Stalker&#39;s head \nwas missing, and in its place, was DeathStorm&#39;s.  That meant one thing.\n\n&quot;Scattershot!  You dolt!  I could&#39;ve killed you!  And I should still kill \nyou!&quot;\n\n&quot;Why don&#39;t you try?  My new armor makes me invincible!&quot;\n\n&quot;What?&quot;\n\n&quot;I WILL RULE THE MILKY WAY UNIVERSE!&quot; he screamed, running towards Nemesis \nEnforcer.  The second-in-command of the Alliance stepped to the side, letting \nthe other psychotic bot run off, cackling madly.\n\nNemesis shook his head.  &quot;Four out of five voices in my head say to kill him. \n And the fifth one is starting to concur with the others...&quot; he growled \nslightly, walking down the corridor once more.\n\n"}}
