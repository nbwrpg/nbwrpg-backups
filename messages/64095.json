She perceived a droning sound, monotonous and continuous, yet\nit was fragmented as her audio receiver were rusty and in bad shape.\nShe also had some tactil perceptions... at least, enough to know that\nshe was not whole. Some of her parts were missing, and that\ndisquieting fact was more than sufficient to make her panick. She\nstarted moving as best as she could, when a huge hand pinned her down\nwhere she was. She realized there was talking, yet she couldn&#39;t\nperceive it. Then, she felt something jab in one of her input at the\nbase of her skull.\n\nShe was being messengered.\n\n&quot;Easy now, Warrior. You are in good hands now.&quot;\n\n&quot;What? Where am I?&quot;\n\n&quot;Olympus Complex, this world&#39;s largest military base. You&#39;re being\nrepaired. We found you in many pieces, but don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll make you\nbetter than before.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thanks... I guess...&quot;\n\n&quot;Rest for now, Warrior. Go into stasis, because what is about to come\nwill be painful.&quot;\n\nAnd she sank back into the nothingness of the shutdown.\n\n\n\n"}}
