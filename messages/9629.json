She crawled inside and scurried up the vent shaft \nstopped.  She sniffed around and went down a side vent.  She didn&#39;t \nbring her scanner s she had to use her nose.  She followed the scent \nof the other Preds, mainly Rampage through the vent.  She crawled \ndown another side vent and found the bridge.  She looked through the \nvent and saw the main computer.  \n\n(I don&#39;t know if anyone is on the bridge of the ship or not so let me \nknow)\n\n\n"}}
