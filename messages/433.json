She had had her own share of torture \nfrom the Predacons, the end result was a deadly weapon that just didn&#39;t give \na nano what it killed...just as long as it did kill.\nShe snarled...*\n\n&quot; Get your butt back here! You aren&#39;t the only bot that has the scars of \ntorment on her body! I know what it&#39;s like, I have just learned to forget \nit! Forget it all!! I had to, other wise I would be just as you said, dead!&quot;\n\n* Carnage let her voice die away, weather Cyber Claw had heard her or not \nshe didn&#39;t know. But she knew how she felt, she knew all to well.\nBut Carnage was glad that at least Cyber Claw had been made as a grown bot \nand had only had that many years of torture, she hadn&#39;t been that lucky. She \nhad felt the wrath of an entire Predacon fleet when she was only 5, the same \nfleet that had turned her into the assassin that she was today.\nCarnage watched Cyber Claw fly off into the distance now she felt alone, \neven with Teltoli&#39;s company. Now she knew that she wasn&#39;t the only one that \nhad the scars of torture, but it was a pain to know that another had to go \nthrough what she did.\nCarnage looked back at the disappearing form of Cyber Claw...*\n\n&quot; Please come back.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
