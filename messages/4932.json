She leaded at him \nto tackle him, with her teeth ready to tear into him and her claws ready to \nrip into his sides.\n\n----------Original Message-----------\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Quickstrike/Cheetor:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Quickstrike pressed his shoulder tightly to the tree. He kept his eye on \n&gt;the\n&gt;Maximal. Cheetor shot at him twice. The Fuzor ducked over. The side of the\n&gt;tree shattered, and the hit almost got his shoulder. He could see the kid\n&gt;was scared. If there was a way he could get around to him and hit him with\n&gt;venom he might be able to end this faster.\n&gt;\n&gt;Quickstrike dashed to another tree, to his right. Cheetor kept firing. He\n&gt;even screamed at one point. Quickstrike paused, watching him. He decided to\n&gt;take a risk. This was one Maximal. There were at least three Predacons in\n&gt;the area, even if two were female. He never misjudged the opposite sex.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Kid,&quot; he called out and fired at Cheetor. A second later, as Cheetor was\n&gt;dodging and wincing, Quickstrike charged out. He ran as fast as his legs\n&gt;would carry him. His feet made too much noise to be able to sneak up on \n&gt;him.\n&gt;He plan was to catch him by surprise.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Maximal picked himself up and fired as he kept moving. He was only a \n&gt;few\n&gt;feet away. A shot hit his foot, sending him down, but at the same time,\n&gt;Quickstrike grabbed him, and dug the long fangs into his side.\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
