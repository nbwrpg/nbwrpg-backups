He quickly \ntransformed,\n&gt; and turned around. He put his hands out, and a beam emmitted into \nthe\n&gt; ground. Waves began to spray across his shadelike eyes. &quot;Hmmmmmmmm. \nThe\n&gt; valley is very dry, lined with igneous rocks, but there is a strange\n&gt; energy, that seems out of place.&quot; He said, contemplatevly. He began \nto\n&gt; walk forwards, towards Redhot.\n\n\n::Redhot::\n\n    Redhot&#39;s mind was in a fog. He drifted in and out of\nconscousness, \nalways on the verge of Stasis lock. He was faintly aware of someone\nor \nsomething approaching. It could have been one of this world&#39;s alien \nlifeforms but in Redhot&#39;s state, he didn&#39;t know the difference. Nor \ndid he care.\n    He tried to move his severly injured arm but could not. The pain \nreceptors in it had made it as lifeless as he felt. A quiet, \nfrustrated cry rose from him. It sounded reminiscent of Starscream. \n    Almost everything about him looked like a Decpticon seeker. He\nwas \nsimilar to Skywarp and his brothers, just a clear bright red with\nrich \nblack fists. The colour looked like it would glow if it wasn&#39;t for\nhis \ninjuries. His ensignia, battered and caked with gore, claimed he was \nan Autobot. \n\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n**********************\n\n\n"}}
