We are a nation of thinkers and mediators. Conflicts are wasteful to us. \nThey waste money, resources and more importantly lives. Why fight when you \ncan talk it down?\n\n2. We saw the war in Irak as an opportunity to get more petroleum so the big \nshots could continue screwing normal people. As it is right now, the cost of \ngas has recently bursted up to a dollar a liter in just a few weeks! \nCoincidence? I let you judge.\n\n3. Rumours go around that Iran put false information in US hands so they \ncould see Irak bulldozed, which it was. If that were true, US should be more \nthan ashamed of themselves and realize that being all military oriented \nleaves them with no head to think.\n\nI don&#39;t know what people of other countries think of it, but Canada never \nsaw any provocation by Irak that was worth a war and the death of hundreds \nof people. If no one else does, I beg that God blesses the good people...\n\nThis was my personal comment and hopefully the last in this argument. I do \nnot want any other comment that disrespects ANYONE, be they US or other. We \nare all equal on this planet and not even a president has the right to \nbullshit the lowliest person that exists.\n\n\n&gt;From: Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Fwd: Fw: Speech\n&gt;Date: Fri, 4 Jun 2004 15:23:42 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt;This is non-religious, so don&#39;t flame me...oh, and\n&gt;what happened to those bots talking to Fortuneteller?\n&gt;\n&gt;Note: forwarded message attached.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;Friends.
