Its not about who wins or \nloses, its about how many bots die, and so far more Maximals are down \nthan Alliance bots...\n\nAnd anyways, the Alliance gestalts are adding some power, but not too \nmuch. Remember, it takes five bots to make a gestalt, so instead of \nfive bots, you have 1 big one. While the big one is stronger, the \nfive normal ones can also do alot of damage.\n\n::FZ/Prowl/Perndabot/Repressor/Grimmer::\n\nFZ recieves Iron Raptor&#39;s transmission, not bothering to reply to it \nas he angles upward to follow Prowl, who had grabbed Perndabot and \nwas now flying upward. He aims his missile launcher, firing a glowing \nmissile at Prowl.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl hears Iron Raptor&#39;s thoughts, replying to them as he flew \nthrough the air. Perndabot had grabbed him at the same time that \nProwl had grabbed Perndabot, and now both bots were flying upward.\n\n&lt;I&#39;m doing fine, love-NOT AGAIN!&gt; Prowl adds as the missile explodes \nunder him, the energy field draining both Prowl and Perndabot of \ntheir energy. Prowl falls out of the air, his boosters cutting off. \nWithout enough strength to hold on, he and Perndabot seperate in the \nair, plummeting toward the ground.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ swirls to avoid his energy field, smiling as he sees Prowl and \nPerndabot plummeting toward the ground. It probably wasn&#39;t good \ndraining the Alliance bot too, but he needed to do it to get the \nMaximal.\n\nFZ dives, flying after Prowl. The energy from Iron Raptor&#39;s attack \nhits all three, speeding up the powering of Prowl&#39;s and Perndabot&#39;s \nsystems slightly.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler kicks Repressor away from him, turning to find a new target. \nHe fires two shots from his rifle at Manterror.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;FIRE FOX&quot; &lt;firefox_y2k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (Well, we&#39;ll just se about that... The Alliance will fall, or at \nleast hit \n&gt; the ground really hard:p Too much nonsleep^_^ I won&#39;t be home this \nweekend, \n&gt; but I&#39;ll try to post again this afternoon before I leave. Happy \nHolidays!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria/Tavatron/Rion\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria rolled to the left this time, and caughtthe tail end of \n&gt; Obliteratron&#39;s attack. She let out a yelp as she became airborne, \nand landed \n&gt; several yads closer to the CF. This wasn&#39;t going to work. She \nwasn&#39;t capable \n&gt; of damaging Obliteratron! Hysteria watched as the shields \nfluctated, they \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t hold much longer. She ran across the plains and inside the \nCF, \n&gt; skidding across the floor as she made her way to (wherever Chordate \nis):\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;to Chordate&gt;&quot;What&#39;s our status?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *****\n&gt; \n&gt; Tavatron flipped forward this time, over Scattershot&#39;s weapon&#39;s \nfire. She \n&gt; couldn&#39;t keep doing this, there had to be someway to take out that \nflying \n&gt; slag! She sent to waves of energy at him, one from each end of the \nstaff. \n&gt; The first was aimed at his head, the second at his propulsion \nsystem.\n&gt; \n&gt; *****\n&gt; \n&gt; Rion fell to the ground with a loud *thud*. He lay there for a \nmoment, \n&gt; catching his breath. He was so glad to see her! He couldn&#39;t believe \nit! She \n&gt; was here, now, on the planet!!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m *gasp* glad to see you too!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He climbed to his feet, balanced, and looked at Diana with that \nlittle hint \n&gt; of mischief in his eyes that meant he was up to something. He ran \nat Diana, \n&gt; and playfully tried to tackle her, like they used to do when they \nwere \n&gt; supposed to be practicing basic self-defense:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Betcha can&#39;t pin me!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Scattershot flew forward, firing off twenty-five explosive rounds \nat\n&gt; &gt;Tavatron, the energy blast striking him in the left side.  He \nslowly\n&gt; &gt;descended, but his mind clicked, and he ignored the pain because \nhe was\n&gt; &gt;psychotic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
