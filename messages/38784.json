We request our payment and would like it upgraded \nfrom 90 kilograms to 226 kilograms.  We also request a place in either the \nIron Fist or the Alliance Base where we can make modifications to ourselves.&quot; \n He ended his transmission to give Zardus an opportunity to reply.\n\n&quot;What modifications?&quot; Pyro asked.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s only for Breakdown and Scavenger.&quot;\n\n&quot;What?&quot; Breakdown yelled, Scavenger saying the same thing.  &quot;Why us?&quot;\n\n&quot;Because I&#39;m in charge and said so!  What&#39;s your problem?  You&#39;ll be more \npowerful!&quot;\n\n---\n\nScattershot sat in the lab of the Iron Fist and had finished welding \nSerpentor&#39;s head over his own.  Now he had Soundwave AKA Nightstriker&#39;s body \nas his armor, except it didn&#39;t cover his fame, which now Scattershot&#39;s newly \nrepaired head did.  So when he was attacked a whole layer of armor would have \nto be blown apart.\n\n&quot;I am no longer Scattershot, but Scatterblaster!&quot; he screamed, bursting into \nevil laughter.  He opened a comm. link and entered into the IGL, receiving an \nacknowledgement.\n\n---\n\nJaws continued swimming underwater as a patrol unit, working out that he&#39;d be \nin the Regular Division of the IGL.\n\n---\n\nPunch had had enough of pondering what to do and sent a transmissoin to \nZardus.  &quot;This is Punch at the bridge of the Alliance Base, requesting \npermission to enter the IGL tournament for the glory of the Alliance.&quot;\n\n\n\n \n\n"}}
