Why does a voice disturb me =\r\nin my own fortress?&quot; he demanded, his recharge bay springing to life. It ha=\r\nd prepared to disengage, several mechanisms primed to fire and literally ej=\r\nect him from the bay. A security shutter that blocked the view from the alc=\r\nove to the medical bay retracted, allowing him to loock crosswise into the =\r\nbay and see the console monitoring his guest spark.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nAn eerie silence=\r\n that hung about the vicinity; absolute stillness. No sound for a moment. B=\r\nut soon that silence was broken by a ghostly, barely audible childlike gigg=\r\nle followed by silence once more. \n\nAfter a minute, the silence was broken =\r\nby barely audible multiple whispers. \n\n&quot;Help me?&quot; a femme&#39;s voice was heard=\r\n in the eerie silence.\nThe fiery spark pulsed as it rose up just slightly b=\r\nefore it floated out of it&#39;s containment, passing through anything like a g=\r\nhost, as it floated towards Megatron X. \n\nRising vertically just mere inche=\r\ns from around his feet... his legs... torso... til finally the spark was op=\r\ntic level as it hovered there, slightly pulsing. As though studying Megatro=\r\nn X&#39;s faceplate; hard to tell if the faceplate was familiar, if it was read=\r\ning his meta-processor or observing for some other reason. One may never kn=\r\now. \n\nUntil the spark shot towards Megatron X, the spark disappeared into h=\r\nis cranuim. Within moments, the unknown fiery spark merged with the spark o=\r\nf Megatron X.. downloading or uploading or &#39;giving&#39; Megatron X memories, em=\r\notions, secrets, anything that most would not know unless seen from the poi=\r\nnt of view of another. That other was the femme known as Maxima. Flashes of=\r\n memories going back from last she was functional as a Beast Machine, meeti=\r\nng and falling for Hydra whom she believed was Megatron in some future form=\r\n... all the way back to when she was a Military Aide to Gamma Quadran, back=\r\n when she first met the real Megatron following a gladiator event.\nEmotions=\r\n, fears, courage, triumphs, battles, all those she knew, and more all left =\r\nwithin Megatron X&#39;s spark. \n\nAs soon as it happened, within seconds - thoug=\r\nh it seemed to have lasted several minutes - the unknown fiery spark emerge=\r\nd swiftly from the chestplate of Megatron X... and just hovered there befor=\r\ne him. \nWhispers once more, ghostly in a reverse echo, a femme&#39;s voice, dee=\r\np, soft yet with sultry malice, &quot;Iam-I am-Max-I-Ma-&quot; words overlapping as t=\r\nhough barely understoon. &quot;I am Maxima&quot; finally was pronounced over and over=\r\n as the words overlapped one another. \n\n\n\n"}}
