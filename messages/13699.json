But \njus6t before they exited the room she saw Gangon begin to abuse himself, \nalmost as if he wanted to end his life.\nBrightBlade had risked her life for him and she had maintained his spark \nwith her own energy cells, and this was they way that he repaid her�by \ntrying to kill himself?!\nIf she was able and beside him she would have gave him a good whack right \nbetween the eyes!\nShe just hoped that he would still be alive when she got back, because if \nPerndabot got her message then they would be leaving soon.\nBrightBlade felt a shift of weight as she was placed in the CR chamber, her \nsystems slowly deactivating for repair.\nBut she would get them for this, for shooting her when she was unarmed. But \nshe would spare that Rex, for his kind deed he had just acted out.\nBut soon�SOON!!�\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
