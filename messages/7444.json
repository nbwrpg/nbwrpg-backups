Not thinking that any of this was funny at all.*\n\n� Well, I DO think so!�\n\n* She was going to get her point across if it killed her, there was no chance in Hell that they were going to get away with this!\nBut then Nemesis Enforcer rising with the objects of torture caught her attention with a growl, her teeth bared and her shoulders squared. Though, she was hoping that he would not find the objects of his search at all. But now that he found them it was like ice gripped her spark, making her stomach churn. The look in his optics as he looked at her made her spark jump, the evil in the clear to her and anyone who would look upon them.\nIron Raptor pressed herself against the wall when she heard his statement, one for each of them! She didn�t like this situation, not at all.\nWhere was Prowl when she needed him the most?! Where in the Hell was he?!!!\nShe looked about the room for some way to get out, some way at all.\nIron Raptor struggled to keep her face either straight or with an expression of anger, ending up with a completely blank expression. But her optics told it all, how much she didn�t even want to see the objects in Nemesis Enforcer�s grasp. But she remained silent, knowing that he would tell them anyway.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
