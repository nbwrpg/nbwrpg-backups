But be careful, gestalts take good RPGing, so don&#39;t\n&gt; screw up. Also, Allied Forces still sounds almost identical to The\nAlliance,\n&gt; people could get the two confused pretty easily.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Prowl::\n&gt;\n&gt; Prowl&#39;s hands move to get a more confortable hold on Iron Raptor. An\n&gt; overpowering feeling goes through him as he feels Iron Raptor&#39;s lips\npressing\n&gt; on his own and her stomach pressing against his as she breathes. He could\n&gt; tell that she was excited by the feel of her body in his arms.\n&gt;\n&gt; He could almost feel the feelings flowing between the two bots when his\n&gt; internal computer&#39;s voice comes to life.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Warning. Object 50 feet away and closing.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Prowl&#39;s eyes snap open at the comp&#39;s warning, seeing the tree that the two\n&gt; bots were heading at. He pulls up sharply, barely avoiding the tree and\n&gt; gaining more altitide.\n&gt;\n&gt; Prowl turns back to Iron Raptor, his hands still holding her tightly. He\n&gt; grins.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Maybe we should land...&quot; He says before he kisses her again.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Find long lost high school friends:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4056/10/_/_/_/959315234/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
