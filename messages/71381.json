Perhaps he should have had\n&gt; a s=\r\ntronger door or better locks installed. As he was considering what\n&gt; to do =\r\nhe felt a hand on his shoulder and he saw WINGSABER, his old\n&gt; mentor and f=\r\nriend.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll talk to them, you just stay up here and try to finish thi=\r\ns.&quot;\n&gt; WINGSABER&#39;s words were warm and encouraging. &quot;Think of this as a\n&gt; ch=\r\nallenge to be overcome.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME nodded greatfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; WINGCALIBER=\r\n walked over towards TUSCON, RODIMUS, WHEELIE and the now\n&gt; enraged UPROAR,=\r\n &quot;Gentle-mechs.&quot; he said, his voice clear and\n&gt; authoratative. It was the v=\r\noice of one who had spent many years\n&gt; teaching in the Maximal acadamy, as =\r\none who had to bring many youths\n&gt; to a halt.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked at UPROAR and =\r\nWHEELIE, &quot;Is this how Maximals act?\n&gt; Threatening each other, stabbing at e=\r\nach other with words.&quot; Looking\n&gt; around at all those involved WINGCALIBER c=\r\nontinued, &quot;&#39;Till all are\n&gt; one&#39; Does anyone remember the words that Optimus=\r\n Prime of old spoke?\n&gt; Are we following that, or are we following the thoug=\r\nht of &#39;peace\n&gt; through tyranny&#39; or &#39;might makes right&#39;?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; WINGCALIBER s=\r\ntepped inbetween UPROAR and WHEELIE but he looked also at\n&gt; TUSCON and RODI=\r\nMUS, &quot;If we are going to coexist and live as a united\n&gt; faction then we are=\r\n going to have to learn to not let our emotions get\n&gt; the better of us . . =\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning to look at WHEELIE, &quot; . . . and we need to keep things civi=\r\nl\n&gt; before they get too far out of hand. . .&quot; looking back at UPROAR, &quot; .\n&gt;=\r\n . . or dangerous.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - Wheelie&gt;\n\nWheelie merely glanced back at Tus=\r\ncon&#39;s friends, &quot;You know, they seem to value you a great deal.  But don&#39;t l=\r\net them blind you to the better meal.  They will watch your back within a f=\r\nray, but cover your flaws for another day.  To thine own self thy must be t=\r\nrue.  But do not make them eternally watch over you.  For your weakness the=\r\ny cover, but you cannot expect it to eternially hover.&quot;\n\nThen folding back =\r\nhis arms, and glancing up at Leo Prime, &quot;And yet here you say, we have a bu=\r\nnch of ninnies who run every what which way.&quot;  Wheelie&#39;s chimes grew in mel=\r\nody, &quot;Funny, peace often comes through a gunny.  Look at when the Autobots =\r\nwere around, the corrupt little councril ran things into the ground.  So so=\r\nmetimes peace comes through a gun.  Tell that to Grimlock, I bet you&#39;ll hav=\r\ne fun.&quot;\n\nContinuing, &quot;And look at us here, how many vorns after het war.  S=\r\nparring in the past, to prevent another score.  IF this is what we&#39;re all a=\r\nbout, I&#39;d rather have my gun ready and out.  Because if we&#39;re about to go i=\r\nnto another fray, I&#39;d rather be ready than always at play.  Because peace n=\r\never seems to come, just the time to fix your gun.  We&#39;ll always be ready, =\r\nwe&#39;ll always have to fight, for evil and darkness will never go gentle into=\r\n that good night.  For evil wins, and terror finds, when those who are good=\r\n do not watch or mind.  For Autobots, Maximals, whatever we be, the war sha=\r\nll always twist to thee.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
