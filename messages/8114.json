This is what happens when you live in a town where snail racing is the most popular sport.\n\n* Iron Raptor nearly jumped out of her armor as she heard the sirens go off, knowing for a fact that they were going off because of them. A dread building up again in her spark but much worse then it had been before, knowing that if they were caught then the Alliance would have FOUR bots to torture instead of just two.\nShe sighed as she watched Prowl lean away from her, not wanting to part from his so soon but knowing that this was no time to be leisurely.\nWithout a second thought she growled and looked about the room, spotting the surveillance cameras that the enemy had used to get the drop on them.\nBut she knew that they had been cloaked, why had they been detected? With a second glance she knew one reason, both Tavatron and Dinobot were out in the open. The second was that the Alliance had used a cloaking scan to detect them, her own scanners picking up the data residue left over from a recently activated cloak scanner.\nShe had heard the groan from Prowl and wondered if he thought that it was Dinobot�s and Tavatron�s fault?\nShe hoped that he didn�t. Even if they had all be cloaked they would have used the cloaking scanner and found them all anyway.\nIron Raptor growled as she then removed her splatter gun from her back compartment and quickly aimed it at the camera, taking quick aim, firing and placing the gun back into it�s hole just as the camera blew. Now they had to track them by scanners if they moved from the room. And there could be an advantage for them if the Alliance did. For�not every bot knew about�SENSOR GHOSTS!\nSignals or images in which weren�t really there.\nWith a quick sweep of her scanners she came up with their enemy, slowly closing in on their position.\nHiss, Pyro, Scattershot, Punch, and a few more were coming.\nIron Raptor watched as Prowl took Nemesis and placed his hand upon the door mechanism, yet knowing that they would never make it out alive if they just ran.\nWith a quick sweep of her sensors she quickly located a network input in the far wall, knowing that it connected to the main systems of the Alliance base. Including it�s sensor programs.\nQuickly moving over to the input station she opened a small panel to it�s left and sighted the input port itself. The main port where new information or programs were downloaded. If she had enough time she could even misprogram the auto defenses and leave the ship helpless, but she didn�t.\nWith a sigh she then looked to the palm of her right hand, knowing that if anybot saw what she was about to do they would have a lot of questions that she didn�t know if she could answer.\nYet, knowing that time was running out she then activated a prototype protocol that her own creators had implanted into her main system, being a bot made creature she could interface with almost any system she wanted to.\nSo, then and there she activated the program that just might save their lives.\nIn the very center of her hand a small round section of her palm armor collapsed, leaving a small hole that was soon filled as a three inch input driver ( looks like the end of earphones that plugs into the walkman, only three inches.)\nThen with no time to spare she quickly slid the input driver in the center of her hand into the slot beside the controls console, twisting it to the right to lock it into place. A 3D image of the entire base and it�s systems coming up on her internal screens. Locating the sensor program she downloaded a code from her main hard-drive into the system. Creating the elusion of all four of their signatures heading for the only logic location of escape:the front entrance. Though, at the same time it also displayed their signatures retreating into the vents and heading towards it�s nearest exit.\nThere were over a dozen readings of their signatures heading in all different directions.\nThey were all sensor ghosts, none of them were real. Not even their real signatures in the torture chambers. Simply making it seem as if they had vanished and were now heading in a dozen different directions.\nWith a sigh and a lot of hope she logged off, her hand resuming it�s normal appearance and her screens no different that before she had began.\nIron Raptor then looked towards Tavatron and Dinobot, knowing that they had to get out of there none the less. She looked towards the open door and then back towards them, a growl in her throat.*\n\n� You heard him! MOVE!!�\n\n* Prowl may not be under her command but Dinobot and Tavatron were, and if they didn�t want an earful after this was all over they would get going!\nShe walked up to the door and looked at Prowl, a slightly worried look in her optics. Wondering if he knew that she wasn�t going to leave this building until all of the rest were out, defending them as much as she could if worse came to worse.\nShe would be the last one out, whether he liked it or not. It was her duty, but also because she cared for the lives of her Maximals more then she cared for her own.\nIron Raptor nodded towards him, hoping that he would understand.*\n\n� I need you to lead then out of here. Pick the clearest route and guide them to safety. I�ve perfected the scanners so that they couldn�t get a proper fix on us.�\n\n* She them looked back towards the console and hoped that her little trick would buy them some time, then looking back towards Prowl her expression changed to a look of determination and set decisions.*\n\n� I�ll follow up in the rear. Now, please. Lead my Maximals to safety.�\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
