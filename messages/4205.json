She got underneith the panel and ripped out all the wires \nshe could.  The lazar fire stopped.  She went to Vulois.\n&quot;Let&#39;s go.  We need to get out of here.&quot;\nShe flew up and went out a ventalator shaft and outside the ship.  She \nheaded to Hellbeast&#39;s base.\n\n---------orginal message----------\n&gt;From: minime_316@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Vulois is stil trapped inside the Predacon ship rafters, trying to\n&gt;avoid Predacon fire. He can&#39;t do it for much longer, they are getting\n&gt;more accurate. Than he hears the small whisper come from the batt\n&gt;Pred. He responds in a secret Predacon frequency.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;I would love to come down right now, but you see I&#39;m being fired\n&gt;upon. If you really want to go home, try to talk Hell Beast into\n&gt;thinking about my offer.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Vulois pulls out his other blaster. This could get ugly. He shouts\n&gt;down again to Hell Beast.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;What do you have to lose? If you don&#39;t take my offer, I&#39;m going to\n&gt;come down and start attacking wildly. Of course I will die, but I\n&gt;could severly damage the ship and take a few Preds with me. That puts\n&gt;you at a major disadvantage. If you take my offer though, all you\n&gt;have to do is give my friend and I a little promotion and you will\n&gt;have the most advanced technology on this planet, putting you at a\n&gt;great spot to win the Neo Beast Wars. This is the last time I will\n&gt;offer, or I&#39;m going to come down and reak Havoc on this base. Also\n&gt;I&#39;ll press this litle button on this machine, and whipe the memory of\n&gt;one of your preds, whoever it may be. Than it might decide to trot\n&gt;off and start anew, and than you&#39;re down another Pred. What&#39;ll it be?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Vulois sits back to let Hell Beast think about it, but than an\n&gt;emergency comes up. His regular scanners are telling him that some\n&gt;Maximals are taking the driver! He sends a signal to Soundwave.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Please, Soundwave, do everything in your power to keep that driver.\n&gt;Your new body can take the maximals. This whole deal depends on it!\n&gt;\n&gt;Than Vulois sends another secret message to the bat Pred.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Forget what I told you before. I need you to sneak out of the base\n&gt;and focus on the spark of Soundwave, another Pred. Some maximals are\n&gt;trying to take our ticket home! I need you to go help Soundwave\n&gt;protect it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Vulois sits back, with his blasters out. It&#39;s Hell Beast&#39;s move.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
