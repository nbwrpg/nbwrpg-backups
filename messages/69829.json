Discouragement, yet new h=\r\nope, guit yet assurance that what I&#39;m doing, I shouldn&#39;t feel guilty for.  =\r\nI&#39;m feeling a balance of emotions right now.. It&#39;s rather strange actually.=\r\n  I&#39;m getting a feeling that as I walk down a dark tunnel, I&#39;m beginning to=\r\n see a light at the end. And most of that I&#39;m feeling right here, right now=\r\n. Something is giving me hope and determination. I&#39;m feeling a power of inv=\r\nincibility, although I know not to be wreckless at the same time..  I wish =\r\nto be conservative but there&#39;s something inside me that just wants to explo=\r\nde.. A power, a very formidable power.  It&#39;s the power to be able to do any=\r\nthing I put my mind to.&quot;\n\nHe then senses a Decepticon signature approaching=\r\n he narrows his eyes.\n\n&quot;Lord Elder, I may have to get back to you on that..=\r\n.. I&#39;m sensing a Decepticon signature headed this way...  Now who would be =\r\nstupid enough to attempt an infiltration of the Ark all by themselves?&quot;\n\nOu=\r\ntside, Night Shift comes close to the Ark, and once again remembers to swit=\r\nch his symbol and signature back to his original faction.  The purple Decep=\r\nticon insignia switches back to the Autobot insignia, as does his energy si=\r\ngnatures.\n\nBack inside, Tucson now receives the reading.\n\n&quot;Ahh, that would =\r\nexplain it.  It&#39;s all right Lord Elder, I recognize the approaching individ=\r\nual.  He&#39;s an Autobot Pretender, and his name is Night Shift. His entrance =\r\ncode should still work for Ark entry.&quot;\n\nNight Shift stops at the foot of th=\r\ne Ark, and finds that his code still works to allow him inside.  He rolls i=\r\nn and then transforms inside the base.\n\n&quot; Sorry, long time no hear...&quot;\n\nTuc=\r\nson hears his voice, and slowly walks over to Night Shift, as they greet ea=\r\nch other with a friendly hand shake.\n\n&quot; Lord Elder, this is Night Shift, ou=\r\nr very own Autobot Pretender.  I just want you to know that he will have to=\r\n act like a Decepticon when he&#39;s around them, so it will appear that he&#39;s g=\r\noing against us when he really isn&#39;t.&quot;\n\nNight Shift salutes Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; =\r\nGood meetn&#39; ya Sir.&quot;\n\nTucson now sits down as Night Shift follows him.  Nig=\r\nht Shift also salutes to Kup and Elita.\n\n&quot; Yo, Kup,Elita, long time no see.=\r\n Rat Trap gave me the low down about Rodimus and a few others..  Sounds lik=\r\ne you guys are gonna need a serious pretender on your side.  Someone who ca=\r\nn get the inside on a Decepticon point of view.  Now, when work as one of t=\r\nhem, I gotta make it look good or else they&#39;re gonna suspect my sorry littl=\r\ne aft of ben&#39; a traitor. As I see it, you need a handle on that Shell progr=\r\nam Perceptor put up.  I might and I do emphasise might, be able ta go in th=\r\nere, make a copy of the program&#39;n send it back to you guys remotely.  That&#39;=\r\nd be the first step.  Next step would be gettn&#39; Rodimus ta take some form o=\r\nf bait&#39;n try&#39;n get &#39;em over here ta the Ark..  I hope Cyclonus &#39;n Scourge f=\r\nall for it too...  After all they&#39;re power sharks&#39;n whenever great power&#39;s =\r\nconcerned, they&#39;re gonna wanna be all over it.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;You have t=\r\nhe same idea in mind that I do.  Yes, go in there, as a Decepticon, go in t=\r\nhere as their comrade, earn their trust, and perhaps throw in a lie about m=\r\ne reaching the Matrix of Leadership.. That should really throw them off.&quot;\n\n=\r\nNight Shift points a playful finger at Tucson with a sly grin.&quot;\n\n&quot;Slag boy,=\r\n you are one sneaky bot.  Exactly what I had in mind but that little ditty =\r\nat the end, didn&#39;t see that one commn&#39;.  You got it, next stop...  Hydra&#39;s =\r\nplace right?&quot;\n\nTucson nodds. Night Shift looks to everyone.\n\n&quot; Yo, you guys=\r\n okay with that right?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;su=\r\npercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m not good at tolerating bad news, you pro=\r\nbably already know that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Not many people are.&quot; Lord Elder said as he=\r\n leaned forward to stare\n&gt; intently at Tuscon, his optics narrowing thought=\r\nfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What is it that you think you feel?&quot; Elder said, his voice qui=\r\net and\n&gt; calm as he watched Tuscon&#39;s facination with Optimus Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me=\r\nanwhile the voices inside Tuscon have gone silent. The connection he\n&gt; had =\r\nwith them is not severed, but it is as if they are listening for\n&gt; somethin=\r\ng, or perhaps waiting.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Sandy, please don&#39;t change your=\r\n character unless you want to.
