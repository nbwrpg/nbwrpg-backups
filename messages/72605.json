Tracking was not his forte, and\n&gt; for now he would remain mostly quiet.  HE was along for muscle, after all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whereas VICE GRIP was an expert tracker of some ability, for the moment he\n&gt; was not visible (and eprhaps unknown) just digging along over underground.\n&gt; Along with DRILL BIT, a few dozen meters and tracking the TRANSFORMERS up\n&gt; above by their IFF signals through the dirt, going past heavy roots and\n&gt; vines underneath.\n&gt;\n&gt; And WASPINATOR, flying along in the air, went very, very slowly.  While he\n&gt; was an agile and adept flier, the increasing undergrowth made him slow down\n&gt; heavily to avoid being bludgeoned.\n&gt;\n&gt; And so, as they found tracks, DINOBOT watched as the battle sight was\n&gt; analyzed by the MAXIMALS, waiting for further instructions.\n\n&quot;Well what have you got?&quot; INJECTOR, one of the FUZOR&#39;s said as he came\nwalking up, his right hand, more of a stinger than hand, using it to\nbrush his way through the underbrush.\n\nTERRORGATOR glanced over at him irritably, &quot;We have a second path.&quot;\n\n&quot;What is it, or who is it?&quot; SKYSHADOW said in a silky smooth, and yet\nstill somehow dangerous voice as he walked up, causing both INJECTOR\nand TERORGATOR to straighten respectfully, or perhaps fearfully.\n\nCRYOTEK pulled out a small scanner and oriented it on the trail of the\nsecond path, &quot;Curious. It is the lubricant from a sweep, several of\nthem.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
