She knew that she had to sleep more to regain her strength but she was puzzled as to why Prowl was by her side, but then again it was also obvious...he was worried about her.\nIron Raptor slowly slid her hand up from her side and then pulled the covers away until they left her neck and the flat of her chest without, but covered the remainder. She slowly turned her head towards Prowl as she then rested her hand beside her head, her arm bent at the elbow. She smiled a bit but even that was pained, her look still tired and weak.*\n\n&quot; What are you...doing here?&quot;\n\n* The question was simple and quiet, almost nothing other then a whisper. But even though her optics were tired they still were strong enough to express and show a feeling that was stronger in her then her need for rest, love. They were warm and welcoming, just as she always felt towards Prowl...the bot who had captured her spark where all others had failed.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
