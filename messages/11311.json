I have come up with an idea that will help out the \nPredacons greatly.  Since we were defeated in the last battle, \nMegatron doesn&#39;t think to highly of us right now.  So I fugured out a \nway to gain his respect back for all of us. I have the plans here for \nthe Cybertron Fire, a maximal ship, and the Iron Fist.  If we can get \ninto the Cybertron Fire, kill all the Maximals inside, and take over \nthe ship, Megatron would have no choice but to be pleased with us.  \nWe will turn the ship over to Megatron as soon as we take control. \nThen we can all go back to Cybertron.&quot;  She smiled at him hoping he \nwould go for it.\n&quot;Well what do you think? Don&#39;t you want to go back home?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Terrorsaur:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Terrorsaur stood up. &quot;What secret mission?&quot; he asked, but Drill Bit \n&gt; had already left.
