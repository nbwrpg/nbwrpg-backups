I\n&gt; don&#39;t really want to be in here for long. It&#39;s cramped in here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked over to Veratis, as she walked, she changed into full\n&gt; polar bear mode. She put her huge head just over Veratis&#39; shouler.\n&gt; &quot;What are you looking at?&quot; She nudges his shoulder slightly.\n&gt; &quot;I can hear Lunarpine. He&#39;s not happy. He thinks that with my new\n&gt; form, I won&#39;t like him anymore. Can you talk to him for me Veratis.\n&gt; tell him that it&#39;s not the form that counts, but what&#39;s inside. I\n&gt; didn&#39;t realize that earlier, but I know it now. Tell him that I care\n&gt; for what&#39;s inside him, not his outer form.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She hoped that Veratis could tell Lunarpine and talk to him so he\n&gt; would understand. &quot;Please Veratis?

He thought back to her, &quot;We have a bot on board\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have the immunities that we do. I&#39;ll have to keep you in\n&gt; the lab.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He studied the Dna strand by strand. &quot;It would appear that your\n&gt; halfling\n&gt; &gt; mode manifested itself to help you adapt. I&#39;m not sure as of yet\n&gt; whether or\n&gt; &gt; not it&#39;s permanent.&quot; he looked carefully trying not to miss a\n&gt; single detail.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Note to self, Inconsistencies in the IceBird form seem to be\n&gt; changeing, I\n&gt; &gt; have yet to determine in what way but they are deffinitely\n&gt; different.&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; recorded his notes delecately trying not to mince his words..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine walked around the ship as if it were a second home. He\n&gt; was still\n&gt; &gt; worrying about Ice. He feared that once she learned some control\n&gt; she&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; consider him obsolete. He was no longer the sleek new model he\n&gt; thought he\n&gt; &gt; was. She was the newest breed of thier kind. He couldn&#39;t stop\n&gt; thinking about\n&gt; &gt; what a mutant transformer would see in such a pathetic form like he\n&gt; had.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers crossed the hall to check the situation, Nothing seemed\n&gt; to have\n&gt; &gt; changed. He saw Lunarpine wandering. &quot;Problems?&quot; he asked more for\n&gt; the sake\n&gt; &gt; of conversation than concern.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Let me guess Foxfingers right?&quot; Lunarpine had read up on Veratis&#39;\n&gt; team. He\n&gt; &gt; knew not to turn his back on the young bot before him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ya and you&#39;re Lunarpine, I&#39;ve had time to read up on you too.&quot; He\n&gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; cocky little runt compared to Lunarpine but his attitude made him\n&gt; feal\n&gt; &gt; twenty feet tall. &quot;I&#39;m not impressed. That other wolf I encountered\n&gt; puts you\n&gt; &gt; to shame. At least she showed a little interest.&quot; The fox was\n&gt; pushing\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpines buttons and they both knew it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Slayer?&quot; he thought concerning himself with his failure to beat\n&gt; his former\n&gt; &gt; teamate. &quot;No he said She.&quot; the news hit him like a brick. There was\n&gt; at least\n&gt; &gt; four wolves in this war.

She was dreaming of\n&gt; sparring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with him as in the old days. She smiled. In her dream, he stood up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and said to her, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid Wing. I didn&#39;t risk spark and\n&gt; limb\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to save you just to see you brought down by a flu bug, we&#39;ll get\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through this I promise.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but smile.  She knew\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he meant it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She awoke a little while later. She yawned and stretched and stood\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up. She looked around the lab and wondered where she was allowed\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; go in the base. She hoped she would ba able to find something to\n&gt; do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Being a big bear cooped up in one room for days on end was not her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; idea of fun. She looked around and thought to Veratis, &quot;What am I\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do now? What will happen with these new modes that I have?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She felt a tickle in her nose and she sneezed. But in doing so,\n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; changed from polar bear into her halfling form.  She looked up at\n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wings and sighed. &quot;This is going to drive me bonkers. What good is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this half form going to accomplish, other than instill fear into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other for not knowing what I am.&quot; Then the thought entered her\n&gt; mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She had three forms. No one but they knew this. She could\n&gt; approach a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bot in one form and attack in another. She could also get cought\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; captured in one form and then use another form to escape. She was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finally seeing the possabilities of her new body. She smiled and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chuckled to herself. &quot;Oh wouldn&#39;t those preds get a big suprize if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they ever saw me again.&quot; she chuckled. She almost wanted to go\n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; battle, just to see thier reaction to her changing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Veratis spoke openly to Lunarpine as if Ice weren&#39;t there.
