The\nweaponry had him battered and bruised but nothing permanent yet. &quot;Projectile\nweaponry, I should be able to last long enough for it to run out of\namunition.&quot; The wolf ducked behind a rock facing that provided temporary\nprotection. He relaxed for a moment letting his repair systems handle some\nof the bruises. It was then that Shivahs massage came through. &quot;I can&#39;t\nspeak for the others but personally I&#39;d rather die and spread the virus to\nyou than surrender, at least then I&#39;ll be able to slag you again in the\nafterlife.&quot;  The former Maximal knew that he needed to buy time for both\nhimself and the others, &quot;Lunarpine to home, We need help, Where are the\nothers?&quot; He knew that there was a BIG risk breaking radio silence but as far\nas he knew Ice and the new bot were supposed to back him up. He didn&#39;t know\nabout the change in orders that Ice had recieved.\n\nInside Razor Claw forced himself to his feet, the shots from the autoguns\nbeating him like a prize fighter. The projectiles pummeled him forcefully.\nHe heard Ender attempt to contact Shivah, &quot;So he&#39;s working with the Preds.&quot;\nThe raptor knew from his previous protoform that the Preds were rutheless he\njust now remembered that they were willing to sacrifice one of thier own to\ndestroy one of the opposition.\n\nBlaze knew there was trouble when Shivah called to her. &quot;Silver Scout, stay\nclose to me and I&#39;ll make sure you stay safe.&quot; she wasn&#39;t sure if the mutant\nwas close but there was hope to get it out of the base alive.\n\nSilver Scout appeared seemingly out of nowhere when she headr the tone of\nBlazes voice. &quot;So whats going on?&quot; she finally asked wondering what the\ncommotion was.\n\nShivah had told her to stay with Silver Scout, the leader never specified\nwhere.\n&quot;Not much&quot; the Predacon replied, &quot;They&#39;re only trying to kill you and the\nother bots that came here looking for you.&quot; Blaze knew that the battle would\nonly end if the intruders were removed, alive or dead didn&#39;t matter. &quot;\nFollow me, we&#39;re leaving.&quot; She said matter of factly. The tigress knew that\nif they destroyed Silver Scout to contain the virus sooner or later they&#39;d\nrealize that she&#39;d contracted it too. There was one ace in the whole that\nshe could use in a situation like this. Blaze opened a private line to the\nquarters section...\n\n&quot;Bullet, I need a favor.&quot; Blaze&#39;s relationship with Bullet wasn&#39;t exactly\nfriendly but they both respected each others talents. &quot;You could get in big\ntrouble for this so I won&#39;t say more until you agree.&quot; She was aware that\nthe bull was already in trouble, she needed for him to be suffering from\ncabin feever. Toher advantage He was. &quot;Theres a bot near crew Quarters that\nI need you to help out.&quot; She was referring to Razor Claw &quot;I need a\ndistraction so I can get our previous guest out of harms way, I can&#39;t allow\nthe virus she carries to go any further.&quot;\n\nBullet understood but was still locked in his room &quot;I&#39;ll need your skills\nfirst.&quot; He knew that she had already arranged a few back doors into the\nsystem just in case she ever needed them. Blaze linked into the closest\naccess pannel, useing her massive amount of computer skills she opened the\ndoor. Bullet was now free to act.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, September 07, 2001 11:42 AM\nSubject: Re: thieves and trapped/Outside the BlackFortrress\n\n\n&gt; OOC: the weapons are a sort of machine guns\n&gt;\n&gt; Bat probes/Inside BlackFortress/outside blackFortress&#39;\n&gt; defences/Shivah/Kali::\n&gt;\n&gt; The internal defences continue to shooting against the mutants and\n&gt; several of those weapons appeared in the wall and started to shot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kali typed some buttons and a hologram of her appeared inside the\n&gt; room, the hologram seemed said the words that Kali said to the\n&gt; intruders &quot;surrender  and you will alive!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Shivah opened com link to Lunarpine &quot;perhaps is our turn to be\n&gt; diplomatic... &quot; taunted Shivah&quot;  Fool bot do you and your friends\n&gt; belive that Black Fotress can&#39;t defend itself of every sort of\n&gt; menace...? your stupid friends are trapped and soon if they don&#39;t\n&gt; surrender will die...

(What types of weapons are we dealing\n&gt; with?)  forced\n&gt; &gt; off balance the Raptor wouldn&#39;t be able to use his forcefield and\n&gt; &gt; transforming to Wolverine was out of the question as well, his\n&gt; speed was\n&gt; &gt; ineffective if he had no place to go.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elsewhere Foxfingers stayed to the shadows avoiding video cameras.\n&gt; He knew\n&gt; &gt; that his position was vulnerable, he also knew that he was getting\n&gt; low on\n&gt; &gt; toys. He&#39;d always been prepared for anything but this was one\n&gt; situation that\n&gt; &gt; even the best preperation wasn&#39;t enough for the Black Fortress.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside Lunarpine continued his Ballet of death (Dramatic isn&#39;t\n&gt; it?) On all\n&gt; &gt; sides he had something shooting at him. One by one he knew the\n&gt; relays were\n&gt; &gt; being destroyed and the only thing keeping the defenses from\n&gt; getting a lock\n&gt; &gt; on him wasthe dampner he was useing. The Bat probes weaponry was\n&gt; anoying at\n&gt; &gt; best, they were obviously designed as scouts and not fighters. He\n&gt; managed to\n&gt; &gt; pin one down for a moment, &quot;I tried to be diplomatic&quot; he said into\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; knowing that the Preds would be listening.  He leapt forward\n&gt; avoiding\n&gt; &gt; another shot landing near a swooping bat, &quot;I tried to reach a\n&gt; peacefull\n&gt; &gt; solution,&quot;  The wolf spun useing his tail to swat the probe\n&gt; harmlessly away.\n&gt; &gt; The furious former Maximal was nearing a state of rage as the\n&gt; welcoming\n&gt; &gt; comittee got ever close to him,  He snapped his head to the side\n&gt; grabbing\n&gt; &gt; another probe damaging the wing, &quot;But if force is the only thing you\n&gt; &gt; understand then go ahead and destroy us, Turn the virus we carry\n&gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; plague, You will end up destroying us but in the process you&#39;ll\n&gt; contract the\n&gt; &gt; plague and wipe yourselves out as well and eventually wipe out the\n&gt; whole\n&gt; &gt; planet.&quot; The wolf was exagerating about all of them carrying the\n&gt; virus but\n&gt; &gt; the Preds didn&#39;t know that.
