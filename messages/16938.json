She sipped at her drink.  She wondered if she would see \nbattle or get stuck here.  Part of her didn&#39;t want to fight.  She \nkind of remembered the maximals.  But only very little, more like an \nold impression of them.  But the other part wanted to fight.  To show \nthat she was a good fighter, and to make Prebon proud of her. she \nsipped her glass and then looked at the liquid in the glass.  \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ramulus?
