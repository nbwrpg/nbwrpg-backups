However as they stepped onto the platform,\n&gt; Marauder turned and the �balcony� began to lower itself down the very\n&gt; wall of the chasm, into the depths below them.\n&gt;\n&gt; The balcony came to a stop, depositing them on a level much lower than\n&gt; before. The air here was hotter, and filled with sulfur as well as\n&gt; other toxic gasses. The hall here was also large, its walls smooth,\n&gt; the stone so slick they looked much like glass.\n&gt;\n&gt; As Marauder led Lamia down the hall, different tunnels leading off to\n&gt; other areas branched off as they walked. Eventually they came a large\n&gt; outcropping of stone and rock, one that protruded out and overlooked a\n&gt; very large chamber nearly 50 meters below them.\n&gt;\n&gt; �Here we are!� Marauder said as he gestured his hand at the chamber\n&gt; that lay beneath them.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the chamber metal power cables running along the walls like some\n&gt; dark metallic snake, each of them connected to what appeared to be\n&gt; recharge chambers, at least ten of them were visible - all of the\n&gt; chambers appeared to be lit, but if they had an occupant it was\n&gt; difficult to tell.\n&gt;\n&gt; �Each of these chambers holds a soldier that will be link of the chain\n&gt; that will defeat the Cybertronians that litter this world like\n&gt; refuse.� Marauder looked back at Lamia, �and here we are at the\n&gt; precipice of victory.� He said.\n&gt;\n&gt; As they talked a figure strode across the floor beneath them, the one\n&gt; identified as Dirge earlier. He walked to the center of the room, a\n&gt; place where many cables came together.\n&gt;\n&gt; �Soon! Soon, we will be able to wake all of our soldiers, but now we\n&gt; will awaken the first.�\n&gt;\n&gt; Beneath them Dirge activated some sort of control and four of the\n&gt; chambers were lit even brighter as power was fed into them. The\n&gt; interior of the pods swirled with light and energy as something seemed\n&gt; to come into being within them. Then with a sudden blink the power of\n&gt; these pods shut down, the doors clicked and then slid open, allowing a\n&gt; single figure to emerge from each.\n&gt;\n&gt; �Greetings!� Maruader called from above to them. �Who are you, and who\n&gt; do you serve?�\n&gt;\n&gt; The first one to answer stepped forward, his movement all aggression\n&gt; and force. His armor was predominantly green with yellow on the legs\n&gt; and arms. Just the look of him was large and strong. �You can call me\n&gt; BARRAGE!� he said, �Because when I lay down my firepower, nobody gets\n&gt; up!�\n&gt;\n&gt; The next one to move is hued in similar colors, with giant insect like\n&gt; wings rising from his back. His red optics look up at Marauder and\n&gt; Lamia, �You can call me RANSACK!� this one said, his voice dark and\n&gt; ominous, �and what doesn�t fall to him will fall to me!�\n&gt;\n&gt; Another stepped forward, this one hued in supple brown armor, great\n&gt; horn like structures rising from his back. �What�s mine is mine . . .�\n&gt; He said as he chuckled �. . . and what�s yours is mine as well.� He\n&gt; folded his arms behind his back as if hiding something, �You can call\n&gt; me �CHOPSHOP!� he said, another slight chuckle escaping him as he\n&gt; stopped and looked up as well.  �And you�ll find out what I can do.�\n&gt;\n&gt; The last one to step forward seemed somehow more aggressive then the\n&gt; others, more sure of himself. Even as he moved forward, the others\n&gt; seemed to give way, almost as if they didn�t what to touch him. He was\n&gt; green and orange with what looked like a horn or stinger that rose\n&gt; from his head. �I am VENOM.� He said, his voice deep and powerful,\n&gt; carrying across the room, �and I command these soldiers.� At Venom�s\n&gt; glance the others, they each nod once and then looked back up.\n&gt;\n&gt; Venom looked up at Marauder, �And we serve you Lord Marauder, you and\n&gt; the might of UNICRON!�\n&gt;\n&gt; Above them Marauder nodded back at Venom and then the others, �Yes my\n&gt; soldiers, this is only the beginning. There are more that I must\n&gt; bring.� He smiled evilly, �Yes, more indeed.�\n&gt;\n&gt; BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
