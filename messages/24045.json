An energy discharge from Tankorr barely misses his back as he \ncrashes to the ground, skidding a few feet.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer dives out of Tankorr&#39;s way as the tank drives by, firing a \nmissile launcher after the vehicon.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther moves to avoid the shots, but his foot slips on the ice.

Thinking the worst, and thinking the end, he suddenly \nlaunched a \n&gt; grappling hook, the same hook he once used to pull the Axalon off \nof its \n&gt; pearch and into a watery grave. It soared into the air and sank \ninto a large \n&gt; glaciar nearby. Dangling from the rope, he glances down to see a \nriver of \n&gt; ice, one so thick it would most likely kill him if he were to fall.\n&gt;        &quot;Argh! Demise, I truly under estimated you...&quot; He said, and \nusing all \n&gt; of his remaining strength pulled himself back up. As he pulls \nhimself back \n&gt; onto solid ground, he can see the engagememnts taking place all \naround him. \n&gt; And then sees a pair of his back mounted crab legs lying in the \nsnow. Must \n&gt; have snapped off....\n&gt;        With missle launcher in hand, he aims at the large bot, and \nfires with \n&gt; intense rage that only a bot like Rmapage could house in his \ntwisted spark.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Inferno sees Demise coming, but he didnt expect it. Caught \noff gaurd \n&gt; he is sent to the ground as the bot tackles him. &quot;Ahh!&quot; He manages \nto groan \n&gt; under the massive bots weight.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tankkor once agian goes on a slow march to crush Endbringer \nwhen his \n&gt; stry missle nails him under his head, sending is tank turret \nspining and \n&gt; discarging at Demise. After his head stops spinning, Tankkor growls \nand \n&gt; transforms back into tank mode. With his engin reving, and a stream \nof mech \n&gt; fluid running from his know wounded head, he charges full speed at \nEndbringer.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Paralysis watches as his chest is suddenly scared with a \nthin stream \n&gt; of mech, and then suddenly the pain catches up with the quick \nslice. He grabs \n&gt; his shoulder and groans, dropping to one knee.\n&gt;        Aerostreak sees his commrad drop, and bursts into the air, \narms \n&gt; extended and two with two  shoulder mounted plasma cannons armed. \nHis jet \n&gt; gives a scream as he flys at top speed over to Paralysis, and as he \ngets \n&gt; closer he unloads three pairs of shots from the cannons.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Hell Beast, and Gremlin, ducking behinde a snao bank fire at \nthe \n&gt; Nightmares and thier partners as they approach.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Megatron slams his fist down. Tarantulas, Nighteyes, \nAquarious, \n&gt; Paddletail, Waspinator, Adrax, Black Aracnia, and Quickstrike fill \nthe Ice \n&gt; Cave as the battle at the foot of the mountian rages on.\n&gt;        &quot;Tarantulas, keep a visual on them at all times. Black \nAracnia, how is \n&gt; QUickstrike?&quot; Megatron says, his head filled with pain.\n&gt;        &quot;Hes still groggy, but I think I ought to go out \nthere...with my \n&gt; troops.&quot; She said, loading her crossbow as she approaches.\n&gt;        Megatron nods, and she departs. He wants to go out there, \nbut with no \n&gt; one to maintain command in here it would be to easy for something \nto happen. \n&gt; And he didnt trust the arachnid behinde the control panel.\n\n\n"}}
