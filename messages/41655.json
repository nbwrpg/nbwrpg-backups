Gamma was one of the most \npowerful transformers at the time, but when the time came to choose between \nautobots and decepticons, he chose to leave Cybertron and establish the \nGammacons. Their goal was to control the violence back on Cybertron. As the \nAutobots and Decepticons became Maximals and Predacons, the Gammacons became \nthe Tripredacus. Our goals have changed though, and we have recently \ndiscovered the power of the matrix, the source of all transformers. We have \nalso been reformatting our members because of the higher powers and \nunderstanding of the matrix it provides. It is a direct link to the Matrix. \nThe mission I command here is to gather energy for special research.\n\nGesper:\nBy the way, brother, we will have to contact lieutenant Daemos, for we do \nnot know where he has established the shrine. I have already sent a message \nto the Hellgate with a relay command.\n\nAstonished at his younger brother&#39;s thinking one step ahead of him, \nBelthassan was happy to train him as potential unit leader. If only he could \nbe more into combat...\n\nBelthassan:\nWell done, Gesper! Tell me should you get a reply.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
