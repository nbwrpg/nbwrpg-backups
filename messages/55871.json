You do not raise your \nvoice \n&gt; to me young one. I do not care who you think you are. You will \nshow \n&gt; the proper respect. I am the trainer here. You are the interloper. \nIf \n&gt; you want to play games, then leave and do your programming \n&gt; elsewhere.&quot; she said, growling. Her optics red with fury, and the \nfur \n&gt; on the back of her neck standing up. &quot;You will learn your place \nyoung \n&gt; one. In the pack, there is an order. And in that order, I am your \n&gt; supior officer.&quot;  She took a step back to recompose herself. \n&gt; \n&gt; In a more steady and lightly softer tone. &quot;You, young one are \nclever, \n&gt; smart and well knowledged. But you have yet to really learn how to \n&gt; use this talent to it&#39;s fullest potential. When you have, then you \n&gt; shall be leader. Untill then, I am still higher ranked. You will \nshow \n&gt; the rank respect if not the bot. Much like Hydras. He has my \nloyalty \n&gt; and respect. And I shall show that to all who are around me. You \nwill \n&gt; do well to do the same.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She turned and went back to the ring. Her arm still holding her \n&gt; stomach.\n\n\n"}}
