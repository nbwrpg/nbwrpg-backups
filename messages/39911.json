Yes \n&gt;   those \n&gt;   &gt;   were the days tons of moding but it was all good and fun \nbecause \n&gt;   many \n&gt;   &gt;   were expeirimenting and had no Idea what they were doing... \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; OOC: I agree. I never had the rules explained to me when I \n&gt;   first \n&gt;   &gt;   joined a year ago. I was new to the Internet and didn&#39;t know \nhow \n&gt;   to \n&gt;   &gt;   act, and besides that I started off as just a bad RPGer. Kyle \n&gt;   &gt;   Stewart, you start off as a good one, but with the same flaw \nas I \n&gt;   &gt;   originally had. Not knowing the rules. Of course, back then \nthe \n&gt;   rules \n&gt;   &gt;   page sucked, and it is nowhere near the grand spectacle it is \n&gt;   today. \n&gt;   &gt;   It&#39;s not very descriptive and informative. But back to my \npoint, \n&gt;   I \n&gt;   &gt;   moded alot without even noticing it, and did things very \nsimilar \n&gt;   to \n&gt;   &gt;   you, Kyle Stewart (if that&#39;s what you like to be called). I \nonce \n&gt;   even \n&gt;   &gt;   busted into a base and played around inside in one post \nbecause I \n&gt;   was \n&gt;   &gt;   bored, and didn&#39;t know what I did wrong until months later!...\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   From: robertdahl \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 1:45 PM\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Subject: Re: Kyle Stewart\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   OOC: Cool of Legendarynemasis. He&#39;s new, and it takes a \nwhile \n&gt;   to \n&gt;   &gt;   get the\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   rules, you above all should know that. Now you said that \nyour \n&gt;   a \n&gt;   &gt;   hot\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   head, so you should know it&#39;s not smart to go off yelling \nat \n&gt;   &gt;   people.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Kyle, don&#39;t worry, everyone&#39;s moded once or twice, but \nwe&#39;ve \n&gt;   just\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   learned from our mistake.
