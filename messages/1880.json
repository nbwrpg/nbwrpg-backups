And I&#39;m sorry.\n&gt; You see, you do such a good with your characters the I just wanted to try\none out. I wouldn&#39;t touch Dinobot, you do too good of a job with him. But I\njust wanted to try one out. I know that this&#39;ll be a mark against me and I&#39;m\nsorry. I&#39;ll ask you next time. (Not to mention that I&#39;m half asleep right\nnow.But that&#39;s no real excuse.)\n&gt; And I apologize to all of the NBWers out there about the last post I sent,\ndo what Carnage said and just delete it. I&#39;m sorry, again.\n&gt; I&#39;ll post my own character now.\n&gt;\n&gt;                                    I.R.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
