She had tried hard to not make the situation\n&gt; appear too severe.  Yet she didn&#39;t quite appreciate the fact that Leo\n&gt; Prime&#39;s voice sounded a bit ominous.  She goes to Leo but with a bit of a\n&gt; serious expression on her face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Leo, please, I think Elita might&#39;ve picked up on your tone of voice.  We\n&gt; know how serious the situation is but try explaining that to a little girl\n&gt; who misses her parents so much that it breaks her heart just at the\n&gt; mention of something as horrible as this.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She looks up to him with a look of desperation.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Please, try not ta send any negative statements if she&#39;s around?&quot;\n\n\n&gt; Elita: Elita hugged Talon\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME looked over at ELITA and then at TALON and STRIGHTSHOT,\nclearly not the most comfortable around one so young.
