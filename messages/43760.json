You see, I would be =\r\nvery valuable to your forces.  I am without my own faction, but I am probab=\r\nly one of the most powerful bots in the universe, next to Unicron.  I posse=\r\nss information of every faction and know this planet like the back of my ha=\r\nnd.  Not only that, I have amazing weapons and technology in my hands.  Tog=\r\nether, we could rule this planet and many others with an iron fist!  As a m=\r\natter of fact, I have a little gadget I&#39;ve developed, and I have a number o=\r\nf them, which may recruit us more bots.  Do you accept my offer?&quot;\n\nDecadel =\r\nlooked at the robotic worm he had in his hand.  He once had a few slaves by=\r\n using them, but things had changed.
