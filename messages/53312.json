I figured that. Just wanted to verify.\n&gt; \n&gt; IC: \n&gt; \n&gt; Placed the shuttle upon Automatic for a moment as she went over to \nanother \n&gt; computer to analyze the data she gain after making a brief hack \ninto the \n&gt; memory core. Plus her little run in with Alpha Trion & Vector Sigma \ngave her \n&gt; a little insight. But .. not much. \n&gt; \n&gt; She gazed at the screen after entering the information. According \nto records, \n&gt; several were run off of Cybertron & to... \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Earth,&quot; she was stunned to see the information. \n&gt; \n&gt; Moving back over to the controls, she punched in the coordinate for \nEarth. \n&gt; \n&gt; **************************\n&gt; After some time of space flight, the shuttle neared Earth. Maxima \nwalked \n&gt; towards the controls-\n&gt; \n&gt; SKKREEE!! SSKKREEEEEEE!!!SSKKREEEE!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; The ship shuddered as the alarms sounded. She stumbled as she made \nher way to \n&gt; the controls quickly. Feverishly moving over the controls to regain \nthe ship, \n&gt; she noticed that an energy reading ahead of her was off the charts. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What the-&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A bright flash of light... energy coursed through the ship as it \nshocked her. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ahhhh!&quot; the blue bolts stunned her, knocking her from the seat \nnext to the \n&gt; controls to the floor.. she fell inconscious/offline soon there \nafter. \n&gt; \n&gt; ****************************\n&gt; \n&gt; The Cybertronian shuttle appeared in Prehistoric Earth&#39;s orbit. It \ntumbled \n&gt; for a while, then it streaked towards Earth as it was pulled by the \ngravity \n&gt; of the planet. \n&gt; \n&gt; Over the skies, a fireball was seen as the shuttle was burning up \nupon entry, \n&gt; eventually crashing into the body of land that would become the \nNorth \n&gt; America. \n&gt; \n&gt; The ship smoked, the only passenger inside was offiline & \nunconscious. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I leave it up to who ever wishes to discover her first.\n\n\n"}}
