The duo never intended to walk\n&gt; in on a creature as large as Hydras, nor did they expect to see anything\n&gt; similar in species.  Although the dragon never made any motions to harm\n&gt; them, it was to them, still cause of alarm.  The sound of Quickstride&#39;s\n&gt; hooves grabs Tucson&#39;s attention as well, since he had already been awakened\n&gt; by his dream.  Quietly he makes his way out of the room and finds his way to\n&gt; the severely terrified duo.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Leo, Rodimus, I&#39;m with Quickstride and Straight Shot now.  Meet me near the\n&gt; CR chamber room.   Whatever sent them into a panic has to be big, very big.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;On my way.&quot; LEO PRIME said, his voice rough and choppy. From the\nsound of it he already in motion.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Quickstride, Straightshot, Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride comes to a short stop in front of Tucson, not expecting to see\n&gt; him either.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; HEY!  You&#39;re supposed ta be in CR!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson tries to calm the spooked stallion.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Shhh.  I know, it&#39;s all right, I woke up on my own.  Now, what happened?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to her brother.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We went to survey the construction site for the wind turbine and we went\n&gt; into the cave where the turbine is gonna be installed...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride now speaks up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; At first it looked deserted, but well.. It&#39;s not. It has a tenant, a very\n&gt; big tenant&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot struggles to keep her composure.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We heard this grumbling noise that actually vibrated the cave and no\n&gt; sooner did we hear it, out comes this huge reptilian animal covered with\n&gt; silver scales and large wings, and a really long tail.  We didn&#39;t hang\n&gt; around long enough ta find out if it was dangerous or not.  All we knew, it\n&gt; was enormous, had the same features as Hydras, but with only one head and it\n&gt; had really big teeth and claws.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson stumbles back in surprise.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You - just described something I saw in a dream I just woke up from.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The duo stare at him in shock.  Neither one of them able to move or speak.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;And what do you suppose this means?&quot; LEO PRIME said as he tranformed\ninto robot mode. &quot;Do you think that this reptile is connected to your\ndream?&quot;\n\nWING CALIBER transformed and landed next to LEO, &quot;There are some who\nput great stock in dreams.&quot;\n\nA call comes in from RODIMUS PRIME. &quot;I have arrived at the location\nQuickstride and Straight Shot were calling from. My sensors are\npicking up the signs of some reptile, and man is it big! I am\ninvestigating.&quot;\n\n&quot;Rodimus&quot; LEP PRIME said firmly, &quot;Be careful. We don&#39;t what that thing is yet.&quot;\n\n&quot;I gothcha.&quot; RODIMUS said as he signed off.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
