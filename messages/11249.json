He \nwants to rule the universe.  I can&#39;t blame him for that. It&#39;s in his \nprogramming to be a great leader.  But, I...I...I just can&#39;t betray \nhim, even for my own good. it&#39;s in my programming.  I can&#39;t just not \nobay him. Everything I do is for him. I know I can take the ship, and \nmaybe even leave Megatron behind. But I can&#39;t just do that to him.  \nSure I get mad at him, but he is still my leader.&quot; she looked at the \nfloor feeling at a loss.  She was a pred who wanted what every other \nPred wanted, to get rich, destroy the maximals and all those who \nstood in their way, to follow orders from thier leader.  But, now, \nshe was starting to question everything.  She had never faultered or \nwavered from her programming before. Now, she was finding trouble \nwith every thought that entered her mind. She turned and looked at \nthe others.  She knew she had to be strong for them.  Now she felt, \nnot like that warrior and strong guide like she was used to, but like \na wolf pup who couldn&#39;t make up her mind on anything.  She suddenly \nfelt vulnerable.  She gave a brave smiled to the group.\n\n&quot;I have some things to attend to.  I shall need your help, Time Bomb, \nLand Mine, Etchingar, Please make diagrams of all ideas you come up \nwith for entering the base.  Any other ideas on weapons, like the \nliquid energon that Drillbit came up with, anything that you think \nof, write it down, draw it up and I&#39;ll look at all of them in a \nlittle while. This will be a team effort.  And it will take everyone \nin the team to make this work.&quot;\n\nShe turned to Phobia,&quot;Please see me in my quarters, we can talk \nthere.&quot;  She turned and walked out of the room and to her quarters.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Megatron wouldn&#39;t be happy&quot; Phobia said, all eight eyes on Kit Kat.\n&gt; &quot;Megatron wants all power for himself, you take this ship and he \nwill feel\n&gt; out foxxed by a wolf.&quot; the words weren&#39;t meant to sound so odd but \nthey were\n&gt; true. &quot;If you did something that he took credit for then he \nwouldn&#39;t settle\n&gt; for council status, he would attempt to overthrow the council.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; he put his arm around KitKats shoulder &quot;You know where you would be \nstuck in\n&gt; that hopeless war. Don&#39;t you?&quot; his beedy little eyes focused on \nhers.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
