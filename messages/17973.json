You invited me to join you in a mission to \nreturn to Cybertron. Then You and another bot spoke of betraying Hell \nBeast.  Hell Beast and his cronees came in and opened fire on us.  I \nfled and you and that other bot were killed. But the Matrix brought \nyou back.  You came back with a mission, to bring peace to all the \ngroups, Maximals and Predacons.  You found me.  I knelt down infront \nof you and cried, begging for forgiveness.&quot; She motioned with her arm \nat Cybershark. &quot;He joined you and then I did, we became part of a \ngroup who wanted to bring the leaders of all the groups together in \none place, your embassy.  You sent me to the Cybertron Fire to talk \nto the maximal leaders. Cybershark was sent to recruit the Predacons. \nBut it never happened. The Predacons wouldn&#39;t hear of such a thing. \nThe Maximals were interested, but then you left the embassy and went \nelsewhere.  I was changed into an Allince member when I was still on \nthe Cybertron fire by a bot named Feline.  You returned and found me \nin my state as I am now. You talked of leaving this place and \nreturning to Cybertron. But you were captured and changed into an \nAllience member.&quot; She stopped and closed her eyes a moment.  A small \ntear ran down her cheek. &quot;When you were changed, all the things that \nI once had believed in died. Now we fight for a new cause, not for \npeace, but to help the Allience win the war. I now want the Allince \nto win the war. Peace will never come untill that has happened.&quot;\n\nHer old programs that wanted peace were revived, but couldn&#39;t take \nfull effect untill the chip which Feline had placed in her was \nremoved. \n\nShe turned and spread her wings, she then flew off into the cave.  \nShe flew deep into the shadows and hung, upside down on the ceiling.  \nShe had a view of the entrance and still could see Cybershark and \nVulios standing outside.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois sat in the tree thinking, when another flash hit him. This \n&gt; time he was stuck in some sort of venting system, and he was \ntalking \n&gt; to someone below. When he looked closer, he saw that it was the bat \n&gt; girl again! What did she have to do with his life? He heard her \nyell \n&gt; back to him, and he immediatly flew back to the cave. He saw \nanother \n&gt; bot there, but introductions would come later. He needed answers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thank You for forgiving me. But I need you to answer my question. \n&gt; What do you know about my past life?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
