I&#39;d like to meet t=\r\nhis \nnewcomer, what did you say his name wa--&quot; He is cut off as Hoist \ninte=\r\nrrupts him.\n\n&quot;Pacifix, I&#39;ve abnormal atmospheric readings coming from the l=\r\nong \nrange sensors... It looks like, like a pod is landing. We&#39;d better \nch=\r\neck it out.&quot; Hoist flickers in anticipation as he relays this new \ninformat=\r\nion to Pacifix. &quot;Several of our sensors are still offline, \nand I can&#39;t det=\r\nermine what faction his aligned with; pray it&#39;s not \nhostile...&quot; He trails =\r\noff.\n\n&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Pacifix gets up, and exits his quarters. &quot;Artemis, get back \n=\r\nas fast as you can. Pacifix out.&quot; He reasures himself, &quot;I&#39;ll check \nit out.=\r\n Where did it land?&quot; He continues towards the exit, now at \nwalking briskly=\r\n.\n\n&quot;Well, it&#39;s, err, within visible range of the base,&quot; He \npauses, &quot;Estima=\r\nted 800 metres and closing.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hostile or not... we shall see.&quot; Pacifix mur=\r\nmurs to nobody in \nparticular as he exits the base. He arms his right freez=\r\ne cannon and \nlooks off in the distance where the bot is supposed to be loc=\r\nated.\n\nImmediately he spots a large cloud of dust, and a large greyish form=\r\n \nadvancing at an alarming rate in the center of it. He quickly opens \na br=\r\noadband, short range comm to all frequencies, &quot;This is Commander \nPacifix o=\r\nf the Autobot Earth Mission, state your name and faction.&quot; \nOff comm he arm=\r\ns the laser turrets &quot;Laser turrets online.&quot; 5 laser \nturrets hidden along t=\r\nhe sides of the surrounding mountains fold out \nand begin targeting with th=\r\ne large bot with difficulty.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;polar_claw_ca&quot; &lt;dfinnam=\r\nore@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: \n&gt; Here we go again. Liek I said, this is just a ve=\r\nry modified \nversion \n&gt; of my previous post. Hopefully its a lil better at =\r\nworking my \n&gt; character entrance. Much as I liked the other post, this has =\r\nto be \n&gt; done, if only to make things better for the rest of you.\n&gt; \n&gt; (IC)=\r\n\n&gt;    \n&gt; The pod bore the heat of atmospheric entry like a champion, \nrippi=\r\nng \n&gt; through the thick prehistoric air of the planet Earth. Carried \ninsid=\r\ne \n&gt; the stasis pod&#39;s shell-like hull was a Maximal, stoic and \ncourageous.=\r\n \n&gt; He had been sent in the stasis pod to provide backup warriors to \n&gt; Max=\r\nimal groups on the planet Earth, where advancing Predacon \nwarriors \n&gt; are =\r\nmaking their collection gambit a reality.\n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; It came in low, lower =\r\nthan the computers of Cybertron had \npredicted. \n&gt; On its current path it w=\r\nas headed for a rocky section of land, \nnear \n&gt; what seemed to be a large s=\r\nettlement of some sort. The reading \n&gt; blinked up against perpetual-thrust =\r\nboosters of the pod, a \nrelatively \n&gt; older model. It was too late for stop=\r\nping procedures. The pod was \n&gt; certain to crash into a thick rock face, a =\r\nfacet of a plateau. As \nthe \n&gt; reverse thrusters ignited as they were autom=\r\nated to do, the pod \nfell \n&gt; into a spiralling tumble, uncontrolled and fas=\r\nt. The \nshuttlecraft&#39;s \n&gt; computers began to malfunction, hard. One by one,=\r\n in rapid \n&gt; succession, the pod&#39;s systems went awry. The boosters, the \n&gt; =\r\nnavigation, the communication, even certain life support systems \nfor \n&gt; th=\r\ne spark of the Maximal. The scanners of the vehicle exploded to \n&gt; life amo=\r\nngst the terrible disconnections of systems, and the \nsensory \n&gt; orb was la=\r\nunched from the rear of the pod.\n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; The small orb was released fro=\r\nm a hatch that slid open. It flew \n&gt; upwards, and two small metallic wings =\r\nflipped out. It fell to the \n&gt; earth below incredibly quickly. It crashed i=\r\nnto the soft ground of \na \n&gt; watering hole. The orb began lifting upwards, =\r\nout of the water, \nand \n&gt; powering up. Most of the suite was busted, very l=\r\nittle or the \ndevice \n&gt; was intact or working. What was operational was the=\r\n uplink to the \n&gt; still-falling stasis pod, and a very weak power core. It =\r\nwas about \nto \n&gt; die and leave the protoform inside the stasis pod stranded=\r\n. \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; At that moment, a herd of elephants shot by in a stampede tow=\r\nards \na \n&gt; watering hole. Caught in the scanner beam of the orb, a male bul=\r\nl \n&gt; elephant was passed over by a small yellow light. The orb&#39;s \nnetwork \n=\r\n&gt; to the pod which still tumbled across the Africa-Asia regions of \n&gt; prehi=\r\nstoric Earth activated and immediately beamed the DNA data to \n&gt; the protof=\r\norm itself, bypassing the computer systems. The robot \n&gt; inside still lived=\r\n.\n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the pod, a rapid transformation took place. The \ntransf=\r\normer&#39;s \n&gt; body was melded in a slick metallic form of beast and machine. \n=\r\nMany \n&gt; minutes passed as the pod shot into a rock face in Asia. The \ndirec=\r\nt \n&gt; uplink had gone straight into the robot. It hadn&#39;t been done \nbefore. =\r\n\n&gt; Who was to know if the former Autobot would emerge deranged, \n&gt; deformed=\r\n, or whether he would even emerge at all. Almost thirty \n&gt; minutes passed a=\r\ns the protoform to shape and did its best to \nfilter \n&gt; out many unnecessar=\r\ny things. \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt;  And then an eruption of fire exploded forth in a show=\r\ner of energy \n&gt; and stone chips. A lone robot stood in a carved out section=\r\n of the \n&gt; rock plateau, twin ion cannons in hand. With suddenness belying =\r\n\nhis \n&gt; large size, the bot shifted to beast mode with a spoken command. \nH=\r\nis \n&gt; body formed that of a huge grey elephant, and the large beast made \n&gt;=\r\n his way down the newly formed hill of rock. Lost in thought as he \n&gt; climb=\r\ned down carefully, the Maximal beast was amazed at the \nimmediate \n&gt; qualit=\r\nies of his transformations, rapid and unstrained. The \n&gt; transformer&#39;s amaz=\r\ning switch to robot mode was a curiosity even to \n&gt; the seasoned former Aut=\r\nobot. He shouldn&#39;t have been able to switch \nso \n&gt; quickly after gaining a =\r\nbeast mode to his protoform, but in fact, \nhe \n&gt; did. \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; Chalking =\r\nit up to his age and stubbornness, for now at least, he \n&gt; continued down t=\r\nhe crushed rock pathway he&#39;d created out of the \n&gt; shattered stone leveled =\r\nby his ion cannons. He hopped from on \nlarge \n&gt; piece to another at one poi=\r\nnt, and it seemed the impact shifted \nthe \n&gt; rock. It slid off its little c=\r\nrutch of stone and slid the rest of \nthe \n&gt; way down.\n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Convenien=\r\nt.&quot;\n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; Looking up and around, and marveled at the beauty of this sm=\r\nall \n&gt; world. The Decepticon and Predacon forces on this world were going \n=\r\nto \n&gt; destroy it if left alone. He couldn&#39;t let that happen, in his \nmind. =\r\n\n&gt; As soon as he found his commanding officer, a computer, and the \n&gt; myste=\r\nries of his change came a little closer to being solved, he \n&gt; would elimin=\r\nate as many as possible. \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Only a half mile away, visible to the si=\r\nlvery savanna animal, was \nthe \n&gt; Autobot base. Running towards it at full =\r\nspeed, he made a beeline \nfor \n&gt; the island stronghold. It would be up to h=\r\nim to discover what the \n&gt; base was and who ran it. If it was Autobot or Ma=\r\nximal, maybe he \ncould \n&gt; find help. If it was Predacon or Decepticon=85 we=\r\nll, Skullhammer \nwould \n&gt; indeed get to test out his robot form again.\n\n\n"}}
