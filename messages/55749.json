Her memory chip \nbrought back the image of Drillbit. She stared for a moment, then \nshook her head to clear her mind of the past. She sat down at a table \nand started to drink the liquid energon. What did she see in \nSharpClaw to make her think of Drillbit, she wondered. Perhaps her \nold chips just needed to be replaced. She sighed and drank her \nenergon.\n\n\n"}}
