I agree, we must remember what we are as well =\r\nas who we are.  Perhaps it&#39;s best that we are all upgraded to transmetallic=\r\n status.

This further loosens up dull scale like film which comes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off =\r\nlike silver translucent material, similar to what a snake sheds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bene=\r\nath it, brilliant shimmering scales emerge. It was like he was slowly\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n evolving beneath an old skin. And as serpents do, his tail seems to grow a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tiny bit longer with the shedding of his old skin. Yet this was only=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happening in his beast mode.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Hmm.. Talon, could you sc=\r\nratch behind my neck for me? It&#39;s the one place\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I can&#39;t reach. I&#39;ve n=\r\never encountered shedding, and this must be what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened to the old =\r\ndragon from time to time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar looks to the shed material cu=\r\nriously and paws at it. He finds it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hard like metal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Wo=\r\nah, it got really hard. Like armor almost. Neat. This must happen ta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nreptiles all the time. I&#39;ve even heard of spiders shedding skins if you can=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that. Ughhh.. I bet Tarantulus does that too, when he&#39;s in s=\r\npider\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mode. Hey speak&#39;n of natural processes, dragons are thought ta =\r\nbreathe fire,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but you don&#39;t seem ta do that huh?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson =\r\nshakes his head.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; No, but I do recall being able to produce so=\r\nme electrical particles using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same principle . And when I roar, i=\r\nt mimics the sound of thunder. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suspect the old dragon was some sort=\r\n of elemental master. He breathes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lightning and roars out thunder thr=\r\nough his vocal chords. I&#39;m beginning to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think he may have past that d=\r\nown to me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar chuckles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; That means when you =\r\nand Talon have a family, your offspring is gonna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inherit that ability=\r\n. Ya never know, your first kid might end up being a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dragon, or ya mi=\r\nght get lucky and have one of each. But if it does take\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after dear ol=\r\nd dad, better make sure it&#39;s not a fire breather.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson chuck=\r\nles and rubs his paw on Uproars head, messing up his fur in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; playful=\r\n manner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; We&#39;ll see, don&#39;t count the dragons before they hatch=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar continues to laugh.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; No, seriously, drag=\r\nons are known ta have more than just one offspring.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They&#39;re like gato=\r\nrs and crocs, they tend to have a clutch of eggs that hatch\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into hatc=\r\nhlings. Reptiles and birds normally produce eggs that hatch when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they=\r\n&#39;ve fully developed. The only exception is, that some snake species\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nctually bare live young. Now that could happen too, but for the most part,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dragons lay eggs and so do birds. Soooo, you guys might just produce =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; small clutch of eggs that need ta be incubated over a course of tim=\r\ne. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dunno, its just some intel I read on birds and reptiles.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; It&#39;s alright, I&#39;ve read that too at one po=\r\nint. You&#39;re correct, it could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen that way. Which makes me curious=\r\n as to other organic properties I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be experiencing.. Like hung=\r\ner... I admit, I snapped up a fish from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a near by water source and I =\r\nconsumed it in beast mode. And the other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mammals for some odd reason =\r\nsparked my appetite. But I didn&#39;t have the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spark to hunt them. I mere=\r\nly got a meal from the water instead. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar nods.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot; Confession, I took down a wild pig and I ate it... In beast mode of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; course. And it tasted really good too. I bet Stanton would know what&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; happening to us, right Stanton?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As TUCSON and=\r\n NIGHTSHIFT talked a troubled expression was on BUMP&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; face. He glanced=\r\n over at SANTON who only nodded.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You must be careful.&quot; SANTON sai=\r\nd as he and BUMP carefully prepared\n&gt; &gt; NIGHTSHIFT in an effort to cure him=\r\n of the spreading metallic\n&gt; &gt; infection. &quot;Despite the fact that we have th=\r\nese beast modes we are not\n&gt; &gt; truly organic life.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BUMP nodded, &quot;=\r\nWe still have gyro stabilizers instead of fluid based\n&gt; &gt; inner ear chamber=\r\ns.
