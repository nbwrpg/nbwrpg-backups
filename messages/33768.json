I&#39;m well aware it&#39;s been WAY more than a month, a lot has\nhappened,\n&gt; &gt;and I&#39;d like to make a fresh start. I would like to have all my\nprevious\n&gt; &gt;entries forgotten(as you probably already have), and im probably\ngoing to\n&gt; &gt;have missed a lot of stuff when I finally post, so forgive me if I\nmake a\n&gt; &gt;mistake. It&#39;s twelve o&#39; clock where I am now, so I don&#39;t know what\nelse to\n&gt; &gt;write, so I guess I&#39;ll be signing off now.\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
