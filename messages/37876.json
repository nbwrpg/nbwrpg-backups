All systems at \n&gt; are 100%, scans report no Cybertronian units in the vicinity.&quot; some bridge \n&gt; officer replied.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good,&quot; Kaiser said with a nod, activating his personal comm. unit, \n&gt; &quot;Vice-President Suka prepare a garrison of seventy-five lightly armed peoples \n&gt; and after we have landed erect a perimeter guard a hundred feet out of the \n&gt; firing range of the Otyebis&#39; defenses.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The viewscreen displayed the greenish burnt ground below the Otyebis where \n&gt; the ship was destined to land, the ground appearing to get closer very \n&gt; rapidly.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hold onto something.&quot; Nemo ordered, everyone present on the bridge doing as \n&gt; he said as the Otyebis&#39; main thrusters burst to life and lightly shook the \n&gt; ship, no warning given to anyone that was outside of the bridge.  The flames \n&gt; burnt into the ground several hundred feet below the Otyebis and slowed the \n&gt; ships descent even more, the city-sized craft softly touching to the ground \n&gt; with a light jolt that wouldn&#39;t even knock over a few month old infant.  \n&gt; &quot;Congratulations everyone on a successful landing.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, but we&#39;re not done yet.  Sinew, I want full reports from all sections \n&gt; of the craft on their condition.  Sequencer, send out the welcoming \n&gt; transmission when Suka&#39;s perimeter guard is set up.  I also want reserve \n&gt; troops pulled, this is a volatile world with many different fanatical \n&gt; factions and I don&#39;t want anything messed up.  We have over five hundred \n&gt; thousand civilians on board eager for the games, and when the satellites are \n&gt; sent up hundreds of billions of lifeforms will be watching from their homes.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
