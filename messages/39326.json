He was aiming \nhis Sniper rifle at the crowd of a maximals.  He was there to assinate the \nPresident of Macrosoft.  The Presidents Name was Bill Setag(Gates \nBackwards).\n\n   Just Then Mr. Setag move to the left.  MadMoo looked through the Scope \none last time and fired.  Setag Robotic Head Flew off as he fell to the \nground, his Spark Failing him.\n\n   The Crowd ran around wild with the resent assination.  MadMoo got up from \nhis place in the catwalks and ran for the exit.  When he open the Exit door, \nhe noticed about 5 Cop Cars just pulling up outside.\n\n   &quot;That Son of a Rust Picket set me up.&quot;  MadMoo said to himself as he ran \nin he other direction.\n\n   He open an other door seeing police coming up a staircase.  The lead \npolice Officer told him not to move.  MadMoo took out a smoke Gernade and \nthrew it at the officers.\n\n   &quot;Get Down, its a Gernade.&quot;  The lead police officer yelled as his sqradon \nducked down covering their heads.\n\n   MadMoo closed the door.  He found a Metal Rod and slamed it in the door \nhandle, making it impossile to open.\n\n   MadMoo looked around where he was and noticed he was in a storage area.  \nHe grabbed a rope, blanket, and a Computer Printer.  He tied the Rope around \nthe Computer Printer.  With the blanket he folded it up and put it in one of \nhis storage pit.\n\n   &quot;Hmm, If I hold the Gernade for 2.3562 secounds then throw it the hole \nshould be big enough.&quot;  MadMoo says as he takes out a gernade.  He pulls the \npin.  Excatly 2.3562 seconds after he pulled the pin, he threw it at the \nroof.  Right as the very tip of the gernade hit the roof, it went off.  \nThere was a 11 foot hole(In Radius) in the metalic roof.\n\n   MadMoo took the Printer and threw it up at the hole.  It landed on the \nroof.  MadMoo then grabbed the rope and climb up it.  Somehow the printer \nheld and he made it to the roof.  He then ran to the edge and jumped.  He \nquickly wiped out the blanket and used it as a Parachute.  He made it \nSaftley on the ground.\n\n\nOOC:Sorry for not finishing this, I gtg.
