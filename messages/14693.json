No...she needed \nbetter mech-fluid then that, and she was fairly picky when it came to her \nmeals as well.\nHowever...on her way to this area she had smelled a rather deliciouse scent, \none of mech-fluid but with a strong flow. ( Dinobot&#39;s) That meant that it&#39;s \nowner was healthy and strong, the perfect one in which she could feed. \nHowever, the scent had been stronger then it normaly was, then when she \nsimply smelling it INSIDE the body. No...the scent was stronger because the \nfluid had to be outside the body...wounded.\nShe would make it a chore to find this bot whom owned such deliciouse  \nmech-fluid and feed upon him, quenching her hunger with only the best.\nBut she turned her amber eyes back to the battle and saw Zardus land, firing \noff at some Maximals.\nWell, she guessed that it was about time that she got down and dirty, she \nfolded her wings in and dove towards her target.(Deemos.)\nIn mid-dive she transformed into robot mode and removed a boomerang like \nobject from her back, poison dripping blades along it&#39;s edge.\nShe threw her arm back and then snapped it forward, sending the poison \nboomerang towards Deemos from above.\nBattle not, feed later.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
