He quickly snapped out his rifle and shooting it at the \nground pushing him up used his natural Decepticon ability to fly \nquickly into the air and away from the shots heading for Unitron.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megatron realised what was happening, and in a split second, his \neyes\n&gt; roared to life, shinning brightly. He clutched the ground, the \nquickly\n&gt; rolloed out of the blade&#39;s line of fire, firring in the general\n&gt; direction of Unitron, at his legs, hoping to go under Firestrike.
