She had lost enough mech-fluid that, he was sure, would result in dizziness and loss in balance, which was why he remained close.  A battle, yet another, had sprung up around them less then a mega-cycle ago, it&#39;� force already in full rage. THIS was an environment that Dinobot lived by, and already he had discovered well too many targets in which could give in for the slaughter. Though Tavatron was wounded the battle kept drawing his attention, yet he stayed by her side�even though it too every ounce of will to do so.  However, for protection against the attacking enemy he had drawn a fully charged plasma/hydraulic phaser fortunately supplied by the hidden compartment in this, not so new, body. It had been months since he had reformed in this shell and still he was discovering new properties to it, and some others he would wish he never had. But form now the wounded fembot and battle was all that concerned him, though he wasn�t about to wait for either. Tavatron needed repair and rest and he needed to join in the battle before he had forgotten how to fight.\r\nDinobot, while keeping an optic trained on the battle, moved to push Tavatron with the intention to get her moving towards the Cybertronien Fire, wishing her to just follow the leaded direction without a fuss, for, she would only make it harder upon herself to do otherwise. In no mood to hear any back talk, he would carry her there over his shoulder if need be. Though, transforming into beast-mode would also help he would insist she sit this one out.\r\nHe sighed. He was getting soft; it was especially so if he was troubling himself about some fem he had met less then a year ago. Lick sucked sometimes. He moved to push her again, yet, not moving from his own position.** � Get moving.� ** was the snarl the followed, Dinobot would stay out on the field while Tavatron would move inside to recover and repair, however, he would watch her back all the path to those iron clad doors. There was a battle to be won and he would be soft no longer.**\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
