She felt pale with the fear of what \nMegatron was going to do to her.  Then she remembered that her body \nwas different.  It gave her a small edge on things.  \n\nShe looked at Aracnia, &quot;Do you know what Megatron is going to do?&quot;  \nShe shook her head.  &quot;I&#39;m as good as scrap. Why did you bring me back \nto life just to have me return to death?&quot;  She looked down and sighed.\n&quot;well, might as well join it now then later on I guess.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron shighs as he looks out onto the battle feild.

He went out, and opened \nfire.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Waspinator soars down from the sky and dives right into the \nbunker \n&gt; opening like a flash. He jets down the tunnle, and sets down in the \nTriangle \n&gt; room.\n&gt;     &quot;Hello mouse bot!&quot; He said to Darkmouse, and then walked past \nthem to \n&gt; Black Aracnia.\n&gt;     &quot;Megatron wants to know why you cut of communications. Hes very \nmad....&quot;\n&gt;     Aracnia shook her head. &quot;Tell him to come here, now that the \ncommunicator \n&gt; is broken. Take Atma and his ally with you to assist in the battle. \nOk?&quot;\n&gt;     Waspinator nodded and turned to Darkmouse. &quot;Bub bye mousey. \nHehehe.&quot; And \n&gt; then flew away.\n\n\n"}}
