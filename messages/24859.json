Why didn&#39;t she herself think of that?\n\nStepping off Instrat and flapping her wings, the Fuzor rose higher \ninto the the sky and turned her cloaking on, so no-one could see her. \nTeltoli watched the trees with emerald eyes, hoping she could catch \nsight of her friend among the cover.\n\nSmelling a faint scent of animal blood, she dove lower and picked up \nthe form of Carnage, lunching on boar. Teltoli smiled and turned her \ncloaking off, landing a few meters away and neatly folding her wings \nacross her back.\n\n&quot;Um, sorry for that back there.. I kinda got carried away. This whole \nday has been so stressful! I mean, first I come out of my Ship, and \nget attacked by practically the whole Alliance fleet. Then I try go \nto Maximal Base for help, but they take soooo long in actually \ngetting off their asses, and their ship is still getting attacked. \nSo, I started another Alliance/Maximal war..&quot; The Fuzor sighs.\n\n&quot;And &#39;then&#39;, I come to find you, and this stupid bot starts \nattacking, and my rage just sorta bubbled over. You know how it is..&quot; \nShe trailed off, slightly uneasy by the silence.\n\nTeltoli shifted her front paws. &quot;I hope you&#39;re not mad at me for \nleaving before.. I did what I had to do..&quot;\n\nThe Fuzor trailed off again, the end of her voice giving way to the \nsounds of the forest and her own breathing inside her ears.\n\n\n"}}
