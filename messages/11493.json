Last he remembered,\nhe was aboard a ship sent on a wild goose chase to\nfind and rescue Optimus Primal and his crew of morons\nonboard the Axalon. He had known Primal and was never\nimpressed with him or his crew.Now he wakes up in a\nstasis pod on an unfamiliar planet with no idea what\nhappened to his ship or how long he had been drifting\nin space before he got here.Now to top it all off he\nfinds himself bringing spare parts to repair the Ark,\nthe most legendary ship in Cybertron history, with the\nAutobots and Decepticons lying in stasis.In his years\nas a soldier, he learned to expect the unexpected, but\nnothing could&#39;ve prepared him for this. He had a\nfeeling he wasnt going to like this planet much.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
