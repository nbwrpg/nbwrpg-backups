What good is loyalty to someone who would feed \ndozens \n&gt; &gt; of loyal followers to Unicron just to save his own miserable \nhide?  \n&gt; &gt; Hydras only cares about himself.  He wants to rule the universe, \nand \n&gt; &gt; it doesn&#39;t matter to him what happens to anyone else along the \nway.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She smirked. Only listening for now. &#39;typical&#39; she thought. It was \nall too \n&gt; familiar. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Empath digs a little further into Maxima&#39;s mind, bringing the \nmemory \n&gt; &gt; of that kiss to the forefront.  &quot;If you bought it, he&#39;d only be \nupset \n&gt; &gt; because he lost his newest plaything.  He&#39;s using you, Maxima.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Stopping for a moment as she stared at Empath. &quot;So much for \ntechnology. It&#39;s \n&gt; not as good as the old Cybertronian technology we were once equiped \nwith.&quot; \n&gt; then she continued on walking beside Empath. &quot;Obviously. But \nGalvatron did \n&gt; that a lot as well, Empath.&quot; Glancing sideways as her. &quot;Or did you \nforget \n&gt; that already?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Continuing to walk in her feline state. &quot;I&#39;ve noticed much of \nGalvatron in \n&gt; him. However, I&#39;m like Megatron... I belong to no body. I have my \nown \n&gt; objectives. Remember.. the only one I obey & will follow without \nquestion... \n&gt; is Megatron.&quot; Her voice reflected the memories of the painful yet \njoyous \n&gt; past. Then she laughed. &quot;Besides,&quot; she smirked,&quot; I am not that easy \nto \n&gt; destroy.&quot; Living this long, proved that. She always made it \nthrough, \n&gt; surviving... until the next battle. &quot;If Hydras has any of \nMegatron&#39;s \n&gt; memories, then he should know me by now.&quot; pausing a \nmoment. &quot;Whatever \n&gt; happened between Hydras & I... was a mere fabrication of ... \norganic \n&gt; emotions. Which... I am immune to.&quot; she only looked ahead of \nher. &quot;The \n&gt; closest to such organic weaknesses that I have, is my loyalty to \nMegatron.&quot; \n&gt; Pausing yet again. &quot;In which I have nearly lost my own functioning \nability \n&gt; due to someone&#39;s foolish desire to depose him. I... getting in the \nway.. to \n&gt; protect him... serve him...&quot; she trailed off.. it was more like she \nwas \n&gt; muttering. Why she was &#39;pouring out her heart&#39; to Empath was \nsomething she \n&gt; never done. perhaps,.. it was this organic part of her. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Let him try to use me. He&#39;ll be greatly disappointed.&quot; She \ngrowled, sounding \n&gt; just like she was in the old days at the beginning of the Great War.\n\nEmpath laughs.  &quot;You&#39;re as immune to emotions as a wet iron bar is to \nrust,&quot; she taunts.  &quot;You&#39;ll be sleeping with that egotistical \nscrapheap before you know it.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
