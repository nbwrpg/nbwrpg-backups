I had been work=\r\ning with Lord Perseus, a commander of the Maximals of Atlantis, we left, an=\r\nd happened upon a planet, where we came in contact with an old Maximal base=\r\n. From that base, I learned of what had happened to my commander, and comra=\r\nde, Rodimus Prime. He had been abducted by Hydras, and turned against his f=\r\naction forcefully. I heard of what happened and I knew I had to begin my ow=\r\nn quest to try and recover Rodimus, no matter if I was destroyed in the pro=\r\ncess while doing so. I traveled to the Black Fortress, where I had learned =\r\nthe whereabouts of Dark Rodimus, who was Rodimus but reprogrammed into a da=\r\nrker figure and turned into a slave of Lord Hydras. It was a long battle, a=\r\nnd at first, I did not succeed. I was rescued myself by a tiny Maximal, nam=\r\ned Rat Trap, who I could see desperately needed a friend, and in saving me,=\r\n he found one and so did I. He called for backup and I was recovered by Lor=\r\nd Elder, a leader of a Maximal group. He had faithfully guarded the Autobot=\r\n Ark until such time that an Autobot would return to restore what was lost.=\r\n It was there where I was lead to the body of Optimus Prime, and it was the=\r\nre where the Matrix of Leadership granted me it&#39;s power and I was given the=\r\n power of the Primes. Now, before this, I was known as just Tucson, an aver=\r\nage Autobot, who fought faithfully in the wars, but suffered a great defeat=\r\n which left me visually impaired even today. But for some reason, right now=\r\n, it seems to have corrected itself. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He shifts his weight and then be=\r\ngins to tell the rest of the tale.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That leads me to your question Ves=\r\ntige. When I was at the Black fortress, I released a bolt of energy from my=\r\n spark, which supposedly was supposed to heal Rodimus of any possession tha=\r\nt Hydras may have had over him. Not at first though. He had recovered a sma=\r\nll fraction of his old self but was quickly overcome by the evil once more.=\r\n But it was not until he had sensed something within him that he made the c=\r\nhange back to his normal self. So, we all began to proceed out of the Black=\r\n fortress, only to be entrapped by another enemy. An enemy which was insect=\r\nile, and arachnid in nature. Rodimus told me to run, and at first I did, bu=\r\nt in my spark I knew I could not abandon him. So, I went back and proceeded=\r\n to search for Rodimus along with my comrades. Once we found him, he was bo=\r\nund by countless numbers of dangerous tendrills, and the only way for me to=\r\n save him, was to lend my spark in efforts to save his. And that is how I g=\r\not here. I will do what ever it takes to recover Rodimus. I lost him three =\r\ntimes, I will not lose him again. I could have fought the arachnids, but I =\r\nsaw something disturbing in them. Their colors, they were the same as Rodim=\r\nus Prime&#39;s.. The bright reds, oranges and yellows of his armor and vehicula=\r\nr form. There is more to defeating the evil than meets the eye and perhaps =\r\nyou may be able to tell me about this place, and from there I can compile a=\r\n strategy to get Rodimus back. I don&#39;t want to make any foolish moves if I =\r\ndon&#39;t have to.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercy=\r\nclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson puts his hands up in =\r\nsubmission, to show that he meant no harm.
