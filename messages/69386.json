The cargo ramp lowered and the crew walked\n&gt; &gt; out into the scene of the disaster. They were greeted by Lord Perseus\n&gt; &gt; who stopped digging through debris to fill them in on what happened.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Right before the tidal wave hit, we saw a massive ship fly overhead,\n&gt; &gt; not 300m above us.&quot; he said. &quot;Something that massive falling from\n&gt; &gt; orbit could easily explain the force of the water.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;How&#39;s the rest of the city,&quot; asked Salveo.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Not good. Most the people escaped to their shelters, however the\n&gt; &gt; buildings were all destroyed. Except the tower and several on the far\n&gt; &gt; side of the island.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The shuttles?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ours was destroyed, a few were in the air when the wave hit.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I dont think we can rebuild this.&quot; said Salveo after a moment of\n&gt; &gt; looking at the devistation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I think its possible, but unwise. I think this gives us a new\n&gt; &gt; opportunity to rejoin our Maximal allies and pool our resources. So\n&gt; &gt; for the moment, we should recover what we can and put it into the\n&gt; &gt; shuttle, then assist Atlantis in anyway possible.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rejoin Lord Elder? Will that work? And what about Atlantis?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Atlantis will be safe from the Unicronians; they wont bother with a\n&gt; &gt; few hundred scientists and fisherman. What they want is to destroy\n&gt; &gt; us, and they will follow us wherever we decide to have our base. As\n&gt; &gt; for that crashed ship, I dont think its wise to mount a expedition\n&gt; &gt; while the city lies in ruin and we remain baseless.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Right, so priority one, help the city and recover what we can from\n&gt; &gt; our base.&quot; replied Salveo.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Correct.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 4/30/09, airly2002@... &lt;airly2002%40hotmail.com&gt; &lt;\n&gt; airly2002@... &lt;airly2002%40hotmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Talon:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Talon nodded and Followed Lord Elder.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kup.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kup followed salveo but he still regrets to leave Roddy, windlord and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nightlight behind\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Kraftlos\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, April 27, 2009 8:25 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com &lt;nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: The Crash Landing and Aftermath\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Lord Perseus opened the door to the lower level of the base, and water\n&gt; &gt;&gt; poured into the room.

Knowing that their only hope of survival was\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; safely crash land, the pilot picked an open area of ocean and tried to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; approach at a safe angle to slow itself enough to keep the ship intact.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Lord Perseus and his crew walked along the bridge that crossed the gap\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; between the part of the island where the hangers were located and the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; peninsula area where the base sat. Suddenly the sky became dark and a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rumbling noise could be heard, growing louder and louder. He looked up\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; see almost the whole sky occupied by a massive starship seemly heading\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; straight for the island. The Atlantis emergency alarm started to sound\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; civilians rushed to their shelters.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Everyone! To the base! Hurry!&quot; ordered Perseus breaking out into a\n&gt; run.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The rumbling sound continued to get louder. As Perseus and his crew\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; reached\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the base door, it was quickly opened for them then shut behind them. He\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ordered everyone to move the lower level of the base. As the ship\n&gt; passed\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; over the island, the sound grew so loud that the ground shook and\n&gt; weaker\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parts of buildings started to crumble, as in an earthquake. The ship\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; traveled for another three miles before it touched down in the deep\n&gt; ocean\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; waters. The force of the impact sent the ship hundreds of feet below\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; surface and it continued to sink until coming to rest on the top of an\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; underwater mountain. The mass of water displaced by the ship started a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; massive tsunami-like wave, going out in all directions.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The ground began to shake again and the lights flickered inside the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Maximal\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; base.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Sir, what&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing the last heavy door to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; underground section of the base.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The lights continued to flicker, then went out.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; At that moment the ten-story-high wall of water struck Atlantis from\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; east, picking up all the boats in the harbor and tossing them onto the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; land.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The parts of the docks that were not made of concrete were pushed up\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; destroyed. A moment later the water hit the buildings in the lower\n&gt; wharf\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; area and they immediately collapsed under the intense weight of water.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Likewise the metal dome that made up the upper story of the Maximal\n&gt; base\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; was\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; immediately ripped from its foundations and carried away, along with\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; everything in the command center, the armory, mess hall, and the main\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bank\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of CR chambers were also picked up and carried away.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The lower floor of the base had a large metal slab to protect it from\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bombing, and as the water continued to pour over it, everything on the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; upper\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; floors was ripped away, leaving a clean plate of metal sitting at the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bottom\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of the crater that was the base. The buildings along the center of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; town\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; were a little sturdier and remained standing, though heavily damaged.\n&gt; The\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; hanger and all the craft in it were picked up and thrown into the\n&gt; ocean.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; As the water came to tower it filled up the deep trench around the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; structure\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; then the wall hit it, wrapping it entirely except for the top five\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; stories,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; damaging supports, breaking out all the windows and destroying the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bridges\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that allowed access to the tower. The wave then continued across the\n&gt; rest\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of the island, destroying buildings and carrying away the mass of\n&gt; debris,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and then all was eerily quiet.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--0016e64ec4ae2af50a046b6a3b0d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nOOC: Lord Elder and several other maximals were at the Ark=C2=A0 He called =\r\nfor backup and Salveo and his team came to the Ark to help, but had to go b=\r\nack to Atlantis when this disaster occurred.=C2=A0 All the Maximals in Atla=\r\nntis are now helping clean up after this storm, then I think Lord Perseus p=\r\nlans to build a new base somewhere else.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Things got confused when =\r\nSuperCyclonus left.=C2=A0 Are Rodimus and Nightlight still with Megatron?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Tue, Jun 2, 2009 at 8:03 PM,  &lt;span dir=\r\n=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002@...&quot;&gt;airly2002@...=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;bord=\r\ner-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-l=\r\neft: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;padding-right: 10px; padding-l=\r\neft: 10px; padding-top: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot; bgcolo=\r\nr=3D&quot;#ffffff&quot; name=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font s=\r\nize=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Soooo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;A=\r\nrial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;where are th=\r\ney?

Suddenly the sky became dark a=\r\nnd a&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rumbling noise \ncould be heard, growing louder and lou=\r\nder. He looked up to&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see \nalmost the whole sky occupied by =\r\na massive starship seemly \nheading&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; straight for the island.=\r\n The Atlantis emergency alarm \nstarted to sound&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; civilians rushed to their \nshelters.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; &quot;Everyone! To the base! Hurry!&quot; \nordered Perseus breaking out =\r\ninto a run.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The \nrumbling sound continued t=\r\no get louder. As Perseus and his crew&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \nreached&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; the base door, it was quickly opened for them then shut \nbehind them. H=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ordered everyone to move the lower level of the \nbase. As=\r\n the ship passed&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over the island, the sound grew so loud \nt=\r\nhat the ground shook and weaker&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parts of buildings started =\r\nto \ncrumble, as in an earthquake. The ship&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; traveled for ano=\r\nther \nthree miles before it touched down in the deep ocean&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nwaters. The \nforce of the impact sent the ship hundreds of feet below the&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \nsurface and it continued to sink until coming to rest on th=\r\ne top of \nan&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; underwater mountain. The mass of water displac=\r\ned by the ship \nstarted a&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; massive tsunami-like wave, going =\r\nout in all \ndirections.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The ground began to=\r\n shake again and \nthe lights flickered inside the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maximal&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \nbase.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Sir, what&#39;s=\r\n that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, \nsealing the last heavy door to&lt;br&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; underground \nsection of the base.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The lights continued to \nflicker, then went out.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At that moment the \nten-story-high wall of water st=\r\nruck Atlantis from the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; east, \npicking up all the boats in t=\r\nhe harbor and tossing them onto the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \nland.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nThe parts of the docks that were not made of concrete were \npushed up and&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; destroyed. A moment later the water hit the \nbuildings in th=\r\ne lower wharf&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; area and they immediately collapsed \nunder th=\r\ne intense weight of water.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Likewise the metal dome that \nma=\r\nde up the upper story of the Maximal base&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; \nimmediately ripped from its foundations and carried away, along \nwith&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything in the command center, the armory, mess hall, \nan=\r\nd the main&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bank&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of CR chambers were also \np=\r\nicked up and carried away.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The lower floor =\r\nof \nthe base had a large metal slab to protect it from&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bomb=\r\ning, and \nas the water continued to pour over it, everything on the&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; \nupper&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; floors was ripped away, leaving a clean pla=\r\nte of metal \nsitting at the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bottom&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the c=\r\nrater that was the \nbase. The buildings along the center of the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; town&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \nwere a little sturdier and remained standing, th=\r\nough heavily damaged. \nThe&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hanger and all the craft in it w=\r\nere picked up and thrown \ninto the ocean.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A=\r\ns the water came to tower it \nfilled up the deep trench around the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; structure&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \nthen the wall hit it, wrapping it entire=\r\nly except for the top \nfive&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stories,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; damagi=\r\nng supports, breaking out \nall the windows and destroying the&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; bridges&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that \nallowed access to the tower.
