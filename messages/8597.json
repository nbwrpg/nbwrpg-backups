It wanted him. Perhaps to kill \nhim. It snarled and took a step closer. Its pawless legs stepped harshly on \nthe ground.\n\nRowdy Wolf howled and transformed to robot mode. &quot;Leave him alone!&quot; he \ncalled out. He withdrew his rifle and aimed it at the Metal Beast. &quot;Go get \nhim out of here! I&#39;ll deal with this! Go!&quot; He threw his arm out.\n\nHe fired a shot into the Beast&#39;s shoulder, below its cannon.\n\nAbove, Terrorsaur circled nervously.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
