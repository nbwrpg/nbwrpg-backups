This waiting is getting on my nerves.&gt;\nA light but warm breeze stirred the fine grains of sand that were scattered \nover the ground, joined with the cold cinders of past plasma charges. \nRuffling the black fabric which hung from her broad but plated shoulders.  \nIt hadn&#39;t been that long since the last battle and she could admit that she \nwasn&#39;t eager to see another...but with the wish that at least SOMETHING \nwould happen couldn&#39;t help but be made.\n&lt; Maybe after I&#39;m through with the Maximals I can disappear into the \nholo-rooms for a while.&gt;\nBut who was she kidding?! It hadn&#39;t failed yet! Every time she tried to \nstart something, something else just HAD to happen.\n&lt; Oh well. One day.&gt;*\n\n&quot; We&#39;ll wait 20 more cycles for this guy to show, otherwise we&#39;ll head back \ninto the city.&quot;\n\n* Iron spoke outloud so that AzureBlade would hear.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
