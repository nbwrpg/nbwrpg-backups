They\nhad been collectively checking their weapons and getting ready for a\nfight. Now they just glanced at Hydras, but none dared to voice an\nopinion to their leader - Hydras&#39; word was law to them.\n\nInferno stood closer to his leader ready to defend him, the rest of\nthem bracing themselves for what may be a battle!\n\nMeanwhile seven tanks move quickly in Hydras&#39; direction, they look to\neach be large and powerfully built. The are primarily black and silver\nwith bits of crimson that seemed to almost glow eerily as the large\nvehicles close in.\n\nFinally they reach Hydras&#39; is location and the lead tank shifts into\nrobot mode, a large soldier. If anything he is larger, with tracking\nlights on either side of his head, multiple rocket and cannon mounts\non his massive chest and a large gun mount on his shoulder.\n\n&quot;I am Tankor.&quot; The soldier said simply, &quot;You will be escorted to the\ncity.&quot; The other tanks surround Hydras and the others, their muzzles\npointed at the group making Tankor&#39;s command even more forceful!\n\nInferno made as if to step between Tankor to defend Hydras as the\nothers seemed ready to attack!\n\n(TAG)\n\n"}}
